President Boris Yeltsin is ready to return to work, his spokesman 
said Saturday, nearly two weeks after the president was hospitalized 
with pneumonia. What spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin didn't say, however, 
was exactly when Yeltsin will return. Since his hospitalization on 
Nov. 22, Yeltsin has hovered in the deep background of Russia's political 
discourse, largely unseen and unheard. His place at the center of 
national affairs has been taken by his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov. 
In announcing Yeltsin's imminent return, Yakushkin tried to restore 
some luster to the president's image, depicting him as an active, 
well-connected executive even from his hospital bed _ an image few 
Russians are likely to believe anymore. Speaking on Echo Moscow radio, 
Yakushkin said Yeltsin ``remains the most influential politician in 
the country, no matter what is said about it.'' He noted that the 
president remains in control of the device that would authorize a 
nuclear strike. He described Yeltsin as someone who is ``full of energy, 
speaks very brightly and works a lot.'' A desk in his hospital room 
is heaped with working papers, and Yeltsin keeps fully abreast of 
events in the country, the spokesman said. He remarked that alcoholic 
beverages, for which the president is known to have a weakness, are 
``absolutely prohibited'' in the hospital. ``The president does not 
think about his early resignation,'' Yakushkin said. He added, that 
Yeltsin ``is closely watching sharp or insulting statements made by 
certain politicians concerning his actions.'' ``The president remembers 
all of them,'' Yakushkin said. If true, that would attest to a powerful 
memory, since Yeltsin has been insulted or slighted by a wide array 
of political figures lately, from the Communist opposition to his 
own former allies in the political center. Many have urged his resignation, 
but Yeltsin has remained adamant that he will remain in office until 
the end of his term in 2000. The Kremlin had said last week that Yeltsin 
was expected back at work on Monday, but Yakushkin has declined to 
confirm that or say when the president will be released from the hospital. 
Primakov visited Yeltsin on Friday and urged him to stay in the hospital 
until he was better.
