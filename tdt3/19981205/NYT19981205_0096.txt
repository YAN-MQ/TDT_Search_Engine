Diplomats from 60 countries meeting here last week pushed to speed 
the deployment of 2,000 monitors to the province of Kosovo. With 45 
foreign ministers in attendance, the formerly low-key Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe issued a statement bolstering 
its commitment to the biggest mission it has ever faced: keeping a 
lid on Kosovo. But the task of assembling unarmed monitors to hinder 
clashes between the Yugoslav military and ethnic Albanian rebels is 
taking longer than many diplomats had hoped. The plan was announced 
in October as part of a cease-fire agreement that the U.S envoy, Richard 
Holbrooke, reached with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia 
as NATO threatened air strikes. William G. Walker, an American who 
heads the European security group's Kosovo mission, said that the 
first 500 monitors were setting up offices in the Kosovo capital, 
Pristina. The full mission will be 10 times as large as any previous 
deployment by the group, but will not be ready until mid-January. 
Participants in the group's two-day ministerial conference here Wednesday 
and Thursday said they were determined to refute critics who said 
the peace-keeping job was too big for the Vienna-based organization, 
which started in the 1970s as a forum for East-West discussions. ``It 
is essential that we get this right, for the sake of the hundreds 
of thousands of inhabitants of Kosovo who have been displaced, who 
have been deprived of their livelihood and whose homes have been destroyed,'' 
said the Norwegian foreign minister, Knut Vollebaek, who will head 
the security group through 1999. Before the meeting began, the Yugoslav 
government, which was suspended from the group in 1992, sent a communique 
to Oslo lashing out at observers for dealing with ``terrorists, murderers, 
kidnappers, bandits and other criminals'' _ their terms for the Kosovo 
rebels _ in the search for a political settlement. It said rebel attacks 
would be answered ``no matter what the price.'' Walker disputed contentions 
that the monitoring mission is taking too long to start. The monitors 
are arriving from 30 different countries to find limited accommodations 
in Pristina, he said. Some have military or police experience while 
others are specialists in human rights; all require training for a 
unique mission designed to be intrusive but not provocative. He said 
military analysts have warned that ``all hell will break loose'' in 
Kosovo next spring, when the snow melts. Walker played down that prospect 
but noted that 1,800 NATO troops and a fleet of helicopters will be 
stationed in neighboring Macedonia to evacuate his monitors if necessary. 
While the security group's budget this year was $100 million, the 
Kosovo operation alone will cost an estimated $204 million in the 
first year, officials said. The United States has offered to provide 
143 monitors and will pay about 12 percent.
