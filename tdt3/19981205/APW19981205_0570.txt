Rwandan officials said Saturday that hopes for an immediate cease-fire 
in Congo were premature and depended on whether Congolese President 
Laurent Kabila will bow to international pressure and negotiate directly 
with the rebels. Rwandan military sources said rebels in southeastern 
Congo had repelled two days of attacks by government troops and Zimbabwean 
allies at Kabalo, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of the eastern 
rebel stronghold at Goma. Zimbabwe, Kabila's main ally, lost three 
armored personnel carriers in attempts to cross the Nzofu Bridge over 
the Congo River, the sources said. The number of casualties was not 
immediately known, the sources said, and the rebel positions remained 
unchanged. Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the rebel leader, said fighting 
was also reported around rebel-held Moba on Lake Tanganyika, where 
his troops repelled a government counteroffensive. Neither claim could 
be confirmed independently. In New York, a senior U.N. official said 
Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Congo were expected to sign a formal 
cease-fire at a summit in Lusaka, Zambia on Dec. 14-15, to be enforced 
by deployment of at least 15,000 peacekeepers. The agreement follows 
promises by African leaders in Paris last week to stop fighting in 
Congo. Both Wamba and Rwandan officials, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said the cease-fire could be signed only if the rebels 
negotiated directly with Kabila _ something the Congolese president 
has been rejecting since the revolt began Aug. 2. There has been no 
reaction from the Congolese capital, Kinshasa. The rebels are trying 
to overthrow Kabila, who came to power in May 1997 after toppling 
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He promised reform and 
democracy in his renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, but many critics 
say his regime's 18 months in power has seen repressive policies and 
a growing intolerance of criticism. The rebels include ethnic Tutsis, 
disaffected soldiers and opposition politicians who accuse Kabila 
of mismanagement, corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400 ethnic 
groups. Kabila says they are the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, and 
demands the withdrawal of foreign troops. Both countries say they 
intervened to prevent anti-Tutsi massacres and protect their borders 
from Rwandan and Ugandan rebels who had been recruited by the government 
to fight. Wamba, who was in the Ugandan capital to discuss the Congo 
situation with President Yoweri Museveni later Saturday, said the 
rebels have been calling for a cease-fire and negotiations _ as long 
as they are conducted face-to-face with Kabila. ``We have asked to 
be included in peace talks at all levels,'' Wamba said. ''We need 
to know if this has been granted or not.'' ``Interpositioning of a 
neutral force in Congo is also an object of negotiations. The U.N. 
may be foreseeing that possibility, but it depends on too many factors,'' 
Wamba said.
