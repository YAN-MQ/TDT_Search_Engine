TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan failed to 
reach agreement Saturday on bringing two Libyans to trial for the 
1988 Pan Am airliner bombing despite what he called ``fruitful and 
positive'' talks with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Annan said, however, 
he believed an arrangement for trying the two Libyan suspects could 
be secured in ``not an inordinate'' amount of time. The secretary-general 
talked to reporters after meeting Gadhafi at an undisclosed location 
in the Libyan desert. Libyan TV showed the Libyan leader, in a brown 
robe and cap, shaking hands with Annan. It was a long day of diplomacy 
for the 60-year-old Annan. He left Jerba, Tunisia, in the morning 
for Tripoli, held talks with Libyan officials in the coastal city 
of Sirte, then took what was said to be a two-hour journey to his 
desert meeting with Gadhafi. Annan is trying to get Libya to go along 
with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of 
Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, that left 270 people dead. ``The talks have been 
fruitful and positive,'' Annan said after his meeting with Gadhafi. 
``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and readiness to find a solution 
to the Lockerbie problem. ``Libya has also agreed to a trial in a 
third country and believes that it ought to be possible to find answers 
to all other outstanding issues,'' he said. ``It will require some 
time but not an inordinate amount.'' The meeting with Gadhafi took 
place after Libya's official news agency, JANA, reported Annan might 
not be able to meet with the leader because Gadhafi was ``in the desert.'' 
JANA reported that Annan met with Libya's foreign minister, Omar al-Muntasser, 
in Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the capital Tripoli. 
Earlier, Libyan media suggested Gadhafi had no authority to hand over 
the suspects _ an indication he was giving himself room in case he 
decides against giving up the two men wanted by the United States 
and Britain. JANA indicated a decision on handing over Abdel Basset 
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah would have to be approved 
by some 500 grassroots national committees before being decided by 
the parliament. Libyan radio reported that the parliament had been 
called to meet Tuesday in Sirte. But the report, monitored by the 
British Broadcasting Corp., did not say whether the Lockerbie issue 
would be discussed. Most reporters were barred from traveling with 
Annan from Tripoli to Sirte. While Libyan media gave few reports about 
the visit, ordinary Libyans were aware of the developments and many 
said they oppose handing over the suspects. ``We should never surrender 
our children no matter what the price is,'' Tripoli fisherman Ahmed 
Abdel-Salam said. Nasser Bouaicha, a shopkeeper in a bustling downtown 
market, said the men should be tried in Libya. ``We have judges and 
we have law,'' he said. Annan flew into Libya aboard a special plane 
from the Tunisian resort island of Jerba after receiving clearance 
from the U.N. Sanctions Committee. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions 
since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two suspects, allegedly 
Libyan intelligence agents. A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly 
with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try 
the suspects in the Netherlands under Scottish law and using Scottish 
judges. The Netherlands was chosen as a venue after Libya proposed 
that the trial be held in a neutral country. Since then, a new hurdle 
has cropped up over the imprisonment of the suspects, if convicted. 
Libya wants them jailed in the Netherlands or Libya, but the United 
States and Britain say they should be imprisoned in Scotland and refuse 
to negotiate the issue. The U.N. sanctions on Libya do not cover oil 
exports, Libya's economic lifeblood, though some Libyan assets abroad 
have been frozen. They ban air travel to and from the country and 
arms sales, but many African countries have defied the air ban and 
their leaders have flown in and out of Libya.
