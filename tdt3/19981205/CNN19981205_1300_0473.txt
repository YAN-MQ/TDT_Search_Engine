The Mercury topped out at 37 degrees in the northwest territories 
of Canada yesterday. And some residents say that's too hot. The normal 
high for this time of year up there is three below. Seal and caribou 
hunters say the weather is keeping them off the ice. The warmth is 
not limited to Canada. On the east coast of the United States, the 
highs have been about 30 degrees warmer than average.
