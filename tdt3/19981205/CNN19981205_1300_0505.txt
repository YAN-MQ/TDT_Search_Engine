This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News" weather update. 
A low pressure system and a cold front moved through the Great Lakes 
and the upper Mississippi valley, as another area of low pressure 
heads toward the gulf coast. Look for scattered snow showers early 
in the period, but a chance of showers and thunderstorms mix with 
snow showers in the Great Lakes can be expected through Sunday. A 
new pacific storm system will mean off-and-on snow showers for the 
rockies, with heavy rainfall beginning the weekend in the west. Temperatures 
will cool dramatically across the western United States, with 40s 
and 50s along the pacific coast, 20s and 30s for the Rockies and the 
northern plains. You'll see 40s for the northern Great Lakes, warming 
into the 70s and 80s for the gulf coast. On the extended forecast, 
Monday's cold temperatures continue pushing eastward with heavy rain 
in the west and a few thunderstorms in the east. Thunderstorms Hang 
on through Tuesday, but heavy rain and a mix of rain and snow can 
be expected for New England. Look for heavy rain in the west, gradually 
tapering to showers by wednesday. The extended forecast for more than 
7,000 cities is at CNN.com.
