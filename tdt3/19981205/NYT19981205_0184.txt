Vladimir Dokoudovsky, a founding member of Ballet Theater, a principal 
dancer with the Ballets Russes troupes of the 1930s and '40s and an 
influential teacher in New York, died on Wednesday at St. Clare's 
Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan. The cause 
was heart failure, said his wife, Patricia. As a member of the Mordkin 
Ballet, a forerunner of American Ballet Theater, Dokoudovsky was among 
the dancers who in 1940 formed the nucleus for the first New York 
season of Ballet Theater, as that company was originally called. He 
was best known for his appearances with the two organizations that 
tried to preserve the heritage of Diaghilev's innovative Ballets Russes: 
Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes and the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. 
He danced with the Monte Carlo company in 1938, and with the colonel's 
group from 1942 to 1952, interrupting his tenure there to return to 
the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo as a guest artist in 1950 and 1951. 
He also choreographed ``Les Femmes d'Alger,'' inspired by a Delacroix 
painting, for de Basil in 1952. Born in Monte Carlo of Russian and 
Italian parents, Dokoudovsky received his early training from Olga 
Preobrajenska in Paris and made his debut with the Monte Carlo Opera 
Ballet in 1934. Although noted for his wide range of classical and 
character parts, Dokoudovsky specialized in the works of such Ballets 
Russes choreographers as Michel Fokine, Leonide Massine and David 
Lichine. He was especially associated with Fokine's choreography, 
displaying his versatility in such roles as the barbaric Warrior in 
``Prince Igor,'' the sensuous Golden Slave in ``Scheherazade'' and 
the nimble Harlequin in ``Carnaval,'' as well as in the title roles 
of ``Petrouchka'' and ``Paganini.'' In recent years, Dokoudovsky revived 
Ballets Russes productions for several regional companies. In the 
early 1950s, he started teaching in New York schools, including Ballet 
Arts and the American Ballet Theater School. He opened his own New 
York Conservatory of Dance in 1977. A popular teacher, he was also 
a highly demanding one and his authoritative presence led several 
generations of students to nickname Dokoudovsky ``the Duke.'' In addition 
to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Tatiana Dokoudovska of Kansas 
City, Mo.
