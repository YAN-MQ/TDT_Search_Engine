Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak arrived in Ankara on Saturday for 
a two-day official visit to discuss Turkey's often strained ties with 
the Arab world. Mubarak helped mediate between Ankara and Damascus 
after Turkey threatened military action against Syria unless it stopped 
sheltering Turkish Kurdish rebels. Turkey and Syria signed a security 
cooperation deal following Egyptian mediation in October, which resulted 
with Syria's expulsion of the rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. ``I could 
see that the Arab world would be forced to side with Syria,'' daily 
Milliyet quoted Mubarak in an interview published on Thursday. Turkey 
is still reportedly uneasy about Syria's reluctance to extradite all 
Kurdish rebels. But Mubarak said: ``What is important is that we have 
prevented a war.'' Pre-dominantly Muslim Turkey's relations with the 
Arab world has already been tense because of its close economic and 
military cooperation with Israel. Arab countries and Iran accuse Turkey 
of tipping the balance in the volatile region by getting closer with 
the Jewish state. Turkey says its cooperation with Israel does not 
threat any country. During his talks, Mubarak is also expected to 
discuss ways to improve bilateral trade.
