Former senator Bill Bradley is considering a run for the White House. 
The New Jersey democrat who chose not to seek re-election in 1996 
has formed a committee to explore his chances of winning his party's 
nomination in 2000. The Rhodes scholar and former basketball star 
called vice President Gore to tell him about the decision. A Gore 
aide says the vice president respects Bradley, and is not surprised 
by the announcement. This is not about vice President Gore or me. 
This is about telling the country what I believe, going out and talking 
with the people, as I've done for 30 years. And if they believe what 
I believe, then we have a chance of succeeding. Meanwhile, sources 
tell CNN republican senator John Ashcroft of Missouri will announce 
his plans to run for president early next month. His advisers say 
Ashcroft intends to seek re-election to the Senate at the same time.
