If only we could order self-sacrifice from the Sharper Image catalog. 
If only it could arrive by UPS next-day, along with the exfoliating 
foot cream and the portable shoulder &AMP; neck massager and the designer 
dog-biscuit mix. Your very own landing on Omaha Beach, just $3,999.99, 
for the man who has everything. Or maybe just some of the sand, for 
$39.99. Usually, we baby boomers are content fooling around with the 
accessories and amenities of our life style. But every so often, we 
get that queasy feeling that we have become too much like ourselves 
_ indulged too much, challenged too little. We are overmarketed, oversophisticated, 
overspun, overspinning. We need a shot of medicinal grandeur. In 1992, 
it was our turn. We put a primary specimen of ourselves in the White 
House. And what did it amount to? A marathon fight over foreplay and 
targeted cuts. Not exactly an auspicious debut for the Age of Aquarius. 
Now we have decided to give a grateful nod to the sacrifices our parents 
made to create a world where yuppies can agonize over whether to install 
a home gym, a home spa, a home casino, a wine cellar, a smoking room 
or a $15,000 gas plasma high-definition TV with a 160-degree viewing 
angle. Retro patriotism has become the hottest trend since Martha 
Stewart introduced the perception of molding. Surrounded by politicians 
baked in hypocrisy, self-pity and self-indulgence, we yearn for those 
old verities _ heroism, duty, honor, loyalty. Enter Steven Spielberg 
and Tom Hanks. They are following up their ``Private Ryan'' success 
by making a 13-part HBO mini-series based on the Stephen Ambrose book 
``Band of Brothers,'' about a group of World War II paratroopers. 
The big Christmas movie is Terrence Malick's ``The Thin Red Line,'' 
based on James Jones' novel about the Allied campaign on Guadalcanal. 
Peter Jennings' new coffee-table book, ``The Century,'' features a 
raft of grainy black-and-white pictures of that era before we get 
to those who have made a mark at the end of century: Oliver North, 
Bill Gates, Dr. Jack Kevorkian. A top Washington Post editor, Rick 
Atkinson, is leaving his job to write three books on World War II 
called ``The Liberation Trilogy.'' Tom Brokaw has written a paean 
to Americans who lived through the Depression and the Second World 
War called ``The Greatest Generation.'' ``Their generation didn't 
fumble it,'' Brokaw says. ``And they had such an extraordinary generosity 
of spirit, whether it was rebuilding their enemies, taking care of 
each other, not doing any of this kind of public self-examination.'' 
Asked how his subjects from the strong, silent generation regarded 
their children from the weak, chatty one, the NBC anchor replied: 
``They're bemused. They think there are too many toys, too much play 
time, too little concentration on what really counts.'' He predicts 
that Americans will engage in ``a huge rejection of slickness and 
packaging. There has been a lot of artificiality in both political 
camps. The World War II generation was all about authenticity. Whatever 
else happened in their lives, they faced death on a daily basis. And 
that is something that cannot be duplicated in a weekend white-water 
rafting trip.'' Boomers came of age promoting big things _ civil rights, 
social justice, feminism, an end to an unjust war, an end to a crooked 
presidency. But now we seem bogged down in petty things. And cultural 
recycling _ from ``The Parent Trap'' to ``Psycho'' to World War II. 
Now in the slough of reading glasses and Pepcid AC, boomers fear missing 
the chance to test their mettle. Our idea of warfare is opposition 
research. We're nagged by the suspicion that we're just material boys 
and material girls. Historians will record that our generation's contribution 
was to be the generation that worried about its contribution. Our 
parents are growing old and dying, and we feel small. But in fact, 
our smallness is just our latest conceit. If you hurry, you can still 
have Neiman Marcus deliver before Christmas a British Ferret Mark 
1 armored scout car. ``Coming exclusively to Neiman Marcus from the 
British Army Reserves, the Ferret ... carries a crew of two; one or 
two `friendly' people may be added to the commander's seat area for 
cruising around the ranch ... Used by more than 30 countries: 1953 
_ Desert Storm. $25,000.''
