A bomb exploded in a tax office in this southern French town overnight, 
causing some damage but no injuries, authorities said Saturday. They 
linked the attack to wine-growers demanding disaster aid. The bomb 
exploded late Friday night inside the meeting room on the main floor 
of the building, ripping through the ceiling, destroying some furniture 
and shattering windows. There was no claim of responsibility, though 
police said the office walls were found with the inscription CRAV, 
the French initials for the Wine-growers' Regional Action Committee. 
The group last week criticized the government as being slow to provide 
aid for a frost that occurred last April.
