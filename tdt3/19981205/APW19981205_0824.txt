A Haitian-American who returned to his home island to buy property 
was shot and killed in what may be a robbery, a security official 
said Saturday. The victim was identified as Frico Damas, a resident 
of Massachusetts, but his age and address were not immediately available 
from police. Efforts to reach U.S. embassy officials for further information 
Saturday were unsuccessful. The killing comes one year and one day 
after Willy and Alicia Merisier of Boston suffered the same fate when 
they returned to their home island with dlrs 30,000 in cash and traveler's 
checks to build a retirement home. Damas was killed in the Santos 
area near the capital, where he was looking at some land, not far 
from the site where the Merisiers were killed, according to the security 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Haiti is the poorest 
country in the western hemisphere and the official said police suspect 
robbery was the motive in both killings.
