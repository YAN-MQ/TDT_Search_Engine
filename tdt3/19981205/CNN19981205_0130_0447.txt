Researchers say they have identified a particular Gene variation that 
causes HIV to accelerate rapidly and become AIDS. Researchers at the 
national cancer institute say a small percentage of AIDS patients 
have the variation. Some forms of the Gene can block the rapid spread 
of HIV, but other variations can cause the disease to speed up. The 
discovery could help the search for a vaccine.
