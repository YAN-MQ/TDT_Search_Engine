Voodoo made him do it. That's the claim of a Nigerian immigrant who 
has been sentenced in columbus, Ohio, for selling drugs. The man said 
he once lived with a woman who was a witch. He claims she repeatedly 
fed him "voodoo poisonous food." After the couple split up, he says 
she appeared in his dreams and ordered him to send money. To raise 
the cash, he began selling drugs. In spite of the story, the judge 
threw him in jail for two and a half years.
