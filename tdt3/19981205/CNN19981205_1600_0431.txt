U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan is meeting with Libyan leader Moammar 
gadhafi at this hour. Annan delayed his departure from the country 
because Gadhafi was unavailable earlier in the day. Annan already 
met with other officials to discuss making arrangements for libya 
to surrender the suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Gadhafi 
proposed the two men be tried in a third country. In August, the United 
States and Britain agreed to a trial in the netherlands. Now Libya 
is demanding that if the suspects are convicted, they serve their 
sentences in the Netherlands or Libya. The United States and Britain 
have rejected the demand.
