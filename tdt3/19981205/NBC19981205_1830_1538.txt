Doctors in San Francisco are debating whether a prison inmate with 
only one kidney should be permitted to donate that organ to his daughter. 
By doing so, David Patterson would put his own life in jeopardy. He 
would need kidney dialysis while serving the final three years of 
his prison sentence. 16-year-old Renada Daniel Patterson desperately 
needs this transplant, because the kidney her father gave her two 
years ago is now failing. Her mother is hoping someone else will come 
forward.
