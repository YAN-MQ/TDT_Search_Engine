Top government officials on Saturday berated billionaire financier 
George Soros after he called for the ouster of Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamad and the release of his jailed former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim. 
Soros harbors a long-term plan ``to destroy the democratically-elected 
government of this country,'' Works Minister Samy Vellu told the national 
news agency Bernama. ``In view of his selfish motives to enrich himself, 
he has chosen to destroy the economy of the developing nations,'' 
he was quoted as saying. ``Malaysia is one of the victims of the economic 
wounds inflicted by him.'' Mahathir has not reacted publicly to Soros' 
comments. In a speech Thursday, Soros told a U.S. audience that Malaysians 
should turn against their prime minister because his policies were 
aimed at benefiting himself and his cronies. ``I think what needs 
to happen is he needs to be removed from power,'' he said at the Johns 
Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. Anwar 
was sacked on Sept. 2, after Mahathir said his former protege was 
too immoral to rule. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, and is on trial 
on charges of corruption and illegal sex acts. Mahathir, 72, has repeatedly 
accused Soros and other speculators of using highly speculative investments 
to move markets and destroy Malaysia's once-booming economy. On Saturday, 
the chief minister of Perak state, Ramli Ngah Talib, told Malaysians 
to ignore Soros, whom he accused of making statements that were equally 
as obtuse as those made by U.S. Vice-President Al Gore during his 
recent visit here. ``Any person making such announcements is impaired,'' 
Ramli said, referring to Soros. ``It is totally useless for us to 
listen to them, and it is best just to ignore it.'' Last month, Gore 
angered his Malaysian hosts at a summit of Pacific Rim leaders with 
a speech praising the ``brave people of Malaysia'' who support Anwar, 
the country's former deputy prime minister and finance minister.
