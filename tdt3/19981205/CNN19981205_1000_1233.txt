With "CNN Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven. Former notre dame head 
coach Lou Holtz is now the man at South Carolina. Friday, the 61-year-old 
Holtz announced he's leaving the broadcasting world and taking over 
as head coach of the gamecocks. He has his work cut out -- the team 
is coming off a school worst 1-10 season. There is no reason in this 
world why we can't be as good as anybody in the country. And our goal 
-- our goal is to win the national championship. Holtz replaced Brad 
Scott who's headed down the road to arch rival Clemson to join Tommy 
bowden's new staff.
