A familiar face trades the microphone for the college football sidelines. 
"CNN Headline Sports" is next. The day we started business, we had 
over 30 years experience as the world leader in satellite services 
and systems. We are the world leader in digital satellite television. 
And, the world's leading provider of private business networks. Introducing 
Hughes, a familiar name with a brand new focus. When you need the 
best in satellite and wireless communications. We make it happen. 
Now for "diskette world" travel news -- notebook computers are traveling 
lighter with built-in superdisk drives. Only the superdisk drive works 
with both regular floppies and 120-megabyte superdisk diskettes. Floppies 
everywhere are thrilled because a built-in superdisk is two drives 
in one, and other drives are on the way out. We can save a little. 
superdisk can save a lot. Together, we can save the world. Get it 
in Compaq notebooks and desktops.
