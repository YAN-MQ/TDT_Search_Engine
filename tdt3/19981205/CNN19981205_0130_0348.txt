A federal jury in Manhattan has ordered Daimler-Chrysler to pay $750,000 
to the family of a 5-year old boy killed by an air bag. Friday, jurors 
ruled the carmaker was 50% responsible for Michael crespo's death 
during a family vacation to Puerto Rico in 1995. This case is the 
first of its kind to reach trial. Daimler-Chrysler is denouncing the 
verdict. It says crespo's father drove their rented minivan the wrong 
way on a Street and hit another car head-on. It says the boy would 
have lived had his father made sure he was wearing a Seat belt.
