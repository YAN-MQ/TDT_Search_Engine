An attack on visiting American businessmen and the assassination of 
a prominent dissident here have caused fresh unease among critics 
of the government, who say they fear a campaign of violence by conservative 
forces. The same concern is being expressed by foreign diplomats, 
who said they suspect that the attacks _ carried out on a single weekend 
last month _ may have been staged with at least the tacit approval 
of conservative elements in the government. The assaults have been 
condemned in strong terms by President Mohammed Khatami, a relative 
moderate who commands broad popular support. But the conservative 
figures who still wield most power in Iran have expressed fewer regrets, 
adding to the view that the attacks may have been part of an internal 
power struggle. ``This shows that there are powerful forces in Iran 
who are not going to let their critics go unanswered,'' one Western 
envoy said. ``And this is not a softie regime.'' Since Khatami's election 
19 months ago, the conservatives who control Iran's Parliament, judiciary 
and the post of supreme leader have battled hard to block his agenda 
and to silence his allies, even arresting one of his top supporters. 
But the attacks, on the weekend of Nov. 21-22, are being seen by many 
here as marking a worrying new turn. ``These events have sent a very 
great shock through the society,'' said Abbas Shayegan, a critic of 
the government who was close to the dissident who was assassinated, 
Dariush Foruhar. ``They were well thought-out by the government with 
the intention to oppress.'' Among the reasons diplomats and others 
mentioned as cause for their suspicions of official acquiescence were 
the fact Iranian security forces were uncooperative in responding 
to reports of the Nov. 21 attack on the Americans. Their minibus was 
attacked by men wielding crowbars who had used their cars to block 
a hotel driveway as the group returned from a trip inside Iran. None 
of the 13 Americans in the delegation were hurt, but many bus windows 
were shattered in the attack, which one well-informed diplomat described 
as a ``meticulous and precise.'' An Iranian police officer ultimately 
escorted the Americans back to their hotel, but not before the group 
was left waiting for more than an hour for a police response. The 
next day, diplomats said, Iranian officials promised that security 
forces would escort the group to the airport for a flight out of the 
country. But a senior Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said that ``no visible Iranian escort'' ever arrived. An Iranian group 
calling itself the ``Devotees of Islam'' has taken responsibility 
for the attack, saying that it was intended to discourage the kinds 
of renewed private contacts between Iran and the United States advocated 
by Khatami. The assassination of Foruhar and his wife, Parveneh, who 
were stabbed to death in their Tehran home, has prompted a louder 
outcry. Foruhar, who was well-known known for his nationalist and 
secular views, was prominent among opposition leaders whose activities 
are officially banned but usually tolerated. At a funeral for the 
slain couple the week before last, thousands of mourners chanted slogans 
that included ``Down with Despotism!'' The Foruhar home was said by 
Shayegan and other activists to have been under round-the-clock surveillance 
by Iran's ministry of information, the country's intelligence service. 
They said that surveillance cameras were known to have been trained 
on entrances to the home, and that it would have been impossible for 
the assailants to enter or leave without the information ministry's 
knowledge. No one has been arrested in connection with the attack, 
and no one has taken responsibility for it. The activists said they 
feared the killings were intended as a warning to other opposition 
figures critical of the government.
