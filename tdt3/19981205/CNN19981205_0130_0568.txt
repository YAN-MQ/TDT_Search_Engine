A woman was killed at a holiday parade in Minneapolis when a police 
Van ran into the crowd. Several people were hurt, at least three seriously. 
Police say they were picking up intoxicated spectators when the Van 
lurched forward. A witness says one of the men being detained somehow 
got behind the wheel and drove into the crowd.
