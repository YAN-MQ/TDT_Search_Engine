U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan is trying to convince Libya to turn 
over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. He flew 
to Tripoli today to meet with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. 270 people 
were killed when flight 103 exploded in midair over Lockerbie, scotland. 
Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its failure to 
turn over the two men who are allegedly Libyan intelligence agents.
