Clashes broke out today between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers 
on the West Bank. About 24 people were injured. Palestinians threw 
stones at Israeli troops who responded with rubber bullets and tear 
gas. Palestinians marched to demand hundreds of prisoners jailed for 
anti-Israeli activity be released. They say it's part of the peace 
deal, but Israel says it won't implement the accord until the Palestinian 
authority accepts its criteria for the releases.
