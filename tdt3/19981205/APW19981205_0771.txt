For the second day in a row, fog forced the cancellation of the men's 
World Cup downhill race on Saturday. Organizers hope to hold the race 
at 10 a.m. (1600 GMT), meaning the super-giant slalom originally slated 
for Sunday will be rescheduled for later in the season. Snow flurries 
and fog that reduced visibility in sections of the 3,185-meter (10,440-foot) 
Dave Murray course caused the race's start time to be pushed back 
more than one hour before it was postponed. There was pressure to 
have a race at this Pacific mountain resort. The venue has been plagued 
with weather problems, forcing the cancellation of the race the last 
two years. Fog and heavy snow resulted in Wednesday's training being 
cancelled. Racers finally got their first training run on the course 
in three years Thursday. An attempt to hold the race a day early on 
Friday was scrubbed when a heavy shroud of fog covered the course. 
Officials waited 2 1-2 hours before rescheduling the race for Saturday.
