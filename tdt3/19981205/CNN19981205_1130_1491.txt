Actor Christian Slater has had some "very bad things" happen to him 
recently, including a stay in jail. But now his life appears to be 
on an upswing, and that includes a new film. Cynthia Tornquist has 
more. In "very bad things," Christian Slater plays a hard-drinking 
party animal on a collision course. I think she's dead. There are 
always options. You left a dead prostitute in the desert? But Slater 
says fans should not confuse the role with his own turbulent past. 
Slater has turned over a new leaf. I think it's really important that 
we just, in a way, stay as centered and just remember that we're not 
in charge, too. You know, that there is a bigger thing going on here. 
The 29-year-old actor says he saw the big picture after a bout with 
drugs and alcohol landed him in a California jail this past February. 
In December's "rolling stone," Slater says the drunken episode almost 
cost him his life when he tried to kill himself by jumping off a balcony. 
In the past ten years, he has also been arrested for drunken driving 
and carrying a gun onto a plane. It's really very nice to be on this 
side of the rainbow. On this side of the insanity. You know, to have 
gone through a lot of stuff myself and to have come out the other 
side, in my opinion, I think a more well-rounded human being with 
a new appreciation, a new respect and, just a new belief system about 
life. Slater's evolution seems to have carried over to his art. While 
on the set of "very bad things" -- directed by "Chicago hope" star 
peter Berg -- Slater says he made this discovery. I don't really have 
to suffer for my art. There's a part of me that felt like, you know, 
to play a dark character like this, I would have to go into that dark 
place, and the irony is, is that you don't at all. Slater also learned 
to appreciate his work. Ten years ago, when I made movies like "heathers" 
and "pump up the volume," i think there's a part of me that, in a 
way, took it for granted. Currently, Slater is taking a break from 
films to appear in the broadway play "sideman." He portrays the son 
of a jazz trumpet player. Gene, your kid has great rope, man! What 
do you say when an ex-junkie compliments your veins. Both he and the 
play have received favorable notices. Cynthia Tornquist, "CNN Entertainment 
News," New York.
