TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan failed Saturday 
to secure the handover of two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, despite what he called ``fruitful and positive'' 
talks with Moammar Gadhafi. Annan said, however, he believed an arrangement 
for trying the two suspects could be secured in ``not an inordinate'' 
amount of time. The secretary-general spoke to reporters after meeting 
the Libyan leader at an undisclosed location in the Libyan desert. 
Libyan TV showed Gadhafi, in a brown robe and cap, shaking hands with 
Annan. It was a long day of diplomacy for the 60-year-old Annan. He 
left Jerba, Tunisia, in the morning for Tripoli, held talks with Libyan 
officials in the coastal city of Sirte, then took what was said to 
be a two-hour journey to his desert meeting with Gadhafi. Annan is 
trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the 
two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands 
for the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of an airline over Lockerbie that left 
270 people dead. ``The talks have been fruitful and positive,'' Annan 
said. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and readiness to find 
a solution to the Lockerbie problem. ``Libya has also agreed to a 
trial in a third country and believes that it ought to be possible 
to find answers to all other outstanding issues,'' he said. ``It will 
require some time but not an inordinate amount.'' The meeting with 
Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news agency, JANA, reported 
Annan might not be able to meet with the leader because Gadhafi was 
``in the desert.'' JANA reported that Annan met with Libya's foreign 
minister, Omar al-Muntasser, in Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) 
east of the capital Tripoli. Earlier, Libyan media suggested Gadhafi 
had no authority to hand over the suspects _ an indication he was 
giving himself room in case he decides against giving up the two men 
wanted by the United States and Britain. JANA indicated a decision 
on handing over Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah 
would have to be approved by some 500 grassroots national committees 
before being decided by the parliament. Libyan radio reported that 
the parliament had been called to meet Tuesday in Sirte. But the report, 
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., did not say whether the 
Lockerbie issue would be discussed. Most reporters were barred from 
traveling with Annan from Tripoli to Sirte. While Libyan media gave 
few reports about the visit, ordinary Libyans were aware of the developments 
and many said they oppose handing over the suspects. ``We should never 
surrender our children no matter what the price is,'' Tripoli fisherman 
Ahmed Abdel-Salam said. Nasser Bouaicha, a shopkeeper in a bustling 
downtown market, said the men should be tried in Libya. ``We have 
judges and we have law,'' he said. Annan flew into Libya aboard a 
special plane from the Tunisian resort island of Jerba after receiving 
clearance from the U.N. Sanctions Committee. Libya has been under 
U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two suspects, 
allegedly Libyan intelligence agents. A Libyan, 15th graf pvs
