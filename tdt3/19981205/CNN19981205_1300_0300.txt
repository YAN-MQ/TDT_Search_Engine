Republicans are again focusing on shoring up social security. In the 
party's weekly radio address, representative clay Shaw praised the 
system, but he warned that it could run out of money by the time baby 
boomers retire. First of all, it must protect current and future retirees 
and especially women. Second, the plan must improve fairness across 
generations. Three, there must be a safety net for the needy and the 
disabled. And finally, there should be new options for younger workers. 
Shaw is the new chairman of the house committee that oversees social 
security.
