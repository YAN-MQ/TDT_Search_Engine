An accidental nuclear war between hostile neighbors, India and Pakistan, 
was cited Saturday as a key concern of participants at an international 
conference on peace and security in South Asia. ``Nuclear tests by 
India and Pakistan have brought a qualitative change in the relationship 
of the two countries,'' Zafar Iqbal Cheema, conference chairman and 
chairman of the Department of Defense and Strategic Studies at Quaid-i-Azam 
University told reporters. ``It is now the question of the survival 
of humanity in this region. . . Each and every citizen will be affected 
(in case of a nuclear war),'' Cheema said. India and Pakistan conducted 
tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May generating international fears of 
a nuclear confrontation in a volatile region that already has gone 
to war three times in the past 51 years. The three-day conference 
was co-sponsored by a German foundation called Hanns-Seidel Stiftung 
and the United States Embassy in Islamabad. Participants at the conference 
came from India, China, Russia, Germany and the United States as well 
as Pakistan. ``The international trend is for the reduction of nuclear 
weapons. It is unfortunate that this region is going against it,'' 
said Richard Hoagland, counselor for public affairs of the U.S. Embassy. 
Cheema said the Kashmir dispute which has caused two previous wars 
between India and Pakistan remains a flash point for a nuclear confrontation 
if it remains unresolved. Kashmir was divided between Pakistan and 
India in 1947 but both nations lay claim to a unified Kashmir. Conference 
participants agreed nuclear weapons could not be used. However they 
also appeared to accept the fact that both countries would induct 
nuclear weapons into their arsenals by suggesting both Pakistan and 
India develop effective command and control systems as well as an 
early warning system.
