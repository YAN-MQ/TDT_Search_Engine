A monument to Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin was unveiled in a northern 
Russian town Saturday, a news agency reported. The ceremony in the 
central park of Polyarnye Zori, a town in the Murmansk region, reversed 
the usual post-Soviet pattern of tearing such statues down. Mikhail 
Antropov, head of the local Communist Party, told the Interfax news 
agency that the monument would ``remind future generations of the 
great accomplishments of the leader of the world proletariat.'' Every 
town in the Soviet Union had a Lenin monument _ and usually more than 
one _ but thousands were toppled following the collapse of the Soviet 
Union in 1991. The unveiling of the new monument may be an effort 
by the Communist Party to take advantage of disgust with the current 
government and nostalgia for the relative economic stability of the 
Soviet era. Aside from the elderly, however, few Russians want to 
see a restoration of the Soviet state. In Moscow, the State Duma on 
Friday recommended the restoration of a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, 
head of the first secret police organization in the Soviet era. The 
statue loomed before the KGB headquarters in central Moscow until 
it was toppled by euphoric pro-democracy protesters in 1991.
