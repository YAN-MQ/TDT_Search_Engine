Mergers, layoffs and profit-taking are the talk of the financial world 
this week. David Daniel looks at business this week. While holiday 
shoppers massed at the malls, megacorporations were on a mission to 
merge. Germany's Deutsche bank set out to create the world's largest 
financial services company this week, deciding to buy New York-based 
bankers trust for $10.1 billion. And Exxon and mobil confirmed the 
rumors, announcing an $80 billion merger that would create the world's 
largest oil company. Analysts say the deal could lead to as many as 
12,000 job cuts. That was just part of the nearly 36,000 job cuts 
announced this week. Boeing, which had already said it would eliminate 
28,000 jobs, announced plans to slash 20,000 more. In all, the world's 
largest commercial aircraft maker is reducing its workforce by some 
20% over the next two years, as the Asian economic crisis forces it 
to cut production. The first pink slips went out this week. And Johnson 
& Johnson, amid a major sales slump, said it's eliminating 4,100 jobs, 
more than 4% of its workforce, and closing 36 factories.
