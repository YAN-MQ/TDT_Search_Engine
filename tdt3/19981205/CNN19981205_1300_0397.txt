A woman and a baby died when a police Van careened into the crowd 
at a Holiday parade in Minneapolis. Nine people were hurt. Police 
say the Van was being used to pick up intoxicated spectators when 
suddenly it lurched forward. They say they don't know why. Spectators 
say it was a terrifying moment. Screaming, hollering, everyone trying 
to get out of the way. It was like somebody had just -- like somebody 
had just thrown a stick of dynamite over there in that corner, and 
everybody was just tearing across this street. Not -- I mean it was 
like -- it looked like a couple thousand people running across the 
street. The Minnesota state patrol is investigating the incident.
