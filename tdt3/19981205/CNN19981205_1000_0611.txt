What is believed to be the last active band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas 
has surrendered in Cambodia. The guerrillas met Friday with representatives 
of the Cambodian government and agreed to defect and join the government 
army. Several hundred soldiers and their families had been holed up 
near the border of Thailand. The Khmer Rouge is held responsible for 
the deaths of nearly 2 million cambodians in the 1970s. The top three 
surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge remain at large.
