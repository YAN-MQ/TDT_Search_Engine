Winter is not far away, but you wouldn't know it in much of the United 
States. New York City hit 73 degrees Friday, an all-time high for 
a December day there. Washington, D.C., also set a record, hitting 
76 degrees. Much of the northeast and midwest was basking in the warmth. 
Boston was 25 degrees above normal, reaching the upper 60s.
