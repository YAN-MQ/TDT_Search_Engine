So, a guy walks into a party with a lizard on his chest .... True 
story. Happened Friday night. There was also a man with a Belgian 
shepherd that stretched nearly 5 feet long, and a woman with a pooch 
in a pocketbook, and two ladies with cats. Welcome to the first singles 
mixer for vegans and their pets, um, ``animal companions.'' Wouldn't 
want to imply any kind of hierarchy among the species. ``My friend 
always told me walking his dog was a good way to pick up girls,'' 
said Dave Fazzino, sitting two seats away from William Mejia, owner 
_ um, companion _ of Krishna, a type of lizard known as a northern 
blue-tongued skink. ``Taking that thing around must be great.'' Mejia, 
who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, has been collecting snakes, lizards 
and other reptiles since he was about 13. Right now he has two: Krishna, 
an 18-inch creeper with a back that feels, well, like a handbag and 
an amazing tongue that is almost flirtatious as it darts in and out, 
and Radha, another skink. ``I've never had a girl not want to date 
me because of my reptiles,'' Mejia said. ``They'll usually start with 
`Can I touch it?' Then they want to hold it.'' Krishna definitely 
drew the women Friday night at the Veggie Singles party, held at the 
Source of Life Center on 34th Street, just west of Fifth Avenue. That 
is partly because people outnumbered pets by about 10 to 1. It's not 
that the partygoers didn't have pets. These are hard-core animal lovers, 
folks who go beyond mere meat avoidance to shun all animal products. 
No cheese, no eggs, no honey. Most, like Jean Thaler, do it for ethical 
reasons. Ms. Thaler, a bank examiner, carried a purse that sported 
a pin saying ``Fur'' with a red line through it. Arthur Goldberg, 
the founder of Veggie Singles, wore an orange button that said, ``Vegetarians 
Make Better Lovers.'' Goldberg, 56, a Brooklyn resident, landed on 
the dating market in the early 1990s after living with a woman _ and 
their three dogs and 13 cats _ for more than 23 years. He answered 
personal advertisements, but was in a quandary when the women ordered 
burgers: He did not want to pick up the tab, or even pay the tax and 
tip, for food whose consumption he considered immoral. So in 1994, 
Goldberg started a magazine called Veggie Singles News, which now 
has 1,400 paid subscribers and distributes free copies nationwide 
to thousands of other readers who page through articles and advertisements 
intended to help ``vegetarian singles meet and eat,'' as the magazine's 
motto puts it. Last year he started organizing events _ a beach trip, 
a picnic, a massage party. ``Generally, I can tell if a woman is falling 
in love with me, when she starts becoming a vegetarian,'' Goldberg 
said when asked about the importance of shared eating habits to long-term 
relationships. ``Then, if things take a turn for the worse, I can 
tell, because she starts ordering steak.'' Inviting the animals was 
a logical next step for the group. Members bought two huge bags of 
vegan pet food and rented three rooms on the fifth floor in the Source 
of Life Center. One for the cats, with a litter box. One for the dogs, 
with a blue tarpaulin spread on the floor. The one with a carpet, 
where the buffet of Chinese food with faux meat was laid, was reserved 
for Homo sapiens. ``You are urged to exercise appropriate caution,'' 
urged signs posted in the hallways, ``as we are generally not familiar 
with the history or temperament of most of the animals (or people) 
attending this event.'' But the animal rooms were mostly empty as 
people chatted _ often about their dietary habits _ and exchanged 
phone numbers. The cats, Candy and Christina, and their owners became 
a bit lonely when everyone else gathered elsewhere for a tarot card 
reading (Actually, Candy was too shy to even come out of the bag that 
her owner, Monica Jenkins, brought her in.) Most people had left their 
pets at home, not wanting to schlep them on the subway or frighten 
them with too many strangers. Mejia can handle only one skink at a 
time in public; he alternates between Krishna and Radha so the one 
left at home does not get jealous, he said. ``My feeling is not to 
do something that's not fun for him,'' Ms. Thaler, 37, said to explain 
why she left Bobby, her cockatiel, at home in his cage and brought 
a Beanie Baby bird to the party as a surrogate. ``Whenever I take 
him out of his cage, he thinks he's going to the doctor. He gets very 
upset.''
