An unruly passenger died aboard a Malev Hungarian airliner on Saturday 
after being strapped to his seat and injected with tranquilizers. 
The passenger, identified by Turkey's Anatolia news agency as Finnish 
national Mikaeinar Peterson, was dead by the time the jet made an 
emergency landing in Istanbul. Anatolia and Hungary's MTI news agency 
said the man started harassing others aboard a flight from Bangkok 
to Budapest. He allegedly punched a pilot and tried to choke an attendant. 
The crew and passengers tied him to his seat and a doctor aboard gave 
him an injection. An autopsy done later in the day showed he died 
because of the mixture of the tranquilizer and some other drug or 
alcohol. Witnesses saw the man take a pill before he became violent 
and authorities suspected he was drunk, Anatolia said. Police detained 
two pilots, four attendants and five passengers along with the doctor 
and his father. A new crew from Hungary flew the jet to Budapest with 
its remaining 183 passengers.
