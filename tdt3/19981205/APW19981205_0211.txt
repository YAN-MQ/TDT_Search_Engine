A Philippine Airlines jet struck turbulence Saturday, injuring at 
least 11 passengers when it suddenly plunged 1,000 feet (300 meters), 
airline officials said. After the plane landed in Manila, one passenger 
emerged wearing a neck brace and was rushed to the hospital with a 
suspected fracture in the upper body, the airline said in a statement. 
The other passengers of Flight PR502 suffered bruises, cuts and burns 
from hot coffee or tea being served at the time. The PAL Airbus 330-300, 
carrying 259 passengers, was cruising at 37,000 feet (11,212 meters) 
when it hit turbulence about 11:15 a.m. (0315 GMT), two hours after 
departing from Singapore, the airline said. Helen Tecson Gamboa told 
reporters she was preparing to eat her dessert when the plane shook. 
``I saw my friend tossed into the air and hit the ceiling. The plates 
were flying. The food trolley also was tossed in the air and hurt 
some people when it came down,'' she said. ``I just closed my eyes 
and stayed in my seat and prayed.'' The airline said officials from 
the Air Transport Office have been called to inspect the plane.
