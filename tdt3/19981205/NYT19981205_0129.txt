The exceptionally warm weather pattern that has led to all-time maximum 
temperature records for December in many spots from the Middle West 
to the Northeast during the past week will end Sunday and Monday. 
Sunday will be another very mild day in most areas east of the Mississippi 
River. Near-record temperatures will be common from the eastern Ohio 
Valley to the Middle Atlantic States, where intervals of sun will 
prevail. Farther north, mostly cloudy skies and areas of morning fog 
will occur from northern Pennsylvania to northern New England. Winds 
from the Atlantic will keep eastern New England cool with patchy drizzle. 
Showers will accompany a cold front as it moves east from the Mississippi 
Valley. Ahead of the front, mild and moist breezes from the south 
will prevail. Chilly breezes from the north will follow the front 
forcing temperatures down toward seasonal levels in much of the Plains 
and northern Mississippi Valley. Low pressure streaking north along 
the front will produce a band of cold rain from the central Mississippi 
Valley to the western Great Lakes. Some snow will fall as the precipitation 
gradually ends from eastern Kansas to the northern Great Lakes. Most 
of the West will be cold. Onshore winds will promote coastal showers 
and mountain snow in the Pacific Northwest. A jet stream disturbance 
will bring scattered lowland showers and mountain snow to the deserts 
of the Southwest. Patchy snow and cold breezes will linger in much 
of the interior west, especially along west-facing slopes. FOCUS: 
WINTER'S HERE Despite the unprecedented warmth of recent days from 
the Plains to the Eastern states, meteorologists would say that winter 
has begun. The event that will occur Dec. 21 is the start of astronomical 
winter, when the direct rays of the sun shine on the Tropic of Capricorn, 
at latitude 23.5 degrees south of the equator. For the purposes of 
official climate records, winter began Dec. 1 and will end Feb. 28. 
In most of the northern states, by another unofficial measurement, 
winter began Saturday, which is the climatological start of coldest 
90-day period of the year.
