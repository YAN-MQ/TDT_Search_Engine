Dr. Peter Diamandopoulos, who was forced out as president of Adelphi 
University last year over issues of excessive compensation and mismanagement, 
has been hired as a special assistant to the president of Boston University. 
The move reunites Diamandopoulos with his mentor, Dr. John Silber, 
the chancellor of Boston University. The two were friendly competitors 
for the rank as the nation's highest-paid college or university chief, 
although Boston University's enrollment of 30,000 is several times 
as big as Adelphi's, which is 4,275. Silber served on Adelphi's Board 
of Trustees until the board was removed from office by the New York 
State Board of Regents last year for failing to properly oversee Diamandopoulos 
and the university. A new board appointed by the regents then terminated 
Diamandopoulos' contract as president. At the formal hearings leading 
up to the regents' decision, Silber was a staunch defender of Diamandopoulos, 
his compensation and his policies. Diamandopoulos' new appointment 
was first reported by the student newspaper at Boston University. 
A university spokesman, Colin Riley, said Saturday that Diamandopoulos 
would serve as a special assistant to President Jon Westling, handling 
special projects in development, international education and educational 
policy. Diamandopoulos' new salary was not disclosed. At Adelphi, 
Diamandopoulos was criticized for not raising much endowment money 
and resorting instead to large tuition increases, which helped cause 
the enrollment to plunge 62 percent during his 12 years as president. 
He did promote foreign student programs, especially in his native 
Greece. His education policies often caused conflict with the faculty, 
but he was credited with creating Adelphi's honors college, which 
has continued after his departure. To settle a tangle of litigation 
in the aftermath of Diamandopoulos' removal from Adelphi, he, Silber 
and the other former trustees agreed to repay Adelphi more than $1 
million for some of the excessive compensation and legal fees. In 
addition, Diamandopoulos had to return $740,000, although he was granted 
a partial settlement for the cancellation of his five-year contract.
