James Hoffa is closer to following in his father's footsteps as president 
of the teamster's union. His main challenger Tom leedham has conceded 
defeat in the union election. Monitors are still counting ballots 
from the western and central regions of the country. In ballots from 
the south and east, Hoffa has 55% of the votes to leedham's 39%. Hoffa's 
father Jimmy became the president of the teamsters in 1957 and held 
the office for a decade.
