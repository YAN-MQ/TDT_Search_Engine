Some health maintenance organizations have been dropping senior citizens 
who receive Medicare. That's left many seniors who have health problems 
scrambling to find new coverage. And as Deborah feyerick reports, 
some are having a tough time. HMOs promised their customers better 
health coverage at lower prices. Doctors visits, prescriptions and 
hospitalizations would be all but paid for. At least that's what Allen 
Martin says he was promised by Oxford when he and his wife philomena 
switched their Medicare over to managed care three years ago. We were 
elated that there was no money involved and we would have the coverage 
that we wanted. That's about to end. Martin, his wife and about 440,000 
other seniors on Medicare got letters telling them they are being 
dropped by their HMOs January 1st. Mrs. Martin, who's healthy, was 
able to find a new HMO without any problem. Mr. Martin wasn't. His 
kidneys don't work and he needs dialysis three times a week to flush 
his body. That's expensive. And he finds himself scrambling to find 
new coverage. What's the health plan for? You're sick, you need their 
help and they say we can't take you on? It's pre-existing. There are 
roughly 350 managed care plans covering government-insured seniors 
with others trying to break in. But 65 are pulling out. HMOs maintain 
they are a business. And they say, without more payments from Congress, 
they can't stay afloat. Payments are limited to a certain amount. 
Meanwhile, health care inflation has risen more than double those 
amounts. Several years ago, HMOs aggressively targeted people covered 
by medicare. 6.5 million signed up. But critics, like author Jeanne 
kassler, say HMOs didn't make as much money as expected. They discovered 
after enrolling them that if the government -- the federal government 
-- cut subsidies, the profit margins couldn't stay high. The martins 
now have two choices -- return to Medicare and pay more direct costs 
or buy additional insurance. Both options will cost them thousands 
of extra dollars, no choice at all for people on a fixed income. I 
will have to go to work, I guess. One HMO expert warns, if Congress 
does not address the larger health care problem, what happened to 
seniors like the martins may be just the tip of the iceberg. Deborah 
feyerick, for CNN, New York.
