Canada's Jonathan Power became North America's first world squash 
champion Saturday, rallying from a first-game loss to beat Scotland's 
top-ranked Peter Nicol 15-17, 15-7, 15-9, 15-10 and win the 175,000 
World Open. The 24-year-old from Toronto fought off three game points 
in the opener before finally succumbing. But Nicol noticeably began 
to tire during the second game and Power took charge before eventually 
prevailing in 72 minutes. Power beat Nicol in last year's Qatar International 
final on the all-glass court in Doha. ``I always thought I had a good 
chance. If you play well, you win, and I played well tonight,'' he 
said. ``I guess this was just one tournament too many,'' Nicol said. 
``Jonathan played a fantastic game.''
