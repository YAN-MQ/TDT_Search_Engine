A recent confrontation in Manhattan over a tip at a steak house has 
led to a $7 million lawsuit. A lawyer treated 18 of his colleagues 
to dinner, and the Bill came to $2,500. The tab included an automatic 
tip of $353. The lawyer, unhappy with the service, crossed that out 
and gave the waitress $100 in cash instead. The owner and several 
employees refused to let him leave and called the police. Now the 
lawyer is suing for false imprisonment.
