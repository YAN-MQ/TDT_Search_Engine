Police arrested about 400 people after a ship packed with some 600 
illegal immigrants, mostly Kurds, ran aground off this coastal city 
on Saturday, an official said. Most of the 400 people arrested were 
women or children who disembarked after the Sirinbahce, which was 
on its way to Italy, ran aground in strong winds, Gov. Ekrem Ozsoy 
said. Most of the passengers swam to the shore, while others used 
lifeboats. Authorities were searching for the crew and the rest of 
the immigrants, including some Afghans, Iraqi Kurds and Africans, 
said the governor. No casualties were reported. The exact number of 
people on board hadn't been counted yet, according to news reports. 
The cargo ship originated from Istanbul. The Anatolia news agency 
said the immigrants told police they had paid some dlrs 3,000 apiece 
for the sea voyage, a chance to slip into Italy, then work their way 
up to Germany and other European countries in search of work. Italy 
has become a gateway for illegal immigrants because of its porous 
southern coast and relatively lax immigration laws. Most of the Kurdish 
migrants are Turks leaving southeastern Turkey, where the government's 
14-year war with Kurdish guerrillas has ravaged the economy, emptied 
scores of villages and killed some 37,000 people. While most seek 
work, the guerrilla group Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, is suspected 
of orchestrating the smuggle of the Kurds into Europe to expand its 
network.
