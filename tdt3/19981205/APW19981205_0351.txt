An international donors' conference meant to bankroll Croatian reconstruction 
ended Saturday with commitments of only about dlrs 25 million _ approximately 
10 percent of the target. Government officials were disappointed. 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic expressed regrets that there was not 
``more significant support from the international community.'' Almost 
50 countries and 27 organizations took part in the two-day event designed 
to finance reconstruction of war-damaged regions and revive the stagnating 
economy. The pledges fell far short of the estimated dlrs 2.5 billion 
needed to cover the fundamental costs of reconstruction. Most benefactors 
pledged to continue aid programs already in place through the European 
Community and other institutions rather than directly earmark new 
funds for housing, infrastructure or mine-clearance. Some of the reluctance 
appeared tied to the perception that Croatia continues to discriminate 
against its ethnic Serb minority. The government earlier this week 
agreed to rescind legislation criticized as discriminatory towards 
minority Serbs in their attempts to reclaim homes and get state financial 
and other help. Croatia's Serbs rebelled and took control of a third 
of the country in 1991, but were defeated by the Croatian army in 
1995. Hundreds of thousands of civilians were left homeless, and more 
than 170,000 dwellings were destroyed, along with other property. 
The government has already rebuilt about half the homes destroyed 
in the war but says it needs a further dlrs 1.2 billion to complete 
the project. Another dlrs 1.3 billion are required to repair roads 
and bridges and restore power, water and telecommunication networks, 
according to Jure Radic, the minister of reconstruction. More than 
10 percent of the country remains littered with mines and other explosive 
ordinance. The cost of removal is estimated at some dlrs 2.6 billion. 
The United States and the World Bank are Croatia's most important 
aid sources. Between them, they account for up to dlrs 350 million 
a year in donations and loans.
