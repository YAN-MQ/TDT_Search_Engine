Good evening. It looked far worse than it was. The football game between 
two rivals, army and Navy came to a sudden stop today after a railing 
collapsed, sending nine people to the ground. The game was suspended 
while people were treated and ambulances rushed to the scene. More 
from Rick Davis. Army had just scored a go-ahead touchdown after being 
behind for much of the game. Jubilant cadets and students from an 
affiliated prep school leaned over a Section of the stands, shouting, 
cheering -- and then the railing collapsed. Nine fell 15 feet to the 
Turf below the stands. The cheering for a hard-fought game stopped. 
Cadets from west point, the naval academy, family and friends stood 
in silence. Players waited, the thrill of the game faded during the 
long delay. The only action on the field, the ambulances carrying 
the injured away from philadelphia's veterans stadium. One cadet described 
the railing that broke under pressure. The thing itself was taped 
before we even got here, so I think it had been taped up previously. 
You said it was duct taped? yes, ma'am. They were trying to get to 
a camera person filming from underneath. My prayers are with the kids 
who were hurt and with their families. I hope for the best for them. 
Cadets rushed to three area hospitals, where four male and one female 
were taken. They're upset that some of their classmates have been 
hurt possibly, and it comes at a very difficult time. One cadet is 
in guarded condition with possible head and neck injuries. Others 
are reported in stable condition. Rick Davis, NBC news.
