Former senator Bill Bradley is considering a run for the White House. 
The New Jersey democrat who chose not to seek re-election in 1996 
has formed a committee to explore his chances of winning his party's 
nomination in 2000. The Rhodes scholar and former basketball star 
called vice President Gore to tell him about the decision. A Gore 
aide says the vice president respects Bradley and is not surprised 
by the announcement.
