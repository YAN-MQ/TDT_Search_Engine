Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee Saturday denounced attacks 
on the minority Christian community that religious leaders say have 
increased since a Hindu nationalist-led government took over eight 
months ago. ``There have been some condemnable acts in recent months 
by antisocial elements,'' Vajpayee said in a statement. The prime 
minister was reacting to a peaceful protest march to parliament by 
thousands of Christians Friday, when community leaders alleged that 
those involved in the attacks are members of right-wing affiliates 
of his Bharatiya Janata Party. ``Neither the government nor my party, 
the BJP, has anything to do with the perpetrators of these acts,'' 
Vajpayee said in a statement. ``I strongly denounce them.'' Since 
the Hindu nationalist BJP took power as head of a 19-party governing 
coalition earlier this year, it has been accused of fanning religious 
tension. ``India is a secular nation. Equal respect for all faiths 
has been the cornerstone of our culture and our nationhood,'' the 
statement said. ``My government reassures all our Christian brethren 
that they are as valued citizens of the country as everybody else,'' 
it added. Christians make up about 2 percent of India's nearly 1 billion 
people. The United Christian Forum for Human Rights, a group of lay 
Christians who helped organize Friday's rally, said it had compiled 
a list of almost 90 incidents of violence against Christians since 
January. It said the figure was more than the total for the first 
50 years of Indian independence in 1947. Among the most serious of 
the attacks was the Sept. 24 rape of four nuns by armed men in a village 
convent in central India, in which seven people were arrested. Community 
leaders welcomed the prime minister's statement. ``Your words are 
very encouraging and we assure you of our prayers so that God may 
help you in your great work for the good of our nation,'' the Rev. 
Alan de Lastic, Archbishop of Delhi, said in a statement.
