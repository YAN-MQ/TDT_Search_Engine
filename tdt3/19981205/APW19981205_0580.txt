Stone-throwing clashes erupted in the West Bank on Saturday as Palestinians 
marched to demand the release of hundreds of prisoners jailed for 
anti-Israeli activity. About two dozen people were injured and seven 
protesters were arrested. On the outskirts of the West Bank towns 
of Bethlehem, Ramallah and Nablus, scores of Palestinian youths threw 
rocks at Israeli troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear 
gas. The fighting went on for several hours before protesters dispersed. 
Israeli paramilitary police also fired tear gas to disperse dozens 
of stone-throwers in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Police said 
seven Palestinians, mostly minors, were arrested. Dozens of Palestinians 
also protested outside of the West Bank settlement of Ariel and tried 
to set fire to an electricity pole. Others threw stones towards homes 
on the settlement and Israeli forces on the site. Israeli soldiers 
fired rubber bullets and tear gas onto the crowd but there were no 
injuries, the army said. An army officer and two soldiers were injured 
very lightly in the Ramallah and Bethlehem clashes, the army said.
