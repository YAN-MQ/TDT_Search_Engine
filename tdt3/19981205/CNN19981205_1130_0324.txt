The new chairman of the house panel on social security says, both 
parties need to work together to save the system. In the GOP's weekly 
radio address, representative clay Shaw of Florida called social security 
one of the best things about America. But he says it's headed for 
a crisis when the baby boom generation retires. He's calling on President 
Clinton to provide leadership on the issue. Whether the president 
convenes this historic White House summit, we are hopeful he will 
present to us and the nation a specific plan on how best to strengthen 
social security. That's how social security reform always began in 
the past. And we agree with the president, that we should save social 
security first. President Clinton will meet Tuesday with Shaw and 
other members of Congress to discuss ways to strengthen the system.
