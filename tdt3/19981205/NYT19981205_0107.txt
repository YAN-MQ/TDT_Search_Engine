Just before 6 p.m. in the 23rd Street subway station, an F train was 
on the track, waiting, and Anthony Williams was perched on a station 
bench, watching. The train was heading to Queens. So was Williams. 
Five, six, eight minutes, and the train did not move. Neither did 
he. ``I'm just getting off of work, I got new shoes, my feet hurt,'' 
said Williams, 24, a computer technician. ``I'm waiting for the next 
train. It will probably be as crowded as this one.'' Ah, the subways. 
The trains are too packed, too slow, too few. The seats, made in Japan, 
are too small for American behinds. The platforms are dangerously 
narrow, the stations horribly dank, the announcements unintelligible. 
Bathrooms are rare, rats common. While New York politicians are bragging 
about the city's friendlier image and the transit system is bustling 
with half a million new riders a day, the familiar chorus of complaints 
continues from underground. But with the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority projecting a $379 million surplus and politicians from Gov. 
George Pataki on down promising improved service, straphangers are 
brimming with ideas about how to spend the money. Longtime New Yorkers 
remember far worse days, of stations reeking of urine and slathered 
in graffiti, yet the crush of new riders spawned by the Metrocard 
has strained the transit system, a victim of its own success. Hints 
of improvements only serve to spike expectations: Can't a city that 
chopped its murder rate by more than half make the express trains 
stay in the station long enough for people from the locals to scurry 
across? Officials of New York City Transit, a unit of the MTA, released 
a broad budget outline last week promising to increase bus and train 
service by 4.6 percent on weekdays, and add 6.2 percent more bus trips 
and 3.2 percent more train trips on weekends. They also plan more 
cleaning crews, expanded station-painting programs, clearer-sounding 
bus speakers and $57 million for maintenance investments. The final 
decision on what to do with the surplus will be made by MTA board 
members in meetings on Wednesday and on Dec. 19, but here's a riders' 
wish list for the windfall based on conversations with more than 40 
passengers on buses and trains in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and 
the Bronx. Hire more people to clean the stations. Speed up makeovers 
like the one that has left Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn with bright 
lights and shiny tiles instead of the pockmarked cement floors and 
paint-cracked ceilings of most other stops. A fare cut would be nice. 
People want more frequent service on Sundays so that, for example, 
it would not take Lisa Osorio two hours to travel from her home in 
the Park Slope section of Brooklyn to Abyssinian Baptist Church in 
Harlem. And why not put benches at the bus stops? How about subway 
cars whose brakes won't screech, or electronic bulletin boards like 
the ones in the London Underground that give minute-by-minute updates 
about the next train's arrival? Can't they automate announcements 
about transfers, or even hire some celebrities to do them, as was 
done for the seat-belt announcements in cabs? But the top priority 
by far is just for more of the same: Won't they please, please add 
trains to the F line, the Queens express, the 4, 5, 6, the Seventh 
Avenue line, or whichever one a rider happens to be waiting for at 
that very minute? ``It just gets too close, it's like sardines packed 
in a can,'' said Jon Elson as he let a stuffed No. 3 train pass him 
by at 72nd and Broadway during the Thursday morning rush. Several 
riders praised the service, noting how far it had come. The subway 
is remarkably quick, especially when compared with the clogged streets 
overhead, they said. Safety is no longer a major concern, and at least 
renovations are under way. The stations are clearly cleaner than they 
were, and at least there are some announcements now. ``I just notice 
a friendlier atmosphere,'' said Les Marshack, 57, who was heading 
downtown on the B train one afternoon. ``It's subtle, but it's there.'' 
Don't tell Elizabeth Block that the system is polite. Sitting on the 
end of a Wall Street-bound express train from her home in Brooklyn 
on Thursday, Ms. Block, an assistant attorney general, cursed as she 
watched yet another door close with a potential passenger one step 
shy of getting on board. ``There is no excuse for that,'' Ms. Block 
said. ``That goes to the whole attitude thing. They still don't care. 
I don't know if that can be improved with money.'' Above ground, critics 
are just as loud. Buses have suffered from even greater increases 
in riders, and the system is groaning. ``It takes an awful long time 
to get anywhere,'' said Dana Sherman, 40, as she waited for the M-101 
to take her from Lexington Avenue and 57th Street to her home in the 
East Village. Stella Shapiro, 82, has been riding New York buses for 
seven decades. Nowadays, it can take two hours to go from 34th Street 
to Washington Heights on the M-98. ``Recently, they've been terribly 
crowded and running late,'' she said. ``They need to get out more 
often and get them to run on time.'' Transit officials acknowledge 
that the system has not yet adapted to the huge influx of new riders, 
an estimated increase of about 30 percent on buses and 8 percent on 
subways since July 1996. They admit that more people means more trash, 
but say the renovations and better litter pickups are at least a beginning. 
``I think the system is doing real well compared to the way it used 
to be,'' said Larry Feldman, a school administrator from Fresh Meadows, 
Queens, who collects Lionel electric trains and takes a special interest 
in all things transit. ``It's much cleaner.'' Sure it's cleaner. As 
long as you don't look up at the paint practically falling off the 
low-hanging ceilings, with exposed pipes that suddenly seem rather 
close to your head. Or down, at the dingy brown concrete slabs encrusted 
with black blobs, remnants of ancient chewing gum. Or at the tiled 
walls _ were they once white? _ that look like the world's largest 
dentures badly stained with coffee. At Grand Army Plaza, the cleanest 
spot on a two-day subway tour, a uniformed worker sweeps even though 
there seems to be no trash. Two stops away at Atlantic Avenue, a frightening 
station where the renovations have not dawned, litter has a far longer 
shelf-life. Even the newest subway cars are a mess, nearly every window 
scratched up with obscure messages whose meanings are unclear: TWBT, 
ZOL4, BAAL (it is almost a relief to see SLACK and RATZON on a Q train, 
a sign, at least, of some attempt at communication). ``We've got the 
worst-looking subways of anywhere I've ever been,'' said Max Phillips, 
an East Village novelist riding the No. 6 who has been to _ among 
other places _ Chicago, Toronto and Vienna. ``New York subways are 
the only place I've ever had to wait on line to use a staircase.'' 
On the uptown side of the station at 79th Street and Broadway on the 
Nos. 1 and 9 is a trash pile notorious for breeding rats. Nine bags 
of garbage and four worn couch pillows sat next to the trash bin on 
Wednesday morning. ``If I'm waiting for more than five minutes, there's 
no way I won't see rats,'' said Frank Selvaggi, an accountant getting 
on the downtown No. 1 immediately across from the trash bin. ``The 
other day I was standing here, one came up from the tracks _ where 
it says `Do not enter across tracks' _ and it started walking down 
the platform. ``Mice, I can deal with,'' he said, ``but rats _ no 
way.'' Rodents may be an intractable problem in a system that snakes 
underground and on elevated tracks for 656 miles, and is tramped through 
each day by 4 million people and all their attendant sandwiches, candy 
bars and doughnuts. But what about the noise? To Alexander Krulic, 
who lives on the Upper East Side and rides the Nos. 4 and 5 or the 
N and R, the rattling of the rails is like poetry, but the sound of 
stopping is ``truly damaging.'' And why can't they make announcements 
people can understand? Josh Klein, a computer network manager who 
lives in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, and takes the F train to work 
near Rockefeller Center, said the lack of communication is particularly 
frustrating during delays. With a little information, people could 
plan alternate routes, he said. ``It's a two-way street,'' he said. 
``But the people running the system think of it as a one-way street.'' 
Yvonne Freeman's complaint is simple: The supply isn't keeping up 
with the demand. ``There seems to be no ventilation; it's a sweatbox,'' 
Ms. Freeman, who lives in the Bronx, said as she stopped in the Times 
Square station to finish a ``great passage'' in her Bible before heading 
to work. ``I like the Metrocard, that's great. But the conditions 
have to improve for the people. Otherwise, you'll have a mob scene 
here.'' All those people, and no bathrooms. They closed them years 
ago, transit officials said. ``Where's the nearest restroom?'' an 
anxious 30-something with a leather backpack asked the proprietor 
of a flower shop in the Times Square station on Thursday. ``There 
is none,'' the vendor replied. The traveler, confused by the heavily 
accented response, thought he had been misunderstood. ``REST-ROOM,'' 
he repeated loudly and slowly. ``I need to use one.'' George Patouhas, 
who has run the flower stand since 1976, hates the question. When 
he tells people there are no restrooms available to the public, they 
ask him, pointedly, where he goes to relieve himself. Sometimes they 
ask other things _ like whether they can use the plastic barrels his 
flowers sit in as their own personal toilets. ``I have a key, but 
I can't give the key to them,'' Patouhas explained. ``It's not my 
property. The police say if anything happens, I'm responsible. I have 
a heart up here. I feel badly. Might as well tell them no bathrooms, 
case closed.'' It is, after all, like so many things New York, just 
a matter of adjustment. So it's a little dirty, a little smelly, a 
little slow _ even very slow. Look at where it can take you. ``Going 
home like this,'' Feldman said as he sucked in his stomach to make 
room for fellow straphangers, ``it's just part of living life in New 
York City.'' But as long as they have $379 million lying around ... 
``Give it back,'' suggested Doug Ulderg, who commutes from Long Island 
to Canal Street and Avenue of the Americas. ``Cut the fares.''
