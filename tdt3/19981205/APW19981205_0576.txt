The priest accused of beating to death a Catholic bishop has been 
hospitalized with an ulcer, pneumonia and stress. The Rev. Mario Najera 
Orantes was taken to the private Old City hospital under heavy guard 
Saturday. An appellate court approved his transfer from prison. Orantes' 
lawyer, Jose Toledo Paz, said the priest had an ulcer in the duodenum, 
the first portion of the small intestine, and bronchial pneumonia. 
Authorities accuse Orantes of bludgeoning Bishop Juan Gerardi in the 
garage of the San Sebastian Church parish house on April 26. Two days 
before his death, the 75-year-old bishop presented a report charging 
that the Guatemalan military and pro-military death squads were responsible 
for most of the atrocities committed during the country's civil war, 
which ended in 1996. Public suspicion initially fell on soldiers or 
death squad members and church leaders were shocked when police arrested 
Orantes. Investigators exhumed Gerardi's body on Sept. 17 and presented 
a report to Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina, who has yet to decide whether 
to start judicial proceedings against Orantes. Police seized Orantes' 
German shepherd, which Spanish investigators have suggested may have 
been responsible for what seem to be bite marks on Gerardi's body. 
This week, the prosecutor investigating the case announced his resignation, 
but gave no specific reason. The church's Human Rights Office of the 
Archbishop had called on Otto Ardon Medina to step down, accusing 
him of wrongly accusing Orantes. Ardon's replacement has not been 
named. It is the second time Orantes has been hospitalized since his 
July 22 arrest. He was rushed to an emergency room with respiratory 
problems on July 29.
