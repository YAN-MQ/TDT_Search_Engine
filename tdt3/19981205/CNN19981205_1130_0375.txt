It's beginning to look like another member of the Hoffa family could 
become president of the teamsters union. With all the votes now counted 
from the eastern and southern regions of the country, James P. Hoffa 
has taken the lead with 55% of the vote. He's the son of legendary 
teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa who disappeared in 1975. The federal government 
is supervising this election as part of a 1989 deal aimed at getting 
rid of mob influence. Election officials hope to finish counting ballots 
by Monday.
