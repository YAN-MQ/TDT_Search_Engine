Attorney has until Monday to decide whether to appoint an independent 
counsel to investigate President Clinton's 1996 fund-raising campaign. 
So far, she has not made a decision, but sources say her advisers 
are strongly recommending against it. Sources say the advisers are 
telling Reno there is clear evidence president clinton did not have

into the matter ends monday. Reno can ask a court for a 60-day extension.
