He can be quiet, cryptic, even difficult to hear during a negotiation. 
He grasps minute details, sees the long-term value of a deal before 
others, prefers listening to talking and does not mind waiting to 
get his way. He lets others fulminate on his behalf while he maintains 
his gentlemanly demeanor. Whether Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision 
Systems and pursuer of George Steinbrenner's Yankees, is ruthless 
or relentless, scrupulously upright or deeply inscrutable, depends 
on to whom you speak. ``Don't mistake gentlemanliness for being an 
easy negotiator or not being tough as nails when he has to be,'' said 
Tom Rogers, the president of NBC Cable, who has negotiated with and 
against Dolan. ``Sometimes, the mistake people make with Chuck is 
they don't know how to deal with how creative he is. He is not linear. 
That baffles people who mistake it for him being too tough or grabbing 
too much.'' The 72-year-old Dolan, who was born in Cleveland and lives 
on Long Island in Oyster Bay with his wife, Helen, founded Cablevision 
in 1973 and took it public 13 years later. Despite its size, it remains 
a business controlled by family. Dolan's youngest son, James, is the 
chief executive officer, ``the ultimate realist, who brings a sense 
of the operational necessities that a negotiation has to keep in mind,'' 
said Rogers. Two other sons, Patrick and Thomas, are senior vice presidents 
and Kathleen, one of the three Dolan daughters, runs the family foundation. 
Despite the expanding ubiquity of the company _ it serves 3.4 million 
cable customers, owns The Wiz electronic retail chain, operates Radio 
City Music Hall and recently acquired 76 movie theaters _ Dolan remains 
an enigma to the sports market that he dominates through Cablevision's 
ownership of Madison Square Garden, which includes the Knicks and 
Rangers, and the cable TV rights to seven local teams. He wants to 
take further command of the market by buying the Yankees, a deal that 
collapsed nearly two weeks ago but is not dead. Charles Dolan usually 
gets what he wants. His dealmaking has made the Woodbury-based Cablevision 
a $2 billion company and has transformed it from its roots in cable 
television systems to an entertainment conglomerate. ``He won't be 
panicked into doing a deal,'' said Marc Lustgarten, a vice chairman 
of Cablevision who is sometimes referred to by rival negotiators as 
a bad cop to Dolan's courteous good cop. ``He won't do a deal if he 
doesn't want to. But he'll be tenacious in trying to find common ground.'' 
Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports who from 1986 to 1988 
served on the board that ran Cablevision's Sportschannel cable networks, 
said: ``You don't always know where he's going. Sometimes I'd talk 
to Chuck, then have to call Lustgarten and ask, `What did he mean?''' 
Dolan's pursuit of the Yankees has been tenacious because, by buying 
the team, he would secure its cable rights in perpetuity. The Dolan-Steinbrenner 
pas de deux is riveting because each man has what the other wants: 
Dolan wants the Yankees, Steinbrenner wants his cash. But if a deal 
to sell all or part of the team to Cablevision does not occur _ or 
if talks do not resume before the Yankees' 12-year, $486 million deal 
with the MSG Network ends in 2000 _ Steinbrenner could shop his TV 
deal, at least, to Time Warner or ESPN, which has mulled the launch 
of a local sports service. Time Warner's New York City cable system 
could conceivably carry Yankee games, but the company has spurned 
past overtures from Steinbrenner's emissaries because it refuses to 
enter a bidding war with Cablevision over Yankee rights that would 
push local cable rates skyward. But Time Warner could not buy the 
team, because it already owns the Atlanta Braves. ``We are not interested 
or have spoken to anyone about buying another professional franchise, 
including the Yankees,'' said Harvey Schiller, the president of Turner 
Sports and a close friend of Steinbrenner's. Attempts to buy the Yankees 
began when Cablevision and ITT jointly owned the Garden between 1994 
and 1997 and heated up the last 15 months. Those initial talks were 
conducted without becoming known to the public. But since earlier 
this year, the talks have become media fodder, with various prices 
and provisions filling airwaves and newspapers. When leaks to the 
news media about Steinbrenner's proposed role under the aegis of Cablevision 
_ that he would have stayed in charge of the Yankees and perhaps had 
a seat on the board that oversees the Garden, but would not have run 
the Knicks and Rangers _ grew too fevered and numerous, Dolan closed 
the talks down. Ending talks, at least temporarily, is part of Dolan's 
style when things aren't going his way, said several people who have 
negotiated with him. One Steinbrenner associate said he felt well 
treated by Dolan, except for a tactic in which Dolan uses input from 
financial analysts to deflect heat from himself when talks hit snags. 
``When compromise is unacceptable, he doesn't like to go on,'' said 
a cable industry veteran of numerous negotiations with Dolan. ``But 
it's a tactic to get the other side to return with a counterproposal, 
or for him to revisit with another idea.'' He added: ``Steinbrenner 
has met his match. Dolan's very crafty and rarely concludes a deal 
unless it's perceived that he came out on top.'' The view is countered 
by Dolan's partisans, who said he is a classic negotiator who wants 
both sides to win. Said Hindery: ``Transactions when one side clearly 
dominates are not much fun to him.'' When the National Football League 
tried to cajole him in August to raise his bid for the expansion Cleveland 
Browns from $485 million, he refused unless he was assured that he 
was the winner. When he eventually raised his bid _ after the eventual 
winner, Alfred Lerner, did _ it was too little, too late. ``He understands 
the value of his position,'' said Dolan's 68-year-old brother Lawrence, 
who would have been the Browns' general partner. ``You won't take 
anything from him. And he understands where George Steinbrenner is 
coming from.'' Dolan doesn't care much for talking to reporters _ 
although he is proficient, if cagy, when he speaks, and his grandfatherly 
mien can be disarming _ but he cares even less for those who provide 
the news media with details of talks during negotiations. ``He thinks 
it's rude to leak,'' said Leo Hindery, the president of Tele-Communications 
Inc., the giant cable TV company that acquired one-third of Cablevision 
last year in a complex swap for cable systems. ``George runs his whole 
life through the press. But Chuck works for his shareholders, not 
his press. He'll do a deal with George Steinbrenner, but not a day 
before it's right. Chuck will know when it's time. All my deals with 
Chuck were marked by thoughtful timing. Steinbrenner will have a deal 
when it's the right time for Chuck.'' Over 15 years, Hindery said 
he has met Dolan over a negotiating table numerous times. ``He's very 
clever and impeccably honest,'' he said. ``While others try to dominate, 
he just tries to advance the ball.'' Sometimes their talks have ended 
with a deal, sometimes they didn't. ``But they always end with a hug,'' 
Hindery said. One negotiation that ended without an embrace occurred 
in 1988 when the MSG Network, then owned by Paramount Communications, 
was taken off Cablevision's Long Island system in a public tussle 
over pricing the local sports network. When Dolan's subscribers missed 
Knicks and Rangers games, he was cast as an ogre. Cablevision now 
owns MSG and has merged its operations with Fox Sports New York (which 
Dolan created as one of a family of Sportschannels nationwide). Through 
the two networks, Dolan controls the cable telecasts of an unprecedented 
seven teams _ the Yankees, Knicks, Rangers, Mets, Nets, Islanders 
and Devils. Controlling a critical mass of the local teams' cable 
rights has been a Dolan goal for 15 years. ``Being the godfather of 
New York sports is what he wants,'' said a cable industry executive. 
In 1984, Dolan made deals with the Islanders and Mets that gave the 
teams 17{ percent of Sportschannel New York's gross revenues, contracts 
that have since been rewritten. ``At the time, Chuck felt we needed 
content for Sportschannel,'' Lustgarten said. ``The fact that the 
Islanders did so well was OK because it meant we were doing well. 
We don't begrudge them that they were being overpaid.'' A few years 
later, Pilson recalled, Dolan came to the Sportschannel board with 
a plan to buy Nets rights for seven years at $43 million. ``I said, 
`Why? No one else will buy them,''' said Pilson, a sports industry 
consultant. ``Chuck was patient,'' he added. ``He said, `You must 
understand, you have to get all the teams when you're building a regional 
sports network. If you let someone else combine the Nets with the 
Yankees, you have competition.''' A decade later, after the deals 
that have helped him dominate the local sports market, Dolan is looking 
to avoid competition by buying the Yankees. All he needs is the stamina 
for more dealmaking with George Steinbrenner.
