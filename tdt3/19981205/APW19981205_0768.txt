Nobel Literature Prize winner Jose Saramago seemed bemused at the 
notion that relatively sudden international celebrity, honors bestowed 
by a king and a country, not to mention a check for nearly 1 million 
dollars, might change his life. ``I'm 75 years old,'' he said Saturday 
night upon arrival for the annual Nobel festivities. Besides, ``It 
wouldn't be worth it to change your life ... just because of a prize.'' 
One of Europe's best-known writers, Saramago wasn't yanked from obscurity 
by his selection two months ago. But it's true that he often lost 
out to other authors in competitions for prestigious awards, only 
to win the one that crowns a career. At a news conference with questions 
asked in four languages -- Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and English 
-- a voluble, smiling Saramago, his wife seated nearby, bantered with 
reporters and talked about the craft of writing. He grew serious when 
asked to compare his novel, ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' 
for which he was criticized by the Vatican, to ``The Satanic Verses,'' 
for which author Salman Rushdie was condemned by Islamic religious 
leaders. ``Those books have nothing in common,'' he said, except that 
``no one has the right to speak in the name of God, be it pope or 
ayatollah ... because God has never told anyone to speak for him.'' 
Saramago was scheduled to give his Nobel lecture on Monday.
