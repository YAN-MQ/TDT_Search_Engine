After watching Monday night as Tennessee's women routed previously 
unbeaten and second-ranked Louisiana Tech, Duke coach Gail Goestenkors 
needed a lift. Her 16th-ranked Lady Blue Devils are to face Tennessee 
here Sunday in the Honda Elite 4 Holiday Classic. So Goestenkors flipped 
on her videocassette recorder and rewound the tape of Tennessee's 
shocking 78-68 loss to Purdue last month. ``I wanted to see that it 
was possible,'' Goestenkors said. Since the Purdue loss, the third-ranked 
Lady Vols (5-1) have started to show why they are the Chicago Bulls 
of the women's collegiate game, reeling off five straight victories. 
They have won three consecutive national titles and six since 1987. 
That does not seem to faze Goestenkors. Her 5-3 team, victimized early 
by injuries to a half-dozen players, has mustered a four-game winning 
streak. And Goestenkors said at midweek: ``I wouldn't have scheduled 
the game if I didn't think we could win. If we do the things we're 
capable of, we can win.'' Illinois (3-2) and Washington (2-3) open 
Sunday's televised doubleheader at 1 p.m. at Disney's Wide World of 
Sports arena. Tennessee and Duke will meet at 3:30. The Lady Vols, 
coming off a 39-0 season, are led by Chamique Holdsclaw of New York 
City, a senior who has been a spectacular constant in the team's three-year 
run. Michael Jordan has called her ``the most exciting women's player 
ever,'' and she gave some thought in the off season to turning pro. 
In the end, she felt too much allegiance to the Tennessee program, 
particularly to coach Pat Summitt. ``She told me, `If you buy into 
me and my system, I'll make you the best player you can be,' and here 
I am,'' Holdsclaw is quoted as saying in ``Raise the Roof,'' a book 
about Tennessee's 1997-98 perfect season. But it took a while for 
Holdsclaw to warm to her coach. Summitt's intensity and intolerance 
of mistakes made Holdsclaw wonder early whether she had made the correct 
choice in attending Tennessee. ``I felt like she was pushing me too 
hard, and I thought, `My God, this lady doesn't like me,''' Holdsclaw 
said. ``She got on me left and right. She wouldn't let me breathe. 
Anything went wrong, it was, `Chamique! Chamique!''' Now Holdsclaw 
has become endeared to Summitt's relentless nature, realizing it has 
paid off in a big way. After the Purdue loss, the Lady Vols ``refocused,'' 
as Summitt likes to call it. In other words, practices became more 
like wars again. ``We learned clearly from our loss that we can't 
just show up and win,'' Summitt said. ``I take a lot of responsibility 
myself for maybe not going into practice and being as demanding as 
I have been in past seasons.'' The loss may have been just the jolt 
the Lady Vols needed, Summitt said. ``I felt all along that we were 
going to lose at some point in time,'' she said. ``I do think it will 
help our chances down the road. It takes the monkey off your back, 
so to speak, and allows you to go out and play. Now the team feels 
it doesn't have to have another perfect year and have that pressure 
come March.'' Summitt, who is in her 25th season at Tennessee, has 
won more games than any women's coach in National Collegiate Athletic 
Association history. ``Tennessee had the vision a long time ago for 
where women's sports should be, and they went in that direction,'' 
Washington coach June Daugherty said. ``I think Pat Summitt is the 
best coach in America.''
