Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu's center-right party was expected to 
dominate parliamentary elections Sunday in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot 
republic. Eroglu's party hopes to secure a majority of seats in the 
parliament, which presides over the northern third of the divided 
Mediterranean island. Eroglu has led the government, made up of his 
National Unity Party and a Social Democrat partner, since 1996. His 
party won a landslide victory in local elections earlier this year. 
More than 85 percent of 121,000 eligible voters are expected to vote 
for 50 lawmakers from among 352 candidates fielded by seven political 
parties, the Cumhuriyet daily said. Turkish Cypriot opposition parties 
complain the election will be dominated by the large number of settlers 
from the Turkish mainland who have been given voting rights. A recent 
report by the European Union Commission put the number of recent settlers 
at 111,000 out of a total population of 200,000. Opposition parties 
claim that about half the candidates are settlers. Cyprus has been 
divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops after a coup by Greek 
Cypriots seeking union with Greece. Nine years later, Turkish Cypriots 
proclaimed the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which has been 
recognized only by Turkey. The general elections came at a time when 
President Rauf Denktash is seeking a nonaggression pact with Greek 
Cypriots to ensure peace on the island. Greek Cypriot plans to deploy 
Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles on the island have escalated tension. 
Turkey has threatened to hit missile batteries if they are deployed. 
UN-sponsored talks for reunification of Cyprus deadlocked following 
Denktash's demands for recognition of his state and the cancellation 
of Greek Cyprus' talks on joining the European Union.
