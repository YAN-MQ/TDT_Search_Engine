A waist-high railing gave way at Veterans Stadium during the Army-Navy 
game Saturday, causing injuries to nine spectators who fell about 
15 feet to the artificial turf. The extent of the injuries was not 
known, although CBS-TV reported that the most serious was a broken 
leg. The game was delayed for 38 minutes during the fourth quarter 
while four ambulance crews attended to four students from the Military 
Academy and five from its prep school at Fort Monmouth, N.J. The names 
of the injured students were not released. The fans, who were standing 
between Sections 271 and 272, were cheering for CBS cameras after 
Army's Ty Amey had run 70 yards for a touchdown that put the Cadets 
ahead by 31-30 with 7 minutes 33 second to go in the game. The students 
were not being shown on television when the accident happened, but 
CBS later showed it on videotape.
