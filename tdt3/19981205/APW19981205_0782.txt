The top international official in Bosnia on Saturday urged Bosnian 
Serbs to end violence most likely prompted by the arrest of one of 
their generals on suspicion of war crimes. The recent arrest of Gen. 
Radislav Krstic by NATO troops in Bosnia's peace force aroused anti-Western 
feelings in the Serb half of Bosnia. Krstic was the sought by the 
U.N. war crimes tribunal. An overnight explosion damaged a U.N. vehicle 
on Friday but caused no injuries, and according to a statement from 
the office of Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos Westendorp, 
more incidents occured in the area. Two vehicles of the European Union 
Monitor Mission were destroyed and the lives of two international 
officials were endangered, the release said, without offering details. 
Westendorp also criticized Friday's demonstrations in Vlasenica, some 
70 kilometers (40 miles) northeast of Sarajevo, where the first explosion 
occured. During those demonstrations, the town's mayor Stanimir Reljic, 
claimed Krstic was tortured upon arrest. Westendorp said he received 
NATO assurances that Krstic was treated according to international 
standards. He urged the president of the Bosnian Serbs, Nikola Poplasen, 
to make sure the violence was investigated and the perpetrators punished. 
Violence and inflammatory statements against internationals must stop 
immediately, Westendorp said, warning of ``further action'' unless 
his demands were obeyed. Westendorp has the power to fire local officials.
