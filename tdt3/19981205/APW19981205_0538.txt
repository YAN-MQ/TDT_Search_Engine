TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan traveled to 
Libya on Saturday for talks on bringing to trial two Libyan suspects 
in the 1988 Pan Am bombing, but possibly not with Moammar Gadhafi. 
Libya's official news agency, JANA, said that he ``may not be able 
to meet'' Gadhafi on his one-day trip, adding that the Libyan leader 
was ``in the desert outside the region.'' The JANA report said that 
Annan met with the Libyan foreign minister, Omar al-Muntasser, in 
the northern coastal town of Sirte. It gave no other information on 
why the expected Annan-Gadhafi might not take place. Earlier, the 
Libyan media suggested that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over 
the suspects, indicating that Gadhafi was giving himself room in case 
he decides against giving up the suspects. JANA said Gadhafi is neither 
the prime minister nor the president. It suggested that a decision 
on handing over the suspects would have to be approved by some 500 
grassroots national committees before being decided by the Parliament. 
Libya gave little information on Annan's visit. Libyan officials reported 
that he arrived in the country and then flew to Sirte, 400 kilometers 
(250 miles) east of the capital, Tripoli. Most reporters were barred 
from going to Sirte and ordered to stay in Tripoli.
