But first, republicans on the house Judiciary committee may not be 
able to wrap up impeachment hearings next week as they had planned. 
Friday, Mr. Clinton's lawyers announced they are asking the committee 
for three or four days to lay out their case. Currently, only one 
day has been allotted for the president's defense. The president's 
lawyers say they need to call several witnesses, some of whom will 
discuss what they call, "prosecutorial misconduct and the impact of 
Tainted witnesses." Republicans say the real agenda is to push the 
hearings into the next congressional term, when there will be more 
democrats in the house and when the chances for impeachment may be 
lower. For now, committee staffers continue drafting articles of impeachment. 
They reportedly would cover allegations of perjury, obstruction of 
justice and abuse of power.
