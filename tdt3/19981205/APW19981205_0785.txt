Riot police guarded dozens of places of worship across India Saturday 
to prevent religious violence while Hindu right-wingers prepared to 
mark the sixth anniversary of the razing of a disputed medieval mosque. 
Hundreds of armed police cordoned off the small town of Ayodhya, where 
the 16th century Babri Mosque was demolished by thousands of frenzied 
members of Hindu nationalist groups on Dec. 6, 1992. People were prohibited 
from congregating anywhere in the town on Sunday, the United News 
of India quoted officials as saying. The destruction of the mosque 
six years ago set off Hindu-Muslim riots that killed 2,000 people. 
Hindu leaders claimed the mosque was built 400 years ago by Mogul 
invaders using the rubble of a Hindu shrine they tore down. Many people 
believe the shrine stood on the birthplace of Ram, an important Hindu 
deity. A year later, suspected Muslim extremists set off 13 bomb blasts 
in Bombay to avenge the riots. The blasts killed some 600 people and 
destroyed many skyscrapers in the country's financial capital. India's 
Supreme Court is now considering the dispute over the shrine but has 
set no date for a ruling. The ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata 
Party has promised to abide by judicial opinion. ``I believe there 
is no issue or dispute which cannot be resolved satisfactorily through 
negotiations conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust and understanding. 
This holds true for Ayodhya too,'' Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 
said, according to a statement issued Saturday. But many Hindu fundamentalist 
leaders have vowed that no matter what the Supreme Court decides, 
they will start building a Hindu temple at the site of a demolished 
mosque in three years _ as soon as sculptors complete pillars, arches 
and images of gods and goddesses for the controversial shrine. They 
are expected Sunday to rally in Ayodhya, 550 kilometers (350 miles) 
east of New Delhi in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, and different 
parts of the country. Similar demonstrations in the past have often 
led to flare-ups with Muslim fundamentalists. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad 
or World Hindu Council, a close affiliate of the BJP which has spearheaded 
the movement for the construction of the temple, says it does not 
believe the court has any authority in religious matters. Under the 
VHP's direction, artisans have been working for the past several years 
in a field near the mosque's rubble, chiseling images of gods and 
goddesses from chunks of sandstone.
