Early election results Saturday showed the ruling Nationalist Party 
candidate leading in its challenge to regain the Taipei mayoral seat, 
a race that could influence Taiwan's delicate relations with mainland 
China. The Nationalists were expected to maintain control of the Legislature, 
and they picked up the first two of 176 seats that were directly chosen 
by voters in peaceful balloting. Attention focused on the Nationalist 
candidate Ma Ying-jeou's campaign to unseat the capital's mayor, Chen 
Shui-bian, the top figure in the opposition Democratic Progressive 
Party, which calls for formal independence from China. Early results 
with about 12 percent of the votes counted showed Ma leading, with 
51 percent, compared to 46 percent for Chen. A longshot candidate 
from the tiny New Party, Wang Chien-shien, trailed with just 3 percent 
in the race that had been viewed as too close to call. While the campaigners 
talked mainly about tackling the urban problems of Taipei, the underlying 
theme was that the winning party would go into presidential elections 
16 months later from a position of strength _ and differing ideas 
on how to deal with Beijing. The Nationalists banked on citizens being 
scared by the DPP's platform calling for a declaration of independence 
from China _ seen as a potential catalyst for a military attack by 
the mainland. Beijing is closely watching the outcome. The Chinese 
government claims pro-Western Taiwan as a part of China, although 
the two separated politically in a 1949 civil war. Most Taiwanese 
want to maintain a separate identity from China and postpone the question 
of whether to pursue reunification or permanent independence. Chen 
avoided mentioning independence in the campaign, but his camp raised 
divisive questions about the loyalty of Ma, who was born to parents 
from the mainland and moved to Taiwan when he was just 1. Ma's party 
backs eventual reunification with the mainland, though he did not 
emphasize this during the race. Turnout appeared heavy among the island's 
nearly 15 million eligible voters, with officials estimating 80 percent 
had cast ballots in Taipei. Police had been guarding the more than 
10,000 polling stations across the island _ with huge barbed wire 
barriers on hand in some spots _ to try to avoid repeats of violence 
that has marred past elections. There were no immediate reports of 
trouble on Saturday. Businessman David Wu in Taipei said he voted 
for Ma because of his ``clean image.'' ``His support is unprecedented,'' 
Wu said. ``He must win or the Nationalists' morale will be badly damaged.'' 
President Lee Teng-hui, who will retire in early 2000, quietly cast 
his ballot with his wife, Tseng Wen-hui, but he declined offers to 
appear at polling stations with other candidates hoping for some last-minute 
publicity. Voters were directly choosing 176 national legislators, 
and a remaining 49 seats were to be assigned to parties based on how 
many votes they get. Voters also were choosing a mayor for the southern 
city of Kaohsiung and city councils in Taipei and Kaohsiung.
