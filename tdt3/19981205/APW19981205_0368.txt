Iraq on Saturday denied that it barred weapons experts in October 
from entering a suspected weapons site inside an area controlled by 
exiled Iranian opposition activists. They wanted to enter a site ``belonging 
to one of the foreign parties residing in Iraq'' over which Iraq has 
no control, the official Iraqi News Agency said, quoting Hussam Mohammed 
Ameen, the head of an Iraqi office that deals with the U.N. inspectors. 
In a letter to the U.N. Security Council dated Dec. 3, deputy chief 
inspector Charles Duelfer said a U.N. team could not obtain access 
to a site because it was under the control of an exiled Iranian opposition 
group. Ameen said Iraq cannot get officially involved when the United 
Nations Special Commission, which is responsible for disarming Iraq, 
wants to inspect a site occupied by foreigners. He said the rules 
of disarmament in Iraq require that the head of the inspection team 
and the foreign official in charge of the area work out an arrangement 
between themselves for entering the site. Ameen said some U.N. inspectors 
did want to enter the site administered by Iranian exiles of the Mujahideen 
Khalq on Oct. 25. But the Iraqi side ``strictly adhered'' to the procedures 
and did not interfere in the negotiations between the exiled Iranians 
and the inspectors, he said. Finally, after almost three hours of 
discussions, the head of the inspection team decided not to go in 
and withdrew his members, Ameen said The Mujahideen Khalq, which opposes 
the Islamic government in Iran, operates about a dozen military camps 
in Iraq, most of them close to the Iranian border. Ameen said the 
same U.N. team had carried out surprise visits to 15 weapons sites 
including government buildings on the same day. UNSCOM is responsible 
for destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Until the mission 
is complete, the U.N. Security Council will not lift the economic 
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
