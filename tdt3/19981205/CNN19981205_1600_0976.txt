Mergers, layoffs and profit-taking are the talk of the financial world 
this week. David Daniel looks at "business this week." While holiday 
shoppers massed at the malls, megacorporations were on a mission to 
merge. Germany's Deutsche bank set out to create the world's largest 
financial services company this week, deciding to buy New York-based 
bankers trust for $10.1 billion. And Exxon and mobil confirmed the 
rumors, announcing an $80 billion merger that would create the world's 
largest oil company. Analysts say the deal could lead to as many as 
12,000 job cuts. That was just part of the nearly 36,000 job cuts 
announced this week.
