The fight to be the leading newspaper of the city with ambitions to 
be Europe's new capital is a ferocious one, so when executives at 
the Berliner Morgenpost sat down recently to dream up a new advertising 
slogan, they thought long and hard. What they came up with was: ``Simply 
the Best.'' Not ``Einfach besser,'' German for the same idea, but 
``Simply the Best,'' as in Tina Turner's popular song. ``Our target 
group was young people,'' said Rolf Buer, the paper's marketing manager, 
``and this slogan was young, fresh, simple and sure to get people 
talking. German words are just too long.'' That may seem an unjust 
accusation to level at ``Einfach besser,'' but it is true that if 
precision is a hallmark of the German vocabulary, brevity is not. 
In any event, the issue is clearly a broader one, for the English 
encroachment on Deutsch has assumed epic proportions, giving rise 
to a form of speech widely known as ``Denglisch.'' Consider this city, 
whose passion for reinventing itself is very much of the New World. 
As you drive past posters advertising Volkswagen's ``New Beetle'' 
(not ``Der neue Kafer''), you may hear a radio advertisement for an 
Audi that gives you ``die power,'' only to see a newspaper headline 
about Germany's lack of ``jobs'' (forget ``arbeit''), as the radio 
turns to a discussion of Berliners' growing attraction for ``the American 
way of life.'' English, of course, is advancing everywhere, propelled 
by the Internet and the dominance of American popular culture. It 
is the most widely studied foreign language in German schools, where 
most children start learning it at age 11. Its advance appears particularly 
marked here, strong enough to set off a debate on what it is to be 
a German. Language, of course, is a paramount expression of identity, 
and German identity has been a delicate issue ever since Hitler perverted 
the notion with disastrous consequences for those he considered un-German. 
Not for nothing have many Germans embraced the idea of being ``Europeans'' 
or ``cosmopolitans'' or ``citizens of the world.'' And of course the 
language of such world citizens is English. ``I don't like to think 
in terms of national borders,'' said Ulrich Veigel, head of the Bates 
advertising agency in Germany. ``I live in Germany, and was born here, 
but I'm a citizen of the world, and that is the way we should all 
think. In the medium-term, nationalities have no chance.'' English, 
Veigel continued, is a wonderful language precisely because it is 
the most cosmopolitan. ``I look forward to the day,'' he said, ``when 
I go to France and do not have to speak French.'' Until that day _ 
some way off if the Academie Francaise has anything to do with it 
_ Veigel will be pushing his message in Germany, where the Bates agency 
is responsible for the current campaign of the cargo division of the 
national airline, Lufthansa. Slogan: ``Thinking in new directions.'' 
It is also promoting a new German telephone company called ``First 
Telecom'' with the jingle ``You can't beat the First.'' Such catchwords 
clearly reflect a perception that Germans see English as more contemporary 
or modish. ``New Beetle sounds more hip than neue Kafer,'' said Sabina 
Metzner of Volkswagen. ``We wanted to make clear that the Beetle might 
have some resemblances to the old Kafer, but it is very much a modern 
car.'' For some Germans, though, the abandonment of the language of 
Heine and Rilke is too high a price to be hip. Wolfgang Kramer, a 
professor of economics at the University of Dortmund, said ``Denglisch'' 
is a monstrosity, ``a cowardly means for many Germans to disentangle 
themselves from German history, a way out of being German.'' Two years 
ago, he read a profile of Jil Sander, the Hamburg-based fashion designer, 
in the magazine of the daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. 
In a single paragraph, Ms. Sander explained how her life was ``giving 
story,'' talked of the need to be ``contemporary,'' extolled the virtues 
of ``coordinated concepts,'' referred to her ``audience,'' and ruminated 
on the ``effortless magic'' of her styles. That was too much for the 
professor. He founded the Society for the Protection of the German 
Language (Verein zur Wahrung der Deutschen Sprache), instituted an 
annual linguistic booby prize for the ``Sprachpanscher'' (``language 
diluter'') of the year, and gave the 1997 accolade to Ms. Sander. 
This year, his society has seen its membership soar from 200 to 4,000 
and last month, Kramer announced that the 1998 award for ``spineless 
conformity to modern pseudo-cosmopolitan attempts at showing off'' 
had been awarded to Ron Sommer, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, 
the main telephone company. Sommer had distinguished himself by advertising 
``moonshine'' and ``sunshine'' tariffs, and listing calls on bills 
under the categories of ``Citycall,'' ``Germancall'' and ``Globalcall.'' 
Until July, the German translations only appeared on the back of the 
bills, but have now been moved to the same line after what Hans Ehnert, 
a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom, called ``some inquiries.'' ``Our 
chief executive pays no attention to this so-called prize,'' Ehnert 
said. ``We are a global player in a modern, high-tech world, and English 
expressions are part of this future environment.'' But the success 
of Kramer's association suggests a reaction may be gathering pace. 
``Shame explains why English does so much better here than in France, 
or Spain or Italy,'' he said. ``But I refuse to let the history of 
our country be condensed into the 12 years of Hitler's terror. I was 
born much later and have no reason to be ashamed.'' This message is 
also that of the new government of the Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, 
which devoted much of a recent summit meeting with French leaders 
to the issue of defending ``Franco-German culture'' against the cultural 
pull of America through the establishment of a new Franco-German university 
in Saarbrucken and other measures. But, of course, France and Germany 
have a basic problem: the unfettered, dynamic, creative culture of 
California is more attractive to many young people than European societies 
often identified with high unemployment and rigidity. ``The young 
want to hear English,'' said Buer of the Berliner Morgenpost. ``It's 
seen as free and flexible.'' Besides, he noted, if the Berliner Morgenpost 
had chosen ``Einfach besser'' instead of ``Simply the Best'' as a 
slogan, it might have violated the German law known as the ``Unzulassige 
Alleinstellung,'' which forbids sweeping assertions of superiority 
in advertising. ``We would have had to answer a lot of questions,'' 
Buer said. ``Better than who? Better than what? Why better? Better 
in what precise respect? It was just too much bother, whereas in English 
we could do what we wanted.''
