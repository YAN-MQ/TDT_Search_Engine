Now, for the games that will go a long way in determining who plays 
for a National championship. UCLA, second in the bcs standings at 
the start of the day, trying to complete its undefeated regular season 
in Miami facing the hurricanes. That game originally scheduled for 
September, but called off due to hurricane georges. Big 12 championship 
-- Kansas state, also undefeated, but third in the bcs, needs to beat 
Texas A&M in St. Louis to remain in the Hunt for a fiesta bowl bid. 
Now tonight, tee Martin and the 11-0 Tennessee volunteers meet Mississippi 
state at the Georgia dome for the SEC title. With a win, Tennessee 
leading the bcs, would hold onto one of the two top spots and grab 
an invite to the fiesta bowl. Our focus is on what we can control 
and what we can do something about. And the next game is the only 
one you could do anything about.
