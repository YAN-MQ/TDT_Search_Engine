President Clinton is hailing a new system of instant background checks 
for gun purchasers. In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton said 
more than 400 people were prevented from purchasing firearms in the 
system's first four days. He criticized the national rifle association 
for trying to block the system. The president announced other steps 
he wants to take to stop illegal trafficking in firearms. We must 
make sure that firearms Let's make sure that firearms sold at gun 
shows are not exempt from background checks. That gun sales do not 
circumvent our gun laws. Last month I asked treasury secretary Rubin 
and attorney general Reno to find ways to close this loophole. President 
Clinton is in Arkansas today attending the funeral of his friend and 
former aide, Maurice Smith.
