A prominent former senator also is considering a run for the oval 
office. Democrat Bill Bradley has formed an exploratory committee 
to test the waters. Brooks Jackson reports. Okay, but what about the 
money? When Bob Dole ran for his party's nomination, he had raised 
$24 million before the first day of 1996. Senator Phil Gramm had raised 
nearly $21 million, and he dropped out. Vice President Al Gore, a 
prodigious fundraiser with all the advantages of incumbency, is expected 
to do at least as well next year. So how much would Bradley need next 
year? Oh, I'd say somewhere probably in the neighborhood of $18 million 
to $20 million, and that's probably a minimum. So Bradley would have 
to raise on average between $49,000 and $55,000 per day, weekends 
and holidays included, every day of 1999. Bradley says he can do it. 
Well, it is a very large task. And I've had success in the past raising 
money. But Bradley has raised less than $21 million over his entire 
senate career starting in 1979, including donations to his leadership 
pack. And according to an analysis by the campaign study group for 
CNN, 39% of bradley's money has come from his home state, New Jersey, 
and another 26% from neighboring New York. California, the most important 
primary state, supplied 12% of Bradley's money. But, Chicago, Florida, 
those kinds of places -- he hasn't proven that he can do it yet. And 
in the past, Bradley was a senior member of the Senate finance committee 
which writes tax legislation. Not sitting on a committee that has 
the power of legislation, particularly the power of the purse or the 
taxation power, that's going to hurt him a lot. Bradley will need 
lots of $1,000 checks. He had fewer than 6,000 of them in his 1990 
Senate race. He'll need an estimated 16,000 to wage a competitive 
presidential campaign. I think no one starts off with a record of 
being able to raise this large level of money. It is a daunting task. 
But he has always done things to win, and I think he and the campaign, 
if it evolves, will be very confident he can do it. Money has become 
the first primary in presidential nominating races, one where only 
dollars count. And to have any hope of competing, Bradley will have 
to raise more faster than he ever has before. Brooks Jackson, CNN, 
Washington.
