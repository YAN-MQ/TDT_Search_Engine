Senator Bob Kerrey is preparing to decide whether he will seek the 
presidency in two years. A top aide to the Nebraska democrat says 
Kerrey will make an announcement one way or the other on December 
13th. The second-term senator is a former governor of Nebraska and 
won the medal of honor for his service in Vietnam. He sought the democratic 
nomination in 1992.
