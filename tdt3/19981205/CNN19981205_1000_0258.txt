Authorities in Texas say an escaped death row inmate found dead Thursday 
accidentally drowned. 29-year-old Martin gurule may have sought refuge 
in the swift waters of a Rain-swollen Creek when searchers got close 
to his hiding place. His body was discovered one week after his escape 
from the state prison in huntsville. The nephew of a man gurule was 
convicted of killing says, "I'm just glad he's dead." A Texas criminal 
justice official says the book on last week's escape is now closed. 
You guys have seen this? You know it's the felony escape thing for 
Martin gurule. It's through. It's all over. Gurule is no more. We 
have a clean record of all of our escapes now. We have all our people 
back in custody. Six other inmates attempted to escape with gurule, 
but they were caught. It was the first escape of a death row prisoner 
in Texas since 1934.
