Rumors of foul play surrounded the death several years ago of Hollywood 
director James whale. Anna Hovind reports a new film, "gods and monsters," 
examines the last month of his life. So, then you did have a wife? 
Or a husband, depending on which of us you asked. In "gods and monsters," 
Ian McKellen plays James whale, a Hollywood legend, forgotten by most. 
James whale was a director, who in the 1930s made "the bride of frankenstein." 
And he had this great career, and then it quickly came to end and 
spent the last 15 years of his life painting and reading. He had a 
stroke towards the end of his life, left him perfectly functional 
and ambulatory, but he couldn't control where his mind went. And it 
finally drove him to point where he took his own life. And we really 
focus on that last month. During that last month, the openly gay whale 
befriends his straight Gardener, Clayton. The movie is about the relationship 
between whale and his Gardener, played by Brendan Fraser. And at various 
points, it's a real power play between the two. And at various points, 
they're -- each one is both a God and a monster. While Clayton is 
straight, he forms a unique bond with while. You're a homosexual. 
If I must use a chemical name. I'm not, you know? One of the things 
the movie is about, you know, a point in people's lives where they 
are lonely and sometimes that can force you to reach out to people 
that you would otherwise have no time for. And how valuable that can 
be. For McKellen, there is talk in Hollywood about a possible Oscar 
nomination for the role. He is an incredible actor. In this part especially, 
I think he connected to it in so many ways, that it seems to me, he 
revealed more of what's inside of him than we've ever seen before. 
Lynn Redgrave is hardly recognizable as the director's protective 
housekeeper. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven. Hell, 
everybody's got those. No, his is the worst. She loves the idea of 
his appearing inside the character. I think Lynn was able to play 
with cliches of the character because, you know, by design, it's a 
character that's almost from a James whale movie and then make it 
completely real. "gods and monsters" is opening this month across 
the country. Anna Hovind, "Headline News."
