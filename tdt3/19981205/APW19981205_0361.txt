Top government officials on Saturday berated billionaire financier 
George Soros after he called for the ouster of Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamad and for the release of his jailed former deputy, the national 
news agency reported. Soros harbors a long-term plan ``to destroy 
the democratically elected government of this country,'' Works Minister 
Samy Vellu was quoted as saying by Bernama. ``In view of his selfish 
motives to enrich himself, he has chosen to destroy the economy of 
the developing nations,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Malaysia is one 
of the victims of the economic wounds inflicted by him.'' In a speech 
Thursday, Soros told a U.S. audience that Malaysians should turn against 
their prime minister because his policies were aimed at benefiting 
himself and his cronies. ``I think what needs to happen is he needs 
to be removed from power,'' Soros said at the Johns Hopkins University. 
Mahathir fired popular politician, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 2, declaring 
his former protege as too immoral to rule. Anwar was arrested Sept. 
20, and is on trial on charges of corruption and illegal sex acts. 
Anwar, who started a reform movement opposing Mahathir's financial 
policies, has denied all charges and has accused Mahathir of being 
threatened by his growing popularity. Mahathir said Soros was free 
to express his opinion. ``I don't wish to make any comments on the 
matter,'' he said. Previously, Mahathir, 72, has repeatedly accused 
Soros and other speculators of using highly speculative investments 
to move markets and destroy Malaysia's once-booming economy. On Saturday, 
the chief minister of Perak state, Ramli Ngah Talib, told Malaysians 
to ignore Soros. ``Any person making such announcements is impaired,'' 
Ramli said. ``It is totally useless for us to listen to them, and 
it is best just to ignore it.'' Last month, U.S. Vice President Al 
Gore angered his Malaysian hosts at a summit of Pacific Rim leaders 
with a speech praising the ``brave people of Malaysia'' who support 
Anwar.
