In a hawkish speech to his governing party's annual congress on Saturday, 
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos called on the Angolan people and 
the international community to ostracize rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. 
``The only path to peace today is the internal and external isolation 
of Dr. Savimbi, and his military hard-liners,'' Dos Santos told the 
MPLA congress. The government has severed all contact with Savimbi 
and his UNITA rebel group and expelled Savimbi's supporters from the 
government of national unity, further weakening the fragile 1994 peace 
pact. Dos Santos described Savimbi as ``a man who knows only how to 
kill, destroy and divide.'' The government has accused Savimbi of 
keeping an army hidden in the bush. Dos Santos' opening address at 
the four-day congress followed Friday's reports that the army was 
attacking Savimbi's remaining rural strongholds, Andulo and Bailundo, 
where 14 U.N. peacekeepers are based. Under the peace deal, UNITA 
has handed back to the government most of the areas under its control, 
but has refused to surrender its central highland strongholds despite 
pressure from the United Nations. The U.N. Security Council on Friday 
reiterated U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's call on Savimbi to 
allow an aircraft into his strongholds to evacuate the peacekeepers. 
The U.N.-brokered pact ended a two-decade civil war between the governing 
MPLA, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, and Savimbi's 
UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. Souring 
relations between both sides and mutual accusations of military action 
have stymied the peace process since.
