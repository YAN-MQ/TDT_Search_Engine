Some republican governors want a quick end to the impeachement process. 
Gene Randall reports. Bolstered by their election-night successes, 
in the face of a Bad, off-year performance by the national republican 
party, many GOP governors say it is time to get the presidential impeachment 
process wrapped up. I think in my discussions with 12 million pennsylvanians 
off and on, they would like to see some finality, some resolution. 
All we're saying is let the Congress resolve it consistent with the 
law and the facts and then move on. Resolve it quickly, and move on, 
and address the other issues of real moment to the American public. 
Both Keating and Ridge easily won re-election last month. So did republican 
John Rowland of Connecticut. My personal opinion is, I think we should 
go for censure, and get this thing over with. Thank you very much 
for giving us an opportunity to come here and partner. All three were 
part of a two-hour meeting with republican congressional leaders today. 
The governors said the impeachment issue did not come up, but it was 
apparent afterward it was an undercurrent. Listen to moderate Tom 
Ridge -- Because I don't think there's anybody in America that thinks, 
or the majority believes, that the president would or should be removed 
from office by the Senate. And conservative Frank Keating -- Hopefully, 
it'll be over quickly, hopefully, it'll be resolved fairly, but let's 
get it over with fairly and quickly and with factual basis. Keating 
conceded the impeachment controversy is a distraction, but said it 
should not be an excuse for legislative paralysis. Ridge, meanwhile, 
says November 3rd was a GOP wake-up call -- a graphic reminder that 
performance counts. There isn't a governor, a republican governor, 
that wasn't elected overwhelmingly that did not have a message that 
really connected with people about issues that they talk about at 
the dinner table. Obviously, we went wrong by not having an agenda. 
And how did voters view the republican party on November 3rd? They 
saw the republicans as mired in the swamp of impeachment and censure 
and removal, as if that's all they cared about. In a CNN/"USA today" 
Gallup poll done two weeks ago, well over half the republicans questioned 
said it was time for the house Judiciary committee to wrap up its 
impeachment hearings. Those are the voices many of this country's 
republican governors are having no trouble hearing. Gene Randall,
