President Clinton is hailing a new system of instant background checks 
for gun purchasers. In his weekly radio address today, Mr. Clinton 
said more than 400 people were prevented from buying firearms in the 
system's first four days. He also criticized the national rifle association 
for trying to block the system. The president announced other measures 
he wants implemented to stop the illegal spread of firearms. We must 
make sure that firearms sold at gun shows are not exempt from background 
checks, that gun sales do not sir come vent our gun laws. Last month 
I asked secretary Rubin and Janet Reno ways to close this loophole. 
President Clinton is in Arkansas today, attending the funeral of his 
friend and former gubernatorial chief of staff, Maurice Smith.
