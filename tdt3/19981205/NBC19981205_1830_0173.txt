To Libya now, and the search for justice ten years after the bombing 
of Pan Am Flight 103. U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan is in Libya 
tonight on a mission to bring the suspects to trial. But as NBC's 
donatella lorch reports, the outcome of the effort is very much in 
doubt. Despite a late-night meeting, the U.N. secretary-general was 
unable to report a break through. He did not announce he had won custody 
of the lybian suspects wanted in the bombing of Pan Am 103. Annan 
had been given a red carpet greeting, but he had to travel to a place 
to meet Gadhafi. Gadhafi wants the two lybian men to be safely released. 
The bombing ten years ago this month killed 270 people, including 
189 americans. Ever since the suspects were identified, the United 
States and Great Britain have been pressuring Libya to surrender the 
two men. The secretary-general is telling. The Libyans that a deal 
would bring the immediate suspension of sanctions, including a flight 
ban in force since 1992. It could really change the status of Libya 
in the world. It's a very important moment and a lot is at stake. 
If Libya decides to give up the men, they will be tried under scottish 
law in this courthouse in Holland. A plane is on standby to pick up 
the suspects and fly them here. Libya wants a guarantee the men, if 
found guilty, would not serve their sentence in a Scottish prison, 
a demand rejected by both the United States and Great Britain. Gadhafi 
is also concerned that evidence at the trial might implicate high-ranking 
officials in the Libyan regime. Negotiations will continue, but Annan 
did not say how long the talks would take, saying some time, but not 
a huge amount. Donatella lorch, NBC news.
