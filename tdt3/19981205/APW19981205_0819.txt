Cuba moved to quell a diplomatic row with Mexico on Saturday, saying 
reporters misinterpreted Fidel Castro when they quoted him as saying 
Mexicans traded in their historic heroes for Mickey Mouse. The Mexican 
Foreign Relations Ministry had demanded Friday that Cuba explain criticism 
of Mexico's relationship with the United States, which Mexico City 
newspapers had attributed to Castro. The daily El Universal reported 
that the Cuban president had said Mexico was turning its back on poor 
Latin American nations and that many Mexicans would sooner be able 
to say who Mickey Mouse was than name the father of their country. 
A statement from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico said Castro's comments, 
made Wednesday ``in a discreet and familiar environment'' during a 
gathering of Latin American economic leaders in Cuba, had been taken 
out of context and ``absolutely misinterpreted.'' The statement said 
Castro's comment about Mickey Mouse, a popular cartoon character, 
was not a criticism of Mexicans but a remark on the overwhelming cultural 
dominance of the U.S. entertainment industry. If many Mexican children 
were asked to name their country's founders ``it is possible that 
many of them would not know, but they would instead know who is Mickey 
Mouse, who are all of the principal characters of the animated cartoons 
coming from the United States; and the same thing occurs in the rest 
of Latin America,'' Castro said.
