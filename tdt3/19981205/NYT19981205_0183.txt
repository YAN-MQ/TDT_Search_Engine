The Morristown Colonials picked up where two other New Jersey high 
school football powers had left off by routing Westfield, 37-14, in 
the North Jersey Section 2, Group 3 final Saturday at Giants Stadium. 
Bergen Catholic and Passaic Tech kicked off this weekend's six-game 
state championship set here on Friday night by registering resounding 
victories in their respective title games. Bergen Catholic (12-0) 
crushed St. Joseph (10-1), 35-9, in the Parochial Group 4 final, and 
Passaic Tech (12-0) dominated Union Hill (10-2), 48-6, for the North 
Jersey Section 1, Group 4 title. For Morristown (11-0), the state's 
fourth-ranked team, it was the second straight state title and fourth 
over all. The Colonials, who are now 7-0 in playoff action, claimed 
their other state titles in 1974 and 1993. They have won 19 straight 
games. Morristown achieved the victory by holding off the Blue Devils' 
comeback attempt. Westfield (9-3) rallied from a 22-0 first-quarter 
deficit to pull within 8 points before the Colonials blew the game 
open early in the final period. The turning point came on the final 
play of the third quarter, when Stewart Winston returned a Westfield 
punt 65 yards to the Blue Devils' 10-yard line. Four plays later, 
Ahmad Hagler leaped over a pile of players in the end zone for his 
second touchdown of the game to extend Morristown's lead to 30-14. 
Winston put the game away with 5 minutes 36 seconds remaining when 
he took a quarterback keeper around left end for a 4-yard score. The 
teams took turns dominating in the first half. Morristown, taking 
advantage of three Westfield fumbles in the first five minutes of 
the contest, scored 22 unanswered points in the first quarter. Westfield, 
which had lost three fumbles all season, responded with two touchdowns 
of its own in the second period to narrow Morristown's lead to 22-14 
at the half. Morristown, which arguably boasts the best backfield 
in the state, scored on its first two possessions of the game. The 
Colonials feature three dangerous backs in Hagler (181 carries for 
1,643 yards and 21 touchdowns), Dorell Humes (56 carries for 646 yards 
and 8 touchdowns) and Winston (646 yards and 6 touchdowns passing, 
and 722 yards and 10 touchdowns rushing). Morristown, which entered 
the game having scored 17 touchdowns on runs of 40 yards or more, 
opened the scoring when Winston raced around right end on a 36-yard 
quarterback keeper. Rob Oglivie faked the extra-point kick and found 
Jon Rogers in the end zone to stake Morristown to an 8-0 lead. On 
the ensuing kickoff, Morristown's Matt Osborne recovered a Kevin McCormack 
fumble at Westfield's 45-yard line. Two plays later, Morristown made 
it 15-0 as Hagler dived in after a 44-yard pass from Winston to Oglivie 
put the ball at the 1. Morristown appeared on its way to an easy victory 
when Hagler broke loose on a 55-yard jaunt. But Westfield, which was 
seeking its first title since 1977 _ when Butch Woolfolk, later a 
running back with the Giants, played for the Blue Devils _ did not 
go without a fight. Westfield got on the board 1:29 into the second 
period when McCormack reached the end zone from 49 yards out. McCormack's 
touchdown capped a five-play, 91-yard drive. The key play was a 31-yard 
pass from Brandon Doerr to Todd Dowling. Westfield's final touchdown 
came 43 seconds before intermission. Doerr hit Lamont Turner with 
a 8-yard scoring strike.
