Thirteen solo sailors began the second leg of the Around Alone around-the-world 
race Saturday, pushed by westerly winds toward New Zealand, their 
next stop. Giovanni Soldini of Italy on Saturday led the fleet out 
of Table Bay under an overcast skies with westerly winds of 10- to 
15-knots. The leg takes the racers on a roughly 7,000-mile (11,200-kilometer) 
voyage to Auckland, New Zealand, running through churning waters of 
the Roaring Forties _ below 40 degrees south latitude. Mike Golding 
of Britain won the first leg by just 2 1/2 hours, arriving in Cape 
Town on Oct. 31 after 34 days at sea. The second- and third-place 
finishers were Isabelle Autissier and Marc Thiercelin, both of France. 
The racers left Charleston, S.C., on Sept. 27, heading from the east 
coast of the United States to Cape Town. The racers will also stop 
at Punta del Este, Uruguay, before returning to Charleston next spring. 
Two competitors, Robin Davie and Fedor Konioukhov, remained in Cape 
Town sorting out final repairs. Davie, 47, of Charleston, is in the 
last stages of fitting a new rudder to his 50-foot yacht South Carolina. 
He is expected to begin Leg 2 on Monday. Konioukhov's 60-foot Modern 
University for the Humanities yacht needs to sort of problems with 
his keel-bolt issues and water-ballast. The Russian also hopes to 
leave Monday. Soldini started the leg nearly three days in elapsed 
time behind Golding, and knows that he must win or place highly on 
this leg if he stands any realistic chance of winning the race, which 
is held every four years.
