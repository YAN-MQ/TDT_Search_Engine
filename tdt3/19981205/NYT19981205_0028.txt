This just in. Orlando Hernandez, it has been learned, did not escape 
Cuba as originally believed, on the fin of a shark. There is also 
no truth to reports that El Duque survived for days on sand and dental 
floss; he actually gorged himself at the media buffet at the Caribbean 
baseball championships held on Anguilla Cay. Which, it turns out, 
is not a tiny, uninhabited island but the bustling home of a Yankee 
farm team. So says one of the men who sailed with Hernandez on a triple-decked 
luxury fishing liner, the Castro Convertible. ``We played shuffleboard, 
drank wine and bet on the Yankees in the casino lounge,'' said one 
of these men, who claimed El Duque lost much of the $3 million he 
earned while pitching for the Cuban national team. Through his agent, 
Joe Cubas, Hernandez denied this latest version of his journey, though 
he admitted that there may have been a 75-and-over shuffleboard tournament 
during the four days he and his party were stranded on Anguilla Cay. 
Whom, exactly, are we to believe? During the playoffs and World Series, 
it became apparent that Hernandez had been advised to reveal no further 
details of his celebrated defection last December, as film and book 
deals were in the works. Was it really a leaky raft, tossed by waves, 
chased by sharks? Everyone was guessing and no one was divulging until 
last week, when three of El Duque's companion defectors told Sports 
Illustrated and then The Associated Press that some of the previously 
circulated material was the journalistic equivalent of an El Duque 
curveball, in the dirt. No raft, no leaks, no waves, no sharks. No 
myths left on sale. One of these sources, Juan Carlos Romero, has 
reportedly filed a civil suit in Costa Rica, alleging Hernandez reneged 
on a promise to financially secure Romero and his wife, and in the 
process raised the notion that the only insufferable codition on board 
was Hernandez himself. ``He was lying in the cabin, not paying any 
attention to where we were going,'' Romero, the pilot, told The A.P. 
``He got seasick and vomited.'' To which anyone who has made a Hollywood 
version of a single true story would say: That'll work. ``It's the 
quintessential rags-to-riches American story,'' said Alan Swyer, a 
screenwriter from Santa Monica, Calif., and a rabid sports fan. ``El 
Duque's not Rosie Ruiz.'' Swyer was referring to the woman who, a 
number of years ago, showed up not far from the finish line of the 
Boston Marathon, a complete fake. Conversely, according to the version 
presented by Romero, Hernandez's worst critic, the pitcher's tale 
does include the following details, which made it still sound like 
a mighty good yarn to me. The so-called raft was actually a wooden, 
20-foot boat with a Russian-built engine (just what seven people want 
to possibly outrun a hostile Cuban coast guard in). They survived 
those four days on Anguilla Cay on sea conchs fished out of the shallows 
and cooked in pans left by previous defectors (most ballplayers couldn't 
last four hours without their cell phones). After waving sticks and 
being rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard, the ride north to Freeport, 
the Bahamas, was through a severe storm (the trip, apparently, could 
not be rescheduled as part of a doubleheader). As for the baseball 
portion of the upcoming movie, let's just remember we are not talking 
Hideki Irabu. ``From Cuba to star pitcher in the World Series, how 
often does that happen?'' Swyer said. ``I wouldn't be deterred by 
the fact that there might be some exaggeration.'' As to whose version 
he might go with, Swyer said: ``I always remember the old John Ford 
line _ `Torn between the truth and the legend, I'll go with the legend.''' 
That was the standard screenplay strategy Swyer used for the recent 
Home Box Office film on the late New York playground basketball legend, 
Earl Manigault. ``The funny thing,'' he said, ``is that there are 
guys who knew Earl and know better but now accept my version as the 
truth.'' That's the power of Hollywood, where even great fiction gets 
a healthy rewrite. As far as who, if anyone, suggested Hernandez embellish 
the truth, who cares? His concept was a winner, the screenwriter's 
best friend. ``With certain scenes, various events, you have to take 
some dramatic license to have cohesive drama,'' Swyer said. Unless 
we want to start recalling some Oscars _ I seem to remember a few 
liberties taken in ``Schindler's List'' _ my advice is that we not 
make too big a deal about El Duque's discrepancies. It could be worse. 
They could bring in Oliver Stone to direct, and we'd find out the 
Series fix was in.
