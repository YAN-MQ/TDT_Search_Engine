Russia and Cyprus signed a double taxation accord Saturday that the 
Cypriot finance minister hailed as ``the most important event of 1998 
for the Cyprus economy.'' ``The agreement is undoubtedly significant 
because it safeguards the continued investment through Cyprus of billions 
of dollars in the Russian economy,'' Finance Minister Christodoulos 
Christodoulou said. He said the accord was achieved ``after many months 
of intensive and hard negotiations.'' Foreign investors have been 
investing billions of dollars in Russia through Cyprus in recent years 
to take advantage of loopholes which exempted the profits and interest 
from double taxation. Russia had demanded a change in Cypriot tax 
law which would have enabled Moscow to tax such profits. Cyprus had 
objected because this would have placed it at a disadvantage to the 
United States and European states, which enjoy such exemptions under 
their own agreements with Moscow. Christodoulou said the new agreement, 
which is valid for five years, will conform with the terms of Russia's 
agreements with the United States and European states. Russian Deputy 
Finance Minister Alexei Kutrin expressed satisfaction after the signing 
ceremony, saying the new agreement was ``more balanced.'' Kutrin said 
that not all problems had been solved. ``We have before us serious 
targets which we must achieve in the next few years,'' he added.
