With 1998 almost over, analysts expect the market to finish the year 
up. But the recent gyrations on Wall Street indicate there may be 
dark clouds on the horizon. Rhonda schaffler has more. a powerful 
rally lifted stocks just one day after renewed concerns about global 
economic trouble sent U.S. equities spiraling. The big winners, large 
cap technology stocks. For the week, the NASDAQ hardly budged, losing 
only 13 points. I think we'll finish the year on a fairly positive 
note. We have another week where we could still see pre-announcements 
and things to rattle the market. But I think the last two weeks will 
be pretty good. As financial stocks recovered from Thursday's drubbing. 
And Procter & Gamble rallied 3.5. a bullish employment report reassured 
investors the U.S. economy remains healthy. But that optimism is at 
odds with a deeper concern about a deteriorating earnings environment 
and the biggest wave of job cuts this decade. I've never seen a market 
that's more volatile. But if you stuck with your guts and said, "look, 
is it a good company? Is it kind of down? Do I want to be in this 
industry? Is it a good place to be? Do I like the management?" You've 
done all right. Analysts say there's plenty of cash out there waiting 
to move into the market. But investors are still cautious. Mutual 
fund tracking firm trim tabs estimates $16 billion flowed into U.S. 
stock funds over the last two months. That's half the amount from 
a year ago. Rhonda schaffler, "CNN Financial News," New York.
