Israeli coast guards fired on Lebanese fishing boats off this southern 
port on Saturday, slightly wounding a fisherman, Lebanese security 
officials said. Separately, the accidental explosion of a hand grenade 
killed a member of a pro-Israeli militia and his girlfriend in a house 
in Rmeish village in the Israeli-occupied zone of south Lebanon, the 
security officials said. In fishing boat incident, Hassan Seknani, 
27, was admitted to a hospital in Tyre for a bullet wound in his right 
arm. ``I was out at sea when a gunboat started flashing its lights 
toward us,'' Seknani told a local television channel from his hospital 
bed. Without warning, the gunboat ``opened heavy fire on us. ``Before 
I knew it, I felt that I was hit,'' he said. In Jerusalem, a spokesman 
for the Israeli military declined to comment on the incident. The 
Israeli navy routinely patrols southern Lebanese waters to guard against 
sea-borne attacks by Lebanese guerrillas. The patrols tend to increase 
as skirmishes escalate between guerrillas and Israeli forces in the 
occupied zone. The Mediterranean port of Tyre, 30 kilometers (18 miles) 
north of the Israeli border, has been under ``virtual siege'' by Israeli 
gunboats since Friday, said Lebanese officials, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. Also Saturday, Israeli warplanes flew low over several 
villages in the western Bekaa Valley just north of the Israeli-occupied 
zone. Lebanese army anti-aircraft guns and guerrillas fired on the 
Israeli aircraft, said the officials. On Friday, guerrillas of the 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah group attacked an outpost of a pro-Israeli 
militia, wounding one militiaman. Israeli warplanes have attacked 
suspected guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon almost daily since early 
November. Hezbollah is engaged in a guerrilla war to oust 1,500 Israeli 
troops and 2,500 militiamen from the zone that Israel established 
in 1985 to protect its northern border towns from guerrilla attacks.
