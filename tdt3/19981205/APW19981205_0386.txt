An international donors' conference meant to bankroll Croatian reconstruction 
ended Saturday with commitments of only about dlrs 25 million _ approximately 
10 percent of the target. Foreign Minister Mate Granic expressed regret 
that there was not ``more significant support from the international 
community.'' Almost 50 countries and 27 organizations took part in 
the two-day event meant to finance reconstruction of war-damaged regions 
and revive the stagnating economy. The pledges fell far short of the 
estimated dlrs 2.5 billion needed to cover the fundamental costs of 
reconstruction. Some of the reluctance appeared tied to the perception 
that Croatia continues to discriminate against its ethnic Serb minority. 
Croatia's Serbs rebelled and took control of a third of the country 
in 1991, but were defeated by the Croatian army in 1995. Hundreds 
of thousands of civilians were left homeless, and more than 170,000 
dwellings were destroyed, along with other property. The United States 
and the World Bank are Croatia's most important aid sources. Between 
them, they account for up to dlrs 350 million a year in donations 
and loans.
