NEWARK, N.J. _ ``It's a good time to be out of Washington,'' Bill 
Bradley was saying two hours after he held a news conference to announce 
his yearning to return there as President in the year 2001. The former 
New Jersey senator was referring to the excruciating year that has 
put President Clinton on the brink of impeachment, forcing Bradley 
and any other candidate to wonder whether a presidential run is worth 
the trouble. As if offering the first chicken-in-every-pot enticement 
of a fresh political season, he suggested a way for the next field 
of candidates to deal with the Clinton scandal that many Americans 
might find refreshing, if the polls are to be believed. ``You don't,'' 
Bradley said. ``You turn the page. You move on. This is not about 
the past; it's about the future.'' And, with a slight, confident smile, 
the candidate moved on to the issues that intrigue him: impoverished 
children, racial divisions, health care, the working family's life. 
For a politician once tagged as a waffler on the subject of running 
for president, Bradley seems brimming with certainty this time, describing 
his new exploratory committee as the necessary ``training camp'' for 
the full political season that he firmly predicts will include him. 
He has been considering all the factors, he says, from catching Vice 
President Al Gore, who has a head start for the Democratic nomination, 
to raising the $20 million or so it takes to make a serious challenge. 
He would entertain no doubts as he leaned back in his office, already 
kinetic with campaign advisers and clutter, and talked enthusiastically 
of forming his team, running his plays, barnstorming the country. 
``I'm at the top of my game,'' said Bradley, 55, a former New York 
Knick basketball star, his campaign mantra already clear as he repeats 
this assertion for one and all, as if answering a skeptical newspaper 
headline taped outside: ``He Got Game?'' The scholar-athlete tensions 
and self-doubts that some said marked Bradley as senator seemed determinedly 
banished; candidate Bradley talks of running all out, enthusiastic 
as a gym rat, not a jot of equivocation in sight. ``Look, you go out 
and tell the people what you believe,'' he said, summarizing his uphill 
task as if diagraming a play. ``You know why you're doing it. You're 
at peace with yourself. You respect the wisdom of the American people. 
That's the sequence of the things that you do.'' When he left in 1996 
after 18 years in the Senate, the New Jersey Democrat sourly pronounced 
the political system ``broken.'' But he talked, too, of personal burnout 
after a career in which he twice openly mused about a presidential 
run but turned away. In the interlude, he has taught, written, politicked 
for other candidates and, he said, regained his competitor's edge. 
``I always believe you listen to that inner voice,'' said Bradley, 
a former Rhodes scholar. ``Now I'm back and it says, `Go.' So I'm 
going.'' He still harbors some of the old anxieties about the nastiness 
and invasiveness of a presidential run that put him off in 1988 and 
1992, he acknowledged. In his political memoir, ``Time Present, Time 
Past,'' he wrote, ``Sometimes I feel that I'm living during a political 
era in which what I value most, character, is endangered; what I admire 
most, humanity, is devalued; and what I feel most sensitive about, 
privacy, is denied.'' But as he talked, Bradley's wariness about the 
bear-pit nature of politics seemed no match for his appetite to finally 
run plain and straight for the White House. ``That's either a fever 
that's going to break,'' he said of the character vetting and attacking 
that seem to dominate modern campaigning, ``or it's an unfortunate 
continuing aspect of the environment.'' He seemed to be treating it 
as a bruising dynamic of the game that he could handle. ``The way 
you deal with that is to be yourself,'' said the man once known for 
setting stinging body blocks. In Friday's announcement speech, which 
campaign aides say Bradley painstakingly composed himself over the 
last two months, the candidate promised ``a type of leadership that 
doesn't stand in the spotlight as much as call attention to millions 
of Americans who shine.'' The ``spotlight'' allusion touched on the 
marketing challenge for Bradley's campaign team: how to artfully contrast 
the sensational celebrity-cum-notoriety of Clinton with Bradley's 
quieter political professionalism. ``We think he offers authenticity,'' 
said one Bradley strategist, hoping voters sense this as a welcome 
relief. Bradley shrugs off any shortcoming in a celebrity flash. He 
promises nothing more than himself and a considerable assortment of 
ideas. ``I have a clear sense of what I want to do,'' he said, ``and 
in a very fundamental sense, it's the right time for me to run.'' 
Even as he plunges back in, he flatly states what is wrong with politics. 
``There's too much money,'' he said, ``the media is often too superficial 
and sensational, and not enough politicians speak from their core 
convictions.'' On his first day of running, Bradley emphasized that 
his ``exploratory'' status was merely the initial requisite of what 
he expects will be a full campaign. ``Been to New Hampshire, been 
to Iowa,'' he noted, smiling at the inevitable nuts-and-bolts questions. 
He has no operation yet in either place, but his strategists promise 
to be ready in time for the front-loaded primary calendar of the 2000 
campaign. ``There's no kind of magic that you use,'' Bradley said, 
insisting that he was undaunted at the task of rapidly creating a 
credible campaign machine. ``You just go out there and tell the country 
what you believe.'' There is far more to it than that, and Bradley 
has been seeing to the details for months, with names of more than 
300 friends and operatives, for example, on one special announcement 
list he personally attended to, aides said. The campaign manager is 
Gina Glantz, whose experience goes back to the Walter Mondale campaign 
of 1984. Douglas Berman, former New Jersey state treasurer, is campaign 
chairman. The deputy manager is the former chief of staff to North 
Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, Ed Turlington, who has been scouting the trail 
on behalf of Bradley's Presidential bid since he left the Senate. 
The treasurer is Ted Wells, a criminal lawyer and longtime Bradley 
adviser. Already at the candidate's side is Anita Dunn, who was the 
senator's chief of staff, and Eric Hauser, another former staff member. 
When asked about Iowa, the early caucus stop in the campaign, Bradley 
tells of being an 11-year-old Little Leaguer in the regional championship 
game in Keokuk. ``I'm on first and we're trailing by a run,'' he recalled. 
``I take a step off the base, the guy does the hidden-ball trick and, 
bang, we lose.'' Bill Bradley, the legendary unsmiling competitor, 
beamed for perhaps the only time at the memory of losing. ``Ever since, 
I've dreamed of going back to Iowa and winning one,'' he said, his 
hustings act obviously ready. ``So here we are.''
