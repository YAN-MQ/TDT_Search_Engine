They're the No-Replay Nine _ the nine National Football League clubs 
that voted ``no'' last March on reinstalling instant replay as an 
officiating tool. But now Ralph Wilson, the owner of the Buffalo Bills, 
already annoyed at Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's intention to fine 
him $50,000 for critical comments about officiating, is leaning toward 
voting for instant replay next season. ``I certainly will look at 
it,'' Wilson said. ``Not the way we had it before, but a modified 
form, maybe with some sort of coaches' challenge.'' Wilson was still 
steaming over two controversial calls in the Bills' 25-21 loss to 
the Patriots last Sunday in New England _ a fourth-down completion 
when a replay showed the Patriot receiver out of bounds, and pass 
interference in the end zone that enabled Drew Bledsoe to throw the 
winning touchdown pass after the ball was put on the 1-yard line with 
no time on the clock. ``Instant replay would not have applied to the 
pass-interference call,'' Wilson said, ``but it would have negated 
the fourth-down completion on that final drive. We would've had the 
ball. And the game.'' That is the value of instant replay: to right 
a wrong. It is easy to say that officials' mistakes are part of the 
game, but if some of those mistakes can be corrected, they should 
be. If that means the game takes a few more minutes, so be it. With 
its eight-year, $17.6 billion television contract through 2005, the 
NFL never mentions how television timeouts for commercials stall and 
lengthen a game. At the NFL meeting last March, the vote was 21-9 
in favor of instant replay, but at least 23 yes votes were needed 
for the required 75 percent. In addition to the Bills, the No-Replay 
Nine were the Giants, Arizona, Chicago, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Oakland, 
San Diego and Tampa Bay. With the expansion Cleveland Browns franchise 
voting next year, 24 votes will be needed, but the Browns' hierarchy 
(the former 49er executives Carmen Policy and Dwight Clark) cast the 
49ers' vote for instant replay. If all the yes votes remain yes, instant 
replay would need only the Bills, the Browns and another member of 
the No-Replay Nine to switch votes. But the vote also would depend 
on the form of instant replay up for approval. Last March, it involved 
each coach being able to challenge two calls in a game; if a call 
was not reversed, the challenging team lost a timeout. ``I think it 
will pass this time,'' one NFL executive said on the condition of 
anonymity. ``Most of the coaches want it.'' Although instant replay 
is not used to correct calls during a game, officiating executives 
at NFL headquarters use it to review the calls in every game. In viewing 
this season's first 165 games, they cited 42 calls that deserved to 
be reversed, according to Greg Aiello, its vice president for public 
relations. That's an average of approximately one every four games. 
Over the six-season span from 1986 to 1991 when instant replay was 
used, 376 calls were reversed, including 38 calls that were judged 
later to have been reversed incorrectly. ``Was I disappointed at our 
Super Bowl losses? Yes,'' Wilson said, ``but we lost to better teams. 
But last Sunday, I was really distressed because we deserved to win 
that game. You're not supposed to say anything, but I don't want to 
be a Mr. Milquetoast. Oh, a tough break, again. And there have been 
some other calls the last few years.'' That's the real issue: the 
calls that instant replay might have corrected. Wilson, who lives 
in the Detroit area, mentioned the Lions' end-zone interception (replays 
showed the Lion cornerback bobbling the ball as he went out of bounds) 
that contributed to knocking the Jets out of a spot in the playoffs 
last season. He also cited some questionable calls, not merely the 
controversial overtime coin toss, in the Lions' 19-16 loss to the 
Pittsburgh Steelers on Thanksgiving Day. ``I've been watching pro 
football since the Lions came to Detroit from Portsmouth, Ohio, in 
1934,'' the now 80-year-old Wilson said. ``I've always believed the 
game should be officiated on the field, but now I'm not so sure.'' 
The Bills' loss was another NFL embarrassment. After the Indianapolis 
Colts lost, 34-31, in San Francisco earlier this season, the NFL publicly 
``apologized'' to Coach Jim Mora and the Colts for incorrect pass-interference 
and defensive-holding penalties against the Colts that contributed 
to the 49ers' rally. Those calls against the Colts would not have 
been subject to further review on instant replay. And the apology 
didn't alter the result, but the NFL was embarrassed. And now the 
Bills' loss has embarrassed it again. The No-Replay Nine is watching.
