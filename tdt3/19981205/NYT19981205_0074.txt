Milton Kaufman never planned on a government career when he was growing 
up in New York's Coney Island in the 1920s. Working at Steeplechase 
amusement park, he dreamed of becoming a mathematics teacher. But 
after he graduated from the City University of New York with a master's 
degree in mathematics in 1933, the government was the only place hiring. 
Schools could not afford to hire new teachers in the Depression. ``When 
I graduated from college, I couldn't get a job anywhere else,'' Kaufman 
said. ``At that time, I couldn't even get a job at Macy's.'' A tall, 
gentle man, who wears a suit and tie on the job and off, Kaufman retired 
this fall after 64 years of service at the Census Bureau. He shared 
the distinction of having the longest tenure of any active federal 
employee, according to the Commerce Department. With a sharp memory 
for dates and, not surprisingly, numbers, he is quick to recount his 
years of service in the government, recalling specific days and months 
from the 1940s as if they were the day before yesterday. His first 
job in 1933 was for the Works Progress Administration, an agency created 
under President Franklin D. Roosevelt to preserve job skills and lower 
the country's unemployment rate. Kaufman and about 100 other mathematicians 
conducted actuarial work for the government, at $18 a week. The WPA 
work provided Kaufman with a job when many of his friends were struggling 
to earn enough money to buy food for their families. On July 1, 1934, 
he was hired by the Census Bureau, part of the Commerce Department, 
and officially became a government employee. His 64-year tenure is 
counted from then. His professional career mirrors the evolving history 
of the country. While he worked at the Census Bureau, the United States' 
population more than doubled, rising to 270,913,356 when he retired 
from 126,373,773 in 1934. More than 80 percent of the country's current 
population had not been born when Kaufman, now 87, was hired by the 
Census Bureau. Kaufman moved to the bureau's newly formed Foreign 
Trade Division in 1942. He remained in the same office for 56 years. 
Kaufman vividly recalls his first project for the division, a daunting 
job of moving the divisional office from New York City to its current 
Washington headquarters. At that time, five people worked in the Washington 
office. As perhaps a sign of the times, now there are nearly 150 employees, 
Kaufman said. After the United States entered World War II, one of 
Kaufman's first assignments was to help prepare a classified report 
with a detailed listing of export cargo carried on vessels sunk by 
enemy action. ``Most of the operations during the War were part of 
the Lend-Lease program, giving cargo to allies,'' he said. ``Russia 
still owes us billions of dollars they haven't paid back.'' After 
the war, Kaufman's files were photographed and sent to Russia and 
archives in the United States. The U.S. government hopes that someday 
the report will ``be used to get the payment back,'' Kaufman said, 
``but I won't live to see that.'' During this period, the bureau's 
statistics were tabulated by a machine, the Remington Rand tabulator, 
a predecessor to the IBM computers statisticians use now, Kaufman 
said. During the 1950s, the Census Bureau made calculations on a Univac 
computer that took up an entire room. In the 1940s Kaufman was hired 
by W. Edwards Deming (who gained fame as a management theorist) to 
teach statistics in night classes sponsored by the Agriculture Department, 
and Kaufman stayed loyal for a generation to what had been his first 
career dream _ teaching. ``When I started teaching kids of students 
I taught, I realized it was time to leave,'' he said, laughing. Kaufman 
stepped down from his second job in 1965. Kaufman's work at the bureau 
focused on economic indicators to calculate the balance of trade in 
goods and services. He collected numbers to compile indicators of 
the country's exports and imports. He rose to the rank of senior foreign 
trade statistician. If it were not for the passing of a repeal on 
the mandatory retirement age, pushed for by Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., 
Kaufman might have been forced to retire earlier. After working for 
nearly two-thirds of a century, Kaufman seems surprised to find that 
he enjoys his early retirement. But if he had not suffered from a 
heart attack almost a year and a half ago, he says, he probably would 
have continued to work. ``I'd have no reason to stop,'' Kaufman said. 
``No Florida for me.'' ``I took one day at a time,'' he said. ``I 
kept on enjoying what I was doing and kept doing it.'' His colleague 
Bruce Walter, a senior statistician in the Foreign Trade Division, 
says Kaufman has ``enough energy to work forever.'' Walter assumed 
Kaufman's position at a young 58 years old and has no plans to continue 
his predecessor's legacy. He has already planned his retirement. Kaufman's 
job advice is simple. ``Always be good to your employees,'' he said. 
``They may be your boss someday. I've seen it happen over and over 
again.'' Since he has no plans for the immediate future, his wife, 
also in her 80s, is getting used to having him around the house more 
often. And his only son, Hugh, an investigator with the Environmental 
Protection Agency, has no plans to follow in his father's footsteps. 
``I got a call from the head of the press office, who heard about 
my father on the radio,'' he said, laughing. ``So he says to me, `Are 
you going to try to do that? Are we going to have 30 more years of 
this?''' ``Part of his enjoyment of life is giving back to people. 
Having gone through the Depression, he has a whole different mindset,'' 
Hugh Kaufman said. ``His generation is a very unique generation and 
because he's stubborn, he never changed with the times.''
