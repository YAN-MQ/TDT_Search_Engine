A federal jury in Manhattan has awarded $750,000 to the family of 
a 5-year old boy killed by an air bag. Yesterday, jurors ruled Daimler-Chrysler 
was 50% responsible for Michael crespo's death during a family vacation 
to Puerto Rico in 1995. This case is the first of its kind to reach 
trial. Daimler-Chrysler is denouncing the verdict. It says crespo's 
father drove their rented minivan the wrong way on a Street and hit 
another car head on. The company says the boy would have lived, had 
his father made sure he was wearing a seat belt.
