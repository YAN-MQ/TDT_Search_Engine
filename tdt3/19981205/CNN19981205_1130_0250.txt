President Clinton says a new system of instant background checks is 
keeping guns out of the wrong hands. In his weekly radio address, 
he said he also intends to push Congress next year to pass a stiffer 
law requiring a waiting period of several days before handgun sales 
become final. The new system may have already saved lives. In its 
first four days, new national instant check system reviewed more than 
100,000 prospective gun sales to make sure only law-abiding citizens 
took home the guns. And in just four days, we stopped more than 400 
felons, fugitives, stalkers and other prohibited purchasers from walking 
away with new guns. President Clinton is attending the funeral in 
Arkansas today of his friend and former chief of staff, Maurice Smith.
