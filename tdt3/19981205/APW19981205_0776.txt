Army vs. Navy is supposed to more than just a game, but not like this. 
Army beat Navy 34-30 in one of American college football's greatest 
rivalries Saturday, but the highest-scoring game in the 99-year history 
of the series was marred by an accident in which nine people fell 
out of the stands and were injured. The accident occurred after Ty 
Amey's 70-yard touchdown run gave Army a 31-30 lead. A railing behind 
the east end zone gave way, and Army cadets and prep students fell 
about 4 1-2 meters (15 feet) onto the playing field. The extent of 
the injuries wasn't immediately known. After a 31-minute delay, Eric 
Olsen's 26-yard field goal provided the final margin as Army (3-8) 
avenged last year's 39-7 loss to Navy (3-8) at Giants Stadium near 
New York City. The 64 points broke the previous record of 55, reached 
in 1959 and 1983. Army came back from a 30-19 deficit at the start 
of the fourth quarter, preventing the Midshipmen from winning consecutive 
games in the series for the first time since 1982-83. It was Army's 
sixth victory in the last seven years, and the sixth game in the 1990s 
decided by fewer than five points. But the scary accident cast a somber 
tone over the postgame celebration. The uniformed fans were cheering 
for television cameras after Army took a 31-30 lead on Amey's 70-yard 
TD run with 7:33 left in the game. A railing in front of the first 
row of seats gave way, causing the personnel to fall. Several stretchers 
were summoned, and the game was suspended with 6:08 left as four ambulances 
drove onto the field. The injured were four cadets from the U.S. Military 
Academy in West Point, New York, and five students from the academy's 
prep school in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, said Army's sports information 
department. Gerald Ravitz, father of Army co-captain Neil Ravitz, 
was on the field and said he saw the first person to hit the ground. 
``It could have been my kid in the stands,'' said Ravitz, in tears. 
Amey rushed 13 times for 134 yards, and Craig Stucker had seven rushes 
for 106 yards for Army, whose No. 1-rated rushing offense amassed 
401 yards. The comeback and the collapsed railings overshadowed a 
record-breaking performance by Navy's Ryan Read, whose 128 pass receiving 
yards were the most ever in the series, which began in 1890. Read's 
69-yard TD reception from Brian Broadwater in the second quarter was 
the longest pass play in series history. It was Navy's longest pass 
play in this game since Roger Staubach, who later went on to play 
professionally with the Dallas Cowboys, hit Nick Markoff for 65 yards 
in 1962. Read's three catches for 128 yards broke an 84-year-old record 
held by Army's Lou Merillat, who had 115 yards in the 1914 game. Broadwater 
was 7-for-17 for 188 yards. Army's Joe Gerena, a sophomore who relieved 
Johnny Goff after the senior fumbled twice, rushed for 92 yards.
