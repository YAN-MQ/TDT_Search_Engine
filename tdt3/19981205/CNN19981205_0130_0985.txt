Some people are saying schools are giving up a lot in exchange for 
thousands of dollars worth of free computers. Susan Lisovicz has the 
story. You can start reading to see what the next one is so that you'll 
know which link to go to. This California computer lab is wired with 
thousands of dollars of free, cutting-edge equipment. While the students 
learn to surf the net, the companies that provided the equipment are 
learning something about them. Microsoft, Compaq, Intel and other 
participating companies in the zapme! Netspace can access data gathered 
on the students as a way to market to them. Most retailers, most distributors 
and manufacturers spend millions of dollars every year to find out 
what type of money is available in a Particular community, what the 
interests are, the age mix, the employment mix, things like that. 
That's just a basic cost of doing business for most companies. Zapme! 
Also carries online advertising targeted at kids, not unlike channel 
one, the controversial cable channel used in more than 12,000 schools. 
Critics say zapme! Is simply a cyberspace variation of corporate predators 
in the classroom. Zapme! Is set up to snoop and survey children as 
they browse on the Internet, and to send that data to advertisers 
and marketers, who will then use it to hone their advertising and 
marketing practices even better. And that's just wrong. But those 
concerns are secondary to some schools, which may be hard-pressed 
to provide even the most basic of resources. Zapme! Says its network 
of 15 high-speed computers translates into $9,500 of free equipment 
a month. We've had a very overwhelmingly positive response to the 
zapme! Netspace. In the first 90 days, over 9,000 schools in America 
have applied for the zapme! Netspace. The interest in zapme! Underscores 
the growing role the Internet is playing in the classroom. The question 
is, is that important role that it will be playing, will it have a 
sponsorship component in it or won't it? Zapme! Says it expects to 
have 100 schools online by the end of the year. Susan Lisovicz, "CNN 
Financial News," New York.
