She inspired millions of adventurers and then she was gone. But DNA 
technology finally may help solve an old mystery. What happened to 
amelia Earhart? Rick Lockridge has more in this edition of "tech trends." 
She fascinated the people in her own time, and was someone admired 
and emulated and seen as a model for young women. And that is why 
we still care. 'cause we're still fascinated with her. The air and 
space museum's Tom crouch has heard lots of theories about what happened 
to amelia Earhart, the celebrated aviatrix who disappeared, along 
with her navigator, over the south pacific on July 2nd, 1937. Now, 
there's a new theory. That bones measured by the British on a small 
atoll nearly 60 years ago represent the proof that Earhart's final 
flight and life ended on a place called nikumaroro. And with the better 
techniques available today, we can see that there is not only a likelihood, 
but a probability that it was a person more or less of Earhart's description. 
The bones in question are nowhere to be found. But the recently re-evaluated 
measurements of those bones suggest a tall northern European woman. 
And back then, there were no recorded female inhabitants of nikumaroro. 
Now, if the researchers could find just one of those bones -- All 
we need is one. To do a mitochondrial DNA match. And then we'd know. 
If you find one of those, that's a smoking gun. The next step -- yet 
another canvass of nikumaroro. More detective work for those who would 
solve the mystery. Rick Lockridge, CNN.
