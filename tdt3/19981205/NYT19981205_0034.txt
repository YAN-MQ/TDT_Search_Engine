One moment, San Francisco 49ers tackle Bryant Young was arguably the 
best defensive player in football; the next, after a brutal collision 
with a teammate, he was in the back of an ambulance, speeding toward 
Stanford Hospital with two broken bones in his lower right leg and 
damaged knee ligaments. By his side was the 49ers' owner, Eddie DeBartolo, 
holding Young's hand, telling him everything would be all right. Losing 
Young was yet another blow to what has been one of the most successful 
sports franchises of the last 20 years. Any legitimate chance the 
49ers had of making a deep playoff run probably evaporated when Young's 
leg was crushed under a mass of bodies. ``He was the m.v.p. of this 
team,'' running back Garrison Hearst said. ``We're definitely going 
to miss him.'' But while the franchise has suffered its share of devastating 
news in the last two years _ and losing Young for the rest of the 
season, and possibly part of next season, is about as bad as it gets 
_ it has shown impressive resilience. There are other teams that would 
have crumbled under the pressure, but the 49ers remain in the thick 
of the playoff race at 9-3, and with three of their last four games 
against bad teams _ at Carolina and at home against Detroit and St. 
Louis _ they could still get a home post-season game. The team is 
almost assured of a 10-victory season, which would be its 16th in 
a row, extending its own National Football League record. And all 
this despite more bumps in the road than Jerry Rice career touchdowns. 
``We've been through some tough times recently,'' Coach Steve Mariucci 
said. _ DeBartolo, who has five Super Bowl rings, is still not involved 
in the daily operation of the team after turning over control to his 
sister, Denise DeBartolo York. The 49ers' owner was the target of 
federal prosecutors this year in a Louisiana gambling probe _ he pleaded 
guilty in October to failing to report a felony _ and the league asked 
him to remain inactive until its own investigation is concluded. The 
49ers have been rudderless without him. _ Carmen Policy recently stepped 
down after spending seven years as chief executive officer. Considered 
one of the best salary cap specialists in football, he now runs the 
new Cleveland franchise. _ Dwight Clark, the director of football 
operations, resigned this month to join Policy with the Browns. He 
earned respect as a personnel man in just four seasons. Clark had 
hoped to be team president one day, but he had been given indications 
by ownership that that would not happen, so he left. John McVay is 
now in charge of personnel decisions and player signings. _ Mariucci, 
who has proved to be one of the bright young coaches in the league, 
has been offered a multiyear contract extension, but he has yet to 
sign it. Why? Mariucci wants to have a more active role in certain 
decisions, like the final say on the draft, and wants some safeguards 
built in to protect him against the club's uncertain future. Look 
for Mariucci to sign an extension through 2005 any day now, in which 
case Green Bay's Mike Holmgren would probably not return to the 49ers 
in any capacity. ``I've been asked to do a job and coach this football 
team,'' Mariucci said. ``So that's the A-No. 1 priority. If the club 
expects or hopes that I would take on additional responsibilities, 
then I'm willing to do that.'' _ As if the 49ers have not had enough 
problems, now comes worry over the psyche of linebacker Ken Norton. 
It was his helmet that hit Young's leg, while Norton was diving for 
Giants quarterback Kent Graham. Norton is not to blame, but teammates 
say he has been extremely disturbed all week. Norton was also involved 
in hits on the former Oakland Raiders running back Napoleon McCallum 
and the former 49ers defensive lineman Richard Dent. Each of those 
player's careers was never the same. ``No, I guess I don't want to 
see it ever again,'' Norton said when asked if he would look at the 
replay of his collision with Young. ``The way he screamed, the pain 
I knew he was in, that was enough for me.'' Through all these dizzying 
events, the 49ers have churned along. They have not been dominant, 
but they have been good. Over the past two years under Mariucci, the 
team is 22-6. The 49ers are also 15-0 at home in the regular season 
with Mariucci as coach. That's impressive. The question for the 49ers 
is how long they can stay at this high level with so much chaos around 
them. The next several drafts could determine their immediate future 
on the field. The team definitely needs to draft a quarterback to 
replace Steve Young, who is 37. Last year's No. 1 draft pick, quarterback 
Jim Druckenmiller, has struggled. What happens in the front office 
is even more important. They need to find the next guru, another Bill 
Walsh. Whatever happens, this summer could be the most crucial off 
season in 49ers history.
