A 28-year-old man today completed the final leg of his quest to run 
the length of Africa from Capetown to Cairo. Nicholas Bourne began 
his journey on January 21st. Sponsored by two charities, he ran 6,200 
miles across from one of the continent all the way to the other. Bourne's 
mother said he made the run to help starving children and protect 
endangered wildlife. His sister and four other people supported his 
journey in trucks carrying water and other supplies.
