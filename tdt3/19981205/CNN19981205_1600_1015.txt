Boeing, which had already said it would eliminate 28,000 jobs, announced 
plans to slash 20,000 more. In all, the world's largest commercial 
aircraftmaker is reducing its workforce by some 20% over the next 
two years, as the Asian economic crisis forces it to cut production. 
The first pink slips went out this week. And Johnson & Johnson, amid 
a major sales slump, said it's eliminating 4,100 jobs, more than 4% 
of its workforce, and closing 36 factories. Amid all that, some surprising 
good news on unemployment -- the labor department reported this week 
the jobless rate fell to just 4.4% in november.
