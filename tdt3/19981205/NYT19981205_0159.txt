Here is how New York's College Savings Program works: The donor opens 
an account by filling out a form and sending in a check for at least 
$250, or by agreeing to have $25 a month deducted from his checking 
account. The donor names a beneficiary, who can receive up to $100,000 
in contributions. The money goes into three funds managed by TIAA-CREF, 
private pension managers, who divide the account based on the beneficiary's 
age. As of January, accounts opened for newborns will have 45 percent 
invested in bonds and 55 percent in stocks, and those for anyone over 
16 will have 40 percent in bonds, 10 percent in stocks and 50 percent 
in money market funds. TIAA-CREF takes 0.65 percent of the assets 
each year to cover its costs. The donor can deduct up to $5,000 of 
his contribution from the income on which the state levies taxes. 
Married couples must open accounts separately, but can deduct up to 
$10,000 from their joint tax return. The money must remain in the 
program for three years. During that time, there are no state or federal 
taxes on the investment gains. When the beneficiary is ready to use 
the money, it can be withdrawn and sent to any accredited school in 
the nation; in many cases, it can also be used for room and board, 
as well as books and equipment. The beneficiary must pay Federal taxes 
on the money used, but there is no state tax. If the money is withdrawn 
early, or not used for education, the donor must pay state and federal 
taxes, as well as a program penalty of 1 percent of all investment 
gains. But there is no limit on how long money can remain in the program, 
and the beneficiary can be changed to another member of the same family.
