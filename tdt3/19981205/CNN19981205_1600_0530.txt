This is Orelon Sidney with the "CNN Headline News" weather update. 
A cold front moving through the southern plains and the Great Lakes 
will mean a chance of showers and snow mixed across most of that region. 
Thunderstorms will spread toward the gulf coast with some storms possibly 
severe across the lower gulf coast and into the central plains on 
Sunday. An area of low pressure moves through the Rockies. But we 
continue to watch the next pacific storm system approach from the 
gulf of Alaska. High temperatures will be in the 20s, 30s and 40s 
across most of the western U.S. on Sunday. Temperatures will still 
be warm through the Great Lakes, southward through the Tennessee and 
the Ohio river valleys into the gulf coast. Southern Florida and the 
Florida keys will see highs in the 80s. The extended forecast on Monday 
includes a chance of thunderstorms, some showers possible in New England. 
Look for heavy rainfall on the northwest coast and snowfall inland 
as we head through Tuesday. A few thunderstorms may linger along the 
gulf coast as cold temperatures spread through the Great Lakes. Temperatures 
will be drastically cooler for the north. On Wednesday, look for snow 
showers in the west. The extended forecast is at CNN.com.
