South Korean Kang Wook-soon fired a 4-under-par 66 Saturday to extend 
his lead to four strokes over Taiwan's Hsieh Chin-sheng after the 
third round of the U.S. dlrs 500,000 Omega PGA Championship. Kang, 
who won the Hong Kong Golf Open last Sunday, carded four birdies over 
the 6,096-yard Clear Bay Golf and Country Club for a three-round 13-under-par 
197. ``I am hitting the ball better than ever at the moment.'' said 
Kang, who is favorite to win this year's Omega Order of Merit. If 
Kang wins on Sunday, he will become the first player in Asian PGA 
history to win back-to-back events. Hsieh shot a 3-under-par 67 to 
finish at 201, one stroke ahead of Thailand's Boonchu Ruangkit and 
China's Zhang Lianwei. The Thai returned a 66 on Saturday, while Zhang 
had a 68. Another stroke behind were Australian Brad Andrews and Carlos 
Espinosa of Mexico. Andrews had a 68 and Espinosa carded a 69 to tie 
for joint 5th at 203.
