With his open, unlined face, Nursultan Nazarbayev talks like a man 
without a care, as might any entrenched ruler of a resource-rich nation 
courted by powerful world leaders. Yet one thing does plainly bother 
the dapper former Communist Party leader, who has ruled since 1989 
over this vast republic in the Caspian Sea region, an area attracting 
the interest of Washington and some of the world's biggest companies 
because of its huge oil and gas reserves. While the 58-year-old president 
is firmly in control at home, where he is expected soon to win a new 
seven-year term by the usual 90 percent margin, he is puzzled by recent 
foreign accusations that he is a power-hungry leader who terrorizes 
opponents. ``Fifteen hundred companies are working here and no one 
wants a different president,'' he told a small group of journalists 
on a recent tour of the northern industrial heartland of this country 
of 17 million. ``Do you understand this? Write about it.'' Diplomats 
agree that Kazakhstan's politics are mild by regional standards. Across 
the sea in Azerbaijan, for instance, the police have repeatedly used 
violence to disperse opposition rallies. In November, Parliament set 
three-year jail terms for taking part in such gatherings. The New 
York-based group Human Rights Watch last week denounced Azerbaijan 
President Heydar Aliyev's human rights record as ``dismal,'' and said 
his recent decrees ordering improvements ``were merely window dressing.'' 
Yet foreign criticism of Nazarbayev is rising. Last week, the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors voting in the 
region, expressed ``serious doubts that the principles for democratic 
elections'' would be met in Kazakhstan, and called on Nazarbayev to 
postpone the Jan. 10 election. Under the circumstances, the organization 
said in its statement, it would not send a full team of election monitors. 
A week earlier, the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, accused 
Kazakhstan of a ``pattern of harassment'' of Nazarbayev's opponents. 
Nazarbayev probably would easily win a free election, but Western 
experts note that he still does not let anyone serious run against 
him and has a habit of padding the vote to obtain Soviet-era victory 
margins. ``We now use the term `the 90 percenters' to refer to the 
whole bunch'' of Caspian leaders, said Peter Sinnott, an expert on 
the region at Columbia University. On Nov. 24, Kazakhstan's Supreme 
Court excluded former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, 46, from 
the elections because he met with a political group not registered 
with the government. Kazhegeldin, a former prime minister forced from 
office in October 1997, is among the few Caspian opposition leaders 
seen as a credible alternative to an incumbent president. The ruling 
against him came a day after Gore telephoned President Nazarbayev 
voicing concern about treatment of opponents. Kazhegeldin has hired 
Washington lawyers and public relations people to try to shift the 
campaign abroad and make Nazarbayev appear illegitimate to Washington. 
U.S. political support helps keep investors coming and hold Russia 
at bay. The president counters by contending that Kazhegeldin is tainted 
by sweetheart oil and mineral deals he approved in his three years 
as prime minister. In the interview, the president charged that his 
rival is a ``secret KGB employee, a secret agent.'' He also asserted 
that the former prime minister organized the Sept. 26 firebombing 
of an opposition newspaper and an Oct. 13 incident in which Kazhegeldin 
says he came under gunfire. ``Don't ask me about Kazhegeldin,'' the 
president said. ``I very much wanted that he would run and receive 
his 3 or 4 percent and be disgraced.'' The president insists he is 
not a one-man ruler. He appoints officials, but they work independently, 
he said in the interview with journalists. Some university students 
may have been forced to sign petitions supporting his candidacy or 
risk failing, he conceded, but that was the work of local bureaucrats 
who were ``obviously overdoing it.'' On the streets of Almaty, there 
is no tangible fear or tension. Since the rubber-stamp Parliament 
voted to hold presidential elections two years early, however, the 
government has stepped up pressure on opponents, and increased surveillance 
of journalists. Diplomats and Western businessmen who meet him generally 
describe Nazarbayev as charming and relaxed, yet serious, a strategic 
thinker with a sharp sense of regional politics. Foreigners and Kazakhstan's 
citizens seem resigned to his maintaining control. ``He isn't a president 
anymore,'' said a middle-aged taxi driver in the industrial city of 
Aktyube, a city of 300,000 peopled dominated by Soviet-style concrete 
structures which Nazarbayev visited recently. ``He's some kind of 
a sultan. Nazarbayev is the only candidate and no one else can win. 
I don't pay attention to politics anymore.''
