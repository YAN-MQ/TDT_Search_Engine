Britain's State Prosecutor's Office says it plans to appeal a high 
court ruling that the arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, 
two weeks ago, was illegal. The court ruled that the retired general 
is immune from prosecution in Britain for alleged crimes committed 
in Chile while he was head of state. General Pinochet was placed under 
arrest by British authorities acting on an extradition request by 
a Spanish judge who wants him to stand trial for genocide and the 
torture of Spanish citizens in Chile during his 17 year rule.
