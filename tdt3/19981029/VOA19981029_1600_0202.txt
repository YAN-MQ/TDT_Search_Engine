A new United Nations report concludes that the government of Congo 
Kenshasa systematically kills and abuses the rebels challenging it 
as well as its own citizens. The study says there continue to be very 
serious violations of human rights in Congo. It accuses the government 
of taking what it termed an ethnic cleansing approach to quashing 
the insurgency which began in August.
