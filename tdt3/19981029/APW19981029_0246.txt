An explosion badly damaged a bridge two hours after King Mswati III 
crossed it, police said Thursday. Wednesday's explosion on the Lusushwana 
River bridge near Manzini could have been caused by a bomb or dynamite, 
police said. Mswati was returning from a month-long investment tour 
in the Far East. Police said they were investigating a possible connection 
to political activists who protested a 25-year-old ban on political 
parties in recent elections. Only one person was injured in the incident 
on the seldom-used bridge.
