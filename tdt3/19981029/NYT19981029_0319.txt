A scorched and moldy volume of thousand-year-old pages _ the oldest 
surviving copy of important mathematical works of Archimedes _ was 
sold at auction Thursday for $2 million, double the expected price. 
The winning bid, at Christie's of New York City, was made by Simon 
Finch, a London book dealer, who said he was acting on behalf of an 
unidentified private American collector. The seller was identified 
only as a French family that acquired the volume in the early 1920s. 
The volume includes copies of two of Archimedes' greatest works: ``Method 
of Mechanical Theorems,'' which includes ideas startlingly reminiscent 
of modern calculus, and ``On Floating Bodies,'' which puts forth his 
laws of flotation. They are in palimpsest form: that is, the original 
inked copy of Archimedes' texts, written by a 10th-century scribe, 
was washed off by Byzantine monks in the 13th century so that the 
expensive vellum on which it was written could be reused. The Archimedes 
text was made almost illegible by the washing and then covered by 
the later religious text. Christie's commissioned experts to examine 
a few pages of the manuscript, illuminating them with ultraviolet 
light and using computer programs to enhance the Archimedes text. 
The project was strikingly successful. Mathematicians believe that 
the improved text may reveal unsuspected nuances in Archimedes' scientific 
thinking. The new owner of the palimpsest (pronounced PAL-imp-sest) 
will pay $2,202,500, including commissions and taxes, and may soon 
face a lawsuit from the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem. Late 
Wednesday, Simos Dimas, a New York lawyer representing the patriarch, 
sought an injunction in U.S. District Court to block the auction and 
lay claim to the volume, on grounds that it was stolen some time after 
World War I. The judge denied the motion, and Christie's announced 
that ``our consigner has clear title to sell the manuscript.'' Dimas, 
who attended the auction, said his legal challenge would continue. 
``Under New York law, stolen property cannot be sold, even if the 
seller himself is not the thief,'' he said. ``This palimpsest is part 
of the patrimony of the patriarchate.'' Chris Rorres, a professor 
of mathematics at Drexel University, in Philadelphia, and an Archimedes 
scholar who attended the auction, expressed disappointment with the 
sale. ``It is the worst possible outcome,'' Rorres said. ``It means 
that this priceless work may once again disappear into obscurity, 
cut off from scholars who could mine its riches.'' But Felix de Maraz 
Oyens, a Christie's expert on ancient manuscripts, offered some consolation. 
De Maraz Oyens, who knows the identity of both the seller and the 
buyer, predicted that scholars would be given access to the work. 
``The buyer told me he would allow such access,'' he said. ``I cannot 
tell you who it is, except to say that it is not Bill Gates.'' Bill 
Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., has bought several valuable manuscripts, 
including the Leicester Codex, a notebook of Leonardo da Vinci. Archimedes, 
the greatest mathematical genius of antiquity, is particularly admired 
by modern mathematicians for having devised a method that prefigured 
the invention of calculus for computing relationships between geometrical 
objects. His laws of flotation dictate the design of ships and define 
the concept of specific gravity. Archimedes was slain by a Roman soldier 
during the sack of Syracuse in 212 B.C. Isaac Newton invented modern 
calculus some 19 centuries later, presumably drawing from Archimedes' 
ideas.
