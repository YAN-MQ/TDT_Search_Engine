I don't know what happens down the line, but the day is beautiful. 
I can't describe it. Tonight the excited voice of a 77-year-old astronaut 
on his second and final mission in space. The launch that stopped 
people in their tracks in American city streets and lit up the sky 
here at the Kennedy space center in Florida. Tonight John Glenn is 
once again in orbit.
