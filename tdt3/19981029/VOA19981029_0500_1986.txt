The report of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission is 
to be released today as scheduled. A high court has rejected a request 
from the ruling African National Congress to block the report's publication. 
The ANC claimed the report unfairly blames it for human rights abuses 
during the struggle against apartheid. The 3,500 page report will 
be released to journalists ahead of its formal presentation later 
today. Commission Chairman retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu will present 
the human rights document to South African President Nelson Mandela. 
The Deputy Chairman of the Commission called the court's decision 
a victory for truth and human rights in South Africa.
