Fixing CBS Corp. will not be easy. But investors in the company that 
owns the storied television network appear to have faith that Mel 
Karmazin, the newly chosen chairman and chief executive, has the ability 
to do it. CBS shares jumped 10.3 percent Thursday to $28, the highest 
level in six weeks, in the aftermath of the company's announcement 
Wednesday that Karmazin, who had been president, would take over as 
chairman and chief executive when Michael H. Jordan retires Jan. 1. 
Although Karmazin's elevation to the top job wasn't a surprise, the 
speed at which he got there was, considering he arrived at CBS less 
than two years ago, when CBS acquired his radio broadcasting company, 
and considering that Jordan hadn't been expected to retire for another 
three years, when he will turn 65. Analysts said the rise in the stock 
at least partly reflected investor relief that any doubts had now 
been eliminated about a successor to Jordan, who led Westinghouse 
Electric Corp.'s transformation from industrial conglomerate to media 
giant with the purchase of CBS four years ago. Karmazin, 55, is known 
as an aggressive cost cutter who already has made his mark on CBS. 
There also have been rumors that he might sell the television network, 
which like some other major networks has been losing money. Analysts 
said they did not think a sale was likely, but that did not preclude 
a spinoff of the radio station operations. CBS said Aug. 27 that it 
planned to sell 20 percent of its radio and billboard business to 
the public in a spinoff that would be called Infinity Broadcasting, 
the name of the radio company Karmazin sold to CBS for $3.8 billion. 
``I am willing to bet on Mel and I think there will be further restructuring 
including eventually the complete separation of TV and radio,'' said 
Dennis Leibowitz, who follows CBS for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. 
``And Mel has been someone the market is willing to bet on.'' The 
impact of Karmazin's management of the company was evident in CBS' 
third-quarter earnings, which were announced Thursday and came in 
better than expected. Net losses at the television and radio company 
fell to $43 million, from $162 million a year earlier. The loss included 
a $68 million charge to streamline television operations. Revenues 
for the entire company jumped 23 percent to $1.58 billion. And earnings 
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, an important 
measurement of a media company's performance, was a record $268 million, 
up 25.2 percent over last year. At its radio stations, revenues were 
up 42 percent to $534 million. That performance was enhanced by the 
acquisition of American Radio, which CBS acquired in June of this 
year. At the television division, excluding the one-time charge, cash 
flow rose 22 percent to $158 million. The rise in CBS stock still 
leaves it considerably below its 52-week high of $36.675, reached 
April 8. But Karmazin's promotion, coupled with the earnings results 
Thursday, left analysts more optimistic than they had been. ``There 
is a belief that with Mel as chief executive officer, the network 
will get to profitability quicker than it would have otherwise,'' 
said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I don't think 
the company is finished making cutbacks, and things happen faster 
when Mel is running the show. He is not political; he just gets things 
done.'' Several analysts said they believed the pending sale of 20 
percent of the radio and billboard business in a stock offering would 
enhance the parent company's stock. ``I think the radio operations 
will trade well, and as a result the market will look at what is left 
inside CBS and see value,'' one analyst said. ``CBS will still own 
80 percent of the radio operations. If the market values Infinity 
well, then CBS will trade better.'' Much of Wall Street's thinking 
about media companies these days has to do with how it sees companies 
positioned for a recession. Radio is more dependent on local advertising 
than on national advertising, and is expected to hold up well in an 
economic slowdown, which is viewed as increasingly likely. CBS also 
benefited from political advertising in the quarter, and Karmazin's 
costly $4 billion purchase of the rights to broadcast professional 
football on Sundays is generating some payoffs. Ratings for adults 
18 to 49, particularly males, have improved in prime time. CBS is 
also challenging NBC for leadership among total viewers in prime time. 
Not everyone is optimistic about Karmazin's ability to turn around 
the network, which is now in second place. ``It is much more complicated 
to run a television network than a radio company,'' said one media-industry 
expert, who did not want to be named. ``You have more constituencies 
and more problems, and they are harder to solve. Mel is good at selling 
and at cost cutting, but cost cutting can antagonize people and indirectly 
make new problems.''
