Nearly a dozen Palestinian policemen sealed off the area outside Yassin's 
Gaza City home and searched and questioned passers-by. Journalists 
were barred from the area. ``Sheik Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest 
for security reasons,'' the Palestinian security services announced. 
This marked the first time that Arafat is openly confronting the quadriplegic 
Hamas leader, his strongest political rival. In the past, the Palestinian 
leader has detained lower-level Hamas officials from time to time. 
However, he never touched Yassin, apparently because he wanted to 
avoid an open and possibly blood showdown with the militants. A relative 
of Yassin told The Associated Press by telephone that the Hamas leader 
had not been notified that he was barred from leaving his home. The 
man said Yassin's first appointment outside his home was Friday morning 
and had not planned to leave his home before then. Arafat also ordered 
the arrests of dozens of Hamas activists on Thursday. Two senior members, 
Mahmoud Zahar, and Ibrahim Hanieh, were among those detained.
