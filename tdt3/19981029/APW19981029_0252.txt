Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov flew Thursday to the Caucasus Mountains 
of southern Russia where he met with the leaders of several restive 
regions, including secessionist Chechnya. Primakov arrived in Vladikavkaz, 
capital of North Ossetia, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. ITAR-Tass 
said he met the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia and discussed 
a permanent settlement to 1992 fighting between ethnic Ingush and 
Ossetians. The Interfax news agency said Primakov also met with Chechen 
President Aslan Maskhadov, who wants Russia to help repair damage 
caused during their 1994-96 war. Maskhadov's press secretary, Mairbek 
Vachagayev, said they will also discuss hostage-takings and other 
crimes, which have been rampant in Chechnya since the end of the war. 
Chechen law enforcement officials are in the midst of a crackdown 
on hostage-takings. More than 100 people, including five foreigners, 
are believed to be held. The violence associated with hostage-takings 
and other crimes has often spilled over Chechnya's borders into neighboring 
regions. Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of 
the war, but no country has recognized its independence claim. Moscow 
insists the territory remains part of Russia.
