Malaysia has mothballed two massive highway projects worth dlrs 1 
billion in favor of building low-income housing, a news report said 
Thursday. Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed said the funds allotted 
for the South Klang Valley Expressway and a new airport highway would 
be channeled toward constructing cheaper accommodations. ``We have 
enough highways for now and can make do without the new highway projects 
for the time being,'' he was quoted as saying in Thursday editions 
of the New Straits Times. He said the Cabinet decided to defer the 
projects because it didn't receive any complaints from drivers who 
commuted to and from the newly built Kuala Lumpur International Airport. 
The government had initially agreed to supply soft loans worth 1 billion 
ringgit (dlrs 260 million) for these projects, which had a 33-year 
concession period. The rest of funding was supposed to have come from 
the private sector and other sources. Malaysia has fallen victim to 
a prolonged regional economic crisis and recently announced it was 
in recession, forcing it to delay numerous big-ticket building projects.
