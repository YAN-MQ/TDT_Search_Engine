John Glenn's return to space has become an enormous media event. And 
it's not the first time. Jim Moret takes a look at the role space 
has played in TV history. When sputnik shot into orbit in 1957, it 
did more than simply launch the space race. Covering the space program 
became the newest frontier for the young television networks. News 
coverage is the faucet by which the public gets to see the space program. 
Interest in the space program is probably a combination of television 
and our curiosities and fantasies about what it would be like to go 
into space, to be on the Moon. And NASA's footage fueled those fantasies. 
Godspeed, John Glenn. In 1962 John Glenn became the first American 
to orbit the earth aboard the "friendship 7" Mercury spacecraft. I 
was in the back of a station wagon out in that Marsh that is cape 
canaveral. Mosquitos buzzing about my head, rattlesnakes rattling 
around my feet, it wasn't exactly pleasant. Nor very efficient, but 
it wasn't any more primitive than the missile and the spacecraft that 
took Glenn into flight. Seven years later "Apollo 11" went to the 
Moon and Neil Armstrong literally walked into history. That's one 
small step for man -- one giant leap for mankind. It's one of the 
few things that can unite a country in terms of watching something 
and sharing an experience. The final lunar landing was in 1972. Perhaps 
the novelty began to fade. As space travel became almost predictable, 
viewers became complacent at the prospect of another routine launch. 
NASA's sort of suffered from its own success. The flights have been 
so successful over the last couple of decades that we don't pay any 
attention to them any more. In this cynical day and age, we only care 
when it goes as unexpected. It went tragically awry in 1986 when the 
shuttle challenger exploded, killing all seven astronauts aboard. 
The media coverage didn't tend to put it in the context of, "well, 
this was a risky business, and it's to be expected. That when you 
test exotic, experimental aircraft, spacecraft people get killed." 
NASA has launched 65 shuttle flights since then. Now John Glenn returns 
to space 36 years after his first flight. I think the flight is important. 
I think it's a refocusing of our attention, at least momentarily, 
on space flight, on the flights of the shuttles. Jim Moret, "CNN Entertainment 
News," Hollywood.
