If there's a natural connection in the world, it is kids and space. 
And this flight was a teacher's dream. A man who looks like their 
grandfather or, depending on their age, great-grandfather. Tonight, 
NBC's Bob Dotson and some kids who may one day get to go to Mars. 
John Glenn may be the oldest space scientist, but he's carrying the 
dreams of some of the youngest. Carrying an experiment designed by 
7-year-olds. Cool. What's it up to on the black numbers? 200. It measures 
the effect of the sun's heat in zero gravity. The temperature might 
go up. The children have filled 20 three-inch vials with popcorn, 
paper clips and crayons. I think it's going to turn taupe. Second 
graders at dowell elementary school in Marietta, Georgia, were selected 
in a competition that included college students. It was a balance 
to get something that the kids could still understand, but yet was 
scientific. I think it's going to turn out great. The kids are also 
building a nearly full-size replica of Glenn's first space capsule, 
the one that flew nearly 30 years before they were born. He takes 
lots of risks. So they have posted some last-minute reminders. Bring 
some band-AIDS. And some pillows. Be safe and may God be with you. 
NASA hopes all this will reignite interest in space, perhaps inspire 
some to become astronauts. It's kind of scary, and I would panic a 
lot. Eight, seven, six -- i'll go. Five, four, three -- Even with 
John Glenn? I really don't think anyone's too old to do anything. 
Two, one -- Or too young. Blast off. Bob Dotson, NBC news, Marietta, 
Georgia.
