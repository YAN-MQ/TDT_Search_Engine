I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"Headline News" forecast. Later for Thursday, we're going to see snow 
and snow showers over the central Rockies, beautiful weather in the 
northwest and the gulf coast with rain developing over Arkansas and 
Missouri along a frontal system and rain in the northeast. That rain 
will continue in the northeast through Friday evening, and we'll see 
rain approaching the northwest coastline by Friday evening, as well. 
Widespread rain throughout the southern Rockies, into the Texas Panhandle 
on Friday afternoon. High temperatures on Friday -- a pocket of 30s 
in the Rockies, generally cool in the north, and warm in the south. 
Your extended forecast -- snow showers and thunderstorms over the 
central and southern Rockies with rain and showers in the northeast 
and the northwest. That rain continues on Sunday with the rain in 
the Rockies pushing to the east. Highs only in the 30s over northern 
Minnesota. That continues on Monday, with the rain in the northeast 
and northwest becoming more widely spread. We'll see a few thunderstorms 
in the southern plains. Remember, you can get your four-day forecasts 
for more than 7,200 cities at cNN.com.
