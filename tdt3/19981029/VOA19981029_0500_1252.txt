The World Golf Foundation has announced the Lloyd Mangrum who won 
36 professional tournaments during his career has been elected to 
the World Golf Hall of Fame. Mangrum, who died in 1973 at the age 
of 59, was named on the required 75 percent of the ballots returned 
by the voting body. No other players received more than 66 percent 
in the voting. A tough competitor who played an aggressive style, 
Mangrum competed in an era dominated by Hall of Famers such as Ben 
Hogan, Byron Nelson and Sam Snead. Mangrum and Spanish golfer Sevi 
Biasteros who was elected in the international ballot last year will 
become the 74th and 75th members of the Hall of Fame outside of St. 
Augustine, Florida. They'll be inducted during ceremonies on March 
22nd.
