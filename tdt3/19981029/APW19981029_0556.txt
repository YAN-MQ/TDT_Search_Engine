A 15-year-old boy who claims a kangaroo tried to maul him to death 
is suing the golf club where he was attacked for 750,000 Australian 
dollars (U.S dlrs 450,000), a court heard Thursday. Steven Shorten 
of Grafton, north of Sydney, described his horror when the large male 
kangaroo grabbed him around the waist, knocked him down and jumped 
on him, gouging a wound in his right cheek, fracturing his cheekbone 
and slashing his abdomen, back and legs. Ross Letherbarrow, the lawyer 
representing the boy's father, Rodney Shorten, presented to the Sydney 
District Court a bloodstained and torn T-shirt and pair of shorts 
the boy was allegedly wearing at the time of the attack on Oct. 27, 
1996. Letherbarrow told the court the boy, who was 13 at the time, 
was attacked near the fourth hole while searching for his friend's 
golf ball in long grass. The boy heard a ``tut, tut, tut'' noise, 
then a ``weird growling.'' He turned around to find a large gray kangaroo 
standing upright on its tail. He began backing away from the animal, 
then ran when it came hopping toward him. ``He tried to fend it off 
with his golf club but it knocked him to the ground. The kangaroo 
effectively tried to kill him,'' Letherbarrow said. The boy was rescued 
by a local primary school principal, Robert Ellison, who was playing 
nearby and came running when he heard the boy's screams. Ellison told 
the court he sprinted to the scene and found the kangaroo standing 
over Steven. He said he hit it in the head with his driver and it 
hopped away. The boy continues to suffer nightmares, sleep deprivation 
and nervousness around animals, and has been taunted at school, where 
he has been called Skippy, the court heard. Shorten contends the golf 
club was negligent in failing to erect a kangaroo fence around the 
course, failing to warn golfers not to go near the animals and failing 
to monitor the kangaroo population and remove aggressive animals. 
The case continues.
