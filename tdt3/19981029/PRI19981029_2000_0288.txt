Officials in Cambodia say illegal logging the country's national parks 
has increased dramatically in recent months. They're blaming the political 
uncertainty that's followed July's general elections. They say with 
no stable government, many Cambodians think they can get away with 
abusing the parklands. Caroline Gluck reports. Environment official 
say that logging and land clearance in Bokor National Park has dramatically 
escalated over the past four months. Since the county went to the 
polls, Balibor tropical hardwood is being cut down. Other areas are 
being cleared by burning, while the operators who are always armed, 
often stake a claim to the land, putting in banana and pineapple plantations. 
Park rangers and officials at the ministry of environment believes 
that highly-placed military and police officials are involved in the 
illegal activity. Caroline Gluck, BBC News, Nam Pan.
