He is not on a nostalgia trip, but sometimes his feet just take him 
in that direction. Suddenly Alberto Salazar is at the south end of 
Central Park, and there is a right turn just before Columbus Circle. 
There was an autumn afternoon in 1982 when Salazar made a right turn 
on the dirt, and annihilated a brave Mexican runner who had been with 
him for nearly 26 miles. ``Such a long time ago,'' Salazar said Thursday, 
still whippet thin, but no longer running marathons. ``The emotion 
just isn't there. Seven or eight years ago, it would get in my blood, 
just going there.'' That race in 1982 was the last time an American 
won the New York Marathon. It was the epitome of his competitive style, 
the way he won four of his first seven marathons. In 1981 he had set 
a world record of 2 hours 8 minutes 13 seconds (on a course later 
found to be 148 meters short), and in 1982 he was dogged by Rodolfo 
Gomez of Mexico, who had the reputation for speed at the end. ``There 
are two theories about marathons,'' Salazar said Thursday. ``One is 
that your best is your best. The other theory is that what you do 
affects the other runner.'' He is a proud man, with the blood of Roman, 
Spanish, Basque and French soldiers and pioneers. His father took 
the family out of Cuba when his old companion, Fidel Castro, swerved 
too far to the left. Centuries of adventure caused Alberto to take 
it personally when another runner stayed with him too long. ``I knew 
Gomez would be quicker in the final 200 yards,'' he said. ``I could 
not afford to let it come to that. I wanted to test him, to see if 
his legs were fresh. I mean, obviously, whose legs are going to be 
fresh at the end of a marathon? Perhaps his slow muscles would be 
tired, but maybe he had not used up his fast-twitch muscles.'' As 
clinically deliberate as a bullfighter, Salazar worked on Gomez. He 
made a short run; Gomez ran with him. He slowed down, Gomez slowed 
down. He made another short run; Gomez stayed with him. ``We came 
down Central Park South, and suddenly I was 5-6-7 yards in front of 
him,'' Salazar recalled. ``I knew he was softening. I said, `Next 
time he'll expect me to come back, but I won't.''' Salazar said he 
had the heart of an amateur, ``a purity that came of necessity. You 
lived like a starving artist.'' Then Fred Lebow showed him there was 
money to be made _ ``a pleasant surprise, the end of the rainbow,'' 
he said with a slight nod to his dead friend. His dominance was over 
by the 1984 Summer Games, and no American runner has ever replaced 
him. He says the sport has not been ``marketed'' the way team sports 
are, but he understands, from his two sons, Tony, 16, and Alex, 14, 
that baseball and soccer are fun. The father is laying artificial 
turf in the family back yard in Portland, Ore., so the two promising 
players can practice their skills, but it galls him that good young 
athletes will not work hard at running, do not grasp the primitive 
joy of outrunning somebody. ``Athletes from third-world countries 
are willing to take steroids and human-growth hormones because their 
people are starving,'' Salazar said. ``I can't say, `I'm not going 
to do it even if it would save Grandma's life.' There's no way you 
can compete without them. It's worth 45 seconds in the 10-kilometers 
and 2 minutes in the marathon. And athletes are getting medical advice. 
They do it for a certain number of years, and then they stop. There 
is no huge evidence that it's killing people.'' Salazar said he never 
had to make that compromise, his hard work and his zeal were enough 
for his time. He came back in 1993 to win the 54-mile Comrades race 
in South Africa, was taking Prozac at the time ``because I was irritable, 
not clinically depressed.'' He insisted the only edge from the drug 
was ``I wasn't irritable anymore.'' Three years ago, Salazar stepped 
in a hole while training and set off a one-man epidemic of injuries 
that required surgery. He is just now starting to do double-digit 
miles, and would like to break the world record for the ultramarathon, 
but he cannot bring himself to run a marathon. ``Too many expectations,'' 
he said. ``What would be the sense in people being disappointed if 
you finished 15th or 20th?'' A foreigner will win on Sunday, by which 
time Salazar will be back in Oregon, but he must come east every year, 
to do some business for Nike, and take a jog on that patch of dirt 
where he and American marathon running made their last stand.
