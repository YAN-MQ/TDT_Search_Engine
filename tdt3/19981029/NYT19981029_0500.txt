Democratic gubernatorial nominee Peter Vallone had 11 events _ some 
public, some private, some with the press _ on his itinerary Thursday. 
He started with a 7:45 a.m. subway stop on Manhattan's Upper East 
Side, went downtown for a fund-raiser with Chinese-American leaders, 
visited centers for the elderly in Brooklyn and attended a Democratic 
dinner in White Plains and a reception in Queens. It was not the schedule 
of a man in retreat. With his Republican opponent, Gov. George Pataki, 
ahead in the polls by a 2-to-1 ratio, pollsters, reporters and some 
officials in his own party seem to have written Vallone off. But the 
candidate himself is hewing to one stubborn fact: The election has 
not yet been held. And until it has, he is not conceding anything. 
In the Democratic primary, he noted in a speech Wednesday, ``they 
said I didn't have a chance, I wasn't known. The day before the election 
they had me at 35 percent with my opponent surging. Surprise, surprise: 
I won with an average of 57 percent in the entire state of New York.'' 
Perhaps he really does think that he can pull off an upset. Perhaps 
he is in denial. But whatever the psychology, Vallone seems more driven 
than ever. He is scaling up his campaigning, and in some of his public 
appearances he seems liberated and invigorated, as if the low-key 
Queens politician had suddenly been possessed by the spirit of a Baptist 
preacher. Nowhere was that more visible than on Vallone's trip upstate 
Wednesday. At the Ramada Inn in Albany, he spoke to the New York Statewide 
Senior Action Council, and quickly had the 100 senior citizens assembled 
eating out of his hand. ``Looking around the room,'' he began, ``I 
don't see that many senior citizens. I think we're going to have to 
start checking birth certificates here.'' He ended his speech by making 
a promise about next year's dinner, to enthusiastic applause: ``Instead 
of having it here, we're going to have a barbecue in the backyard 
of the now-empty Albany mansion,'' an allusion to the fact that Pataki 
has not resided at the Executive Mansion since his election. In between, 
he defended President Clinton _ also to applause _ and attacked the 
governor's school property tax relief program, which gave refunds 
this year to elderly homeowners. The refunds, he asserted, were paid 
for with ``borrowed money'' that would have to be repaid. Besides, 
he added, ``a lot of people who don't own homes need tax breaks, too.'' 
Some in the audience nodded vigorously. Attacking one of the governor's 
most popular programs shows either courage or folly, but Vallone increasingly 
seems to be throwing caution to the wind. Asked about misleading statements 
made by Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic candidate for attorney general, 
about his father's role in financing his campaign, Vallone opted for 
candor and loyalty over bland judiciousness. Vallone said his son 
Peter Jr., who was also on the trip upstate, had worked with Spitzer, 
who is a former assistant Manhattan district attorney. ``What I know 
about him is all very commendable,'' Vallone said. Later, he gave 
a fiery speech at a dinner for Rensselaer County Democrats. The theme 
was the same one he struck, with equal passion, before a large rally 
in Manhattan on Tuesday night: money, power, politics. If he is not 
a valid candidate because he raised only $6 million to Pataki's $33 
million, Vallone asked, ``why bother having elections? Why don't we 
just figure out who's got the most money, who can buy the most commercials, 
and give it to them?'' His fire-and-brimstone delivery seems to draw 
on a growing reservoir of anger. Pataki has refused to debate Vallone, 
which has infuriated Vallone, who sees the refusal as a sign of the 
chief executive's lack of accountability. (On a lighter note, he has 
begun telling reporters that if they can get Pataki to debate him, 
he will take them to Disney World.) And Vallone clearly believes that 
Pataki and the Republican Party bought this election, that early polls 
sealed the deal and that Vallone was never taken seriously as a result. 
One newspaper columnist wrote that in defeat, Vallone would go into 
``oblivion.'' ``Oblivion?'' said Vallone, who has been speaker of 
the New York City Council, and thus the city's second most powerful 
elected official, since 1986. ``What kind of word is that?'' If Vallone 
seems to be simultaneously enjoying the campaign and wishing for its 
end, the ambivalence may reflect the experience: Even slogging uphill, 
there are unexpected rewards. Wednesday, as Vallone and his contingent 
stood in the lobby of the Ramada Inn, a woman's calls for help suddenly 
became audible. The woman, Sybil Robertson, was in an elevator on 
the second floor, unable to get her wheelchair out the door. The Vallones 
raced upstairs, and Peter Jr. wheeled her out. As he did, she spotted 
the candidate. ``I already voted for you,'' she said, referring to 
her absentee ballot. ``I already mailed it in.'' Her glee was obvious 
_ and so was Vallone's.
