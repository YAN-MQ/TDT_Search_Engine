The World's oldest astronaut is back in space. 77-year old Senator 
John Glenn and six other astronauts on board Space Shuttle Discovery 
took off from Cape Canaveral just slightly behind schedule. At the 
launch site, President Clinton was jubilant. It's a great day for 
America, a great day for our senior citizens. I hope that all Americans 
share the exuberance that I feel today that I have for a continued 
aggressive exploration of space in ways that are cost effective and 
that will benefit us here on earth. John Glenn first took to space 
36 years ago. The first American ever to orbit planet Earth.
