Candy Crowley is up on Capitol Hill. Candy, the Tone very different 
from the Tone we heard last Friday. Sure, I think on behalf of the 
house managers as well as the senators who sitas jurors and judges, 
that they at least want to try and conduct this with solemnity. It's 
hard as you can see there are cameras all over the place. What we 
can envision is that as the senators walk on to and then back out 
of the floor, there will be opportunities for them to talk, and one 
wonders whether we will have this very solemn occasion going on on 
the Senate floor and this sort of circus and a grab for the cameras 
off the floor. That is certainly how it's currently setul. We will 
see how they act on the floor. You heard the do's and don't list from 
Frank. In contrast how they are off the floor. Candy Crowley on Capitol 
Hill.
