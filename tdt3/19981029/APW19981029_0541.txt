Actor Tom Cruise and his wife Nicole Kidman accepted ``substantial'' 
libel damages on Thursday from a British newspaper that reported he 
was gay and that their marriage was a sham to cover it up. Dressed 
in a gray suit, the 36-year-old star of ``Top Gun'' and ``Jerry McGuire'' 
showed up in court to hear a public apology for the publication of 
a ``highly offensive'' article in the Oct. 5, 1997, Express on Sunday 
Magazine, which also said he was impotent and sterile. ``I don't take 
a whole lot of pleasure in being here today,'' Cruise said afterward. 
``It is the last recourse against those that published vicious lies 
about me and my family. I have to protect them. This was certainly 
not about money. Every penny of this very substantial sum will be 
donated to charities.'' The amount of the settlement was undisclosed, 
but Express Newspapers is believed to have paid damages in excess 
of 100,000 pounds (dlrs 167,000) to each of the two actors and their 
legal costs of 150,000 pounds (dlrs 250,500). The movie star, flanked 
by lawyers and police, was mobbed by fans and female court staff as 
he left the courtroom, in contrast to his treatment recently when 
he tried to rent a video at a Blockbuster outlet north of London. 
Although employees at the store in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire, recognized 
him immediately, Cruise was denied a membership because he didn't 
have the required two forms of identification. ``For security and 
mailing purposes we need to know where our customers are,'' said a 
Blockbuster spokesman, who declined to give his name. ``There is no 
special dispensation _ even if you are a household name.'' Cruise, 
who has lived in Britain for two years with Kidman and their two adopted 
children, understood that ``rules are rules,'' the spokesman said. 
Kidman currently is enjoying rave reviews for her performance in ``The 
Blue Room'' on the London stage.
