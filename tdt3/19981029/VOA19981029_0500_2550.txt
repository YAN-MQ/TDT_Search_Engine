Less than a week to go before U.S. mid-term elections and the opposition 
Republican party has released a $10 million advertising campaign on 
behalf of its Congressional candidates, and in a policy turnabout, 
the Republicans are raising the sex and lies scandal involving President 
Clinton as an issue. VOA's Jim Malone reports. Until now, most Republicans 
have not been emphasizing the sex and perjury scandal, preferring 
to focus instead on their basic agenda issues like cutting taxes and 
reducing government spending. Republican candidates have also been 
heeding public opinion polls which indicated that many Americans found 
Republicans too aggressive as they pushed for a Congressional impeachment 
inquiry of President Clinton. But now, the National Republican Campaign 
Committee is spending $10 million on three-30 second television commercials 
which are being broadcast in about 70 media markets around the country. 
Political analysts say the new Republican ad campaign is intended 
to remind Republican leaning voters of the president's behavior as 
part of an effort to get out the party's core supporters on election 
day. Charles Cook is a Washington based political analyst who closely 
monitors House and Senate races around the country. He says Republicans 
may be worrying a bit because many political pundits are now predicting 
only modest Republican gains on November 3rd. We're figuring, you 
know, you're going to see Republican gains in the House, single digits, 
maybe ten seats, something like that, but not in the 15/20, something 
like that that we were talking about a month ago. The Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee says it will spend $3 million in the waning days 
of the campaign on its own ad campaign, promoting Democratic issues. 
Those ads will not make any references to the Clinton scandal. Many 
political analysts have said in recent days that there appears to 
be little evidence that concern over the president's political troubles 
will be a major factor on election day. Around the country, Republican 
Congressional candidates have generally stayed away from the sex and 
perjury scandal. But three Democratic House challengers have made 
this scandal a central issue in their campaigns, charging the Republicans 
have overplayed their hand in pushing for an impeachment inquiry of 
the president. Voters go to the polls on November 3rd to elect all 
435 members of the House, 34 of the 100 U.S. senators and 36 state 
governors. Jim Malone, VOA News, Washington.
