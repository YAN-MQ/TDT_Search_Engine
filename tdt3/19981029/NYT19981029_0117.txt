There is a song-and-dance number on Martin Short's 1989 television 
special, ``I, Martin Short, Goes Hollywood,'' that his friend Dave 
Thomas believes exemplifies a central truth about Short. It is a number 
in which the comic actor appears as an unpainted wooden fence, wearing 
little more than a fig leaf and a few slats. He is playing Dale O'Day, 
a supposedly ``legendary dancer's dancer'' from the 1940s, who, the 
viewer is also told, would later meet a tragic and untimely death 
crushed by furniture while dancing on the ceiling in his unfinished 
last film, ``The Red Slip-ons.'' (He had forgotten to nail down the 
furniture before rotating the room.) In the scene, Short skips, prances 
and gambols across the stage, his slats flapping, then breaks into 
wild dancing. He leaps onto hay bales, jumps between them, pirouettes 
_ all the while singing a song called ``Man in the Moon'' to a small 
boy who has offered to ask the man in the moon for some paint to cover 
the fence. ``It was a classic I'm-Mr.-Showbiz song,'' recalled Thomas, 
an actor who worked with Short in the Second City comedy troupe in 
Toronto and on the television show ``SCTV Network.'' Thomas said he 
thinks of Short as ``Mr. Showbiz'' _ a performer who can also sing, 
dance, be funny, be serious and be dramatic, but who ``is absolutely 
driven to entertain.'' ``It has always been very difficult, in film 
and television and the various mediums that he's performed in, for 
the vessel to properly contain him,'' Thomas said. ``The best outlet 
I've ever seen for Marty is the stage, where he can launch himself 
like a rocket at the audience and give them in 3-D the full benefit 
of his insanely manic energy.'' On Broadway lately, Short has been 
lifting off every night in previews of the Roundabout Theater Company 
revival of ``Little Me,'' the 1962 musical comedy for which Neil Simon 
wrote the book. In the show, which opens on Nov. 12 at the Criterion 
Center Stage Right, he plays not one but eight men in the life of 
Belle Poitrine, nee Schlumpfert, the curvaceous beauty turned tell-all 
memoirist from Drifter's Row (portrayed by Faith Prince). As those 
he works with know, Short is a master at appearing spontaneous in 
a completely scripted situation and can keep an audience wondering 
what will happen next. It is something he has worked on, especially 
in theater. ``I loved the consistency,'' he says, about his early 
years on stage. ``I loved almost the discipline of duplication and 
the grand scheme of making it fresh, making it appear like I had just 
made it up.'' This time, Short has his work cut out for him: there 
is Noble Eggleston, an overachieving blueblood who cannot marry Belle 
until she improves her social position; Amos Pinchley, an 88-year-old 
Scrooge; Val du Val, a famous French singer; Otto Schnitzler, an autocratic 
Hollywood director, and assorted others, including one of the Buchsbaum 
brothers, vaudeville bookers. At one point the actor winds up a scene 
by expiring, as the octogenarian Pinchley; rolls backward while the 
cast moves in front of him; is dressed on his hands and knees in a 
new wig, hat, cigar, glasses, jacket and padding; then materializes, 
behind a newspaper, as a Buchsbaum _ all in 25 seconds. ``The Buchsbaum 
brothers were designed to give this insane actor who has chosen to 
do seven roles a break,'' said Short over dinner in a Japanese restaurant 
near the midtown Manhattan studio where he was rehearsing. Despite 
the fact that he chose to skip the break and take on one of the brothers 
(Michael McGrath plays the other), he came across as thoughtful and 
quite sane. ``Hopefully,'' he said, ``the looks will be different 
and the attitude and the vocal quality from character to character. 
I've always been drawn to the kind of characterization that is very 
three-dimensional. One of my idols is Peter Sellers in `Strangelove,' 
where you literally saw him play three roles but it could have been 
three different actors. ``It wasn't just putting in funny teeth. It 
was fully evolved, three-dimensional in appearance and behavior and 
position of shoulders and a way of walking and talking. It was a totally 
different person.'' ``Little Me'' seems designed for Short, who made 
his name in the early 1980s on ``SCTV'' and ``Saturday Night Live'' 
inventing an entire cast of characters, like Jackie Rogers Jr., the 
albino entertainer; Irving Cohen, the geriatric Tin Pan Alley songwriter, 
and Ed Grimley, the endearing geek with the Dairy Queen-style coif. 
His humor capitalizes on the idiosyncrasies of character, attitude 
and behavior. He is an admirer of the physicality of Dick Van Dyke, 
the seamless realism of Lucille Ball. Actors describe him as fearless 
and uninhibited. Christopher Guest, the actor and director, calls 
him ``a clown in the best sense,'' unafraid to use his physical talents. 
``The reason we're doing `Little Me' is because of Martin Short,'' 
said its director, Rob Marshall, who directed the actor last year 
in the acclaimed Encores concert version of the 1968 ``Promises, Promises,'' 
with its book by Simon and music by Burt Bacharach. ``Marty is one 
of those rare individuals who is a true musical-theater star, and 
he can cross over from film to television to musical theater effortlessly.'' 
Yet Short has done relatively little musical theater in the last 20 
years. He began performing in musicals in Toronto during the 1970s 
but spent most of the 80s and 90s working in television and film, 
doing sitcoms, sketch comedy, specials, an animated series and movies, 
some critically admired but commercial flops. Only recently has he 
resurfaced on stage. Before ``Promises, Promises,'' he had starred 
in 1993 with Bernadette Peters in ``The Goodbye Girl.'' The Broadway 
musical version of Simon's 1977 film received mixed reviews, though 
Short was highly praised. ``One of the great strengths he has,'' said 
Simon, ``is that he is extremely warm and likable, which one doesn't 
always find with other comedians. The other thing that he has the 
ability to do and that no one has been able to do who has played this 
part is to sing, and to sing really well.'' So why hasn't Short done 
more musical theater on Broadway? The reasons, he said, are both personal 
and professional. First, he lives with his wife, Nancy Dolman, and 
their three children, ages 14, 12 and 9, in Los Angeles, not New York, 
and he would consider himself to have failed in life if he were ever 
to look back and say: ``I have four Tonys. If only I'd been there 
for the kids.'' But his career choices also reflect the state of musical 
theater today. The increasing dominance of television and film, combined 
with the evolution of popular taste and the enormous expense of mounting 
Broadway shows, have helped dry up the supply of the kind of larger-than-life 
roles that were written for comic actors like Sid Caesar, Ethel Merman 
and Bert Lahr. Musical comedies used to be much more star-driven, 
said Bert Fink, a vice president at the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization. 
``One thing we have lost, to a certain degree,'' Fink said, ``is the 
star vehicle. One way the British invasion of the 1980s transformed 
the landscape is that musicals like ``Cats,'' ``Les Miserables'' and 
``The Phantom of the Opera'' are not about the stars.'' Acknowledging 
the somewhat unexpected directions his career has taken, Short talked 
over dinner about the freedom of theater, the forgivingness of television, 
the frustrations of film. At 48, he has the animated features, rubbery 
athleticism and eager expressiveness of a small boy. He arrived at 
the restaurant wearing sneakers, jeans and an oversized plaid shirt 
_ at 5 feet 8 inches tall, a puckish figure with a large angular nose 
and humorous mouth. Though he is known as an almost perfect talk-show 
guest, brimming with stories and impressions, he spoke quite seriously 
about his family, his life and his work. Movies are a director's medium, 
not an actor's, Short said. A film might take years and $40 million 
to make, and end up seeming less funny than 15 minutes spent promoting 
it on the ``Late Show With David Letterman.'' By contrast, he said, 
an actor can do ``Saturday Night Live,'' the sketch bombs and the 
next week he is on the show again. ``To work in comedy, you have to 
accept that your percentage of failure is going to be high,'' Short 
said, estimating that 60 percent to 70 percent of what a comic actor 
does will not be a commercial success. ``You have to forget that part, 
or you would never do insane things.'' The youngest of five children, 
Short grew up in Hamilton, Ontario. His father was an Irish immigrant 
who became a steel company executive; his mother was the concertmistress 
of the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra. Everyone in his family was 
funny, Short said; he considers himself a beneficiary of ``trickle-down 
comedy.'' Early on, he became fascinated by show business. At 14, 
he was recording ``The Martin Short Show'' on a tape recorder in his 
bedroom in the attic of the family home. He would ``chat with'' celebrity 
guests like Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, dub in applause, then 
air the show for his family at 8:30 p.m. every other Monday. He was 
alternating with Andy Williams. Taping was not uncommon in the Short 
household. Family members regularly recorded funny interviews and 
instant musicals. At 16, Short taped most of Christmas. Within four 
years, both of his parents were dead; his oldest brother had died 
when Short was 12. He still plays the tapes around Christmas, the 
sound of his childhood piped in through speakers in the ceiling of 
his home office in Pacific Palisades. ``I have this philosophy about 
losing loved ones,'' Short said. ``If you start out with this idea 
that we're all going to die, the next step is to say, `Hi, Mom,' every 
day and you put pictures all over the place and you listen to tapes. 
I never felt that these people, part of my childhood, ever went away. 
They never left.'' Short studied social work at McMaster University 
in Hamilton and acted constantly in campus productions. He says he 
had not considered acting as a profession: ``To me, actors lived in 
the United States.'' But during his senior year, a friend, Eugene 
Levy, already an actor, encouraged him. His first audition was for 
the original Toronto production of ``Godspell.'' The auditions were 
held in a Masonic temple. Gilda Radner, yet to be discovered, arrived 
in pigtails and sang ``Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.'' Short sang ``My Funny 
Valentine.'' They were both hired, along with Paul Shaffer, now David 
Letterman's bandleader, who was there to play the piano for a girlfriend 
and ended up being enlisted as musical director. Victor Garber played 
Jesus. The production was a hit and Short began a seven-year stint 
of acting in Toronto _ everything from musical theater and Shakespeare 
on radio to industrial films. He spent two of those years as a member 
of the Second City comedy troupe, from which Ms. Radner and Dan Aykroyd 
had recently moved to ``Saturday Night Live.'' In 1979, Short decided 
to expand his career _ ``As we Canadians say, `Do the South' '' _ 
and went to New York, too. ``My real plan was to do theater,'' he 
recalled. But, he said, when he looked at theater in New York in the 
late 70s and early 80s, ``I didn't really see a place for me there. 
``We had gone into the `Chorus Line'/`Cats' phase of Broadway, which 
was a far cry from Ray Bolger, say, or Nathan Lane. I felt a little 
bit like, `Gee, isn't it a drag that I wasn't born 15 years earlier.' 
'' What did present itself was television. He was offered a major 
role in ``The Associates,'' a sitcom produced by James L. Brooks, 
the co-creator of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' When that was canceled, 
more offers followed. In 1982, Short joined ``SCTV,'' the show that 
is considered to have launched the careers of everyone from John Candy 
and Harold Ramis to Catherine O'Hara. He moved to ``Saturday Night 
Live'' in 1984, stayed one year and has been credited with helping 
to save the show from possible extinction. Then he quit, saying he 
was leaving to make movies and perhaps a Broadway musical. The movies 
got made. So did the television specials. But by 1987, he and his 
family had settled in Los Angeles and by 1989, with the children and 
numerous professional commitments, it was becoming increasingly difficult 
to pick up and move to New York for the commitment a Broadway show 
required. ``If they had offered me `Forum' instead of Nathan Lane 
_ which they didn't, but had they _ I probably would not have been 
able to do it,'' Short said, about the 1996 Broadway revival of ``A 
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.'' ``I would have been 
lined up for movies, and also I would have said, `I can't move to 
New York for a year.' '' As only one part of the Roundabout season, 
``Little Me'' requires a commitment of four months, Short said. Simon 
has extensively reworked ``Little Me,'' which he adapted from the 
novel of the same name by Patrick Dennis. It was Simon's first musical 
book, which he wrote originally for Sid Caesar (with Cy Coleman and 
Carolyn Leigh as the composer and lyricist). He remembered things 
that had not worked in the original production and the short-lived 
1982 revival on Broadway. ``When you do a show again, you rewrite 
it,'' Simon said. ``You're getting another chance at it.'' About specific 
changes, he said simply, ``There are 120 pages of things.'' But he 
stressed that he wanted to capitalize on the talents of Short. Thomas 
said of his friend: ``He's got more than his share of life energy 
bursting out of his body. Where else except in person and on stage 
would you want to see that? Why would you want to record it on tape 
or flatten it out on celluloid when you can see it in real life?''
