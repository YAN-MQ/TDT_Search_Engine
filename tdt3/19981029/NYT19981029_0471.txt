After eight years behind bars for a double-murder conviction based 
entirely on what prosecutors now concede was fabricated testimony, 
a Brooklyn man was exonerated and freed Thursday by a judge who apologized 
to him for ``the entire judicial system.'' The judge also expressed 
shock that he himself had been ``fooled'' by the witness. The man, 
Jeffrey Blake, 29, who earlier in the day had been driven to state 
supreme court in Brooklyn from a maximum-security prison upstate, 
where he had been serving a sentence of 36 years to life, first lowered 
his head when Acting Justice Robert Kreindler dismissed the case against 
him. Then, as the court session ended and Blake was ``now a free man,'' 
as the judge put it, the liberated Blake hugged Michelle Fox, the 
Legal Aid Society lawyer who had led the effort to convince prosecutors 
that his conviction had been fully based on perjury and should be 
thrown out. ``You did it, thank you,'' Blake said softly as he embraced 
Ms. Fox. Shortly afterward, as each new breath of free air seemed 
to fill him with another dose of spirit, Blake rushed from the courthouse 
through a pack of reporters and television cameras, saying: ``I feel 
great! I'm going to live my life, man!'' Blake's life had been interrupted 
by what Kreindler referred to Thursday as a nightmare: his arrest 
in the June 1990 killings of two men, Everton Denny and Kenneth Felix. 
Dozens of bullets fired from an automatic weapon ripped into their 
car in East New York, Brooklyn. Blake was charged after an acquaintance, 
Dana Garner, told the police he had seen Blake shooting into the car. 
Garner was the sole witness implicating Blake, and in a 1991 trial 
at which Kreindler presided, the jury chose to believe Garner rather 
than witnesses, including Blake's sister and his employer, who testified 
that Blake had been miles from the scene of the slayings. But Garner 
_ whom Ms. Fox described in court Thursday as a chronic fabricator 
whose motives could only be guessed at _ came forward and passed a 
polygraph test recently in which he recanted his testimony. Bob Herbert, 
a columnist for The New York Times, wrote two columns last summer 
describing problems with the case, and Ms. Fox met with aides of District 
Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn, whose office had prosecuted 
the case. Hynes then ordered a review of the case. It ended with his 
decision to join Ms. Fox's motion to Kreindler to dismiss the conviction 
and the charges that led to it. A spokesman for Hynes, Patrick Clark, 
credited Ms. Fox and Herbert for setting in motion the events that 
led to Thursday's court session. An assistant district attorney, Jon 
Besunder, told Kreindler Thursday that his office was now ``convinced 
that Garner was not a witness to the crime'' and that there was no 
other evidence implicating Blake. Because of the five-year statute 
of limitations, Garner cannot be prosecuted for what the authorities 
now say was his perjury at the 1991 trial. Prosecutors and Janice 
Mitchell, an investigator for the Legal Aid Society who worked on 
the case, said they did not know Garner's whereabouts, and a telephone 
listing in Brooklyn for that name carries an unpublished number. At 
a news conference at the Legal Aid Society's offices in Manhattan 
_ where Blake asked for Kentucky Fried Chicken, ``extra crispy,'' 
as his first meal in freedom _ he said of Garner: ``I really have 
no feeling against him. Now I appreciate what he did in coming forward 
and letting them know he was lying.'' As to whether he was bitter 
over his conviction and years in prison, Blake said: ``Not really. 
Right now I'm just happy it's over.'' With two of his sisters and 
a nephew at his side, Blake spoke of a future in which he would work 
with prisoners convicted of crimes they did not commit, saying that 
there were thousands of such cases.
