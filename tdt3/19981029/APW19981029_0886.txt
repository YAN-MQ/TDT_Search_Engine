American Major League Baseball plans to ban the use of androstenedione, 
the muscle-building dietary supplement used by home run champion Mark 
McGwire, the Toronto Globe and Mail reported Thursday. The newspaper 
cited unidentified sources, who said they expect commissioner Bud 
Selig to formally announce a ban before spring training next season. 
``I would hate to be in McGwire's shoes right now,'' said Dr. William 
Bryan, team physician for the Houston Astros and the past president 
of the American Association of Professional Team Physicians. ``We 
have just been shaking our heads all this time that androstenedione 
was on the shelves.'' McGwire, who could not be reached for comment, 
hit 70 homers this year, breaking the record of 61 set by Roger Maris 
in 1961. ``All the players will know where we stand on andro once 
a decision is made,'' said MLB players' union chief Donald Fehr, who 
along with Selig agreed last summer to appoint a committee of doctors 
to study the danger of andro. ``Right now, the doctors are simply 
investigating.'' Androstenedione is illegal in Canada but legal in 
the United States. It is banned by the International Olympic Committee, 
U.S. pro gridiron National Football League and America's main governing 
body for college sports (the NCAA), but allowed by MLB. Selig could 
not immediately be reached for comment. In Johnson City, Tennessee, 
researchers at East Tennessee State University are studying the supplement. 
Dr. Craig Broeder, exercise physiologist at the school's Human Performance 
Lab, said they will study androstenedione's physical and psychological 
effect on men between the ages of 35 and 65. ``The main reason for 
the study is about health issues and anti-aging,'' he said. The study's 
70 participants will undergo medical tests as they engage in weight 
training for 12 weeks. The dlrs 28,000 study is being funded by ChemSource, 
a company that researches supplements and other products, and Metabolic 
Response Modifiers, which produces supplements. Broeder said he hopes 
to find that andro can boost men's testosterone at an age when it 
begins to drop. Such a drop creates a greater risk of heart and circulatory 
problems.
