The report on south Africa's era of apartheid is out today. The 3,500-page 
document is the product of two years of testimony from thousands of 
witnesses before the country's truth and reconciliation commission. 
The report was formally presented to south African President Nelson 
Mandela by retired anglican archbishop Desmond Tutu, who heads the 
commission. It contains more than just accounts of findings against 
perpetrators. It seeks to give as complete a picture of the Gross 
human rights violations that occurred as result of conflict of the 
past. It provides a setting against which to understand our past. 
It gives an insight into perspectives of those who supported apartheid 
and those who opposed it. It makes comprehensive recommendations about 
rehabilitation and reparation proposals. The truth and reconciliation 
commission was established in 1995, a year after all-race elections 
ended apartheid.
