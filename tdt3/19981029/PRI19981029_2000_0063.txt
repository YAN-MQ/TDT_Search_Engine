For "The World," this is Alan Dow in the BBC newsroom in London. South 
Africa's Deputy President Tabon Becky has criticized some of the findings 
of the Truth Commission's long-awaited report into crimes committed 
under the apartheid regime. He said some sections were wrong and misguided. 
The report details evidence of human rights violations by Nelson Mandela's 
African National Congress and the main Zulu party, as well as the 
white apartheid regime. Truth Commission Chairman Archbishop Desmond 
Tutu said the document will enable South Africans to live with their 
past and move on. We will have looked the beast in the eye. We will 
have come to terms with our horrendous past and will no longer keep 
us --. We will cut off its shackles and holding hands together, black 
and white. We will stride together into the future. Archbishop Tutu.
