According to Chinese tradition, October 28th is the day for climbing 
mountains. Since there are no mountains near Shanghai, 80 athletes 
climbed a building instead. An 88-story tower. That's the tallest 
building in China, and the third tallest in the world. The champion 
got to the top in just 25 minutes.
