Thousands of commuters were delayed Thursday after an early morning 
fire closed the Kings Cross railway station and revived memories of 
a 1987 blaze that killed 31 at the busy central city terminal. Firefighters 
responded after gas cylinders exploded at a freight yard north of 
the Kings Cross station at about 3:30 a.m. (0330 GMT), police said. 
Five tons of trash and debris were ablaze at the yard and firefighters 
were on the scene well into the morning rush hour after more cylinders 
were discovered. No one was injured. A dropped match started the Nov. 
17, 1987, fire at the end of evening rush hour in one of the terminal's 
subway stations. An official inquiry said haphazard staff response 
and complacency among managers contributed to the disaster, the worst 
in the 130-year history of the city's rail system.
