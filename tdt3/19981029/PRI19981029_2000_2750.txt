Are you revved up for the answer to today's geography puzzler? We 
are searching for the major trading center of the shores of the Persian 
Gulf. In the distant past, this part of the United Arab amoritz -- 
was also home to pirating and other skullduggery. The answer is the 
Gulf amorit of Dubai, which happened to hit the news this week, when 
local traffic officials took out an unusual radio ad. That's right. 
For one week car drivers are being paid for driving safely. Local 
authorities came up with the carrot when they found that the stiff 
fines and speed traps wasn't working. Under the plan, police pull 
over good drivers and hand them the equivalent of $200 U.S. dollars. 
Captain Ali of the Dubais police says that the good driver needn't 
fear being caught. We catch him because he's driving very safely and 
using the seat belt and also using their indicator in the -- exactly 
where they're going to turn. And also, he is -- he drive in same of 
the limit of the law. The Dubais police have been taking motorists 
by surprise, including this man. I wasn't exactly sure. I was trying 
to figure out if I did anything wrong. But the news was good news. 
The first time I've been pulled over by a -- by the police over here 
and was 750 -- richer for that. That was great.
