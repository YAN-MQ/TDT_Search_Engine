The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 30: Connecticut's 
U.S. Senate race has been a one-sided affair. Sen. Christopher Dodd's 
Republican opponent, former Rep. Gary Franks, has campaigned hard 
but not always wisely. Franks has misquoted Dodd and gone over the 
top with his rhetoric more than once. It is hardly likely that many 
voters will agree with his contention that Dodd set a bad example 
for children when he called President Clinton an ``idiot.'' But some 
of Franks' attacks have hit home. This has not been a shining period 
in Dodd's career. He lost a bid to become Democratic leader in the 
Senate and accepted a post as co-chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee when the committee, under White House direction, was raising 
millions from suspect foreign sources. Dodd attended a number of the 
now-infamous White House coffees without ever believing, he contends, 
that they were actually fund-raisers. He apparently never questioned 
the propriety of such sleazy fund raising, and his connection to it 
has tarnished his record. Even so, Dodd is vastly preferable to his 
opponent on a policy level. Franks sided with the most conservative 
elements in his party on numerous occasions, opposing gun control 
and programs to extend voter registration. He even opposed the Family 
Medical Leave Act, which Dodd sponsored and fought to pass. The senator, 
in contrast, has been a reliable supporter of civil rights, civil 
liberties, the environment and, despite his poor performance at the 
DNC, campaign finance reform. In modern Washington, where the House 
majority leader boasts that he has traveled outside the country only 
once and never intends to go again, Dodd has a sophisticated worldview 
that is increasingly rare. He has a lifelong interest in Latin America, 
and has been an important voice on human rights issues in that region. 
He is even better known as a champion of children's causes, and has 
recently been a successful advocate for children's health programs. 
Dodd has some exceptional gifts as a legislator, but lately he seems 
to have lacked focus. We endorse his re-election in the hope that 
he will use his talents more productively over the next six years.
