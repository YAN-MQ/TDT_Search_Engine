Moscow's mayor says he's tired of people asking him whether he plans 
to run for president in 2000. ``I work a lot and usually keep in good 
shape, but questions about the presidency make me feel tired,'' Yuri 
Luzhkov told reporters. However, Luzhkov then reiterated that he would 
run if he feels no other candidate can solve Russia's problems, the 
Interfax news agency reported. Others expected to run in 2000 are 
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, liberal political Grigory Yavlinsky, 
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Alexander Lebed, a former 
general who is now governor of a vast Siberian region.
