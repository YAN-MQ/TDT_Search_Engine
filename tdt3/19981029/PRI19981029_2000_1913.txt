Former military ruler of Chile', Augusto Pinoche who was being held 
in London has been moved to a secure hospital apparently to remove 
him from media attention. Judges in Spain have been meeting to decide 
whether they have the authority to try Pinoche for crimes committed 
during his rule. But Pinoche' may never stand trial in Spain because 
the British High Court has ruled he has immunity from prosecution 
and shouldn't be extradited. Daniel Schwimler reports from Madrid. 
The case against General Pinoche and Spain is continuing as planned. 
But those involved in the two-year investigation were devastated by 
the decision of the High Court in London. One of the investigating 
lawyers said their work would continue and that even if General Pinoche 
goes home, which now seems increasingly likely, there were many other 
former South American dictators it could pursue. Spanish judges have 
meanwhile still met to decide whether they have the authority to General 
Pinoche, a foreign national, for crimes allegedly committed abroad. 
But the urgency has gone out of the case. This is Daniel Schwimler 
for the BBC in Madrid.
