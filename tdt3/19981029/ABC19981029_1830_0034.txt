Good evening. John Glenn is neither the first politician to fly in 
space, nor the first former astronaut to make a comeback. But Glenn 
made it more exciting today. It wasn't the first time that people 
had driven down to the cape to stand on the beach and watch. The shuttle 
has been up 91 times before. But a lot of people were there today 
because Glenn was going to fly. That's why the president and Mrs. 
Clinton were there. And while we have not yet seen Glenn in space, 
we have heard him, as well as his commander. Here are some excerpts. 
This is beautiful. The best part is a trite old statement, "zero G 
and I feel fine." I don't know what happens on down the line, but 
today is beautiful and great and -- I just can't even describe it. 
And let the record show that John has a smile on his face that goes 
from one ear to the other, and we haven't been able to remove it yet. 
They stayed that way for nine days.
