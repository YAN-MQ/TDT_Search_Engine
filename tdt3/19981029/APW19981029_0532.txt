German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, in Britain for introductory 
meetings with the government, said Thursday that the two countries 
were committed to finding peace in Kosovo and shared concern about 
Russian stability. Fischer, a member of the Green Party, was sworn 
in Tuesday as part of Gerhard Schroeder's new leftist government. 
After his meeting with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the two 
men said they would encourage closer cooperation within the European 
Union, particularly on environmental issues _ including the disposal 
by Russia of nuclear waste on its western borders. Both countries 
also made a commitment to provide 200 members for the verification 
team in the Serb province of Kosovo to help enforce the Holbrooke 
agreement, under which Serbia has agreed to withdraw troops from the 
war-torn province. On Wednesday, shortly before setting off on his 
trip to France, Britain and Poland, Fischer called France ``the most 
important partner'' in Europe, but he also singled out British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair as an ally. He voiced concern then about Russia's 
stability in view of the country's financial crisis. At a news conference 
here Thursday, Cook said Germany and Britain had agreed Europe could 
not afford to stand by and watch its vast neighbor plunge further 
into chaos. ``We are both agreed that the urgent priority for the 
security policy is to develop a common position addressing both the 
political and the economic situation in Russia,'' he said. Cook and 
Fischer committed themselves to meeting at least every six months 
and for their European ministers to hold talks every three months. 
Earlier this week, Fischer said the new German government would seek 
continuity in foreign policy but also put more stress human rights 
and economic development.
