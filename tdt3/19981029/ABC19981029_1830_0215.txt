We heard the event described in a number of ways today, described 
-- John glenn taking a victory lap said one person it was like Woodstock 
for old people. Someone else said more than 3500 jurnalists were on 
hand for the launch. Sure, more people had their eye on the cape today 
than any time in a long time. Here's ABC's Aaron brown. Nine, eight, 
seven. It has been a long time -- since so many Americans -- of every 
age, young and old -- from New York to L.A. -- held their breath, 
crossed their fingers, said a prayer, and watched the marvel that 
is manned space flight. I think it's great a guy this old. Going up 
there, doing it again, showing everybody what it's like. It's fantastic. 
It brought tears to my eyes. I think it is absolutely wonderful, because 
I have a father his age, and for him to have this opportunity, to 
go back into space is just, I think, wonderful. That wonderment could 
be seen and heard in the words of children. I bet he's very brave 
to go up in the Moon. Many watched in schools, some named after another 
astronaut, christa McAuliffe, who died on the "challenger," 12 years 
and 66 manned flights ago. I was thrilled seeing it. I thought, "he's 
going to be an American patriot. I want to be just like him." If you 
were older, it was a flashback. John Glenn kind of represents a hero 
for the country and a role model for our kids -- he did for me. So 
much technology could have been lost without NASA being rekindled, 
in you will, because of John Glenn. And a chance to dream. Well, John's 
just a little bit older than I am. I'd be glad to trade places with 
him. Well, I always had said I wanted to be the first doctor on the 
Moon to deliver a baby. Yes, there were skeptics. I do feel that NASA 
did a great job of marketing John Glenn to further their cause of 
getting into the pockets of all Americans. But mostly we heard this. 
When I saw the crowd clapping, I was clapping with them. Everyone 
was one for a moment. Which was very much the feeling 36 years and 
120 manned flights ago. Aaron brown, ABC News, New York.
