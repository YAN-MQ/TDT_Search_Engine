Hundreds of stone-throwing rioters rampaged through an Indonesian 
town in a protest against the use of a Chinese-owned home as a place 
for Christian worship, police said Thursday. The mob damaged at least 
10 shops and houses and one ethnic Chinese man was beaten in the riot 
Wednesday in Ciamis, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of the capital, 
Jakarta. The ethnic Chinese minority has been the target of widespread 
unrest this year, as rioters angry over price increases have targeted 
their shops and homes. Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis 
in decades, and relatively well-off Chinese entrepreneurs are natural 
scapegoats for the hardship suffered by millions of people. The unrest 
helped oust former President Suharto in May, but there have been few 
recent reports of violence tied to religious differences. Nearly 90 
percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslim, and ethnic Chinese 
are mostly Christian or Buddhist. Religious tolerance is enshrined 
in the national philosophy and constitution, but Christians often 
have difficulty obtaining permits to build churches. So they sometimes 
worship illegally at home. The makeshift church in Ciamis was set 
up on the second floor of a house owned by a Chinese businessman. 
His shop, which was damaged in the riot, fills the first floor. A 
local police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said by 
telephone that damaged property included a bank, a pharmacy and several 
cars. He said the rioters beat up a man believed to be a relative 
of the owner of the house used for prayer. The riot prompted the military 
to tighten security in the neighboring town of Tasikmalaya, where 
protesters burned Christian churches during unrest that left at least 
three people dead in 1996.
