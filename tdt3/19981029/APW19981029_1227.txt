Treasury Secretary Angel Gurria said Thursday that Mexico is planning 
to overhaul its Mexico's aging tax system ahead of the 1999 budget. 
Speaking at a conference of retailers, Gurria said the government 
hopes to focus public resources on subsidies to the poor while reducing 
fiscal costs of generalized subsidies and tax exemptions. He said 
current generalized subsidies on tortillas and tax exemptions on food 
and medicines are ``unfair'' because they also benefit people who 
don't need them. The government must present its 1999 budget proposal 
to Congress by Nov. 15. The House of Deputies then has until Dec. 
15 to debate and modify the bill. Gurria said the government is discussing 
with business groups the possibility of revising taxes on food and 
medicines in the 1999 budget. News reports have said that a sales 
tax of 6 percent could be placed on food and medicine. Mexico's sales 
tax for all consumer goods except food and medicine currently stands 
at 15 percent. Gurria said 1999 would be ``a complex year on the international 
economic stage.'' He said that in light of the lack of credit in international 
capital markets, the government ``will take extreme precautions'' 
and plan its 1999 expenditures ``very cautiously.'' He said government 
spending next year will be lower as a percentage of the gross domestic 
product than in 1998 and that the government would have ``very modest'' 
funding from international sources. The government will seek financing 
from internal savings without pressuring local interest rates, Gurria 
said.
