Golf star Greg Norman, a friend of Bill Clinton, said Thursday he 
was disappointed in the U.S. president because of the Monica Lewinsky 
affair. ``Yes I am disappointed in him,'' Norman said in an interview 
on Australian pay-television network Foxtel. ``I'll tell you why: 
because I carry the Constitution of the United States around in my 
briefcase with me and every now and then I like to read it because 
I live there and I like to understand the rules I live under. ``I 
pay taxes over there, so to me a person in that position should always 
abide by, or should even be a little bit above, the Constitution of 
the United States because purely and simply he is a role model; people 
all look up to him because of the position he's in.'' Norman also 
said Clinton did a ``terrible job'' in his speech to the American 
public in August admitting to an inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky. 
He said Clinton should ``just get out there and express to the public 
and the people of America just how (he) feels,'' Norman said. ``On 
the other side of the fence, taking away the personal side of it, 
he's been a phenomenal president.'' A friendship has developed in 
recent years between Norman and Clinton. Norman was unwittingly drawn 
into the Lewinsky saga on his last visit to Australia earlier this 
year. He was forced to deny media reports that Lewinsky had accompanied 
Clinton on a visit to Norman's Florida house in March 1997, when the 
president injured his ankle falling down a flight of stairs.
