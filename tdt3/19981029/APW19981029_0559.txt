Polish leaders are looking for an outline of Germany's new policy 
toward its eastern neighbors as well as its position on European integration 
during a visit here Thursday by Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. 
Warsaw is the final step of Fischer's three-nation trip, his first 
since he was sworn in Tuesday. He visited Paris on Wednesday and spent 
the night in London. The trip was aimed at reassuring European partners 
the new German government will stress continuity, but the Fischer's 
comments Wednesday about ``realism'' in accepting new EU members like 
Poland, have put Poles, accustomed to former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
open support for EU expansion, on alert. Shortly after arriving Thursday 
afternoon, Fischer is meeting his Polish counterpart Bronislaw Geremek, 
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and President Aleksander Kwasniewski, during 
nearly seven hours in Warsaw. ``We are very happy that minister Fisher 
is coming to Warsaw at the very start of his (government) career,'' 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Pawel Dobrowolski said. He said Geremek, 
who has expressed reservations about the future of Polish-German relations 
under the new Social Democratic-led government, is looking forward 
to establishing a direct contact with Fischer, a member of the Greens 
party, junior partner in the German government. Polish leaders would 
like to hear answers on ``certain questions that have appeared in 
the first days'' of the new Bonn coalition, concerning ``the new German 
Ostpolitik,'' Dobrowolski said. Let's also see what this new realism 
means, he added. Dobrowolski said German officials have requested 
two additional points on the busy agenda. Fisher will stop at two 
World War II memorials in Warsaw commemorating the 1943 Jewish Ghetto 
struggle and the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis. ``It is a 
splendid initiative of the German side,'' Dobrowolski said. The a 
gesture is expected to underline Germany's continuing commitment to 
forging a special bond with Poland. Having turned France from foe 
to friend in the decades since World War II, Germany has sought to 
repeat the process eastward with Poland since the end of the Cold 
War.
