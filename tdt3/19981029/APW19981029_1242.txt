In 1997, Franziska Rochat-Moser ran the New York City Marathon because 
it was her goal. This year, as the defending women's champion, she 
feels it's her obligation. ``Last year, I wanted to run the New York 
City Marathon because I had that dream as a child,'' the 32-year-old 
from Switzerland said Thursday. ``This season was very difficult for 
me, but the dream to defend made me train hard and come back.'' Rochat-Moser's 
season has been interrupted twice by stress fractures, one to her 
left thigh in March, one to her left leg in July. The injuries forced 
her to miss the European Championships at Budapest, Hungary, in August, 
and delayed her entry for New York, because she wasn't sure she would 
be ready. But after resuming training in August, she decided to go 
for a second straight victory Sunday, against a tough field that includes 
1994-95 winner and world record-holder Tegla Loroupe of Kenya, 1996 
champion Anuta Catuna of Romania and European silver medalist Madina 
Biktagirova of Russia. Not only has Rochat-Moser been plagued by injuries, 
she also has been overwhelmed by well-wishers in Switzerland since 
her victory a year ago. ``Winning the New York City marathon changed 
my life. ... Everybody wanted something from me,'' she said. ``The 
whole year has been hard for me. Everyone wanted to know how I am. 
But I still went on to train.'' While Rochat-Moser is not Switzerland's 
most well-known women's athlete _ that designation belongs to tennis 
star Martina Hingis _ she is nonetheless popular at home. Rochat-Moser 
is always in Switzerland while Hingis doesn't spend much time there. 
Rochat-Moser's popularity is enhanced by the three-star restaurant 
she owns with her husband _ one of only two three-star establishments 
in Switzerland. The restaurant, Girardet, in her hometown of Crissier, 
on the outskirts of Lausanne, seats 70 people, specializes in French 
cuisine, has an average price range of about dlrs 200 a meal and requires 
reservations three months in advance for Friday and Saturday nights. 
One recent customer was Cindy Crawford. ``She ate in the kitchen,'' 
Rochat-Moser said, adding that the model had not made a reservation 
and had gone to Switzerland at the last minute to help promote a golf 
tournament. ``We get people from all over the world _ the United States, 
Japan, everywhere.'' Rochat-Moser also is a lawyer but will not actively 
pursue that job until she finishes her running career. ``It is not 
possible to work three professions,'' she said. Rochat-Moser's best 
marathon time is 2 hours, 27 minutes, 44 seconds, in winning the 1994 
Frankfurt Marathon. She won New York last year at 2:28:43, and doesn't 
figure to improve much on that time Sunday. ``In New York, you don't 
run against the clock,'' she said. ``It's important to have a good 
placing. If you want to make a good time, you don't run New York. 
``If I could win the New York City Marathon twice, I would be a star 
(like Hingis) as well,'' she said.
