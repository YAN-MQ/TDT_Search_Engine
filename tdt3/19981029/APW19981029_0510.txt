Charges were brought against the director of an independent Belgrade 
radio station for defying a government ban by broadcasting without 
a license, media reported Thursday. The charges against Nenad Cekic, 
director of the small but influential Radio Index, represent continued 
crackdown against independent Serbian media by President Slobodan 
Milosevic's government. Cekic could be sentenced to up to eight years 
in jail if found guilty. His radio, often critical of Milosevic's 
hard-line policies, was banned on Oct. 8 for not having a broadcast 
license. Radio Index and other members of an independent electronic 
media organization have been denied licenses for years, giving the 
government leverage to shut down them when their broadcasts become 
critical of authorities. Defying the ban, Radio Index continued its 
one-hour daily broadcast over the airwaves of another popular independent 
Belgrade radio station, B 92. Last week, Serbian parliament passed 
a new media law severely restricting press freedom and instituting 
heavy fines for media publishing or broadcasting ``anti-patriotic'' 
and ``anti-government'' stories. As the result, four major independent 
Belgrade newspapers stopped publishing out of fear of the huge fines 
that would force them to close down indefinitely. Over the weekend, 
a Belgrade court fined the Evropljanin, or European, weekly dlrs 246,000 
for publishing articles that accused Milosevic of leading Serbia into 
political and economic chaos. On Wednesday, the court ordered the 
chief editor of the weekly, Dragan Bujosevic, to pay a third of his 
salary to the state each month until his part of the roughly dlrs 
40,000-fine was settled.
