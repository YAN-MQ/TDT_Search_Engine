World grain prices are bolstered over talk of a U.S. food aid package 
from Russia. I'm Patrick O'Connell at the business desk in New York. 
Grain markets, which are severely depressed after the sudden falling 
demand due to economic turmoil, have been buzzing over the past few 
days with talk of the U.S. sending Russia more than 3 million tons 
of grain. Russia's harvest has been the worst for 10 years. It's been 
hit by poor weather and because of the financial crisis, difficulties 
in finding equipment and fuel to bring in the crops. A delegation 
from the U.S. Agriculture Department is currently in Moscow to discuss 
the possibility of a food aid package. Donald Mitchell is a senior 
agricultural economist for the World Bank. The Asia financial crisis 
has led to sort of a reevaluation of the whole situation in prices 
-- commodity prices across the board have declined sharply. Grain 
prices are declining more than almost any other and you now hear a 
lot of reports about farmers who expect to have the worst that they've 
had in a decade. And certainly there is -- there is truth to that. 
Prices have also declined in the world market and now the interesting 
question is whether or not you've had an overshooting to the point 
where you'll expect some kind of a bounceback. Others believe grain 
prices could shoot up, as global weather systems alter, with fears 
for drought and grain production. Lester Brown, president of the World 
Watch Institute says China and India will be the first to suffer. 
My guess is that we will see very substantial grain price increases 
within the next five years at the outside and quite possibly before 
then. We've seen temperature rises this year that are unprecedented. 
When we try to graph the premier temperature for 1998, it really went 
off the chart that we have been using from the last 20 years. And 
this sort of temperature rise leads to more destructive stories, more 
severe floods, more intense droughts. All of the -- the world food 
prospect on the stability of good supplies. The United States exports 
40 percent of its grain and as demand has fallen, so have farmers' 
incomes. It's not just the commodity markets are anxious to see if 
the food aid package to Russia will be confirmed. I'm Patrick O'Connell 
in New York reporting for "The World."
