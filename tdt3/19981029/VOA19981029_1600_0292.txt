Leaders of the ethnic Serbian minority in Yugoslavia's Kosovo Province 
have condemned the recent mass re-deployment and pull out of government 
security forces from the area. A statement issued by the Serbian orthodox 
church and political leaders in Kosovo says the pull out undermines 
Serbia's territorial integrity. It says this paves the way for eventual 
Kosovo cessation from Yugoslavia and endangers Serbs in the province.
