Fire swept through a cold storage plant under construction, killing 
at least 25 workers and injuring 15 others Thursday in the southern 
port city of Pusan, police said. Police said the fire, believed to 
have been ignited by welding sparks, engulfed the three upper floors 
of the eight-story structure, trapping dozens of people inside. Most 
of the dead suffocated in toxic gas that filled parts of the building, 
they said. Clusters of bodies were found in the stairways leading 
to the rooftop. The blaze was put out in two hours but firefighters 
had difficulty moving into the building because of the gas. Fifteen 
people, including 10 workers and five firefighters, were hospitalized 
with burns and other injuries, police said. Some suffered broken legs 
and back injuries after jumping from the building. About a half dozen 
workers escaped to the roof, where they were later rescued by helicopter, 
police said.
