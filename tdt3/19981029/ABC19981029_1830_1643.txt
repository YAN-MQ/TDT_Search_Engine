A brief review of our top story today. Of course, it's John Glenn. 
He and his six colleagues on the shuttle "discovery" took off from 
cape canaveral today. They're now in orbit. Senator Glenn says he's 
enjoying the show, which obviously means the view of earth from space, 
and he feels fine. The launch was not perfect. A door apparently fell 
off of a compartment that carries the shuttle's drag chute used during 
the landing. NASA says it shouldn't have any impact.
