A senior U.S. foreign aide official says the danger of a humanitarian 
catastrophe in Kosovo appears to have eased, following the reduction 
of Serbian forces. The official said the number of displaced ethnic 
Albanians living outdoors has dropped from an estimated high of 50,000 
to about 10,000. Meanwhile, U.S. Balkan envoy Richard Holbrooke says 
Belgrade made enormous concessions in the agreement to end the crisis 
but he warned again that NATO remains ready to act if Yugoslav authorities 
go back on their promises.
