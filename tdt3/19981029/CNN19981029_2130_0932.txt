Here's a check of our top stories -- John Glenn says he's enjoying 
the show. The 77 year-old senator/astronaut returned to space today 
along with six other crew members aboard the space shuttle "discovery." 
Glenn's first space flight was in 1962, aboard the cramped "friendship 
7" mercury capsule. There was a slight snag at lift off today. An 
aluminum panel was ripped from the shuttle's tail. The panel struck 
an engine nozzle and disappeared into the exhaust. NASA says the mishap 
poses no danger.
