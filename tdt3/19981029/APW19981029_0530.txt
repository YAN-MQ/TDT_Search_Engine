Senior government officials from the United States, Ukraine and Poland 
announced a joint program Thursday aimed at helping Ukraine use Poland's 
experience in implementing market reforms. Stephen Sestanovich, an 
adviser to the U.S. Secretary of State, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister 
Serhiy Tyhypko and his Polish counterpart, Przemyslaw Grudzinski, 
praised the program as another step in developing relations among 
the three countries. ``We received U.S. support at a difficult phase 
of our transformation, and we want to share this experience with Ukraine,'' 
Grudzinski told a news conference. Tyhypko said Ukraine could greatly 
benefit from the implementation of macroeconomic reforms, development 
of small businesses and reform of local government envisaged by the 
initiative. He said that Poland's per capita income, which equaled 
that of Ukraine eight years ago, now exceeds Ukraine's three times 
as a result of radical economic reforms implemented over the period. 
``This proves once again that Ukraine must pursue reform policies,'' 
Tyhypko said. The U.S. Agency for International Development is to 
provide much of the funding for the program's projects, including 
training for local government officials, educational seminars and 
projects to assist small businesses.
