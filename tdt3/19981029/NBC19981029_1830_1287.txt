In the Middle East -- a major Arab terrorism leader is under house 
arrest, and a failed Palestinian suicide bomb attack may have given 
the recent peace agreement a boost. The bomber tried to blow up a 
school bus filled with children. NBC's Martin Fletcher. It's the third 
terrorist attack in the week since the wye peace agreement was signed 
in Maryland. Early his morning, a car packed with high explosives 
speeds straight at a School bus full of Jewish children. With moments 
to spare, Israeli soldiers see the car and ram it with their jeep. 
A tremendous explosion. One soldier dies, along with the suicide bomber. 
The bus is rocked, but 40 children are safe. None hurt. Hamas, the 
Islamic military group claims responsibility, threatening "Revolution 
until victory" for them, means death of the peace process. Furious, 
Israel's prime minister Netanyahu warns Yasser Arafat. If the wye 
agreement is to have any meaning, the Palestinian authority must crack 
down in the most forceful way. In an unprecedented move, Arafat responds 
immediately. His police strike at the heart of Hamas, placing its 
leader, sheikh Ahmed yassin, under house arrest and jailing other 
Hamas commanders and fighters. So in saving the peace process, experts 
say, Arafat risks a backlash from those Palestinians who support Hamas. 
There is a heavy price to pay if they get into violent actions again. 
It is the bloody cycle here. Whenever peace seems close, extremists 
from both sides sabotage all hopes. And tonight, right-wing Jews are 
threatening revenge for today's attack on the school bus. Marvin Fletcher, 
NBC news, Tel Aviv.
