Major League Baseball is denying a report in the Toronto Globe and 
Mail that says the League plans to ban the use of Androsteindione, 
the muscle building dietary supplement used by home run champion Mark 
McGuire. The newspaper cited unidentified sources who say they expect 
the baseball Commissioner, But Sealig, to formerly announce a ban 
before Spring training begins in February. But Major League Baseball 
spokesman, Richard Levin told VOA Sports the newspaper report is speculative 
and premature. We have experts in the area that are looking into the 
subject matters. We're working together with the union on this. They're 
in the process of doing that. They have not yet filed a report to 
us and until such time, any speculation about, you know, exactly what 
action we're going to take is, as I said, very premature. Mr. Levin 
said baseball does have medical experts investigating and the League 
is working with the players' union on the matter. He added baseball 
officials want to know exactly what Androsteindione does and if there 
are any long term side effects. The substance is banned by the International 
Olympic Committee, the U.S. National Football League and by the main 
governing body for U.S. collegiate sports.
