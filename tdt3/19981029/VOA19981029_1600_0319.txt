The Taliban faction of Afghanistan and its opponents have agreed to 
release 2,000 prisoners in a phased exchange. A Taliban spokesman 
says both sides will release 150 prisoners every day until 2,000 men 
are freed. The exchange was brokered by Sayad Gelal, a close confidante 
of Saudi Arabia's Crowned Prince. Mr. Gelal was in Afghanistan this 
week.
