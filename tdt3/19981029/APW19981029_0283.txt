Speeding drivers caught in the act will find themselves confronting 
not only police but handicapped victims of auto accidents _ a test 
to see if reality can deter reckless driving. The weekend, which marks 
the end of the All Saints Day holiday, is traditionally a high-risk 
weekend on French roads, with 26-30 deaths a day, instead of the 20-22 
deaths usually counted at this time of year. The test operation will 
be limited to three regions around Paris -- Seine-et-Marne in the 
east, Yvelines in the west and Essonne in the south. If successful, 
it is to be put into effect around France, according to Isabelle Massin, 
in charge of road security. ``Young handicapped people won't be there 
to give lessons,'' Massin was quoted as saying in Thursday's edition 
of Le Parisien, ``but to serve as witnesses to their own daily lives 
and say, `Tomorrow don't become like us.''' The wish, Massin told 
the daily, is that such dramas will speak more loudly than the statistics 
-- 8,000 dead and 30,000 injured on French highways last year. She 
said that 1998 is proving to be a particularly murderous year, with 
an additional 300 deaths expected. The handicapped will accompany 
police who stop cars for speeding and other infractions like drunken 
driving. They will then meet with the drivers along the side of the 
road. The handicapped involved in the operation belong to the Association 
of the Paralyzed of France and the National Union of Families of Cranial 
Trauma.
