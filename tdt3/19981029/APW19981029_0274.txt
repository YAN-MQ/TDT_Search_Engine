A dissident who was detained in July for trying to join an illegal 
opposition party has been allowed to register to run for mayor of 
a village in southeastern China, a human rights group said Thursday. 
Yu Tielong received permission Tuesday to run in an election next 
Monday in Wangshanding in Zhejiang province, the Hong Kong-based Information 
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. Such 
elections have been held since 1987 in some 930,000 villages throughout 
China. Committees picked through nonpartisan voting decide how to 
spend government money and implement national policies on birth control 
and other matters. Yu was detained for 10 hours on July 9 by police 
in Hangzhou, his hometown and the capital of Zhejiang, after trying 
to join the China Democracy Party. Authorities in at least nine provinces 
have rejected attempts to register the party, which would challenge 
the Communist Party monopoly on political activity. Yu was one of 
at least a dozen dissidents detained recently by police. At least 
three of those detained were associated with the China Democracy Party. 
``If he is successful in the Nov. 2 vote ... this will symbolize a 
small step forward for the China Democracy Party,'' the Information 
Center said. Yu also has campaigned publicly against corruption. He 
announced plans in August to circulate a petition demanding a new, 
public trial for former Mayor Chen Xitong of Beijing. Chen was sentenced 
this year to 16 years in prison for corruption, but critics complained 
that the trial was held in secret. The Information Center also said 
three opposition candidates in Beijing will defy an official order 
not to run for the city legislature in elections next month. The trio 
said in September that police had told them they couldn't run, tore 
down campaign posters and tried to talk them out of running. The group 
includes Gao Hongming, who spent two years in a labor camp after the 
1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations.
