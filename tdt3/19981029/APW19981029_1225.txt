Pete Sampras made sure of extending his No. 1 reign for at least another 
week by beating Bohdan Ulihrach 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday to reach the 
quarterfinals of the dlrs 2.45 Eurocard Open. Had he lost, Sampras 
could have lost the top spot to either No. 2 Marcelo Rios or No. 3 
Patrick Rafter. But Sampras needed just under an hour to beat Ulihrach, 
who had won two of their three previous matches. The victory assured 
Sampras of remaining No. 1 when the new rankings come out Monday. 
Sampras is seeking to become the first player to finish as No. 1 for 
six years in a row. ``It's a record that might not ever be broken. 
It is that hard to do,'' Sampras said. ``I feel like I am on a good 
road.'' Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open champion, lost some ground 
when he was beaten by Greg Rusedski. Rusedski won 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (5-7), 
6-4. The battle for No. 1 is unlikely to be settled before the season-ending 
World Championship in Hanover, Germany, next month. Richard Krajicek 
stopped Andre Agassi's recent roll when he upset the American 6-3, 
6-4. In a showdown between two former Wimbledon champions, Krajicek 
used his serve-and-volley game to overpower Agassi and reach the quarterfinals. 
Tenth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov also advanced by beating Todd Martin 
6-4, 7-5, and Jan-Michael Gambill upset ninth-seeded Tim Henman 7-6 
(7-2), 1-6, 7-6 (7-5). Goran Ivanisevic, seeded 14th, ended the run 
of Boris Becker, the crowd's sentimental favorite, with a 7-6 (7-5), 
7-6 (7-5) victory. Becker is in semi-retirement and this could have 
been his last tournament at home. Ivanisevic fired 17 aces, Becker 
16. ``I was a bit unlucky today,'' Becker said. In an all-Swedish 
battle, Jonas Bjorkman rallied to beat Thomas Johansson 2-6, 6-4, 
6-2. Krajicek, who is ranked No. 11 in the world, is trying to clinch 
one of the last two places available for the eight-man Hanover championship. 
Agassi already has qualified for Hanover and surged to No. 5 in the 
world after winning last week's tournament in Ostrava, Czech Republic. 
A former No. 1, Agassi was ranked No. 141 at this time last year and 
playing challenger events. Now, he is in the Top 5 for the first time 
since July 15, 1996. Winner of five titles this year, Agassi could 
not tame Krajicek's monster serve. Agassi won only nine points on 
Krajicek's serve. ``When he serves that well, it's very difficult,'' 
Agassi said. ``He is a tough guy to develop any rhythm against. He 
likes the court here. All he had to do was break my serve twice.'' 
Krajicek won the title here in 1995 and reached the final last year. 
``I am very satisfied with the way I played today,'' he said. ``I 
served very well from the start and I put a lot of pressure on him. 
Eventually, he was going to miss a few passing shots,'' said Krajicek, 
who will have surgery on his left knee after the indoor season. ``It's 
a long road to Hanover, it doesn't seem that far away in time but 
an eternity in points,'' said Krajicek, who hit nine aces. The Dutchman 
trails three players _ Karol Kucera, Petr Korda and Henman in points 
for Hanover. All three have lost here and Krajicek could gain some 
ground if he does well in this tournament. Gambill, a 21-year-old 
American, survived 25 aces by Henman to beat the Briton for the second 
time this year. As No. 9 in the world, Henman is the highest-ranked 
player Gambill has ever beaten and his first Top 10 victim. ``Nobody 
has aced me that much,'' Gambill said. ``He actually played a better 
match. He served a lot better than I did. I just scraped and did my 
best from the baseline.'' At the time of the Australian Open, Gambill 
was No. 227 in the world. Now, he is No. 50. ``My goal for the year 
was to get into the Top 100,'' he said. In the quarterfinals, Gambill 
plays Sampras, while Ivanisevic meets Krajicek.
