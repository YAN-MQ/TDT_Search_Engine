Four Central Americans are being held in Cuba and have been charged 
with taking part in a bombing campaign that began last year, the Cuban 
government announced Thursday. It contended that a Cuban exile who 
boasted of organizing the attacks had recruited the suspects. The 
Interior Ministry said in Havana that one Salvadoran and three Guatemalans 
were intercepted trying to smuggle explosives into the island earlier 
this year. All four, the note maintained, were deployed by Luis Posada 
Carriles, a shadowy exile whom the Communist government of Fidel Castro 
regards as its most relentless enemy. During five months last year, 
bombs exploded at nearly 1 dozen hotels, restaurants and discotheques 
in Havana and at the resort of Varadero. An Italian tourist was killed. 
In tape-recorded interviews with The New York Times in June, Posada 
acknowledged organizing and directing the bomb campaign, saying he 
wanted to hurt Cuba's tourism industry, which is Havana's largest 
source of foreign exchange.
