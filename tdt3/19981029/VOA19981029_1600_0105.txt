The Palestinian Authority has placed a leader of the militant Palestinian 
group Hamas, Sheik Achmed Yasin under house arrest after his group 
claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that targeted an Israeli 
school bus. VOA's Al Pessin in Jerusalem reports the children escaped 
without serious injury, but a 19 year old Israeli solider was killed 
in that blast. This is the first time the Palestinian authority has 
moved against Sheik Achmed Yasin since he was released from an Israeli 
jail last year. Palestinian security officials have said recent statements 
by the Sheik are against Palestinian interests, including his criticism 
of last week's Israeli/Palestinian agreement signed in Washington. 
Under that accord, the Authority is obligated to crack down on violent 
militant groups like Hamas in return for further Israeli troop withdrawals 
on the West Bank. Until now, both Sheik Yasin and the Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat have avoided direct confrontation in spite of 
their disagreements. The Sheik's house arrest and the detention of 
dozens of lower level Hamas activists came after 40 Israeli school 
children narrowly avoided a powerful Hamas suicide car bomb aimed 
at their school bus in Gaza. Al Pessin, VOA News, Jerusalem.
