The United Nations announced new age requirements for U.N. peacekeepers 
Thursday, hoping to set an example for countries to refrain from using 
children under 18 in their own forces. The United Nations is now asking 
that governments not send civilian police and military observers younger 
than 25 to serve in U.N. peackeeping operations. Troops in national 
contingents should preferably be 21 but no younger than 18, the under-secretary 
general for peacekeeping, Bernard Miyet, told the General Assembly. 
``This decision has been taken as an additional measure in the organization's 
effort to promote the rights of the child,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard 
said. ``While we have no indication that member governments have provided 
the U.N. with soldiers under the age of 18, this policy has been adopted 
as a proactive measure,'' he said. Human Rights Watch applauded the 
move, saying it was a step in the right direction. The use of child 
combatants has become one of the most devastating aspects of contemporary 
warfare, with more than 300,000 children under 18 currently fighting 
around the world, said Jo Becker, the organization's children's rights 
advocacy director. ``National governments should be doing everything 
possible to stop this horrible practice. Raising their enlistment 
age to 18 is one important move,'' Becker said. The U.N. envoy for 
children and armed conflict, Olara Otunnu, also welcomed the decision, 
saying ``it will strengthen current efforts to promote better protection 
for the most vulnerable sections of the population in peacekeeping 
situations.''
