Pirates in a wide, blue sea are clues to today's geography stumper. 
Unlawful activities on the high seas in the distant past attracted 
Britain to our mystery spot, located on the Persian Gulf, Dashetim 
is part of the United Arab Amorites. Unlike its neighbors, this spot 
makes its living out of trade, more than oil. It's often been called 
the Arab version of Hong Kong, because of its trading port and accessibility 
to most of Eurasia. In fact, you can even buy a car at the airport, 
while you're waiting for your next flight. And speaking of cars, this 
week, our mystery spot gained a place in automotive history. For seven 
days, any driver who follows all the rules of the road gets a financial 
reward for good behavior. So, where is this Arab haven for good drivers? 
Start your engines, we'll shift into answer gear in just a few minutes.
