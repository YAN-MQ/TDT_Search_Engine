This was another of those moments when the world's attention was focused 
on an idea and a man who wanted to make it come true. A time, again, 
when America showed off its best side, not its sordid side. nbc's 
bob faw. It is a journey of science and sentiment, and everywhere, 
it seemed, a nation stopped whatever it was doing and watched. Speed 
at 2 thousand miles an hour. Wishing John Glenn godspeed all the way 
now. If only for a few, fiery moments, the country was united. The 
tingle and the earth and goose bumps. Then cheers, from the air and 
space museum in Washington, alongside John Glenn's original capsule. 
Applause, too, from the Florida beaches, overflowing with spectators. 
I just think it's the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. Makes us 
proud to be an American. From the giant TV screen atop Times Square 
in New York City to a High definition TV monitor in Washington, where 
children counted down and then watched in wide-eyed wonder, all eyes 
on the Glenn launch. I thought it was amazing to see something like 
this. And the chord struck was not just patriotic. There were salutes 
from a pub on London's west side. If you are young enough and you 
feel young enough, do what you want. And also from Moscow, where the 
mission was monitored by 72-year-old Konstantin feoktistin, Russia's 
oldest cosmonaut. "We have to learn about our limits," he says. It's 
not a waste of money, it's work for the future." 36 years ago, John 
Glenn thrilled us with the sense of possibility. This time he thrilled 
older Americans when he left conventional definitions on the launchpad. 
Every time you hear the word old, old gets older. I just think it 
is cool that I should get so old and do such a cool thing. For this 
flight, there is a common bond between older and younger americans 
-- pride. My dream is to be a spaceman, too, like John Glenn. American 
heroes, we need morph them. a rero going back up there, and for a 
moment at least making us feel better down here. Bob Faw, NBC news, 
Washington.
