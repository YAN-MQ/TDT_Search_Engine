After being trapped for two weeks, Charlie might need a service for 
animals that Jeanne Moos has discovered in New York. I've covered 
a lot of weird massages over the years -- upside down, four-handed, 
getting walked on, pregnant massage -- but when it comes to which 
rubdown goes down as my favorite -- you feeling any tightness up there? 
Just a little in this area here. The walrus wins, hands down, a 1,750-pound 
female named nuka. He's probably annoyed he's not getting one. Oh, 
my aching blubber. It must be murder dragging yourself onto the rocks. 
And it isn't exactly like sleeping on a waterbed. But of the four 
walruses here at the New York aquarium on Coney Island, only nuka 
needed massage therapy. Is this your first walrus? Yeah, this is my 
first walrus. Anthony gulialmo is a licensed massage therapist who 
usually does people, though he sometimes does horses and dogs, as 
you can tell from his business card. Anthony uses the same moves on 
nuka that he does on humans. Have you guys ever had a massage? yes. 
Only getting a walrus into position is a lot trickier. It requires 
a bucket of fish. It was almost two years ago that keepers noticed 
nuka was having muscle spasms and trouble using her back flippers. 
You can't use Ben gay on a walrus. So you tried muscle relaxers, like 
injections or? -- No, we -- oral ones. But pills didn't help. Anthony 
volunteered to try to loosen her up. Does she look happy? Hard to 
tell with a walrus face, but months of once-A-week massages brought 
significant improvement. Over. And Anthony didn't stop with the walrus. 
He tried massage on "Rudy" the humped-back Penguin as well. So what's 
more fun to massage, a Penguin or a walrus? A walrus. a walrus or 
a person? A walrus. a walrus? Yeah -- --tops all. Is there anything 
else you really wanna massage? I'd like to massage a giraffe. Now 
you know who to call if your giraffe has a crick in its neck. Nuka 
even does stretching exercises, lifting and flapping her flippers. 
Walrus toning. I'll show you something. Stick out your thumb. Nuka, 
suck. Good, open. You haven't lived until you've had your thumb sucked 
by a walrus. Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
