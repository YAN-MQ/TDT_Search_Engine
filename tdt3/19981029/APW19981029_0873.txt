British poet laureate Ted Hughes, whose stormy marriage to the anguished 
American poet Sylvia Plath dogged his reputation after her suicide, 
has died, his publisher said Thursday. He was 68. Hughes died Wednesday 
in a London hospital after a 18-month battle with cancer, which he 
had kept secret, said Matthew Evans, chairman of the publisher Faber 
and Faber. ``Not only was he one of the greatest poets of the 20th 
century, but he was the most extraordinary man,'' Evans said. ``The 
loss to his family is inestimable.'' A collection of searingly intense 
poems published by Hughes this year called ``Birthday Letters'' shed 
new light on his difficult six-year marriage to the tortured Plath, 
brought him sympathy and won him rave reviews. Some Plath fans called 
Hughes a murderer and his name has been repeatedly hacked off of her 
gravestone in Yorkshire, northern England. But the reclusive Hughes 
chose not to defend himself after Plath's suicide on Feb. 11, 1963, 
months after he had left her for another woman. She gassed herself 
in the kitchen, leaving milk and cookies for the couple's two children 
in the next room. Evans noted that there was ``a great deal of understanding'' 
after Hughes put forth his story for the first time _ and revealed 
the obvious depth of his love for Plath _ in the 88 poems that make 
up ``Birthday Letters,'' chronicling the couple's meeting, marriage 
and separation. ``He wanted `Birthday Letters' to be published because 
he knew he was seriously ill. He wanted to publish the work before 
he died,'' the publisher said. ``He regarded it as being of personal 
importance. It was the nearest thing to an autobiography.'' The poems 
surprised many with their startling intimacy. Of the first time the 
couple made love, Hughes wrote: ``You were slim and lithe and smooth 
as a fish./ You were a new world. My new world./So this is America, 
I marveled./ Beautiful, beautiful America.'' Hughes, who has been 
poet laureate since 1984, refused to be interviewed about the poems, 
which span 25 years from the late 1960s. But in a letter read by his 
editor, Christopher Reid, who accepted the Forward Poetry prize for 
``Birthday Letters'' on Hughes' behalf this year, he called the book 
``a gathering of the occasions _ written with no plan over about 25 
years _ in which I tried to open a direct, private, inner contact 
with my first wife, not thinking to make a poem, thinking mainly to 
evoke her presence to myself and to feel her there listening. ``Except 
for a handful, I never thought of publishing these pieces until last 
year, when quite suddenly I realized I had to publish them, no matter 
what the consequences.'' Hughes and Plath married in 1956 after meeting 
at Cambridge, where she was studying on a Fulbright Scholarship. They 
went to the United States in 1957, where she taught at Smith College 
and he taught at the University of Massachusetts. They returned to 
England in 1959, continued to write and publish poetry. Plath had 
a history of mental problems and had first attempted suicide three 
years before meeting Hughes. Poet Andrew Motion, writing in The Times 
of London, said reading ``Birthday Letters'' was ``like being hit 
by a thunderbolt.'' ``Anyone who thought Hughes's reticence was proof 
of his hard heart will immediately see how stony they have been themselves,'' 
Motion wrote. ``Hughes is one of the most important poets of the century, 
and this is his greatest book. It closes in a heart of darkness, a 
black hole of grief and regret. We stare into it feeling changed and 
enriched.'' The book was dedicated to the couple's children, Nicholas 
and Frieda. Before its publication, Frieda, a 34-year-old artist, 
said in a newspaper interview that she had lived under the burden 
of her mother's suicide.
