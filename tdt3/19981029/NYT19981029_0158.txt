As a lonely, newly divorced New Yorker in ``Living Out Loud,'' Holly 
Hunter does lots of talking out loud _ and talking to herself, too. 
She plays Judith Nelson, a woman who pours out her heart while trying 
to get her life back on track. Judith's way of achieving instant intimacy 
with strangers is one of the more literary conceits in this, the first 
feature directed by the screenwriter Richard LaGravenese (``The Fisher 
King,'' ``The Bridges of Madison County,'' ``The Mirror Has Two Faces''). 
The filmmaker has borrowed from Chekhov the soul-baring introspection 
that can be so ineffable on the page or stage yet becomes so damply 
sensitive and dramatically vague on screen. In directing, LaGravenese 
remains very much a writer. He conceives lengthy scenes in which two 
characters sit talking over wine or coffee and the camera plays tennis, 
traveling from one to the other and back. Enlivening this are wild 
flights of fancy springing from Judith's imagination, as when she 
is seen dancing at a model-filled lesbian after-hours club, vamping 
catwalk style in what looks like a Bob Fosse music video. Free-spirited 
as the film hopes to be, it can't easily reconcile such flamboyant 
departures with an otherwise static pace. But music does provide one 
big saving grace: Queen Latifah, sumptuously outfitted as Judith's 
favorite bosom-heaving cabaret singer and stealing every scene she's 
in. The sometime rap star transforms herself sensationally to play 
a glamorous nightclub performer who helps to change Judith's life, 
delivering sultry musical numbers along the way. The ``theatrical 
consultant to Queen Latifah'' listed in the credits (Richard Lyons) 
certainly got his job done. She becomes the film's most attention-getting 
figure _ and the one least likely to talk a blue streak. While Judith's 
trips to the nightclub buoy her spirits, they also pique the curiosity 
of Danny DeVito's Pat, the doorman at Judith's gilded cage on Fifth 
Avenue. (Martin Donovan plays the successful cardiologist who married 
Judith, a nurse, and later left her stranded there.) Being lonely 
himself, Pat feels a growing affinity with the elegant creature who 
keeps tripping in and out of the building alone in her evening clothes. 
But the loosely Chekhovian ``Living Out Loud'' is less about a romance 
between them than about the indirect ways in which they change each 
other's lives. A chance encounter borrowed from ``The Kiss'' (and 
featuring Elias Koteas) is meant to trigger this, but again the film 
counts on more magic than it can conjure. DeVito does shine in what 
could have been a maudlin role, turning Pat into a three-dimensional 
figure and singing ``They Can't Take That Away From Me'' with brio 
on the nightclub's amateur night. Ms. Hunter performs more stiffly 
at times, but she brings intelligence, thwarted passion and obvious 
depth of feeling to Judith's struggle with her past. A sophisticated 
New York City is also a virtual character here. The production design 
(by Nelson Coates) and costumes (by Jeffrey Kurland) suggest a world 
of possibilities for a woman trying to reinvent her life. ``Living 
Out Loud'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult 
guardian). It includes profanity, brief nudity and a scene involving 
sensual massage. LIVING OUT LOUD Written and directed by Richard LaGravenese;
