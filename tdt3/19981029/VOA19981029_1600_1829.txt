The U.S. space shuttle Discovery is heading into space with Senator 
John Glenn, 36 years after he was the first American to orbit the 
earth. With President Clinton, members of Congress and a huge crowd 
looking on, Mr. Glenn and his six crew mates blasted off aboard Discovery 
from Cape Canaveral, Florida. More from VOA's Deborah Tate in Florida. 
After viewing the liftoff from the launch control center, Mr. Clinton 
met with NASA employees to thank them for their work. He said he hopes 
the Discovery mission will boost the American people's interest in 
the space program which he said is good for the country and for the 
world. Now they will learn, over the next few days, all the things 
that are being done in space that advance not only our mission in 
space but the quality of our life here on earth. Earlier in an interview 
with the cable news network, the president denied speculation that 
Senator Glenn, a close Democratic ally, was chosen for the mission 
as a reward for his support of the Clinton White House. He said the 
retiring senator was chosen because he was qualified and that America 
will be well served by his participation. Deborah Tate, VOA News, 
Kennedy Space Center, Florida.
