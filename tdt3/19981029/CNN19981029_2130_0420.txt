The woman who pleaded guilty to killing her newborn son after giving 
birth at her high school prom was sentenced to 15 years in prison 
today. 20-year-old Melissa Drexler could have faced up to 30 years 
but made a plea agreement with prosecutors. Before sentencing, she 
told the court that she was really, truly sorry for what she did. 
The judge in the case said forgiveness should never displace accountability. 
She is a young woman who when faced with a very difficult situation 
made a Very bad choice about how to cope with her problem. And in 
doing so, she committed a crime and took a life. Under the plea agreement, 
Drexler could be released from prison in 2 years and 11 months.
