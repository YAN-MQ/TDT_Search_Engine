Congressional elections are less than a week away, and republicans 
featuring are running a $10 million ad campaign questioning president 
clinton's trustworthiness. In every election there is a big question 
to think about -- this year the question is -- Several ads make indirect 
reference to the Monica Lewinsky controversy. This campaign represents 
a strategy shift for the republicans. They've been reluctant to bring 
up the Lewinsky issue for fear of a voter backlash. But some republicans 
willing to risk it. We decided really over time that we couldn't continue 
to ignore Bill clinton. He is the leader of the democrat party. He 
symbolizes the opposition to tax cuts, welfare reform, saving social 
security the way we want to save social security, balanced budgets. 
At the end of a campaign, he just brings together in a neat summary 
all that we're running against. Just as the democrats ran against 
Newt Gingrich as the leader of our party, we're running against the 
symbol of the democrat party.
