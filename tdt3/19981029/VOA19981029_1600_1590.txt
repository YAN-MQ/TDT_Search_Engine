And at the Catholic church, a senior Vatican official has called for 
honest reflection on church history -- this as he opened a three day 
symposium on the Inquisition. Cardinal Roger Esegery issued the call 
as he opened the meeting of leading Inquisition scholars to the Vatican. 
The sessions are to examine the organization, procedures and historical 
context of the inquisition, also known as the Holy Office, set up 
to defend church teachings back in the 13th century. Many historians 
consider the Inquisition with its secret trials and use of torture 
against heretics as a symbol of intolerance and one of the darkest 
chapters in church history. The meeting is to prepare a report to 
Pope John Paul. That report will help him decide if there is sufficient 
grounds to issue a statement publicly, recognizing some of the abuses 
prior to the start of the new millennium.
