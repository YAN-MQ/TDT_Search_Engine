Turkey is celebrating its 75th anniversary. And everyone from tourists 
to business travelers are expected to join the festivities. Stephanie 
Oswald has some tips for any trip in today's edition of working ahead. 
Istanbul is a Mecca for tourists looking for a cultural experience, 
blending both east and west. Making the most of your trip here begins 
with good planning. Visitors from the United States and some European 
countries will need visas. Get them at the border Gates or at any 
Turkish consulate for $45. Planning to shop at one of the city's famous 
bazaars? You should know the national monetary system is the Turkish 
lira. The exchange rate is around 285,000 lira to the U.S. dollar 
-- making this country a real bargain. Still, there are more ways 
to stretch your money. Charge whenever possible -- and this applies 
not just in Turkey, but in many countries around the world. You get 
a more favorable exchange rate. Travel agents advise first-time visitors 
to let a tour operator lead the way. Turkish people are known for 
their hospitality. If you admire a Turkish object in their home, you 
have to be very careful. They may force you to take it with you. They're 
very generous people. And I think that's one of the main surprises 
for American tourists -- that openness and generosity. Part of the 
reason -- in Turkey, a traveler is considered to be a Gift from God. 
So no matter where you're coming from, a visit here is likely to be 
a Welcome one. Stephanie Oswald, CNN, reporting.
