While today's flight is in no danger, NASA does have a procedure in 
place should the shuttle encounter some disaster or pose a threat 
to earth. John Zarrella reports. T minus 30 seconds and counting. 
About half a dozen times a year, two men sitting at these consoles 
in a top-secret building hold the power of life and death. We're here 
to protect the public, and the crew is kind of a secondary issue. 
These men are flight control officers. If a space shuttle ever goes 
out of control, they and only they have the authority and ability 
to destroy the vehicle, whether the crew is still alive or not. If 
they have to push the button, there's probably a chance that the astronauts 
are out of the loop anyway. So, they're just protecting the people 
on the ground. T-minus 20 seconds and counting. It has to be that 
way, in that the time lines we're considering here are so short, that 
there isn't time to discuss it amongst a large number of people. Time 
after time, in their secluded Bunker, they run through simulated shuttle 
launches -- rehearsing every possible scenario that might require 
them to terminate a space shuttle mission. Three, two, one -- The 
first two minutes of flight, while the solid rocket boosters are attached 
to the vehicle, are the most dangerous. Your heart rate does increase 
a little bit. You feel a little bit of adrenalin. Inside each booster 
are explosive charges. If a main engine fails, a booster shuts down, 
a fire breaks out, the shuttle could be knocked off course and head 
toward a populated area. Within seconds, the flight controllers must 
decide whether to throw the toggle switch to destruct. In this simulation, 
the shuttle stays on course. During an actual launch, if something 
goes wrong, the flight controllers track where the vehicle is heading. 
If it approaches predetermined boundary lines, the shuttle must be 
destroyed to shield civilians from falling debris. This simulation 
is about over. The launch was smooth. No action was needed. John Zarrella, 
CNN, cape Canaveral air force station, Florida.
