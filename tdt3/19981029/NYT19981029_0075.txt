The birthday party invitation, from a friend in Minneapolis, was computer-generated, 
printed on a brochure-style triptych. It read ``By the time I turned 
30, I thought I would have ... the perfect career ... a husband ... 
a kid ... and a house.'' The lines are accompanied by clip-art: a 
woman with a briefcase, a man and woman in formal dress gazing into 
each other's eyes as they dance, a cute baby curled over to touch 
his toes and a contemporary suburban ranch home. Opening the first 
panel, it continued, ``Instead, I'm relieved that I don't have ... 
a workaholic life ... an ex-husband ... day-care worries ... or a 
mortgage.'' Again, with illustrations of a woman in a business suit 
midway up a ladder, a man perusing a laptop computer, the same baby 
crying, and a checkbook with $1,500 made out to ``The Bank.'' The 
next panel: ``I'm really happy that I have: many talents and many 
interesting adventures ... lovely friends and a loving family ... 
two sweet kitties ... and an apartment with real furniture. So come 
celebrate my 30th birthday!'' Heidi has always done unconventional 
things. She quit journalism to go into construction work, subsidized 
her creative writing by working on assembly lines in a variety of 
factories and is one of the most creative people I know. So I wasn't 
surprised that she was throwing a bash to celebrate how her life had 
evolved contrary to expectations. By 30, apparently, it was time to 
take stock and look at what she had, not what she didn't. After all, 
as almost everyone found out who stayed on the road best traveled 
by minivan, it's not all peaches and parties from this side, either. 
But, to be truthful, Heidi is the exception. Most of my friends who 
aren't married yet want to be. Most who are married but don't have 
kids yet are trying. And most of my friends who swore they'd never 
own a couch, let alone a house, are well-entrenched in their three-bedroom, 
two-baths. The vision of Prince Charming and the white picket fence 
isn't so easy to dislodge. Partly, of course, because there's some 
truth to it. Romance is magical. Love is grand. Babies make you ``grow 
a new heart,'' as Rosie O'Donnell said after she adopted. But my friend 
Heidi is right about the downside. Many marriages won't last until 
death do us part. Being a parent means giving up substantial amounts 
of money and time and more than a few personal goals. And a house 
anchors you firmly by the weight of what you store there. ``I remember 
when everything I owned could fit in a car,'' an older reporter said 
to me as I drove off after my first internship. He said it with envy. 
I didn't understand what he meant then. I do now. So, as it ends up, 
my married-with-children friends spend a great deal of time waxing 
nostalgic about the carefree adventures of their solo days. Can life 
be such a balanced tradeoff? Does every choice negate something else? 
Therapists would say the marriage, the children, the commitments, 
are ways of developing ... every bit as enlightening as a trek across 
Europe or a solitary summer spent keeping a journal in a cabin by 
a lake. They would also say that the single life, well led, can be 
just as rewarding ... creating a family of your own devising, having 
time to pursue your talents, interests and passions. (That's the thing 
about therapists. They can be an irritatingly affirmative bunch.) 
As I watch the new crop of coming-of-age television dramas _ ``Ally 
McBeal,'' ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Dawson's Creek,'' and ``Felicity'' 
_ I am struck by how clever and wise and jaded and worldly these teens 
and twentysomethings sound. Somehow, even while championing their 
angst and confusion, they are able to find courage hidden beneath 
their insecurities; cut to the heart of conflicts; value true friendships; 
and have torrid, exciting and meaningful relationships. Of course 
they are. Thirty- and fortysomething television writers are scripting 
their dialogue. If we only knew then what we know now. (Mary J. Loftus 
is a New York Times Regional Newspapers feature writer. She has master's 
and specialist degrees in marriage and family counseling.)
