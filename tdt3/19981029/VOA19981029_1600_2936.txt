We had a very, very good day on Wall Street, Dow Jones Industrial 
average closing at 8,495. That was up 123 points, more than one percent. 
Standard & Poor's 500 index closed at 1,085. That was up 17 points. 
Analysts say traders were optimistic about improvements in the international 
financial situation, especially in Latin America where, of course, 
the Brazilian government has announced some austerity measures. It 
was also a strong movement back into stocks by many mutual fund managers.
