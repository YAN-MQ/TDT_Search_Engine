A Bosnian Serb accused of war crimes has pleaded guilty to at least 
12 murders before the UN tribunal in the Hague but denied a charge 
of genocide. Thirty-two year old Goran Gelasitch says he was admitting 
to the murders to cleanse his soul. He also pleaded guilty to a total 
of 31 counts of crimes against humanity and violating the rules of 
war.
