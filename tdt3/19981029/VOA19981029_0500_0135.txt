A South African court allows the release of the report from the Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission. VOA's own Alex Belida files from Johannesburg. 
The report on South Africa's apartheid past focuses on atrocities 
and other human rights abuses committed by the country's former white 
rulers. But it also says some actions undertaken by the African National 
Congress in its struggle against white rule, or what it calls gross 
abuses of human rights. The ANC launched a late bid to block release 
of the report saying it had not been given sufficient time to respond 
to the findings, a challenge which prompted Truth panel chairman Desmod 
Tutu to say he was devastated. But a high court judge in Capetown 
threw out the ANC bid to block the report's publication after a night 
of legal maneuvering. There was no immediate reaction from the ruling 
party. Alex Belida, VOA News, Johannesburg.
