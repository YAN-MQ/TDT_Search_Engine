U.S. orders for expensive so-called durable goods unexpectedly rose 
in September from the previous month amid rising demand for electrical 
equipment and industrial machinery. Durable goods orders increased 
nine-tenths of one percent last month. Anthony Chan, economist at 
Bank One Investment Advisors, told Bloomberg News that the report 
shows the strength of the U.S. economy. It just tells us that the 
U.S. economy has a lot of resiliency. It certainly tells us that the 
easing that the Federal Reserve has conducted thus far is likely to 
have an impact because this is not an economy that is on its knees. 
Yes, there are some problems. Yes, the economy will be slowing down, 
but it's not likely to slow down to anything close to a recession 
anytime soon. However, other economists caution that much of the increase 
was the result of increases in defense related orders.
