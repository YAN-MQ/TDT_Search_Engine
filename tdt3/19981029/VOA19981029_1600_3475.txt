Well, at this time of the year, many Americans are carving pumpkins 
to make Halloween decorations and it's the busy season for an Ohio 
man named Jerry Ayres Until a few years ago he was a financial planner 
and an insurance broker, then he turned his hobby of pumpkin carving 
into a full time business. Mr. Ayres sells a line of pumpkin carving 
knives plus books and videos about sculpting pumpkins. Mr. Ayres was 
looking forward to the end of pumpkin season so his cracked and cut 
hands will have a rest and a chance to heal. We mentioned, of course 
-- well, yesterday, that Susan carved her pumpkin not too long ago, 
but I understand nature has taken its course and... yes, tom. ... 
your beautiful work of art is turning into something -- Yes, my poor 
pumpkin is beginning to dry up and I don't know if it'll make it to 
Halloween night on Saturday, but it's beginning to look like a dried 
apricot instead of a pumpkin. It hardly seems like a work of art. 
I know. Hardly anything that Mr. Ayres would be proud of. No, I don't 
think so. I'm glad he's not coming by my house for trick or treat. 
no.
