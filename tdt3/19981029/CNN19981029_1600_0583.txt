California voters will soon decide if the sale of horse meat for human 
consumption will be banned. Rusty Dornin has more on the controversy 
in a report that we warn you contains some graphic images. It sells 
for up to $15 a pound in France. And while some people in the U.S. 
might shudder at the thought, in Europe, eating horse flesh is considered 
a delicacy. But some Californians would like to save horses sold here 
from ending up on the dinner table there. Next week, voters will be 
asked to ban the slaughter of horses and sale of horse meat for human 
consumption -- proposition six, the "save the horses" initiative. 
We don't think horses belong in the food chain. Humans have bred them 
specifically to not be food animals, but to be our partners in work, 
in war, in pleasure. We give them names. We don't do that to cows. 
There are no equine slaughterhouses in California. Last year, 3,000 
horses were sold and sent from California to other states to be butchered. 
Jim Warren owns a livestock auction yard. Warren says very few horses 
end up on someone's plate. But he has the right to sell them for that 
use. That horse is your private property, it's to do with what you 
want. I don't think the government has the right to tell us what we 
can do with our own private property. For some, there's nothing wrong 
with horse meat on the menu. If we eat cows and pigs and goats and 
sheep and chickens, we should be allowed to eat horses. But for many 
people, horses are like other domestic pets, and there are laws protecting 
dogs and cats. It's not right that people eat horses -- horse meat. 
I think it's pretty barbarian. And horses being consumed, probably 
not a good idea. For proponents of prop six, the way horses are killed 
for human consumption is their biggest objection. Yes, on proposition 
six. They claim it's cruel. Horses slaughtered for glue and pet food 
are injected with drugs -- a more humane method, they say. There is 
no organized opposition. The only television ads voters see show bloody 
scenes of slaughterhouses. A powerful tool, one proponents hope will 
trigger an emotional response at the ballot box. Rusty Dornin, CNN, 
San Francisco.
