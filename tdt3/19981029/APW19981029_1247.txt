Top seeds Nathalie Tauziat and Mary Pierce remained on course for 
an all-French final at the dlrs 164,250 Seat Luxembourg Open after 
both won their quarterfinals in straight sets Thursday. Top-seeded 
Tauziat, who reached the Wimbledon final this year, had little trouble 
is disposing of Germany's Anke Hueber, the No. 6 seed, 6-3, 6-3. Mary 
Pierce, coming off a tournament win in Moscow, swept past fifth-seeded 
Ai Sugiyama 6-3, 6-2. Pierce, ranked 11th in the world, will face 
Elena Likhovtseva in Friday's semifinal. In an all Russian quarterfinal, 
Likhovtseva, 27 in the WTA rankings, showed no mercy for Evgenia Koulikovskaya, 
6-2, 6-0. The No. 3 seed Irina Spirlea of Romania became the biggest 
victim so far in the tournament. She went down to Silvia Farina in 
a marathon match. The Italian, No. 24 in the world, won 6-4, 4-6, 
6-3 to force a semifinal against Tauziat, ranked 17 places ahead of 
her.
