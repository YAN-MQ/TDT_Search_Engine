The sale of the ailing bank Credit Lyonnais will go ahead in the first 
half of next year, markets willing, French Finance Minister Dominique 
Strauss-Kahn announced Thursday. But he made clear that France's Socialist-led 
government has built in a protection structure against hostile suitors. 
A careful shareholder structure ``is the best way to guarantee the 
interests of the state, the bank, employees and tax payers,'' Strauss-Kahn 
told a news conference. The government plans to construct a core minority 
share holding group in the bank, holding less than a one-third stake 
and made up of Credit Lyonnais' current commercial partners, or any 
new investors who want to set up commercial ties with the bank, he 
said. These shareholders will underwrite an 8-billion franc (about 
dlrs 1.5 billion) capital increase in the bank in early 1999. The 
government intends to retain a 10 percent stake in Credit Lyonnais, 
the minister said. Taken with the core share holding group, this would 
create a blocking minority interest in the group. The rest of Credit 
Lyonnais's shares will be floated to the public in the first half 
of 1999, market conditions permitting, Strauss-Kahn said. He expressed 
optimism that the current global financial crisis will have ebbed 
by then. The announcement on Credit Lyonnais' privatization follows 
the decision May 20 by the European Union to approve a French government 
rescue package for the bank. In return, the French government agreed 
the bank had to shed 620 billion francs (about dlrs 112 billion) in 
assets and be privatized before October 1999. The French arrangement 
implies there is unlikely to be a repeat of the events of last year 
when Italian insurer Assicurazione Generalli made a hostile takeover 
bid for formerly state-owned Assurances Generales de France. That 
move was stymied by German insurer Allianz, encouraged by the French 
government, which made a friendly counter bid for AGF that included 
a commitment to respect the French insurer's autonomy. Allianz is 
one of three companies which has voiced its interest in taking a small 
stake in Credit Lyonnais as part of a core share holding group. French 
insurer AXA and investment bank Paribas, both with close commercial 
ties to Credit Lyonnais, have also said they would like to do the 
same. Strauss-Kahn said that Societe Generale was the only major French 
bank that he had not heard express an interest in Credit Lyonnais.
