The Palestinian authorities have placed the leader of the radical 
Islamic group Hamas under house arrest. The detention of Sheik Akhmed 
Yassein as part of a big security operation, following a bomb attack 
in the Gaza strip. The bomb was detonated as an Israeli school bus 
approached a road junction. Paul Adams has more. This was a large 
bomb designed to cause mayhem and suffering. Only the quick action 
of an Israeli soldier who positioned his jeep between the school bus 
he was escorting and a car driven by a Palestinian averted a massacre. 
The children escaped, but the soldier and bomber were both killed. 
Yassir Arafat and Benyamin Netanyahu spoke by telephone soon afterwards. 
Mr. Arafat said he condemned the attack and assured the prime minister 
that he was doing everything in his power to find those responsible. 
Mr. Netanyahu said only tough Palestinian action would guarantee the 
future of the agreement reached last week in Maryland. Paul Adams,
