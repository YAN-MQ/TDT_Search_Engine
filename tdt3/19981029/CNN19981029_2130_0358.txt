Still "Mitch," but no longer a hurricane. The storm we've been tracking 
all week was downgraded to a tropical storm today. The system's top 
winds are now about 60 miles an hour. Because Mitch is relatively 
stationary, it has been dropping rain, 25 inches in some areas, causing 
flooding and mud slides. Hard hit are parts of Mexico on the Yucatan 
peninsula, Belize, Guatemala, and especially Honduras, where the center 
of the storm has been hovering for days. The associated press is reporting 
at least 36 deaths from the storm. While Mitch is now sitting well 
over land, the national hurricane center warns it could strengthen 
if it moves back over open water.
