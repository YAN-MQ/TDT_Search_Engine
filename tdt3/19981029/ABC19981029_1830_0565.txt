In south Africa today, the truth about truth Africa. And reconciliation. 
For more than two years now, south Africans have been investigating 
the abuses of their past. A commission led by archbishop Desmond Tutu 
has heard horror stories from white racists bent on maintaining white 
power, and from blacks who often committed violence in their struggle 
to be free. Here's ABC's Sheila MacVicar on the final report. It was 
supposed to bring reconciliation. Instead, the publication of the 
truth about south Africa's past has brought more division. The African 
national Congress, which led the struggle against white minority government 
never expected to be equated in any way with the crimes of the old 
regime. That, in our view, is criminalizing a legitimate people's 
war, and people's struggles. Archbishop Desmond Tutu ran the commission, 
listening to talea of horror and grief. Sometimes, he simply wept. 
He pleaded with Winnie Mandela, a heroine of the struggle, to apologize 
for her crimes when she was accused of sanctioning murder. I beg you, 
please. She was one of those named today. But most of those named 
are the former members of the white regime and their allies, who had 
been brought face to face with their victims. What kind of man are 
you? What kind of man can do these things? Archbishop Tutu gave his 
report to south African President Nelson mandela today. I accept the 
report as it is, with all its imperfections to help reconcile and 
build our nation. In spite of the show of harmony, reconciliation 
in south Africa is clearly still a work in progress. Sheila MacVicar, 
ABC News, London.
