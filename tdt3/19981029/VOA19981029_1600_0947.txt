Also in Eastern Europe, 2,000 unarmed foreign observers will soon 
be in Kosovo Province, making sure Yugoslav forces are living up to 
cease fire and other international agreements. NATO sources say concerns 
for the safety of the verifiers is prompting urgent planning for a 
protection force. Some of that work will be discussed at NATO Friday. 
VOA's Jim Randle reports. NATO sources say the extraction force will 
likely consist of a couple of thousand soldiers. The Pentagon says 
the over the horizon force will not have American ground troops but 
Washington may offer other kinds of help. Top U.S. officials have 
said the protection force will probably be based near Kosovo in the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, but a spokesman for the Macedonian 
Defense Ministry says such an agreement has not yet been worked out. 
NATO military planners are still working out details, including the 
force size, needed equipment and which nations will provide troops. 
The alliance says it's considering putting the troops in Albania, 
Macedonia or at sea on ships but no final decision has been made. 
Planners are working quickly because more than 150 monitors, mostly 
diplomats, are already on the ground in Kosovo and that number is 
expected to double shortly. Jim Randle, VOA News, at the Pentagon.
