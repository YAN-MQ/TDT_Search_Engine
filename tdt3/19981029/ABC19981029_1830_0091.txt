Let's go to the cape now, cape Canaveral and pick it up with ABC's 
Morton dean. As he went through his prelaunch routine today, Glenn 
seemed as unruffled and at ease as he was on that morning 36 years 
ago. He repeatedly smiled his best smile and gave his best comeback 
pilot's thumbs up, proving that the right stuff ages well. When he 
made that first trip, the oldest of his "discovery" crewmates was 
only 9. one wasn't even born yet. Glenn easily squirmed into the middle 
seat on the shuttle's middeck for the ride into space. Welcome aboard, 
John Glenn. Roger. Thank you. There were several delays today. Receiving 
information, there are aircraft in the area. Minor problems, including 
a small plane violated the shuttle's airspace. For John Glenn, another 
19 minutes was no big deal. In a place where there have been many 
emotional highs, this ranked among the highest. Thanks to the Glenn 
factor, no one was untouched. Not the workers at the space center. 
Not the president and the first lady, who watched from a rooftop here. 
Not the tens of thousands of residents and tourists who gathered for 
miles around. We saw him the other time and this time was just fabulous 
to know that he was that old and could still do this. But the launch 
was not perfect. What appears to be a panel was jarred loose. The 
panel is believed to cover where a drag shoot is housed, a chute used 
when the shuttle lands. NASA said late today it would have no effect 
on the mission. But it would be studied further. However, it would 
take a lot more than that to diminish the echoes of godspeed, John 
Glenn that were still being heard here. Morton dean, ABC News, Kennedy 
space center, Florida.
