One more reminder that, like so much else from the time of John Glenn's 
first flight, the idea of age is not what it once was. Grandfather 
John Glenn, who once before took us to places we had not been, is 
doing it again tonight, in a new way. The debate over the scientific 
merits of his mission is honest and worthwhile, but it's also worthwhile 
to have an excuse to cheer a man and his dream, to admire his family, 
and to watch in awe as American invention takes us to another frontier.
