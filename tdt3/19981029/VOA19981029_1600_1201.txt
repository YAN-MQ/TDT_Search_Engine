National Basketball Association players and team owners will continue 
talks on the phone today, after ending face-to-face talks early Thursday 
morning. The two sides met in New York until after midnight on Wednesday 
but no -- are no closer that is to ending a player lockout that has 
led to the cancellation of the first month of the regular season. 
Commissioner David Stern said after the talks the two sides have a 
skeleton of agreement but no guts yet. You can assume that for each 
day we go or each week progresses, there's another week that doesn't 
get played. We don't want to -- we don't even want it to be misconstrued. 
We don't want -- Russ and I don't want to have press conferences, 
you now, sort of like groundhog sightings. We're here to announce 
that another two weeks are being canceled. Chicago Bulls star Michael 
Jordan says that he did a lot of talking Wednesday because of his 
stature and to ensure the future of other players. I maybe talked 
more than most people would have but I've been there in some respects. 
I am kind of one of the oldest players here and I feel because of 
that and because of, you know, where I stand in terms of, you know, 
the League, it's an obligation to make sure that the players of tomorrow 
is protected. In all, 194 games have been canceled and each team's 
82 game schedule has been reduced to 68 games. Players have lost about 
$200 million in salaries. That's Sports. I'm Steve Shei
