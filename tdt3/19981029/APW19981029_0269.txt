Australian soccer coach Raul Blanco will take an experimental team 
to play the United States in San Jose on Nov. 6 following the Socceroos' 
failure to make the Confederations Cup. Blanco's team is focussed 
on the players likely to take part in the 2000 Olympic Games tournament 
rather than being a full-strength outfit. Australia was a surprise 
loser to New Zealand in Confederations Cup qualifying and the U.S. 
game had been arranged before that defeat as an expected warm-up for 
the Cup competition in Mexico. Although 13 of the 18 players in the 
squad are from the under-23 Olympic squad, Blanco has included some 
top-line talent. Croatia Zagreb striker Mark Viduka, who has been 
linked to Glasgow Celtic, will lead the attack and will be partnered 
by the Australian domestic league's top scorer Damian Mori. Veteran 
defender Alex Tobin will skipper the side after having the job during 
the failed World Cup campaign late last year. ``We're giving a lot 
of young players a chance to prove themselves; it's a brave move but 
sometimes you have to be prepared to take a chance,'' Blanco said 
Thursday. ``You can't always play it safe but I believe there is a 
lot of quality in this young brigade.'' The U.S. will have Bruce Arena 
at the helm for the first time, and he too has a fresh squad, with 
nine newcomers. The match at Spartan Stadium is the first for the 
U.S. team since its first-round exit at the World Cup. Australian 
squad: Alex Tobin, Tansel Baser, Raphael Bove, Marco Bresciano, Simon 
Colosimo, Jason Culina, Michael Curcija, Brett Emerton, Hayden Foxe, 
Danny Milosevic, Damian Mori, Lucas Neill, Jason Petkovic, Sebastian 
Sinozic, Josip Skoko, Mark Viduka, Kasey Wehrman, Ivan Zelic.
