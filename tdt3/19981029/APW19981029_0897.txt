An Arab foreign minister paid a rare visit Thursday to Yad Vashem, 
Israel's Holocaust memorial, and expressed hopes that ``humanity can 
learn a lesson'' from its horrors. Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammad Khouna 
of the African Arab country of Mauritania was in Israel to discuss 
upgrading relations and to express support for the peace process. 
Khouna nodded attentively and asked frequent questions as he and his 
entourage were led past the museum's displays. He examined pictures 
of mass graves, walked on bricks from the Warsaw ghetto and read grisly 
testimonies of German officers. His head covered by a skullcap to 
show respect, Khouna later laid a large wreath of red and white roses 
in the Hall of Remembrance, a large dark chamber with an eternal flame 
in its center. With Arab-Jewish relations dominated by conflict, neither 
group has traditionally had much interest the other side's past sufferings. 
Some in the Arab world simply don't acknowledge that the Holocaust 
occurred. Others recognize it, but claim it is exploited by Jews to 
justify Israel's existence. ``It's always positive when an Arab leader 
is willing to learn, understand, acknowledge and I think empathize 
with Jewish history regarding the Holocaust,'' said John Lemberger, 
director of the group AMCHA, which assists Holocaust survivors. Khouna 
did not comment to reporters on his visit, but wrote in the guestbook: 
``We have made a visit today that reminded us of a black page in history. 
``How odd is the ideology which led to this human catastrophe. We 
hope humanity can learn a lesson from this shameful past so it can 
live in brotherhood, cooperation and justice.'' Mordechai Paldiel, 
director of the memorial's Righteous Among the Nations division, which 
honors non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews, led Khouna's 
tour. ``I think it was an eye-opener for him,'' Paldiel said. ``He 
expressed his shock and amazement at the scope and intensity of the 
Holocaust.'' Speaking in French, Paldiel pointed out that rescuers 
of Jews who were honored by Yad Vashem included Muslim Albanians and 
Bosnians. He said Khouna was pleased that Muslim rescuers were recognized. 
Mauritania established low-level interest offices with Israel in November 
1995, angering other Arab League nations.
