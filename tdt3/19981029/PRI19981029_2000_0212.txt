After causing widespread damage in parts of Central America, hurricane 
Mitch is now almost stationary off the cost of Honduras. Mitch has 
already killed about 30 people, but it's losing power and is now blowing 
at about half its previous force. Tens of thousands of people have 
fled from low-laying areas of Belize and Southern Mexico in anticipation 
of the storm's arrival. At four minutes past the hour, this is Alan 
Dow in the BBC Newsroom in London. You're listening to "The World."
