Bipartisanship will prevail in the United States Senate. Already it 
is showing great signs of strain. Just this morning democrats caucus 
huddled among themselves to talk about the day ahead and didn't like 
one bit reports that senator Trent Lott the majority leader authorized 
Henry Hyde on the subject of witnesses after the caucus Pat Leahy 
had this to say. I was really disappointed saddened to see it. Because 
I'm on the senior members of the senators work very, very hard to 
have a bipartisan approach. We saw how the country reacted against 
the House of Representatives. They saw that as a partisan effort, 
and lost great deal of credibility. We are trying to do it in a bipartisan 
fashion. Now nothing is more important on this whole matter than the 
issue of whether to call witnesses or not. And for the republicans 
who allow to suddenly break from that bipartisan effort and become 
a partisan thing, is very, very disappointing. a spokesman for senator 
Trent Lott says neither he nor the republicans are trying to railroad 
anything on the subject of witnesses.
