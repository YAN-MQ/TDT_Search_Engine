Presidents don't go into space, but they all realize they can get 
a ride out of a successful launch, especially one with such a high 
hero quotient. President Clinton is no exception. And so was NBC's 
David Bloom. Tom, President Clinton said he could feel the roof Rumble 
beneath his feet as he watched today's liftoff. And he expressed the 
hope that this public relations bonanza for NASA will help build support 
for an international space station that could cost american taxpayers 
more than $100 billion. Watching the liftoff from a rooftop 3 1/2 
miles from the launch site, President Clinton called it "A great day 
for America, a great day for our senior citizens." Later, he gave 
NASA employees a thumbs-up, and argued that John Glenn's return to 
space offers the next generation of Americans the chance to dream 
big and, yes, expensive dreams about future space exploration. This 
mission is going to give America a chance to see what you do through 
new eyes. Priority one -- a new, multibillion-dollar international 
space station. Construction set to begin with the next space shuttle 
flight later this year. Ironically, John Glenn is back in space tonight 
for much the same reason he was grounded 36 years ago. Back then, 
President Kennedy thought Glenn was too big a hero to risk on a Manned 
mission to the Moon. Now, President Clinton and NASA are embracing 
Glenn's hero status. And who could blame the president if some of 
John Glenn's glory is reflected onto him, especially with the congressional 
elections just five days away? tom? David Bloom tonight. Thank you 
very much.
