Speaking of money, despite signing catcher Mike Piazza to a record 
setting contract earlier this week, major league baseball's New York 
Mets still had enough money left in the vault to resign pitcher Al 
Lighter to a big deal. The Mets announced Wednesday they have signed 
the 33 year old left hander to a four year, $32 million contract. 
Earlier this week, the Mets signed All Star catcher Mike Piazza to 
a record breaking seven year contract worth $91 million.
