Turkey and four Caspian states signed a declaration Thursday in support 
of an oil pipeline crossing through Turkey as the main export route 
to carry oil from Caspian's rich oil fields. The declaration was a 
triumph for Turkey, which got most of the countries involved in the 
project _ apart from Russia and Turkmenistan _ to declare their support 
for a pipeline running from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the 
Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan via Georgia. U.S. Energy Secretary 
Bill Richardon witnessed the signing ceremony in a show of Washington's 
commitment to the project. The declaration was signed by the presidents 
of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakistan and Uzbekistan. Turkmen 
President Saparmurad Turkmenbasi refused to sign the declaration but 
gave no reason. ``Now the issue is not whether Baku-Ceyhan is going 
to happen, because it is going to happen. The issue is how,'' Richardson 
told The Associated Press following the signing ceremony. The United 
States has repeatedly pledged its backing for the proposed 1,730-kilometer 
(1,075-mile) pipeline. Last week, Washington announced a Trade Development 
Agency aid of dlrs 823,000 for the pipeline. Azerbaijani President 
Geidar Aliev said the declaration sealed the future of the Caspian 
oil to flow through Baku-Ceyhan despite there being ``opposing parties 
to the project and circles that want to block its realization.'' He 
added the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan was the original route planned when 
Azerbaijan signed a 1994 agreement with 11 international oil companies. 
``As an independent country, we are free to chose the route for our 
oil,'' he said. Caspian oil reserves provide one of the world's richest 
oil resources. There has been a great battle to get the oil flow through 
Turkey against plans by international companies to use more routes 
that would carry the oil through the narrow Turkish Straits. In the 
declaration, the presidents strongly confirmed their determination 
``in realizing the Caspian-Mediterranean (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) project 
as the main export pipeline.'' They also instructed ``their related 
authorities regarding the creation of all necessary conditions for 
the realization of the east-west energy corridor and within this the 
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.'' Turkey has been lobbying energy companies 
to choose the Caspian route. The companies are expected to announce 
their decision Nov. 12. The main alternative is an existing pipeline 
from Baku to the Georgian Black Sea of Supsa. Oil companies reportedly 
have been favoring that route, showing reluctance to invest in the 
estimated dlrs 2.5 billion cost of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline. Turkey's 
main argument against other routes is the heavy oil tanker traffic 
through the Bosporus strait, which has led to hundreds of accidents. 
``This is the most environmentally sound, economically rational project 
for the export of Caspian oil,'' said Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.
