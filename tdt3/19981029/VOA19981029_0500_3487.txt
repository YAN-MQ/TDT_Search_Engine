All right. Today is Thursday, October 29th, 1998, and on this date 
in 1966, the writer Betty Friedan and about 30 other prominent women's 
movement leaders founded the National Organization for Women, known 
by the acronym NOW. The organization was intended to fight sexual 
discrimination in all forms and to bring women into the mainstream 
of society. In 1971, NOW began to encourage women to seek public office. 
The effort has had substantial success in elections for the U.S. Congress 
and state and local offices, however the organization has failed to 
achieve what had been the most important goal on its agenda, the ratification 
of the Equal Rights Amendment. The proposed Constitutional change 
was aimed at guaranteeing women the same legal and economic rights 
as men. Other primary concerns of NOW include efforts to stop violence 
against women and to ensure fairer employment and work conditions.
