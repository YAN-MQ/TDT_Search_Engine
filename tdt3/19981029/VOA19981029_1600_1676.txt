Well, let's take a look at some of the people in the news. The most 
unusual race in Tuesday's U.S. elections is surely the Senate race 
in Vermont where the Republican candidate has endorsed his opponent, 
Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy. The Republican candidate is 79 year 
old retired farmer, Fred Tuttle. We've reported on him before. His 
neighbor, John O'Brien, directed a low budget film about an elderly 
dairy farmer who ran for Congress and he cast Mr. Tuttle in the starring 
role. On a whim, Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Tuttle then decided to try politics 
for real and Mr. Tuttle, in a surprising upset, won the Republican 
party senate nomination in September. Filmmaker O'Brien is now the 
campaign manager for farmer Tuttle and runs the campaign on a budget 
of $251, a stark contrast to the millions of dollars normally involved 
in U.S. election politics. But experts give Mr. Tuttle no chance of 
winning a senate seat and he says he has no intention of doing so. 
He says veteran incumbent Patrick Leahy is the best man for the job. 
I'm still marveling at a $251 campaign budget.
