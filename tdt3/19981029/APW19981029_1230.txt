A hijacker reportedly armed with a hand grenade commandeered a Turkish 
Airlines flight Thursday with 33 passengers and six crew members on 
board. The hijacker ordered the plane diverted to Lausanne, Switzerland, 
Turkey's Anatolia news agency said. Instead, the pilot landed the 
Boeing 737 at the Turkish capital of Ankara, apparently misleading 
the hijacker into thinking he was landing at the Bulgarian capital 
of Sofia for refueling, the news agency said. A passenger who telephoned 
security officials on his cell phone said the hijacker was a Kurdish 
militant, according to Turkey's private Star television. The passenger 
reportedly said the hijacker was also carrying a gun. Authorities 
immediately sealed off the airport and otherwise tightened security. 
The flight had taken off from the southern city of Adana bound for 
Ankara. The passengers were predominantly Turkish. There were no foreign-sounding 
names on the passenger list released by the airline. Last week, the 
same plane was prevented from taking off from the Strasbourg airport 
by protesters trying to prevent French officials from deporting a 
Kurd to Turkey. Autonomy-seeking Kurds in Turkey's southeast have 
been fighting Turkey's military since 1984. The conflict has killed 
37,000. Turkish Airlines has been hit by two other hijackings this 
year, each time with no real weapons and with no injuries. The latest 
was in September, when a man with a toy gun commandeered a domestic 
flight to protest government restrictions on Islam. In February, a 
man claiming to have a teddy bear packed with explosives took over 
a flight. Authorities said later he was mentally ill.
