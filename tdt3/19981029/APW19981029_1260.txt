After proposing a package of spending cuts and higher taxes, the government 
on Thursday turned to selling the painful measures aimed at healing 
the economy. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic team headed 
to Congress to try to get needed backing for the plan, which would 
save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and pare the huge budget deficit. 
But resistance to the measures was expected, even among Cardoso's 
allies. Rep. Inocencio de Oliveira, normally a strong government supporter, 
complained about a proposed increase in a tax on all financial transactions 
_ from writing checks to buying stocks _ to 0.38 percent from the 
current 0.2 percent. ``I think it's too high,'' he said. ``If it were, 
say, 0.3 percent, that would be more palatable.'' Another battle is 
shaping up over a proposal to raise the social security tax on civil 
servants and collect it, for the first time, from retired government 
workers. The measures were proposed to help Brazil win a dlrs 30 billion 
rescue package from the International Monetary Fund. Brazil has been 
whipsawed by the global financial crisis that began more than a year 
ago in Southeast Asia. Although the government has a majority in the 
513-seat Chamber of Deputies and the 81-seat Senate, it faces an uphill 
fight. Cardoso also must gain support from the states' governors who 
wield enormous influence over their lawmakers. The economic plan has 
angered some governors by calling for sharp cutbacks in the amount 
of federal money given to the states. The money would go to cover 
shortfalls in the federal budget. Six opposition governors met in 
Brasilia, the capital, to discuss the plan. Anthony Garotinho, the 
populist governor-elect of the state of Rio de Janeiro, said he would 
oppose any move to reduce the state payroll to save money. ``Rio doesn't 
have too many civil servants _ it has too few,'' he said.
