Hardly retreating from their attack on President Clinton's moral behavior, 
the Republicans have prepared a fourth anti-Clinton campaign commercial, 
the toughest yet, that presents his turnabout apology to the nation 
last summer as ``legal mumbo jumbo.'' ``Remember when he looked us 
in the eye?'' asks the commercial, tailored to get out the anti-Clinton 
vote in selected Southern Republican districts. At the same time, 
the Democrats, insisting they can capitalize on any Republican broadcast 
blitz, unveiled rebuttal commercials including a radio ad that begins 
with the Republicans' tag line about the president's sex-and-mendacity 
scandal: ``What did you tell your kids?'' The Democratic ad has one 
actress playing a mother asking that question and another instantly 
responding with a shift of the subject to education: ``What do you 
say when they ask why they go to school in temporary trailers?'' Similar 
questions about Social Security and health care follow with the conclusion 
that Republicans are more ``obsessed with getting rid of the president'' 
than serving their constituents. The clash of commercials over the 
president's threatened impeachment is something of a shadow boxing 
contest since the two parties, while garnering drumbeat media attention 
with them here in the campaign homestretch, are not offering precise 
details on how heavy an investment these messages will actually receive 
beyond the Beltway. ``Upwards of a million dollars,'' estimated Democratic 
National Committee chairman Steve Grossman, saying he was still trying 
to raise that amount Thursday to put the new ads on the air before 
the Tuesday election. The Republicans have declined to say how big 
a part the scandal ads are playing in their ongoing $10-million drive 
to retain control of the House and Senate. The Democrats unveiled 
two TV commercials at a press conference that rang with denunciations 
of their favorite target in past attack ads, Republican House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich. The commercials invoke such bread-and-butter issues 
as Social Security with the narration concluding: ``Republicans _ 
so intent on attacking the president they've forgotten about us.'' 
The Republicans, who have the larger war chest, insist that the Democrats 
barely have money for a token TV response and that, in any case, the 
most fruitful television air time before Election Day is already booked. 
House Democratic Minority Leader Dick Gephardt was on the phone Thursday 
soliciting funds to mount the rebuttal. ``It tells you what they're 
really up to when they have to close this election with the agenda 
of Ken Starr,'' said Gephardt at the Democrats' satellite news conference, 
aiming in particular at Starr, the independent counsel who has recommended 
impeachment of the president. Gephardt and Grossman accused the Republicans 
of a desperate gambit in the scandal ads, one of which questions whether 
voters should ``reward'' the president on Election Day. Another replays 
Clinton's finger-wagging denial of sexual misconduct in the Oval Office, 
seven months before he reversed himself. The latest Republican ad 
features the president's admission in August that he misled the nation 
but still should be judged ``legally correct'' in his denial under 
civil court oath of a sexual affair. The Republican ad also underlines 
praise from Grossman for Clinton's ``moral leadership.'' ``It's not 
us saying this, it's them,'' emphasized Mary Crawford, communications 
director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. The ad 
is pegged to the argument that a Republican majority continues to 
be needed in Congress as a check on the president. ``Without the balance 
Republicans provide just where would Bill Clinton and Democrats take 
us?'' the ad asks. The new Democratic ads respond: ``Will 1999 be 
a year of investigation or a year of progress?'' At the unveiling, 
Grossman accused the Republicans of presiding over a ``legislative 
killing field'' for the past year, then putting ``their real cards 
on the table'' with the scandal ads. ``The agenda of the American 
people has been held hostage by the Republicans' investigative strategy,'' 
he said. Another set of last-minute campaign ads was released by People 
for the American Way, a pro-Democratic independent group. ``Yes, the 
president let us down,'' one ad concedes, stressing, ``Now it's time 
to move on.'' The new ads are notable for repeatedly presenting Starr, 
the independent counsel, as the problem. ``Are they gonna listen to 
us or Ken Starr?'' asks an actress portraying a mother. Another ad, 
entitled ``Had Enough,'' urges voters: ``Don't stay home. Send Ken 
Starr home.''
