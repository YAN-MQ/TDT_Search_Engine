I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Low pressure will track through the midwest today, bringing with it 
the threat for rain and some thunderstorms along the cold front, could 
produce some severe weather. We have low pressure tracking through 
the midwest. That's producing rain and higher elevation snows. And 
hurricane Mitch, we continue to track that. By Friday evening, could 
be making landfall along the Mexican Yucatan coast, or perhaps into 
Belize. A look at temperatures today, 80s along the gulf coast. We're 
expecting 40s to continue to creep in through the northern Rockies. 
And as we head through the weekend, that colder weather will be sweeping 
in through the upper midwest. 40s for highs through much of the northern 
plains states on Saturday. Showers and thunderstorms in the southwest. 
And some higher-elevation snows are expected as rain returns into 
the pacific northwest, both Saturday and on into Sunday. Showers and 
storms through the plains states on Sunday. And the colder weather 
shifting to the east. It does remain in the southeast, though. Right 
on into Monday, but the cooler temperatures will be filtering in then 
as 30s affect parts of the northern midwest during the day on Monday.
