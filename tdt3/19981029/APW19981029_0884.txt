Richard Krajicek stopped Andre Agassi's astonishing comeback when 
he upset the American 6-3, 6-4 in the third round of the dlrs 2.45 
Eurocard Open on Thursday. In a showdown between two former Wimbledon 
champions, Krajicek used his serve-and-volley game to overpower Agassi 
and reach the quarterfinals. Tenth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov also 
advanced by beating Todd Martin 6-4, 7-5, and Jan-Michael Gambill 
upset ninth-seeded Tim Henman 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 7-6 (7-5). Goran Ivanisevic, 
seeded 14th, ended the run of Boris Becker, the crowd's sentimental 
favorite, with a 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5) victory. Becker is in semi-retirement 
and this could have been his last tournament at home. Ivanisevic fired 
17 aces, Becker 16. ``I was a bit unlucky today,'' Becker said. Krajicek, 
who is ranked No. 11 in the world, is trying to clinch one of the 
last two places available for the eight-man World Championship next 
month in Hanover, Germany. Agassi already has qualified for Hanover 
and surged to No. 1 in the world after winning last week's tournament 
in Ostrava, Czech Republic. A former No. 1, Agassi was ranked No. 
141 at this time last year and playing challenger events. Now, he 
is in the Top 5 for the first time since July 15, 1996. Winner of 
five titles this year, Agassi could not tame Krajicek's monster serve. 
Agassi won only nine points on Krajicek's serve. ``When he serves 
that well, it's very difficult,'' Agassi said. ``He is a tough guy 
to develop any rhythm against. He likes the court here. All he had 
to do was break my serve twice.'' Krajicek won the title here in 1995 
and reached the final last year. ``I am very satisfied with the way 
I played today,'' he said. ``I served very well from the start and 
I put a lot of pressure on him. Eventually, he was going to miss a 
few passing shots,'' said Krajicek, who will have surgery on his left 
knee after the indoor season. ``It's a long road to Hanover, it doesn't 
seem that far away in time but an eternity in points,'' said Krajicek, 
who hit nine aces. The Dutchman trails three players _ Karol Kucera, 
Petr Korda and Henman in points for Hanover. All three have lost here 
and Krajicek could gain some ground if he does well in this tournament. 
Gambill, a 21-year-old American, survived 25 aces by Henman to beat 
the Briton for the second time this year. As No. 9 in the world, Henman 
is the highest-ranked player Gambill has ever beaten and his first 
Top 10 victim. ``Nobody has aced me that much,'' Gambill said. ``He 
actually played a better match. He served a lot better than I did. 
I just scraped and did my best from the baseline.'' At the time of 
the Australian Open, Gambill was No. 227 in the world. Now, he is 
No. 50. ``My goal for the year was to get into the Top 100,'' he said.
