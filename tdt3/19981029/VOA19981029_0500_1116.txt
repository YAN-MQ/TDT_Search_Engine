New U.S. soccer team coach, Bruce Arena has wasted no time in making 
good on his promise to immediately rebuild the national team. Arena 
has picked nine first time players for his roster for the American's 
friendly match, November 6th, against Australia in San Jose, California. 
Coach Arena says he knows he'll have to make some hard choices in 
the coming years. I do realize that there will be a bit of a struggle 
ahead because I believe the objective of the program is certainly 
to advance in 2002 and be in Japan for the World Cup and be among 
the final 32. That is certainly our goal to start. All 22 players 
selected are from U.S. major league soccer teams. Only three are over 
the age of 30 and only five were members of the U.S. World Cup team 
in France.
