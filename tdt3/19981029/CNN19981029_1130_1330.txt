In the longest bargaining session since the lockout, representatives 
for the NBA owners and players met well past midnight, but could not 
save another two weeks of games from being cut from the schedule, 
wiping out the entire month of November. Both sides admit they are 
not close to a deal. We made no progress. When it all came down to 
it, they were in their position and we stayed in ours. And was it 
talking numbers, or just theories? Just theories. But we just could 
never get beyond the theories. There's a gap that has to be bridged, 
and I can't say that we are necessarily going to be able to agree 
with them. But we've identified them and we've agreed to sort of stay 
in touch. There's no sessions scheduled at the moment.
