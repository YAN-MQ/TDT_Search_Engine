Two more weeks down the drain. I'm Anthony Keith James and this is 
"CNN Headline Sports." The padres are expected to announce today they've 
agreed to a two-year deal with first baseman Wally Joyner for just 
over $6 million. The 36-year-old hit .298 this season with 12 homers 
and 80 rbi. Joyner was 0-8 in the world series against the Yankees. 
Randy Johnson added his name to a long list of players that have filed 
for free agency. The lefty helped guide the astros to a division title 
this past season.
