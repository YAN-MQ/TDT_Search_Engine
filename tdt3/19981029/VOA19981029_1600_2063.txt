A Rwandan court has sentenced a Roman Catholic monk to death for genocide 
and crimes against humanity. Dominique Savio Roasero was found guilty 
Thursday of directly participating in Rwanda's 1994 genocide in which 
more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by 
Hutu extremists. Earlier this year, two Catholic priests were sentenced 
to death for genocide in the Western Rwandan town of Kibuli.
