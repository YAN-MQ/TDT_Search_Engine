A panel of judges in Spain is debating whether the nation's courts 
have the right to put former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on 
trial for genocide. The ruling could have implications on attempts 
by a Spanish judge to bring General Pinochet to Madrid to face charges. 
The judge has vowed to continue the case, even though a British court 
has ruled the London arrest of the ex-dictator on his behalf was illegal.
