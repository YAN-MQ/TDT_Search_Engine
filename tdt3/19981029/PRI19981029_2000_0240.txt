A Turkish airliner has been hijacked during a domestic flight to the 
capital Ankara. The hijacker describes himself as a left-wing militant. 
The plane has landed at Ankara airport and is presently surrounded 
by members of the security forces. More than 30 passengers and crew 
are on board. From Ankara, here's Chris Morris. After the plane landed 
at Ankara Airport, a local television channel spoke to a passenger 
on board, via his mobile telephone. The passenger said the hijacker 
who took over the plane shortly after it left the southern city of 
Uddina, identified himself as a left-wing militant. The hijacker reportedly 
said he was protesting about the war against Kurdish rebels in Southeastern 
Turkey. He thought to be armed with a hand grenade and possibly a 
gun, as well. Chris Morris, BBC News, Ankara.
