The final report of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
included several charges against President Nelson Mandela's former 
wife, Winnie Madikizela Mandela. The Commission charges Mrs. Madikizela 
Mandela was responsible for at least one attempted murder. VOA's Delia 
Robertson reports from Pretoria. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
says that Winnie Madikizela Mandela was involved in and responsible 
for the attempted murder of Liatore Incaning, a young man she accused 
of being an informant. The case was one of dozens involving Mrs. Madikizela 
Mandela investigated by the Commission during a special probe into 
her activities and those of the Mandela United Football Club. The 
Commission concluded that the club members were really a group of 
activists who developed into a private vigilante unit operating around 
Mrs. Madikizela Mandela. was involved in a number of criminal activities 
in the Soweto community including killing, torture, assault and arson. 
The Commission said Mrs. Madikizela Mandela was aware of these activities 
and deliberately chose to ignore them or that she authorized or sanctioned 
them. The Commission determined that those who opposed Mrs. Madikizela 
Mandela or the unit or dissented from them were branded informers 
and then hunted down and killed. The Commission said that branding 
them as informers was an intent to justify these killings. The Commission 
also found that Mrs. Madikizela Mandela was at home in Soweto when 
the young activist, Dompe se Pe was assaulted in her home and then 
subsequently murdered. Mrs. Madikizela Mandela was in 1993 found guilty 
of kidnapping the youth but was cleared of the assault and his murder 
because the court at the time accepted her explanation that she was 
not home. Mrs. Madikizela Mandela has not applied for amnesty for 
any of these cases and could in future face prosecution for them.
