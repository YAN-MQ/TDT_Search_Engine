The fight against AIDS just got a big financial boost. President Clinton 
unveiled a major initiative to help lower the infection rate among 
minorities. Susan Reed reports. 'cause I know it's going to be a challenge 
for you. AIDS is the now a leading cause of death among African-Americans 
aged 25 to 44. Minorities in women have the fastest-growing rate of 
new HIV infection. Education and treatment programs clearly aren't 
doing enough. They have to be willing to fund the people that can 
get the job done. That's "A" number one. It has to be the people that 
look like the people, talk like the people. Good afternoon in the 
minority aid's project. Bishop Bean's church has been running HIV 
treatment centers for 15 years, and he says minorities need more funding. 
The Clinton administration is getting the word, targeting $156 million 
to minority communities. The AIDS crisis in our communities of color 
is a national one, and that is why we are greatly increasing our national 
response. The money will go to prevention efforts, expanded treatment 
for drug abuse and to pay for AIDS drug therapy. African-Americans 
say they need education. A lot of them do wait too late, the last 
minute. And then, it's over. Okay let me give you information on HIV, 
okay? Hispanics are four times more likely to get infected with HIV 
than whites. AIDS is going where poor people live, where folks do 
not have access to medical care. With a commitment of $156 million, 
the Clinton administration is hoping to get that medical care to minorities, 
and to put the brakes on what is being called "A public health emergency."
