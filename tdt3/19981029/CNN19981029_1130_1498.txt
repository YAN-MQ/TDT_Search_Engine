Actress thandie Newton has been looking for a break-out role. She 
may have found it in a movie that's literally got her name on it. 
Michael Okwu reports. You won't leave us, will you? no. Never. This 
is where I am! Where thandie Newton is, may be on the brink of stardom 
with one of the movie season's most unusual roles. I wasn't really 
thinking in terms of how am I gonna play beloved. I was just thinking, 
"oh, my God, to be involved in this would just change my life." My 
God girl! What kind of evil you got in there? As the title character 
in "beloved," Newton is ghostly and beguiling as the long lost daughter 
of a runaway slave, played by Oprah winfrey, she is a sickly, slack-jawed 
manifestation of a tortured past. It was an emotional and risky portrayal. 
She's the one I need! You can go! She's the one I have to have! I 
did take a risk. Quite honestly, I can't imagine doing it any other 
way. I really can't because "beloved" needs to be so many different 
things. She needs to be innocent. She needs to be threatening. She 
needs to be grotesque. Oprah's presence gave her stamina on the set. 
If she wasn't around, I can honestly say there would have been some 
days where I just would have caved in. I wanted to be there every 
morning and get my Oprah injection. Newton has appeared in little-known 
art films like "loaded" and "The journey of August king." American 
audiences may know her from higher profile films like "Jefferson in 
Paris," but it's her role in "beloved" that the daughter of an English 
father and zimbabwean mother calls a Gorgeous coincidence. In bantu, 
her first name actually means beloved. At some juncture you obviously 
made the decision, "I want to be an actress." In what way was that 
satisfied if, in fact, it was with this project? With "beloved," it's 
as though everything I've done up until this point -- movies, life 
-- was for this moment. Everything that I've learned, it was a turning 
point for me, in many more ways than a career turning point. how so? 
I feel I can strive further for things. I have a different kind of 
fearlessness than I'm used to. For now she likes it on the brink.
