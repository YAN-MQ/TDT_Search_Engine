you can use the site to get stock quotes and all the day's business 
news. Back on Wall Street -- the Dow is gaining 53. The NASDAQ is 
adding 10. That's "Dollars & Sense." Back to you, Denise. Thank you, 
Valerie. "CNN Headline Sports" is straight ahead. Nobody loves CARS 
MORE than I do. Each one is a work of art. So when a maker of all 
these chose a new antifreeze, it got my attention. General Motors 
now uses the dex-cool technology of havoline extended life antifreeze 
in virtually all its new vehicles. The same patented formula you can 
use in your car. For 5 years or 150,000 miles. So do what GM did, 
switch to havoline. I use it in my car. I only wish this were it.
