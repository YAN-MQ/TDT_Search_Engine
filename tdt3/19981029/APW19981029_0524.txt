Turkey and four Caspian states signed a declaration Thursday backing 
the construction of an oil pipeline across Turkey as the main export 
route to carry oil from Caspian Sea's rich oil fields. The declaration 
was a triumph for Turkey, which got most of the countries involved 
in the project _ apart from Russia and Turkmenistan _ to declare their 
support for a pipeline running from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku 
to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. The route also crosses 
Georgia. ``This is the most environmentally sound, economically rational 
project for the export of Caspian oil,'' Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel said. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson witnessed the 
signing ceremony in a show of Washington's commitment to the project. 
The declaration was signed by the presidents of Turkey, Azerbaijan, 
Georgia, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan. Turkmen President Saparmurad Turkmenbasi 
refused to sign the declaration but gave no reason. ``Now the issue 
is not whether Baku-Ceyhan is going to happen, because it is going 
to happen. The issue is how,'' Richardson told The Associated Press 
following the signing ceremony. The United States favors the 1,730-kilometer 
(1,075-mile) Baku-Ceyhan pipeline because it would help bind Azerbaijan, 
Georgia and Turkey closer to the West, and it would not pass through 
either Russia or Iran, which have proposed routes of their own. Last 
week, Washington announced a Trade Development Agency aid of dlrs 
823,000 for the pipeline. Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev said 
the declaration sealed the future of the Caspian oil to flow through 
Baku-Ceyhan despite ``circles that want to block its realization.'' 
Caspian oil reserves provide one of the world's richest oil resources. 
There has been a great battle to get the oil flow through Turkey against 
plans by international companies to use shorter routes that would 
carry the oil through the narrow Turkish Straits. In the declaration, 
the presidents strongly confirmed their determination to make the 
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan project the main export pipeline. Turkey has been 
lobbying energy companies to choose the Caspian route. The companies 
are expected to announce their decision Nov. 12. The main alternative 
is an existing pipeline from Baku to the Georgian Black Sea port of 
Supsa. Oil companies reportedly have been favoring that route, showing 
reluctance to invest in the dlrs 2.5 billion cost of the Baku-Ceyhan 
pipeline. Turkey's main argument against other routes is the heavy 
oil tanker traffic through the Bosporus strait, which has led to hundreds 
of accidents.
