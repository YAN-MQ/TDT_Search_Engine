Brazil says it will reduce spending and raise taxes to cut its $60 
billion deficit in an effort to bolster its currency and win back 
international lenders and investors. But Arturo Porzikanski, Chief 
Economist for the Americas at ING Berrings says there were some disappointing 
details. There's a lot of revenue raising measures and very little 
on the cost cutting side. And yet, Brazil does not have a revenue 
side problem. Revenues have increased steadily year after year and 
it's been the government that has been spending all the money and 
running deficits besides. ING Berrings' Arturo Porzikanski says he 
would have liked to have seen more spending cuts which would not have 
to be approved by the Congress the way revenue raising measures will. 
There remains some concern that Brazil may devalue its currency sooner 
or later which would make U.S. goods more expensive, hurt U.S. profits 
and weaken the U.S. economy. Still, many stock investors were pleased 
with the Brazilian move, although they fear Brazil's economy will 
still fall into recession next year.
