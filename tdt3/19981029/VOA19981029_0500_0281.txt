The United States says it will send a delegation to North Korea next 
month to negotiate access to an underground site Washington suspects 
is being used to develop nuclear weapons. The team will be led by 
Charles Carpman, special U.S. envoy to Korean peace talks. North Korea 
agreed in 1994 to suspend its nuclear program in exchange for modern 
atomic power reactors.
