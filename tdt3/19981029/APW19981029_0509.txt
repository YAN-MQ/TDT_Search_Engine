A regional train derailed after hitting a herd of cows that had wandered 
onto the track, injuring the train's driver and one passenger, and 
killing eight cows, a German railway spokesman said Thursday. The 
cows made their way on to the tracks during a storm that apparently 
knocked down an electrical fence, the spokesman said. The rail line 
from Memmingin to Munich remained closed Thursday.
