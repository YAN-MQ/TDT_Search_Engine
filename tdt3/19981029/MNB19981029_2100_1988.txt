Recognizing that this trial is a first for all who are participating, 
senate republicans have circulated a set of "decorum guidelines," 
nine points in all, to those who have pledged to do "impartial justice." 
Do's and don'ts include: do plan to be in attendance at all times 
during the proceedings. Don't talk during the proceedings. Don't be 
caught reading anything during the trial unless it relates to "the 
matter before the Senate." Turn off cell phones and pagers, please, 
before entering the Senate chamber. Don't walk between the chief justice 
presiding and the lawyers or witnesses in the well of the chamber 
presenting. And, do refer to William rehnquist as Mr. chief justice. 
Rules to live by. Think they can do it, Frank? . They'll be trying. 
On the spotlight.
