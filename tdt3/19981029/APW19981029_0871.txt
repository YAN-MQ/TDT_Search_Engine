In an unprecedented move, the Palestinian Authority on Thursday placed 
the leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas under house arrest. 
The decision came several hours after Hamas claimed responsibility 
for a suicide bombing that killed an Israeli soldier and threatened 
to undermine the new Mideast peace agreement. Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat promised Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu in response 
to the attack that he would crack down on the militants. Nearly a 
dozen Palestinian policemen sealed off the area outside Yassin's Gaza 
City home and searched and questioned passers-by. Journalists were 
barred from the area. The Palestinian security services said in a 
statement: ``Sheik Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security 
reasons.'' This marked the first time that Arafat is openly confronting 
the quadriplegic Hamas leader, his strongest political rival. In the 
past, the Palestinian leader would detain lower-level Hamas officials 
from time to time. However, he never touched Yassin, apparently because 
he wanted to avoid an open and possibly blood showdown with the militants. 
A relative of Yassin told The Associated Press by telephone that the 
Hamas leader had not been notified that he was barred from leaving 
his home. The man said Yassin's first appointment outside his home 
was Friday morning and that he had not plans to leave his home in 
the meantime. As part of the crackdown on Hamas, Arafat also ordered 
the arrests of dozens of Hamas activists. Two senior members, Mahmoud 
Zahar, and Ibrahim Hanieh, were among those detained.
