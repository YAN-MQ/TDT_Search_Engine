This is "The World." I'm Lisa Mullens. With great pomp and ceremony, 
South Africa's Truth in Reconciliation Commission handed its final 
report to President Nelson Mandela today, after hearing two years 
of testimony and staving off a last-ditch bid to block the document, 
the commission painted an ugly picture of South Africa's apartheid 
history. It included assassinations, torture and abductions carried 
out by the white minority government from 1948 to 1994 and it did 
not spare black liberation leaders, blaming President Mandela's ex-wife 
and his party for atrocities. Mandela accepted the report with what 
he called all its imperfections and said now is the time to build 
the nation. Proceeding from the premise, that freedom and dignity 
are the real prize that our sacrifices were --. Free, at last. We 
are all masters of our destiny. A better future depends on all of 
us, landing a hand, your hand, and my hand.
