Rubie's costume company is recalling 6,000 children's vampire capes 
and about 6,000 children's witches Brooms. The U.S. consumer product 
safety commission says the halloween props don't meet mandatory flammability 
standards and could ignite easily. The government is not aware of 
any injuries involving the products. For a refund, people should return 
them to the store where they were bought.
