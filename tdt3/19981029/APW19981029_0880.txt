While insisting that Russia is under no threat of food shortages, 
the agriculture minister conceded Thursday that the country is holding 
``consultations'' with the United States about humanitarian aid. Since 
the economic crisis hit in mid-August, a fall in food imports that 
came on top of an unusually low harvest has led to serious concerns 
that Russia may not have enough food for the winter. Agriculture and 
Food Minister Viktor Semyonov said the problem was not in any actual 
lack of food, but in getting it to all the regions and selling it 
at prices that poor people can afford. He refused to confirm reports 
that Russia has asked for humanitarian aid from the West, but said 
the possibility has been considered, and donated food would be helpful. 
``There is no reason to refuse humanitarian aid in food,'' Semyonov 
told a news conference, adding that it would only be needed ``in individual 
regions, for individual strata of the population.'' Russian agricultural 
officials were meeting Wednesday with a U.S. government delegation, 
led by the general sales manager for the USDA's Foreign Agriculture 
Service, Christopher Goldphwait. Semyonov indicated that the talks 
might deal with the possibility of humanitarian aid, but few details 
have been released. At the same time, Semyonov insisted that the government 
sees ``no threat of food shortages, no grounds for the threat of food 
shortages today.'' ``Russia is stocked up rather fully on basic foods 
such as potatoes, sugar, oil, vegetables and other foods,'' he told 
a news conference. The Agriculture and Food Ministry wants to support 
domestic producers and is unwilling to emphasize any food problems 
in Russia for fear of inviting food imports and aid _ thus increasing 
the competition to Russian farmers. Even so, Semyonov conceded that 
22 of Russia's 89 regions suffer ``acute shortages of grain,'' and 
the banking crisis and the poor organization of trade hinder deliveries 
from Russia's grain-producing areas. Russia's grain harvest this year 
is estimated at 47.3 metric tons _ or only about half of last year's 
yield of 88.5 metric tons, he said. Semyonov called for greater state 
control over the agricultural market, saying only that would ensure 
deliveries of inexpensive food to troubled regions. ``Unfortunately, 
since entering the market (economy), we have lost many of the levers 
we had before for regulating crisis situations,'' he said. Russia's 
new Cabinet generally appears to favor a shift toward greater state 
interference in the economy to pull it out of its worst crisis since 
the Soviet collapse. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Thursday 
that the government has ``resolutely opted'' to take more control. 
Primakov was commenting on the government's long-awaited plan for 
coping with the crisis, which was presented to the International Monetary 
Fund on Wednesday. The government hoped the plan would persuade the 
IMF to release another installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan frozen 
after the Russian economy fell apart in mid-August. Meanwhile, the 
World Bank is also considering a dlrs 500 million loan to Russia for 
structural reform of the agricultural sector, said bank official Vera 
Matusevich, according to the Interfax news agency. The loan would 
depend on the government's economic program, she said. The plan presented 
to the IMF calls for tighter currency controls, price controls on 
medicines and some basic foods, a food reserve to help the country 
through the winter and indexing wages and pensions to compensate Russians 
for rising inflation. It tackles the tax system, lowering some income, 
property and profit tax rates but tightening the rules in hopes of 
making more people pay. The government's chronic inability to collect 
taxes has left it consistently short on cash and helped contribute 
to the current crisis.
