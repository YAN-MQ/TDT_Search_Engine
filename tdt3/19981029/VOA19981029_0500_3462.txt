Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are taking a bit of 
a break -- just two minutes. Come back to us on News Now. Well if 
you want to know who's up next, Frank White has just come in -- came 
in and spilled the coffee, knocked over a microphone stand and made 
a lot of other noise. Abused us. Good morning, Frank. Let's not forget 
that.
