Mobs lynched four people, including one woman who was hanged in front 
of a police station, as vigilante attacks spread on Indonesia's main 
island, newspapers reported Thursday. The military has been unable 
to quell the violence on Java island, in which more than 160 people 
have been killed since July. Assassins, said to dress in ninja-like 
black clothing, have targeted suspected black magic sorcerers, and 
Muslim clerics have been among the victims. Mobs have attacked people 
believed to be the killers. Gen. Subagyo, the army chief, pledged 
Thursday to restore order in the region as soon as possible, the official 
Antara news agency reported. Indonesia's largest Muslim group, Nahdhatul 
Ulama, has warned it will deploy its own security forces if the military 
does not protect its members. The vast majority of killings have been 
in eastern Java, but fear and suspicion have spread westward. On Tuesday, 
mobs assaulted a woman who did not identify herself in the central 
Java town of Sarang, the newspaper Suara Karya reported. The assailants 
stripped the woman, then beat and dragged her before hanging her in 
front of the police station. Officers did not intervene because the 
mob threatened to set the station on fire, the newspaper reported. 
In a similar killing Monday night, a crowd tortured and stabbed to 
death a man in the central Java village of Tanjung Emas, 400 kilometers 
(250 miles) east of Jakarta. The mob, which suspected him of murder, 
seized him from Muslim clerics who were protecting him. In Pati, another 
central Java town, vigilantes with sticks and bricks killed two vegetable 
vendors Wednesday, the newspaper Media Indonesia reported. Suspicion 
had fallen on the men because they were wearing black clothing, which 
the murderers are said to wear.
