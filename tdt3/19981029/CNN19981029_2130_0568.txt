The Palestinian authority has placed the leader of the Islamic militant 
group Hamas under house arrest. The organization claimed responsibility 
for a suicide bombing in the Gaza strip today. The bomber drove an 
explosives-laden car into an Israeli army Jeep, killing an Israeli 
soldier who was escorting a bus load of school children. None of the 
children were hurt. Palestinian authority leader Yasser Arafat has 
spoken to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Both parties 
indicate they will not pull back from a new interim peace deal.
