The president of Uzbekistan has banned excessively lavish celebrations, 
be they weddings, family reunions or funerals. ``Such prejudices of 
the past as vanity, pomp and excessive spending permeate weddings, 
family celebrations and funerals,'' says the decree by President Islam 
Karimov. ``The deservedly reproachable behavior of some conceited 
individuals harms ordinary people, their self-esteem, faith in justice 
and state authorities,'' the decree said, according to the Interfax 
news agency on Thursday. Karimov said the money could be better spent 
on charities or for building roads and bridges. Interfax did not say 
how Karimov proposed to enforce the ban or give any other details.
