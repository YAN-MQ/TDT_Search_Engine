Blue-chip stocks on Thursday paced a brisk advance in which the Dow 
Jones industrial average climbed 123.06 points _ its best gain in 
two weeks _ to a level closer to its record peak of mid-July than 
to its low of late August. More reports of surprisingly good or at 
least satisfactory profits seemed to propel the rise, along with better 
feeling about the Japanese banking system and what seemed to some 
a growing likelihood that Election Day would bring no significant 
shift in the American political landscape. In addition, mutual funds 
were said to be active as they approached the end of October, the 
time for determining annual capital-gains pay-outs to shareholders, 
a process that typically involves shedding fallen stocks and reinvesting 
in winners. Investors shrugged off fresh government reports of a tight 
labor market and doubts about whether Brazil's proposed fiscal package 
would ultimately restore the country's financial credibility. Brazil's 
chief stock index slumped 4.22 percent Thursday. The Dow rose 1.47 
percent, to 8,495.03. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 
even more than the Dow, with which it shares key issues, posting a 
gain of 17.84 points, or 1.67 percent, to 1,085.93. The Nasdaq composite 
index and the Russell 2000 index of small companies, which have lately 
been the pace setters as many investors hunted bargains among smaller 
companies, gained 1.13 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. Since 
Oct. 8, the S&AMP;P 500 has climbed 13.2 percent, Nasdaq is up 23.8 
percent and the Russell 2000 has risen 20.7 percent. The S&AMP;P 500 
and Nasdaq have returned to double-digit gains for the year. ``The 
markets are responding to earnings,'' said Kevin Parke, chief equity 
officer at MFS Investment Management in Boston. ``You've had pretty 
good earnings reports over the past eight days after a month of disappointments.'' 
Stocks of health-maintenance organizations and drug companies were 
particular standouts in a day of widespread gains that even included 
a few cyclicals, such as Alcoa, which climbed 3, to 77{. Wellpoint 
Health jumped 9 11/16, to 71 15/16, and Humana rose 1}, to 18 1/8 
after reporting buoyant profits, while Oxford Health Plans, which 
is scheduled to report Friday, surged 2 5/16, to 11\. Merck rose 3 
15/16, to 135 15/16, making the biggest contribution to the Dow, while 
Lilly advanced 2 15/16, to 80\, American Home Products 2 13/16, to 
49 7/16, and Pfizer 2 1/16, to 107}. And the American depository receipts 
of Zeneca Group rose 1 5/8, to 38{ after the Food and Drug Administration 
announced it had approved the company's drug for reducing the incidence 
of breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease. Financial 
stocks were another bright spot. Merrill Lynch led the brokers, surging 
4 7/16, to 56 9/16 after trading as low as 35} three weeks earlier, 
while Morgan Stanley climbed 3 5/16, to 62 13/16. Among banks, J.P. 
Morgan, the second-biggest contributor to the blue-chip average, rose 
3 3/8, to 94{, while BankAmerica was up 2\, to 57 1/8. ``Financial 
Armageddon isn't happening,'' said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment 
strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co., who called the 950-point rise from 
the Dow's Aug. 31 low a ``relief'' rally and predicted that prices 
would now be driven by corporate fundamentals and drive the average 
past its record 9,337.97 by the end of the year. Oil stocks benefited 
Thursday from a decline in gasoline inventories, which a Merrill Lynch 
analyst said would likely mean further improvement in profit margins 
from refining that have emerged this month. Exxon rose 2\, to 72 11/16, 
Mobil climbed 2, to 74 7/8, and Chevron was up 1 3/8, to 79 7/8. IBM 
advanced 2 9/16, to a record 148}, while Wal-Mart Stores rose smartly 
for a second straight day, by 2 5/8 to 67 7/16 as an official projected 
a strong holiday season. Amazon.com, the online bookseller, jumped 
9 7/16, to 126{, after reporting a smaller-than-expected loss and 
much stronger sales for the third quarter. New highs outnumbered new 
lows by 36 to 33 on the New York Stock Exchange as 1,886 issues gained 
while 1,173 fell. Volume was 699.49 million, compared with 677.59 
million on Wednesday.
