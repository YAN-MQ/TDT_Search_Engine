The City News Bureau, a fixture in American journalism that trained 
Mike Royko, Kurt Vonnegut, Seymour Hersh and legions of other gritty 
reporters here, will close after more than 100 years as Chicago's 
legendary news-gathering operation. The bureau, which is one of the 
nation's oldest continuously running news services, is jointly owned 
by the city's two major daily newspapers, The Chicago Tribune and 
The Chicago Sun-Times. For the past few years the bureau had been 
losing money and subscribers and Wednesday officials close to the 
papers said that the hemorrhaging had finally become terminal. ``A 
decision has been reached to close the City News Bureau sometime in 
the first quarter of next year,'' said Larry Green, executive editor 
of The Chicago Sun-Times and a board member of the City News Bureau. 
``The two papers have been carrying the load. But it's losing money. 
It lost about $1 million last year.'' Reports of the bureau's demise 
became known Wednesday, Green said, even though neither newspaper 
released a statement. But late Wednesday night, reporters at the City 
News Bureau said they were preparing their own story. The staff of 
about 29 reporters and 15 other employees was told of the decision 
Thursday afternoon, they said, when the bureau's general manager called 
a staff meeting. ``We really didn't go into a staff meeting,'' said 
Kim Kishbaugh, an assistant city editor who has worked at the bureau 
for about 12 years. ``He just said: `City News is closing.' Everybody's 
in shock.'' For many here, the City News Bureau was an icon in a city 
known for its tough exterior and its hard-nosed journalism. Founded 
in 1890, the agency later became the subject of the Broadway play, 
``The Front Page,'' the quintessential saga of 1920s journalism in 
Chicago. And Arnold Dornfeld, a legendary editor who reporters said 
was as much a terror as a teacher, established the City News Bureau 
standards: double check everything. ``If your mother says she loves 
you,'' he liked to say, ``check it out.'' And in the days before journalism 
schools popped up, the City News Bureau funneled reporters into the 
city's major dailies, functioning as a journalism bootcamp, many said. 
From its bustling offices stories were sent through pneumatic tubes 
that circled Chicago's underground to the many daily newspapers that 
subscribed to the bureau's service. The alumni include Royko, Vonnegut 
and Hersh, all of whom later earned Pulitzer Prizes, and Charles MacArthur, 
the playwright, as well as scores if not hundreds of reporters at 
the newpapers and others around the nation. But as the number of newspapers 
in Chicago dwindled, the City News Bureau, which offers no advertising 
and depends on fees from newspapers that subscribe, had difficulty 
meeting its budget. Television and radio stations also subscribed 
to the wire service, but last year many of the broadcast outlets rejected 
higher fees, Green said. Green said that projections were that the 
operation would continue to lose money for the next three or four 
years. ``A lot of beloved institutions are not here anymore,'' he 
said. ``This town once had many newspapers. It's down to two. A lot 
of those newspapers weren't making money, so they went out of business. 
And that's what happened to the City News Bureau. This isn't a charitable 
institution.''
