"CNN Headline News," I'm David Goodnow. Thanks for joining us. Those 
stories in a moment, first the shuttle launch. It's quiet now at Kennedy 
space center in Florida, but by daybreak the area should be buzzing 
with activity. Shuttle "discovery" is scheduled to blast off at 2 
P.M. eastern time, and with it, a very special passenger. 77-year-old 
John Glenn will be among the seven astronauts on the mission. This 
trip to space comes 36 years after he became the first person to orbit 
the earth. A broadcaster who witnessed Glenn's 1962 launch says much 
has changed over the years at Kennedy space center. We sat on a jetty 
on the other side of FT. Canaveral and watched through binoculars 
the lights come up there, and knew the launch was coming. But we didn't 
get on the base very often. When we did get onto the base, it wasn't 
anything like this. We've got a few mosquitos here tonight. We have 
some mosquitos here tonight. But then we had a rattlesnake and we 
were just in a station wagon out here in the boondocks somewhere. 
We had to watch the rattle snakes as well as the mosquitos. "Discovery's" 
crew will perform more than 80 scientific experiments while in orbit, 
including tests on the effects of aging in space.
