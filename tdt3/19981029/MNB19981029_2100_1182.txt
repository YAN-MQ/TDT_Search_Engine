Jeanne. Off center stage today. Wolf Blitzer joins us live from the 
White House. Wolf, where will the president be. He's in Alexandria, 
Virginia across the Potomac river. Policing drumming up support for 
a popular program the Clinton administration has put forward. Later 
today after the event in Virginia, you are seeing live pictures of 
the president with police officers there now. Getting ready to speak. 
Later today, the president will be meeting with his advisers to go 
over his state of the union address. He'll be talking about the economy 
and flies to New York to deliver a Speech tonight together with Jesse 
Jackson on Wall Street trying to promote minority hiring on Wall Street 
tomorrow. Advisers at the White House, his staff are once again going 
on the offensive in rebutting latest developments involving those 
house prosecutors this morning, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart 
made very clear the president is not about to go forward and testify, 
again, said the president did testify for four hours before Ken Starr's 
grand jury. He also suggested that efforts by these house prosecutors 
to meet privately with senators is something that is not productive 
right now, something that could undermine the bipartisanship that 
until now has been strong in the senate. Any witnesses the press secretary 
says opens up this process to lengthy delays. He also says the house 
prosecutors have quote, consistently bent, changed shifted the rules 
and flip-flopped on a lot of the issues. Talk at the White House as 
they get ready for the trial to resume. Jeanne. Wolf Blitzer at the 
White House. Thanks. Jeanne.
