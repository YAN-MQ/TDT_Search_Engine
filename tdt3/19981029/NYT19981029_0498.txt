When Zenia Mucha had 10 minutes to spare before Gov. George Pataki 
arrived in this Orange County village for a campaign stop the other 
day, she did what any confident manager of an incumbent who is some 
30 points ahead in the polls would do: She went antiquing. And then 
she did something only a very powerful campaign manager would do: 
She continued shopping, even after she knew her boss had arrived. 
Quickly, she bought a copper lamp for $65 and two occasional tables 
for $95, then hurried over to the bar where the governor was shaking 
hands to show him her treasures. ``Ah, I love that,'' Pataki said, 
stopping his handshaking to admire Ms. Mucha's lamp. ``Cool?'' she 
asked, pleased. ``Before we head off to Kingston,'' said Pataki, who 
often antiques with Ms. Mucha, ``you've got to sneak me in.'' Later, 
on the way to Ulster County, Pataki sat in the back seat of his car 
with Ms. Mucha and recalled the first time he met her. It was 1982, 
when he was running for mayor of Peekskill, and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, 
R-N.Y., had come by for a ribbon cutting. Afterward, as Pataki remembers 
it, D'Amato ordered Pataki into his car for a ride to Dutchess County. 
Inside the car was Ms. Mucha, at that time one of D'Amato's press 
aides. ``And just as he was giving me orders,'' Pataki said, laughing 
at Ms. Mucha, ``you were giving him orders.'' Ms. Mucha responded 
by playfully slapping the governor's knee. For nearly four years, 
Ms. Mucha, 42, has been the governor's closest aide and the most powerful 
political adviser in New York, an outrageous, foul-mouthed and entertaining 
mother crocodile who is called by Albany reporters _ and some in the 
Pataki administration _ ``Governor Zenia.'' Now she is at a point 
of maximum influence as the manager of Pataki's campaign and as a 
senior consultant to D'Amato's. She is a friend and confidante of 
both men, and a crucial strategist behind the governor's presidential 
ambitions. This week, as she travels the state with both clients on 
a joint campaign trip, her goal is to get D'Amato through the toughest 
race of his political career _ she went with him to last Sunday's 
debate for what she called ``moral support'' _ and to roll up a big 
majority for Pataki to enhance his national credentials. ``I do think 
the governor is presidential material,'' she said. The paradox of 
the moment is that she is working for a governor who is running a 
feel-good campaign against Peter Vallone, the speaker of the New York 
City Council, even though she thrives on the kind of political combat 
she learned from D'Amato _ and which the senator is engaged in now 
in his race against Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn. For the record, 
Ms. Mucha says that she isn't bored with the campaign for governor, 
perhaps because she still manages to get in some fights. ``I don't 
think there's been a commercial where she hasn't said, `I hate this,''' 
said Arthur Finkelstein, the media strategist who handles Pataki's 
television advertising. Recently Ms. Mucha objected to a commercial 
because she said the governor's teeth weren't white enough, even though 
Finkelstein said no one would notice. ``She wore me down,'' he said. 
``We had to use a different angle on his teeth. But the point is, 
she cares about the details on that level.'' He added that ``we have 
a wonderful relationship _ we argue about everything.'' Ms. Mucha 
is on leave from her job as the governor's director of communications, 
a title that never reflected the influence she had on nearly every 
major decision made by the governor. As campaign manager, she now 
has almost total control over Pataki's schedule. ``She's kind of a 
committee of one,'' said Kieran Mahoney, the campaign strategist who 
works with Finkelstein. Ms. Mucha also writes most of Pataki's radio 
commercials, drafts many of his television commercials and handles 
endorsements, like the one from the Rev. Calvin Butts III, the influential 
Harlem minister. ``By the time I knew about it,'' said Mahoney, ``she 
said, `Calvin Butts is going to endorse us, and I propose we do it 
on this particular day.' And we all said, `OK.' With Zenia, a lot 
of stuff ends up on your desk in a package wrapped in a bow and all 
you have to do is say yes.'' In Albany, Republicans in the state Senate 
tell a different story. In fact, some view her with such alarm that 
she could be a Hudson River version of Kali, the Hindu goddess of 
destruction. Republicans say she orders around the majority leader 
in the state Senate, Joseph Bruno, and blame her for humiliating Bruno 
when the governor split with his old ally in a rent-control battle 
last year. ``She doesn't tolerate, really, anybody,'' said John McArdle, 
spokesman for the Senate Republicans. Certainly not Betsy McCaughey 
Ross, the lieutenant governor who was dumped by Pataki, switched parties, 
lost the Democratic primary and is now running against her former 
boss on the Liberal Party line. Ms. Mucha was in large part responsible 
for the ouster of a woman she considered a grandstander. ``She was 
a very quick learner, OK?'' Ms. Mucha said of Ms. McCaughey Ross. 
``But what happened was, her penchant for attention, the lure of the 
TV lights, became bigger than her.'' An alternative view in Albany 
is that the title of ``Governor Zenia'' is a handy foil for the real 
governor, who can blame his unpopular actions on his aide. Pataki 
himself jokes about this. ``When anything goes wrong,'' he once said, 
``blame Zenia and move on.'' But Michael Finnegan, the governor's 
former counsel and longtime friend, says that ``those who would paint 
Zenia as a heartless, brainless control freak miss the texture and 
nuance of who she is.'' Friends describe a loyal, warm woman who loves 
to cook elegant meals and who appreciates fine wines _ Ms. Mucha once 
sent two bottles back at a dinner with Pataki and reporters. ``She's 
very particular about anything,'' Mahoney said. ``She'll invite you 
over, and you show up and you're embarrassed that you're wearing sweat 
pants and sneakers because Zenia has got the place decked out and 
treats you like visiting royalty.'' Ms. Mucha has an apartment in 
New York City and shares a house in the capital with Douglas Rutnik, 
a lawyer and prominent Albany Democrat, who recently gave her a ring 
with an enormous emerald surrounded by diamonds. ``I'm not engaged,'' 
Ms. Mucha said, not quite as if she were referring to a disease. ``I 
think I'm past the engagement stage.'' Asked when the wedding (her 
first) would be, Ms. Mucha responded: ``I don't know. I like the way 
things are.'' Reporters frequently get expletive-laden diatribes from 
Ms. Mucha when they write something that displeases her, although 
there can be humor underneath what her admirers say is really an act, 
or a tool. ``She winks sometimes if you're observing her when she's 
doing it,'' said Pat Lynch, the spokeswoman for Sheldon Silver, the 
speaker of the Assembly. Not always: This past summer Ms. Mucha left 
a furious message on the voice mail of a reporter for The New York 
Observer, Andrea Bernstein, that The Observer then printed. ``I hope 
this will be the last time that I will need to tell you this because 
you will be hearing now from my attorneys,'' The Observer quoted Ms. 
Mucha as saying, then printed a string of expletives that she used 
to describe the newspaper. (Mahoney said the only thing that surprised 
him about the message was that Ms. Mucha left it on tape.) Ms. Mucha 
says she remains happiest in the background. ``Can't we just not talk 
about my life?'' she asked, in an interview in her hot, noisy office 
at Pataki campaign headquarters on Lexington Avenue. (D'Amato's campaign 
headquarters are right across the hall.) And then, later: ``This article 
to me is like going to have root canal.'' In fact Ms. Mucha's life 
is one of the more extraordinary immigrant success stories in a city 
full of them, and explains much of what she became. Born to Ukrainian 
parents in a village in northern Poland, where her father worked in 
a brick factory, Ms. Mucha spent the first nine years of her life 
in a house without plumbing, under Communist rule. ``We lived in absolute 
fear of one day someone knocking on your door and taking away your 
mother and father and never seeing them again,'' she said. She grew 
up in a system, she said, ``where government controlled your thought 
process, controlled your ability to make a living, controlled your 
education.'' Every year Ms. Mucha's family saved up enough money to 
make a trip to Warsaw for the physical exams required for immigration 
to the United States, and every year they were rejected because of 
her father's poor health. By the 10th year, when Ms. Mucha was 9, 
they passed, and came to New York to live on the Lower East Side with 
Ms. Mucha's aunt. Ms. Mucha's father got work at Greenwood Cemetery 
as a gravedigger (he was later a groundskeeper), while Ms. Mucha's 
mother cleaned floors at the United Nations. Ms. Mucha entered third-grade 
at a neighborhood parochial school, learned English, and took care 
of the family. When her parents needed help with employment and tax 
forms, Ms. Mucha was the one who went with them, even at a young age, 
to translate. ``She always thought that she would be somebody,'' said 
Ms. Mucha's younger sister, Miroslawa Lang, a financial analyst now 
at home with her two children in New Rochelle, N.Y. ``She always thought 
she would have a different life.'' Ms. Mucha studied political science 
at Brooklyn College, but left a semester short of graduation because 
she took a full-time job in the public relations department of Gimbel's. 
She has been meaning to finish her college degree ever since. ``It's 
a very personally embarrassing thing for me,'' she said. A cousin 
recruited her to work as a volunteer in Eastern European neighborhoods 
for D'Amato's 1980 campaign, and as a fervent anti-Communist she was 
quickly drawn to the Republican Party ideology of the time. She was 
also a kind of soul mate for another ethnic outsider, D'Amato, whom 
she once described as ``an Italian kid from Long Island who spoke 
funny and who didn't socialize with the right people, who didn't have 
the right background that they perceived a senator should.'' In 1982, 
Ms. Mucha went to work in D'Amato's press office in New York, then 
served him for a dozen years and through several ethics investigations, 
one of which led to a rebuke from the Senate Ethics Committee. She 
left when Pataki, who was widely seen as controlled by D'Amato, needed 
a new press secretary in his 1994 campaign for governor. When Pataki's 
campaign staff suggested Ms. Mucha, Pataki at first said no. ``I was 
reluctant because of that whole impression of D'Amato being the person 
who dictates what we do in the state,'' Pataki said. But after a few 
days of press problems, Pataki relented, and Ms. Mucha has been with 
him ever since. Ms. Mucha caught up with her old boss, D'Amato, the 
other day in Kingston, where he spoke at a shopping center with Pataki. 
Ms. Mucha and the senator greeted each other like old friends, walked 
arm in arm, then got down to business as D'Amato talked intently and 
Ms. Mucha took notes. Afterward, D'Amato kissed her goodbye on the 
check. ``You've got to miss having Zenia,'' he said.
