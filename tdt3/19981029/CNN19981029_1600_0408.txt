The report on south Africa's era of apartheid was issued today. The 
3,500-page document is the product of two years of testimony from 
thousands of witnesses before the country's truth and reconciliation 
commission. The report was formally presented to south African President 
Nelson Mandela by retired anglican archbishop Desmond Tutu, who heads 
the commission. It makes a specific proposal about how we can cultivate 
a culture of human rights and structures to ensure that atrocities 
of the past do not occur. And strong suggestion on how to advance 
the process of healing and reconciliation of what traumatized a wounded 
nation. The commission was established in 1995, a year after all-race 
elections ended apartheid.
