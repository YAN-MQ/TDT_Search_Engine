A New Jersey judge sentenced a woman to 15 years in prison today for 
killing the baby she gave birds to last year at her high school senior 
prom. Melissa Drexler, who is now 20, pleaded guilty to agrag vated 
manslaughter in August. The judge says she is not a monster, but she 
must accept the consequences of her terrible act. Under New Jersey 
law, she could serve less than three years.
