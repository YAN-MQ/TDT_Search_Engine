Gunmen in southwestern Mexico opened fire on a family in a remote 
mountain village, killing five people and wounding two children in 
what authorities on Thursday called a drug-related attack. The target 
appears to have been Taurino Leal Sierra, 38, who was released from 
a local prison in February after serving time for robbery and homicide, 
government prosecutor Felipe Quintero Campos said. The massacre is 
suspected to have been a settling of scores between drug traffickers, 
Quintero said. He did not elaborate, and there were no immediate arrests. 
The attack took place late Wednesday night in the indigenous community 
of Tlapa de Comonfort, high in the mountains of Guerrero state 130 
miles (210 kms) south of Mexico City _ and just half a mile (700 meters) 
from a state police station. The assailants used assault rifles to 
kill Leal, his wife Ines Linares and their 14-year-old twins. Also 
killed was Fidel Arellano, 57, whose relationship to the Leal family 
was not clear. Two other children, ages 4 and 6, were being treated 
for gunshot wounds. Last month, 19 members of an extended family were 
lined up outside their house in the northern Indian community of El 
Sauzal and shot to death in what prosecutors call a drug-related attack. 
Fourteen people have been arrested, but not the gunmen.
