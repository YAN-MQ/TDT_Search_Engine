Wednesday night's concert at Alice Tully Hall was given by Jordi Savall 
and his big band: the players on viols, guitar, percussion, assorted 
wind instruments and keyboards of his group Hesperion XX together 
with the six singers of his La Capella Reial de Catalunya. And they 
kicked up quite a storm. Nominally the program was devoted to Spanish 
music during the time of Philip II, who died 400 years ago, but there 
were pieces from well before this solemn monarch was born _ from the 
era when his great-grandparents, Ferdinand and Isabella, were reconquering 
Granada from the Moors _ and there were others that spilled over well 
into the 17th century. Historical boundaries were not too important. 
This was music being made now, music that took off from incomplete 
sources and was projected with great vim and polish. Different blendings 
of voices and instruments were used with cheerful exuberance. A piece 
by Bartomeu Carceres became a Christmas rap song, with the singers 
taking turns at the verses, separated by instrumental solos that suggested 
jazz was born in 16th-century Madrid. Probably flamenco started there 
too, for a couple of numbers had strong syncopations endorsed by Pedro 
Estevan on castanets. Often the players would partly improvise, as 
it seemed, a segue. In the case of Francisco Correa de Arrauxo's hymn 
honoring the Immaculate Conception, the instrumental meditation, led 
by Savall on a small viol, was considerably longer than the original 
music, and none the worse for that. Other crucial performers included 
the soprano Montserrat Figueras, whose voice sounds like a sideways 
seductive smile, and Carlos Mena, a confident countertenor. Performances 
mattered more than repertory, but a few pieces stood out, notably 
a suavely somber madrigal by Francisco Guerrero, the major composer 
who was almost exactly Philip's contemporary, and a song by Juan del 
Enzina from soon after the victory in Granada. This piece could teach 
us something in terms of its sympathy for an ethnic-religious enemy. 
It is a lament placed in the mouth of the last king of Granada and 
pays respect to the Moorish culture, which surely contributed to its 
haunting melody. It is a small musical equivalent of the tiled courtyards 
and dribbling fountains of the Real Alcazar in Seville.
