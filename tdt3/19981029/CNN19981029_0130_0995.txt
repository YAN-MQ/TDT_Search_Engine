Brazil is taking steps to put its financial house in order. The government 
says it will follow an $84 billion austerey plan designed to rescue 
its economy from a currency crisis. A combination of budget cuts, 
tax increases, and other measures could pave the way for approximately 
$30 billion in loans from the international monetary fund. Some economists 
say the government may have difficulty getting the measures approved 
by the Brazilian Congress.
