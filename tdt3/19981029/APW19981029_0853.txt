Two ethnic Albanians were found guilty Thursday of anti-state activity 
and membership in the Kosovo Liberation Army, the Yugoslav state-run 
Tanjug news agency reported. A district court in the troubled Kosovo 
province sentenced Tahir Salihi, 62, to seven years in prison for 
smuggling arms from across the border with neighboring Albania. Hekuran 
Cari, 18, was sentenced to eight years imprisonment on similar charges. 
Both were arrested in July while illegally crossing the border on 
separate occasions. They had allegedly opened fire at Yugoslav army 
border patrols they encountered.
