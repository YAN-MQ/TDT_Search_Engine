Some news brewing in the beer industry -- according to the Milwaukee 
journal "Sentinel," pabst brewing company is negotiating to buy detroit-based 
stroh's brewery. Under the deal, pabst reportedly would takeover production 
of stroh's best know brands and sell some others to Miller, the nation's 
number-two brewery. If the deal goes through, pabst is likely to close 
most of stroh's seven breweries. So far, however, stroh's says it 
has not entered into an agreement.
