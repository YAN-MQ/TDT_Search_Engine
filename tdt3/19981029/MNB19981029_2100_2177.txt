Just about 35 minutes to go before the United States Senate convenes, 
and begins its formal proceedings into the determination of President 
Clinton's guilt or innocence in their eyes as to the impeachment charges 
arrayed against him. Minority leader Tom Daschle went to the microphones 
to continue this parade of complaints saying he's dismayed at news 
that republicans have sat down to talk about witnesses already. The 
complaint here it is. I'm very disappointed and somewhat surprised 
that there has been that kind of activity this early. It certainly 
violates the spirit of the agreement that we just all agreed to last 
week. I'm equally dismayed that house managers have already chosen 
to contact witnesses and then to announce a witness reluctance to 
participate until they know the circumstances. That is in clear violation 
of the bremt that we had last week, and I hope it's not a harbinger 
of the politicized process that we oppose. All senators want to maintain 
a bipartisan approach throughout. We'll see.
