Is there a trend here? ``Talk of Angels'' is the third and weakest 
movie to be released this year in which the central character is a 
beautiful, charming, clever, wise young governess who becomes romantically 
entangled with someone in her employer's family. As for the angels 
in the title, the question of what these celestial beings might have 
to do with the movie at hand is best left unasked. It might have something 
to do with the fact that ``angel'' has become a Hollywood buzzword 
for high-minded schmaltz and phony nobility. There are signs that 
``Talk of Angels,'' based on Kate O'Brien's novel ``Mary Lavelle'' 
and directed by Nick Hamm, imagines itself as the Spanish Civil War 
equivalent of ``Dr. Zhivago'' crossed with ``The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,'' 
with a dash of ``The Leopard'' thrown in. The sets are lavish, the 
scenery and costumes sumptuous, the atmosphere romantic and fraught 
with a sense of historic import. If only the characters didn't talk 
in romance-novel cliches and the history and politics weren't boiled 
down to a simple-minded case of heroic young leftists standing up 
to a corrupt establishment; if only the whole thing weren't so badly 
butchered in the cutting room that crucial dramatic confrontations 
are strangely missing, the movie might at least have worked as a sudsy, 
aromatic bubble bath. Yards and yards of plot are spun around the 
story of Mary Lavelle (Polly Walker), a young Irish woman who leaves 
home in 1936 to go to Spain and work as a governess to three young 
girls in a wealthy but troubled family. Haughtily ruling the Areavaga 
family roost is Dona Consuelo (Marisa Paredes), an ominous matriarch 
who is so devoted to the church that she allows the priest who teaches 
the girls piano to fondle his favorite pupil while giving instruction. 
When Mary observes this behavior and reports it to Dona Consuelo's 
husband, Vicente (Franco Nero), a doctor and poet who mopes around 
the property with a faraway look in his eye, the priest is dismissed 
and Mary becomes the object of Dona Consuelo's suspicion. Mary's status 
further deteriorates when she is seen dancing in a public square with 
her employers' handsome married son, Francisco (Vincent Perez), a 
political radical who falls instantly in love with her. She resists, 
of course, but you know how these things go. The lovers get to spend 
one perfect night together when a lesbian and fellow Irish expatriate 
named Conlon (Frances McDormand), who is hopelessly smitten with Mary, 
grits her teeth and donates her premises for a tryst. ``Talk of Angels'' 
offers the pleasure of watching two pairs of pretty eyes (Ms. Walker's 
and Perez's) locked in misty-eyed mutual admiration. But neither Ms. 
Walker nor Perez is much of an actor. You could do just as well by 
studying a sexy television commercial. The story is so clumsily told 
that ``Talk of Angels,'' which opens Friday, relies on a thudding 
voice-over narration by Mary to make sense of things. Her final words, 
``And that has made all the difference,'' are typical of the movie's 
overbearingly portentous verbiage. ``Talk of Angels'' is rated PG-13 
(Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations. TALK OF ANGELS
