For "The World," this is Alan Dow in the BBC Newsroom in London. The 
Deputy President of South Africa Tabow Inbacke has criticized some 
of the findings in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report. 
It singles out the mainly white National Party for the majority of 
human rights abuses committed during the apartheid era. But it also 
alleges human rights violations by leading figures from across the 
political spectrum. From Johannesburg, Jane Stanley reports. The Truth 
Commission's vast encyclopedia of human rights abuses details atrocities 
committed by all sides during the violent years of struggle in South 
Africa. The African National Congress went to court to try to prevent 
its publication. Now Deputy President Taburn Becky has described parts 
of the report as wrong and misguided. Harsher criticism has come from 
the ANC's alter rival, the Zulu-based Encarta Freedom Party, which 
says the stinging allegations against its leader Manga Sutu Vutalazi 
are preposterous. Jane Stanley, BBC News, Johannesburg.
