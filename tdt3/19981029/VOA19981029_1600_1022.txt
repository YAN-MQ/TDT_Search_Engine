This is VOA News Now, broadcasting from Washington. I'm Susan Yackee 
along with Tom Crosby. It's universal time. Here's the major news 
story we're following at this hour. The U.S. space shuttle Discovery 
lifts off, rocketing Senator John Glenn into space on a research mission, 
some 36 years after he was the first American to orbit the earth. 
We'll have more details on that story a little later. Time now for 
sports and joining us here in the studio with the latest details off 
the press is VOA's Steve Shei. Steve. They're not from the press, 
Susan. They're from our very own little typewriters. Thank you very 
much.
