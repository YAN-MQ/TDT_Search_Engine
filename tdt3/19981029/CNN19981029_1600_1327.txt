194 NBA games have been lost to labor strike and the team owners and 
players union still have not reached agreement on a new contract. 
Both sides planned to talk later today by phone after Wednesday's 
negotiations lasted well into the night. We made no progress. When 
it all came down to it, they were in their position and we stayed 
in ours. Both sides are losing, losing money. So there's definitely 
a sense of urgency to get the season started and start playing. So 
I think both sides are going to do whatever they have to do to ensure 
that we can start playing as soon as possible.
