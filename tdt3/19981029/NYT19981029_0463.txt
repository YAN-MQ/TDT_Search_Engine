The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 30: The similarities 
between the recent careers of Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut and 
Gov. George Pataki of New York are striking. Both men appear to have 
read the same playbook on how to succeed as a Republican in a Northeastern 
Democratic state. Rowland, like Pataki, started out as a tough budget-cutter 
who was indifferent to education issues and overly harsh in his plans 
for welfare reform. But during the last two years, with the help of 
a reviving economy, Rowland has become a friend to the environment, 
a champion of the public schools and a cheerleader for the central 
cities who says his goal is to make the Republican Party more ``inclusive.'' 
On the matter of campaign finance, Rowland has made a turnabout and 
signed a strong law that will virtually ban unregulated ``soft'' money 
in future Connecticut campaigns. This metamorphosis may, as his critics 
charge, be evidence of Rowland's political opportunism. But that is 
why we have elections. If the governor has begun to take an interest 
in schools, acquisition of open space and reviving urban areas because 
he wants to win voter approval, the system is working. Any concerns 
about the permanence of Rowland's transformation seem secondary given 
that his opponent, Rep. Barbara Kennelly, has conducted a terribly 
disappointing campaign. Her problems have gone beyond a lack of affinity 
for sound bites. Mrs. Kennelly seems hard pressed to describe her 
specific plans for making Connecticut better. Although she has spent 
a lifetime as a Hartford politician, she can offer no concrete ideas 
about the city's troubled school system _ a topic Rowland speaks about 
with intelligence and apparent enthusiasm. This dismal campaign should 
not obscure the good work Mrs. Kennelly has done during her years 
in Congress. But she has not earned the right to be governor. Our 
endorsement goes to Rowland.
