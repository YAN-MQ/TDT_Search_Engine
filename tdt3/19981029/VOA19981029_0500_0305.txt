Colombian President Andre Pestrana and President Clinton are pledging 
new cooperation in the fight against drugs in the pursuit of peace 
in the South American nation. President Clinton hosted Mr. Pestrana 
at the White House Wednesday and announced $280 million in aid to 
Colombia this coming year. Both our peoples have suffered greatly 
from the drug trade and its brutality. The battle against drugs is 
a common battle. It must unite our people, not divide them. The countries 
are promising to use all means at their disposal against drug traffickers. 
Colombia is the major source of cocaine for the U.S. market. I'm Bill 
Hazard, VOA News.
