In the Middle East today, violence clearly aimed at upsetting the 
israeli/Palestinian peace agreement. It was early this morning in 
Gaza. Here's ABC's Gillian Findlay. It could so easily have been so 
much worse. Israeli police say the suicide bomber who drove into this 
army Jeep was aiming for a school bus carrying 40 Israeli children. 
When the car exploded, none of the children was injured. One Israeli 
soldier was dead. It's the Palestinian authority which controls most 
of Gaza, and tonight, hard-line Israelis once again called on their 
prime minister to cancel the peace agreement. Benjamin Netanyahu, 
however, would only go so far as to repeat his claim that it's the 
Palestinians who are now responsible for its fate. This is the test 
now of the agreement and we want to see that test passed successfully 
by the Palestinian authority. In fact, the Palestinian response was 
swift and comprehensive. Police in Gaza detained dozens of Hamas leaders 
and activists -- the biggest crackdown in years. Even the movement's 
elderly spiritual leader, sheik Ahmed Yassin, was put under house 
arrest. So tonight, Hamas, the most dangerous of Palestinian extremist 
groups, again finds is self-lself facing two enemies. Israel and the 
Palestinian authority, which it increasingly sees as a chrab rater.
