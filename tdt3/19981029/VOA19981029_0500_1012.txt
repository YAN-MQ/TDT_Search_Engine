President Clinton has announced a $156 million program to fight AIDS 
among African Americans and Hispanics. He said it is a severe and 
ongoing health crisis in minority communities. The new funds will 
be used for prevention efforts for minorities, easier access to anti-AIDS 
drugs and more training for health care professionals.
