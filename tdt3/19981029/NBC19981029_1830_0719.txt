Health news tonight -- the food and drug administration has approved 
the powerful drug Tamoxifen for healthy women who are at high risk 
of developing breast cancer. It's a controversial decision, because 
Tamoxifen can have serious, even deadly side effects. Here's NBC chief 
science correspondent, Robert Bazell. For 29 million women in the 
United States at high risk for breast cancer, Tamoxifen could greatly 
reduce their chances of getting the disease, women like 56-year-old 
Judy Jordan, who fears breast cancer because it struck her mother 
and grandmother. It's very scary for me. It's something I think about 
all the time. What's considered high risk? Family history women are 
considered at risk because of advancing age, especially over 60, a 
history of precancerous breast lumps and having a First child late 
in life or having no children at all. It's a very important option 
for women to consider. But the chance of serious side effects will 
keep many women from taking this new option. Breast cancer activists, 
whose hot lines are flooded with calls, say there are some very difficult 
choices. We're very hopeful about this. We have a certain degree of 
caution in our hopefulness because of the side effects of the medication. 
And there's still a lot of testing of this drug that needs to go on. 
Those side effects include an increased risk of uterine cancer, cataracts 
and blood clots in the legs and lungs. Women will have to balance 
those risks with an average 44% reduction in their chance of getting 
breast cancer. And ultimately, there is no guarantee Tamoxifen will 
prevent the disease. So today's approval will mean one more difficult 
choice for many women to make with their doctors. Still, Tamoxifen 
is first drug that holds the promise of cutting a woman's chance of 
getting breast cancer. Robert Bazell, NBC news, New York.
