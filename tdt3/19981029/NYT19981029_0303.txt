Leaders of countries around the Caspian Sea declared Thursday that 
they want to export their new-found oil along a pipeline route favored 
by the United States. Competition for the pipeline is reaching a peak 
as oil companies prepare to announce which route they favor. They 
may make their choice as early as next month. The United States, Russia 
and Iran have each proposed routes that would favor their political 
and economic interests. The choice could have long-term strategic 
implications in the Caspian region and beyond. In Thursday's declaration, 
regional leaders ``strongly confirmed their determination'' to see 
the pipeline built on the U.S.-backed route. President Heydar Aliyev 
of Azerbaijan said he and his counterparts had signed ``a declaration 
of historic importance.'' He predicted that the pipeline would be 
``the most shining peace project of the 21st century.'' But because 
oil companies and not governments will pay for whichever pipeline 
is built, the declaration was largely symbolic. It increased political 
pressure on oil executives but did nothing visible to lessen the costs 
of what they consider an excessively expensive option. Joining Aliyev 
at Thursday's signing were the presidents of Georgia, Turkey, Kazakhstan 
and Uzbekistan. There was one surprise absentee, President Saparmurad 
Niyazov of Turkmenistan, who has at times proved a prickly partner 
for the United States. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson flew to 
Ankara, Turkey's capital, on Thursday to witness signing of the declaration 
and drum up last-minute support for the U.S.-backed route. Richardson 
was the latest in a stream of Clinton administration officials who 
have passed through the region in recent days. They are pressing for 
a route that would run from Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, to the 
Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean. ``Hard work remains to 
be done to build this pipeline, and today the presidents committed 
to doing it,'' Richardson said. ``From today, we are no longer talking 
about whether we will have a pipeline from Baku to Ceyhan. We are 
talking about how.'' Richardson won a modest breakthrough Thursday 
on an issue that had threatened to spread discord in the region. He 
emerged with an agreement by Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan to submit 
their sensitive border dispute to his mediation. The two countries 
disagree over ownership of potentially rich tracts under the Caspian. 
Diplomats said that under the plan agreed to Thursday, which was not 
publicly announced, Richardson would seek to offer a solution to the 
border dispute within four months. Neither side would be required 
to accept his solution, but there would be considerable pressure for 
both to do so. U.S. officials are urging Turkey to offer the oil companies 
inducements to build along the Baku-Ceyhan route. They say Turkey 
has begun to do so.
