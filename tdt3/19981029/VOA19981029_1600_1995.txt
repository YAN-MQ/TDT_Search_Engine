Thousands of Serb forces in Yugoslavia have withdrawn from Kosovo 
Province or have returned to their barracks in the area. But many 
still remain in the countryside near villages where ethnic Albanians 
want to return. And international verifiers are still not in place 
to monitor the cease fire and check on Serb military movements. VOA 
correspondent Laurie Kassman reports from Pristinov. The agreement 
hammered out by U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke calls for 2,000 
verifiers from the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
the OSCE. They will be on the ground in Kosovo to make sure Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic adheres to the cease fire and keeps his 
troops out of Kosovo. But the entire team is not yet in place. Right 
now, there are fewer than 50 staffers trying to work out the administrative 
details, from renting office space and housing to lining up some 1,000 
vehicles for the monitoring operations. The verifiers will be unarmed, 
so they have to count on cooperation from both sides in the conflict.
