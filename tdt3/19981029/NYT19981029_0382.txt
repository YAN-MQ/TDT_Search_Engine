Hitching a rhetorical ride on John Glenn's inspiring voyage into space, 
President Clinton Thursday bid the 77-year-old senator a safe journey 
and extolled the earthbound benefits of America's space program. The 
president declared Thursday's launching of the space shuttle Discovery 
``a great day for America, a great day for our senior citizens.'' 
He said he was ``absolutely thrilled'' by the spectacle of the liftoff 
_ the first witnessed by an American president since 1969 _ and described 
himself as ``like a kid at his first Christmas.'' Clinton, who was 
accompanied to the Kennedy Space Center by Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
the first lady, said he had nothing to do with the decision to allow 
Glenn to take to the heavens 36 years after his first orbital flight. 
``I think the American people should know that the decision to send 
him was made strictly by the book,'' Clinton said. ``I had no role 
in it.'' But he said that Glenn deserved the return trip. ``And, goodness 
knows, for a lifetime of service to us in the air and on the ground, 
he's earned this chance,'' the president said. Clinton, who has significantly 
refocused NASA since taking office in 1993 by challenging it to do 
more with less money, said the principal benefits of space exploration 
were discoveries with commercial applications on Earth. He cited advances 
in science, medicine and the environment made possible by experiments 
in space. Even before the shimmering rocket bearing Glenn and six 
other astronauts lifted off, Clinton used the occasion to try to boost 
voter participation in Tuesday's midterm election. Political analysts 
believe that turnout will determine Democratic prospects in elections 
for Congress and many statehouses. Responding to a question from Walter 
Cronkite, who was narrating the launching for CNN, Clinton said he 
wanted to avoid politics, at least until attending two political fund-raisers 
for Florida Democrats Thursday night in Palm Beach. But he called 
the space flight a triumph of American democracy and said, ``So if 
you feel patriotic when you see John Glenn and the others go up in 
space today, then keep that patriotic feeling until next Tuesday and 
go and vote for the candidate and the programs and the issues of your 
choice.'' Clinton was the first president to attend a space launching 
since President Nixon and his wife, Pat, watched the liftoff of Apollo 
12 in November 1969. Watching Discovery's launching with Clinton and 
the first lady from the roof of the Launch Control Center were Col. 
Robert Cabana of the Marine Corps, who will command the first U.S. 
mission of the international space center program, and Lt. Col. Eileen 
Collins, the Air Force officer who is scheduled to become the first 
woman to command a space shuttle mission next March. The launching 
also was seen by 27 senators, 13 House members and dozens of other 
dignitaries. Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said the 
Clintons were ``absolutely speechless'' for a minute and a half after 
watching Discovery ride a ribbon of fire into space. Thursday night 
in Palm Springs, Clinton spoke at a reception for Rep. Peter Deutsch 
that was expected to raise $200,000, then appeared at a dinner expected 
to yield $300,000 for Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, a candidate for governor.
