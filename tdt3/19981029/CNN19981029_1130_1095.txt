Some news brewing in the beer industry. According to the "Milwaukee 
journal Sentinel," pabst brewing company is negotiating to purchase 
Detroit-based stroh brewery. Under the deal, stroh, the nation's fourth-largest 
brewery, would cease to exist with pabst taking over the production 
of stroh's best-known brands. Pabst would also sell some of the stroh 
brands to the nation's number two brewery, Miller. If the deal goes 
through, pabst is likely to close most of stroh's seven breweries. 
No comment so far from stroh.
