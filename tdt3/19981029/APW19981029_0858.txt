A day after a U.N. report sharply criticized Myanmar's ruling junta, 
a U.N. envoy on Thursday met for the second time with pro-democracy 
leader Aung San Suu Kyi in an effort to promote a dialogue between 
government and opposition. The meeting between Alvaro de Soto, a special 
representative of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and Suu Kyi, 
head of the National League for Democracy, followed the envoy's meeting 
Wednesday with a top junta official. De Soto had a previous meeting 
with Suu Kyi on Tuesday, the day he arrived. United Nations, government 
and opposition sources have been generally closemouthed about the 
details of de Soto's mission. The new U.N. report, whose release in 
New York was unrelated to de Soto's visit, expressed deep concern 
about the continued harassment of political leaders and the detention 
of political prisoners in Myanmar, also known as Burma. It said serious 
human rights violations by Myanmar's armed forces were continuing 
in the ethnic minority areas, including arbitrary executions _ not 
sparing women and children _ rape, torture, inhuman treatment, forced 
labor and denial of freedom of movement. ``These violations have been 
so numerous and consistent over the past years as to suggest that 
they are not simply isolated or the acts of individual misbehavior 
by middle- and lower-rank officers but are rather the result of policy 
at the highest level, entailing political and legal responsibility,'' 
it said. The report was one of a series of country-by-country human 
rights reports by special rapporteurs presented to the General Assembly 
this year. A faxed request to the Myanmar government for a response 
to the charges went unanswered. The government said Thursday that 
Khin Nyunt, a senior member of the ruling junta, ``clarified the current 
political social and economic situation of Myanmar'' in his meeting 
Wednesday with de Soto. It said de Soto had conveyed Annan's position, 
and ``the meeting was reported to be constructive and fruitful.'' 
De Soto is on his fifth visit as a U.N. envoy since 1995. Since he 
last visited Myanmar in January, relations between the government 
and the opposition have deteriorated sharply, with the military increasing 
its repression of the pro-democracy movement and Suu Kyi's party increasing 
its challenges to the government's legitimacy. In the past few months, 
almost 1,000 members of Suu Kyi's party have been detained in an effort 
to block its activities. More than 100 have reportedly been released 
in the past few weeks, including 15 Thursday, the government said. 
In a statement released late Thursday, the National League for Democracy 
urged the government to prove its goodwill by freeing all the detainees 
``immediately without any preconditions.'' It criticized the junta's 
contention that party members had not been arrested, but merely invited 
to government guest houses for an exchange of views, as ``dishonorable.'' 
The assertion ``was a deliberate attempt by the government to deceive 
the visiting U.N. special envoy to Myanmar,'' it said.
