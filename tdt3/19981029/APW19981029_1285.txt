Mike Tyson is headed for a fight early next year at the site of his 
boxing ban. ``He's going to fight in January,'' Shelly Finkel, calling 
himself Tyson's boxing adviser, said Thursday. ``We're looking at 
Las Vegas.'' It was at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas that Tyson bit Evander 
Holyfield's ears June 28, 1997, leading to his license revocation 
and a dlrs 3 million fine. The Nevada State Athletic Commission voted 
4-1 on Oct. 19 to restore Tyson's license. The former champion, however, 
still faces a Dec. 1 trial on misdemeanor assault charges stemming 
from a traffic accident Aug. 31 at Gaithersburg, Maryland. Finkel 
did not mention a specific site or date, but the MGM Grand reportedly 
is interested in bringing Tyson back, with Jan. 16 a possibility. 
As for an opponent, Finkel said, ``We're looking at the Axel Schulzes, 
the Francois Bothas, the Vaughn Beans, somebody like that.'' Schulz, 
Botha and Bean are capable fighters, but are not knockout punchers, 
which is in their favor when considered as possible opponents for 
Tyson. They have good records and have title-fight experience. In 
other words, they are much more acceptable, and saleable at this point 
of Tyson's career than a Peter McNeeley would be. In Tyson's first 
fight after his release from prison in 1995, he beat McNeeley in 89 
seconds. Schulz lost a 12-round decision to George Foreman in a bid 
for the IBF title in 1995. The German also lost a 12-round decision 
to Michael Moorer for the vacant IBF championship in 1996. Botha of 
South Africa was stopped in the 12th round by Moorer in an IBF title 
fight Nov. 9, 1996. Bean failed to win the WBA-IBF titles when he 
was outpointed by Evander Holyfield on Sept. 19.
