Have a good evening. Good night. in a fire that took dozens of young 
lives. john Glenn sees skies of blue and clouds of white from a familiar 
vantage point. Scientists discover serious consequences for people 
who use illegal drug ecstasy. this is "CNN Headline News." Good morning, 
everyone. I'm Catherine Callaway. City leaders are calling it a tragedy 
of incomprehensible dimension. A fire raged through a dance hall during 
a halloween party in gothenburg sweden last night. It killed at least 
63 people. More than 170 were injured. The building was jammed with 
about 400 young people, most of them just 13 to 18 years of age. The 
building had a maximum occupancy of 150. People say most of the victims 
either suffocated on smoke and poisonous gas, or they were trampled 
in the panic. We were inside, but we came out quickly when we saw 
the fire. But some of the kids went again inside to help their friends 
and girlfriends.
