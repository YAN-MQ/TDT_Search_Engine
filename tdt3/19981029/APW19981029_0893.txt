An overcrowded river boat tipped over Thursday in eastern India, spilling 
its 70 passengers into rain-swollen waters. Officials said that two 
passengers were missing. The accident occured at dusk in Assam state, 
where heavy rains over the last months have swelled the Puthimari 
river. Earlier, officials said at least 35 people were feared drowned 
after panicked passengers jumped into the water. But D.N. Saikia, 
the district administrator of Kamrup, where the accident took place, 
said all but two passenger made it safely to shore. The Press Trust 
of India also clarified that the boat did not capsize but merely tilted 
because it was overcrowded.
