It's clear that American folk art has come into its own when it can 
attract collectors as diverse as Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, Woody 
Allen, Ronald Lauder and David Teiger. David who? Teiger is a successful 
New Jersey management consultant who has used his business acumen 
to assemble a collection that is the envy of every folk art museum 
in the country. ``He has relentlessly pursued the best of the best,'' 
said Nancy Druckman, the folk art specialist at Sotheby's. ``His collection 
just shouts quality.'' Teiger owns several of the icons in the field: 
the ``Miss Liberty'' wood sculpture once owned by the late collector 
Bernard Barenholtz which was sold for $71,500 at a Sotheby's auction 
in January 1990; ``Captain Jinx,'' a beloved carving of a Civil War 
soldier; the late Herbert Hemphill Jr.'s playful pine horse weather 
vane; the elegant curlew that set an auction record in 1997 for a 
piece of folk art sculpture, and the trumpeting ``Angel Gabriel'' 
weather vane, which was sold for $44,850 in March 1995 at the sale 
of the Bill Holland collection at Sotheby's. The list goes on. Teiger 
was virtually unknown in the art field until this week, when Harry 
N. Abrams published ``Spiritually Moving,'' a sumptuous coffee-table 
book about his collection that was put together by the graphic designer 
Tom Geismar and by Harvey Kahn, an expert in folk art, with essays 
by Kahn and others. Though the book does not mention Teiger's name, 
the secret leaked out and is sure to be a topic of conversation this 
year at the Fall Antiques Show. The show, which runs from Nov. 19 
through Nov. 22 at the 7th Regiment Armory in Manhattan, is celebrating 
its 20th anniversary with a benefit preview for the Museum of American 
Folk Art on Nov. 18. Teiger began his collection eight years ago, 
when he asked Kahn, who is a New Jersey neighbor, to help him put 
one together. Teiger already owned an important group of contemporary 
paintings and had commissioned the perfect setting for his collection-to-be: 
a cutting-edge house designed by Michael Rotondi and Clark Stevens 
of Roto Architects of Los Angeles, since featured on the cover of 
Architectural Digest. Kahn, a founding member of the Folk Art Society, 
had long collected folk art and had 40 years of experience in the 
field, but found it challenging to work with Teiger because his collecting 
criteria was unique. Teiger would only buy an object if he found it 
``spiritually moving.'' Teiger explained in a telephone interview: 
``I'm looking to be inspired, motivated, titillated by art. I want 
to be surrounded by objects that give me positive energy.'' He continued: 
``Of course I want first-rate pieces. I look for authenticity, integrity, 
original natural surface, and a strong sense of color and texture. 
But the most important thing is that I react in my gut.'' Don Walters, 
a dealer and former curator at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art 
Center in Williamsburg, Va., who contributed an essay to ``Spiritually 
Moving,'' wrote that Teiger's connoisseurship ``is tightly focused 
on esthetics alone.'' ``For years, historians, ethnologists, students 
of popular culture, collectors and dealers have been engaged in a 
war over semantics in an attempt to define and validate precisely 
who the `folk' are and whether what they make should be called naive, 
primitive, popular, vernacular, visionary or outsider art,'' he wrote. 
``This collection is about the art of appreciation, taking objects 
out of one context and putting them in another.'' Fred Giampietro, 
a New York dealer who helped Teiger acquire items, said: ``David Teiger 
is the first person who has come along who has bought folk art as 
art. Most approach it from the decorative standpoint. He treats it 
as an accepted great art.'' Frank Maresca, another veteran New York 
folk art dealer, called Teiger ``one of the most discerning collectors 
I've ever met,'' adding, ``He has taken folk art to a level I never 
knew existed.'' Where the Buyers Are ``Location is everything,'' said 
David Lester, the Florida-based organizer of four antiques fairs. 
He should know. The founder of the three-year-old Palm Beach International 
Fine Art &AMP; Antique Fair, is branching out. Thursday he opened 
his first Beverly Hills International Art &AMP; Antique Fair. Next 
summer he plans to inaugurate similar fairs in Aspen, Colo., and in 
the Hamptons. The Beverly Hills fair is being held at the intersection 
of Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards _ action central. ``It's within 
5 to 10 minutes of all the major homes in Beverly Hills and Bel Air,'' 
he said. He got permission to build a giant tent on the roof of a 
2,000-car parking garage next to Robinsons-May department store. ``You 
have to catch people where they are,'' Lester said. ``I lived in L.A. 
for 20 years, and it's like Palm Beach. People won't go any great 
distance to attend a fair.'' ``It cost $1 million to put up my tent,'' 
he continued. ``We take the same tent everywhere. It's an elite movable 
shopping center.'' Some shopping center. About 30 of the 55 exhibitors 
are European, including the London jewelers Asprey/Garrard; Peter 
Finer of Warwickshire, England (antique arms and armor) and Bernard 
Steinitz of Paris (important French antiques and period paneling). 
The fine art dealers are selling Old Masters, Impressionists, modern 
paintings, even Latin American art. Nine fine jewelers hope to attract 
the Hollywood glitterati. To this end, Lester assembled a Collectors 
Committee for the fair that is chaired by Mario Buatta, the New York 
interior designer who was in charge of New York's Winter Antiques 
Show for 17 years. The committee also includes renowned Los Angeles 
art patrons like Iris Cantor, Caroline Ahmanson and Wallis Annenberg, 
as well as collectors like Julian and Joanne Ganz Jr., and Jack and 
Joan Quinn. ``A fair has to be dazzling and impressive so people feel 
it's worth their time,'' Lester said. ``It has to be a cultural experience 
with everything from Art Deco carpets to 18th-century French boiseries. 
Fairs are entertainment. Ninety-five percent of the attendees don't 
buy.'' Nevertheless, he pointed out, the 5 percent who do, buy a lot. 
At his Palm Beach fair last January, he said, the dealers did $50 
million worth of business in 10 days. Los Angeles may have several 
world-class museums now, but it suffers from a dearth of good galleries. 
``It's the Second City syndrome,'' Lester said. ``When people went 
to buy something major, they flew to New York.'' Part of the problem 
also is geography. ``Los Angeles is so spread out it would take a 
month to see 50 dealers,'' he said. ``At our fair, you can see them 
in three hours.''
