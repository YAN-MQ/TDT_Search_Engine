The Palestinian Authority has put the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik 
Achmed Yasin under house arrest. The unprecedented move came after 
Hamas said it was responsible for this morning's suicide car bomb 
attack aimed at a bus of Israeli school children in the Gaza Strip. 
Earlier today, Israeli's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu said he 
made an angry phone call to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. An I 
said to him that unless he act immediately to carry our rigorously 
commitments that the Palestinian Authority took with respect to security 
and fighting terrorism, this process will not go anywhere. Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat condemned the bombing as a terrorist attack in 
a phone conversation with Israeli's prime minister. Mr. Arafat vowed 
to track down and punish the people behind it.
