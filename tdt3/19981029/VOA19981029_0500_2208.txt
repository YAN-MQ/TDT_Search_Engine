The U.S. special envoy, Richard Holbrooke, has rejected suggestions 
that NATO is bluffing about military strikes against Yugoslavia if 
Serbian forces do not end their crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 
Mr. Holbrooke's remarks came after a meeting with UN Secretary General 
Kofi Annan and VOA's Max Rustin reports. After his meeting with the 
UN Secretary General, Mr. Holbrooke spoke to reporters about the situation 
in Kosovo. He said some commentators, including a former U.S. Ambassador, 
had suggested that NATO was bluffing with its threat to attack Serbian 
forces in the absence of a political settlement concerning Kosovo. 
That suggestion, Mr. Holbrooke said, is false. When our little mission 
left for Belgrade three weeks ago, I put the chances of the use of 
force, that is bombing, that is an air war, at well over 65 percent, 
better than two-thirds, and for the first three or four days out there, 
I was almost certain we'd end up leaving without anything which could 
justify holding off on the bombing. The U.S. special envoy said he 
is convinced Serbian authorities eventually did take the threat seriously 
and that is why they agreed to withdraw their forces from Kosovo. 
Mr. Holbrooke said NATO forces remain ready to launch strikes against 
Serbian troops if Serbian authorities do not carry through with all 
their promises. He says the most important element of the situation 
now is implementation. Mr. Holbrooke described the process of diffusing 
the crisis which centered on his negotiations with Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic as precedent setting. He said it was an example 
of an important style of foreign policy. He said such foreign policy 
should not be compared to architecture which requires the implementation 
of clear, pre-established plans. Instead, he said, it is similar to 
jazz music, where the musician must learn to improvise on a general 
theme. Max Rustin, VOA News, United Nations.
