Russian Prime Minister Yvgeny Primikov says his government will take 
firm measures to impose greater state control over the economy. The 
government's new economic strategy is getting a chilly reception from 
international lenders. VOA's Peter Heimlein reports from Moscow. Prime 
Minister Primikov celebrated his 69th birthday Thursday by jetting 
to the troubled southern caucuses for talks with Islam Moscotof, president 
of the breakaway Chetznia region. Officials say the two men discussed 
combating the wave of kidnappings and other crimes sweeping Chetznia 
in the wake of its battle for independence from Russia. The Chetzin 
leader is reported to have pressed for Russian aid in repairing damage 
done nearly two years of civil war. But regional matters were not 
all that was on Mr. Primikov's mind. He told reporters on arrival 
in the caucuses city of Vladikofkas he has decided on tighter state 
controls as the way to pull Russia out of its current financial crisis. 
He said there must be discipline and order. More state economic planning 
is in line with Mr. Primikov's instincts as a former Soviet bureaucrat, 
but it is not likely to please international lenders. The newly devised 
economic formula was unveiled Wednesday for a visiting team from the 
International Monetary Fund which is considering whether to release 
another installment of a $22.6 billion loan package. Afterward, First 
Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, Yuri Mosliakauf characterized 
the IMF talks as difficult. Mr. Mosliakauf, a former head of economic 
planning in the Soviet era, was quoted as saying, "There have been 
a lot of critical comments from the IMF." Prime Minister Primikov 
says, regardless of the IMF's decision, Russia will not beg for help. 
But with another bitter Russian winter on the way and additional IMF 
money unlikely, the government has requested assistance in meeting 
its food requirements. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said 
this week, Russia has asked for help in importing significant quantities 
of meat and grain. A U.S. team arrived in Moscow Thursday to discuss 
terms of the assistance, but both sides declined to discuss details 
of the negotiations. Peter Heimlein, VOA News, Moscow.
