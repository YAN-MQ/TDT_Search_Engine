Well, earlier in the week, we were talking about an auction of works 
done by Picasso, not actually works done by Picasso but mementos that 
Picasso and one of his friends shared. There are some paintings in 
it -- were in the whole lot that was up for auction. Yes, but -- There 
was a lot of -- Sketches on matchbooks. Well, that's just a part of 
it, yes. A shoe box, torn bits of paper. They may not be priceless 
to you but boy, when they've got a Picasso associated with them, they 
go for a lot of money. The second day of an auction of unknown works 
by the famous Spanish painter, through scores of Picasso fans as well 
as onlookers fascinated by his love affair with Dora Maur, the subject 
of many of his sketches. She's also the model for a female figure 
in one of Picasso's most famous works, Guernica. But this is not one 
of his most famous projects. A series of Picasso drawings on five 
matchbook covers sold for almost $200,000, thirty times the original 
estimate. Another drawing entitled Dora with chinault -- am I pronouncing 
that right? -- hairstyle brought in more than $350,000. Receipts for 
Wednesday's sale came to more than $5 million. The sale of drawings 
and paintings on Tuesday, including Dora Maur with green nails, sold 
for about $30 million. Now, Ms. Maur was a photographer. She met Picasso 
in the 1930s when she was 29 and he was 55. They spent several years 
together before Picasso left her for a younger woman. She died; she 
didn't have a penny. But now look at all the stuff that she's collected 
over the years and now she -- her heirs are millionaires.
