Kremlin officials are playing down the importance of Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin's latest health problems, saying he is resting. Meanwhile, 
Prime Minister Yvgeny Primikov has filled in for the Russian leader 
at a European Union Summit in Austria. Doctors describe his condition 
as exhaustion and high blood pressure as related to a recent bout 
of bronchitis. The Kremlin says he will remain at the center where 
he's being treated for the rest of the week, then go on vacation for 
an unspecified amount of time.
