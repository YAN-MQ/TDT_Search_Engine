A Sudanese government aid agency pleaded for immediate help on Thursday 
for a southern province it said faced possible famine. The Humanitarian 
Aid Commission said in a written statement that current food supplies 
in Bahr el-Ghazal province would only last four weeks. It said food 
is badly needed arrives to battle malnutrition. ``Renewing of extended 
food supplies should be speeded up,'' said the statement carried by 
the official Sudanese News Agency. Hunger is a persistent problem 
in southern Sudan, where a 15-year civil war often has led to famine 
because rebels or government-backed militias burned or stole crops 
that their enemy or civilians rely on. About 1.5 million people have 
died in the fighting and resultant famines. Aid workers estimate an 
equal number of million people are facing severe food shortages in 
southern Sudan, mainly in Bahr el-Ghazal, as a result of drought and 
fighting. The U.N. World Food Program is dropping 9,500 tons of food 
a month at a cost of dlrs 30 million into the south in the world's 
largest aid operation. The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army has 
been fighting the Muslim government in the north since 1983 to demand 
more autonomy for Christian and animist people in the south. Both 
sides declared a cease-fire to allow international aid agencies work 
in the southern provinces. The government has said it applies to all 
of the south, while the SPLA said it is restricted to Bahr el-Ghazal, 
where the famine is concentrated.
