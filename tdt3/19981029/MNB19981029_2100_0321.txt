There are other NASA employees working on this flight but are you 
will earth bound. Sadly for them on the ground at mission control 
at the Johnson flight space center in Houston where tonight they're 
monitoring a potential small problem. With us now that part of the 
story. NBC news correspondent Jim Cummins. That's right, Brian. We've 
already had a shift change. There are three shifts at mission control 
and the group behind me is orbit two. They'll be followed by a planning 
team which meets tonight while the astronauts are asleep. One of the 
first things they'll look into is why the Hatch door came off and 
what threat does it pose to the mission. It came off two seconds after 
liftoff. It is a door that compartment for the drag chute. The drag 
chute is the chute that comes out when the shuttle lands. NASA has 
insisted all day that it does not at this point from their preliminary 
investigation pose a threat to the mission. They point out they didn't 
even have this chute during the first 50 shuttle missions. They said 
perhaps the chute is still in from even if the door is off. They're 
not saying yet for certain if the whole door came off, that it might 
be a piece of installation. That's one of the things they'll investigate 
overnight. I suspect we'll get more information later. They also said 
there was a small leak in a piece of equipment somewhere in the food 
area on the shuttle. They brought a piece of equipment in here. We're 
looking at a plastic hose. They were looking at it on the floor here 
trying to figure out what it is that's leeg leaking up on the shuttle. 
They continue to insist that's not a major problem either and that 
it does not pose any kind of threat to this mission. Jim, the guessing 
here was that small compartment door is long since a Cooked piece 
of charcoal on pad 39-B. I think it certainly is. You can see very 
clearly it came off in the first two seconds of launch and got completely 
consumed by the fires from those engines. It's a beautiful isolated 
shot of it happening. We were able to freeze the exact frame. Jim 
Cummins tonight at mission control out in Texas. Thank you very much. 
There's more to tell but as we continue this Thursday night from the 
kennedy space center.
