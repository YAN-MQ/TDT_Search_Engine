Prosecutors planned Thursday to charge two crew members of a fishing 
boat that transported 175 Iraqi Kurds to the Greek island of Crete. 
The two men were identified by Chania port authorities as Mustafa 
al Abdul Fatah, the ship's 46-year-old Libyan captain, and Mohammed 
el Hamsa, 28, a Syrian. They were arrested Wednesday when port authorities 
stopped the Lebanese-flagged Santa Maria. The illegal immigrants, 
including about 130 children, were huddled on board the 19-meter (62-foot) 
wooden vessel. According to media reports, the Santa Maria had set 
sail from Lebanon about two weeks ago and was heading for Italy but 
was forced to turn towards Crete when it ran into bad weather. The 
immigrants are being temporarily housed in a Chania hotel. Tens of 
thousands of illegal immigrants try to reach Greece each year from 
Turkey and the Middle East.
