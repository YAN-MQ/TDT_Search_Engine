Hurricane Mitch is losing strength as it hovers off the coast of Honduras. 
At last report, the storm was near the coastal city of limon. Forecasters 
expect the storm will remain a threat to the northwestern caribbean 
for two more days. Martin Savidge takes a look at how one city is 
coping with Mitch. In cancun, it was another nervous night. It will 
be another day of wondering and waiting on what hurricane Mitch will 
do. It follows what had been a previously anxious day for tourists. 
When for once, it wasn't the beaches of cancun that held all the appeal. 
But the airport. We're not going to be able to get out Bau because 
we're stand-by passengers. We've die-hards here. But I'm not a die-hard. 
Not to that degree. Not everyone has left cancun. Some took advantage 
of the nearly empty beaches to bask in a rare luxury -- privacy. In 
cancun itself, preparations continue for a possible meeting with Mitch. 
Some businesses are closed and boarded. Others ready to quickly do 
the same. It is to the south, in Honduras, where Mitch is having the 
greatest impact. Heavy rains, with up to 20 inches in some areas. 
Have poured ashore, triggering flooding. Many residents have sought 
out the safety of shelters, waiting for the hurricane to pass. As 
much of a pounding as Mitch has been delivering, the coastline has 
been beating back, draining some of the storm's fury. Mitch may not 
be the monster category 5 it once was, but it is still a Deadly storm, 
still waiting to cam ashore. For tourists caught in its potential 
path, Mexico is usually a great vacation getaway. Now, with Mitch 
nearby, the only getaway most of them are interested in is their own.
