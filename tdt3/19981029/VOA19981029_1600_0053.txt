The U.S. space shuttle Discovery is heading into space with Senator 
John Glenn aboard. With President Clinton, members of Congress and 
a huge crowd looking on, Mr. Glenn and his six crew mates blasted 
off aboard Discovery from Cape Canaveral, Florida. In the crowd was 
a group of young scientists from Northeast High School in Philadelphia. 
They're sending up microscopic worms to see how space travel affects 
aging. Student Leo Shirofski says the worms only live about 18 days. 
They're just going to see the effect of microgravity and cosmic rays 
on it. They're going to bring it back down and we have a control group 
also. We set it up in Philadelphia and we're going to compare their 
life spans. Seventy-seven year old Mr. Glenn is the oldest person 
ever to make a space flight and to conduct geriatric research during 
the nine day mission. Experts say the weightlessness of space mimics 
some of the effects of aging.
