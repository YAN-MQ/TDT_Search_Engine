Owners of the National Football League meetings in Kansas City, Missouri 
have approved a 31 team schedule for next year that includes the new 
Cleveland Brown's franchise. The revamped scheduling format announced 
Wednesday will place six teams, including the Browns, in the Central 
Division of the American Conference. One team in the division will 
have a buy each week of the season. On Tuesday, one group from Houston 
and two groups from Los Angeles made presentations to the owners in 
hopes of returning franchises to those cities. Denver Bronco's owner, 
Pat Bowling, says either city would be a good addition to the league. 
It would be nice to have a team in the Los Angeles area but also Houston's 
not exactly a small city or small area either so, you know, I look 
at them both as being equal at this point in time. The owners are 
expected to announce with the League will add a 32nd team this March. 
The NFL awarded the Cleveland franchise to a group headed by Al Lerner 
and Carmen Policy in September. The price of the team was $530 million.
