Amid all the religious trappings and walking dead of ``John Carpenter's 
Vampires,'' the real miracle is how its cast was able to keep a collective 
straight face. A compendium of mumo jumbo and claptrp interrupted 
by vampire hunts, gory deaths, flambeed fiends and a battle to save 
the world from a better brand of vampire than Bram Stoker imagined, 
``Vampires'' never manages to be either frightening or suspenseful. 
By its end, a world that should be saved from movies like this has, 
at least, been saved from a new breed of evildoer. Ridiculous without 
being awful enough to be hilarious, ``Vampires'' is chock full of 
exhausted lines like: ``Let's go to work,'' ``Suck it up,'' ``We were 
set up,'' ``End of the line'' and, if I'm not mistaken, ``Let's kill 
some vampires, padre.'' Most of this simple-minded nonsense, directed 
by Carpenter (``Halloween'') from a screenplay by Don Jakoby, is snarled 
by James Woods in the adrenal role of Jacky the vampire slayer. He 
is Jack Crow, leader of a scruffy band of mercenary vampire hunters 
and a fellow with a background a psychiatrist would pay for the pleasure 
of treating. It seems that when Jack was a little boy, he discovered 
that Daddy was a vampire. Daddy was attacking Mommy. Jack attacked 
Daddy. Jack wound up an orphan. Jack was taken in by the Roman Catholic 
Church and reared to become its vampire hunter. When ``John Carpenter's 
Vampires'' begins, Jack is leading an assault on an old house in the 
Southwest, spearing the undead with arrows fired from a crossbow while 
he is attached to a cable that enables a Jeep to haul the vampires 
outside, where the sunlight combusts them into what Jack calls ``crispy 
critters.'' (Later in this film, whose cast includes Daniel Baldwin 
as Jack's sidekick and Maximilian Schell as an unctuous cardinal, 
Sheryl Lee as a punctured love object and Tim Guinee as a young priest, 
Jack makes clear that he is dealing with real vampires, not those 
movie fakes. So no bats, no garlic, no satin-lined coffins, although 
the old wooden stake through the heart remains an effective remedy.) 
But Jack's raid has not been a total success. He and his crew have 
failed to find the master vampire, and that night, as they are celebrating 
their deeds with whores and beer in a motel, the master, Valek (Thomas 
Ian Griffith), attacks. And what's worse than the carnage is the fact 
that Valek knows Jack's name. Jack, already a poster boy for paranoia 
where vampires are concerned, takes this familiarity to mean he has 
been betrayed by someone on the inside of his Vatican-financed operation, 
although why a vampire with telepathic powers couldn't pick up Jack's 
name from eavesdropping on the chitchat at the party is never made 
clear. Anyway, the plot is off and running into an effort to finish 
off Valek before he can lay his taloned hands on a 14th-century cross 
that will enable him and his minions to be like most everybody else: 
sleep nights, work days. Sounds like more of a problem for a labor 
union than a hired assassin. ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' is rated 
R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes 
gory violence, burnings, nudity, jokes about sexual arousal and plenty 
of foul language. PRODUCTION NOTES JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES Directed
