Moceanu claims her father spent her earnings on risky investments. 
A family court in Houston, Texas approved an arrangement that declares 
moceanu an adult, so she can take control of her finances. I want 
to get one thing straight is that, I'm not living at home. I'm not 
going back home, as people are saying. I'm living at my residency 
that I have made for me. Second of all, I will be looking into my 
finances, and Mr. Moore will be helping me out, into getting my money 
management and getting it handled, and everything in the future that 
lies ahead is just going to be up to me from now on. Moceanu claims 
her father spent her earnings on risky investments. It's not clear 
how much money remains in her trust fund.
