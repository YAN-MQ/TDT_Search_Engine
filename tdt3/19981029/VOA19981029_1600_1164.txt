In other baseball news, the health of former Major League Baseball 
Hall of Famer, Joe DiMaggio, is apparently improving as he continues 
to recover from pneumonia. The 84 year old DiMaggio, who has been 
widely acknowledged as baseball's greatest living player, fell ill 
earlier this month. A New York newspaper says the former New York 
Yankee entered Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, Florida on October 
12th with severe breathing problems. An attorney for Mr. DiMaggio 
said his client was sitting up and breathing easier on Wednesday but 
other sources say the baseball legend still faces a lengthy hospital 
stay as he battles a serious lung infection.
