"CNN Headline News." I'm Toria Tolley, sitting in for Chuck Roberts. 
John Glenn is a U.S. senator, an American hero in space, and today 
he is payload specialist two. That's Glenn's official title for the 
nine-day mission of the space shuttle "Discovery," which lifted off 
this afternoon from Florida's Kennedy space center. The launch was 
19 minutes late. Delays came when an alarm sounded in "discovery's" 
cockpit, and when a Plane flew into the restricted area. Glenn's return 
to space comes 36 years after he became the first American in orbit. 
And fellow space pioneer buzz aldrin says right about now Glenn is 
probably getting an eyeful. I hope they get a very good view. If you 
remember on John Glenn's first flight, he didn't have very good view 
outside the spacecraft. He had to look through a periscope. I'm sure 
he, in particular, is relishing the experience of zero gravity. Maybe 
tossing a glove around and watching it float in front of him. But 
I'll bet he can't wait to get to those windows to look outside. 300,000 
people gathered in and around the Kennedy space center for the launch. 
There were several makeshift block parties, and nearby highways were 
lined with cars, tents and souvenir vendors. In John Glenn's hometown 
of new Concord, Ohio, a cheering crowd watched their hero rocket back 
into orbit on large screen televisions set up in a College gymnasium. 
Other residents hoisted flags and banners, and a vigil was held at 
Glenn's family church.
