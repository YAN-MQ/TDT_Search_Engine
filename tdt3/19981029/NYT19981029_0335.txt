The three major products of the Mideast are Arab oil, Israeli technology 
and political myths cooked up by both sides _ some entirely homemade, 
others a compote of foreign and domestic ingredients. They travel 
well. One appeared in the New York senatorial campaign _ the one about 
how the Gulf war was useless for the United States and should not 
have been fought. The other is new _ Benjamin Netanyahu reversed himself 
at Wye and got nothing worth having. It is selling in America and 
Israel. On Jan. 12, 1991, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., voted ``no'' 
to authorizing American force against Saddam Hussein. On Oct. 18, 
1998, Schumer, running for senator, said that the Bush administration 
had had no clear plan on how to deal with Saddam and that since Iraq 
was still menacing the United States ``had proved'' his vote correct. 
Actually, Schumer had not concentrated on Bush planning failures but 
on protesting that sending troops would end chances of a peaceful 
diplomatic settlement with Saddam. Of everything said in the D'Amato-Schumer 
campaign, Schumer's voting rationale interests me most _ for present 
and future significance. The United States threw away fruits of victory, 
but if it had not first defeated Iraq by military force, Saddam would 
years ago have taught Schumer what menace meant. Iraq would have thousands 
more biological and chemical weapons, plus a nuclear-loaded missile 
arsenal big enough to be a deterrent against both the United States 
and what remained of Israel after Saddam's advertised incineration 
campaign. Saddam fights inspection imposed by the war because it has 
uncovered much of his concealed stockpiles. He itches to get back 
to restocking death against Israel, and parading America as a slovenly 
appeaser. The ``useless war'' is not an academic argument. History 
is being rewritten at the United Nations right now, aimed at freeing 
Saddam from sanctions and effective inspection. I am sure Schumer 
had no desire for its company, but he and the Saddam-appeasement claque 
say America should not have fought the war that so far has prevented 
Iraq from becoming a great power in nuclear, chemical and biological 
weaponry. Washington falters and stalls, but it is still a barrier 
against releasing Saddam from restrictions, weakened as they are. 
If enough senators believe the war was useless, that barrier will 
collapse. Schumer has a few days to explain himself further. Wye: 
The myth grows that Netanyahu reversed his prime ministerial promises 
not to give up any land. Many Americans and Israelis have been shouting 
at him so loud that they can't hear what he says. He gave up land 
almost as soon as he took office. He fulfilled Labor's commitment 
to give up the revered city of Hebron. Netanyahu said he would carry 
out Labor's written land promises to the Palestinians, but not its 
hints and nudges. He said what he wanted _ a peace that he could tell 
Israelis was based on as much security as any peace with Palestinians 
could offer: Everything nailed down in writing in advance. A specific 
timetable of reciprocity _ so much of the agreed new 13 percent withdrawal 
for so much confirmed action against terrorism, racial filth, Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad strongholds. ``This is the most important,'' said 
an Israeli official. ``We told Arafat if there are final negotiations 
we will give him only 1 percent more. He knows we mean it.'' ``Arafat 
is asking for a total of 95 percent,'' I said. ``You mean, Israel 
offers l percent more, for 41 percent, and he agrees?'' ``Yes,'' he 
says, ``or no settlement. Washington agrees that only we will decide 
the withdrawal.'' ``Is this the same agreement that the same U.S. 
administration made and broke after Israel turned over Hebron?'' ``Yes,'' 
he says. I contain enthusiasm. But I think, Netanyahu is fulfilling 
his word to Israelis to consider only a peace plan that would be secure 
if Arafat did carry out his promises. What happens when Arafat dies 
and fundamentalists take over Palestine, Jordan and Saudi Arabia? 
I hear that they are training to be gentle, democratic fundamentalists. 
I'll check it out.
