We are hearing chief justice William rehnquist that's Mr. chief justice 
has arrived as has the White House legal team. Turning to senior Washington 
correspondent Charles Bierbauer. Talking about this venear of bipartisanship 
strained and scratched a bit. Talk about what the deal was supposed 
to have been that is causing so much trouble today. Remember the hundred 
senators met behind closed doors and hashed this out in the Senate 
chamber and afterwards wrote down what they thought hay had agreed 
to. The agreement was a small committee, two republicans and two democrats, 
whose responsibility would be to vek the request for witnesses. What 
do you want to hear from witness X, Monica Lewinsky or Kathleen willey. 
Well, isn't that in the material provided by Ken Starr? What else. 
We can stipulate that. Very precise what they wanted to hear, from 
whom and under what circumstances. That committee hasn't really been 
formulated. Like in the movie Casablanca shocked to hear meetings 
are going on. What precluded prosecutors from the house side from 
meeting with prosecutors. And the democrats declined to go. That's 
my understanding, they did not attend that meeting. I understand this 
is not all going on behind-the-scenes in terms of sqabbling over witnesses. 
Witnesses will be the biggest shall use to be resolved. We hear that 
Henry Hyde wants the president to testify, some people say can you 
compel him to, and if he did, would he be able to take the 5th amendment. 
None of these things are answered in the rules, there's no precedent 
for it. A couple of things, a couple of senators said this morning 
that struck me as interesting, these are republican senators, senator 
Kyl from Arizona said depends how much the facts are in dispute, lay 
down the facts, if nobody is disputing we don't need to talk to witnesses. 
If the facts remain in dispute, certainly in disputes in the papers 
as laid forward, that enhance the argument to have witnesses. One 
quick note on rehnquist, on a sexual harassment case he didn't ask 
a Question, didn't tip his hand. Thanks, Charles.
