The illicit drug known as ecstasy may cause long-lasting nerve cell 
damage in the brains of heavy users, according to a report published 
Thursday by scientists at Johns Hopkins University. The study compared 
the brain scans of 14 men and women who reported having used the drug 
from 70 to 400 times with the scans of control subjects who said they 
had never used it. The heavy users of ecstasy, formally known as MDMA, 
showed a significant decrease in brain cells responsible for reabsorbing 
serotonin, a messenger chemical involved in mood, appetite, pain perception, 
sexual drive and memory. People who take ecstasy on a recreational 
basis ``are unwittingly putting themselves at risk,'' the scientists 
said. The research team, led by Dr. George Ricaurte, a neurologist, 
developed a novel technique for tracking the cells, called serotonin 
transporters, using positron emission tomography, or PET scanning. 
Transporter cells are embedded in nerve cell membranes at the tips 
of thin projecting fibers called axons. The reduction in serotonin 
transporters in heavy users, Ricaurte said, is an indication that 
serotonin nerve endings, where the transmitter is released, have been 
damaged. It is still unknown whether people who have used ecstasy 
less frequently _ taking it a few times over the course of years, 
for example _ incur similar damage. Nor is it clear what if any effects 
the nerve damage caused by heavy use might have on behavior. But Ricaurte 
said his team found early indications that MDMA had some effects on 
memory. People who have taken ecstasy say that it makes them feel 
closer to other people and puts them more in touch with their emotions. 
One psychotherapist described it as ``penicillin for the soul.'' Ecstasy 
is a hybrid of the stimulant methamphetamine and the hallucinogen 
mescaline. It was synthesized more than 80 years ago as an appetite 
suppressant, and became popular as a street drug in the 1970s and 
early '80s. The compound was banned in 1985 by the Drug Enforcement 
Administration after truck drivers began using it as a stimulant. 
Ecstasy still has a following in the all-night club scene and is valued 
by some psychotherapists, who say it helps break down psychological 
barriers. The study, published in the medical journal Lancet, lends 
support to earlier work by the Johns Hopkins team, which found evidence 
of damage to serotonin nerve endings in primates and other animals 
given doses of ecstasy equivalent to those taken by some humans, when 
differences in body mass and other factors are taken into account, 
the researchers said. Subjects in the study were screened to make 
sure they had not used other drugs, like marijuana, cocaine and barbiturates, 
that could affect the results in the period immediately before the 
study. The study's results leave open the question of whether the 
damage from MDMA is reversible in humans. In studies in baboons, brain 
alterations triggered by ecstasy were still present a year after the 
animals were given the drug. The study offers ``a warning that this 
kind of drug use can produce long-lasting abnormalities in the brain,'' 
said Dr. John Mann, a Columbia University psychiatrist and chief of 
neuroscience at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. ``People 
take a lot of stuff that affects their brains thinking that it's harmless, 
and it might not be.''
