The final report by South Africa's Truth Commission labels apartheid 
a crime against humanity in which both whites and blacks were guilty 
of gross human rights violations. The report says the former apartheid 
state bears responsibility for most violations but key liberation 
figures in the fight to end apartheid were also singled out for fomenting 
violence against their rivals and the white government.
