A pair of key economic reports out today. First-time claims for unemployment 
benefits fell last week by 18,000, the first decline in four weeks. 
That relatively tight labor market is forcing employers to pay more 
to attract good workers. In fact, wages and benefits rose a larger-than-expected 
1% in the third quarter and are up 3.7% over the past year. That's 
the steepest increase in 6 1/2 years. And it means employment costs 
are rising faster than the overall inflation rate, something federal 
reserve policymakers will have to consider when they meet next month.
