LONDON (AP) _ BSkyB's 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid to buy 
Manchester United received a setback Thursday when the government 
referred the proposed deal for a full investigation by its Monpolies 
and Mergers Commission. Trade and Industry Secretary Peter Mandelson 
issued a statement saying the MMC would decide whether the deal would 
break the rules of fair trading. ``The decision to a make a reference 
does not in any way prejudge the question of whether or not the merger 
would be against the public interest,'' the statement said. ``It is 
for the MMC to report on this after its investigation.'' The MMC is 
due to issue its findings by March 12. BSkyB, owned by Australian-born 
media magnate Rupert Murdoch, had hoped that Mandelson would not hold 
up the deal by sending it to the MMC. Many Manchester United fans 
and lawmakers argue that BSkyB's takeover of Europe's richest club 
would increase Rupert Murdoch's already huge stake in TV coverage 
of soccer in Britain and create a monopoly. One of the leading campaigners 
against the bid, Manchester United Independent Supporters' Association 
spokesman Andy Walsh, said the referral gave opponents time to gather 
more opposition. ``I am absolutely delighted,'' he said. ``This is 
what we've been working for over the last two months and it's exactly 
what we wanted. ``The referral to the MMC will give football fans 
from Manchester United and other clubs the opportunity to discuss 
for the first time how football should be structured in this country. 
``We expect the MMC to look at all aspects of the game, not just the 
BSkyB-Man United takeover,'' Walsh said. ``Hopefully they will ensure 
the situation caused by the Sky attempt to take over our club is a 
thing of the past.'' Mark Booth, the American chief executive of BSkyB, 
and Martin Edwards, chief executive of Manchester United, issued a 
joint statement on the MMC referral. ``We will put our case strongly 
to the MMC that the proposed transaction will not operate against 
the public interest and should be allowed to proceed,'' the statement 
said. ``The boards of both companies firmly believe that the acquisition 
of Manchester United by BSkyB would be good for the club, the players 
and the fans and will bring together two companies whose skills complement 
each other and have demonstrated their commitment to football.'' Graham 
Kelly, chief executive of the English Football Association, said the 
FA opposed the deal on the basis that it would make one club far too 
powerful compared with the others. ``The FA welcomes Peter Mandelson's 
decision. Our concerns are widely known,'' Kelly said. ``There are 
clearly issues of fairness and, in the public interest, it is to be 
debated. The referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is 
the best way for that to happen.'' Thursday's announcement comes two 
days after BSkyB, which exclusively shows live Premier League games 
in England, said it had not yet won control of the majority of shares. 
The satellite broadcasting company said it had received valid acceptances 
from shareholders representing 33.5 percent of the club's shares. 
Combined with shares that BSkyB has been buying directly, the broadcaster 
has a total ownership just under 45 percent and needs to have more 
than 50 percent to gain a controlling stake in the club.
