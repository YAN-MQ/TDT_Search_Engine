Charlie is making his way back to deeper waters. Charlie's not the 
tuna fish spokesman, but a shark that has been trapped in the port 
of Miami for almost two weeks. Fishermen caught him in a net and dragged 
him to shallow waters, trapping him in the port. Charlie was tagged 
by researchers Tuesday and then finally freed.
