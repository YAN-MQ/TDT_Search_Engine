British colonialism is history in Hong Kong, but the last governor, 
Chris Patten, got a hero's welcome Thursday from hundreds of people 
who see him as a symbol of the good old times when money was easy 
to come by and unemployment was close to nil. Hong Kong has slipped 
into recession since the handover to Chinese rule in July 1997 _ a 
casualty of Asia's crisis rather the political transition _ but some 
of Patten's fans say the sharp-witted and politically savvy Briton 
might have had the right stuff for saving the territory. ``He's charismatic 
and eloquent,'' said Paul Leung, an insurance salesman who came to 
greet Patten and get a signed copy of the ex-governor's new book, 
``East and West.'' ``He has a way to pump people up,'' Leung said. 
``I think people are convinced that things would have been OK with 
him at the helm. That's why people miss him so much.'' Patten's visit 
has drawn the inevitable comparisons between Patten and his successor, 
the Beijing-picked Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. Tung is highly regarded 
for his diligence and sincerity, but many people say he just doesn't 
have the natural charm to lead a dispirited people out of their economic 
doldrums. Patten is here on a four-day private trip to promote his 
book, a memoir of his five years as governor. This is his first visit 
since Britain handed over Hong Kong's sovereignty. In a sharp contrast 
to the old-fashioned and reserved Tung, whose aversion to publicity 
has cost him much of his popularity, Patten has rolled through town 
on a trademark charm offensive, chatting with admirers and walking 
the streets at ease, waving to supporters and teasing small children. 
``You're the best, and you're one of the finest,'' said Annie Wan, 
a marine policewoman. Patten gave her a big smile. Another fan, Annie 
Li, got up before 6 a.m. for the hourlong commute from her apartment 
in the rural New Territories, just so she could be the first in line. 
Lin didn't mind the four-hour wait: She has all the time in the world 
since she was fired from her job as a sales clerk a year ago. ``If 
Patten were still the governor, things wouldn't be so bad now,'' Li 
said. Tung ``has a lot to learn from Patten. He has direction. He 
has a vision.'' ``Even though Patten is a foreigner, he's more open 
to our views than the Chinese leaders,'' said Kelvin Wan, a technician 
for the Mass Transit Railway. Patten is endearingly known here as 
``Fat Pang,'' a reference to his love for food and bulging belly, 
and people fondly remember his casual walkabouts in dilapidating neighborhoods, 
where he shared laughs and tales with the underprivileged. But his 
stubborn arm-wrestlings with China also made him no darling to many 
political conservatives. To protest the democratic reforms he engineered 
without its approval, Beijing dismantled an elected legislature and 
replaced it with a handpicked body in 1997. Yi Chung-yiu, a doctor 
who spent most of his life in Britain, gave Patten a small picture 
with a line saying: ``The truly well-bred advocate equality.'' ``Mr. 
Patten was instrumental in bringing democracy to Hong Kong,'' Yi said. 
``People felt a bit insecure when he left.''
