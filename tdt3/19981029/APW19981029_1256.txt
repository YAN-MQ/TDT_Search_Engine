A powerful blast tore through the headquarters of a state-run fuel 
and energy company in St. Petersburg on Thursday, causing serious 
damage and two slight injuries, a news agency said. The explosion 
tore up concrete flooring and blew out doors and windows on the first 
floor of the Toplivno-Energetichesky Komplex company, ITAR-Tass reported, 
citing a company official. It also shattered windows in nearby buildings. 
Authorities were investigating the blast, and there were no reports 
of anyone claiming responsibility. The director of the company, Konstantin 
Dubov, said he thought the blast might be related to recent efforts 
to cut internal spending and tighten customers' debt repayment. ``Probably 
the order which is being introduced does not suit everybody, and I 
think this is the main cause of the incident,'' he said, according 
to ITAR-Tass. Valery Kislov, a company spokesman, said flying glass 
from the blast slightly injured one worker in his shin, and another 
employee complained of temporary deafness.
