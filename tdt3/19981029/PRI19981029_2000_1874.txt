The Palestinian authorities have faced the leader of the radical Islamic 
movement Hamas under house arrest. Sheik Akmed Yassein was detained 
as Palestinian police officers rounded up dozens of Hamas activists. 
The security operation came several hours after a car bomb in Gaza 
killed two people. Palestinian Leader Yassir Arafat condemned the 
attack. The Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu said only tough 
Palestinian action would guarantee the future of the peace agreement 
reached last week in Maryland. If the Wye Agreement is to have any 
meaning, the Palestinian Authority must crack down in the most forceful 
way. This is the test now of the agreement. Benyamin Netanhau.
