The Spanish judge who issued the order for Pinochet's arrest will 
continue to seek his extradition if the judge gets the backing of 
National Court colleagues considering the issue Thursday. News reports 
said Judge Baltasar Garzon had no intention of dropping his case against 
Pinochet despite Britain's High Court ruling that the former Chilean 
leader was entitled to immunity from prosecution.
