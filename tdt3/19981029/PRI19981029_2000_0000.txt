From Public Radio International, this is "The World." A coproduction 
of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH Boston. It's Thursday, October 
29th. I'm Lisa Mullens in Boston. Today South Africa's Truth and Reconciliations 
Commission releases its final report, sparing neither white apartheid 
rulers, nor black liberation leaders. The Palestinian Authority puts 
the leader of Hamas under house arrest after a car bomb explodes in 
the Gaza strip. And "The World's" oldest astronaut, John Glenn takes 
off in the Shuttle Discovery. There have been some exciting shuttle 
flights, but this has got to be the most interesting one we've seen 
in some time. Also, the anniversary of a nation and the death of a 
poet. First, this news.
