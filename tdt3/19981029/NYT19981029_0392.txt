Work has always been a problem for television. Remember ``Ozzie and 
Harriet''? Harriet Nelson was the classic stay-at-home mom, but nobody 
ever quite knew what her husband did for a living. Situation comedies 
sometimes filled the void by giving their stars an easy-to-portray 
career: being on TV. Recall, if you're old enough, the ``Jack Benny 
Show,'' or ``Burns and Allen.'' When TV has depicted more conventional 
occupations, it has often chosen the exciting. Police officers, lawyers 
and physicians litter the bluish-gray landscape of television history. 
And while here and there a psychotherapist or a barkeeper turns up, 
there are relatively few CPAs or dentists. But the new TV season has 
brought a turning, however slight, away from the high-profile professions 
that have been especially prominent in the '90s in favor of a more 
workaday world and some acknowledgments that most people hold regular 
jobs. In new shows like ``Jesse'' (about a barmaid who aspires to 
be a nurse), ``The King of Queens'' (a deliveryman), ``Southie'' (about 
blue-collar Boston) and ``Trinity'' (blue-collar New York), life has 
taken a decidedly working-class turn. Audrey Steele, who ought to 
know, calls it a minitrend. Ms. Steele, a senior vice president at 
Zenith Media Services Inc., which buys air time for advertisers, has 
watched the pilot and second episode of every new show this fall and 
has lived to tell the tale. She says this year's spate of blue-collar 
programs is a departure from shows in which affluent and glamorous 
characters live in great places and have few worries about money _ 
finances weren't much of a problem in ``Seinfeld,'' for instance. 
But in one sense, she says, the trend in the new shows is not all 
that new. For despite all the cowboys, doctors and cops, television 
has a parallel tradition of showing working men and women that dates 
from ``The Honeymooners,'' with its bus driver and sewer worker and 
their homemaker wives, and runs through ``All in the Family,'' ``Sanford 
and Son,'' ``Taxi,'' ``Married with Children,'' ``Roseanne'' and even 
``The Simpsons.'' But the timing of the proletarian upsurge is interesting. 
Television is downshifting as the economy threatens to do likewise. 
And as a tinge of blue creeps into TV's collars, a dose of blue is 
coloring its characters' situations and their psychology. New shows 
like ``Maggie Winters'' and ``Encore! Encore!'' are built around people 
who have returned home in defeat from the wider world. Could it be 
that television, with its antenna forever riveted to the Zeitgeist, 
has detected a kind of prosperity fatigue, a sense that we're all 
a little worn out by success, a little worried that it can't possibly 
last? Could the direction of the current TV season, planned months 
ago, be an early symptom of the economy's Asian flu? I am aware of 
no study of television's effectiveness at this sort of prognostication, 
but there is a logic to the idea of TV as economic indicator. Whether 
television reflects consumer thinking or directs it can be argued 
long and hard, but, whether it's mirror or lamp, we know it is created 
by executives striving mightily to produce programming that is of 
its time. Think of your set as an electronic version of a woolly caterpillar, 
portending a hard winter. The new crop of shows includes some focusing 
on owners as well as on workers. For connoisseurs of TV culture, the 
hands-down winner in this genre has got to be ``Wind on Water,'' with 
Bo Derek as the matriarch of a Hawaiian cattle ranch. (``Interesting 
work if you can get it,'' Ms. Steele says.) Despite the sniping of 
critics who see no redeeming value in the show, it does deal frankly 
with such important business themes as cash flow, diversification 
and corporate succession. In need of money to support the struggling 
cattle operation, for instance, Derek's on-screen sons diversify away 
from agriculture by competing on the ``extreme sports'' circuit. And 
you thought things were tough in your line of work.
