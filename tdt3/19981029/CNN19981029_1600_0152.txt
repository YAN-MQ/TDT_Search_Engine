President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were among 
the dignitaries who watched today's historic launch. The president 
said he felt like a kid at his first Christmas. Mr. Clinton is the 
first president to witness a space launch since 1969. The president 
praised John Glenn and called today a "great day for america." There's 
the John Glenn factor. Senator Glenn is a very good personal friend 
of Hillary and I as well as an ally and colleague. And as all Americans, 
I'm thrilled that he is going up today . Also, this really is the 
last launch before we begin to put the international space station 
up. So John Glenn began this first phase of our space program and 
he's ending it just before we begin the space station.
