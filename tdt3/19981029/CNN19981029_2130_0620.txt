In the fast-growing era of computer technology, some politicians are 
now using the Internet to raise campaign funds. Greg LaMotte reports 
in this edition of "tech trends." Thanks for being here. Pressing 
the flesh. Pumping the troops. Bringing in the firepower. It's all 
part of an effort to get votes and money. This is what traditional 
campaigning and fund-raising is all about. It's just the way it's 
done, always has been, always will. Or will it? Nowadays, the politically 
savvy are fund-raising on the Internet. I think eventually political 
campaigns and the Internet are going to be so closely linked that 
they will be really the future of political campaigns. But we're not 
there yet. Maybe not. But in California, they're getting closer. Here 
in California, 41% of the likely voters have E-mail. U.S. senator 
Barbara boxer is using the Internet hoping to find new donors. Retired 
aerospace engineer Arlen field found boxer's web site on his computer 
and said making a donation was easy. There was a very nice page to 
fill out a form and give them a credit card and push a button and 
your money is whisked off into cyberspace. The overwhelming majority 
of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial candidates across the U.S. are using 
the Internet to campaign. But only a small percentage has web sites 
specifically for donations. The Internet is cheaper than television, 
cheaper than radio, cheaper than direct mail. Donations over the web 
site this campaign year are but a drop in the bucket compared with 
the millions generated the traditional way. But here's something to 
think about. When dwight Eisenhower began using television as a campaign 
tool, few could have envisioned the power of TV in modern day politics.
