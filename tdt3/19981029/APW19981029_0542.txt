The Yugoslav army has invited tens of thousands draft dodgers to turn 
themselves in to avoid court martial, an army official was quoted 
as saying Thursday. Lt. Gen. Ratomir Ristic of the Yugoslav Army General 
Staff said young men evading their compulsory, 12-month military duty 
have until Dec. 1 to turn themselves in and join the forces. After 
that date, the army would initiate lawsuits against all dodgers, an 
army magazine Vojska quoted Ristic as saying. An estimated 200,000 
young Yugoslavs, many of them of military age, have fled for the West 
since 1991, when the country started disintegrating in a bloody civil 
war. Thousands of them have reportedly dodged the draft since February, 
when the Serbs launched a crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists 
in the troubled province of Kosovo. As the old Yugoslav federation 
began to break apart, President Slobodan Milosevic used the Yugoslav 
People's Army to intervene in the republics of Slovenia, Croatia and 
Bosnia. ``We are giving these young men a chance to correct their 
mistake and not suffer any legal repercussions,'' said Ristic. He 
said the warning was sent to draft dodgers at home and abroad. Those 
living outside of the country were advised to contact Yugoslav embassies 
and consular departments. The legal age for military service in Yugoslavia 
is between 18 and 35, although it is common practice for young men 
to join the army immediately after high school. Ristic also said the 
dodgers would have to present viable excuses for not answering the 
army's call, adding that police have carefully listed all those who 
evaded the service. ``Cowards and deserters can not hope for perpetual 
amnesty from the state,'' Ristic said.
