Gen. Augusto Pinochet was moved from a downtown clinic to a hospital 
in a secluded area of North London for security reasons Thursday. 
The 82-year-old former Chilean dictator won a high court ruling on 
Wednesday that he cannot be extradited to Spain to face charges of 
crimes against humanity because he enjoys immunity from prosecution. 
He is recovering from back surgery and remains under police guard 
pending the outcome of an appeal expected next week.
