For a place as wildly diverse as New York, the city's major commercial 
theater can often seem considerably less so. Sure, ``The Beauty Queen 
of Leenane'' is an Irish play, and ``Art'' is French. The list, and 
the world, seem pretty much to end right there. But while Broadway's 
idea of exotic fare may be a West End import, in neighborhoods throughout 
the city, smaller nonprofit theaters are serving up a feast of original 
work, seldom-seen plays and new translations from a wide variety of 
ethnic backgrounds. On any given night, an intrepid theatergoer might 
encounter a reading of new German plays, a modern romantic comedy 
performed in Yiddish or a Bengali-language production of Arthur Miller's 
``View From the Bridge.'' This weekend is no exception. Friday night, 
for example, at Repertorio Espanol, on East 27th Street in Manhattan, 
audiences can see one of the first American performances of ``She 
Looks White (Parece Blanca)'' by Aberlardo Estorino, a Cuban playwright. 
It is being performed by a company of eight Cuban actors allowed into 
the United States through an exchange program between the theater 
and the Cuban authorities. Across town Friday night, on West 22nd 
Street, the Irish Repertory Theater is offering the first preview 
of ``The Shaughraun (The Vagabond),'' a 19th-century comedy by Dion 
Boucicault advertised as involving ``swashbuckling swordplay, lots 
of kissing and a dog.'' And uptown, on Theater Row, the Intar Center 
for the Hispanic Arts just began a two-month festival of the works 
of Frederico Garcia Lorca, considered Spain's greatest playwright. 
It includes a pair of rarely produced works, ``The Shoemaker's Prodigious 
Wife,'' a 1929 farce, and ``As Five Years Pass,'' his Dali-inspired 
experiment with Surrealism. Some of the fare has a political edge. 
On Sunday, the Jewish Repertory opens its 25th season with a revival 
of ``Kuni-Leml,'' a 1984 musical based on an 1880 play about an arranged 
Hasidic marriage and a young woman's rebellion against it. And at 
the New Federal Theater, the city's oldest professional black company, 
the current production is ``The Trial of One Short-Sighted Black Woman 
vs. Mammy Louise and Safreeta Mae,'' a satire described by the playwright, 
Marcia L. Leslie, as ``what Aunt Jemima would say if she popped off 
the pancake box.'' All in all, the city is home to more than 30 so-called 
ethnic theater companies, a loose term for troupes that devote their 
efforts to producing plays from and fostering appreciation for a specific 
cultural heritage. They range from established veterans like Repertorio 
Espanol and the Irish Repertory, both with annual budgets of more 
than $1 million, to young experimental troupes like the Slant Performance 
Group, a trio of Asian-American performers whose rock-infused presentations 
include satirical show stoppers like ``Secret Asian Man,'' and ``The 
Buddha Blues.'' And unlike the Broadway and Off Broadway houses, these 
theaters span the city, from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, where troupes 
made up of recent Russian immigrants are beginning to form, to the 
Bronx, where longstanding Irish and Italian communities have their 
own local companies. Here's a look at some of the groups that add 
spice to the city's theatrical melting pot. As the home of hundreds 
of thousands of Dominicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans and other 
Latin Americans, the city has encouraged a vibrant Hispanic theater 
scene, with older companies like Intar, the Puerto Rican Traveling 
Theater and Repertorio Espanol, all founded in the late 1960s, and 
smaller new troupes. The Repertorio, started in 1968, is perhaps the 
most active ethnic theater in New York. Its resident actors sometimes 
perform as many as five different shows in a week. Next weekend, they 
will perform ``La Gringa,'' a play by Carmen Rivera, on Friday night. 
On Saturday, it's ``Yerma,'' by Garcia Lorca, and ``She Looks White,'' 
and then on Sunday, the Cuban play ``Strawberry and Chocolate.'' All 
performances are in Spanish with simultaneous English translation 
by an offstage actor. ``I came to America feeling I had a duty to 
bring to life one of the world's great bodies of work,'' said Rene 
Buch, the company's Cuban-born artistic director. He added with a 
laugh, ``And I'm still at it.'' Buch, 70, also seems intent on exporting 
the company's work; this year the troupe traveled to Havana to perform 
Eduardo Machado's ``Broken Eggs.'' The actors were the first Americans 
to appear onstage in Cuba in nearly 40 years. Meanwhile, at Intar, 
founded in 1966, Max Ferra, the artistic director, has been organizing 
an ambitious program of performances and lectures to commemorate the 
centennial of the birth of Garcia Lorca, who was killed by Franco's 
soldiers in 1936. The festival began on Wednesday and runs through 
Dec. 20. ``Everybody's always talking about Lorca, Lorca, Lorca,'' 
Ferra said. ``But it's funny: almost nobody's seen much of his work.'' 
While the Puerto Rican Traveling Company, founded in 1967, will not 
present a new show until the spring, the Pregones Theater, established 
in 1979 in the South Bronx, will present ``San Miguel, Amarra tu Perro!'' 
in late November. Then there's the Thalia Spanish Theater in Sunnyside, 
Queens, which performs in Spanish, as Repertorio does. The company's 
next production is ``The Fanlights,'' by the Puerto Rican playwright 
Rene Marques, which it will present with another Manhattan company, 
Teatro Circulo. The play, dealing with three sisters (not Chekhov's), 
opens on Nov. 7. The younger troupes include the Teatro Experimental 
Blue Amigos, which opens a trio of short plays next Friday. It will 
be performing in the basement of the Ecuadorean community Center in 
Long Island City. And on the Lower East Side, three Hispanic companies 
_ La Tea, the Milagro Theater Company and Vaso de Leche Productions 
_ perform at the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center, housed in a 
turn-of-the-century schoolhouse. Friday night you can catch two shows 
there, ``Cimarron II,'' a collection of Afro-Caribbean scenes and 
songs presented by La Tea, and ``Shophell,'' a mystery by the Puerto 
Rican playwright Jesse Mojica produced by Vaso de Leche. Like the 
Hispanic troupes, Asian-American companies include actors, writers 
and directors from a number of countries. Different performance traditions 
influence each company, from the meditative grace of Japan's Noh theater 
to the frenetic, balletic stick fighting of the Philippines. Pan Asian 
Repertory is the oldest of the companies, founded by Tisha Chang in 
1976. ``I think the Asian community was one of the last to regard 
the theater as a respectable or legitimate profession,'' Ms. Chang 
said. ``It's not so bad now, but 25 years ago it was a few very brave 
people doing this.'' Pan Asian's next show, ``Carry the Tiger to the 
Mountain,'' opens on Nov. 12. It tells the story of Vincent Chen, 
a Detroit resident beaten to death by two unemployed auto workers 
in 1982. The title comes from a move in tai-chi. Ms. Chang said the 
Chen case had special resonance in light of the recent brutal slaying 
of Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student. ``It shows, 
unfortunately, how very relevant it is,'' she said. There are also 
three young companies at work in the city: the Slant Performance Group, 
the National Asian-American Theater Company and Ma-Yi, a Filipino-American 
troupe. The National Asian-American Theater Company, which was started 
in an East Village basement, emerged in July with a well-received 
production of ``Falsettoland,'' an Asian take on William Finn's musical 
of Jewish angst. The group's next show, in February, will also be 
a revival, this time of a pair of little-performed Brecht plays. Ma-Yi, 
too, is not producing till next spring, but Slant is working on its 
new show, ``Hotel California,'' which deals with a 1977 incident in 
which hundreds of elderly Filipinos were evicted from a low-income 
residential hotel in San Francisco. The show opens on Nov. 19. The 
group, which mixes rock music, dance and comedy skits in its performance, 
was started in 1995 by Wayland Quintero, Richard Ebihara and Perry 
Yung and has since won critical praise. ``Slant must be incapable 
of dullness,'' D.J.R. Bruckner wrote in The New York Times in 1996. 
``No matter how much fun they poke at other people, they laugh at 
themselves more.'' New York has been flush with imported Irish theater, 
from Broadway's ``Beauty Queen'' and Off Broadway's ``Night in November'' 
to the agitprop vehicle ``Binlids,'' which just completed a very noisy 
run at the Angel Orensanz Foundation in the Lower East Side. But the 
city's own Irish theaters have also been active. The Irish Repertory, 
celebrating its 10th year, has settled into the theater it built on 
the site of a chemical factory on West 22nd Street. Besides ``The 
Shraughraun,'' on the main stage this week, the troupe will open ``Krapp's 
Last Tape'' by Samuel Beckett in the 60-seat basement studio. ``We 
are absolutely mad,'' said Charlotte Moore, the theater's artistic 
director. ``Beckett in the basement and farce upstairs. Can you imagine 
the crowd?'' The Irish Arts Center has also been busy, producing ``Binlids'' 
downtown and ``Moonshine,'' by Jim Nolan, which closes Saturday at 
its performance space on West 51st Street. Much lower-budget is the 
three-year-old Macalla Theater Company, formed by Irish expatriates 
in Woodlawn, the Bronx, a longtime Irish neighborhood. The group, 
which is presenting the play ``Paddywack'' through Nov. 16, makes 
its home in the basement of the Korean-American Presbyterian Church 
on a quiet residential street. While Macalla's goals are modest _ 
its mission statement includes a desire to ``break the endless cycle 
of bar hopping'' in the neighborhood _ it has touched a nerve. At 
a performance on Saturday night, the audience applauded between scenes 
and lingered long after to discuss the play, which deals with racism 
by and against the Irish. ``If you put it on at home, it's a bit old 
hat,'' said Eamonn Dornan, the group's president, who was born in 
County Down. ``But when you bring it to the Bronx, where each neighboring 
community is a different ethnic group, it hits home.'' Another Bronx 
company working in a traditional enclave is the Belmont Italian-American 
Playhouse, on Arthur Avenue in the heart of the borough's Little Italy. 
The group, founded in 1991, concentrates on modern Italian-American 
writers and classic Italian drama, including commedia dell'arte and 
works like ``La Madragola,'' by Niccolo Machiavelli. Its next show, 
``Rockaway Boulevard,'' opens on Nov. 20. ``We wanted to try to change 
some stereotypes,'' said Dante Alberti, the artistic director. ``We 
wanted to show that there's Italian characters other than just mafia 
hoods.'' When Ran Avni produced the Jewish Repertory Theater's first 
show in 1974, the reaction was, well, mixed. ``People came and said 
it's not Jewish, it's not repertory, and it's not theater,'' Avni 
said. ``Over the years, we got better.'' Today, he said, the company 
focuses on ``plays that relate to the Jewish experience,'' a wide 
mandate that allows for productions as varied as Chekhov's ``Ivanov'' 
(with its beleaguered Jewish heroine) and ``The Merchant of Venice'' 
(with its crude Jewish villain). This weekend, the Jewish Rep opens 
``Kuni-Leml,'' an English-language musical adaptation of a play by 
Abraham Goldfadn that apparently was an enormous hit in Kharkov, Russia, 
in 1880. The piece was musicalized and became a hit for the Jewish 
Rep in 1984. (Talk about a long out-of-town run.) Goldfadn was one 
of the fathers of the Yiddish theater, which had a large audience 
in the immigrant population of turn-of-the-century New York. That 
heritage has faded; the only remaining representative is the Folksbiene 
Yiddish Theater, now in its 83rd year. But even the Folksbiene is 
changing. The theater's artistic management turned over last summer, 
with Eleanor Reissa and Zalmen Mlotek taking the reins. The next production, 
``Zise Khaloymes,'' begins performances on Dec. 5, and though it is 
in Yiddish, it is a considerable departure: an original, modern musical 
with a multi-racial cast and musical help provided by Frank London 
of the hipster klezmer group the Klezmatics. The show will also have 
simultaneous English and Russian translations. Woodie King Jr., the 
founder of the New Federal Theater, remembers when the black theater 
scene was so vibrant in New York that the Black Theater Association, 
a trade group, had more than 60 dance and theater companies as members. 
``Now, it's out of business,'' he said. The scarcity of black theater 
was a hot topic during last year's much-ballyhooed debate at Town 
Hall between Robert Brustein, the artistic director of the American 
Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., and August Wilson, the playwright. 
The debate touched on everything from race-blind casting to segregation 
of black and white theater companies. But while acclaimed troupes 
like the Negro Ensemble have folded, the New Federal and several other 
black theaters remain. There's the National Black Theater in Harlem, 
where a musical based on the life of Tupac Shakur is playing, and 
the Billie Holiday Theater in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, which 
Thursday opened ``Rolling on the TOBA,'' a musical about the black 
entertainment circuit in the 1920s and 30s. Farther afield are the 
Open Cage Theater in Mount Vernon, N.Y., where the actor Denzel Washington 
cut his teeth, and the Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, N.J., 
considered the nation's foremost black theater company. The Open Cage 
has just moved into a new theater and will not stage a new show until 
the spring, but Crossroads is presenting Pearl Cleage's ``Blues For 
an Alabama Sky,'' which closes on Sunday. The company's next show, 
``It Ain't Nothing But the Blues,'' a musical revue, begins on Nov. 
18. While the Brustein-Wilson debate was generally considered a disappointment, 
King says it has had some positive effects. ``It brought attention 
from foundations to the plight of black theater,'' he said. ``They've 
opened up and are listening now. That's all we've wanted, to be heard 
and seen.'' ---------- Here is information on performances by companies
