Today's launch was not exactly picture perfect. An aluminum door panel 
fell from the shuttle's tail section a few seconds into the launch. 
But NasA says "discovery" is in no danger and the mission will proceed 
as planned. The panel appears to have impacted the right side of the 
center or number one engine nozzle. The panel appears to have come 
from the drag chute door area, although we can't confirm that it is 
the door. But the door is approximately 18" x 22" in size, and the 
video analysis of that panel continues. We do know that if that panel 
did come off, our preliminary looks show that it is no hazard to the 
operation of the vehicle on orbit.
