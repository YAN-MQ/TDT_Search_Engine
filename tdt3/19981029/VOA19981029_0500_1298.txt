And a Houston judge has approved an agreement between American Olympic 
gymnast Dominique Mosianu and her parents, making her a legal adult. 
Texas State District Judge John Montgomery approved the agreement 
which gives the 17 year old gymnast the authority to handle her own 
affairs after a brief hearing on Wednesday. Mosianu ran away from 
home last week and filed a lawsuit, accusing her parents of squandering 
most of the money she earned from the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. She 
also alleged they drove her relentlessly into sports from the age 
of three, depriving her of the opportunity to be a little girl.
