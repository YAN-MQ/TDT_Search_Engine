John Glenn's hometown is sending him off with prayer vigils, parties 
and press conferences. Jeff flock visited new Concord, Ohio, for a 
look at Glenn's legacy. It's "cea explorer," and my initials are C.E.A. 
In John Glenn's hometown, kids like Chelsea Adams still dream about 
going to the stars. I'm really interested in space and astronomy, 
and I want to be a astronaut when I grow up. They know all the history 
about John Glenn, but they know him here, too, in a way that most 
of us can't. I feel that it's a part of me going up because he is 
from new Concord, the same as I, and I've experienced the same things 
that he did when he was younger. The place he went to school, the 
sign says it's a pretty good launching pad. His old locker, number 
145, is a kind of shrine. Someone new gets to use it each week. It's 
Morgan gerlock's turn. I hope you have a good trip. They flamed the 
new high school and a stretch of the interstate for him. The college 
gym where reporters gathered 36 years ago to cover his first launch, 
that bears his name, too. He was just a plain-town boy. This man taught 
him physics. What do you think of him going back up into space again? 
Well, John is not doing that for glory. He's had enough glory. At 
the college where Glenn and his wife both attended, they are readying 
a time capsule to be buried after the Thursday launch. The most commonly 
asked question at the local grocery store every summer is where is 
the John Glenn museum? There is none. Not for long. There's an exhibit 
at the college, and she and others would like to make it a full-fledged 
museum in his old house to make the world understand how a Plain town 
boy could go so far. It's great, it's the way of the future. I just 
think it's great that he's showing that no matter what age, can you 
do what you want. It's a dream. Good luck and we wish you the best, 
John Glenn. For complete coverage of the "discovery" launch, stay 
with "CNN Headline News." We'll carry the event live, beginning with 
the 2:00 P.M. eastern time liftoff.
