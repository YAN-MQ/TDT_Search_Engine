A hijacker reportedly armed with a hand grenade commandeered a Turkish 
Airlines flight Thursday with 33 passengers and six crew members aboard. 
The pilot landed in Turkey's capital, where authorities pressed for 
release of women and children. The hijacker took over the flight demanding 
that it be diverted to Lausanne, Switzerland, Turkey's Anatolia news 
agency said. Instead, the pilot brought the Boeing 737 down at Ankara's 
airport, apparently after initially misleading the hijacker into thinking 
the crew was stopping in neighboring Bulgaria for refueling, the news 
agency said. At Ankara, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said, authorities 
promised to let the plane refuel and take off again if the hijacker 
freed the women and children on board. Even as officials talked with 
the hijacker in hopes of a peaceful resolution, authorities moved 
out security forces, sealing off the airport. NTV television said 
the government deployed about 40 assault team officers. ``Negotiations 
with the hijacker are going on,'' said Turkish Airline's Deputy Head 
Cetin Ozbey. ``We hope the issue will come to an end without any operations.'' 
NTV and Star television, both independent operations, reported conversations 
with a passenger who had a cell phone. Star quoted the passenger, 
a businessman, as saying the hijacker was a Kurdish militant who also 
had a gun. NTV quoted the passenger as saying the man was a retired 
schoolteacher who was a ``leftist revolutionary.'' The flight had 
taken off from the southern city of Adana bound for Ankara. The passengers 
were mostly Turkish doctors on their way to a medical convention, 
the Anatolia news agency said. There were no obviously foreign names 
on the passenger list released by the airline. Last week, the same 
plane was prevented from taking off from the Strasbourg airport by 
protesters trying to prevent French officials from deporting a Kurd 
to Turkey. Autonomy-seeking Kurds in Turkey's southeast have been 
fighting Turkey's military since 1984. The conflict has killed 37,000. 
Turkish Airlines has been hit by two other hijackings this year, each 
time with no real weapons and with no injuries. The latest was in 
September, when a man with a toy gun commandeered a domestic flight 
to protest government restrictions on Islam. In February, a man claiming 
to have a teddy bear packed with explosives took over a flight. Authorities 
said later he was mentally ill.
