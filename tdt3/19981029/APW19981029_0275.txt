Dominique Moceanu, her childhood now legally behind her, plans to 
meet with an accountant _ her first act as an official adult _ before 
returning to gymnastics training. ``I'll be looking into my finances,'' 
the solemn 17-year-old vowed Wednesday, minutes after state District 
Judge John D. Montgomery declared her a legal adult. The ruling came 
after her parents Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu reluctantly gave up 
a challenge to their daughter's bid for legal adulthood. Moceanu's 
father broke into tears during a 20-minute hearing before Montgomery. 
He had to be asked three times if he agreed with the settlement before 
he finally uttered a low, ``Yes,'' and signed the document. ``This 
wasn't very easy for me,'' Miss Moceanu said afterward. ``This was 
the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. It was something I felt 
I had to do.'' ``I sincerely wish you all the best of luck,'' Montgomery 
told Moceanu and her parents. ``It's not a pleasant situation to come 
down to a court like this, since the three of you probably would rather 
be just about anywhere else doing something else than standing here 
today.'' The settlement gave the 1996 gold medalist her freedom, a 
hard-won victory after months of quarreling with her parents about 
how her earnings were being spent. Moceanu's attorney, Roy W. Moore, 
said he was already setting up a meeting with an accountant. ``The 
first thing I do is put her with a family office division of a good 
accounting firm,'' he said. As for Moceanu's legal plans, everything 
is up in the air, Moore said. ``At this point, I flat don't know,'' 
he said. ``I want her to get back to training and doing what she does 
best.'' Moceanu said she no longer will live in her parents' Houston-area 
home. ``This is a great day, but a sad day,'' she said. ``I want to 
get one thing straight: I'm not living at home, I'm not going back 
home.'' Instead, she will remain at a newly rented apartment. She 
ran away from home just over a week ago. In her initial petition to 
the court, Moceanu claimed earnings in her trust fund bankrolled unauthorized 
risky investments and a dlrs 4 million gym bearing her name. It is 
not known how much was in the trust or how much has been spent. Moceanu 
now, as an adult, has the legal right to ask for an accounting of 
her fortune. But the trust is structured so even with the new adult 
declaration, it remains out of her hands until she is 35. Coincidently, 
the court handling the Moceanu case is the same one that took an identical 
request from then-underaged gymnast Mary Lou Retton. In 1985, Retton, 
then 17, asked the same 309th District Court to declare her an adult 
so she could invest earnings following her 1984 Olympic gold medal 
performance. Retton's parents _ Lois and Ronnie Retton of Fairmont, 
West Virginia _ never opposed their daughter's request, and it was 
granted without question four days after the petition was filed.
