There's some pretty hip radio stations in the United States and, of 
course, you happen to be hearing one of the hippest. But even this 
station isn't quite as far out on the edge as Paris' Radio Nova. "The 
World's" Marco Worman tunes in. What you're listening to is a song 
called "Sekei Hawk." It's a popular tune in Paris right now, but it's 
not a new tune. It's actually a song from the `70s taken from a ballet 
by a French ultra-modern choreographer, Maurice Beja. But Radio Nova, 
101.5 fm in Paris started playing it and it became all the rage in 
the city's hippest clubs. Radio Nova is one of the most popular music 
stations in Paris. Radio Nova music editor, Rami Copaculpa says the 
station doesn't follow trends, it creates them. We don't play records 
because a record company wants us to play. And we might -- we can't 
even play the music that is not -- the music selected by the record 
company. We play all kinds of grooves, a little -- we can play mixes 
from really different country than what we do a lot is putting together 
DJ and musicians and let them play live. The live performances are 
the most dramatic examples of mixing on Radio Nova, but it's also 
evident in the wacky and eclectic taste, so NOVA's Dj who in segue 
from the theme to shaft for the latest discarga dance rhythms from 
Cuba. And that keeps the music jocks at Radio Nova constantly on the 
hunt for new talent. Again, Rami Culpacupa. We played two years ago, 
a young guy from Colombia and living in Paris, called Yuri Vonaventura, 
that recorded his first album in Colombia and he recorded -- of the 
famous Belgian singer that --. And now it's in the top 50 and it sold 
more than 100,00 copies only in French. This was kind of a musical 
blues or depression that turned to be the music of dance and of pleasure 
and of smite. And so a Colombian recorded a sad French song about 
a lover being left and a Paris radio station took his song and played 
it and that made at least a few people in Paris smile. For "The World," 
this is Marco Worman. Uri Benaventura is reworking with Nimaketai 
Puf and Sasha today. In Boston, I'm Lisa Mullens. Join us any time 
on line at www.theworld.org. We'll be back tomorrow with another spin 
of "The World."
