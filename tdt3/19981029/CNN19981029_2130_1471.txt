A Massachusetts woman is being hailed for her honesty tonight, after 
an automatic teller she was using went haywire. The machine starting 
spitting out money, 4,500 worth in $10 and $20 bills. But police say 
26-year-old Laurie glass resisted temptation to stuff her purse. Instead, 
she waited for officers to arrive. When they did, they found her standing 
in a pile of greenbacks. Her bank card was stuck in the machine.
