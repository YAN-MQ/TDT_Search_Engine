I'm Bill Hazard, VOA News. An explosion has rocked the Gaza Strip, 
killing at least two people, injuring six others, including three 
schoolchildren. Israeli police say a car bomb exploded near a school 
bus and an Israeli Army vehicle which was escorting the bus. The explosion 
took place at the Ketif intersection in Southern Gaza. Israeli Radio 
called the incident a terrorist attack. It played what it said was 
a recording of a phone conversation in which the Islamic Resistance 
Movement, Hamas, claimed responsibility for the car bombing. VOA's 
Al Pessin has the story. The school bus had just left an Israeli settlement 
in Gaza and passed through an intersection where Israeli and Palestinian 
traffic cross each other. The bus was specially reinforced to be bullet 
proof and was under escort by Israeli Army jeeps. One of the Jeeps 
crashed and burned after the explosion, apparently caused by a car 
bomb. The bus driver reported by mobile phone, "All of the children 
are safe." A spokesman for Hamas phoned Israeli Radio. The caller 
said Hamas had carried out what he called a great operation to teach 
the settlers a lesson and he vowed that what he called the revolution 
will continue until victory. The attack came less than a week after 
the latest Israeli/Palestinian peace accord was signed at the White 
House. Al Pessin, VOA News, Jerusalem.
