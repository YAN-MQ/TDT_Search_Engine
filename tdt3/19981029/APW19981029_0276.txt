A Chinese man was fatally stabbed during a street brawl involving 
40 Chinese nationals, police said Thursday. Armed with swords, axes 
and knives, Chinese nationals brawled Tuesday afternoon in eastern 
Bucharest where they have wholesale business interests, said Cpt. 
Ovidiu Draghici. The fight was prompted when a partner in a business 
group was said to be angered that one of his partners was underselling 
him and collecting protection money from other wholesalers. The dead 
man was identified Wang Xinguo, 31. It was not known if he had any 
connection to the origin of the fight. Four men in their 30s are being 
treated for stab wounds at Bucharest's Emergency Hospital. Since 1989 
when communism ended, tens of thousands of Chinese have moved to Romania. 
Most are employed in the wholesale business, importing cheap Chinese 
clothes. There are occasional killings between rival gangs which have 
shocked Romanians. Police are investigating the killing and have named 
a suspect, a leader of Chinese business interests. Nobody has been 
arrested.
