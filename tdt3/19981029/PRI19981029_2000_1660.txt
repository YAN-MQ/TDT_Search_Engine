You're listening to "The World." Don't forget you can join us anytime 
on-line at www.theworld.org. This is PRI, Public Radio International. 
I'm Lisa Mullens. Still to come on "The World," British police track 
down the murderer of a school girl. The man who committed the offense 
bit her. And we were able to swab saliva from the bite mark and get 
a DNA profile from that. DNA that put the man behind bars. We'll have 
the story later on "The World." First, this news.
