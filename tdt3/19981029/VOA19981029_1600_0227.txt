A special UN envoy dealing with religious freedom has expressed regret 
that Vietnamese authorities hindered his attempts to meet with religious 
groups during a 10 day visit to the country. VOA correspondent Gary 
Thomas has more. In a written statement, Ablafata Amor, the UN special 
and religious intolerance expressed regret that he was granted only 
limited access to various religious groups in Vietnam. In diplomatic 
language, Mr. Amor chastised his hosts saying his mandate calls for 
the freedom to move at will and meet anyone without restrictions or 
repercussions. He expressed regret that he was not allowed to meet 
with representatives of several religious groups, including the Taoist, 
Hindu, Confucian and Haro-Haro communities. Mr. Amor applied to visit 
Vietnam three years ago and the government finally granted him permission 
in July. The United Nations made complete freedom of access a condition 
of the visit. But Mr. Amor ran into roadblocks during the course of 
his visit. The Vietnamese government issued a statement earlier this 
week denying Mr. Amor's activities were restricted. Gary Thomas, VOA 
News, Bangkok.
