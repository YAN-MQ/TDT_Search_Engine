A Singapore company has developed a full-fledged computer designed 
to fit in a car's dashboard, a newspaper reported Thursday. The computer 
runs Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system and includes features 
normally found in desktop computers, such as a large capacity disk 
drive, a modem for e-mail and Internet access, and CD-ROM and floppy 
disk drives, The Straits Times reported. Singapore's GPS Technologies 
originally developed the Searcher1 as a navigation system, but it 
evolved into what is believed to be the world's first full-fledged 
car computer, the paper added. Operated with either a touch-sensitive 
screen, an infrared wireless keyboard or by voice commands, the car 
computer also supports extra screens placed in the back seat, and 
may be marketed to busy executives or outfitted in luxury cars. Developed 
at a cost of 600,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 370,000), it will sell 
for about 5,600 Singapore dollars (dlrs 3,500), plus 800 to 1,000 
Singapore dollars (dlrs 500 to 620) for each additional screen, the 
paper said. Several automakers have expressed interest in fitting 
the computer into their luxury cars, the report said, but it did not 
identify these manufacturers. The company also is considering selling 
the computer in traffic-clogged Southeast Asian cities like Bangkok 
and Kuala Lumpur, where drivers or passengers could take advantage 
of time lost in gridlock.
