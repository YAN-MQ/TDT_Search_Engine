Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov flew Thursday to the Caucasus Mountains 
of southern Russia where he met with the leaders of several restive 
regions, including secessionist Chechnya. Primakov arrived in Vladikavkaz, 
capital of North Ossetia, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. ITAR-Tass 
said he met the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia and discussed 
a permanent settlement to 1992 fighting between ethnic Ingush and 
Ossetians. Primakov said he hoped his presence would help ease turmoil 
in the troubled region. The trip ``offers a real chance to stabilize 
the socio-political and economic situation in the region, to promote 
cooperation between the federal authorities and leaders of the region,'' 
Primakov said, according to ITAR-Tass. The Interfax news agency said 
Primakov also met with Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who wants 
Russia to help repair damage caused during their 1994-96 war. Maskhadov's 
press secretary, Mairbek Vachagayev, said they would also discuss 
hostage-takings and other crimes, which have been rampant in Chechnya 
since the end of the war. Chechen law enforcement officials are in 
the midst of a crackdown on hostage-takings. More than 100 people, 
including five foreigners, are believed to be held. Police raided 
two criminal groups Thursday morning, releasing five hostages and 
arresting 14 people, said Chechen Security Minister Aslanbek Arsayev, 
according to Interfax. The five released hostages were an Armenian, 
a Cherkessian and three Chechens. Law enforcement officials from North 
Ossetia also freed an additional three men who had been held for more 
than eight months in Chechnya on Wednesday night, ITAR-Tass said. 
The men were from Ukraine, North Ossetia, and Azerbaijan. Despite 
the releases, about 2,000 heavily armed soldiers gathered at a rally 
in the Chechen capital of Grozny on Thursday, and again called that 
Maskhadov face trial for alleged violations of the constitution. Participants 
at the rally, which was led by former rebel leader Shamil Basayev, 
also criticized Maskhadov for meeting with Primakov. Chechnya has 
been running its own affairs since the end of the war, but no country 
has recognized its independence claim. Moscow insists the territory 
remains part of Russia.
