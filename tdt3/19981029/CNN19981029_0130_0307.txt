Forecasters expect hurricane Mitch to touch land Thursday on the northern 
coast of Belize. At last report, the center of the storm was located 
about 25 miles off the north coast of Honduras, with winds of about 
100 miles an hour. Forecasters say it should remain stationary overnight. 
Mexico has declared a hurricane alert throughout the Yucatan peninsula, 
forcing thousands of residents and tourists to evacuate. Mitch has 
been pounding Honduras and other central American countries with up 
to 25 inches of rain and is responsible for at least 32 deaths.
