The White House and democrats aren't standing idly by as republicans 
broadcast the new commercials. Wolf Blitzer reports on the democrats' 
"rebuttal." President Clinton was prepared with a quick response to 
the latest republican ads asking whether he can be trusted. I hope 
the American people have seen in me over these last few weeks a real 
commitment to doing what I told them I would do from the beginning. 
To try to atone to them for what happened and to try to redouble my 
efforts to be a good president. At a news conference with Colombia's 
president andres pastrana, mr. Clinton was peppered with questions 
about those ads, including what parents should tell their children 
about his relationship with Monica lewinsky. I think people should 
say this to their children -- when someone makes a Mistake, they should 
admit it and try to rectify it. Earlier, vice President Al Gore lashed 
out at the republicans, accusing them of being desperate. Attacking 
the president and investigating the president has apparently become 
an obsession with the republicans. That's what they want to do instead 
of talking about the issues. Still, some presidential aides privately 
concede the republican ads may succeed in energizing the conservative 
republican base to go out and vote. That is the question of this election. 
Reward Bill Clinton or vote republican. Democrats are preparing their 
own ad in response. It's clear that the republican party has finally 
put their cards on the table. In the last few days of this election, 
they have admitted they do not have an agenda. But what worries the 
democrats a lot more than the latest batch of ads is this -- the sheer 
amount of money the republicans are pumping into various campaigns 
during these final days before the election. Republicans have raised 
a lot more money than the democrats. Repeatedly, one hears the same 
refrain from democrats -- "too bad the elections aren't today, before 
all those republican millions will be spent." Wolf Blitzer, CNN, the 
White House.
