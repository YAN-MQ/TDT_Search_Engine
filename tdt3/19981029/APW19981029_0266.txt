Government tanks rolled along a Kosovo highway Thursday, while U.S. 
and European envoys urged ethnic Albanian rebels not to take over 
checkpoints vacated by police and to begin talks as soon as possible. 
At least 15 tanks and five other vehicles were seen heading north 
of here, perhaps toward a military base as part of the on-going redeployment 
of government forces demanded by NATO and the U.N. Security Council. 
An agreement reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke required 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to remove or redeploy forces 
in Kosovo, which were increased dramatically after he launched a crackdown 
on ethnic Albanian separatists Feb. 28. As the redployment of forces 
continues, rebels of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army have been 
milling around positions vacated by Serb police and Yugoslav troops. 
Scores of uniformed KLA guerrillas marched in formation at a funeral 
Wednesday for a KLA fighter at Dragobilje, some 40 kilometers (25 
miles) southwest of Pristina. That was unthinkable three days earlier, 
when Serb police manned a checkpoint on the road to Dragobilje. U.S. 
and European diplomats are concerned that any KLA efforts to exploit 
the Serb draw-down might complicate efforts to bring Milosevic and 
the ethnic Albanians to the conference table to negotiate the longterm 
future of the province, part of Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia. 
Special U.S. mediator Christopher Hill urged the rebels Wednesday 
not to increase tensions by taking over former Serb checkpoints and 
bunkers. Hill told reporters that the Americans and Europeans are 
insisting that the KLA not try to exploit the situation created by 
the departure of virtually all the special police and troops sent 
to Kosovo after Milosevic launched his crackdown on the rebels Feb. 
28. ``It is our strong view that the KLA should not try to take advantage 
of the reconfiguration, the withdrawal of Serbian forces,'' Hill said. 
``We are looking for this withdrawal to contribute to stability, to 
contribute to the peacefulness out there and to facilitate the return 
of people to their villages. And we're very pleased that the return 
of people to their villages will accelerate.'' Reinforcing that demand, 
the special European Community envoy for Kosovo, Wolfgang Petritsch, 
urged the Kosovo Albanians to begin a ``constructive dialogue'' with 
Milosevic on self-rule for the majority Albanian province, which is 
part of Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia. ``It is true they have 
moved into some of the positions,'' Petritsch said of the rebels. 
``Fortunately there were no fights going on because the Serb security 
forces at least Wednesday were acting in a responsible way and we 
can only appeal to the Albanians to do the same. Otherwise new problems 
will be built up and that will definitely not help the international 
mission here in Kosovo.'' Petritsch said it was of ``particular importance'' 
for the Kosovo Albanians to take advantage of this ``historical moment'' 
to resolve the crisis. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 
2 million people. Most want independence. The Americans and Europeans, 
however, do not support independence, fearing it would lead to similar 
demands by ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in the southern Balkans. 
``It's the position of the United States that we do not support Kosovo's 
independence,'' Hill said. ``We do not feel that this would be a stabilizing 
factor in the region.'' With Yugoslav forces drawing back, NATO has 
announced plans to begin spy flights over Kosovo this weekend to make 
sure Milosevic is sticking by the agreement. The Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe also hopes that most of the 2,000 
people which it will send to the province to verify the agreement 
will be in Kosovo in the next few weeks. That should enable most of 
the thousands of refugees still camped in the hills to return home 
and avoid the humanitarian disaster which had been widely predicted 
before the Milosevic-Holbrooke deal.
