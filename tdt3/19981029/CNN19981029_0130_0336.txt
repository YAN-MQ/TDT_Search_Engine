Word of a bomb in the Gaza strip. At least one person was killed. 
There are reports of injuries. Meanwhile, President Clinton said Israeli 
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to be sure the Palestinians 
stick to their promise to fight terrorism before withdrawing troops 
from the West Bank. The land-for-peace deal is expected to go into
