It was the first taste of a voyage to space for dozens of students 
at Public School 87 on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where two 
fifth-grade classes and a first-grade class gathered in front of a 
television Thursday to watch John Glenn blast into space for the second 
time. There was some fidgeting as the kids _ who didn't get quite 
the same charge out of Walter Cronkite that adults of a certain age 
do _ waited for the anchors to stop talking and the countdown to begin. 
``Let's just pretend it's a Yankees game,'' one boy remarked. Across 
the New York area Thursday, students took a break from their computer 
screens and books to catch a glimpse of Glenn's second launch into 
space. Of course, in this age of technology, there was nowhere near 
the excitement of 36 years ago when Glenn first took off. In fact, 
few schools took special notice of the occasion, except for a handful 
driven by teachers and administrators who were there the first time 
around. ``I was a college student at the time,'' said Harvey Sherer, 
principal of Public School 102 in Elmhurst, Queens. ``I was 20 years 
old. I absolutely remember John Glenn orbiting the earth and Walter 
Cronkite reporting on it. I even remember that I was sitting in a 
student lounge at City College.'' Sherer, whose school was recently 
awarded the John Glenn Award by the American Association of School 
Administrators for being a leader in technology, said students gathered 
in the auditorium to watch the launch. ``Today's launch serves as 
an inspiration in and of itself because they've been studying and 
writing letters to him,'' Sherer said. ``This makes it even larger. 
It motivates them them to learn about flight and to see a 77-year-old 
former astronaut go again makes them look at their own grandparents 
in a different way.'' Speaking of grandparents, Samuel Haile, a fifth-grade 
student at Public School 87, knew Glenn was old. But how old? ``Like, 
he's sort of like a little bit older than Bill Clinton,'' Samuel said. 
``When he was younger, it was probably easier for him. But he's gonna 
survive.'' Dangling from the ceiling of the classroom where the students 
were gathered at were personal history mobiles made of magazine clippings 
and drawings that spoke to the preoccupations of youth today _ Beastie 
Boys, Michael Jordan, baseball and aliens, but no astronauts. Steven 
Plaut, the principal, turned the sound off on the television as the 
children waited for the launch and tried to calm them with a little 
history lesson. He talked about how he himself had watched the first 
moon launch, on a black and white TV. He evoked Sputnik and the race 
for space. ``There was a president of the U.S. who really made a commitment 
to the country that before the end of the 20th century, we were going 
to have a man on the moon,'' he said. ``Does anybody know who that 
was?'' ``Kennedy,'' a boy cried out. Evoking Columbus, he then asked 
about the first explorer on the moon. ``Neil Armstrong,'' a girl replied. 
As the digital clock on the TV screen ticked off 50 seconds, a teacher 
restored the sound. ``Shhhh'' filled the room as the final countdown 
began. Carried away by the suspense of it all, the children began 
shouting out the waning seconds, drowning the voice on screen. As 
the shuttle lifted off, they cheered and pumped their fists. It could, 
after all, have been a Yankees game. ``I want to learn more about 
John Glenn,'' Samuel said, when it was over. ``He's brave.''
