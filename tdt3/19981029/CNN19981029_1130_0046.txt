"CNN Headline News," good morning, I'm Denise Dillon in today for 
Catherine callaway. Final preparations are being made for the launch 
of the space shuttle "Discovery" in about 2 1/2 hours. The mission 
will see John Glenn's return to space 36 years after his first orbital 
flight. Glenn was alone on that mission. This time, the 77-year-old 
astronaut will be accompanied by six crew members. As you can see, 
these are live pictures we're showing you. The astronauts are being 
strapped in right now. John Glenn will be strapped into the middeck 
of the shuttle. 300,000 people are crowding Florida's space coast 
for a glimpse of the liftoff, story musgrave says Glenn's return to 
space is indeed historic. It runs deeper than public relations, deeper 
than science. It is the deja vu between 4 1/2 hours 36 years ago and 
now. It's that, I'm back in zero G. senator John Glenn, it's Mercury 
hero John glenn. That's why everyone is to interested.
