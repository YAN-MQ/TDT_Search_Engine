Israel is demanding a crackdown on terrorist elements by Palestinian 
President Yasser Arafat. It comes after a suicide bomber drove into 
a Jeep this morning, killing an israeli soldier escorting a busload 
of school children in the Gaza strip. Arafat has spoken to Israeli 
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Arafat denounced the attack. Both 
parties have indicated they would not pull back from the new interim 
peace deal. But Netanyahu has come under increased pressure from Israeli 
hard-liners to call it off.
