The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews 
conducted Monday through Wednesday with 1,118 adults throughout the 
United States. Of these, 942 said they were registered to vote. The 
sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer 
from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges 
across the country. Within each exchange, random digits were added 
to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both 
listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was 
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. 
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and 
number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations 
in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education. 
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples 
will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction 
from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. 
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For 
example, for 572 ``likely voters'' it is plus or minus four percentage 
points. For 400 ``more likely voters'' it is plus or minus five. Registered 
voters were categorized as likely (or more likely) according to their 
stated intention to vote next week, their expressed interest in the 
campaign, and their reported voting behavior in past elections. In 
addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting 
any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error 
into the poll. Variations in wording of questions or in the order 
of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.
