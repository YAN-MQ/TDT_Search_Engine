As President Boris Yeltsin prepares to fly to a Black Sea resort on 
Friday on an extended sick leave, a Kremlin spokesman said Thursday 
that he would soon appoint a panel of legal experts to review changes 
to the Russian Constitution, including the creation of a post for 
a vice president and successor. Yeltsin, 67, has already stepped back 
from the day-to-day business of running the country _ a fact officially 
confirmed this week by the Kremlin after his latest bout of ``nervous 
exhaustion.'' Now, according to his chief spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, 
he will have the time ``to plan other things,'' in particular his 
handover of power in 2000, when his term ends. Comparing Yeltsin to 
a long-distance runner on his last lap, Yakushkin said the constitutional 
review was only indirectly related to his health. ``The only connection 
is that Yeltsin does not get any younger with each year, and a minor 
cold, given his health, has much more serious consequences,'' he said. 
A team of doctors ruled Thursday that Yeltsin, who has spent the last 
two days at a medical center outside Moscow, is fit to fly on Friday 
to Sochi, a Russian resort where he will spend a two-week vacation, 
the Kremlin announced Thursday night. According to Yakushkin, the 
legal panel, made up of about 10 lawyers to be named next month, will 
sort through proposed constitutional amendments that have been floated 
publicly as opposition leaders press to reduce Yeltsin's political 
powers, and even oust him. According to a poll made public on Thursday 
by the Public Opinion foundation, a polling group, 75 percent of 1,500 
Russians questioned said they would favor Yeltsin's impeachment, a 
process that has already begun in Parliament, even though its chances 
of being completed are very slight. Yakushkin said Yeltsin _ whose 
final approval is needed for constitutional amendments _ would not 
consider any changes that would diminish the considerable powers of 
the presidency, or cede its authority to a parliamentary majority. 
``Nothing will be approved that makes the system of power more fragile,'' 
Yakushkin said in an interview, ``only that which will strengthen 
it.'' But he said the issue of a vice presidency _ a post stricken 
from the 1993 Constitution after Yeltsin's last vice president tried 
to lead a mutiny against him _ will be on the agenda, answering a 
surge of questions that have been raised about the current line of 
succession. The proposed council will review this and other proposals, 
and submit its own recommendations, Yakushkin said. The timing, he 
said, will depend on ``the intensity of the public discussion.'' Under 
the current Constitution, in the event of the death or disability 
of a president, the job passes to the prime minister, who then must 
hold special elections within three months. A vice president _ if 
a provision to create the job were inserted into the Constitution 
_ would succeed a president until the end of the regular four-year 
term. Changing the Constitution is an arduous business, involving 
the approval of three-fourths of Parliament's upper house, and two-thirds 
of its lower house. A constitutional assembly can also be called. 
A top Kremlin aide, Oleg Sysuyev, told a Russian newspaper this week 
that Yeltsin would favor such a gathering, but not if it is made up 
of current members of Parliament's Communist-dominated lower house, 
as his opposition has proposed. Given the intensity of Russia's political 
debate and the urgency of its economic crisis, some analysts say they 
doubt that there will be time for such a leisurely procedure. Instead, 
they suggest that a proposal for constitutional revision will amount, 
in fact, to an opening for political negotiations over Yeltsin's succession 
_ either before his terms ends or after. Few political analysts expect 
that the president will retire early, except for reasons of health. 
``The issue is not the law _ it rarely is in Russia,'' said Otto Latsis, 
a political analyst for the newspaper New Izvestia. ``It is about 
specific people.'' As Yeltsin's health has wavered from bad to worse 
in recent weeks, the political jockeying to succeed him has stepped 
up, with top contenders, like Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, joining 
the chorus calling on him to resign. But except perhaps for Luzhkov, 
early presidential elections, in Russia's current condition, are seen 
as a risk by many political leaders who have instead chosen to consolidate 
their support for Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov as Russia's surrogate 
president. Primakov, who took Yeltsin's place this week at a European 
Union summit meeting in Austria after doctors ordered the president 
to stay home, has already assumed many presidential functions, and 
is expected to continue to substitute for Yeltsin abroad. In interviews 
this week, Sysuyev said the president would no longer be as involved 
as he once was in the daily operation of government. The president, 
Sysuyev told a television interviewer on Monday, will no longer demand 
to know ``about every ruble of wage arrears.'' Instead, Yeltsin's 
main function will be to serve as the guarantor of Russia's integrity, 
and of the freedoms of its citizens. ``Maybe this two-week vacation 
will help the president to think about the newly formed situation,'' 
he said. Yakushkin said Thursday that the president can now distance 
himself from government, because for the first time in his seven years 
in office, he has a prime minister who enjoys the support of a majority 
in Parliament's cantankerous lower house. ``In this situation, and 
given the experience of the years behind him, there will not be any 
intrusion, not only in technical details but in day-to-day economic 
decision,'' Yakushkin said. ``He won't intrude in any way, which was 
not the case before. According to his spokesman, the public pressure 
on Yeltsin has taken its toll. ``He is very tired, and it can be felt,'' 
Yakushkin said. ``There is some emotional stress, coming from all 
directions, what he reads in the press, the attacks against him.''
