The Russian government has ``resolutely opted'' to take more control 
over the economy to pull it out of its worst crisis since the Soviet 
collapse, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Thursday. Primakov 
was commenting on the government's long-awaited plan for coping with 
the crisis, which was presented to the International Monetary Fund 
on Wednesday. The government hoped the plan would persuade the IMF 
to release another installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan frozen 
after the Russian economy fell apart in mid-August. The IMF said it 
wanted to study the plan, Russian media reported. Visiting IMF officials 
were scheduled to leave Moscow on Thursday, the Interfax news agency 
said. ``They realized that the situation in Russia is very difficult, 
but not hopeless,'' Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin told the Interfax 
news agency. The plan calls for tighter currency controls, price controls 
on medicines and some basic foods, a food reserve to help the country 
through the winter and indexing wages and pensions to compensate Russians 
for rising inflation. It tackles the tax system, lowering some income, 
property and profit tax rates but tightening the rules in hopes of 
making more people pay. The government's chronic inability to collect 
taxes has left it consistently short on cash and helped contribute 
to the current crisis. Primakov said Thursday the government also 
wanted to restore ``order and discipline'' in contracts, an apparent 
reference to loopholes in export-import regulations that allow money 
to be illegally sent abroad. Russian companies are believed to have 
stashed billions of dollars overseas. ``The state must (also) determine 
the parameters and trends in industrial restructuring,'' Primakov 
said in the southern Russian city of Vladikavkaz, where he was holding 
talks with leaders of restive regions in the Caucasus Mountains. He 
did not elaborate, but was presumably referring to a renewed emphasis 
on Russia's manufacturing sector, particularly the huge military-industrial 
complex. Western analysts have long urged many of those companies 
be closed or converted to other uses because, while they employ many 
people, there is no market for their goods and they are unprofitable. 
Meanwhile, Agriculture and Food Minister Viktor Semyonov rejected 
speculation that Russia may face food shortages this winter, but warned 
that in food prices may become too high in some regions for the low-income 
people. He also called for greater state control over agricultural 
markets to ensure deliveries of inexpensive food to troubled regions. 
Vyugin, the deputy finance minister, said the main emphasis of the 
talks with the IMF was on the budget for the last three months of 
this year and for 1999. ``The IMF insists that the budget for the 
fourth quarter be made very rigorous,'' he said. Meanwhile, Central 
Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko reiterated his opposition to any 
limits on the circulation of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies 
in Russia. Russian media had previously reported that was to have 
been part of the plan to cope with the crisis, on the grounds that 
it would strengthen the ruble. ``The dollar must not be banned,'' 
Gerashchenko said. ``It's impossible.'' The Central Bank announced 
Thursday it had revoked the license of Inkombank, which had been one 
of the country's biggest retail banks, because it was practically 
insolvent. The Central Bank also said that its gold and foreign currency 
reserves rose by dlrs 200 million in the fourth week of October to 
dlrs 13.3 billion.
