The New York Times said in an editorial Friday, Oct. 30: Because Brazil 
is the largest economy in Latin America, its success or failure will 
always be important to its hemispheric neighbors. But seldom has its 
fate seemed as significant as now, when the world fears that the financial 
crisis that began in Asia will spread to the Americas. The world, 
through the International Monetary Fund, should provide aid to Brezil, 
but only if the country first takes needed steps to get its own fiscal 
house in order. The reforms proposed by its newly re-elected president, 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, are long overdue and vitally necessary. 
But Cardoso may have a difficult time getting them adopted by the 
Congress and the state governments, and they will not bring an early 
economic recovery. The reforms provide for raising some taxes and 
getting a rein on the country's pension system, which has benefited 
government employees and pensioners at the expense of the rest of 
the country. The failure to make reforms has led to large budget deficits 
that cannot be sustained. There may be room for modifying the president's 
plan, but if Brazil's politicians fail to pass something similar to 
it, they will do their country a disservice. This is, at best, an 
awkward time for Brazil to be facing fiscal stringency. Its economy 
has already been weakened by extraordinarily high interest rates that 
were imposed to protect its overvalued currency, the real, and this 
package will allow interest rates to be lowered only gradually. The 
country would be far better off had Cardoso been able to push through 
such reforms earlier. The government insists that a devaluation of 
the real will not be considered, and it is easy to understand why. 
Cardoso's reputation is based on controlling inflation, which was 
done by linking the real to the dollar in a way that allows it to 
lose no more than about 7 percent of its value each year. A devaluation 
would not only provide a boost to inflation, but would risk destroying 
faith in the currency. Even so, everyone now knows the real is overvalued, 
and that has led to capital flight. A devaluation may become necessary. 
If so, it will need to be handled adroitly to minimize the damage 
done to the government's credibility and to persuade Brazilians that 
the move will improve economic prospects, not trigger a return to 
hyperinflation.
