American Major league baseball plans to ban the use of androstenedione, 
the muscle-building dietary supplement used by home run champion Mark 
McGwire, the Toronto Globe and Mail reported today. The newspaper 
cited unidentified sources, who said they expect commissioner Bud 
Selig to formally announce a ban before spring training next season. 
Selig denied the report, saying he hadn't begun to consider the issue. 
``Together with the union, we've got the leading experts in this country 
studying this,'' Selig said Thursday. ``It's not only very premature, 
but very unfair. None of this should ever diminish from Mark McGwire's 
extraordinary season.'' Selig and union head Donald Fehr agreed Aug. 
27 to appoint a committee of doctors to study andro. The doctors aren't 
expected to report back for 6-to-10 weeks. ``All the players will 
know where we stand on andro once a decision is made,'' Fehr was quoted 
as saying by the paper. ``Right now, the doctors are simply investigating.'' 
McGwire, who could not be reached for comment, hit 70 homers this 
year, breaking the record of 61 set by Roger Maris in 1961. ``I would 
hate to be in McGwire's shoes right now,'' said Dr. William Bryan, 
team physician for the Houston Astros and the past president of the 
Association of Professional Team Physicians. ``We have just been shaking 
our heads all this time that androstenedione was on the shelves.'' 
Androstenedione is illegal in Canada but legal in the United States. 
It is banned by the NFL, NCAA and the Olympics but allowed by baseball. 
In Johnson City, Tennessee, researchers at East Tennessee State are 
studying the supplement. Dr. Craig Broeder, exercise physiologist 
at the school's Human Performance Lab, said they will study androstenedione's 
physical and psychological effect on men between the ages of 35 and 
65. ``The main reason for the study is about health issues and anti-aging,'' 
he said. The study's 70 participants will undergo medical tests as 
they engage in weight training for 12 weeks. The dlrs 28,000 study 
is being funded by ChemSource, a company that researches supplements 
and other products, and Metabolic Response Modifiers, which produces 
supplements. Broeder said he hopes to find that andro can boost men's 
testosterone at an age when it begins to drop. Such a drop creates 
a greater risk of heart and circulatory problems.
