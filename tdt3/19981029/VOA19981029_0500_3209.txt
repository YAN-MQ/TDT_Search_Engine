Nearly 40 years ago, in 1956, Johnny Mathis was an aspiring track 
and field star, said to become a member of the U.S. Olympic team. 
At the same time, Columbia Records executives discovered him singing 
at a San Francisco nightclub and the rest, as they say, is history. 
VOA's Mary Morningstar reports. Johnny Mathis pays tribute to songwriter 
Diane Warren with his latest album, Because You Loved Me. Mathis chose 
ten of Warren's hit songs for the CD which features tunes made famous 
by Celine Dion, Gloria Estafan, Michael Bolton, Toni Braxton and others. 
Diane Warren is a three time Academy Award nominee and three time 
winner of ASCAP's songwriter of the year honor. She's also the first 
songwriter to have had seven hits by seven different artists on billboard's 
hot 100 charts simultaneously. Johnny Mathis explains why he chose 
to record the collection of Warren's songs. She is extraordinary. 
She is -- she is one of the phenomenons of the business. You're very 
fortunate in this business if you have one hit. I've been so fortunate 
over the years that people recognize me singing songs like Maria and 
Chances Are and Talks of Never and a few other and Diane is just -- 
she's had so many hit records and everybody knows the songs but they 
-- they're not quite sure -- Included on the new album from Johnny 
Mathis are such well known songs as Unbreak My Heart, a number one 
single for Toni Braxton in 1996; Love Will Lead You Back, a 1990 chart 
topper for Taylor Dayne; Set the Night to Music, a top ten hit for 
Roberta Flack and Maxi Priest in 1991; and If You Ask Me To which 
Celine Dion took to number one in 1992. Mathis scored his first number 
one single on the pop charts in 1957 with Chances Are. The following 
year he became the first artist in recording history to earn enough 
hits to compile a Greatest Hits Anthology. That compilation spent 
more than nine years on billboard's pop albums chart. Over the past 
four decades, Mathis has recorded nearly 100 albums and during that 
time has performed throughout North America, South America, Europe, 
Australia and East Asia. He's promoting his new album of cover songs 
with a U.S. concert tour, scheduled to run through mid-1999. From 
Because You Love Me, the songs of Diane Warren, Johnny Mathis sings 
his rendition of Gloria Estafan's 1991 hit, Live for Loving You. I'm
