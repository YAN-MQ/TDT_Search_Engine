Tiger Woods, putting better and taking advantage of his friend Mark 
O'Meara's cold putter, grabbed a three-hole lead after the first 18 
of 36 in Sunday's World Match Play final. Woods shot 4-under 31 on 
the front nine and had a quick four-hole lead with birdies on four 
of the opening six holes _ which included a 35-footer (12 meters) 
at No. 3. O'Meara cut the lead to three after 11 with an 18-inch putt 
(half meter) for birdie, a putt his friend good naturedly refused 
to concede. ``You'll give me this hole, won't you?'' O'Meara shouted 
across the green. Woods looked sheepishly away and O'Meara replied, 
``I'm gonna remember that next week.'' O'Meara _ this year's Masters 
and British Open champion _ dropped the putt. Then, playing to a gallery 
evenly divided in their loyalty, he measured it with his putter shaft 
_ not once but twice to roaring applause. Unlike earlier matches when 
a British player faced the Americans, this time crowd at the Wentworth 
Club south of London just took in the perfect fall day and the sight 
of two players who have been linked together all season and the game's 
No. 1 story. Woods, the world's top-ranked player, went back up by 
four on 16 with another birdie from two feet (half meter) with a perfect 
wedge to the green. But he conceded 17 when he hit a fairway wood 
into an unplayable lie in a thick of trees. O'Meara was just off the 
fringe in two and was bound to make at least par. O'Meara had chances 
with at least five putts of 20 feet (6 meters) or fewer but missed 
them all. Woods made more of his chances and was consistent in lagging 
long putts close to make birdies or save par. A chance to go four 
up on the 18th got away when he missed from 10 feet (3 meters). ``I 
just didn't play very well and Tiger played better,'' said O'Meara 
coming off 18. The two Florida neighbors reached the finals of the 
170,000-pound tournament Saturday when Woods beat Lee Westwood 5 and 
4 and O'Meara crushed defending champion _ and U.S. PGA champion Vijay 
Singh _ by a record 11 and 10. It's the first all-U.S. final since 
1975 when Hale Irwin beat Al Geiberger and only the fourth in the 
tournament's 34-year history. ``This is definitely a great final,'' 
Woods said Saturday. ``No doubt about it. It will be fun playing against 
one of my best friends, someone I consider like an older brother, 
I'll be happy if he wins and he'll be happy if I win.'' Woods said 
they've never played together in the final of a match-play event or 
as the last twosome on the final day of a stroke-play tournament. 
``Playing head-to-head, we don't get that chance very often where 
we're in the same tournament and just happen to play well at the same 
time.'' O'Meara, who broke the old tournament record set in 1978 when 
Tom Watson beat Dale Hayes 11 and 9, suggested it'll just be another 
round of golf with Tiger _ but for more cash. ``We play a lot together,'' 
O'Meara said. ``He (Woods) has been playing pretty well at home. I 
think he took 30 bucks off me the last time we played.'' ``I'm pretty 
smart,'' he went on. ``I'm no idiot. I go to the putting green afterwards 
and try to go nine, double-or-nothing. I can usually win my money 
back on the putting green.''
