These days, seems like everybody's got a Cherokee or an explorer. 
me? I like to stand out a bit. That's why I drive a Subaru outback. 
With a big cargo bay and all-wheel drive, you get all the sport-utility 
you need. With a smooth ride and better gas mileage, the outback is 
far from ordinary. Like me, really. What a weird looking bunch that 
was.
