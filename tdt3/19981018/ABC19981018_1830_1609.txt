While Martinez was the man of the hour for New York, Tony Gwynn is 
the man in San Diego, and he has been for years. Here's ABC's Mark 
Mullen. A ball and two strikes on Gwynn. At 5'10" and more than 220 
pounds, 38-year-old Tony Gwynn of the san Diego padres may not resemble 
the young, chiselled, movie star looks of sports heroes today, but 
a sports hero he is. He's going to be a hall of famer. He's gonna 
be the first one from San Diego to really be classified a hall of 
fame player. The right fielder has won 5 gold gloves, 8 batting titles 
and has almost 3,000 hits, including this two-run homer in last night's 
world series opener. But fans are loyal to Gwynn because he has been 
loyal to them, sticking with the padres through thick and thin, a 
padre for his entire 17-year career. When you think of the padres, 
you think of Tony Gwynn, just, you know, a Baseball guy from the old 
school, which you don't see a lot of. He became a free agent a couple 
of times and chose to stay, which is, I think, a great credit to him. 
Through ownership changes, through a failed 1984 world series attempt, 
through player upheaval, bad uniforms and an even worse rendition 
of the national anthem -- and the Rockets red glare! -- Gwynn always 
thought he should stay with the team and the city of San Diego, which 
gave him his start. It's gratifying. You know, people pulling for 
you, hoping the best for you, but, you know, I guess because I've 
been here a long time, because I've done everything I've done in a 
padres uniform. And when he wasn't in a uniform, he was often in a 
San Diego neighborhood helping the community. Everybody wants him 
to get a championship. a win for the padres would be great payback 
for him. San Diego will have a chance to tie it up tonight.
