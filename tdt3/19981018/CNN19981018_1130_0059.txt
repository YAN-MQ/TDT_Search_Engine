wind and water have claimed at least five lives in Texas. Storms dumped 
more than 15 inches of rain over parts of the state Saturday, swamping 
roads and filling rivers and creeks to capacity. Forecasters say more 
flooding is almost guaranteed. Authorities say floodwaters caused 
three people to die when floodwaters swept them from their cars. The 
storm cut power and knocked San Antonio's 911 system off line. Survivors 
say the floodwaters rose fast. They said, by the time we left, you 
could see the water coming across onion creek already. It was coming 
fast. Sofas, beds and that kind of stuff, there is no way you could 
get it out. There is no way you could evacuate a house in that short 
a time, no way. The Texas storms also spawned several tornadoes. One 
man died after a twister struck his mobile home. His wife and three 
sons were injured. A sheriff's deputy says the family had no warning.
