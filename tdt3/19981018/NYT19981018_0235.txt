Shortly after he took office in 1993, President Clinton traveled to 
Silicon Valley to lay out his vision of a robust U.S. economy buoyed 
by high-technology companies that could compete anywhere in the world. 
The night before his speech, Clinton went out to dinner with two dozen 
executives, some of whom complained bitterly about government rules 
impeding the overseas sale of computers and other cutting-edge technologies. 
Clinton grabbed a pad, furiously took notes, and promised relief, 
one executive recalled. Over the next five years, the president delivered, 
personally presiding over what industry executives and government 
officials agree was one of the most sweeping relaxations of export 
restrictions in U.S. history. ``These reforms,'' Clinton said in a 
1993 letter detailing the changes to a leading computer executive, 
``can help unleash our companies to compete successfully in the global 
market.'' In the years that followed, the new rules helped Clinton 
fulfill his vision of a centrist Democratic Party with close ties 
to U.S. business. Grateful high-technology companies showered the 
Democratic Party with campaign contributions, cementing a new financial 
base for a party that has historically struggled to raise money from 
corporate America. Administration officials portray the initiatives 
as one of Clinton's most lasting legacies, saying it bolstered national 
security by helping to make the United States' economy the world's 
strongest. The flood of new exports also created high-paying jobs 
at home. But critics, including Republicans in Congress and some former 
Clinton administration officials, argue that the high-technology exports 
had a serious side effect, strengthening countries like China, which 
some view as a potential adversary. Clinton, they contend, was blinded 
by his enthusiasm for securing the United States' global edge and 
insufficiently attentive to his policies' effect on long-term U.S. 
national security. House and Senate committees are examining whether 
China took advantage of the looser rules on exports to enhance its 
military and to obtain technology that it passed on to rogue states, 
including North Korea. The Senate Intelligence Committee and a special 
House panel, which are scheduled to report their findings in early 
1999, have held a series of closed-door hearings this fall. An examination 
by The New York Times of the administration's export policies on China, 
based on interviews as well as government and industry documents, 
shows that the looser regulations enabled Chinese companies to obtain 
a wide range of sophisticated technology, some of which has already 
been diverted to military uses. The new rules allowed U.S. companies 
to sell a host of products without prior government approval, from 
high-speed computers to machine tools to communications gear previously 
subject to restrictions during the Cold War. While the regulations 
fostered trade, they made it much harder for intelligence agencies 
to track how U.S. equipment was used overseas, administration officials 
said. Until 1993, most sales to China of goods with possible military 
uses required U.S. companies to obtain a government license naming 
both the customer and the location in which the equipment would be 
installed. Senior officials acknowledge that Clinton decided to change 
the rules without a rigorous review by intelligence officials or other 
national security experts. In 1995, CIA analysts wrote a report warning 
of the military implications of technology transfers to China, but 
it never became an official assessment, because senior aides felt 
it was ``not well done and lacked analytical depth,'' a U.S. official 
said. The government's last serious examination of technology sales 
to China, they said, had been conducted by the Reagan administration 
in 1984 at a time when the United States was trying to build up China 
as a counterweight against the Soviet Union. Since then, the Soviet 
Union has collapsed. And China has been caught selling missile equipment 
to nations like Iran and Pakistan while using its new access to Western 
technology to expand its economic and military power. Paul Wolfowitz, 
a former official in the State and Defense departments who participated 
in the 1984 study, asserted that international developments since 
then argue for a tightening of controls on sales to China, not a loosening. 
``There is an urgent need for a fundamental review of export policy 
to China especially because China is in the process of becoming _ 
albeit still quite slowly _ the major strategic competitor and potential 
threat to the United States and its allies in the first half of the 
next century,'' said Wolfowitz, who is dean of the Paul H. Nitze School 
of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. But 
another China expert sees Beijing's improvement of its technologically 
backward military as more benign. ``Its overall policy is not to be 
a troublemaker,'' said Doak Barnett, a professor emeritus at Johns 
Hopkins, who added that ``gradually building up its defense establishment 
is something I would expect it to do, but in my view it's not threatening.'' 
Whatever China's intentions, the Clinton administration over the last 
five years has approved export to China of $3 billion in technology 
with military or civilian applications, about 5 percent of overall 
U.S. sales to China. A report prepared for the Commerce Department 
last December concludes that the administration has little means of 
knowing whether this equipment is harming U.S. national security or 
being used by Chinese industries to challenge U.S. competitors and 
jobs. ``It may be too late by the time that U.S. industry and/or government 
realize there is a problem emerging in either of these areas,'' the 
confidential report says. U.S. intelligence agencies are trying to 
assess how much the Chinese military has gained from the imports. 
Officials say they have already concluded that China's army gained 
access to some of the high-speed computers sold to civilian customers 
since 1996, when the rules on computer exports were eased. The officials 
said the agencies were unable to assess how the equipment was being 
used, because they lacked basic information about the deals. Clinton 
administration officials said that the Chinese have returned the one 
computer that was improperly diverted and that a new agreement between 
the two countries will improve the ability of U.S. officials to check 
the whereabouts of equipment exported to China. Rep. Christopher Cox, 
R-Calif., who heads the select House panel on technology transfers 
to China, said, ``There's always been a tension within the government 
about which exports are proper.'' But, he added, ``these days without 
question the overriding impulse to sell, sell, sell is in the ascendancy.'' 
The Old System Cold War Rules Get New Scrutiny The United States and 
its Western allies zealously guarded their technological edge during 
the Cold War, forbidding the sale to communist-bloc nations of any 
item with a conceivable military use. Military contractors did not 
chafe too much under the restrictions, because the Pentagon had a 
seemingly limitless budget for their wares. In 1983, Chinese leader 
Deng Xiaoping complained bitterly about the restrictions on technology 
exports, prompting the Reagan administration to ease some of the rules 
for China. It was seen in the United States' interest, Wolfowitz recently 
told Congress, to help Beijing develop the military muscle needed 
to counter the ``formidable threat'' from the Soviet Union. In addition, 
he said, China had been helpful in arming the Afghan rebels. The United 
States, however, maintained tight controls over what he termed the 
most sensitive technologies _ those that could improve China's missiles 
or anti-submarine capabilities. The fall of communism brought a precipitous 
drop in the Pentagon budget, prompting the defense industry to scramble 
for new markets. Companies that once made spy satellites for U.S. 
spy agencies began making equipment for cellular networks that served 
China or Russia. They quickly confronted a significant obstacle to 
making money on sales to former adversaries. The Cold War-era rules 
remained largely in effect, and they were being interpreted by career 
officials who had devoted their lives to blocking exports to Russia 
and its allies. Enter Bill Clinton. His 1992 campaign had been driven 
by the slogan ``It's the economy, stupid.'' Aides say Clinton's views 
on foreign policy were framed by his experiences as a governor of 
Arkansas, a poor state that looked overseas for investments and markets, 
and he arrived in Washington determined to expand trade. In an immediate 
sign of this policy's political importance, Clinton sent the Democratic 
Party's chief fund-raiser, Ron Brown, to take over the Commerce Department, 
which promotes U.S. exports. The Pentagon was traditionally the strongest 
voice against technology exports, and Clinton made several appointments 
calculated to change the culture. William Perry, an executive at a 
Silicon Valley company who was vocally opposed to the existing system 
of export controls, was named deputy defense secretary and then defense 
secretary. John Deutch, a professor with similar views, was named 
to a senior pos at the Pentagon, and then became director of central 
intelligence. Perry, testifying at his confirmation hearing to be 
deputy defense secretary, told senators in February 1993 that controlling 
dual-use technology is ``a hopeless task.'' He continued, ``It only 
interferes with our companies' ability to succeed internationally 
if we try to impose all sorts of controls in that area.'' Perry said 
``we really need to bear down'' on controlling the most critical components 
necessary to build weapons. Clinton took a personal interest in the 
new policy. Shortly after he returned from his foray to Silicon Valley, 
he spelled out his intentions in a letter to Edward McCracken, the 
chief executive officer of computer maker Silicon Graphics. Company 
officials had complained to Clinton over dinner about export rules. 
``One reason I ran for president was to tailor export controls to 
the realization of a post-Cold War world,'' Clinton wrote. After noting 
the need to retain strong controls in some areas to combat the spread 
of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, Clinton detailed his 
intention to ``unleash our companies to compete successfully in the 
global market.'' The United States, he said, would slash red tape 
and loosen controls on the overseas sale of computers, telecommunication 
equipment and machine-making tools. The New System Relaxed Rules Benefit 
Chinese Those restrictions were an integral part of the Cold War. 
For decades, every proposed export of technology was weighed by a 
committee of Western nations. It had authority to block sales involving 
military hardware or so-called ``dual-use'' equipment that had military 
or civilian applications. Even before the committee disbanded in 1994, 
the Clinton administration moved to ease restrictions on the sales 
of many dual-use items. The new rules allowed companies to export 
many categories of technology without applying for a government license. 
U.S. companies were delighted with the new system, which relieved 
them of a time-consuming and frustrating process. But the benefits 
came with a cost. Because sales could be made without export licenses, 
the government and its intelligence agencies no longer had a record 
of many deals that involved dual-use equipment. There was no way to 
trace patterns of sales _ to know, for example, how many decoding 
devices were being sold to a particular country. Commerce Department 
internal documents show that China has been a major beneficiary of 
this policy. According to a 1995 estimate, more than $1.9 billion 
in annual trade with China had been removed from federal scrutiny. 
A ban remains in effect on the sale to China of the most militarily 
potent technologies, like ballistic missiles, spy satellites and advanced 
fighter aircraft. Beijing buys those weapons from Russia, Europe and 
Israel. ``China has benefited more than any other country from U.S. 
decontrols on certain dual-use commodities enacted in late 1993 and 
early 1994,'' one Commerce Department document says. ``There has been 
a 60 percent decrease in the number of individual export licenses 
required for trade with China (from 2,229 in 1993 to only 925 in 1994).'' 
The rules shifted much of the burden for controlling exports to the 
companies making the deals. Previously, the applications for licenses 
to sell sophisticated electronic equipment overseas were scrutinized 
by Pentagon and intelligence analysts. One crucial question was whether 
the customer was really a ``front'' for military users barred from 
buying such equipment. The Clinton administration's new policy relied 
on industry executives to raise questions about their own sales. They 
were required to seek a Commerce Department license only if they believed 
the equipment would end up in military hands. Aerospace officials 
say they are ill equipped to make such evaluations. Last year, the 
administration began making public the names of questionable customers, 
to warn exporters. But industry officials said the list of about a 
dozen nuclear-production facilities was a tiny slice of what was available 
and ignored entities involved in missile activity. The problem is 
particularly acute, industry executives said, when the deals involved 
China, where the military has long played a role in commercial ventures 
and where it is difficult to distinguish between military officers' 
personal and professional dealings. One of the first deals under the 
new rules, a 1994 sale of telecommunications equipment to China, illustrates 
the complexities. The Commerce Department's decision to allow such 
exports without a license made it easier for AT&AMP;T and other U.S. 
companies to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in sophisticated 
equipment to Chinese companies building civil telecommunication networks. 
An examination of the deal by the General Accounting Office, the audit 
arm of Congress, found that the equipment was sold to a Chinese-U.S. 
joint venture, Hua Mei, ``without Commerce review, even though the 
company was partially controlled by several high-level members of 
the Chinese military.'' AT&AMP;T officials in turn told the audit 
agency that ``they did not ask the Commerce Department to determine 
if Hua Mei was a civil end user, nor were they required to.'' It is 
not known whether the company has put the equipment to military use. 
But Pentagon officials told the GAO that in 1994, China's army was 
seeking to buy this same type of technology, as it moved to improve 
its communications networks. The Reassessment A Computer Sale Sets 
Off Alarms By 1995, the Pentagon was urging Congress to look more 
closely at export policy. Military officials noted that the effect 
of technology was cumulative, and that while individual sales might 
appear benign, a combination of cutting-edge acquisitions would allow 
an adversary to build much better bombs or radars. Clinton, documents 
show, was moving in the opposite direction. According to a 1995 Commerce 
Department document, the president ``made clear,'' in private conversations 
he had with Brown, that ``he does not believe we have done enough 
to streamline and liberalize.'' The document mapped out how Brown 
should lobby high-level administration officials to ease controls 
on computer exports and shift items like communications satellites, 
engine technology and commercial data-scrambling devices. Such items 
were on a list of equipment that required a State Department license, 
and companies believed they could close more deals if authority over 
the exports were moved to Brown's Commerce Department. Their enthusiasm 
for the Commerce Department was well grounded. When it comes to proposed 
sales of an item regulated by the State Department, the Pentagon holds 
a virtual veto, a privilege it exercised regularly during the Cold 
War. The Commerce Department is responsible for promoting U.S. exports. 
When it weighs an overseas deal, the Pentagon has only one vote out 
of five agencies, and the right to appeal if its objections are overruled, 
which has been rarely used. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
insisted that his department retain jurisdiction. He was overruled 
in early 1996 by Clinton, opening the way to billions of dollars of 
satellite sales to Chinese companies. At about the same time, the 
administration was weighing whether to lift restrictions on the export 
of some advanced computers. Officials asked outside consultants to 
study the issue, and they came back with a report that asserted the 
controls were pointless. The powerful computers manufactured by U.S. 
companies would soon be widely available from foreign competitors, 
the report said. The administration asked the consultants to assess 
whether computer sales could pose a threat to the U.S. military. Their 
report did not take a position, saying the government did not have 
enough information to draw a conclusion. This left the issue to Clinton, 
who decided to fulfill his pledge to the Silicon Valley executives 
and relax the restrictions. ``The president made a judgment on what 
the threat was, and the president's judgment was reflected in his 
decision,'' said William Reinsch, undersecretary of commerce for export 
administration. The new rules took effect early in 1996. Soon after, 
Chinese companies bought 77 of the high-speed computers, which can 
be used to predict weather patterns but can also scramble secret communications 
or design powerful nuclear weapons. Disclosure of those sales prompted 
Congress to reinstate license requirements for some advanced computers. 
This year, the CIA and other federal agencies concluded that at least 
some of those computers are now being used by China's military. The 
details of their use remain unclear, officials said. A review by the 
GAO last month called into question the administration's basic assumptions 
in lifting the controls on computers. Contrary to what the consultants 
said in their report, the international market for advanced computers 
remains strongly dominated by U.S. companies. Congress acted after 
The New York Times reported that two U.S. aerospace companies were 
under investigation to determine whether they went too far in sharing 
rocket technology with Chinese scientists seeking to determine the 
causes of a failed satellite launch in 1996. The inquiry, which continues, 
has since been broadened to include a failed launch in 1995. Rocket 
technology for ballistic missiles is similar to that used to send 
satellites into orbit. Both companies have denied wrongdoing. Just 
this month, Congress reversed Clinton's 1996 decision and returned 
satellite exports to the State Department. At the same time, lawmakers 
created a new senior Pentagon position for technology security after 
concluding that military officials' role in controlling exports to 
countries like China had been ``significantly and improperly reduced 
over the years.'' The Fallout Report Cites a Loss of Oversight Role 
The military significance of the United States' exports to China is 
hotly debated. China's army is in the throes of modernization. For 
now, Beijing is more of a regional power than a global threat. A commission 
headed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld concluded in July 
that the looser controls on exports, coupled with lax enforcement, 
had increased the possibility that rogue nations like Iran or North 
Korea would build ballistic missiles that could hit the United States. 
China ``poses a threat to the United States'' by supplying technology 
to these pariah states, the report said. Commission members said they 
were startled at how much the government had freed the export of dual-use 
technology and how little U.S. officials could do to track its use 
or ensure that it was not diverted to terrorists or foreign militaries. 
``What's particularly troubling,'' said James Woolsey, a commission 
member who was Clinton's first director of central intelligence, ``is 
that the massive decontrol in the last few years of the export of 
dual-use technology in general, and specifically to China, has made 
it almost impossible for the U.S. to monitor where such technology 
has gone, much less exercise any control over it.'' Another commission 
member, Barry Blechman, said technology transfer ``is a central reason 
why we reached our conclusion.'' Blechman is president of DFI International, 
the Washington consulting firm that prepared a confidential report 
for the Commerce Department in December on technology transfers to 
China. The report concludes that China does not currently pose a direct 
threat to U.S. competitiveness in high technology. But it might in 
the future, especially in areas like electronics, which by 1996 had 
become China's top export back to the United States. Then Clinton's 
policy might wind up being turned upside down, with China jeopardizing 
the same high-paying jobs that Clinton used to justify increasing 
exports to China. According to the report, the concern is that ``as 
Chinese manufacturing becomes more sophisticated and technical in 
nature'' _ thanks in part to U.S. and Western exports of that technology 
_ ``Chinese high-tech products could potentially undercut such products 
(and therefore jobs as well.)''
