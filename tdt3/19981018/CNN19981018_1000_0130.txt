More rain is forecast for Texas today. A series of storms has already 
claimed at least five lives. Eric horng reports. More than 15 inches 
of rain have drenched parts of central Texas, turning normally quiet 
streets into a raging tide of destruction. In Austin, a man riding 
a bicycle is caught in the grasp of floodwaters. Rescue workers struggle 
to pull him to safety, but the man refuses to leave his bike behind. 
With waters rising quickly, rescue workers finally pull the man and 
his bicycle from the swollen Creek. In another part of Austin, about 
100 evacuees also rush to save possessions. But for many, rising waters 
from nearby onion Creek are just too fast. Within just a matter of 
minutes of me grabbing my purse and trying to lock the door, before 
you know it, there's this Creek running across. Just enough time to 
grab a few things and perhaps a pet before jumping in a car. But where 
to go? In hays county, interstate 35 offered little help, almost swallowing 
these cars as they navigated flooded lanes. Meanwhile, 80 miles away 
in San Antonio, jet-skis and boats replaced cars as rescue workers 
feverishly worked to evacuate people from low-lying areas. We took 
out probably 30 kids, probably 20 seniors and other young kids and 
young adults. How long were you sitting on the roof of your house? 
Four hours. The flooding knocked out power and phone service to tens 
of thousands of people Saturday. And with more rain expected, both 
water levels and anxiety levels are rising. Eric horng, CNN, Texas.
