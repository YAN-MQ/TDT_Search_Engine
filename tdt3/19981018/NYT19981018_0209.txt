Adolf Althoff, a courageous German circus executive who saved several 
people in the Nazi era by having them work and travel with his circus, 
died in his sleep on Wednesday in a hospital in Stolberg near Aachen, 
Germany. He was 85 and lived in Stolberg. The cause was probably heart 
failure, said the German news agency DPA. He had been hospitalized 
after a fall at home. A member of a 300-year-old circus family, Althoff 
figures in a book about Germans who saved Jews from the Holocaust, 
``Other Germans Under Hitler'' by Herbert Straeten, published last 
year in Germany. In the book Althoff is quoted as saying, ``Circus 
people don't ask if you are Christian, Jewish or heathen.'' When the 
book was published, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany said: 
``It is incredible how many simple people _ farmers, people in the 
circus _ tried to help. But it was a minority who had the courage 
to resist. Most Germans did not.'' When the Gestapo came to check 
the circus, Althoff used the phrase ``Go fishing'' to warn people 
who were traveling with him. He once said in an interview, ``In a 
circus you can do a lot and keep it secret.'' His bravery earned him 
a high honor in 1995 from the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel. 
It also won him an award in 1994 from a German organization, the Stuttgart 
Circus-Friends, which called him a descendant of one of the oldest 
and greatest circus families in Germany. He was born in Sonsbeck near 
Duesseldorf, while his parents' circus was on tour. At 17 he became 
publicity director of the circus. Althoff and his sister formed their 
own circus while he was in his 20s, and he was its ringmaster for 
30 years. He was also, as one circus colleague put it after his death, 
``a fantastic animal trainer and animal psychologist.'' He even managed 
to ride tigers. ``His operation was regarded as a model circus because 
of its discipline and the beauty of its numbers,'' DPA said. His career 
took him around Europe and to North Africa and the United States. 
In 1940, Althoff began five years' of concealing the four members 
of the Bento performing family in his circus. By some accounts the 
husband, Peter Bento, and his wife, Irene, were Jewish. Peter worked 
as a clown and Irene as a trick rider. Other accounts suggest that 
the husband was not Jewish. Their two children were reported to be 
still performing in Germany 40 years after the war, much in demand 
as clowns. Althoff is said to have provided the Bentos with false 
identity papers and let them perform under pseudonyms. The German 
newspaper Die Welt said on Friday: ``In every city Gestapo officials 
came to check the circus. Because Althoff had friends in almost every 
city, he was mostly informed a bit ahead of time about the `visit.' 
Then he knocked on the widow of the Bentos' large covered wagon and 
gave the cue for them to disappear: `Go fishing.''' Years later heart 
trouble and diabetes forced Althoff to cut back his activities. In 
1965 he sold the Frederike Hagenbeck circus and founded a ``safari 
park'' near Aachen. When his son, Franz, founded the Williams Althoff 
circus in 1977, Adolf Althoff went on tour with it. When he was 70, 
a tiger performing with him bit his hand. He had the wound bandaged 
quickly and kept performing. Surviving are his wife, Maria, and his 
son.
