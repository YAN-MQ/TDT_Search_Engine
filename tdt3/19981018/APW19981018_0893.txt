Thirty people were killed Sunday when a train jumped its tracks at 
a north Egyptian station and careened across the platform, the Interior 
Ministry said. Ninety-six people were injured, the ministry's statement 
said, referring to hospital figures. Earlier the ministry and Egypt's 
official news agency had given death tolls in the forties. A ministry 
spokesman blamed the higher figures on confusion at the site. The 
train was traveling from the port of Alexandria to Kafr el-Sheik when 
it derailed in the station of Kafr el-Dawar, a town about 30 kilometers 
(18.6 miles) southeast of Alexandria, the ministry said. The train 
went off the rails when the driver changed tracks ``at high speed,'' 
the ministry's statement said. The locomotive and the first two passenger 
cars toppled over and plowed through people and kiosks on the platform, 
the ministry said. Egyptian television showed a crane moving toward 
one of the overturned train cars as scores of riot police fended off 
hundreds of wailing people. One train car appeared to have crashed 
into small buildings near the railway. Egyptian television appealed 
to citizens to donate blood. Residents of Kafr el-Dawar had flocked 
to the local hospital to give blood, the official Middle East News 
Agency reported. Others at the site had used their own clothes to 
staunch the bleeding of the wounded, the agency said. A senior railway 
official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was speeding because free-riding 
passengers had tampered with the brakes system between the cars, the 
news agency reported. Such trains are usually packed with hundreds 
of commuters and it is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride on 
the roof and between the cars. Health Minister Ismail Sallam, a practicing 
surgeon, left his office in Cairo and went to the site with a team 
of doctors, officials said. Egyptian railways have suffered a series 
of accidents in the past four years. The most serious was in December 
1995 when one train crashed into another in fog south of Cairo, killing 
75 people and injuring 76.
