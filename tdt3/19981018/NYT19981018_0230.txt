Joseph Machlis, an author and opera translator, whose 1955 textbook, 
``The Enjoyment of Music,'' is one of the most popular music-appreciation 
books published in English, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. 
He was 92. Machlis was a familiar figure in the classical-music world, 
although to see him _ a small, frail-looking man with thick glasses 
and a shock of unruly white hair _ one would not have guessed that 
he was a powerhouse into his 90s. Around his 85th birthday, he told 
a reporter that he still exercised regularly and swam 50 laps a day. 
He was a fixture at the opera house, recitals and new-music concerts, 
and he helped many young musicians, particularly pianists, by letting 
them perform for invited audiences at his apartment on East 57th Street, 
by lobbying critics on their behalf, or by quietly providing financial 
support for their work. He maintained that apartment solely for musicales 
and lavish parties, where musicians, literary figures and politicians 
mingled. The apartment he called home, also on the East Side, was 
a cramped studio with an antique refrigerator, a camp cot and stacks 
of papers representing various projects in progress. He said that 
the spaciousness of the other apartment upset his equilibrium. Machlis' 
90th-birthday celebration, in 1996, was an indication of the esteem 
in which he was held. For a party given by his publisher, W.W. Norton, 
13 American composers _ among them Milton Babbitt, Ned Rorem, Lukas 
Foss, John Corigliano, Hugo Weisgall, Yehudi Wyner and George Perle 
_ supplied humorous musical tributes to him. Machlis was born in Riga, 
Latvia, in 1906, but moved to New York when he was 3 and grew up in 
Brooklyn, where he studied the piano. After he completed his bachelor's 
degree at City College, in 1927, he won a scholarship from the Steinway 
piano company to study in France. Upon his return, Machlis decided 
not to pursue a concert career. He earned his master's degree in English 
literature from Columbia University while supporting himself by giving 
piano lessons, and in 1938 he joined the music faculty at Queens College, 
where he taught for 35 years. After retiring from Queens College, 
he taught at the Juilliard School. Early in his career, Machlis developed 
a new approach to teaching music history. ``I had noticed teachers 
beginning with medieval music,'' he told The New York Times in 1985. 
``But I thought, `Why not start with something more interesting and 
go backwards?' So I began with Tchaikovsky and Grieg to arouse students' 
interest. Just like if you wanted to teach English lit, you would 
start with Mailer and Tom Wolfe and go backwards to `Beowulf.''' When 
a representative of W.W. Norton asked Machlis to write a textbook 
in the early 1950s, his course notes became the basis of ``The Enjoyment 
of Music.'' Since its original publication, the book has sold more 
than 2 million copies and has undergone several revisions, the most 
recent with a co-author, Kristine Forney. Machlis also wrote ``Introduction 
to Contemporary Music'' (1963) and two books for younger readers, 
``Composers of Our Time'' (1963) and ``Getting to Know Music'' (1966). 
He was a respected translator of opera librettos. His English edition 
of Poulenc's ``Dialogues of the Carmelites'' is still used by the 
Metropolitan Opera, and many of his translations were used in televised 
NBC Opera productions starting in the 1950s. Among the works he translated 
were Beethoven's ``Fidelio,'' Mussorgsky's ``Boris Godunov,'' Prokofiev's 
``Fiery Angel,'' Puccini's ``Boheme'' and Falla's ``Atlantida.'' Machlis 
also wrote six novels between 1964 and 1990, including ``The Career 
of Magda V,'' widely regarded as a roman a clef about the soprano 
Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, although Machlis vehemently denied this; ``Stefan 
in Love''; and ``Allegro.'' His earlier novels were published under 
the name George Selcamm (the surname being Machlis, phonetically, 
backward). Machlis said that this was at Norton's insistence. ``Norton 
thought I was writing a sexy book,'' he explained, ``and my textbooks 
were used in a lot of Catholic schools.'' Machlis, a bachelor, left 
no immediate family.
