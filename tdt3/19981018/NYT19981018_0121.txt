Orlando Hernandez had been in spring training with the Yankees for 
only a few days in March when the Florida weather turned raw and cold, 
but he continued to wear Bermuda shorts and a cotton golf shirt. ``You 
ought to get some warmer clothes,'' somebody suggested. ``No,'' the 
pitcher known as El Duque said. ``I must adjust.'' Even in those months 
before he joined the Yankees, this was a thinking man's pitcher who 
knew that the weather in the United States sometimes would not be 
anywhere near as warm as it was in Cuba, that he had to learn to acclimate 
himself to the occasional chill. But baseball's October weather, which 
in other years has been known to dip into the 40s, if not the 30s, 
has been kind to El Duque. When he rescued the Yankees in Cleveland 
a week ago Saturday night, squaring the American League Championship 
Series at 2-2, the game-time temperature was a comfortable 57 degrees, 
balmy for the Lake Erie shore in October. And when he went to the 
mound against the San Diego Padres at Yankee Stadium on Sunday night 
in the second game of the World Series, the temperature again was 
balmy and pleasant. But regardless, the Yankees would have expected 
El Duque to adjust, just as he has adjusted so quickly to everything 
else _ American culture, Yankee tradition, major league hitters. From 
the time El Duque joined the Yankees in early June, Joe Torre has 
talked about the calm that the now 29-year-old right-hander has displayed, 
no matter what the adjustment. If that calm wasn't in him, El Duque, 
who had been banned from Cuba's national team, would not have climbed 
on a small boat in February with seven others and a few cans of Spam 
and drifted across the Caribbean to Anguila Cay and eventually to 
the Yankees and the World Series. That calm was there when El Duque 
was asked whether his Cuban companions on the boat were his guests 
at Saturday night's Series opener. He handled that conversation as 
if he were pitching, throwing his fastball from different angles, 
then busting his curveball for a called third strike. ``Did they come?'' 
he asked. ``I was told they came,'' his questioner said. ``Who told 
you that?'' he asked. ``One of the broadcasters from Miami.'' ``Yes, 
they are here,'' he said. ``Now that you told me who told you, we're 
even.'' No, he was way ahead. El Duque didn't appear awed by the World 
Series. He had seen it in Cuba on television. When his half-brother, 
Livan Hernandez, pitched the Florida Marlins to the World Series title 
a year ago, he watched the games in the CNN studios in Havana. When 
he was asked if, as a member of Cuba's national team, he had ever 
pitched in a game similar to the magnitude of the Series, his calm 
was there. ``I know I've pitched in three world championships, one 
Olympics, also various other tournaments I don't remember,'' he said 
through his interpreter, Leonardo Astacio. ``And in Cuba, I pitched 
in many league championships and national titles, I don't know if 
you could compare them to the magnitude of the World Series, but they're 
pretty big.'' And when El Duque was asked if he ever surprised himself 
when pitching, his calm was there. ``I never really surprise myself 
on the mound,'' he replied. ``Because if I did it, then there's no 
reason for me to be surprised because it's something I did.'' Torre 
called it a calm, but Brian Cashman, the Yankee general manager, called 
it something else. ``When we brought El Duque into camp, he had a 
presence about him even then,'' Cashman said, ``I remember Joe Torre 
watched him throw in the outfield and he told me, `This guy is intriguing.''' 
El Duque had already intrigued Lin Garrett, the Yankee scouting director, 
when put on display for scouts in Costa Rica. ``Lin told me, `You've 
got to get this guy, he can be our No. 3 starter this year,' '' Cashman 
recalled. ``Anaheim and Cleveland also were after him. Anaheim's offer 
supposedly included a movie deal. Cleveland was offering good money.'' 
Cleveland's offer was between $2 million and $3 million, but the Yankees 
put together a four-year, $6.6 million offer. ``Some scouts for other 
clubs didn't think El Duque had enough fastball, and they also wondered 
about his age,'' Cashman said. ``The way we figured it, if he signed 
with us, he's 28. If he signed with somebody else, he's got wooden 
teeth.'' But whatever El Duque's age, whatever his teeth, whatever 
the weather, it's his calm that the Yankees like best.
