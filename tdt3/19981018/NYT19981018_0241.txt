The champagne is not on ice just yet, but it certainly looks as if 
Jeff Gordon will soon be celebrating another NASCAR Winston Cup championship, 
his second straight and third in four years. Gordon took his 11th 
checkered flag this season and got his first career victory in October 
on Saturday night in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway, 
the first stock-car race under the lights there. The victory gave 
Gordon a 358-point lead over Mark Martin, who, with just three races 
left on the schedule, has virtually no chance of catching him. Martin, 
driving a Ford, finished 16th on Saturday. Gordon, who has scored 
top-five finishes in each of the last three restrictor-plate races, 
can, with a good run, clinch the title next week at Phoenix. He needs 
to finish 32nd or better in each of the final three races. ``Awesome! 
Awesome!'' Gordon's crew chief, Ray Evernham, shouted over the radio 
as the No. 24 Dupont Monte Carlo hit the finish line. ``Hey, Jeff, 
it's October, buddy, it's October.'' To which Gordon replied: ``You 
better believe it. Yes it is. Yes it is.'' Gordon, who had 39 career 
victories before Saturday but had become notorious for registering 
them before October, took the lead for good with 37 laps remaining. 
The race was red-flagged because of rain with six laps to go and ended 
under caution when a car spun on the final lap. Gordon piloted his 
Chevy around the 2.5-mile, high-banked oval at an average speed of 
144.549 miles an hour. ``We figured that somebody would say this was 
actually a July race that was run in October,'' Gordon said after 
winning his 40th. Saturday's race was originally scheduled for July 
4, but raging forest fires and smoke in the surrounding area forced 
its postponement. The fires, which charred more than 30,000 acres, 
came within one mile of the speedway. Bobby Labonte, who won the pole 
last Thursday, continued his success in restrictor-plate races, driving 
his way back from seventh place to take second. Mike Skinner was third. 
``I thought we were going to run on Gordon off Turn 4 there,'' Labonte 
said, referring to an inside move he made on the race leader in the 
last lap. ``But I didn't get any help.'' In addition to being the 
first stock-car race under the lights at Daytona, the race marked 
the first time in the series that restrictor plates, which limit horsepower 
and thus speed, had been used on the cars in consecutive weeks. (Talladega, 
the only other track where cars are fitted with restrictor plates, 
was the site of the previous weekend's race.) About the new lighting 
system at Daytona, Gordon said: ``The lights were fantastic. I think 
they did a great job here. There was no problem from the drivers' 
standpoint as far as shadows.''
