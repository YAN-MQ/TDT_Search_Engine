There are signs Yugoslavia is living up to its promises about Kosovo, 
but serbs and ethnic Albanians are blaming each other for new shooting 
attacks that underscore the shakiness of the cease-fire agreement. 
NATO U-2 reconnaissance planes are flying over the province. U.S. 
officials say there's clear indications that Yugoslav president slobodan 
Milosevic is pulling back at least two of seven Serb battalions from 
Kosovo. The surveillance also shows improved access for relief workers. 
NATO has extended its original deadline for compliance by a week and 
a Half. If NATO is unsatisfied with Yugoslavia's efforts, air strikes 
could occur.
