Archeologists needed only bare hands _ not a rainbow _ to unearth 
a pot of gold at an excavation site in northern Israel Sunday. Workers 
digging at Bet Shean, known for its extensive ruins dating back to 
Roman times, found a 6th-century ceramic jug containing between 200 
and 400 gold coins. The jug was found hidden beneath the floor of 
a room in a Byzantine-era neighborhood outside Bet Shean's ancient 
city walls. ``This is very important,'' said Ofer Sion, an archeologist 
with Israel's Antiquities Authority. ``We find coins every day, but 
not so many.'' Sion believes someone stashed the treasure underneath 
the floor but never had the chance to reclaim it. The site where the 
jug was found is believed to have been a wealthy neighborhood during 
Byzantine rule, which began in the 4th century after the fall of the 
Roman empire and lasted until the 7th century. Today there are plans 
to build a youth hostel on the site. In accordance with Israel law, 
about 60 workers are now conducting a four-month ``rescue dig'' before 
construction starts. Archeologists have one month left to dig. Sion 
said the coins will be cleaned and counted during the next few days 
and eventually turned over to the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem, 
which is devoted to archaeology.
