Searchers in Canada have recovered one of the three engines from Swissair 
flight 111. The plane crashed off Nova Scotia about six weeks ago, 
killing all 229 people aboard. The engine has been taken to a Canadian 
military base for analysis. Investigators are still trying to determine 
what caused the crash. Meanwhile, the royal Canadian mounted police 
are denying rumors that a Large quantity of gold and cash was found. 
Swissair confirmed last month the plane was carrying diamonds and 
bundles of cash. The rcmp says finding them is a not a priority.
