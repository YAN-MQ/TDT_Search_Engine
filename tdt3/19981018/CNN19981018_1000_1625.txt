Thousands of San Diego padre fans went to their home stadium to see 
their team take on the New York Yankees in game one of the world series 
yesterday, even though it was played in New York. The city's mayor 
opened the stadium to the public for free so they could watch the 
live telecast from Yankee stadium on the big screen. Padre fans got 
into the spirit with painted faces and pom-poms. Unfortunately for 
them, their hometown boys dropped game one to the Bronx bombers, 9-6.
