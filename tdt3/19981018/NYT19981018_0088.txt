In 1996, Mark Golin was living in Allentown, Pa., editing a Web site 
for Prevention magazine and addressing elderly readers' health questions 
when a call came from Bonnie Fuller, editor of Cosmopolitan. Eighteen 
months later, after a stint as deputy editor of Cosmopolitan under 
Ms. Fuller, Golin is the editor of Maxim magazine, the current flavor 
of the month in the field of men's magazines. Matt Lauer is fond of 
reading jokes from Maxim on The Today Show; the Pulitzer Prize-winning 
memoirist Frank McCourt even attended the Maxim ``End of Seinfeld'' 
party last fall. ``I was at Cosmo for about eight or nine months, 
and that was fun,'' Golin said, spreading his arms in an all-embracing, 
Zorba-the-Greek-like gesture. ``What's not to like? It was me _ and 
loads and loads of women.'' Suffice it to say, Golin _ with jokes 
that are too dirty to print in a daily newspaper and his indifference 
to the sartorial matters concerning most men's magazine editors _ 
is the very embodiment of Maxim, which magazine consultants describe 
as the Playboy of the 1990s. At a time when the competition in the 
men's magazine market is heated _ the field is crowded with new titles 
like Bob Guccione Jr.'s Gear and Disney's ESPN _ and most men's titles 
are aiming for a sophisticated, advertiser-friendly audience, Maxim, 
based in New York, is an unlikely success story. Unlike GQ or Details, 
which encourage sophistication, Maxim encourages its readers to exist 
in a perpetual state of chest-thumping, girl-chasing, adolescent jokesterism. 
Semi-nude starlets grace each cover; inside, advertisements for beer 
and consumer electronics rub elbows with articles about how to get 
back at the boss. If Maxim had a Man of the Year, he would be Austin 
Powers. ``There's a guy inside all men,'' said Golin, ``and whether 
you're pumping gas in Iowa or you're working on Wall Street, you can't 
ignore your inner guy.'' Felix Dennis, the multimillionaire British 
publisher who publicizes the fact that he dates 10 women simultaneously, 
introduced Maxim to the British in 1995; it is now third in the British 
field of ``lad'' magazines, as they are called _ volumes devoted mostly 
to sex, adventure and humor. Loaded and FHM _ the letters stand for 
``For Him Magazine'' _ have been looking at the U.S. market. The London-based 
Dennis Publishing, which produces 21 titles, introduced the American 
version of Maxim in 1997. Maxim's publishers are optimistic, projecting 
a guaranteed rate base of 650,000 for January 1999 and profitability 
by the end of next year, two years ahead of schedule. Since Golin 
arrived in January, circulation has risen from 393,977 to 536,455 
for the June issue. For now, Maxim is outpacing the stalwarts. With 
an average newsstand circulation of 192,409 for each issue in the 
first half of 1998, Maxim beat newsstand sales of titles like Details 
(with 157,815) from Conde Nast Publications, a unit of Advance Publications; 
Hearst Corp.'s Esquire (with 84,066), Wenner Media's Men's Journal 
(76,220), and P.O.V. (12,108), which is financed by an arm of Freedom 
Communications. Conde Nast's GQ sold 285,853 newsstand copies per 
issue for the same period and Men's Health from Rodale Press Inc. 
sold 385,227. ``The problem with men's magazines now is that they're 
all vertical,'' said Golin, who noted that Maxim, by contrast, is 
not about one subject _ like fashion or sports _ but many subjects, 
and they are all anchored by his demented sense of humor. A November 
feature titled ``If Men Ruled the World'' includes entries like this 
one: ``Instead of an expensive engagement ring, you could present 
your wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said `You're (NU)1!''' 
One recent article, titled ``The Man With the $100,000 Breasts,'' 
was recently optioned for film by Fox Searchlight. ``GQ is fine if 
you're interested in fashion and want a magazine that every month 
is going to reinforce the fact that you had better have a closetful 
of this stuff or you're getting nowhere,'' Golin said. Details is 
for a reader who feels he is ``Mr. Pop-Culture-Groovy,'' he added, 
describing Esquire as ``an ortolan.'' ``It's this rare bird they eat 
in the South of France,'' he explained. ``It's just too precious.'' 
Critics are quick to point out that Maxim is, well, vulgar, and that 
vulgarity has a short shelf life. ``They've been very successful in 
targeting the low end,'' Linda Mason, publisher of Details, said. 
``But will it last? I don't know.'' ``It's a fun bathroom read,'' 
said Drew Massey, publisher of P.O.V., a magazine that focuses on 
young men and business. Massey said that Maxim's robust newsstand 
sales did not mean it was building a loyal subscriber base. ``They 
don't have readers coming back and developing a subscriber relationship 
with the magazine,'' he said. But Maxim publisher Lance Ford denied 
that, saying that Maxim's conversion rate from newsstand to subscription 
is 10 percent. The industry average is generally considered to be 
3 percent, say industry analysts. Ford _ formerly the advertising 
director at The New Yorker and associate publisher of Bon Appetit 
_ has lured advertisers like Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. 
and AT&AMP;T, typically conservative corporations when it comes to 
ad placement. ``There's no doubt there's a moral majority running 
this country and running big business,'' Ford said. ``A lot of the 
big companies said, `Don't come to us first, we're not ready yet.''' 
David Verklin, chief executive of Carat North America, an advertising 
agency, said, ``Lance could talk a dog off a meat truck.'' Last year, 
Verklin successfully encouraged the Saturn division of Mercury to 
advertise in Maxim. While Ford and Golin behave like a pair of gung-ho 
Manhattan bachelors, both are married. Golin _ who is also a classically 
trained violinist and favors Bach variations _ has two young children 
with his wife, a former advertising executive. ``But don't put that 
in!'' he shouted, joking. ``It'll ruin everything.''
