Two more men were arrested Sunday in connection with the abduction 
of three Swiss tourists and the rape of two of them. Police spokesman 
Bala Naidoo said the arrests of the men brought to four the number 
of people apprehended in the Wednesday attack. A final suspect is 
being sought. Five men abducted the women as they were leaving a game 
reserve in northern KwaZulu-Natal province. Two were repeatedly raped 
through the night. A third woman escaped being raped by saying she 
was ill. The victims were found Thursday morning. Their burned-out 
vehicle has since been found and some of their belongings recovered, 
Naidoo said. The four suspects _ two of whom were arrested Friday 
_ would appear in court on Monday morning, he said.
