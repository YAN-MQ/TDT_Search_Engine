The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 19: Congress' 
desire to hasten the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Baghdad 
is understandable. But throwing money and weapons at Iraq's feeble 
and fractious opposition will not achieve the intended results. This 
month Congress authorized the Pentagon and State Department to transfer 
up to $97 million in U.S. military equipment to Iraq's unreliable 
opposition groups in the hope that they can somehow overthrow the 
Iraqi dictator and replace him with a democratic government. The White 
House must firmly resist any temptation to arm these discredited organizations. 
There are more useful, less expensive ways to nurture future democracy. 
They include broadcasting independent news into Iraq, which receives 
modest funding in the new legislation, and the administration's effort 
to encourage the development of independent civil associations in 
Iraq. Saddam has spent the past two decades building a police state 
to protect his power. Internal security forces and military units 
move swiftly to crush opposition. Sending Iraqi opposition groups 
in their present disarray against this state power would be senseless, 
and would complicate efforts to maintain the international sanctions. 
The intended beneficiaries of U.S. support include the Iraqi National 
Congress, which represents almost no one and has failed to produce 
results with aid it previously received from Washington. Also included 
are the two main Kurdish militias, which have spent more energy fighting 
each other than battling Saddam. Some of these groups are almost certainly 
taking part in a separate set of covert operations against the Iraqi 
government organized and financed by the CIA. Unfortunately, the CIA 
still seems to know very little about the internal political life 
of the Iraqi regime. The agency has devoted most of its efforts to 
encouraging plots within the military forces. These have invariably 
been detected by Hussein's closest aides and then manipulated to identify 
and execute potentially disloyal commanders. Instead of dreaming about 
military rebellions, Washington should devote its energy and resources 
to preventing Baghdad from rebuilding an arsenal of biological and 
chemical weapons. That work has all but ceased in the face of Iraqi 
resistance and an erosion of international support.
