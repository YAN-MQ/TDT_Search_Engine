When it comes to environmental politics, it's not always who you know 
or what you know, but often where you live that makes a difference. 
David Mattingly reports. It's not always easy to draw environmental 
battle lines along party lines. The new scorecard from the league 
of conservation voters shows, in congress, it's not merely what party 
you're from, it's where you live that drives environmental politics. 
We find that the northeast is a region of the country that always 
has the strongest environmental voting records, both among democrats 
and republicans. They vote more pro-environment than the democratic 
or republican national averages. Take Maine's two republican senators. 
They outscored North Dakota's two democrats. But in the farm belt 
and rocky mountain region, federal involvement in environmental protection 
has never been particularly welcome. Many western congressman who 
are zeroes to environmentalists are heroes on a competing scorecard 
issued by pro-ranching, logging and mining groups. It is very difficult 
to be anti-property rights and anti-use of natural resources and win 
in the west now. And that is becoming increasingly true in the south, 
as problems like the endangered species act affect more and more areas 
in the south. But you can still often tell the parties of the congressional 
players without a scorecard. The Senate's republican leadership earned 
straight zeroes from the environmentalists. The democrats' Senate 
leaders averaged a 78% rating. And controversies over logging and 
protecting endangered species will win and lose votes in some key 
races in November. Perhaps nowhere more than in Washington state, 
where incumbent senator patty Murray takes her 93% pro-environment 
score against challenger Linda smith who got a 21% rating in the house. 
Even if the environment has joined a lot of other issues on Washington's 
back burner, don't forget that this man has made the environment his 
signature issue. Al Gore wants to run as the environmental candidate 
in the year 2000. Some want to make him the environmental President 
a bit sooner. That's largely up to Henry Hyde's house Judiciary committee. 
Hyde's conservation voting score -- 10%. For "CNN earth matters," 
I'm David Mattingly.
