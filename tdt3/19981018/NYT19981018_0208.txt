Danny Kanell was elated Sunday. The Giants had just won over Arizona, 
and he had enjoyed the best day of his career: completing 22 of 36 
passes for 259 yards and three touchdowns. On his way to the interview 
room, he passed Coach Jim Fassel. ``Good job,'' Fassel said. ``Thanks, 
that was fun,'' Kanell responded. ``That talk last night really helped.'' 
Fassel had told his players to lighten up; the sky wasn't falling, 
the world wasn't ending. They'd simply lost two games. Now it was 
time to win one. Thanks in large part to Kanell, they did, 34-7. Rewind 
two weeks for a different picture of Kanell. He was disheartened as 
he stood before the news media, talking about a performance against 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that he acknowledged had been the worst in 
his two years as starter: 10 for 27 passing with three interceptions 
and 83 yards. He had apologized to his teammates, telling them he 
would never let it happen again. And while he wasn't as bad the next 
week, the Giants still lost to Atlanta. Fassel said Sunday that he 
had been concerned. ``After the last two weeks I was,'' the coach 
said. ``But he wasn't getting help; the guy was getting killed back 
in the pocket. I really never lost confidence in him. He got a little 
lazy with his mechanics. I felt good about Danny's preparation, I 
felt good about seeing him under pressure. I just needed to keep his 
confidence going so it doesn't wane _ protecting him a little bit 
so he doesn't take too many bullets, and then let him do his job.'' 
Sunday's high for Kanell was another day in the life of a maturing 
pro quarterback, a roller-coaster ride with sharp highs, steep lows 
and dramatic shifts in performances. And this season, the National 
Football League seems to have an inordinate number of young quarterbacks 
trying to find their way. Glenn Foley, the Jets' hero last month, 
was benched again in the wake of a terrible performance in St. Louis 
last week. Peyton Manning, Indianapolis' high-priced, high-octane 
rookie, had led the league in interceptions before matching Steve 
Young on Sunday in a close loss to San Francisco. With Danny Wuerffel 
at quarterback, New Orleans is so desperate that the Saints snatched 
Kerry Collins off the waiver wire after he had quit on Carolina. ``Guys 
were asking me for advice on how to tell Ryan Leaf to get out of his 
slump,'' Kanell said, referring to San Diego's high-priced rookie 
passer. ``That's the way it is.'' There's a thin line to walk between 
waiting for a quarterback to blossom and pulling the plug. Last season, 
Fassel pulled the plug on Dave Brown and went with Kanell. ``I think 
probably three years,'' Fassel said. ``Last year was a kind of experimental 
year, this year settling in, next year is taking it from there.'' 
As Kanell spoke about his triumphant afternoon, Jake Plummer, the 
Cardinals' second-year quarterback, stood before reporters downcast 
as if the world had caved in. His world was intact, but his passing 
pocket had been in shambles. Plummer was 12 for 21 passing for 139 
yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions. ``It's frustrating,'' 
Plummer said. ``Any time you try to do your job and you're not doing 
it well, it's frustrating. But my confidence is never going to go 
down the tank. It's not my style, it's not what I'm made of. I have 
to stand, be strong and show my teammates that I'm young but I'm going 
to come back this week and work hard. Maybe I need to put in a little 
extra work.'' Someone asked Plummer, who turned 23 in December, if 
he thinks improvement is a matter of working harder or simply playing 
longer, gaining experience. ``I don't want let time be my excuse,'' 
Plummer said. ``I really don't have time. In two weeks, we play Detroit; 
if I'm looking for extra time, there's no way I'm going to get it. 
I want to be a good quarterback and lead this team right now. If it 
takes time, hopefully they'll stick with me and let me develop.'' 
Plummer said he drew some measure of encouragement from Kanell, who 
had quieted his critics _ for the time being. ``He's probably had 
it harder than I have,'' Plummer said, ``being out here in New York, 
with everyone down his throat and yelling at him. But he's tough.'' 
Across the hall, Kanell was sympathetic to Plummer. ``That's the way 
it is in this game,'' Kanell said. ``Everybody goes through it. It's 
like a cycle. The guys who are going to survive are the guys who can 
make it through the times like this.'' Kanell finally excused himself 
and went off to savor the victory. He should enjoy it while he can.
