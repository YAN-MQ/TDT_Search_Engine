Movie audiences over the weekend responded tentatively to ``Beloved,'' 
despite lavish promotion by its studio, Walt Disney Co., and its star 
and producer, Oprah Winfrey. The story about the legacy of slavery, 
adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Toni Morrison, seemed 
to play especially well in cities like New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, 
Chicago and San Francisco. The prime audience for the film, which 
opened with weekend box-office sales of $8.5 million, appeared to 
be older black women. ``It played strongly in sophisticated markets 
where the book did well,'' said Marvin Antonowsky, a veteran film-marketing 
consultant. ``It played weakly in middle America. It played very well 
among black women who are 35-plus.'' A rival studio's marketing executive, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ``It's certainly strong 
in review-driven, upscale theaters. It had strong support in the African-American 
community. Where it didn't do well at all is at big suburban malls 
all over the country, and you have to do well at those theaters.'' 
Several other rival executives characterized the opening as disappointing. 
But Dick Cook, chairman of the Walt Disney Motion Picture Group, disagreed. 
``I'd characterize the opening as good,'' he said. ``This is not an 
exploitation movie. This is a serious movie. We've seen tremendous 
critical acclaim. It'll take time to build, especially in smaller 
towns.'' The film opened fifth, behind ``Practical Magic,'' ``Bride 
of Chucky,'' ``Antz'' and ``Rush Hour.'' But comparisons are a bit 
unfair because ``Beloved'' opened at fewer theaters than those movies 
and its length, at nearly three hours, limited the number of shows. 
(``Saving Private Ryan,'' however, a film of similar length, opened 
No. 1 at $30 million.) Although there were a handful of negative reviews 
for the film, most critics welcomed it as a challenging and powerful 
drama. Directed by the Academy Award winner Jonathan Demme, the movie 
is set just before and after the Civil War and focuses on an ex-slave, 
Sethe, played by Ms. Winfrey, who has survived unspeakable horrors. 
The bleakness of the subject has been a challenge to Disney's marketing 
and publicity executives, who have been helped by Ms. Winfrey's full-court 
personal promotion on television, in newspapers and in magazines. 
The film, costing $53 million and an additional $30 million to promote, 
faces a serious struggle at the box office. As an added burden carried 
by ``Beloved,'' films dealing with African-American themes generally 
fare badly in the lucrative overseas market. Even in competitive Hollywood, 
studio executives want ``Beloved'' to succeed, largely because so 
few mainstream films tackle serious subjects. Should ``Beloved'' fail 
at the box office, it would make it harder to produce big-budget serious 
films, especially those dealing with race.
