A series of small quakes rattled central Nicaragua on Sunday, damaging 
homes near the epicenter and killing one woman. Three quakes, ranging 
in preliminary magnitude between 3.4 and 4, rattled Managua and sent 
residents scrambling from their homes starting at 7:31 a.m. local 
time (1331 GMT). Several smaller temblors were also reported. One 
woman was crushed by a tree toppled in the first quake in the village 
of Ticuantepe, six miles (11 kilometers) southeast of Managua and 
two miles (3 kilometer) from the quake's epicenter, firefighters reported. 
Firefighters said they evacuated some residents of Ticuantepe. Nicaragua's 
National Seismology Department said the quakes were related to volcanic 
activity and movement along local fault lines. The area is located 
near the active Masaya volcano, but experts said there was no apparent 
threat of an eruption.
