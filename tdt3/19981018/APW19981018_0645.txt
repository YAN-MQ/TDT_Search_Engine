Three men were sentenced to death Sunday for a series of bombings 
in eastern Yemen in 1996 that killed a number of soldiers, a court 
official said. Baghash Saeed al-Aghbary, Saeed bin Sulaiman and Mohammed 
Saleh Haidarah were found guilty of bombing military posts, forming 
armed gangs and working for foreign country, the official said on 
condition of anonymity. The court also sentenced nine other men to 
prison terms of six to 10 years. One defendant was acquitted. The 
men were arrested in Nov. 1996 and charged with a series of attacks 
on military posts during mid-1996 in the eastern province of Mahara. 
It is not clear how many soldiers died in the attacks. The death sentences 
will be submitted to President Ali Abdullah Saleh for approval. Yemen 
is still reeling from a 1994 civil war that nearly tore apart the 
union reached in 1990 between the conservative north and the socialist 
south. The government says subsequent acts of violence were directed 
from abroad, but it has not named a country.
