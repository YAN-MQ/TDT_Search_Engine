Vandals looted a prehistoric cave Sunday that was discovered by road 
workers late last week, making off with a skull, an axe and pottery 
believed to be at least 4,000 years old. The thieves penetrated the 
cave, which had been left unguarded, through a hole in the side that 
had been blocked by a large rock, police said. Local archeologists 
called the cave an ``exceptional discovery'' after it was discovered 
Friday by two workers building the new A75 highway in the Languedoc 
region of southern France. Four human skeletons, three adults and 
a child who was believed to be a little girl, were preserved in the 
cave, as well as cooking pots, an axe and a vase. Archeologist Christian 
Olive said he believed was a burial site that could date back to 2,000 
B.C. The area immediately was sealed off and work stopped on that 
part of the new highway. But the cave was not guarded. France's most 
famous prehistoric is Lascaux in the Dordogne region, where magnificent 
paintings of animals have been preserved.
