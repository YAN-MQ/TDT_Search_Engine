A pipeline explosion spilled oil on a rural hamlet early Sunday and 
fire raced through the village, killing at least 25 people and injuring 
66, authorities said. Police said leftist rebels were suspected in 
the blast. ``The liquid spilled all over houses in the village. And 
no one knows exactly how the fire started,'' said police officer Robert 
Valencia in Segovia, the largest town near Machuca, where the deaths 
occurred. ``People were asleep at the time and the fire spread quickly.'' 
``There was a huge explosion and afterward a ball of flame erupted, 
according to survivors,'' said Gen. Alfredo Salgado, operations director 
of the national police. Valencia told The Associated Press by telephone 
that the explosion occurred at 2:45 a.m. in the village 300 kilometers 
(180 miles) north of Bogota, and that many of the victims were trapped 
by the flames. He said many of the injured, rushed to at least four 
area hospitals, had third-degree burns. The Antioquia state governor's 
office said at least 25 people were killed and 66 injured and Defense 
Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said leftist rebels, who frequently sabotage 
Colombia's oil pipelines, were suspected. ``The chances that it was 
a terrorist attack are stronger than the chances it was accident,'' 
Lloreda told the Radionet network. ``The people in the area say it 
was the ELN,'' said Valencia, referring to the National Liberation 
Army, which operates in the area and is blamed for most oil pipeline 
attacks. There was no immediate comment from the rebel group. The 
houses of Machuca, a cluster of wooden houses with about 150 residents, 
were largely destroyed, Valencia said. The damaged Colombia Central 
pipeline, a periodic target of ELN sabotage operated by the state-owned 
Ecopetrol oil company, transports 100,000 barrels of crude daily, 
most of it from the Cusiana oil field in east-central Colombia to 
the Covenas terminal on the Caribbean. The blast halted pumping on 
the pipeline. Leaders of the ELN, Colombia's second-largest rebel 
band, say they blow up oil pipelines because the government has sold 
out to foreign oil interests. Sunday's deaths occurred exactly a week 
after ELN leaders held talks in mountains not far from Segovia with 
government and civilian representatives to establish parameters for 
peace talks scheduled for February. In talks with civilian leaders 
in July, the rebel group said it would curtail its attacks on pipelines. 
The ELN has not, however, denounced the armed struggle or said when 
it might agree to a cease-fire. The rebel movement extorts money from 
companies that operate in rural areas it controls, and those businesses 
that refuse to pay its ``war taxes'' are frequently attacked or have 
executives kidnapped. The ELN has no history, however, of intentionally 
targeting civilians in dynamiting oil facilities, attacks which usually 
occur in unpopulated areas. This year, rebels have sabotaged Colombian 
pipelines more than 62 times, or 50 percent more than last year.
