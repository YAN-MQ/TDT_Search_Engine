A pipeline explosion splashed oil on a rural Colombian hamlet Sunday 
and fire raced through the village, killing at least 45 people and 
injuring more than 60. Leftist rebels were suspected in the blast. 
``The liquid spilled all over houses in the village. And no one knows 
exactly how the fire started,'' said police officer Robert Valencia 
in Segovia, the nearest town. The fire was in Machuca, about 180 miles 
(300 kms) north of Bogota. Valencia said y telephone that the 2:45 
a.m. explosion destroyed most of the wood huts with straw roofs in 
the settlement of about 150 residents, most of them gold miners. The 
injured were airlifted to at least six area hospitals, most of them 
with third-degree burns. The pipeline was on a rise just above the 
hamlet, Valencia said. More than half of the fatalities were children 
and 34 of the victims died on the spot, Guillermo Franco, the Antioquia 
state health director, said from the state capital of Medellin. He 
said all 49 hospitalized survivors were badly burned, under anesthesia 
and not able recount their ordeal. Gen. Alfredo Salgado, operations 
director of the national police, said survivors described ``a huge 
explosion and afterward a ball of flame erupted.'' Army spokesman 
Col. Paulino Coronado said the death toll would rise was expected 
to rise because ``three entire houses were wiped out by the blast'' 
and their inhabitants had not yet been included in the death toll. 
Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said leftist rebels, who frequently 
sabotage Colombia's oil pipelines, were suspected. ``The chances that 
it was a terrorist attack are stronger than the chances it was accident,'' 
he told the Radionet network. ``The people in the area say it was 
the ELN,'' said Valencia, referring to the National Liberation Army, 
which operates in the area and is blamed for most oil pipeline attacks. 
There was no immediate comment from the rebel group. Machuca, which 
had about 150 residents, was largely burned to the ground, Valencia 
said. President Andres Pastrana, in Portugal for a summit of Iberoamerican 
leaders, called the incident ``a bloody attack'' and sent condolences 
to the victims. He did not directly blame the rebels but asked them 
for ``gestures of peace.''
