In Rome today, a celebration to Mark Pope John Paul's election to 
the papacy. NBC's Keith Miller on the man and his mission. At the 
first public event of his 21st year as Pope, John Paul asked if he 
got it right during the first 20 years. He wondered aloud if he had 
lived up to the expectations of his church and its 1 billion members. 
When he was elected, karol wojtyla was the first nonitalian Pope in 
almost 500 years and nobody knew what to expect. And he does the unexpected. 
He travels the world as a champion of human rights. He's traveled 
almost 700,000 miles to 117 countries holding talks with 766 heads 
of state or governments. But to critics within the church, he is the 
no Pope -- no to divorce, no to abortion and no to women in the priesthood. 
You may not believe his message, you may not think he's right, you 
may in fact repudiate the message as harmful, and yet you're inspired 
by the man doing that. John Paul has been leading the Roman Catholic 
church longer than any Pope this century. The humility in the man 
is to be celebrated, his ability to still open himself to new learning 
is to be celebrated. But at 78 years old John Paul is moving slowly. 
Still Vatican officials say the Pope is in good health. And today, 
he showed once again the touch that has made him so popular. He may 
appear frail, but John Paul says he's determined to lead the church 
into the third millennium. Keith Miller, NBC news.
