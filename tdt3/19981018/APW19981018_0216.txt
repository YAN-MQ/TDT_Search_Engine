Mitsutaka Kusakabe fired a 3-under-par 69 in gusting winds Sunday 
and edged Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki by one stroke for the Nikkei Cup 
Torakichi Nakamura Memorial championship. Kusakabe, seeking his third 
career title and first since winning the Casio World last November, 
scored an eagle and two birdies against one bogey on his way to an 
8-under 280 total. It was one of only six sub-par scores in winds 
gusting up to 32 kph (20 mph) after Typhoon Zeb crossed over southwestern 
Japan. Ozaki, Japan's winningest golfer with 108 career victories, 
shot a 74 for 281. British Open runner-up Brian Watts of the United 
States turned in a 72 and was alone in third at 282. Kusakabe, who 
started the round four shots behind Ozaki, shared the lead at 9-under 
after chipping in an approach shot for an eagle on the par-5 14th. 
After both Kusakabe and Ozaki bogeyed the par-4 15th, Kusakabe parred 
the remaining three holes, while Ozaki reached the green in three 
and two-putted for a bogey-5 on the final hole. ``When Jumbo was putting 
for par on the final hole, I thought I would have little chance to 
beat him (in a playoff) unless he missed the putt,'' said Kusakabe. 
Kusakabe earned 19.8 million yen (dlrs 167,000) from a purse of 110 
million yen (dlrs 928,000).
