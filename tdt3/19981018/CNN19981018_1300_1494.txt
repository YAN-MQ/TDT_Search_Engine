We've been hearing a lot of his music as we watch our favorite TV 
shows and movies. Keb' Mo' sings the blues, but that's not how he's 
feeling. Mark Scheerer reports. Let bygones be bygones and trouble 
being long gone Keb' Mo' says he liked the name "slow down" for his 
third CD so he'd have a constant reminder to himself. It's kind of 
like a signal to myself to kind of like slow down and go for a Little 
more quality, than quantity when doing this stuff. Still, it seems 
keb' Mo' is managing to do both. Just hand it over hand it over hand 
it over Since his 1994 debut, keb' Mo's music has been everywhere. 
On television, it was seen in the series "touched by an Angel," and 
is on the newly released soundtrack. Later this month, keb' Mo' acts 
and performs in CBS' "the promised land," which will feature more 
of his music this season. I love my baby gonna tell everybody I know 
call your girlfriend? His film work includes the soundtracks to "one 
fine day," Kevin costner's "tin cup," and the upcoming "down in the 
Delta." All that in addition to touring -- as a headliner and with 
everyone from bonnie raitt to Celine Dion. Along the way, keb' Mo', 
born Kevin Moore, picked up a host of awards, including a Grammy for 
his last release. With all this demand for the man and his music,

in check. You know, I'd like to stay centered and stay with who I 
am. I love to play and I love to write. And I love to do what I do. 
And I don't want anything, including my ego, to get in the way with 
me doing that. All that money holds ain't gonna buy babe Yet for all 
his popularity and acclaim, keb' Mo' does not see himself as a bluesman. 
No, a blues -- that's a heavy honor to really be a bluesman. I love 
the blues. I do the blues. But I don't -- I'm probably not consistent 
enough doing just blues, blues, blues, to be a blues artist. Although 
the singer/songwriter is grateful for the lesson, his blues heroes 
taught him about the message of the music. If you're talking about 
what's going on in your life chances are there's a Couple more people 
out there that are having the same experience. And then you don't 
feel like such an island anymore. The blues kind of brings everyone 
together. And these days keb' Mo' is the bridge that takes them there. 
And God knows I feel just like you Mark Scheerer, "CNN Entertainment 
News," New York.
