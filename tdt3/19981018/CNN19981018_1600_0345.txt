With the November midterm elections just over two weeks away democrats 
and republicans are airing their views on the race. Both sides are 
talking about how voters may react to wrangling over the budget and 
the decision to begin impeachment proceedings against president clinton. 
Not afraid of a backlash. What we're looking at is a constitutional 
process, and we're -- in fact, i'm proud of our republicans in the 
house because they are showing that they respect and Revere the constitution, 
and I wish more democrats would, frankly. Now, we have taken hits 
in the Congress and in governor's races, but I think the single thing 
that has changed the most is money and the power of money in politics. 
And the republican party, when it kills campaign finance reform, it 
does so because it is in their partisan interest for doing so. And 
if I were in Jim Nicholson's seat, I might have his view. Midterm 
elections will be held November 3rd.
