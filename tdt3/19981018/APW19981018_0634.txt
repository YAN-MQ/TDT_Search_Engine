In the attic of a roadside house, the bodies of three Serbian policemen 
lay awkwardly while a searchlight scanned the hillside for suspected 
ethnic Albanian rebels who lobbed the grenade. A few kilometers (miles) 
away, nine policemen smoked in the dark at a gas station-turned-checkpoint 
and waited for a possible guerrilla assault. The commander, a broad-shouldered 
27-year veteran who called himself Baja, complained that last week's 
peace agreement between President Slobodan Milosevic and Western powers 
threatening NATO airstrikes stopped his side from wiping out rebel 
strongholds in the Serbian province. New orders, he said, allow Serb 
police to return fire only when under attack, making his men sitting 
ducks while they secure the road to Dragobilje in central Kosovo, 
the front line of the last fighting. ``We missed the opportunity by 
a few days to complete everything,'' Baja said matter-of-factly, then 
pointed out a house 100 meters (yards) away where one of his men died 
in rebel gunfire this week. ``It's very difficult to work here under 
these circumstances. Sitting here, waiting for them to open fire on 
us ...'' he said, then paused. ``It's very difficult.'' The agreement 
was supposed to end the fighting in Kosovo, but the winding, hilly 
road from Orlate to Dragobilje clearly was a war zone Saturday night. 
Armored police vehicles patrolled darkened, seemingly empty villages, 
and journalists with a police escort drove without lights on under 
the moonless sky. Much of the world's attention has focused on the 
Serb offensive that decimated Albanian villages, sending thousands 
fleeing into the hills. With the harsh Balkan winter approaching, 
European powers and the United States combined to threaten the NATO 
airstrikes unless Milosevic halted the advance, withdrew forces sent 
into Kosovo in February and allowed unarmed observers and relief agencies 
full access to try to head off a humanitarian crisis. The rebel Kosovo 
Liberation Army, however, has rejected the agreement Milosevic reached 
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. Despite a cease-fire it declared 
earlier, the KLA appeared to step up attacks over the weekend, with 
the Serb Media Center in Pristina reporting more than a dozen. In 
Kosovo's propaganda-driven atmosphere, it was impossible to determine 
how many of the reports were true. But Associated Press journalists 
saw the aftermath of the grenade attack in Orlate, 30 kilometers (18 
miles) southwest of Pristina, as they returned from the police checkpoint 
at Dragobilje, ten kilometers (six miles) up the road. The three policemen 
killed were staying in a two-story house along the main road, a common 
practice in areas abandoned by Albanian residents. The grenade, either 
tossed or fired from a shoulder-held launcher, also seriously injured 
two other policemen. All three of the dead, still in uniform with 
their rifles in hand or near their bodies, appeared to have been crouching 
down as though under attack. A few full ammunition clips lay near 
patches of blood on the floor. ``These latest attacks show that the 
Albanian terrorists are trying by all possible means to prevent the 
realization of the Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement,'' Serbian local 
governor Veljko Odalovic said Sunday. ``This confirms what the international 
community has never wanted to admit _ that these bands of terrorists 
are not for a peaceful solution.'' Baja, speaking before the Orlate 
attack, said the rebels wanted to take advantage of Serb withdrawals 
to start new fighting that would prompt NATO to launch its threatened 
airstrikes on Yugoslav military targets. ``That's what they are trying 
to do _ use the agreement to open fire on us,'' he argued. ``They 
want to provoke us into a response, and get NATO to attack.'' Hydajet 
Hyseni, a spokesman for the United Democratic Movement, an ethnic 
Albanian party that supports the KLA, said Sunday that any violence 
was in response to attacks by Serb police. ``There is no real withdrawal 
of Serb armed forces from Kosovo, let alone demilitarization of Kosovo,'' 
he said. Hyseni claimed Serb forces still shell and loot Albanian 
villages and kill civilians. ``Sometimes, that seems to provoke a 
self-defense reaction of the harassed Albanians and action by KLA 
units,'' he said.
