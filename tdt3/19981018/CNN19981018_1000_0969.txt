The world's economic troubles may have some big investors running 
for cover. But most small investors are standing their ground. Tom 
bogdanowicz reports. Volatility in Europe's stock markets is high 
and the bears are out in force, but most small investors are staying 
out of the fray. At British stockbroker best investment, about 90% 
of investors are just holding onto their portfolios. The vast majority 
of investors are being very passive at the moment. They want to see 
whether or not this is a blip in the market or whether or not we're 
going to move to a sustained bear trend. In some countries, there 
are tax incentives which encourage investors to hold tight. Many small 
investors in Britain hold stocks through tax-free personal equity 
plans. By selling up, they loose that perk. In Germany, stocks held 
for six months are free of capital gains tax. Tax-free equity investments 
in France permit a switch to cash, but brokers say it's not taking 
place. Most small investors in our European markets are holding onto 
their investments. I think they're looking at the alternatives to 
equity investments, in particular, the low return on cash. They're 
not seeing alternatives, so they're sitting where they are. Instead 
of selling, some small investors are bargain hunting. German discount 
broker consors says buyers outnumbered Sellers in recent weeks. Retail 
broker Charles schwab Europe says bank shares are popular because 
of their sharp fall in prices. Defensive stocks, like utilities, are 
also in favor. Brokers say many small investors may show their true 
colors in December and january, after they've received statements 
that sum up the 1998 performance of their mutual funds and stock portfolios.
