In the pacific, typhoon zeb is now a tropical storm. But it did serious 
damage in Japan before its winds died down. Zeb is being blamed for 
at least 12 deaths in Japan and almost 100 more in taiwan and the 
Philippines. It's still positioned over the Japanese archipelago. 
The high winds forced the postponement of Japan's baseball championship, 
one of the country's most anticipated sporting events.
