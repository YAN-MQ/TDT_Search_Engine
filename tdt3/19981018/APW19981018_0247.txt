A local government fact-finding team has compiled reports of nearly 
820 soldiers and rebels killed or missing in a military operation 
against Islamic separatist rebels in Indonesia's northernmost province. 
T.S. Sani, chairman of the team in Aceh province, was quoted Sunday 
by the official Antara news agency as saying 344 were reported killed 
and 475 missing. It was the third separate count in the area. All 
have come up with totals of at least 760. The local team was set up 
in September following reports by a human rights group on the findings 
of mass graves in the regencies of North and East Aceh. Based on reports 
from local people, Sani said, 1,082 people had been tortured, with 
72 of them left disabled. Earlier, the National Commission on Human 
Rights had concluded that 781 people had been killed and at least 
another 160 were still missing. The Indonesian military said last 
month that for the 1990-98 period, its own fact-finding team had counted 
760 deaths _ 406 rebels, 111 soldiers and 243 civilians killed by 
rebels. The local team said the military operation had made a traumatic 
impact on the villagers, especially in its early years, 1989-1992. 
Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto decided in August to end the military 
operation and withdrew troops from the tip of Sumatra Island, about 
1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta. Aceh, a predominantly 
Muslim province, is one of three Indonesian provinces where separatist 
rebels are fighting for independence. Sani did not rule out possible 
increases in the death toll as more reports come in from the local 
people.
