There will be no lasting peace in the Middle East until the status 
of Jerusalem is decided, the Vatican's foreign minister, Monsignor 
Jean Louis Tauran, said Sunday. Speaking to reporters after meeting 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Tauran said the peace process cannot 
remain stalled as the people of the region, especially the Palestinians, 
were suffering. Tauran's meeting with Mubarak and, later, with Egyptian 
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa came as U.S. President Bill Clinton tried 
to advance Israeli-Palestinian negotiations at a special summit outside 
Washington. ``The peace to which the people of the region are aspiring 
cannot be realistically achieved if (they) are not convinced of it,'' 
Tauran said after his talks with Moussa. It ``is not possible to achieve 
security (for one party) at the expense of the other,'' Egypt's official 
Middle East News Agency quoted him as saying. Tauran reiterated the 
Vatican's position that Jerusalem _ a city revered by Muslims, Jews 
and Christians _ should be open to all faiths and not just ``to one 
side.'' The Vatican has ``grave concerns over what is happening to 
Jerusalem,'' MENA reported Tauran as saying. ``We see the city exposed 
to change day after day, and I believe that the international community 
... must work to preserve the sanctity and uniqueness of this city.'' 
Christians and Muslims have long charged that Israeli control of the 
city has put limits on the ability of Christians and Muslims to worship 
freely at their holy sites. The Palestinians want Arab east Jerusalem 
as the capital of their would-be state. But Israel, which captured 
the Arab sector in the 1967 Middle East War and later annexed it, 
has rejected this. After his meeting with Mubarak, Tauran met Mohammed 
Sayed el-Tantawi, the head of Al-Azhar, the leading religious institution 
in the Sunni Muslim world.
