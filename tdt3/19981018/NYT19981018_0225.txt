Dr. Samuel J. Messick, a leader in educational testing who argued 
for restraint in the use of student test scores, died Oct. 6 at the 
University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in Philadelphia. He was 
67 and lived in Pennington, N.J. The cause was congestive heart failure, 
family members said. Messick spent his career with the Educational 
Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., retired as a vice president and 
assumed the position, created for him, of distinguished research scientist. 
``He was in the forefront of the mathematics and statistics of psychometrics,'' 
said Dr. Henry Chauncey, who became the first president of the testing 
service in 1947. ``But he also knew how the educational system worked, 
its values, and what impact testing could have on schools and colleges.'' 
Messick's research helped shape the SAT, a crucial part of college 
admissions, which the testing service creates and administers for 
the College Board. But he cautioned that the scores should be kept 
in perspective. When the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
wanted to use test scores to set an absolute cutoff for playing sports, 
Messick resisted, arguing for use of scores only with other indicators. 
Messick wrote 20 books and 175 scholarly articles, many arguing that 
testing should never be used to discriminate against children from 
disadvantaged backgrounds, who tend to score below more affluent counterparts 
on standardized tests. Samuel James Messick grew up in Philadelphia, 
the son of a police officer who died when Messick was a child. He 
studied psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating 
with a B.A. in 1950, he went on to study at Princeton and became a 
fellow at the testing service. After he received his M.A. and Ph.D. 
at Princeton, he joined the staff of the testing service. Survivors 
include his wife of 46 years, Betty Messick; sons Jonathan of Long 
Branch, N.J.; and Christopher of Ewing Township, N.J.; daughters Marjorie 
Hurley of Blue Bell, Pa., and Kathy Mora of Ewing Township, N.J., 
and six grandchildren.
