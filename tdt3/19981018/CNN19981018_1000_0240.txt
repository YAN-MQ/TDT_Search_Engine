There are signs Yugoslavia is living up to its promises about Kosovo, 
but serbs and ethnic Albanians are blaming each other for new shooting 
attacks that underscore the shakiness of the cease-fire agreement. 
NATO U-2 reconnaissance planes began flying over the province yesterday. 
U.S. officials say they revealed clear indications that Yugoslav president 
slobodan Milosevic is pulling back at least two of seven Serb battalions 
from Kosovo. The surveillance also showed improved access for relief 
workers. NATO has extended its original deadline for compliance, after 
which the possibility of air strikes could be renewed. What was the 
option there? Bomb or give them another ten days? I don't think anyone 
really wants to have to bomb and send in missiles. That seems clear. 
I think it's reasonable to give them more time to get the units out, 
but I think we ought to be very strict and know which units we want 
to leave and tracking them as they leave and making sure they are 
fully and firmly outside of Kosovo. An advance team of 2,000 international 
observers has arrived in Kosovo.
