A federal judge has temporarily banned production of a device that 
downloads and plays computer music files, including pirated songs. 
Major record companies sought the ban against diamond multimedia systems 
because they claim the Rio portable MP-3 violates a 1992 law that 
protects the industry against piracy. The palm-sized Rio was scheduled 
to hit the market next month. It plugs into a computer and can save 
and replay nearly an hour of cD-quality music.
