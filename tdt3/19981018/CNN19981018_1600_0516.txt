I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"Headline News forecast." Flash flood watches and warnings in effect 
for just about all of east texas, all the way into the Rio Grande 
valley of Texas, in to the gulf coast and as far north as Oklahoma. 
This due to very heavy rainfall on Saturday and expected heavy rainfall 
on sunday as well. The rainfall due to a frontal system that is dropping 
very heavy rain from arkansas into Texas, the tail end of that front, 
near Texas, becoming stationary. And while we're seeing light showers 
along that frontal boundary through the Ohio valley into the Great 
Lakes, the rest of the nation is looking absolutely beautiful on Sunday. 
And that's going to be the case on Monday. By Monday afternoon, we'll 
see some clouds in the northeast as a front pushes through dry, and 
the rain will finally begin to recede by Monday evening. By Monday 
night, we'll see some heavy rainfall around Brownsville, Texas, and 
lighter rain forming over the southern Rockies. Highs for Sunday, 
in the 40s and 50s over the northern plains and the northern Rockies. 
Otherwise, 60s and 70s, a few 80s in the deep south. And remember, 
you can get your four-day forecast for 6,100 cities at cNN.com.
