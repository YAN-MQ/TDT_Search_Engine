Since its beginning, the Hamptons International Film Festival here 
has been searching for an identity, and perhaps it has found one. 
Begun in 1993 as a memorial to Time Warner Chairman Steven Ross, the 
five-day event sought to become an incubator for innovative new work. 
But coming on the heels of major festivals in Venice, Toronto and 
New York, the Hamptons festival was not viewed as a major player, 
and its programming choices were often seen as too esoteric. The organizers 
``tried to support very adventurous films that were not going to find 
distribution,'' said David Schwartz, director of programming and the 
fifth person to fill that role in the festival's six years. ``There 
was a seriousness about it that didn't create the most festive atmosphere.'' 
This time, as they prepared for the festival, which ended Sunday night, 
the organizers decided to lighten up. They did not worry so much about 
whether a film had been seen at another festival. And in contrast 
to many recent festivals at which dark films have predominated, they 
chose comedy as one of their themes. The event opened with ``Living 
Out Loud,'' a romance between the jilted wife of a Fifth Avenue doctor 
(Holly Hunter) and an elevator operator (Danny DeVito). ``If you go 
to a film festival in the Hamptons, you should have some fun,'' said 
Schwartz, the chief curator of film and video at the American Museum 
of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens. Indeed, some of the festival's 
biggest crowd-pleasers were comedies. One of them, ``With Friends 
Like These,'' is about a group of Italian-American character actors 
who are weary of playing thugs and hit men and yearn to be the next 
Robert De Niro or Al Pacino. The movie, which has toured the festival 
circuit but has yet to find a distributor, has an ensemble cast, including 
Adam Arkin, Robert Costanza and David Strathairn. The actors ``worked 
for next to nothing'' on the film, which cost less than $5 million 
to make, said director Philip Messina. Blake Edwards, a director and 
writer of dozens of comedies, who has a home in Sagaponack, N.Y., 
was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by Lauren Bacall at 
a ceremony on Saturday in the Guild Theater here. Edwards, 76, delivered 
some funny lines himself. Working with Peter Sellers on half a dozen 
movies, including the ``Pink Panther'' series, could be exasperating, 
he said, because the actor often called him late at night to say he 
had just received instructions from God on how to play a scene. Once, 
Edwards said, Sellers fled in a huff for several days after the director 
told him, ``Do me a favor: tell God to stay out of show business.'' 
Sellers starred in ``The Party,'' a 1968 film directed by Edwards 
that was screened as part of an archival series that included several 
classic comedies, among them Billy Wilder's ``Some Like It Hot,'' 
Charlie Chaplin's ``City Lights'' and Richard Lester's ``Help!'' as 
well as the 1981 independent film ``My Dinner With Andre.'' That film's 
stars, Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn, engaged in another conversation 
after the screening before going off to yet another dinner. At his 
tribute, Edwards, whose 1981 film ``S.O.B.'' savaged Hollywood, drew 
laughter and applause when he boasted, ``I'm the only director who 
has actually challenged three studio heads to step outside.'' Studio 
executives were also vilified in a panel discussion earlier in the 
day, when Lester and another veteran comedy director, Alex Cox, traded 
pointers and observations with three younger filmmakers. Cox recalled 
that studio executives did not know what to make of his 1984 ``Repo 
Man'' and caused tremendous anxiety by talking on the telephone and 
paying little attention when the film was shown to them. It went on 
to become a cult favorite. ``I would like to say that since then, 
it's just been a bed of roses,'' Cox said. ``But in fact it's all 
always the same.'' Seeing five people walk out of a screening ``is 
like a dagger in your heart,'' he said. Cox's latest film, ``Three 
Businessmen,'' had its premiere at the festival before what Schwartz 
described as an appreciative audience. The winner of the festival's 
Golden Starfish Award for best independent film by an emerging American 
filmmaker was ``Edge City,'' Eugene Martin's ``hip-hop opera'' about 
Philadelphia teen-agers. The documentary award went to Ruth Leitman's 
``Alma,'' the story of a Southern woman's struggle with her mentally 
ill mother and abusive father. Although no overall attendance figure 
was available, about 20,000 tickets were sold to the 50 movies screened 
this year, and more film industry representatives showed up than in 
1997, said Denise Kasell, executive director. As a sign that the festival 
may finally be finding its groove, she said she and Schwartz had signed 
contracts to run the event next year.
