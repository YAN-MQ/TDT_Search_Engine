Volunteers used trucks to save six stricken whales Sunday, while dozens 
more died after becoming stuck in shallow waters off Australia's southern 
island of Tasmania. A pod of about 100 pilot whales hit trouble near 
Blackman's Bay and 24 died. Later, 60 whales beached farther north 
at Orford, and most perished. Those saved by the trucks were carried 
45 minutes by road to be released into the open sea. The drama began 
Saturday morning when 56 whales, the biggest nearly 7 meters (23 feet) 
long, beached themselves at Marion Bay. Aside from 21 that died, rescuers 
managed to get the rest out to sea to join the large pod, using boats 
to turn back any that tried to return to shore. Rangers also took 
a whale calf into deeper water and turned its head toward shore in 
the hope that its distress calls would attract others. Four adults 
came. ``I've never seen this technique used before but it got at least 
four back out,'' Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service director Max 
Kitchell said. ``We learn something each time with these strandings.'' 
But instead of heading to the safety of open sea, the reunited pod 
turned toward the narrow entrance of Blackman's Bay Saturday night. 
Despite efforts to head them off, about 50 became trapped in shallow 
water, wallowing helplessly. Nine became stranded on a sand bar where 
three died, and the rest were moved back to sea at first light Sunday. 
Rangers decided to truck them to Eaglehawk Neck, where they could 
be released into open sea. Calves were lifted on to trailers and driven 
off. Hydraulic lifts on the back of flatbed trucks had to be used 
for the adults, which were lowered on to foam mattresses, covered 
with sacks and strapped down. During the drive, five volunteers rode 
precariously on the truck's back, continually sluicing the whales 
down with buckets of water. At the end of one drive, one whale heaved 
and almost went over the side of the truck on to a concrete launching 
ramp. Pat Deprez, one of the volunteers who stayed with a whale throughout 
its truck rescue, said it was agitated when he first reached it in 
the water at Blackman's Bay. But it calmed down as it was moved closer 
to other whales and they could talk to each other. ``If it got a bit 
distressed (on the truck), we'd give it a pat and that seemed to help 
it,'' Deprez said. A group of surfers also helped with a couple of 
the stronger whales. Andrew Campbell twice pushed, cajoled and swam 
with a whale until it was back in open water. ``It was very hard at 
first but once the whale got into deeper water it quickly rejuvenated 
and then I hung on and went for the ride,'' he said. ``If it went 
off course, I'd give it a push. It seemed to know what I was trying 
to do. Anyway it always responded.'' Campbell stayed with each whale 
until it was well beyond the mouth of the bay. Then came the news 
from Orford, 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the north, that more than 
60 more whales had beached themselves there and most of them had died. 
``Then just as we think we've got it under control, we get a kick 
in the guts,'' Kitchell said. He didn't know if the 60 that beached 
there were part of the same pod. He said all but about 10 were dead 
by the time rangers reached them, which suggested they had been ashore 
for some time before being found.
