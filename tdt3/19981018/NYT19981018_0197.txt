On the third and final day of talks between Indian and Pakistani diplomats, 
the world's two newest nuclear powers announced Sunday that they had 
agreed only to keep talking to each other about ways to reduce the 
risk of nuclear conflict between them. The foreign secretaries of 
the rival nations presented proposals designed to help dispel the 
mistrust and enmity that have characterized their relationship since 
British India was divided into Pakistan and India 51 years ago. But 
no agreement was reached on even on the most modest of them. The two 
sides said they would meet again in New Delhi in February to continue 
the conversation and claimed a small victory from the simple fact 
that they have been sitting down in the same room to discuss their 
differences. Ever since India, and then Pakistan, exploded nuclear 
devices in May, the other nuclear powers have been putting pressure 
on them to restart talks that stalled a year ago. Pakistanis themselves 
have repeatedly said Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim territory in 
the Himalayas that both countries claim, could become a nuclear flash 
point. Pakistan controls a sliver of Kashmir and India most of the 
rest, and the countries regularly exchange fire across the line that 
divides the parts of Kashmir that each controls. India and Pakistan 
have fought three wars, two of them over Kashmir. India, which has 
already committed itself to a policy of no first use of nuclear weapons, 
asked Pakistan to adopt the same doctrine, an Indian official said, 
speaking on the condition of anonymity. But Pakistan refused on grounds 
that it needs the nuclear threat to counter India's superior conventional 
military forces. Pakistan in turn proposed that the two nations sign 
a nonaggression pact, with a provision to set up a process for the 
resolution of disputes, with third-party mediation in cases Pakistan 
and India could not resolve on their own. But India, which has ruled 
out international mediation on Kashmir, rejected the Pakistani proposal.
