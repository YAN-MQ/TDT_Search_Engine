Nearly dlrs 1.5 trillion are traded on the world's foreign exchange 
markets every day, 25 percent higher than three years ago, according 
to a central bankers' survey released Sunday. London remained the 
world's leading financial center. Its share of total foreign exchange 
turnover rose to 32 percent from 30 percent in the previous study 
in 1995, said the Bank for International Settlements. Second-placed 
New York also advanced. Its share of transactions rose to 18 percent 
from 16 percent. But the Japanese market declined from 10 to 8 percent. 
The dollar dominated the market, the study said. It was involved in 
87 percent of foreign currency activity, compared with 83 percent 
three years before. The BIS report said the average amount of money 
traded each day rose from dlrs 1.19 trillion in 1995 to dlrs 1.49 
trillion in April 1998, when the survey was conducted. The figures 
include spot transactions, outright forwards and foreign exchange 
swaps. The BIS used data from 43 countries for its report, conducted 
every three years. The Basel-based organization groups central banks 
worldwide.
