At the Vatican today, tens of thousands of people helped Pope John 
Paul celebrate his 20th anniversary as Pontiff. John Paul looked tired 
at today's mass in St. Peter's square, but he spoke in a strong voice 
as he thanked the crowd for their support. Wearing gold-colored robes 
and sitting on an Altar covered in Flowers, the pope also asked for 
prayers to keep him going so he can carry out his mission. At age 
78, John Paul is one of a small group of popes to survive 20 years 
as Pontiff. He has traveled more miles than any of his predecessors. 
And he also survived an assassination attempt.
