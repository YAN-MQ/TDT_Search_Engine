All Keyshawn Johnson has ever wanted is to be the star. ``Do you think 
that just because I haven't done it on `Monday Night Football,' I 
haven't done it?'' the Jets receiver asks. He knows the answer. He 
smiles. It has been six years since the Jets have been considered 
good enough to get on the Monday night schedule. That was so long 
ago in football terms that only two players on their roster have played 
in a Monday night game. But Johnson and his teammates will get their 
chance Monday when they face the New England Patriots in Foxboro, 
Mass. Johnson may have had something to do with getting them into 
a Monday night game in his third season, but he looks at it as merely 
a chance for most of America to see what he can do. It is not a big 
game for him _ it is a big game for everyone watching. ``I've played 
well on national TV,'' he said. ``I've done well on regional games. 
If you took the San Francisco game and put it on Monday night, people 
would go, `Ooh!' '' In the season opener against the 49ers, Johnson 
snared nine passes for 126 yards and two touchdowns. ``What about 
my rookie year at Arizona?'' he asked, referring to his seven receptions 
for 94 yards and a touchdown in the one game the Jets won that season. 
``Or the over-the-shoulder, one-handed catch against Miami last year?'' 
he continued. ``If it was on Monday night, would people talk about 
it as the greatest catch of all time?'' In other words, Johnson believes 
he has already done the great things. Now it is time for everyone 
else to recognize it. ``Maybe the stage is set,'' he said. ``I don't 
know.'' Words aside, he has accomplished many things in two-plus seasons: 
_ His five receiving touchdowns this season are tied for the American 
Football Conference lead. _ In his only two prime-time appearances, 
both on Sunday nights over the TNT cable network, he has a total 14 
catches for 136 yards and a touchdown. _ In four starts against the 
Patriots, he has caught 21 passes, produced 263 yards and scored twice. 
_ He has more receptions (157) than any other receiver has had in 
his first 35 games. ``People heard about me, maybe, but did they know 
about me before the Rose Bowl?'' he asked as he considered the impact 
of national television on a career. ``Was I any better because of 
the Rose Bowl?'' In that 1996 game against Northwestern, he grabbed 
12 passes for a Rose Bowl record 216 yards and one touchdown. It was 
his eighth performance of at least 100 receiving yards that season 
for Southern California. Three and a half months later, the Jets made 
him the overall No. 1 pick in the draft. ``What makes people think 
you're the best?'' he asked rhetorically. ``Do you get more credit 
if you haven't written a book?'' In that once infamous and now largely 
forgotten book about his rookie season (''Just Give Me the Damn Ball!''), 
Johnson besmirched quarterback Neil O'Donnell as a ``stiff puppet.'' 
As a result of the book, and his own exuberance when talking about 
himself, people raised the bar in assessing Johnson's accomplishments. 
Until he did it, and did it big, many people were withholding judgment. 
Yet, in 35 games as a pro, he ranks second only to Jerry Rice in touchdowns 
(18) and yards (2,141). And Johnson loves the current quarterback 
duo of Vinny Testaverde and Glenn Foley, explaining, ``They know who 
the person is to get the ball to.'' Testaverde says he is not concerned 
with what the Patriots are doing. He notes that he also has such offensive 
threats as Johnson and running back Curtis Martin and says, ``If we 
do our job well, we'll succeed.'' Foley, who has been demoted but 
always sought Johnson out, is fond of saying, ``Keyshawn is the first 
guy I think of.'' Johnson is a talker on the field, although he usually 
says the defender starts the talk. It's when he responds that the 
shouting escalates. Asked about the tremendous year that Patriots 
cornerback Ty Law has had _ including four interceptions _ Johnson 
responded: ``What makes him having a tremendous year? Who did he get 
the interceptions against? Were there any Hail Mary's in there?'' 
As for his own touchdowns, Johnson said: ``Where did my five touchdowns 
come _ in garbage time? I don't want the rock in garbage time.'' He 
laughs off defenders such as the Giants' Tito Wooten, who said after 
a preseason game that Johnson had bragged of being a gang member. 
Or Terrell Buckley of the Dolphins, who tossed an end-zone pylon after 
Johnson scored against him. ``I'm always smiling at them and having 
fun,'' Johnson said. ``Even when Terrell Buckley threw that pylon 
at me, I smiled.'' The 6-foot-3-inch, 215-pound Johnson added: ``Most 
people start talking to me. I don't need to talk to anyone. It's just 
like I don't need steroids to dominate you.'' A smile has always been 
his umbrella against those he believes do not understand him, or do 
not believe in him, or want him to fail. ``I've always been like that,'' 
Johnson said. ``A lot of times in my life people didn't take me seriously. 
They didn't think I'd go to college, or they didn't think I'd graduate. 
So I laugh. I don't want to make the people seem foolish. I just want 
them to know, it's a foolish thing to think I can't do something.'' 
As he said, the stage is set.
