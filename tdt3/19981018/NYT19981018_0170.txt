When Dave Brown trotted onto the field at Giants Stadium with 6 minutes 
12 seconds left in the game Sunday, he got roughly the same reaction 
from the fans that he had received in his final year as a Giant: He 
was booed heartily. A hometown boy who never quite made good enough, 
the only cheers for Brown came when the referee announced a roughing-the-passer 
call that had crushed him to the turf. Brown had left the Giants on 
April 29, an anticlimactic departure, when he signed as an unrestricted 
free agent with the Arizona Cardinals. Now, he came back to fill out 
the final minutes of garbage time in a 34-7 loss. ``The fans got their 
money's worth today,'' Brown said. ``They saw the Giants win and me 
get in the game. It's typical. I thought they'd react that way and 
they did.'' He developed that callused exterior during six seasons 
in New York, taking almost as many hits from the fans and news media 
as he did from the opposition. After joining the Giants as a supplemental 
first-round pick in 1992, he took over at quarterback from Phil Simms 
in 1994. Simms took his two championship trophies and his hard-earned 
place in New York's heart, leaving Brown with shoes he would never 
fill. Brown was 23-30 as a starter. It may not all have been his fault, 
but teammates bristled at what they saw as his refusal to take the 
blame. He won his last full game as Giants quarterback, beating New 
Orleans on Sept. 28, 1997, but on the final series, he took a hit 
from cornerback Alex Molden and tore a chest muscle. Brown started 
the next game against Dallas, but when he took another hit, Danny 
Kanell took his place. Brown spent four weeks recovering, snapping 
a streak of 44 consecutive games started, and the job was Kanell's. 
``I think it was a situation where I followed a legend in Phil Simms 
on a deteriorating team,'' Brown said. ``They had to make a change 
and I think we kind of bottomed out, and then we started getting better. 
When Jim Fassel came here, I think he came at a great time. We were 
starting to get a better team, a better defense. Everywhere you go 
there has to be a bridge between the legend and somebody else. Unfortunately, 
I was that bridge, I think.'' The wounds still showed Sunday: Brown 
received few greetings from his old teammates and mostly derision 
from the fans in a stadium close to where he grew up in Westfield, 
N.J. He played one series in relief of Jake Plummer, completing two 
of five passes for 31 yards. On Brown's third play, Keith Hamilton 
was whistled for roughing him. Two plays later, the Giants jumped 
offside, but the blitzing safety Percy Ellsworth hit Brown hard anyway. 
Aided by the penalties, Brown drove the Cardinals to the Giants' 19. 
But on fourth-and-3, Brown was sacked to end the threat. ``You never 
like to get in that way, when it's a loss like that,'' Brown said. 
``But it's the first time I've played in a while so it felt kind of 
fun being out there. I had butterflies, sure. You want to play well 
against your old team. Hopefully I did that. I would have liked to 
had a touchdown at the end of the game, but still, it's garbage time. 
It doesn't really matter.'' It was Brown's first action with Arizona, 
coming because Plummer struggled. But Brown has no illusions about 
doing what Kanell did, snatching the starting job. ``Jake's the guy,'' 
Brown said. ``Jake's proven he's a winner. I was brought out here 
to help him and kind of assist him in any way possible.''
