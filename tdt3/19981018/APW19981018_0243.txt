Hungarians voted Sunday in nationwide municipal elections which are 
seen as a popularity test of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's center-right 
government. More than 101,000 candidates, including 48,000 independents, 
ran for posts in local government bodies. Polls opened at 6 a.m. (05:00 
GMT) in the country's 3,153 municipalities for the 8,155,169 eligible 
voters. Early turnout figures (at 11 a.m., 10.00 GMT) showed that 
15.5 percent of the voters had cast their ballots, which was slightly 
higher than in 1994. Of all the parties, the most candidates were 
entered by the Hungarian Socialist Party. The Socialists, the biggest 
opposition party, are especially strong in settlements with over 10,000 
inhabitants. But the Independent Smallholders Party, the junior partner 
in the ruling coalition, nominated the most candidates for the post 
of mayor. In the capital Budapest, the last liberal stronghold, Mayor 
Gabor Demszky of the Free Democrats has two competitors, the candidate 
of the coalition, Laszlo Latorcai, and Pal Kollath of the Workers 
(communist) Party. According to a Szonda Ipsos survey conducted between 
Sept. 26 and Oct. 2, Demszky has a 55-60 percent support, while Latorcai 
40 percent. The margin of error was between 3 and 3.5 percent. Demszky 
enjoys the support of the Socialists, too, and they had withdrawn 
their candidate in Demszky's favor. In small places, however, party 
affiliations are not as important as in bigger towns. In 1994, 83.7 
percent of all elected mayors were independent. Prime Minister Viktor 
Orban and Agriculture Minister Jozsef Torgyan have repeatedly warned 
that only those municipalities will enjoy advantages of the central 
development budget where the local government bodies are loyal to 
them. Popularity of the coalition is still strong, as shown by a poll 
taken by the Szazadveg Institute in the third week of September with 
1,500 respondents. The margin of error was 2.5 percent. The Young 
Democrats were in the first place with 51 percent, followed by the 
Socialists, with 31 percent. The Smallholders had seven percent, and 
the liberal Free Democrats five percent.
