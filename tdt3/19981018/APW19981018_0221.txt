John McEnroe was in familiar territory Sunday _ winning a tournament 
and then having to defend himself after bursts of offensive behaviour. 
McEnroe beat Frenchman Henri Leconte 6-4, 6-2 in the Champions seniors 
tennis final, but the result of a barely-serious event for past-their-peak 
former greats was incidental. McEnroe ensured he would be center of 
attention whatever happened on court when he swore at an umpire, semi-final 
opponent Mikael Pernfors and the crowd. ``If I break the rules and 
someone has the balls to bust me than let them do it,'' McEnroe said 
Sunday. ``It's exactly what people want but then they get mad at me. 
That was nothing compared to what I am capable of.'' McEnroe said 
tennis needed an overhaul and referees and officials should be held 
more accountable for their actions. ``Fun is not making bad calls, 
I don't see the fun in that,'' McEnroe said. ``We've butchered the 
game to the point where almost no-one cares _ let's see if we can 
do something about it.'' Most of McEnroe's opponents on the seniors 
tour take it at face value _ they kid with the crowd and each other, 
keeping it light. But just like the old days, when McEnroe could still 
play at a high level, few of his rivals are prepared to question his 
behaviour. Leconte made an effort, saying there should be rules in 
place in seniors to combat misbehaviour. ``At the moment anything 
can happen,'' Leconte said. ``There should be some rules, the referees 
deserve some respect.'' With seven tournaments remaining in the seniors' 
tour, McEnroe is 50 points clear of Jimmy Connors in the overall standings. 
All players from Sydney now head to Melbourne for the champions tournament 
beginning Wednesday. In an all-Australian final of the doubles Johan 
Kriek and John Fitzgerald defeated Mark Edmonson and Wally Masur 6-3 
4-6 10-5.
