Plenty of early games on the slate in the NFL. We start in Buffalo, 
where former cfl Phenom Doug Flutie is making his first start in nine 
years. The falcons are hoping to fly to their first 5-1 start since 
1986. The Redskins are looking for their first win, while the Vikings 
are on a Quest to stay undefeated. East Rutherford showcases a critical 
NFC east matchup between the Cardinals and giants. The Panthers are 
still trying to claw to their first win. Rod Woodson is back in Pittsburgh 
for the first time since leaving the steelers. And Tennessee and Cincinnati 
both gun for win number three in Nashville.
