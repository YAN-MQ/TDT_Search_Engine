Pete Sampras has taken a step toward holding onto the world's top 
ranking in tennis through the end of the year. He stopped Slovakia's 
karol kucera 6-3, 7-6, 6-1 today to win the ca trophy tournament in 
Austria. Marcelo Rios says he's out to regain the world's number one 
ranking. He laid down a good foundation toward that goal by beating 
Australia's Mark woodforde in the final of the Swiss open. The numbers 
-- 6-4, 6-2. Rios will likely pass Patrick Rafter and move into the 
number two spot in the world when the new rankings are released tomorrow. 
On the ladies' side -- top-ranked Lindsay Davenport has become the 
first woman this year to win six tourney titles. She beat Venus Williams 
7-5, 6-3 in the finale of the European championships. Anthony Keith 
James, "Headline Sports."
