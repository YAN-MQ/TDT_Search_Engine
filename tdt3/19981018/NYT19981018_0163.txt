NATIONAL FORECAST A cold front heralding a return to more seasonable 
weather will sweep through the Northeast early Monday with nothing 
more than some sprinkles and gusty winds. Returning sunshine along 
the coast will combine with dry winds descending the Appalachians 
to raise afternoon readings more than 10 degrees above normal. However, 
temperatures will slip back to seasonal levels Monday night. As cooler 
air pushes into the mountains of New England, a few showers will develop 
Monday afternoon. A second surge of much cooler weather will trigger 
widespread showers in the northern and central Great Lakes. Funnel 
clouds are possible as the coolest air of the season passes over the 
unusually warm northern Lakes. Very warm air will cover the Southeast 
with near record highs in the southern Appalachians. A cold front 
will stall as it moves into the Gulf States. Some showers will dampen 
the region from eastern Tennessee to Louisiana. A large disturbance 
in the northwest Caribbean should bring clouds and some rain to south 
Florida. Heavy showers will linger over southernmost Texas, but drier 
and cooler air will push into the northern half of the state. A return 
air flow from the southeast will ascend the southern Rockies causing 
clouds and rain to develop. Tropical moisture from a Pacific hurricane 
may be drawn into the southern Rockies as a weak disturbance develops 
over California. High pressure stretching from the Plains northwest 
to British Columbia will keep much of the West dry with chilly nights 
and warmer days. Offshore winds will bring warmth to northern California. 
Focus: The Flooded Alamo A deluge on San Antonio during Saturday brought 
11.26 inches of rain to the city, setting a record for the wettest 
day ever and making this the soggiest October on record. The monthly 
tally reached over 16 inches by daybreak Sunday pushing this month 
into first place for the wettest month. A slow-moving cold front became 
the focal point of heavy thunderstorms as the front finally stalled 
over the hill country of south Texas. A plume of high- level moisture 
from hurricane Madeline near Baja California streamed over Mexico 
and added to the potent thunderstorms in south Texas.
