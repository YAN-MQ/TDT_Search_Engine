This is Orelon Sidney from the CNN weather center with your "Headline 
News weather update." Heavy rain and some snow is expected across 
Ontario and Quebec, as a cold front moves across eastern Canada and 
the northeastern U.S. continuing chance of rain stretches from upstate 
New York, southward through the virginias and into the carolinas. 
The front will become stationary from northern Georgia, through Texas, 
into New Mexico, with heavy rain possible across south and western 
Texas into New Mexico and southern Colorado. Another cold front will 
be moving through the Great Lakes. Look for a chance of rain and snow 
associated with this system. High temperatures in Anchorage today 
will be near 40 with rain. Juneau has a near 100% chance of rain, 
with a high of 46. Morning showers are possible across the Hawaiian 
islands with highs in the low to middle 80s. Most of the nation will 
see 60s, 70s or 80s in the forecast today, from the northeast through 
the central and southern plains into the southwest. Temperatures across 
the northern Rockies and the northern plains will be in the 40s and 
the 50s. The forecast for more than 6,000 cities can be found at CNN.com.
