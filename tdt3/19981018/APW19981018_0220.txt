Spain's Severiano Ballesteros on Sunday launched a stinging attack 
on the granting of Order of Merit and Ryder Cup points to the new 
World Golf Championship events to be inaugurated next year. ``This 
is the most ridiculous decision the European Tour has ever made, '' 
the Spanish star said. ``It is simply not fair. There's so much money 
to be won and only a few European players will be there. Ninety percent 
of European players against this.'' The World Golf Championship will 
consist of three events in 1999 to which a fourth will be added in 
the year 2,000. Each event offers a 5 million dollar prize-fund, with 
the winner's check as yet undecided. ``A player could win one of these 
tournaments and win the Order of Merit. That has to be wrong,'' Ballesteros 
said. Next year the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship is 
scheduled for February 24 through 28 at La Costa resort, Carlsbad, 
Calif, to be followed by the NEC Invitational at Firestone Country 
Club, Akron, Ohio August 26 through 29 and the American Stroke Play 
Championship at Valderrama, Spain November 4-7. In the year 2,000 
the World Cup Team Championship will be added to the schedule. Only 
the Match Play Championship will count towards the Ryder Cup points 
next year. Players will qualify for the the Match Play through their 
World rankings. The other limited-field events will use various criteria 
including world rankings, Ryder Cup and President's Cup selections 
and Tour rankings. The Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship 
will offer 64 slots in the line-up. Currently only nine European players 
figure in the top-65 of the World Rankings and only 16 in the top-100. 
``We must have a players' meeting about this on the Tuesday before 
the Volvo Masters in Valderrama at the end of the month,'' Ballesteros 
stressed. ``Something has to change. These qualifications must not 
happen. They will not happen,'' he said. Ballesteros has dropped out 
of the world top-200 and currently stands 116 in Europe.
