Paula Jones said this weekend she wants $2 million to drop her sexual 
misconduct suit against President Clinton. $1 million would come from 
the president himself, and that's a price tag he has rejected in the 
past. If the two sides cannot make a deal, a judge will consider, 
this week, whether Jones' case should be reinstated. ABC's Tim O'Brien 
assesses her chances. Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit was thrown 
out after the judge, Susan Webber Wright, ruled that even if the charges 
against Bill clinton were true, Jones could not show she was adversely 
affected at work. I was shocked, because I believe what Mr. Clinton 
did to me was wrong. Three months later, in a landmark decision involving 
another woman, Kimberly Ellerth, the Supreme Court ruled victims of 
sexual harassment do not have to prove adverse job consequences in 
order to sue. This Tuesday, lawyers for Paula Jones will tell a federal 
appeals court in st. Paul, Minnesota, that judge Wright's decision 
is so at odds with the supreme the Jones suit must be reinstated. 
That's all we're asking, is that -- let us go back now and try our 
facts, and have an actual jury hear some of these issues. But the 
Jones case may turn on yet another landmark ruling involving this 
woman, mechelle vinson. It was in vinson's case in 1986 that the Supreme 
Court first ruled sexual harassment is illegal discrimination. The 
court said the harassment must be severe or pervasive. In the Jones 
case, judge Wright ruled the harassment Clinton is accused of was 
neither. Jones' lawyers disagree. It's severe or pervasive in the 
sense that when she went back to work, she was isolated. She was moved. 
She didn't get the same treatment that other women got in the office. 
She felt totally isolated. Jones' lawyers will also argue their lawsuit 
should be reinstated because the president may have committed perjury 
in his deposition in the case. But if the court concludes no reasonable 
jury could find the harassment jones alleges was severe or pervasive, 
then there is no case. And, at least in this forum, whether the president 
committed perjury would be irrelevant. Tim O'Brien, ABC News, at the 
White House.
