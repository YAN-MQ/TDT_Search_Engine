Duane Walker, "Headline Sports." The Yankees overcame a three-run 
deficit to defeat the padres 9-6 in game one of the world series. 
Chuck knoblauch hit a three-run homer. I knew eventually I'd come 
up in a big situation and get a big hit to help the team win. I have 
been taking it game by game and it's a big relief to get a hit today 
and help the team win.
