We'll tell you who's out in front in the fall classic and why, next 
in "Headline Sports." no, it's not a keyhole. I'm not looking through 
the doorway at someone. I'm looking through the on-net port. Port 
of entry to a seamless global network. A network that will change 
the fortunes of countless companies and the lives of thousands of 
Telecom managers and CIOs. I see them out there, right now. They seem... 
rather happy. On-net. From MCI Worldcom. There is no limit to where 
it can take you. A leather trimmed and preferred suede interior... 
heated front seats... and...dual zone temperature control. The most 
luxurious minivan you can buy... we call it limited. You'll call it 
unlimited.
