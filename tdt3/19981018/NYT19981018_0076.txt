Marty Adelstein, a partner at the Endeavor talent agency in Beverly 
Hills, vividly recalled his first day at the upstart company three 
years ago when he walked into his cramped office situated then above 
a hamburger restaurant. He picked up the phone to dial one of his 
top clients, David Kelley, the writer-producer of hit shows like ``Ally 
McBeal'' and ``The Practice.'' ``The lights went out in the whole 
building and the phones went dead,'' said Adelstein, 39, who had left 
the powerful Creative Artists Agency to serve as an owner in the fledgling 
Endeavor Agency. ``I was terrified. I thought, `What have I done?''' 
Actually, he's done quite well. Endeavor, which began in March 1995 
when four top agents quit their jobs at International Creative Management, 
opened makeshift offices and did not take salaries for a year, has 
emerged as what the trade paper Daily Variety called a significant 
player in the cutthroat and potentially vastly lucrative world of 
talent agencies. Its 10 partners are now believed to earn seven-figure 
incomes. Now situated in sleek offices on Wilshire Boulevard, Endeavor 
has endured some setbacks and is still struggling to forge a significant 
movie division, but the agency has, in a relatively short time, turned 
into a formidable and high-profile one. And it has done so by breaking 
a number of rules, including, until recently, maintaining an unusual 
10-man partnership that runs the agency instead of one or two people. 
Its growth is underscored by the fact that Endeavor is relatively 
small in contrast to the other players, like the Creative Artists 
Agency and International Creative Management. It now has a staff of 
70, including 30 agents, representing more than 300 clients ranging 
from Kelley and Larry David, a creator of ``Seinfeld,'' to actors 
like Adam Sandler, Edward Norton, Lisa Kudrow, Bill Paxton and Bette 
Midler, to directors like Jon Turteltaub (``Phenomenon''), Brad Silberling 
(``City of Angels''), Philip Noyce (``Clear and Present Danger''), 
Bruce Beresford (``Driving Miss Daisy'') and Kevin Smith (``Clerks''). 
The agency also represents the television work of James Cameron, director 
of ``Titanic.'' Endeavor's success rests heavily on its clients in 
TV, where syndication fees and extravagant contracts for a handful 
of writer-producers can make agencies wealthy. Endeavor not only represents 
Kelley, one of the highest-priced writer-producers in television, 
but Bonnie and Terry Turner (``Third Rock From the Sun''), Glen Morgan 
and Jim Wong (``The X-Files'') and the co-creator and executive producer 
of ``King of the Hill,'' Greg Daniels. For the current television 
season, Endeavor represents J.J. Abrams and Matt Reeves, who created 
the WB show ``Felicity,'' and the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, the writer-producer 
of ``Sports Night.'' One lawyer estimated that ``King of the Hill'' 
was a ``guaranteed home run'' for Endeavor, probably earning the agency 
tens of millions of dollars. On the film side, Endeavor has compiled 
a strong list of writers and a handful of directors, and stepped only 
recently into the business of representing actors. Last month, Brian 
Swardstrom, a 36-year-old agent-turned-manager, joined Endeavor as 
a partner and brought along clients like Norton, Paxton and Parker 
Posey. Swardstrom's Manhattan office near Soho will now serve as Endeavor's 
New York beachhead. Paxton, who starred in the film ``Twister,'' had 
been represented by the three biggest talent agencies in the last 
few years _ Creative Artists, International Creative Management and 
the William Morris Agency. His comment was typical of a successful 
actor who is not in the Tom Cruise-Tom Hanks money league. ``These 
big agencies have so many people they're trying to cover, and I felt 
I was just getting lost in the shuffle,'' Paxton said. ``Part of the 
problem is these big earners naturally get more attention.'' But other 
new clients were plainly concerned. Turteltaub said he went to Endeavor 
because of his friendship with his agent, David Lonner. ``Certainly 
when you go to a smaller agency you lose the bully factor _ the ability 
of a large agency to play the bully on your behalf with either a studio 
or a network,'' he said. ``You lose access to other clients of that 
specific agency. It is a concern. But what you gain is sticking with 
a person whom you believe in and trust.'' Rival agents said that Endeavor's 
expansion into films could be short-circuited by its relative small 
size. Without many A-list film directors, who are at the bigger agencies, 
Endeavor may find it difficult to lure an array of top or even mid-range 
stars. This could turn Endeavor into a top-heavy TV agency without 
influence in its movie division. The agency seems to have been started 
in the same manner that Michael Ovitz, Ron Meyer _ now the president 
of Universal Studios _ and a handful of other young William Morris 
agents began Creative Artists in 1975. Creative Artists started mostly 
as a television agency, then turned into a powerhouse. Endeavor was 
born less than auspiciously. Four agents _ Ariel Emanuel, Tom Strickler, 
David Greenblatt and Rick Rosen _ quit their jobs at International 
Creative Management shortly after midnight on March 29, 1995, hauling 
out files to cars. Legal action was threatened against them, but nothing 
resulted. The partners were joined six months later by Adelstein, 
a top television agent. A year later three other agents _ Lonner, 
Adam Venit and Doug Robinson _ defected from Creative Artists. Emanuel 
said the agency opened with a $500,000 bank credit line, in which 
the partners' homes were held as collateral. Strickler, who represents 
some top film writers, said, ``There was one crazy moment for me when 
I thought, `If worse comes to worse, I'll lose my house but I've got 
to be able to feed my dogs.' So I bought six months worth of dog food 
and stored it in the bedroom.'' Surprisingly, most of the writers 
and directors stayed with agents who moved to Endeavor. But actors 
_ many of them anxious about the small size of the agency _ were fickle. 
Wesley Snipes left his agent at Endeavor to join William Morris. Anne 
Heche went to Creative Artists. Will Smith opted to remain at Creative 
Artists instead of joining his agent at Endeavor. Leonardo DiCaprio 
did not want to choose between Venit and Creative Artists; he has 
no agent and is represented by a manager. Another blow for Endeavor 
was when the comedian Chris Farley died two weeks after he signed 
with the agency. Steve Rabineau, a 40-year-old Endeavor agent, said 
the agency was made up of friends. Such comments result in much eye-rolling 
among rival agents who say that friendship in Hollywood only goes 
so far. Personal collisions are bound to take place at Endeavor, where 
some clients of television agents like Emanuel and Adelstein earn 
far more money than clients of film agents, said several rival agents. 
But Emanuel, whose brother is Rahm Emanuel, the White House presidential 
adviser, said: ``People in this town dig up and create conflicts. 
We all came from big agencies where people fought and competed over 
everything _ money, clients, everything. We set up this agency to 
escape that. We won't treat each other like the way we were treated.'' 
But partly to meet the criticisms that 10 men cannot totally control 
a talent agency _ there are no female partners _ Endeavor recently 
created a three-man management team to oversee the company. The three 
are Emanuel, Adelstein and Rabineau. ``Hard to believe, but you know 
what?'' Emanuel said. ``We respect each other.''
