Police arrested a suspect in a stabbing attack on two Mormon church 
missionaries in central Russia that left one dead and the other hospitalized, 
police said Sunday. A group of assailants stabbed to death Jose Manuel 
Mackintosh, 20, and wounded Bradley Alan Borden, 20, after the pair 
left the home of a Mormon family in Ufa, about 1,200 kilometers (750 
miles) east of Moscow, according to a press release issued by the 
church in the United States. Both missionaries are from the United 
States. Borden, who was stabbed in the liver and stomach, was in critical 
but stable condition in an Ufa hospital, Donald Jarvis, head of the 
Mormon mission for the region, said Sunday. Mackintosh was stabbed 
in the heart. Police would not release any information about the arrested 
man. Witnesses said the man who killed Mackintosh was drunk at the 
time, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Investigators believe the stabbing 
was an indiscriminate attack and was not directed toward the Mormon 
church, said Rais Galin, police spokesman for the district that includes 
Ufa. Jarvis said he was convinced there were no religious or political 
motives for the attack, and thanked police and doctors for their ``friendly 
attitude'' in handling the case. L. Aldin Porter, an official with 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah, said, ``We 
understand that this tragedy was a random act of violence and that 
there was no premeditation. Our representatives in Russia will cooperate 
fully with local authorities in their investigation.'' Mackintosh,
