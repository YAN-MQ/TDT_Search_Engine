The much advertised friendship between Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara 
is still intact. The two Florida neighbors gave nothing away over 
36 holes in Sunday's World Match Play final. Nothing, that is, until 
Woods three-putted from 10-feet (3 meters) on the 34th, giving O'Meara 
a one-hole lead he never gave up. O'Meara dropped a tricky 15-foot 
(5 meters) from just off the fringe on the 36th for birdie to close 
out Woods 1-up. Woods, awaiting his 10-foot (3 meter) putt for birdie, 
rushed over to hug O'Meara. ``I hit a good putt, it was rolling and 
died on the back edge. What a fitting way to win a golf tournament,'' 
O'Meara said. ``I relish that putt, to make it when the heats on like 
that,'' he added. O'Meara picked up 170,000 pounds (dlrs 290,000) 
and piled yet another title on his Masters and British Open wins, 
and Woods pocketed 90,000 pounds (dlrs 150,000) _ a bit more than 
they usually play for in practice back home in Florida. ``To win this 
after everything that's happened to me with the Masters and winning 
the (British) Open, it's just been a dream year for Mark O'Meara.'' 
Woods, the world's No. 1-ranked player (David Duval is No. 2 and O'Meara 
No. 3), seemed more intense than O'Meara, particularly on the first 
18 as he piled up a three-hole lead. ``He's still my friend, no matter 
what,'' Woods said. ``But still we're playing competitors and I wanted 
to win the tournament as much as he did. I know that, he knows that.'' 
The intensity showed up early on the 11th when Woods didn't concede 
an 18-inch putt, which O'Meara made to win the hole. ``You'll give 
me this hole, won't you?'' O'Meara shouted across the green. Woods 
looked sheepishly away and O'Meara replied, ``I'm gonna remember that 
next week.'' Then, playing to a gallery at a Wentworth Club evenly 
divided in their loyalty, he measured it with his putter shaft _ not 
once but twice to roaring applause. ``I know he's 22,'' O'Meara said 
later, ``but I'll have to get him a little WD40 and loosen him up 
a little bit out there.'' Walking off the 30th tee (par-5, 12th), 
where O'Meara would eventually make an eagle to even the match _ knocking 
a 2-iron 215 yards to two feet (70 cm) and hitting the flagstick _ 
Woods wrapped his arms around O'Meara. O'Meara recounted the conversation. 
``Whether I win or you win or whatever,'' Woods said. ``I just want 
to tell you it's been a heck of a match. So I'm just proud to be playing 
with you and against you.'' On a perfect fall day, the two players 
linked all season as golf's No. 1 story, showed why. They lagged long 
putts to a few inches _ dropped a few en route _ and rapped long and 
medium irons just as close. As luck would have it, it was Woods' mistake 
on the 34th that cost him. With a chance to take a one-hole lead, 
Woods instead three-putted from 10 feet (3 meters) for bogey. O'Meara, 
meanwhile, scrambled to save par. He hit a half-swing escape shot 
from the edge of the woods on his second shot _ into a greenside bunker. 
But he chipped out to 10 feet (3 meters) and dropped the putt. ``I 
hit a bad putt, I pushed it,'' Woods said. ``And I pushed the second 
one coming back.'' ``But the ebb and flow was tremendous with four 
or five shifts,'' Woods added. ``It's a special thing and it can only 
happen when you play 36 holes.'' In mounting his comeback, O'Meara 
birdied four of the first seven holes on the second 18 _ coupled with 
Woods' first bogey of the day _ to take a one-hole lead after 25. 
After that, the lead changed four times as O'Meara held it last. ``To 
just keep coming through when you have to, when your back is against 
the wall, that's meant a lot to me from a maturity standpoint this 
year,'' O'Meara said. `Or to be a little iffy at times _ like I was 
today _ and still get the job done.''
