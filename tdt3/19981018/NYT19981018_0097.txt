Looking for the latest anti-apartheid protest or Jethro Tull gig? 
Thirty years ago _ before history claimed such events as its grist 
_ the place to look was Time Out, then a start-up listings magazine 
produced by a 21-year-old British college graduate. Last weekend, 
as Time Out celebrated its 30th birthday with a noisy bash for 3,000 
people at south London's Brixton Academy, the same publication _ now 
with earnings of some $34 million a year _ could tell you about a 
whole lot more than gigs and demos. Where to find sex in New York, 
for instance, was on the cover of its 3-year-old New York edition; 
and, symbolically enough, the anniversary issue in London featured 
a long interview with the British rock star Ian Dury, who, despite 
a personal battle with cancer, has metamorphosed into a plumper, slicker 
version of himself, albeit with a lingering irreverence _ rather like 
Time Out. For a publication that likes to promote itself as being 
at the cutting edge, though, Time Out has been slow to commit wholeheartedly 
to the Internet. A plan to expand its World Wide Web site this month 
to include the entire output of the magazine was postponed. Instead, 
a radically re-designed Web site (www.timeout.com) is supposed to 
provide an international look at events in 25 cities. Tony Elliott, 
owner and founder of Time Out Group, said he had considered putting 
the magazine on the Internet to mark the 30th anniversary, but shelved 
the idea because of the $1.6 million cost. Not only that, the very 
accessibility of the Internet raises a big question in his mind not 
just about the nature of a delivery system but also about how information 
is valued. ``I've known since the 1970s that Time Out's future is 
electronic but I don't like the idea of it being for free,'' he said. 
``We sell a major package which people are prepared to spend cash 
for and I think the idea of making it free, willy-nilly, overnight, 
would be irresponsible. And I think the Europeans will show the Americans 
that people will pay for content.'' Such considerations show how far 
the magazine has come from its birth in a London basement as a fold-out 
sheet that sold for what would now be five pence _the equivalent of 
eight cents. The magazine's name now adorns not just editions in London 
and New York, but also franchises in Rome and Paris, along with an 
array of eating, drinking and shopping guides. In conjunction with 
Penguin Books, the magazine publishes guides to 20 cities from Amsterdam 
to Sydney. In this age of constant expansion and brand extension, 
one question about the publication is where it goes next. One part 
of the answer is: further into the United States. Of the 3,000 people 
at the Oct. 9 party in Brixton, 79 had been flown in from New York 
_ virtually the entire New York staff, which prides itself on having 
pushed circulation to more than 85,000 (compared with the parent magazine's 
98,839 in London) following a 31 percent jump in the first six months 
of this year. The performance in New York has encouraged Elliott, 
51, to toy with another U.S. edition _ either in Los Angeles or San 
Francisco, Chicago or Washington _ even though the New York start-up 
cost more than expected. ``There's a huge expectation that Time Out 
will go to Los Angeles,'' Elliott said, but added that no decision 
will be made until he is ``sure that New York is paying its way,'' 
a breakthrough he forecasts for next year. That will doubtless hearten 
Elliott's backers in the New York project _ The Clark Estates and 
William Louis Dreyfus _ who, along with Elliott, put up something 
between $10 and $30 million (Elliott refused to be more precise) to 
start Time Out New York in September 1995, in an uncertain market. 
``Everyone said there was no hope for us,'' said Cyndi Stivers, editor 
of the New York edition.'' But, she continued, ``one of the reasons 
we succeeded in New York was that we really did it on a shoestring.'' 
The austerity, she said, led to ambitious staff members moving to 
better-paying jobs. While the New York edition has grown, though, 
the circulation of the London version has shrunk by some 11 percent 
during the same period, reflecting inroads by listings magazines distributed 
free in several British newspapers. Even so, advertising revenue has 
risen by a fifth over the same period to the equivalent of around 
$14.7 million, or roughly two-thirds of the London magazine's revenues. 
Elliott says he has turned down inquiries from would-be buyers for 
the magazine. ``I have no interest in selling,'' he said. ``I'm not 
particularly motivated by having tons of cash in the bank. I would 
rather really, really, really enjoy what I'm doing and have a good 
living from it.''
