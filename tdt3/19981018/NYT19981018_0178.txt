Rep. Charles Schumer brought his campaign for the U.S. Senate to the 
edge of Long Island Sound on Sunday, accepting endorsements from several 
environmental groups and saying that Sen. Alfonse D'Amato had done 
nothing to protect the waters surrounding his home base of Long Island. 
``People love the environment here,'' Schumer said as water lapped 
and geese honked in the background. ``And shame of it all, the senator 
who hails from Nassau County has a record at the bottom of the environmental 
barrel.'' Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn, received endorsements 
from the New York League of Conservation Voters and the national Sierra 
Club, whose representatives said he had consistently voted to protect 
the environment during his 18 years in Congress. In particular, they 
said, Schumer voted against weakening the Clean Water Act in 1995 
and against delaying the removal of toxic PCB's from the Hudson River 
and other waterways in 1998. In comparison, the environmental advocates 
said, D'Amato, a Republican, voted to decrease funds for the cleanup 
of toxic waste sites and to weaken the ability of the federal Environmental 
Protection Agency to enforce clean air standards, both in 1995. D'Amato 
has occasionally voted to protect the environment, but only in years 
when he was up for re-election, they said. ``The D'Amato effect, as 
I describe it, is the curious behavior of the senator from New York, 
every six years, to suddenly turn good on the environment,'' said 
Chuck McGrady, the national president of the Sierra Club. ``This race 
is very simple to understand in environmental terms,'' McGrady said. 
``Chuck Schumer is there, protecting our special places.'' Carol Browner, 
the head of the EPA, also appeared with Schumer here and praised his 
environmental record. ``You have a choice between a candidate who 
has been strong on the environment and someone who is sort of a fair-weather 
friend,'' she said. Harvey Valentine, a spokesman for D'Amato, said 
the senator was proud of his environmental voting record, which he 
said included ``fighting to protect New York's forests, lakes and 
streams from the devastating effects of acid rain'' and ``securing 
millions of dollars for the purchase of natural-gas buses.''
