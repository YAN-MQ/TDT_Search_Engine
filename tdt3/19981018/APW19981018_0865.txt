The status Sunday of promises that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
must back up with evidence of compliance by NATO's deadline _ pushed 
back to Oct. 27 _ or face renewed threat of airstrikes for his crackdown 
in Kosovo: _ Immediately halt all hostilities in Kosovo: Amid a new 
wave of violence, three Serb policemen died and three others were 
badly wounded Saturday by a grenade at a police outpost in the town 
of Orlate, 20 miles (30 kms) southwest of Pristina, but major large-scale 
fighting has not occurred for about a month. Both sides reported shooting 
incidents Saturday. Serb police claimed ethnic Albanian ``extremists'' 
had attacked them more than a dozen times across Kosovo. The ethnic 
Albanians blamed the Serbs for at least two of the incidents, saying 
police in Vranjevac had opened fire. _ Withdraw forces and heavy armaments 
to levels before the crackdown began Feb. 28: NATO spy planes continued 
flying over Kosovo on Sunday to check on the status of pullouts. NATO 
says more Serb troops and police remain in the province than are permitted. 
On Sunday, western sources said, a Serb column of tanks, armored personnel 
carriers and truck left their Pristina barracks and moved westward 
down the main highway through central Kosovo, apparently in response 
to recent attacks on police by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. _ 
Start serious talks with ethnic Albanians on self-rule: No date for 
the start of talks has been announced. The two sides have been holding 
separate discussions with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill. Ethnic Albanian 
political leaders reportedly met Saturday in Turkey to discuss taking 
a united stand on independence or autonomy. _ Help refugees return 
to their homes: Some refugees have begun moving back to their villages 
but many remain wary of Serb police forces, some of whom were accused 
in massacres of civilians. _ Allowing unhindered work by humanitarian 
organizations: The U.N. refugee agency and others have resumed aid 
convoys for the past several days, and some workers say Serb police 
have been less obstructive. _ Cooperating with the International War 
Crimes Tribunal: U.N. war crimes investigators have received Yugoslav 
visas and plan to return to Kosovo soon. _ Allowing a 2,000-member 
international verification force into Kosovo to verify that Yugoslavia 
is keeping its word: An advance team for the monitors, to be overseen 
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, arrived 
in Pristina on Sunday. OSCE says it hopes a sizable number of monitors 
would be in place in Kosovo in two weeks.
