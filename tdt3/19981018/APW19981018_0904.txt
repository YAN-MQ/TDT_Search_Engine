At least 30 people were killed Sunday when a train jumped its tracks 
at a north Egyptian station and careened across the platform, authorities 
said. Health Minister Ismail Sallam said so far 33 people had died 
and 97 had been injured _ of which 45 were in critical condition, 
the official Middle East News Agency reported. The Interior Ministry 
gave casualty tolls of 30 dead and 96 wounded. Officials warned the 
death toll was likely to rise and earlier reports spoke of more than 
40 killed. An Interior Ministry spokesman blamed the higher figures 
on confusion at the site. The train was traveling from the port of 
Alexandria to Kafr el-Sheik when it derailed in the station of Kafr 
el-Dawar, a town about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Alexandria, 
the ministry said. The train went off the rails when the driver changed 
tracks ``at high speed,'' the ministry's statement said. The locomotive 
and the first two passenger cars toppled over and plowed through people 
and kiosks on the platform, the ministry said. Egyptian television 
showed a crane moving toward one of the overturned train cars as scores 
of riot police fended off hundreds of wailing people. One train car 
appeared to have crashed into small buildings near the railway. Egyptian 
television appealed to citizens to donate blood. Residents of Kafr 
el-Dawar had flocked to the local hospital to give blood, the official 
Middle East News Agency reported. Others at the site had used their 
own clothes to staunch the bleeding of the wounded, the agency said. 
A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was speeding 
because free-riding passengers had tampered with the brakes system 
between the cars, the news agency reported. Such trains are usually 
packed with hundreds of commuters and it is not uncommon for people 
to hitch a ride on the roof and between the cars. Health Minister 
Sallam, a practicing surgeon, left his office in Cairo and went to 
the site with a team of doctors, officials said. Egyptian railways 
have suffered a series of accidents in the past four years. The most 
serious was in December 1995 when one train crashed into another in 
fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people and injuring 76.
