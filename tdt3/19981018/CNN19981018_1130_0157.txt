The clock is ticking for mideast leaders to reach a peace accord today. 
But that deadline may be extended. President Clinton is joining Israeli 
and Palestinian leaders again today in rural Maryland in hopes of 
breaking the 19-month deadlock in peace negotiations between the two 
sides. Sources say security issues remain the primary stumbling block 
to an agreement in which Israel would turn over more West Bank land 
to the palestinians. Israel's newly appointed foreign minister, ariel 
Sharon, is also joining today's session. He's opposed to giving the 
Palestinians any more territory without security guarantees.
