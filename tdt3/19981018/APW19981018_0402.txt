New world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport won the battle of the women's top 
guns on Sunday, successfully defending her crown from second-seed 
Venus Williams in the all-American final of the dlrs 1 million European 
Championships. Davenport overcame her younger compatriot 7-5, 6-3 
in 73 minutes, becoming the first women's player to capture six titles 
this year. Davenport, who officially took over as the world's top 
player from Martina Hingis this week, will remain atop the world rankings 
another week, while Williams maintains her place at number five. The 
win extends Davenport's five year winning streak in Switzerland to 
17 victories. The American has not dropped a set for the past two 
years at the Zurich tournament, which was renamed Swisscom Challenge 
mid-way through the event.
