In the month before Henry Clay Frick died in 1919, he would descend 
at night from his second-floor, wood-paneled bedroom to the ground 
floor of his Fifth Avenue mansion, which is today the Frick Collection. 
He would sit in the dark, ashes accumulating on his cigar, and stare 
at one of his many paintings, which would be lit by only a small spotlight. 
After a time, he would move to another masterpiece. Was this much-hated 
coke-and-steel baron thinking about the money he spent amassing his 
renowned collection or the respect it brought him? About his industrial 
legacy or his reputation as a rabid anti-unionist? Or, perhaps, about 
the artists' intentions? None of the above, says his great-granddaughter 
Martha Frick Symington Sanger. Frick, she contends in a book published 
last week, was contemplating moments in his life that he had marked 
by buying particular paintings, many relating to his beloved daughter 
Martha, who died at age 6 after four years of a debilitating infection. 
``He was reliving his life,'' Ms. Sanger said, a life haunted by longing 
for Martha, whose likeness he even reproduced on his checks. Frick's 
collecting, in other words, was driven by his psychology, shaped more 
by his grief than by his vaunted connoisseurship or need for status 
symbols. Ms. Sanger's thesis stands in stark contrast to the traditional 
view, as stated in ``Art in the Frick Collection'' (Frick/Abrams, 
1996), which emphasizes her great-grandfather's discriminating eye 
and credits him as the prototype for many great American collectors. 
``This book breaks the rules,'' Ms. Sanger said, ``and an art historian 
probably couldn't write a book like this. But it makes sense to me. 
I'm a family member, and I didn't have academic hoops to jump through.'' 
Ms. Sanger, 54, does not dispute her great-grandfather's ``natural 
eye for beauty,'' but she says that his artworks had more important 
meanings, literally, emotionally and symbolically. In buying them, 
she said one recent day as she walked around the Frick explaining 
the significance of various paintings, ``he displaced his feelings 
for Martha.'' Her thesis, she said, springs from modern grief theory. 
``When mourning is unresolved, people acquire or keep `linking objects,' 
something the deceased loved or had at death,'' she explained. ``One 
must be open and willing to do so, but you can see that the paintings 
became linking objects. That's why he spent hours alone at night with 
only the paintings showing.'' To reach that conclusion, Ms. Sanger 
spent the last 10 years researching her family history, poring over 
archives and books, traveling to the places that figured in Frick's 
life and interviewing hundreds of people. The result is ``Henry Clay 
Frick: An Intimate Portrait'' (Abbeville Press), a 600-page tome that 
weighs 7 pounds. Unlike previous biographies of Frick, Ms. Sanger's 
book goes beyond his business career and delves into his personal 
life. The defining moment, she argues, occurred four years after Martha's 
1891 death and three years after Frick survived an assassination attempt 
that evoked, he later claimed, an apparition of Martha. In 1895, in 
a delayed reaction to those events, Frick had a nervous breakdown. 
Though he had bought a few paintings each year beginning in 1881, 
he suddenly began to collect at a feverish pace. That July, on the 
10th anniversary of Martha's birth, he bought Bouguereau's ``Mischievous 
Girl,'' a portrait resembling Martha. ``That was the moment his collection 
pattern was established,'' Ms. Sanger said. Rembrandt's ``Polish Rider,'' 
for example, recalls Frick's journeys on his gray horse, Billy, through 
Pennsylvania's coal bluffs early in his career, she said, while El 
Greco's ``Purification of the Temple,'' in which Jesus drives out 
the money-changers, commemorates Frick's violent victory over the 
unions at the Homestead steel mill. His second daughter, Helen Clay 
Frick, on whom he grew increasingly dependent as his wife, Adelaide, 
suffered from severe depression, continued her father's pattern until 
her death in 1985, Ms. Sanger said. Helen was responsible, for example, 
for buying Bastiani's ``Adoration of Magi,'' the only purchase made 
during 1935, the 50th anniversary of Martha's birth. ``Martha was 
the adored child,'' Ms. Sanger said. Ms. Sanger seems an unlikely 
source of such a groundbreaking thesis. She freely declares that she 
dropped out of junior college and lacks an author's credentials. ``I 
never wrote a book,'' she said, ``I never read a book.'' Instead, 
she married, raised three daughters, raced championship horses and 
served as steward for the National Steeplechase and Hunt Association. 
Now divorced and living in Stevenson, Md., she started researching 
her family history as therapy, as a need to understand the alcoholism 
among family members, including her mother, for more than 100 years. 
And she had her own demon to exorcise. It is no accident, she was 
told, that she is the namesake of Frick's tragic daughter, which was 
also her mother's name. As the third daughter of parents who wanted 
a boy, she said, ``I was the cursed child and the spare child.'' Growing 
up, Ms. Sanger said she was given a ``sainted view'' of Frick. So 
she set out to explore him ``as a person.'' Her thesis began to dawn 
on her when she visited his birthplace in West Overton, Pa. ``I happened 
to stand at the window,'' she recounted, ``and I thought `that looks 
like the Rousseau in the Frick,''' a reference to ``The Village of 
Becquigny.'' A little later, she journeyed to Salem, Ore., where she 
interviewed the son of one of Frick's tutors. He had a photograph 
of Frick holding Martha's dog that was not in the family archives. 
``It jumped out at me,'' Ms. Sanger recalled, because it mimicked 
a painting by George Romney of Lady Hamilton holding a dog, which 
Frick bought in 1904. ``I discovered the fact that Lady Hamilton was 
the same age in the painting as Martha would have been'' in 1904, 
Ms. Sanger said. ``This painting was at the foot of his bed when he 
died.'' The other painting in his bedroom was also telling, she said. 
Sir Thomas Lawrence's ``Miss Louisa Murray'' also looks like Martha, 
but is somewhat unnatural. ``It's disturbing, apparition-like,'' Ms. 
Sanger maintains, and it demonstrates to her that Frick's ``feelings 
vibrate from idealism to nightmare, from the beautiful child to the 
demonic Martha that haunts him.'' The painting has never been on view, 
Ms. Sanger said, ``but it's one of the most important paintings in 
the collection as far as the family is concerned.'' The family, according 
to Ms. Sanger's older sister Helen Clay Chace, largely subscribes 
to the book's analysis. After seeing the Romney portrait and ``Becquigny,'' 
Ms. Sanger's work gathered speed. ``It was like cracking a code,'' 
she said, ``and once I got it, painting after painting began to reveal 
itself.'' Frick, who was trained as an accountant, wrote virtually 
nothing about his paintings, but he did enter the date of his purchases 
in an account book. ``I found the language,'' she said, ``the paintings 
that turn up on anniversaries and so on.'' For example, he bought 
Millet's ``Woman Sewing by Lamplight,'' a portrait Ms. Sanger believes 
recalls Frick's early life, shortly after his mother died. (He placed 
it opposite ``Becquigny.'') He acquired John Hopner's ``Ladies Sarah 
and Catherine Bligh,'' which resembles his wife and her sister, Attie, 
just after Attie died. Four months before his death in 1919, and just 
after the July anniversary of Martha's death, Frick bought Vermeer's 
``Mistress and Maid.'' It depicts a woman interrupted by the delivery 
of an obviously disturbing letter from her servant, and Ms. Sanger 
says it refers to the frantic correspondence between Frick and his 
wife as Martha lay dying. The jeweled casket in the painting is like 
Martha's jeweled casket. ``One or two paintings would be a shaky case,'' 
Ms. Sanger asserted, ``but the entire collection speaks to his psychology.'' 
Ms. Sanger said that art in Frick's former home in Pittsburgh, Clayton, 
also supports her thesis. ``It's a shrine to Martha.'' Paradoxically, 
it is the sweeping case Ms. Sanger constructs that prompts some skepticism. 
At a book party for her this month, one art expert who insisted on 
anonymity said he could believe the grief connection for some paintings, 
but not for most of it, as Ms. Sanger posits. And among the early 
reviews, Publisher's Weekly also suggested that the book did not tell 
the whole story behind Frick's collecting, although other trade magazines 
praise the book as well written and well documented. Answering the 
skeptics, Ms. Sanger said she was the first person to have access 
to the diaries, account books, photo albums, letters and other elements 
in family archives. And her thesis, she said, ``makes sense to people 
who've lost a child, who are familiar with art therapy or who carry 
a troubled family history. Those people who don't understand how people 
can relate to art will have trouble with it.'' In any case, the book 
has lifted a weight for her. ``Writing is very cathartic,'' she said, 
adding that she has now turned her attention to her mother, who died 
a few years ago. ``My next book will be about the daughter's search 
for the mother.''
