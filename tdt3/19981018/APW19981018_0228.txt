Armed men have abducted an owner of fishing trawlers in the southern 
Philippines, where government troops were searching for other recent 
kidnap victims, police said Sunday. Police said the armed men, aboard 
two motorboats, stopped Rolando Kanes' pumpboat near a wharf in Naga 
town in Zamboanga del Sur province Friday night. The abductors didn't 
harm Kanes' companions but took their two-way radios and belongings, 
police added. Government troops have started a search for Kanes and 
the kidnappers, officials said. They said no ransom demand has been 
received. After separate abductions last month in southern Mindanao, 
an Italian priest, the Rev. Luciano Benedetti; the family of a Taiwanese 
businessman, two Hong Kong citizens and a Malaysian were still in 
captivity. One of two wealthy Filipino traders seized recently by 
kidnappers in Mindanao was released Friday in a forest and rescued 
by government troops. The kidnappers released rice trader Modesto 
Natividad, 62, apparently out of fear that the military was closing 
in on their lair in the island province of Basilan, officials said. 
Ransom kidnappings remain rampant in the Philippines despite a high-profile 
government crackdown.
