President Clinton is mediating the mideast peace talks in Maryland 
again today. He arrived at the wye river conference center a short 
time ago. The negotiations there are centered on a plan for the Israelis 
to remove military forces from an additional 13% of the West Bank. 
In return for the land, the Israelis want security guarantees from 
the palestinians, like the extradition of suspected terrorists for 
trial in israel. Sources say it's these security guarantees that are 
holding up an agreement. Joining the talks today are the newly appointed 
Israeli foreign minister ariel Sharon and defense minister yitzhak 
mordechai. Talks are scheduled to wrap up tonight, but could be extended.
