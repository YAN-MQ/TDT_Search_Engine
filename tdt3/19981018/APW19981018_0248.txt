The ruling Union of Democratic Forces concluded Sunday a year-long 
reform, transforming it from a 15-party alliance into a single party. 
The change, approved by some 3,000 party members at a national conference, 
aims to enhance the Union's efforts to win local elections next year. 
It controls the central government, while most mayoralties are controlled 
by the opposition Socialist Party of renamed communists, who won most 
of the local ballots four years ago. Petty struggles between parties 
and leaders in the Union of Democratic Forces have caused it a series 
of political defeats in the past. The party leader, Prime Minister 
Ivan Kostov, started building a single party out of the quarreling 
coalition a year ago and dealt a crushing defeat to former communists 
in 1997 general elections. Kostov told the meeting that the UDF was 
bound to become a party of the European Christian-Democratic type 
and attract centrist voters who have been traditionally lukewarm to 
it. In 1997, the UDF came to power on a wave of popular discontent 
with economic mismanagement by the Socialists.
