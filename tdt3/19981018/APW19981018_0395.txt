Robert Rose doubled home a run in the three-run third inning as the 
Yokohama BayStars beat the Seibu Lions 9-4 Sunday in the opening game 
of Japan's professional baseball championship series. The BayStars, 
who had waited 38 years since their only other Central League championship, 
wasted no time building a 7-0 lead after four innings in the opener 
of the best-of-seven Japan Series before a capacity crowd of 29,000 
at Yokohama Stadium. Takanori Suzuki, the Central League's leading 
hitter for two consecutive years, singled home the first run in the 
first inning against Fumiya Nishiguchi (13-12), who led the Pacific 
League in strikeouts with 148 this season. Suzuki, a .337 hitter in 
the regular season, singled home another run in the third inning and 
scored on the double by Rose, who formerly played for the California 
Angels. Rose scored on Takahiro Saeki's single. The BayStars added 
three runs in the fourth inning on three hits and a wild pitch by 
Lions reliever Shinji Mori. The closest the Lions could come was 7-2 
in the sixth inning and 8-4 in the seventh. The Lions, Pacific League 
champions for the second consecutive year, scored on a two-run home 
run by Taisei Takagi after a triple by Tatsuya Ozeki, and then on 
an RBI double by pinch hitter Yoshiaki Kanemura and a single by Kazuo 
Matsui. The BayStars scored one run each in the seventh and eighth 
innings. Their ace reliever, Kazuhiro Sasaki, who had 45 saves in 
the regular season, retired the last four Lions batters. The series 
opener, originally scheduled Saturday, had been postponed because 
of Typhoon Zeb. Game 2 will be played at Yokohama Stadium Monday. 
The Seibu Lions have won the Japan Series eight times, but lost last 
year to the Yakult Swallows, four games to one. The BayStars have 
never won a Japan Series.
