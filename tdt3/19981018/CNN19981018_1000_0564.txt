Volunteers are working around the clock on the Australian island of 
tasmania to save a group of beached pilot whales. They've already 
rescued several dozen. But at least 50 of the animals have died. The 
volunteers are putting the surviving whales on trucks and driving 
them to an area of the coast where the water is deeper.
