The state department says it's still an open question as to whether 
the israelis and Palestinians will reach an agreement at the mideast 
peace summit in Maryland today. President Clinton and vice President 
Al Gore have been meeting with Israeli officials this afternoon. Two 
key players in the Israeli cabinet foreign minister ariel Sharon and 
defense minister yitzhak mordechai have joined the talks. The goal 
-- get Israel to agree to remove its forces from an additional 13% 
of the West Bank in exchange for tougher anti-terrorism measures from 
palestinians. Diplomatic sources say a limited agreement is expected, 
but a comprehensive deal could take weeks. The talks are scheduled 
to end today. Our goal going into this meeting was to schedule out 
the time so that the work could be completed in the allotted time. 
We don't want to speculate on what will happen if that doesn't happen. 
There is time to complete the work if the political will is there 
to make the tough decisions.
