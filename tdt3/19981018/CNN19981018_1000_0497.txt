This is Orelon Sidney from the CNN weather center with your "Headline 
News weather update." A slow-moving cold front will approach the Appalachians 
today. And heavy rain is still possible from Texas through the Mississippi 
valley and into Missouri. As we move through Monday, this cold front 
system will head off the northeast coast and become stationary across 
the south atlantic to the gulf of Mexico. This will continue heavy 
rains across southern and western portions of texas into New Mexico. 
To the north, a cold front will move through the Great Lakes. There 
is a chance of rain, showers and even a little show as this low-pressure 
system tracks across the north. High pressure will build into the 
northwestern United States. Nome, Barrow and Fairbanks today will 
see snow with high temperatures near freezing to the upper 20s. Look 
for a 50% chance of thunderstorms across the virgin islands with highs 
in the mid 80s to near 90. Temperatures will be in the 40s and 50s 
for the northern Rockies and the northern plains. 60s, 70s and 80s 
are expected from the northeast through the central plains and into 
the southwest. The forecast for more than 6,000 cities is at CNN.com.
