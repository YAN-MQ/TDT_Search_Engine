When this year's Rose Queen walked onto the stage on Thursday night 
in her jeweled gown with a 16-foot train, she became part of a tradition 
dating to 1933, when this East Texas town might have actually deserved 
its nickname, ``Rose Capital of the Nation.'' Tourists from across 
the state and the nation, and even from some foreign countries, come 
to the annual Texas Rose Festival, which reaches a crescendo in a 
Saturday morning parade featuring floats heavy with roses that carry 
elaborately costumed duchesses, ladies in waiting and, of course, 
the queen. But the festival is rapidly becoming the most colorful 
part of Tyler's rose industry. The days when most of the bushes containing 
red, yellow and pink roses sold in the United States were grown on 
this sandy stretch of Texas prairie are long gone. Today, if a local 
man makes his living in roses, he is just as likely to do it packaging 
rose bushes grown elsewhere _ in California or Arizona, perhaps. Only 
10 to 15 major growers are left of the literally hundreds who grew 
roses here in the late 1950s, when Tyler produced more than 20 million 
bushes a year. Cary Nix, who supplied most of the 16,000 roses used 
to decorate this year's 13 festival floats, is one of the few local 
growers remaining. ``It's gone downhill pretty quick,'' he said of 
the business. ``A lot of the young kids don't want to take it up.'' 
Factories _ making tires, air conditioners and other products _ have 
moved into this town of 80,000, as they have in other rural communities, 
providing steady jobs and higher hourly wages than farm labor. Young 
people have gone away to college and taken desk jobs. Then there is 
the weather. One of the area's benefits is its long growing season 
_ about 245 days. But a hard freeze can still come early and kill 
bushes, and a drought can dry them up when growers do not have irrigation 
systems. The weather in competing areas, like California, is more 
predictable. ``It's hard work,'' Nix said, ``and a lot of people just 
found something else to get into that wasn't such a gamble.'' Nix, 
39, is a fourth-generation rose grower. His 19-year-old son, Chad, 
donned white tie and tails to escort the Duchess of the Rose Growers 
to the coronation this year. But Nix said Chad wants no part of rose 
farming. ``He wants to get his degree in business,'' Nix said. ``He 
wants to kind of get into marketing.'' Even Nix's 11-year-old son 
turns up his nose at the idea. Unless something changes, Nix will 
be the last of his line in the business. Roses are not the first thing 
one thinks of when Texas comes to mind _ despite the song ``The Yellow 
Rose of Texas.'' The Lone Star State is more commonly associated with 
mesquite and scrub brush than with showy flowers. But roses were first 
grown here commercially in the mid-1800s, imported by the Shamburger 
family, who came to the area from Tennessee. Others took up growing 
roses after a plant disease destroyed most of the area's fruit trees 
in the early 1900s. The industry boomed in the 1940s and '50s, as 
refrigeration made the cold storage of roses possible and young World 
War II veterans returned to Tyler and formed cooperatives to market 
their roses, said Brent Pemberton, a researcher in ornamental plants 
at Texas A&AMP;M University. In 1949, 44 percent of all the rose bushes 
sold in the United States were produced in Tyler, he said. But only 
5 million bushes will be grown in Tyler this year, though an additional 
17 million will be processed here. Of the 50 million roses grown in 
the United States, Pemberton said, California is expected to produce 
30 million plants, while Arizona is expected to grow 15 million. So 
while tourists may bring more than $2 million into the local economy 
during this festival, the Texas rose it celebrates has been toppled 
from its throne by fancier plants from farther west. California growers, 
Jackson &AMP; Perkins in particular, have been adept at marketing 
to more affluent consumers, said Pemberton. They spend money to develop 
new hybrids and sell them by mail order through glossy catalogs. Meanwhile, 
Texas growers have kept to old stand-bys like Mister Lincoln, a red 
tea rose, and Peace, which has yellow-pink blossoms. Their crop is 
more likely to go to garden centers and nurseries, sometimes sold 
as a loss leader. Texans like Nix display a trace of cynicism about 
their competitors' ability to charge higher prices. ``They'll come 
up with a new pink and there's already a pink the same color,'' he 
said. ``Maybe they just put out new names for them.'' But such business 
concerns don't seem to matter at festival time. The social whirl surrounding 
the festival and the queen's coronation have become a part of Tyler 
culture _ the town's version of a debutante ball. The queen's parents 
may spend $100,000 or more to buy her an extravagant gown, sponsor 
a float for her to ride and hold a free afternoon tea at Tyler's municipal 
rose garden, said Lyn Long, one of the women who volunteer to arrange 
the rose baskets for the floats. Just having your daughter be a lady 
in waiting costs at least $10,000, she said. ``It's a little snobbish 
thing,'' Mrs. Long added, only half joking. ``Every mother wants their 
daughter to grow up and be in the Rose Festival.'' The question is: 
How many daughters _ or sons _ will want to work in the fields that 
the festival celebrates?
