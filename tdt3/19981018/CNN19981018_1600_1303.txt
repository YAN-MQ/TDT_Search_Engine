Coming up tonight -- it's game two of the fall classic between the 
Yankees and padres. New York leading the best of seven, one game to 
none. San Diego out to even their series, putting their hopes on the 
arm of Andy ashby. Although Ashby had two no-decisions in his two 
nlcs appearances, he pitched superbly, allowing just 3 runs and 14 
hits over 13 innings. New York will send Orlando Hernandez to the 
hill, whose pitching performance in game four of the alcs helped the 
Yankees even the series.
