A weekend of wicked weather in south Texas has claimed at least six 
lives. Two were killed when twisters churned through trailer parks 
and tornado warnings are still in effect for several counties in the 
southeastern part of the state. In the San Antonio area, at least 
four people have drowned in flooding that is said to have overtaken 
every Creek, river, drainage system, road and highway. The heavy rain 
moved toward Houston today leaving roads off of interstate 10 impassable.
