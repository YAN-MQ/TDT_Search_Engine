Two hurricanes are threatening Mexico's pacific coast. Hurricane Lester 
has made an abrupt left turn overnight and is heading westward, away 
from the southern part of the coast. But forecasters warn it could 
make a turn toward the north. A hurricane warning is in effect from 
salina Cruz to acapulco. About 3,000 people have been forced to evacuate 
areas already being hit by heavy rain and flooding. At last report, 
hurricane Lester was about 195 miles southeast of acapulco. Maximum 
sustained winds are near 100 miles an hour and expected to gain strength. 
Another hurricane, named Madeline, is slowly gaining intensity and 
is threatening Mexico's northern coast.
