Leaders of the fed-ex pilots' union voted unanimously today to seek 
strike authorization from its members. The union will now send ballots 
to the delivery service's 3,200 pilots. The pilots have never had 
a contract. The union says it disagrees with the company on issues 
such as retirement benefits, pay, work rules and job protection.
