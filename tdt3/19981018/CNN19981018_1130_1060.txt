A look at the fall classic, next in "Headline Sports." no, it's not 
a keyhole. I'm not looking through the doorway at someone. I'm looking 
through the on-net port. Port of entry to a seamless global network. 
A network that will change the fortunes of countless companies and 
the lives of thousands of Telecom managers and CIOs. I see them out 
there, right now. They seem... rather happy. On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
