Intensifying its efforts to reach younger, more fashion-conscious 
consumers, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is embarking on its most ambitious 
marketing campaign aimed at gay men and lesbians. Levi Strauss, the 
nation's largest apparel advertiser, is sponsoring ``Inside Out,'' 
a 12-page advertorial supplement in the November issue of Out magazine, 
which goes to subscribers and newsstands starting this week. The advertorial, 
peddling Dockers khaki pants, features 10 men and women who are openly 
homosexual and is part of a campaign that includes contributions from 
Levi Strauss and its Red Tab Foundation to two organizations that 
help gay youth and fight homophobia in schools: the Gay, Lesbian and 
Straight Education Network and the Hetrick Martin Institute. Levi 
Strauss is one of a growing number of companies aiming sales pitches 
at homosexuals for products from cars to computers. Even a new toothpaste, 
Mentadent Crystal Ice, is being advertised by Unilever, the consumer 
products giant, in The Advocate, the national gay and lesbian news 
magazine. The Dockers campaign, indicative of what is known as cause-related 
marketing, is part of a comprehensive program by Levi Strauss to reverse 
flagging sales among the trend-setting consumers born after the baby 
boomers. Other steps include promotions centered on independent films, 
an ``urban networking'' campaign honoring achievements by Generation 
X and hip, edgy advertising from the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of Omnicom 
Group. The program is particularly focused on reaching younger consumers 
through music. For instance, Details magazine, part of the Conde Nast 
Publications unit of Advance Publications, brought together the Levi's 
jeans brand sold by Levi Strauss with the Red Hot Organization, which 
raises money to fight AIDS by releasing themed albums featuring popular 
musicians. For Dockers, a brand ``associated with casual Fridays,'' 
said Mark Malinowski, senior marketing specialist for Levi Strauss 
USA, ``we want more of an urban sensibility.'' ``First and foremost, 
we're trying to reach 25- to 34-year-olds,'' he added, ``whom we call 
urban modernists. When we looked at who made up that group, gay men 
and lesbians are a large part of it.'' But when ``marketing to them,'' 
Malinowski said, ``it can't just be about advertising,'' because gay 
consumers want marketers ``to place our brands in front of them in 
a meaningful, relevant way.'' In a survey by Greenfield Online Inc. 
and Spare Parts Inc., a marketing communications company, 80 percent 
of respondents said they preferred to buy from companies that spoke 
to them as homosexuals. So the advertorial _ reminiscent of ``Men 
We Love,'' an annual editorial feature in Genre magazine _ ``is not 
about the pants,'' Malinowski said. ``It's about the people.'' The 
men and women, shown wearing Dockers in photographs shot by Carter 
Smith, include activists as well as the inevitable actors. Yet even 
the stars contribute to causes; one, Mitchell Anderson, is a spokesman 
for the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy organization. ``We wanted 
to make sure the section had the right feel,'' said Louis Fabrizio, 
vice president and publisher at Out in New York, owned by Out Publishing 
Inc., ``and not have everyone be a television celebrity.'' ``This 
is Dockers putting its money where its mouth is,'' he added. ``I don't 
think there's a problem with companies making money from the gay market 
if they're recognizing us in our environment, celebrating who were 
are, and have progressive policies as corporations. It's so good when 
a company like Levi Strauss does all that.'' Those involved with the 
project say they believe it has become more meaningful after the beating 
death of Matthew Shepard, the openly gay student at the University 
of Wyoming. The murder ``drives it home even harder that we need to 
be out there to help educate people and fight against ignorance and 
hatred,'' Malinowski said. In interviews with four people in the advertorial, 
none expressed qualms about its commercialism. ``It would be naive 
not to recognize that we live in a culture where advertising has a 
tremendous influence,'' said Rea Carey, executive director of the 
National Youth Advocacy Coalition. ``Certainly Dockers is interested 
in increasing the visibility of its product,'' she added. ``But we're 
also interested in raising the visibility of issues affecting gay 
youth.'' James Dale, who won a court fight with the Boy Scouts, said: 
``Before this, I would not have worn Dockers. But this is something 
that Dockers specifically did for the community, and I like that. 
I don't see it as pandering; it's more substantive and respectful.'' 
A New Jersey appeals court ruled in March that the Boy Scouts violated 
the state's anti-discrimination law by ousting Dale, an Eagle Scout, 
because he is gay. ``I wouldn't have taken part in this if I thought 
I were being used,'' said Bruce Hayes, an Olympic gold medal swimmer 
in 1984. The other participants in the advertorial are the young actor 
Wilson Cruz; Thomas Rollerson, who founded Dalmatian Dreams, which 
grants wishes to terminally ill adults; author Brad Gooch; photographer 
Eve Fowler; actress Guinevere Turner, and Max Mutchnick, who with 
David Kohan runs Komut Entertainment, creating and serving as executive 
producers of the new NBC sitcom ``Will and Grace.'' ``I have no issue 
with the commerce side of this,'' said Mutchnick, adding that he would 
sell toilet cleaner ``if in the tiniest way'' it would help ``someone 
being more comfortable coming out.'' The advertorial may provide fodder 
for ``Will and Grace,'' which is focused on Grace, a young woman; 
Will, her best friend, who is gay, and Jack, Will's outspoken gay 
friend. ``There's such a thing in the gay community that if you look 
at'' the back of a man's pants, Mutchnick said, laughing, ``and you 
see a Dockers logo, he's straight; you don't bother. So I may have 
Jack and Will both interested in the same guy, but what's holding 
them back is that the first time they met him he was in a pair of 
Dockers.''
