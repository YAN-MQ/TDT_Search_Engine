President Clinton was in Maryland today, continuing his efforts to 
prod the israelis and the Palestinians into some kind of agreement 
on peace. The biggest obstacles remain security and land. And while 
there are no claims of progress, the talks are now expected to continue 
into Monday. NBC's Andrea Mitchell is live at the state department 
tonight. Good evening, Andrea. Soledad, it would be hard to believe 
that the president and his entire administration would devote this 
much time to a summit and let it fail. To add more pressure, the president 
brought the vice president to the talks today to underscore just how 
important the summit is to the White House. Certainly we feel very 
strongly. We believe in a sense of urgency. And we are trying to instill 
that in the parties. Combined, the Clinton/Gore team also might have 
more leverage than Clinton alone. Gore has better relations than Clinton 
with Israel's prime minister netanyahu. Also arriving today, ariel 
Sharon, Israel's new foreign minister, deeply resented in the Arab 
world for not stopping militia loyal to Israel from massacring refugees 
in Beirut 16 years ago. Along with Sharon, Israel's defense minister, 
yitzhak mordechai, to help nail down security guarantees. Are you 
optimistic? yes, i am. They went directly into a meeting with the 
president and vice president, who must satisfy the hawkish ministers 
that the U.S. will make sure the Palestinians actually crack down 
on terrorism. Despite a carefully nurtured atmosphere of rustic informality, 
there still is no real trust between the two sides. And back home 
-- more tension. In the West Bank today, Israeli soldiers allegedly 
fired on Palestinians at a checkpoint. Several were hurt. While in 
Gaza, Palestinian demonstrators opposed any deal with Israel. For 
the Palestinians, a key demand is not only to get more land from Israel 
but more control of land Israel has already turned over. Right now, 
the Palestinians control only 3% of the West Bank. An additional 24% 
is under joint control, territory in which Palestinians cannot buy 
or sell property and must pass through frequent Israeli checkpoints 
-- often, as today, flash points for conflict. There's time to complete 
the work if the political will is there to make the tough decisions. 
Members of both parties did take shopping breaks. But so far, no final 
deal. Israel seems ready to accept a partial agreement. The Palestinians 
say no. Soledad? NBC's Andrea Mitchell at the state department, thank 
you.
