The new college football poll is out, and no surprise at the top spot, 
as ohio state at 6-0 remains the nation's top team. As a matter of 
fact, no change in the top five. Nebraska moves up one to seventh, 
replacing Virginia, who fell to 16th after their loss to Georgia tech. 
Texas A&M up two places to eighth. Penn state also moves up two to 
tenth.
