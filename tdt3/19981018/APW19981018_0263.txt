Eager to impose full control over all media, the Serbian government 
has drafted a new information law expected to further restrict the 
work of the independent media and pave the way for a shutdown of those 
deemed disobedient, critics said Sunday. The Serbian parliament will 
meet Tuesday to pass the law. The announcement followed a government 
decree last week imposing censorship and a shutdown of three independent 
newspapers and a radio who refused to obey the decree. No details 
of the law were immediately available but representatives of Serbia's 
independent media said Sunday the new information law is aimed at 
legalizing the government crackdown. ``I think this law will be more 
restrictive than any previous one and probably the worst media law 
in Serbia ever,'' said Aleksandar Tijanic, a former information minister 
and a columnist in the banned Dnevni Telegraf daily. He said the government 
has ``introduced a state of emergency in the Serbian media and society.'' 
The government loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has 
used the concern over the possibility of NATO air attacks on military 
targets in Serb-led Yugoslavia to clamp down on its opponents. It 
has issued a series of decrees tightening state control in the country. 
One such decrees imposed a temporary ban on broadcasts of Serbian-language 
programs by foreign media and demanded ``patriotic'' reporting from 
the independent media critical of Milosevic's policies. Throughout 
the eight-month Kosovo crisis, state officials have accused the media 
of betraying Serbia's national interests by reporting ethnic Albanian 
stands in the conflict. Last week, the government shut down prominent 
Nasa Borba, Danas and Dnevni Telegraf dailies, following eviction 
of the popular Index radio from its premises. The moves have triggered 
a wave of domestic and international protests but to no effect. The 
bellicose deputy premier, who has threatened retaliation against foreigners 
in Serbia, announced that the new information law would permanently 
ban foreign media broadcasts in Yugoslavia. Vojislav Seselj also said 
that ethnic Albanian media in Kosovo were being closely monitored. 
Veran Matic, head of an association of independent media, said he 
expected the law also to restrict the possibility that independent 
media be assigned broadcasting frequencies or given work permits. 
Matic also said he expected introduction of a wide range of possible 
penalties for non-government reporting, including financial fees. 
``This is an ideal moment for them (authorities) to bring such a restrictive 
law,'' said Matic, echoing warnings by intellectuals and independent 
analysts in Serbia that international pressure on Milosevic over Kosovo 
only gave the Serb strongman an alibi to tighten his grip on power 
at home.
