High-ranking officials from Turkey and Syria will meet Monday at a 
secret location to hold security talks aimed at easing tensions between 
the neighbors, foreign ministry officials confirmed Sunday. Foreign 
Minister Ismail Cem said late Saturday that talks would take place 
but gave no indication as to where and when they would be held. Turkey 
accuses Syria of sheltering Turkish Kurdish rebels responsible for 
cross-border attacks and indicated last month it might resort to military 
action unless Damascus halted alleged support to the insurgents. The 
threat raised fears of war in the region. ``In the meeting our representatives 
will assess how well Turkey's demands over separatist terrorism are 
being met,'' Cem told the Anatolia news agency. ``And, if they are 
being met, (we will assess) if the measures are enough and lasting.'' 
Syrian Defense Minister Moustafa Tlas said Sunday that his government 
wanted to resolve its differences with Turkey through diplomatic channels, 
the official Syrian Arab News Agency reported. ``The language of reason 
and logic should prevail over the language of threat. We should resort 
to international law,'' Gen. Tlas told a graduation ceremony at the 
Syrian Air Force Academy. Follow-up meetings would depend on how convincing 
Syrian officials were on promises to clamp down on the activities 
of the rebel group, said a foreign ministry official speaking on condition 
of anonymity. Turkish newspapers gave conflicting reports as to where 
the talks would be held. Possible venues included the Turkish and 
Syrian capitals as well as borders towns.
