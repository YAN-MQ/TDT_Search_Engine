And that's "NBC nightly news" for this Sunday. Here's Maria shriver 
with a preview of tonight's edition of "dateline NBC." Thanks, Soledad. 
Coming up tonight on "Dateline," she was one of the most outspoken 
first ladies of our time. Now Betty Ford is speaking out again. About 
surviving addiction and breast cancer and about the current crisis 
in the White House. The White House belongs to the people the people 
who are in it should treat it was the house of the people. Tonight 
on "Dateline." Soledad? Thanks, Maria. Tom Brokaw will be here tomorrow. 
I'm Soledad O'Brien. Have a good night and a good week ahead. The
