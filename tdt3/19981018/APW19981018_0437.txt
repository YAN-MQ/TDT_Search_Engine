Rockets hit an eastern neighborhood of Afghanistan's capital Sunday, 
killing three people, all of them civilians, said witnesses. The rocket 
attack comes as the Taliban religious army, which rules the capital 
and 90 percent of the country, is waging fierce battles on three different 
fronts against its enemies, a northern-based alliance led by former 
military chief Ahmed Shah Massood. There were conflicting reports 
that the Taliban had retaken the northern Afghan city of Taloqan, 
which they lost a day earlier to Massood's forces. According to a 
Taliban spokesman Jehangir Wal, contacted by telephone in southern 
Kandahar, the religious militia retook control on late around 4 p.m. 
local time (11:30 GMT). ``We have complete control'' he said. However, 
a spokesman for the opposition, who gave his name only as Arif, said 
the front line in Takhar province, of which Taloqan is the capital, 
is still at Bangi, about 10 kilometers (six miles) outside the city. 
He said the Taliban launched a big offensive to try to recapture the 
city, but were repulsed. Both sides in Afghanistan's protracted conflict 
routinely make claims that are difficult to independently confirm 
because of the remoteness of the area. In Kabul, residents ran for 
cover as rockets hit a residential area near the combined military 
and civilian airport as night fell Sunday. Although no one took responsibility 
for the attack, the rockets came from the direction of Massood's forces, 
eyewitnesses said. Several rockets also landed at the airport, they 
said. Dozens of Taliban fighter jets took off from the airport throughout 
the day, apparently headed toward the front lines in Takhar province 
and barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the Kabul. Arif said 
at least 10 people were wounded when Taliban jets bombed Parwan and 
Kapisa provinces both north of the capital and largely controlled 
by the opposition. Heavy fighting raged in Sonakan Pass, about 80 
kilometers (48 miles) north of Kabul, where the Taliban apparently 
have made some gains. The pass is strategic because it gives protection 
to the opposition soldiers at Baghram air force base.
