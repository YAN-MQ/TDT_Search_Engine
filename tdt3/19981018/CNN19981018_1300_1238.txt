For "Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven. You probably won't see any 
Brooms tonight at Yankee stadium, but there might be a few shovels. 
New York will try to bury San Diego in a 2-0 hole. Despite two home 
runs from Greg Vaughn and a two-run missile from eight-time batting 
champion Tony Gwynn, the padres still lost game one of the world series, 
9-6. Tino Martinez must have seen because it was his grand slam off 
Mark langston in the seventh that put the Bronx bombers up for good. 
Time had to come eventually. It was an ugly win, but, you know, bottom 
line is, it's a win.
