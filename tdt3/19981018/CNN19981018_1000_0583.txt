It's legal in California, and may soon be so in several other states. 
Don Knapp reports on the drive to legalize marijuana for medical use. 
This is one of perhaps dozens of marijuana sales rooms that opened 
after California voters overwhelmingly approved the medical marijuana 
initiative -- proposition 215 -- two years ago, legalizing Pot for 
anyone with a doctor's note saying the drug provided a medical benefit. 
My body has deteriorated. I'm in a lot of pain. And so marijuana really 
allows me to take that pain and to get out and live a life. While 
sales were brisk Friday workers braced for a shutdown at the hands 
of federal agents. A federal judge gave the Oakland club until Monday 
to close. The latest target in a continuing offensive by state and 
federal agents. All but a handful of Pot sales clubs have been shut 
down for a variety of alleged violations. Now with the initiative's 
as background voters in four other states are about to consider the 
initiatives this November. Washington state's I-692 would allow the 
use for specific illnesses. Polls indicate 59% of voters favor it, 
35% oppose, and 6% are undecided. Oregon voters also would approve 
a version on their state's ballot amendment 19 by about the same margins 
-- 59% for it, 37% opposed, 4% undecided. Polls indicate a closer 
race in Nevada, where question 9 is leading opponents 47% to 44%. 
% haven't decided. Colorado voters just lost the chance to decide 
the question. Late Friday, a judge invalidated a medical marijuana 
initiative already printed on the Colorado ballot. He said sponsors 
failed to gather enough signatures. Back in Oakland, Jeff Jones said 
he expects states that do pass initiatives will have to battle to 
keep them alive. Because a lot of people think it's not something 
that's a medicine. Convincing people that marijuana can be medicine, 
he says, is an uphill battle. Don Knapp, CNN, Oakland, California.
