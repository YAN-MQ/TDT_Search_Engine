With two survivors of the Holocaust at his side and a rabbi leading 
his rally, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato stood solemnly at the Holocaust Memorial 
in Manhattan on Sunday, promoting his efforts on behalf of Jewish 
voters and joining Jewish supporters in assailing his opponent, Rep. 
Charles Schumer, over issues of concern to Israel and to Jews. ``The 
Jewish community doesn't have a better friend than Sen. D'Amato,'' 
Alice Fischer, 69, a yeshiva instructor who survived the Bergen-Belsen 
concentration camp, said, speaking gravely in a thick Hungarian accent 
as D'Amato sat stiffly in a seat behind her. By contrast, Mrs. Fischer 
said, ``the opponent'' had voted against the use of force against 
Saddam Hussein in 1991 and failed to endorse Edward Koch over David 
Dinkins in New York City's ethnically contentious mayoral primary 
in 1989. Within two hours, Schumer had dispatched two of his own prominent 
Jewish supporters _ New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi and Rep. 
Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan _ to the same strip of concrete, where 
they accused D'Amato of exploiting the Holocaust for political gain. 
Hevesi and Nadler asserted that the Democratic Senate candidate's 
record on issues of concern to Jewish voters easily matched that offered 
by D'Amato, the Republican. This searing exchange between the two 
campaigns _ set against the backdrop of the Holocaust Memorial that 
stands across First Avenue from the United Nations Building _ stood 
in testimony Sunday to an unusual dynamic that is at the heart of 
this closely watched contest in New York. This is a race between a 
Roman Catholic senator, known from Washington to New York as one of 
the nation's leading advocates for Jewish causes, and a Jewish congressman 
from Brooklyn, who has sought just as vigorously to identify himself 
with issues of concern to Jewish voters. Their clash Sunday was over 
a segment of New York's electorate that _ while proportionately smaller 
and less influential than it was a generation ago _ could well prove 
critical to the outcome of this contest. As a rule, aides to both 
campaigns said, Jewish voters are more likely to vote, which could 
inflate their influence if the contest ends up drawing a low turnout 
at the polls. They are also more likely to make contributions. What 
is more, New York Jewish voters are overwhelmingly Democratic and 
based in New York City, making them essential to Schumer's victory. 
Any success that D'Amato has in stripping away voters who, as a matter 
of history, will be considered likely to be part of Schumer's political 
base, can be problematic for the Democratic challenger in a race this 
close. D'Amato's advisers said the event was the first of several, 
including, in all probability a television advertisement that would 
be aimed at drawing Jewish support away from Schumer. ``This is going 
to be a very difficult choice because Schumer is a textbook kind of 
candidate _ Harvard graduate, children in public schools _ in terms 
of liberal Jewish values,'' said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub 
Urban Research Center at New York University. ``But he is going against 
someone who has spent years attending to the needs of the Jewish community.'' 
The fruits of D'Amato's attention to those kind of voters were on 
display Sunday morning as the senator surrounded himself with women 
and men in yarmulkes, each taking a turn to praise D'Amato's attention 
to Jewish issues. They warmly recounted D'Amato's central role in 
forcing Swiss banks to compensate Holocaust victims whose families' 
funds were looted by the Nazis, and the senator's record of advocating 
in Washington for Israel's security interests. With equal fervor, 
they attacked Schumer's record in Congress, even applying the same 
basic thrust of D'Amato's campaign _ that Schumer missed votes in 
Congress this year _ to the matter of the Holocaust. Schumer was absent, 
D'Amato and his supporters said, during a vote in the Banking Committee, 
on which he serves, on establishing a presidential commission to review 
Holocaust claims, and at another vote making the U.S. Capitol Rotunda 
available for a Holocaust commemoration. ``He missed the vote to make 
the Capitol Rotunda available for a magnificent Holocaust commemoration 
ceremony,'' D'Amato said. ``That's the difference. I've been there. 
I understand that you've got to be there _ even if it means that there 
are political events that you'd like to make, but you can't.'' Later 
that afternoon, campaigning on Long Island, Schumer angrily criticized 
D'Amato for arranging what was an unusual political event, even in 
the unruly world of New York ethnic politics: a news conference in 
which Holocaust survivors attacked a prominent Jewish politician. 
``I think it's a shame that Al D'Amato would stoop to using the Holocaust 
for political purposes,'' he said. ``My record on Holocaust, on Jewish 
issues, is second to none. And I think this is, just, it shows what 
kind of man he is.'' Hevesi, the comptroller, made a similar point. 
``I am really angry about this,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
``Using the Holocaust for political purposes trivializes the Holocaust. 
That's a disgrace. You don't use it for political advantage against 
a Jewish leader who has been right on every issue that is pertinent 
to the Jewish community. D'Amato's aides defended the event with Holocaust 
survivors, saying they were trying to spotlight the senator's record 
with Jewish voters. D'Amato, taking a cue from Mrs. Fischer, criticized 
the congressman's 1991 vote against authorizing President George Bush 
to use force to repel Saddam Hussein from the Persian Gulf. ``For 
him to have voted against sending troops to Saddam Hussein was wrong,'' 
D'Amato said, ``because not only were we talking about the security 
of Israel, we were talking about a problem as it related to the entire 
region.'' Schumer responded by saying he based his vote on his belief 
that the Bush administration had offered ``no clear plan on how to 
deal with Saddam Hussein.''
