In the months after the issue of ethnic diversity in newsrooms exploded 
at the annual meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors 
in April, the development of an overarching statement of principles, 
goals and strategies for increasing the numbers of black, Asian, Hispanic 
and Native American journalists was one of the group's top priorities. 
The issue of women in the newsroom was not on the front burner. But 
as the governing board of the editors' society prepares to meet in 
Miami Tuesday, a proposal that women be counted in the annual newsroom 
census of minority journalists will most likely provoke at least as 
much debate as the broader diversity goals, according to several of 
the editors involved. The census, conducted since 1978, marks the 
industry's progress toward the goal, set by the society two decades 
ago, that ethnic minorities represent 15 percent of newsroom employees 
by 2000. In April, with hope of success dim, the society's board proposed 
to revise the goal to 20 percent by 2010. While the number of women 
in newsrooms is unknown, all involved agree that they far outnumber 
minorities, who constitute 11.5 percent of the 54,700 journalists 
working at newspapers nationwide. Minorities made up more than 26 
percent of the nation's population in 1994. Opponents of the plan 
to include women in the census say that it could distract newspaper 
executives from the goal of bringing more minority journalists into 
newsrooms. Proponents say they have no intention of diluting the push 
for ethnic diversity. All they want is data that are unobtainable 
elsewhere. ``Nobody is keeping track'' of women in the newsroom, said 
Sharon Rosenhause, managing editor of The San Francisco Examiner. 
Narda Zacchino, an associate editor at The Los Angeles Times, added: 
``There's no harm in counting women. It's just an additional number.'' 
Both women, who are members of the society's diversity committee, 
agree that increased ethnic diversity is the main goal. Counting women, 
they both said, would not interfere. Members of their committee agreed, 
voting in August to include women in the annual census. But the draft 
statement prepared seven weeks later by the society's top officers 
for tomorrow's meeting left women out. Rich Oppel, secretary of the 
society's board, explained that ``it's very important to address the 
issue of women in leadership in newsrooms.'' ``We'll do it,'' he continued. 
``I just don't think the proper way to do it is to bolt it on the 
diversity issue before us today.'' Oppel, editor of The Austin American-Statesman, 
added, ``I worry that including women in this census would complicate 
matters.'' The mission statement that is the centerpiece of the new 
draft declares that ``the nation's newsrooms must reflect the racial 
diversity of American society as soon as possible _ but no later than 
2025.'' ``At a minimum,'' it continues, ``all newspapers should employ 
journalists of color and every newspaper should reflect the diversity 
of its community.'' The census is listed as one of four strategies 
for achieving the goals. For all the intensity of the debate, the 
document's force is symbolic. The editors' group has no authority 
over the hiring policies of any newspaper. Its leadership can exhort, 
cajole and show colleagues how to recruit, train and retain minorities. 
It can enforce nothing. The board does have authority, though, over 
the newsroom census, which counts blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans 
and Asians. The survey shows that gains in the numbers of minority 
employees, once rapid, have slowed, while the percentage of minorities 
in the population accelerated.
