The government dispatched a prominent diplomat to London Sunday, hoping 
he can persuade British authorities to release former dictator Gen. 
Augusto Pinochet from custody. The envoy, Santiago Benadava, will 
press Chile's claim that Pinochet is protected from arrest by diplomatic 
immunity. Britain has rejected the claim, saying Pinochet's diplomatic 
passport did not shield him from an extradition request by a Spanish 
judge. Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the envoy would offer 
Pinochet only diplomatic advice. Any courtroom counsel Pinochet may 
eventually require must be arranged by the former leader's family, 
he said. Pinochet, 82, was arrested Friday at the request of a Spanish 
magistrate who is investigating the deaths of Spanish citizens during 
the former leader's often harsh 17-year rule. Pinochet, who holds 
a special lifetime seat in the Chilean Senate, was recovering from 
back surgery at a London clinic at the time of his arrest. Pinochet's 
family issued a statement Sunday in Chile Sunday calling the arrest 
of the former leader ``an insult'' and thanking the government, rightist 
politicians and the military for their support. The former leader's 
son, Augusto, said his family would hire ``the best legal team available 
in London'' to represent his father. Chile's President Eduardo Frei, 
attending a summit in Porto, Portugal, said Spain's extradition request 
was tantamount to not recognized Chile's institutions. ``It is only 
for Chilean courts to try events occurred in Chile,'' Frei said. Several 
right-wing politicians, including some who held posts in the Pinochet 
regime, also were flying to London to express their support to their 
former boss. Others in Chile praised the arrest, saying Pinochet may 
finally have to account for alleged abuses committed by his regime. 
According to a government report issued after Pinochet left office, 
4,299 political opponents were killed or disappeared during his rule. 
At least 12 lawsuits have been filed in Chile against Pinochet by 
relatives of victims. But his diplomatic immunity as a senator and 
a 1978 amnesty law issued by his regime has so far shielded him from 
any questioning by a judge. The Chilean capital was the scene of dualing 
demonstrations on Sunday, reflecting the longstanding division of 
public opinion over Pinochet. Scores of demonstrators joined a march 
to Santiago's central cemetery for a memorial ceremony honoring the 
victims of Pinochet's government. Almost simultaneously, a crowd of 
Pinochet supporters rallied peacefully for the second straight day 
in front of the British and Spanish embassies.
