More than 200 national guard troops have been called out in Texas 
after two days of violent storms. The death toll today rose today 
to ten. A man was killed this morning when a tornado hit his mobile 
home near houston, and two more flood victims were found today near 
San Antonio. ABC's Erin Hayes is there. There have been here, morning 
to midnight, all through the weekend, hundreds of rescues. It was 
unbelievable how fast the water came up. The rivers and creeks have 
been rising so quickly, many have found themselves stranded in a matter 
of just minutes. Rescuers have been racing, trying to get ahead of 
the water, warn people. But in so many areas, there has been no time 
for warning, barely time enough to pull families from their flooded 
homes and rush them to dry land, with all they could save what they 
carried in their hands. There are still many people missing, including 
a 6-year-old boy not seen since yesterday. It has been, for the San 
Antonio region, an unexpected and unprecedented assault by nature. 
It has gone down in the record books as the greatest single-day rainfall, 
over 11 1/4 inches of rain, and now October is the wettest October 
ever. The worst appears to be over for the city of San Antonio, but 
there is rain in the forecast for tonight, and communities downriver 
are bracing themselves for the water now headed their way. Emergency 
officials, including all of the state troopers here and 250 national 
guardsmen, have been activated, told to be ready to work rescues through 
the night. Erin Hayes, ABC News, San Antonio, Texas.
