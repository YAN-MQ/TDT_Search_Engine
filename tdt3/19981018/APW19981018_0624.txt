Spain's government on Sunday avoided saying whether it would back 
efforts to extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from 
London to face questioning about Spaniards killed in Chile under his 
rule. Investigating magistrates Baltasar Garzon and Manuel Garcia 
Castellon were believed to be preparing to travel to London to interrogate 
Pinochet, who was arrested there Friday by police acting on a warrant 
submitted by Garzon. The two magistrates have been investigating Pinochet's 
alleged role in the deaths of Spaniards in Chile under his regime 
and of Chileans in Argentina as part of an operation by South American 
military juntas that teamed up to help each other crush dissent in 
the 1970s and '80s. Garzon has 40 days from Friday to present a formal 
extradition request to Britain. Any such request must first pass through 
the Spanish Justice Ministry and then be approved by the cabinet of 
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, said an official in Aznar's office. 
But a lawyer involved in efforts to bring Pinochet to trial in Spain, 
Enrique Santiago, insisted that extradition requests are made between 
judges and it would be illegal for Aznar to try to block one. The 
ultimate decision on whether to extradite Pinochet lies with British 
Home Secretary Jack Straw. Aznar was elusive on the issue Sunday. 
Speaking in Oporto, Portugal where he was attending the Ibero-American 
summit, he said: ``the task of the government is to comply with the 
law and cooperate with the judiciary.'' But he declined to say pointblank 
if he would in fact approve a bid to extradite Pinochet. His deputy 
prime minister, Rodrigo Rato, speaking to reporters in Bilbao, was 
equally vague. Aznar's government has opposed the probes by Garzon 
and Garcia Castellon, saying they could upset delicate political dynamics 
in countries that suffered years of brutal military rule. State prosecutors 
at Spain's National Court had filed appeals seeking to block the probes 
on grounds that the crimes being investigated were committed outside 
Spain. Garzon argues that the Pinochet affair is a case of potential 
genocide and thus covered under Spanish law no matter where it occurred. 
Spanish state radio said Garzon and Garcia Castellon need to complete 
several more legal formalities before traveling to London to question 
Pinochet, who was arrested in a clinic where he was recovering from 
back surgery. Earlier news reports had said they might travel as early 
as Sunday. Spanish newspapers on Sunday hailed the arrest of Pinochet 
as a triumph for justice and a warning to other despots. The center-right 
daily El Mundo said in an editorial that regardless of whether Pinochet 
is extradited to Spain, the mere fact that he was arrested is charged 
with symbolism. ``It is a lesson that the decrepit, retired executioner 
... will finally be treated as a criminal and forced to answer for 
his actions before international justice,'' the paper said. ``Not 
just for him, but for other despots and would-be despots around the 
world,'' the pape added. ``There can be no borders for prosecuting 
violations of human rights.''
