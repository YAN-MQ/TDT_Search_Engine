When you buy a new car, you want it to be safe, dependable and comfortable. 
And that includes the car's seats. Automakers have been able to test 
a seat for safety, but not really comfort, until now. Michael Collins 
reports. Car simulators are nothing new for the auto industry, but 
Johnson controls has just spent close to $2 million on this simulator 
the company says can do what no other simulator has done before -- 
measure comfort. Up until now, measuring comfort has been an inexact 
science. It would be dictated by subjective opinions of people. And 
that would be dependent on their shape and size, and the time they 
drove the vehicle and what stages they drove the vehicle. Of course, 
the most important part of a car's comfort are the seats, and that's 
what this simulator gauges. It uses a wraparound projection screen 
and a hydraulic shaker table to duplicate real-life road conditions. 
And the motion-analysis systems monitor pressure points on the passengers. 
Before the simulator, a new car could be well along in the development 
process before engineers could begin to gauge its comfort level. And 
at that point, if something was wrong the changes could be expensive. 
This simulator allows various automakers to test different designs 
for a Car's interior as it's being built. If you don't and you do 
it at the end, it's expensive. You have to change a lot of hardware 
and do a lot of tooling, a lot of product development over. So the 
simulator gives a consumers chance at comfort, a head start, and in 
the long run saves money in the process. Michael Collins, for CNN, 
Plymouth, Michigan.
