A presidential envoy kidnapped in breakaway Chechnya has been taken 
to the neighboring republic of Dagestan, where a deal was being worked 
out for his release, a news report said Sunday. Valentin Vlasov, President 
Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya, was abducted at gunpoint in May 
while traveling from Grozny, the Chechen capital, to the neighboring 
republic of Ingushetia. He has now been taken from Chechnya to Dagestan, 
where his captors are negotiating with law enforcement officials for 
a ransom, Supyan Akhmadov, an official with the Chechen interior ministry 
who monitors kidnappings, told the Interfax news agency Sunday. Akhmadov 
did not say how much ransom was being demanded. Russian media have 
reported that the kidnappers have asked for up to dlrs 4 million. 
Hundreds of people, including several foreigners, have been kidnapped 
in Chechnya and surrounding regions, usually for ransom, since the 
region's two-year war for independence from Russia ended in 1996.
