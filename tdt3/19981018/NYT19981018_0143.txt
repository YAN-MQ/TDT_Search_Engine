In San Antonio, the Red Cross had to evacuate its downtown headquarters, 
losing its telephones and lists of volunteers to rising water. In 
nearby Seguin, the main water treatment plant washed out and left 
the farming town of 21,000 without potable water. In Austin, firefighters 
bustled 50 members of a Jazzercise class out of a recreation center 
along Shoal Creek just minutes before floodwaters swept through the 
building's parking lot and claimed four parked automobiles. All over 
the Central Texas hill country Sunday, residents warily watched leaden 
skies and began to clean up after record-breaking rains blanketed 
the area on Saturday, claiming at least seven lives statewide including 
five in San Antonio. Two small children were reported missing in Caldwell 
County, east of Austin, according to the Texas Department of Public 
Safety. The heavy rains were expected to continue Sunday night, though 
with less intensity. Within the 90-mile-long Austin-San Antonio Corridor, 
Bexar, Comal and Hays counties had been declared disaster areas by 
local officials, and hundreds of intersections remained impassable 
by mid-afternoon Sunday. In New Braunfels, 1,400 people spent the 
night in emergency shelters as the Guadalupe and Comal rivers _ swollen 
by a record 21.5 inches of rain _ roared out of their banks through 
parts of the city, flooding neighborhoods and destroying dozens of 
homes. George Snell, director of the local Red Cross, said survey 
teams assisted by the National Guard were still assessing the extent 
of the damage late Sunday afternoon. ``We're having difficulty getting 
into some areas because of high water and we don't have any definitive 
counts yet. So far we've had no loss of life reported here, but it's 
clear there's been a lot of property damage,'' he said. Snell said 
it could be days before a clear picture of the storm's total devastation 
emerges.
