Pilots for federal express could be on strike soon. Their union leaders 
are meeting today to decide whether to seek strike authorization from 
members. The delivery service's 3,400 pilots have never had a contract. 
That's something the union wants changed. But it says it disagrees 
with the company on important issues such as retirement benefits, 
pay, work rules and job protection. The union is expected to announce 
its decision later today.
