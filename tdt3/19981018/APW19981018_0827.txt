A Serb traffic policeman stood in the deserted intersection, bright 
white sleeve covers on his arms, white hat on his head _ ready to 
direct what was probably the only car in this shattered Kosovo town. 
The journalists' armored vehicle turned right and came to a stop. 
Junik is ghostly. Two old men sat on a step quietly conversing. Are 
the ethnic Albanians driven from this village by Serb troops and police 
returning to their homes now that President Slobodan Milosevic has 
reached a deal with American troubleshooter Richard Holbrooke? a reporter 
asks. Yes, a lot of people are coming back, the policeman responds. 
Some people are indeed coming back, the two old men agree when asked 
the same question. But only the elderly, a few women and some children. 
The young people are still afraid, says an elderly man in a dirty, 
blue beret. Seventy percent of the people from Junik are in Albania, 
just eight kilometers (five miles) over the mountains to the west, 
says one of three women sitting in the dirt outside what used to be 
her apartment, a once-elegant red-brick building now in tatters. ``It 
used to be real nice,'' she says with an embarrassed shrug, nodding 
toward her battered home. When the international observers come, the 
people will come back, she says. Perhaps. Until then, the policeman 
will continue to direct non-existent traffic, old men will hobble 
by on walking sticks. A few women and children will try to piece their 
lives together. The two Yugoslav army soldiers will remain camped 
in an abandoned building nearby. And this once pretty little village 
under the towering Albanian mountains will struggle between life and 
death. --- It's startling to hear the laughter of children. Up in 
the hills of central Kosovo where thousands of families are living 
in the open. Homeless. With little food. With not much hope. Children 
have already died from exposure in this wretched province. Yet they 
still can laugh. In a field near a small stream outside the battered 
village of Pagarusa, several families are camped under the ubiquitous 
plastic sheets. Foam mattresses on the ground. The women, unwashed 
and overworked, attend to the daily chores of cooking simple meals 
and caring for children. Despite everything, children can still be 
children. Shouts and laughter can still be heard echoing through the 
verdant hills. Not so often, perhaps, but sometimes. --- ``I'm tired,'' 
said the toothless old woman in the cream-colored headscarf. ``I'm 
alone. I'm living only with my God.'' Limping slowly down the nearly 
deserted street in a bullet-pocked Kosovo village, the ethnic Albanian 
woman said she doesn't remember how old she is. She thinks she is 
either 76 or 80. She can't quite remember her name either. She knows 
her family is gone and that she fled her village at the foot of the 
mountains on the western side of the province, but decided to come 
back. Being home hasn't helped. She is so, so lonely. ``My house was 
not shelled,'' she acknowledges, though many of the others in the 
village were. ``But it's falling down anyway.'' It's the loneliness, 
she says, grasping the hand of the man who stopped her in the street. 
``Thank you. Thank you for talking to me.''
