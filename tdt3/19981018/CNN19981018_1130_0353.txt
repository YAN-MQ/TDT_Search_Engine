Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi says he doesn't want an international 
confrontation over the suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. 
The United States and Great Britain are demanding he turn over the 
two libyan citizens for trial. A British newspaper quotes Gadhafi 
as saying he'll turn them over, but only if they're allowed to serve 
their possible sentences in a Dutch or Libyan prison. Pan Am Flight 
103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 killing all 270 people.
