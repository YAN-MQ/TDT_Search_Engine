Protesters on Sunday demanded removal of two sculptures on display 
at Israel's Supreme Court after the artist was quoted as saying disabled 
and elderly people and homosexuals are ``superfluous'' and should 
be ``eliminated by the state.'' A court spokesman said the sculptures 
were already slated for removal because an exhibit of works by artist 
Uri Lipschitz had ended. The protesters likened Lipschitz's remarks, 
made in an interview published in the weekend magazine of the Haaretz 
newspaper, to views of the Nazis. About 100 protesters, made up of 
members of a leftist political party, gay and lesbian activists and 
the disabled and their supporters covered one of the sculptures with 
paper on Sunday to protest the comments. They demanded its removal, 
along with that of another Lipschitz sculpture inside the building. 
Works by Lipschitz were displayed at the court for a month as part 
of an exhibit marking Israel's 50th anniversary. The paintings were 
taken down Thursday when the exhibit ended, before his comments were 
published. Court spokesman Moshe Gorali said the justices ``condemn 
severely'' Lipschitz's remarks and added that his views were not known 
to exhibit organizers earlier. The sculptures were to have been removed 
at the end of the exhibit, but equipment was not immediately available, 
Gorali said. They were to be removed within a day or two, he said.
