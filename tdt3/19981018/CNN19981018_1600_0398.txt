Paula Jones and her legal team are still waiting for President Clinton's 
lawyers to respond to a settlement offer. Yesterday, the Jones camp 
offered a $2 million out-of-court settlement to drop the sexual harassment 
suit against the president. Jones's lawyer says both sides have a 
lot to consider. Paula Jones has a life-changing decision to make. 
Is she going to go forward? Is this case going to be settled? What's 
going to happen to her after this? So this is not an easy thing for 
her. The president, on the other side, has a big decision to make, 
a very, very big decision to make. A very, very big political decision 
to make, as well as legal decision. So lot of tensions around these 
types of negotiations. Any kind of negotiations I've ever been in, 
in a big case, it's always been very strenuous. The offer would require 
$1 million from the president. The other $1 million would come from 
real estate tycoon abe hirschfeld, who has offered the money to end 
the case.
