There are signs Yugoslavia is living up to its promises about Kosovo. 
NATO U-2 reconnaissance planes began flying over the province yesterday. 
U.S. officials say they revealed "clear indications" that Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic is pulling back at least two of seven 
Serb battalions from Kosovo. The surveillance also showed improved 
access for relief workers. NATO has extended its original deadline 
for compliance after which the possibility of air strikes could be 
renewed.
