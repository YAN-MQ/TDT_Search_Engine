Police are investigating whether an extortionist demanding millions 
from Daimler-Benz struck again Sunday by hurling a stone from a bridge 
at a passing Mercedes. The car avoided the cobblestone, tossed from 
a bridge at an autobahn exit near Dorsten in western Germany, but 
crashed into a guardrail. The driver was uninjured. A police spokesman 
said the person who threw the stone escaped, and no letter was left 
behind. But he said they had notified detectives in Stuttgart investigating 
an extortion attempt made against Daimler-Benz _ the third such case 
this year. The carmaker confirmed Friday that it had received letters 
from someone threatening to toss rocks at Mercedes cars unless it 
paid a ransom of several million marks (dollars). One car was hit 
on Oct. 11 while driving on another autobahn, also in western Germany. 
The car's windshield was smashed but no one was hurt. Investigators 
say the extortionist left behind a letter that time saying: ``This 
time there was just damage to the car. Next time a driver dies.'' 
Daimler-Benz has been targeted twice before by extortionists. One 
man who threatened to shoot at Mercedes drivers unless he was paid 
5 million marks (dlrs 3 million) was arrested during the ransom drop 
in February. He was convicted in September and sentenced to almost 
five years in prison. In the other case, a man threatened to tamper 
with Mercedes cars unless he was paid 30 million marks (dlrs 19 million). 
He was sentenced to almost three years.
