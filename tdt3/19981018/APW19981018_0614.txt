Four train cars carrying a liquid gas derailed in western Ukraine 
and one of them caught fire, emergency officials said Sunday. The 
fire damaged the rails, though no casualties were reported, Ukraine's 
Emergency Situations Ministry said, according to the ITAR-Tass news 
agency. The accident occurred Saturday night in the Lviv region, near 
Ukraine's border with Poland and Slovakia. The train had 61 freight 
cars, most of which were carrying chemicals from Slovakia to the Russian 
city of Ryazan. Some of the cars were carrying ammonia and propane, 
ITAR-Tass said. It didn't say what kind of gas was in the cars that 
derailed. Train traffic resumed Sunday.
