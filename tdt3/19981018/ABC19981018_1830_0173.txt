President Clinton spent this day in rural Maryland, trying to end 
the deadlock in the mideast peace negotiations. Still, no deal. But 
negotiators announced they will probably extend into tomorrow. ABC's 
Mike Von Fremd has the latest. President Clinton and Al Gore met first 
with Israel's hard-line foreign minister, ariel Sharon, who joined 
the negotiations today. Then, President Clinton met with Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat. But still no agreement. Arafat and Benjamin 
Netanyahu have not met face-to-face here in two days. I have not heard 
any of those who very much want there to be an agreement concerned 
that the lack of a direct meeting since Friday between the two is 
going to block the prospect for an agreement. In fact, substantial 
progress has been made on satisfying israel's security concerns. Sources 
say that United States security officials will verify that palestinian 
terrorists who were sent to jail remain there. The U.S. will also 
verify the size and strength of the Palestinian police force, to keep 
it from growing to a size that threatens Israel. Gains for the Palestinians 
so far -- Israel is close to signing off on allowing the Palestinians 
to run their own airport. But there is no agreement on a Palestinian 
seaport or the release of palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. 
Significant differences remain, but given their investment, it is 
hard to believe that any of the leaders -- Arafat, Netanyahu or President 
Clinton -- Want to walk away from here empty-handed. Mike Von Fremd, 
ABC News, wye mills, Maryland.
