The federal government's anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft heads 
to the courtroom tomorrow. Observers say it's one of the most important 
business trials of the century. Steve young explains what's at stake. 
The showdown between Microsoft and federal and state prosecutors started 
out as a so-called tying case. Microsoft, accused of forcing PC companies 
to use its Internet browser if they wanted to get the crucial windows 
operating system. It has broadened to include charges that the software 
giant, using monopoly power, has bullied a string of companies including 
Netscape, Compaq and apple. What's at stake is enormous. Microsoft 
has the most powerful and lucrative monopoly in the history of the 
world. At issue in this case is whether the department of justice 
can force that powerful company to obey our competition laws. Microsoft 
admits it plays hardball, but it hasn't illegally bullied anyone. 
It denies using its muscle to prevent new technologies, such as Internet 
products, from threatening its core product, windows. From the outset 
of its legal troubles, Microsoft's Mantra has been that all it's doing 
is offering consumers great software products. We think the important 
issue here is the right to innovate, the freedom to innovate our products 
on an ongoing basis, based on what we learn from consumers. Microsoft 
has warned Wall Street analysts that the first part of trial will 
produce Negative publicity and investors need to be thick-skinned 
until Microsoft presents its case in several weeks. The question is 
not whether they are a tough player and is there locker room talk 
and E-mails. The question really is there any violations of Sherman 
act antitrust violations, and that's really the key question. The 
missing man is the company's chief strategist, its chairman and CEO. 
Each side gets 12 witnesses and Bill Gates is not on the government's 
witness list, but in an effort to counter the testimony of company 
witnesses, the justice department is expected to try playing segments 
of gates' combative pretrial deposition which were videotaped. Steve 
young, "CNN Financial News," New York.
