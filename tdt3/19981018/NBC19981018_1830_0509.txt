Some members of Chile's ruling coalition are turning their back on 
former dictator augusto Pinochet, saying justice should take its "natural 
course." Pinochet was arrested Friday in London and is awaiting possible 
extradition to Spain. Anti-Pinochet demonstrators gathered again today 
outside the clinic where he is being held while recovering from back 
surgery. Pinochet could face murder charges for crimes committed after 
he seized power in 1973.
