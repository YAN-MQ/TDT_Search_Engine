Tens of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries being dropped from health 
maintenance organizations have suddenly found themselves in a confusing 
predicament, with no reliable information about their options and 
no guarantee of coverage for costly prescription drugs. Moreover, 
the Clinton administration and the health insurance industry disagree 
over the rights and protections available to such Medicare beneficiaries, 
who receive a bewildering variety of conflicting information when 
they try to buy private insurance to supplement Medicare. Federal 
officials acknowledged that their interpretation of the Medicare law 
would not necessarily be accepted by all the companies that sell insurance 
to fill gaps in Medicare, known as Medigap insurance. Such companies 
are regulated primarily by the states, and many said they were unfamiliar 
with their new obligations to consumers under federal law, as interpreted 
by the administration. In addition, some insurers contend that they 
do not have to comply with the federal insurance standards until states 
adopt laws and regulations to carry them out. One person affected 
by the changes, Anthony DeMarco, an 87-year-old retired purchasing 
agent in Paso Robles, Calif., said he had been desperately trying 
to arrange coverage since he learned a few weeks ago that he would 
be dropped by his HMO. ``The problem now is that I've got to go out 
and find something I can afford,'' he said in an interview. DeMarco 
said he had had excellent coverage under an HMO for $32 a month, but 
would probably have to pay $114 a month for insurance to supplement 
the traditional Medicare program, to which he is returning. Frank 
Fertschneider, 72, of Atascadero, Calif., said he was in a similar 
quandary. ``It's very disconcerting not to know how we are going to 
manage after the end of December,'' he said. Doris Cole-Hatchard, 
a 66-year-old retiree being dropped by the Oxford HMO in Rockland 
County, N.Y., said she was eager to get a Medigap policy covering 
prescription drugs because she was taking medications for angina, 
high blood pressure and high cholesterol. But she said she was ``very 
upset'' when she found that the premium would be $270 a month. HMOs 
in 29 states have notified the federal government that they are pulling 
out of Medicare or reducing their service areas on Jan. 1, in part 
because their costs are rising faster than expected. The actions will 
affect more than 414,000 beneficiaries. Elyse Politi, the Medicare 
managed care ombudsman in northern Virginia, said, ``The biggest concern 
for consumers here is that they haven't received any official notices 
from the Health Care Financing Administration or from the HMOs about 
what their options will be when the HMOs terminate their Medicare 
contracts on December 31.'' Judith Stein, director of the Center for 
Medicare Advocacy in Willimantic, Conn., said: ``There's a lot of 
fear and confusion, a feeling of abandonment among seniors. They were 
encouraged to join these HMOs, and the plans have now decided to leave. 
It's a very volatile situation.'' Beneficiaries have two basic options. 
They can enroll in another HMO, if one is available in their area 
and if it has the capacity to take new customers. Or they can enroll 
in the original Medicare program, with or without Medigap insurance. 
Federal officials emphasize that the traditional Medicare program 
is always available. But they acknowledge that it often costs more 
than an HMO, and they say there is no guarantee that beneficiaries 
can obtain Medigap policies covering prescription drugs, one of the 
biggest medical expenses for people who are elderly or disabled. There 
are 10 standard Medigap policies designated ``A'' through ``J.'' Federal 
officials say that a person dropped from a Medicare HMO has a right 
to buy certain types of Medigap insurance in the first 63 days of 
1999. The Medigap policies that must be made available _ the ones 
designated ``A,'' ``B,'' ``C'' and ``F'' _ provide basic benefits, 
but do not cover prescription drugs. In a series of questions and 
answers for Medicare beneficiaries, the Clinton administration says 
that private insurance to cover prescription drugs is available, but 
that consumers must seek out such coverage on their own. Moreover, 
it says, ``These plans may refuse to sell you a policy based on your 
health status.'' Bonnie Burns, director of consumer education at California's 
statewide insurance counseling program, said Medicare beneficiaries 
faced a grim paradox. ``If you have a health condition that causes 
you to use prescription drugs,'' she said, ``it's unlikely that a 
Medigap insurance company will sell you a new policy covering prescription 
drugs.'' Ms. Burns said that insurance counselors had been overwhelmed 
with telephone calls from people being dropped by Medicare HMOs. ``These 
people were lured into HMOs by low premiums and generous prescription 
drug coverage, and they are distressed because they don't know how 
they will cope with the costs,'' Burns said. ``Many don't even know 
what rights and options they have.'' The administration says an insurance 
company may not attach restrictions to Medigap policies ``A,'' ``B,'' 
``C'' and ``F'' by limiting the coverage of pre-existing medical conditions. 
Likewise, it tells consumers, an insurer may not ``discriminate in 
the price of the policy because of your health status, claims experience, 
receipt of health care or medical condition.'' Federal officials said 
these protections applied to disabled people, as well as to the elderly. 
But Charles Kahn III, chief operating officer of the Health Insurance 
Association of America, strenuously disagreed. ``The Clinton administration 
is trying to set health policy by administrative fiat,'' Kahn said. 
``Congress had an opportunity to change the rules for the disabled 
last year and chose not to do so.'' Further, Kahn said: ``Disabled 
people who choose to buy Medigap policies are likely to have higher 
health costs than the average senior covered by Medicare and Medigap. 
Requiring insurance companies to sell Medigap policies to the disabled, 
at standard rates regardless of their claims experience, will lead 
inevitably to higher Medigap premiums for the elderly.'' Premiums 
were already rising rapidly, with many Medigap insurers reporting 
a cumulative increase of more than 45 percent over the last three 
years. Thomas McCormack, an expert on health benefits for people with 
disabilities, said: ``Insurance companies usually avoid selling Medigap 
policies to disabled people under 65. They restrict the benefits or 
charge prohibitive premiums, much higher than those charged to the 
elderly.'' Carl Scott, senior vice president of Mutual of Omaha Cos., 
said Medigap insurers were being forced to subsidize HMOs bailing 
out of Medicare. ``After enrolling all these Medicare beneficiaries, 
HMOs are dumping them back into the market, presumably because they've 
become unprofitable,'' Scott said. ``We have to absorb them. It's 
an unfair tax on our Medicare supplement policyholders, who'll have 
to pay higher premiums.'' Mutual of Omaha provides Medigap coverage 
to 200,000 people. The American Association of Retired Persons offers 
popular Medigap policies underwritten by United Healthcare. Telephone 
operators at United said this coverage was available only to members 
of the association. But it is unclear whether federal law allows such 
restrictions. Under the administration's reading of the law, Medicare 
beneficiaries dropped from an HMO should be able to buy any of the 
four designated policies, regardless of whether they belong to the 
association. A spokesman for the organization said membership dues 
were $8 a year.
