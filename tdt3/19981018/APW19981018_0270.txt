Female politicians in Germany's incoming center-left government pressed 
demands Sunday that a woman be nominated as the next president, while 
party leaders insisted they already had their candidate _ a man. ``It's 
high time that a woman takes over the office of president,'' Social 
Democratic lawmaker Hanna Wolf said in the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. 
A newly elected lawmaker, Monika Griefahn, called on Johannes Rau, 
the choice of Social Democratic party leaders, to step aside and let 
``a woman come up.'' They recommended Jutta Limbach, chief justice 
of Germany's Constitutional Court. But media reports said Chancellor-elect 
Gerhard Schroeder and his Social Democratic party chairman, Oskar 
Lafontaine, still intend to nominate Rau, the 67-year-old retired 
governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state. ``He's it for me, and for 
Lafontaine and Schroeder and many others who have said it again and 
again,'' SPD general manager Franz Muentefering told German television. 
Roman Herzog, who currently holds the mainly ceremonial post, has 
said he would not stand again when his five-year term expires in May. 
The president is nominated by the chancellor and elected by parliament.
