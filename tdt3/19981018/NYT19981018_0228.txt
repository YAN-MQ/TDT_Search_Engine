For the second time in 30 days, Mike Tyson will appear before the 
Nevada State Athletic Commission here Monday and try to convince its 
five members that he should be given back his boxing license. The 
commission revoked Tyson's license on July 9, 1997, after he bit Evander 
Holyfield's ears during their heavyweight championship bout on June 
28, 1997. The commission is trying to determine whether Tyson is prone 
to snap again if he gets back into the ring. If Tyson, 32, is denied 
a license, he can't apply again until Oct. 19, 1999. Tyson was expected 
to answer the commission's questions regarding his mental fitness 
and their questions regarding an Aug. 31 incident in Gaithersburg, 
Md., where he allegedly assaulted two men following a traffic mishap 
involving him and his wife. ``He's open to whatever the commission 
wants to know,'' said Shelly Finkel, Tyson's boxing adviser.
