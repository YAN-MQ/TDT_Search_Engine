The longtime dream of one Alabama man is finally coming true more 
than two years after his death. Michael Scott died, along with his 
wife and son, in July of 1996 in the crash of TWA flight 800 off long 
island, New York. Today, the Michael Scott learning center will be 
dedicated in his honor in stevenson, Alabama. Residents say Scott 
was pushing for a center to help the community's children, at the 
time of the death.
