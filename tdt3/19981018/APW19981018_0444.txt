Nearly half of Spain's Basques oppose outright independence for their 
semi-autonomous region as sought by the separatist group ETA, according 
to a poll released Sunday a week before a key regional election. While 
42.8 percent of those surveyed oppose independence, 35.1 percent said 
they would vote to secede from Spain if a referendum were held, said 
the poll carried out by Instituto Opina and published by the Barcelona 
newspaper La Vanguardia. The rest of those questioned either did not 
answer or said they had no opinion. But, paradoxically, 46.5 percent 
of Basques said their region should have a constitutional right to 
break away from Spain, even if they don't exercise it. The survey 
was among a slew of polls released on the last day such data can be 
made public before the Basque regional election next Sunday, when 
voters will pick a new regional president and renew a 75-seat legislature. 
It will be the first election since ETA declared a ceasefire a month 
ago after a 30-year campaign for an independent Basque homeland. Most 
of the polls predicted that the mainstream Basque Nationalist Party, 
which pressed ETA for a truce, will remain the region's top party 
but, as in the outgoing legislature, fall short of a majority and 
need allies to pass bills. A survey in El Mundo said the Popular Party, 
in power in Madrid, would gain the most seats in the Basque election. 
It will go from fourth place to possibly second. Fighting it for second 
is a coalition that includes the pro-ETA party Herri Batasuna, the 
poll said. Another major daily, El Pais, said 40 percent of the people 
it answered refused to say how they would vote. The center-right government 
of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has said ETA must publicly accept 
the election results and lay down its arms in order for a peace process 
to begin in earnest. So far the government has reacted cautiously, 
saying it would wait to see the elections results before acting. However 
last week it did agree to move four ETA prisoners closer to home. 
Such transfers are a long-standing ETA demand.
