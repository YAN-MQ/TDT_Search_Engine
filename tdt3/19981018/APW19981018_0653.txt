The leader of Germany's Jewish community accused a U.S. attorney of 
hindering talks aimed at securing compensation for Holocaust victims 
from German companies. Ignatz Bubis, president of the Central Council 
of Jews in Germany, said in Monday's Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper 
that lawyer Ed Fagan was using Nazi victims for his own financial 
gain. ``Fagan doesn't want anything more than to earn a lot of money,'' 
the newspaper quoted him as saying. Fagan has been the lead attorney 
in several lawsuits filed in New York on behalf of Holocaust victims. 
He is seeking compensation from German banks that handled assets of 
Holocaust victims, as well as companies that used slave labor during 
World War II. Bubis said he believed ``the companies would quickly 
reach an agreement with the World Jewish Congress'' if they weren't 
facing legal action from Fagan and other attorneys. An advance copy 
of the interview was released Sunday. In New York, Fagan said his 
lawsuits were responsible for forcing institutions to finally address 
the issue of money owed to Holocaust survivors. ``What Bubis and the 
organizations are worried about is being exposed for their failure 
to do anything for the last 10 to 50 years,'' he said. He also said 
Bubis and leaders of other Jewish organizations had rebuffed overtures 
to work with him or to meet with the survivors he represents. Fagan 
also again denied charges by Bubis and others that he had demanded 
a dlrs 250 million fee from the World Jewish Restitution Organization, 
which recently came to a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement with Swiss banks 
for compensation to Holocaust survivors and heirs. Fagan, who initiated 
the action against Swiss banks two years ago, said he is willing to 
accept whatever fee is deemed appropriate by a court. Elan Steinberg, 
executive director of the World Jewish Congress, said Sunday his group 
believed lawyers should not receive any fees for working on Holocaust-related 
cases. ``Neither lawyers nor anyone else should be making a profit 
from the Holocaust,'' he said in New York. The World Jewish Restitution 
Organization is a branch of the World Jewish Congress.
