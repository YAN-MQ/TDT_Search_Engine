Protesters on Sunday demanded removal of two sculptures on display 
at Israel's Supreme Court after the artist was quoted as saying disabled 
and elderly people and homosexuals are ``superfluous'' and should 
be ``eliminated by the state.'' A court spokesman said the sculptures 
were already slated for removal because an exhibit of works by artist 
Uri Lipschitz had ended. The artist later apologized for offending 
anyone. The protesters likened Lipschitz' remarks, made in an interview 
published in the weekend magazine of the Haaretz newspaper, to views 
of the Nazis. About 100 protesters, made up of members of a leftist 
political party, gay and lesbian activists and the disabled and their 
supporters covered one of the sculptures with paper on Sunday to protest 
the comments. They demanded its removal, along with that of another 
Lipschitz sculpture inside the building. ``I understand that my words 
hurt a lot of people,'' Lipschitz told Israel's Channel 2 TV. ``I 
didn't mean to hurt any person or group or to incite against them. 
I made a mistake, I'm sorry.'' Works by Lipschitz were displayed at 
the court for a month as part of an exhibit marking Israel's 50th 
anniversary. The paintings were taken down Thursday when the exhibit 
ended, before his earlier comments were published. Court spokesman 
Moshe Gorali said the justices ``condemn severely'' Lipschitz's earlier 
remarks and added that his views were not known to exhibit organizers 
earlier. The sculptures were to have been removed at the end of the 
exhibit, but equipment was not immediately available, Gorali said. 
They were to be removed within a day or two, he said.
