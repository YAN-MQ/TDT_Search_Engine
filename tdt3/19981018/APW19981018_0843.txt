A train jumped its tracks at a north Egyptian station and plowed into 
people on the platform, killing at least 45 people, Egypt's official 
news agency said. About 100 people were injured, authorities at the 
scene told the Middle East News Agency. The train was traveling from 
the port of Alexandria to Kafr el-Sheik when it derailed in the station 
of Kafr el-Dawar, a town about 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast 
of Alexandria, the Interior Ministry said. The train went off the 
rails when the driver changed tracks ``at high speed,'' the ministry 
said. The locomotive and the first two passenger cars toppled over 
and careened through people and kiosks on the platform, the ministry 
said. Egyptian television showed a crane moving toward one of the 
overturned train cars as scores of riot police fended off hundreds 
of wailing people. One train car appeared to have crashed into small 
buildings near the railway. A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, 
said the driver was speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered 
with the brake system, the news agency reported. Such trains are usually 
packed with hundreds of commuters, people often hitch rides on the 
roof and between the cars. Egyptian television said the injured had 
been admitted to at least five hospitals. Health Minister Ismail Sallam, 
a practicing surgeon, left his office in Cairo and went to the site 
with a team of doctors, officials said.
