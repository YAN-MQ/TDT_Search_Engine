The truck stop is going high-tech. Anne Kellan reports on some new 
features truckers can find at some stops that are designed to make 
them feel more at home. Who wants to be on TV? Let me in, I got CNN 
with me. We're the lifeblood of this country. If it wasn't for us 
this freight wouldn't be moving. Already got one! Jimmy Bryce, a trucker 
for 16 years enjoys life on the road, especially now, because when 
he fuels-up -- he can hook-up. My dad just died last month, and I'm 
trying to help take care of my mom and stuff. So park 'N view has 
helped out a lot on that because I could get in here and I could call 
without having to get out of the truck. Hello, it's me. Park 'N view 
is a service offered at a growing number of truck stops around the 
United States. Plug in these wires and truckers can talk on the phone, 
watch cable TV, even log onto the Internet -- all inside their parked 
rig. I love the park 'N view. With park 'N view, Thomas lyde has a 
choice of 22 channels carried on a private cable network. What do 
truckers surveyed want to watch? Movies was the number one request. 
So, we offer three HBO channels. Sports was the third request. Number 
two request was the educational kinds of channels, you know, discovery, 
A&E, that type of programming. For a trucker to get the service, they 
can come to a park 'N view vending machine, put in $5, press the button. 
Now this card is good for one day. Or they can put in $30 and that's 
good for a month. The card has a number the trucker uses to dial into 
park 'N view. Cindy stelzer and Susan snitker use the Internet in 
their rig to do business online, even get to know new towns. Hey Texaco. 
Since park 'N view isn't at all truck stops, Jimmy Bryce also travels 
with a small satellite dish just in case he's at a truck stop where 
he can't plug in. You wouldn't want him to miss this report. Come 
on Volvo you wanna be on TV? Ann Kellan, CNN, Atlanta.
