Hundreds of illegal immigrants, most of them saying they came from 
the embattled province of Kosovo, were picked up on Italian shores, 
news reports said Sunday. The Italian news agaency ANSA said that 
since Saturday about 800 people were found trying to come ashore in 
Puglia, southeastern Italy, across the Adriatic from Yugoslavia. Authorities 
detain the immigrants until their identity can be determined. Unless 
the arrivals can prove that they have family or jobs waiting for them 
in Italy or are eligible for political asylum, they will be deported.
