For the seventh consecutive time, Rosenborg finally cemented the Norwegian 
league title after trouncing the bottom team Sogndal 4-0 Sunday. Jan 
Derek Sorensen scored two goals in the 32nd and 59th minutes. With 
two goals in the 43rd and 88th, Sigurd Rushfeldt has 27 goals for 
the season. Sogndal never had a chance. Rosenborg trailed Molde for 
much of the season, but after they beat Molde 2-0 in Molde on Sept. 
26, Rosenborg was about going to give up a hard-won lead. The last 
round is on Oct. 24, but Rosenborg has wrapped up the league with 
at least five points because Molde lost their home game against Stromsgodset 
1-3. Sogndal has been doomed for a while, and they will play in the 
first division and not the elite division next season. Either Haugesund 
or Kongsvinger will follow Sogndal down. In the next round, these 
two teams will play the bottom final at Haugesund. Haugesund needs 
victory, but Kongsvinger only needs a tie to avoid going directly 
down the tube. The loser will play two qualifiers against the first 
division team Kjelsas for the place in the elite division. Next season 
Odd Grenland and Skeid will join Rosenborg in the elite division.
