An Iraqi newspaper on Sunday reiterated the country's allegations 
that U.N. weapons inspectors are spying and warned that ``proper measures'' 
would be taken to protect Iraq's security. The editorial in Al-Thawra, 
published by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath party, came 
a day after Iraq disclosed a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan urging him to stop the inspectors' ``dangerous practices.'' 
The letter, the paper said, ``intends to remind the international 
community that if such an action is not taken (by the United Nations), 
then Iraq is liable to take the proper measures to protect its safety 
and sovereignty.'' The paper did not say what those measures might 
be. Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.N. Special Commission, which 
oversees weapons inspections, of spying. Its charges gained more attention 
after Scott Ritter, an American, quit the team and disclosed that 
U.N. inspectors had been cooperating with Israeli and American intelligence 
agencies. Iraq has been under trade sanctions that were imposed by 
the U.N. Security Council after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The council 
has said they will not be lifted until the U.N. inspectors certify 
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq froze 
cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Aug. 5, effectively blocking spot 
checks for weapons. But it has continued to cooperate with U.N. monitors 
working at sites that were previously surveyed. In his letter to Annan, 
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, demanded an investigation 
into the practices of the 40 U.N. monitors still in the country. Al-Thawra, 
in its editorial, said: ``They are not acting as international representatives. 
They are acting as spies under international cover using the domination 
of the United States on the Special Commission.'' Both the letter 
and the editorial said the monitors had asked about Iraq's agricultural 
and water resources _ issues, they said, were beyond the purview of 
the inspectors. The paper warned that if the monitors' spying activities 
were not stopped, ``Iraq will have to act in the same way it does 
when facing an exposed plot ... in order to protect its safety, sovereignty 
and independence.''
