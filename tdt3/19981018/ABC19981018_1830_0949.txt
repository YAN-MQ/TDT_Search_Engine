U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke says NATO is keeping the trigger cocked 
on serbia. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has nine more days 
to pull his troops out of Kosovo. ABC's Sheila MacVicar is there. 
Still under threat of air strikes, more Serbian forces are withdrawing 
from Kosovo. But diplomatic sources say the Serbs are still a long 
way from complying with NATO demands. They still have far too many 
troops and heavy weapons deployed in the province. The Serbian forces 
may be pulling back, but what they are leaving behind in virtually 
every village is an armed police presence and the police claim that 
increasingly in recent days, they have been targeted by ethnic albanian 
fighters. Outside the village of magura this morning, police investigators 
marked the scene where they said two policemen were ambushed and wounded. 
"This is what happens," says lieutenant nikola, "when we reduce our 
strength." In the past 48 hours, the Serbian media center reports 
12 policemen have been killed, including, they say, four who died 
here last night in what they say was a grenade attack. The Serbian 
media center also says the police never fire back. In the villages, 
that's not what the people say. They say they leave at night because 
of the shooting. Right now it is the western monitors who are charged 
with trying to record who is firing what. An almost impossible task. 
We haven't been here in the night. And I know in the night it is a 
sensitive time here. They will be joined this week by the first of 
at least 800 verifiers, but they will be unarmed and unable to intervene. 
There will be no situation in which we will confront or try to penetrate. 
And that leaves the ethnic Albanians asking, how will they be protected?
