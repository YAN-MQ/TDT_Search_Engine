President Clinton will continue his efforts to breath new life into 
the mideast peace talks under way in Maryland. Mr. Clinton spent much 
of yesterday in conference with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The central issue under discussion 
is plan for an Israeli military pullback from 13% more of the West 
Bank. In return, the Israelis want security guarantees from the Palestinians. 
Newly appointed Israeli foreign minister ariel Sharon and defense 
minister yitzhak mordechai will join in the talks today. A U.S. state 
department spokesman says progress is being made. The constructive 
and pragmatic approach continues. They are working hard on the substantive 
issues. I witnessed a lot of walks in the fields, as opposed to the 
Woods, between key negotiators from our side and the Palestinians 
this afternoon. And I think everyone's mood remains one in which we 
are determined to keep the pace of work as intense as possible. The 
talks are expected to continue through tomorrow and could last longer.
