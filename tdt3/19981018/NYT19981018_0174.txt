The boast has been enough to bring tears to the eyes of University 
of Illinois alums, who can be recognized by the louder-than-a-boom-box 
orange attire they customarily don for the Big Ten football games 
here at Zupke Field. For nearly a century, Illinois has prided itself 
as the birthplace of American homecomings, the autumn ritual of welcoming 
back alumni with parades, dances and football. The first college homecoming, 
legend has it, started when two Illinois students, Dab Williams and 
W. Elmer Ekblaw, invited alumni to the football game on Oct. 16, 1910, 
against its bitter rival, the University of Chicago, and convinced 
the school administration to make a three-day celebration of it. ``Unfortunately,'' 
said William Broom, the associate dean of students at Illinois, referring 
to the school's claim to be the cradle of homecoming, ``it's a myth.'' 
It turns out that Baylor University held a homecoming one year earlier, 
a fact that Baylor officials brought to the attention of Illinois 
partisans a year ago, taking the bragging rights to the Texas campus. 
Now, Illinois has turned almost iconoclastic about some of its homecoming 
rituals. The school announced last month that it would end the tradition 
of crowning a king and queen at its homecoming celebration, which 
took place last week. The university continues to recognize a homecoming 
court, 10 men and 10 women honored for their scholastic and community 
achievements. Saying the coronation created a ``false hierarchy,'' 
Broom said there was ``strong sentiment among student leaders'' to 
end the practice. The event had also become a forum for protest. A 
year ago, the homecoming king and queen wore shirts with a message 
deploring racial stereotypes in a protest against the school's Indian-like 
mascot. While many colleges and high schools continue to crown a king 
and queen at homecoming, academic officials say the tradition has 
undergone some changes over the years. Many high schools have changed 
the format of selecting a king and queen, choosing candidates on the 
basis of scholastic ability and community service, a change that has 
broken the pattern of crowning the prettiest girl and the football 
quarterback. Other schools have added talent shows to their homecoming 
festivities, a way to recognize students who do not wear helmets and 
cleats. And many schools have stopped the annual homecoming parade 
for lack of interest. ``Homecoming today is more the student body, 
and not so much a community event,'' said Terri Busch, an assistant 
principal at Hoffman Estates High School in suburban Chicago, where 
the the parade was stopped several years ago. ``There's a lot of moving 
in and out, especially in the suburbs. And people are just so busy,'' 
Busch said. ``There isn't that same sense of community and old school 
loyalty.'' While homecoming is perhaps most deeply rooted in the Midwest 
_ it comes at a time of celebrating the harvest _ the tradition is 
observed in every region of the country. Some regions, especially 
in the South, have customarily chosen a queen, but not a king. Trying 
to move away from the imperious flavor of choosing a royal court, 
Fort Meade High School in Florida has switched from a homecoming queen 
to ``homecoming sweethearts.'' The student body chooses eight girls, 
who are introduced at a pep rally in alphabetical order, so that no 
one is given a higher rank. Then the field is trimmed to four at the 
big football game, again with each girl introduced in alphabetical 
order. ``But it stays at four _ we don't single out a girl,'' said 
Jackie Burch, the student council adviser at Fort Meade. Some parents 
scorn such changes as part of a touchy-feely notion bent on sparing 
feelings at all costs. They compare to it other egalitarian movements 
in schools, like the elimination of class valedictorians. But plenty 
of other parents, especially those with children whose hearts sink 
as they watch more popular students parade before adoring crowds, 
could not be happier to see a revolt against the old caste system 
of a high school aristocracy. Besides that, they say, the ancestors 
of many Americans came to this country fleeing monarchy, and find 
it silly to put royal crowns on the heads of young girls and boys. 
``Out of here,'' said Jan Binder, who was the Snowball Queen at Monona 
Grove High School in Wisconsin in 1978, and is now the mother of girls 
in grammar school. ``Let's get rid of it tonight _ if not sooner.''
