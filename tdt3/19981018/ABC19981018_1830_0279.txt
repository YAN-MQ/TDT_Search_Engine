One of the world's most notorious dictators is fighting tonight to 
be able to return to his own country. Augusto Pinochet, former strongman 
of Chile, is under arrest in London, where he is recovering from a 
minor operation. Pinochet says he has diplomatic immunity. Britain 
says he doesn't. ABC's Richard Gizbert has the story. In Santiago, 
Chile, general Pinochet's supporters converged on the British embassy 
and had to be held back by police. And the government there -- The 
Chilean government has presented a former protest note -- -- accused 
Britain of breaking the rules. But the general's communist opponents 
in Chile were talking about justice. General augusto Pinochet seized 
power in a bloody 1973 coup. He ruled Chile with an iron fist for 
17 years. At least 3,000 people were killed by his regime. Another 
1,100 are still missing. Today, outside the London clinic where Pinochet 
is detained, Chilean exiles read out the names of the disappeared, 
one by one. Britain arrested Pinochet at Spain's request. Spain blames 
him for the deaths of Spanish nationals in Chile. He was, after all, 
not only president, but head of the armed forces. And the death squads 
were formally and centrally organized within and from the military 
government. Before he gave up power, Pinochet gained immunity from 
prosecution in Chile. But this woman, who hasn't seen her sister since 
1974 and fears she was killed, wants Pinochet prosecuted at home. 
I am ashamed of my country, of the people, coward people, who are 
in power. I am extremely grateful to the British government and to 
the Spanish judge, who have made this possible and have show to Pinochet 
that he cannot get away with his crimes. Spanish investigators plan 
to interrogate Pinochet. They have 40 days to make the case for his 
extradition. The British government says that decision will be left 
to the courts. Pinochet's opponents will wait for that ruling. As 
one of them put it, they've waited 25 years to see the general brought 
to justice, another 40 days is nothing. Richard Gizbert, ABC News, 
London.
