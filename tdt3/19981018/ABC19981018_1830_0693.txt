Two goliaths do battle tomorrow in a courtroom in Washington, D.C., 
when the U.S. justice department takes on Microsoft. As ABC's Terry 
Moran reports, it's a fight that may have repercussions for anyone 
who uses a personal computer. When the Microsoft trial gets under 
way here tomorrow, it will open a window on the fiercely competitive 
behavior of a technological colossus. But the impact of this case 
will reach far beyond the computer industry. If the government wins, 
it will tell dominant firms that they must exercise more caution in 
dealing with competitors and with their customers. If Microsoft prevails, 
it gives dominant firms still greater freedom to choose pricing, product 
development and promotional strategies of their own choosing. A. this 
man sees a striking parallel between the mft mft story and the first 
anti-trust suit against standard oil of Ohio. This is more and more 
shaping up as a case that will begin to define the rules of the game 
in the information age, the way that the standard oil case began to 
define the rules of the game in the industrial age. At the heart of 
the Microsoft case is the government's allegation that the company 
has illegally tied its Internet browser to its windows operating system, 
which is on virtually very personal computer. Microsoft's competitors 
say that's unfair. What's at stake for the customer, the consumer, 
it eliminates their choice. Microsoft executives argue that they're 
winning fairly in the free market, and that the future of the high-tech 
revolution itself is under a threat. There is a principle here that 
we're worth -- we believe is worth fighting for, and that's the ability 
to constantly innovate our products. Whatever happens in this courthouse 
over the next several weeks, a years-long appeals battle is certain. 
For consumers, that means the costs of computing and the nature of 
the internet could end up being determined at the Supreme Court. Terry 
Moran, ABC News, Washington.
