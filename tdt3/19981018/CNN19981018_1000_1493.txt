Imagine living in a house where you don't have to pay the electric 
company and your power comes down out of the sky. It's not science 
fiction, it's solar power. Susan Reed reports. It's a traditional 
home in a traditional neighborhood, but for ted baumgarten, this house 
is about the future, solar energy and saving money. The monthly electric 
Bill for this pool is $0. 600 solar homes are on this year's national 
tour. People want to know how well solar power works and how much 
it costs. You don't have to be a hippie. You don't have to be a millionaire. 
You just have to be someone interested in saving money and taking 
care of the planet. Most solar homes are in rural areas, where the 
cost of running electricity is prohibitive. But prices are coming 
down, and technology is improving, so city dwellers are getting interested. 
It's also like sort of not accepting these higher energy costs when 
you may not need to. The sun warms this house by day, and reserve 
power heats it by night. Generating your own electricity is harder 
than writing a check to the power company, but not by much. You need 
a medium technical knowledge, and you can manage it really easily. 
Here, the solar panels look like part of the modern architecture, 
but on most homes, they can be discreetly placed out of sight. By 
now, you're probably thinking, "yeah, solar energy's great if you 
live somewhere it's perpetually sunny." But you would be surprised 
to know that it's working in places where they get as much snow as 
sun. This office is warmed by the sun's infrared Rays all year long. 
In fact Alan claims Chicago gets as much heat energy as northern Florida. 
Just because you can't see the sun's Rays doesn't mean we don't get 
heat energy. Solar systems can cost around $25,000. But just imagine 
the thrill of watching your electric meter run backwards, generating 
power instead of paying for it. Susan Reed, CNN, La Crescenta, California.
