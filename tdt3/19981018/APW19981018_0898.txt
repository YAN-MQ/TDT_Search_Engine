A recent intelligence assessment by the Israeli army found that extremism 
among Jewish settlers in the tense West Bank city of Hebron is on 
the rise and warned that it could lead to an act of terror, Israel 
TV reported Sunday. Written three weeks ago, the classified report 
characterized the situation among the settlers as dangerous and suggested 
that a settler from the militant Jewish community may be planning 
an attack similar to one which American-born Baruch Goldstein carried 
out in 1994. Then, Goldstein massacred 29 Muslim worshipers when he 
sprayed machine-gun fire into a prayer hall in Hebron. Israel TV said 
the report found that Hebron's settlers are showing signs of real 
distress and a lack of security. They are uncertain of their future 
there and are haunted by the threat of attack from Palestinians, Israel 
TV reported. The divided city, home to 450 settlers and 130,000 Palestinians, 
is a hotbed of violence. In recent weeks, a settler rabbi was stabbed 
to death, a Palestinian boy was killed by the Israeli army, an Israeli 
woman was shot in the leg and clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian 
youths raged for days. In 1994, an American-born settler from the 
nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba massacred 29 Muslim worshipers. The 
Israeli army said it could not comment immediately on the report. 
Spokesmen for the Hebron settlers were not immediately available. 
The document also made special mention of Moshe Levinger, the founder 
and spiritual leader of the Hebron settlers, who has served tim in 
jail for killing a Palestinian in Hebron, noting his increased involvement 
in settlement activities and security arrangements.
