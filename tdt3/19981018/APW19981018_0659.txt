A partial West Bank agreement is likely to emerge from the Mideast 
summit talks President Bill Clinton is hosting, but completion of 
a full accord would probably take several weeks, diplomatic sources 
said Sunday. Clinton prepared to return here for a third day of U.S. 
mediation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat, this time with Vice President Al Gore at his 
side. ``There's important work being done here,'' White House spokesman 
Joe Lockhart told reporters after Clinton and Gore arrived on separate 
helicopters _ and steered clear of the news media. Palestinian sources 
told The Associated Press the talks ``have become very difficult,'' 
particularly on whether another Israeli pullback on the West Bank 
would follow the one being negotiated and on Israel's demand that 
terrorism suspects be extradited to Israel for trial. However, the 
sources, insisting on anonymity, said Palestinian negotiator Saeb 
Erekat, U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and Danny Naveh, the Israeli Cabinet 
secretary, were working on drafts of other provisions. Also, the sources 
said, CIA director George Tenet had a long meeting Saturday with Muhammed 
Dahlan, Palestinian security chief, and their ideas would be presented 
Sunday to the Israelis. James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, 
reiterated that ``our goal continues to be to do all the work that 
needs to be done by today,'' the unofficial deadline for an agreement. 
Clinton reportedly wants a signing ceremony on Monday.
