The leader of Germany's Jewish community accused a U.S. attorney of 
hindering talks aimed at securing compensation for Holocaust victims 
from German companies. Ignatz Bubis, president of the Central Council 
of Jews in Germany, said in Monday's Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper 
that lawyer Ed Fagan was using Nazi victims for his own financial 
gain. ``Fagan doesn't want anything more than to earn a lot of money,'' 
the newspaper quoted him as saying. Fagan has been the lead attorney 
in several lawsuits filed in New York on behalf of Holocaust victims. 
He is seeking compensation from German banks that handled assets of 
Holocaust victims, as well as companies that used slave labor during 
World War II. Bubis said he believed ``the companies would quickly 
reach an agreement with the World Jewish Congress'' if they weren't 
facing legal action from Fagan and other attorneys. An advance copy 
of the interview was released Sunday. Fagan did not immediately return 
a message left at his New York office Sunday. Last week, Bubis charged 
Fagan also wanted a dlrs 250 million fee from the World Jewish Restitution 
Organization, which recently came to a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement 
with Swiss banks for compensation to Holocaust survivors and heirs. 
Fagan, who initiated the action against Swiss banks two years ago, 
has denied asking for a 20 percent commission. He said in August he 
had not yet asked for any fee in the case but would petition the court 
for payment as is standard in class-action lawsuits.
