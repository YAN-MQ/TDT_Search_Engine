About 300 skydivers gathered in Fayetteville, West Virginia, for the 
19th annual bridge day. There, yesterday, the brave participants jumped 
from the new river Gorge bridge, 876 feet high. Two of the daredevils 
were hurt in the process. The bridge is the second highest in the 
United States, bested only by the royal Gorge bridge, which towers 
1,000 feet over the Arkansas river in colorado.
