Advantage Yankees. I'm Anthony Keith James, and this is "Headline 
Sports." The Yankees will try to keep the momentum going when they 
play the padres tonight in game two of the world series. New York 
sending Orlando Hernandez to the hill. His stellar pitching performance 
in game four of the alcs helped the yankees even the series. San Diego 
counters with right-hander Andy Ashby, who received two no decisions 
in his two nlcs starts. Saturday, New York exploded for seven runs 
in the seventh to take the opener of the fall classic, 9-6. Tino Martinez 
blasting a grand slam. I knew eventually, I'd come up and then get 
a big hit, you know? The time had to come eventually. It was an ugly 
win, but, you know, bottom line is, it's a win. And I'll take it, 
I don't care if it's 10-9, whatever. It's a win.
