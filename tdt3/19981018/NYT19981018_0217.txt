The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 19: A new 
report by the American Association of University Women shows that 
a troubling gender gap in computer use exists in high schools. Girls 
make up only a small percentage of students who take high-level computer 
courses that might lead to technology careers. Yet they are more likely 
than boys to take data-entry classes, the high-tech equivalent of 
typing. The report also found that girls tend to use computers in 
limited ways, such as for word processing, while boys are more likely 
to use computers to solve problems or to develop their own programs. 
In one study, girls consistently rated themselves as less competent 
in computers than boys. This suggests that many girls are starting 
to see the high-tech world as a masculine domain. Some of the gender 
gap is created outside the classroom. Computer toys are more heavily 
marketed to boys, and most computer games and even educational software 
have more male characters than female characters. But teachers sensitive 
to these issues could help turn the situation around. In 1992, the 
association raised the nation's awareness of a gender gap in enrollment 
in math and science courses in high school. In less than a decade, 
that gap has been narrowed because educators worked to increase girls' 
participation. Now educators must insure that girls are not inadvertently 
left out of the computer revolution.
