Low interest rates have helped fuel a boom in the housing market this 
year. John metaxas offers some advice on how to best play the mortgage 
game. Volatility in the mortgage market can be very costly if your 
timing is bad. Consider this -- on Tuesday, October 6th, the average 
30-year mortgage rate reached a low of 6.58%. but within five business 
days, it had bounced up more than half a point to 7.1%. on a $150,000 
loan, that change would have cost you $52 a month, or more than $18,000 
over 30 years. Borrowers can protect themselves from interest rate 
moves like this by locking in their mortgage rate before closing. 
You can lock in anytime you apply for a mortgage or anytime after 
that point, up until three to five days before you close, depending 
on the lending institution that you're applying with. Most lenders 
will let you choose when to lock in your rate, but the length of time 
they will guarantee the rate varies. Most of the lenders lock in for 
a 60-day time frame at no expense to the client. If you're going beyond 
a 60-day time frame -- if you're looking at 90 days, if you're looking 
at 120 days -- most of the lenders want a fee. Other lenders offer 
what is known as a "float down" -- if you lock in and rates move up, 
your rate will not increase. But if rates move down, you'll get a 
slightly lower rate. It may not be the absolute best rate. It may 
be, if rates fall by 0.5%, you end up with either one-eighth or one-quarter 
percent. Of course, locking in can deprive you of the full benefit 
if rates decline. But mortgage brokers say, if you find a rate that 
makes financial sense, grab it. No one can accurately predict where 
rates are going. That's "your money." John metaxas, "CNN Financial 
News," New York.
