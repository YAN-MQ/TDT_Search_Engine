Voters in Macedonia cast ballots Sunday in the first round of parliamentary 
elections, choosing between the incumbent politicians who led the 
country peacefully to independence from Yugoslavia or a team of younger 
politicians. All 38 parties, including the ruling coalition of former 
Communists, social democrats and ethnic Albanians that has been in 
power since 1992, have concentrated their campaigns on Macedonia's 
economic woes. Macedonia, which was the poorest of all six republics 
in the former Yugoslav federation, remains economically feeble with 
about 30 percent unemployment and an average salary of dlrs 210 a 
month. Only minor irregularities were reported at the polls by Sunday 
afternoon. Polls closed at 7 p.m., and the first official results 
were expected Monday. The multitude of parties contesting the third 
parliamentary elections since Macedonia abandoned Communist single-party 
rule in 1990 could mean that none will win an outright majority in 
the 120-seat assembly. The ruling coalition currently holds a comfortable 
majority. Under a complicated voting system, only about one-third 
of the 120 seats are up for grabs in Sunday's voting. The rest will 
be determined in a second round of voting on Nov. 1. Situated near 
the volatile Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Macedonia has disputes with 
all of its neighbors, and a restive ethnic Albanian minority. However, 
the country has avoided the violence that has engulfed much of the 
former Yugoslavia. Upon casting his ballot Sunday, the prime minister 
said he hoped the future government ``will be able to preserve peace 
and stability.'' The leading opposition parties would form a coalition 
that promises an economic program it says would attract dlrs 1 billion 
of foreign investment. Opposition leader Vasil Tupurkovski, who drafted 
the program, cast his ballot at one minute before noon to symbolize 
that time is running out to lead the country from its economic crisis.
