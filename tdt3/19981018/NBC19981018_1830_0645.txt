A court case which will echo into the new millennium begins tomorrow 
in washington. Microsoft, the computer software giant, is accused 
of violating federal antitrust laws. NBC's Mike Boettcher examines 
the issues. Bill Gates won't be in court himself tomorrow, but in 
recent days he's been traveling the country conducting a vigorous 
defense, contending that his company broke no federal antitrust laws. 
Are we allowed to put that kind of feature into the operating system? 
We're very confident that that kind of innovation is a great thing. 
The suit alleges Microsoft strong arms computer manufacturers to install 
its popular windows software, giving consumers little choice but to 
use other Microsoft products, such as its Internet browser. The government 
will allege, for example, that a Microsoft executive threatened to 
"cut off" a rival companies air supply. "Everything they're selling, 
we're going to give away for free." The government quotes the executive 
as saying. Last March Microsoft competitors testified before Congress 
about what they see as predatory practices. They have been so successful 
beyond their wildest dreams that they have now created an absolute 
choke point on the way people can get products to customers which 
eliminates choice. But Microsoft rejects the government's case, calling 
itself an innovator, not an eliminator of competition. This case is 
all about the right of Microsoft and other companies in this industry 
to listen to customers, make modifications in their product that they 
believe are in the -- for the good of their customer and see what 
happens in the marketplace. The Microsoft case is the biggest antitrust 
suit since the government took on the communications behemoth AT&T 
in 1974, leading to the breakup of the telephone monopoly. Legal experts 
say this case is equally significant. Because it's so central to such 
a critical industry in such a crucial part of our economy. And no 
matter how this trial ends, this case, which will help shape the rules 
for high-tech commerce in the future, will almost certainly go all 
the way to the Supreme Court. Mike Boettcher, NBC news, Los Angeles.
