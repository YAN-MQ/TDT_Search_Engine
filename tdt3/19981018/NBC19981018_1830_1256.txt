Over two weeks now from election day and this year, the major parties 
and their candidates are wooing a voting block that has been neglected. 
Here's NBC's Dan Lothian. In the past, heber Reyes never cared about 
politics and polls today he's a voter and volunteer, joining the wave 
of a growing Latino political force. I don't know if you've heard 
the cliche, "the giant has awakened." Both democrats and republicans 
are fighting for that "giant's" attention, like never before. Ten 
years ago, you're like pulling teeth to try and get them to even develop 
literature bilingually to the Latino voter. Today, not only literature 
but television ads in Spanish. California's hot gubernatorial race 
has gone into the barrios. Republican Dan Lungren, breaking away from 
the past. No statewide republican candidate has purchased Spanish 
language TV before. Courting the Latino vote is a calculated political 
move. For both parties it's probably going to be the deciding factor 
who determines the next governor of California, the U.S. senator and 
at minimum, a handful of legislative contests. Almost 4.5 million 
Latinos nationwide are expected to vote. Their turnout encouraged, 
phone call by phone call. Some experts like Antonio gonazalez, say 
a growing population, which could make Latinos the largest minority 
group in America in the next seven years, has been forced to organize 
politically by what's perceived as unfair laws. Big issues that directly 
negatively impact their lives, therefore they're motivated to Register 
and vote. In past elections, some of those issues helped candidates. 
California's republican governor Pete Wilson tapped into an anti-immigrant 
sentiment and won four years ago. How are you, sir? But in the race 
for Texas governor this year, there's focus on issues Latino's support. 
And in El Paso, Texas -- I want to join governor bush in thanking 
the folks in El Paso -- This heavily Latino area hosted the gubernatorial 
debate for a First time. Getting the Latino vote has become a national 
priority. We're not going to get every Hispanic vote, obviously, but 
I tell you, the core of our issue package is one that they identify 
with. Heber Reyes says he isn't pushing either party, just flexing 
his new found political muscle, urging other Latino's to exercise 
their right. Dan Lothian, NBC news, Los Angeles.
