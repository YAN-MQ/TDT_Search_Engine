If there is still any doubt about the central and profound place in 
U.S. history of the black Africans who were carried here as slaves, 
it should be laid to rest by ``Africans in America.'' Subtitled ``America's 
Journey Through Slavery,'' the forceful four-part series that begins 
Monday on PBS combines recent scholarship with famous slave narratives 
to explore the resounding clash between the young nation's ideals 
of freedom and the realities of bondage. The story begins with the 
birth of colonial America, the settlement of Jamestown, Va., with 
its promise of a city on a hill, in 1607. Soon the English settlers 
were joined by a cargo of Africans, who had been purchased as servants. 
For a brief moment it may have seemed that black and white workers 
would exist side by side, but by the middle of the century, for tens 
of thousands of Africans transported to the Americas, a racially segregated 
slave society had become entrenched. ``The freedom of some,'' one 
of Monday night's scholars observes, ``is going to depend on the bondage 
of others.'' Vividly treated here is the power of money in creating 
and supporting the ``peculiar institution'' that took hold on tobacco 
and cotton plantations and on the rice-growing Carolina coast, bending 
American ideals to benefit a white hierarchy. For the millions of 
people kidnapped from their homes on the west coast of Africa, that 
meant the cruelties of the slave trade and attendant miseries. It 
is a complex story: of race, class and religion; of the principles 
of the Declaration of Independence in a clash with the laws of property 
and the pursuit of profit; of the changing meaning of democracy and 
liberty as development of what the narrator calls ``a new people in 
a new place.'' This thoughtful, often moving documentary chronicles 
the experiences of fugitive slaves that turned much of the nation 
against slavery; the abiding courage of the abolitionists; the battles 
between slaveholders and Free-Soil forces in ``bleeding Kansas''; 
the Dred Scott decision and John Brown's quixotic insurrection at 
Harpers Ferry; and the Civil War and Emancipation, which settled much 
but left so much unsettled. Scholars continue to differ on matters 
like the profitability of slave labor (by 1830, we learn on Monday 
evening, slaves were worth more than $1 billion to their owners), 
on interracial feelings North and South, on the impact of slave revolts 
and other issues. But history has settled the disputes over the inherent 
viciousness of a system bred in violence and sustained by force. As 
for the fateful divisions planted in the original colonies that left 
America with so tangled and troubling a legacy, they continue to resonate 
through ``Africans in America.'' PRODUCTION NOTES: `AFRICANS IN AMERICA: 
AMERICA'S JOURNEY THROUGH SLAVERY' 9 p.m. Monday on channel 13. Written 
by Steve Fayer; Orlando Bagwell, executive producer; Susan Bellows,
