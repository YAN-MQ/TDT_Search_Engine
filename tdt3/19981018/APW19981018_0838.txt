Thieves sabotaging an oil pipeline touched off an inferno that razed 
several villages and destroyed a swath of surrounding cropland, witnesses 
and officials said Sunday. At least 200 people were reportedly burned 
alive. Although an official death toll was not immediately available, 
military commander Walter Feghabo ordered a mass burial for farmers 
and villagers whose bodies were charred beyond recognition in the 
blaze that began late Saturday near the town of Jesse in the southeastern 
Delta State. ``I just cannot believe this,'' Feghabo said later in 
a telephone interview, after surveying a pile of corpses. Journalists 
and witnesses on the scene estimated that at least 200 people were 
killed and said the death toll was likely to climb as the search for 
survivors continued. Many of the victims were farmers and villagers 
sleeping in their homes. Among the dead were vandals _ including children 
_ whose corpses had been found still clutching plastic cups funnels 
and jerry cans intended to collect fuel from the pipeline. Feghabo 
said more than 120 firefighters were battling late Sunday to contain 
the flames which continued to burn in Jesse, about 300 kilometers 
(180 miles) southeast of Lagos, and the nearby villages of Mossogar 
and Oghara. The above-ground pipeline, linking an oil refinery in 
the southeastern coastal city of Warri about 350 kilometers (210 miles) 
southeast of the commercial capital of Lagos with the northern city 
of Kaduna some 600 kilometers (380 miles) away, exploded when thieves 
sabotaged the line hoping to siphon the oil in makeshift containers, 
an official for Nigeria's state petroleum corporation said on condition 
of anonymity. The official said authorities believed the vandals' 
tools used to break the pipe open had caused a spark, setting the 
pipeline alight. Witnesses said they heard a load roar and saw the 
oily flames spread quickly as the slicks spread. Another government 
petroleum official, Emmanuel Akhihiero, expressed shock after arriving 
on the scene. ``I feel terrible. I cannot believe what I have seen. 
Corpses, corpses,'' Akhihiero said in a telephone interview. Vandals 
and protesters often sabotage petroleum pipelines in Nigeria both 
as a way of protesting for greater financial assistance from the government 
and multinational oil companies and to collect the valuable fuel. 
Despite Nigeria's massive oil wealth, years of government misrule 
and corruption have resulted in almost perpetual fuel shortages that 
result in skyrocketing black-market prices and long line-ups by consumers 
at the gas pumps.
