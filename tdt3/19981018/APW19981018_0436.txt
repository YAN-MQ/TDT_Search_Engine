HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ AIDS may cut life expectancy of Zimbabweans 
to only 30 years over the next decade, a newspaper reported Sunday, 
citing a new report from the United States. The independent Sunday 
Standard newspaper said the U.S. Census Bureau, in a new report, said 
AIDS brought life expectancy down from 60 to between 40 and 50 years 
in the past decade. According to current trends, ``life expectancy 
for babies born in 2010 could be as low as 30 years,'' the report 
said, according to the newspaper. On Sunday, Census Bureau offices 
in Washington were closed and no one was immediately available to 
comment on the newspaper report or provide details. Up to 25 percent 
of urban blacks in Zimbabwe are estimated to be infected with the 
virus that causes AIDS, for which there is no known cure. According 
to the independent AIDS Counseling Trust, about 1.2 million Zimbabweans 
_ 10 percent of the overall population _ are carriers of the AIDS 
virus. Health officials say at least 800 Zimbabweans are dying of 
AIDS each week. The figure could be far higher as many deaths are 
not reported as AIDS-related.
