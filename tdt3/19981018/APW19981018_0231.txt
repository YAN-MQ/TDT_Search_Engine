JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton aims to put pressure 
on Israel by threatening to recognize a Palestinian state this spring 
if the two sides don't reach an agreement at the Mideast summit outside 
Washington, Israel's army radio reported Sunday. The report, citing 
an unidentified American official, said Clinton would use the tactic 
to try to propel Israel to accept a long-sought after deal with the 
Palestinians, under which Israel would withdraw from 13 percent of 
the West Bank in exchange for security guarantees. Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat has said he would declare a Palestinian state unilaterally 
in May 1998, when the interim peace talks between the sides are set 
to expire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened unspecified 
unilateral steps in response that could include annexing chunks of 
the West Bank. Talks at the Maryland retreat of Wye Plantation, in 
their third day, were moving into high gear Sunday with the arrival 
of Israel's Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak 
Mordechai. Upon their arrival, Netanyahu was to convene a special 
session of his inner security cabinet on the grounds of the retreat, 
Israel radio reported. Israel radio also reported that an announcement 
would be made Sunday night by the Americans on whether an agreement 
has been reached or if the summit will be extended until one has been 
struck. Although a press blackout remains in effect on the summit, 
details about the talks continued to leak out. Several Israeli press 
reports painted a picture of a frustrated Clinton who told both sides 
categorically that he intended to push an agreement through. ``I've 
been working on this deal for 17 months and I'm not prepared to defer 
it any longer,'' Clinton was quoted by the Israeli daily Maariv as 
having told both Netanyahu and Arafat. Wide gaps still remain on security 
issues, Israeli media have reported. The CIA has been helping broker 
talks between the sides on security issues, Maariv said. In the Gaza 
Strip, meanwhile, some 300 relatives of Palestinian prisoners being 
held by Israel held a protest Sunday, chanting slogans and holding 
up pictures of imprisoned family members. They demanded that the release 
of Palestinian prisoners be put on the summit agenda.
