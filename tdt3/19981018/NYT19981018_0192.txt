It all looked so familiar at Giants Stadium on Sunday _ eight Giants 
sacks, three long Giants scoring drives, 141 yards rushing, no turnovers 
and three turnovers forced. Surely, Giants fans recognized this team. 
But what were the efficient, prosperous New York Giants of last year 
doing interrupting the budding misadventure of this year's team? Who 
were these guys? And why did it take them six games to come out of 
hiding? The Giants' 34-7 rout of the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday afternoon 
saved the Giants from an undignified early season collapse. In victory, 
the Giants (3-4) turned back the clock, and not a minute too soon, 
because now they have a future again. Now they trail the first-place 
Dallas Cowboys by just one game in the National Football Conference 
East. ``I don't know what got us back in sync and I'm not going to 
analyze it,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said in the wake of his team's 
first victory this month. As Fassel spoke, he looked more relieved 
than happy, the dazed look that has graced his face for three weeks 
having taken its leave. ``Maybe it's a six-game syndrome,'' he said. 
``It took us that long to really get things going last year. I want 
to believe we've found the formula again this time.'' The formula 
was on display from the first play of the game when Giants defensive 
end Michael Strahan sacked Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer. For most 
of the succeeding three hours, the Giants looked better than they 
had in any game this year. Running back Gary Brown, mysteriously underused 
in the preseason, gained 108 yards on 24 carries. Quarterback Danny 
Kanell threw for a career-high 259 yards and three touchdowns. The 
maligned offensive line dominated the Cardinals' vaunted defensive 
front, a brilliant performance by this faceless unit. The patchwork, 
injury-plagued secondary made two interceptions. The nickel linebacker 
Scott Galyon had a sack, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery _ on 
one play. And the Giants offense's best friend from a year ago _ defensive 
pass interference _ returned Sunday. The Cardinals (3-4) were whistled 
for pass interference three times in the first half, which helped 
the Giants take a 14-0 lead. It was the first time the Giants had 
even a touchdown lead in 10 quarters. ``This was a game about which 
team gets its confidence first,'' Strahan said. ``We jumped on them 
early. We played boldly right from the beginning.'' Several Giants 
credited Fassel with instilling that aggressiveness in the team. Fassel 
had addressed his players Saturday night, telling them to ``have fun 
in the game.'' As football speeches go, it was uncommon. There was 
less of the usual talk about execution and more talk about how the 
Giants should enjoy themselves and be thankful they play a game for 
a living. ``I told them that we're the envy of everybody,'' Fassel 
said. ``People love what we do. They'd love to be professional football 
players or coaches. We have no reason to walk around with our chins 
down.'' Offensive tackle Scott Gragg said: ``I think what the coach 
said took the knot out of our stomachs. When you lose, you carry that 
knot in your stomach around with you and it gets hard to relax and 
play. But he made us realize that what we do is a dream for most people. 
We took advantage of the opportunity when we could.'' With a true 
commitment to establishing the running game, the Giants averaged 3.8 
yards on 37 carries _ and Brown averaged 4.5 yards on his 24 carries. 
The Giants had been averaging 3.1 yards a carry, down from 3.8 yards 
a carry last season. ``We did better on the ground because the offensive 
line came off the ball first,'' Fassel said. ``It's about our mental 
edge in the game.'' The Giants got an early, first-quarter psychological 
boost when they faced a fourth-and-1 at the goal line. Fassel decided 
to go for it, calling a play that had fullback Charles Way lined up 
at the end of the offensive line, almost as a third tight end. Before 
the Cardinals had set their defense, Kanell snapped the ball, and 
then quickly fired a touchdown pass to Way. Brown ended the Giants' 
next possession with a 1-yard touchdown _ the second consecutive 11-play 
Giants scoring drive. The Giants' defense, still the strength of the 
team, continued to control the Cardinals' offense, with the defensive 
front four of Strahan, Chad Bratzke, Keith Hamilton and Robert Harris 
playing its best game of the season. Harris was back after missing 
three games with a chest-muscle strain and led the team in tackles 
with nine and sacks with 2{. Hamilton seemed energized by Harris' 
presence, playing his strongest game of the year. Kanell staked the 
Giants to a 17-7 lead and the Giants' pressure on Plummer yielded 
an interception by Percy Ellsworth. That led to Brad Daluiso's 34-yard 
field goal. The decisive, 80-yard drive came a few minutes later when 
the Giants mixed running and passing plays as they marched to the 
Cardinals' 19-yard line. The Cardinals had been blitzing Kanell frequently, 
and on third-and-2, they sent a host of players at Kanell again. The 
Giants quarterback, who had played two successive poor games, threw 
quickly to Chris Calloway over the middle. Calloway spun away from 
one defender and split three others in a dash into the end zone. Kanell 
added a third touchdown pass _ this one to the ever-improving Amani 
Toomer. ``I feel like a weight has been lifted off the offense's shoulders,'' 
Kanell said. ``I was miserable. I was struggling and playing poorly. 
The schedule is only going to get tougher, so we definitely needed 
to give ourselves something to get our momentum going.'' What the 
Giants did was give themselves a history lesson in themselves. As 
Calloway, with a slightly quizzical expression, said Sunday, ``You 
know, it looked a lot like last year out there.''
