A partial West Bank agreement is likely to emerge from the Mideast 
summit talks President Bill Clinton is hosting, but completion of 
a full accord would probably take several weeks, diplomatic sources 
said Sunday. The U.S. administration appealed to the two sides to 
find the ``political will'' to settle issues that have generated 19 
months of stalemate and extended the talks past Sunday's projected 
windup. ``It is in the best interest of the peace process and the 
discussions we have been having,'' State Department spokesman James 
P. Rubin said in announcing that the Israeli and Palestinian delegations 
would remain overnight at the secluded summit retreat and that there 
``almost certainly'' would be talks on Monday. On the fourth day of 
talks, Clinton and Vice President Al Gore flew to the Wye Plantations 
hideaway to work with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to break the impasse. ``There's important 
work being done here,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters 
after Clinton and Gore arrived on separate helicopters. Lockhart said 
Gore was included because he has good relations with leaders of both 
sides. The United States is trying to broker an agreement in which 
Israel would exchange territory for tougher action by the Palestinian 
Authority to prevent terror strikes against Israelis. Diplomatic sources 
said completing a final deal could take weeks or longer. The negotiations 
were snagged Sunday over security guarantees that Israel can expect 
in exchange for giving up West Bank land to the Palestinian Authority, 
diplomatic sources said. Clinton conferred with Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright and other senior advisers for 40 minutes, then 
had lunch with Arafat. The Palestinian leader and Netanyahu have not 
met face-to-face for two days, and there has been no three-way meeting. 
``There is time to complete the work if the political will is there 
to make the tough decisions,'' Rubin said. While diplomatic sources 
said the likely result of the summit was a partial agreement, Rubin 
said ``we have no plan to defer issues for many weeks.'' He also cautioned 
that without an accord ``there are serious dangers ahead for the people 
of the Middle East,'' Palestinian sources told The Associated Press 
the talks ``have become very difficult,'' particularly on whether 
another Israeli pullback on the West Bank would follow the one being 
negotiated and on Israel's demand that terrorism suspects be extradited 
to Israel for trial. However, the sources, insisting on anonymity, 
said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, U.S. mediator Dennis Ross 
and Danny Naveh, the Israeli Cabinet secretary, were working on drafts 
of other provisions. Also, the sources said, CIA director George Tenet 
had a long meeting Saturday with Muhammed Dahlan, Palestinian security 
chief, and their ideas would be presented Sunday to the Israelis.
