President Clinton heads west this week as the midterm election campaign 
moves into high gear. The president begins a two-day trip to California 
Tuesday to raise cash for democratic candidates, including senator 
Barbara boxer, whose re-election battle against republican Matt fong 
is one of this year's most closely watched races. Mr. Clinton's appearances 
will be invitation-only, with no open rallies planned. In recent weeks, 
chants for impeachment have become regular features outside presidential 
venues.
