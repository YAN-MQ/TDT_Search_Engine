Carlos Ferrer Salat, chairman of the Spanish Olympic Committee, died 
Sunday of a heart attack at the age of 69. Ferrer died at home in 
his native Barcelona, his daughter Beatriz Ferrer told Spanish radio. 
Ferrer had also been a member of the International Olympic Committee 
since 1985. He had directed the Spanish Olympic Committee since 1987 
and played a key role in organizing the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. 
Barcelona mayor Joan Clos praised Ferrer for getting civic groups 
and businesses involved in the Games, especially a plan under which 
private companies financed training of Spanish athletes. News of his 
death brought condolences from throughout the Spanish sports world, 
from tennis star Arantxa Sanchez Vicario to former national soccer 
coach Javier Clemente. ``This is a great loss because he was a key 
promoter of strengthening amateur sports,'' Clemente told the state 
news agency Efe.
