The NFL on Tuesday voted against the implementation of instant replay 
in the playoffs. The NFL competition committee shot down the proposal, 
7-1. Jerry Jones was the lone favorable vote. Ricky Williams is a 
Texas ranger. The team purchased the heisman winner's contract from 
the Montreal Expos. In a move reminiscent of Williams, Wisconsin running 
back Ron dayne has opted to return for his senior season. The Badger 
needs just 1700 yards to surpass Williams as division 1a's all-time 
leading rusher.
