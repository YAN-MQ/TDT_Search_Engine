A defiant Billy Hunter said he had no intention of calling David Stern 
to restart talks and predicted that there would not be a resolution 
to the National Basketball Association's labor dispute before Christmas. 
While Hunter, executive director of the players union, said both parties 
could come to an agreement after a few days of intense negotiations, 
he was agitated at times, using a conference call with the news media 
Wednesday to put the onus for closing a deal and salvaging the season 
on league officials. ``We're going to find ourselves locked into the 
12th-hour scenario,'' Hunter said. ``At this stage, it's almost like 
poker. What they're trying to do is see who blinks first. Unless they're 
prepared to compromise, there's not going to be a season and this 
thing is just going to go up in smoke.'' Where are the talks going 
on the 169th day of the lockout? Home for the holidays. Stern, the 
NBA commissioner, is planning to leave for a weeklong trip to his 
Colorado vacation home this weekend, and Hunter said he would return 
home to Oakland, Calif. Both principal negotiators said they could 
quickly return to New York if needed. Still, with neither side in 
a rush to negotiate, it appears that Jan. 1 is not a hard deadline 
for an impending settlement. Hunter even spoke of the season beginning 
Feb. 1, a date that would allow teams a 40- to 50-game season. ``Of 
course it concerns me,'' Hunter said, when asked if he was worried 
about not reaching an accord before Christmas. ``Am I overly concerned? 
Obviously, I'm not. I look at David, and I figure David will be the 
one to decide when and if we get a deal. When he's ready, he'll negotiate. 
Obviously, his time line is not affected by the week before Christmas 
now that he's going to Aspen, Colo.'' That was just one of several 
shots Hunter lobbed Stern's way Wednesday. Indicative of how pride 
has filtered into the negotiations, Hunter also seems to be fed up 
with initiating conversations to bring the sides back to the table. 
``The problem with initial contact, it gives the impression we're 
weakened,'' he said. ``I know on several occasions they haven't called 
because it's an issue of a pride, and that goes before the fall. Maybe 
this time, I need to stay where I am and see if they want to talk 
to me.'' Stern disputed that Hunter is always the one to make first 
contact. ``Contrary to Hunter's assertions, last week's meetings were 
convened at my initiative alone,'' Stern said in a written statement. 
``I called him on Tuesday, met privately with him that evening and 
outlined to him the compromises the NBA was prepared to make in order 
to achieve a deal. ``The meetings that followed on Thursday and Saturday 
were thus the result of my initiative and were without precondition. 
Hunter's position at the Saturday meeting was that the union was prepared 
to accept the NBA's concessions but was unprepared to make any significant 
ones of its own. ``As we told the union's representatives, we remain 
willing to negotiate at any time and at any location if it will be 
productive.'' The most ominous stumbling blocks to a deal remain how 
large a percentage of revenues will be devoted to salaries, and whether 
there will be an absolute maximum salary for players with more than 
seven years' experience. On many other issues, the sides are gaining 
ground. ``There will be no piecemeal negotiations,'' Hunter said. 
``We're not going to sit around and concede. We always concede to 
the demands of the NBA, and we're no longer going to engage in that.'' 
Hunter also addressed the issue of race in the negotiations, a subject 
that has been openly discussed in articles in Newsweek magazine and 
The New York Times this past week. ``The problem is, you've got a 
group of extremely successful businessmen who own teams,'' he said. 
``Most of them are billionaires. You've got men accustomed to seeing 
their dictates honored. When they make a demand, it's customary that 
most people respond to it. ``On the other side of the table, you've 
got a group of players who are predominantly African-American in origin. 
People can read into it anything they want. But I think it's all about 
dollars. It's about hard economics. People tend to read different 
things. If things don't go right or tempers flare, the first reaction 
is, it's got to be racial. I think we have to put that aside and get 
a deal.'' Finally, Hunter also warned of the grave consequences of 
a lost season, including the formation of a rival league. He spoke 
of ``other individuals who would step up and try to fill the void, 
create another league, a competing league.'' He added: ``The NBA would 
take a hit and never recover. If there's a mass exodus, I think the 
NBA would be decimated. It's ludicrous for us to not try and reach 
an accord.''
