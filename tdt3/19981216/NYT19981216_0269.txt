In the title story of Ethan Coen's often funny, sometimes disturbing 
collection, ``Gates of Eden,'' the protagonist, Joe Gendreau, seems 
to have entered paradise of a sort. A weights and measures inspector 
for the State of California whose job it is to see that gas pumps 
are correctly calibrated and that Happy Burger's Seven-Ounce Bun-Buster 
does in fact weigh 7 ounces, Joe gets a complaint from a Miss O'Hara, 
who leaves her Brentwood address in the message. When Joe shows up 
at the house, he is greeted by an attractive Japanese woman in native 
dress whose name turns out to be Ohara. She asks Joe in (``Come in 
a talk''), plies him with food and saki (``Fussa we eat'') and invites 
him out to her garden for a swim and some lovemaking. Joe reflects: 
``We could be man and woman, in the garden, without words, without 
shame. We could abide in beauty and be one.'' But later Joe wakes 
up hung over and covered with bee stings and finds that he has been 
victimized by a blackmail scheme. The garden turns out to be hell, 
costing him his job. Such wacky extremes pervade Coen's 14 stories, 
just as they do the films he makes with his brother, Joel, among the 
better of which are ``Blood Simple,'' ``Miller's Crossing,'' ``The 
Great Lebowski'' and the superlative ``Fargo,'' which won the Academy 
Award in 1997 for best original screenplay. At one end in the stories 
is the violence so familiar in the films. In ``Fever in the Blood,'' 
a private eye, Victor Strang, has one of his ears bitten off in an 
encounter with a thug. In ``Red Wing,'' a husband details how his 
wife drove him to decapitate her. In ``Have You Ever Been in Electric 
Ladyland,'' a slick-talking record company executive describes all 
the people he knows who had motives to break into his house and mutilate 
his dog. Some of these stories are chillingly grim. Others are pushed 
to outrageous parody. In ``Cosa Minapolidan,'' a minor mafioso sets 
up shop in Minneapolis, thinking the name of the city is Chippewa 
for ``New Naples.'' (``He missed his native Napoli.'') But he fails 
to catch the attention of the citizens, whose ``stolid Northern stock 
seemed immune to the great miseries and grand passions upon which 
crime traditionally feeds.'' In ``Johnnie Ga-Botz,'' a rub-out goes 
awry when the mindless assassin calls his boss for further instructions 
on a wiretapped phone. At the other extreme are several sensitive 
stories about growing up Jewish in the Minneapolis area, where the 
author is from. These tend to be more detailed and atmospheric, and 
although well written and effective, they lack the manic punch of 
the crime stories and parodies. Because of their relative artlessness, 
one can't help suspecting them of being at least grounded in autobiography. 
Which prompts a question raised also by the films: Why the Coens' 
fascination with violence? Or to put it more cliched terms: How come 
a couple of nice Jewish boys are so obsessed with organized crime? 
Several of the stories in the collection offer clues. In ``The Old 
Country,'' the narrator describes how a classmate created anarchy 
at Hebrew school with his irreverent behavior until he was sent home 
for punishment by his parents. The story doesn't spell out what was 
done to tame the rebel so effectively. But the narrator describes 
the fear his classmate's change inspired in him, and he associates 
it with the void of Genesis. The story ends: ``Some forget that darkness, 
and the silence, and the chaos inside. But despite what Scripture 
says, it will never be banished, for without it there would be no 
horror, no misery, and no childhood.'' In the collection's opening 
story, ``Destiny,'' the narrator, Joe Carmody, begins by describing 
a terrible beating he takes in a boxing match. Still eager to make 
it in the world of violence, he accepts the job of photographing a 
mobster's unfaithful wife in the act. Failing at this and facing a 
beating by the wife's lover, Joe explains why he should be exempt: 
when he graduated from college, he hoped to make it in a different 
world from the one he was headed for. ``I'm not here because of socioeconomic 
pressures, sir,'' he explains. ``So accordingly I'm not really subject 
to the laws of, uh, the socio _ uh, I don't know how to say this, 
sir. I'm _ I'm on a safari. This is a safari, sir. I'm not one of 
the actual, er ... animals, as it were.'' His assailant responds, 
``You speak from a core of confusion.'' He continues: ``You express 
yourself marvelously. However. It does not hide your inner core. Which 
is confusion.'' And so Joe will be beaten, he says, ``which is my 
last word.'' The void is dangerous, and exploring it can get you hurt. 
In ``I Killed Phil Shapiro,'' the narrator ends his memoir of a childhood 
in Minneapolis with a dream of meeting his father in the desert: ``A 
figure staggers toward me, arms limply dangling, linked footprints 
stretching back across the dunes. His white shirt glares in the noonday 
sun and his glasses are dusted with flour-fine sand. It is Phil _ 
or given the fluid identity which dreams neglect to fix, it may be 
myself. I watch his approach and think about the proud Hebrew with 
dark skin and hook nose who once gazed out upon the many tents of 
his household. What connects me to him? Is the figure I now see the 
rear guard of a parade of ghosts, successive yet simultaneous, each 
generation melting into the next? What was passed down from father 
to son, even to the generation of Phil Shapiro, even unto our own 
day? What mysteries have been preserved, what lost, and what transformed 
in our migrations from Canaan to Eastern Europe to New York City and 
finally this far-flung garden suburb?'' Once upon a time, his ancestors 
could brave the void. But now his people are lost and searching blindly. 
In ``Gates of Eden,'' Coen has sounded the jagged dissonance of the 
American experience. As the descendant of wanderers, he tallies up 
the costs of a journey that has yet to achieve the promised land.
