BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors left Baghdad on Wednesday, 
amid fears that Iraq's latest refusal to cooperate with inspectors 
could lead to airstrikes. Washington and London have said military 
strikes remain an option to force Iraq's compliance. British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair discussed the crisis with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton in a 15-minute phone call late Tuesday, a spokesman for Blair 
in London said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. ``This 
is obviously a very serious situation. All options are on the table,'' 
one White House national security aide said Wednesday, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed 
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler's report on Iraq's obstruction 
of inspections as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended to trigger 
an American and British military strike on Iraq.'' He said the withdrawal 
of the inspectors ``means again that the Special Commission is a tool 
in America's hand to implement its policy of aggression.'' His remarks 
were carried by the official Iraqi News Agency. British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cook said airstrikes could come quickly and without warning. 
``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to Saddam 
Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp. interview Wednesday 
morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any warning of what we might 
do.'' The United States has 22 warships and 201 aircraft in the region, 
including 72 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. Eight of 
the warships carry cruise missiles. Britain has 22 strike aircraft 
in the region. Weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency arrived in Bahrain Wednesday 
afternoon. ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from 
Baghdad,'' U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain. ``There 
is nobody left behind.'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov accused 
Butler of overstepping his authority by ordering the evacuation of 
inspectors. He called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting, 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported in Moscow. Ivanov was in Madrid on 
Wednesday for a peace conference on Bosnia. Russia has consistently 
opposed military action against Iraq. In Baghdad, a U.N. spokesman 
said no decision had been made on withdrawing the 400 U.N. employees 
monitoring humanitarian programs in Iraq. George Somerwill added, 
however, that they were prepared to leave ``should it become necessary.'' 
Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast Wednesday and 
began playing patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos training 
with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. 
Under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, Iraq had pledged Nov. 
14 to resume full cooperation with inspectors and allow unfettered 
access to sites and documents. In his report to U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan on Tuesday, Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, 
evasion and subterfuge that made it impossible for him to assure that 
Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated. Those 
arms programs must be dismantled before the U.N. Security Council 
can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was imposed 
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Butler said Iraq's claim that 
it does not possess banned weapons or the ability to make them ``cannot 
be accepted without further verification.'' He said inspectors were 
not able to gain access to the headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, 
where they had ``solid evidence of the presence of proscribed materials.'' 
At two other sites, negotiations ultimately cleared the way for inspections, 
he said. But one building had been emptied of relevant materials, 
and the other ``had been prepared to avoid any disclosure of relevant 
materials,'' he said. Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents 
on its weapons programs no longer exist or have been destroyed. ``It 
remains the commission's strong view that, under the present circumstances, 
relevant documentation must exist in Iraq and that provision of such 
documentation is the best hope for revealing the full picture'' of 
Iraqi weapons programs, he said.
