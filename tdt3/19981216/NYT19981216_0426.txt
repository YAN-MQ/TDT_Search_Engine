A new scandal emerged Wednesday in Ireland over assertions of corruption 
and nepotism at the highest level of government, plunging the country 
into a national debate. The debate came after the disclosure of an 
official ruling that former Prime Minister Charles Haughey owed no 
taxes on a $2 million gift from a businessman and that the decision 
was made by a brother-in-law of present Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, 
whose political career was fostered by Haughey. In the Parliament, 
members of the opposition party, Fine Gael, charged the Fianna Fail 
party of Ahern and Haughey of corruption and nepotism. Opposition 
members said that a tribunal stated unequivocally last spring that 
the $2 million was taxable as a gift. ``This is incredible,'' said 
Labor Party leader Ruairi Quinn, a former finance minister leader. 
Another member shouted ``This is corruption!'' as Speaker Seamus Pattison 
tried to gavel the house to order. Ahern, under a fusillade of hostile 
questioning, denied any involvement in the case, adding: ``He is my 
brother-in-law, but I had no knowledge about this until I read about 
it in this morning's newspapers.'' Opposition members said Ronan Kelly, 
the tax official who made the no-tax ruling, was appointed by Ahern 
when the prime minister was finance minister several years ago. Nora 
Owen, a former justice minister and a member of Fine Gael, the largest 
opposition party, said, ``The public are outraged by what they read 
in the newspapers.'' She called for an investigation of how the decision 
was made and demanded to know whether Ahern would order revenue officials 
to appeal the decision in court. The investigation is an embarrassment 
for Fianna Fail, but it was barely noticed until Wednesday morning. 
Most, but by no means all, of the people interviewed on Irish national 
radio and television in Dublin, Cork and other areas Wednesday said 
Haughey should pay the tax or be sent to prison. Ireland has one of 
the highest rates in Europe, with a maximum tax of 46 percent. Haughey's 
supporters say that as prime minister in the 1980s he cut excessive 
state spending and debt, telling people to tighten their belts. They 
noted that the economy improved steadily under him and that he eliminated 
income taxes for writers and artists and increased the number of old 
people who received free public transportation passes. His opponents 
say it is now clear that he was not tightening his own belt at the 
time. He owns two large estates, a yacht and several thoroughbred 
race horses. Haughey, 73, who was prime minister for nine years, was 
already under investigation for accepting the $2 million from Ben 
Dunne, a former chief executive of the country's largest department 
store. Haughey himself acknowledged that he had taken the $2 million, 
but added that he gave no favors for the money. The former prime minister 
has not been charged with any crime. But the investigation already 
under way is expected to answer the question on many minds: How did 
a man who spent his entire life in politics, at modest salaries, become 
a man of ostensible wealth?
