The State Department warned Russia on Wednesday that expanded cooperation 
with U.S. companies in the lucrative foreign commercial satellite 
field could be jeopardized unless Russian entities cease collaboration 
with Iran's ballistic missile program. Using unusually blunt language, 
spokesman James P. Rubin also said the United States is convinced 
that Iran is using its Bushehr reactor project ``as a cover for acquiring 
sensitive Russian nuclear technology.'' ``We have discussed our concerns 
at the highest levels,'' he said. ``Russia has declined to halt all 
nuclear cooperation with Iran.'' The rare public rebuke suggested 
that private efforts by the administration to halt Russian-Iranian 
cooperation in the nuclear and missile areas have not borne fruit. 
Russia insists the Bushehr project is only for generating electricity 
_ not for providing Iran with technology to build weapons of mass 
destruction. ``We are not interested in anybody acquiring biological, 
nuclear or chemical weapons or missiles for their delivery, and this 
naturally applies to all countries in the Middle East,'' Russian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said last week. Rubin said Russia 
has given the United States commitments that such cooperation will 
be offered only during the period of construction at the Bushehr project, 
located in southern Iran. ``Despite these commitments, we are aware 
that a number of Russian entities are engaged in cooperation with 
Iran that goes beyond the Bushehr reactor project,'' he said. Eighteen 
of Russia's 48 satellite launches last year were for U.S. firms. The 
launches were worth $60 million to $100 million each for the Russian 
Space Agency, which has had trouble paying its bills. U.S. officials 
raised the possibility earlier this year of an increase in such launches. 
But Rubin suggested that possibility may now be in jeopardy. ``The 
U.S. government will not be able to approve expansion of the highly 
lucrative space launch market with Russia until Russian entities cease 
cooperation with Iran's ballistic missile program,'' he said. Iran 
denies U.S. charges that it is trying to develop weapons of mass destruction. 
However, the administration believes that individual Russians may 
be acting without government authorization to assist the Iranians, 
U.S. officials said. Russia has thousands of underpaid scientists 
and the Americans fear they may be tempted to sell their expertise 
to countries like Iran. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions 
of dollars in recent years to keep Russian scientists employed in 
peaceful projects. The Wall Street Journal, reporting in Tuesday's 
editions, said intelligence reports say that officials from at least 
two key Russian nuclear research institutes are quietly negotiating 
to sell Iran a 40-megawatt heavy-water research reactor and a uranium 
conversion facility. While the talks are at an early stage, the reports 
suggest Russian nuclear scientists are already secretly advising Iran 
on how to produce heavy water and nuclear- grade graphite, the newspaper 
said. ``American officials believe the technology and information 
are building blocks for a long range Iranian effort to manufacture 
plutonium or highly enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb,'' it said.
