JERUSALEM (AP) - A Turkish cargo ship sank off Israel on Wednesday 
and was abandoned by its crew. The 1,000 ton freighter Dogruyolar 
had just left the Israeli port of Haifa with a cargo of cement and 
was headed south along the coast when its engine room began to fill 
up with water, said Haifa port spokesman Yossi Rosenthal. After the 
ship sent out a distress signal, the nine crew members were rescued 
by Israeli coast guard and naval vessels, said Hakan Abaci, an official 
at the Turkish Embassy in Tel Aviv. The cause of the massive leak 
was not immediately known.
