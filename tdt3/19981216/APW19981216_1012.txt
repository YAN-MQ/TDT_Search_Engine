American forward Eric Wynalda is getting a tryout with Charlton Athletic. 
The 29-year-old veteran of three World Cups is training with the south 
London club, which is going through a goalscoring drought and is sliding 
close to the Premier League's relegation zone. Charlton was promoted 
to the top flight last season after seven seasons in the lower divisions. 
Wynalda, who also has played in the German Bundesliga, spent last 
season with the San Jose Clash of Major League Soccer. He has scored 
32 goals in 102 appearances for the United States and played against 
Germany and Yugoslavia at the World Cup in France. If the striker 
impresses Charlton manager Alan Curbishley in training, the club may 
offer him a contract and apply for a work permit which is needed for 
him to play in England. Two Americans currently play for Premier League 
teams _ goalkeepers Kasey Keller (Leicester) and Brad Friedel (Liverpool). 
Charlton has lost four games in a row and tumbled to fifth from last 
in the standings. Leading striker Clive Mendonca has scored just once 
in the last 11 games _ and that was from the penalty spot. Strike 
partner Andy Hunt has failed to hit the target in his last six Premier 
League games.
