Democratic and republican leaders in the house say they will postpone 
debate and a vote on impeaching President Clinton until Monday. Bob 
Livingston made the announcement this afternoon. We are going to ask 
that all members, republican and democrat, remain available to the 
call of the chair for further action -- possibly Friday, possibly 
Saturday, but within the near future. We are going to look with anticipation 
and interest at the events in the mideast, and we are reserving out 
right to move forward with the other action. We are not anticipating 
undertaking that action tomorrow.
