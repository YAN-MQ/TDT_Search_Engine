``We interrupt this impeachment to bring you the bombing of Iraq ...'' 
What to think? An international crisis in the nick of time? The latest 
development in a yearlong series of cynical and irresponsible acts 
by government officials? A president and a Congress locked in a domestic 
war that has flamed dangerously out of control? Stay tuned. The impeachment-eve 
attack on military and security targets in Iraq had the dramatic impact 
usually reserved for the cheapest of melodramas, which is exactly 
what we have been living through. The sudden launching of deadly cruise 
missiles by a previously unwarlike president was guaranteed to fuel 
the suspicions and the anger of Republicans in Congress who were all 
set to wrap the cloak of historical ignominy around William Jefferson 
Clinton. The attack was followed immediately by accusations that Clinton, 
as slippery as ever, had wagged the dog in a last-ditch effort to 
escape impeachment for having lied about having sex with ``that woman.'' 
``Never underestimate a desperate president,'' said Rep. Gerald Solomon, 
a Republican from upstate New York. What to think? A president who 
evaded the draft as a young man and has avoided the use of force through 
most of his presidency has now launched his second series of attacks 
in recent months. The first came last August when Clinton ordered 
the bombing of targets in Afghanistan and the Sudan in retaliation 
for the bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa. The attacks in Afghanistan 
and the Sudan came just three days after Clinton had gone on national 
television to acknowledge that he had had an inappropriate relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky. ``Wag the Dog'' theories were rampant. A disturbing, 
surreal haze covers nearly every development now. Every act and every 
utterance has multiple potential meanings. The right wing of the Republican 
Party clearly is out to destroy Clinton. At the same time, the president 
has lied so often and so easily it is difficult to know when he is 
telling the truth, or if he ever tells the whole truth. I am going 
to hope, whatever the merits of the bombing in Iraq, that the president 
is not lying now. In his address to the nation Wednesday night, Clinton 
stressed that the attack _ and its timing _ had the unanimous support 
of his national security team, which includes the vice president, 
the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff and the national security adviser. If they 
are all wagging the dog, we are in deeper trouble than we can imagine. 
Before the attack was announced, I was writing about the ``almost 
certain'' impeachment of Clinton. I had written, ``The right wing 
of the Republican Party has seized command of the ship of state and 
cannot be dissuaded from ramming it into the iceberg of impeachment.'' 
Clinton's actions have postponed that collision, but only for the 
moment. The country is in a strange and dangerous state. Feelings 
of bitterness and suspicions of bad faith permeate the government. 
Clinton, despite his forceful statement on Iraq, is reeling from self-inflicted 
wounds and his enemies are moving in for the kill. This is happening 
despite the verdict of the public, which has said, loudly, ``Enough.'' 
Most Americans believe Congress should censure the president and move 
on. But Tom DeLay, the House Republican whip and right-wing zealot 
who is leading the crusade to oust Clinton, says Congress has a ``duty'' 
to impeach him. And the so-called Republican ``moderates,'' who might 
have staved off the radical remedy of impeachment, have chosen to 
surrender their independence and are lining up like lackeys to follow 
DeLay's fanatical lead. Bill Clinton has always been his own worst 
enemy. He has always furnished his opponents with generous amounts 
of ammunition to use against him. Now the nation is engaged in a crisis 
at home and a conflict abroad. Bill Clinton had better be telling 
the whole truth about the attack on Iraq. If it turns out he's not, 
the rest of the country will turn away from him and join the Republicans 
in demanding his impeachment, and his ouster from office.
