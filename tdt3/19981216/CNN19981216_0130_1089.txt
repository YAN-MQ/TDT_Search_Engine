Cereal lovers will have to dish out more money for corn flakes, rice 
krispies and other Kellogg products. The nation's largest cerealmaker 
raised prices an average of 2.7%. the price of a box of corn flakes, 
Kellogg's best-selling cereal, rose by 6%. Bite-size frosted mini 
wheats dropped 11%, while its low-fat granola prices jumped 11%. Kellogg 
says this is its first price increase since 1994. The move is intended 
to jump-start Kellogg's profits and finance the company's recent restructuring.
