Seehof, in the Berlin suburb of Teltow, is a quiet neighborhood of 
well-tended homes, bordered by parks, a nature preserve and a waterway. 
Yet the calm belies a storm that has surrounded Seehof since German 
reunification in 1990. The 500 or so houses were built on the Seehof 
farm, once owned by one of Berlin's wealthiest families, the Saberskys. 
They fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s because they were Jewish, ending 
up in the United States and elsewhere. For decades, the family could 
not seek restitution because the land was in communist East Germany. 
Now with the Wall gone and Teltow looking like prime real estate, 
the heirs want to regain title to the 84 hectares (208 acres), worth 
dlrs 170 million or more. The prospect frightens many of the 1,500 
people who have lived in Seehof for decades. With so much at stake, 
the battle has become increasingly bitter, with accusations of anti-Semitism, 
greed and dishonest politics. Although several decisions have gone 
against them, the family is pushing ahead. But their latest appeal 
was rejected Wednesday by the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin. 
In a decision that dealt only with land that now belongs to Teltow 
_ streets and parks _ the court found that the transfer of those parcels 
to the city in 1934 ``did not result by force out of racist grounds.'' 
The judges said they would decide on the bulk of the parcels _ where 
the houses now stand _ in February. ``It's a very sad day,'' said 
one American descendant, Peter Sonnenthal, after the ruling. ``But 
this is only a skirmish.'' In an earlier interview, Sonnenthal, a 
former lawyer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission who 
helped bring down Wall Street titans Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, 
said he's not one to shy from a fight. Sonnethal, 44, conceded he 
stands to make a lot of money but insists he does not intend to force 
anyone from his home. ``We're fighting a decision that says my family 
wasn't persecuted,'' he said. ``But the truth is this property was 
owned by my family and stolen by the Nazis and that's what must be 
addressed.'' The family has won small victories, getting three parcels 
back in 1995, including the grand, three-story villa where Sonnenthal's 
grandfather, Albert Sabersky, once lived. The villa quickly sold for 
dlrs 4.8 million. Sonnenthal and his sister received half as sole 
heirs to Albert Sabersky; the rest was divided among 16 other heirs. 
Still, the state office charged with deciding restitution claims denied 
the bulk of their claim. Deputy director Josefine Ewers says the Saberskys 
``without a question'' were persecuted by the Nazis _ but not when 
it came to selling their farm. Both sides have spent years searching 
through old archives, digging out maps, aerial photos and records. 
The case hinges on whether the land was used as a farm or intended 
for development, whether the Saberskys sold under pressure and what 
happened to the money. The Saberskys, mainly bankers and grain traders, 
bought Seehof in 1878. They maintained it as a farm but drew up plans 
to develop a strip along the water where other wealthy Berliners had 
started building country homes. But when the Nazis came to power in 
1933 and started banning Jews from professions _ including farming 
_ the family hired a Nazi real-estate broker to begin selling all 
of Seehof. ``They knew what was coming,'' Sonnenthal said. ``They 
sold it off as fast as they could.'' The family claims the Saberskys 
sold the farm under pressure for about half the market value, and 
that the broker charged them an exorbitant commission _ reaching 50 
percent after the 1938 anti-Jewish pogrom known as Kristallnacht. 
They also say the Nazis confiscated the proceeds, and the family never 
saw the money. Ewers, of the restitution office, says records show 
the family was not really farming the land but instead was preparing 
it for development with intent to sell. If the family was not farming, 
she argues, it would not have been under pressure from the Nazis' 
banning the profession for Jews. She says the broker's commission 
was reasonable considering all they asked him to do. She also disputes 
Sonnethal's claim that the family never saw any money from its financial 
agent, noting it used the same man in the 1950s. Sonnenthal says Ewers 
and the court acted under political pressure, ignoring his evidence 
to protect homeowners _ and voters. She denies it. Charges that the 
family is only after money reflect shades of anti-Semitism, he says, 
as do the swastikas that appeared in the neighborhood during the seven-year 
court battle. He has offered to drop claims to any home if the occupant 
pays 10,000 to 15,000 marks (dlrs 6,000 to dlrs 9,000) _ about 10 
percent of the market value. ``As a Jew returning to Germany, I will 
not make a victim out of anyone who suffered under communism,'' he 
says. ``We set the price intentionally low.'' About 120 people have 
accepted the offer or are in the process of doing so. The majority 
are holding out _ taking their chances with the courts. Sonnenthal, 
now in private practice in Denver, said the federal court's decision 
that each of the housing parcels will be decided individually in February 
boded well for his family. ``I think we have a very good chance of 
getting those parcels sold after Kristallnacht back,'' he said. That 
would amount to 89 homes. In the meantime, Sonnenthal said he was 
considering whether to appeal Wednesday's ruling to the Constitutional 
Court, Germany's highest.
