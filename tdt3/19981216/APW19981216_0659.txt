A French appeals court on Wednesday upheld the conviction of an author 
for a 1996 book that calls into question whether 6 million Jews died 
in the Holocaust. Roger Garaudy, 85, received a six-month suspended 
prison sentence and was fined 120,000 francs (dlrs 21,400) for contesting 
the Holocaust in ``The Founding Myths of Israeli Politics.'' Garaudy, 
who converted to Islam in 1982, also received a three-month suspended 
sentence and an additional 40,000 franc-fine (dlrs 8,000) for inciting 
racial hatred. In his book, Garaudy questioned the figure of 6 million 
for the number of Jews killed by the Nazis in World War II, saying 
it was much less, and denounced what he called ``Shoah business'' 
_ turning the tragedy into a calculated way of making money and political 
gains. During his trial, he said he was anti-Zionist, but not anti-Semitic. 
Garaudy's publisher, Pierre Guillaume, received a six-month suspended 
sentence and fined 30,000 francs (dlrs 5,400) for contesting the Holocaust.
