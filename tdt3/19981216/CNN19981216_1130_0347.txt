Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says there will be no troop 
withdrawal from the West Bank on Friday. A failure to withdraw more 
troops would violate terms of the wye river interim peace agreement. 
Today, Netanyahu told his cabinet he won't budge on the issue until 
the palestinians meet six more demands in the agreement. He made a 
similar statement to President Clinton during his just-ended trip 
to the Middle East.
