Linda Tripp accuses Monica Lewinsky of threatening her, days before 
Tripp filed an affidavit in the Paula Jones case. In a sworn deposition, 
Tripp says Lewinsky placed on her office chair, a List of people close

considered that a threat because Lewinsky knew she was planning to 
testify about the intern's affair with Mr. Clinton.
