Kids in China are being asked to take it easy on the environment. 
The Beijing environmental protection foundation recently kicked off 
a Campaign to save the nation's dwindling forests. It wants children 
and adults to sacrifice the holiday tradition of sending greeting 
cards, to help preserve trees. Children are taught 4,000 cards equals 
one tree. The group hopes to save 10,000 trees cut down for card production 
every year.
