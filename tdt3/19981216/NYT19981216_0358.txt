Remove Chase Manhattan Corp. from Wall Street's hit list. A flurry 
of disappointing earnings announcements or forecasts from several 
of the country's biggest financial services firms have raised concerns 
about how easily some companies may rebound from this year's financial 
turmoil, but Chase said Wednesday that it expects to soundly beat 
analysts' earnings estimates for the fourth quarter. In fact, Chase 
said, it is within striking distance of posting record profits this 
quarter, notable in a year when the best and brightest of Wall Street 
have been battered by financial upheaval overseas. ``Our competitive 
position has been enhanced by all of the events of the last few months,'' 
said Marc Shapiro, Chase's vice chairman in charge of finance and 
risk management. ``We think we have created a very different institution 
than we've had historically and from what other institutions have 
today.'' Shapiro said that Chase, the country's third largest bank, 
expects to surpass analysts' consensus estimates of $1.07 a share 
in the fourth quarter and thinks the bank may reap record profits 
of more than about $1.21 a share in the quarter, or slightly more 
than $1 billion. ``This is clearly significant because a majority 
of companies have been preannouncing disappointing results and here 
you have a major company saying, `We're going to beat estimates by 
a wide margin,' '' said Charles Hill, research director for the First 
Call Corp., a company that tracks earnings estimates for publicly 
traded firms. In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, 
Chase's shares rose $2.75, or 4.53 percent, to $63.50. Over the last 
week, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., two large 
financial services firms, announced or forecasted disappointing earnings 
as both companies fell victim to the soured trading environment that 
emerged after Russia devalued its currency and declared a debt moratorium 
in August. Analysts have also been revising earnings downward for 
Citigroup and the BankAmerica Corp., while earnings forecasts for 
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. are mixed. Chase, however, has separated itself 
from that pack. Shapiro attributed the performance to several factors, 
among them the bank's emphasis on ``stress testing'' its trading and 
loan portfolios to analyze how well those portfolios would perform 
in unforeseen market downturns. While many financial firms espouse 
devotion to risk management _ claims that were undermined by the market 
swings of the last year _ Chase's performance suggests that the bank 
has actually succeeded. Shapiro also said that Chase's corporate businesses, 
like syndicated lending and investment-grade debt underwriting, and 
consumer businesses, like credit card, mortgages, and auto finance, 
performed well. Of note was Chase's currency trading operation, which 
normally provides about half of the company's overall trading revenue, 
and which Shapiro said did especially well in an uncertain market. 
Chase has a well-known hole in its corporate business _ the absence 
of stock underwriting capabilities _ but this may have been a good 
time to do without it. Financial turmoil ground stock underwriting 
almost to a halt in recent months and large companies looked to loans 
and other forms of debt to raise money, all of which benefited Chase. 
That is not to say Chase has not been pummeled by unforeseen trading 
or lending losses over the last year, particularly in such rocky markets 
as Russia and Indonesia. But the bank said those problems only underscored 
how well-positioned Chase is financially. ``We have less commercial 
credit risk than we had in this institution 10 years ago and more 
than twice the capital,'' said Shapiro. ``That means we are able to 
absorb events like Russia and Indonesia.'' Chase, the creation of 
the 1996 acquisition of the old Chase by Chemical Banking Corp., has 
had difficulty convincing analysts that it could be nimble and highly 
profitable. Analysts said this year's performance should not only 
allay such concerns, but also offer proof that one of the banking 
industry's biggest mergers is now one of the most successful. ``For 
whatever reasons, investors have not been comfortable with Chase,'' 
said David Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc. 
``But it's now clear what kind of power exists in this franchise.''
