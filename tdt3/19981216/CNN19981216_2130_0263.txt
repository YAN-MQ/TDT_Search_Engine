The U.N. security council is holding open meetings on today's air 
strikes against Iraq. Several countries are expected to plead a case 
for the United States and britain to bring an end to the military 
action. Among them, China and Russia. Japan, Germany, and Canada all 
offered support. British prime minister Tony Blair says the use of 
force against Iraq was necessary. Following the Butler report, after 
more than a year of obstruction and broken promises, we have no option 
but to act. Our objectives in this military action are clear. To degrade 
his capability to build and use weapons of mass destruction and diminish 
the military threat he poses to his neighbors.
