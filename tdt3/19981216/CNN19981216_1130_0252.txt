The phones are Ringing off the hook, and there's more E-mail than 
humanly possible to read. People across the country are trying to 
contact congressional offices to influence the house vote on impeachment. 
Bob Cain has that. The quickest way to express yourself on impeachment 
is E-mail. Trouble is, so many people are doing that, that many are 
apparently going unread. Then, there's the phone. You can call the 
local office of your Congress person and hope the message gets passed 
on. You can also reach the U.S. capitol switchboard by calling 202-224-3121. 
Tell the operator the name of your representative, or give your zip 
code and they'll put you through. The afl-cio has a toll-free number 
for union members only, to the capitol switchboard. The organization, 
people for the American way, also will put you through to the capitol 
switchboard. We tried that one. Again, a lot of people have the same 
idea. A person could write a letter and the debate begins Thursday 
and that is cutting it close. Maybe one lobbying group has an idea 
when they suggest people start selling or sending telegrams. Despite 
the volume of incoming messages, most members of Congress say they're 
trying to keep tabs on the numbers, pro and Con. How much difference 
it'll make, no one knows. Bob Cain, "Headline News."
