Martin Sexton got his first guitar at 14. He was starting to play 
in a band not too long after that. His first record came out in 1990, 
and he spent the rest of this decade writing, performing, gaining 
new audiences in clubs and concert halls across America. VOA's Katherine 
Kohl introduces us to this modern-day troubadour and his newest album 
"The American." When it came time to make this record, Martin Sexton 
says he went into the studio and set out to share the experiences 
that he's had crisscrossing the United States. And like a journey, 
I wanted it to have peaks and valleys and wide open spaces, and I 
think I -- I got it. I got a record that has everything from jazz 
to rock and roll to soul music to a cowboy ballad to a folk tune all 
in one record. That's "The American," the title track to Martin Sexton's 
third CD. Its 12 songs are a mix of blues, folk, soul, country, and 
rock and roll. The constant here is Martin Sexton. He handles all 
the guitar, bass, and vocal parts. He says the background singing 
was the most fun. I just saw it as this great opportunity to whip 
out these characters that I've been singing and doing live for in 
my head or in the shower for, you know, all my life. So I got to be 
those sons of the pioneers on "The American," or I got to be the gay 
men's chorus on "My Maria," I got to the be the soul sisters on "The 
Beast in Me." "The Beast in Me" is off Martin Sexton's new collection 
called "The American." Martin Sexton wrote or co-wrote all of the 
songs on the album. One, "My Maria," was inspired by an incident at 
the family church in Syracuse, New York. The pastor wanted to take 
down a statue of Mary in the Catholic Church because he felt it was 
a distraction. I was remembering my days as a sort of a mischievous 
troublemaker as a young teenager and how I sort of viewed Mary as 
this symbol of grace and forgiveness and mothering and nurturing and 
caring. So I just thought, wow, what a shame it would have been to 
have her be torn down. That's Martin Sexton singing all the background 
vocals on "My Maria," one of the 12 songs on this new CD called "The 
American." Now if you're not familiar with his work, "The American" 
is a wonderful introduction. I'm Katherine Kohl.
