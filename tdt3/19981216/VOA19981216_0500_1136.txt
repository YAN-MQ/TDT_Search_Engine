Major League Baseball's winter meetings will apparently end with five-time 
Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Roger Clemens still a member of the 
Toronto Blue Jays. The 36-year-old strikeout artist says he wants 
to leave the Blue Jays because he doesn't feel they've made a serious 
effort to field a competitive team next season. Toronto General Manager 
Gord Ash says Clemens' wishes have not changed. My understanding is 
-- from Roger and through his representatives is the criteria has 
not changed, and that criteria is to be closer to home or to be with 
a championship-caliber ball club, in their opinion. What they do from 
there is up to them. Clemens' agents are expected to seek a deal surpassing 
the record $15-million-a-year contract given to free agent pitcher 
Kevin Brown by the Los Angeles Dodgers.
