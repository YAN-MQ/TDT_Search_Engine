The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 17: At 
an October conference called ``The Claims of Memory,'' the novelist 
Cynthia Ozick is reported to have said, ``The aims of the imagination 
are not the aims of history.'' These words come to mind in the case 
of the Nobel peace laureate Rigoberta Menchu. A new book by the anthropologist 
David Stoll now refutes a number of claims in Ms. Menchu's widely 
celebrated memoir, ``I, Rigoberta Menchu,'' published in 1983. These 
include her assertions that the adversaries in her family's land disputes 
were wealthy landowners of European extraction, that she witnessed 
mass executions by burning, and that, as a young woman, she worked 
as a laborer and political organizer. The question this case raises 
is how best to serve the aims of history. For the most part, the crimes 
Ms. Menchu reported, including widespread political murder and torture, 
were real crimes, even if she learned of some of them from others. 
The struggle to which Ms. Menchu has devoted herself _ asserting the 
rights of indigenous peoples _ is a struggle in which most of her 
immediate family died and for which she herself has suffered. The 
criminal oppression of indigenous peoples in Guatemala cannot be disputed 
nor can the impact of her example. Why, then, the sinking feeling 
upon learning that some of the essential facts in ``I, Rigoberta Menchu'' 
are not true? In a war between unequals, especially when the more 
powerful side is rampantly duplicitous, we expect that truth will 
be on the side of the innocent. Ms. Menchu has clearly chosen what 
might generously be called ``representative'' truth, where the sufferings 
of a people are conflated in the tale of an individual life. Her achievement 
has been diminished because she altered the truth, perhaps merely 
in order to make her story more emblematic. That sad fact mitigates 
none of the crimes committed against Guatemalan Indians. Testimony 
is the people's history, but it is only as powerful as it is true.
