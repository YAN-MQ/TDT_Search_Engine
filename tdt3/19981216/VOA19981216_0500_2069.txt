Israel is facing political uncertainty today. Pressure for early elections 
in Israel has intensified with Tuesday's surprise notice of resignation 
plans by the finance minister Yaacov Ne'eman. Prime Minister Netanyahu's 
office confirmed that Mr. Ne'eman has said he will formally resign 
early next week. Next Monday, Israel's parliament is expected to vote 
on a bill to force national elections 18 months ahead of schedule. 
Prime Minister Netanyahu says he is not afraid of elections and says 
he has long disappointed people who tried to write his political obituary.
