Cambodian officials are investigating reports that toxic waste may 
have been dumped in offshore fishing grounds. The probe follows the 
discovery of hundreds of tons of industrial waste about 15 kilometers 
inland from the southern port city of Sihanoukville. Hugh Watkin has 
details. The suspected toxic material was found inside triple-lined 
sacks marked with skull-and-crossbones warning signs. Cambodian customs 
officials say the waste was imported by a local company last week 
as part of a 3,000-ton shipment from Taiwan described in documents 
as construction waste. They say the shipment was approved by what 
they call high officials in Phnom Penh but declined to elaborate further. 
Environment Minister Mark Moritz says it remains uncertain whether 
the waste is toxic, but he fears for local water supplies. He says 
the United Nations has agreed to send experts to examine the material 
and that the packing and that the warning sign indicated it is dangerous. 
Heng Narich, deputy director of the pollution control department, 
says the waste is not radioactive but may have come from an industrial 
incinerator and may contain heavy metal such as mercury and lead. 
Mr. Moritz says local people have emptied some of the sacks and have 
taken them home for bedding and for storing rice. "Hungkinsun" reports 
say several of those people have died after bouts of severe diarrhea, 
while others have reported skin conditions. Mr. Moritz has set up 
an interim ministerial committee to investigate the dumping and other 
reports that waste has been disposed of in the sea close to the Cambodian 
coast. He says, if proved toxic, the material will be shipped back 
to Taiwan and ceded it will be difficult to repatriate the waste without 
the express permission of Taiwanese authorities. Cambodia does not 
have expertise in handling industrial waste and has no law banning 
its importation, making it an ideal dumping ground for the global 
toxic waste industry. This is Hugh Watkin for VOA News, Phnom Penh.
