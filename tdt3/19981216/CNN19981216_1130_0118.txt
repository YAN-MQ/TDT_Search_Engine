On the eve of house debate on impeachment of President Clinton, the 
White House continues to hope for support from republican moderates. 
Administration lawyers have been pressing their case in private meetings 
with GOP representatives who have not said how they will vote. Mr. 
Clinton is expected to meet with one of them, Connecticut congressman 
christopher Shays, who has been meeting with his constituents to ask 
their views. Two previously undecided republicans announced their 
intentions within the last hour. I will vote to impeach the president 
because he shattered the trust of the american people by committing 
perjury, obstructing justice and corroding the rule of law. It's ours 
of our civil society. He has led the U.S. house to the path we must 
now take. Very simply, the highest law enforcement officer of the 
land has committed felonies, which by their very nature, constitute 
high crimes worthy of impeachment. Frankly, I cannot walk away and 
do nothing about what I know in my heart and in my mind has happened. 
So, this week, when the articles of impeachment are considered, I 
will cast a yes vote for these articles and refer the matter for consideration 
to the senate, which is under the constitution the appropriate body 
to consider what is the appropriate punitive actions to be taken about 
these items. A few republicans say they won't make a decision until 
tomorrow. The house convenes then to debate the four articles of impeachment 
approved by the Judiciary committee. That debate is set to last at 
least eight hours, and could carry into friday.
