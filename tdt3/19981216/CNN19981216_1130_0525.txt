The world's largest flight attendants' union wants the government 
to set a Uniform standard for carry-on baggage. It's called a news 
conference today to air its concerns. Kalin Thomas-Samuel has more. 
With another holiday almost here, air travelers are trying to carry 
more baggage onto the plane. We've had quite a bit of luggage going 
back since the holidays, everyone wants to send presents back with 
us. The overhead bins would be totally filled and people would be 
milling around in the aisles, looking for space and the net result 
was delayed flights. So the airlines said "we've got to do something 
about this, we're going to crack down and enforce our rules." But 
what are the rules? Each airline has its own limits from no size limits 
to a maximum of 10" x 16". And from allowing two carry-on bags, plus 
a briefcase or purse, to just one bag, briefcase included. That's 
why the association of flight attendants is again asking the FAA for 
uniform regulations. We're not going to count how much luggage that 
you're bringing on, but we're going to say to you that, "if all of 
the luggage that you have will cumulatively fit in this size box, 
then you can bring it on." The flight attendants say limits are needed 
to reduce injuries, improve safety, eliminate confusion and reduce 
delays. United airlines supports the flight attendants proposal. Both 
united and Delta are limiting carry-on size by installing templates 
at security checkpoints. We firmly believe that the best policy is 
one that solves the problem the farthest away from the gate and boarding 
process. How are you doing today? But continental, whose passengers 
go through some of the same checkpoints, is challenging that. While 
it's perfectly okay for Delta to restrict its customers, it's not 
okay to impose that same restriction on continental's passengers. 
So what we have done is, we have invested some $14 million to retrofit 
our airplanes to make our overhead bins larger. One of the keys to 
reducing carry-ons is to improve baggage handling. Many travelers 
don't want to check their bags for fear of them getting damaged or 
lost. A luggage manufacturers association recently conducted an Internet 
survey. A full 83% of the passengers traveling by air would indeed 
check their bags if they felt more confident about airline baggage 
handling systems. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, CNN Atlanta.
