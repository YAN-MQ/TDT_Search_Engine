Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart led his team to the 
AFC championship game last year, but his leadership has fallen on 
hard times this season. The Steelers have lost three straight games 
and are struggling with a 7-and-7 record. Last Sunday, Stewart was 
benched by head coach Bill Cowher during their game against Tampa 
Bay. Stewart yelled in Coward's face and later wept openly on the 
sidelines. Cowher did not like it at all. What he did was flat wrong, 
and he knows it. I discussed it with him yesterday, and right now, 
he's not playing very good football, and until he starts playing good, 
consistent football, I will continue to do what I think is in the 
best interests of this team and, you know, I -- he's going to have 
to learn to deal with that. That's part of maturing. That's part of 
accepting the responsibilities that go with the position that he plays. 
Stewart is ranked 26th in the NFL's quarterback efficiency rating 
this season, and only three other quarterbacks have been intercepted 
more.
