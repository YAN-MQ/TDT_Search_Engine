Bowing to criticism at home and abroad, South Korea's Samsung group 
said Wednesday it was giving up management of golfer Se Ri Pak but 
would continue as a corporate sponsor. Samsung said it was talking 
to International Management Group of the United States and three other 
companies about terms of a management contract for the 21-year-old 
star. ``We just began talks with IMG and we are in contact with three 
other companies,'' Kim Il-keun, a Samsung spokesman, said. He declined 
to reveal names of the other companies. Samsung signed a 10-year contract 
with Pak in 1996 under which she received about dlrs 1 million a year 
and unspecified performance bonuses and Samsung became her manager 
and sole sponsor. But Kim said Samsung would give up its management 
role next year and allow Pak to negotiate deals with golf equipment 
makers and other companies that do not compete directly with Samsung. 
``It is impossible to calculate exactly, but we believe the advertising 
impact _ Pak's playing golf in clothes with Samsung logos on _ is 
worth'' the loss of sole sponsorship rights, Kim said. ``That's what 
we will get.'' The new management company will take commissions from 
golf equipment makers and others for using Pak in advertisements in 
return for handling her schedules, press releases and contracts. The 
decision came after Samsung was criticized for its handling of Pak, 
especially during her weeklong visit to South Korea in late October 
and early November. During the visit, Pak had to attend a golf tournament, 
numerous promotional events for Samsung, a parade in her hometown 
and a medal ceremony with the president. She ended up being hospitalized 
for exhaustion. Last week, golf coach David Leadbetter ended his relationship 
with Pak, saying it was difficult working with a player who was controlled 
by so many interests _ Samsung, her father and agents hired by Samsung 
and the family. Kim refused to comment on the criticism, saying Samsung 
will release its official position when a deal is finalized with a 
management firm. Pak won the LPGA Championship in May and then became 
the youngest winner of the U.S. Women's Open a month later. She won 
twice more, setting an LPGA scoring record in one tournament, and 
finished the year second to Annika Sorenstam in money and the player 
of the year points. In voting by the Golf Writers Association of America, 
Pak was selected LPGA player of the year. Based in Cleveland, Ohio, 
IMG manages many famous athletes including golfers Mark O'Meara, Tiger 
Woods and Annika Sorenstam. Its former clients include Jack Nicklaus, 
Greg Norman, Nick Faldo and Nick Price.
