BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Senior U.S. envoys are acknowledging a 
huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethinc Albanians on the future 
of the province in the wake of violence that marred an informal peace 
deal and left 42 people dead. After a late-night meeting Tuesday with 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, both senior envoy Richard Holbrooke 
and Christopher Hill, the U.S. diplomat most involved in daily efforts 
to broker a peace, appeared pessimistic. ``The gap between the Serbs 
and the Albanians on the future of Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke 
told reporters, without detailing his talks with Milosevic. Hill said, 
``enormous differences remain between the two sides.'' The Yugoslav 
army said it killed 36 ethnic Albanian rebels and wounded a dozen 
in a five-hour gun battle near the border with Albania Monday. The 
guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and conduit for arms. On Tuesday, 
detonations and shots were heard from the sealed-off border area. 
Residents said the Yugoslav army sent armored vehicles and at least 
one helicopter into the region. International monitors said they saw 
31 bodies, all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred 
meters (yards) of the border. They said they appeared to be rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in 
guns and grenades. In separate violence, at least six Serbs, including 
five teenagers, were killed and three were wounded late Monday in 
Kosovo's western town of Pec when unidentified assailants opened fire 
Monday in a bar. Serb media blamed the killings on the ethnic Albanian 
rebels. All Serb schools remained closed in Pec in protest of the 
killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the terrorists'' 
and urged a return of Serb security forces which had to partially 
withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored agreement was 
reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported. In Belgrade, Holbrooke 
condemned the Pec killings, calling them ``outrageous and unacceptable,'' 
and ``appaling beyond words.'' Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement 
to end the fighting in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic 
of Serbia. The deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought 
time for diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of 
the province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence. 
A top government body for the province said the killings of Serbs 
were ``the most monstruous crime in the series of assaults by Albanian 
terrorist gangs.'' ``The problem in Kosovo is not about human rights, 
this is most cruel terrorism and Nazism supported secretly and publicly 
by some representatives of the ethnic Albanian community,'' the statement 
from the Temporary Executivy Council for Kosovo said. The statement 
also demanded an end to ``Western, one-sided condemnation of Serbs 
and the Serbian people in Kosovo'' and for ``international recognition 
of what is obvious...that Albanian terrorists and their political 
leaders are the obstacle for reaching a peaceful solution in Kosovo.'' 
A reaction by ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party said the murders 
``show the intention of Albanian terrorist gangs to achieve independent 
Kosovo at any rate, using most brutal methods like the murder of innocent 
children.'' Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order 
(for airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful 
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the fighting 
may flare up.'' U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, 
raising fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting. 
Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct. 12 
agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after Milosevic 
launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February, leaving hundreds 
dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless. Ethnic Albanian politicians 
insist on a plan that would enable them to break free of Serbian rule 
but seem prepared to accept autonomy instead of independence _ at 
least temporarily. The rebels say they won't accept anything short 
of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more 
than partial autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant 
Yugoslav republic.
