Finalist for the last three seasons, Juventus is the new favorite 
to win the Champions Cup after Wednesday's quarterfinal draw in Geneva. 
La Juve, which only squeezed into the last eight after its first win 
in six group matches, was paired with outsider Olympiakos of Greece. 
That meant it avoided the big names in the draw, Real Madrid, Inter 
Milan, Bayern Munich and Manchester United. Bookmakers Ladbrokes installed 
the Turin team, which lost 1-0 to Real Madrid in last season's final, 
as the 7-2 favorite. Seven-time and defending titlist Real Madrid, 
which faces Dynamo Kiev of Ukraine, is 4-1 joint second favorite with 
Bayern, which meets its German rival Kaiserslautern. Inter Milan, 
favorite before the draw, is now fourth at 9-2, paired with another 
soccer giant, Manchester United. Ladbrokes has dropped United to 5-1. 
Kiev is rated a 9-1 shot, Kaiserslautern is 12-1 and Olympiakos 25-1. 
Ladbrokes makes Lazio the 6-4 favorite in the Cup Winners Cup ahead 
of defending titlist Chelsea, which is 7-4. Lazio faces Greek club 
Panionis while Chelsea faces Valerenga of Norway. The three Italians 
clubs in the UEFA Cup are also top of the odds list. Parma, which 
faces Bordeaux, is the 11-4 favorite, Roma, which meets Atletico Madrid, 
is 7-2 and Bologna, which plays Lyon, is 5-1.
