The U.N. panel overseeing compensation for loss and damage caused 
by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Wednesday approved dlrs 181 million 
for companies involved in a hydroelectric dam project. The 10 corporations 
took part in the Bekhma dam project in Iraq, whose construction was 
halted after the 1990 invasion, Mojtaba Kazazi, secretary of the U.N. 
Compensation Commission, told reporters. The award fell far short 
of the total dlrs 856 million they had claimed. The largest shares 
of the money went to Turkish and Bosnian firms. U.S. company Overseas 
Bechtel was awarded some dlrs 4 million, and firms from Croatia, Yugoslavia 
and Germany were also compensated. Resolving the latest batch of compensation 
claims from individuals, the U.N. commission awarded another dlrs 
53 million to 129 claimants. Compensation awards approved by the 15-nation 
commission are paid using Iraqi oil sales approved by the U.N. Security 
Council. In total, the commission has received around 2.6 million 
compensation demands for a total of some dlrs 240 billion from individuals, 
governments and corporations seeking compensation for loss and damage 
caused by the invasion of Kuwait. Processing the claims is expected 
to take several more years.
