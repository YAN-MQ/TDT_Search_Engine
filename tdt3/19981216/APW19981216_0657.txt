World powers frustrated with the pace of reconciliation in Bosnia 
approved Wednesday a plan to advance the process and warned fractious 
ethnic leaders that foreign aid is not open-ended. The Bosnia Peace 
Implementation Council endorsed the blueprint after a two-day meeting 
called to review progress in implementing the Dayton peace accords, 
which ended Bosnia's 1992-1995 war among Muslims, Croats and Serbs. 
The council, which comprises more than 40 countries and international 
organizations, set out a package of measures for reforming the Bosnian 
economy, strengthening government institutions and encouraging the 
return of tens of thousands of refugees and displaced persons. It 
stated that some success in these areas has already been made, saying 
``a lasting peace within Bosnia and Herzegovina is starting to take 
root.'' But it warned that Bosnia is still in no condition to survive 
without outside help. ``Without the scaffolding of international support, 
it would collapse,'' the council said in a 30-page declaration. The 
document was hammered out around a large triangular table symbolizing 
Bosnia's three ethnic groups. The Dayton accord, reached in December 
1995, carved Bosnia up into a Serb Republic and a Muslim-Croat Federation, 
each with their own government linked by a nominal central government. 
Some 30,000 troops of the NATO-led Stabilization Force keep the peace 
among ethnic communities that remain deeply distrustful of each other 
three years after the fighting stopped. The international community's 
top peace coordinator, Carlos Westendorp, said that in general terms 
Bosnia's biggest problem in getting back on its feet is lingering 
ultra-nationalism. ``The mentality that led to the war is still there,'' 
he said. ``The international community has helped a lot and is willing 
to continue helping. But it is high time that the authorities of that 
country assume their responsibilities,'' he added. On the aid front, 
the council reminded Bosnian leaders that their Balkan nation is among 
the world's ``most assisted countries'' and that this multi-billion 
dollar aid will soon start to dwindle. ``Bosnia and Herzegovina must 
use the time that remains to prepare for life without total reliance 
on foreign aid, and to face up to the challenge of transforming the 
economy to generate jobs and a better standard of living,'' the council 
said.
