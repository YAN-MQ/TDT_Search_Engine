"CNN Headline News," I'm Chuck Roberts. The U.N. security council 
is holding an urgent session about the latest crisis with Iraq. The 
meeting was called by Russia and France to discuss a report filed 
by chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler. It alleges Iraq has 
broken promises to cooperate with arms inspectors, who have been pulled 
out of Baghdad. Most of the 140 inspectors flew aboard a special U.N. 
plane this morning to bahrain. President Clinton met with his national 
security team this morning to discuss possible military strikes against 
Iraq. The president also has consulted with members of Congress. Sources 
tell CNN house leaders have tentatively agreed to postpone the impeachment 
debate in the house, which had been scheduled for tomorrow. But several 
republicans say this is not a "wag the dog" scenario, designed to 
avoid impeachment. If I would suggest there's anything about the timing, 
which is more than unusual, it's on Saddam Hussein's part. He likes 
these games. I wouldn't be surprised if he did this right now just 
because he knew we might be considering impeachment at this moment. 
The United States already has a sizeable military presence in the 
Persian gulf. It consists of 24,100 military personnel, 22 ships and 
more than 200 aircraft, including 15 B-52s, which are armed with hundreds 
of cruise missiles and bombs.
