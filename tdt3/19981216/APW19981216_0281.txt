Fugitive former President Canaan Banana was placed under house arrest 
Wednesday after ending an international manhunt by surrendering to 
police. Banana, convicted in absentia on Nov. 26 on sodomy and homosexual 
assault charges, was ordered to remain under police guard at his mansion 
in the luxury Harare suburb of Mount Pleasant until sentencing next 
week. The former president was convicted on 11 gay sex charges after 
he had fled the country, first to neighboring Botswana and then to 
South Africa. Banana said he fled Zimbabwe to escape political persecution 
and meet with ``real friends,'' including President Nelson Mandela 
of South Africa. ``I left the country because I was in possession 
of dangerous information, so I had to share it with my real friends,'' 
the 63-year-old Banana said without elaborating. The Harare High Court 
set Dec. 23 for sentencing and to consider Banana's status after he 
jumped bail, forfeiting his bond of 30,000 Zimbabwe dollars and the 
title deed to his Harare home. He also allegedly crossed international 
borders illegally. There were indications Banana would be treated 
with leniency. On Sunday, Mandela and Zimbabwean President Robert 
Mugabe discussed Banana's case. Mandela said then the two leaders 
reached a ``common position'' on Banana, believed to be an agreement 
to persuade him to return home, possibly as part of deal for a light 
sentence or even a pardon from Mugabe. Banana, a Methodist minister 
and theology professor, served as ceremonial president after independence 
in 1980 until 1987. State prosecutors say Banana fled first to neighboring 
Botswana, where he met with church and political officials, and then 
to South Africa, entering both countries illegally after surrendering 
his passport during his trial earlier this year. Mandela triggered 
controversy when he saw Banana at his Pretoria residence at Banana's 
request this month. Attorney Erik Morris, acting for Banana last Friday, 
told the court the politician had left the country ``not to defeat 
the course of justice or evade punishment.'' ``He had a political 
agenda and wished to meet with heads of state, for he had matters 
to impart,'' Morris said. Chief state prosecutor Augustine Chikumira, 
who agreed to Banana's house arrest, said that under Zimbabwe law, 
there was no maximum penalty for Banana's convictions. Chikumira said 
Banana faced a fine or prison term. Earlier, state prosecutors had 
said Banana faced up 22 years in jail for the 11 convictions. Reports 
by the state media Wednesday said Banana had surrendered at the border 
with South Africa Tuesday and was whisked to Harare in a limousine 
accompanied by Zimbabwean detectives. Mugabe, at a church assembly 
last week, praised Banana for his political role combating racism 
in the church before independence in 1980. The state media has also 
urged Zimbabweans to forgive Banana, seen as a sign of a likely pardon. 
Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe. Banana was prosecuted after 
revelations of his predatory homosexuality were made in the trial 
of a police inspector who killed a colleague for taunting him over 
a three year sexual relationship Banana forced on him while president.
