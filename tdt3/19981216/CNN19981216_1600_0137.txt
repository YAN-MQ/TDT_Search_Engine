A sign of just how close a military attack could be came this morning 
with the pullout of the United Nations weapons inspectors. Rula Amin 
reports, their departure has only added to the tension in baghdad. 
All U.N. arms inspectors left Baghdad this morning, after their chief 
inspector Richard Butler reported that Iraq had failed to deliver 
on its promise to fully cooperate with the inspectors. The inspectors' 
departure to Bahrain was seen in Baghdad as a sign of an imminent 
military strike against Iraq. President Saddam Hussein met with leaders 
of the ruling ba'ath party and the revolutionary command council and 
reviewed Iraqi measures to face up to what an official statement said 
was an American/British aggression. The statement dismissed the military 
threats and called upon Iraqis to fight back. By the afternoon, Iraq's 
youth TV, run by President Hussein's eldest son, oudite, started showing 
five pictures of Iraqi paramilitary forces in exercise. Iraq's deputy 
prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said in a statement that Butler's report 
was ill-intended and was tailored to justify what he called an american/British 
aggression against Iraq. What is at stake here is not only the consequences 
of a military strike, but also Iraq's hopes and expectations for an 
easing of the 8-year-old sanctions. The security council had demanded 
Iraq's full cooperation before it reviewed Iraq compliance with the 
U.N. resolutions. Since last November, Iraq has been pushing for the 
security council to conduct such a review. Baghdad was hoping that 
it would receive credit for progress it claims it made in getting 
rid of its weapons of mass destruction. And that would have led to 
an easing of the sanctions. But with Richard Butler saying that Iraq 
has failed to cooperate, that review could be further than ever and 
Iraq's pursuit of what it calls a Light at the end of the tunnel, 
might be reaching a deadend. A conclusion Baghdad rejects. Iraqi officials 
say, they have been cooperating with inspectors for eight years and 
that it's time they see results. If they don't, they warn, no more 
cooperation should be expected. Rula Amin for CNN, Baghdad.
