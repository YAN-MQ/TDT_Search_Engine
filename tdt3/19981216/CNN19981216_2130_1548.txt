Their stories will tug at your heartstrings. Children who have endured 
tragic life events have been honored in Great Britain. Adrian Britton 
was there. 11 children with 11 stories of heroism and endurance. These 
young faces are being chosen by their schools, the emergency services 
and hospitals to be this year's children of courage. Among them, 9-year-old 
emmet McLaughlin who survived the omagh bomb. He was on a day trip 
to the town with four friends. Three of them died in the terrorist 
explosion. At the awards reception today, it was a time for emmet 
to reflect on the attention he was receiving for bravely coping with 
his injuries. I've been okay, just some nightmares. And that's it. 
Yeah, how do you manage to cope with the nightmares? Just share it 
with my mommy and daddy. At the age of 10, David Henderson cares for 
his mother who is totally blind. He told me how his household work 
starts each day before school. Get my mom's clothes out. Wash the 
pots, dry them, put them away. Sort the socks out and sort the clothes 
out. To be quite honest, if it wasn't for my son helping me, I would 
be lost. This is David. Inside 10 downing street this morning, the 
prime minister and his wife met David and his fellow award winners 
in recognition of their bravery. Seated around the cabinet table, 
these children join the 200 youngsters who've been honored over the 
past 25 years. For many, it will be their first Christmas having to 
cope with their injuries, but today was a moment to acknowledge young 
courage. Adrian Britton, itn, Westminster.
