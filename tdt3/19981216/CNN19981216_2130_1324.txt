It's no surprise that Kordell Stewart was not elected to the AFC team, 
his poor season resulting in a shouting match with Bill cowher on 
sunday, a tongue-lashing by his head coach yesterday and an apology 
today. I promise you it will never happen again. The best thing I 
can do now is just go out and just play and have fun. And, you know, 
it can get better, believe me when I tell you, you know, 'cause it 
can't get any worse than what happened, besides grabbing a coach and 
choking him. I'm not gonna do that, believe me. I promise you that 
won't happen.
