The advertising agency that urged Apple Computer buyers to ``Think 
different'' has managed to be on the cusp once again of an evolution 
in workplace design. Four years ago, Chiat/Day led the charge into 
the brave new world of ``virtual officing'' when its headquarters 
in Venice, Calif., proved too small for a fast-expanding staff. Jay 
Chiat, the company's founder, equipped everyone with a mobile phone, 
a laptop and a personal locker, and turned a problem into a much vaunted 
workplace experiment. Now, just months shy of the third millennium, 
TBWA/Chiat/Day, as the company is known, has traded virtual communication 
for the real thing. It has just moved into a new space in the Playa 
del Rey section of Los Angeles, where everyone has his own desk and 
human interaction is key, in a plan that draws from a model as ancient 
as telecommuting is new: the city. The offices, in a vast warehouse 
designed for 500 employees by Clive Wilkinson Architects, are a microcosmic 
``Chiat town'' of private and group work spaces and public ``streets'' 
and meeting places that provide for every kind of company activity. 
Staff members enjoy kaffeeklatsches in a ``Central Park,'' mingle 
on a ``main street'' and have a work space they can call home in surrounding 
``neighborhoods.'' This turnabout by the progressive company reflects 
a ``phenomenal shift in people's thinking'' about the state of the 
art of the workplace, said Despina Katsikakis, director of DEGW, a 
London-based international consultancy on workplace design. While 
virtual officing is by no means dead _ TBWA/Chiat/Day staff members 
still carry mobile phones and beepers, and connect by computer _ the 
latest experiment in breaking free from designs based on the old hierarchical 
pecking order is what Ms. Katsikakis called ``community-based planning.'' 
It locates staff members in teams (rather than on status-implied floors), 
offers private spaces and includes clubby meeting areas. This approach 
is now being tried at corporations like Andersen Consulting, in its 
offices around the world, and at Sun Microsystems in Palo Alto, albeit 
in a more conservative style than at TBWA/Chiat/Day. The agency has 
always experimented with architecture and the workplace, starting 
with its move, in 1979, to the venerable Biltmore Hotel in downtown 
Los Angeles. (``Jay didn't want the firm to lose touch with the consumer,'' 
said Laurie Coots, the chief marketing officer for the company.) That 
was followed, in the mid-'80s, by a move to the bohemian Venice, first 
to a temporary warehouse space and then to its own building, both 
landmark designs by Frank Gehry. Chiat also had two of Gehry's fellow 
superstar architects, Rem Koolhaas and Gaetano Pesce, create, respectively, 
London and New York offices. In each space, the aim of the architecture 
was to keep people stimulated and feeling part of a family, albeit 
one with a steely drive and a yen for knowing self-promotion. In 1976, 
the company ran an advertisement in Adweek declaring its pain at losing 
a Honda account. Now, it is cheerfully revising its thinking about 
what makes a workplace work. The virtual office ``sounded good in 
theory, but ultimately violated human tenets,'' said Lee Clow, the 
company's chairman. He added, ``People need a sense of place and belonging.'' 
The idea behind the virtual office was that telecommuting would allow 
people to work anywhere, anytime, and that they would use the outgrown 
building only for teamwork. As it turned out, most staff members needed 
or wanted to work under the same roof. Current and former employees 
paint a picture of harried workers fighting over too-few desks, defiantly 
displaying family photos and trying to stake out personal space in 
a place planned like a club. ``People felt like they were working 
in a cocktail party,'' Ms. Coots said. The new place blends what the 
company sees as the best of the previous environments. Yes, TBWA/Chiat/Day 
staff members still share the airwaves. But now, Ms. Coots said, ``we 
share the same air.'' From a vivid yellow exterior gatehouse, visitors 
enter a large busy industrial-style space _ a playful version of Fritz 
Lang's Metropolis. Youthful employees buzz about: up and down the 
mesh stairs and balconies; along the wide ``main street'' of stacked 
``cliff dwellings,'' Hollywood Squares-style, that are home to pairs 
of art directors and copywriters who work as creative teams; in Central 
Park, a ficus-lined internal plaza, and on the hallowed basketball 
court, a symbol of the zest and competitiveness of the firm. Scattered 
around this town center are neighborhoods of project dens: groups 
of desks enclosed by diaphanous spandex tent structures for privacy 
and open-plan work areas with freestanding aluminum work stations 
called Nests (for New Environment for Strategic Tasking), one-legged 
desks with screens for acoustic and visual privacy. (They are now 
manufactured by the agency in a co-production with the office furniture 
giant Steelcase.) The cute name refers to the very nesting instincts 
that virtual officing had rejected and that are now being increasingly 
factored into office planning nationwide. TBWA/Chiat/Day has rebounded 
from a bumpy patch in the mid-'90s, during which it was sold to a 
holding company, the Omnicom Group, was merged with TBWA and saw the 
departure of Jay Chiat, whose demanding, inventive spirit, company 
members say, lives on in the space and in the work. It was unanimously 
picked as agency of the year for 1997 by the advertising trade magazines, 
and this year, it scored an Emmy for its Apple Computer campaign, 
which features arresting images of great achievers, stamped with the 
slogan ``Think different.'' But how innovative is the new office? 
The design merges the high-tech style popular in Europe, typified 
by Richard Rodgers' and Renzo Piano's Pompidou Center, with the robust 
warehouse office projects of Gehry and the late Frank Israel. While 
it may be striking and lively, with its jazzy cliff dwellings, billowing 
tent structures, flying balconies, exposed plywood partitions and 
touches of whimsy (like a bar made of surfboards), it doesn't quite 
break the old pecking order. In following the principles of good town 
planning, the company has, in fact, introduced hierarchy, albeit of 
a more accessible kind than the mahogany-paneled corner office of 
traditional corporate America. Two company principals who once had 
spaces equal to everyone else's now each have impressive suites overlooking 
Central Park, and while creative pairs get prominent, private ``cliff 
dwellings,'' most of the rest nest in the open-plan areas. And as 
for staying in touch with the consumer, the new TBWA/Chiat/Day is 
an interior world. Viewless, located at the end of a road of industrial 
buildings and bungalows (near where Dreamworks is due to start construction), 
the office is currently nowhere near cafes, shoe repairs, stores or 
pedestrians _ namely, the stuff and stimuli of daily life. A former 
staff member, Rebecca Epstein, now a doctoral student at the school 
of film and television at the University of California at Los Angeles, 
said that she found it a somewhat isolating experience. ``Because 
the light is the same all day long, and you have no sense of time,'' 
she said, ``it's a little like a casino.'' Even the new artwork is 
self-reflective: a fish tank from TBWA/Chiat/Day's Energizer bunny 
campaign, agency commercials broadcast nonstop on a large screen over 
the basketball court, sofas upholstered in Levi denim (Levi's jeans 
is a new client), and a billboard featuring Picasso, one of the Apple 
``Think different'' personalities. The all-seeing, all-knowing nature 
of the space, with its mezzanines, walkways and glass-fronted cubicles, 
reminded one visitor of the slightly totalitarian feel of a penitentiary. 
But an employee who refused to be identified said the new offices 
are ``like a big playground.'' And she likes the fact that they are 
all on one floor, which, she said, ``invites more interaction.'' Ironically, 
Bob Kuperman, the company's president, said that some of the agency's 
best work was produced in its last space _ cocktail party or not. 
He cited the ``Think different'' campaign, a provocative series of 
ads extolling television for ABC and the Taco Bell talking chihuahua. 
``There's something to be said for the fact that the overcrowding 
did cause a high level of energy and creative output,'' he said. A 
self-declared advocate of ``friction and upset,'' Kuperman added that 
``the company is right on the edge'' with its new quarters. Meanwhile 
in New York, the virtual office designed by Gaetano Pesce, however 
gorgeous, sent some staff members over the edge. Wilkinson says the 
agency has moved out of its overcrowded and confusing space into new 
offices that he is designing. And where is that new workplace? In 
the former bastion of the advertising elite, the epitome of everything 
the old Chiat/Day repudiated: Madison Avenue. Think different indeed.
