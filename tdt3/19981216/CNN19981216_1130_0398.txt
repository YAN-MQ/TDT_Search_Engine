The government is warning people to be very careful about buying items 
listed as being on sale. The federal trade commission says 1 of every 
28 sale items listed scans the wrong price at checkout stands. And 
the FTC claims two-thirds of the time, that wrong price is higher 
than is advertised. The national retail federation says it's a remarkably 
low error rate, and retailers are taking steps to improve pricing 
accuracy.
