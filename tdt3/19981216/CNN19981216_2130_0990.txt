If you're planning to travel by plane this holiday season, consider 
what airline you're flying before you pack your bags. Kalin Thomas 
Samuel tells us why in this edition of "working ahead." With another 
holiday almost here, air travelers are trying to carry more baggage 
onto the plane. We've had quite a bit of luggage going back since 
the holidays, everyone wants to send presents back with us. The overhead 
bins would be totally filled and people were milling around in the 
aisles, trying to look for space. And the net result was delayed flights. 
So the airlines, even before the holiday, said "we've got to do something 
about this, we're going to crack down and enforce our rules." But 
what are the rules? Each airline has its own -- from no size limits 
to a Max of 10" x 16". And from allowing two carry-on bags, plus a 
briefcase or purse, to just one bag, briefcase included. That's why 
the association of flight attendants is again asking the FAA for uniform 
regulations. We're not going to count how much luggage that you're 
bringing on, but we're going to say to you, "if all of the luggage 
that you have will cumulatively fit in this sizer box, then you can 
bring it on." The flight attendants say limits are needed to reduce 
injuries, improve safety, eliminate confusion and reduce delays. United 
airlines supports the proposal. Both united and Delta are limiting 
carry-on size by installing templates at security checkpoints. We 
firmly believe that the best policy is one that solves the problem 
the farthest away from the gate and boarding process. But continental, 
whose passengers go through some of the same checkpoints, is challenging 
that. While it's perfectly okay for Delta to restrict its customers, 
it's not okay to impose that same restriction on continental's passengers. 
So what we have done is, we have invested some $14 million to retrofit 
our airplanes to make our overhead bins larger. One of the keys to 
reducing carry-ons is to improve baggage handling. Many travelers 
don't want to check their bags for fear of them being damaged or lost. 
A luggage manufacturers association recently conducted an Internet 
survey. A full 83% of the passengers that are traveling by air would 
indeed check their bags if they felt more confident about airline 
baggage handling systems. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, CNN, Atlanta.
