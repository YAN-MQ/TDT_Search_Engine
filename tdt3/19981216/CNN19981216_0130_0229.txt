Congressman Christopher Shays has turned to his constituents for help 
deciding whether President Clinton should be impeached. The republican 
from Connecticut greeted a standing-room-only crowd at a Town hall 
meeting in his home district this evening. Shays says he has a problem 
with how independent counsel Ken Starr conducted his investigation. 
What troubled me about what judge Starr did is, two months before 
an election he came before the Congress with this report. And I have 
to tell you, I have a big problem with how the independent is out 
of control, sometimes how the press is out of control, how the White 
House is out of control, how Congress is out of control. But this 
independent council deciding that he was going to Levy charges, in 
a sense, against the president in the campaign season, I believed 
as a Republican he was trying to affect the election. House speaker-elect 
Bob Livingston says he believes censure is, "beyond the house's prerogative." 
He's made it clear he thinks members should follow the constitution 
in this case. The president should not be immune. He's not president 
by Divine right. He's not a king. He's a citizen. And the only way 
the constitution envisions for him to face these charges is to be 
-- is to face articles of impeachment from the House of Representatives, 
which would be tried by the Senate.
