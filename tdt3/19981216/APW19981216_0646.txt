Thousands of Kosovo Serbs on Wednesday grieved and protested the slayings 
of six young Serbs which have dangerously inflamed already-high tensions 
in the separatist province. A mournful crowd of 5,000 gathered to 
remember the victims in a tense silence that permeated the western 
city of Pec, where the victims of the Monday night shooting were to 
be buried later in the day. Another 2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended 
a protest rally in the capital Pristina. Voicing grave concern at 
the dangerous turn of events this week in Kosovo, senior U.S. envoy 
Richard Holbrooke late Tuesday condemned the deaths as ``appalling 
beyond words.'' Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, 
renewed his determination to suppress ``terrorism.'' A top government 
body for the Serbian province, the Temporary Council for Kosovo, called 
the killings were ``the most monstrous crime in the series of assaults 
by Albanian terrorist gangs.'' Many fear the Pec killings, along with 
a border clash this week between the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian 
rebels, move the tense province closer to a renewal of all-out war. 
At least 42 people are reported to have died at the two sites, and 
the brutal barroom shooting of six Serbs in Kosovo's third-largest 
city prompted protests and threats of retaliation against rebels among 
the large Serbian population. Holbrooke, who brokered the October 
agreement that halted more than seven months of combat in the separatist 
Serbian province, appears pessimistic of reaching a political settlement 
that could stop the continuing carnage. After more than five hours 
of talks with Milosevic in Belgrade, he acknowledged Tuesday night 
that diplomats are nowhere near bridging the huge divide between Serbs 
and Kosovo's ethic Albanians on the province's status. ``The gap between 
the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of Kosovo ... is very grave,'' 
Holbrooke told reporters, without detailing his talks with Milosevic. 
While the death toll from Monday's clash between border guards and 
rebels trying to bring in arms from Albania was higher _ the army 
said it killed 36 guerrillas _ the Pec killings raised more alarm 
among international officials because they involved an attack on civilians. 
Five teen-agers were among the dead. People in the Pec crowd wept 
openly Wednesday as the six coffins were brought to the main square 
and covered with wreaths. At least one man in civilian clothing was 
seen armed with a machine gun. ``Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' 
said Mirko Simonovic, principal of the high school where four of the 
victims were students. ``They were killed for the simple reason of 
being Serbs.'' He concluded the speech with a demand that the state 
``punish the perpetrators and do away forever with Albanian terrorism.'' 
Pec, located 75 miles (45 miles) west of the capital Pristina, has 
about 150,000 residents. Like Kosovo itself, the population is overwhelmingly 
ethnic Albanian, but several thousand Serbs also live there. In his 
statement, Milosevic said security forces ``will suppress terrorism'' 
and that the ``terrorist bandits'' responsible for the Pec shooting 
would be ``found, wherever they are.'' He also accused U.S. representatives 
in the U.N. Security Council of ``losing credibility'' by blocking 
U.N. statements denouncing ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.'' Towns and 
cities have mostly escaped the violence that has engulfed Kosovo villages 
this year since Serb forces launched an offensive in February to crush 
pro-independence militants in the province of Serbia _ the dominant 
republic left in Yugoslavia. More than 1,000 people have been killed 
in months of fighting and in sporadic violence since the Oct. 12 informal 
cease-fire. The deadliest clash in the two-month tenuous standoff 
since then came Monday in a battle that international peace verifiers 
confirmed was a showdown between the army and armed fighters of the 
Kosovo Liberation Army. Many residents of nearby border villages have 
fled this week after the army sent in armored vehicles and helicopters 
to fight dozens of KLA rebels it says escaped into the nearby mountains. 
An army cordon around the area, which includes some settlements, has 
prevented verifiers and residents from entering the sealed-off area 
and it wasn't immediately clear whether the clash was continuing for 
a third day Wednesday.
