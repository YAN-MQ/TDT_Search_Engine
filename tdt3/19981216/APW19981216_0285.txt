Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky called today for a ban on 
the Communist party, a day after a top Communist lawmaker accused 
Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the country. Berezovsky said the government 
should use force to get rid of the Communists if it needs to. ``The 
later they use force the more blood that will be shed,'' Berezovsky 
said, according to the Interfax news agency. At impeachment hearings 
Tuesday against President Boris Yeltsin, Communist lawmaker Viktor 
Ilyukhin said Russia's post-Soviet collapse would not have happened 
if Russia's government was not made up ``exclusively of one group, 
the Jews.'' Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of Jews 
in prominent positions, but they have always been outnumbered by ethnic 
Russians. Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, made similar 
anti-Semitic remarks at a Moscow rally in October. Berezovsky demanded 
the Communist Party be disbanded at that time as well. ``Such people 
as Ilyukhin and Makashov should sit in the dock, and not in the Duma,'' 
Interfax quoted Berezovsky as saying. Members of the liberal Yabloko 
faction today called for a resolution denouncing Ilyukhin's statement, 
but parliament did not immediately act on the proposal. Unrepentant 
after his statements, Ilyukhin responded to the motion by accusing 
liberals of fueling anti-Semitism in Russia. ``What kind of democracy 
is it when a Russian man can't speak the truth,'' he said today. Other 
Communists demanded that Russian television networks be banned from 
covering the Duma's activities because they said coverage of Ilyukhin's 
Tuesday remarks was biased against him. The business daily Kommersant 
speculated today that Ilyukhin made the statements to provoke the 
Kremlin into trying to ban the Communist Party. ``That would strengthen 
the party's image as the main opposition force,'' the newspaper said. 
Yeltsin banned the Communist Party for one year in the early 1990s, 
but it quickly rebounded as the country's leading opposition group 
and now has the largest faction in parliament's lower house, the State 
Duma. The Communists and Berezovsky have never been on good terms. 
Many Communists believe Berezovsky, one of the country's richest and 
most powerful businessmen, symbolizes the wild, unrestrained capitalism 
that has emerged in post-Soviet Russia. The Communists have also demanded 
that Berezovsky step down from his post as executive secretary of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose grouping of 12 ex-Soviet 
republics.
