A new study in "the journal of the American medical association" suggests 
an intensive change in lifestyle can reverse heart disease. Don Knapp 
has the story. Yoga is a morning ritual for Mel lefer and his wife, 
part of a Dramatic lifestyle change he says saved his life. 13 years 
ago, the self-described workaholic, couch potato, smoker/drinker suffered 
a massive heart attack and nearly died. After he got out of the hospital, 
he hooked up with Dr. dean Ornish and made major changes in just about 
everything he does. Gradually, I started reawakening parts of my heart 
that in those days they thought were dead and would never come back. 
Lefer and his wife now follow a strict vegetarian diet with no more 
than 10% fat, a big change from their previous eating habits. It's 
quite severe. In the beginning, it was very challenging. We had gone 
from meat and potatoes to vegetables and grains. "the journal of the 
American medical association" has published dr. dean Ornish's own 
study showing heart patients on his program were able to reverse the 
effects of heart disease. They showed some measurable reversal in 
the degree of coronary artery blockages after one year, and even more 
reversal after five years than after one year. The American heart 
association says it wants to see a large-scale study before recommending 
the Ornish plan. One criticism is that the lifestyle changes Ornish 
calls for are too radical for many to follow. Most people are not 
able to make quite those severe changes in their diet, often in their 
exercise, and to participate in a program like the Ornish program. 
We ask people to quit smoking, to exercise moderately -- mainly walking 
-- to manage stress more effectively, and to eat a low-fat, plant-based 
diet. Now, how radical is that? I mean, think about it. I mean, what's 
more radical, getting your chest cut open, having balloons inflated 
in your arteries, or changing lifestyle? Lenore lefer, who has never 
suffered heart problems, finds it difficult to stay on the Ornish 
plan. But her husband Mel says the lifestyle change has not been all 
that difficult a choice, given the alternative. Don Knapp, CNN, Penngrove,
