While some female members of Congress and leaders of national women's 
organizations came out against impeachment today, other women's groups 
are expressing very different opinions. President Bill Clinton has 
disgraced our country, he's disgraced our families, he's disgraced 
the sacred office of the presidency. And now he's trying to disgrace 
the judicial system in our nation. He should be held accountable for 
his actions and he should do the honorable thing, and that's resign. 
If he can't find in his heart the moral courage to resign, then Congress 
should take it on as their responsibility to impeach this president, 
and to remove him from office. If the house votes approves articles 
of impeachment, a trial would be held in the Senate, where a two-thirds 
majority vote is needed to remove the president from office. It could 
be a very lengthy process.
