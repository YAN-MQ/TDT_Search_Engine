Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler says Iraq is not fully 
cooperating with arms monitors. Butler gave the U.N. security council 
a report Tuesday that says Iraq has imposed new restrictions on inspectors 
since they went back to work a month ago. He says Iraq has made it 
nearly impossible to conduct disarmament work and account for prohibited 
weapons. Baghdad must fulfill this requirement before the security 
council will lift u.N. sanctions. The report could set the stage for 
U.S. and British air strikes against iraq.
