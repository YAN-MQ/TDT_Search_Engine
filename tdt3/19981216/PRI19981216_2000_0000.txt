From Public Radio International, this is THE WORLD, a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI, and WGBH Boston. It's Wednesday, December 
16th. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. Today, President Clinton orders 
a substantial military strike against Iraq, citing its continued failure 
to allow U.N. weapons inspections. The attack began with long range 
Cruise missiles, and military sources say it may last up to four days. 
The president ordered the strikes this morning after reading the latest 
U.N. report about Iraq's non-compliance, and after consulting with 
his national security staff. Mr. Clinton is expected to address the 
nation shortly. Coming up, the latest on the attack and its impact 
on the vote to impeach the president. First, this news.
