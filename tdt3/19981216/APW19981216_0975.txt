Fears of upsetting France prompted German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
to intervene Wednesday in a Cabinet row about the means to abandon 
nuclear power production. Schroeder, Environment Minister Juergen 
Trittin and Economics Minister Werner Mueller will cooperate to draft 
a law for the phase-out of atomic energy after the ministers clashed 
over the repercussions of abandoning nuclear reprocessing contracts 
with French and British companies. ``This is above all meant as a 
sign of respect for France,'' Schroeder's spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye, 
said. Trittin, of the environmentalist Green Party, said this week 
he believed German companies would be able to quit reprocessing contracts 
with European partners without threat of damages claims from France. 
``Trittin's opinion wasn't shared by everyone,'' Heye said, alluding 
to both legal worries from the economics minister and political doubts 
on the part of Schroeder. Heye said responsibility for drafting the 
changes to Germany's nuclear power law remains with the environment 
ministry, but the chancellery and the economics ministry will now 
represent ``their differing viewpoints.'' The government hopes that 
the smoldering row, which threatened a rift between industry-friendly 
Schroeder and the Greens, his junior coalition partner, is now over. 
Parameters of a legislative revision are scheduled to be agreed by 
senior politicians from both parties on Jan. 13 and be submitted to 
parliament shortly thereafter. So-called consensus talks with Germany's 
nuclear power industry to find a timetable for a phase out will start 
at the end of January, Heye said.
