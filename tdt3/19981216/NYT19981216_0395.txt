A senior Indonesian Cabinet minister called Wednesday for a slowdown 
of democratic reforms, warning of widespread unrest unless the country's 
economic problems are solved first. ``I think we've gone too far and 
too fast in this area of openness,'' Culture and Education Minister 
Juwono Sudarsono said at a meeting of the Indonesia-Australia Business 
Council. Management of Indonesia's democratic reform process should 
be undertaken peacefully and in stages because of the potential for 
unrest in an ``environment of economic deprivation,'' he said. ``Things 
have been put into helter skelter now,'' he said. ``I think there 
has to be a sense of proportion in the degree of change we need to 
implement.'' Experts said Sudarsono's remarks indicated a hardening 
of the government's stance against student protesters pushing for 
a speeding up of democratic reforms. Within an hour of his remarks, 
in an incident not linked to his speech, soldiers clashed with 400 
student demonstrators outside the Defense Ministry in downtown Jakarta. 
Witnesses said at least 20 students had been hurt and 40 arrested. 
Student leaders said they were protesting a plan by the armed forces 
chief, Gen. Wiranto, to form a 40,000-member civilian militia to help 
maintain law and order on the streets before national elections next 
year. Along Jakarta's main street, students strung banners calling 
for ``Human Rights Now.'' Another larger demonstration Wednesday outside 
the attorney general's office involved 1,500 students pressing their 
demands for the arrest of former President Suharto on corruption charges. 
Suharto's autocratic 32-year rule ended with his resignation in May 
after riots in Jakarta and other cities that were set off by unrest 
linked to the Asian economic crisis. Protests by university students 
have become an almost daily occurrence in Jakarta. The demonstrators' 
demands include the arrest of Suharto, his family and close business 
associates on corruption charges, the resignation of Wiranto and a 
speeding up of democratic reforms. The government has begun an investigation 
into Suharto's wealth, and he denies accusations that he illegally 
amassed billions of dollars. The issue of a civilian militia has sparked 
heated debate. Diplomats have expressed concern at the proposal, as 
have human rights groups and opposition lawmakers alarmed that the 
force could be used as vigilantes in support of the governing party. 
Sudarsono said he supported the militia force because election violence 
was inevitable. ``I'm in favor of building up the militia,'' he said. 
``It's the only way to decrease and limit the number of people who 
will be killed in the campaign.'' He said Indonesia's 200,000-member 
police force was not enough to insure law and order during the election 
campaign. This month the government announced that parliamentary elections 
would be held on June 7 and that the top legislative body, the People's 
Consultative Assembly, would convene on Aug. 29 to choose a new president.
