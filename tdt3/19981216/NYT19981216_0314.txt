Imagine, for a moment, that Sam Shepard has a midlife crisis and decides 
that what he really wants to be is a television comedy writer. He 
goes to the Fox Network with the proposition of turning the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning ``Buried Child,'' his demented, Gothic variation on 
the American family drama, into a series. ``Sure,'' the producers 
tell him, eager to be associated with the prestige of Shepard's name. 
``But could you possibly make it a little more like `Family Ties'?'' 
The pilot for such a show might be something like ``Freedomland,'' 
the lively, messy comedy by Amy Freed that opened last night at Playwrights 
Horizons. Like ``Buried Child,'' it is a tale of returning to the 
bile and chaos of the old family homestead. Unlike ``Buried Child,'' 
it is an alarmingly perky play, brimming with whimsy and topical allusions 
as it considers the now classic breed of dysfunctional family produced 
by the wild and crazy parents of the 1960s. The results are as jagged 
as anything in a New York theater. Staged by Howard Shalwitz of the 
Woolly Mammoth Theater Company in Washington, the evening hits peaks 
of go-for-broke humor. But it progresses in fits and starts, and it 
is pervaded with a feeling of trying to be cute, outrageous and socially 
significant all at the same time. Most of the cast members, talented 
actors all, have difficulty in presenting characters that are more 
than an assemblage of spiky eccentricities. ``Freedomland'' provides 
a trove of moments that will make you laugh whenever you remember 
them, but it doesn't achieve the organic flow to carry you through 
its exceedingly wordy duration without checking your watch. ``Freedomland,'' 
commissioned and first produced by the fertile South Coast Repertory 
Co. in Costa Mesa, Calif. (the starting place for the excellent ``Wit'' 
and ``Three Days of Rain''), depicts a donnybrook of an unplanned 
family reunion. It takes place at a rambling upstate New York house, 
designed with perspective-blurring verve by Loy Arcenas. It's the 
home of Noah Underfinger (Dakin Matthews), a retired, spacey professor. 
His first wife walked out on him and the children to become a rail-riding 
hobo, and he now lives with a 50ish, sexually swinging therapist named 
Claude (Robin Strasser). Noah's wool-gathering life is interrupted 
when he finds ``my offspring springing back at me like the jaw of 
a loaded wolf trap.'' And quite a brood they are, all having spent 
their lives trying to compensate for their unmoored childhood in radically 
different ways. There's the tightly wound, judgmental Sig (Veanne 
Cox), a successful painter of sad-eyed circus clowns; the terminally 
unsure Polly (Carrie Preston), a floundering academic who is still 
struggling to complete her doctoral thesis on the women of the ``Iliad,'' 
and the ferociously virile Seth (Jeffrey Donovan), a back-to-nature 
boy with a penchant for blowing up institutional buildings. In tow 
are Seth's companion, Lori (the charming Heather Goldenhersh, who 
brings to mind Meg Tilly in ``The Big Chill''), heavily pregnant with 
a baby by her abusive first husband, and Titus (Jeff Whitty), a young 
and influential art critic writing an article about Sig. The members 
of this dangerously assorted company ride their respective hobby horses 
as furiously as possible in a competition of quirks, recriminations 
and cries for attention. Some of these confrontations are very funny, 
savage, skewed cartoons of familiar family frictions. Noah and Seth 
face off in blustery exchanges of threats that switch abruptly into 
convulsive laughter, something Noah identifies as ``the theater of 
men.'' The sisters bait each other with id-stabbing taunts. (In one 
of the better running jokes, Polly finds the twisted subtext in Sig's 
sentimental paintings.) And Claude keeps trying to open Titus' ``damage 
package'' in ways that involve an antique set of stocks and Oedipal 
role playing. The earth child Lori just can't get anyone to listen 
to her. Ms. Cox, Ms. Preston and Donovan are at their best in their 
high-adrenaline moments. They are far less confident in their quieter 
scenes, just as the play sags when it settles down into more lyrical 
reflections on damaged souls. The work's concluding description of 
a family visit to the amusement park of the title packs none of the 
emotional wallop it has to. Ms. Freed is clearly more at home with 
sound and fury than coherence and contemplation. Ms. Strasser and 
Whitty are indeed amusing in their respective incarnations of sexual 
predator and naive victim. And Matthews is excellent as a restlessly 
aging man with scrambled synapses. You feel that Noah's eccentricities 
have not been thrust upon him but are the organic result of the particular 
life he has lived. The same cannot be said of the other lost souls 
in ``Freedomland.'' PRODUCTION NOTES: `FREEDOMLAND' By Amy Freed;
