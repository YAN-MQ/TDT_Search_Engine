We will have the latest on both stories in tomorrow's program. I'm 
Lisa Mullins in Boston, inviting you to join us again tomorrow for 
another spin of THE WORLD. THE WORLD is a co-production of the BBC 
World Service, Public Radio International, and WGBH Boston, and is 
made possible in part by the PRI Program Fund, whose contributors 
include the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Katherine T. McArthur 
Foundation, the Geraldine Ardage Foundation, and the Charles Stewart 
Mock Foundation. PRI, Public Radio International.
