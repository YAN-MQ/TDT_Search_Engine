In New York, U.S. stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average resumed 
trading today at 8,823 after a healthy 128-point gain Tuesday. That 
was a 1-1/2 percent upsurge, following five straight sessions of losses 
over fourth-quarter corporate earnings and the impeachment process 
involving President Clinton in Washington. Economics Professor Henry 
Romando of Rutgers University says policy not personality will be 
what effects the U.S. market as impeachment is concerned. We basically 
have a Clinton/Gore team that is interchangeable. So, while the market 
is generally going to be nervous by uncertainty, it's going to be 
more driven by what's been the level of retail sales during the holiday 
season, what's the shape of international trade, what's happening 
in the Pacific Rim, what's happening in Brazil, all of these things, 
what's the status of corporate earnings, much more than what happens 
to the Clinton/Gore team because, even if Gore were to assume office, 
the policy would be basically unaffected. So this is big on an economic 
perspective only because the media has amplified its importance.
