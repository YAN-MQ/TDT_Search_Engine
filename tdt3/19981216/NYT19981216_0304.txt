Plans to move Random House to a new office tower in Times Square died 
on Monday after last-minute efforts to revive negotiations with a 
Broadway landlord failed to bring about a deal. Random House and its 
parent company, Bertelsmann AG, are now looking for sites on the Avenue 
of the Americas and on the West Side of Manhattan. The collapse of 
the project in Times Square is a setback for Thomas Middlehoff, the 
new chairman of Bertelsmann, who had hoped to plant the German media 
company's latest acquisition amid the neon bustle on Broadway. The 
development site is across the street from Bertelsmann's 44-story 
North American headquarters, on the east side of Broadway between 
45th and 46th Streets. Middlehoff had flown to New York for a meeting 
last Friday with the landlord, Charles B. Moss Jr., to try to revive 
talks that had gone on for more than six months. Afterward, Bertelsmann 
executives were optimistic. But on Monday, Moss told them it it was 
over. ``It's finished,'' Robert Sorrentino, president of Bertelsmann, 
said yesterday. ``Our discussions have ceased.'' Moss, who lives in 
Aspen, Colo., did not return calls requesting comment. Bertelsmann 
joins a line of unsuccessful suitors for the property on Broadway, 
between 44th and 45th Street. Two developers had wanted to build office 
towers there during the 1980s, but failed to come to terms with Moss. 
Moss bought the property in 1977 for $4 million. His roots in the 
building go back to the 1930s, when his father and grandfather opened 
a movie theater there. Brokers say his blocklong stretch of Broadway 
is among the most valuable parcels in Times Square. Earlier this year, 
Moss began negotiations with Random House and Bertelsmann. Under the 
terms of their tentative deal, Bertelsmann would have paid Moss about 
$92 million to build a 35-story tower on a platform over his existing 
building on Broadway. The deal would have allowed Moss to keep the 
valuable retail space on the first and second floors, as well as the 
billboards and neon signs that festoon the building. With the negotiations 
seemingly headed toward a final agreement in November, Bertelsmann 
hired a construction manager and an architect for the project. City 
officials and most real estate executives considered it a done deal 
that made sense for both sides. But shortly before Thanksgiving, Moss 
balked, fearing that the support columns needed for the platform would 
block out too much of his retail space. People involved in the negotiations 
said Moss demanded more money or fewer columns. Each side accused 
the other of suddenly changing the terms of the deal. Moss has said 
that he can get more than $12 million in net income from the space 
and signs in today's market. Moss, who had issued eviction notices 
to his tenants, which included the Roundabout Theater, has resumed 
talks with potential tenants, including the Rainforest Cafe, real 
estate executives say. C. Bradley Mendelson, a broker with Insignia/ESG 
representing Moss, said he had already received calls from possible 
tenants.
