U.N. weapons inspectors are being evacuated from Baghdad. U.N. humanitarian 
staff members in the Iraqi capital have been also -- have also been 
put on standby for a possible evacuation. The order for evacuation 
followed a report Tuesday from chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard 
Butler that accuses Iraq of failing to cooperate with the inspectors. 
VOA's Max Rustin reports Mr. Butler's assessment could lead to U.S.-led 
air strikes threatened the last time Baghdad balked. Mr. Butler says 
Baghdad's conduct has ensured that no progress was made over the last 
few weeks in the disarmament of Iraq's prohibited weapons program. 
That remark is included in a report prepared by Mr. Butler for U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Security Council. The Security 
Council will use the report as a basis for deciding whether to carry 
out a comprehensive review of the inspection program. Iraq requested 
the review saying it would demonstrate that UNSCOM has failed to recognize 
progress made in the area of disarmament. Mr. Butler's report will 
make it difficult for the Council to approve such a review and could 
open the way for U.S. and British military strikes against Baghdad. 
The Security Council is expected to discuss the report later this 
week. U.S. and British diplomats have made it clear that, if they 
decide that military strikes against Iraq are necessary, they could 
so without first consulting the Security Council. The United States 
and Britain were prepared to carry out such strikes last month but 
canceled them at the last moment after U.N. Secretary-General Annan 
secured a promise of full cooperation from Iraqi leaders. Security 
Council resolutions say UNSCOM must verify that Iraq no longer has 
any weapons of mass destruction before sanctions imposed after the 
Gulf War can be lifted. Iraq wants sanctions lifted immediately. It 
says it has met all Security Council requirements, a claim the Security 
Council says is not true. Some diplomats on the Security Council say 
there is credible evidence that Iraq is intent on hiding key elements 
of its weapons programs. They say, if Iraq does not cooperate with 
UNSCOM, military strikes against Baghdad will be inevitable. Max Rustin,
