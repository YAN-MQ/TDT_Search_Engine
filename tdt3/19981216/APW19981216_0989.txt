A new library dedicated to British and American literature, notably 
works by Beat Generation poets, opened Wednesday in Milan. With Beat 
poet Gregory Corso on hand, Fernanda Pivano unveiled her collection 
of 35,000 volumes and magazines, letters, photographs and unedited 
material. Pivano, 81, became a friend of Ernest Hemingway in 1948 
and eventually translated his work into Italian. In addition to the 
works of Hemingway and the Beat Generation poets, Pivano has translated 
and studied the major works of American literature including Sherwood 
Anderson, William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Thorton Wilder, Richard 
Wright and Gertrude Stein. The library, funded by the Benetton Foundation, 
is open to the public by appointment only. Next year, the library 
will have extended hours and visitors will probably not need appointments.
