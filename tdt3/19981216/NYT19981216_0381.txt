This week, five films that can legitimately be described as British 
will be showing in U.S. theaters. Given the anxiety of holiday marketers, 
that number is in itself an eye-popper. What's more surprising, though, 
is that not one of these British films is about expendable laborers 
trying to salvage self-regard in a renovated upland city, or about 
young professionals contemplating themselves in the sleek surfaces 
of the new London. These films _ ``Elizabeth,'' ``Little Voice,'' 
``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``The General'' and ``The Theory of Flight'' 
_ don't represent anything as grand as the renaissance of a national 
industry that looked so healthy in the 1960s and then again in the 
1980s. The vagaries of multinational financing and staffing make such 
a notion a dated one anyway. But the films' variety _ from sly revisionism 
on the Elizabethan era to speculation about love and Lou Gehrig's 
disease _ is the sign of a heartening creative reawakening. The sort 
of Yank Anglophile who thinks back to classics like ``Room at the 
Top,'' ``Sunday, Bloody Sunday,'' and ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' 
more readily than to television's ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' should 
at least start paying closer attention to the new images of Britain 
that are sneaking now onto movie screens in the United States. Early 
this year, the British cinematic presence here was less distinct, 
and less encouraging. ``Nil by Mouth,'' the actor Gary Oldman's grim 
depiction of his origins amid a working-class mire of violence and 
addiction, was an impressive directorial debut but almost willfully 
incoherent, in structure and dialogue. Mike Leigh's ``Career Girls'' 
had a razor-sharp poignance because Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman 
were so perfectly in form as newly mature women who meet again and 
reflect on their dissolute student days. That movie nevertheless felt 
like a minor chapter in Leigh's admirably idiosyncratic chronicling 
of contemporary, class-skewed England. More to the point, and more 
disturbingly, a film called ``Twenty-four Seven,'' the debut of a 
young director, Shane Meadows, found its way into U.S. release. Set 
in decayed Nottingham, ``Twenty-four Seven'' starred Bob Hoskins as 
an alcoholic who tries to align his own recovery with that of a crew 
of unemployed miscreants by reopening a boxing club. Despite a searing 
performance by Hoskins, the film left the impression that it was simply 
a black-and-white, indie-hip exercise on a socio-cultural theme that 
had recently been more adeptly explored in ``Brassed Off''(out-of-work 
miners maintain their identity through a brass band), ``The Full Monty' 
(out-of-work steelworkers maintain their identity through bump-and-grind 
dancing) and, in its own way, ``Trainspotting'' (out-of-work young 
people maintain their identity through heroin). The implication was 
that the same amusing-but-painful, stiff-upper-lip movie was going 
to be made over and over again until all Britons were somehow integrated 
into the post-industrial economy. Then, in late spring, from across 
the genre spectrum, came ``Sliding Doors'' and ``Shooting Fish.'' 
For all their quirky angles and the charms of Gwyneth Paltrow and 
Kate Beckinsale, respectively, these films implied that the London 
romantic comedy was still following a course set four long years ago 
by ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' It was a relief when ``The Land 
Girls,'' an earnest, well-made drama about the home front during World 
War II, appeared in early summer. ``The Land Girls'' may have been 
predictable, but it was what the British predictably do best: evoking 
that part of the 20th century in which Britain was still arguably 
the center of the world. Earlier this fall, the best British film 
to open in U.S. theaters, ``Velvet Goldmine,'' was actually a U.S. 
film, or, at least, was directed by an American, Todd Haynes. That 
film _ a scary fable about the glam-rock scene in the London of the 
early 70s, starring Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Ewan McGregor, financed 
on both sides of the Atlantic _ represents a good argument for no 
longer even speaking of British film, or American film, or Irish film. 
These days, anyone who, through the good graces of Working Title or 
BBC Films or Miramax, can avoid the Hollywood maw and put together 
a distinctive piece of work occupies creative territory that is, practically 
speaking, just as special as a homeland. ``The General,'' which opened 
on Friday, presents the same argument: although it was directed by 
an eminent Englishman, John Boorman, the movie is, after all, about 
a notorious Irish gangster, Martin Cahill; it was filmed in Dublin, 
and it stars a red-hot Irish actor, Brendan Gleeson. And Boorman himself 
lives in Ireland. That said, ``The General'' does have the feel of 
a film made by a British director. Cahill's brutal story is told almost 
as that of an Everyman, with an odd but effective mix of intimacy 
and restraint; the details of Irish political life are present, certainly, 
but are rendered in a peripheral manner that would be unimaginable 
if the subject matter were in the hands of a romantic, of Irish directors 
like Neil Jordan or Jim Sheridan. ``The General'' is British in the 
sense that it is planted in a tradition that also includes memorable 
works like Karel Reisz's ``Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' (1960) 
and Tony Richardson's ``This Sporting Life'' (1963), which also center 
ambivalently on rogue heroes. The four other British films in U.S. 
theaters now may not be as accomplished as ``The General,'' but they 
perhaps say even more about where one should search hopefully for 
a renewed British cinema. ``Little Voice,'' Mark Herman's adaptation 
of the play about an emotionally damaged young woman with a gift for 
imitating great singers, has some of the same overly melodramatic 
structure of his ``Brassed Off.'' Here, however, there is a range 
of darker, more intricate acting _ especially on the part of Jane 
Horrocks in the title role, Brenda Blethyn as her hysteric mother 
and Michael Caine as a never-has-been promoter _ that tempers Herman's 
sentimentalism, making for a more mature movie. As for approaches 
to Britain's past, it's possible to imagine a stock, pedantic screen 
account of the young Elizabeth I, but Shekhar Kapur's ``Elizabeth'' 
is surely not that. The Protestant-Catholic gamesmanship that surrounded 
her ascendancy is depicted in all its soul-staining terror, and Cate 
Blanchett, although she's as gorgeous as ever, leads the way in working 
against any notion that beauty and truth and goodness were the order 
of the day. As for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' no one will accuse John 
Madden of not venturing from the traditional approach to a British 
icon that he took to such fine effect last year in ``Mrs. Brown.'' 
If there is still such a thing as British film, then one of the primary 
things going for it is a large pool of extraordinary actors _ if they 
can be persuaded to touch base between more lucrative Hollywood sojourns 
for long enough to make movies. In that regard, ``The Theory of Flight,'' 
which opens on Wednesday, is greatly encouraging. It's a small, eccentric 
film but boasts two big, talented stars, Helena Bonham Carter and 
Kenneth Branagh, who clearly relish art as much as opportunity. As 
flawed as the film may be _ and the metaphor-heavy attempt by a troubled 
artist (Branagh) to build a flying machine gets a bit much _ Ms. Bonham 
Carter, who plays a victim of Lou Gehrig's disease, offers up ample 
revelatory moments. Her performance is a reminder that a British film 
is often the occasion for an acting accomplishment that's larger than 
the movie itself; Robert Carlyle's powerful presence in Michael Winterbottom's 
``Go Now'' is another example from the last year. Flight imagery abounds 
in the current crop of British films _ in ``The General'' and ``Little 
Voice,'' pet homing pigeons carry the burden _ and in this context, 
the irony is obvious. British cinema has always had trouble keeping 
its best directors from flying the coop _ or, more accurately, has 
had trouble persuading them to persuade Hollywood that the coop's 
an interesting spot to revisit, as their Irish counterparts have managed 
to do with movies like ``The Boxer.'' One of Britain's best directors, 
Stephen Frears, had a movie open on Friday. It's called ``The Hi-Lo 
Country,'' and the title refers to New Mexico, not the Lake District. 
Perhaps the best wish that one could make for British film is that 
Frears turn back to another film based on a Roddy Doyle novel, or 
that Mike Newell return home from ``Donnie Brasco'' and ``Pushing 
Tin,'' his forthcoming movie about U.S. air-traffic control. On the 
other hand, who needs them? There's a lot to be said for simply looking 
forward to January and Ken Loach's ``My Name Is Joe.''
