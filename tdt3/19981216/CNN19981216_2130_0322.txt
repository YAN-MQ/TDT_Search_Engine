Weapons inspectors who evacuated Iraq have arrived in Bahrain. Chief 
inspector Richard Butler says he ordered his team out of Iraq because 
they were unable to do their job properly. Butler submitted a report 
to U.N. secretary general Kofi Annan last night that details examples 
of noncooperation. Butler says Hussein broke the promises he made 
last month after Iraq was threatened with air strikes. A month ago, 
there was a crisis in which military action was contemplated. Iraq 
made promises to the security council to prevent that from happening, 
promises of full cooperation. I was then given the job of testing 
that and reporting to the council whether or not their cooperation 
had been given. I regret that I had to report the facts yesterday, 
which is that it had not been given and that we can't adequately do 
our job under these circumstances. It made logical sense, therefore, 
to pull our people out, and we'll see where this goes in the future.
