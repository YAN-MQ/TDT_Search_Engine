Like their women teammates the previous day, South Korea's men swept 
the top three places in individual archery competition at the Asian 
Games Wednesday. Japan's Wataru Haraguchi took the bronze medal, however, 
under rules limiting one country to two medals in any one event. Korea's 
Han Seung-hoon beat teammate Kim Kyung-ho 113-112 in the final for 
the gold medal. Korean Oh Kyo-moon, the 1997 Asian champion, beat 
Japan's Wataru Haraguchi 116-109 in the bronze medal shootoff, but 
couldn't keep the medal under the rules. When South Korean Kim Jo-sun 
led a 1-2-3 sweep Tuesday, China's Lin Sang was given the bronze.
