Good evening everybody. We begin our broadcast tonight in the middle 
of the very fluid situation with the president on the verge of being 
impeached probably before the House of Representatives of Washington 
and the United States very much in the middle of what President Clinton 
said a few minutes ago was a series of sustained attacks against Iraq. 
Let's go first to the night sky in Baghdad where every so often this 
is exactly what you see and hear. Our correspondent there, Bill Blakemore 
is on the roof of the information ministry in downtown Baghdad. It's 
been sporadically quiet and noisy. Do you have any sense of what's 
going on at the moment? Just now there's another attack that started. 
It's more than two hours since the attacks started here on Baghdad. 
There have been long lulls in which we've heard muffled explosions 
out on the edge of town. Every now and then it breaks loose right 
here around us. We saw a couple of explosions maybe less than a mile 
away from the information ministry. Just moments ago. You can hear 
those explosions I'm sure. We're still seeing a great deal of anti-aircraft 
fire going up. Now again it's quiet. This is tack has been going on 
intensely at times and in between with these lulls, it's hard to tell 
what's being hit. As you can see, the city is not blacked out. There 
are obviously explosions over on the south side of the city, the direction 
where generally pointing here, from the roof of the ministry. There 
are very few cars left in the street. It's been a very tense day here 
with people realizing there would be an attack tonight. Now we can 
see more of the anti-aircraft fire going off over head. Let's stay 
with that night sky for a moment.
