The touch, the feel of grass could be the fabric of some Belgians' 
lives. A flower sculptor near Brussels has created skirts, blouses 
and dresses made out of living grass. But the high-maintenance clothing 
must be watered once a day, or the grass will die. And it may need 
to be mowed every other week. The designer is also planning to make 
a grass wedding dress, complete with live Flowers.
