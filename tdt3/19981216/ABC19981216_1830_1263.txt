May irritate your stomach, while others won't? no. I just know aspirin 
can do that sometimes. Different kind of medicine? Good guess. There 
are two kinds of over-the-counter pain relievers. One type is called 
NSAIDs, which include aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium-- to name 
a few. And every single nsaid, to varying degrees, including even 
ibuprofen, can sometimes irritate your stomach... by interfering with 
the production of the substance... that lines and protects the stomach. 
And surprisingly, this irritation can occur at the stomach lining... 
without you even feeling it. The other type of pain reliever is the 
medicine in Tylenol. Tylenol won't irritate your stomach the way NSAIDs, 
like aspirin or even ibuprofen, sometimes can. That's one reason why 
doctors recommend it most. So take care of your pain, and take care 
of your stomach. Tylenol house call is brought to you... - but mom, 
I don't want to take him with me. - Mm-hmm. You don't know, mom. La 
time, he got stuck in a tree. It was almost on TV. Sometimes moms 
need a little help getting kids to do the right thing. - He gets two? 
- fortunately, there's sunny delight. - Kids love that great sunny 
D taste. - mmm. You love the vitamins. Let's go. Come on, shorty. 
yeah. Mr. shorty to you. Reach for the good stuff. Reach for the sun.
