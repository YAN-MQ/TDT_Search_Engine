President Clinton says he believes his trip to the Middle East has 
helped the cause of peace. Mr. Clinton returned to the United States 
Tuesday night after another meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu and Palestinian authority President Yasser Arafat. Although 
Israel is delaying the next phase of West Bank troop withdrawals, 
President Clinton said the administration will just "keep working" 
to make sure things move forward. He's also commending the Palestine 
national council's move to abolish clauses in the PLO charter calling 
for Israel's destruction. One sticking point is the Israeli release 
of Palestinian prisoners. On the prisoners -- they merely must comply 
with what we agreed at wye. We said at wye that we would release prisoners 
but never, ever agreed, as the Americans will attest, never agreed 
to the release of murderers and people with blood on their hands. 
The Palestinians cannot resort to violence to try to achieve by force 
of arms what was not achieved at the negotiating table. President 
Clinton says another meeting has been scheduled to search for a Resolution.
