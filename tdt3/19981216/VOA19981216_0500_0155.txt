President Clinton has returned from the Middle East after failing 
to persuade Israel to pull back more West Bank troops on Friday as 
called for by the Wye River peace accord. Early Tuesday, President 
Clinton held three-way talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. Later, the president 
said Mr. Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel's obligation to complete troop 
withdrawals called for by the Wye River accord.
