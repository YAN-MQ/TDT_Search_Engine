Palestinians said Wednesday they will stick to their Wye River accord 
commitments, despite an Israeli freeze on the process _ an apparent 
effort to cultivate the U.S.-Palestinian friendship that blossomed 
during this week's Clinton visit. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu promised Wednesday to go to early elections if he is unable 
to get support in parliament for his peace policies by early next 
week. That raised the prospect of a further delay in implementing 
the agreement brokered by Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October. 
Netanyahu had earlier briefed his Cabinet on U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a day earlier 
_ that he would not withdraw troops on Friday, as required by the 
Wye accord. The prime minister says he wants solid evidence that the 
Palestinians are fulfilling their commitment to contain anti-Israel 
violence and to round up illegal weapons. The Palestinians want quid-pro-quo 
for acceding on Monday to the Israeli demand that the Palestine National 
Council convene and renounce clauses in its charter calling for Israel's 
destruction. Clinton attended that meeting. Palestinian officials 
said Netanyahu's actions brought his commitment to the peace process 
into question. ``It shows that the Israeli government doesn't believe 
in peace, and this is what we are seeing on the ground,'' said Mahmoud 
Abbas, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy. Still, Palestinians 
remained committed to the process, and would continue to fulfill its 
requirements. ``We shall continue to carry out our commitments and 
we shall push ... for full implementation from Israel,'' said Nabil 
Shaath, a top Palestinian negotiator returning with Arafat from Egypt, 
where the Palestinian leader briefed President Hosni Mubarak on the 
Clinton visit. Shaath even indicated that the Palestinians were willing 
to consider a post-Wye demand from Netanyahu that Arafat back off 
a promise to declare statehood by May. The declaration would come 
only if Israel delays agreements, he said. Despite his denials, Israelis 
and Palestinians saw Clinton's tour of Gaza as conferring tacit approval 
of Palestinian statehood. Clinton also moved Palestinians in his speeches 
when he expressed understanding at the pain that resulted from years 
of dislocation and occupation. ``The United States has taken long 
strives toward neutrality and a lack of bias regarding Palestinians 
and Israelis,'' Mahmoud Abbas told Voice of Palestine radio. Arafat 
could not resist intimating his new-found closeness to Clinton when 
he was asked to react to Netanyahu's freeze on troop withdrawal. ``I 
don't think that the American administration and President Clinton 
will agree to this,'' he said _ a speculation unimaginable just a 
month ago. Netanyahu faces defections from doves who want him to press 
ahead with Wye and hard-liners who balk at any further concessions 
to the Palestinians. A senior Netanyahu aide, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said that if Netanyahu calls for elections, he will 
suspend implementation of the Wye accord until after the elections, 
which would be months away. Chief Palestinian negotiatior Saeb Erekat 
said that such a freeze would have ``very dangerous effects on the 
peace process.'' Palestinians said it was increasingly difficult to 
work with a weakened government. ``All the talk by Israeli officials 
about security is not the security of the Israeli people, but the 
security of keeping their seats in the government,'' said Gaza security 
chief Mohammmed Dahlan. The Clinton asministration also appeared frustrated 
with the Israeli prime minister's apparent obsession with domestic 
worries. ``It would be unfortunate if there were a delay in the timetable,'' 
State Department spokesman James Rubin said in Washington. ``and we 
want the further redeployment to occur as soon as possible.''
