A girl in Georgia is breaking barriers. Brian Cabell reports, she's 
getting a "kick" out of life on the gridiron. High school playoff 
football at the Georgia dome. It's do or die for the Riverdale raiders, 
including number 15, the player with the long hair and the short stature. 
She's Tanya Butler, Riverdale's placekicker, one of the few female 
football players in the country, one of the reasons Riverdale is unbeaten 
going into this semifinal game. They score, and she kicks the point 
after touchdown, 7-0. They score again. She splits the uprights again. 
She's Ms. automatic. Good job. Come on! This year, Tanya kicked 64 
of 65 extra points. For her varsity career, she kicked 19 field goals 
in 32 attempts, her longest from 39 yards. But she can hit from 45 
yards, she says. Oh, yeah, definitely. It's just -- it kind of gets 
in my head a little bit, and I try to, like, nail it. And it doesn't 
work sometimes. It's worked often enough that she's won the confidence 
of her male teammates. I mean, it's a sport. Anybody can play a sport. 
So if she can play, she can play. Out of uniform, she hardly looks 
like a jock -- 5'6", 130 pounds. A solid student, she's hoping a small 
college football coach will come calling with a scholarship. Everybody 
is sort of looking out of the side of their eye. And they're waiting 
to see how she finishes up this year. And I really think somebody's 
gonna take a chance on her. Riverdale's fortunes in the state semifinal 
game suddenly turned. Riverdale now leads its opponent, peach county, 
only 14-10. Defense! Defense! But the defense can't hold. Peach county 
scores, goes up 17-14. One final chance for Riverdale and Tanya, in 
what may be the final game of her career. Maybe, just maybe, she'll 
get a chance to score the tying field goal. Yeah, I'm ready. I'm getting 
ready. I just wish we'd get in field goal range. Riverdale is on the 
move, but time is running out. And then disaster -- a quarterback 
sack. The game is over, and with it, maybe the career of Tanya Butler. 
She called football, that rough and tumble game, "precious." Now, 
in these final moments at the Georgia dome, she realizes it more than 
ever. Brian Cabell, CNN, Atlanta.
