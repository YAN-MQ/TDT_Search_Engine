The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 17: Police 
Commissioner Howard Safir's proposal to collect DNA samples from anyone 
arrested in New York City is a threat to personal privacy that is 
unnecessary for fighting crime. Safir says the DNA record would be 
expunged if there is no conviction, but minor offenders such as turnstile 
jumpers and protesters engaged in acts of civil disobedience would 
have their DNA record entered into a state data bank. Safir and Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani argue that DNA sampling, done by collecting saliva, 
is equivalent to taking fingerprints. But there is a huge difference. 
Fingerprints cannot be used for any purpose other than identification. 
DNA samples provide the government extraordinary amounts of personal 
genetic information that could be misused. Critics worry, for example, 
that such data could leak into the hands of insurance companies to 
identify those at risk for genetic diseases. Under current law, the 
state already collects DNA samples from people who have been convicted 
of certain major crimes such as rape and homicide. Prosecutors can 
also get a court order to take blood and DNA samples if they have 
probable cause to target an individual in an investigation. As it 
is, the police crime labs have not had the capacity to test all DNA 
samples collected at the scenes of unsolved crimes. Evidence has been 
routinely thrown out after five years without being tested at all. 
If the department wants to do more with DNA testing, it should start 
by testing the samples it has. Giuliani has given civil libertarians 
even more reason for concern. Wednesday he indicated he would not 
oppose DNA testing and fingerprinting on all newborns _ a bold privacy 
invasion at birth rather than arrest. He also suggested that DNA collected 
by the police could be used to establish paternity and increase child 
support payments in the city. But using DNA information that way has 
nothing to do with solving crimes, the reason for which the DNA supposedly 
would be collected. Any such change would require approval from the 
state legislature, where Democratic lawmakers have criticized these 
ideas. Some days it seems the mayor, who says he champions civility, 
thinks it can only be achieved by police surveillance.
