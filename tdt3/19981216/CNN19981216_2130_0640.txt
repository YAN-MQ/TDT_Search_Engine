Scientists are hoping an asteroid will clue them in about early life 
on earth and teach them how to protect the planet from other asteroids 
hurtling our way. Anne Kellan has details, in this edition of "tech 
trends." a NASA spacecraft is about to begin the first closeup study 
of an asteroid in orbit. The probe is called N.E.A.R. -- short for 
"near earth asteroid rendezvous" -- And its target is the asteroid, 
433 eros, an irregular-shaped lump of rock 24 miles long that's hurtling 
through space about 250 million miles from earth. On January 10th, 
N.E.A.R. will go into orbit around eros and start a Gradual descent 
toward the surface, taking pictures and readings as it goes. There 
are several reasons for wanting to learn more about asteroids. Asteroids 
are samples of the material from which the planets formed, and the 
asteroids also tell us about the earliest stages of planetary evolution. 
To understand our own origins, the origin of earth and the origin 
of life on the earth, we must unlock the secrets of asteroids and 
comets. They also hit earth every now and then. And understanding 
their composition might help scientists deflect or destroy one headed 
towards earth. And asteroids could be a source of minerals or water 
to be tapped by future space explorers. We have engines started. We 
have ignition. We have liftoff of the Delta rocket carrying the N.E.A.R. 
spacecraft. N.E.A.R. started its journey to eros almost three years 
ago. Scientists hope to find out how dense the asteroid is. That will 
give them a pretty good idea whether it's solid rock or made of smaller 
pieces stuck together. They'll also be looking to see what minerals 
are on the surface of eros. After almost a year of gathering scientific 
data, N.E.A.R. may try something more risky -- hovering very close 
to the asteroid or even touching down gently on its surface. Ann Kellan,
