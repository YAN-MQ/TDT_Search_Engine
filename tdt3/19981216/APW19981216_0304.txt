Bahrain's emir revealed plans Wednesday plans to appoint more citizens 
to his advisory council, a step toward broadening the base of the 
decision-making process. The move comes after four years of sporadic 
political violence in the tiny island state, which has no parliament. 
``There are now plans to expand the composition of the (Consultative) 
Council and increase its scope so that it could play a bigger role 
in national decision making,'' the emir, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, 
said in an interview published in government-controlled newspapers 
on Wednesday _ Bahrain's national day. ``This expansion would involve 
representatives of various social and productive groups who would 
help achieve the civilized progress which Bahrain was aiming for,'' 
Sheik Isa said. The emir did not say how many more people would appointed 
to the council, nor did he reveal how its role would be enhanced. 
The Consultative Council has 40 members, who make recommendations 
on policy and laws, but have no legislative power. The newspapers 
reported that the emir had also pardoned a number of prisoners, but 
gave no details. Officials could not be reached for comment. The government 
has been hard-pressed to control the political unrest that broke out 
in December 1994 when pro-democracy activists clashed with security 
forces in the streets. More than 40 people have been killed in the 
violence, which has included bombings and arson attacks. Hundreds 
of people have been imprisoned, with many activists receiving sentences 
ranging from a year to life imprisonment. The government has accused 
the opposition of using the call for political freedom as a cover-up 
for a conspiracy, instigated by Iran, to set up a Shiite Islamic state 
in Bahrain. Iran, which is overwhelmingly Shiite, had denied the charge. 
A slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens are Shiites, but the 
ruling family and government are dominated by members of the mainstream 
Sunni Islamic sect.
