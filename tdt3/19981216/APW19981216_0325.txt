Outraged by the dumping of 3,000 tons of waste near a coastal town, 
Cambodia's environment minister said Wednesday it will be shipped 
back to Taiwan and the local company responsible for importing it 
will be heavily fined. He added that the material might be toxic. 
The waste _ a jumble of rubble and dirt _ was found last week on the 
outskirts of Sihanoukville, 185 km (115 miles) southwest of Phnom 
Penh. According to a customs invoice it was shipped from Taiwan last 
month by a local company. The shipment is described as construction 
waste on the invoice, but environment officials fear the material 
is incinerated toxic waste and may contain heavy metals or chemicals 
hazardous to human health. The Cambodian company who imported the 
material was not named, but has apparently taken on work banned by 
the government. Cambodia's government has been approached several 
times by companies interested in disposing industrial waste, including 
one proposal for the construction of a sophisticated waste incineration 
plant in the country. Mok Mareth, who took a jab at rich industrialized 
nations in his televised statement, has repeatedly said the government 
will turn down any waste-related business proposals. ``Industrialized 
nations have difficulties finding space within their countries to 
discard toxic waste, that's why they dump it in poor countries. Cambodia 
is well aware about that and cannot let this happen on a whim,'' he 
said. Mok Mareth announced on national television that Deputy Prime 
Minister Sar Kheng has ordered the creation of a government commission 
to investigate the dumping. The minister said those found responsible 
for the dumping face fines of millions of dollars for environmental 
destruction and will be forced to pay compensation to anyone living 
in the area whose health is affected by the mess. Whether the material 
is found to be toxic or not, Mok Mareth said the waste will be shipped 
back to Taiwan. ``As a lesson for waste exporters it must be cleaned 
up and transported back, regardless of whether it is toxic or nontoxic,'' 
he said. A chemical expert from Singapore's environmental protection 
agency examined the site Tuesday and samples of the waste were flown 
to Hong Kong on Wednesday for analysis, Mok Mareth told The Associated 
Press.
