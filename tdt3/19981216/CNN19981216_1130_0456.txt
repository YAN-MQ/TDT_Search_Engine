I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
The cold air beginning to filter in through the upper midwest, where 
it will be below freezing for high temperatures today. It is still 
mild, though, along the gulf coast. Much of the southeast into the 
60s. And Santa Ana winds in southern California will again push temperatures 
into the 80s. Windy in the southwest, as the high pressure area builds 
in. That coupled with an area of low pressure in northern Mexico will 
produce the gusty winds. Look for a little bit of snow back through 
the Great Lakes, pushing in towards the northeast later on tomorrow. 
And another system dropping out of Canada will produce some snow as 
well through the upper midwest by late tomorrow. We check now the 
extended forecast. It is going to turn colder beginning on Friday 
through the upper midwest. We'll find some snow showers likely through 
the Great Lakes and windy conditions in through the northern Rockies. 
Colder air really moving in on Saturday into Montana, in through the 
dakotas with single-digit high temperature readings, and snow and 
windy conditions accompanying the cold air. And by Sunday, very cold, 
Arctic air will begin to work its way into the northern midwest. For
