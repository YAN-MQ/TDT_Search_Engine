In its third acquisition to be announced this week, Quintiles Transnational 
Corp., the nation's largest provider of clinical drug trials, said 
Wednesday it would buy Envoy Corp. for $1.7 billion in stock. Quintiles, 
based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., has made several acquisitions 
this year to broaden its range of pharmaceutical services. Aside from 
conducting clinical trials, the company has become a leading industry 
provider of sales support and marketing information. By acquiring 
Envoy, a health-claims processing company in Nashville, Quintiles 
will be able to expand its marketing base for prescription drugs. 
Envoy is expected to process 1.2 billion claims this year from doctors, 
pharmacies, hospitals and health maintenance organizations. ``This 
purchase gives us a lot of information,'' said Dennis Gillings, the 
chief executive of Quintiles. ``We don't compete now with IMS Health,'' 
a company that measures pharmaceutical sales trends, he added. ``But 
this purchase will enable us to deliver more real-time data than they 
do currently.'' Analysts considered the deal fairly priced. Quintiles 
will exchange 1.166 of its shares for each envoy share, valuing Envoy 
stock at $65.51 a share, a 55 percent premium based on Tuesday's closing 
prices. The deal may be terminated, though, if shares of Quintiles 
trade beyond a range of $40 to $71.50. Investors had mixed reactions 
to the deal. Shares of Envoy rose 18.9 percent, or $8, to $50.25. 
Quintiles' shares fell 18.4 percent, or $10.3125, to $45.875. The 
selloff in Quintiles' stock surprised Gillings and some analysts. 
``Investors may have walked because that was Quintiles' third deal 
in a week,'' said Kenneth Miller, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; 
Quist. ``They believe the company has bitten off more than it can 
chew. People may also assume that the deal means there is a problem 
in the company's core business.'' On Monday, Quintiles said it would 
acquire a drug-development center in Missouri from Hoechst A.G. for 
$93 million in cash. On Tuesday, the company said it would buy Pharmaceutical 
Marketing Services, including its Scott-Levin drug-marketing unit, 
for $197 million in stock. Analysts and investors were also concerned 
that Quintiles might not meet earnings projections for next year. 
Quintiles is expected to earn $1.37 to $1.40 a share next year, according 
to Zacks Investment Research. Though company executives said Wednesday 
that earnings would meet expectations, analysts had thought the company 
would easily surpass them. ``Some investors may not have known what 
to make of this deal,'' Gillings said. ``In one sense, it may have 
looked like Envoy and Quintiles didn't know much about each other. 
That may have forced these people to spend the day scratching their 
heads trying to figure it out.'' While the Quintiles expansion plan 
is aggressive _ the company has made more than a dozen acquisitions 
this year _ analysts have generally applauded it. Gillings has moved 
into contract sales _ renting the services of Quintiles salespeople 
to sell products for other companies _ and marketing information, 
a crucial commodity as more drug companies advertise directly to consumers.
