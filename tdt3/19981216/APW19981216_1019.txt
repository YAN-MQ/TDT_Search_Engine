Thousands of Serbs, many weeping, gathered today to mourn six slain 
countrymen whose deaths have inflamed tensions in the separatist province 
of Kosovo. A crowd of 5,000 assembled in the western city of Pec, 
where unknown assailants on Monday opened fire in a Serb-run bar. 
Another 2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended a protest rally today in the 
provincial capital of Pristina. Despite fears of unrest, the gatherings 
were peaceful, with four busloads of Serb police providing security 
in Pec. International monitors were not in evidence, a day after some 
Serbs took out their anger at the killings by hurling stones or spitting 
at armored U.S. observer vehicles. As mourners sobbed, the six coffins 
were brought to Pec's main square and covered with wreaths. The victims 
were buried later in the day. ``Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' 
said Mirko Simonovic, principal of the high school where four of the 
dead were students. ``They were killed for the simple reason of being 
Serbs.'' He concluded with a demand that the state ``punish the perpetrators 
and do away forever with Albanian terrorism.'' Serbs blame ethnic 
Albanian rebels for the killings, which have prompted protests and 
threats of retaliation. Many fear the killings, along with a border 
clash this week between the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian rebels 
that killed at least 36 rebels, move Kosovo closer to a renewal of 
war. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, 
a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. Voicing concern 
at the dangerous turn of events, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke condemned 
the deaths as ``appalling beyond words.'' Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic renewed his determination to suppress rebel ``terrorism.'' 
A top government body for the Serbian province said the Serb killings 
were ``the most monstrous crime in the series of assaults by Albanian 
terrorist gangs.'' Holbrooke, who brokered an agreement in October 
that halted more than seven months of combat in Kosovo, appeared pessimistic 
about reaching a political settlement that could stop the carnage. 
After more than five hours of talks with Milosevic in Belgrade, Holbrooke 
acknowledged Tuesday night that diplomats are nowhere near bridging 
the huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethic Albanians on the 
province's status. Pec, 45 miles west of Pristina, is Kosovo's third-largest 
city with about 150,000 residents. Like Kosovo itself, the population 
is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian, but several thousand Serbs also 
live there. Towns and cities have mostly escaped the violence that 
has engulfed Kosovo villages this year since the Serb assault on militant 
separatists that began in February. More than 1,000 people have been 
killed and 300,000 forced from their homes.
