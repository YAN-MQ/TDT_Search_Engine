Palestinians said Wednesday they will stick to their Wye River accord 
commitments, despite an Israeli freeze on the process _ an apparent 
effort to cultivate the U.S.-Palestinian friendship that blossomed 
during this week's Clinton visit. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
on Wednesday morning briefed his Cabinet on U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a day earlier 
_ that he would not withdraw troops on Friday, as required by the 
Wye accord.
