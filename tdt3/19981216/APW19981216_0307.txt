In a stunning upset, South Korea's Kim Taek-soo beat China's Liu Guoliang 
for Asian Games gold in men's singles table tennis Wednesday, dashing 
Chinese hopes of their first gold medal sweep in 20 years. Kim, the 
world No. 11, jumped into the air and then into the arms of his coach 
after his 21-16, 21-14, 22-20 victory over Liu, the world No. 2. ``I 
am the champion,'' the elated, sweat-drenched 28-year-old said. Following 
a victory earlier in the day in the women's doubles, China had gone 
into the match with six of the seven golds. A win by Liu, the Olympic 
singles and doubles champion, would have given China its first sweep 
of all the medals since 1978, when the games were also held in Bangkok. 
But Kim was all focus and drive, pumping his fist into the air after 
winning points and pacing around his end of the table like a caged 
animal. ``It was very important to fight because the Chinese are very 
strong,'' said Kim, who won an Olympic bronze in 1992. ``I believed 
in myself.'' But the Chinese were able to take consolation in their 
women, who swept all their gold medals, putting a victorious stamp 
on a transition to a new generation of players following the withdrawal 
of team veterans. Wang Nan, a 20-year-old from northeast Liaoning 
province, was the star of the Chinese women, taking four golds. Her 
last came in doubles, which she and Li Ju won Wednesday against a 
Hong Kong pair. Hong Kong's Chan Tan-lui and Song Ah-sim had beaten 
a strong South Korean team in the semis but were completely outclassed 
by the Chinese in the final, going down 21-7, 21-8. China came to 
Bangkok with a team of mostly young players, missing stars including 
Wang Tao and Deng Yaping, a three-time world singles champion who 
also won doubles and singles at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics. Wang said 
the team's victories in Bangkok showed that China was succeeding in 
making the transition to a new generation. ``I don't dare say that 
I'll take Deng Yaping's place because she was the best player in the 
world,'' Wang said. ``But I'll gradually get closer to her.'' Wang's 
other golds came in the singles, mixed doubles and team. Wang, now 
No. 3, said she believed her victories could give her enough points 
to move to the top spot in the world rankings. Despite missing out 
on a sweep, Chinese coach Lu Yuansheng said the six golds would boost 
his team's confidence. ``Through this competition young players have 
trained, they've become more mature,'' he said. ``We want the generations 
to follow one after the other.''
