In Mexico, several hundred protesters entered the National Congress 
Tuesday, disrupting the session and fighting with police sent to impede 
them. As VOA's Greg Flakus reports from Mexico City, the demonstrations 
are the result of tough decisions being taken by legislators to finalize 
a budget for 1999. Riot police moved in quickly to stop the entry 
of the protesters, but several managed to enter the Chamber of Deputies 
anyway, provoking the temporary closure of the session. It was the 
third such incident of the Congress in four days. Some of the protesters 
came from a Mexico City community with grievances against the government, 
and some represented a teachers' union. The focus of the demonstrators 
has been proposed tax increases and the elimination of some subsidies, 
actions the government says are necessary to balance the budget now 
that oil prices have fallen to their lowest level in two decades. 
Mexico's government relies on sales from the state-owned oil company 
for about one-third of its annual expenditures. At a separate venue, 
President Ernesto Zedillo praised the work of the Congress and called 
on the legislators to continue work on fiscal reform. Mr. Zedillo 
said that unless Mexico finds a way to increase its revenue and balance 
its budget, the nation will run the risk of another economic crisis 
with high inflation, a lack of investment, and high unemployment. 
One of the most controversial parts of the budget under consideration 
at the moment is a 15-percent excise tax on telephone calls, which 
is opposed by both major opposition parties. Over the weekend, a compromise 
between the ruling party and the National Action Party led to the 
resolution of one other major problem, a $67-billion bank bailout 
program which will now be managed by a new banking institute. The 
work on the budget was supposed to have concluded on Tuesday, but 
because of the discord over the tax increases and the disruptions 
by protesters, the sessions have been extended. Legislators know hope 
to finalize the budget sometime before Christmas. Greg Flakus, VOA 
News, Mexico City.
