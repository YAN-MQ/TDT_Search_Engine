The U.S. space shuttle "Endeavour" is back on earth after wrapping 
up a 12-day mission. The main achievement of the flight was the assembly 
of the first block of the international space station which will serve 
as a research laboratory for 16 nations. The space station partners 
will spend the next five years completing the project which will require 
dozens of additional space flights.
