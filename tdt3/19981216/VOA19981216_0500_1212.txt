After an emergency meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, Asian football officials 
are putting a threatened boycott of the 2002 World Cup on hold, but 
the Asian Football Confederation's executive committee warned Tuesday 
that the boycott will proceed unless football's world governing body, 
FEFA, expands the number of slots allocated to Asia for the World 
Cup. The committee also decided that if the boycott moves ahead, co-hosts 
Japan and South Korea will be exempt.
