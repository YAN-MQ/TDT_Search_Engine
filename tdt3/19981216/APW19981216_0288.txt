STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ BMW's British unit Rover Group Ltd., which 
saw 2,500 job cuts this year, may face the same amount of layoffs 
in 1999, BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder said. ``In 1999 there could 
again be 2,500 fewer positions at Rover,'' he said at a journalists 
club meeting late Tuesday. At the beginning of 1998, Rover had a work 
force of 40,000, he noted. He also warned that Rover's fleet management 
business poses a depreciation risk for the BMW group, citing a more 
than 15 percent drop in used car prices in Britain over the past six 
months. BMW's Rover provides automobiles to rental companies that 
it agrees to buy back after a certain period at a previously agreed 
price. It then sells them as used cars. His statements mark the first 
time that BMW was outspoken about possible rental contract losses, 
which analysts say might require a provision of between 200 million 
and 250 million marks (dlrs 120 million and dlrs 150 million) this 
year.
