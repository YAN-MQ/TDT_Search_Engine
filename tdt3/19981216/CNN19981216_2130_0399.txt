Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met with his revolutionary command 
council today. In a statement tonight, he said several targets were 
hit in Iraq, and called Britain and the United States "cowards" for 
using long-range missiles in the attack. The Iraqi leader also urged 
Iraqis to fight the enemies of God.
