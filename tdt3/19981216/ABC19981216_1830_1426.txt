From the moment Dolly the sheep debuted everyone knew this moment 
was coming. Scientists in south Korea today said they created a human 
clone, the early stages of one anyway. There is some question about 
whether this happened, as well as a loud outcry for even making the 
effort. Here's ABC's Ned Potter. Outside the hospital in Seoul, a 
line of demonstrators had already formed saying, "I don't want to 
be copied." Inside, researchers said they had only grown the embryo 
to the size of four cells before stopping. But they said the embryo 
was human, and if that's true, it's something no one has admitted 
before. Our primary interest, says the lead researcher, is not cloning 
human beings but doing further research into cloning organs. The scientists 
who created Dolly the sheep said the Korean experiment demonstrates 
nothing. There's no proof the embryo could have grown larger. But 
others are not so sure. Less than two years since Dolly's birth was 
announced and there's the report of a cloned human embryo, that's 
one step away from a cloned child. Biologists say we've made more 
of an ethical than a scientific leap, because a doctor somewhere may 
now start human cloning while everyone else is still wondering if 
it's wise to try. Ned Potter, ABC News, New York.
