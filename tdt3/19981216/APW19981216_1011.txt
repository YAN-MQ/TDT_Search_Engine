The United Nations on Wednesday appealed for dlrs 1.3 billion to feed 
and care for refugees and hungry people in some of the world's hardest-hit 
countries from Congo to North Korea. The global appeal by U.N. agencies 
was aimed at combating ``donor fatigue'' in wealthier nations increasingly 
tired of apparently never-ending conflicts and man-made disasters. 
An appeal for Sudan, which has yet to be finalized, is expected to 
bring the total appeal for next year to dlrs 1.5 billion. Last year 
U.N. agencies appealed separately for a total of dlrs 2.2 billion, 
but less than half of that came in. This year's figure ``is roughly 
equivalent to a half day's total military expenditure but will serve 
to protect some 25 million people from starvation or disease,'' said 
Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N.'s emergency relief coordinator. The 
largest single appeals were for famine-stricken North Korea _ dlrs 
376 million _ and the countries of the former Yugoslavia _ some dlrs 
359 million. Many of the other nations are in Africa: Congo, Uganda, 
Burundi, Somalia, Tanzania, Angola, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. 
The poor response previously was partly due to the way the appeals 
were presented, Vieira said. ``Weariness on the part of donors in 
the face of conflicts which go on from one year to the next, and I 
think the example of Sudan is possibly the most scandalous, is also 
a phenomenon we must try to understand,'' Vieira said. Since 1983 
more than 1.5 million people have died in fighting between rebels 
and government forces and resulting famines in southern Sudan. An 
estimated 4 million Sudanese have been displaced. This year's appeal 
for Sudan brought one of the best responses _ over 80 percent _ but 
Vieira contended that, with dlrs 1 million a day being spent on airlifts, 
``donors can't carry on paying such bills.'' An appeal for the Yugoslav 
province of Kosovo was also three-quarters covered. But the picture 
was less rosy elsewhere. This year's appeal for Tajikistan, for example, 
brought in less than 30 percent of the dlrs 34.6 million sought, Vieira 
said.
