Hearing Handel's ``Messiah'' at St. Thomas Church on Tuesday evening, 
sung with a combination of devotional serenity and fervor by a red-robed 
choir of men and boys arrayed before a vast wall of carved saints, 
a listener could easily mistake the work for an official part of the 
Episcopal Christmas liturgy. Its libretto, fashioned from biblical 
excerpts, begins with prophecy from Isaiah, traces the sweep of Jesus' 
life, and ends with doctrinal thoughts on redemption. And parts of 
the music _ the choruses ``Since by Man Came Death'' and ``Worthy 
Is the Lamb,'' for example _ show the degree to which Handel, transplanted 
to England from Germany, had absorbed the accents and cadences of 
the Anglican church music that Purcell wrote a generation earlier. 
But of course, ``Messiah'' was composed as a sacred work for secular 
use, to be performed in theaters rather than churches. And although 
Handel composed it in the heat of the summer, over three weeks in 
August and September 1741, he intended the work for performances around 
Easter, not Christmas. Still, fair is fair: given the number of masses, 
requiems and other truly liturgical works that have migrated to the 
concert hall, who could begrudge St. Thomas _ or the dozens of other 
churches that present ``Messiah'' performances over the next few weeks 
_ the right to poach this magnificent, picturesque oratorio from the 
concert repertory? St. Thomas' annual presentation, at any rate, has 
in recent years come to be the ``Messiah'' to hear, if you're going 
to hear only one. It has a rightness that, for this listener, eludes 
most concert readings. Part of that is a sense of dignity that the 
setting imposes. It's not that Carnegie Hall or Avery Fisher Hall, 
which both offer ``Messiah'' performances this week, are undignified, 
but there, ``Messiah'' is just another concert, part of the commerce 
in entertainment. At St. Thomas, the atmosphere is that of a sacred 
service, and Handel's intentions notwithstanding, that atmosphere 
elevates the music. There is also the question of style. ``Messiah'' 
is no more immune to changes of musical fashion than any other work, 
yet with this work, older fashions don't fade away; they become part 
of a spectrum that includes everything from grandly scaled Victorian 
readings accompanied by huge modern orchestras, to gospel-funk rescorings. 
St. Thomas' ``Messiah,'' which is conducted gracefully by Gerre Hancock, 
the church's organist and choirmaster, offers a streamlined, modernist 
view of Handelian antiquity. The sound of boy trebles and altos distinguishes 
its well-trained choir. Concert Royal provides bracing period instrument 
textures, including John Thiessen's brilliant solo playing on a valveless 
trumpet. And the vocal soloists ornament their lines in deference 
to the Baroque penchant for improvisatory embellishment. That said, 
Hancock's pacing and approach to dynamics and balances seemed dictated 
more by the sentiments of the text and the pictorialism of Handel's 
score than by dogmatic notions of Baroque style, let alone the received 
tradition rooted in favorite recordings. So the chorus ``Let Us Break 
Their Bonds Asunder'' was delivered at a breakneck pace, and the final 
``Amen'' was given an unusually spacious tempo. There was also something 
appealingly egoless in most of the solo singing. Jeffrey Thomas brought 
a light timbre to the tenor lines. Jennifer Lane, the mezzo-soprano, 
had some awkward moments when the music reached toward the bottom 
of her range, and in the fast ``Refiner's Fire'' figuration, but her 
contributions elsewhere were lovely. Amanda Balestrieri's soprano 
lines had clarity and shapeliness. And if Curtis Streetman's bass 
solos were sometimes slightly mannered, his rich timbre made his lapses 
forgivable. There is a second performance Thursday at St. Thomas, 
on Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street.
