Another 600 to 700 Polaroid Corp. employees will lose their jobs over 
the next year and a half as the company struggles to cope with declining 
sales in Russia, Latin America and Asia. The layoffs are expected 
to help stem red ink flowing from those regions, which have been swept 
up in the world's growing economic and currency problems. Company 
officials said Wednesday the layoffs, which represent 7 percent of 
Polaroid's workforce, would come primarily in manufacturing, sales, 
general and administrative operations. Employees in North America, 
the Pacific Rim and on the Asian continent will go, but details were 
not immediately available about how many jobs would be eliminated 
in each location. ``What this is really doing for us is it's kind 
of clearing the decks,'' said spokeswoman Nancy Childs. ``You take 
the hurt now rather than spreading it out over another year or so.'' 
The latest news was timed to warn analysts that fourth-quarter earnings, 
to be announced in January, likely won't be as strong as previously 
expected, Childs added. The announcement came a year to the day after 
Polaroid's last round of layoffs were made public _ 1,500 jobs cut, 
mostly in Massachusetts manufacturing. Gary T. DiCamillo, chairman 
and chief executive officer, said the new round ``puts Polaroid on 
a more solid footing to enter 1999 poised for profitable growth.'' 
The further restructuring is expected to save Polaroid $20-$30 million 
over the next two years, greater savings than previously anticipated. 
With annual sales of more than $2.1 billion in 1997, the company known 
for its instant imaging technology embarked on a major cost-cutting 
initiative in 1995 when DiCamillo joined the firm. On Wednesday, he 
revealed the firm has successfully renegotiated terms of a $350 million 
revolving credit agreement with all 14 of its bank lenders. The company 
needed the deal _ which extends until 2001 _ to ensure it has enough 
cash on hand to pursue strategic plans, including the introduction 
of new products like PocketCam. One of Polaroid's most recent inventions, 
the small instant camera produces miniature photos and is designed 
to appeal to young adults and children. For the even younger set, 
there's Barbie Instant Camera, a pink and purple unit that piggybacks 
on the popularity of Mattel's famous doll. Also Wednesday, company 
officials reiterated their intention to spend reserves of $90 million 
in the fourth quarter. About $50 million will be used to cover the 
cost of restructuring, and $40 million for anticipated losses in Russia. 
Many Russian vendors have been unable to pay Polaroid for products 
sent to them, Childs said, and film that has gone unsold there has 
been thrown out or returned to the company. Polaroid makes instant 
photographic cameras and films; digital imaging hardware, software 
and media; and an array of other products.
