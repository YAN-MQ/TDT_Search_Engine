Tribesmen who kidnapped four Germans last week are demanding more 
jobs, roads and scholarships for the release of their hostages, newspapers 
reported Wednesday. A statement from the kidnappers was signed ``the 
hosts of the four Germans'' and detailed demands for the release of 
the hostages. It was published by most major newspapers. The Germans 
_ three women and one man _ were abducted Dec. 7 by three gunmen from 
the Bani Dhabyan tribe in Marib province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) 
northeast of the capital, San'a. The German hostages were identified 
by the Yemen Times as Norbert Degen, Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung 
and Inge Brunner. The names could not be confirmed with the German 
Embassy. The statement by the sheiks of the Bani Dhabyan tribe asked 
for more schools, hospitals, telephone lines and roads in its poor 
province. It also complained of the few jobs available. ``We want 
the government to employ 200 of our tribesmen in the army, find jobs 
for 150 people in the tourism industry and employ 150 people of our 
handicapped men and women. In addition, we would like 25 scholarships 
in San`a University in the fields of medicine, law and engineering,'' 
the statement said. It was signed by tribal leaders, Ali Abdullah 
al-Humaidi and Mohammed Ali Siraj, Al-Rai Al-Am newspaper reported. 
Military helicopters hovered over Ra`id Mountain on Wednesday where 
the hostages are being held, eyewitnesses said. More than 150 members 
of an elite Yemeni force also arrived Wednesday. There are already 
more than 250 troops in armored vehicles circling the mountain where 
the Germans are believed held. The show of force comes a day after 
the expiry of a deadline given the kidnappers by President Ali Abdullah 
Saleh. Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which 
are lawless and controlled by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate 
to take the law in their hands to get their demands fulfilled. The 
hostages _ often oil-industry workers, diplomats or tourists _ are 
usually treated well and released unhurt. In April, members of the 
same tribe released British hostages after the government promised 
to build more roads in the area and return a four-wheel drive vehicle 
that was seized in March.
