``The Internet changes everything!'' has become the rallying cry for 
purveyors of the new digital economy. Their enthusiasm has proved 
sufficiently compelling that an increasing number of Internet-based 
companies _ many with no product, no profits and, often, no proven 
or sustainable business model _ are taking their companies public 
and hitting the jackpot with shares that are valued far beyond reason. 
On the Friday after Thanksgiving, for example, shares of Onsale Inc., 
a Web-based auction service, rocketed more than 60 percent. Books-a-Million 
Inc. and Connect Inc., both Web-based businesses, posted even more 
spectacular gains. Most professional investors and market experts 
are not overly concerned about this kind of activity. The volume of 
shares that such companies make available for trading is relatively 
small and thus has little effect on the overall health of the market. 
In addition, they say, Internet stocks are widely, and correctly, 
regarded as high-risk investments. But what was noteworthy about the 
trading action after Thanksgiving was that it was caused by day traders 
_ primarily individual investors, trading online _ who rely on quick 
market fluctuations to turn a profit. And on the day after Thanksgiving, 
these individuals dominated the trading volume in at least a few high-technology 
growth stocks. The Internet changes everything, indeed. For the first 
time, anyone with a computer, a connection to the global network and 
the requisite ironclad stomach for risk has the information, tools 
and access to transaction systems required to play the stock market, 
a game that was once the purview of an elite few. For those who believe 
that this kind of decentralization of power is the primary benefit 
of an Internet-based economy, this is good news. But one has to wonder 
about the unintended consequences of such a fundamental shift. Some 
studies show that the number of individuals jumping onto the Internet 
increases by thousands every day; as technology improves, that number 
is likely to rise even faster. Information _ especially the kind of 
information that fuels stock trading, like real-time quotes and company 
data _ is on the verge of becoming ubiquitous. Couple that with the 
likelihood that as more individuals make money in a booming stock 
market, the word of mouth _ spread in chat rooms and news groups via 
the Internet itself _ is likely to attract still more day traders, 
and you end up with a model for exponential growth. Some market makers, 
in fact, are already projecting that they will have to double or triple 
their technology investments to keep up with increased volume from 
Internet traders. Though he believes the volatility of Internet stocks 
is not itself a problem, William Hambrecht, co-founder of the investment 
banking firm Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, calls the day trader phenomenon 
``a big thing.'' ``I've been amazed they've been able to have such 
an impact on some of these big-cap Internet stocks,'' said Hambrecht, 
who now runs W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co., an entrepreneurial investment 
firm. ``This isn't a few people with a few small stocks.'' He calls 
the current day trader phenomenon ``mob rule,'' and adds: ``In a free 
market, it plays itself out. Professionals are trying to tell these 
people that they're playing with dangerous stuff, but people don't 
listen when they're in a feeding frenzy.'' Some investors are anticipating 
the near-term effects of day trading on the Internet economy itself, 
which is fueled in large part by the hefty prices commanded by Internet-related 
stocks. ``These price effects have consequences,'' says Ann Winblad, 
a co-founder of Hummer Winblad Venture Partners in San Francisco, 
a technology investment firm. A prolonged run-up in stock prices, 
she says, could prove to be a double whammy for Internet companies. 
For one thing, Ms. Winblad said, it will become increasingly difficult 
to hire talented managers if they believe the shares are so overpriced 
that the stock options being offered them _ the pheromone that draws 
most executives to technology companies _ are likely to be considerably 
devalued when the market comes to its senses. If the company then 
resets the options at a lower, more attractive price, institutional 
investors, who hold most of the market's stock and tend to invest 
in assets rather than concepts, will balk. Today, it is only these 
institutional investors, as well as program traders who move large 
blocks of stock in a single, computer-guided transaction, who can 
affect the overall stability of the larger market. But if individual 
trading on the Internet continues to grow at its current pace, it 
is possible to imagine a situation where the market as we know it 
today cannot absorb the shock. Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global 
Business Network, a strategic planning firm in Emeryville, Calif., 
points to the fact that people around the world have access to the 
stock market through the Internet. What happens, he asks, when ``vast 
numbers of people from all around the world _ 50 million people in 
India, 5 million in Brazil _ are all trading?'' If the number of individual 
investors grows large enough to match the volume of shares held by 
institutional investors and program traders, Schwartz says, ``when 
herd behavior moves the larger market in these highly volatile ways, 
unrelated to the value of the assets themselves, that becomes highly 
problematic.'' Of course, there is no way to predict whether such 
a situation will unfold. Even if it does, Schwartz said, it will be 
a long time coming. But in the short term, the problem may solve itself. 
``Not too many people have the stomach'' for day trading, Ms. Winblad 
said. ``The viral effect will eventually settle. Some industries are 
maimed, but they don't go away.'' NYT-12-13-98 1719EST
