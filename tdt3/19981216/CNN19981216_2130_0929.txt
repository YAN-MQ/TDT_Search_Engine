Checking our top stories -- U.S. and British forces launched a substantial 
military attack on Iraq this evening. This was following a report 
from chief U.N. weapons inspector that Iraq was not fully cooperating 
with inspection teams. Explosions from Iraqi anti-aircraft guns could 
first be heard in the skies around 1:00 A.M. Baghdad time. Military 
sources say two or three days of bombings are planned over military 
and security targets. Sources say the first wave of the attack would 
involve about 100 cruise missiles fired from the "USS enterprise." 
That would be followed by strikes from manned aircraft, and then cruise 
missiles fired from B-52 aircraft.
