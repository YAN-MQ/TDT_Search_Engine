"CNN Headline News." I'm Lynne Russell, good evening. "Operation desert 
fox" is in effect. Today's joint U.S. and British military strike 
on Iraq began without warning around 1 A.M. Baghdad time, 6 P.M. eastern 
standard time. President Clinton says the objective is to launch a 
Sustained series of air strikes that will seriously diminish Iraq's 
ability to develop nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Sources 
say cruise missiles were fired from ships and fighter bombers targeting 
Iraqi military and security installations. Military sources say two 
or three days of bombings are planned but there is no specific timetable. 
President Clinton says he gave Iraqi President Saddam Hussein fair 
warning. In halting our air strikes in November, I gave Saddam a chance, 
not a License. If we turn our backs on his defiance, the credibility 
of U.S. power as a Check against Saddam will be destroyed. We will 
not only have allowed Saddam to shatter the inspection system that 
controls his weapons of mass destruction program, we also will have 
fatally undercut the fear of force that stops Saddam from acting to 
gain domination in the region.
