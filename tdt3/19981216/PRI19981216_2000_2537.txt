The nation that is the answer to today's geography quiz celebrates 
a sort of a holy festival tonight. At dusk, religious devotees of 
our mystery country reenact the Biblical Holy Family's fruitless search 
for logic. They wind their way through the city and village streets, 
carrying slender platforms that are topped with clay figurines of 
the pregnant Virgin Mary riding a donkey, and Joseph walking alongside. 
The people knock on doors, begging for a place to sleep, and in the 
play-acting of this ritual, they are rudely turned away. Finally, 
one housekeeper takes them in to a table of refreshments and a pinata. 
That's one clue. Another, tonight's procession, which marks the start 
of the Christmas season in this country, is called Lapasada. It is 
repeated nightly until Christmas Eve. So, know where we are? The answer 
will make its way to you later this hour.
