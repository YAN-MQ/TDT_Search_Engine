The Russian government won the go-ahead from parliament Wednesday 
to begin printing billions of rubles in a bid to help pay the state's 
crushing debt, but the move could stoke already high inflation. Russia's 
cash-strapped government needs the extra rubles to pay off workers 
and pensioners, among others. But with inflation running at around 
70 percent this year, the cash injection could push prices even higher. 
In a bid to cover its huge budget deficit, the government has already 
printed $648 million worth of rubles since October without waiting 
for parliament approval. Russia's parliament unanimously approved 
a bill Wednesday that allows the government to print $1.2 billion 
worth of rubles in the last quarter of this year. The bill also requires 
Russian exporters to repatriate 75 percent of their hard-currency 
earnings, up from the current 50 percent in a bid to shore up foreign 
currency reserves. The government meanwhile has drafted a budget for 
1999 that assumes foreign lenders will provide new loans which have 
not been promised and restructure massive amounts of previous debt 
Russia has failed to pay. Russia defaulted on many of its treasury 
bonds in August, sending financial markets into a nosedive and prompting 
foreign lenders to freeze aid to Russia. The country is now mired 
in its worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse. Economics 
Minister Andrei Shapovalyants, after talks between the World Bank 
representative in Moscow, expressed hope Russia could receive $3.4 
billion in loans from the World Bank next year. But negotiations with 
foreign creditors over the defaulted treasury bonds snagged when Finance 
Minister Mikhail Zadornov announced a deal had been reached _ a claim 
lenders quickly denied. Zadornov claimed an agreement was reached 
to reissue $10 billion dollars in bonds with maturities of four to 
five years. Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse-First Boston, which are 
leading negotiations with Russia, said they had not agreed to the 
Russian terms. In a rare good sign for the government's coffers, at 
least two foreign companies have offered bids for a 2.5 percent stake 
in the state-controlled natural gas giant, Gazprom, the Interfax news 
agency reported Wednesday. The government is asking at least $651 
million for the stake _ significantly more than its market price. 
Before debating the 1999 budget, parliament will first weigh measures 
to streamline the nation's unwieldy tax system in a bid to create 
incentives for ailing industries and persuade tax evaders to pay what 
they owe. Bills have been proposed to lower the value-added tax, currently 
at 20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent.
