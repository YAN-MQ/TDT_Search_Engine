Goldman Sachs and the provincial Chinese government of Guangdong will 
pump money into the province's biggest investment firm in a unique 
partnership between the government and a foreign bank. Goldman will 
also buy a $20-million steak in Guangdong Enterprises holdings, a 
private investment firm owned by China's richest province, after it 
helps restructure that firm.
