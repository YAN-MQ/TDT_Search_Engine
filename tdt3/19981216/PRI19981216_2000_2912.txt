The United States has launched a sustained series of air strikes against 
Iraq. President Clinton made the decision this morning after reading 
UNSCUM Chief Richard Butler's report charging Iraq with obstructing 
his weapons inspectors. The president spoke to the nation this evening 
to explain his reasons for the attack. Instead of the inspectors disarming 
Saddam, Saddam has disarmed the inspectors. This situation presents 
a clear and present danger to the stability of the Persian Gulf and 
the safety of people everywhere. The international community gave 
Saddam one last chance to resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors. 
Saddam has failed to seize the chance, and so we've had to act, and 
act now. President Clinton also acknowledged again that the best outcome 
for Iraq would be a new government to replace that of Saddam Hussein.
