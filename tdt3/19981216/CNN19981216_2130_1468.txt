The New York film critics circle has given its top honors to two films 
about world war II. "Saving private Ryan" won for best picture of 
the year, while Terrence malick was named best director for "the thin 
red line." The New York film critics circle is a group of critics 
from major New York-based newspapers and magazines. The awards tend 
to be a harbinger of what's to come at the academy awards, for which 
"saving private Ryan" is considered a strong contender.
