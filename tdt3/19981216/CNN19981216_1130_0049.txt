President Clinton met with his national security advisers this morning 
about the latest weapons inspection crisis with Iraq. Pentagon sources 
say a U.S. and British military strike against Baghdad is likely within 
hours. Eight warships equipped with cruise missiles have moved to 
the Persian gulf within striking distance of Baghdad. Richard Butler 
says, Iraq has reneged on its promise to cooperate, and he ordered 
United Nations weapons inspectors to leave Baghdad today. The U.N. 
security council is meeting today to discuss Butler's report. That 
is my most important concern, that everyone is out and safe. I took 
this decision because, as I reported yesterday, to the secretary-general, 
they are not able to do their work adequately and, therefore, I removed 
them and we will consider things further as the day unfolds. Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein met with his command council today. A statement 
issued after the meeting said Iraq is ready to face an attack, and 
it accused of the United States and Britain of aggression, pushed 
by malice and hatred.
