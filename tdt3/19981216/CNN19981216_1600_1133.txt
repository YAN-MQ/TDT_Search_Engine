Sirens are going off in Baghdad. There is no explosions of any kind, 
but we hear sirens in the background. Let's hear. They are looking 
relaxed. He was also telling his people that they could resist. He 
put the country on a war footing. He divided the country into four 
commands, where he placed four generals to take care of resistance 
and internal security. You remember after the end of the gulf war, 
there were uprisings in the south and in the north. So those areas 
are being put under control of his trusted generals and lieutenants. 
Tariq Aziz made a statement today. He said that the Butler report, 
that Iraq had not fully complied with the weapons inspection process 
was mustly "just a justification for air attacks." He said it was 
an ill-intentioned report and full of lies. On the other hand, we 
drove into Iraq, along 500 kilometers, and there was nothing strange 
to be noted. Electricity was on, communications towers looked on in 
the town we saw itself, and there has not been a sense of emergency 
among the people. Now perhaps they are going into their houses. It's 
getting late here, midnight here now. But there is a sense of apathy, 
really, among the people. These are people who have been under this 
kind of threat for so so many years now. There's a sense we can't 
do anything about it, and if this is going to happen, we hope that 
the targets are military and we don't get hurt or in the way. We are 
looking at scenes of Baghdad, live picturing through our night scope. 
To underscore what you're saying describing what you saw coming into 
the capital, right now we can hear horns, we see cars, apartment building 
lights, and notwithstanding that burst of an air raid siren, things 
seem to be normal. Yes, as we have been saying, up until now, things 
have been normal. This was the display of anything ab normal. That 
is essentially a war footing, essentially, a state of emergency has 
been declared.
