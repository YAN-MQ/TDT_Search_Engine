Palestinians said Wednesday they will stick to their Wye River accord 
commitments, despite an Israeli freeze on the process _ an apparent 
effort to cultivate the U.S.-Palestinian friendship that blossomed 
during this week's Clinton visit. Netanyahu on Wednesday morning briefed 
his Cabinet on U.S. President Bill Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed 
what he told the president a day earlier _ that he would not withdraw 
troops on Friday, as required by the Wye accord. An Israeli official 
speaking on condition of anonymity later said Netanyahu would announce 
Wednesday night that he will agree to early elections if he is unable 
to stabilize his shaky coalition. Netanyahu's office said he would 
make announcement ``regarding elections'' at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT). That 
would further delay implementation of the agreement brokered by Clinton 
at Wye River, Maryland in October. Netanyahu says he wants solid evidence 
that the Palestinians are fulfilling their commitment to contain anti-Israel 
violence and to round up illegal weapons. The Palestinians want quid-pro-quo 
for acceding on Monday to the Israeli demand that the Palestine National 
Council convene and renounce clauses in its charter calling for Israel's 
destruction. Clinton attended that meeting. Palestinian officials 
said Netanyahu's actions brought his commitment to the peace process 
into question. ``It shows that the Israeli government doesn't believe 
in peace, and this is what we are seeing on the ground,'' said Mahmoud 
Abbas, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy. Still, Palestinians 
remained committed to the process, and would continue to fulfill its 
requirements. ``We shall continue to carry out our commitments and 
we shall push ... for full implementation from Israel,'' said Nabil 
Shaath, a top Palestinian negotiator returning with Arafat from Egypt, 
where the Palestinian leader briefed President Hosni Mubarak on the 
Clinton visit. Shaath even indicated that the Palestinians were willing 
to consider a post-Wye demand from Netanyahu that Arafat back off 
a promise to declare statehood by May. The declaration would come 
only if Israel delays agreements, he said.
