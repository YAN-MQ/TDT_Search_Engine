Bulgaria's Parliament on Wednesday approved a 1999 budget that envisages 
a deficit of 2.8 percent of the gross domestic product. The budget 
reflects the intention of the reform-minded government to accelerate 
economic growth and create conditions that favor the introduction 
of a sound market economy, in place of the current, weak economy still 
dominated by state-owned firms and burdened with a dlrs 9 billion 
foreign debt. The budget foresees revenues of 4.5 trillion leva (dlrs 
2.7 billion) and expenditures of 4.9 trillion leva (dlrs 2.9 billion) 
and a deficit of 435.6 billion leva (dlrs 262 million). The budget 
foresees inflation of 6.6 percent, a 3.7 percent rise in GDP. Last 
year Bulgaria's economy contracted by 6.9 percent and inflation amounted 
to 576.8 percent. According to Finance Minister Muravei Radev inflation 
in the coming year would remain under 10 percent, while GDP growth 
is estimated at 4 percent. Bulgaria's relative financial stability 
today is due to the currency board that was established in July 1997 
to prevent the central bank from printing money to cover deficits.
