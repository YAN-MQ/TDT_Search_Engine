BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors on Wednesday left Baghdad 
abruptly in a convoy of buses and cars, accusing Iraq of obstructing 
their search for the country's illegal weapons. Their departure without 
any notice pointed at imminent U.S.-British air strikes, which were 
suspended last month after Iraq pledged to fully cooperate with the 
inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM. A 
top U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
the strike will be either Wednesday or Thursday. British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cook said any U.S.-British attack on Iraq will come quickly 
and without warning. And Prime Minister Tony Blair told Parliament 
that any attack would have the ``necessary legal force.'' Lawmakers 
murmured ``Hear! Hear!.'' In New York, the U.N. Security Council called 
an emergency meeting for later Wednesday. Hours after some 140 UNSCOM 
inspectors were evacuated, Iraq's President Saddam Hussein called 
a special joint meeting of the decision-making Revolutionary Command 
Council and the ruling Baath Party. The mood _ reflected in a statement 
after the meeting _ was defiant. The statement said the leadership 
reviewed steps to ``confront the American-British aggression.'' It 
is clear that they are planning to ``launch once again another aggression.'' 
But ``depend on God to knock the dreams out of their empty heads,'' 
the statement said. Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast 
and played patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos training 
with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. 
But there was no panic in the streets. A strike, if it comes, will 
be from the Gulf where the United States has amassed a huge armada, 
including an aircraft carrier and warships bristling with Tomahawk 
cruise missiles. Returning from a Middle East tour, President Bill 
Clinton met with his top national security advisers to consider military 
strikes. One White House national security aide called it ``a very 
serious situation.'' A senior defense official said U.S. forces in 
the Gulf are in ``an execute mode.'' Both officials spoke on condition 
of anonymity. Early Wednesday, three trucks loaded with luggage left 
the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad. About a half-hour later, three busloads 
of weapons inspectors also left the U.N. compound, followed by four 
white U.N. cars carrying spare tires on top. Most of the inspectors 
flew aboard a special U.N. plane from an airbase outside Baghdad to 
the Gulf state of Bahrain. ``All international staff ... have been 
pulled out from Baghdad,'' UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said 
in Bahrain. ``There is nobody left behind.'' The International Atomic 
Energy Agency, which is monitoring Iraq's compliance on dismantling 
its nuclear program, also withdrew its staff from Baghdad. UNSCOM 
is responsible for eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons 
and long-range missiles. Until these weapons of mass destruction are 
destroyed, the United Nations will lift economic sanctions imposed 
on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq says it has complied 
with every U.N. demand, and accuses chief weapons inspector Richard 
Butler of prolonging the inspections at the behest of the United States. 
The crisis follows a report by Butler on Tuesday to U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan in which he said Iraq's claim to be free of banned weapons 
``cannot be accepted without further verification.'' But verification 
is impossible as Iraq is obstructing, evading and thwarting the inspectors, 
he said. Butler cited the inspectors' inability to enter the headquarters 
of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid evidence of the 
presence of proscribed materials.'' At two other sites, one building 
had been emptied of relevant materials, and the other ``had been prepared 
to avoid any disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said. Butler also 
disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons programs no longer 
exist or have been destroyed. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz 
dismissed Butler's report as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended 
to trigger an American and British military strike on Iraq.'' Russian 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also accused Butler of overstepping his 
authority by ordering the evacuation. Russia has consistently opposed 
military action against Iraq. The U.S. military build up in the Gulf 
has been going on since August when Iraq suspended the inspectors's 
work. The standoff continued until Oct. 31 when Iraq also suspended 
cooperation with UNSCOM monitors, who looked after previously inspected 
sites. The United States had nearly attacked Iraq on Nov. 14 but President 
Clinton ordered a stand down at the eleventh hour to give Iraq another 
chance to cooperate with the inspectors. The United States has 24,100 
military men and women in the Gulf. There are also 22 warships and 
201 aircraft, including 72 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. 
Britain has 22 strike aircraft in the region. While the weapons inspectors 
have left, no decision has been made on on withdrawing the 400 U.N. 
humanitarian monitors from Iraq, U.N. spokesman George Somerwill said 
in Baghdad. However, they were prepared to leave ``should it become 
necessary,'' he said.
