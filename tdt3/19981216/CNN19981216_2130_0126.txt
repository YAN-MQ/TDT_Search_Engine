Defense secretary William Cohen says military strikes became necessary, 
after it became evident Iraq was not going to comply with the weapons 
inspections. He says Iraqi officials continually tried to deceive 
the inspectors, in order to hide their suspected weapons of mass destruction. 
Joint chiefs chairman Hugh Shelton outlined the military forces involved 
in the strikes. The operation employs U.S. Navy aircraft flying from 
the decks of the "USS enterprise," U.S. air force and royal air force 
aircraft operating from land bases in the region and tomahawk cruise 
missiles launched from U.S. navy ships at sea and United States air 
force B-52s. We are also in the process of deploying additional U.S. 
military forces to southwest Asia to the U.S. central command's area 
of operation to bolster our already substantial military presence 
in the gulf region.
