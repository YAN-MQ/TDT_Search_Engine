Flashing the smile that has helped make him a clubhouse favorite on 
the Giants and the New England Patriots, David Meggett put on a Jets 
cap Wednesday and pronounced himself ready for a clutch performance 
despite 11 months away from football. ``I'm very confident,'' the 
new third-down back/kick returner said. ``I've played in the league 
nine years in pressure situations.'' In four more days, he will have 
a role in another clutch game: the Jets' attempt to capture their 
first division title since 1969, when they were still playing in the 
American Football League. He will return punts and kickoffs, and probably 
be in for a limited number of running and receiving plays as the Jets 
tangle with the Buffalo Bills in a crucial American Football Conference 
East game in Orchard Park, N.Y. Meggett became a Jet after the team 
discovered Monday night that Leon Johnson had cracked a rib in Sunday 
night's victory over the Miami Dolphins. Johnson, who has been unable 
to match his versatile rookie-season heroics this year, will be gone 
for the rest of the campaign. He should recover in two months. ``I 
think Dave will be a quality replacement,'' Coach Bill Parcells said 
Wednesday of Meggett, a player he has coached on the Giants and the 
Patriots and for whom he obviously has a high regard. ``I'm very close 
to him and asked him how he was doing three weeks ago, and he said 
he didn't think he was quite ready. I called him two days ago and 
asked him if he was ready and he said, `I can help you this weekend 
if you want me to.''' The 32-year-old Meggett looked at his watch 
as he thought of what he would have been doing if Parcells hadn't 
lifted him from limbo. ``I'm supposed to be taking a final right now,'' 
Meggett said. Meggett, who underwent foot surgery in April _ two months 
after he was arrested and charged in conjunction with theft and assault 
on a 33-year-old woman in Toronto _ was cut by the Patriots in May. 
At the time, Patriots Coach Pete Carroll said that off-the-field events 
played a role in deciding whether to keep the player. After being 
released, Meggett enrolled at Towson State in Maryland and took 15 
credits toward a degree in sports administration. But he said he also 
maintained his workouts _ ``just as I've been doing since I was 13 
years old.'' He said that his foot problem no longer was a problem. 
Previous Jets regimes would have been unlikely to hire a Meggett, 
who still has the equivalent of a misdemeanor-theft charge pending 
in Toronto. He is to answer that next March. He has had several other 
legal battles stretching to 1990, including court appearances over 
charges he beat up a girlfriend, and claims of nonsupport payments 
for children he fathered with different women. But Parcells is the 
Jets' dictator for the new millennium. He brings in players he wants. 
He brought in the controversial Bryan Cox at linebacker over the summer, 
and he has become one of the team's most important players. Beyond 
the fact that Parcells has the power, though, he contends that Meggett 
``is a trustworthy, honest person.'' ``He's never lied to me, he's 
never been a discipline problem,'' said Parcells, who watched as the 
5-foot-7-inch, 190-pound Meggett went to the Pro Bowl from his 1989 
Giants and his 1996 Patriots teams and, of course, had Meggett on 
his 1990 Super Bowl championship squad. Meggett is the National Football 
League's career leader in punt returns and yardage. He said he did 
not know why the Patriots released him. ``Being in football nine years,'' 
he said, ``I never questioned it.'' So he wasn't upset the Patriots 
didn't back him up? ``No, I didn't grow up with them,'' he said. ``I 
know Bill Parcells has confidence in me as a person and a player.'' 
But can Meggett now avoid the situations that got him into trouble 
in the past? ``You try to be careful,'' he said. ``But things happen.'' 
He made a reference to Murphy's Law: if there is a possibility for 
something to go wrong, it will go wrong. As for the playoffs, he had 
an interesting spin. ``I feel kind of good because I didn't have to 
do any work to get us here,'' Meggett said. EXTRA POINTS Bryan Cox, 
who was named the AFC defensive player of the week on Wednesday, returns 
to Buffalo on Saturday, where two previous incidents resulted in heavy 
fines. The linebacker was fined $10,000 in 1993, when he was a Dolphin, 
for making obscene gestures toward the fans. He later sued the league, 
claiming that fans had shouted racial epithets and that the league 
hadn't provided a ``workplace environment free from racial harassment.'' 
That suit was settled when the league agreed to eject fans who use 
racial slurs, and the fine was lowered to $3,000. He also was fined 
in 1995 when he spit at fans after he was ejected for fighting with 
a Bills player. . . . Two starters, defensive back Aaron Glenn (ankle) 
and fullback Keith Byars (broken arm), are practicing this week and 
listed as 50-50 to play against Buffalo. . . . Bills Coach Wade Phillips 
said the way the Jets' defense harried Doug Flutie in their first 
meeting this season led to a change in Buffalo's offensive alignment. 
``One guy `spied' on Doug,'' said Phillips, describing how linebacker 
James Farrior's assignment was to shadow Flutie. The Bills subsequently 
changed their offense, spreading it with more receivers and making 
it difficult to key on the quarterback. Meanwhile, Flutie has never 
lost a regular-season home game as a starter in the NFL. His record: 
11-0 with the Patriots and the Bills, including 5-0 this season.
