In a move intended to strengthen the Bosnian peace accord, the United 
States and other countries agreed here Wednesday to more aggressively 
reward those Bosnian leaders who comply with the pact and punish those 
who do not. The carrot-and-stick policy will still be under the control 
of the top civilian international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp. 
Westendorp was given added authority to remove Bosnian leaders from 
political posts if they obstructed the 1995 peace accord, especially 
a provision that lets war refugees return home to areas that other 
ethnic groups control. And he was given added input over allocating 
the $1.5 billion in annual foreign aid to Bosnia. The accord was reached 
among the 46 donor nations at the Bosnian Peace Implementation Council 
here, the third such meeting since the three-year war ended in 1995. 
President Clinton's special representative for carrying out the Bosnian 
peace plan, Robert Gelbard, said Westendorp's expanded authority should 
be wielded only on rare occasions. ``We're caught in somewhat of a 
bind,'' Gelbard said. ``It's essential for the Bosnian parties to 
assume responsibility for their future. But there are times, when 
to break an impasse, it is important to be able to cut through the 
political tangles that exist.'' The two-day meeting ended Wednesday 
with the approval of a document that lays out the most detailed plan 
yet for the return of an estimated one million refugees and for economic 
changes to create jobs and compete financially without relying on 
foreign aid. The donor nations warned that they would soon reduce 
aid, although an immediate pullout of the 34,000 foreign troops is 
not widely expected. The 39-page document lists a two-year timetable 
for broad changes, including creating an independent judiciary and 
multiethnic police forces, a program that Westendorp said should ``make 
the peace irreversible.'' One dissenting voice, Western officials 
said, was Nikola Poplasen, recently elected leader of the Bosnian 
Serb republic. Considered a hard-liner by the United States, Poplasen 
worried at a news conference here on Tuesday that Westendorp was growing 
too powerful. Another Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, told reporters 
here Wednesday about a new atmosphere of cooperation in Bosnia. Dodik 
praised Westendorp's authority to ``impose a solution when a mutual 
accord cannot be found.'' Westendorp has dismissed seven Bosnian officials 
who he thought opposed the peace plan. But some of the officials stayed 
active and influential in their political parties, a practice that 
Westendorp will have added authority to prohibit.
