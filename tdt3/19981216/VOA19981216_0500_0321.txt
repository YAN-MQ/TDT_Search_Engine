Northern Ireland's loyalist volunteer force is pledging to begin disarmament 
by Christmas. The force says it will hand over or destroy guns under 
the supervision of a panel led by Canada's former army chief, General 
John De la Shastalane. The general was appointed to head up the international 
body in charge of the entire disarmament process.
