A day after South Korean President Kim Dae-jung expressed regret over 
his country's role in the Vietnam War for the first time, his Vietnamese 
counterpart said Wednesday he doesn't expect any such apologies. The 
expression of regret came during a meeting between Kim and Vietnamese 
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai on the sidelines of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations summit here. ``We are not asking anyone to 
apologize or provide us with reparations,'' Khai told a news conference 
when asked if the United States also should make a similar statement. 
``If they feel regret for what they did in the past, that's their 
decision. We want to close the past, look to the future and build 
better relations with other nations.'' However, he said he sometimes 
is irritated by criticism from countries that invaded Vietnam and 
had to be driven out now champion democracy and see Vietnam as a non-democratic 
country. In a speech to a dinner Wednesday night hosted by Vietnamese 
President Tran Duc Luong, Kim referred to an ``unfortunate period 
between our two countries'' and expressed hope for ``a pregressive 
and future-oriented bilateral relationship.'' He also said he hopes 
that North Korea, which maintains friendly relations with Hanoi, ``will 
learn a great lesson from the policy of reform and openness of Vietnam.'' 
South Korea sent 300,000 troops to Vietnam over about an eight-year 
period, fighting alongside U.S. forces. More than 5,000 were killed. 
It was Kim's first visit to Vietnam since he took office earlier this 
year.
