The Russian parliament approved a bill today that allows the government 
to print $1.2 billion _ an amount that will help pay the state's bills, 
but may also provoke more inflation. Russia's cash-strapped government 
needs the money to pay off workers and pensioners, among others. But 
with inflation already running at around 70 percent this year, the 
fresh infusion of cash could push prices even higher. Parliament's 
lower house, the State Duma, unanimously passed the measure today 
on the final reading. President Boris Yeltsin's government is authorized 
to print the new money until the end of the year. The bill now goes 
to parliament's upper house, which is expected to approve it swiftly, 
and then to Yeltsin, who is expected to sign it without delay. The 
Russian government has already begun printing rubles in recent months 
to cover its huge budget deficit. As expected, the value of the currency 
has been declining and inflation has been rising. In an attempt to 
shore up the currency, the bill passed today also requires Russian 
exporters to repatriate 75 percent of their hard-currency earnings, 
up from the current 50 percent. This will keep more foreign currency 
inside Russia. Russia is struggling with its worst economic crisis 
since the Soviet Union collapsed, and the government has been assembling 
a series of measures to guide the country out of its depression. Parliament 
also was weighing several measures aimed at streamlining the nation's 
unwieldy tax system in advance of a debate on next year's budget. 
The proposed bills seek to lower the value added tax, currently at 
20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent. The measures 
also call for revising the personal income tax tables to take into 
account the ruble's recent fall. The aim is to create tax incentives 
for ailing industries, and encourage more tax evaders to pay what 
they owe. But critics warn that tax cuts may only result in even lower 
government revenues. The measures are expected to win approval in 
the Communist-dominated parliament's lower house, the State Duma. 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other officials have voiced hopes 
that the house will also quickly pass next year's budget. The government 
says it needs the budget in place to effectively deal with the crisis. 
In recent years, protracted budget debates often resulted in Russia 
living for months without an approved budget, adding to the nation's 
economic turmoil.
