We'll see snow by tomorrow afternoon move into North Dakota and then 
push into Minnesota and Wisconsin by Friday. Other than that, very 
nice weather across the nation. Some rain in the Rio Grande valley 
of Texas, with clouds and breezy conditions along the California coastline. 
Chilly temperatures across the nation. We'll see overnight lows in 
the zeroes over Minnesota, many teens, 20s and 30s across the nation. 
High temperatures tomorrow warming up nicely over most of the country. 
However, the northern plains, Ohio valley and the northeast will see
