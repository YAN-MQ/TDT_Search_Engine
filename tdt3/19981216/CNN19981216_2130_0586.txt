A Kentucky judge has sentenced 15-year-old Michael Carneal to life 
in prison without the possibility of parole for at least 25 years. 
Carneal was convicted of killing three classmates and wounding five 
others during a shooting spree at his high school in Paducah last 
year. He pleaded guilty, but mentally ill to the murders. Police say 
Carneal shot a .22-caliber pistol in the direction of a prayer group, 
killing three girls. One bullet left a student paralyzed from the 
chest down.
