Palestinians said Wednesday they will stick to their Wye River accord 
commitments, despite an Israeli freeze on the process _ an apparent 
effort to cultivate the U.S.-Palestinian friendship that blossomed 
during this week's visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton. Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday morning briefed his Cabinet 
on Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president 
a day earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops on Friday, as required 
by the Wye accord.
