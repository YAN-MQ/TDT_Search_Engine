War won out among the New York Film Critics Circle Thursday as that 
group chose Steven Spielberg's fiercely immediate World War II epic 
``Saving Private Ryan'' as the best film of 1998. ``The Thin Red Line,'' 
the year's other, prettier and more contemplative World War II film, 
was another winner, for both John Toll's cinematography and for direction 
by Terrence Malick, the maverick 1970s filmmaker who had been AWOL 
for two decades. The split between these dueling battle dramas might 
have been the biggest surprise of this year's voting had the group 
not also _ to the astonishment of some of its 31 members _ chosen 
Cameron Diaz as best actress for her performance in ``There's Something 
About Mary.'' Nick Nolte was voted best actor for his volcanic performance 
in ``Affliction,'' as a man struggling with mounting pressures and 
coming to terms with his violently abusive father. On a considerably 
lighter note, Bill Murray was named best supporting actor for his 
role as a quixotic tycoon in ``Rushmore.'' And Lisa Kudrow, the first 
member of the ``Friends'' cast to win such an accolade for film work, 
was voted best supporting actress for her role as a wisecracking, 
lonely cynic in ``The Opposite of Sex.'' ``Shakespeare in Love'' was 
cited for its sparkling screenplay by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, 
imagining an Elizabethan theater filled with present-day chicanery 
and a young playwright spinning ``Romeo and Juliet'' out of his own 
thwarted romance. And the group gave its best first feature award 
to Richard Kwietniowski's ``Love and Death on Long Island,'' in which 
John Hurt plays a scholarly Englishman obsessed with a Hollywood teen-movie 
hunk. As best foreign film, group members chose the Danish film ``The 
Celebration,'' a rollicking stylistic experiment that depicts a fractious 
family reunion, avoiding such conventional niceties as lighting, makeup 
and props. The winning nonfiction was ``The Farm: Angola U.S.A.,'' 
a galvanizing documentary about the lives of black inmates serving 
long sentences in a Louisiana prison. Voting was most heated in the 
best actress category, where Fernanda Montenegro and Renee Zellweger 
tied as runners-up to Ms. Diaz. Ms. Montenegro is the Brazilian actress 
whose performance in ``Central Station'' evokes the great work of 
Giulietta Massina. Ms. Zellweger played central roles in both ``A 
Price Above Rubies'' and ``One True Thing.'' In the best film category, 
Paul Schrader's ``Affliction'' was a close second, followed by Todd 
Solondz's ``Happiness.'' Solondz and Schrader were among those receiving 
votes as best director, where Spielberg and John Boorman (``The General'') 
also figured prominently in the voting. A strong runner-up in the 
supporting actor category was Dylan Baker, who plays a psychiatrist 
with a painful secret in Solondz's film. The awards will be presented 
in New York on Jan. 10. The group's current chairman is Godfrey Cheshire 
of The New York Press.
