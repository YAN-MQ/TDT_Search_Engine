DaimlerChrysler on Wednesday announced the lineup of its 20-member 
supervisory board, in a further step toward integrating the newly-merged 
company. Made up of 10 shareholder and 10 employee representatives, 
the board is led by Hilmar Kopper, who also heads the supervisory 
board of Deutsche Bank. The board held its first meeting and formally 
announced the members of DaimlerChrysler's managing board, which includes 
company co-chairmen Juergen Schrempp and Robert Eaton, the company 
said in a statement. Karl Feuerstein, the former head of Daimler AG's 
employees' board, was appointed Hilmar's deputy. Employees will be 
represented by the president of the United Auto Workers, Stephen Yokich. 
A board member responsible for production and labor relations for 
Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth and Jeep hasn't been named yet, the statement 
said.
