Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber is singing the praises of a New York 
jury. The panel decided he did not copy the melody for the theme from 
his hit musical "the phantom of the opera." A Baltimore songwriter 
had sued Lloyd Webber, saying the theme sounded just like his 1978 
tune, "till you". Lloyd Webber says he feels totally vindicated.
