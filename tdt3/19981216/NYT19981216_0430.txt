A Federal Reserve official warned Wednesday that regulators may need 
to insist that banks scrutinize more closely _ and lend less freely 
_ to hedge funds to avoid such crises as the near-failure in September 
of Long-Term Capital Management. ``Private market discipline seems 
to have largely broken down'' in that case, said Patrick Parkinson, 
associate director of the Fed's division of research and statistics, 
forcing the Fed to organize a $3.5 billion rescue operation by the 
hedge fund's creditors to avert any threat to the global financial 
system. ``Weaknesses in risk management practices clearly need to 
be addressed,'' Parkinson told the Senate Agriculture Committee, which 
was convened to monitor the progress of an interagency group studying 
derivative products, as well as hedge funds. The group is made up 
of officials from the Fed, the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The committee 
also heard suggestions of possible moves to shore up or impose regulation 
by the Treasury and the SEC. This was seen by some as a softening 
of earlier stances. ``There now appears to be a willingness among 
all the players to look at a number of issues in the over-the-counter 
market, particularly in the areas of transparency and disclosure,'' 
said John Phillips, a spokesman for the commodities futures group. 
Brooksley Born, head of that commission, has angered key members of 
Congress, other regulators and some of her fellow commissioners by 
refusing to agree to delay possible new regulation of derivatives 
until Congress is able to provide direction. Roger Anderson, a deputy 
assistant secretary of the Treasury, said Wednesday that opposition 
to a commodities futures group ``concept release'' on swaps in May 
to study the situation was based on legal analysis, not because the 
subject did not merit scrutiny. ``We always agreed that there were 
important aspects of the derivatives market that deserved study, and 
we are happy to be able to address those questions in a format that 
does not increase legal uncertainty,'' Anderson said. A partial moratorium 
on any rule-making on swaps has been imposed by Congress until the 
end of March. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who heads the Agriculture Committee, 
said he found little evidence that the collapse of Long-Term Capital 
Management was primarily attributable to its use of swaps. Rather, 
Lugar contended, the problem was excessive leverage and lax lending 
standards. ``The LTCM affair may suggest the need for a regulatory 
response,'' he said. ``Additional disclosure of information to regulators 
may be appropriate. More prudent practices on the part of lenders 
may also need to be encouraged or even required.'' Lugar added, however, 
that banking agencies might be more appropriate supervisors for new 
authority than the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a tiny agency 
whose charter will shortly be coming up for renewal. In his discussion 
of the Long-Term Capital case, Parkinson of the Fed said that banks 
and other ``counterparties'' bore chief responsibility for designing 
and carrying out needed improvements in their lending after having 
been guilty of being overgenerous with credit. He added that they 
failed to understand the hedge fund's risk profile, which included 
large positions in illiquid markets, and had relied too much on the 
fund's past performance and the reputation of its partners. ``Nevertheless,'' 
he added, ``prudential overseers have a responsibility to ensure that 
the processes that banks and securities firms utilize to manage risk 
are commensurate with the size and complexity of their portfolios 
and responsive to changes in financial market conditions.''
