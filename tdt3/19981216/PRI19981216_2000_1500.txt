Stocks fell, but cut their losses today. The Dow Jones Industrial 
surrendered 33 points today to 87.91. The NASDAQ gave up two points 
to 20.10. Investors are keeping a nervous eye on the Iraq crisis, 
and they've been following the impeachment proceedings in Congress. 
Liz George reports from our business desk in New York that, at least 
regarding impeachment, Wall Street economists are confident the markets 
will weather whatever news comes out of Washington. Although a major 
market reaction isn't out of the question, many on Wall Street feel 
the prospect of impeachment and the possibility of a Senate trial 
has been factored into stock prices already. John Ryding, senior economist 
with Bear Stearns, says the seven percent fall in the Dow since November 
can be attributed in part to Clinton concerns. This market has been 
stress tested beyond belief this year with Asia culminating to Russia, 
a 20 percent drop in the major averages. We've been through a lot, 
and I do not believe that an impeachment vote will undermine this 
market for more than a day or so. Moving away from the actual stock 
markets here, though, is strength of the dollar. That might be a bigger 
worry, the fact that the dollar falls, and, therefore, foreign investors 
run away. That's what I've been hearing. Investors make decisions 
about what they are investing in, and when they buy U.S. companies, 
they are not buying the U.S. president. They're buying the performance 
of an economy that is running at its best in 30 years. So, really, 
you think that the market is confident - the environment is confident 
enough to ride this thing out. I think so, and, after all, people 
worried about Nixon, and to Nixon, and the markets were terrible, 
and Nixon resigned, and there was all kinds of problems. This is not 
1974. We don't have oil prices at $30.00 a barrel. We have them at 
$10.00 a barrel. We have no inflation. We have a very well run economy. 
So I don't see it as being a crisis. But however rational the predictions 
are, the stock market is certainly capable of surprising everyone, 
and some are warning that an impeachment vote could provide investors 
with the excuse to behave in irrational ways. For THE WORLD, I'm Liz 
George in New York.
