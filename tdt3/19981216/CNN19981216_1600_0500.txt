This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Thursday morning. Windy conditions will continue in 
the west, particularly so in the southwest. The Santa Ana still blowing 
through southern California. It may weaken a bit during the day tomorrow. 
But still windy conditions and warm temperatures. Speaking of temperatures, 
cold air, frigid air, finally making its way down through the upper 
midwest behind a cold front that will move through the Great Lakes 
area. Some snowfall will slide across the northern plains states and 
into the upper midwest. Your forecast for high temperatures indicates 
that frigid air that I was telling you about, moving down into the 
Great Lakes area, and cold temperatures cover parts of the east, but 
still relatively mild throughout much of the west. The extended forecast, 
on Friday, snow showers possible in the Great Lakes area. You can 
see the cold air in the north. As we move on in through the weekend, 
on Saturday, snow showers are possible in the New England states, 
and as we head on into Sunday, snow possible in the Great Lakes area. 
Showers to the south of that, and you can see the very cold air finally 
making its way across the Canadian border. For more weather information,
