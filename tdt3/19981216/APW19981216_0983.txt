Israel has allowed the construction of housing in Jewish settlements 
in the West Bank to more than double, a peace group said Wednesday 
in an assessment likely to further anger frustrated Palestinians. 
There were 1,420 homes started in the settlements in the first half 
of 1998, the leader of Peace Now said in a statement. That was 136 
percent more than in the same period last year. In the second half 
of 1998, construction of 640 homes began in the settlements, 121 percent 
more than in the same period of 1997, Mossi Raz said. The figures 
were obtained from a report of the Israeli government's Central Bureau 
of Statistics, Raz said. Settlers have placed mobile homes on eight 
new sites in the vicinity of the settlements since U.S.-brokered negotiations 
revived the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians in October. 
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has called on the settlers to seize 
the hilltops to ensure that they do not come under Palestinian control. 
Peace Now said that its officials spotted 43 trailers on hilltops 
outside eight different settlements, during a helicopter flight. A 
ninth trailer park was reported by Israel Radio, near the settlement 
of Eli.
