The United States has used the United Nations as a justification of 
prior attacks and prior decisions to hold off. Don't go, it's not 
right. They have used the United Nations in the past. This move tonight, 
apparently against the wishes of some, several nations have complained. 
The security council is being hauled into an emergency session right 
now after this day was called a sad day by the secretary general Kofi 
Annan. NBC news correspondent rahama Ellis is in Manhattan with that 
story. It is the third meeting of the United Nations council and this 
one is called a formal session, meaning it is an open session. Cameras 
will be allowed. As you pointed out, it is expected that some of the 
15 members in the security council will expect -- will express their 
condemnation of the attack on Iraq by the United States and Britain. 
Not surprising. Among those condemning this, Russia, China, and France 
have expressed some concern about this attack. Russia, in fact, said 
the attack is a violation of the United Nations charter. The secretary 
general of the unite nations, Kofi Annan has not characterized the 
attack but he did express about it a short while ago. This is what 
he had to say. This is a sad day for the United Nations and for the 
world. My thoughts tonight with the people of Iraq and with the 307 
United Nations humanitarian workers who remain in the country. And 
with all others whose lives are in danger. And we understand that 
those 307 humanitarian workers are not Iraqis. There's some concern 
they cannot be flown out of Iraq. If they were to get out of the country, 
they would have to go through the desert. It's a 10-hour trip to go 
through the desert and is said to be dangerous. It is expected they 
will Hunker down. For Kofi Annan, it's a sad day because Brian as 
you know, he personally tried to stop strikes in the pass. Personally 
he went to Baghdad in February and was successful in avoiding a strike. 
He also helped in avoiding a strike last month in November. To this, 
as he said, it is a very sad day. At the U.N. tonight where they're 
going back to session. Thank you.
