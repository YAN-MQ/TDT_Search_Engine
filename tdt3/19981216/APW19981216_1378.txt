Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised Wednesday to take his peace 
policies to the electorate if he fails in an improbable bid next week 
to garner enough support for his proposals in parliament. Palestinians 
were furious with Netanyahu, describing the move as ``dangerous.'' 
An elections campaign would delay for months the implementation of 
the accords brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton in Wye, Maryland, 
in October. Describing the next, final settlement stage of negotiations 
with the Palestinians as ``crucial,'' Netanyahu outlined his conditions 
for lifting a freeze he has imposed on further territorial withdrawal. 
He said he wanted a swearing off of incitement to violence; a round-up 
of illegally-held weapons; a reduction in the Palestinian police force; 
and an end to declared aspirations to statehood or to a presence in 
Jerusalem. ``I intend to bring these decisions before members of the 
Knesset on Monday,'' Netanyahu said in a speech from his Likud party 
headquarters in Tel Aviv. ``If the majority won't be found to do this, 
I will initiate early elections in order to receive from the nation 
the mandate necessary to achieve a genuine peace,'' he said. A senior 
Netanyahu aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if elections 
were called, Netanyahu would suspend implementation of the Wye agreement 
until after the elections. Saeb Erekat, the top Palestinian negotiator, 
described the move as likely to ``have very dangerous effects on the 
peace process.'' ``He knows very well that the Palestinian side has 
fulfilled all its commitments,'' Erekat said. Clinton was in the region 
for three days this week to try and salvage Wye. His apparent failure 
frustrated the president and increased U.S.-Israel tensions. ``It 
would be unfortunate if there were a delay in the timetable,'' State 
Department spokesman James Rubin said in Washington on Wednesday,. 
``and we want the further redeployment to occur as soon as possible.'' 
Netanyahu called for the support of the opposition Labor party, although 
he stopped short of inviting them into a national unity government. 
Labor leader Ehud Barak ridiculed Netanyahu's offer. ``Netanyahu has 
decided to give in to extremism,'' Barak told Channel Two news. ``We're 
going to elections.'' Netanyahu also lacked the necessary support 
on his right to survive in parliament, where he faces a no-confidence 
vote on Monday. Hard-liners, who are loathe to cede further territory 
to the Palestinians, say they no longer believe Netanyahu when he 
promises not to make any further concessions. Netanyahu was applauded 
by the Likud faithful as he swore not to give up further territory 
unless the Palestinians met his conditions. ``These are the correct 
principles which are needed for the state of Israel, to ensure its 
future,'' he said. ``It is necessary to unite most of the (political) 
forces behind them.'' He accused hard-liners of wanting to ``rip up 
Oslo and Wye.'' The Oslo peace agreement was negotiated by Israel 
in 1993. Barak was already preparing for elections _ he was dining 
with top U.S. political consultants as Netanyahu spoke _ and it seemed 
as if Netanyahu's Likud was also resigned to the likelihood of a vote. 
``We've reached a situation in which we have no choice, and it's better 
to do it of our own initiative,'' Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told 
the Likud gathering. Other issues loomed for Netanyahu: he has failed 
to pass a budget this year, unemployment is relatively high, and his 
finance minister _ seen as one of the most loyal members of his cabinet 
_ has just resigned. In a scathing letter, Yaacov Neeman said he was 
leaving because the paralysis occasioned by the crisis in the peace 
process. ``These past few weeks have become a political race that 
have distracted all our attention from the true issues and challenges 
facing Israel,'' said Neeman, the second finance minister to go in 
Netanyahu's 2 1/2 year tenure. Nonetheless, the public would likely 
vote on the peace process in the elections, according to Joseph Alpher, 
a political analyst with the American Jewish Committee. ``It's the 
question of what will the different parties' approach be to territorial 
questions, the broader question of final status with the Palestinians, 
the fate of (Jewish) settlements and the nature of the state,'' he 
said. Another political scientist predicted that any ill will toward 
Netanyahu _ for alienating the Americans, and for fumbling the peace 
process _ could dissipate in the face of unease over the Palestinians. 
``If we see (Palestinian) terrorism, if we see a lack of Palestinian 
follow-through, continued incitement, it's not going to help Barak,'' 
Gerald Steinberg of Bar-Ilan University said. Elections would occupy 
the country for months. If Netanyahu resigns, or if he loses the no-confidence 
vote, the elections would be held in a minimum of 60 days. Senior 
Netanyahu advisor David Bar-Illan said that it was more likely Netanyahu 
would set an elections date sometime later than that, after consulting 
with Barak.
