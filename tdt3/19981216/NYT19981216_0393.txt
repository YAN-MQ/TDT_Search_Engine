An appeals court in Rome freed a Kurdish rebel leader from house arrest 
Wednesday, further inflaming a bitter diplomatic dispute between Italy 
and Turkey. The court determined that Italy had no grounds for detaining 
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, which has 
been fighting for self-determination in southeast Turkey. But Italy's 
prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, quickly said Ocalan would nevertheless 
be kept under police surveillance. After the ruling, Turkish officials, 
already furious with Italy for refusing to extradite Ocalan to Turkey, 
expressed outrage and renewed threats of economic retaliation. ``It 
will damage Turkish-Italian relations and international law,'' Defense 
Minister Ismet Sezgin told Turkish television reporters. Italy has 
refused to extradite Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on terrorism 
charges, because of a law that bans the extradition of prisoners to 
countries with a death penalty. Ocalan was arrested in Rome on Nov. 
12 while trying to enter Italy from Moscow on a false passport. Shortly 
after his arrest, he requested political asylum in Italy. Italy has 
so far been unable to persuade other European countries to take him 
off its hands. Germany, which issued a warrant for Ocalan's arrest 
in 1990 on homicide charges, declined to ask for his extradition, 
fearing repercussions from Turkey and from Turks living in Germany. 
Wednesday, both D'Alema and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Italy 
would either have to make Ocalan available for trial or expel him. 
Neither mentioned a third option: granting him political asylum. Early 
on, D'Alema, a former Communist, refused to rule out political asylum, 
a choice favored by some leftists in his coalition. But pressure from 
Turkey and the United States, which also regards Ocalan as a terrorist, 
has made political asylum less palatable. Human rights groups have 
also accused Ocalan of killing civilians. Lawyers representing Ocalan 
said that though he was free to leave Rome, he had decided to stay 
in the apartment where he had been held under house arrest and await 
a decision on political asylum. A commission of the Interior Ministry 
is expected to decide on asylum by the end of the month or early January.
