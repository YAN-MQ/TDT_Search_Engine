Traces of the virus that causes AIDS have been found in the semen 
of men who responded well to aggressive drug therapy, causing scientists 
to remind HIV-positive men to continue practicing safe sex. The discovery 
was first reported by The Associated Press last month when it was 
presented in Denver at the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases 
Society of America. It is now being published in Thursday's issue 
of the New England Journal of medicine. Researchers at Thomas Jefferson 
University in Philadelphia said they discovered the HIV provirus _ 
the genetic component of the AIDS virus _ still in the semen cells 
of four of seven men whose blood levels of HIV had been reduced to 
undetectable levels. In test-tube experiments, the scientists were 
able to grow the AIDS virus when they combined tiny provirus samples 
from the patients with blood from individuals who had never been infected. 
The study suggests that HIV-positive men whose health has dramatically 
improved after taking the AIDS drug cocktail might still be able to 
transmit the virus to others. The researchers described these provirus 
reservoirs as the ``Trojan horse'' of AIDS, and said they may lurk 
in the brain and retina cells, too. Determining how to eradicate these 
last traces is the ``endgame'' in the two-decade battle against AIDS, 
they said.
