More Republican lawmakers have come out in favor of impeaching President 
Clinton, dimming his hope for winning this week's vote in the House 
of Representatives. The lawmakers, who previously positioned themselves 
as undecided, announced their decision Tuesday, saying they just can't 
put the president above the law, and while Democrats are calling for 
an alternative punishment by way of censure and a $2-million fine, 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay says censure is not an option. There would 
be a significant number of Republicans that wouldn't because it's 
unconstitutional. It's too strong for the Democrats to vote for. Look 
at their censure they wrote in committee, and they had some of their 
members vote against it in committee. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt 
says the country will suffer if the impeachment vote goes through. 
I think if the House votes for impeachment -- and I hope we don't. 
I hope we do censure, but if we vote for impeachment, we're going 
to be in a new world the next day. The market could go south. We don't 
know how long this would take in the Senate. There's a certain procedure 
that's supposed to be followed. It could take months. The House votes 
on impeachment Thursday.
