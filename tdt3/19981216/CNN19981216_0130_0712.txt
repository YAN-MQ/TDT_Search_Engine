It has been said that nothing is certain, but death and taxes. But 
according to a congressional report, nearly 48 million Americans won't 
owe the IRS anything on April 15th. That's up 2 million people from 
last year. The increase is attributed in part to a new $400 per child 
tax credit. And the IRS says families with three or more children 
could be in for a Refund.
