Sentencing is scheduled today for Michael Carneal, the 15-year-old 
who went on a shooting spree at his school in Kentucky last December. 
He's expected to get life imprisonment with no chance of parole for 
25 years. That's the maximum penalty in Kentucky for a juvenile tried 
in an adult court. Carneal killed three classmates and wounded five 
others when he opened fire on a prayer group. He entered a plea of 
"guilty, but mentally ill."
