Ruth Abram's life is the story of how personal hurts grew into a museum 
that no one ever imagined. It started on a bus in Atlanta in the early 
1950s, when the Abram family maid, Rosa May Maddox, found a seat for 
young Ruth in the front, then moved to the back. In 1958, when Ruth 
was 13, she was told at her private Atlanta school that she could 
not join the cotillion because she was Jewish. Soon after, when the 
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. came to her home _ her father is Morris 
Abram, the legendary civil rights lawyer _ her parents said it was 
best not to tell her friends. Much later, when Ms. Abram found an 
Orthodox synagogue in Riverdale for the education of her children, 
the rabbi informed her that she was not Jewish at all. Why? Because 
Ms. Abram's mother, a one-time Methodist, had converted to Judaism 
only after Ms. Abram's birth. ``It sort of felt like I was being spun 
out into the universe, with no anchor,'' Ms. Abram said. So it is 
not a complete surprise that Ms. Abram, 53, is the founder and president 
of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, an institution that celebrates 
immigrants _ and which Ms. Abram sees as ``promoting the kind of tolerance 
that wouldn't permit the things I experienced.'' Last month, the decade-old 
museum _ housed in a five-story Orchard Street apartment building 
that from 1863 to 1935 was home to about 10,000 people from 25 countries 
_ became a ``national historic area'' and part of the National Park 
Service, meaning it can now apply for federal funds. The month before, 
the tenement building was designated a site of the National Trust 
for Historic Preservation. So far, it is the only Trust site in America 
that was not the home of someone rich or famous. (New York has two 
other Trust sites: Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate, and Lyndhurst, 
the home of Jay Gould, the financier and swindler.) Ms. Abram, needless 
to say, is in a very good mood. There is the prospect of more money, 
and visitors. There is also the realization that she is running the 
only tenement museum in the country, and helping to change the idea 
of what is important to preserve in America. Her goal, someday, is 
to have the museum be a stop for tourists after they see Ellis Island. 
``I always say there's this great question,'' she said. ```What happened 
afterward?'' Ms. Abram talked last week in the drafty kitchen of the 
tenement house, where she was gracious and appropriate. She came alive, 
though, during a one-hour tour of the museum _ she still gives one 
a week _ for a group of a dozen or so. (Whose families came, they 
told her when she asked, from England, China, Peru, Bangladesh, Russia, 
Ireland, Sweden and Poland.) Ms. Abram started in the building's entrance 
hall, in total darkness and under peeling paint, just as it looked 
in 1863. ``Welcome home!'' she said. ``Come with me.'' There followed 
a tour of the museum's permanent exhibit, opened last week, of the 
apartment of the Rogarshevskys, a family of Orthodox Jewish immigrants 
from Lithuania, who lived in three rooms re-created to look as they 
did on July 12, 1918, after Abraham Rogarshevsky, a 45-year-old garment 
presser, died of tuberculosis. There was medicine on the table by 
his bed, and bagels and bialys brought by friends. Ms. Abram calls 
the Rogarshevskys and their neighbors ``our urban pioneers.'' The 
Rogarshevsky apartment is the fourth of 20 in the building to be restored. 
The most recent in time is that of Adolpho and Rosaria Baldizzi, Catholic 
immigrants from Sicily, who lost their jobs during the Depression 
and were evicted in 1935. Ms. Abram told her tour that the Baldizzi 
apartment, re-created to look as it did on the day they were thrown 
out, was filled with authentic belongings taken from the apartment 
by the Baldizzis' daughter, Josephine, who lived there as a child 
and died a few months ago. Just before the apartment opened to the 
public, Ms. Abram said, Josephine came to see it. ``And she got right 
here, and she burst into tears,'' Ms. Abram said. Josephine Baldizzi 
requested only one change: That she be allowed to iron and neatly 
pack the clothes displayed in the suitcases on the apartment floor. 
``My mamma was fastidious!'' Josephine told Ms. Abram. ``Even for 
eviction, she never would have thrown things together in the haphazard 
way you packed!'' Ms. Abram lives on the Upper West Side, is married 
to Herbert Teitelbaum, a partner at Robinson Silverman, has two grown 
children, was a social worker and a women's rights organizer, graduated 
from Sarah Lawrence College, has a master's degree in American history 
from New York University and apologized for being boring in an interview. 
Her most vivid memory of Dr. King? ``What I remember more than anything 
is going to the Abyssinian Baptist Church to hear him preach, and 
what he was saying to the congregation was `support your children.' 
In other words, your children will be doing things you don't want, 
but there is a higher law. And it had an incredible effect on me. 
Because of all the places to try to change people's minds, to do that 
in your own community is harder.'' Ms. Abram's forbears were from 
Romania, Prussia, Ireland and Scotland. Despite her pedigree, she 
says her museum has made her feel as if she has ``come home'' __ to 
a place where Americans can ``meet our families before they became 
acceptable.''
