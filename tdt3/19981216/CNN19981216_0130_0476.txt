The Libyan parliament has given conditional approval to a plan to 
try the two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 
over lockerbie, Scotland. The British foreign office says it's "cautiously 
optimistic" that the decision eventually will lead to a trial. The 
United States and Britain have been strongly urging Libya to turn 
over the suspects for trial at the Hague, under Scottish law. 270 
people were killed in the bombing of flight 103.
