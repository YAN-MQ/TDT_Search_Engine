Furious and bitterly divided, House Republicans on Wednesday night 
postponed the impeachment vote against President Clinton for several 
days because of the bombing campaign against Iraq, even as more Republicans 
came out for impeachment, making the odds against the president look 
insurmountable. As the lameduck 105th Congress returned to the Capitol 
for evening party caucuses on impeachment, the House was left reeling 
at the almost surreal clash of crises. The first wave of bombs fell 
in Baghdad just minutes before the Republicans began their closed-door 
strategy session on impeachment. After more than three hours of raucous, 
angry and passionate debate on Wednesday night, Republicans, despite 
expressing deep suspicions of Clinton, finally heeded the call from 
the incoming House speaker, Robert Livingston of Louisiana, that the 
impeachment debate _ which had been scheduled for Thursday _ be postponed 
for a few days. ``We're going to defer,'' Livingston said after the 
caucus. However, he instructed members to stay in Washington on standby, 
for debate to resume ``possibly Friday, possibly Saturday, but within 
the near future.'' Earlier in the day, at least another eight Republicans 
declared they would vote to impeach Clinton, many of them the moderates 
whom Clinton most desperately needed to bring to his side. Their defection 
left any White House strategy to protect the president in shambles. 
Democrats said that even though it was still mathematically possible, 
they could no longer see how the president could avoid impeachment 
unless military action somehow shifted the mood. ``Unless this action 
has an unexpected effect, he's done,'' said a Democrat close to the 
effort to spare Clinton impeachment. But several Republicans said 
that the military action had only hardened the resolve in their party 
to impeach the president. ``If anything, suspicions around the timing 
of the action of Iraq has solidified support against the president,'' 
said Rep. Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican. THe Democrats, who 
are almost united against impeachment, rallied behind the president. 
Some even called for impeachment to be put off into the next Congress, 
when the Democrats will have five more seats in the House and Clinton 
might have more of a chance of avoiding being only the second president 
to be impeached. ``I don 't understand why this can't go over to the 
next Congress,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. Rep. Dick Gephardt, 
the House minority leader, said, ''There was a unanimous feeling in 
our caucus that it should not come up as long as our troops are in 
harm's way.'' Among Republicans, suspicions ran deep that Clinton 
had timed the military action as a tactic to save his presidency, 
and perhaps try to throw the vote into the next Congress. Rep. Roscoe 
Bartlett, R-Md., said of the Republican caucus, ''some people were 
incredulous'' about the motivation for the bombing. ``Emotion ran 
all the way from disgust to anger.'' ``There's a legitimate question 
in my mind about whether this is all planned,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, 
R-N.J. ``You know, the Wag the Dog scenario so it could be postponed 
into the next Congress,'' she said referring to the 1997 movie. Sen. 
Trent Lott, the majority leader, said he could not support ''this 
military action in the Persian Gulf at this time'' despite assurances 
that the strike was not connected to the looming impeachment vote. 
``The timing and the policy are subject to question,'' he said. Rep. 
Dick Armey, the House majority leader, said the fact that Republicans 
had doubts about the legitimacy of the military action showed Clinton 
was losing his ability to lead. ``If th president refuses to resign 
for the sake of the nation, I believe he should be impeached and face 
Senate trial.'' Livingston and Gephardt sought to strike _ for a fleeting 
moment _ a bipartisan note. They issued a joint statement supporting 
Clinton's decision to take military action against Iraq. Both political 
parties went straight from their respective meetings to the House 
floor for a briefing by the president's entire national security team. 
The outgoing speaker, Newt Gingrich, coordinated with Cabinet officials 
to organize that session while Livingston helped conduct the Republican 
caucus on impeachment. At the White House, Joe Lockhart, the press 
secretary, dismissed any suggestion that Clinton was using his powers 
as commander in chief to avoid becoming the first president to be 
impeached in 130 years. ``The president of the United States makes 
national security decisions based on the best interest of the United 
States,'' he said.
