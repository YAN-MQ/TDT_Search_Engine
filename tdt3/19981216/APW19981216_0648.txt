Amid heavy police security, the trial of two policemen accused of 
taking part in the fatal beating of a 13-year-old boy opened Wednesday 
in northern Poland. The death of Przemek Czaja in January sparked 
three nights of rioting in the Baltic coast city of Slupsk that injured 
101 people and caused 200,000 zlotys (dlrs 57,000) in damage. Police 
erected a temporary fence around the provincial courthouse in Koszalin, 
436 kilometers (260 miles) northwest of Warsaw, for the trial. Entry 
was restricted to those with special passes. A former policeman, identified 
only as Dariusz W., is charged with deliberately causing injury and 
unintentionally causing Czaja's death. If convicted, he faces up to 
15 years in prison. Another policeman, identified as Robert K., faces 
up to five years in prison if convicted of failing to help the injured 
boy, who died at the scene. Both defendants pleaded innocent. Police 
initially said the boy died after falling and hitting his head on 
a post, but an autopsy said the fatal wound was caused by a blow from 
a weapon like a police baton. Czaja was injured after attending a 
basketball game in Slupsk. Police said they were reacting to hooliganism, 
but witnesses said Czaja and others only were jaywalking when police 
attacked them.
