The home building boom takes a breather. I'm John metaxas in New York 
and this is "Dollars & Sense." The Congress department says construction 
starts fell 2.7% in November. They're still in a pretty good uptrend. 
Down significantly from before. So we've got low interest rates and 
good fundamentals in housing and the home builders' report was out 
yesterday and had strong numbers in it in terms of expectations for 
the future, current conditions for the market, so we have to put it 
in some kind of perspective.
