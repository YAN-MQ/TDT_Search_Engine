If your holiday plans include feasting, as they probably do, you may 
be interested in the latest weight loss research. Holly Firfer reports, 
scientists are on the trail of the chemical cues that control our 
eating habits. As the fight against fat continues, researchers have 
pinpointed another hormone that could control and possibly reduce 
your appetite. The melanin-controlling hormone, or McH, is released 
into the system to tell you it's time to eat. When this hormone is 
blocked, the desire to eat is dramatically reduced. In a study published 
in the journal "nature," researchers genetically engineered mice without 
McH, and found they eat much less. It's 25% leaner than its brothers 
and sisters, and that mouse also seems to have a higher metabolic 
rate. So it also seems to burn off more energy. So, why do we need 
McH? It is really a function of survival. Animals in the wild often 
cannot find food for days. But, this hormone fuels their desire to 
forage, and keeps them eating once they do find food. Although the 
research is in mice, scientists say, this finding may be helpful in 
treating obesity in humans because the influence of McH on the brain 
is the same in both mice and people. The ideal patient would be someone 
who has an increased appetite. Because presumably, if we were blocking 
the action of McH, we would be blocking the motivation to open the 
refrigerator door and start eating. Researchers report no Negative 
side effects due to the absence of mch. The usual problems associated 
with being too thin, such as longevity, fertility and lack of energy, 
were not found. Holly Firfer, CNN.
