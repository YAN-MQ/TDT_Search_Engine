The rival of extreme-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen 
issued what amounted to a declaration of war on Wednesday, openly 
contesting the leadership of the party that appears irreparably divided. 
``The National Front is not family property,'' said Bruno Megret, 
Le Pen's former top lieutenant. ``If Jean-Marie Le Pen doesn't come 
to his senses, we'll have to give him a push,'' Megret told a crowd 
of 400. Earlier Wednesday, Le Pen fired 14 departmental secretaries 
-- all key allies of Megret, naming Le Pen backers to the posts. Megret's 
party membership was suspended on Friday, along with that of four 
Megret allies. The National Front said Wednesday that Megret must 
appear Tuesday before a disciplinary council along with his four cohorts. 
Le Pen has accused them of disobedience. The crisis within the National 
Front is centered on Megret's call for a special party congress to 
heal divisions -- a move Le Pen sees as a trap to unseat him. On Tuesday, 
Megret's backers announced they will hold the party congress Jan. 
24. Megret reiterated Wednesday that the congress would go forth, 
and added that he plans to become a candidate for the Marseille mayor's 
post. ``After serving as the guarantor of unity, Jean-Marie Le Pen 
today is the divider of our movement,'' Megret said. The understated 
Megret, 47, has until now allowed his backers to speak so forthrightly, 
while he donned the role of peacemaker in the face of the fiery 70-year-old 
Le Pen. A poll published Wednesday showed that the National Front 
could lose up to half its voting bloc over the feud. The anti-immigration 
party, accused of racism and anti-Semitism, traditionally takes up 
to 15 percent of the vote in elections. The Sofres poll, conducted 
for the Nouvel Observateur magazine, said 36 percent of National Front 
voters remain loyal to Le Pen, while 33 percent back Megret. If Le 
Pen and Megret present separate lists for next spring's European elections, 
41 percent of National Front supporters would vote for another party 
and 12 percent would abstain, the survey said. No margin of error 
was given. Three hundred National Front supporters were questioned 
in the survey.
