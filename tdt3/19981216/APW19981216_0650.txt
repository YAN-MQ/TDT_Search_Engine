Palestinians have a ``natural right'' to declare a state next May, 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told reporters in Cairo on Wednesday. 
``It is known that the Oslo agreement, which we signed at the White 
House under the supervision of President Clinton, had five years as 
a transitional period. This period ends on May 4, 1999 and, after 
that, it is our natural right to declare our independent state,'' 
Arafat said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned 
that any unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state would kill 
the peace process. A summit between Arafat, Clinton and Netanyahu 
on the Israeli-Gaza Strip border on Tuesday failed to produce an Israeli 
commitment to withdraw on schedule from more West Bank land. Palestinians 
have accused Israel of wrecking Clinton's bid to salvage the Wye River 
interim peace accord that the president helped to negotiate in October. 
Arafat was in Egypt to brief President Hosni Mubarak on U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's visit to the region.
