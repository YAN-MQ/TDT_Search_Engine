The European Parliament set the stage Wednesday for a de facto confidence 
vote in the European Commission over perceived flaws in its anti-fraud 
policies. Ahead of Thursday's vote, the 626-member parliament was 
split on whether to endorse the 1996 accounts as finalized by the 
EU executive amid questions of whether it spent that budget wisely. 
EU Budget Commissioner Erkki Liikanen argues he has met all demands 
for tighter financial controls. Yet many in the parliament deny he 
has gone far enough to guarantee regular fraud reports, to keep national 
justice officials informed of investigations or to create an independent 
anti-fraud office. A vote withholding approval of the 1996 budget 
was first planned for last March, but the Commission was given a reprieve. 
If carried it would be seen as damaging to the Commission's standing 
and could be followed by a formal no-confidence vote. Under the EU 
treaty, the parliament can only fire the entire 20-member EU executive 
panel, not individual commissioners. The European Commission is in 
Strasbourg where the parliament is holding its monthly plenary session. 
Officials said Commission President Jacques Santer was planned to 
hold a press conference after Thursday's vote, scheduled for 9.30 
am (0830GMT). The Socialist Group, the largest faction in the European 
parliament, is divided. Two thirds are in favor of a discharge, a 
third is against. The European People's Party, the second largest 
faction, is also divided. The European Union has long been hounded 
by reports and allegations of fraud. On Nov. 17, the EU Court of Auditors 
estimated fraud and financial irregularities amounted to 5 percent 
of the EU's 1997 budget of 83 billion European currency units (dlrs 
97 billion) budget. Although fraud and financial mismanagement falls 
under the EU heading, 85 percent of it is handled by national authorities 
on behalf of the European Commission. In recent weeks, there has been 
a stream of new allegations aimed at the Commission involving financial 
mismanagement and cronyism in its humanitarian aid and vocational 
training programs.
