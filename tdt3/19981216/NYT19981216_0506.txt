Republicans in Congress were bitterly divided Wednesday night over 
the timing of the air strikes against Iraq, and Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott fiercely attacked President Clinton's policy. After a meeting 
with House Republicans, Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana, the speaker-designate, 
called on Republicans and Democrats ``to support our troops now that 
they're deployed.'' Clearly skeptical of the timing of the attack, 
Livingston said, ``we'll leave that to the best judgment of the American 
people.'' Republican lawmakers wrestled with competing instincts: 
the urge to support American troops and an American president when 
bombs are falling, and a thinly-disguised anger that the attack had 
come on the eve of an impeachment vote. That led to surreal scenes, 
like Livingston's news conference in the Capitol rotunda, with comments 
about praying for the troops mingled with a promise that the impeachment 
vote would be put off for only a matter of days. That conflict extended 
beyond Washington, with Republicans like Gov. Christie Whitman of 
New Jersey also tempering her condemnation of President Saddam Hussein 
of Iraq with her criticism of Clinton and the timing of the attack. 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is on the Armed Services Committee, 
said of Clinton, ``Obviously, there will be those who will question 
his motives and timing. He will receive significant support because 
it's pretty obvious that Saddam Hussein is neither complying nor cooperating'' 
with international arms inspectors. But in an extraordinary rebuke 
of the president's foreign policy, Lott, said he opposed the air assault 
on suspected Iraqi chemical, nuclear and biological weapons sites, 
arguing that the attacks were ineffective. ``I cannot support this 
military action in the Persian Gulf at this time,'' Lott said in a 
statement, infuriating the White House. ``Both the timing and the 
policy are subject to question.'' For months, Lott has criticized 
the administration for failing to take more aggressive steps to topple 
Saddam. Under pressure from Congress, Clinton enacted the Iraq Liberation 
Act in October, which earmarked $8 million to support Iraqi political 
opposition. But in a letter to Clinton on Wednesday, Lott and five 
other Senate Republicans said only $58,000 of that money has been 
spent. ``I will support serious and sustained action but will oppose 
action that does not accomplish our larger strategic goal,'' Lott 
said. But even as Lott raised objections, House Republicans were planning 
to vote Thursday on a resolution of support for the troops in the 
Persian Gulf. The core of the debate among Republicans, who were suddenly 
chastened by the spectacle of impeaching the commander-in-chief while 
he launched one of the biggest military strikes since the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War, was over the timing and motivations behind the aerial bombardment 
that began on Wednesday night. ``It's obvious they're trying to do 
everything they can to postpone the vote in order to get as much leverage 
as they can,'' said Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York, a former marine 
who is chairman of the House Rules Committee, said on CNN. ``For him 
to do this at this unbelievable time is just outrageous.'' Rep. Tillie 
Fowler of Florida, the fifth-ranking Republican and a member of the 
House National Security Committee, said: ``I'm very suspicious of 
the timing.'' Many Republicans accused the president of bombing rogue 
nations or terrorists when he was in political binds in the past. 
The last time the United States launched air strikes, said Rep. Spencer 
Bachus of Alabama, they ``destroyed a drug store in the Sudan and 
two camels in Afghanistan.'' Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina 
put it bluntly: ``The trust level is low.'' But several other Republicans, 
many of whom are vocal critics of the White House, set aside partisan 
differences, and defended the president. ``He has our full support 
as long as he's president to take any action he deems necessary,'' 
said Rep. John Mica of Florida. ``I don't think they conflict at all.'' 
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York, who announced Wednesday that he 
would vote for impeachment, said: ``I really do believe that in sensitive 
foreign policy issues, partisanship does stop at the water's edge.'' 
Rep. John Edward Porter of Illinois, another moderate Republican, 
echoed similar sentiments: ``The president is the president. I respect 
the office and I respect the judgments that have to be made in regards 
to Iraq and the situation there.'' Sen. John Chafee, a Rhode Island 
Republican on the Intelligence Committee, said: ``It is not for anyone 
to say that there's a linkage between the President's problems with 
impeachment on the one hand and the bombing of Iraq on the other. 
This military operation has been planned for some time.'' Democrats 
quickly threw their support to the president. Rep. Dick Gephardt of 
Missouri and Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, the House and Senate 
Democratic leaders, said in a joint statement: ``The president has 
made the correct decision to undertake military action against Iraq 
at this time. Any delay would have given Saddam Hussein time to reconstitute 
his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and undermine support for 
our efforts.'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a decorated Vietnam veteran, 
said Wednesday that no one should question the ``legitimacy'' of Clinton's 
decision to bomb Iraq. ``I am confident that every reasonable member 
of the United States Congress and reasonable people of this country 
will understand the legitimacy of this moment,'' he said. Some Republicans 
went further: Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York called the bombing ``outrageous.'' 
But others seemed to accept that the domestic crisis needed to take 
a back seat to foreign policy. ``We need to make Iraq observe international 
law, submit to weapons inspections and abide by U.N. resolutions,'' 
said Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, who held a town-hall meeting 
this week so his constituents could help him decide how to vote on 
impeachment. ``All Americans need to support our troops abroad, and 
Congress needs to delay the vote on impeachment.'' Democratic officials 
said that the blame for the unfortunate timing of the bombings lay 
with Saddam Hussein, not Clinton. ``It is no coincidence that Saddam 
took these actions this week,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New 
Jersey, referring to Saddam's barring of U.N. inspectors from weapons 
sites, ``with Ramadan approaching and with the current political situation 
in the House. But he miscalculated, as he has done with the House 
before, underestimating the American will to act.'' Rep. and Senator-elect 
Charles Schumer of New York echoed Torricelli's sentiments that Saddam 
had forced Clinton's hand. ``Under the circumstances,'' he said, ``the 
United States and her allies had no choice but to act.''
