U.S. forces in the Gulf have been put on high alert. The U.S. Defense 
Department spokesman Ken Bacon says intelligence information that 
indicates a terrorist attack may be attempted is being taken very 
seriously. We believe that we have significant credible intelligence 
suggesting the possibility of an imminent terrorist action in the 
Middle Eastern region. Mr. Bacon says U.S. military commanders in 
the Gulf are taking steps to reduce the exposure of troops to a possible 
attack.
