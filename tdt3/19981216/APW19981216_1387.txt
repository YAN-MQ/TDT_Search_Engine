Facing a deadlock in parliament, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
promised Wednesday to call early elections if lawmakers fail to endorse 
the Mideast peace deal in a vote next week. Palestinians were outraged 
by the move, as an election campaign would delay the implementation 
of the accords brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton in Wye, Maryland, 
in October. By holding elections more than a year ahead of schedule, 
Netanyahu would be seeking public approval for his peacemaking strategies 
that have paralyzed his fragile right-wing coalition and infuriated 
an opposition that accuses him of repeated delays. Netanyahu may be 
forced to call early elections because he lacks the necessary support 
to survive a no confidence vote set for Monday. His efforts to please 
hard-liners in his coalition have paralyzed the peace process. Describing 
the next, final settlement stage of negotiations with the Palestinians 
as ``crucial,'' Netanyahu outlined his conditions for lifting a freeze 
he has imposed on further territorial withdrawal. He said he wanted 
the Palestinians to swear off inciting violence; a roundup of illegal 
weapons; a reduction in the Palestinian police force; and an end to 
declared aspirations to statehood or to a presence in Jerusalem. ``I 
intend to bring these decisions before members of the Knesset on Monday,'' 
Netanyahu said in a speech broadcast live on all media from his Likud 
party headquarters in Tel Aviv. ``If the majority won't be found to 
do this, I will initiate early elections in order to receive from 
the nation the mandate necessary to achieve a genuine peace,'' he 
said. A senior Netanyahu aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said that if elections were called, Netanyahu would suspend implementation 
of the Wye agreement until after the elections. Saeb Erekat, 9th graf
