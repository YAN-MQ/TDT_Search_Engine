Asian markets were generally higher today, buoyed by the U.S. stock 
market. Tokyo shares finished with a modest gain of.6 percent, the 
first advance in five sessions. Japan's current account surplus shrank 
nearly 13 percent in October over September as a rise in the trade 
surplus was more than offset by a growing deficit in services. The 
figure, however, is a positive sign for the Japanese government which 
is concerned about U.S. pressure on Japan to reduce its surplus and 
boost domestic demand. South Korea's economic contraction will, according 
to an economic research group, slow in the fourth quarter this year 
by nearly 6 percent as exports recover and companies build up inventories. 
The Korea Development Institute says the country's worst recession 
since the 1950s is now expected to end about a year after it began. 
The economy should actually expand.8 percent in the first six months 
of 1999. Analyst David Kim of Seoul cautions that, by 1997 standards, 
any expansion should not be considered a recovery. We've had a catastrophic 
fall in 1998, and since the numbers from 1999 will be compared with 
those -- against those in 1998, we are starting with a significantly 
lower base. So, even if we do not grow and go flat, it will not be 
a negative growth. Mr. Kim prefers to call forecasts of growth next 
year a bottoming out of the South Korean recession.
