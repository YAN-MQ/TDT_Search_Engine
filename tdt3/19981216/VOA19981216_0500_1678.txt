I haven't done mine, but a lot of people have. They've sent out their 
Christmas cards already. Well, in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, a man 
named Mike Pagel came up with a different kind of Christmas greeting. 
A holiday greeting, as it were. He's a farmer who got an idea recently 
while he was plowing his pasture. First, he thought he'd plow a letter 
G on the field in the style adopted by the Green Bay Packers football 
team. Wisconsin is Green Bay Packers Land, and a lot of people really 
go nuts over that team this time of the year. Mr. Pagel decided the 
furor over the football season was overdone, so his thoughts turned 
to Christmas and the holiday season. One hour and five letters later, 
after some work with the plow, Mr. Pagel's land in Wisconsin Rapids 
contained a universal message for the holiday season. The word "peace." 
I wonder if I could see that from the shuttle.
