For the very busy, a virtual assistant can be helpful, even if the 
three most widely available are all a little tricky to use. Choosing 
among them depends on how much you are willing to pay, what features 
make sense to you and, for now, where you live. Webley and Portico 
operate nationally with toll-free numbers; long-distance phone charges 
are included in their prices. The cost depends mostly on how _ and 
how much _ you use them. Webley's basic service fee is $9.95 a month, 
plus 15 cents for each minute of use. Portico has a setup fee of $50, 
and its packages range from $19.95 a month for 60 minutes of use to 
$149.95 for 1,300 minutes. Portico charges 15 to 20 cents for each 
additional minute. That's a good deal for cellular phone users who 
would otherwise pay additional charges for calls outside their service 
area. Wildfire Tries New Tactic Wildfire, once available only through 
office systems or for individuals at $150 a month, is fighting its 
new competition by trying to sell Network Wildfire through telecommunications 
carriers. Pacific Bell Wireless is the only United States carrier 
so far to test-market Network Wildfire, just beginning this month 
in Los Angeles. (Network Wildfire is also available in Canada through 
Bell Mobility, just in the Toronto area.) For customers who sign up 
for a cellular phone service plan for $49 monthly or more, Pac Bell 
offers Wildfire for $20 more. That includes four basic features (voice-activated 
dialing, voice-controlled voice mail, call routing and address book) 
and 300 weekday minutes and 1,000 weekend minutes of both cellular 
and Wildfire use. (All three services offer demonstrations and free 
trials: see www.wildfire.com, www.portico.net and www.webley.com.) 
Not So Easy as It Sounds Do not expect to simply dial in and start 
talking. The services recognize only a standard glossary of words 
and short, imperative sentences like ``open my mailbox.'' Even at 
that, all three regularly misunderstand callers who are trying to 
track down a user. Callers can resort to touch-tone options, but how 
many misunderstandings does it take before an important caller gives 
up? And since Webley and Portico charge subscribers by the minute, 
confusion between the caller and the system makes for a much higher 
bill. The longer your Irish cousin spends on the line trying to make 
Webley respond to his brogue, the more it costs. May I Interrupt? 
Portico and Webley offer the most realistic experience of human conversation, 
primarily because they allow you to interrupt the computer at any 
time. By contrast, Wildfire still feels a lot like voice mail. ``She'' 
forces users to wait for a beep signaling their turn to talk and constantly 
repeats the user's response options. (You may want to strangle her 
after hearing Wildfire repeat ``What's it say, throw it away, next 
item,'' for the 17th time when checking a long list of voice mail 
messages). Still, the voices are what turn all three into services 
instead of mere machines. Wildfire and Portico use a friendly but 
assertive female voice, giving the impression of an executive secretary. 
Webley's persona of a butler quickly conveys customer service, but 
the fake British accent may wear out its welcome quickly. Webley plans 
to remedy that early next year by allowing the option of an American 
male or female voice. Portico will likewise introduce six more voice 
variations by the end of 1999.
