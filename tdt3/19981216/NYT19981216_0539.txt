The bedeviled Sunbeam Corp. turned in yet another poor financial performance 
Wednesday, reporting a $587 million loss for the first nine months 
of this year. While the company said the final quarter should show 
some improvement, it also indicated the hemorrhaging has not stopped. 
After restating its financial results in October to adjusted figures 
for six quarters through the first three months of this year, Sunbeam 
Wednesday reported results for the second and third quarters, which 
reflected steep revenue drops and losses. The maker of Sunbeam and 
Oster brand blenders and toasters lost $344.1 million, or $3.41 a 
share in the second quarter, including $213 million in primarily one-time 
charges. Revenue totaled $578.5 million, compared with $271.4 million 
in the prior year. But excluding revenue gains largely from three 
recently acquired companies, sales declined 23 percent to $202.2 million. 
For the third quarter, the company lost $188.9 million, or $1.88 a 
share, including $89 million in primarily one-time charges. That compared 
with earnings of $24.8 million, or 28 cents a share a year earlier. 
Revenue totaled $496 million, compared with $286.8 million a year 
earlier. But excluding revenue gains largely from the three acquired 
companies, sales declined 42 percent to $162.6 million. The losses 
in those periods were far worse than the already negatively revised 
estimate of analysts polled by First Call. The company had been expected 
to lose 30 cents a share in the second quarter and 12 cents a share 
in the third quarter. Despite the performance, Sunbeam shares rose 
25 cents, or 4.4 percent, Wednesday to $5.9275. Investor reaction 
appeared to indicate some confidence that the company's new management 
had adequately assessed its problems _ a retail pipeline jammed with 
too much product, confusion about the businesses' financial position 
and headline-grabbing management turmoil. Sunbeam has been in crisis 
since Albert Dunlap, its once-celebrated chief executive, delivered 
several quarters of unexpected earnings disappointments last year 
and was ousted in June. But even with the favorable market reaction, 
analysts expressed caution about the outlook. ``They are by no means 
out of the woods yet,'' said William Steele, an analyst who follows 
Sunbeam for Buckingham Research Group. For the nine months ended Sept. 
30, Sunbeam's lost $587.1 million, or $6.12 a share, compared with 
earnings of $28.8 million, or $0.33 a share in the the previous year. 
The 1998 period includes $339 million in various charges related, 
in large part, to excess inventory, early debt payment and the issuance 
of warrants. ``These losses provide a clear indication of the measures 
necessary to stabilize Sunbeam's businesses and get the company back 
on track,'' said Jerry Levin, president and chief executive. Even 
so, ``the losses are much larger than expected,'' said Nicholas Heymann, 
an analyst who follows the company for Prudential Securities. For 
the nine months, Sunbeam's revenue totaled $1.3 billion, compared 
with $810.7 million in the prior year. Excluding the revenue gains 
this year largely from the three companies Sunbeam acquired in the 
spring, revenue declined 24 percent to $594 million. ``The good news 
is the company is beginning to manage cash flow and used substantially 
less than might be thought likely in the third quarter,'' Heymann 
said. The company also said it had worked down $80 million in excess 
inventory at the retail level and had begun to pare its own surplus 
of products, though management did not disclose the amount of unsold 
grills and electric blankets that were still in warehouses.
