The body of Philip True, Mexico correspondent for the San Antonio 
Express-News, was found Wednesday in a remote ravine in western Mexico, 
17 days after True hiked into the mountains on a reporting trek, authorities 
said. True, who was 50, apparently fell to his death. ``There has 
been no autopsy at this point, but it appears that he died of a fall,'' 
said Steve Morrisseau, a U.S. embassy spokesman. The body was spotted 
Wednesday morning from a small plane, one of several army aircraft 
sweeping the area, military officials told The Associated Press. True, 
an experienced hiker, entered the mountains on the border of the Jalisco 
and Nayarit states on Nov. 29 to photograph and write about the region's 
Huichol Indians. He called family and friends several times by telephone 
from villages along the way, but the communication ended on Dec. 7. 
His family reported him missing on Dec. 10.
