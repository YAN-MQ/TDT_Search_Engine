And good evening to you from Capitol Hill where just a few hours from 
now we were supposed to be on the air reporting to you the developments 
as the house took up four articles of impeachment against the president. 
Instead tonight, we are bringing you NBC news continuing live coverage 
of an attack currently under way on Iraq halfway across the world 
from here. It started about 5:00 eastern time this afternoon as you 
look at a live picture of downtown Iraq where day is about to break 
from our vantage point at the ministry of information. The president 
tonight has said he had no choice, it was an unanimous vote of his 
national security team. Others, his critics here in Washington are 
openly accusing him of trying to infect the impeachment process by 
using the U.S. military. We want to begin tonight at the Pentagon. 
Our NBC news Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski joining us for 
the anatomy of this attack. The air strikes began without warning 
but came as no surprise. Iraqi anti-aircraft were ready and lit up 
the skies as the attack began. Scores of unmanned cruise miss Sills, 
a deadly barrage to rain down on Baghdad and keen military targets 
about Iraq. Today we commenced an operation. Operation desert fox 
that includes American and British forces to carry out military strikes 
aimed at degrading the very capabilities that Saddam has tried to 
preserve. U.S. officials tell NBC news the first wave was launched 
4k P.M. eastern time by four naval ships in the gulf and be-52's hundreds 
of miles from the targets. They were intended to get the chemical 
and biological weapons. Tarts include anything that could deliver 
the weapons such as missile plants and airstrips. U.S. forces in the 
gulf are packing plenty of firepower. The aircraft carriere enterprise 
and eight other warships are armed. Four B-1 bombers and 14 B-52's 
loaded with 16 air launch missiles. Within hours, more than 100 additional 
U.S. warplanes including f155 stealth bombers will head to the gulf, 
a campaign that will continue to pound Iraq for three or four more 
days. Tonight William Cohen says air strikes will continue until they 
achieve their objective to degrade Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass 
destruction. That's an open-ended commitment that could keep U.S. 
forces on alert in the gulf indefinitely. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC news, 
the Pentagon.
