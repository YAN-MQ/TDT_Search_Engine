This week on the "cold and flu report" -- the influenza virus may 
be in trouble. A new study published in the journal "Lancet" shows 
the experimental drug xanamavir is an effective treatment for all 
strains of the flu. It cuts the duration of the flu infection by one 
to two and a half days. It also lessens the symptoms. Xanamavir has 
few side effects and it needs to be taken in the first 30 hours after 
symptoms begin to have maximum effectiveness. Another experimental 
flu drug, gs-4104, appears to work fairly well. Current treatments 
for the flu only work against the A-strain and sometimes have unpleasant 
side effects.
