Well, of course, Mr. Pagel never would have been writing out in that 
field if it hadn't been for the people who first devised writing, 
and a German archaeologist says he thinks he's learning a little bit 
more about just who those people were who first devised writing and 
why it is they did it. He thinks that he has found new records that 
reveal the earliest form of writing, which were tax records for a 
king who ruled in Egypt 5,300 years ago. The discovery comes from 
Gunter Dryer who is the head of German -- the German Archaeological 
Institute, and he says that his discovery predates writings by the 
Samarians of Ancient Iraq. That was about 5,000 years old. Mr. Gunter 
found the writing, and he's decided that it is tax records, and he 
thinks that the need to keep track of taxes and trades was what pushed 
people to write, not any sort of artistic genius or religious need.
