One of 13 fugitive soldiers accused of violating human rights in the 
1980s has returned home to face trial _ or a possible amnesty. Capt. 
Billy Joya arrived Tuesday aboard a commercial flight from Costa Rica 
and went immediately to the office of Judge Rita Nunez, escorted by 
more than 20 police. Her questioning of him continued on Wednesday. 
``I am happy to again be in Honduras, where I will face the legal 
situation,'' he told reporters at the airport here. ``I am tired... 
and I come voluntarily to face justice in my country, where I am confident 
I will be tried in a fair way.'' He is accused of torture and attempted 
murder of six university students in 1982, as well as of leading a 
1982 army attack on the Tegucigalpa residence of Oscar Reyes Baca, 
former director of the journalism school at the National Autonomous 
University. Reyes Baca was held prisoner for five months before fleeing 
to the United States. His residence was looted and then destroyed 
by tank fire. An appeals court ruled on Tuesday that three amnesties 
granted in 1987, 1990 and 1991 to participants in Honduras' guerrilla 
conflicts of the 1980s should apply to Joya and other fugitive soldiers. 
The Supreme Court is due to accept or reject that ruling within 20 
days. Joya had been living with his wife and four children in a suburb 
of Sevilla, Spain, for the past two years. He spent Tuesday night 
in a room at the army's First Military Battalion on the outskirts 
of Tegucigalpa. A court ordered the arrest of Joya and nine other 
offices of the counterinsurgency Battalion 316 in 1995. Another 16 
officers were later accused of crimes against humanity in June 1996. 
Three of those are fugitives. The armed forces have admitted protecting 
soldiers who have evaded the courts and paying them salaries of up 
to dlrs 1,000 a month, along with granting use of cars, drivers and 
bodyguards. A 1993 government report accused Battalion 316 of functioning 
as a death squad between 1979 and 1989 and of causing the disappearance 
_ apparently by death _ of at least 184 suspected leftists.
