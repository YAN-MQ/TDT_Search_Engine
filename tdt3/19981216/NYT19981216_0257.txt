Given how screen-saturated our world has become, it shouldn't be a 
surprise that the family car now comes with a video monitor so that 
back-seat passengers don't have to rely on the passing landscape _ 
plain old reality _ for entertainment. The recent commercial for an 
Oldsmobile minivan, the first car with factory-installed video entertainment, 
was just an affirmation of the inevitable. Made by the Leo Burnett 
advertising agency in Chicago, the commercial for the Oldsmobile Silhouette 
Premiere is a Spielbergian appeal to the emotions. The spot begins 
with a string of title shots from beloved movies: ``Gone With the 
Wind,'' ``Casablanca'' and ``National Velvet.'' Then the edge of a 
remote control slips into the frame. The view shifts, and we see a 
toy dinosaur and a robot resting on a carpeted floor between two diminutive 
pairs of feet. Then, as we watch a close-up of a freckle-faced boy 
and girl laughing with delight, followed by a shot of little hands 
digging into a sack of popcorn, the announcer declares, ``Movies take 
us places beyond our imagination.'' Slowly, the camera pulls back 
to reveal that the movie screen is actually mounted on the ceiling 
of a minivan. The Hollywood scene of horses cantering through grassy 
meadows is superimposed on a spectacular Western landscape viewed 
through the windshield. ``Now, you can take those movies to places 
you never thought possible,'' the announcer proclaims. While television 
sets have long been featured in custom vans and limousines, they may 
soon become a routine component of family cars. ``What we've been 
trying to do with Silhouette is meet the needs of the individual passengers 
in the car,'' said Marcus Helman, assistant brand manager for the 
Oldsmobile minivans. ``We wanted to provide all passengers with something 
to do on the road.'' Thin LCD screens, like the ones mounted on the 
backs of airliner seats, are becoming more affordable, and car makers 
are desperately looking for ways to distinguish their minivan from 
all the other Caravans, Odysseys and Windstars on the market. Nissan, 
for instance, is now offering to throw in a $995 floor-mounted video 
console free with the purchase of a Quest minivan. Audiovox, the Long 
Island concern that manufactures the Nissan console, also sells a 
$2,000 Mobile Video Flipdown Pod, much like the one shown in the Oldsmobile 
commercial, that can be installed in almost any car. Tom Malone, the 
group vice president for Audiovox's mobile electronics division, insists 
that ``rear-seat entertainment is the hottest category we have by 
a long shot.'' If you believe Malone, it won't be long before we see 
cars parked on New York City streets with hand-lettered signs taped 
on the windows that say, ``No TV.'' ``No question,'' Malone said. 
``Now that these vehicles are so comfortable, the only luxury missing 
is in-vehicle entertainment.'' Dennis Troy, a salesman for Movin On 
Sounds and Security, a dealer of Audiovox products, arrived at my 
door in a Lincoln Navigator, a sport utility vehicle so large that 
it could swallow a Honda Civic whole. ``It's my showroom,'' he informed 
me. Troy demonstrated how a thin screen was secreted in an oval ceiling 
panel, where another car might have a dome light. The video deck was 
tucked away under an armrest between the front seats. And the Nintendo 
system was stashed behind the back-seat armrest. I hopped in the back 
and, parked on a noisy Manhattan avenue, sank into the Lincoln's plush 
Leatherette seat and played Nintendo's Chopper Attack, while Troy 
cranked up the sub-woofer so that the game's sound effects made the 
whole car rumble. Sealed inside this big car, nestled in the virtual 
world, I was as oblivious to my surroundings as one of those freckle-faced 
kids in the Oldsmobile advertisement. Actually, what's intriguing 
about the Silhouette Premiere commercial is that it tries to have 
it both ways. Late in the 60-second spot, Mom, seated in the front 
seat, swivels around and mouths ``look'' to her spellbound children. 
The sister and brother remove their headphones, peer out the window 
and gape in astonishment at horsemen galloping alongside the minivan. 
The message, apparently, is that watching a movie has enriched the 
children's appreciation of the outside world. On the other hand, this 
could be the very first time these particular children have ever bothered 
to look out a window. They may be mistaking the real world for a video 
they've never seen before.
