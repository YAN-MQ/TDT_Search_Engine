U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region have been put on an unusually 
high state of alert following threats of terrorist attack. VOA's Jim 
Randle reports from the Pentagon where officials called the reported 
threats disturbing. Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon says U.S. military 
commanders in the Persian Gulf region are telling troops to stay on 
bases, avoid traveling in large groups, and to make their activities 
less predictable and, thus, less vulnerable to car bombs and other 
threats. We have significant credible intelligence suggesting the 
possibility of an imminent terrorist action in the Middle Eastern 
region. Mr. Bacon says that threats are made against U.S. forces all 
the time, but he says this particular threat is being taken very seriously. 
He says there have been two deadly bomb attacks against Americans 
in Saudi Arabia since 1994. Over the past few days, the U.S. State 
Department has also urged U.S. citizens in the Middle East to take 
special precautions. Jim Randle, VOA News, at the Pentagon.
