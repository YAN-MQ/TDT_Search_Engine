German pharmaceutical giant Merck says it's buying 57 percent of the 
U.S.-based research firm Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Corporation which 
specializes in cancer treatments. Merck will receive exclusive rights 
to new technologies and patents developed by Lexicon. According to 
Germany's Bundesbank, the government could help create more jobs if 
it offered companies a promise of notable tax cuts.
