The Kinks are the only major British Invasion group aside from the 
Rolling Stones to continue to perform and record, and, like many musicians, 
have developed a presence on the World Wide Web. True to one of the 
band's lesser-known anthems _ ``I'm Not Like Everybody Else'' _ they 
have done so in their own fashion. A large part of the Kinks' allure 
has always been the sibling rivalry between two of the principals: 
Ray and Dave Davies, who are brothers. Ray, 54, wrote and sang most 
of the band's hits, from ``You Really Got Me'' to ``Come Dancing.'' 
Dave, 51, is known for his histrionic guitar playing and challenges 
to Ray's leadership. So it is no surprise that the rivalry continues 
on line, with each brother represented by separate sites _ but linked 
to each other. Both sites were set up last spring. They focus on the 
Davies' solo careers, rather than on Kinks music. Mercifully, both 
are free of the annoying practice, seen in many fan-run Web sites 
on the Kinks, of substituting the letter ``k'' when a hard ``c'' begins 
a word. Coincidentally, both sites are operated by Kinks fans living 
in Massachusetts. Chris Locke, a New Bedford Web site developer, was 
operating his own Kinks fan site when Christian Davies, Dave Davies' 
26-year-old son, approached him with the idea of an official Dave 
Davies site. Tony Raine, from the Cape Cod town of Chatham, was the 
one to approach Ray Davies. ``None of these guys are overly computer 
literate,'' Raine said. ``They are just learning.'' The Dave Davies 
Web site (www.davedavies.com) contains the requisite touring information 
and guitar shots, but Davies logs on regularly to answer the most 
minutiae-soaked inquiries. Fans are also able to listen to a complete 
concert. Davies also uses the online forum to expound upon his Eastern-tinged 
spiritual beliefs and to hawk a related album of ambient music, available 
only from the Web site. And while turning to a pop star for spiritual 
guidance may be somewhat misguided, the discourse here is more substantial 
than the offerings of some other celebrities. A recent upgrade of 
Ray Davies' site (www.raydavies.com) is quite an improvement over 
the initial effort, with flashier graphics and fewer blatant misspellings 
(although its small white-on-black type does not accommodate the eyesight 
of the rapidly aging fan base). Like his brother, Ray Davies is using 
his site to promote his literary leanings, offering samples that are, 
for the time being, not available elsewhere. But unlike his brother, 
Ray Davies seems to treat the Web as a peripheral activity, a 1990s 
version of a 1960s fan club. ``This whole `Internet thing' just hasn't 
piqued Ray's interest like it has Dave's,'' said Dave Emlen, a systems 
analyst for the Rochester Institute of Technology who runs a Kinks 
fan page. ``But if I had to choose between Ray spending his free time 
working on his Web site or working on new recordings and projects, 
I'd choose the latter.''
