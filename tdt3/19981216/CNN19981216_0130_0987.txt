Citigroup has announced a $900 million restructuring plan that will 
cut more than 10,000 jobs worldwide. Katharine Barrett reports. When 
Citicorp and travelers were married this April, their wedding theme 
song was one of growth, not cost kufting. This is not about layoffs. 
This is really about cross-marketing and providing better products 
to clients. So you say no layoffs as a result of the merger? I think 
that there will be more additives over time than there will be contractions. 
Now combining the two companies will cost 10,400 jobs. That's more 
than most expected. Since spring, Citigroup's promise of growth has 
faded in a world of woe. Profits plunged 53% last quarter. When the 
merger was announced, they were planning on some significant revenue 
synergies from the merger. Well, the markets have not cooperated, 
and really made the revenue environment tougher for Salomon Smith 
Barney and citibank. The ax will fall on all business areas in all 
parts of the world. Citigroup's consumer business will bear the brunt 
and more than one-third of the job losses will be in the United States. 
The company says this near-term pain is for long-run gain in cost 
savings -- Savings of almost $700 million dollars next year, nearly 
$1 billion in the year 2000. In some areas, they're still expanding. 
Citibank's announced it's adding 700 jobs in credit card telemarketing. 
Analysts are impressed by this aggressive step and cautiously optimistic 
about Citigroup's stock. But they say no amount of cost cutting will 
help unless world markets and economies make a sustained turnaround.
