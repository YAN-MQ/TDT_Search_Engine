In Kentucky, the teenager who killed three fellow students last year 
was sentenced to 25 years in prison. 15-year-old Michael Carneal will 
not be eligible for parole. He pleaded guilty but mentally ill at 
the time. The sentence is the stiffest one the judge could have imposed 
for a minor under Kentucky law.
