Romania's parliament voted on Wednesday to abolish five ministries, 
as part of an effort to streamline government work and speed up economic 
reforms. Parliament voted to abolish the ministries from 22 to 17, 
following a request by the government, an official statement from 
the parliament said. Under the proposal, the ministries of privatization 
and reform will cease to exist and be absorbed by the office of the 
premier. The communications, research and tourism ministries will 
all be downgraded to national agencies. Leaders of national agencies 
are not members of the government. The changes will come into effect 
when they are formally approved by President Emil Constantinescu in 
the coming weeks.
