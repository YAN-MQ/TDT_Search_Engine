Thousands of spear-wielding Zulus on Wednesday commemorated an 1838 
battle against whites, part of the new South Africa's efforts to rewrite 
its history. The Battle of Blood River, in which a small force of 
Boer settlers shot down 3,000 Zulu warriors in the rolling hills of 
Zululand on Dec. 16, 1838, has long been celebrated as a symbol of 
Afrikaner power. For the first time Wednesday, Zulus held their own 
celebrations at the site, honoring their forefathers' heroic sacrifices.
