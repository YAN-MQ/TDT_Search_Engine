It has been called a ``closed, dark place'' run by Serb hard-liners, 
a haven for war crimes suspects, scene of some of the worst horrors 
of the Bosnian war. As a result, Foca, about 25 miles southeast of 
Sarajevo, has been virtually cut off from the international aid earmarked 
to rebuild the country after the 1992-1995 war. Before the war, Foca 
was a picturesque, multiethnic town, nestled between towering, green 
hills along a narrow valley at the junction of the Drina and Cehotina 
rivers. About half the population of 40,000 was Muslim, the rest Serb 
and a few Croats. The Serbs, however, drove out the Muslims and Croats 
early in the war. To reinforce the town's new, all-Serb image, the 
town was renamed Srbinje, although few other Bosnians use the name. 
The once lively streets are now virtually empty. The 400-year-old 
mosque that had been a symbol of Foca was destroyed. The site is now 
a park. An estimated 80 percent of the 22,800 residents are unemployed. 
Shop windows stand almost empty. Although the town lies on a major 
road between eastern Bosnia and the Adriatic coast, few cars pass 
by. The traditional means of transportation _ the horse-drawn wagon 
_ appears to be replacing cars. Anyone in the town who has $60 is 
considered rich, according to a 57-year-old woman who declined to 
give her name, saying it would be dangerous to do so. She said city 
officials had gotten rich from wartime plunder, but no one cared about 
ordinary townspeople. Under the 1995 Dayton agreement which ended 
the war, Bosnia's three communities _ Serbs, Muslims and Croats _ 
are required to allow minority refugees to return to their prewar 
homes and to surrender those accused of war crimes and end ethnic 
discrimination. Communities that refuse to follow these rules will 
get no international aid. According to human rights groups, Foca falls 
short of even those minimum standards. ``We think that this is a great 
injustice towards the Serbs,'' said Radojica Tesovic, the local governor 
and a member of the Bosnian Serb hard-line party. In a report entitled 
``A Closed, Dark Place,'' the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said Foca 
was the scene of wartime atrocities ``beyond anyone's worst nightmare.'' 
For example, the human rights monitoring group alleged that in 1992, 
Bosnian Serbs rounded up Muslims and Croats and jailed them in detention 
centers where they were ``tortured, raped and ether expelled, killed 
or 'disappeared.''' Non-Serb women were taken from their homes to 
the downtown sports complex near the city hall where, said the group, 
they were ``systematically raped or otherwise sexually assaulted as 
part of the Serb (ethnic cleansing) campaign.'' Today, Foca is a still 
a safe haven for Bosnian Serbs indicted by the International War Crimes 
Tribunal, Human Rights Watch says. ``Only eight of them,'' Tesovic 
stressed. French troops patrol the town but have so far made no attempt 
to arrest any of the eight suspects here. Instead, the suspects move 
around freely in the streets or sip coffee in the bars. In an apparent 
effort to appease international demands, one of Foca's war crimes 
suspects, Milorad Krnojelac, surrendered to French troops in June. 
Krnojelac, former warden of the town jail, was, among other, indicted 
for rape _ the first time the offense has been officially defined 
as a war crime. The next day, protesters trashed the local offices 
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation and the United Nations 
International Police Task Force. Nevertheless, town authorities sent 
a request to international agencies, arguing that with the surrender 
of Krnojelac, Foca had met conditions for foreign aid. So far, they 
have received no response. Tesovic acknowledged that Foca has not 
been receptive to requests by former non-Serb residents to return 
home. ``We are receiving requests by prewar citizens,'' he said. ``But 
until now, we have not approved any of them.'' In its report, Human 
Rights Watch accused international agencies of ``turning a blind eye'' 
to violations of the Dayton agreement in Foca in the interest of keeping 
the peace. ``I really don't understand what the international community 
wants from us,'' Tesovic said. ``We are cooperative. Do they expect 
us to take those people by the hand and hand them over to them?''
