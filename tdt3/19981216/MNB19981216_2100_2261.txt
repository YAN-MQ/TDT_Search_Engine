In plain English, selling this attack to Congress, a lot of that job 
has fallen to a former member of the U.S. Senate, William Cohen of 
the state of Maine. The president crossed parties to choose him as 
sretary of defense. Asa Hutchinson, the republican congressman to 
the state of Arkansas known to a national viewing audience was in 
a briefing tonight with the secretary of defense. Congressman, do 
you believe the administrations case for this attack and more specifically 
more importantly, for carrying out this attack tonight? Well, there's 
some tough questions that were asked of secretary Cohen in that regard. 
Certainly the military action can be justified now. It could have 
been justified three months ago in a number of different time frames 
and probably the future. The question is one of timing. Obviously 
with the report of the UNSCOM inspector with the holy day coming up, 
that was the window in which they said they had to act. Will's obviously 
a lot of skepticism out there, but I think it's important that we 
simply accept the advice of the military personnel. The joint chiefs 
of staff who supported that decision and be supportive of our troops 
in the field because this is certainly a traumatic moment for the 
United States.
