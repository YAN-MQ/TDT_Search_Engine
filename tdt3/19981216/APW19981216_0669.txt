Palestinian leaders said Wednesday they were reviewing their own peace 
commitments following Israel's refusal to meet a deadline to withdraw 
troops in the West Bank as stipulated by the U.S.-brokered Wye River 
accords. Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president 
a day earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops on Friday, as required 
by the Wye accord. ``This is a clear violation of the agreement,'' 
said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, returning to Gaza from Cairo, 
where he briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the Clinton visit. 
``I don't think that the American administration and President Clinton 
will agree to this.'' Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said the Palestinian 
Cabinet would review its own commitments to Wye at its weekly meeting 
Friday. Referring to Netanyahu's refusal to meet the withdrawal deadline, 
Abbas said: ``It shows that the Israeli government doesn't believe 
in peace, and this is what we are seeing on the ground.'' Netanyahu's 
tough stance has frustrated the Americans. Clinton had hoped his visit 
would move Netanyahu to back down from his freeze on the process _ 
especially after the Palestine National Council met an Israeli demand 
and formally renounced clauses in its charter that call for Israel's 
destruction. Netanyahu approved of the PNC vote, but said he would 
not move forward until the Palestinians met six other demands. A release 
of prisoners _ a highly emotional issue for Palestinians _ is due 
at the end of the month as part of Wye. The Palestinians have accused 
Netanyahu of violating the accord by freeing mostly criminals, not 
those held for anti-Israeli activities, in the first round of releases 
in November. ``By keeping (the prisoners) in jail, he is just like 
a plane hijacker who is keeping passengers as hostages,'' Abbas said. 
``He must release them.'' The prime minister is trying to shore up 
support from hard-liners in his coalition who have threatened to vote 
against the government in a no-confidence motion on Monday. However, 
some of the hawks have said they no longer trust Netanyahu not to 
make concessions to the Palestinians, and are set to vote against 
the government. Eli Goldschmidt, caucus chairman of the opposition 
Labor Party, on Tuesday smelled victory in an upcoming vote on early 
elections. ``Now we have the 61 and it looks sure,'' said Goldschmidt 
who is counting on at least nine legislators, including present and 
former coalition members, to vote with Labor. There are 120 legislators 
in the Knesset. Clinton appeared frustrated with the Israeli prime 
minister's apparent obsession with domestic worries. ``We'll just 
keep at it,'' Clinton said Tuesday, and announced that U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright will return to the Mideast in several 
weeks. Palestinians said it was increasingly difficult to work with 
a weakened government. ``All the talk by Israeli officials about security 
is not the security of the Israeli people, but the security of keeping 
their seats in the government,'' said Gaza security chief Mohammmed 
Dahlan. Compounding Netanyahu's woes, his finance minister, Yaakov 
Neeman has decided to quit. In what may have been a snowball effect, 
Netanyahu's defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, a supporter of the 
Wye accord, said he would have his own announcement to make Friday. 
The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said Mordechai would back a call 
for early elections.
