In preparation for Saturday's game against second-place Buffalo, the 
New York jets signed kick returner extraordinaire Dave meggett. Meggett 
played for Bill parcells with the giants and the Patriots. He comes 
aboard to replace the injured Leon Johnson. We brought him in, we 
worked him out. He looked pretty good. His weight's in pretty good 
shape. He's probably only two pounds over, and so I think he'll be 
able to play. He knows our system. So he'll be able to play.
