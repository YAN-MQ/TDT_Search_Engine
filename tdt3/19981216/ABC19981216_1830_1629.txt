We end the broadcast as we began, in the middle of a sustained American 
attack against Iraq. Though it seems quiet in Baghdad tonight and 
there is no blackout in the center of the city, on the edges of town, 
our correspondent has heard a Series of attacks. President Clinton 
told us just a while ago that there was a strong, sustained series 
of attacks throughout the country. For a while downtown, you could 
see the Iraqis trying to fire at something they may have thought was 
a cruise missile. In terms of the degree of power and force that the 
United States has brought to bear tonight, there's been a package 
of cruise missiles launched by the Navy on what we are told military 
targets around the country. Bill Cohen says this will go on as long 
as it is required. There is no time limit. At 10:00 tonight, 9:00 
eastern time, we'll gather to bring you up to date on this quite extraordinary 
day where impeachment and an attack on Iraq have come together.
