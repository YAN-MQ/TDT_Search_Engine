The crew of space shuttle "endeavour" is back on Terra firma at the 
Kennedy space center in Florida. This was only the 10th time since 
1981 that the shuttle has landed at night. The go-ahead for the landing 
had been in question because clouds and rain were passing over Florida. 
During the nearly 12-day mission, the astronauts made three space 
walks to work on the international space station. NASA says there 
will be 35 more shuttle flights over the next five years to complete 
the station.
