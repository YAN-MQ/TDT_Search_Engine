Blood banks that rejected five homosexual men as donors were not discriminating 
against them, but simply trying to protect the blood supply, a Dutch 
panel said Wednesday. The independent Equal Opportunities Commission 
ruled that blood and sperm banks have the right to refuse to accept 
donations from homosexual men because they are obliged to limit as 
much as possible the risk of HIV infection, Dutch television reported. 
The five men, backed by the nation's biggest gay rights lobbying group, 
had argued that rejecting homosexual men as donors constituted discrimination 
against those who practice safe sex and are in steady monogamous relationships. 
Research in the Netherlands has shown that 63 percent of AIDS patients 
are homosexual or bisexual men.
