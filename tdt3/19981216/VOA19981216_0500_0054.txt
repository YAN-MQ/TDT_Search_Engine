Reports from Baghdad say U.N. weapons inspectors are being evacuated 
following a report by the chief inspector accusing Iraq of not cooperating 
with his team. News reports said the U.N. arms experts left their 
headquarters today and would fly to Bahrain. The United Nations has 
not confirmed an evacuation is underway. Chief U.N. arms inspector 
Richard Butler said in his report that Iraq did not provide the full 
cooperation it pledged last month to avoid a U.S. military attack.
