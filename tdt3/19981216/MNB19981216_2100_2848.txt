Some of the first tape has arrived. We have been able to edit this. 
A child arriving in an emergency Ward at a hospital. There are several 
grown men in this case. There are at least two scenes of what appear 
to be various neighborhoods in Baghdad. In one, a man shows the camera 
what looks like a shell casing. No U.S. markings to speak of yet. 
Presumably the mother of the child being interviewed there by television 
crews. The kind of thing we saw in 1991 in subsequent attacks, the 
kind of thing we'll see as this evening goes on. As the Iraqis, remember, 
are able to -- all the American and western camera crews have local 
drivers. The drivers know where the ordnance falls. They know where 
to go and take pictures of the damage. This is night scope tape from 
earlier this evening as well.
