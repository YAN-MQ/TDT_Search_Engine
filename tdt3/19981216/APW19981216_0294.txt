Unemployment in Britain stayed at 4.6 percent for the fourth consecutive 
month in November, although the number of people claiming welfare 
rose slightly. The government reported Wednesday that the number claiming 
welfare increased by 5,900 to about 1.33 million, while the government-preferred 
International Labor Organization total _ which includes people not 
eligible for benefits _ rose by 16,000 between August and September. 
Despite the increases in those seeking benefits, the government said 
the labor market generally continued to improve, with employment rising 
and job vacancies reaching record numbers. The number of people working 
reached a record 27.2 million in August through October, up 80,000 
from May-June and an increase of 259,000 compared to a year ago. The 
growth was attributed mainly to an increase in the number of women 
taking full-time jobs. ``The figures refute the worst fears of those 
predicting a large jump in unemployment,'' said Employment Minister 
Andrew Smith. ``The number of those in work has risen to 27.2 million, 
the highest level ever recorded, and a small increase in unemployment 
reflects the slow down in the economy predicted by both the Bank of 
England and government economists.''
