Palestinians said Wednesday they will stick to their Wye River accord 
commitments, despite an Israeli freeze on the process _ an apparent 
effort to cultivate the U.S.-Palestinian friendship that blossomed 
during this week's visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton. Netanyahu 
on Wednesday morning briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's three-day visit 
and affirmed what he told the president a day earlier _ that he would 
not withdraw troops on Friday, as required by the Wye accord. An Israeli 
official speaking on condition of anonymity later said Netanyahu would 
announce Wednesday night that he will agree to early elections if 
he is unable to stabilize his shaky coalition. Netanyahu's office 
said he would make an announcement ``regarding elections'' at 8 p.m. 
(1800 GMT). That would further delay implementation of the agreement 
brokered by Clinton in October. Netanyahu says he wants solid evidence 
that the Palestinians are fulfilling their commitment to contain anti-Israel 
violence and to round up illegal weapons. The Palestinians want quid-pro-quo 
for acceding on Monday to the Israeli demand that the Palestine National 
Council convene and renounce clauses in its charter calling for Israel's 
destruction. Clinton attended that meeting. Palestinian officials 
said Netanyahu's actions brought his commitment to the peace process 
into question. ``It shows that the Israeli government doesn't believe 
in peace, and this is what we are seeing on the ground,'' said Mahmoud 
Abbas, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy. Still, Palestinians 
remained committed to the process, and would continue to fulfill its 
requirements. ``We shall continue to carry out our commitments and 
we shall push ... for full implementation from Israel,'' said Nabil 
Shaath, a top Palestinian negotiator returning with Arafat from Egypt, 
where the Palestinian leader briefed President Hosni Mubarak on the 
Clinton visit. Shaath even indicated that the Palestinians were willing 
to consider a post-Wye demand from Netanyahu that Arafat back off 
a promise to declare statehood by May. The declaration would come 
only if Israel delays agreements, he said. Despite his denials, Israelis 
and Palestinians saw Clinton's tour of Gaza as conferring tacit approval 
of Palestinian statehood. Clinton also moved Palestinians in his speeches 
when he expressed understanding of the pain that resulted from years 
of dislocation and occupation. ``The United States has taken long 
strives toward neutrality and a lack of bias regarding Palestinians 
and Israelis,'' Mahmoud Abbas told Voice of Palestine radio. Arafat 
could not resist intimating his new-found closeness to Clinton when 
he was asked to react to Netanyahu's freeze on troop withdrawal. ``I 
don't think that the American administration and President Clinton 
will agree to this,'' he said _ a speculation unimaginable just a 
month ago. Netanyahu is trying to shore up support from hard-liners 
in his coalition who have threatened to vote against the government 
in a no-confidence motion on Monday. Some of the hawks have said they 
no longer trust Netanyahu not to make concessions to the Palestinians, 
and are set to vote against the government. The prime minister would 
first seek to bring disenchanted coalition members back into the fold 
or try to form a national unity government with the dovish Labor party, 
the Israeli official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The 
official said Netanyahu would hold elections within two to three months 
if there was no other option. Palestinians said it was increasingly 
difficult to work with a weakened government. ``All the talk by Israeli 
officials about security is not the security of the Israeli people, 
but the security of keeping their seats in the government,'' said 
Gaza security chief Mohammmed Dahlan.
