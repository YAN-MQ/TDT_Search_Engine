Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." The pro bowl selections 
were announced today. And while the success of both the Broncos and 
Vikings was recognized by each team having nine players elected to 
the starting lineup, including randall Cunningham, another quarterback 
who is also one of the feel-good stories of the year in the NFL was 
also picked -- Buffalo's Doug Flutie. Great feeling of satisfaction 
and achievement. And the guys surrounding me, I mean, the offensive 
line, Sam gash, Thurman thomas, receivers, Eric moulds, Andre Reed, 
guys catching the ball, breaking tackles and going 80 yards for a 
touchdown kind of helps, you know?
