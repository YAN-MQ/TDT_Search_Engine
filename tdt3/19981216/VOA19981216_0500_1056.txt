After further review, the National Football League has decided not 
to use instant replay in playoff games this season. In a teleconference 
lasting just 45 minutes Tuesday, the eight-member NFL competition 
committee voted 7 to 1 against using video replays to settle questionable 
calls by on-field officials. The discussion between members of the 
competition committee and league officials was prompted by a flurry 
of obvious officiating blunders this season.
