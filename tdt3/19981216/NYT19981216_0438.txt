By Benjamin Franklin's definition that impeachment is the political 
equivalent of assassination, President Clinton's defenders scrambled 
for a stay of execution on Wednesday _ a breathlessly chaotic day 
on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers arriving back for the special impeachment 
debate session found a new crisis logo on the House's perpetually 
running cable news screens _ ``Showdown With Iraq'' _ and a Republican 
leadership faced with a fresh theme of whether to display patriotic 
nonpartisanship in support of the president even as they planned to 
impeach him and see him tried in the Senate as a perjurer and a lawbreaker. 
Military rockets deliverable upon Saddam Hussein, not pro-impeachment 
votes aimed at Bill Clinton, were suddenly being accounted for in 
portentous bulletins across the day. ``Do you believe this?'' was 
the question of the day among veteran political operatives in both 
parties as the House was forced to postpone its impeachment debate 
because of the attack on Iraq. The television screens in congressional 
offices were lime green with nightscope views of Baghdad as members 
moved down to party conferences whose impeachment agendas were pushed 
aside by the strike against Iraq. Lawmakers bristled with questions, 
anger, doubt about the traumatic mixing of the two crises. The ire 
of Republicans was clear when, an hour before Clinton's attack order 
was announced, Rep. Gerald Solomon of upstate New York, the Rules 
Committee chairman, stormed out to the television broadcast cluster 
by the East Capitol lawn. ``It is obvious that he is doing this for 
political reasons, and I and others are outraged,'' Solomon boomed 
furiously in denouncing the president and his administration. ``They 
deliberately ignored the Congress.'' Returning lawmakers were stunned 
at the braiding of the Iraq attack with the impeachment drive. Republicans 
were angrily skeptical. ``We don't stop elections even in the face 
of world wars,'' said Rep. James Rogan of California, balking at the 
very idea of postponing the dis-election process of impeachment because 
``some dictator jerks our chain.'' The Capitol's day was bifurcated, 
with the Iraq issue descending like a giant theater scrim on the stage 
center of impeachment. Beyond the scrim, returning Republicans continued 
to hold separate pro-impeachment news conferences, sounding a domestic 
drumbeat through the day in counterpoint to the war anxieties. But 
their views seemed to pale, if only momentarily, against the president's 
agenda of military action. One Republican moderate, Sherwood Boehlert 
of upstate New York, looked anguished as he announced his ``almost 
unbearably sad conclusion'' to turn to impeachment ``as a shield, 
not a sword'' against Clinton and his misbehavior. ``He has tried 
repeatedly to game the judicial system,'' the eight-term congressman 
declared, his tone pained, his pace elegiacal as reporters waited 
to shout questions about Iraq at him. Across the Capitol, returning 
members seem chilled at the impeachment ordeal's being compounded 
by Iraq. ``I don't know, I don't know,'' one congressman, Michael 
Pappas, R-N.J., admitted with a look of stricken candor when asked 
whether the nation could handle the two crises side by side. The focus 
was blurred for the returning lawmakers. Standing outside the Capitol 
in sweater and slacks, Rep. Melvin Watt, D-N.C., shook his head at 
the overlapping crises and slowly observed, ``Nothing about this year 
can be surprising to me anymore.'' He vowed to find an ``even keel'' 
in all this and headed up the steps into the Capitol, quietly observing, 
``This, too, shall pass.'' Republicans sensed a fresh chess piece 
in the president's hand, and cried foul. A new political cliche swept 
the Capitol _ the notion of Democrats' somehow ``running out the impeachment 
clock'' on the waning 105th Congress by lancing one crisis with another. 
``I'm so disappointed at all this,'' Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., 
said as she headed up the Capitol's steps, then spotted some visiting 
schoolchildren. ``Students, come join me and help fight impeachment!'' 
she yelled, commandeering a television camera in the spirit of the 
makeshift that haunted the day. ``What channel? What channel?'' they 
asked her, crowding about like mice to the piper as the day waxed 
frenetic. By the end of the day, it was every channel. As the Republicans 
gathered Wednesday night for a grim meeting in Room HC-5, impeachment 
was supposed to be the sole topic. But the White House was seizing 
the day with announcements of the attack and of a presidential address 
to the nation. Impeachment seemed to be slipping onto hold as the 
lawmakers moved past the glass Capitol doorways looking west down 
the Mall, where Christmas lights blinked festively in the crisis-steeped 
night.
