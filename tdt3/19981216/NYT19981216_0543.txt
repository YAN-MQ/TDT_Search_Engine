William Gaddis, author of ``The Recognitions'' and ``JR,'' and a novelist 
of immense range, complexity and satiric humor, died Wednesday at 
his home in East Hampton, N.Y. He was 75. The cause was prostate cancer, 
said his daughter, Sarah Meares Gaddis. Gaddis was one of the most 
innovative and demanding of writers. His four published novels stand 
tall and totemic in the field of modernist literature. For ``The Recognitions,'' 
his first novel, in 1955, he was compared to James Joyce. With other 
books, critics drew parallels with Malcolm Lowry and Herman Melville. 
Aspects of all three and others figured in his work, but most of all 
he was, in Cynthia Ozick's words, ``an American original.'' Reviewing 
Gaddis' 1985 novel, ``Carpenter's Gothic,'' in The New York Times 
Book Review, Ms. Ozick looked back on ``The Recognitions'' as ``the 
most overlooked important work of the last several literary generations.'' 
It was, she said, ``a vast fiction about fabrication and forgery, 
about the thousand faces of the counterfeit, and therefore, ineluctably, 
about art and religion.'' ``Carpenter's Gothic,'' Ms. Ozick said, 
was an ``unholy landscape of a novel _ an extra turret added on to 
the ample, ingenious, audacious Gothic mansion William Gaddis has 
slowly been building in American letters.'' In her judgment the book 
marked a turning point in his career; admirers hoped that it would 
bring him a wider audience. Despite rapturous reviews and a covey 
of awards (including two National Book Awards and a MacArthur ``genius'' 
grant), he was not destined to have a popular readership. He was often 
considered one of the least read of important American writers. But 
his books have become contemporary classics. As his reputation grew, 
he was surrounded by academics seeking symbols and offering deep analyses 
of his work. He maintained his equilibrium, saying, ``What can I do 
if people insist I'm cleverer than I think I am?'' Observing Gaddis 
at a writers conference in the Soviet Union in 1985, Louis Auchincloss 
said that he was ``reserved and quiet, impeccably clad, with the patient 
composure of a man of the world and the piercing eye of a wit,'' and 
that he spoke ``in measured tones of the small sales that the serious 
novelist might expect.'' Gaddis was born in Manhattan on Dec. 29, 
1922, grew up in Massapequa, N.Y., and went to boarding school in 
Connecticut and Farmingdale High School on Long Island. He studied 
English literature at Harvard University, and wrote stories, poems, 
essays and reviews for the Harvard Lampoon. In his senior year, he 
was asked to resign from the college after he and a friend were involved 
in an altercation with the police. In New York, he worked as a fact 
checker at The New Yorker, and spent his free time in Greenwich Village 
with Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and other writers of the Beat Generation. 
Leaving New York, he traveled through Mexico and Central America, 
joining insurgents in Costa Rica during a brief civil war. Subsequently 
he went to Spain and Africa, gathering experience and material while 
working on ``The Recognitions.'' He continued work on the novel through 
the early 1950s. Published in 1955, it weighed in at a hefty 956 pages. 
It received generally unappreciative reviews. In a brief one in The 
New York Times Book Review, Granville Hicks said that the author had 
``ostentatiously aimed at writing a masterpiece,'' but had written 
a book that was ``no more than very talented or highly ingenious or, 
on another level, rather amusing.'' Gaddis said the book's reception 
was ``a sobering experience.'' It was 20 years before he published 
another novel, but during the interval, ``The Recognitions'' was reprinted 
in a paperback edition and was published abroad, and it began building 
an underground reputation for the author. To continue his fiction, 
Gaddis supported himself by teaching and writing nonfiction on assignment. 
For four years, he worked in public relations for the Pfizer pharmaceutical 
company. In 1963 he won a National Arts and Letters grant and, four 
years later, another from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 
1974, ``The Recognitions'' was reissued in a mass market paperback. 
Tony Tanner took that occasion, in a review in The New York Times 
Book Review, to extol Gaddis, ranking him alongside Thomas Pynchon 
as an experimentalist: ``In its scope, its witty-serious use of erudition, 
its endless exploitation of the resources available to a modern text, 
its brilliant use of language, and, not least, its marvelous humor 
and range of tone,'' the book seemed to him ``one of most important 
American novels written since the last war.'' By the time ``JR'' was 
published the following year, Gaddis had achieved the recognition 
that had been denied him upon publication of his first novel. In The 
New York Times Book Review, George Stade characterized the theme of 
``The Recognitions'' as ``the multiple and paradoxical relations between 
recognition and forgery,'' and said the book had raised the question 
whether ``all human products and activities are each no more than 
items in a series of copies for which there is no original.'' The 
reviewer continued that ``as much, and more'' could be said about 
``JR,'' and concluded that ``no recent novel I know of with anything 
like the fullness or accuracy of `Jr' is at once so inventive and 
subtle in the structure of relations among its parts.'' The title 
character of ``JR'' is an 11-year-old who becomes a wizard of Wall 
Street. In a Paris Review interview, Gaddis explained why the character 
was so young. ``He is in this prepubescent age where he is amoral'' 
and ``dealing with people who are immoral, unscrupulous,'' he said, 
``whereas his good cheer and greed he considers perfectly normal.'' 
Praised by William H. Gass and other writers, ``JR'' won the National 
Book Award. ``Carpenter's Gothic'' followed in 1985. At 262 pages, 
it was Gaddis' shortest work. At the time of the book's publication, 
the author said in an interview that there was no underlying scheme 
to his novels. ``There is an obligation not to bore or be bored yourself 
in doing your work,'' Gaddis said. ``If a writer is bored, the reader 
will be too.'' For ``A Frolic of His Own'' in 1994, a book about plagiarism 
and intellectual property, he won his second National Book Award. 
In addition to his daughter, a novelist who lives in Asheville, N.C., 
and Sag Harbor, N.Y., he is survived by a son, Matthew Hough Gaddis, 
a filmmaker in Manhattan. In ``JR,'' the writer Jack Gibbs is trying 
to finish a book titled ``Agape Agape.'' Before his death, Gaddis 
finished his fifth novel, also titled ``Agape Agape.'' It is, said 
his son, an extension of that original idea in ``JR,'' a novel about 
``the secret history of the player piano.'' The player piano was an 
early obsession of the author, who considered it to be an example 
of a ``a nonparticipatory art form.'' In other words, the new Gaddis 
will be about the destructive elements of mechanization and the arts.
