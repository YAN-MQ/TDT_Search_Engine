A slot machine is governed by the unyielding laws of mathematics, 
regardless of whether it has a mechanical or electronic brain. Odds, 
payoff rates, and sizes and frequencies of jackpots all depend on 
the unforgiving laws (from the gambler's point of view) that govern 
numbers anywhere in the universe. A classic slot machine might have 
three spinning reels with 20 symbols each. If only one symbol (say, 
a cherry) on each reel was a winner, the odds of getting a winning 
combination _ three cherries _ would be 203, or 1 in 8,000. Computer 
technology has made the spinning reels purely decorative. They reflect 
the results from a computer chip that serves as a random number generator. 
When a gambler pulls the handle or pushes the spin button on a slot 
machine, the generator spits out random numbers that signal the motor 
to stop spinning reels at certain symbols or, in the case of video 
displays, to show certain symbols on computer-like screens. The gambler 
anxiously watches the reels spin, even though the end position of 
the reels is determined in a split second. The time delay is strictly 
show. The computer allows a far greater range of possible combinations 
and thus outcomes than traditional slot machines could manage. In 
some slot machines, especially those playing high-stakes games like 
Megabucks, the computer can segment the reels into more than 250 possible 
stops. That increasing the odds against hitting some winning combinations 
_ for the largest jackpots _ while making many more smaller jackpots 
possible. By law, Las Vegas slot machines must pay out 75 percent 
of the money taken in. But because of competition, casino operators 
say, many slot machines pay out 95 percent or more. Complex mathematical 
formulas are used to program the slot machines' computers to fix the 
the size and frequency of wins, which controls the payout percentage. 
Casino makers say the programs can be changed by casino operators 
under the guidance of regulatory groups. ``What it allows us to do 
in the industry is to give away $27 million but have a lot of people 
still win an awful lot of money for cherries, single bars, double 
bars, triple bars or whatever the winning combinations are,'' said 
Verne F. Holmes Jr., an inventor of slot machine devices who is based 
in Las Vegas.
