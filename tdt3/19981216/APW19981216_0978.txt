French winger Ibrahim Ba said Wednesday he's close to moving from 
Serie A club AC Milan to England's Newcastle. ``I know that Milan 
has already spoken to the English officials,'' Ba said. ``I had a 
meeting with (Newcastle coach Ruud) Gullit, and I would be prepared 
to leave in January.'' Ba, 25, joined Milan from France's Bordeux 
before the 1997-98 season and has scored one goal in 38 games in Italy. 
But he's appeared in just seven of Milan's 13 games this season. ``I'm 
down, how couldn't I be? I never play,'' Ba said. He's the latest 
Milan player to say we wants out, after German 'keeper Jens Lehmann 
and Croat midfielder Zvonomir Boban. The club is in second place in 
the Italian League with a 7-3-1 record.
