The head of Kenya's much-maligned police Wednesday invited citizens 
to attend the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the founding 
of the force by British colonial authorities. The invitation by Commissioner 
Duncan Wachira to ``Kenyans from all walks of life'' to attend day-long 
celebrations Friday in Nairobi's Uhuru Park comes less than a week 
after a police officer shot dead a mini-van driver and seriously wounded 
his conductor for no apparent reason. The officer was arrested, but 
other drivers and conductors went on a rampage in Nairobi Monday to 
protest the killing. Two senior police officials last week apologized 
for police excesses and asked the public to forgive the many atrocities 
committed by police, ranging from harassment and demanding bribes 
to torture and extra-judicial killings. Asst. Police Commissioner 
Stephen Kimenchu admitted during a human rights workshop that police 
had committed many atrocities, usually at the bidding of politicians. 
But he said things were changing. And police chaplain Reserve Supt. 
Mike Harries called for forgiveness but urged Kenyans to remember 
that the police work against great odds and are underfunded and underpaid. 
It is not uncommon for those seeking police assistance to have to 
go to police stations to fetch police because all vehicles are broken 
down or they have run out of gas. Victims of armed robbery and assault 
often wait hours for police to show up, and many off-duty police officers 
have been implicated in robberies, either through renting their service 
weapons to gangs or direct participation. As in most other African 
nations, police in Kenya routinely beat back crowds with bullwhips 
and clubs and routinely beat confessions out of petty thieves. In 
an editorial page essay Wednesday in the East African Standard, columnist 
Maina Muiruri pondered the likelihood that Kenyans will easily forgive 
their police. ``The library files on the police should not be recommended 
for detailed perusal if one hopes to forgive the Kenya police for 
their past sins,'' he wrote, pointing out case after case of police 
excess. Muiruri said the only real guarantee that the Kenya police 
are changing would ``a sign that there would be no more political 
interference in the police.'' ``The Kenyan force is far too gone in 
the rot that nothing short of thorough restructuring might produce 
any result,'' he wrote. ``So far, the two apologies are just drop-in-the-ocean 
piecemeal measures that can at best achieve nothing above one-day 
PR.'' On Wednesday, King'ori Mwangi, the new police spokesman, declined 
to provide information on police salaries, saying he was busy with 
preparations for the centenary celebration. It is widely understood 
that police salaries have not kept pace with the rise in the cost 
of living. Small bribes, popularly known as ``kito kidogo'' or something 
small in Kiswahili _ as well as large-scale payoffs to senior officers 
_ are commonplace.
