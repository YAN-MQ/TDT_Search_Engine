Just 18 months ago, a national ethics commission recommended a three- 
to five-year moratorium on human cloning research. The members, who 
issued their recommendation to President Clinton, argued that nothing 
would be lost by such a ban, because it most likely would take at 
least that long to know whether cloning could succeed. But a ban was 
not approved, and events seem to have proved the commission wrong. 
At the time, just one animal, a sheep, had been cloned, after about 
400 tries. Now, not only have mice and cows been cloned with seeming 
ease but doctors at a South Korean fertility clinic report that they 
have taken the first step toward cloning a human. With that, some 
say, cloning has moved to a new frontier. ``All the other cloning 
announcements were from biotech companies or agricultural scientists,'' 
said Dr. Lee Silver, a molecular geneticist at Princeton University. 
But the Korean announcement, he said, is clear on the motives: ``It 
is in order to have human clones born.'' The Koreans say they made 
a four-celled embryo that was a clone of an infertile woman. They 
did not implant the embryo in a woman's uterus to see if it would 
grow, nor did they provide evidence that the embryo was a clone. But 
fertility experts in the United States said it was only a matter of 
time before humans were cloned. Dr. Richard Rawlins, who directs the 
in vitro fertilization laboratory for the Rush Health System in Chicago, 
said people outside the field misjudged ``from Day 1'' the magnitude 
of the forces that would push cloning research forward. ``It is a 
business, not a science,'' he said. Dr. Harold Shapiro, president 
of Princeton University and chairman of the National Bioethics Advisory 
Commission, which advised the president, said, ``The main point of 
our recommendation was not whether it would be three to five years 
or one to two years or seven to eight years, but it was moral prudence.'' 
Until Dolly the lamb, the first clone, was born, it was a scientific 
truism that the cloning of adults was biologically impossible. Scientists 
reasoned that even though every cell in an animal's body has the same 
genetic material, adult cells are the result of a process of differentiation 
that begins in the womb. After that, the theory went, a brain cell 
stays a brain cell, a heart cell remains a heart cell. To clone, scientists 
would have to take such a developed cell and reverse its genetic program 
so that it could direct the development of a new animal, an identical 
twin of the adult. That is what scientists achieved, first with Dolly 
and now with other animals. But with Dolly, cloning seemed almost 
impossibly arduous. Scientists at the Roslin Institute in Scotland 
started with about 400 unfertilized sheep eggs. Out of those eggs, 
they got one lamb. This summer, however, scientists in Hawaii announced 
that they had created dozens of clones of adult mice. Last week, scientists 
in Japan announced that they had cloned an adult cow, creating eight 
calves. They said they were about as efficient in cloning as fertility 
clinics were in creating human babies by mixing sperm and eggs in 
the laboratory. What happened in Korea, said Dr. Randall Prather, 
a cloning expert at the University of Missouri in Columbia, ``is the 
obvious next step'' in cloning. Some say that public opinion is having 
a chilling effect on fertility clinics in the United States that might 
want to clone humans. If anyone tried it, said Dr. Alan DeCherney, 
chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University 
of California in Los Angeles School of Medicine, ``you'd become the 
Dr. Kevorkian of reproduction.'' But, said Dr. Steen Willadsen, at 
St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J., ``there are literally 
thousands of people around the world who could try that experiment.'' 
The obvious message, Prather said, is that human cloning ``is going 
to happen sooner or later.'' And, he added, ``You'd better get used 
to it.''
