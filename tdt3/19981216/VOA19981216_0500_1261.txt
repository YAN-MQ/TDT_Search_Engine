The new British American racing Formula One car has been tested for 
the first time. Former world champion Jacques Villeneuve of Canada 
began an intensive pre-season testing program for the car, the first 
1999 specification Formula One car to appear publicly. He drove the 
blue, silver, and yellow car for three laps around the Catalonia circuit 
in Spain before it was sidelined by electrical problems. Villeneuve 
previously drove for Williams and was a 1997 Formula One world champion.
