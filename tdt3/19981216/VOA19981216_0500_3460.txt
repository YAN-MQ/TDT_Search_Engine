Down around the reservation, many of our local FM and medium-wave 
affiliates are going to take a two-minute break. We'll be back with 
you, though. Stay tuned for more of News Now. One of the things people 
like to do this time of the year is get a lot of mail. Well, here 
at the Voice of America, we'd like to hear from you. We'd like to 
hear from you regarding comments, suggestions, criticisms of what 
we do, or if you want to find out more of what we do, we're going 
to give you some suggestions now. First of all, if you want to focus 
in on what it is we do and you want to write to us about with your 
comments, send your postcard or letter to VOA News Now, Washington, 
D.C. 20547, USA. That is VOA News Now, Washington, D.C. 20547. Or 
you can use our e-mail address on the Internet: newsnow@voa.gov, with 
News Now written as one word. newsnow@voa.gov. And with every note, 
please let us know where you are and when you listen and tell us how 
you listen, giving us the frequency you're turned to, if you're hearing 
our short-wave, medium-wave or FM broadcasts. If you don't have anything 
to say, just hello. We're coming up now on...
