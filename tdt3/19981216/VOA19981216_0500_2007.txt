President Clinton is back in Washington after failing to persuade 
Israel to pull more troops from the West Bank. Despite the setback, 
Mr. Clinton's says his three-day visit was a success, and he was asked 
if Israeli troop pullbacks will begin soon. I think the proper way 
to answer that is that the Israeli government in my meeting reaffirmed 
its commitment to the Wye process, and so we have to resolve a number 
of issues in order for the de-deployment to go forward. I think it 
would be unfortunate if we got too far behind schedule, and I hope 
we can keep pretty much the schedule that's there, but that's -- obviously, 
that remains to be worked out here. We believe in the -- keeping to 
these schedules as much as possible, and we worked very hard to put 
all this back on track here. I do think that the -- we are back on 
track, we're going to see this through, and I feel good about where 
we are now. Mr. Clinton says U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
will return to the region in a few weeks to work at keeping the Wye 
River accord on track.
