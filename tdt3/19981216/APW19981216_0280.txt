Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew emerged from the night sky and 
landed in triumph, ending NASA's first flight to build the international 
space station. ``Wow! What can I say after a mission like that?'' 
commander Robert Cabana exclaimed after guiding the shuttle to a smooth 
touchdown late Tuesday. ``We are just so happy to have gotten the 
international space station off to such a super start.'' The six astronauts, 
who masterfully joined the first two pieces of the space station in 
orbit, returned to handshakes, backslaps and a stream of congratulations. 
The well-wishers included two of the three Apollo 8 astronauts who 
flew around the moon during Christmas 1968. Jim Lovell and Bill Anders 
were attending a 30th anniversary bash at Kennedy Space Center. ``I'm 
so proud of what they've done,'' said Lovell, who also circled the 
moon on Apollo 13. Mission Control gave Cabana the go-ahead for an 
on-time touchdown after hours of scrutinizing the weather. Thick rain 
clouds hung over the space center throughout the afternoon but were 
gone by dusk. Endeavour resembled a comet as it streaked over the 
Gulf of Mexico and across Florida, its path tracked by infrared cameras. 
It swooped through a clear, chilly sky on final approach and landed 
on the xenon-lit runway at 10:53 p.m., a minute early thanks to a 
tailwind. It was only the 10th time in 93 flights that a space shuttle 
returned in darkness. Mission Control complimented Cabana for his 
``beautiful landing,'' then thanked the entire crew _ calling out 
each of their names _ ``for an awesome job starting our space station 
adventure.'' During their exhausting journey, which spanned nearly 
12 days and 4.6 million miles, the astronauts set the cornerstone 
for the international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya 
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber. Jerry 
Ross and James Newman made three spacewalks to wire Zarya and Unity 
together and attach antennas and other equipment. The crew also spent 
a full day inside the station, hooking up electronics. ``I've got 
to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases of the mission,'' 
Cabana said. And so they were ``really relieved,'' once all their 
objectives were accomplished, he said. It was the first of 36 space 
shuttle flights that NASA estimates will be needed over the next five 
years to build the 16-nation space station. Nine Russian rocket launches 
also will be required; the first took place on Nov. 20 when Zarya 
soared from Kazakstan. Endeavour carried up Unity. ``Two down, 43 
to go,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin cheered following Endeavour's touchdown. 
But he cautioned: ``Let's not project forward that everything's going 
to be easy. This is tough stuff.'' Shuttle program manager Tommy Holloway 
said even though Endeavour's crew made everything look simple, ``I 
can assure you it took a lot of hard work, a lot of preparation and 
a lot of attention to detail.'' To ensure success, Holloway distributed 
a memo before the Dec. 4 launch reminding the shuttle team of ``three 
close calls'' over the past year and urging everyone to do better. 
Among the incidents he cited: the loss of the drag-chute door moments 
before Discovery blasted off in October with John Glenn. Because engineers 
still don't know why the door ripped off, Endeavour landed without 
a drag chute. NASA did not want to risk having the door fall off at 
liftoff and hit an engine again, and so bolted it shut. NASA hopes 
to have the door redesigned before the next shuttle flight at the 
end of March. The telescope-delivery mission will be led by Eileen 
Collins, the first female commander.
