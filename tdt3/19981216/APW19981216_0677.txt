Top seed Tamarine Tanasugarn gave host Thailand another gold medal 
chance Wednesday, beating China's Yi Jingqian 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 and advancing 
to the Asian Games tennis final. In Thursday's gold medal match, Tamarine, 
ranked No. 37 by the WTA, will face third seed Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia, 
who found her game in the first set tie-break and pounded out a 7-6 
(7-3), 6-1 victory over China's Li Fang. Errors hurt Yi as Tamarine 
converted six of 10 break points in the baseline battle. The Thai, 
meanwhile, was nailing shots down the line. On match point, Yi's shot 
hung on the net briefly before falling back on her side. A near-capacity 
crowd cheered on Tamarine with shouts of ``One more time.'' Looking 
ahead to meeting Basuki, Tamarine said, ``I may have beaten her three 
years ago (at the Southeast Asian Games), but I don't think that will 
count for much. It's definitely going to be close.'' Basuki, ranked 
No. 56, played evenly with No. 40 Li through the first 12 games, but 
then took control, finishing off the first set with a serve and volley. 
Her heavy hitting from the baseline often left Li out of position 
in the second set, but she mixed in shots like a lob volley over Li's 
head. ``I expect a lot from myself in the finals. I'm thinking very 
positively and have high motivation right now,'' Basuki said. I'm 
getting lots of support from the Indonesian people here. I just hope 
I don't disappoint them.'' In men's quarterfinals, Japan's Satoshi 
Iwabuchi beat South Korea's Lee Hyung-taik 6-4, 7-5, and India's Mahesh 
Bhupathi defeated Uzbekistan's Oleg Ogorodov 6-3, 3-6, 7-5. South 
Korea's Yoon Yong-il and India's Srinath Prahlad had won semifinal 
places on Tuesday. India's best hope, Leander Paes, who stands 91st 
in the ATP rankings, had to drop out of the games with an injury. 
He was the only Asian in the rankings' top 100.
