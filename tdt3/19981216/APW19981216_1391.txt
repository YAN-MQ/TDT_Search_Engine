Russia's official defender of human rights said Wednesday that ethnic 
Russians should have a special status in their country, and warned 
against prosecuting a Communist lawmaker who accused Jews of waging 
``genocide'' in Russia. ``The (anti-Semitic) remarks that we are hearing 
are remarks by rather educated and knowledgeable people,'' Russia's 
Human Rights Commissioner Oleg Mironov said. ``I condemn such statements, 
but I don't think that the majority of Russia's population condemns 
them,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted him as saying. ``The Russian 
idea is being voiced. And it should be voiced in a country where the 
majority of the population is Russian.'' Prominent Communist lawmaker 
Viktor Ilyukhin said Tuesday that Russia's post-Soviet collapse would 
not have happened if Russia's government was not made up ``exclusively 
of one group, the Jews.'' He also accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' 
in the country. President Boris Yeltsin's governments have contained 
a number of Jews and other minorities in prominent positions, but 
they have always been outnumbered by ethnic Russians. Officials in 
Yeltsin's staff and the Cabinet strongly condemned Ilyukhin's statements. 
Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky on Wednesday called for banning 
the Communist party, and said the government should use force to get 
rid of the party if necessary. Berezovsky, who is Jewish, was reiterating 
calls that many Russian liberals made last month, after the Communist 
Party refused to censure another member, lawmaker Albert Makashov, 
for similar anti-Semitic remarks. ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov 
should sit in the dock, and not in the Duma,'' Berezovsky said. But 
Mironov, the human rights commissioner, insisted that anti-Semites 
should not be persecuted or prosecuted because their statements have 
a broad appeal in Russia. ``Maybe one should just have some kind of 
talks, discussions, disputes with them.'' Any harsher action could 
ignite an ``ethnic fire'' in Russia, Mironov was quoted as saying. 
Mironov also insisted that there is no anti-Semitism in Russia, because 
none of the ``representatives of that ethnic group'' have ever complained 
to him about any discrimination against the Jews. Ilyukhin was unrepentant 
about his statements. ``What kind of democracy is it when a Russian 
man can't speak the truth?'' he asked Wednesday. Since Soviet-era 
tacit discrimination against Jews was abolished, virulent grass-roots 
anti-Semitism has flared up in Russia, with bombings of synagogues, 
desecration of Jewish cemeteries, a growing neo-Nazi movement, and 
widespread anti-Semitic remarks. Regarding Ilyukhin's statements, 
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said: ``All of this is a system 
of carefully thought out views, which tear to shreds the principle 
of internationalism that the Communist Party is proclaiming.'' Interior 
Minister Sergei Stepashin said parliament ``must rigorously curb such 
statements or else it will utterly discredit itself.'' Russia's Ethnic 
Policy Ministry issued a statement saying it ``decisively condemns 
the hypocritical position of those political parties and political 
activists who, while declaring their adherence to internationalism 
and the friendship of peoples, fail to rebuke ethnic separatism, national 
chauvinism, and anti-Semitism.'' U.S. officials also criticized the 
anti-Semitic developments. In Washington on Wednesday, State Department 
spokesman James P. Rubin said, ``We join with Russian leaders in condemning 
these outrageous anti-Semitic statements.'' He said Deputy Secretary 
of State Strobe Talbott raised concerns about these issues in all 
his meetings with Russian leaders during his visit to Moscow last 
week. ``We view anti-Semitic tendencies of Duma deputies with concern 
and are dismayed that the Duma's reaction is not to condemn these 
clearly inflammatory statements,'' Rubin said.
