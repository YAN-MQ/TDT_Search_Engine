The U.S. space shuttle "Endeavour" has landed in Florida, wrapping 
up its 12-day mission that saw the birth of the international space 
station. The shuttle touched down at the Kennedy Space Center late 
last night to darkness and a deck of rain-swollen clouds. The main 
achievement of the flight was the assembly of the first block of the 
international space station which will serve as a research laboratory 
for 16 nations. The space station partners will spend the next five 
years completing the project which will require dozens of additional 
space flights.
