Republicans in Congress were bitterly divided Wednesday night over 
the timing of the air strikes against Iraq, and Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott fiercely attacked President Clinton's policy. After a meeting 
with House Republicans, Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana, the speaker-designate, 
called on Republicans and Democrats ``to support our troops now that 
they're deployed.'' But clearly skeptical of the timing of the attack, 
Livingston said, ``we'll leave that to the best judgment of the American 
people.'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is on the Armed Services 
Committee, said if Clinton acts decisively, he will win public support. 
``Obviously, there will be those who will question his motives and 
timing,'' said McCain. ``He will receive significant support because 
it's pretty obvious that Saddam Hussein is neither complying nor cooperating'' 
with international arms inspectors. But in an extraordinary rebuke 
of the president's foreign policy, Lott, stood virtually alone in 
opposing the air assault on suspected Iraqi chemical, nuclear and 
biological weapons sites, arguing that the attacks were ineffective. 
``I cannot support this military action in the Persian Gulf at this 
time,'' Lott said in a statement, infuriating the White House. ``Both 
the timing and the policy are subject to question.'' For months, Lott 
has criticized the administration for failing to take more aggressive 
steps to topple Saddam. Under pressure from Congress, Clinton enacted 
the Iraq Liberation Act in October, which earmarked $8 million to 
support Iraqi political opposition. But in a letter to Clinton on 
Wednesday, Lott and five other Senate Republicans said only $58,000 
of that money has been spent. ``I will support serious and sustained 
action but will oppose action that does not accomplish our larger 
strategic goal,'' Lott said. But even as Lott raised objections, House 
Republicans were planning to vote Thursday on a resolution of support 
for the troops in the Persian Gulf. The core of the debate among Republicans, 
who were suddenly chastened by the spectacle of impeaching the commander-in-chief 
while he launched one of the biggest military strikes since the 1991 
Persian Gulf War, was over the timing and motivations behind the aerial 
bombardment that began on Wednesday night. ``It's obvious they're 
trying to do everything they can to postpone the vote in order to 
get as much leverage as they can,'' said Rep. Gerald Solomon of New 
York, a former marine who is chairman of the House Rules Committee, 
said on CNN. ``For him to do this at this unbelievable time is just 
outrageous.'' Solomon, who is retiring this year, issued a press release 
entitled, ``Bombs Away _ Save Impeachment for Another Day?'' Rep. 
Tillie Fowler of Florida, the fifth-ranking Republican and a member 
of the House National Security Committee, said: ``I'm very suspicious 
of the timing.'' Many Republicans accused the president of bombing 
rogue nations or terrorists when he was in political binds in the 
past. The last time the United States launched air strikes, said Rep. 
Spencer Bachus of Alabama, they ``destroyed a drug store in the Sudan 
and two camels in Afghanistan.'' Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina 
put it bluntly: ``The trust level is low.'' But several other Republicans, 
many of whom are vocal critics of the White House, set aside partisan 
differences, and defended the president. ``He has our full support 
as long as he's president to take any action he deems necessary,'' 
said Rep. John Mica of Florida. ``I don't think they conflict at all.'' 
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York, who announced Wednesday that he 
would vote for impeachment, said: ``I really do believe that in sensitive 
foreign policy issues, partisanship does stop at the water's edge.'' 
Rep. John Edward Porter of Illinois, another moderate Republican, 
echoed similar sentiments: ``The president is the president. I respect 
the office and I respect the judgments that have to be made in regards 
to Iraq and the situation there.'' Democrats quickly threw their support 
to the president. Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Thomas Daschle 
of South Dakota, the House and Senate Democratic leaders, said in 
a joint statement: ``The president has made the correct decision to 
undertake military action against Iraq at this time. Any delay would 
have given Saddam Hussein time to reconstitute his arsenal of weapons 
of mass destruction and undermine support for our efforts.'' Sen. 
John Kerry, D-Mass., a decorated Vietnam veteran, said Wednesday that 
no one should question the ``legitimacy'' of Clinton's decision to 
bomb Iraq. ``I am confident that every reasonable member of the United 
States Congress and reasonable people of this country will understand 
the legitimacy of this moment. And no one will question that once 
again, once too many times, it is Hussein who has precipitated this 
confrontation and no one else.'' ``Saddam Hussein is responsible for 
the coincidence,'' said Kerry. ``Saddam Hussein is responsible for 
the timing.'' Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat 
on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, criticized Lott for violating 
an unwritten rule of backing a president's foreign policy decision 
once U.S. troops are in action. ``I'm disappointed and surprised,'' 
said Biden. ``Senator Lott doesn't do foreign policy.''
