A lot of the talk tonight has been centering around the mode of attack 
here. B-52 bombers are loaded with air-to-ground launchble cruise 
missiles. Cruise missiles have been fired by at least four U.S. Navy 
ships offshore. We thought with the help of correspondent Robert Hager 
tonight, we would look at this fierce, long range, and largely very 
accurate weapon of the 1990's. The cruise missile punishes dramatically. 
Not so dramatically as man fighters or bombers, but its big advantage 
is it doesn't put U.S. lives on the line because it's fired unmanned 
from hundreds of miles away. At a cost of $1 million each, it uses 
rocket fire to launch, but an engine like a jet plane takes over and 
wings pop out. In front, the war head and a TV camera that compares 
the target to computer images to help with accuracy. As for the war 
heads? Two main ones, one is a unitary war head which is a single, 
explosive war head, and another is a fragmented bomblette war heads. 
First used in the gulf war, it's been fired in Iraq, Bosnia, and this 
past summer in Afghanistan and Sudan. How accurately? The Pentagon 
uses the idea of a football field. They say if the target were the 
50-yard line, half the missiles would hit within 15 yards. Most or 
the rest on the field and a few in the stands or outside the stadium. 
It doesn't go through the third building in the third floor. That's 
the disadvantage but it's good enough to take the building out. There's 
a better version underdevelopment. The next generation will have a 
better camera in the nose able to send pictures back to controllers 
far away on the ground. And the missile will be able to circle for 
up to two hours while target specialists on the ground study the pictures 
and decide where and when to hit. And in the gulf tonight, the first 
cruise missiles already fired from ships and planes meant to deliver 
punishment without endangering the lives of U.S. fires. But just one 
part of what U.S. officials say will be a big, complexed orchestrated 
attack. Robert ager, NBC news, Washington.
