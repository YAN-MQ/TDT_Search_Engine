A French parliamentary inquiry into the massacres of ethnic Tutsis 
in Rwanda in 1994 reported Tuesday that France was not, as has been 
alleged, an accomplice to the killings. Instead, it says France, which 
was forced to go it alone as the rest of the world community stood 
aside, committed what is termed strategic errors. Julian Nundy reports 
from Paris. The parliamentary commissioner's report Tuesday rejects 
allegations of French complicity. Instead, it uses the words "trapped" 
and "manipulated" to describe France's dilemma. He says France was 
hampered by its own strategy or manipulated by the Hutu-led Rwandan 
government at the time. He then says that it was Rwandans alone who 
carried about the killings. According to the United Nations, some 
850,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis, were massacred in events that 
have been officially classified as genocide. The parliamentary reports 
backs the thesis of Edouard Balladur, who was then France's conservative 
prime minister, that France was the only country that tried to stop 
the carnage. It says the United States, for example, was still smarting 
from the losses it suffered when it sent peacekeeping forces to Somalia 
the previous year, almost, therefore, reluctant to get involved in 
a new African mission. Julian Nundy for VOA News, Paris.
