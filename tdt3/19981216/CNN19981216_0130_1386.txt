I work out to keep my body in shape. To help keep my mind sharp I 
take new quanterra ginkgo biloba. It helps me concentrate, maintain 
focus. Why quanterra? All ginkgos aren't the same. The patented quanterra 
extract was proven safe and effective by doctors in extensive clinical 
trials. And it increases oxygen supply to the brain. With new quanterra 
mental sharpness I feel my best, naturally.
