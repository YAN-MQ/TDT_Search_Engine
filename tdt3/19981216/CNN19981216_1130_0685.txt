Schizophrenia is a rare and often misunderstood disease. The brain 
disorder affects about 1% of the world's population, including 4 million 
Americans. Doctors don't know exactly what causes schizophrenia, but 
they believe it's a combination of biological, genetic, chemical and 
environmental factors. Symptoms usually begin in the late teens or 
early 20s, and vary greatly from person to person. The disease is 
often linked to other problems, such as substance abuse or paranoia. 
Many patients have trouble distinguishing between what is real, and 
what they perceive as reality. With the right medication, some patients 
are able to lead normal lives. I really think if I went off my medicine, 
I would end up in a psychiatric hospital. But many people don't realize 
they're sick, or refuse treatment. For those who do seek help, drugs 
alone are rarely enough. Complete treatment requires psychotherapy, 
along with social and vocational rehabilitation. For the latest health
