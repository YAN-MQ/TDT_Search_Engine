A business tycoon appealed Wednesday for a ban on the Communist Party, 
going so far as to say that force should be used if need be to prevent 
lawmakers from making anti-Semitic remarks. ``The later they use force 
the more blood that will be shed,'' said Boris Berezovsky, who is 
Jewish. His comments came a day after top Communist lawmaker Viktor 
Ilyukhin accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the country. At impeachment 
hearings Tuesday against President Boris Yeltsin, Ilyukhin also said 
Russia's post-Soviet collapse would not have happened if the government 
was not made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.'' Yeltsin's 
governments have contained a number of Jews in prominent positions, 
but they have always been outnumbered by ethnic Russians. Another 
Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, made similar anti-Semitic remarks 
at a Moscow rally in October. Berezovsky demanded the Communist Party 
be disbanded at that time as well. ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov 
should sit in the dock, and not in the Duma,'' the Interfax new agency 
quoted Berezovsky as saying. Top Russian officials also criticized 
Ilyukhin. The Duma ``must rigorously curb such statements or else 
it will utterly discredit itself,'' Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin 
said. The United States also joined in condemnation of the remarks. 
In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said: ``We 
join with Russian leaders in condemning these outrageous anti-Semitic 
statements.'' He said the issue had been raised when Vice President 
Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright recently spoke with 
Russian officials at various meetings. ``We view anti-Semitic tendencies 
of Duma deputies with concern and are dismayed that the Duma's reaction 
is not to condemn these clearly inflammatory statements,'' Rubin said. 
Members of the liberal Yabloko faction proposed a resolution denouncing 
Ilyukhin's statement, but parliament did not immediately act. Unrepentant, 
Ilyukhin responded to the motion by accusing liberals of inflaming 
anti-Semitism in Russia. ``What kind of democracy is it when a Russian 
man can't speak the truth?'' he said Wednesday. Other Communists demanded 
that Russian television networks be banned from covering the Duma's 
activities, saying coverage of Ilyukhin's remarks was biased against 
him. The business daily Kommersant speculated Wednesday that Ilyukhin 
made the statements to provoke the Kremlin into trying to ban the 
Communist Party. ``That would strengthen the party's image as the 
main opposition force,'' the newspaper said. Yeltsin banned the Communist 
Party for one year in the early 1990s, but it quickly rebounded as 
the country's leading opposition group and now has the largest faction 
in parliament's lower house, the State Duma. The Communists and Berezovsky 
have never been on good terms. Many Communists believe Berezovsky, 
one of the country's richest and most powerful businessmen, symbolizes 
the wild, unrestrained capitalism that has emerged in post-Soviet 
Russia. The Communists have also demanded that Berezovsky step down 
from his post as executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States, a loose grouping of 12 ex-Soviet republics.
