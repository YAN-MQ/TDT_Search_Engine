The world is littered with great children's books that failed to make 
the transition into great operas. Now Roald Dahl's ``Fantastic Mr. 
Fox'' is joining the list, thanks to a work commissioned from the 
composer Tobias Picker and presented by the Los Angeles Opera. I just 
hope all those fifth graders in Tuesday night's audience will accept 
a reassurance. Opera can be thrilling and terrifying. You can hear 
things you never thought possible. It's not always a matter of being 
vaguely polite (or not) to the adults who took you along. The original 
story is strong, and it works. Like much of Dahl's writing, it has 
an engaging coarseness: it reeks of greasy chicken dishes and freshly 
dug soil. These smells do not go forward into Picker's score, which 
is thoroughly nondescript. He rises reasonably to the occasion for 
the ditty that the four fox cubs sing about the three farmers who 
are the fox family's enemies, but every other ball he drops. In an 
opera whose main characters are nocturnal animals, and whose action 
unfolds after dark, the night sounds are disappointingly tame. Worse, 
foxes, hedgehogs, rats and humans all sound much the same. The music 
is woefully undercharacterized. Admittedly, there is not much help 
from the libretto, by Donald Sturrock, who is also responsible for 
the lame direction. The text is wordy and sentimental. It misses all 
the opportunities it creates. The mechanical digger with the soul 
of an artist, for instance, could have been a funny and real operatic 
character, but here she just brings one smile in the middle of the 
pervasive embarrassment. Picker gives her tuba and trombones, with 
more than a suggestion of Wagner's Fafner, but otherwise his music 
deals in small change. A couple of times it provides atmospheric, 
if rhythmically flaccid, writing for a children's chorus of tree spirits. 
There is, rather oddly, a good bit of showy if ungainly counterpoint. 
Nothing seizes the imagination. Some of the animal costumes, after 
designs by Gerald Scarfe, are delightful, especially those for the 
mole, badger and porcupine. Philip Hill gives the fox cubs neat animal 
movements. There are also some wastefully good performances, notably 
from Gerald Finley in the title role and from Jamie Offenbach as Farmer 
Bean. Apart from anything else, these two are the only members of 
the cast who get the words across; they are also both lusty singers, 
and Finley's lyrical baritone is good to hear even in indifferent 
music. Peter Ash conducts. The run ends on Tuesday.
