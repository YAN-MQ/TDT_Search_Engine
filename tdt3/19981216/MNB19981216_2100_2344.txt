Now back to what was -- supposed to be the number one course of action 
tomorrow morning. Impeachment. It was supposed to start at 10:00 A.M. 
what is the latest thinking among the floor managers as to when the 
debate will start prior to a vote? Well, this is certainly an unanticipated 
curve, but the thought was it's important tomorrow on the house floor 
to debate and pass a resolution supporting our troops and the current 
action. And then to take a break. I think the American people need 
to have a breather to grasp exactly what's happening with this new 
military action, to show respect for our troops, and then to come 
back to the impeachment proceedings. We're leaving that to our leadership 
exactly the time frame to bring it up. I would hope it would not be 
more than a 24-hour or 48-hour window before we recommence the business 
of the United States Congress. So we're talking debate on impeachment 
beginning as early as Friday, as late as Saturday? That's my recommendation. 
But obviously, there has to be flexibility with the leadership because 
we do not know what's going to happen internationally. So I think 
they're going to have to make the decision depending upon the circumstances. 
But I don't think we have to delay our action until all the hostilities 
have stopped. I think we can commence it after we allow a window there 
for respect and absorbing this action by the American people. Thank 
you very much, congressman Asa Hutchinson, the house Judiciary committee 
having just emerged from an administration briefing by William Cohen 
tonight. We appreciate your time this evening on Capitol Hill.
