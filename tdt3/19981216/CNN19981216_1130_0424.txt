A smooth landing for a smooth mission. Space shuttle "endeavour" touched 
down at Kennedy space center last night, ending an 11-day mission 
that launched the construction of the international space station. 
"Endeavour" astronauts delivered the first American part of the station. 
Three space walks were performed to hook it up to a Russian Module 
already in orbit. The next mission to the station is set for may.
