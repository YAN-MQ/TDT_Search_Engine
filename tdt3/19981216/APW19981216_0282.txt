BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors evacuated Baghdad on Wednesday, 
a day after the chief U.N. weapons inspector said Iraq reneged on 
its promise of full cooperation. Washington and London have said military 
strikes remain an option to force Baghdad's compliance. ``The staff 
of UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) has been ordered to leave Baghdad,'' 
said George Somerwill, a U.N. spokesman in Baghdad. He said no decision 
had been made on withdrawing the 400 U.N. humanitarian monitors from 
Iraq, but added that they were prepared to leave ``should it become 
necessary.'' The last three visiting teams of weapons inspectors left 
Baghdad on Monday, but up to 140 resident experts were to remain in 
the country to monitor known sites. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
Aziz dismissed the report by chief weapons inspector Richard Butler 
as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended to trigger an American 
and British military strike on Iraq.'' He said the withdrawal of the 
inspectors ``means again that the Special Commission is a tool in 
America's hand to implement its policy of aggression,'' according 
to remarks carried by the official Iraqi News Agency. British Foreign 
Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes could come quickly and without 
warning. ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings 
to Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp. interview 
Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any warning of 
what we might do.'' Iraq pledged to resume full cooperation with inspectors 
and allow unfettered access to sites and documents on Nov. 14, under 
threat of U.S. and British airstrikes. In his report to U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan on Tuesday, Butler said Iraqi obstruction, evasion and 
subterfuge made it impossible for him to assure that Baghdad's weapons 
of mass destruction have been eliminated. Those arms programs must 
be dismantled before the U.N. Security Council can lift economic sanctions 
against Iraq. The trade ban was imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait. Butler said Iraq's claim that it does not possess banned 
weapons or the ability to make them ``cannot be accepted without further 
verification.'' He said inspectors were unable to gain access to the 
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid evidence 
of the presence of proscribed materials.'' At two other sites, negotiations 
ultimately cleared the way for inspections, he said. But one building 
had been emptied of relevant materials, and the other ``had been prepared 
to avoid any disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said. Butler also 
disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons programs no longer 
exist or have been destroyed. ``It remains the commission's strong 
view that, under the present circumstances, relevant documentation 
must exist in Iraq and that provision of such documentation is the 
best hope for revealing the full picture'' of Iraqi weapons programs, 
he said.
