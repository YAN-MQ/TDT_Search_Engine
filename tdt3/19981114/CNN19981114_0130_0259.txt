President Clinton says it's up to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to 
avert a Military showdown. And that means allowing U.N. weapons inspections, 
without reservation. Wolf Blitzer reports. President Clinton appears 
to be giving Iraq a little more time to back down and allow U.N. weapons 
inspections to resume, even as the U.S. continues to build up its 
forces in the gulf. Saddam Hussein has it within its hands -- within 
his hands to end this crisis now by resuming full cooperation with 
UNSCOM. But the president's top national security advisers, who continue 
meeting at the White House, doubt that will happen. They insist time 
is quickly running out. And they reject Saddam Hussein's latest statements 
about wanting to avert a Crisis. From what we've been able to determine 
about what he said, there's nothing new in what he's saying. U.S. 
officials say air strikes would last for days, not the so-called "pinpricks" 
of the past. The goal -- to destroy as much of Iraq's weapons of mass 
destruction as possible. But they also appear to be signalling another 
objective -- We look forward to working with a post-Saddam regime, 
and we'll be working even more actively with the opposition groups. 
That is our policy. One former Pentagon official under president bush 
says removing saddam Hussein from power must be priority number one. 
This administration has resisted adopting the only policy that makes 
sense, and that is a policy of getting rid of Saddam Hussein. But 
there's no assurance even massive air strikes will bring down the 
Iraqi leader. I think that it will have the effect of undermining 
him in his own country. But I can't be sure of that. It's a chance. 
It could embolden people to support him. The White House says there's 
one way to end this crisis -- Iraq must "authoritatively, publicly 
and unconditionally rescind its decisions." In other words, Iraq must 
completely surrender as it did in 1991. Wolf Blitzer, CNN, the White 
House.
