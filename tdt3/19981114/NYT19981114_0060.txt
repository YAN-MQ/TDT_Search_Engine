Elton Brand laughs a lot. He smiles even more. Not on the basketball 
court, of course. There, he grimaces and crumbles his face into a 
scowl, or stretches it into encouraging barks at his Duke Blue Devil 
teammates. Not 18 months out of Peekskill High School, the 6-foot-9-inch, 
270-pounder has offered one surprise after another in a start-and-stop 
college career that most believe will end after this, his sophomore 
season. He showed up here on Tobacco Road with the kind of hulking 
frame that looked destined to do hard, inside labor around the blocks 
in the Atlantic Coast Conference. But Brand also demonstrated a flair 
with the ball and feathery body control that make him a threat anywhere 
on the floor. When he broke his left foot late last December, his 
coach, Mike Krzyzewski; his mother, Daisy, and some teammates circled 
his hospital bed before surgery. They were devastated. Brand wasn't. 
``It wasn't a career-ending injury or anything,'' he told them. ``There 
are so many more important things than a foot injury. I'll work on 
my schoolbooks.'' The announcement came that he was probably out for 
the season. Nearly 2 months, 15 games and a bionic-style rehabilitation 
later, Brand scored 14 points and grabbed 7 rebounds against UCLA. 
He was averaging 16 points and 7 rebounds and shooting 64.2 percent 
before the injury. He finished the season at 13.4 points, 7.3 rebounds 
and 60 percent. It is no surprise that Brand is a front-runner for 
player of the year honors and that Duke is the popular choice to win 
the national title. But no matter what happens, Brand is sitting on 
another stunner after the national title nets are cut down at St. 
Petersburg's Tropicana Field next March. Will Brand be the first Blue 
Devil under Krzyzewski to leave early for the National Basketball 
Association draft? Or will he keep the coach's streak intact? He has 
heard the question all summer, but can still beam ear to ear when 
asked. ``It seems so far-fetched to me sitting here right now to go 
to the pros,'' he said. ``I missed so many games last year. I've got 
a lot to prove. Heck, I'm unproven to myself.'' Most believe Brand 
showed how ready he was for the NBA over the summer, when he led the 
United States to a surprising gold medal at the Goodwill Games. He 
averaged 17 points and 7.6 rebounds against older players, most of 
them professionals in the European leagues. ``It gave me a taste of 
how physical it is at that level,'' Brand said. ``Every possession 
is a war, and if they think they found a weakness they keep going 
at it.'' Whatever Brand decides, Krzyzewski said his mere presence 
has already transformed perhaps the most consistent basketball program 
in the nation. Krzyzewski said he and Elton and Daisy Brand will sit 
down and discuss the future after the season. Krzyzewski has thought, 
however, about what he will demand from Brand, or any other Blue Devil 
who leaves early. He will marshal Duke's academic support staff and 
come up with a plan for the player to finish his education. ``I want 
a commitment that they get a degree _ a Duke degree,'' Krzyzewski 
said. ``I'll make it clear if they don't that it will affect my relationship 
with that player. ``If Elton is the first one, then who better? He 
is mature. He has respect for authority, great people skills and humility. 
I'd be comfortable.'' Until then, the challenge will be quickly honing 
Brand and his talented sophomore classmates _ guard William Avery, 
forward Shane Battier and center Chris Burgess _ into a battle-tested 
Duke team. Fortunately, the fifth-year senior Trajan Langdon remains 
to speed up the process. Both the coach and his team captain acknowledge 
the program is in transition. ``Just like there is becoming a younger 
NBA, we're getting younger,'' Krzyzewski said. ``You need to do more 
coaching earlier.'' Langdon concedes that the days of Duke underclassmen 
following every command of the seniors are over. ``It's a different 
vibe now,'' he said. ``When Cherokee Parks told me to do something, 
I did it without question. I'm still the leader, but the younger guys 
will tell me their opinion. It's not better or worse, just different.'' 
Brand is respectful of Duke's senior tradition, but counts himself 
among the team's leaders. Last year, as a freshman, he alternately 
encouraged and challenged the senior Roshown McLeod, and it was part 
of what pushed McLeod to become a first-round draft pick. ``I'm a 
vocal guy; I can't help it,'' said Brand, unable to suppress another 
laugh. ``But I also know that no one player can carry a team. That 
isn't Duke basketball.'' For the next five months at least, that's 
all that matters to him.
