Iraq will allow United Nations weapons inspectors to return to Iraq 
and resume inspections, Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon told 
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Saturday. Hamdoon met with Annan 
at the secretary general's house in New York to deliver a letter from 
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that apparently diffused the 
crisis. The letter said inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency will be allowed to resume 
work at suspected weapons sites. ``They will be allowed any minute 
they want to go back and to resume their normal work,'' Hamdoon told 
reporters at Annan's house. The Security Council planned to meet at 
3:30 p.m. (2030 GMT) to discuss the situation. Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein had said previously that inspections could resume only after 
the council agreed to start a review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. 
resolutions that would lead to the lifting of sanctions. The Security 
Council had offered to hold a review once Iraq resumed cooperation, 
but refused to promise that it would lead to the end of sanctions. 
Annan had sent a letter to Iraqi leaders Friday urging them to resume 
cooperation before an expected U.S. military strike. Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin had sent a similar message to Saddam. ``The appeal of 
the secretary general, which we highly trust, and the appeal also 
of the president of the Russian Federation has helped in trying to 
reach out to a situation where Iraq's point of view gets promoted,'' 
Hamdoon said Saturday. ``We think now we have had a better hearing 
for our position and that the council hopefully will be more positive 
on the question of the comprehensive review that hopefully will be 
leading to the lifting of the sanctions.''
