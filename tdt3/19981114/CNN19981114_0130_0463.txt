A new Arena being built for the NBA's Miami heat caught fire Friday. 
Flames could be seen shooting from the American airlines Arena along 
the waterfront. Authorities say the fire could have been caused by 
a welder's torch. Construction on the 20,000-seat facility began back 
in January. It is scheduled to open in December of next year.
