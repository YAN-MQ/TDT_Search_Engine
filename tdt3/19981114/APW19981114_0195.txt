For the second time this year, sugar planters and millers are demanding 
that the government raise the controlled price of the commodity, a 
local newspaper reported Saturday. The growers and millers are threatening 
to stop all sugar production from the beginning of next month if their 
demands are not met, the Bangkok Post said. The move could force Thailand 
to make large-scale imports of sugar for the first time in decades 
and raise the price of sugar for consumers from the current level 
of 11-15 baht a kilogram (dlrs 0.14-0.19 a pound) to as much as 20 
baht a kilogram (dlrs 0.25 a pound), the newspaper reported. Growers 
and millers are seeking a price of 785 baht (dlrs 21.22) per ton for 
sugar, with growers taking a government-mandated 70 percent share 
and millers 30 percent, said the report. The sugar producers claim 
a hike is necessitated by rising production costs, said the paper, 
quoting an unnamed source who estimated they would be at least 710 
baht (dlrs 19.19)per ton for the 1998-99 season. In April, the government 
rejected demands by sugarcane planters to raise domestic sugar prices, 
a politically sensitive issue during the current recession. The Commerce 
Ministry ruled out a request for a price hike of 3 baht (8 cents) 
per kilogram, following talks with 10 planters. The rejection came 
after the producers called off a threatened mass demonstration the 
capital after the government had tentatively worked out a compromise 
on the price hikes. Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the House committee 
on agriculture Friday, an industry official recalled the failed deal. 
``The government has failed to keep its promise of a fair price that 
would enable the industry to continue functioning,'' Rachai Chusilpkul, 
secretary general of the Federation of Sugarcane Farmers of Thailand 
was quoted as saying by the Post. The new protest will not include 
any mass rallies, the newspaper quoted industry sources as saying.
