The Malaysian government said Saturday that U.S. Secretary of State 
Madeline Albright should not meddle in Malaysia's internal affairs 
by meeting with the wife of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. 
Malaysia's Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said that Albright 
would be in Malaysia as a guest. ``She should know what to do,'' he 
said. Mrs. Albright will be attending the summit of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation. She announced earlier in the week that she intended 
to meet with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail. ``Foreign officials and 
leaders attending the APEC meetings should not interfere in Malaysia's 
affairs,'' Abdullah told the Malaysian government news agency Bernama. 
Many world leaders have voiced concern over Anwar's ouster from government 
and his alleged beating by police after his arrest Sept. 20. To Malaysia's 
discontent, several high-ranking foreign officials have said they 
hoped to meet with Azizah Ismail while in Kuala Lumpur. ``Malaysia 
does not expect its guests to interfere in its internal affairs. This 
(also) goes for other leaders in APEC,'' the foreign minister added. 
That did not stop the Canadian foreign minister from having lunch 
with Azizah on Saturday. Mrs. Albright was scheduled to arrive in 
Kuala Lumpur Saturday. Details of her announced meeting with Azizah 
were not available.
