The menu today in college football doesn't get much tastier. Later 
this afternoon, it's cool mountain weather, a packed house at neyland 
stadium, and top-ranked undefeated Tennessee hosting number ten and 
also unbeated Arkansas. Perhaps they've surpassed what they thought 
they might be at this point, but they're playing with an incredible 
amount of confidence and using good players very well. It's almost 
like looking at ourselves in the mirror. The number two team in the 
country has a dogfight as well. Kansas state welcomes the number 11 
cornhuskers of Nebraska to Manhattan. Now, the Wildcats are favored, 
but don't forget, they have lost to Nebraska 29 straight times. All 
right, in less than an hour, number four Florida hopes to extend the 
nation's longest home winning streak to 27 as it welcomes South Carolina 
to the swamp. And tell me Missouri's not out for some revenge today. 
The tigers are in college station for the first time since getting 
demolished, 73-0, in 1993. Undefeated Wisconsin is at the big house, 
but will the wolverine defense that pounded away at Penn state show 
up? Speaking of the nittany lions, they will try to recuperate from 
that loss against northwestern.
