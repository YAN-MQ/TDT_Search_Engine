The beauty of sports is that no matter how unbeatable someone looks, 
there is no sure thing. The 49ers and the Packers lose. Tiger Woods 
and Martina Hingis lose. Later or maybe sooner, the Yankees and the 
Bulls will lose. But will the Tennessee women's basketball team ever 
lose? The Lady Vols have won 45 consecutive games and the last three 
national championships. In separate preseason polls, 42 news media 
members and 40 coaches have unanimously chosen them to repeat. Even 
such major rivals as Louisiana Tech and Connecticut say that Tennessee 
seems almost a sure bet. Louisiana Tech, with its great basketball 
tradition, has the depth and up-tempo game to challenge Tennessee, 
but Coach Leon Barmore said Tennessee was so deep that it could probably 
beat an all-star team from all the other colleges combined. And as 
Geno Auriemma, the UConn coach, said, ``The only thing that would 
hurt Tennessee is if they lose interest.'' ``They put better players 
out there,'' Auriemma said. ``That's 75 percent of the battle. They've 
got tremendous players. They've got a tradition where they're expected 
to win and they expect to win. They've got terrific coaching. They 
play hard. They know what they're doing. Before you walk on the court 
against them, you have to believe you're a better team.'' Connecticut 
may not be a better team, not yet, anyway, but it has exciting possibilities. 
For all of Pat Summitt's huge coaching success at Tennessee, Auriemma 
has also had a big run at UConn, with the best record in the nation 
(166-11) over the last five seasons. His teams have played in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament the last 10 seasons 
and have won the Big East regular-season and tournament titles the 
last five seasons. And while Tennessee has the best player around 
in 6-foot-2-inch Chamique Holdsclaw, and all those gifted sophomores, 
UConn has great potential from its latest superstar in waiting and 
a freshman class almost as promising as Tennessee's was last year. 
If UConn is to threaten Tennessee for national supremacy, it must 
get peak performances from many players. Start with its 6-2 Russian, 
Svetlana Abrosimova. Last year, as a 17-year-old freshman struggling 
in a strange country, she was tough on and off the court. She would 
stay up to 4 a.m. writing papers in a language she was still trying 
to master, and then she would play basketball with stunning offensive 
skills. Over the last five seasons, UConn has turned out such all-Americans 
and national players of the year as Rebecca Lobo, Jennifer Rizzotti, 
Kara Wolters and Nykesha Sales. Comfortable or not, and she is not 
thrilled by it, Abrosimova is the designated successor. ``She needs 
to be great because she can be,'' Auriemma said. ``There's not much 
she can't do.'' Abrosimova is resigned to the challenge. ``I feel 
people are expecting me to be the best player on the team,'' she said. 
``I don't think seriously about it. I don't want to force anything, 
just do my part.'' Abrosimova likes to handle the ball, and Auriemma 
kids her about it. ``Whenever we do defensive drills,'' he said, ``she 
comes up with an injury that sends her to the trainer's room. When 
we do offensive drills, she has a miraculous recovery.'' Aside from 
Abrosimova, UConn's best returning players are 6-5 Paige Sauer, who 
is becoming a dominant post player; 5-11 Amy Duran, an outside gunner, 
and 6-0 Shea Ralph, whose fiery drives to the basket have not been 
tamed by two reconstructions of her right knee five months apart. 
Enter that gifted freshman class of five high school all-Americans. 
Three of them _ Swin Cash, Tamika Williams and Asjha (pronounced Asia) 
Jones _ are 6-2 power forwards. The two others _ 5-9 Sue Bird and 
5-8 Keirsten Walters _ are guards. At the moment, Bird, a shooting 
guard in high school, is starting at point guard and Cash at forward. 
Auriemma said all five were playing instinctively and learning quickly. 
``They are going to have to contribute significantly on a regular 
basis,'' he said. ``It may not be realistic to expect all of them 
to be great every day, but we need two or three every day, every game. 
Some days, all five will play terrific and the returning guys will, 
too, and we'll look terrific. And some days we're going to struggle. 
``The freshmen are good and they have personalities that fit in. You 
never see that attitude that if I don't get the ball three or four 
times in a row, I'm going to break out in a rash. They've been around. 
They've played overseas. It's a different world from when kids thought 
they needed a visa to get from New Hampshire to Storrs.'' Ralph sat 
out last season after her two potentially career-ending knee operations. 
Now, as in her freshman year, she will probably be the first player 
off the bench. She acknowledges she has lost a step, but her enthusiasm, 
which had always been near the boiling point, is undiminished. ``I 
didn't know how much I loved basketball,'' she said, ``until it was 
taken away from me. I feel like I've been given a second chance.'' 
Auriemma marvels at her return. ``She used to be Barry Sanders: get 
the ball, weave, get to the basket, score, get fouled,'' he said. 
``Now she's more like Ironhead Heyward: put your shoulder down and 
run over people. We're trying to get her to be a combination of the 
two.'' No matter how good Ralph and her teammates become, Tennessee's 
veteran team, 39-0 last season, looms large. The starters are Holdsclaw, 
the senior small forward; Kellie Jolly, the underrated senior point 
guard, and three of those super sophomores _ the 6-1 power forward 
Tamika Catchings, the 5-10 shooting guard Semeka Randall and the 6-3 
center Teresa Geter. The only place the Lady Vols needed help was 
at center, because 6-3 LaShonda Stephens, last year's starter, is 
sidelined by arthritic knees. Their only two recruits were centers 
_ 6-5 Michelle Snow and 6-3 Shalon Pillow. Summitt seems worried about 
complacency. ``We're certainly not as strong a team as you saw in 
March,'' she said. ``This team looks very human, very beatable at 
times. It puzzles me that it is not the defensive team I'm accustomed 
to. We need to get back to a blue-collar mentality and influence opponents. 
For the first time with this group, I'm concerned about a lack of 
commitment to defense and rebounding.'' For all of Summitt's fears 
or rhetoric, her fellow coaches say Tennessee's dominance is good 
for the sport. ``When the men's collegiate game really took off,'' 
said Coach Chris Gobrecht of Southern California, ``is when all the 
Cinderella teams started to appear in the tournament. Schools began 
to realize anybody could do this. They could all share in this magic. 
It began to intrigue the general public so much.'' And Coach Joe Ciampi 
of Auburn said: ``I'm not tired of talking about Tennessee. You need 
an example of what you're shooting for. Size is still important, but 
it really comes down to having players with the right combination 
of athletic ability and basketball skills.'' Tennessee has that. As 
Summitt said, ``I feel pressure when we don't have players.''
