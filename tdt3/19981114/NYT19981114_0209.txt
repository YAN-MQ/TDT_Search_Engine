After losing to Notre Dame and Air Force on consecutive Saturdays, 
Army could have used a breather this Saturday. Instead, it had to 
contend with a third straight top-25 team in Tulane. Not only that, 
but the Green Wave (No. 14 Associated Press, No. 71 the New York Times 
computer) came into Saturday's game at 8-0, the second highest scoring 
team in Division I-A (42.5 points per game). Army, meanwhile, had 
not only lost three in a row, but had also scored only 37 points in 
those games while yielding 92. But the Cadets, in a gallant effort, 
almost matched that point total while playing Tulane even through 
the first half before succumbing, 49-35, before a crowd of 39,038 
at Michie Stadium. It took a record-breaking performance by Tulane 
quarterback Shaun King to subdue the Cadets. King, who came into the 
game ranked second in Division I-A in passing efficiency, threw for 
three touchdowns and ran for three more, completing 23 of 31 passes 
for 332 yards and running 17 times for 135 yards. He became the first 
Tulane quarterback to amass more than 300 yards passing and 100 yards 
rushing in a game. ``He did a great job in executing their offense,'' 
Army Coach Bob Sutton said, ``and he made some gigantic plays running 
the ball.'' The score was tied four times _ the last time at 28-28 
_ before Tulane scored three of the last four touchdowns in an exciting 
game largely devoid of defense. Poor tackling late in the game, along 
with several dropped passes, hurt the Cadets (2-7, 2-3 Conference 
USA), who pulled to within 7 points at 42-35 on Craig Stucker's second 
touchdown run with 10 minutes 54 seconds left. Army then drove to 
Tulane's 23-yard line with less than 5 minutes remaining before a 
fourth-down pass by Johnny Goff was dropped at the 10-yard line by 
split end Gary Williams. King sealed the victory for Tulane on a 20-yard 
run with 1:59 left to put Tulane at 9-0 (5-0 Conference USA) for the 
first time since 1931, when the Green Wave won all 11 regular-season 
games before losing to Southern California in the Rose Bowl. In his 
final game at Michie Stadium, the left-handed Goff had the best game 
of his career. The senior quarterback connected on 10 of 20 passes 
for 178 yards _ the first time he had surpassed 100 yards passing 
_ and a touchdown and led all Army runners with 148 yards on 19 carries. 
``Johnny showed a lot of courage and character today,'' Sutton said 
of his oft-maligned quarterback. ``Maybe some people will get off 
his tail now.''
