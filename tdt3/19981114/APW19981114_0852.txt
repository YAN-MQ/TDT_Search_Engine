Frenchman Fabrice Tiozzo had no problems defending his WBA cruizerweight 
title Saturday, knocking out Brazilian Ezequiel Paixao in the second 
round. After putting his opponent on his knees with a strong right 
in the final seconds of the first round, a second-round combination 
from the 29-year-old from Lyon was enough to finish the fight. It 
was Tiozzo's second defense of the title that he won in November 1997 
by beating American Nate Miller in Las Vegas.
