Igor Razoryonov of Ukraine hoisted 232.5 kilos on his last clean-and-jerk 
attempt and took the 105-kilo category title at the World weightlifting 
Championships Saturday. Razoryonov lifted a total of 422.5 kilos, 
exceeding last year's world 108-kilo category winner Cui Wenhua of 
China and his own teammate, Denys Gottfried. Cui finished second with 
420 kilos while Gottfried was third with 415 kilos. In the 94-kilo 
category, Olympic champion Akakias Kakiasvilis of Greece, the dominating 
lifter at 99 kilos the last years, lifted 400.0 kilos to claim the 
title. He also won the clean-and-jerk gold. Oliver Caruso of Germany 
prevented a Greek sweep with a 395-kilo total for the silver, 2 1-2 
more than Leonidas Kokkas, who took the overall bronze. A record 71 
countries and 391 lifters are competing in the championships: 253 
men and 138 women. The event will finish Sunday.
