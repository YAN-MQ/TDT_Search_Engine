New rules in one-design sailing are encouraging amateurs at the expense 
of professionals. But the seascape is as competitive as ever in yacht 
racing. Consider the names of boats entered this week in the 1998 
Mumm 30 World Championship: Instigator, Menace, Stinger, Trouble and 
Twisted Lizard. Ken Read, a world-class champion, plans to keep a 
low profile amid the onslaught of amateurs. ``I'm not sure classes 
like this want people like me around,'' Read said in a telephone interview 
last week. ``As a rule of thumb, I plan to play as much golf as I 
sail. It will kind of be my self-handicap.'' Read usually takes over 
the helm for wealthy boat owners at international regattas. As a six-time 
champion in the J-24 Class and a former America's Cup trials helmsman 
from Newport, R.I., the 37-year-old Read is at the pinnacle of his 
sport. But at the four-day Mumm regatta scheduled to begin Tuesday 
at Hilton Head Island, S.C., he will not be allowed to steer. One-design 
class rules these days are trying to reserve the helmsman position 
for amateur boat owners. At Hilton Head, 35 boats from 6 countries 
are expected to compete. It is an international event with an amateur 
flavor. ``What we don't want is for someone to come in and wreck the 
class,'' said Geoff Stagg, marketing agent for Bruce Farr &AMP; Associates, 
the Mumm 30's designer. ``We are monitoring the skill level of the 
class. It can be a very contentious thing, but the owners love it.'' 
By monitoring, Stagg means making sure that none of sailing's rock 
star professionals compete at the wheel against the amateurs who own 
Mumm 30s. A limited number of pros can sail on the boats, but they 
cannot man the helm. It's a way of assuring amateur owners _ who pay 
$118,000 for a new Mumm 30 _ that they will not be upstaged by another 
boat's pro driver. Read will sail as one of six crew members on Off 
the Gauge, a Mumm 30 owned by a longtime friend, Jack LeFort, of Stuart, 
Fla. But LeFort, an amateur sailor, has bought into the right to steer 
his own boat. Read agrees with the owner/amateur/helmsman idea, despite 
its potential for costing him jobs. ``What people lose sight of,'' 
he said, ``is that this sport revolves around people who pay the bills 
and still want to have plenty of fun. The Mumm 36 Class has hit the 
problem head-on, and it's one of the few that has.'' The owner-driver 
rule has emerged over the last few years. Besides the Mumm 30, the 
rule exists in some form in classes such as the Shock 35, the Farr 
40 and the One Design 35. The concept is untried in more than 75 of 
the other one-design classes recognized by U.S. Sailing, the sport's 
governing authority. Developers of the Mumm 30 Class have been relatively 
lenient with its amateur designation. Stagg said that of the 143 boats 
built since the inception of the class in 1996, 5 or so owners have 
a degree of professional status. One is JB Braun, part-owner of Thalia, 
a Mumm 30 expected to compete this week. His co-owner from Marblehead, 
Mass., is Bob Shear, an amateur. Braun is rated by U.S. Sailing as 
a Category 3 sailor, a designation that ranks him as a professional. 
He is a commercial sailmaker, and in 1988, was an alternate for the 
Olympic Flying Dutchman Class. The Mumm 30 Class has accommodated 
Braun through a clause requiring Category 3 sailors to put up a substantial 
part of a new boat's price. For a new Mumm 30, that would be about 
$50,000, or about 50 percent of the cost. Braun says that is fair. 
``The rule is there to stop people who are working for marine companies 
from getting paid just to go sailing,'' he said. ``By owning a boat, 
it shows a personal commitment to the class. And I think that's healthy.'' 
Jim Allsopp, a sailmaker from Annapolis, Md., has got around the rule 
by buying a Mumm 30 himself. When that proved too costly, he sold 
his boat and bought half of Moxie, a Mumm 30 owned by George Collins, 
a retired investment executive from Annapolis. ``When you say owners 
and amateurs, I don't think of myself as a professional,'' he said 
recently. ``I have a full-time job as a sailmaker. But I work from 
9-to-5 and sail as much as I can. I don't get paid to step on a boat, 
and that's a huge difference.''
