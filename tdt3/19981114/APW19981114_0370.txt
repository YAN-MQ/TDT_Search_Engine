Todd Martin rallied from a set down to beat Tim Henman 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 
Saturday to reach the final of the Stockholm Open for the second time 
since 1996. The American played near flawless tennis after losing 
the first set to the third-seeded Briton. ``I was fortunate to get 
back in the match after I lost the first set,'' he said. ``I served 
well. He lost his rhythm.'' Martin, unseeded here and ranked 21st 
in the world, will meet Greg Rusedski or Thomas Johansson in Sunday's 
final in one of the world's oldest indoors. Martin also reached the 
1996 final at the Royal Tennis Hall, but lost to Thomas Enqvist. ``But 
I was killed in that final,'' he said. ``I hope it will be different 
this time.'' Martin won one ATP title this year in Barcelona on clay. 
He also reached the semis in Indianapolis, Vienna and Paris Indoor. 
After dropping the opening set, Martin broke Henman twice to level 
the match at one set apiece. Martin got off to a perfect start in 
the decider, breaking Henman's serve after two straight unforced errors 
by the Briton. He broke Henman again to lead 4-1 and then held his 
serve the rest of the way. It was Martin's third win against one loss 
to Henman.
