CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley urged Egyptian 
business executives Saturday to expand their trade with other Middle 
Eastern states, including Israel, despite political difficulties. 
Daley said he was asking Middle Eastern governments to reconvene a 
meeting of Arab and Israeli trade ministers -- the so-called Taba 
group -- and perhaps even a Middle East and North Africa economic 
conference next year. ``We would hope that in 1999 we could see both 
a Taba ministers meeting and a MENA conference, at some point,'' Daley 
said. ``After all the efforts to bring peace, Egypt and its neighbors 
cannot afford to let economic cooperation go by the wayside.'' The 
commerce secretary was speaking to officials and business executives 
in Cairo on the Egyptian leg of a regional tour. He held talks with 
President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday. The Taba group -- which includes 
the trade ministers of Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian National Authority, 
Jordan and the U.S. -- was set up in the wake of the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian 
peace agreement to remove barriers to trade in the Middle East. Daley 
said the group has not met in more than two years as a result of political 
tension between Arab nations and Israel. The MENA conference series, 
designed to build economic ties between Arabs and Israelis, is also 
on hold after a number of Arab countries boycotted last year's conference 
in Qatar to protest what they saw as Israel's failure to implement 
the peace accords. Daley warned that Middle Eastern nations, whose 
trade with each other amounts to just 7 percent of their total trade, 
were missing out on opportunities for growth. ``That's a situation 
that's got to be changed in order to strengthen the economies of each 
of the countries in this region,'' he said. Daley said effective regional 
cooperation would have to include Israel. ``Israel's a rather large 
piece of the economy, when you take the entire Middle East, and to 
have a regional pact that just denies Israel wouldn't accomplish what 
I would imagine a number of the Arab countries would want, which is 
a bigger piece of the pie.'' Israel's trade with Arab countries is 
extremely limited. Israel said in May that its trade with Egypt grew 
to just dlrs 85 million in 1997 from dlrs 83 million in 1996, against 
total Israeli trade of dlrs 51.5 billion in 1997 and dlrs 50.5 billion 
in 1996. Israeli trade with Jordan grew to dlrs 33 million in 1997 
from dlrs 14 million in 1996.
