Weary delegates concluded their global warming summit early Saturday 
by setting out a plan of action to begin finding ways to scale back 
heat-trapping pollutants. After an all-night struggle, delegates to 
the U.N. climate summit from 160 nations united in a pre-dawn session 
behind a ``Buenos Aires plan of action'' that maps out specific strategies 
for carrying out the 1997 Kyoto pact designed to alleviate global 
warming. ``This plan of action adds real momentum to the Kyoto protocol,'' 
said Stuart Eizenstat, the chief U.S. delegate. In December 1997, 
the United States and 37 other industrial nations agreed in Kyoto, 
Japan, to binding reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions by 
2012 _ setting a target 5 percent below 1990 levels. Saturday's agreement 
sets out a timetable for discussing by 2000 the many issues that still 
need to be settled, including: whether to assess penalties against 
those who don't achieve their goals; how to transfer climate-friendly 
technology to developing countries so they pollute less; and the nuts 
and bolts of how to measure the pollutants. ``The document we have 
just approved establishes a foundation for speeding up the process 
of fulfilling the objectives'' of the Kyoto accord, said Maria Julia 
Alsogaray, the Argentina chairwoman and conference president. At stake 
is one of Earth's most troubling environmental issues: undue warming 
of the planet believed to be exacerbated by carbon dioxide released 
from burning coal and gas, principally from power plants and cars. 
The United States and Europe favored 2000 as the deadline for setting 
gritty details needed to flesh out the Kyoto accord; China and India 
reportedly opposed a deadline at one point in the talks. A key issue 
yet to be resolved is a U.S.-European quarrel over the ``trading'' 
of emissions credits. The United States seeks unfettered trading of 
credits with countries that have more than met their pollution targets, 
helping to blunt the cost of cleaning up at home. The European Union, 
however, wants limits on trading, saying the priority should be actual 
greenhouse gas reductions at home, not just on paper. In a surprise 
move that rattled developing nations, Argentina and Kazakstan announced 
they would voluntarily seek binding emissions targets like their industrial 
counterparts. China and India, two developing nations that could surpass 
the United States as leading greenhouse gas polluters next century, 
opposed even talking about voluntary participation by the emerging 
world. Hoping to energize the talks, the United States on Thursday 
signed the Kyoto accord, the last major industrial country to do so. 
But the signing was largely symbolic because Senate ratification is 
not likely anytime soon. The Clinton administration has said it won't 
ask the Senate to consider the treaty until developing countries such 
as India and China agree to participate _ and that could take years. 
In Washington, U.S. government scientists reported new evidence Friday 
of Earth's undue warming, saying last month's global average temperature 
of 58.14 degrees Fahrenheit (14.52 Celsius) fell just short of the 
58.15-degree (14.53 Celsius) record set in October 1997.
