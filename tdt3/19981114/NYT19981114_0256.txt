The fans came back to Nassau Coliseum Saturday night, but the team 
they came to see never showed. Playing in front of the largest home 
crowd this season, the Islanders bombed. They looked nothing like 
the team that has recently flirted with first place in the Atlantic 
Division. Instead, they looked like the Islanders of old, losing by 
5-3 to the Capitals in front of a boisterous crowd of 14,538. One 
game after dominating the Montreal Canadiens at home, the Islanders 
couldn't get anything going against the struggling Capitals. Even 
goalie Tommy Salo had a tough time. The Islanders scored first and 
led, 1-0, briefly in the first period, but the Capitals took over, 
scoring four straight goals, three coming in the second period, to 
take a commanding 4-1 lead. It should not have been a tough game for 
the Islanders. Once again, the Capitals (5-7-3) are beset by injuries. 
Saturday night, the defending Eastern Conference champions played 
without Sergei Gonchar (knee), Steve Konowalchuk (ankle), Michal Pivonka 
(shoulder), Steve Malgunas (hip), Jaroslav Svejkovsky (ankle) and 
Richard Zednik (shoulder). The long list of injuries _ which actually 
is not quite as long as it was last week _ has contributed to the 
team's slow start. The Capitals are in last place in the Southeast 
Division, behind the woeful Lightning. As if the injuries weren't 
enough, the Capitals' goalie has also struggled this season. After 
leading the Capitals to the Stanley Cup finals last season, Olaf Kolzig 
had a meager 3-7-1 record and an .898 save percentage entering Saturday 
night's game. But the Islanders were badly out-played in the game's 
first 20 minutes, getting outshot by 15-6. The score was 1-1 when 
the period ended, thanks to Salo's superb play in goal. The goals 
were scored by Kenny Jonsson of the Islanders at 7 minutes 19 seconds 
and Ken Klee of the Capitals at 16:48. In the second period, Washington 
got three straight goals _ from Andrei Nikolishin, James Black and 
Brian Bellows _ to stretch its lead to 4-1. A shell-shocked Salo was 
pulled after Bellows' goal, which may have been stoppable, and was 
replaced by Wade Flaherty at 14:29. Trevor Linden, the Islanders' 
captain, scored on a power play at 17:50 of the second period, cutting 
his team's deficit to 4-2. It was Linden's team-best seventh goal 
of the season. Adam Oates scored at 13:30 of the third period to give 
the Capitals a 5-2 lead with 6:30 remaining. Linden scored again at 
16:52, but by then it was too late.
