A Florida prosecutor has charged the church of scientology with two 
felonies. The church is accused of neglect or abuse of a disabled 
adult and unauthorized practice of medicine. Authorities say 36-year-old 
Lisa McPherson was denied her fluids for at least five days while 
under the care of fellow church members. Scientology officials deny 
that and say they are not responsible for her death. They say the 
charges are part of a 15-year attempt to discredit the church. McPherson's 
family has also filed a wrongful death suit against the Los angeles-based 
church.
