Hey, everybody, meet augsburg wide receiver Scott vistendall. Even 
though you probably never heard of him, he's still really good. So 
good, in fact, that he broke Jerry rice's college record for career 
receiving yards, finishing his career with 4,696 yards. And an accomplishment 
like that has to be the "play of the day."
