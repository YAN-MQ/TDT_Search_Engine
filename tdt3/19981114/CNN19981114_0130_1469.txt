Monday is a big day for footsie, a German Shepherd mix born without 
hind paws. Footsie was found abandoned in Buffalo, New York. The dog 
gets around by dragging himself on his front paws. But on Monday, 
footsie will have his first fitting for a pair of artificial legs. 
Veterinarians say the hardest part will be keeping the legs on. They 
plan to use velcro straps and plastic sockets attached to the dog's 
hind legs.
