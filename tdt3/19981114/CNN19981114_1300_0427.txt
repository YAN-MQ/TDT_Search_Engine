In the weekly republican radio address, Idaho senator-elect Mike Crapo 
said the current problems with Iraq justify an increase in military 
spending. Crapo says the various missions faced by the U.S. military 
are reasons enough for appropriating additional money to the defense 
program. Crapo says that's not the only thing on which republicans 
want to focus attention. They're also concerned about education. Education 
of our children requires and deserves the best our societiy can offer. 
To support local efforts, we will work to reduce the bureaucracy and 
mondaydates from Washington that interfere with school districts and 
require that at least 95% of all federal education dollars are spent 
in the classroom.
