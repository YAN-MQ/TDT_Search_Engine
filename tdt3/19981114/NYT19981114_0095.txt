Last month, the Daily Telegraph, Britain's most respected conservative 
newspaper, published a column by Tom Utley, one of its regular contributors. 
Utley said the time had come for him to make a public confession: 
He didn't like gay people. ``If my suspicion is right, the great majority 
of us still believe, in our heart of hearts, that there is something 
nasty and wrong about homosexual intercourse,'' he wrote. ``What has 
changed is that it is no longer considered respectable to say so publicly. 
Whereas half a century ago, it was a jolly brave thing to invite scorn 
by admitting to a weakness for the love that dared not speak its name, 
today all the opprobrium is directed at those of us who disapprove.'' 
Utley added that he was expecting a deluge of mail attacking him for 
his view. Instead, he said a few days later, he had been startled 
to receive the opposite: more than 500 letters in support of his editorial. 
``I do think people are mildly anti-homosexual,'' said his boss, Charles 
Moore, the editor of the Telegraph. While the Telegraph was having 
its mostly one-sided discussion, a larger debate was being played 
out in Britain over the issue of homosexuality in political life. 
In recent weeks, one Cabinet minister has resigned in disgrace after 
being beaten up and robbed in a park known as a gay hangout, and the 
nation has been informed that at least two other Cabinet ministers 
it thought were heterosexual were in fact homosexual (a fourth has 
been openly gay for years). Nobody knew quite how to cope with this 
news, although Prime Minister, Tony Blair said he didn't care about 
the sexual orientation of his ministers, only their job performance. 
The Sun, Britain's most popular daily newspaper, took the opportunity 
to declare its fear that Britain was being run by a ``gay Mafia.'' 
The Sun then dramatically flip-flopped, saying that it had changed 
its mind and would no longer out anyone who didn't want to be outed. 
But its abrupt vacillations reflected a broader disquiet in the country, 
which is in a serious muddle over homosexuals and gay rights. ``There 
are more and more people coming out and that's why we have a greater 
tolerance now,'' said Mark Watson, communications director of Stonewall, 
a group that lobbies on gay and lesbian issues. ``But Britain has 
always had a problem with sex as a whole. We're not very good at discussing 
it.'' It is that attitude that underlies a strain of traditional comedy 
in Britain, in which sexuality is broached in innuendo or in entendre-laden 
slapstick _ the ``nudge-nudge, wink-wink'' approach lampooned so effectively 
by Monty Python. One of the stock characters in the popular British 
Christmas pantomimes is the Dame _ a cross-dressing man with a booming 
voice and hairy legs who does things like strip down to reveal a pair 
of blinking light bulbs on his chest. Everyone thinks he's hilarious; 
no one discusses why. But those things are associated with an older 
generation, Watson said, and society is actually becoming more open. 
At the same time, the law has failed to catch up. This is partly because 
until the Labor government came to power 18 months ago, the country 
was run for nearly 20 years by the Tory party, which represents an 
older, more conservative generation. As a result, Britain has few 
laws supporting homosexual rights. Consenting sex between two gay 
men in private was partly decriminalized in 1967, although sex involving 
more than two men, or sex in a public place (which technically includes 
hotel rooms) is still illegal, as is sex between two men if either 
is under the age of 18. Although the House of Commons voted to lower 
the age at which gay men could have sex to 16 last year, the move 
was thwarted by the House of Lords _ after a debate in which many 
of the Lords, ex public-school boys, railed against the idea of ``buggery'' 
between teachers and schoolchildren. In addition, there are no laws 
protecting homosexuals against discrimination at work, and no laws 
giving gay and lesbian couples the same rights as married couples, 
in housing, estate taxes, and the like. ``There's a dichotomy between 
the laws of this country, which are very restrictive, and what's actually 
happening on the ground,'' Watson said. ``In London, certainly, there 
is a great tolerance. London is probably one of the gay capitals of 
the world.'' Ben Bradshaw, a young and telegenic member of Parliament 
from Exeter, was a beneficiary of the newfound tolerance during the 
last election, when he ran as an openly gay candidate against an openly 
homophobic candidate who urged people not to let ``the pink flag fly 
over Exeter.'' When Bradshaw won the election, he refused to shake 
his opponent's hand. But if life is becoming easier for him and others, 
why did so many people agree with Utley's anti-gay editorial? ``It's 
a generational thing,'' Watson said. ``The Telegraph readers are the 
same people who didn't embrace Blair's new Britain, who are being 
left behind by what is becoming a more inclusive and tolerant society.'' 
On the other hand, as Mrs. M. Williams from Ashton-in-Makerfield, 
Lancashire, one of Utley's fans, wrote approvingly to the Telegraph: 
``My sincere thanks to Tom Utley for his clear and honest statement 
on homosexuality. I am sure he puts into words the view of the vast 
majority.''
