Buoyed by a public tribute from his mother and an improved standing 
in an opinion poll, Prince Charles celebrated his 50th birthday Saturday 
in private with friends and his longtime love, Camilla Parker Bowles. 
Some 250 guests were invited to the part at Highgrove, Charles' home 
in Gloucestershire. The invitation list included the Queen Sophia 
of Spain, King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway and ex-King Constantine 
of Greece, according to Press Association, the British news agency. 
On Friday night, Queen Elizabeth II hosted a birthday party at Buckingham 
Palace. Rock music mixed with classical; jugglers and ``aliens'' mingled 
with celebrities; street theatre collided with harpists, a military 
band and an opera company. Representatives of the 400 organizations 
Charles has been associated with were also in attendance. The queen 
toasted her son's ``vision, compassion and leadership.'' ``Charles, 
tonight's party is a tribute to all that you have achieved,'' said 
the queen, who broke tradition by publicly addressing her son by his 
first name. ``I can think of no better recognition of your first half-century 
than this remarkable gathering.'' Mrs. Parker Bowles was not at the 
palace party, lending substance to reports that the queen is not happy 
with the relationship. Charles' late wife, Princess Diana, had blamed 
Charles' continuing relationship with Mrs. Parker Bowles for undermining 
their marriage. An opinion poll published Saturday said that three 
quarters of the British public believe the heir to the throne would 
be a ``very good'' king (24 percent) or ``fairly good'' (50 percent). 
In the telephone poll of about 1,200 people, published in the Daily 
Telegraph, 61 percent of respondents said they consider the prince 
a ``well-intentioned but troubled man who seems to be looking for 
a role.'' Eighty-six percent said they believe he is proving to be 
a good father to his two boys, and large majorities think he has been 
a positive influence on issues ranging from the environment (86 percent) 
and youth (78 percent) to race relations (66 percent) and architecture 
(68 percent). But only 40 percent thought he should marry Mrs. Parker 
Bowles, while 46 percent were opposed.
