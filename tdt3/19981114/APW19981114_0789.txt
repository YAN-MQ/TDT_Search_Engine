The U.N. Security Council meets Saturday to consider Iraq's offer 
to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to return to Iraq, but questions 
were immediately raised on whether it was unconditional. U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan said Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz assured him 
that Iraq's decision was unconditional _ and that a controversial 
annex attached to the letter ``was for our consideration and there 
were no conditions.'' But British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in 
London that Iraq must state categorically that the nine points in 
the annex, which are also mentioned in the letter, are not conditions. 
``They cannot be conditions _ and what we all must be very sure of 
is that the Iraqi position has to be unconditional, not hedged,'' 
Blair said. ``The compliance must be immediate and it must be unconditional.'' 
Other Security Council members would not comment on the letter except 
to say it was being studied carefully. ``Let's see the letter and 
see what the council does,'' said Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the 
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is responsible for 
overseeing the destruction of Iraq's weapons programs. The two-page 
annex attached to Aziz's letter reiterated Iraq's previous terms for 
a comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N. resolutions _ several 
of which the United States had already rejected. It wasn't clear from 
the texts whether the nine points were Baghdad's hopes for a review 
_ or its conditions. ``That's the issue, and we don't have an assessment 
of that,'' said a U.S. diplomatic source, who called the letter ``very 
complicated.'' The Security Council meeting, scheduled to start at 
3:30 p.m. EST (2030 GMT), was delayed until 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) so council 
members could have more time to review the letter and the annex, said 
a U.S. official. The United States holds the council's rotating presidency 
this month. Iraq's U.N. ambassador Nizar Hamdoon delivered the letter 
to Annan at the U.N. chief's residence Saturday morning. During the 
visit, Annan spoke to Aziz on the phone and got him ``to confirm that 
their decision was unconditional'' and that U.N. weapons could resume 
their normal work ``which should mean inspections and monitoring,'' 
Annan told reporters as he left his residence. Hamdoon said afterwards 
that his government had decided ``to resume full, complete cooperation'' 
with the inspectors. Asked whether this was unconditional, he replied 
``yes.'' The letter said the inspectors would be allowed to perform 
their ``normal duties.'' And Hamdoon told reporters that the inspectors 
``will be allowed any minute they want to go back and to resume their 
normal work.'' Annan said he would present the letter, which he called 
``positive,'' at the Security Council meeting. ``They will decide 
what next to do.'' ``The indications are good but we have to wait 
for the council action,'' Annan said.
