Hong Kong Trade and Industry Secretary Chau Tak-hay said Saturday 
Pacific Rim leaders must address the issue of greater transparency 
in private-sector financial institutions, including hedge funds. Speaking 
to reporters at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in the 
Malaysian capital, Chau said he hoped the leaders of the 21-member 
trade bloc would send a ``strong message'' on the need to forge an 
international financial architecture, including greater transparency 
in the system as a whole. A draft version of the statement to be issued 
by leaders at the end of the summit reportedly calls for APEC nations 
to examine the transparency of the international financial system, 
including disclosure standards for investment banks, hedge funds and 
other institutional investors. Chau said Hong Kong called for the 
momentum of trade liberalization in the 21-member bloc to be maintained, 
and said APEC should take the lead in starting a new round of trade 
talks at the World Trade Organization. Chau said at a meeting earlier 
Saturday the ministers were unable to reach a conclusion on a pact 
that would lift trade barriers in nine key industries, known as early 
voluntary sectoral liberalization. He said those talks were adjourned 
until Sunday. Asked if he thought a deal could ultimately be reached, 
Chau replied, ``I don't know.'' APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, 
Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, 
Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, 
Taiwan, Thailand and the U.S. Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at 
this summit.
