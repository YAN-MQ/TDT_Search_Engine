A program reminder, the ongoing showdown with Iraq is the primary 
topic tomorrow on NBC's "meet the press." Senator Richard Lugar and 
former senator Sam Nunn are Tim russert's guests. He'll also talk 
to senator John Glenn about his recent mission in space. We'll have 
more on Iraq a bit later. But first, some of the day's other news, 
including unrest in Indonesia, heavy rains in Texas. And later, "in 
focus," simulating danger to prepare police who come upon the real 
thing. Because even though they're both chewable they work in totally 
different ways. Tums' calcium na turally, rapidly neutralizes acid 
so it works fast. Chewable pepcid's famotidine has to travel through 
your bloodstream so it takes 40 minutes just to start working. So 
why does tums work faster and cost less and chewable pepcid work slower 
and cost more? Good question. Tum ta tum tum tums. A ouncing an amazing 
discovery. One-A-day has combined the power of herbs with vitamins... 
to help you during the cold season. Support your mood, even memory. 
New from one-A-day. Just what you need... to feel your best. The truck 
is here. Introducing the new Silverado... it's bigger. It's more powerful. 
It's the truck from Chevrolet. Like a rock oh, like a rock.
