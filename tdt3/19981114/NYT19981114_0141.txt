Scott Muni, an FM radio pioneer who introduced New Yorkers to the 
Beatles and Led Zeppelin and went on to become a gravelly voiced rock 
legend of his own, was dismissed on Friday by WNEW, the station he 
joined 31 years ago and helped build into a music trendsetter. The 
station, which has been tinkering with its music format for several 
years in an attempt to boost its sagging ratings and market share, 
also dismissed another longtime deejay, Dave Herman, on Friday. It 
has fired three other veteran deejays of Muni's era over the last 
six months. Efforts to reach Muni, 68, by telephone were unsuccessful. 
Although Muni was still on the air until last week, as the host of 
a 10 a.m.-to-noon show featuring rock of different vintages, his days 
as a radio powerhouse, catered to by music producers and their bands, 
had long passed. Like nearly all deejays these days, who are given 
playlists that are put together by corporate researchers, he no longer 
had control over the music he played on the air. Muni, who was nicknamed 
the Professor, started out as a Top 40 disk jockey, playing the standard 
three-minute-long pop music songs of the 1950s on commercial AM stations. 
When British bands, led by the Beatles, took the United States by 
storm in the 1960s, he became a celebrity as well known as the musicians, 
and sometimes invited stars like John Lennon on his show. He once 
played poker on the air with Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead. ``Scott 
was the man,'' said Vin Scelsa, another veteran disk jockey who still 
works at WNEW and has one of the few remaining free-form radio shows 
in the New York area. ``Deejays now, with the exception of the shock 
jocks like Howard Stern, are insignificant creatures in the culture. 
Except for fringe people or dance deejays, they don't matter anymore 
in terms of the general audience. ``Scott comes from an era when deejays 
mattered _ and Scott mattered more than any of them in New York because 
he put the team together at WNEW,'' Scelsa added. Muni's most significant 
contribution to New York radio, colleagues said, came in the turbulent 
years of the late 1960s, when he provided an outlet for the protest 
songs and alternative music of the time. ``It was a pretty interesting 
year, politically and musically, and Scott caught wind of people like 
Joplin, Hendrix and Dylan _ people who were saying something interesting,'' 
said Meg Griffin, a former WNEW disk jockey who left commercial radio 
and now works at Fordham University's public radio station, WFUV. 
``He had the courage to get some of that on the air.'' In 1968, Muni 
became program manager for WNEW, which was revamping its FM format. 
Ms. Griffin said he turned WNEW into one of the country's first progressive 
radio stations, allowing deejays to play what they wanted, including 
longer album cuts, rather than the more commercial ``bubble gum music'' 
that had become common on other stations. ``It was definitely a format 
for the youth culture of the United States at the time,'' Ms. Griffin 
said. But the radio business has changed greatly since then, and many 
of Muni's contemporaries _ deejays of the 1960s rock-and-roll era 
like Dan Ingram and Bruce Morrow, known as Cousin Brucie _ do nostalgic 
``golden oldies'' shows, if they are still doing radio at all. WNEW, 
based in New York, is now struggling to find a marketable image in 
a highly competitive FM radio market. The latest Arbitron ratings 
gave it an average of about 1.5 percent of the total radio audience 
in New York City. Scott Herman, the general manager of WNEW, said 
Muni reacted to the news of his dismissal with professionalism. ``We 
need to take the station in a different direction,'' Herman said Saturday. 
``Radio is the kind of business where you have to keep moving forward.''
