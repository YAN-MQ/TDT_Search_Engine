Just about a year ago, the movie "I know what you did last summer" 
made millions by terrifying moviegoers. Now, a sequel is coming to 
theaters. Paul Vercammen has more. We last left our harrowed heroine 
of "I know what you did last summer" wrapped up in torment. We're 
all gonna die, he is gonna to kill us one by one! Now Jennifer love 
Hewitt as Julie James is back for more abuse. People do not have to 
have had seen the first one to see this one. Paradise. It's happening 
again. The sequel is "I still know what did you last summer." What 
make this one much scarier and what makes it different is this one 
is allowed to be sort of wild and violent and psychotic, because it 
all takes place in Julie's head which is no longer filled with any 
sort of reality, but just this man. So there's a man messing with 
her head and her friends and they're all on vacation. This is my first 
big movie. Brandy makes her theatrical debut. I'm so psyched and so 
crazed about it, because I thought my face is going to look so weird 
on the big screen. You know how you get the spook stories about the 
films? But no, it was great. I loved the movie. Matthew settle joins 
the cast as Freddie returns desperately wanting an umbrella. There 
was even one scene where I was supposed to be dry and I end up being 
wet, you know what I mean? So it was like, I'm soaked -- and in the 
first one, too. I'm the only guy who ends up in the sea, you know 
what I mean? Just think if your jeans were really soaked and it's 
water coming down from your hair and your face. And you have makeup 
on and your eyes start burning. It was the worst. You have to keep 
warm with tea and towels. Mekhi phifer gazes into those eyes as brandy's 
love interest. They knew what they were doing, you know, putting me 
and brandy in the film. I think it definitely widens the people that 
will come to the film and check it out. I mean, it really has a huge, 
huge, huge audience. And I think this will only enhance it. And still, 
remember, sequel freaks -- In a horror film, anything's possible. 
Anything is possible and I don't think horrors ever really end. So 
I don't know if there's going to be a third one or not. I'm not gonna 
die on this island. Do you hear me! If you want me bad, come and get 
me, I'm right here! Paul Vercammen, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
