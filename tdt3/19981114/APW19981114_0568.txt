A sore knee will keep Brazilian superstar Ronaldo out of action Sunday 
for the sixth game in nine Serie A rounds. Doctors of first-division 
Internazionale said Saturday that the young striker still is unfit 
and will miss Sunday's home match against Sampdoria of Genoa. ``We 
hope to have him back to action for the next round (against Fiorentina 
on Nov. 22),'' team doctor Piero Volpi said. ``Ronaldo will devote 
more to swimming than to soccer in the next few days, to recover his 
form.'' Suffering from World Cup stress and troubled by tendinitis 
in both knees Ronaldo has been often sidelined this season. He suffered 
the latest injury, a left knee bruise, in last Sunday's league match 
against AC Milan. Ronaldo scored Inter's opening goal in a 2-2 draw, 
before limping off the field at the end of the first half. Despite 
his intermittent appearances Ronaldo has scored three goals in as 
many league games. Inter's coach Gigi Simoni said the team must learn 
to live without Ronaldo, a key to last season's UEFA Cup title and 
second place in the Serie A. ``We have been off to an unlucky season 
start. But we must learn to live with injuries, and without Ronaldo. 
His absence must not be an alibi. We must win without him, while waiting 
for his comeback,'' the coach said.
