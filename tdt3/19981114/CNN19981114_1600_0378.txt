President Clinton is pledging more aid to help central America recover 
from hurricane Mitch. In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton said 
the United States will offer an additional $45 million in equipment 
and services. We want to do everything we can to help, now and over 
the long run. To quickly address the catastrophe, I ordered $80 million 
in emergency aid. The president says he is also considering debt relief 
for Nicaragua and honduras. Mitch killed an estimated 10,000 people 
last month.
