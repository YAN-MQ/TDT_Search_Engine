The state attorney general, Peter Verniero, urged school officials 
Saturday to start authorizing random searches of student lockers for 
drugs and weapons. Speaking before a convention of the New Jersey 
School Boards Association at a hotel here, Verniero said drug abuse 
was a ``major problem'' in the state's schools, adding that one in 
five high school students had admitted using alcohol or drugs before 
class. Verniero's office distributed a guidelines manual of more than 
300 pages earlier this year advising school officials that current 
state laws make it legal for them to authorize such searches. But 
the attorney general said Saturday that many districts had not acted 
to authorize the policy. ``Some educators, to their credit, will err 
on the side of not conducting a search out of fear of violating someone's 
rights,'' he said. ``But on the other hand if you've got reasonable 
suspicion for conducting a search, by all means you should conduct 
a search because the bottom line is we want to prevent a tragedy from 
happening in the first place.'' The School Search Policy Manual, which 
has more than 300 pages, says that students' bags and lockers may 
be searched if officials have reasonable grounds for suspecting wrongdoing, 
and that lockers may be inspected randomly if the policy is announced 
at the start of the school year. Verniero, who is chairman of a national 
task force on violence among the young, said many state attorneys 
general were seeking to copy the New Jersey manual. Several school 
officials said Saturday they had never heard of the guidelines. Diane 
Cooper, president of the East Orange Board of Education, said she 
did not know that schools could adopt random search policies, but 
that she would ask her board to consider doing so to help counter 
a drug and gang problem in the district. Last year, she said, a high 
school student was suspended for a year after teachers found a knife 
in his knapsack. ``We have been cautious in letting principals know 
that you do not infringe upon students' rights,'' she said. ``Students 
have to feel that they are protected from unauthorized or unprovoked 
harassment.'' Anne Thomas, a member of the Piscataway Board of Education, 
said her district did not have a random search policy and probably 
would not adopt one because drugs and weapons were not serious problems 
in the district. Daniel Sooy, a board member for Mainland Regional 
High School in Atlantic County, said his district did not conduct 
random searches and probably would not, but that a search of high 
school girls' lockers two years ago turned up a large quantity of 
heroin. ``We are very cautious of doing it,'' he said. ``We have to 
have some very hard evidence. I think it's going a little too far 
if you do it without just cause.'' He added, ``I am wondering if we 
are getting too tight a society _ if there are too many regulations.''
