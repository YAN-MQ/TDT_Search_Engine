Ah, the beauty of Venice on the Bay. Waters from the northern edge 
of Chesapeake Bay quietly lap upon the beach. A cool breeze blows 
in from across the water. Even today, with a slight nip in the air, 
conditions were pleasant enough for Darlene Patterson to wander down 
with her Doberman, Blue. But, hey, Darlene, don't wiggle your toes 
in the sand. Who knows what is in there. Residents of Venice on the 
Bay, a neighborhood of about 175 people, have reason to believe that 
outsiders have been sprinkling cremated human remains on their small 
beach. On three recent Saturdays, neighbors watched as people tried 
spreading what appeared to be ashes into the bay only to have swirling 
winds send them back toward children playing nearby. One time, winds 
blew the ashes toward a man who was barbecuing. On the third Saturday, 
the couple living closest to the beach, Jim and Pam Folderauer, videotaped 
a man emptying from a garbage bag what once again appeared to be ashes. 
Mrs. Folderauer approached the man and asked him what he was dumping. 
``Cremated human remains,'' he told her. ``You shouldn't be dumping 
that here,'' she said. ``Lock me up, if you want to,'' he said. ``But 
if you give me any trouble, I will agitate you at night.'' That conversation 
was recounted by B.J. Cullins, 75, a retired railroad conductor who 
is president of the Venice on the Bay Community Association. He said 
Mrs. Folderauer had grown so frightened over the incidents that she 
did not want to talk about them anymore. She refused to answer her 
door Thursday when Cullins brought along a reporter to interview her. 
``She was afraid somebody might come down on her,'' Cullins said later. 
So far, the Folderauers have not experienced any misfortunes. Nor 
has Cullins, who said he had received three threatening telephone 
calls, with a person whose voice he did not recognize telling him 
not to make trouble about the dumping. But the issue of human ashes 
fluttering in the local breezes has left many residents unsettled 
as police search for answers. ``It's a crazy world,'' said Ms. Patterson, 
45, who has family living in the area. ``Nobody's safe anymore. You've 
got to be careful everywhere you go. Even here. That's why I carry 
Mace.'' While cremation and dispersal of the ashes is an increasingly 
popular alternative to burial, funeral officials say human remains 
are more commonly spread upon cemeteries or large bodies of water 
or simply taken home in urns for safekeeping. Not that there is anything 
wrong with scattering ashes elsewhere. Jack Springer, executive director 
of the Cremation Association of North America, said states generally 
allowed unrestricted scattering on public property and scattering 
with permission on private property. But that freedom could change 
in Maryland as a result of the mystery at Venice on the Bay. With 
word of the strange dumpings spreading quickly through the community, 
the problem of what to do fell to Cullins, who has lived in the neighborhood 
for 25 years with his wife, Elsie. As association president, he notified 
the Anne Arundel County police. Mrs. Folderauer provided police with 
a license plate number, but it did not pan out as a lead. Cullins 
also contacted several state lawmakers, one of whom, Joan Cadden, 
was concerned enough to write to Martin Wasserman, Maryland's secretary 
of health and mental hygiene. She suggested that dumping human remains 
on a private beach was, first, a trespassing violation, but perhaps 
also a health issue. What if, she asked the secretary, the remains 
were of people who had undergone chemotherapy or radiation? Would 
that make their ashes toxic? Robert Venezia, environmental health 
coordinator for the state, responded to Ms. Cadden's query, assuring 
her that cremated human remains posed no health threat. But Ms. Cadden 
said the incidents at Venice on the Bay could lead to a state policy 
regulating the dispersal of human remains. She has a meeting scheduled 
for Wednesday with the Funeral Directors Commission, a state agency. 
``We're very, very sensitive to this,'' Ms. Cadden said. ``People 
have the right to do with a loved one what they want, but there have 
to be safety nets for the community.'' Cullins, meanwhile, has become 
something of a spokesman for the issue of remains dispersal. He said 
he was interviewed Thursday by an Australian television station. ``They 
have some nice beaches down there,'' he said. ``They want to make 
sure they stay that way.''
