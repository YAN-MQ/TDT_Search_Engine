The U.N. security council is scheduled to meet this afternoon to discuss 
the latest developments in the standoff with Iraq. Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein agreed today to allow U.N. weapons inspecters to resume 
work immediately T offer was at first described as unconditional. 
But sources tell CNN an aden dumb is full of conditions. President 
Clinton's national security team is meeting at the White House to 
discuss the matter. Sources say President Clinton is not at the meeting, 
but is being kept informed. Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. says appeals 
from U.N. secretary-general, kofi Annan and Boris Yeltsin changed 
the Iraqi government's mind about the inspections. I delivered a letter 
to the secretary-general in response to his appeal yesterday and to 
the appeal of Yeltsin. The Iraqi leadership has decided to resume 
full, complete cooperation with both UNSCOM and iea. Is it unconditional? 
yes. When are the inspectors going to be allowed to return? They will 
be allowed any minute they want to go back and resume their normal 
work. From now on, it's up to them to decide when to go back.
