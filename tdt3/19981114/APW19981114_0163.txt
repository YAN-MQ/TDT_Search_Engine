The Justice Ministry is investigating the possibility that millions 
of guilders (dollars) were siphoned off during the construction of 
a rail tunnel beneath Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, a newspaper reported 
Saturday. As much as 100 million guilders (dlrs 50 million) cannot 
be accounted for after the construction of the tunnel beneath the 
airport's main terminal, widely used by millions of travelers each 
year, De Telegraaf said. Investigators are examining records kept 
by the agency that oversaw construction of the 1.2 billion guilder 
(dlrs 600 million) tunnel, which was opened in 1993, the newspaper 
said. There is evidence to suggest that billing fraud may be to blame 
for the tunnel authority's failure to account for vast sums allocated 
by the government and the national railway, the report said.
