With statements by the American and Iraqi presidents offering no hint 
a U.S. military strike can be avoided, Iraq appealed to Arab nations 
on Saturday for help in case of an attack. Iraqis also took part in 
government-organized demonstrations on Saturday backing President 
Saddam Hussein. ``With our blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,'' 
chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at another protest 
Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American and Israeli flags. With 
the crisis over U.N. weapons inspectors deepening, Saddam and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton laid out familiar positions on Friday. In his 
first public statement since the latest dispute over weapons inspections, 
Saddam made it clear that nothing less than a pledge to lift U.N. 
sanctions would end the standoff. Saddam insists he was not trying 
to create a crisis with his decisions in August and last month to 
block the weapons searches. He said Iraq is open to suggestions on 
how to end the crisis. ``Iraq will accept positively any initiative 
that meets these just and balanced demands,'' he said. But Clinton 
declared the standoff would only end when Iraq resumes its cooperation 
with the U.N. Special Commission, which is charged with eliminating 
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The Security Council says the 
trade sanctions, which limit the sale of Iraqi oil, must stay until 
inspectors certify Iraq has destroyed those weapons. In Baghdad, fears 
were growing that a military strike was imminent. Hundreds of motorists 
lined up for gas and prices of some foodstuffs rose. On Saturday, 
editorials in state-run Iraqi newspapers pleaded with the Arab world 
to back Iraq. Al-Qadissiya noted that Iraq has in the past sent troops 
to aid Arab countries fighting Israel. Iraq sacrificed ``blood, money 
and everything'' in its defense of Arab causes, Al-Qadissiya argued. 
``Arab governments and peoples have to assume their role now by effectively 
backing Iraq in its confrontation against American threats.'' Most 
Arab countries _ especially Iraq's Gulf neighbors _ have called for 
a diplomatic solution, but they have also insisted Iraq cooperate 
with U.N. inspectors or suffer the consequences. The official Al-Iraq 
daily spoke of Iraq's ``helping hand'' to its Arab brothers and sought 
help to prevent the United States from destroying its industry and 
infrastructure. At Friday prayers in the nation's mosques, preachers 
issued similar pleas. ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in 
the world _ to declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif 
Humeim, sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad. 
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.'' On the 
streets Saturday, several hundred Iraqi workers marched from downtown 
Tahrir Square to the headquarters of the U.N. Development Program 
on the River Tigris, shouting ``Saddam is staying forever.'' At the 
Baath Party demonstration at the National Theater, hundreds of loyalists 
clapped whenever speakers mentioned Saddam's name. About a thousand 
young volunteers carrying Kalashnikov rifles _ part of a government 
program to defend the capital _ paraded at the National Stadium. Shoppers, 
meanwhile, appreared unafraid of a U.S. attack, perhaps reflecting 
government efforts to forge a united front against the U.N. sanctions, 
imposed eight years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading to the 
Persian Gulf War. ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said 
Naima Aidan, 40, shopping for sugar and coconuts to make sweets for 
her four children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.'' No 
information was available in Baghdad about military preparedness. 
But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a statement faxed 
to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved on highways and to oil 
fields in the north near Kirkuk. A second dissident group, the London-based 
Iraqi Broadcasting Corp., said brigades of the elite Republican Guards 
had been dispersed around Baghdad and in provinces further north. 
It said several intelligence and security departments, such as military 
intelligence and the Special Security Organization, had been ordered 
to move to the outskirts of the capital. ``All their offices are empty 
now,'' the group said in a fax sent to Cairo.
