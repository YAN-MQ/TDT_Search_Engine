The main opposition party is on the road for victory in the first 
round of Senate elections and another opposition grouping is likely 
to finish second, preliminary results showed Saturday, With all or 
nearly all results counted in 20 out of 27 districts, candidates for 
the conservative Civic Democratic Party advanced to the second round 
in 17 regions in the two days of voting. They were followed by the 
four-party center-right coalition led by the Christian Democrats and 
the Freedom Union, with 12 candidates through to the next round. The 
ruling Social democrats were third with 9 candidates, which is seen 
as a dissapointment by the party leaders. Polling stations, 5th graf
