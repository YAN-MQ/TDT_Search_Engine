Iraq will allow U.N. weapons inspectors to return to Iraq and resume 
inspections, Iraq's U.N. ambassador told Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
on Saturday. Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon met with Annan at the 
secretary-general's house in New York to deliver a letter from Iraqi 
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that could diffuse a crisis that 
appeared headed toward U.S. military action. The letter said inspectors 
from the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency are free to resume work at suspected weapons sites in Iraq. 
``They will be allowed any minute they want to go back and to resume 
their normal work,'' Hamdoon told reporters at Annan's house. The 
Security Council planned to meet later Saturday. Annan said he would 
present the letter, which he called ``positive,'' at the meeting. 
``They will decide what next to do,'' he said. The spokesman for the 
U.N. Special Commission responsible for overseeing the destruction 
of Iraq's weapons programs, Ewen Buchanan, said, ``Let's see the letter 
and see what the council does.'' Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had 
said previously that inspections could resume only after the council 
agreed to start a review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions 
that would lead to the lifting of sanctions. The Security Council 
had offered to hold a review once Iraq resumed cooperation, but refused 
to promise that it would end sanctions. The United Nations imposed 
the economic sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering 
the Gulf War. Under the cease-fire that ended the war a year later, 
sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that 
Iraq has abandoned its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs. 
Annan sent a letter to Iraqi leaders Friday urging them to resume 
cooperation before an expected U.S. military strike. Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin had sent a similar message to Saddam. ``The appeal of 
the secretary-general, which we highly trust, and the appeal also 
of the president of the Russian Federation has helped in trying to 
reach out to a situation where Iraq's point of view gets promoted,'' 
Hamdoon said Saturday. ``We think now we have had a better hearing 
for our position and that the council hopefully will be more positive 
on the question of the comprehensive review that hopefully will be 
leading to the lifting of the sanctions,'' he said. Annan's letter 
promised to look favorably on Iraq's request to review sanctions, 
Hamdoon said. ``The secretary-general was the one who raised the comprehensive 
review from the beginning and I think he still believes strongly in 
such a review,'' Hamdoon said.
