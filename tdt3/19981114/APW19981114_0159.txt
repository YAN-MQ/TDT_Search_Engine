With statements by the American and Iraqi presidents offering no hint 
a U.S. military strike can be avoided, Iraq appealed on Saturday for 
help from Arab nations should an attack be launched. Iraqis also took 
to the streets Saturday in government-organized demonstrations backing 
President Saddam Hussein. ``With our blood and souls we shall defend 
you, Saddam,'' chanted members of the ruling Baath Party, while at 
another demonstration Iraqi workers trampled on and burned American 
and Israeli flags. With the crisis over U.N. weapons inspectors deepening, 
Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton laid out familiar positions 
on Friday. In his first public statement since the latest dispute 
over U.N. weapons inspections, Saddam made it clear that nothing less 
than a pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff. Saddam 
insisted he was not trying to create a crisis with his decisions in 
August and last month to block the searches by U.N. inspectors for 
hidden weapons. Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path 
toward ending U.N. trade sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept 
positively any initiative that meets these just and balanced demands.'' 
But Clinton declared the standoff would only end when Iraq resumed 
its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, charged with eliminating 
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The Security Council says the 
trade sanctions, which limit the sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted 
until the inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed those weapons. 
In the Iraqi capital, fears were growing that a military strike was 
imminent. Motorists jammed their cars by the hundreds into gasoline 
stations, forming long lines to fill up their tanks. Shoppers found 
some prices rising in crowded markets. On Saturday, the editorials 
in state-run Iraqi newspapers pleaded with the Arab world to back 
Iraq. Al-Qadissiya pointed out that Iraq in the past sent troops to 
aid Arab countries fighting Israel and urged them to reciprocate. 
Iraq sacrificed ``blood, money and everything'' in its defense of 
Arab causes, Al-Qadissiya argued. ``Arab governments and peoples have 
to assume their role now by effectively backing Iraq in its confrontation 
against American threats.'' Most Arab countries _ especially Iraq's 
uneasy Gulf neighbors _ have called for a diplomatic solution to the 
latest crisis. But they also have insisted that Iraq resume cooperation 
with U.N. inspectors or risk the consequences. The official Al-Iraq 
daily spoke of Iraq's ``helping hand'' to its Arab brothers and sought 
help to prevent the United States from destroying its industry and 
infrastructure. At Friday prayers in the nation's mosques, preachers 
issued similar pleas to Arabs and Muslims. ``I call upon you _ all 
Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to declare war on America and its 
allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim, sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani 
Mosque in downtown Baghdad. ``Do not let their airplanes use your 
airspace or bases.'' On the streets Saturday, several hundred Iraqi 
workers marched from from downtown Tahrir Square to the headquarters 
of the U.N. Development Program on the River Tigris, shouting ``Saddam 
is staying forever.'' At the Baath Party demonstration at the National 
Theater, hundreds of loyalists broke into applause whenever speakers 
mentioned Saddam's name. About a thousand young volunteers carrying 
Kalashnikov rifles _ part of the government program to defend the 
capital _ paraded at the National Stadium. Shoppers, meanwhile, expressed 
little fear of a U.S. attack, reflecting government efforts to forge 
a united front against the U.N. sanctions, imposed eight years ago 
after Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading to the Persian Gulf War. ``If they 
want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan, 40, shopping 
for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her four children. ``I am 
not worried. God will keep us safe.'' No information was available 
in Baghdad about military preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist 
Party said in a statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been 
moved north to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major 
highways. A second dissident group, the London-based Iraqi Broadcasting 
Corp., said brigades of the elite Republican Guards had been dispersed 
around Baghdad and in provinces further north. It said several intelligence 
and security departments, such as Military Intelligence and the Special 
Security Organization, had been ordered to move to the outskirts of 
the capital. ``All their offices are empty now,'' the group said in 
a fax sent to Cairo.
