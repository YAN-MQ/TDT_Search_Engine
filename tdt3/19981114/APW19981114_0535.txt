The Iraqi government said Saturday that it will allow U.N. weapons 
inspections to resume, a move that could avert a U.S. military attack. 
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq Aziz said Iraq will allow the work of inspectors from the U.N. 
Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency to resume 
at suspected weapons sites. ``To give an additional chance to achieve 
justice by lifting the embargo ... the leadership of Iraq has decided 
to resume cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA and to allow them to 
carry out their normal missions,'' Aziz said in the letter, read over 
Iraqi television. The United Nations imposed crippling U.N. economic 
sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War. 
Under the cease-fire that ended the Gulf War a year later, sanctions 
cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has 
has been disarmed. U.N. envoy Prakash Shah said earlier in Baghdad 
that no conditions were mentioned in the letter, which was a response 
to a letter Annan sent Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Friday. Shah 
spoke to reporters minutes after conveying Aziz's letter to Annan. 
He said all Security Council members would receive copies. The Security 
Council was scheduled to meet later Saturday. ``They will have this 
letter before them,'' Annan said in New York. ``They will decide what 
next to do.'' Asked whether the inspectors would return to Iraq, he 
replied: ``Once the issue is resolved, that's what I think should 
happen.'' Iraqi U.N. ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said the inspectors 
could return immediately. ``They will be allowed any minute they want 
to to go back and to resume their normal work,'' he said in New York. 
``From now on it's up to them to decide when to go back.'' Iraqi officials 
credited Russian and Chinese diplomacy for their decision. The United 
States had beefed up its military presence in the Gulf in preparation 
for an attack to force Iraq's compliance. But Aziz's letter to Annan 
said that was not a factor. ``We give this opportunity, not for fear 
of the aggressive American campaign and the threats of launching a 
new aggression on Iraq, but to show responsibility and as a response 
to your call and the call of friends,'' Aziz said. Hamdoon said Annan's 
letter appealed to Iraq to resume its cooperation ``with a promise 
that Iraq's case would be looked on favorably and the comprehensive 
review would be taking place in the right time.'' Iraq had demanded 
that the Security Council, in offering a comprehensive review of the 
U.N. arms inspections, specifically say that the review was designed 
to end the sanctions, which ban Iraq's free export of oil and have 
devastated the economy. A promise from Annan is less than a Security 
Council pledge, but it offered Iraq a way out as an American attack 
on the country appeared more and more likely. The news of the breakthrough 
came after statements Friday by both Saddam and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton appeared to offer little room for maneuver. Iraqi newspapers 
appealed for Arab help Saturday in case of attack, and Iraqis took 
to the streets in government-organized demonstrations. ``With our 
blood and souls we shall defend you, Saddam,'' chanted members of 
the ruling Baath Party, while at another demonstration Iraqi workers 
trampled on and burned American and Israeli flags. In his statement 
Friday, Saddam made it clear that nothing less than a pledge to lift 
U.N. sanctions would end the standoff. Saddam insisted that he was 
not trying to create a crisis with his decisions in August and last 
month to block the searches by U.N. inspectors for hidden weapons. 
Referring to Iraq's insistence that it see a path toward ending U.N. 
trade sanctions, Saddam declared: ``Iraq will accept positively any 
initiative that meets these just and balanced demands.'' But Clinton 
said the standoff would only end when Iraq resumed its cooperation.
