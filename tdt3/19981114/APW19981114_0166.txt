Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Saturday that the world cannot afford 
to ignore the threat of Iraqi chemical and biological weapons, but 
said he hoped for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. ``I think it's 
a bit rich of Saddam Hussein to say he will respond to any initiative, 
when all week he has been refusing to respond to the many initiatives 
that have been made,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio 
interview. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday urged Saddam 
to make ``a wise decision'' and resume cooperation with weapons inspectors. 
Annan earlier met at U.N. headquarters with ambassadors of Russia, 
France and China who appealed to him to intervene to find a diplomatic 
solution and avert U.S. air strikes. Despite the apparent split in 
the security council about possible military action, Cook said the 
council was united in regarding Iraq as violating its agreement on 
weapons inspection. Cook said he would prefer Saddam cooperate with 
the UN inspectors. ``But if he won't do that, then he will be disarmed 
through military action. We cannot leave him with those weapons,'' 
Cook said. ``If one of the consequences of any military action was 
for Saddam to be toppled, that would be a bonus, a very welcome bonus, 
but that is not the objective of any military action,'' he added.
