Wanda, you're bringing in Elliot, the consultant? I just thought that-- 
how are we going to work with this guy? - He's a thousand miles away! 
- And I'm sure that-- he doesn't think the way we think. Well, I think 
that that's the point. Uh-oh, wanda's team is upset. They have to 
share everything they know with someone they don't. What kind of conversation 
are we going to have with Elliot? He doesn't even use the same systems 
we use. Relax, wanda. Remember, you've got Xerox docushare. The software 
that works on any system. Huh, you're right. Of course we're right! 
No, I mean, I know exactly how to get you guys... and Elliot on the 
same page. But that'll never happen. Sure it will. With docushare, 
you all can work on the same digital documents on the same webpage. 
We don't have time to train this guy. - What training? - It's intuitive. 
Anyone can use a web browser. see? You share documents with Elliot. 
Elliot shares with you. - Why do we have to share anything with Elliot? 
- Because... - he's got the knowledge. - Tell them he's writing a 
book. Because I said so! That's a good answer too. : bob! Get to Baltimore!
