Jonathan Taylor Thomas isn't getting married soon. But the young star 
of "home improvement" has reached some other milestones in life, not 
the least of which is finishing a movie. Sherri Sylvester reports. 
Getting "I'll be home for Christmas" into theaters for the holidays 
took shooting in the summer. Jonathan Taylor Thomas was available. 
Snow was not. We traveled to Canada in order to get snow, but because 
of El Nino, which everything -- El Nino affects everything, there 
wasn't a lot of snow up there, so we ended up making it. We have this 
race, this Santa 5k, where we have 150 santas out there, some big 
guys dressed in Santa suits. And it's 90-degree weather. So it really 
is bizarre to see this whole Christmas layout. Marker. I'm going to 
see a man about a Porsche. His character is a spoiled rich kid whose 
father offers him a Vintage sports car to come home for Christmas. 
A practical joke leaves him stranded in the desert. Only by hitchhiking 
cross-country does he learn the true spirit of the season. I just 
thought we could have some fun this Christmas. When we caught up with 
the actor on a warm, sunny California day, his mind was on college, 
not Christmas. He has since set aside his "home improvement" role 
to focus on his education. I'm looking at top universities in the 
country. I still maybe want to go to an Ivy league school or northwestern 
or something that I'm going to have fun and really enjoy. But even 
if I have to take a couple of years off from this, I'm definitely 
going to go to college. When did you become 16 already? He is expected 
to make occasional appearances on the sitcom. Meanwhile, there is 
a stunt on his film set that he could not have done before his 16th 
birthday. Driving, driving, maybe looking this way, driving. I did 
get my license. I got my license the day of my birthday. And I was 
at the dmv that morning, I was there at 6:30 waiting in line, because 
I didn't have an appointment. I had an appointment for two days later, 
but I didn't want to wait. No more speeding. Okay, Santa? 65, stay 
alive. I got a truck, a big SUV and -- holds seven people. And I can 
fit my ski equipment and my camping gear in there. And I put 18,000 
miles on my car. That's in ten months. So he'll be home for Christmas. 
At his age, half the fun is getting there. Ho, ho, ho, merry Christmas.
