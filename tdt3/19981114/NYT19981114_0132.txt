When the ABC sports reporter Lesley Visser was informed last April 
that she would become the new sideline reporter on ``Monday Night 
Football'' and thus the first female member of the broadcast team, 
she knew it was the opportunity of a lifetime. After covering the 
National Football League and special assignments for CBS Sports from 
1988 to 1994, she joined ABC Sports in 1994, serving as a reporter 
on ESPN's ``GameDay'' and as the leading correspondent for ABC's ``Wide 
World of Sports.'' Visser soon discovered that more than a little 
fitness and stamina are required for her new position. ``It's both 
exciting and physically exhausting because I am constantly moving 
for three and a half hours,'' said Visser, who supplements the play-by-play 
team of Al Michaels, Dan Dierdorf and Boomer Esiason. ``I compare 
myself to being a duck on the pond because you have to be placid on 
the surface, and yet I'm constantly moving my legs to keep afloat 
of what's going on in the game.'' Faced with the responsibility of 
gathering and disseminating news from the sideline in less than a 
minute of air time, Visser's task is to present the information in 
a tone appropriate to the particular story. When Tampa Bay wide receiver 
Brice Hunter seriously injured his neck Sept. 28 against Detroit, 
Visser's frequent updates on Hunter's condition conveyed the seriousness 
of the situation. ``Lesley is a terrific reporter and makes our telecast 
better because she works so hard,'' said Steve Anderson, the senior 
vice president for production for ABC Sports. ``She has excellent 
credibility, and the players and coaches respect her. Having Lesley 
on the sideline is a great luxury for us.'' Currently in its 29th 
season on ABC, ``Monday Night Football'' was able to carve out its 
own niche from the beginning. Visser credits its immediate impact 
on viewers to the foresight three decades ago of Pete Rozelle, then 
the commissioner of the NFL, and Roone Arledge, then the president 
of ABC. ``They both had a vision of what the show could become,'' 
Visser said. ``At the time, ABC was the No. 3 network _ behind NBC 
and CBS _ so they didn't have anything to lose in the ratings. Sophisticated 
technology was implemented, and Arledge knew it would be good theater.'' 
Visser, with her husband Dick Stockton, a broadcast journalist for 
Fox and TNT, has been covering athletes since 1974, when she joined 
the Boston Globe sports staff on a grant from the Carnegie Foundation. 
She stayed with the Globe for 14 years before taking a full-time job 
with CBS. So Visser understands why athletes shy away from the spotlight; 
she notes that even now, Esiason cannot walk through a hotel lobby 
without being bombarded by hundreds of fans. But, she said, ``I think 
that all athletes have an obligation to be gracious to the fans while 
they are in public.'' Visser's on-the-field obligations are formulaic, 
if frenzied. Under normal circumstances, as the game winds down, Visser 
and the production crew have a set formula for the post-game interview. 
``At the two-minute mark, the producer will ask me what interview 
I want to do at the end of the game,'' Visser said. ``Usually it is 
pretty obvious. We have to be respectful that the player is going 
to want to say hi to his friends on the opposing team, but there isn't 
much time, so I have to follow the player and grab him almost immediately.'' 
Almost as difficult as plucking the player away from friends and fans 
is coming up with questions that will avoid one-word answers. One 
of the best _ and certainly the easiest _ parts of the job, Visser 
said, is listening to Michaels, Dierdorf and Esiason in the booth 
because they are all passionately opinionated. Watching players who 
love to play the game, like Brett Favre or Barry Sanders, is what 
Visser enjoys most about her work. The compelling aspects of the game 
fascinate her, not knowing what to expect from each play. ``I always 
want to be at the site of the competition,'' Visser said. ``I don't 
want to be in the studio and miss the action. When people ask me what 
my favorite place in America is, my answer is Green Bay in January.''
