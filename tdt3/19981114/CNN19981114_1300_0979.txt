Recently, the Supreme Court refused to take up the issue of the Wisconsin 
school voucher program. It allows the use of vouchers to send children 
to private schools, even ones with a religious orientation. Aram Roston 
looks at the controversy. These 11th graders at St. Pius X pray at 
the beginning of their church history class. That couldn't happen 
at a public school, where classroom prayers are unconstitutional. 
Tuition here is almost $6,000 a year. Still, there is a waiting list. 
There is no voucher system in the state of Georgia. The principal 
wishes there was. Families that we would like to have within our school 
community are often priced out. They simply cannot have access to 
the education we offer at our school. At the greater Atlanta Christian 
school, the president says he's only in favor of vouchers that come 
with no strings attached. If they include federal, state or local 
control, or our curriculum, programs, religion, or other things, then 
the private school system will quickly lose the very advantage they've 
had. The debate is not centered only on religion though. It is about 
the future of public schools in America. Critics say school vouchers 
will strip public schools of needed funds and turn education into 
a business. Their agenda is to take money from our kids and put it 
into their corporate pockets. Proponents say it will make public schools 
more efficient. They need to be able to compete with private schools, 
or they need to get out of the way. And that's what vouchers are really 
saying to the country. But the bottom line, critics say, is vouchers 
aren't really about choice. Because private institutions can pick 
and choose their students, public schools have to teach them all.
