Russia's atomic energy minister will travel to Iran soon to check 
on plans for a nuclear power plant to be built there with Russian 
parts, a news report said Saturday. Minister Yevgeny Adamov will travel 
to Bushehr, where Russian specialists are to install a VVER-1000 light 
water reactor in a dlrs 800 million contract, he told the Interfax 
news agency. The United States fears the project will help Iran advance 
its suspected nuclear weapons program, and has expressed disapproval. 
But Russia, desperate for hard cash, says the reactor can be used 
only for civilian purposes and is anxious to press ahead. Adamov also 
said the Russian government will guarantee to go ahead with constructing 
a similar nuclear power plant in China despite the financial crisis 
that hit the Russian government in August. Chinese leaders earlier 
voiced concern that the two-reactor project, which would garner Russia 
dlrs 2.5 billion, would collapse because of the Russian economic crisis. 
Russia continues to rile western governments by signing deals with 
volatile countries for sales of arms and nuclear technology. It has 
also signed a contract for a nuclear plant in India.
