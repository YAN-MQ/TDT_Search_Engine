Jordan's king Hussein is celebrating his 63rd birthday today. It's 
an especially happy occasion, considering Hussein says he is cured 
of lymph gland cancer. In Jordan, news of the king's improving health 
gave a boost to birthday celebrations. King Hussein is in the United 
States, undergoing treatment at the mayo clinic. He says his chemotherapy 
is over, and there is no trace of the lymphoma.
