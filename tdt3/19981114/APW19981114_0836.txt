GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) - World champion Alexei Yagudin beat teammate 
Alexander Abt in a battle of quads to take the men's event at the 
Nations Cup Saturday with Russians on the verge of a sweep of all 
the events. In the ice dance, two more world champions, Angelika Krylova 
and Oleg Ovsiannikov, used a controversial routine entirely to drums 
and percussion instruments to win. Earlier Saturday Maria Petrova 
and Alexei Tikhonov won the pairs event over a weak field, the first 
of three finals during the day. Russians are 1-2 after the women's 
short program with Yelena Sokolova ahead of European champion Maria 
Butyrskaya. The long program is Sunday. World champion Yagudin landed 
six triples and a quadruple toe loop to score all 5.8s and 5.9s in 
another impressive routine to the music from ``Lawrence of Arabia.'' 
At his Skate America victory two weeks ago he landed nine triples, 
one more than allowed. Abt started with a triple axel-triple loop 
then tried his quad, slightly two-footing it. He scaled down one triple 
and turned out of his second triple axel which hurt his chances. He 
also had Arabian music and an Arabian costume with billowing pants. 
Third was Andreas Vlascenko of Germany. Krylova and Ovsiannikov performed 
a very untraditional dance program with no music, just different rhythms 
of drums. Although the steps were quick and the positions sometimes 
unique, it is sure to provoke controversy. ``I think this programs 
has a lot of risks. Before we were very dramatic, like with `Carmen,'' 
Krylova said. ``But we are world champions and I think we can take 
risks and try something new.'' However the judges scored only moderate 
marks for a world champions of mostly 5.6 and 5.7 with only one 5.8 
for technical merit. The presentaion marks were mostly 5.8s and 5.9s. 
Bourne and Kraatz showed more dance movements to the driving beat 
of techo-rock beat. ``It's quite a work-out from beginning to end,'' 
Bourne said. ``It's 90s music, music of today.'' But she agreed with 
Krylova that change is needed in the sport. ``The main objective of 
a dancer is to be versatile and show something different every year,'' 
Bourne said. ``And I think that's why all of us are doing something 
different.'' Petrova and Tikhonov outclassed the other five pairs 
in their event although they have been skating together for less than 
six months. Tikhonov skated in shows for nearly four years but did 
not give up his eligible status. ``I think professional shows helped 
me,'' Tikhonov said. ``But all this time I missed competing.'' German 
veterans Peggy Schwarz and Mirko Mueller were second. Third went to 
the American team of John and Tiffany Stiegler, trained by Russian 
pair legend Irina Rodnina. Sokolova took the women's short program 
as Butyskaya fell and barely held another jump. Butyrskaya won Skate 
American two weeks ago and was expected to take advantage of the absence 
of Olympic champion Tara Lipinksi and world champion Michelle Kwan 
this season. The 18-year-old Sokolova nailed her triple lutz-double 
toe loop combination and triple loop jumps. The only error was when 
she stumbled at the end of her footwork and went into the boards. 
``After the three succsssful jumps, I had mentally finished the program. 
I just lost my concentration and suddenly my legs went out under me,'' 
Sokolova said.
