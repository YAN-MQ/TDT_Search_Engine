F. Scott Fitzgerald, the patron saint of rich, bored Jazz Age cosmopolites, 
looked back wistfully to the years before World War I, when, he said, 
Americans had not yet been ``corrupted by advertising.'' One can only 
wonder what he would say now, when the messages from Madison Avenue 
suddenly seem larded with cynicism. Liquor ads promote ``responsible 
drinking'' (a term that may goad the irresponsible into ordering a 
double, straight up). Cigarette makers print the Surgeon General's 
mandatory warning on every pack, and offer, on company-run Web sites, 
advice on quitting. Health clubs run ads warning customers not to 
let diet-and-exercise regimes give way to anorexia or bulimia. Are 
these ads meant to drive away potential customers? Of course not; 
ad agencies just want to talk the jaded, skeptical talk of the '90s. 
``Consumers are cynical and literate,'' said Richard Kirshenbaum, 
a New York advertising-agency executive who, with his partner, Jonathan 
Bond, wrote a book titled ``Under the Radar: Talking to Today's Cynical 
Consumer'' (Wiley, 1997). ``Ten years ago, consumers would respond 
to the ad,'' Kirshenbaum added. ``Today, they're talking about the 
strategy behind the ad. Everyone has a marketing degree and is a critical 
consumer.'' Madison Avenue has certainly ratcheted up the cynicism, 
which means that more ads than ever rely on irony and a particular 
kind of edgy, self-deprecating humor. The struggling UPN television 
network tried to promote its sitcom, ``The Secret Diary of Desmond 
Pfeiffer,'' with the slogan, ``The critics hate it, you'll love it.'' 
(The show has already been canceled.) Last season ABC introduced a 
high-concept ad campaign with the smarty-pants slogan ``TV is good.'' 
This season the bright yellow ads carry the slightly milder slogan, 
``We love TV.'' But the anti-authority tone is the same: ``If TV is 
bad for you,'' one ad asks, ``how come every hospital room has one?'' 
And Beck's beer is poking fun at its Teutonic origins. ``Germans don't 
do laid back,'' the announcer says after a guy in a suit and tie misses 
the point of a relaxation tape. ``They do beer.'' Kirshenbaum worries 
that all this tone is old news by now. He says he first used it 10 
years ago for Kenneth Cole, a New York shoe designer. The ad said: 
``Imelda Marcos bought 2,700 pairs of shoes. She could have at least 
had the courtesy to buy a pair of ours.'' ``Acknowledging that someone 
bought a huge amount of shoes, but not yours, that's the core of how 
cynical people need or want to be spoken to,'' he said. But there 
is a but, and it is nothing less than a nightmare for Madison Avenue. 
``Now that mainstream advertisers are adopting this stance, consumers 
will tune this out,'' Kirshenbaum said. Madison Avenue is scrambling 
to find new ways to get past them. ``One way of distinguishing yourself 
is to take a shot at yourself,'' said Todd Gitlin, a professor of 
media studies at New York University. ``In the process you're recognizing 
that people are flooded with claims which are largely absurd or only 
metaphorically interesting. By incorporating the skepticism into your 
ad, you are inviting the consumer into a sort of collusion, saying 
you and I both know that advertising is a crock, but we're taking 
you seriously as one who's not a dummy. We're not dummies either, 
we're all non-dummies together, and aren't we a swell bunch of folks 
to hang out with?'' Kirshenbaum makes much the same point _ in a strikingly 
different way. ``Having an interesting and relevant corporate posture 
is what's appealing to consumers today,'' he said, adding that his 
agency now spends time working up corporate strategy. ``It's not just 
about an ad anymore. It's about the message behind the company, the 
brand and the ad.'' Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media ecology 
at NYU, sees this tack as the latest refinement of a time-honored 
public relations technique. ``If they really cared, they wouldn't 
run smoking ads in the first place,'' he said. ``They'd get out of 
that business.'' But he argues that cynicism allows companies to have 
it both ways. ``The tobacco companies, for example, can do a certain 
amount of repair work on their hideous image by seeming to offer responsible 
advice about smoking,'' Miller said. ``The same is the case with the 
liquor industry. But obviously, these new ads will not do their old 
ads any harm. They're not ever as punchy as the standard ads, nor 
could they be, because self-indulgence is always more tempting than 
self-restraint.''
