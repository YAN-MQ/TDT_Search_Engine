With Catfish Hunter, it was always what he did with his arms and hands. 
He gripped a baseball with his right hand and threw it with his right 
arm. Threw it for 224 victories before he stopped pitching at the 
relatively early age of 33, threw it for five World Series championship 
teams, threw it for 328 innings in 1975 after he joined the Yankees 
as a $3.35 million free agent. ``Something got tight in my arm,'' 
he once said about pitching all those innings, ``and I never got it 
right again until the doctor manipulated it in 1978.'' When he returned 
to his farm in Hertford, N.C., after the 1979 season, he depended 
on his arms and hands. He worked his peanut, corn and soybean fields 
with his arms and hands, when he wasn't hunting with a rifle in his 
arms and hands or fishing with a rod in them. In 1987, he held his 
bronze Baseball Hall of Fame plaque with his arms and hands. But now 
it's what he is unable to do with his arms and hands. ``I've got no 
strength in my arms and my hands,'' he said recently in describing 
his ailment, now diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou 
Gehrig's disease. ``I can't do the routine things like button a shirt 
anymore.'' James Augustus ``Catfish'' Hunter wasn't complaining, just 
explaining. He hasn't changed. In 1977 he had a 9-9 record, but Billy 
Martin, then the Yankee manager, started him in the second game of 
the World Series. The Dodgers shelled him, but he never used his damaged 
arm as an alibi. ``I knew he wasn't right,'' Martin said later. ``I 
also knew he wouldn't complain if he was hit hard. And by using him, 
it set up our rotation for that Series.'' Hunter's right arm had not 
been sound since that 1975 season when he was 23-14 with 30 complete 
games. To appreciate those 30 complete games, consider that during 
the recent season the Atlanta Braves' staff led the major leagues 
with only 24 complete games. All those complete games took their toll. 
Hunter skidded to 17-15 in 1976, dropped to 9-9 in 1977, then jumped 
to 12-6 in a brief comeback in 1978 before concluding his career with 
a 2-9 record in 1979. But he never used his arm problems as a cop-out. 
``You can't alibi when you get hit,'' he once said. ``You're the one 
who throws the ball. You can't blame anybody else.'' Some pitchers 
do. Some pitchers will say that the catcher called for the pitch, 
that it was the catcher's fault. ``No, you're the one with the ball,'' 
Hunter said. ``You can shake the catcher off if you think it's a bad 
call.'' To appreciate how good Hunter was at his best, consider that 
he was only the fourth pitcher in this century to win 200 games before 
his 31st birthday; the others were the legendary triumvirate of Cy 
Young, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson. And Hunter was only the 
third American League pitcher to win 20 games five consecutive seasons; 
the others were Johnson and Lefty Grove. Of those five seasons, the 
first four were with the Oakland A's that won the World Series in 
1972, 1973 and 1974. ``When we started winning in Oakland,'' Reggie 
Jackson has said, ``Cat was the father of those teams.'' Hunter also 
was a father figure when the Yankees won the 1977 and 1978 Series. 
In his quiet humor, he could talk about Mr. October in a way that 
the slugger's ego would accept. Such as on opening day in 1978, when 
Jackson hit a homer and the Stadium fans tossed hundreds of the new 
Reggie candy bars on the field. ``When you unwrap one,'' Hunter said 
with a grin, ``it tells you how good it is.'' More than any other 
Yankee teammate, Lou Piniella enjoyed jousting with Hunter. ``Hey, 
Longball,'' Piniella once said, alluding to Hunter's tendency to allow 
home runs, ``you've got me going back to the wall so much, I'm going 
to have to put a mattress on my back.'' ``You've got 150 hits,'' Hunter 
replied, ``and only 5 home runs.'' ``That,'' Piniella said, ``is only 
because I can't hit against you.'' In their clubhouse camaraderie, 
Hunter laughed as hard as anyone. ``Both of us can take it,'' he said. 
``I can take the joking and get on people. So can Lou, but some people 
can't take it. They can give it, but they can't take it.'' Catfish 
Hunter could always take it, a strength that must be serving him well 
now.
