Iraq's government is expected to respond positively to pleas from 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to resume dealings with United Nations 
arms inspectors, a senior Iraqi official said Saturday. Such a step 
could defuse the crisis over arms inspections that has led to threatened 
American attacks on Iraq and a buildup of U.S. military forces in 
the Gulf. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told 
reporters he ``had information'' that the Iraqi leadership would reply 
favorably to a letter sent by Annan to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
The official said Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who recently met 
with Annan in New York, would be calling the secretary-general with

Nizar Hamdoon, said Friday that Annan was sending a letter to Saddam. 
He said he didn't know the contents, but Western diplomats said it 
would repeat Annan's urgent appeal Wednesday to resume cooperation 
with the inspectors immediately. The Iraqi official, from the Culture 
and Information Ministry, also did not reveal the letter's contents.

for the lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq if the weapons inspectors 
were allowed to go back to work. Iraq had demanded that the U.N. Security 
Council, in offering a comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, 
specifically say that review was designed to end the sanctions, which 
ban Iraq's free export of oil and have devastated the country's economy. 
Such a promise from Annan would be less than a Security Council pledge, 
but it could offer Iraq a way out of the current crisis as an American 
attack on the country is appearing more and more likely. The news 
of a possible breakthrough in the dispute came after statements Friday 
by both Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared to offer little 
way out of the crisis. On Saturday, 10th graf
