William Curry Moloney, who studied and treated blood diseases well 
before hematology became a medical specialty, died on Nov. 3 in Boston 
at Brigham and Women's Hospital, where he had once been a director 
of hematology. He was 91 and lived in Chatham, Mass. Moloney was one 
of the first to use chemotherapy for treating leukemia and lymphoma. 
He was an early contributor to the development of specific diagnostic 
tests, some of which remain in use today. Born in Boston, he worked 
his way through Tufts College and Tufts Medical School and started 
his career as a family doctor in Jamaica Plain, Mass. Such conditions 
as anemia, bleeding problems and leukemia soon absorbed him. He began 
to carry along what he called his ``lab equipment'' in his black bag 
and became known as a leading blood consultant in and around Boston. 
Driving his old blue Dodge, he administered Rh tests and did bone-marrow 
examinations at many New England hospitals using materials he kept 
in a cigar box secured with an elastic band. He also established much-needed 
blood banks throughout the region. He was a recognized authority on 
safe procedures for blood transfusions, and his expertise in blood 
banks stood him in good stead in World War II, when he oversaw transfusions 
to wounded soldiers. After the war, in the early 1950s, he directed 
research for the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in Hiroshima, Japan, 
and later in the Marshall Islands he studied the effects of errant 
radiation and the mechanisms that produce leukemia. Moloney joined 
the faculty of Tufts Medical School in 1934 and rose to clinical professor. 
He moved to Harvard Medical School with the same rank in 1971 and 
reached emeritus status there in 1974. He was named chief of hematology 
at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, now Brigham and Women's, in 1966 and 
continued his bone-marrow and leukemia research there until 1997. 
Moloney is survived by two sons, Thomas of Chatham, and William of 
New Bedford, Mass.; a daughter, Patricia McGrath of Keene, N.H.; 24 
grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
