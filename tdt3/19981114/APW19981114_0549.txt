The Iraqi government said Saturday that it will allow U.N. weapons 
inspections to resume, a move that could avert a U.S. military attack. 
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq Aziz said Iraq will allow the work of inspectors from the U.N. 
Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency to resume 
at suspected weapons sites. ``To give an additional chance to achieve 
justice by lifting the embargo ... the leadership of Iraq has decided 
to resume cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA and to allow them to 
carry out their normal missions,'' Aziz said in the letter, read over 
Iraqi television. The United Nations imposed crippling U.N. economic 
sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War. 
Under the cease-fire that ended the Gulf War a year later, sanctions 
cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has 
has been disarmed. U.N. envoy Prakash Shah said earlier in Baghdad 
that no conditions were mentioned in the letter, which was a response 
to a letter Annan sent Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Friday. Shah 
spoke to reporters minutes after conveying Aziz's letter to Annan. 
He said all Security Council members would receive copies. The Security 
Council was scheduled to meet later Saturday. ``They will have this 
letter before them,'' Annan said in New York. ``They will decide what 
next to do.'' Asked whether the inspectors would return to Iraq, he 
replied: ``Once the issue is resolved, that's what I think should 
happen.'' Iraqi U.N. ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said the inspectors 
could return immediately. ``They will be allowed any minute they want 
to to go back and to resume their normal work,'' he said in New York. 
``From now on it's up to them to decide when to go back.'' Iraqi officials 
credited Russian and Chinese diplomacy for their decision. U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's national security team, meanwhile, met to assess the 
Iraqi promise.
