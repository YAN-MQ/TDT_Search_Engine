Politically influenced and incompetent police continue violating human 
rights across Bosnia, despite a general improvement of the rights 
situation, two influential watchdog agencies said Saturday. One of 
the groups _ Human Rights Watch _ also faulted lack of international 
pressure and unclear mandates of the NATO-led peace force and U.N. 
police monitors, saying they permit top war crimes suspects to remain 
at large and impede refugee returns. Human Rights Watch and the Helsinki 
Committee for Human Rights spent past two weeks traveling across Bosnia 
assess the situation since the Dayton peace accord stopped the war 
in 1995. Holly Cartner, head of Human Rights watch said human rights 
in the both the Serb and Croat-Muslim halves of the country have improved 
some, particularly regarding freedom of movement and work of new, 
joint institutions. The arrests of several persons indicted for war 
crimes by the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal, were also positive, Cartner 
said. ``However, Human Rights Watch remains deeply concerned about 
human rights violations in a number of areas,'' she told reporters. 
Cartner and other human rights officials listed numerous cases where 
local justice systems failed to apprehend of prosecute those suspected 
of committing hate crimes and singled out police in some instances. 
``Not only do police frequently fail to investigate ethnically motivated 
crimes, but there are far too many cases ... where police have themselves 
participated in criminal acts against minorities or have stood by 
passively while others carried out such acts,'' Cartner said. At least 
20 war crimes suspects remain at large in Bosnia, including the wartime 
Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, and his military commander 
Gen. Ratko Mladic. ``And there appears to be little international 
pressure to arrest them,'' she said. ``The failure to arrest the most 
prominent indictees has made it impossible to implement key provisions 
of the Dayton peace agreement and promises to compromise the large 
(refugee) return program.'' In addition, Cartner said the NATO-led 
peacekeepers and U.N. police monitors ``need to clarify their mandates 
and focus more attention on the prevention of violence against returnees.''
