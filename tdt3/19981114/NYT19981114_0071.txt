One of the reasons that movie studios make so many action pictures 
is that they do well overseas. There are no translation problems when 
Bruce Willis is firing an Uzi or fleeing a fireball. Comedies and 
dramas are a different story. Comedy, in particular, frequently hangs 
on the thinnest of cultural threads. But when a comic film takes off, 
the distributors will do everything possible to push it overseas. 
Take, for instance, ``There's Something About Mary,'' one of the biggest 
and silliest movies of the year, starring Cameron Diaz. To foreign 
audiences, the title was mystifying. So 20th Century Fox renamed the 
movie country by country. In Poland, blonde jokes are popular, so 
the title became, ``For the Love of a Blonde.'' In France, it was, 
``Mary at All Costs.'' Scott Neeson, the executive in charge of foreign 
distribution at Fox, said Asians prefer literal titles. So in Thailand 
it became, ``My True Love Will Stand All Outrageous Events.'' In Hong 
Kong it was called, ``Enjoy Yourself in the Game of Love.'' That's 
poetic by the standards of Hong Kong, where the demand for literal 
descriptions has produced some jarring results. The Cantonese title 
for ``Leaving Las Vegas'' translates to ``I'm Drunk and You're a Prostitute.'' 
``Field of Dreams'' was ``Imaginary Dead Baseball Players Live in 
My Cornfield.'' For truth in advertising, you could not beat the title 
for ``The Crying Game'' _ ``Oh No! My Girlfriend Has a Penis!'' Occasionally, 
the Chinese seem to find unintended meanings in American movies. ``Interview 
With the Vampire,'' for instance, became, ``So, You Are a Lawyer.'' 
But there's no arguing with the Chinese take on ``Babe'': ``The Happy 
Dumpling-To-Be Who Talks and Solves Agricultural Problems.'' Or ``My 
Best Friend's Wedding'': ``Help! My Pretend Boyfriend Is Gay.'' Or 
``George of the Jungle'': ``Big Dumb Monkey Man Keeps Whacking Tree 
With Genitals.'' Or even ``Batman and Robin'': ``Come to My Cave and 
Wear this Rubber Codpiece, Cute Boy.'' But still, there is that poetic 
side, as with the Pamela Anderson Lee vehicle called ``Barb Wire.'' 
The Chinese saw it as ``Delicate Orbs of Womanhood Bigger Than Your 
Head Can Hurt You.''
