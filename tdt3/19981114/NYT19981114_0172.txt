In bemused tones, the Oct. 19 internal memo from the chairman of the 
Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy residential brokerage to his company's 
110 sales agents said: ``We actually have sellers out there deciding 
whether to accept offers and buyers deciding whether they should make 
an offer based on what the Dow is doing that morning or afternoon.'' 
Back then, a whole month ago in the day-to-day slalom ride of the 
financial markets, there were reports of luxury-apartment buyers walking 
away from million-dollar deposits, of jittery sellers _ visions of 
precipitous decline dancing in their heads _ lopping off 20 percent 
or more of their asking prices. ``We feel this is silly,'' the brokerage 
chairman, David Michonski, wrote in his memo. And many observers and 
players in the New York regional residential market would concur, 
especially with the Dow having recovered substantially from its 513-point 
Aug. 31 plunge. To be sure, the stock-market gyrations and the profound 
problems plaguing some foreign economies have dampened the heat of 
a feverish residential market and muffled the drums of bidding wars. 
But those dampening developments appear to be limited _ at least for 
now _ to the high end of the Manhattan market, to the new residential 
buildings of the downtown financial district and to the most affluent 
enclaves of New York City's suburban ring. In the broader residential 
market, both national and regional, where the fundamentals buttressing 
home buying _ high employment, low inflation and low mortgage rates 
_ remain firm, middle-class and working-class buyers continue to keep 
the real-estate business percolating. ``When the stock market starts 
to bump,'' said Edward Lee Cave, chairman of the high-end Manhattan 
brokerage that bears his name, ``the very rich feel less rich. Their 
Wall Street shares have appreciated about 80 percent over the last 
four or five years. They've now gone down 20 to 30 percent. So instead 
of saying they are 50 percent richer than they were before, they are 
saying they are 30 percent poorer. That's human nature.'' And so, 
what the luxury market has seen in the last few months, said Clark 
Halstead, founder of Halstead Property Co., ``has been an emotional 
reaction to the world economic crisis, rather than a real economic 
phenomenon.'' As one high-end New Jersey broker, Michele Kolsky-Assatly 
of Coldwell Banker's Fort Lee office, said, ``There is a reserved 
nervousness in the market.'' And she told of a Fort Lee home that 
had been on the market for 235 days while the owner held out for a 
bid of $1.25 million, then, in August, accepted an offer of $1.14 
million. But in the more down-to-earth Bronx, one leading brokerage, 
ERA Besmatch, is reporting the sale of 450 properties so far this 
year, compared with less than 400 by this time in 1997, and a demand 
that increased the average price for the homes it handles in neighborhoods 
like Wakefield, Williamsbridge and Pelham from $161,000 a year ago 
to $166,000. In Queens, Judy Young, manager of Market Place Realty, 
complained, ``I have customers, but nothing to show them,'' pointing 
out that a house in Flushing, listed one day two weeks ago at $270,000, 
had sold the following day for $279,000. The Westchester-Putnam Multiple 
Listing Service recorded more sales in the third quarter of this year 
than in any previous quarter, an increase of 20 percent over the third 
quarter of last year. On Long Island, sales were up 10 percent during 
the first nine months of this year, compared with the corresponding 
period in 1997. And two Sundays ago, at the grand opening of a 37-unit 
town-house development in Smithtown, where prices ranged from $210,000 
to $235,000, ``people were lined up with checks in their hand,'' according 
to the developer, Steven Klar, and about 18 units were sold. ``The 
silliness is still with us,'' Michonski of Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy 
said last week, ``but it's abating as people look beyond the weekly 
valleys to more important and stable factors of the market.'' Among 
those factors, Michonski said, are suburban buyers, single people 
seeking starter apartments and the steady flow of immigrants. ``Few 
people realize that we are at a 100-year high in immigration,'' Michonski 
said, ``and what immigrants provide is first-time home buyer support 
in key markets. Now that's not as sexy as the Manhattan real-estate 
market, but neighborhood after neighborhood is being revitalized by 
these immigrants, who save more and have a stronger desire for home 
ownership than Americans.'' There are, certainly, some pale spots 
in the rosy picture. As in any volatile time, people think two or 
three times about making a major purchase. ``We don't feel yet that 
the pace of sales has been hit significantly and prices haven't come 
down,'' said Jacob Shayovitz, president of the Brooklyn Board of Realtors, 
``but I think it's slowing down a bit. The word on the street is `Maybe 
I'll hold off a bit and see what happens tomorrow.''' And in Connecticut, 
Diana Hughes, a broker with Preferred Properties in Stamford, said: 
``People are thinking twice. Some people backed out of deals.'' Other 
market observers, however, point out that any indications of a slowdown 
have come at a time _ in the fall _ when real-estate sales traditionally 
take a breather. And it is during such spells that prices moderate 
toward more realistic levels and buyers become more serious. The lower 
end of the market is more affected by mortgage rates than stock prices, 
said Liz Lindsey, owner of Lindsey Real Estate in Mount Vernon, N.Y. 
``Our buyers look at housing as shelter, not an investment.'' And 
even in tonier Scarsdale, Audrey Rapaport, manager of the Houlihan/Lawrence 
brokerage there, said two weeks ago, ``Whenever the market's down, 
the traffic you get tends to be the serious buyers, and that's what 
we're seeing now.'' Underpinning the residential market are some of 
the firmest fundamentals in decades. Barring the unforeseen, in 16 
days, on Dec. 1, the nation will break the record for the longest 
peacetime economic expansion in history, the 92 months of growth between 
1982 and 1990. Mortgage rates, now hovering at about 7 percent, have 
been low and stable for most of this year, setting a 31-year low of 
6.68 percent for a 30-year, fixed-rate loan during the week that ended 
Oct. 9. That 6.68 percent low, compared with the year's high of 7.28 
percent for the week that ended May 1, marked the narrowest annual 
range for mortgage rates _ .60 percent _ since the late 1970s. ``Certainly,'' 
said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a Butler, 
N.J., firm that tracks mortgage rates, ``it's instructive to note, 
in the midst of volatility in the financial markets, that we have 
had tremendous stability this year in mortgage interest rates.'' And 
so, according to projections calculated by the National Association 
of Realtors, 1998 is forecast to be the third year in a row that the 
nation sets a record for sales of existing homes. There were 4.1 million 
sales in 1996 and 4.2 million last year, and 4.7 million are expected 
this year. ``What we have,'' said James Hughes, dean of the School 
of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, ``is an extraordinarily 
powerful national home market, and that is certainly the overlying 
market reality for the region.'' Hughes offered allegorical allusions 
to recent stages of the market: ``First, we had a Goldilocks economy 
_ not too strong, not too weak, just right. That was over the past 
three years. ``The past nine months or so, overlaying the Goldilocks 
economy, has been an Alfred E. Newman economy _ `What me worry?' _ 
after we first had the Asian financial crisis about this time last 
year. ``And since the stock-market swoon, we've had a Jekyll and Hyde 
economy: It still has great underlying fundamentals, but we have an 
increasingly worrisome dark side. And that's related to the impacts 
of the world financial crisis.'' Fortunately, Hughes said, the New 
York area is less exposed to the effects of foreign crises than other 
sections of the country. ``The areas most hard hit are those that 
export manufactured goods, such as Seattle _ Boeing has lost a lot 
of airline orders _ and those that export food to Asia,'' he noted. 
The major local effect, he said, has been ``the stock-market swoon, 
and we haven't yet seen its impact on the broad housing market. ``The 
tony sectors certainly now have the jitters,'' Hughes said. ``But 
the broad middle market is less impacted because the driving force 
there really is a maturing baby-boom generation trading up, positioning 
themselves in communities where they want to raise their children 
and live for a long time. For them, this is not a discretionary item, 
like moving from a $2 million house to a $4 million house.'' There 
are some less obvious nuances to the New York area's residential market, 
said Rae Rosen, senior regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York. ``It is a very strong housing market,'' she said, ``but 
this region has been one of the weaker areas of the country in terms 
of demand.'' One barometer of that fact is relatively moderate price 
appreciation, except in the most affluent communities. ``For existing 
homes, price increases are lagging the nation in percentage terms,'' 
Ms. Rosen said. For example, in the first half of this year, according 
to data published by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, 
prices in New Jersey rose by slightly less than 4 percent, compared 
with 5 percent nationally. Moderate price appreciation, however, is 
not necessarily bad news. ``In the '80s, prices nearly tripled in 
the metropolitan area,'' Ms. Rosen said. ``So the silver lining is 
that we improve our competitive position.'' For most people, one truism 
holds, Ms. Rosen said _ the ability to buy depends on their current 
job and salary. ``When you're talking about people who work for Wall 
Street, their ability to purchase the mansion of their dreams may 
be crimped,'' she said. ``But for most people _ the rest of us middle-class 
people _ the thing that's driving it is job growth and low interest 
rates, and that's holding so far.'' Even in high-end Manhattan _ so 
noosed to the year-end bonus and the quarterly report _ the financial 
tremors have not loosened a trap door under the residential market. 
``We haven't had a downturn in prices,'' said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman 
of Corcoran Group. ``What we have seen, and this is based on my own 
business, is that people had a knee-jerk reaction to the 500-point 
drop on Aug. 31.'' The next day, ``five out of our 51 contracts due 
to be signed were just not signed,'' Ms. Corcoran said. ``I can't 
recall such a quick reaction borne out of sheer fear.'' September 
was marked by price reductions and far fewer multiple bids, she said, 
but by mid-October, ``We had a tremendous uptick in activity.'' In 
the month since, the Dow has crept upward, even flitting near the 
9,000 mark. The 513-point drop on Aug. 31 represented a 6 percent 
decline in the Dow. Eleven years ago, on Oct. 19, 1987 _ so-called 
Black Monday _ there had also been a 500-plus decline in the Dow. 
But at the time, those 508 points represented a 22.6 percent stock-market 
plunge. Nowadays, said Halstead of Halstead Property Co., ``unlike 
what we had in 1987, when there were 90 days of total paralysis in 
our office, just no new deals, the real-estate market has continued 
through these gyrations. ``There may be an isolated case or two of 
people not abandoning contracts but reneging on verbal price agreements,'' 
Halstead said. ``No one has abandoned their deposit and run for the 
hills. On the other hand, we have had some sellers reduce their asking 
prices.'' Cave, of the brokerage bearing his name, said, however, 
that he had heard of instances where buyers walked away from deposits 
_ ``two instances: one was $400,000 and the other about a million.'' 
Still, he said, ``If it was rife in the industry, I would have heard.'' 
The essential well-being of even the sometimes immoderate luxury market 
was validated by the most recent findings of the Douglas Elliman Manhattan 
Market Report, the most comprehensive analysis available. Jonathan 
Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal company that prepares 
the Elliman report, said that there were 2,214 verified sales of co-ops 
and condominiums in Manhattan during the third quarter of this year, 
a 9.61 percent increase over the 2,017 transactions recorded for the 
corresponding period in 1997. ``And we found that the average sales 
price remained essentially unchanged,'' Miller said. In the second 
quarter, the average price was $529,416, and in the third quarter 
it was $518,986 _ a 1.97 percent drop. At the same time, he said, 
the average number of days on the market decreased 6.2 percent, from 
112 days to 105, and the discount from asking price (the difference 
between the last list price and the sale price) declined 14.02 percent 
_ ``meaning that the sales price was 14 percent closer to the list 
price than during the previous quarter,'' Miller said. If any single 
sector of the Manhattan market has quickly felt the effects of the 
stock market's zigzags it is, not surprisingly, the downtown financial 
district, where new apartment buildings have risen and outmoded office 
towers have been reborn as residences. Andrew Heiberger is president 
of Citi Habitats, a brokerage that deals, in his words, ``with 20- 
to 30-somethings, would-be purchasers who work in the Wall Street 
area and are not only making large salaries but get commissions and 
bonuses that usually represent two or three times their base salary.'' 
``They are pulling in their horns, sitting and waiting,'' Heiberger 
said. ``Especially in the upper end, they are either staying put or 
are going to rent for a year and then look.'' Heiberger said that 
since Merrill Lynch announced the layoff of 3,400 workers on Oct. 
13, the number of sales inquiries at his offices for the upper end 
of the downtown market _ the condominium-loft buildings in TriBeCa, 
the far West Village and the financial district _ have just about 
halved. ``Six months ago we were probably getting 75 inquiries a month 
for apartments priced from $400,000 to $1.5 million, and in the last 
five weeks we've probably received 45 inquiries.'' Prices, however, 
have not dropped. ``For a typical condo loft in those neighborhoods, 
we're still talking $400 to $500 per square foot, so just the demand 
is on hold,'' Heiberger said. ``If there is another two months of 
stable Wall Street activity, the bidding wars could return as quickly 
as they vanished.'' Bidding wars, or the lack of them, may not be 
the most rational measure of the residential market. But there is 
a school of thought that the current jitters and reasonable concerns, 
especially about the luxury end, will eventually prove to be a healthy 
development. ``Probably, in retrospect,'' said Halstead, ``when we 
look at this period three or four months from now and get some data 
that's meaningful, we will see that prices stopped ascending and were 
level for the first time in a very long time. We needed it, because 
the market was overheated and going up too fast.'' Assuming there 
is no global financial meltdown, said Hughes at Rutgers, ``what we'll 
really see for the national economy, as we look forward from here, 
is a slowing of growth.'' ``But it's a manageable slowdown, and a 
slight slowing of the housing market in turn,'' he noted. ``After 
all, the 1998 housing market has been the equivalent of the Yankees 
winning 125 games.'' And unlike the 1980s, when inflation was rampant, 
lending was uninhibited and the real-estate market subverted itself 
by overbuilding, ``the hallmark of this expansion has been that there 
have been no excesses, no imbalances that caused the expansion to 
abort,'' Hughes said. ``The one excess which had been developing is 
the extreme overexuberance in the high end of the housing market,'' 
he said. ``And so the effect of the stock-market swoon is to tone 
down that excess, and make the whole market much more sustainable 
in the long run.''
