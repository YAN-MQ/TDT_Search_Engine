President Clinton is closing a troubled chapter in his presidency. 
On Friday, he agreed to pay Paula Jones $850,000 to drop her sexual 
harassment suit against him. Jones had accused Mr. Clinton of making 
an unwanted sexual advance toward her in 1991 when he was governor 
of Arkansas and she was a state employee. The settlement doesn't require 
Mr. Clinton, who has denied the allegations, to apologize or admit 
guilt. Mr. Clinton's lawyer says the president is pleased to have 
the matter behind him. The settlement number was $850,000, I don't 
know how that will be distributed. I understand Ms. Jones' legal fees 
are $3 million or $4 million, but that's not my problem. That's a 
problem they'll have to work out. Jones has been unavailable for comment, 
but her husband says she is ecstatic about the settlement.
