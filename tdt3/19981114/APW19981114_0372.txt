Iraq's government is expected to respond positively to pleas from 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to resume cooperation with U.N. 
arms inspectors, a senior Iraqi official said Saturday. Such a step 
could defuse the crisis over arms inspections that has led to threatened 
American attacks on Iraq and a buildup of U.S. military forces in 
the Gulf. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told 
reporters he ``had information'' that the Iraqi leadership would reply 
favorably to a letter Annan sent to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
The official said Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who recently met 
with Annan in New York, would call the secretary-general with news 
of the Iraqi decision later Saturday. Other officials said an announcement 
could come in several hours. Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, 
said Friday that Annan was sending such a letter. He said he didn't 
know the contents, but Western diplomats said it would repeat Annan's 
urgent appeal to Saddam to resume cooperation immediately. The Iraqi 
official, from the Culture and Information Ministry, did not reveal 
the letter's contents. But it was understood to contain Annan's personal 
pledge to work for the lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq if the weapons 
inspectors were allowed to go back to work. Sanctions were imposed 
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which spurred the Gulf War. 
Under the cease-fire that ended Gulf War in 1991, sanctions cannot 
be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has been 
disarmed. In Washington, David Leavy, spokesman for Clinton's National 
Security Council, said Saturday in commenting on Annan's letter that 
the U.S. position had not changed and Iraq must cooperate with the 
United Nations. ``Public commitment by Iraq must be followed by concrete 
and demonstrable actions.'' Iraq had demanded that the U.N. Security 
Council, in offering a comprehensive review of the U.N. arms inspections, 
specifically say that review was designed to end the sanctions, which 
ban Iraq's free export of oil and have devastated the economy. A promise 
from Annan would be less than a Security Council pledge, but it could 
offer Iraq a way out, as an American attack appears more and more 
likely. The news of a possible breakthrough came a day after statements 
Friday by Saddam and U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared to offer 
little way out of the crisis.
