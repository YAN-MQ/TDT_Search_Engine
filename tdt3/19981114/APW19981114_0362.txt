The main opposition party won the first round of Senate elections 
and another opposition grouping came second, exit polls showed Saturday. 
The results are a blow to the governing Social Democrats Candidates 
for the conservative Civic Democratic Party advanced to the second 
round in 24 out of 27 districts in the two days of voting, followed 
by the four-party center-right coalition led by the Christian Democrats 
and the Freedom Union, with 17 candidates. The ruling Social democrats 
came third with 13 candidates, according to exit polls announced on 
Czech state radio. Polling stations closed at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT), and 
final results were expected late Sunday. At stake in the 81-member 
Senate were seats of 27 members whose terms had run out. Candidates 
had to get a 50 percent majority to win the election outright or face 
a run-off between the two top finishers. The run-offs are scheduled 
for Nov. 20-21. Exit polls indicated none of the candidates gained 
more than 50 percent of first round vote, meaning that run-off elections 
will be necessary in all districts. Turnout was estimated to be 50 
percent. The Senate vote is considered a test of support for Prime 
Minister Milos Zeman's government. Following two years of political 
deadlock, the country's early general election in June produced a 
one-party minority government of Social Democrats led by Zeman. His 
government survived in Parliament thanks to a pact struck with the 
runner-up, the center-right Civic Democratic Party. ``I expected we 
would fare better,'' Foreign Minister Jan Kavan commented on the election 
results. The Senate was created as a safety mechanism to ensure the 
country could function in case of a constitutional crisis. It can 
pass laws, except laws on budget and constitution, should the 200-seat 
lower house of the parliament be dissolved. Since its formation in 
1996, the Senate has been criticized by all members of the political 
spectrum for not being effective enough. Several parties, including 
the Communists and the ultra-nationalist Republicans, have even called 
for its abolishment. No exit polls were done for local elections, 
which also took place also Friday and Saturday. More than 60,000 local 
posts are at stake. Independent candidates are expected to dominate 
the local elections, which have little bearing on the balance of political 
power in the country. Final results are expected Tuesday.
