Frank Litsky chooses 16 teams that might have what it takes to reach 
the women's Final Four at the San Jose Arena next March. (Last season's 
record in parentheses.) Last Team Standing Tennessee (39-0) Two years 
ago, the Vols lost 10 games and still won the national tournament. 
Last year, with the best freshman class ever, they went unbeaten and 
won the title again. This year, they are riding a 45-game winning 
streak and looking for another national title from 6-foot-2-inch Chamique 
Holdsclaw, the best female player in college and maybe anywhere, and 
the 6-2 forward Tamika Catchings and the 5-10 guard Semeka Randall, 
the best of last year's freshman class. Three That Could Find the 
Way to San Jose Louisiana Tech (31-4) Last season's National Collegiate 
Athletic Association finalist should be even better, with an up-tempo 
team eight or nine players deep. Four starters return, led by the 
6-0 forward Amanda Wilson (18.5 points and 8.8 rebounds a game, with 
a 62 percent shooting average). But as Coach Leon Barmore said, ``You 
could put all the rest of us together and not beat Tennessee.'' Connecticut 
(34-3) The Huskies have lost their dominating backcourt of the all-American 
Nykesha Sales and Rita Williams, but they will get quick help from 
this year's best recruiting class. Svetlana Abrosimova, the 6-2 sophomore 
forward from Russia, is a superstar in the making, and the 6-0 forward-guard 
Shea Ralph is back after two right-knee reconstructions in five months. 
Duke (24-8) The top 10 players return from a round-of-eight team that 
gets better by the year. They include twin-tower centers in 6-6 Michele 
VanGorp and 6-4 Payton Black. Games against Connecticut, Tennessee 
and Notre Dame will test this team before its tough schedule in the 
Atlantic Coast Conference. Four That Could Knock on the Door UCLA 
(20-9) The Bruins are still angry over their controversial loss to 
Alabama in last year's NCAA tournament. They should be the new power 
in the Pacific 10 with a veteran team, especially if the 6-3 power 
forward Maylana Martin (18.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.4 assists) overcomes 
a bad back. Purdue (23-10) Thirteen players return from a team that 
missed last season's Final Four by only 7 points. The backbone is 
the backcourt duo of Stephanie White-McCarty (20.6 points a game) 
and Ukari Figgs (15.5). Alabama (24-10) Only two starters return, 
but the freshman class should help. The key is Dominique Canty, a 
5-10 guard/forward who averaged 21.5 points a game last year and may 
be the best collegiate player not at Tennessee. North Carolina (27-7) 
The Tar Heels scared Tennessee in an NCAA regional final last season, 
and they remain deep despite the graduation of the all-American Tracy 
Reid. One concern: the 6-5 freshman LaShonda Allen is the only player 
taller than 6-2. Eight That Could Hang Around Late Virginia (19-10) 
DeMya Walker, a 6-2 power forward (16.3 points, 8.4 rebounds) must 
take command. The 6-0 forward Monick Foote and the 5-8 guard Tiffany 
Bower return after missing last season with injuries. Rutgers (22-10) 
This may be another breakthrough year for the Scarlet Knights, who 
return everyone from last season's round-of-16 team. The best part 
of this deep, quick team is the backcourt of 5-6 Tasha Pointer and 
5-10 Tomora Young. Texas Tech (26-5) The all-American Alicia Thompson 
(23.3 points) is gone, but four senior starters return to the best 
team in the Big 12. Now the offensive burden falls on Angie Braziel, 
a 6-3 post player with new international experience. Georgia (17-11) 
Last season was not typical because the freshmen had to play, ready 
or not. The team is still young but better, especially with the 5-10 
twins Kelly and Coco Miller at guard. Tawana McDonald, a 6-4 freshman 
center, should help. Kansas (23-9) The Jayhawks, with nine straight 
20-victory seasons, are solid again. The five starters return, led 
by 6-2 Lynn Pride, a shooting guard-small forward. Two newcomers, 
6-6 Kristen Geoffrey and 6-5 Dalchon Brown, provide size. North Carolina 
State (25-7) Last season the Wolfpack upset Old Dominion and Connecticut 
and reached the Final Four. Five perimeter players return, but the 
6-6 center Summer Erb must replace Chasity Melvin as a commanding 
force inside. Stanford (21-6) Those dominant inside players _ Olympia 
Scott, Heather Owen, Kristen Folkl, Vanessa Nygaard and Naomi Mulitauaopele 
_ are gone, and the 6-0 senior forward Regan Freuen and the 6-1 freshman 
guard Lindsey Yamasaki are injured. Still, Stanford will be dangerous. 
Notre Dame (22-10) Two years ago, it was a surprising Final Four trip. 
Last year, although rebuilding, the Irish made the round of 16. Four 
starters return from that team, led by the 5-10 guard Sheila McMillen, 
a 40-percent 3-point shooter.
