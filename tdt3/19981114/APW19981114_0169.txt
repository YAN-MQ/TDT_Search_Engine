Peru's foreign minister Saturday praised the dlrs 41.5 billion bailout 
of Brazil organized by the International Monetary Fund, saying it 
would help restore stability to Latin America's biggest economy. ``This 
is something we have been waiting for,'' Fernando de Trazegnies told 
Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. ``It is very important for Latin 
America.'' He spoke on the sidelines of a meeting of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation forum, which Peru formally joined Saturday. Brazil, 
which accounts for 40 percent of Latin American economic output, is 
the latest country to be stricken by the global contagion that began 
in Thailand in 1997. De Trazegnies said the bailout package, which 
includes contributions from the U.S. and other countries, would help 
entrench economic reform introduced recently by Brazilian President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso. ``I am expecting President Cardoso can 
succeed now,'' he said. The IMF unveiled the financial assistance 
package for Brazil on Friday, tying the release of the funds to a 
government commitment to open the economy, maintain ``firm monetary 
discipline'' and retain its current exchange rate regime.
