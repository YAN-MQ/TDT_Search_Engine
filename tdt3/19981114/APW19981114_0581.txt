Flanker Neil Back, goal-kicking flyhalf Paul Grayson and veteran mid-fielder 
Jerry Guscott notched individual records Saturday as England scored 
a record 110-0 win over the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifier. 
It was England's biggest win in an international, eclipsings its previous 
record total of 60 points, which it achieved against Japan, Canada 
and Wales. Back scored four tries, equalling the world try-scoring 
record for a forward and becoming the first English forward to score 
three or more tries in one international. He could easily have set 
a new world mark for a forward but passed to debutant Dan Luger to 
score in the 54th minute when both players were unopposed. Grayson 
smashed the existing England goal-kicking record of eight, kicking 
15 goals in the 80 minutes and missing just one chance. And center 
Jerry Guscott became England's second highest try-scorer by scoring 
four tries, including a solo effort in the 70th minute to break the 
100-point barrier. Guscott, whose last try was against Wales in 1996, 
scored once in the first half and three times in the second period 
to increase his tally to 22 tries in 53 tests. Pundits had predicted 
a 100 point win against the Dutch amateurs and, with a 47-0 lead at 
halftime, the powerful England professionals gave themselves every 
chance to reach the target. The Netherlands played spoiling tactics 
in the first half, at one stage restricting England to one try in 
13 minutes, before England settled into its game-plan. Back scored 
the first try in the 4th minute after England won a line-out and drove 
a rolling maul 10 meters upfield against a powerless Dutch pack. The 
Dutch consistently made the mistake of committing too many players 
to rucks and mauls, leaving their flanks unguarded and allowing England 
too many overlaps in broken play. England also dominated the set pieces, 
particularly the scrums, where the Netherlands had no chance of matching 
the strength and prowess of its well-drilled opponents.
