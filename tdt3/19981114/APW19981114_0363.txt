Turkey's second high-ranking general sent a harsh warning to Greece 
and Greek Cypriots on Saturday to give up what he called ``hostile 
policies'' against Turks on this divided Mediterranean island. ``Heroic 
Turkish sons will be able to drown in their own blood those who want 
to drink Turkish blood,'' Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, deputy chief of the Turkish 
general staff, was quoted as saying by the Turkish Cypriot news agency, 
TAK. Ozkok traveled to the northern Turkish sector of Cyprus on Saturday 
to participate in Sunday's celebrations of the 15th anniversary of 
the inception of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot Republic, which is 
only recognized by Ankara. Ozkok accused Greek Cypriots of heightening 
tension on the island with their plans to deploy Russian made anti-aircraft 
missiles and Greece with supporting them. ``All weapons that will 
be brought to southern Cyprus will cease to exist when a clash breaks 
out,'' Ozkok said. Turkey has vowed to block the missiles deployment 
by force if necessary; Greece says that would mean war between the 
two NATO partners. Cyprus has been divided since Turkish forces invaded 
the northern third of the island to protect the Turkish minority following 
a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece in 1974. Turkey 
maintains about 30,000 troops on the island.
