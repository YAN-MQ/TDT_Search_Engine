The English like to poke fun at the French, but much to their annoyance 
the French usually respond with indifference, which perhaps explains 
why an obscure Gaullist politician enjoyed 15 minutes of fame in England 
this month. Here at last was a patriot ready to defend his nation's 
honor in face of provocations by the perfidious Albion. English newspapers 
chortled with delight. At last, a reaction! All the better, in fact, 
because Florent Longuepee, a 33-year-old conservative Parisian politician, 
was quite serious. He wrote to British Prime Minister Tony Blair to 
complain that the Eurostar train from Paris to London via the Channel 
Tunnel arrives at Waterloo Station. This reminder of a famous British 
military victory over the French could distress French travelers, 
he said. In the name of European entente, he suggested, the station 
should be renamed. ``No, this is not a joke,'' he insisted in a telephone 
interview. ``Do you think General De Gaulle would have agreed to inaugurate 
the Eurostar at Waterloo Station?'' Well, no. De Gaulle would not 
even allow Britain to join the European Community. Longuepee went 
further (although not as far as actually taking the Eurostar to Waterloo). 
If Whitehall rejected his suggestion, he said he would propose changing 
the name of the Paris terminus of the Eurostar from the Gare du Nord 
to the Gare de Fontenoy, after a 1745 battle in Belgium where French 
troops defeated the English, even after gallantly inviting ``Messieurs 
les Anglais'' to fire first. British newspapers, never embarrassed 
to joust with jingoism, seemed cheered to learn that some of the French 
were still hurting over Napoleon's 1815 trouncing at Waterloo. ``If 
the French really want to rename the Gare du Nord, they should choose 
a more celebrated Norman victory, say, Hastings,'' The London Times 
said. And, the French were also reminded, didn't Paris also have railway 
and metro stations named after great military victories (albeit not 
over England)? Downing Street was naturally called on to respond, 
even though Longuepee admitted he was not speaking for the French 
government. ``We only received the letter yesterday,'' a Blair spokeswoman 
said, ``and it is in French, so it is being translated.'' Is that 
really necessary? Isn't Blair rather proud of his fluent French? ``The 
prime minister is away,'' she said. ``Anyway, there are no plans to 
change the name of Waterloo Station.'' Well, of course not. Still, 
once again, the English had a laugh at the expense of their traditional 
foe. Yet once again the entire episode said more about England (though 
not Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland) than it did about France. 
Put differently, the English remain obsessed by France, but the fascination 
is no longer mutual. Alas, Longuepee's initiative was ignored in France. 
It is becoming rather painful for the English. They keep making funny 
faces at the French. But when France looks west nowadays, it sees 
only the United States.
