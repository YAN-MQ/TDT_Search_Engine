The proof that Thomas Jefferson fathered a child with Sally Hemings 
has embarrassed historians who saw him as too noble for sex with a 
slave _ and vindicated black descendants who knew all along that he 
was as lusty as anyone else. Genetic tests have linked Jefferson to 
Hemings' final child, Eston, born in 1808. But even historians who 
defended Jefferson for decades are finding it hard to believe that 
he avoided Hemings while the two were young and vital and made her 
his lover only as he approached the grave. The emerging consensus 
is that the two became lovers earlier and that the affair went on 
longer than we yet know. The first paradox was that Jefferson wrote 
the Declaration of Independence while enslaving others. The new paradox 
is that he produced a mixed-race child with a slave while maintaining 
that African-Americans were only marginally human and a threat to 
white racial integrity. Jefferson was notoriously self-deceptive. 
Even so, it is quite possible that he viewed the mulatto Sally Hemings 
not as black, but as part of some middle category. Racial distinctions 
that now seem etched in stone were fluid and hotly disputed in the 
slave-era South. As the recipient of America's first slaves, Virginia 
was first to encounter the confusions of miscegenation, which produced 
a class of people who were neither black nor white but could often 
live as either, depending on preference and the needs of the moment. 
There were court battles galore to determine who was what. Present-day 
America, obsessed with race, is blind to this complicated past. The 
fact is that racial distinctions are as shifting and arbitrary as 
they were when Sally met Tom. The first slave ships sailed into Jamestown 
harbor in 1619. The Virginia criminal records show the first prosecution 
for interracial sex 10 years later, when a white man named Hugh Davis 
was forced to confess in church and ``soundly whipped before an assemblage 
of Negroes and others for abusing himself to the dishonor of God and 
the same of Christians by defiling his body in lying with a Negro.'' 
But laws and public whippings were no check on lust across the color 
line. As slaves grew whiter and whiter, lawmakers scrambled for legal 
definitions to distinguish black from white. The first laws in Virginia 
_ widely copied elsewhere _ defined anyone who was ``one-fourth white 
or more'' as mulatto. The question of how much black blood one could 
have and be classified ``white'' was tactfully avoided, for fear that 
``white'' citizens with Negro ancestry would be dispossessed. The 
subject was especially tangled in South Carolina _ particularly in 
Charleston, which had developed an enormous mulatto elite whose members 
were nearly as white and just as rich as anyone in the city. Early 
court records are filled with cases of fair-skinned people who were 
accused of being secretly mulatto but were later declared ``white'' 
by a judge and jury. Racial experts were called and family trees drawn, 
with the frequent result that no one could tell where the white family 
began and the black one ended. In one case, the judge threw out the 
``expert'' testimony and the blood theory of race, deciding that the 
plaintiff was indeed ``white'' because he had been well received in 
white society and had ``commonly exercised the privileges of a white 
man.'' Fearful that ``whiteness'' was being diluted and washed away, 
South Carolinians amended their constitution to ban intermarriage, 
keeping what they viewed as a sexual barrier between whites and African-Americans. 
The voters struck that long-ignored provision earlier this month, 
but 38 percent of them wanted to keep it. In fact, the sexual barrier 
between the races had never really existed. As early as the 1700s, 
the clearest fact about slavery was the lightening of its skin. The 
trend continued until there were almost no blacks of strictly African 
descent. In this context, race-based identity is problematical at 
best and genetically based theories of race and intellectual difference 
seem absurd. The Hemings family was a forerunner in racial ambiguity. 
Three of Sally's children dropped their ``black'' identities and lived 
as ``whites.'' They had little choice, if they hoped to accumulate 
property and move unencumbered through society. But their journey 
shows us that Americans are more entangled in blood and aspiration 
than we generally care to acknowledge.
