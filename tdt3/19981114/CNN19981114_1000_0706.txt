Authorities suspect a welder's torch may be responsible for a fire 
at the new Arena being built for the NBA's Miami heat. Flames could 
be seen shooting from the American airlines Arena along the waterfront 
yesterday. Construction on the 20,000-seat facility began in January. 
Team officials say they don't expect the fire to delay the Arena's 
planned opening in December of next year.
