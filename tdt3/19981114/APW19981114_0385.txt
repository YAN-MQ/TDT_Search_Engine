Plans by a U.S filmmaker to film a major movie about a 19th-century 
Thai king remained deadlocked Saturday, but some progress appeared 
to have been made in easing environmental concerns related to the 
making of another major film. The country's Film Board refused last 
week to let 20th Century Fox film its ``Anna and the King'' on location 
in Thailand, maintaining it insults King Mongkut. The board said script 
revisions submitted by Fox don't go far enough in changing what it 
insists are historical inaccuracies about Mongkut, also portrayed 
unflatteringly in the famous stage and screen productions of ``The 
King and I.'' While the board left open the option of submitting the 
script for a third time, Supinda Chakrabhand, an adviser to Fox, said 
last week the company couldn't wait much longer and would soon decide 
whether to shoot the location scenes in neighboring Malaysia instead. 
But the Thai coordinators for the film, to star Jodie Foster and Hong 
Kong's Chow Yun Fat, said Saturday that Fox still hopes to shoot the 
film in Thailand. ``The company is now revising the final script and 
expected to submit it to the Thai Film Board soon,'' said Malinee 
Chakrabhand, who assists her sister Supinda. The two are members of 
the extended royal family, and King Mongkut was their great-great 
grandfather. Malinee was responding to a report Saturday in the Bangkok 
Post newspaper quoting Mike Moder, Fox's vice president of features, 
as saying he was bidding Thailand ``good-bye.''. ``That was Moder's 
old message from before Nov. 13,'' Malinee told The Associated Press. 
``But now Moder agrees that Fox should wait and revise the script.'' 
She confirmed, however, that the company has begun doing pre-production 
work in Malaysia. ``Thailand is the best shooting site for the movie, 
so Fox will take another chance to try again. But if Thailand insists 
on turning down the movie in the next meeting, Malaysia is the best 
bet,'' she said. Meanwhile, another planned Fox movie, ``The Beach,'' 
has made progress in allaying the fears that it will cause environmental 
damage when it is filmed on the southern island of Phi Phi, a popular 
tourist destination. Residents eased their opposition after Fox accepted 
conditions to ensure the well-being of the island's environment both 
before and after the shooting, the Nation newspaper reported Saturday. 
The Thai coordinating team for the movie told The Nation that Fox 
has no problem with the conditions because most of them were already 
in the contract the company signed with Thailand's Forestry Department. 
Shooting of the movie, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is expected to 
begin in mid-January.
