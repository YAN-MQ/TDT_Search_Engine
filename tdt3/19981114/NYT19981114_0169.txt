For more than two decades, the Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery has been 
one of the most hotly debated fisheries in the world. As the annual 
meeting of the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic 
Tunas begins Sunday in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, contention is 
rising over such issues as quota reductions and a lack of compliance 
with existing agreements. According to United States delegates, American 
fishermen are shouldering the brunt of the conservation effort, while 
European nations are cashing in on the Atlantic bluefin fishery. Since 
the 1960s, Japan has offered U.S. commercial fishermen a strong market 
for giant bluefin. In the past, prices for high-quality tuna, which 
have averaged about 400 pounds when landed in U.S. waters, have sometimes 
topped $63 a pound. Single fish, which can weigh more than 1,000 pounds, 
are reported to have fetched $30,000 on the dock and been resold for 
$80,000 in Japan, where 90 percent of the world's bluefin catch is 
consumed. With many fisheries in decline, the influx of cash from 
bluefin sales has helped keep many economies _ personal and national 
_ healthy over the last decade. Percy Stevens fishes commercially 
for giant bluefin tuna in the harpoon category, one of five management 
categories established by the National Marine Fisheries Service for 
the allocation of the U.S. quota. He runs his 35-foot Heidi Marie 
out of Ogunquit, Maine. Rigged with a mast for the spotter and a long 
platform off the bow, the ``pulpit'' for the harpooner, Stevens' boat 
is typical of those in the harpoon fleet. Stevens has been fishing 
for tuna all his life. ``I went with my father when I was a kid, then 
in 1979 I went with a fellow named Timmy Tower,'' he said. ``He put 
me onto a big one and I threw _ my first fish _ and I got him. I was 
hooked.'' Like Stevens, Jimmy Donofrio, executive director of the 
New Jersey-based Recreational Fishermen's Alliance, is passionate 
about this fishery. ``The fishery for small bluefin in the mid-Atlantic 
states goes back to the days of sail,'' Donofrio said. ``Around the 
turn of the century, they used to troll for bluefin with catboats 
and land between 15,000 and 20,000 tons in a season. ``We're not looking 
for that kind of quota today, but people have a longstanding right 
to fish for recreation and subsistence,'' Donofrio said. ``All we 
want is a reasonable bag limit. We consider four fish per vessel reasonable. 
A catch-and-release fishery is not going to satisfy us.'' In a controversial 
decision, the National Marine Fisheries Service listed bluefin tuna 
as ``overfished'' and, in response to a congressional stock-rebuilding 
mandate, may call for a U.S. reduction of up to 77 percent. The issues 
affecting domestic management of bluefin range far beyond U.S. waters. 
Bluefin can swim at up to 55 mph and their trans-Atlantic crossings 
have been well documented. Originally managed as one stock, since 
1981 Atlantic bluefin tuna have been considered by the International 
Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, known as ICCAT, 
as two separate stocks: one in the East, with its spawning grounds 
in the Mediterranean Sea, and one in the West, thought to spawn exclusively 
in the Gulf of Mexico. For management purposes the two stocks are 
divided by an arbitrary line drawn down the middle of the Atlantic 
along the 45th meridian. ICCAT currently assumes there is only minimal 
(3 percent) mixing between Eastern and Western fish. Because of this 
separate-management scenario, known as the Two-Stock Theory, countries 
in the East have been landing record catches _ more than 40,000 metric 
tons in four of the last five years _ while the United States, Canada 
and Japan share a Western quota of 2,354 metric tons. American fishermen 
get 1,344 metric tons, 3 percent of the total Atlantic catch. ``The 
Two-Stock Theory was a political decision,'' said Dick Stone, formerly 
a fisheries service scientist and now science adviser to the Recreational 
Fisherman's Alliance. ``We couldn't get the Europeans to go along 
with strict conservation measures so we split the stock.'' Rich Ruais, 
executive director of the East Coast Tuna Association, calls the Two-Stock 
Theory ``an international joke, and a tragic joke on U.S. fishermen. 
The fish we conserve are feeding an expanding fishery in the East. 
While we abide by catch and size restrictions, countries like Spain, 
Portugal and France are estimated to be fishing well over their quotas,'' 
he said. ``In the Bay of Biscay, off the west coast of France, 50 
percent of the catch is undersized, much of it age 0 fish, that's 
less than four pounds.'' Faced with the possibility of crippling quota 
reductions, many commercial and recreational fishermen, often at odds 
over domestic allocation, are joining forces and calling on science 
to help them challenge the validity of the Two-Stock Theory. All agree 
that they have done their share for conservation and that it's time 
for Eastern Atlantic countries to share the cost of rebuilding bluefin 
stocks. To analyze movement trends of bluefin, a research project 
conducted by Dr. Molly Lutcavage of the New England Aquarium in Boston, 
with the aid of commercial fishermen and financial support from the 
East Coast Tuna Association, tagged 20 bluefin off Massachusetts in 
1997. ``We were criticized for working with commercial fishermen,'' 
said Lutcavage. ``But how could you not work with commercial fishermen? 
They're the experts.'' Dr. Barbara Block of Stanford University, in 
conjunction with the recreational fishery off Cape Hatteras, N.C., 
undertook a similar, more extensive project involving more than 200 
fish. Both studies used ``pop-up tags,'' designed to release from 
the tuna after a specific period of time _ sometimes up to nine months 
_ and transmit data, via satellite, back to the scientists. Results 
from Lutcavage's work, though limited, are being used to challenge 
the current management system. Of 20 tags attached to spawning-age 
fish, 8-plus years old, 17 have been retrieved. After nine months, 
five fish had crossed into the Eastern management area, nearly 30 
percent, 10 times what ICCAT assumed. Block's work, although designed 
mostly to test the technology, shows similar movement trends. Most 
of her fish were tagged with long-term archival tags, but out of 37 
tags released, 35 were retrieved, and two bluefin had crossed into 
the Eastern management area after only 90 days, the maximum time period 
of Block's pop-up tags. Dave Wilmot, chairman of the Ocean Wildlife 
Campaign, a coalition of environmental groups including the Audubon 
Society, World Wildlife Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
is not convinced. ``There is still too much uncertainty,'' he said. 
``As a scientist, I would be very reluctant to make important management 
decisions based on a handful of tags. It'll be another five years 
of research before we really begin to understand bluefin stock structure 
and spawning habits.'' Wilmot notes that a lack of conservation action 
in the past has led to disastrous results in other fisheries. ``If 
the U.S. wants to show it's serious, then we've got to take a leadership 
role by calling for catch reductions. Inaction by other countries 
is no excuse for shirking our responsibility.'' John Graves, chairman 
of the U.S. ICCAT advisory committee, has already made it clear that 
the pop-up tag surveys will not affect this year's bluefin stock assessment. 
But he has also stated unequivocally that the United States is going 
to be calling for stiff penalties against any country that continues 
to plunder this international resource. In discussions with U.S. representatives, 
neither Japanese nor Canadian delegates have clarified their positions 
on possible quota reductions. However, Pat Chamut, Canada's assistant 
deputy minister for fisheries management, did say that ``Canadian 
fishermen will be less likely to go along with further restrictions 
unless something is done to bring the East in line.'' Chamut called 
ICCAT's inability to limit catches in the East ``appalling and disgraceful.'' 
He said Canada would support sanctions against countries not in compliance 
with ICCAT recommendations. In the Western management area, bluefin 
stocks appear to be rebounding. National Marine Fisheries Service 
scientists acknowledge that there is a greater abundance of tuna than 
expected, but insist that stocks are at least 80 percent below the 
optimum levels called for in the 1996 congressional mandate for sustainable 
fisheries. The best U.S. rebuilding efforts however, will affect only 
a small percentage of the Atlantic-wide stock. Most parties, even 
many European scientists, agree that the conservation of bluefin tuna 
hinges in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean. Whether ICCAT can control 
all its countries, and end overfishing and the targeting of undersized 
fish, remains to be seen.
