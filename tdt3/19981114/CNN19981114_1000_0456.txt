One of the state attorneys general participating in tobacco talks 
says the two sides are very close to reaching a settlement. An announcement 
is expected on Monday. Under the deal, cigarettemakers would pay $206

treating people with smoking-related illnesses. In return, the 46 
states would agree to drop their lawsuits.
