Amnesty International urged Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Saturday 
to order his security forces to show restraint in dealing with anti-government 
protesters. ``It is tragedy that Indonesia's new political order should 
be born amid a new wave of human rights violations,'' the London-based 
human rights group said in a statement released in the Malaysian capital. 
``Police and security services have to be retrained,'' said John Kellock, 
Amnesty's regional representative, who is in Kuala Lumpur in connection 
with next week's summit of leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) countries. Opposition leaders and student activists 
have called on Habibie and Wiranto to quit. Deadly clashes between 
students and security forces gave way to widespread rioting in the 
capital Saturday as rock-throwing mobs burned cars, looted shops and 
ransacked police stations. Local media report and diplomats say at 
least 14 people, most of them students, have died this week in the 
worst violence in Jakarta since riots and protests ousted former President 
Suharto in May after 32 years of authoritarian rule. Habibie called 
on the military to take immediate action to restore order. He called 
for calm before an emergency meeting with military chief Gen. Wiranto, 
the defense minister and other Cabinet members. Demonstrators were 
calling on the government to introduce more liberal reforms. ``In 
recent months, the Indonesian army has shown great restrain in handling 
demonstrations,'' the Amnesty statement said. ``But there is a risk 
that the recent killings will undermine public confidence in the professionalism 
and accountability of the military.'' Kellock also urged APEC leaders 
to help by ``appealing (to Habibie) for restraint and for freedom 
of expression to be respected.'' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas 
Saturday denied rumors that Habibie had canceled his visit to Kuala 
Lumpur because of the violence in Jakarta.
