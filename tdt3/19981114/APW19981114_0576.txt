A U.S. envoy worked Saturday on a deal to bring lasting peace to Kosovo, 
but a reported shooting illustrated the difficulties of quieting tensions 
in the ethnic Albanian-majority Serbian province. The Serb Media Center, 
which reflects the official Serb view in Kosovo, reported that an 
ethnic Albanian loyal to Serb authorities was shot to death late Friday 
by ``Albanian extremists.'' His son was wounded in the attack in the 
village of Prekoluka. The two were part of local patrols organized 
by Serbian authorities seeking to prevent pro-independence Kosovo 
Albanian guerrillas from taking control of the remote area. They were 
shot while at home, but the report left unclear whether or not they 
were armed. In Pristina on Saturday, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met 
with Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova as part of efforts to mediate 
a lasting settlement for the province, whose 90-percent ethnic Albanian 
majority wants independence. Hill said he saw quick movement ahead. 
``We discussed a political agreement, laid out some dates and timetables 
for work ahead,'' he told reporters. ```We are getting to the point 
where we need to start thinking about what this agreement is going 
to look like, to get all the details down because things are going 
to happen very quickly in the coming weeks.'' He did not go into details 
on the peace plan but suggested it would involve all-round compromise, 
saying: ``A lot of people are going to have to make some accommodation 
with the other side.'' Heavy fighting in Kosovo stopped with the agreement 
signed Oct. 12 by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who pledged 
a pullback of Yugoslav army and Serb police from Kosovo and to allow 
a 2,000-member international team to verify the pullback. Some violence 
has persisted, however, as the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe forms the verifying team, and Serbs and ethnic Albanians 
blame each other for the bloodshed. The government crackdown on the 
separatists in the province has left hundreds dead, mostly ethnic 
Albanians, and made refugees of hundreds of thousands more. Despite 
the agreement, the displaced have been reluctant to return. The Kosovo 
Liberation Army was not privy to the October agreement, but it claims 
it is respecting a cease-fire and responding only when attacked. Authorities 
claim the guerrillas are provoking fights, hoping for a massive response 
that would then lead to new NATO threats of airstrikes on Yugoslav 
targets. The draft political solution Hill is working on envisages 
a broad autonomy for Kosovo Albanians. Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav 
republic, rules out full independence for Kosovo and this is also 
opposed by world powers who fear border changes in the volatile Balkans.
