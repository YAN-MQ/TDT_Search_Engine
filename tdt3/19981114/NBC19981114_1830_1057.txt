"In focus," this evening, using virtual reality to teach police officers 
some real-life lessons. NBC's Dan Lothian reports from San Francisco. 
Left, right, left. Recruits at San Francisco's police academy, learning 
discipline, following orders. Down, one, two, three, four. They're 
a few weeks away from the fronts lines, but in a way, they have already 
been there. Just relax. What's going on? Where is he? This is perhaps 
the most sophisticated simulated firearms training program in the 
country. A sort of virtual reality exercise known as "fats III." If 
the range shows our officers how to shoot, we try to show them why 
to shoot. And learning why means landing in the middle of one of almost 
30 dangerous computer-generated scenarios displayed on a large screen. 
The weapon armed not with bullets, but a laser, and connected to an 
air tank, giving the feel of a real gun being fired. Step out of the 
vehicle now. Recruit, Ted Mullins is attempting to arrest a suspect 
after a Car chase, when suddenly, the suspect pulls a gun -- a split-second 
decision to take cover and respond. Mullins was able to stop the suspect. 
All of his shots replayed and marked with colored dots on the screen. 
Why don't you tell me about that. What happened? Now he must explain 
why he did, what he did. It's so realistic. Once you go through this, 
once I encounter this situation in the real world, a lot of it is 
going to become second nature. All of these recruits must past the 
firearms program twice to be fully authorized to go on patrol. We're 
evaluating them to go out on the street with an awesome amount of 
responsibility. Before taking the test for a second time, recruits 
have to run through a course, jump fences and run up these steps. 
Out of breath and tense, now facing a virtual reality life-or-death 
situation. It's stress graduates of the program now find helpful out 
on the streets. When you have to see it and do it and just based on 
how you would react to it is a plus. And the result says police chief 
Fred lau -- I think it's had a real positive impact. Our officer-involved 
shootings are on the decrease. And that's the goal, preparing the 
men and women in blue to stay cool in hot situations. Dan Lothian, 
NBC news, San Francisco.
