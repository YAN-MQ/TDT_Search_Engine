The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed relief Saturday that Iraq had 
agreed to resume U.N. weapons inspections. ``Moscow considers this 
an important step toward the settlement of the situation around Iraq 
by political means,'' the ministry said in a statement. It added that 
Russia maintains ``active contacts with all concerned capitals and 
the U.N. secretary general.'' Earlier Saturday, the Kremlin announced 
that President Boris Yeltsin had sent a message to U.S. President 
Bill Clinton restating Russia's opposition to the use of force against 
Iraq. The message was sent Friday, the Kremlin said. The day before 
that, Yeltsin had written Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, urging him 
to back down from his refusal to allow the weapons inspectors do their 
job. ``The situation now is such that the threat of using force may 
become a reality unless an urgent political solution is found,'' Yeltsin 
wrote, according to his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin. Russia has consistently 
argued against the use of force against Iraq, and has sought to play 
a mediator's role in Iraq's frequent confrontations with the West, 
including the latest crisis. However, unlike previous crises, Russia 
did not send an envoy to personally mediate this time. In the letter 
to Clinton, Yeltsin ``spoke strongly against the use of force,'' the 
presidential press service said. He also criticized Iraq for failing 
to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. Yeltsin told Clinton he 
hoped that by ``working jointly, we will be able to ward off the worst 
and return Baghdad to the path of compliance with the decisions of 
the international community.'' In discussing Iraq's decision to cooperate 
with the weapons inspectors, Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon specifically 
cited Yeltsin's role ``in trying to reach out to a situation where 
Iraq's point of view gets promoted.''
