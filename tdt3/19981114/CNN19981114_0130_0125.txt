The independent counsel also has secured another indictment of presidential 
friend, Webster Hubbell. The former justice department official is 
accused of fraud, perjury and impeding an investigation by federal 
banking regulators into many allegations from the original Whitewater 
case. Hubbell served time in prison for defrauding the law firm where 
he worked with Hillary Rodham Clinton. His attorney says the independent 
counsel is unfairly targeting Hubbell in an effort to get to the president. 
It is wrong for a prosecutor to keep on indicting the same person 
over and over again in the hope that he may someday tell him something 
about his real quarry. There is simply too great a risk that a person 
under those circumstances will make something up in order to get away 
from further charges, and it is cruel and unfair to a person who has 
already told everything that he knows. In a statement released by 
the White House, the president and first lady say they are saddened 
by Hubbell's indictment.
