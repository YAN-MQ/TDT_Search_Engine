Serbs and ethnic Albanians alike are eagerly awaiting the arrival 
of thousands of international observers and aid workers to Kosovo. 
But cash _ not peace _ is foremost on most minds. ``I doubt the outsiders 
can establish lasting peace in Kosovo,'' said Gani Smajli, an unemployed 
French language teacher applying as a translator for the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ``But I know they'll be spending 
bucks and creating jobs.'' The OSCE is forming a 2,000-strong mission 
of unarmed verifiers of a U.S.-sponsored peace deal for Kosovo reached 
in October. The mission's budget is expected to be about dlrs 200 
million for one year. Much of that money will pay up to 6,000 locals 
as translators, drivers, secretaries and mechanics. Those wages and 
the additional money that foreigners are expected to spend while on 
Kosovo duty means better times for the Albanian-majority Serbian province 
that has always been Yugoslavia's poorest area. ``It's a great amount 
for this region, and the impact on the economy is going to be huge,'' 
said Duncan Bullivant, an OSCE spokesman in Kosovo's capital Pristina. 
Unemployment is hovering around 75 percent of the 1.3-million workforce, 
and average monthly salaries amount to no more than dlrs 50. The past 
months of destruction that have made hundreds of thousands of ethnic 
Albanians homeless have made traditional hard times worse. On Friday, 
Serb and Albanian stood front to back in long employment lines in 
front of the Pristina OSCE office. The prospect of a job shunted aside 
enmities _ at least for the time being. Some people hope the increasing 
foreign presence may boost long-term prospects for peace. ``The fresh 
influx of money and the creation of new jobs is certain to lead to 
the improving of the economy,'' said economist Muhamed Mustafa. ``This 
could eventually lead to people concentrating more on their living 
standards, and not on waging wars.'' Others are skeptical. ``Foreigners 
and their money cannot make us ... forgive,'' said a Zoran, a Serb 
hoping to get hired as a driver, even while conceding that well-paying, 
steady jobs could help ease hatreds. He would not give his last name. 
Since the crackdown on separatist Albanian guerrillas started in February, 
thousands of foreign diplomats, international aid workers and foreign 
journalists have descended on the drab and sleepy provincial capital. 
Their arrival has already made a huge difference for the local restaurant 
and hotel owners and made good translators and car mechanics sought 
after Agencies offering private accommodation have popped up for the 
first time. Pristina, which before the clashes offered a choice between 
huge portions of meat, Serb-style, or the more Mediterranean Albanian 
cuisine, now has a handful of restaurants serving good international 
cuisine. And the state-run Grand _ known among insiders as the world's 
worst five-star hotel, serving the world's worst breakfasts _ now 
has competition from several cozy private hostels. ``I can't argue: 
the clashes have brought me prosperity,'' said Faik Morina, the owner 
of the Hotel Dea, a popular residence for American diplomats, visiting 
U.S. senators and other public figures. Morina said that with foreigners 
pouring in, he plans to open a casino and a night club in his 20-room 
hotel. ``I may not know much about running hotels, but sure I know 
a lot about gambling and prostitution,'' Morina says. ``That's where 
the real money lies.'' Even the trademark Gypsy newspaper street vendors 
are trying to cash in _ with varying success. One of them, who identified 
himself only as Mehmet said his new sideline, selling English, Italian 
and French dailies, wasn't working out as well as he hoped. He shrugged, 
when told his problem _ the fact that his papers were weeks old. ``I 
noticed there was something wrong,'' he said. ``But I thought foreigners 
are big spenders, no matter what.''
