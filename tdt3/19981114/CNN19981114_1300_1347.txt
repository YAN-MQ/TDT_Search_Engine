In hockey last night, the stars and wings scrapped, pushed and battled, 
and when the dusty ice settled, Dallas beat Detroit for the second 
time this season with a 5-1 hammering. The canucks have outscored 
their opponents 20-9 in the third period, and last night, Anaheim 
was the victim. Vancouver won, 5-2. John MacLean took home a silver 
stick for playing in 1,000 NHL games. Plus, he drilled two goals in 
the rangers' 3-3 tie with Boston.
