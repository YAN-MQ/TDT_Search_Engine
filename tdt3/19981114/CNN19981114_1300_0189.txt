The husband of Paula Jones says his wife is "tickled to death" now 
that her sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton has been 
settled. Mr. Clinton has agreed to pay Jones $850,000 within 60 days. 
In exchange, Jones will drop her lawsuit. The deal does not include 
a presidential apology or admission of wrongdoing. On CNN's "Larry 
king live" last night, a former Clinton adviser said President Clinton 
has reason to welcome the deal. The president's gotten rid of something 
that's been around for four years, that's not true. He can move on. 
The underlying case, basically on the Lewinsky matter, is now done 
with. And I think the American people, whether they view it as guilty 
or innocence, they are just glad to be rid of this so they don't have 
to hear about it anymore. So I think for a president that's in the 
public light, that's a win. As part of the deal, the White House received 
written assurances the $1 million real estate investor abe hirschfeld 
offered Jones to settle the suit is "off the table." But sources tell 
CNN that does not legally prohibit Jones from receiving the money.
