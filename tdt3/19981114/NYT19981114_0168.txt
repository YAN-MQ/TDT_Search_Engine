Police are awaiting a medical examiner's report to determine what 
caused the death of Kenny Kirkland, the jazz pianist, who was found 
dead Friday morning in his home in Springfield Gardens, N.Y. Officers 
discovered Kirkland's body at 2:10 a.m. on Friday after neighbors 
reported an odor coming from the house he rented at 181-03 45th Avenue, 
in Queens County. The Daily News reported Saturday that drug paraphernalia 
had been found near the body, but police would not confirm that Saturday 
or discuss details of their investigation. Kirkland, who began playing 
piano at age 6 and studied at the Manhattan School of Music, was a 
much-sought-after session man in New York whose reputation was buoyed 
by stints in bands headed by Wynton and Branford Marsalis, Sting and 
the alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett. At the Iridium, a jazz club on 
63rd Street in Manhattan where Kirkland was featured, news of his 
death was greeted with shock. ``I'm so sorry to hear it,'' said Pinot, 
the club's assistant manager, who gave only his first name. ``He was 
a really great pianist.'' With Sting, Kirkland stepped away from jazz, 
recording several albums and traveling the world playing a blend of 
fused funk. Kirkland also had a short career on television as part 
of Branford Marsalis' ``Tonight Show'' band. When Marsalis left the 
show, Kirkland returned to his career in New York, playing in various 
jazz clubs. In August he appeared in the Panasonic Village Jazz Festival 
as part of Marsalis' jazz quartet. Reviewing the performance in The 
New York Times, the critic Ben Ratliff wrote, ``For a stretch toward 
the end of the set, the music was as funky as jazz gets these days, 
without changing genres altogether or resorting to a James Brown imitation.''
