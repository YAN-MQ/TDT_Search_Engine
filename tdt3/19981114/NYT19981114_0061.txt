In San Diego on Tuesday, two major drug companies rolled out studies 
showing the safety and effectiveness of a new class of prescription 
pain relievers; they had been duly tested on thousands of patients, 
some for up to a year. Such testing was a minimum requirement before 
the drugs could be prescribed to millions of Americans. If the Food 
and Drug Administration approves, the drugs can be sold. On the same 
day, the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association held 
a news conference in Washington to hail the publication of six papers 
``evaluating'' studies of alternative medical treatments. These treatments 
were already on the market. The studies came after the fact. The testing 
involved only dozens of patients and only weeks of trials. Yet these 
studies, which any large drug company would have considered tentative 
and inconclusive, were presented as resolving questions of safety 
and efficacy. An accompanying editorial, titled ``Alternative Medicine 
Meets Science,'' used decisive words like ``found,'' as in the study 
``found'' that moxibustion _ the burning of herbs to stimulate acupuncture 
points _ is helpful for breach pregnancy; that a particular treatment 
``is helpful'' for a medical condition; that researchers were able 
to ``document'' that a mixture of Chinese herbs ``improves symptoms 
of irritable bowel syndrome.'' Is there a double standard? One thing 
is sure: the issue has stirred up supporters and skeptics. Dr. Phil 
Fontanarosa, an editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association 
who helped write its editorial, said that ``the trials were all well 
done and the usual caveats were in place.'' The resulting news coverage 
was exuberant. But Fontanarosa said that was the result of interest 
in the topic. Exactly, said some critics of alternative medicine, 
who were stung by what they saw as an exaggeration of the importance 
of such modest studies. Double standard? ``Absolutely,'' said Dr. 
Richard Friedman, director of the psychopharmacology clinic at Cornell 
Hospital-New York Medical Center. With all the hoopla, the message 
that alternative treatments were still a scientific terra incognita 
got lost. ``The public will be sold'' on the notion that such treatments 
have passed muster, Friedman said. Dr. John Hathcock, the director 
of nutritional and regulatory science for the Council for Responsible 
Nutrition, argued that the double standard works the other way by 
hurting the vitamin and mineral industry. His group represents the 
dietary supplement industry. Hathcock said that an epidemiological 
study came out about a month ago linking folic acid in the diet with 
protection from colon cancer. ``I was talking with a high official 
at the National Cancer Institute, and he said, `That's very intriguing, 
we're very interested, but it needs to be confirmed with a clinical 
trial,''' Hathcock said. ``I said, `Give me a break. There is no risk, 
and the effective period is 15 years.''' A study is likely to take 
that long to assess the effects of folic acid on colon cancer rates. 
If a treatment has a low risk, the consumer does not have be as certain 
of the benefit in order to use it, said Dr. Stephen DeFelice, chairman 
of the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine in Cranford, N.J. With 
actual pharmaceuticals, ``we require more evidence because it is an 
unknown entity, an artificial molecule,'' he said. Drugs ``are not 
nature's way of handling disease,'' DeFelice added. Alternative medicine 
is different, he said. ``These things are not nearly as toxic as drugs,'' 
said DeFelice, adding that ``when we go for benefits, we accept less 
evidence.'' But that is not to say that most Americans are indifferent 
about evidence on whether alternative treatments work, said Lisa Meyer, 
a spokeswoman for the Council for Responsible Nutrition. ``People 
are hungry for additional information,'' she said. Critics of America's 
acceptance of alternative medicine trace it to the Dietary Supplement 
Health and Education Act of 1994, which enabled makers of supplements 
containing herbs, amino acids, botanical extracts, vitamins and minerals 
to sell them without the approval of the FDA. These companies also 
can claim benefits for their products _ without any supporting scientific 
studies. But unlike manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and devices, 
they are not required to report adverse effects to the agency. With 
no regulations forcing them to test for product safety, no protocol 
for tracking bad side effects and no requirement that products demonstrate 
effectiveness, the alternative medicine industry has been able to 
sidestep the rules of drug development. Critics like Dr. Allen Roses, 
a vice president at the drug company Glaxo Wellcome Inc., say that 
is inherently dangerous. If an alternative medicine company is selling 
its product as a substitute for a drug, they should show that it works 
and that its benefits outweigh its risks, said Roses, who questioned 
studies like those in the medical journal. One of those studies involved 
116 patients divided into three groups and studied for 14 weeks. Such 
a study, he said, cannot detect deleterious side effects that, as 
so often happens with drugs, occur only in a small percentage of people 
or only after people take the drug for a long time. ``If you are going 
to take anything, it should be based on efficacy and not on hope,'' 
Roses said. ``You are crushing people's hope by giving them a treatment 
that is not efficacious and implying it will be.'' The result has 
been a clash of two cultures, said Dr. William Wardell, the executive 
director of the Covance Institute for Drug Development Studies in 
Princeton, N.J. ``The culture for conventional medicine comes out 
of a history of fraud and disaster,'' he said. ``The presumption is 
that drugs are ineffective and unsafe unless they are proven to be 
effective and safe,'' he added. Alternative medicine's philosophy 
has been the presumption that treatments are safe and effective unless 
proven otherwise. Now, Wardell said, ``There is a confusion of gullibility 
with credibility.'' ``If sales go up from $2 million to $67 million, 
people say, `This proves it works,''' he said. ``If you can put yourself 
in the mind of a marketer, it's true. It works.''
