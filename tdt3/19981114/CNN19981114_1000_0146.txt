Pentagon officials say most of the B-52 bombers and F-117 stealth 
fighters that have been ordered to the Persian gulf will leave this 
weekend. The aircraft carrier "USS enterprise" already is on its way. 
Aram Roston reports, U.S. soldiers are finalizing their preparations 
and awaiting word from Washington. This one right here, take is right 
over here. This is today's date. This is your name and your signature. 
These are the final preparations for any soldiers before going overseas. 
Soldiers get to change their wills, straighten out their life insurance. 
They get their shots for infectious diseases and make sure they get 
a clean bill of health. All I should need right now is my Anthrax. 
In the spring the army began mandatory vaccination for Anthrax, a 
Deadly biological weapon. These 3,000 troops are expected to form 
part of a mechanized brigade on kuwait's border. They are traveling 
relatively lightly. They will use heavy combat equipment already in 
place in Kuwait. That means you don't have to take all your tanks, 
bradleys and howitzers over there. You fall in on them. You take the 
smaller pieces of equipment. One example is this laser designator, 
to guide smart bombs onto targets. It has a range of 10,000 meters, 
so it can be pointed across Kuwait's border into Iraqi territory. 
Then there are more routine supplies. Feeding 3,000 troops takes a 
lot of work. Most of the soldiers say they are confident. Some say 
they think the moment they head to the gulf is getting closer. A little 
nervous. Yeah. But gotta do it. I signed up for it. I'm gonna be fine. 
Many of these soldiers have been to the Middle East before. In fact, 
in February, a different group of soldiers from the same division 
was deployed to Kuwait during a similar crisis. Those troops waited 
then. And nine months later, these troops will continue preparations 
and waiting as well. Aram Roston, CNN, FT. Stewart, Georgia.
