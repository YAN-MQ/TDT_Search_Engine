More rain is causing more worries for people in southeast Texas. Residents 
along the San Jacinto river and creeks flowing into it are being asked 
to leave their homes. Eight inches of rain fell overnight. Some houses 
have as much as three feet of water in them. It's the second round 
of flooding in recent weeks. No injuries or deaths are reported.
