Updating now the situation in the gulf -- we now know that Iraq came 
within 30 minutes of a U.S. cruise missile launch order when it issued 
a letter this morning seeking a solution. Tonight, however, the White 
House said the letter is not enough and the military option is still 
very much alive. Military option -- the president has canceled a planned 
trip to Asia and will talk with allied nations before deciding on 
the next step. The U.S. military remains in a state of high readiness 
tonight. That readiness includes a number of military bases stateside 
where they're still shipping out this evening ready for action in 
the gulf, if called upon. From military bases all across the country, 
they are still heading to the Persian gulf prepared to wage war, if 
diplomacy can't ensure peace. An F-16 combat wing from South Carolina 
left this morning. Six heavy B-52 bombers leaving Louisiana today. 
3,000 army troops from Georgia are preparing to leave loved ones behind. 
This soldier is the mother of a 7-month-old. I'm going to miss her 
first walk, her first talking. So that's the hardest thing. Already 
in the region, 23 ships and enough planes to send more than 300 tomahawk 
missiles reigning down on specific targets in Iraq if that becomes 
necessary. The air force combat command center is sending a dozen 
5-15s from Virginia. This colonel is leaving a wife and two children 
behind. I know he's happy to be there. His guys are there. It sounds 
strange, but I'm happy for him that he gets to be there. But a new 
bride was tearful today, reflecting on separation during the holidays. 
I wish and I hope and I pray that he doesn't get into harm's way. 
But this is his job and he loves his job. The families know nothing 
can be taken for granted. Four crewmen headed to the gulf aboard board 
the aircraft carrier enterprise died Sunday while practicing landings. 
For military families, death is a fact of life. Monique braxton, NBC 
news, Hampton, Virginia.
