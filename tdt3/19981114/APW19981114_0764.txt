An Italian art expert is challenging the authenticity of a painting 
by Vincent Van Gogh that could fetch million of dollars when it goes 
on auction at Sotheby's in New York on Monday. The challenge comes 
in an article in the Nov. 18 issue of the Italian art magazine ``Quadri 
e Sculture'' (Paintings &AMP; Sculpture). The magazine provided an 
advance copy of the article by Antonio De Robertis, an expert on Van 
Gogh and one of several who have recently begun to question the authenticity 
of some of the works attributed to the Dutch painter. De Robertis 
was among those who have challenged the authenticity of the ``Sunflowers'' 
painting bought by the Yasuda Marine and Fire Insurance Co. for dlrs 
39.9 million for in 1987. In the ``Quadri e Sculture'' article, De 
Robertis says the painting in the Sotheby's auction, known as ``Les 
Chaumieres de Jorgus'' or ``Les Chaumieres a Auvers,'' is a forgery. 
The painting is part of the Reader's Digest collection, one of the 
most valuable corporate collections in the world. Monday's auction 
of the collection is one of the art world's most highly anticipated 
sales. De Robertis said ``Les Chaumieres de Jorgus'' was actually 
painted by Dr. Paul Gachet and his son, Paul Jr., from whose collection 
it came. Gachet cared for the troubled painter before his suicide 
in 1890 and Van Gogh gave him a number of paintings. A portrait of 
Dr. Gachet, not part of the family collection, sold in 1990 to a Japanese 
paper magnate for dlrs 82.5 million, a price that stunned the art 
world. De Robertis, 9th graf pvs
