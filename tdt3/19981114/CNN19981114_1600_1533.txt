In other royal birthday news, Britain's prince Charles is celebrating 
the big five-oh. Charles is spending the day with 250 guests. Yesterday, 
at a celebration in Sheffield, Charles recreated a scene from "The 
full Monty," a movie about male strippers. One difference, though, 
he kept his clothes on. One of the actors from the film said it looked 
like Charles had been practicing. Later, queen Elizabeth hosted a 
private party at Buckingham palace.
