The Iraqi government said Saturday it would allow U.N. weapons inspections 
to resume, a move that will likely avert a U.S. military attack. In 
a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq Aziz said Iraq would allow the work of inspectors from the U.N. 
Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency to resume 
at suspected weapons sites. ``To give an additional chance to achieve 
justice by lifting the embargo ... the leadership of Iraq has decided 
to resume cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA and to allow them to 
carry out their normal missions,'' Aziz said in the letter, read over 
Iraqi television. U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah earlier told a news 
conference in Baghdad that no conditions were mentioned in the letter, 
which was a response to a letter Annan sent Friday to Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein. Shah spoke to reporters minutes after conveying Aziz's 
letter to Annan. He said all Security Council members would receive 
copies. The Security Council was scheduled to meet Saturday afternoon. 
``They will have this letter before them,'' Annan said in New York. 
``They will decide what next to do.'' Asked whether the inspectors 
would return to Iraq, he replied: ``Once the issue is resolved, that's 
what I think should happen.'' Iraq's U.N. ambassador Nizar Hamdoon 
said the inspectors would be allowed to return immediately. ``They 
will be allowed any minute they want to to go back and to resume their 
normal work,'' he said in New York. ``From now on it's up to them 
to decide when to go back.'' Iraqi officials credited Russian and 
Chinese diplomacy for the decision to resume the inspections. President 
Clinton's national security team, meanwhile, met to assess the Iraqi 
promise. The United States, 12th graf
