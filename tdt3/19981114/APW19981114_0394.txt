Saying liberalized trade should not be an end in itself, Canadian 
officials announced Saturday they plan to propose a new task force 
to help humanize the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Canadian 
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said APEC needs to do more to consider 
the human impact of economic decisions and of its goal of free trade. 
He said Canada would propose the task force at a meeting Sunday of 
APEC trade and foreign ministers in Kuala Lumpur. The task force will 
propose ways that the 20-nation organization can work with citizen's 
groups to understand their concerns, he said. APEC should be aware 
of the ``very clear social, human impact'' from the region's currency 
crisis, Axworthy said. Earlier Saturday, Axworthy and Canadian trade 
minister Sergio Marchi visited a ``People's Summit'' organized by 
Malaysian and international citizens' groups that say APEC should 
consider human rights concerns. They met there with Azizah Ismail, 
the wife of jailed former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. 
Azizah expressed concerns about her husband's treatment in jail, and 
the Canadian officials passed on those comments to Malaysian Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, they said. Marchi said APEC countries 
``need to engage our respective peoples'' if they wish to achieve 
their goal of building an APEC community. ``Liberalized trade is not 
an end in itself, but a means to an end -- to improve people's lives,'' 
he said.
