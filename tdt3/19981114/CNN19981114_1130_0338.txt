Independent counsel Ken Starr has sent the house Judiciary committee 
two more boxes of information on his investigation of President Clinton. 
Sources say it may help the committee decide whether to include Kathleen 
willey's allegations in President Clinton's impeachment inquiry. Willey 
claims Mr. Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance outside the oval 
office. The president denies that. Starr is to testify at the impeachment 
hearings Thursday.
