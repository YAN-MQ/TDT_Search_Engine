Marie Schwartz is a working mom. When she comes home from her day 
as a marketing executive, she wants to spend time with her children. 
``And that's the worst time to start cooking,'' she says. That is 
why she enrolled her nanny in Sandy Failla's cooking class for nannies, 
one of those ingenious, improvised services that cater to the exotic 
needs of affluent suburbanites at the end of the 20th century. ``I 
found it least stressful if I delegated responsibility for cooking 
dinner to my nanny,'' Ms. Schwartz explained. ``I could find out about 
how school was and give my kids my full attention, as opposed to half 
my attention while I'm chopping carrots.'' The nanny has become the 
glue of upscale American life. Her presence allows husbands and wives 
to pursue ambitions in banking, corporate law and other industries 
in which the pay is as high as the workdays are long. A nanny also 
frees stay-at-home mothers for the full-time task of chauffeuring 
children to violin lessons, hockey games, tae kwon do classes and 
the other activities demanded of a child gearing up for the next millennium. 
When the nanny quits or even takes a day off, panic can ensue on the 
scale of, say, a bankruptcy or a divorce. In fact, a nanny's departure 
can lead to bankruptcy or divorce. That is why suburban couples prosperous 
enough to fix most everyday discomforts make sure their nannies are 
content and up to speed. They pay for driving lessons, college classes, 
immigration lawyers. They equip nannies with beepers and cell phones. 
Paying for Mrs. Failla's cooking classes, which cost $440 for instruction 
in making chicken cutlets, meatballs and advanced sauces, has a self-interested 
motive. Nannies are hired for their way with children, not their casseroles. 
But for families who can afford to be choosy, cooking for the grown-ups 
as well as the kids often becomes part of the job. Some nannies have 
a limited repertoire; others know Polish or Caribbean dishes that 
American kids may not fancy. Traci Bentzen, Ms. Schwartz's nanny, 
is a vegetarian working for meat eaters. For such problems, Mrs. Failla, 
a spirited woman of 39, comes to the rescue. Having tabled a nursing 
career, she knows of the pressures on moms, because she spends afternoons 
ferrying her own three children to Brownie groups and play dates. 
``Unless you put a kitchen in a car, you won't have dinner on the 
table as a suburban mom,'' says Mrs. Failla, who also holds classes 
for moms. So at 9:30 a.m., Mrs. Failla is in her home kitchen in Scarsdale 
showing four nannies how to make minestrone, Tuscan bread soup, lentil 
soup and chicken broth with tortellini. She tells these immigrants 
from Poland, Guyana and Colombia that ``the Italian meal is like a 
communion _ it's where the family gets together.'' Her lessons are 
sprinkled with ideas for happy meals for children, who she notes can 
be particular about color and texture. ``Just when you get them eating 
tomato sauce, they decide they don't like bread,'' she said. She also 
provides culinary tips: _ Wash spinach well. ``You can get a whole 
sandbox out of it,'' she says. _ Use canned tomatoes in the winter. 
``Fresh tomatoes tend to be on the cardboard-tasting side.'' _ Don't 
use measuring cups. ``You use a handful of this and a handful of that 
and you will get a beautiful soup,'' she says. The nannies listen 
quietly, respectfully, as if they were at the feet of a Zen master. 
One asks shyly what she might substitute for bacon since her employers 
lean toward kosher. When the cooking is done, the nannies join Mrs. 
Failla around her dining table, consuming cupfuls of each soup. Afterward, 
with the ingrained habit of nannies, they clear the table. One nanny, 
Janice Levene, a Trinidadian, is delighting her husband in New York 
City with chicken cotolette. Another, who wants to be nameless, can't 
use the lessons just yet for her own children; they are back in Guyana. 
But most of the nannies are happy to use their new cooking skills 
just for the busily successful families that they hold together here.
