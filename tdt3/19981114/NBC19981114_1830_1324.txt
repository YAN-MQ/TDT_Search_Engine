Now to the movement to make capital punishment tougher to impose. 
In Chicago this weekend, a conference attended by 30 people who were 
wrongly sentenced to death. Here's NBC's Anne Thompson. Dale Johnston 
arrives at a conference that, for him, is a matter of life and death. 
After you execute a guy, what do you say? Oops? He's one of 75 people 
wrongly sentenced to death and now free. The flesh and blood reasons 
why 1,500 people, most death penalty critics, are in Chicago this 
weekend to discuss reforms. We either have to re-evaluate it or say 
we don't care. Mistakes law professor Lawrence Marshall says happen 
in part because poor defendants in capital cases often get bad legal 
representation. We have lawyers that are overworked, who are very 
often inexperienced and were given no resources to try, and most importantly, 
to investigate the case. And that is number one on the reforms that 
have to be implemented. Other reforms being considered here include 
videotaping all interrogations to ensure suspects are not tortured 
or coerced into confessions and making sure there's enough time between 
conviction and execution to examine claims of innocence. But some 
victims right's advocates fear reforms are the first steps to abolishing 
the death penalty. They parade people who have been erroneously convicted, 
but they don't talk about people who have been erroneously released 
from death row, that have gone on to murder other people. Dennis Williams 
would argue that because he sat on death row for a murder he didn't 
commit. The real killer, now in prison, took at least one more life, 
and the system almost took his. I'm an example. And I'm not the only 
example that the death penalty is dangerous. What they hope to come 
up with in Chicago is a way to eliminate mistakes. Anne Thompson, 
NBC news, Chicago.
