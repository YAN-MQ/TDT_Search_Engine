It's been two weeks since hurricane Mitch tore through central America. 
But the red cross says it is struggling to deliver aid to hundreds 
of communities still cut off by the devastation. Relief workers say 
the storm has destroyed much of the infrastructure in honduras and 
Nicaragua. Roads are covered by layers of thick mud and bridges are 
washed out, making it difficult to distribute emergency supplies. 
Most are being flown in by helicopter.
