The U.N. security council will discuss the looming confrontation when 
it meets again Saturday. U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan is sending 
Baghdad a letter that urges iraq to let weapons inspections resume. 
Annan warns the appeal may have little effect, but Iraq's ambassador 
to the United Nations says a diplomatic solution could ease the crisis. 
Let me say that I've had a very constructive and useful discussions 
with council members. All stress the desirability of a peaceful and 
diplomatic solution, but events on the ground may be running away 
from us. I don't know. We still hope that there will be a diplomatic 
solution. It doesn't look like that the U.S. is ready for a diplomatic 
outcome, according to our reading, but we are still hopeful for some 
chance will be given to diplomacy and diplomacy as we understand it 
does now dictate. The Americans cannot dictate on Iraqi something 
and then talk about giving diplomacy a chance, let them give diplomacy 
a real chance.
