For 38 years, Thomas Jefferson had a secret. Her name was Sally hemmings. 
Science has affirmed their relationship. But as Jim hill reports, 
it can tell us nothing of love or lust. I'm going to have you put 
your names on there. Chino hills, California, teacher Mary Jefferson 
knows what can be found in a name. Scientists have found she is among 
an interesting group of Americans. Thomas Jefferson is my great, great, 
great grandfather. Researchers say DNA analysis proves a long-simmering 
controversy that the nation's founding father fathered a son with 
Sally hemmings, one of his slaves. I've told people for years that 
I'm related to Sally hemmings. That was a given. Probably by Thomas 
Jefferson, that was the question. The theory was written about extensively 
by historian fawn brody in 1974. How Jefferson, after his wife Martha 
died, began a relationship with hemmings, a mixed-race slave at Jefferson's 
Monticello home. It was, first of all, an enduring relationship -- 
38 years. UCLA professor Gary Nash has written a book about mixed-race 
america, and says such a secret relationship was not unusual. I think 
it's a perfect example of how people thought about race in one way 
and condemned interracial mixing while at the same time practicing 
it. And it means people like Colby Jefferson boggs now know they are 
descendants of slaves. For me, it's been nothing but positive remarks 
and comments from friends and family. It has peen wonderful. They 
are just as proud that I am descended from Sally hemmings as that 
I am descended from Thomas Jefferson. But the issue challenges history's 
view of Jefferson. In the declaration of independence, he wrote that 
all men are created equal. Yet he held slaves. He was involved with 
hemmings, yet he lied about it. Which raises the question, was their 
relationship really loving, or was if forced? DNA analysis may have 
uncovered new facts about American history. But it cannot answer questions 
that only Jefferson and hemmings would know. And it can't be a guide 
how people will react to this new page of history. Jim hill, CNN, 
Los Angeles.
