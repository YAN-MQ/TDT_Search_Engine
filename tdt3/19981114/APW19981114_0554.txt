NANTES, France (AP) - Stephane Glas scored two fine tries as France 
made a solid but unspectacular start to its World Cup preparations 
with a hard-fought 34-14 win over Argentina on Saturday. Though France's 
victory was not in doubt after it scored two tries late in the first 
half, only two more tries in the last five minutes set up the convincing 
winning margin. The Five Nations champion, fielding 12 professionals 
to Argentina's five, had to wait until the 26th minute for its first 
try. With the scores tied at 3-3, Philippe Carbonneau collected a 
10-yard (meter) pass from David Aucagne and stormed 30 yards (meters) 
down the touchline to score in the corner. Aucagne kicked a superb 
conversion to make the score 10-3. Glas, the 25-year-old Bourgoin 
center, scored the first of his two tries in the 39th minute, when 
he charged through two tackles to score between the posts. But the 
Pumas fought back, and number eight Pablo Camerlinckx scored a try 
to make it 17-8 at halftime. Glas capped a brilliant five-pass French 
move to score a try in the 52nd minute. Though Argentina dominated 
second-half possession, it had few try-scoring opportunities, and 
conceded another try in the 87th minute when Philippe Bernat-Salles 
capped a strong run to score. With the last move of the match, Franck 
Comba scored after an error by the Argentine backs. Aucagne kicked 
three conversions and a penalty for France, while Argentine fly half 
Lisandro Arbizu kicked two penalties. France takes on Australia next 
Saturday in another test match in preparation match for the 1999 World 
Cup.
