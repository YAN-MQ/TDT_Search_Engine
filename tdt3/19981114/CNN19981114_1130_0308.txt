Sometime within the next 60 days, Paula Jones will receive $850,000 
from President Clinton to drop her lawsuit against him. Under the 
deal reached yesterday Mr. Clinton admits no wrongdoing in the case. 
As part of the agreement, the White House received written assurances 
that the $1 million real estate investor abe hirschfeld offers Jones 
to settle the suit is "off the table." But sources tell CNN it does 
not legally prohibit Jones from receiving the money.
