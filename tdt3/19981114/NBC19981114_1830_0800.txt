Big trouble to report tonight on the fourth most populous nation in 
the world. Our report tonight from NBC's donatella lorch. Indonesia's 
year of living dangerously is far from over. Today mobs rampaged through 
the streets -- breaking into shops, stealing anything they could. 
The army, outnumbered, shot in the air. A different scene from last 
night when soldiers opened fire on thousands of student protesters 
killing at least 11 and hunting down unarmed demonstrators. We only 
have stones. We don't have bullets. We have no protection. a week 
of student-led protests is spiralling into mass unrest. It is the 
worst violence since may when riots forced President Suharto to resign 
after 32 years of authoritarian rule. On the streets, the long simmering 
student anger has taken on a momentum of its own. The students accuse 
Suharto's successor, President Habibie, of stalling on political reforms 
and are calling for his resignation. Today, President Habibie ordered 
troops to crack down on protesters. "The people taking action are 
doing so unlawfully and against the interests of the country," he 
said. But the threat of more violence didn't stop the protesters. 
They prayed in front of troops and tried to convince them, at times 
successfully, to join their ranks. And as looters ransacked stores, 
thousands gathered to mourn their dead. Students still demanding that 
the government adopt democratic reforms immediately. Donatella lorch, 
NBC news.
