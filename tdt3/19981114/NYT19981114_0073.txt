The vultures wasted no time. ``A couple guys said, if you do start 
to look, they have interest,'' Frank Cashen said. ``They are all decent 
people,'' Cashen, the Mets' interim general manager, quickly added. 
But only vultures and opportunists would get in line for the Mets' 
general manager's job while the general manager is on a secluded leave 
of absence and the Mets are still reeling from the disclosure of his 
extramarital affairs. ``I don't know anybody who wasn't blindsided,'' 
Fred Wilpon said. ``But we have to go on from here. I'm not one to 
stay in that kind of state.'' If Wilpon and his co-owner, Nelson Doubleday, 
were the kind of people who couldn't rebound from adverse developments, 
they would have plunged into a catatonic state long ago. The Mets, 
in the past decade or so, have encountered enough nasty incidents 
to wipe out less resilient people. The Yankees, during the reign of 
George 3d, have long produced their own sort of soap opera, but the 
general theme has been more owner-generated: George vs. Billy, George 
vs. Reggie, George and Howie vs. Dave _ that kind of running warfare. 
The Mets have created their own problems, too, but they are far more 
serious than someone saying, ``The two of them deserve each other; 
one's a born liar, the other's convicted.'' Firecrackers, drugs, alcohol, 
child abuse and rape have been the themes of the Mets' problems. To 
their credit, the Mets keep trying to erase and rise above the taint, 
to fix the image, but like an overmatched boxer, as soon as they get 
up, they get knocked down again. This was going to be a wonderfully 
positive off season for the Mets. They had a good season, even if 
it had a disappointing climax, and they challenged the Yankees for 
attention early in the off season by re-signing Mike Piazza and Al 
Leiter. More signings and trades were to come in the club's plans 
to take the extra step next season. Then came the shocking, though 
reluctant, revelations of Steve Phillips. Granted, the effect of his 
confessions of extramarital affairs, in real life, is more painful 
for his family and for his career, but the Mets obviously suffer from 
the fallout. ``Based on what I have heard from the fans in terms of 
people I see,'' Wilpon said, ``recognizing they might not tell me 
what they would tell you, what I hear on radio, read in newspapers, 
see on television, it's a very tragic story, but I don't think it's 
such a cloud in the sense that people aren't interested in talking 
about the baseball now.'' The debate over Bobby Bonilla's return, 
the owner said, is good for the Mets. Until Bonilla shows up in the 
lineup every day, no one will know whether he will produce, but last 
week's trade has fans chattering. ``I can't predict what's going to 
happen,'' said Wilpon, a Bonilla believer. ``He's a different guy. 
He has the strongest desire I've ever heard about not ending his career 
without making it in New York. That's motivation. I have high regard 
for what he has left. I think he will be an important addition to 
this club.'' Wilpon, who has seen major off-season moves backfire 
before, acknowledged that bringing Bonilla back is a calculated risk, 
but he believes Bonilla has another motivating factor working in his 
behalf. ``He has one wonderful, smart and strong-willed wife,'' Wilpon 
said of Millie Bonilla. ``She loves Greenwich, where they live. She's 
ecstatic. She wants to be here. They want to be here. It makes a difference. 
He's going to live in Greenwich when he's through playing. So he has 
a lot of motivation.'' Whoever else joins Bonilla on next season's 
team _ B.J. Surhoff, Brian Jordan, Robin Ventura, Eric Young, Darren 
Dreifort, Armando Benitez, Arthur Rhodes _ the Mets should be part 
of the wild-card race. More they cannot expect. They still play in 
the same division as the Atlanta Braves. ``If I had my guess,'' Wilpon 
said, ``we're going to be able to improve our relief pitching and 
power. I don't know if we'll be able to improve our speed by having 
a leadoff hitter, although it's a possibility. I think we'd have a 
shot at improving our starting pitching.'' Wilpon, however, chose 
not to express his thought on the future of Phillips and the team's 
general manager job. ``I really don't want to get into that now,'' 
he said, ``for legal reasons and for people's emotional reasons.'' 
A baseball lawyer lamented Phillips' plight. Firmly believing that 
Phillips will not return from his leave of absence to be general manager 
of the Mets again, he said: ``It's a shame. If they banished every 
baseball person who messed around, you couldn't put together a league, 
let alone two.''
