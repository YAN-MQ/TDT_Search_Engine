Call it ``No Exit,'' the Capitol's own existentialist drama. The American 
public has signaled that it wants the drive to impeach President Clinton 
to end. So do most House Democrats. So do many Republicans. Yet the 
Republicans and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have such 
a strange synergy that they just cannot seem to stop egging each other 
on and on and on. Take the dispute over which witnesses should appear 
before the committee as it examines Clinton's relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky and whether he lied about it in various legal proceedings. 
Last month, it was the Democrats who first said they were interested 
in casting the spotlight on Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to pose 
tough questions to perhaps the most unpopular man in America on the 
conduct of his investigation. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the committee 
chairman, obliged _ with a twist. Days after House Democrats made 
gains in mid-term elections, he announced a scaled-back impeachment 
inquiry that would feature Starr not simply as one of the major witnesses, 
but as the only one. Republicans are hoping Starr's appearance Thursday 
will backfire on the Democrats, with the prosecutor making a compelling 
case against Clinton. Setting the stage last week, Starr sent more 
evidence to the committee, this time concerning allegations by Kathleen 
Willey, a former White House volunteer. But Democrats on the committee 
are now protesting that it is unfair to question only the prosecutor 
and bring forward no witnesses who might rebut him. So some Republicans 
are now looking to add other major witnesses like deputy White House 
counsel Bruce Lindsey, a long-time confidant of Clinton. Before the 
Nov. 3 election, this kind of point-counterpoint had some political 
utility. Republicans and Democrats alike were trying to use the Clinton 
scandal to rev up their core voters and send them to the polls. Now 
that the people have spoken, pragmatism might dictate that the committee 
find a graceful exit from its inquiry. But packed with hard-line conservatives 
and liberals, the committee has always been one of the most ideologically 
divided in the House. And the impeachment inquiry has only ratcheted 
up the tensions and manuevering. ``There's very little middle in the 
Judiciary Committee,'' sighed Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., a moderate 
not on the panel. So Hyde and his Republicans seem grimly determined 
to push on and charge Clinton with undermining the nation's legal 
system. And the Democrats do not intend to help them. House Minority 
Leader Dick Gephardt said last week that even though he wanted the 
inquiry brought to an end, that did not mean he would not criticize 
it as slipshod and flawed. ``Otherwise,'' he said, ``you get accused 
of being complicit with this whole thing and liking it and saying 
its fine and putting on the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. I'm 
not going to do that.''
