"The New York Times" reports the United States tried to kill osama 
bin laden during air strikes over Afghanistan in August. Bin laden 
is considered the mastermind behind the bombings of two U.S. embassies 
in east Africa. The paper claims Clinton administration officials 
timed the cruise missile attack on bin laden's camps when they thought 
he was there. Bin laden is believed to have left the camp the day 
before.
