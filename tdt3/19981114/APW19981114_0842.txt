The U.N. Security Council meets Saturday to consider Iraq's offer 
to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to return to Iraq, but questions 
were immediately raised on whether it was unconditional. U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan said Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz assured him 
that Iraq's decision was unconditional _ and that a controversial 
annex attached to the letter ``was for our consideration and there 
were no conditions.'' And Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon reiterated 
Saturday evening that Iraq had unconditionally decided to allow the 
immediate resumption of work by the U.N. Special Commission, known 
as UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating its weapons of mass destruction. 
Hamdoon said the annex to the letter only contained Iraq's points 
of view and preferences, ``but they are by no means conditions.'' 
``Our unequivocal statement has been that Iraq is restoring its ties 
with UNSCOM and they are welcome to go anytime they want from now 
on to Iraq. And that's very much unconditional,'' he said earlier 
as he left his New York residence. But British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair said in London that Iraq must state categorically that the nine 
points in the annex, which are also mentioned in the letter, are not 
conditions. ``They cannot be conditions _ and what we all must be 
very sure of is that the Iraqi position has to be unconditional, not 
hedged,'' Blair said. ``The compliance must be immediate and it must 
be unconditional.'' Later, when Annan arrived at the United Nations, 
he was somewhat more cautious. ``I think at least they've made a step 
in the right direction, and as I indicated this morning, it's a positive 
development. But the council may want further clarifications.''
