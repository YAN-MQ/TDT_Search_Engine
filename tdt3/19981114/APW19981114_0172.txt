Uzbekistan's government denounced a Tajik claim that it trained rebels 
responsible for anti-government raids inside Tajikistan, an official 
said Saturday. Tajikistan President Emomali Rakhmonov's claim that 
Uzbekistan helped the rebels is ``an emotional and rash act which 
can lead to serious complications and national confrontation,'' the 
Uzbek foreign ministry said in a statement, according to Uzbekistan's 
ambassador to Tajikistan. Rakhmonov's allegations came in the wake 
of several days of fighting in Tajikistan, which neighbors Uzbekistan 
in Central Asia. The rebels were defeated and chased into northern 
mountainous regions, near the two former Soviet republics' border. 
Rakhmonov claimed the rebels had not only fled into Uzbekistan, but 
had been receiving training and assistance there for this and previous 
anti-government raids. Ambassador Bakhtior Urdashev said the claim 
was ``unacceptable and unfounded,'' and caused ``deep bewilderment 
among the Uzbek government and public.'' Uzbekistan offered its help 
to Tajikistan to conduct an investigation to ``make sure the statement 
of the Tajik authorities is groundless,'' the foreign ministry statement 
said. Tajikistan officials say that 120 people were killed during 
the fighting, and more than 600 injured. The former Soviet republics 
in Central Asia _ Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakstan and 
Turkmenistan _ generally enjoy good relations, and the dispute marks 
a rare public disagreement between regional leaders.
