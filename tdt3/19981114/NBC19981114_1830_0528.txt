If any of this seems familiar, that is because the U.S. has been at 
this very brink, with this very leader, several times before. NBC's 
Rick Davis on how we got here this time. This was Saddam Hussein's 
version of the scorched-earth policy. His army in rapid retreat had 
set aflame the oil fields of Kuwait. But the army was not finished. 
Within weeks it moved against Kurdish forces seeking independence 
in northern Iraq and against rebelling Shiites in the south. No-fly 
zones were established to protect them from Iraq air attacks. In 1993 
U.S. and allied forces struck twice. In January, missiles hit military 
targets, when Saddam threatened allied planes patrolling the no-fly 
zones. And in June after an alleged plot to assassinate former President 
George bush in Kuwait, the U.S. launched 23 cruise missiles, damaging 
a Baghdad intelligence facility. Meanwhile, U.N. inspectors kept finding 
Saddam storage facilities for chemical and biological weapons and 
blowing them up. But complaints mounted that Iraq was hiding or moving 
sites. In 1994 and 1995 U.S. forces again mobilized in the gulf, when 
Saddam moved troops toward Kuwait. Both times he withdrew. In 1996, 
when Iraqi military attacked Kurdish forces in the north. 44 cruise 
missiles hit Iraqi military sites. The job of U.N. inspectors, especially 
Americans, got harder. At this site the welcome had exceptions. Provided 
that you do not include American individuals in the inspection. If 
you forbid the Americans, I must consider that a technical refusal 
to visit the site. Last February, military action was averted by this 
handshake and a pledge from Saddam -- inspectors could work unhampered. 
But then last month, Saddam said no further inspections. The U.N. 
teams left Baghdad, followed by another buildup and the latest move 
by Saddam to avoid attack. If it works -- Saddam cheats. He retreats. 
He cheats. He retreats. We ought not to be surprised when it happens 
again. To his people, Saddam is a hero outwitting Americans surviving 
for eight years. Today he is trying to play the role again. Rick Davis, 
NBC news.
