Oman's defense minister arrived in Iran on Saturday for talks on military 
cooperation, Tehran radio reported. Bader Alareb Al Busaidi told his 
Iranian counterpart, Ali Shamkhani, that the two states could expand 
their defense and political relations, the radio reported. Turning 
to the current crisis between the United Nations and Iraq, Shamkhani 
reiterated that Iran was opposed to military strikes on Iraq but believed 
that the Baghdad government should comply with U.N. Security Council 
resolutions on eliminating weapons of mass destruction. Oman has close 
ties with Iran and relations have improved since Iran's President 
Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate, took office last year. Tehran 
has often expressed an interest in military cooperation with Gulf 
countries, but none has ever participated in the military exercises 
that Iran holds each year.
