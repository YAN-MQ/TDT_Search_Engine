The parents of a blond boy mistakenly identified as possibly missing 
Briton Ben Needham have asked for police protection, reports said 
Saturday. Greek media said the parents of 7-year-old Savvas Skilarakis 
went to police in this holiday island to seek extra surveillance for 
their family. The request was apparently in fear that someone could 
snatch the boy believing him to be Ben, who disappeared in 1991. But 
the boy's identity has been confirmed by the doctor who delivered 
him, reports said. A British tourist took a photograph of Savvas, 
the youngest of four brothers, which appeared in Britain's Sun newspaper 
this week. The tourist said he believed Savvas resembled Ben. The 
tourist also took a strand of the boy's hair for DNA tests in Britain. 
Ben Needham vanished on the island of Kos, near Rhodes, when he was 
19-months-old in July 1991. He disappeared from a playground on the 
island, where the family had a holiday home. Police in England have 
issued computer-generated pictures of how he might look today. A reward 
of more than dlrs 650,000 was also offered in 1996 for information 
on his whereabouts.
