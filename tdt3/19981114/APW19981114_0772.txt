Francisco Clavet of Spain and Younes El Eynaoui of Morroco both scored 
straight-set victories Saturday and advanced to the final of the 320,000 
dollar Chevrolet Cup. El Eynaoui defeated Felix Mantilla of Spain 
6-4, 6-4 in a match played under a scorching sun at the San Carlos 
stadium in the Santiago's Andes foothills. Later, Clavet rode the 
cheers of the local fans over Juan Antonio Marin of Costa Rica 6-2, 
7-5. The crowd was clearly partisan for Clavet after Marin upset local 
hero Marcelo Rios in the quarterinals Friday. The defeat not only 
eliminated Rios from his hometown tournament for the first time, but 
also detrailed his hopes of recovering the No. 1 ATP Tour ranking 
this week.
