An Iraqi opposition group alleged Saturday that a son and a cousin 
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein have executed 150 people during 
the past two weeks. The president's younger son, Qusai, and Ali Hassan 
al-Majid, a cousin and former defense minister, ``have carried out 
new violent acts against the citizens of al-Amara province, by directly 
executing 150 people arrested during the past two weeks,'' the Supreme 
Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq said. The allegation could 
not be independently verified and the Iraqi government usually does 
not respond to such accusations. It was not clear if the report was 
in any way linked the atmosphere of crisis in Iraq due to Baghdad's 
defiance of U.N. efforts to monitor its weapons programs and the threat 
of U.S. military strikes to compel Baghdad to comply. Iraq announced 
Saturday that it would allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume their 
work, which could defuse that crisis. The Iranian-based dissident 
group said the Iraqi armed forces have been attacking villages where 
rebels were thought to be hiding in the southern provinces of Basra 
and al-Amara. Qusai, who heads the president's special security unit, 
has been moving around southern Iraq and has met with al-Majid several 
times, the council said in a statement faxed to Cairo. Al-Majid had 
ordered three persons to be hanged from a bridge in al-Amara, the 
statement said. The former defense minister also executed dozens of 
army defectors in Basra province, the dissidents said. Southern Iraq 
is a hotbed of opposition to Saddam's government. Immediately after 
the 1991 Gulf War, the residents of Basra city staged an uprising 
that was put down by government forces.
