Lacresha Murray is a 14-year-old prisoner at the Giddings State Home 
and School in Giddings, Texas, about 60 miles east of Austin, the 
state capital. She is serving a term of 25 years after being found 
guilty in 1996 of criminally negligent homicide and injury to a child 
in the death of a 2{-year-old girl named Jayla Belton. The case was 
a local sensation. Excited prosecutors and other law-enforcement officials 
stumbled over one another in their rush to portray Lacresha, just 
11 years old, as a juvenile monster, a homicidal maniac who attacked 
Jayla and inflicted a savage beating, eventually breaking four of 
her ribs and rupturing her liver. The medical examiner said the injuries 
were like those that might result if a person went through the windshield 
in a high-speed car accident. Prosecutors referred to Lacresha in 
private as ``La Creature.'' Lacresha was convicted twice (the first 
verdict was overturned), but a close look at the case shows that she 
was the victim of a colossal miscarriage of justice. She remains trapped 
in a Texas-sized nightmare, a naive child with learning difficulties 
who was tricked into signing a confession she could barely read and 
surely didn't understand. Prosecutors ignored evidence that Jayla 
had long been the victim of child abuse. There was no legitimate evidence 
against Lacresha. None. No witnesses, no forensic evidence _ not so 
much as a drop of blood or a speck of body fluid of any kind. Twenty 
or more police officers scoured the premises where she supposedly 
killed the child. They found nothing. Jayla had been dropped off on 
the morning of May 24, 1996, at a small, one-family house in Austin 
where Lacresha lived with three siblings and their grandparents, R.L. 
and Shirley Murray. Ms. Murray provided day care for Jayla and a number 
of other children. But Jayla's mother, Judy Belton, and her boyfriend, 
Derrick Shaw, had been told not to bring the child on May 24 because 
Ms. Murray would be away. Shaw dropped the baby off anyway. According 
to the Murrays and a number of people who visited the house that day, 
Jayla was clearly ill. She was listless, refused to eat, perspired 
profusely and was vomiting. In the early evening, the Murrays said, 
Lacresha noticed that the baby was ``shaking real bad.'' In fact, 
the child had gone into convulsions. R.L. Murray and Lacresha rushed 
the child to a hospital, but frantic efforts to save her failed. Enter 
the Austin police. The medical examiner is reported to have told investigators 
that no one could survive more than 15 minutes with a ruptured liver. 
The investigators, still without a suspect, took that to mean there 
was a good chance that the last person seen with the child was the 
killer. Lacresha had carried Jayla into the hospital. The cops zeroed 
in on her. Lacresha was kept away from her family for four days and 
finally was subjected to a lengthy police interrogation, without the 
benefit of a lawyer. An officer ran through what was surely to her 
an incomprehensible reading of her rights, after which he said: ``You've 
heard them before, on TV shows probably, huh?'' Lacresha insisted 
she had done nothing harmful to Jayla. ``Why would I want to hurt 
a child?'' she asked. The cops told her that a doctor, ``with over 
20 years of experience,'' had said the baby died at precisely the 
time that Lacresha said she noticed the baby was shaking. ``I didn't 
do nothing,'' Lacresha replied. ``I promise to God.'' The interrogation 
was a travesty. Unable to shake her protestations of innocence, the 
police finally resorted to asking if it were at least ``possible'' 
that Lacresha had dropped the baby, or even kicked her. She was told, 
``We're going to stay here until you tell us the truth.'' Isolated 
and without a lawyer's help, Lacresha eventually said that the suggestions 
made by the interrogators were possible, even ``probable.'' She developed 
a fantastic scenario that could in no way account for the injuries 
Jayla suffered. But it was enough for the police. A confession was 
typed up. Lacresha was asked, ``Can you read pretty good?'' ``No,'' 
she said, ``but I try hard.'' As she read over her ``confession,'' 
Lacresha asked the officers, ``What's that word? Home-a-seed?'' When 
she was told that the word was ``homicide,'' she asked, ``What's that?'' 
No one answered.
