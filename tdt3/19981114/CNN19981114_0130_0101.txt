Independent counsel Ken Starr has sent the house Judiciary committee 
two more boxes of information on his investigation of President Clinton. 
Sources say it may help the committee decide whether to include Kathleen 
willey's allegations in President Clinton's impeachment inquiry. Willey 
claims Mr. Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance outside the oval 
house. The president denies that. Starr is scheduled to testify at 
the impeachment hearings Thursday.
