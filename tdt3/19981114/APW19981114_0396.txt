Five people aboard a Japan Transocean Air domestic flight suffered 
light injuries Saturday after it maneuvered to avoid an approaching 
aircraft, local media reported. The Tokyo-bound Boeing 737 took off 
from Miyakojima Island, near the southern island of Okinawa, shortly 
before 7:00 p.m. (10:00 GMT) and shook violently in mid-flight as 
it avoided another plane, national broadcaster NHK and Kyodo News 
Agency reported. Airport police, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
confirmed that the injured were taken to a hospital after the plane 
landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport, but would not provide other details. 
Airline officials were not available for comment. The transport ministry 
was reportedly investigating the incident. The plane was carrying 
28 passengers and five crew, Kyodo said. No other details were immediately 
available.
