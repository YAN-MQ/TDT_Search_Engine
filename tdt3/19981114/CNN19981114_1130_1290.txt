Well, Tennessee has a big one today, but last night, the men's basketball 
team had a battle of its own at the bca classic in New Mexico. The 
number nine Vols were trailing 18th-ranked Arizona by one with time 
winding down but could not get the shot to fall. Arizona won, 73-72. 
Meanwhile, 20th-ranked New Mexico took this missed free throw by DePaul 
with time winding down, and Lamont long raced the other way for the 
game-winning layup. New Mexico walks away an 82-81 winner. And number 
eight Kansas shook off some rust to beat Gonzaga, 80-66, and win their 
61st straight game at home.
