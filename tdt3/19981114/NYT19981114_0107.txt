Donald Sterling, the principal owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, 
cannot understand why David Stern is being portrayed as the villain 
by National Basketball Association players in the league's labor dispute. 
``We call him Easy Dave,'' Sterling said of the NBA commissioner. 
``I don't think Stern would ever take advantage of anybody. I think 
he wants to leave something on the table for everyone. I have my own 
ideas, and they're not consistent with Stern's.'' He added: ``I think 
some owners feel that since we create and make the game and put up 
the seat money and take all the risk, that perhaps we should get a 
more equitable distribution of the revenue. Stern is going soft on 
them.'' Sterling's conservative bent appears to be shared by at least 
some of his peers, although they have lined up behind Stern and Russ 
Granik, the deputy commissioner, in the standoff with the league's 
400-plus players. While union leaders, agents and players have traded 
verbal attacks with Stern and Granik the past few months, the owners 
have remained conspicuously voiceless. Discouraged from talking publicly 
about negotiations _ Stern has threatened fines of up to $1 million 
and the loss of draft picks _ the owners have remained mostly mum. 
But several principal NBA owners broke their silence last week when 
asked about the dispute. Frustrated over stalled talks, they were 
firm in their resolve to cancel the entire 1998-99 season if a settlement 
cannot be reached. ``We're prepared to gut the season,'' said Abe 
Pollin, the chairman of the Washington Wizards and the league's senior 
owner. ``We went into this knowing that if we can't make a fair deal, 
the season would be gone.'' Jerry Colangelo, the owner of the Phoenix 
Suns, said: ``When you have two sides that have deep resolve, something 
either gives or it doesn't give. I love the game, but not at the price 
of another mistake.'' The owners are seeking to overhaul an agreement 
that paid the players 57.1 percent of revenues last season. The contract 
allowed owners to renegotiate if the players' share reached 51.8 percent. 
While the league has offered a 50-50 split, the players want to be 
allowed as much as 60 percent of revenues. With that 10 percent chasm, 
the two sides have not held a bargaining session since Nov. 6. A marathon 
negotiation on Oct. 28 was perceived to be the closest that owners 
and players have come to reaching a deal, but since then momentum 
has died. ``I'm dumbfounded because I thought we were very close,'' 
said one owner, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I don't know 
what happened, other than what you hear about the superstar agents 
ruining the deal. While I don't believe that, I do think there is 
a deference to the stars in this league that you're seeing now. And 
if the stars don't like the deal, everyone goes along. ``Some of the 
owners are hurting, but everybody's hurting. And it's my perception 
that the owners can recuperate over time. I don't understand how players 
with limited careers are going to make this money up. It's as if 400 
of them are sacrificing for the needs of a few.'' The owners who spoke 
also pledged their allegiance to Stern, who like other sports commissioners 
during times of labor strife has abdicated his role as neutral arbitrator. 
``You're better served by having one voice,'' Colangelo said. ``I've 
seen many, many players quoted all over the place, and then Billy 
Hunter, the agents. With Russ and David, I think it was the wise thing 
to do.'' For Stern, whose marketing genius and business acumen are 
seen as having catapulted the league out of economic ruin as much 
as its influx of stars in the early 1980s, taking on the mantle of 
ownership may prove costly. He has less than a month to strike a deal 
or go down as the first sports commissioner to lose an entire season 
to labor morass. ``Time will tell how David will be looked upon by 
the various people involved, be it the media, the fans or the owners,'' 
Colangelo said. ``But I don't think there are any regrets from the 
owners about the decision to make David and Russ the spokespeople.'' 
Stern said: ``I'm the person who is charged with managing the lockout, 
and if it requires us to lose the season, well, that's part of my 
job. Right now, the business doesn't support the model. Their view 
is that the owners are supposed to subsidize the sport. If the union 
leadership is wrong, they will have cost their members $1.1 billion. 
That's something our players are apparently all behind.'' Stern said 
that having him and Granik speak for the owners was an effort to avoid 
inflamed passions and destructive dialogue, not to avoid dissent. 
``You can search the record and you won't find any statements talking 
about our players in a negative way,'' he said. ``We work hard to 
counter that because this is not about name-calling. This is about 
making a deal.'' Added Granik: ``If there was serious dissent, teams 
would find a way of getting it out there despite the gag rule. It's 
not about dissent. It's about getting a deal.'' Billy Hunter, the 
union's executive director, said he did not believe all the owners 
agreed with the league's current position. ``The only way you can 
speak with one voice is to silence all the others,'' he said. ``They've 
also put all of the hawks on the negotiating committee. You haven't 
heard from them yet, but if you bring in some of these other voices 
out there, you realize there is some conflict. There are owners who 
wanted the season to start yesterday.'' If there are dissenters, they 
have kept themselves hidden. Large-market franchises like the Knicks, 
the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat take in revenue from a variety 
of outlets, including local television rights, and are perceived to 
be among teams that would not object to playing the season under the 
old agreement. In the original vote to reopen the labor agreement, 
the Lakers owner Jerry Buss and the Heat chairman Micky Arison, whose 
team will move into a new arena next year, were the only two members 
of the nine-member labor negotiating committee who voted against it. 
Yet, when a vote of all 29 teams was taken again last March, 27 owners 
voted to reopen the deal, including Arison and Buss. The two dissenters 
were Portland's Paul Allen and Boston's Paul Gaston. Small-market 
teams with little chance to go to the playoffs are the ones viewed 
as willing to cancel the season because they cannot get a return on 
their investment. But six owners, on condition of anonymity, said 
they would be unwilling to commit more than 52 percent of revenues 
toward salaries in the next four years. Richard DeVos, the owner of 
the Orlando Magic, spoke to The Orlando Sentinel last week. ``I know 
they might not like it, but if you want unlimited opportunity, then 
start your own business,'' DeVos said, referring to the players. ``That's 
what I did. The players union implied that if any team was making 
$5 million, then all the other money should go to the players. You 
have to be kidding me. If you have a $100 million investment, I think 
you are entitled to make a little profit, have a little fun.'' Sterling 
says he has faith in Stern to negotiate a fair agreement, but like 
many of his peers, he is a vocal proponent of shutting down the season 
if a new deal cannot be signed. ``Some of our players have said they 
believe this is forced slavery and that their cars are being taken 
away for a horse and buggy,'' he said. ``I guess I'm personally missing 
something in this whole thing.''
