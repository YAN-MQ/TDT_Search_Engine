If you're dreading this year's trek to a toy store near you, you're 
not alone. But there's another way to help you cross off those names 
on your holiday gift list. Greg LaMotte explains. Ding Dong Ding Dong 
Christmas bells are Ringing Ah, the joy of holiday -- shopping? Angels 
we have heard on high actually, it could be a nightmare. So what is 
a tired, overworked mom or dad to do? How about staying at home and 
shopping over the Internet? Terry sieber does a little of both -- 
a trip to the toy store and time on the Internet. What I like about 
the Internet is the convenience. If you already know what you want 
to purchase, then you don't have to go out there and, you know, elbow 
everybody. Internet shopping is spawning a gigantic industry. E-commerce 
last year revenues totalled about $3 billion. We anticipate that they'll 
total about $7 billion in 1998. And our forecast for 2002 is for $41.1 
billion. This company is called E-toys. The only place you can get 
a toy from this huge warehouse is over the internet. The company started 
about a year and a half ago. Growth has been tremendous. I mean, we 
expect to do about 20 times what we did last Christmas this christmas. 
E-toys isn't alone. Toys 'R' us has also gone online for shoppers. 
And there are others. But while the battle for market dominance on 
the Internet is definitely heating up, not everyone is so sure about 
using a computer to buy toys. On the computer nowadays, it seems like 
they can get into whatever. So, I'd be concerned about them being 
able to get the credit card number. Others say they love the crowds 
and like that hands-on feel before buying. But clearly, as we enter 
the next century, would-be santas will increasingly have their hands 
on a mouse instead of a toy. Greg LaMotte, CNN, Los Angeles.
