With campaigning over and polls ready, the only thing Burkina Faso 
needs now for its upcoming presidential elections is a real opposition 
contender. The incumbent, Blaise Compaore, faces little competition 
in Sunday's polls. A coalition of opposition groups have boycotted 
the election in this west African country, where they say the election 
is a scam and lacks the necessary transparency to ensure a fair chance 
to all candidates. ``We refuse to legitimize an anti-democratic regime,'' 
said opposition Party for Democracy and Progress activist Joseph Ki 
Zerbo. ``We won't serve as an alibi to install a state-party in our 
eyes.'' Although Compaore has been working to promote democratic institutions 
in Burkina Faso, his opponents say he is simply going through the 
motions of fair elections. A former army captain, Compaore was among 
an elite group of military officers who mutinied and eventually led 
to Capt. Thomas Sankara's assent to power. Sankara was deposed in 
1987 and denounced by Compaore who then assumed control. Compaore 
held presidential elections in 1991, but a similar boycott made him 
the lone candidate and more than 74 percent of eligible voters failed 
to cast ballots. Once again, opposition groups have been canvassing 
voters, urging them not to participate in the presidential poll. Although 
they are not entering a candidate, the united opposition have mounted 
a highly visible election campaign, posting notices saying ``Do not 
vote'' or ``I boycott'' around the capital. The boycott strategy is 
also partially in response to poor showing in elections that opposition 
parties have participated in, Ki Zerbo conceded. ``Any time we participate 
in elections, we get less and less,'' he said. In National Assembly 
elections earlier this year, opposition candidates won only 9 of 111 
seats. Unlike the 1991 poll, there are alternative candidates on the 
ballot. Opposition leaders, however, say they are political unknowns 
believed actually to be Compaore supporters. Frederic Guirma, one 
of the two alternative candidates, is running on the lone campaign 
promise to change Burkina Faso's name back to Upper Volta. Compaore, 
meanwhile, was out shaking hands at a rally Thursday at a soccer stadium 
in the capital, Ouagadougou. Faced with the boycott, he said he was 
unconcerned. ``If I were alone in 1998, I would still go to the elections 
because I am more concerned for my population,'' Compaore said. ``I 
would have a feeling of general discomfort if the population did not 
show interest in registering to vote, but we are seeing many people 
interested in participating in political life.''
