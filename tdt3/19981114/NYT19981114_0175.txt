Before Walt Frazier won championships and was enshrined in the Hall 
of Fame, he was a young guard unsure of his place in the National 
Basketball Association _ and, one night, fresh off a horrendous game 
against the Philadelphia 76ers. ``Red Holzman changed my career around 
that night,'' Frazier said Saturday of his former coach, who died 
Friday night at the age of 78. ``He said, `I want you to sit by me 
on the bus back to New York.' I sat down and Red said, `What the hell 
is wrong with you? I scouted you in college. You're a better player 
than that.' He kept talking. ``It became apparent that Red believed 
in me. It was the confidence I needed at that time in my career. Looking 
back, it seems like he was always saying the right things at the right 
time.'' Frazier was one of many players and peers who paid homage 
to Holzman, the coach who in the early '70s brought the Knicks their 
only NBA championships. Described as firm but fair as a coach, Holzman 
was remembered not only for his victories but also for the way in 
which he won. ``I always admired Red for the way he treated everybody,'' 
said Dave DeBusschere, like Frazier a member of both Knick championship 
teams in 1970 and 1973. ``He treated you as a professional and he 
made it fun. Just to mix it up in practice, he would have these little 
shooting games _ the big men against the little men. ``We were a great 
team, but he made us great. He took people from diverse backgrounds 
_ extremely diverse _ and became the glue that put everybody together.'' 
Former coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said when he arrived in the league 
in 1970, Holzman was a role model. ``If I had tried to pattern myself 
after anybody,'' Fitzsimmons said, ``it was Red. ``I would wear these 
big collars because the weather was hot in Phoenix, but then once 
Red said to me, `You know, Cotton, as a coach, you should always wear 
a tie.' I started wearing a tie. I always think about that now when 
I put my tie on. That's the way he did it. I never reached his heights, 
but I tried to do it the way he did.'' Fuzzy Levane, who was six months 
older than Holzman, was one of Holzman's oldest friends. Levane played 
against him in the early 1940s while Holzman was at City College and 
Levane was at St. John's. They worked at the same restaurant in Schroon 
Lake, N.Y., during the summer. ``He was my busboy and he used to tell 
me I was the sloppiest waiter he ever saw,'' Levane said, laughing. 
``The only time I saw him was on Friday when he came around to collect 
the tips.'' The two went on to play for the Rochester Royals of the 
National Basketball League in 1945, pocketing $1,000 a month for a 
five-month season. Along with their wives and two infant daughters, 
they shared a three-bedroom house for two years. Levane was also responsible 
for Holzman's first coaching job. While Levane was coaching Milwaukee, 
he acquired Holzman in 1953 _ Holzman's last playing season. Holzman 
succeeded Levane as coach in 1954. Levane surmised that the death 
last June of Selma, Holzman's wife of 55 years, was devastating for 
his longtime friend. ``I think when Selma died, he really became lost,'' 
he said. In his new book, ``Values of the Game,'' the former Knick 
and former Sen. Bill Bradley wrote about Holzman's coaching style. 
He wrote of Holzman: ``His attitude was, `No excuses _ none!' Even 
if you were late because of circumstances clearly beyond your control, 
you got no sympathy or credit. `` `Sure, Bill, I know your mother's 
cousin called with an emergency that your mother's nephew couldn't 
take care of,' Holzman used to say, `and it rained on the highway 
and made it slick, after the earthquake damaged the bridge, but you're 
still fined.' He smiled and I paid up.'' Said Frazier, who received 
the news Saturday in St. Croix, his home during the off season: ``He 
was hard, but fair. And what I liked about him was there was one set 
of rules for Frazier, Reed, Bradley, whoever. ``My fondest memory 
is him waiting for me in the locker room after a tough loss. He would 
say: `C'mon, Clyde, the sun's coming up tomorrow. I gotta go have 
my Scotch.' He was a very good and fair man.'' Said Ernie Grunfeld, 
the Knicks' president and general manager: ``He was our patriarch. 
He was like a father to many of us. Whenever you went to the Garden 
for a game, you knew Red was going to be there _ Suite 200, sitting 
at his table. The Knicks were part of him and Red was part of the 
Knicks. He'll be a legend forever at Madison Square Garden. ``My children 
grew up with him. He was like a grandfather to them. His life revolved 
around basketball, but he was so much more than a coach.''
