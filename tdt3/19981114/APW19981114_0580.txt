Norwegian People's Aid said one of their hospitals in Sudan was bombed 
Saturday by Sudanese government warplanes _ killing two and wounding 
11 _ hours after the African nation's foreign minister accused the 
group of aiding rebel forces. The Oslo-based humanitarian group said 
the hospital is in the southern Sudan town of Yei, an area held by 
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, or SPLA. ``In this attack 
a child was killed. One of the children is being treated at the hospital. 
This underscores our point that innocent civilians are being hit, 
and not military targets,'' spokesman Paul Giertz said in an interview 
with Norway's NRK radio. The group's hospitals in Sudan have been 
bombed by government aircraft repeatedly. Sudanese Foreign Minister 
Mustafa Osman Ismail, in Norway as a guest of the government Friday, 
accused the group of prolonging Sudan's 15-year civil war by treating 
wounded rebel soldiers and smuggling arms. ``If it hadn't been for 
the support Norwegian People's Aid gives to the SPLA and its leader, 
John Garang, he would long since have had to sit at the negotiating 
table and we would have had peace,'' the foreign minister was quoted 
as telling Norwegian reporters late Friday. Hours later, early Saturday, 
Sudanese government bombers attacked the Yei hospital, Norwegian People's 
Aid said. The group said it believed the attack was linked to the 
Sudanese minister's accusations. The group denied allegations of aiding 
rebels or smuggling weapons, and said the only function of its hospitals 
in southern Sudan is to help victims of the civil war. Norwegian People's 
Aid is one of the few humanitarian groups that openly takes sides 
in a conflict in principle, as well as for practical reasons. It believes 
that working through official channels, such as the government of 
Sudan, would hamper relief efforts in rebel areas. In a recent statement, 
the group's board said ``Norwegian People's Aid remains on the side 
of the people of the south in their just battle against terror and 
oppression and for human dignity and freedom.'' Animist and Christian 
rebels in southern Sudan have fought a 15-year insurgency for autonomy 
from the Arab, Muslim-dominated government in the north.
