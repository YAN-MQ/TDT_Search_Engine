When "NBC nightly news" continues, it's just like training for war, 
but they never leave the country. I don't want to buy a new PC every 
year till commencement. I needed one that would keep up with them. 
Got to save SOMETHING FOR college. Call 1-800-gateway and we'll custom-build 
your kids a PC with an Intel processor and CD-rom now for only $999 
or with the your:)ware program it's just $28 a month. And in two YEARS 
YOU could trade it in toward the PURCHASE OF a new one. You guys make 
sneakers? Call us now and let's talk about your:)ware from gateway.
