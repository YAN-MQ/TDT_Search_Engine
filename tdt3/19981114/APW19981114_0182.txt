A Singapore man was sentenced to three months in jail for unauthorized 
use of the Internet under the island nation's tough new computer laws, 
a newspaper reported Saturday. Daud Mohamed Saini, a 29-year old former 
business manager, was found guilty of using a customer's Internet 
account without permission between May and June last year, said The 
Straits Times. Although he only incurred about 40 Singapore dollars 
(dlrs 24) of charges while using the account, the court handed him 
a stiff penalty under the recently amended Computer Misuse Act. Singapore 
aims to bring Internet commerce to the heart of this business center's 
operations and has passed legislation this year to regulate electronic 
transactions and fight cyber-crime. Amended in June, the Computer 
Misuse Act seeks to enhance security, deter computer criminals with 
harsh penalties and broaden powers of investigation. Daud, who worked 
at a data and communication products company, faced a maximum 2,000 
Singapore dollar (dlrs 1,200) fine and two years in prison.
