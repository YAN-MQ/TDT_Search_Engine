Last week in Tampa bay, the Tennessee Oilers played like titans. Today, 
team owner bud Adams announced his team's new name will be -- the 
titans. The switch will take place next year when their new stadium 
opens. Of course, titans was the original name of the jets in the 
afl. The name "Oilers" will be retired.
