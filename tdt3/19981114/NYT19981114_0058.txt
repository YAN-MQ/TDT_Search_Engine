A new law to revive the nation's troubled public housing had a simple 
goal when it was first proposed several years go: Allow more working 
poor families into projects that had become dominated _ some would 
say decimated _ by very poor welfare families. The rationale, first 
pushed by Republicans, was that working families would be role models 
for their neighbors, would help stabilize projects and, by paying 
higher rents, would help housing authorities financially. But buried 
in the 300-page bill that President Clinton signed in October is a 
provision that local officials warn could paralyze that effort: It 
requires cities to mix working families with poorer families in each 
and every project. Cities say this provision will be self-defeating 
because it will mean having to persuade working families to move into 
the worst projects, while trying to keep working families already 
living in the better projects from fleeing when the poorest of the 
poor move in. Inserted during last-minute congressional negotiations 
by Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development, the 
provision has been hailed by the Clinton administration as a tool 
to reach an even more important goal than income-mixing: racial desegregation. 
That's because, generally, the poorest tenants tend to be black and 
Hispanic; among the working poor, a greater proportion are white. 
Cuomo said cities will have to find ways to make it work. ``They will 
not get a penny from this department as long as they maintain segregated 
housing,'' he said in an interview, referring to race. Calling the 
law ``a revolutionary integration plan,'' he said it would keep public 
housing from becoming even more of what it already is: separate worlds, 
one for working families, another for those on welfare. Public housing 
in almost every city, he said, is characterized by far too many `` 
`white' buildings and `black' buildings and `Latino' buildings and 
`welfare' buildings.'' Ideally, he said, every building should reflect 
the racial makeup of each city's public housing system. Cuomo's provision 
calls only for economic integration. But the Clinton administration 
has portrayed it as being much more about race. In September, Clinton 
urged a public housing law that would ``deconcentrate poverty, mix 
incomes and thereby mix people of all races and ethnicities.'' Both 
sides agree that racial imbalances remain widespread in public housing 
and that years of official discrimination are largely to blame. Cuomo 
complains that local housing officials oppose his initiative because 
they do not want to desegregate. But the local officials insist the 
law won't work. They say there's a big difference between rooting 
out discrimination and trying to make people live where they don't 
want to live in the name of racial balance. And, they warn that at 
its worst, the law could turn public housing into a political battleground, 
as mandatory busing once did for public education. Over the last decade, 
even New York City, praised as having some of the best public housing, 
has seen its proportion of working tenants fall from half to less 
than a third, in part because of federal rules favoring the poorest 
applicants. The new law allows cities to offer sweeteners to working 
families _ like lower rents or moving costs _ to lure them to less 
desirable buildings. But many city officials say that while they favor 
economic integration and racial integration, too, it is unrealistic 
to enforce the same numerical goals in every project. ``There are 
places that working families are just not going to want to go,'' said 
a housing official in New York City. Donald Smith, executive director 
of the Los Angeles Housing Authority, said, ``I think given the traditional 
image of public housing, it's going to be difficult.'' The new law 
says that 40 percent of newly vacant apartments must go to the poorest, 
those making less than 30 percent of an area's median income. (In 
New York, this means $15,000 for a family of four. Familes making 
near that amount could be working minimum-wage jobs, but those making 
much less tend to be on welfare.) The other 60 percent of vacancies 
can go to those making more _ people who almost certainly have jobs. 
In New York, this could mean families earning up to $40,000, in South 
Texas up to $25,000 and in Chicago up to $45,000. Joseph Ventrone, 
the staff director for the Republican-controlled House subcommittee 
on housing, calls Cuomo's provision ''an extraordinary example of 
HUD micromanagement which is contrary to one of the main purposes 
of the bill'' _ to give decision-making power to cities so they can 
find ways to attract working families. Even some advocates for the 
poorest of the poor are wary. ``It's certainly necessary for someone 
to say it,'' said David Bryce, deputy director of the National Housing 
Law Center, ``and it would be nice if someone could do something about 
it, but the reality is that it's incredibly complex. You've got to 
factor in what people of color want for themselves. You can say segregation 
is bad _ and forced segregation is certainly bad _ but you can't leap 
from that to say that you must desegregrate all public housing projects.'' 
But other housing advocates, including Jeff Lubell, an analyst for 
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit research group, 
say the law must find some way _ if not Cuomo's way _ to address racial 
segregation or risk worsening the imbalance when cities bring in working 
families, more of whom will be white. ``If all you achieve through 
the new targeting rules,'' Lubell said, ``is lower-income familes 
in some of the higher-income developments and other developments remaining 
largely very poor and minority, then is that really a good policy?''
