Joe Drape chooses 16 teams with the weapons and the nerve to make 
a run at the Final Four, which will be at St. Petersburg's Tropicana 
Field. (Last season's record in parentheses.) Last Team Standing Stanford 
(30-5) Three all-America candidates _ point guard Arthur Lee, forward 
Mark Madsen and and the 7-foot-1-inch center Tim Young _ are among 
11 lettermen returning from last season's Final Four Team. In the 
seniors Lee (14.5 points, 4.6 assists a game) and Kris Weems (12.6 
points), the Cardinal boasts the headiest backcourt in the nation. 
In addition to Madsen (11.7 points, 8.2 rebounds) and Young (11.3 
points, 8.1 rebounds), who will break Adam Keefe's school rebounding 
record this season, Peter Sauer (9.2 points, 4.6 rebounds) returns 
to an equally heady front line. The twins Jason and Jarron Collins 
add front-court athleticism off the bench. Stanford has all the ingredients; 
all that remains to be seen is how it withstands the pressure of being 
a front-runner. Three That Could Meet in St. Pete Connecticut (32-5) 
The only player in the way of Richard Hamilton (21.5 ppg) repeating 
as Big East player of the year is his point guard, Khalid El-Amin, 
who was the Big East rookie of the year and averaged 23 points in 
four national tournament games. El-Amin will trigger one of Coach 
Jim Calhoun's deepest and most talented teams; all five starters are 
back, and last season's run to the final eight gave them seasoning. 
The key to the Huskies' first visit to the Final Four is consistent 
play from two juniors, 6-11 Jake Voskuhl (6.9 points, 7.1 rebounds) 
and 6-7 Kevin Freeman (10.3 points, 6.6 rebounds). Duke (32-4) Coach 
Mike Krzyzewski calls this season's Blue Devils, virtually everyone's 
preseason No. 1, one of his most talented teams. The fifth-year senior 
Trajan Langdon is an all-American who shoots better than 40 percent 
from 3-point range and is the on-court vessel for the Blue Devils' 
heritage of defense and will to win. The 6-9, 270-pound sophomore 
Elton Brand is probably this season's player of the year _ he missed 
15 games as a freshman with a broken foot, but still averaged 13.4 
points and 7.3 rebounds. Duke also returns the junior Chris Carrawell 
(10.1 points) and the sophomore defensive stopper Shane Battier, who 
demonstrated offensive skills when Brand was down: 7.6 points a game 
on 54 percent shooting. The sophomore William Avery takes over at 
point guard for Steve Wojciechowski, and his growth will determine 
how far the Blue Devils go. Washington (20-10) The other Huskies came 
within a point of beating Connecticut and advancing to the round of 
eight last year. Coach Bob Bender is a Krzyzewski protege and has 
ingrained the Duke toughness in a team that may have the best individual 
talent in the Pacific-10. The 7-foot Canadian Todd MacCulloch (18.6 
points, 9.7 rebounds) has led the nation in field-goal percentage 
twice. Guards Donald Watts and Deon Luton combined for 32 points a 
game. The Pac-10 may be the best conference in the nation, and the 
Huskies will be well prepped for the tournament. Four That Could Knock 
on the Door Michigan State (22-8) Mateen Cleaves (16.1 points, 7.2 
assists), a player of the year candidate, is the best thing that has 
happened to Spartan basketball since Magic Johnson. The 6-2 junior 
leads a team rare for the Big Ten: it is as graceful as it is bruising. 
The senior Jason Klein (11.2 points) shot 41.1 percent from beyond 
the 3-point line. Another senior, Antonio Smith (7.9 points, 8.7 rebounds), 
helped Michigan State outrebound Big Ten opponents by nearly 9 per 
game. Kentucky (35-4) The defending national champion lost its leading 
scorer, Jeff Sheppard; its force in the middle, Nazr Mohammed, and 
a classy starter in Allen Edwards. But forward Scott Padgett is a 
star to build around. He was third on the team in scoring (11.5 points), 
second in rebounds (6.5) and steals and shot 85 percent from the foul 
line. Coach Tubby Smith has made five consecutive trips to the round 
of 16 with three different teams; the Wildcats will be ready at tournament 
time. Temple (21-9) The Owls will never be up tempo, but they will 
have more pop than any of John Chaney's recent teams. Lamont Barnes 
(13.8 points, 8 rebounds) has plenty of help inside with the addition 
of the 6-10 McDonald's all-American Kevin Lyde. Another McDonald's 
honoree, Mark Karcher, averaged 27 points in 1996-97 at Baltimore's 
St. Francis Academy before sitting out last season. Temple benefits 
from playing in the ultra-competitive Atlantic 10, which put five 
teams in the tournament last year. Indiana (20-12) Bob Knight should 
have one of his most talented and athletic Hoosier teams in years. 
The junior A.J. Guyton averaged 16.8 points and shot 43.9 percent 
from 3-point range; he is the only Indiana player other than Isiah 
Thomas to produce at least 400 points, 100 rebounds and 100 assists 
in each of his first two seasons. The sophomore Luke Recker (12.8 
points) leads a brigade of quick swingmen, including Michigan's 1997 
Mr. Basketball, Dane Fife. The Hoosiers will challenge Michigan State 
for the Big Ten title. Eight That Could Hang Around Late Tennessee 
(20-9) The Vols, not the Lady Vols. Coach Jerry Green returns all 
five starters from a team that last season made its first tournament 
appearance since 1989. Guards Tony Harris (14.2 points) and Brandon 
Wharton (15.2 points) lead the way. Maryland (21-11) The Terps are 
led by a couple of self-made stars in Obinna Ekezie and Laron Profit. 
They have improved each year, and along with Terrell Stokes they give 
Gary Williams solid leadership for a deep run in the tournament. Utah 
(30-4) Coach Rick Majerus will let Andre Miller loose because he has 
to. Miller, the point guard and player of the year candidate, and 
the 6-10 Finnish forward Hanno Mottola (12.5 points, 5.3 rebounds) 
are the only seasoned contributors remaining from last season's tournament 
runner-up. Arkansas (24-9) The senior backcourt of Kareem Reid and 
Pat Bradley makes the Hogs dangerous at tournament time. Reid is an 
assist king; Bradley (14.8 points) led the Southeastern Conference 
in 3-point goals the past two seasons. Kansas (35-4) Low expectations 
are what the Jayhawks need to exorcise the demons of early tournament 
exits. Ryan Robertson (8.3 points, 6.4 assists) looks like a prototypical 
Kansas point guard. But the 6-8 power forward Lester Earl, who transferred 
two years ago from Louisiana State, might be the undisciplined spark 
that Jayhawk basketball needs. North Carolina (34-4) Ed Cota and Ademola 
Okulaja are not at the same level as the departed Vince Carter and 
Antawn Jamison. But Coach Bill Guthridge will rely on them while he 
tries to bring the freshman Jason Capel and Ronald Curry, the football 
team's quarterback, around in time to make the round of 16. UCLA (24-9) 
If Baron Davis is truly recovered from knee surgery, his court savvy 
_ 11.7 points, 4 rebounds and 5 assists a game, plus 77 steals _ could 
hold together a remarkably young and talented team. The 6-11 freshman 
Dan Gadzuric could be the Bruins' best big man since Bill Walton. 
Also in the recruiting class, considered the nation's best: the 6-11 
power forward Jerome Moiso and the 6-7 slasher JaRon Rush. Texas Christian 
(27-6) Lee Nailon entered the National Basketball Association draft, 
then reconsidered and brought his 24.9 points a game back to Fort 
Worth. The dependable point guard Prince Fowler will get him the ball. 
Coach Billy Tubbs has reloaded with junior college transfers for his 
brand of ball: pressure defense, run up the score.
