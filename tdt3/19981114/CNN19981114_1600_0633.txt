U.S. government scientists say they have new evidence of global warming. 
Those findings underscore the rationale behind a new international 
accord on the problem. Luis Clemens has more on the buenos aires plan 
of action. It is so decided. The buenos aires plan of action was approved 
after two weeks and a grueling all-night negotiating session. I'm 
tired. Satisfied, but very tired. She wasn't alone. Everyone seemed 
worn out by the effort to reduce Greenhouse gas emissions. Yet the 
plan was met with mixed reaction. I think so. It is good. Because 
we are on track. We are a bit disappointed that the real heart of 
the issue, making sure that countries reach their Kyoto targets at 
home. That was all put off for future talks. The teeth of the action 
plan lies in its deadlines and enforcement provisions. In the next 
two years, so-called "clean development mechanisms" have to be spelled 
out. Such measures allow industrialized nations to buy reductions 
in pollution and receive credit for helping others pollute less. The 
accord sets in motion a process to penalize those who fail to meet 
the targets agreed to last year in Kyoto. In plain language, what 
we got was a way of putting the promises of Kyoto to reduce Greenhouse 
gases into reality by the year 2000. I would've wanted more. I would 
have wanted a much more strict timetable. I would've wanted more on 
the real issues. Behind closed doors, developing countries insisted 
on and secured important concessions, such as financial and technological 
help in adapting to climate change. Clearly, there were deep division 
and a lot of mistrust and residual anger in some respects between 
developing world and the U.S. Differences that are not likely to go 
away. Hopefully, with this plan of action, our efforts in combating 
climate change will move forward. Two other developing nations, Argentina 
and Kazakhstan, have pledged to join industrialized countries in voluntarily 
cutting Greenhouse gas emissions. Even though progress was made, many 
tough decisions were postponed until the year 2000. Luis Clemens, 
CNN, buenos aires.
