His Execellency Mr. Saddam Hussein President of the Republic of Iraq 
Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council Baghdad Excellency, 
As you may know already, I interrupted an official visit to North 
Africa yesterday and returned to New York in view of the worsening 
crisis with regard to Iraq. This afternoon and evening (Nov. 13), 
I met with the members of the Security Council for four hours in order 
to review the situation. I can report to you that without exception, 
all the members of the Security Council express preference for a diplomatic 
solution of the crisis. As you are aware, I have made continuous efforts 
myself over the past three months to bring about such a solution. 
The Security Council also unanimously endorsed the press statement 
I issued in Marrakech on 11 November in which I addressed a personal 
appeal to you, Mr. President, to take the necessary steps for a diplomatic 
solution to become possible. For ease of reference, I am reproducing 
below the text of this statement. ``I am saddened and burdened by 
the Iraqi decision of 5 August and 31 October to not cooperate with 
UNSCOM. I strongly urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi Government 
to rescind its decision and resume immediate cooperation with UNSCOM 
and IAEA inspectors. Iraq has maintained for a long time that it wants 
to see light at the end of the tunnel. I also want to see the lifting 
of sanctions, so that Iraq can regain its place among the community 
of nations. As I have said repeatedly, the only way to achieve this 
is for Iraq to fully cooperate with UN Security Council. The Security 
Council had agreed a way forward on a comprehensive review. I firmly 
believe that this offers Iraq genuine opportunity. The comprehensive 
review will map out the remaining steps, provided Iraq cooperates, 
thus allowing them to see light at the end of the tunnel. The Iraqi 
leadership's decision not to cooperate with UNSCOM at a time when 
the Council was undertaking these efforts came as a surprise to me 
and, I suspect, to all Council members. I, therefore, appeal once 
again to President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi leadership to take 
this opportunity to resume cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA. This 
would be good for the Iraqi people, for the region and for the world.'' 
The Security Council remains actively seized of this matter. I should, 
therefore, be grateful for an early response to my appeal. Please 
accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration, Kofi 
A. Annan.
