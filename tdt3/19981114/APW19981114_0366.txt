Russia will continue to export grain grown domestically even though 
it has just arranged to receive more than a million tons of wheat 
in food aid from the United States, a news report said Saturday. ``You 
can't stop life, can you?'' Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik, who 
led negotiations with the West on aid, told the Moscow Times newspaper. 
``That's what I told the Americans, such situations arise.'' Russian 
officials, saying they feared food shortages, reached a deal with 
the United States for over 1.5 million tons of free wheat last week. 
Officials are also negotiating to receive wheat, rice, beef and pork 
in early January from the European Union. But the government has already 
sold nearly 1.5 million tons of wheat so far this year to markets 
abroad, where wheat prices are three times as high as domestically. 
And it plans to keep doing so, the Moscow Times said. ``We have 2.5 
million tons of grain in the Krasnodar region, and they have sold 
200,000 tons to Azerbaijan. Are we going to stop? No we are not,'' 
Kulik said. The food deal with the United States, which also includes 
low-interest loans for another 200,000 tons of wheat, stipulates that 
the American aid cannot be sold abroad. American agriculture officials 
interviewed by the newspaper seemed nonchalant about the news. ``We 
can work it out,'' one U.S. agriculture official told the paper. In 
an editorial, the English-language daily accused the U.S. of not being 
interested in helping out those who might face food shortages this 
winter, but of only wanting to help its own farmers. ``If the U.S. 
is so worried about hunger in Russia's region, why doesn't it give 
Russia loans to buy Russian wheat for a third of the price?'' the 
Times wrote in an editorial.
