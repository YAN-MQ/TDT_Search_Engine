Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday that the crisis over U.N. 
weapons inspections in Iraq is ``by no means over yet,'' saying it 
is unclear whether Iraq's offer to allow weapons inspections to resume 
their work is unconditional. Forces remain on alert, poised for military 
action without further warning, he said. Blair spoke after assessing 
a letter that Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz wrote to U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, saying Iraq would allow U.N. weapons 
inspectors to resume their work at suspected weapons sites in Iraq. 
The letter ``appears to promise'' resumption of weapons inspections, 
Blair said, adding that the letter is ambiguous as to whether the 
inspectors can return without conditions. Referring to nine ``points'' 
included with the letter, Blair said ``any conditions of this nature 
are unacceptable.'' ``We are not even in the position yet that we 
can be sure from this letter that the inspectors are to be allowed 
back in unconditionally,'' he said. ``They cannot be conditions.'' 
``The Iraqi position has to be unconditional, not hedged about, not 
confused, not subject to this point or that point _ unconditional,'' 
he said. ``Compliance with the agreement must be absolute.'' There 
can be no negotiation, no further deals, no more amendments to what 
they have agreed, Blair said. ``We can't have a situation where there 
is confusion as to the terms upon which the inspectors do their work,'' 
he said. ``In the meantime, our forces remain on alert to the possibility 
of military action without further warning.'' A spokeswoman for Blair, 
speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said Britain will be 
looking to Iraq to clarify whether the nine points are conditions. 
A Blair spokesman said the prime minister had held four telephone 
conversations with U.S. President Bill Clinton in the past 24 hours, 
the final one to discuss Iraq's latest offer lasting an hour. Defense 
Secretary George Robertson wrote in an article for the News of the 
World tabloid newspaper Sunday that Britain and the United States 
were determined to bring Saddam Hussein's ``constant cat and mouse 
game'' to an end and that ``Arab countries are now behind the move 
to bring him to heel.'' ``With no one holding him back, he could produce 
germ warfare weapons within a week, and it would take him only a few 
more weeks to produce chemical weapons,'' Robertson wrote. ``And do 
not believe he would not use them to further his ambitions. He has 
done it before.''
