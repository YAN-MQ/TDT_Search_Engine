The rules for traveling with pets on airlines vary from carrier to 
carrier. Kalin Thomas-Samuel has this guide for getting your pets 
from here to there successfully and safely in this edition of "working 
ahead." Pets can travel on airlines, either as a carryon, or in cargo, 
as checked luggage. One exception, no pets on southwest, except for 
assistance animals. Rules for pet travel vary, but there are a few 
basics. First, you'll need advance reservations. Most airlines allow 
one pet per plane in the passenger cabin but permit more animals in 
cargo. The cost is $50 to $100 per pet one way. Airlines didn't always 
let pets fly. Gayle martz, a former flight attendant, persuaded airlines 
to change pet travel rules. I knew the anxiety that people went through 
that wanted to take their pets with them. Martz also designed the 
"Sherpa bag," an alternative to hard kennels, approved for carryon. 
Sherpa bags all conform to the underneath the seat dimensions on an 
airplane so the animal can have more room. They've got the mesh panels 
for ventilation. It's lightweight. It gives them a private den that 
they can travel in and where they're safe and secure. United and Delta 
airlines banned shipping animals in cargo this past summer due to 
extreme heat. American and northwest restrict pet travel in cargo 
when temperatures rise above 85 degrees, or fall below 45 degrees. 
Tomorrow -- tips to make traveling easier on pets, and a place for
