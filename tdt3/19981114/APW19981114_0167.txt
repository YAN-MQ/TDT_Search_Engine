In a move to jump start its fledgling mutual fund industry, Singapore 
said Saturday it will release another 10 billion Singapore dollars 
(dlrs 6 billion) to private fund managers over the next three years. 
The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the island state's de facto central 
bank, said in a statement that the move will help ``build Singapore 
into a world-class financial center.'' The sum is in addition to 25 
billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 15 billion) earmarked earlier this 
year for placement with private managers, also over the next three 
years, National Development Minister Lim Hng Kiang said late Friday. 
``These funds will act as seed money to encourage existing fund management 
companies to continue to grow in their operations as well as attract 
other fund management companies to set up offices in Singapore,'' 
he said. Lim, who is also the country's second finance minister, said 
the money will be invested with ``qualifying fund managers of good 
proven track record and who show commitment to developing the asset 
management industry in Singapore.'' Their commitment will be measured 
by the amount of additional funds they manage from Singapore, as well 
as their plans to build local market expertise. ``This increase in 
critical mass of investors here will mean more business for the various 
financial services that Singapore offers,'' said Lim. The initial 
government placement was announced in February and 6.5 billion Singapore 
dollars (dlrs 4 billion) has been placed so far with private managers, 
he said.
