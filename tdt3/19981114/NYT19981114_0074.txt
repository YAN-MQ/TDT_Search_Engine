These days Jason Sehorn spends more time inside Giants Stadium than 
he ever did. But it is nothing like the time he used to spend there. 
As part of his daily rehabilitation on his injured right knee, Sehorn 
enters the empty stadium just past 11 a.m. and walks up every stair 
in every aisle in the lower and upper tiers. That is 76 aisles and 
more than 3,000 stairs. ``It used to be full of people cheering our 
team; now it's just me,'' Sehorn said Friday morning as he sat in 
the training room off the players' locker room. ``I do everything 
alone. I'm my own team. There's no one to help you walk up and down 
stairs for an hour anyway. I'd rather be in solitude.'' To fans of 
the beleaguered Giants, Sehorn's knee injury is easily the most noteworthy 
event in what has been a most forgettable season. To many, the team's 
descent this year can be traced to the moment when Sehorn landed awkwardly 
on the warm evening of Aug. 20, his knee bending unnaturally beneath 
him on the opening kickoff of an exhibition game with the Jets. Sehorn, 
an emerging star who was due to begin his third season as the team's 
best cornerback, tore his anterior cruciate and medial collateral 
ligaments. A young, brash Giants defense _ epitomized by Sehorn, whose 
bounty of talent graced and dominated games last year _ felt its vulnerability 
that instant. Although Conrad Hamilton has taken his place and played 
well, the Giants miss Sehorn, a smooth and elegant player gifted with 
speed and size who gave a hawkish defense the confidence to attack 
virtually free of risk. Sehorn, 27, who had surgery two months ago, 
spends three hours a day, five days a week rehabilitating his knee 
at the stadium. He purposely arranges his workouts around the Giants' 
practice schedule, arriving before his teammates do, staying out of 
their way and leaving before they come back from practice. ``It's 
not that much fun to be around 53 healthy guys who are running around 
and talking about football when you can't do it,'' Sehorn said. ``And 
it avoids the redundant questions and answers. People feel obliged 
to ask you how you're doing. What can you say? ``I'm doing good. There 
are no tears running down my face.'' The injury never did dramatically 
unsettle Sehorn. When he came to the sideline after being tackled 
on the opening kickoff Aug. 20, he initially avoided the team's doctors. 
``But Coach Fassel kind of looked at me, and I looked at him like, 
`This might be my worst nightmare,''' Sehorn said. ``The doctor came 
over and grabbed my knee and twisted it one way. He looked me right 
in the eye and said, `They got your ACL.' Then he turned it the other 
way. He said, `They got your MCL.' ``It was just as matter-of-fact 
as that. I said, `Are you sure?' He said, `This knee is swinging like 
a barn door.''' When he got to the locker room, the Giants allowed 
Sehorn's wife of six months, Whitney, to go inside. She wanted to 
cry. Jason would not let her. ``This is not the worst thing that could 
happen by a long shot,'' he told her. ``Don't worry about me.'' Inside 
his townhouse in Teaneck, N.J., Sehorn has a picture of the tackle 
that tore apart his knee. ``You can see my lower leg flat on the ground 
sideways and my thigh perpendicular to it,'' said Sehorn, who has 
a scar about five inches long on his right knee. ``I put it up where 
I can see it every day to remind myself that this is what happened 
and this is what we have to overcome.'' Most days he rides a stationary 
bicycle, lifts weights with his legs and upper body, does 300 sit-ups 
and a series of flexibility exercises and then hits the stairs. When 
he began his rehabilitation, Sehorn, whose all-round athleticism won 
him the annual Superstars competition last spring, was shocked how 
much strength he had lost in his right leg. ``They put a 20-pound 
plate on the weight machine for my leg,'' Sehorn said. ``That thing 
looked as thin as a potato chip. And I had to strain to lift it. I 
was saying, `Are you kidding me?' ``I felt like the mechanic who loaned 
somebody a brand new car and they brought it back with all these problems. 
What happened to my knee? It was brand new the last time I saw it.'' 
Sehorn used to lift 200 to 220 pounds per leg. Now he is up to 80 
pounds. ``There's no rush,'' he said. ``My next season doesn't begin 
until July.'' Sehorn will be on the sideline for Sunday's game against 
the Green Bay Packers, as he has been for all of the Giants' home 
games. He finds watching football boring and watching the Giants lose 
agonizing. He wonders, like most fans of the team, how they have fallen 
so fast from division winners to a 3-6 record. ``I've got plenty of 
opinions about it,'' he said when asked what was wrong with the Giants. 
``But my mother told me to keep some opinions to myself. I'm not in 
the meetings. I don't know the game plan. I did go to the Washington 
game, and they just looked lifeless. The defense had no giddy-up when 
they came off the field. Then at Dallas last week, it looked like 
a completely different team and played with lots of energy. ``I think 
all the injuries have hurt the cohesiveness we felt last year.'' And 
if one injury _ his _ stands out among all the rest, Sehorn is not 
sure it was the catalyst for all the other woes. ``I'm not going to 
say we'd be 6-3 if I played,'' he said. ``How could anybody say something 
like that?'' He has no regrets about choosing to return that one kickoff 
nearly three months ago. ``Well, yeah, I regret not going to the right 
instead of left,'' he said with an easy smile. ``But I wanted to do 
it, and I had no fears. Now there's no chance I'll get back there 
catching a kickoff again. It took a year away from my life.'' In the 
meantime, he is plenty busy for someone who claims to have too much 
time to kill. Besides his workouts, Sehorn writes an online football 
column, does some television commentary and heads to the mega-plex 
for the afternoon movie matinee a couple of times a week. And he tries 
to avoid the temptation of the catalogs piling up on the coffee table 
in front of his couch. ``It turns out that every mail-order catalog 
maker in America knows I'm injured and just sitting around,'' he said. 
``I don't know how they found out, but my mailbox is filled with catalogs 
every day. They know I'm not playing this year. The whole world knows 
I'm injured.'' The Giants' world will be happier when Sehorn no longer 
has time for home shopping.
