Most of the unsettled weather Sunday will be confined to the perimeter 
of the nation. Dry and comfortably cool conditions will dominate many 
areas as high pressure stretches from the lower Ohio Valley to the 
Southwest. It will be windy in parts of the northern states, but mainly 
calm farther south. Low pressure in New Brunswick will circulate chillier 
air into the Northeast on brisk northwesterly breezes. Gusts over 
30 mph are likely in New England. A few snow showers will dust the 
mountains from Vermont to Maine, but sunshine will return to the coast 
by midday. A weakening disturbance near the Mississippi Delta will 
supply moisture to the Southeast, but most of the showers will be 
confined to near the Gulf Coast. Warm and humid air will occupy southern 
Florida with isolated showers near the shore. Low clouds and fog along 
the western Gulf Coast will slowly yield to sunshine. A new storm 
developing in the Dakotas will summon a limited moisture supply into 
the northeast Plains with thickening clouds. Light snow will develop 
from upper Michigan to eastern Montana. A blustery flow will descend 
the eastern Rockies and Black Hills with gusts to 40 mph. The boundary 
between polar and Pacific air will be active in the Northwest. A strong 
onshore flow will bring rain to the coast and rising snow levels in 
the Cascades. Clouds and a few showers will progress into eastern 
Washington and Idaho. The Southwest will be bright and warmer while 
offshore winds in southern California produce sunshine and milder 
conditions. FOCUS: TEXAS WETNESS Excessive rain and flooding has plagued 
eastern Texas during the last few days. A record daily rainfall of 
4.68 inches was measured in Houston on Thursday. A slow-moving jet 
stream disturbance intercepting a rich supply of moisture from the 
Gulf of Mexico fueled the deluge. November can be very wet near the 
Gulf States. Jet stream disturbances, which derive their energy from 
increasing temperature contrasts between high and low latitudes, are 
more common than in summer. Meanwhile, lingering warmth of Gulf waters 
provide a source of humid air, which fuels the heavy rain.
