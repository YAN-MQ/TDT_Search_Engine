It appears U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan may have helped avert 
another military strike against Iraq. Iraqi ambassador to the U.N., 
nizar Hamdoon, delivered a letter from President Saddam Hussein today. 
Sources tell CNN it says Iraq agrees to unconditionally resume cooperation 
with U.N. weapons inspectors. Annan says the terms of the letter meet 
U.N. requirements. He'll submit it to the U.N. security council when 
it meets this afternoon. The Russian foreign ministry called Saddam 
Hussein's apparent mission important progress towards a peaceful resolution 
of the solution. In Washington, national security adviser Sandy Berger 
has been monitoring the situation. The policy team is meeting to assess 
the latest information. The White House has been demanding "concrete 
and demonstrable actions Iraq will comply with weapons inspectors."
