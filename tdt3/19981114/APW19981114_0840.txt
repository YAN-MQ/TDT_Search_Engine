Red Holzman was a Basketball Hall of Fame coach with simple philosophies: 
play aggressive defense, move without the ball and hit the open man. 
Holzman, who molded a collection of individual stars into a cohesive 
unit that helped the New York Knicks win their only two American National 
Basketball Association championships, died Friday night. He was 78. 
``Red represented the best of our game,'' NBA commissioner David Stern 
said. ``He was a fan-friendly player and coach but most of all, a 
gentleman who treated his players with dignity and respect and received 
their loyalty and love in return.'' That respect was felt by members 
of the Knicks. ``He had a game plan and he let you execute it,'' said 
Earl ``The Pearl'' Monroe, a member of the 1973 championship team. 
``He made it very easy to play for him. He was a straight-forward 
guy. You respected him.'' ``He was a good friend and a great coach,'' 
said Dave DeBusschere, who played on both the 1970 and '73 title teams, 
and later became general manager of the Nets, commissioner of the 
American Basketball Association and executive vice president of the 
Knicks. ``He also was a teacher, a pioneer and he made playing the 
game fun.'' The Knicks' current executives also were saddened by Holzman's 
death. ``This is a great loss to the Knicks' family, the New York 
area, the game of basketball and to me personally,'' president and 
general manager Ernie Grunfeld said. ``Red was not only a great coach 
and a player in his day, he also was a great person and a friend.'' 
Holzman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital, one day after being admitted. 
Knicks spokesman Chris Weiller said Holzman died after a year-long 
struggle with leukemia. Holzman retired from basketball in 1982 after 
his second stint as coach of the Knicks. His teams won 696 regular-season 
victories in 18 years, including 613 in 14 seasons with the Knicks. 
In five of Holzman's years as coach, the Knicks won 50 or more games 
and had a club-record 60 victories in the 1969-70 season. Holzman 
took stars such as DeBusschere, Monroe, Willis Reed, Bill Bradley, 
Walt Frazier, Dick Barnett and Jerry Lucas and blended them into a 
group that became appreciated for its unselfish play and tight defense. 
Phil Jackson, who played for Holzman before carving his own coaching 
niche with the Chicago Bulls by winning six NBA titles, said he ``learned 
about putting energy into the team aspect of what we did as a New 
York Knick team _ what we took pride in. We'd come back to the huddle 
and we'd talk about defense for 30-35 seconds. As it was winding down, 
he'd say `What kind of offense do you want to do?' ``He'd always let 
us have a large share of the reins and the praise, and I think that 
influence was tremendous for a club that had tremendous egos _ Lucas, 
DeBusschere, Bradley, Reed, Pearl, Frazier. He gave them a lot of 
latitude as leaders and it made the team a leader itself.'' Holzman's 
wife, Selma, died in July. He is survived by a daughter, Gail, and 
one grandchild. A private funeral service will be held Sunday at Parkside 
Funeral Home in New York City.
