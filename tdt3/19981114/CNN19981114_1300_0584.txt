Ritalin is considered a safe drug overall, but now, the American heart 
association has come up with some tips that could make it even safer. 
Dr. Steve Salvatore reports. Well, it was constant fijting not being 
able to focus. Ritalin is part of a class of drugs called psychotropics. 
Now, because of reports of sudden death, the American heart association 
is issuing guidelines for the proper monitoring of the medications. 
The major thrust of our guidelines was to tell people they don't have 
to do extensive testing on children before prescribing these medications. 
According to the guidelines, before starting treatment, a careful 
medical and family history should be obtained, paying special attention 
to heart problems like palpitations, heart conduction problems or 
fainting spells. If anything is found, the patient should be referred 
to a cardiologist before starting the medication. Once the medication 
is started, patients should discuss any new symptoms they develop. 
And a complete physical exam should be performed, paying special attention 
to heart rate and blood pressure. Patients should also inform doctors 
if they're taking any new medications. And an electrocardiogram should 
be taken before and after starting any psychotropic. Finally, drugs 
that affect the breakdown of ritalin in the body should be avoided. 
But experts say while some psychotropic medications may cause sudden 
death, when taken alone, ritalin is very safe. There's no clear evidence 
in the literature that ritalin is associated with a higher incidence 
of sudden death in children. Still, Brandon's grandmother was concerned 
about side effects. I just hated the idea of putting him on medication. 
I had no idea what side effects, if any, there were going to be. The 
guidelines come one week before the national institutes of health 
consensus conference on adhd and the use of ritalin as a treatment. 
In Brandon's case, it was worth it. Now that I took that ritalin, 
it's like I'm a reading machine. I keep reading and reading and reading. 
The new guidelines will only make taking his medication a little safer.
