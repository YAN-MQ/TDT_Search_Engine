Accelerating a push to expand gay rights ahead of the new millennium, 
the Dutch Cabinet has approved a plan to let homosexuals _ who already 
may marry here _ adopt children. The legislation, approved late Friday 
by top ministers of the coalition government led by Prime Minister 
Wim Kok, would restrict adoptions to Dutch children. It will go before 
parliament, probably early in 1999, in a drive to have it become law 
by Jan. 1, 2000. Under the proposal, gays and lesbians would not be 
allowed to adopt children from abroad out of respect for other countries' 
laws, and out of concern that international adoption agencies would 
stop approving adoptions to all Dutch couples, heterosexuals included. 
The plan would limit the right to adopt to homosexual couples who 
have lived together for at least three years and together have cared 
for the child for a full year. It would not require a couple to marry 
or legally register their partnership. Prospective gay parents would 
have to demonstrate in court that the child they wish to adopt would 
be better off with them, Kok said. The legislation, said to have broad 
backing in parliament, revives a push that began several years ago 
to further expand the rights granted under Dutch law to homosexuals. 
A new Dutch law took effect on Jan. 1 permitting same-sex couples 
to marry and giving them the same pension, social security and inheritance 
rights as a married heterosexual couple. There was no discernible 
protest over Friday's Cabinet approval in the liberal Netherlands, 
which is among the few countries to allow same-sex marriage and which 
has welcomed homosexuals to serve openly in the military since the 
1970s. Recent public opinion surveys have shown that seven in 10 Dutch 
people think homosexuals could make good parents. In the past, however, 
Dutch bishops have been among those opposed to homosexual adoption 
on moral and biblical grounds. Denmark, Norway and Sweden also legally 
recognize gay partnerships but have not allowed them to adopt. In 
the United States, matters of marriage and adoption are overseen by 
states and hashed out in the courts; some U.S. states allow homosexual 
adoption and a few forbid it. Germany's new center-left government 
indicated this week that it intends to grant some sort of legal status 
to same-sex couples, but not an outright ``gay marriage'' and not 
the right to adopt children. In France, a bill aimed at giving legal 
status to unmarried couples has triggered fierce debate and street 
protests amid fears among conservatives that it could legalize homosexual 
marriage and lead to gay adoption.
