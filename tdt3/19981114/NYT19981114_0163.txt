For more than 300 years, the parish of Trinity Church, the landmark 
that sits at the head of Wall Street, has been a force in the development 
of the city. The first outpost of the Anglican faith in the Colonies, 
it once owned all the land from Fulton to Christopher streets and 
from Broadway to the Hudson River. Over the centuries it has given 
away $3 billion, helping start more than 1,200 churches, schools, 
universities and hospitals. Today, the parish still owns 5.5 million 
square feet of commercial real estate in lower Manhattan. But for 
all its riches and enduring influence, at the parish's core is a small 
Episcopal church where people gather for communal suppers, coffee 
hours and altar guild meetings, where the gyrations of the nearby 
stock market seem remote. Now the church faces an unfamiliar challenge, 
one more common to fledgling congregations: how to be the spiritual 
heart of its surrounding neighborhood. For decades, there was little 
need to cater to local residents because, until the construction of 
Battery Park City and the conversion of commercial buildings into 
apartment houses, there were no local residents to speak of. ``Trinity 
was first a local church before it was a national or international 
institution,'' said the Rev. Samuel Johnson Howard, who has been vicar 
of the church for 11 months. ``Now, at last, we see the possibility 
of having a positive impact on the spiritual life of the immediate 
community again.'' So church leaders are seeking ways to reach out 
to newcomers without ignoring current parishioners, a remarkably diverse 
group drawn from many different and sometimes distant locales. Much 
of the responsibility for recruiting new members falls to Howard. 
``A lot of my time,'' he said, ``has been occupied in trying to figure 
out just who is in the neighborhood and decide on ways we can reach 
them, serve them and meet their spiritual needs.'' For now, he is 
trying a direct approach, especially with the residents of Battery 
Park City, where he lives. Though he concedes that his success has 
been limited, he says he sees reason for hope. ``My wife and I have 
made it a real point to entertain people around us,'' he said, ``to 
make friends, to try to develop connections. Once you get behind their 
door, you develop a relationship.'' That strategy tipped the balance 
for Scott Morrison, 35, a senior vice president at Schroders &AMP; 
Co., an investment bank, and his wife, Laura, 32, a managing director 
of the New York Stock Exchange. They live in Battery Park City and 
spent months visiting churches before settling on Trinity. ``The week 
after we got there, Father Howard invited us and three other young 
couples to his house for dinner,'' Morrison said. ``It was just a 
social get-together, and was an unexpectedly nice way to meet new 
people. It's funny how a church can make a big world into a small 
world.'' Howard and Pam Guyot, the church's director of market planning, 
are also trying a more scientific approach to attract new members. 
They commissioned a demographic report of the neighborhood south of 
Canal Street, including TriBeCa, Wall Street and Battery Park City, 
which was completed last week. ``We have learned some interesting 
thing about these folks,'' Howard said. ``On the whole they are fairly 
young, under 40, and include an above-average number of singles. It 
is an affluent area and a very educated one, and the number of people 
who identified themselves as Episcopalians is almost 50 percent higher 
than it is in the general population.'' ``What that means is as we 
begin to identify the spiritual needs of people in an area like this, 
we need to identify touchstone issues,'' he continued. ``I expect 
the big ones will include finding companionship and issues of aging 
parents.'' But officials are adamant that the church's backbone, its 
current roll of 750 members, not be ignored. ``The only thing that 
is a bigger priority is taking care of the people who are already 
here,'' Howard said. One of Trinity Church's distinctive characteristics 
is how far people travel to reach it. The Rev. Daniel Paul Matthews, 
rector of the parish, said parishioners travel an average of 35 minutes 
each way. ``There are probably not two children in the congregation 
who go to the same school,'' Matthews said. Trinity's Sunday school, 
which includes children from 6 to 9, has eight pupils, up from three 
last year. The youth ministry, which educates children from 10 to 
16, has 28 students. The geographic dispersion of their flock means 
that Howard and his two colleagues, the Rev. Linda Moeller and the 
Rev. Nan Peete, spend considerable time on subways. ``Pastoral visits 
to the sick or those in crisis are perhaps the most important part 
of any priest's work,'' Howard said. ``In parishes I've served previously, 
I could visit a half a dozen parishioners in an afternoon. Here, it 
often takes a whole afternoon to visit just one.'' Another of Trinity's 
hallmarks is its racial diversity. At a time when black, Korean, French, 
Albanian and many other national groups have their own separate churches 
around the city, Trinity Church draws an extraordinary blend of worshippers. 
Fifty percent of its members are black, with half of those from the 
Caribbean and Central America. The remaining 50 percent are a melange 
of Asian and white, including Hispanic. That diversity works in the 
church is simply accepted, and parishioners see no need to analyze 
it. ``Everyone is just another person here, and whatever you have 
to offer, they reach out and grab it,'' said Evelyn Moss, a member 
of 27 years, who was the first woman to serve as head usher. Lorraine 
LaHuta, director of development for the New York Academy of Medicine, 
who was chairwoman of the parish's 300th anniversary celebration in 
1996, drives in from Staten Island each week for services. She feels 
that the population mix is a major attraction. ``We have a diversity 
of all God's people of all colors and backgrounds, including some 
who are homeless and don't always smell so wonderful,'' she said at 
a recent Sunday brunch. ``I pass a dozen Episcopal churches on my 
way, but none can feed my spirit nor fill my soul.'' In fact, her 
husband, Leff LaHuta, a retired teacher, said: ``It was part of our 
marriage contract that, no matter where we live, we have to drive 
to Trinity. And that was even before E-Z Pass.''
