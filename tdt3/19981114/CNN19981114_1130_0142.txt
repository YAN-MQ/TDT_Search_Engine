Kuwait says it has taken all necessary precautions in case of military 
action against Iraq. Jim bitterman reports the threat of strikes there 
is nothing new. For the better part of a decade, at an air base in 
the Kuwaiti desert, the men and planes have come and gone. But the 
mission has changed little -- to stand ready to answer any aggressive 
move by Iraq against Kuwait's northern border. It's a threat that 
just doesn't seem to go away. The waiting is not getting tedious. 
We'll be here for as long as it takes. Still, for many who live in 
Kuwait, it has taken far too long. Putting up with years of rising 
and falling tensions, people here have grown cynical. Despite official 
warnings about the present situation, there was little sign anyone 
was rushing for plane tickets out of here, even if some americans 
did advance Thanksgiving vacations against the slight chance Iraq 
could somehow breach Kuwait's defenses. If you take that one-in-A-million 
chance, and you say, "well, if I happen to be this person, and my 
wife is here with my child in this one-in-A-million instance, and 
I'm wrong, I have to live with that for the rest of my life. Even 
so, some children, like those from the Kuwait English school, who 
have been among the first to be sent to safer destinations when there 
has been trouble in the past, were out taking their class trips as 
planned. Some people left in February and they realized it wasn't, 
it was pointless. That they didn't have to leave. This time I think 
people are going to wait until they're told to go. At Abdul mohseen 
Al saleh's military supply shop, there were also signs risks are being 
ignored. They keep a good stock of gas masks, but after one showdown 
with Iraq and another, nobody is buying. Last time, we sold about 
2,000 masks when the things going. But this time, no, nothing. This 
time, too, unlike previous confrontations, there has been no run on 
essential supplies at the supermarkets. All in all, those who live 
here appear to have grown accoustumed to living with the threat next 
door, even in times of crisis. In no small part because of those who've 
come and gone, but stuck to the same mission in the desert for nearly 
a decade. Jim bitterman, CNN, Kuwait.
