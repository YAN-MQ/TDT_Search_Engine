The house Judiciary committee is set to begin its impeachment inquiry 
against President Clinton Thursday. Although most of the information 
deals with the president and Monica lewinsky, another matter may also 
be discussed. Bob Franken reports. Less than a week before indpeendent 
counsel Ken Starr appears before the house Judiciary committee, considering 
impeachment of president clinton. He has added two surprises. Kathleen 
Willey. And Webster Hubbell. Familiar names, but starting in their 
timing. The independent counsel has sent four boxes of evidence, two 
sets of two, concerning Willey's accusation the president fondled 
her in a room off the oval office in 1993. The president denied that 
under oath when he appeared before Starr's grand jury August 17th. 
It will be up to the committee to determine whether to charge him 
with perjury for that. You recall that episode? I certainly do. Mr. 
president, in fact, on that date, you did make sexual advances on 
kathleen Willey. Is that not correct? That's false. You did grab her 
breast, as she said? I did not. Both the Judiciary committee and Starr's 
office went to great pains to emphasize this was not a new referral 
of impeachable offenses against President Clinton. It is descibed 
as -- for the third time, Webster Hubbell was being indicted, 15 new 
counts. When I went to prison almost two years ago, I hoped that I 
could start my life anew again. And I'm now of the belief that I may 
never be able to do so. I just do not know. What it's going to take 
to make this matter end. Hubbell, number three from the Clinton justice 
department before he served prison time for charges growing out of 
Starr's investigation, is now accused of perjury, and fraud for allegedly 
blocking an investigation of Whitewater-related matters and the rose 
law firm in Arkansas. Where Mrs. Clinton was also a partner and also 
did some legal work on the real estate deal. Starr forced the first 
lady to testify before a Washington grand jury after billing records 
of that work disappeared and then turned up in the White House residence. 
The Willey material will mean committee members will have more questions 
for independent counsel Ken Starr. And ultimately, more questions 
for President Clinton. Bob Franken, CNN, Capitol Hill.
