The national gay and lesbian task force is calling for national hate 
crimes legislation. Meeting for the first time Friday since the killing 
of Matthew shepard, the group said activists need to build grassroots 
support for such laws. Shepard, a University of Wyoming student, died 
after being beaten last month. Police believe he was targeted because 
he was gay.
