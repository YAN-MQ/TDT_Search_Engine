A new record for a baseball sold at an auction, $126,500, was paid 
Friday for the first baseball ever hit out of Yankee stadium. Babe 
Ruth hit it on the stadium's opening day in 1923. The ball was found 
by a graphic designer two years ago in the attic of his grandmother's 
house in New Jersey. Her husband received the ball as a prize in high 
school. The Buyer did not want to be identified.
