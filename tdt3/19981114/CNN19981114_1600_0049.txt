The international community is taking a wait-and-see attitude in light 
of iraq's offer to resume cooperation with United Nations weapons 
inspections. U.N. secretary-general President Clinton will ask vice 
President Gore to attend an Asian economic summit so that Clinton 
can keep an eye on the gulf situation. Kofi Annan is scheduled to 
meet with the security council in an hour to consider a letter he 
received today from Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq aziz. In it, 
Aziz says U.N. arms inspectors could resume work immediately. But 
the offer may not be clear-cut. A diplomatic source tells CNN an addendum 
is "so full of conditions as to not make it unconditional." A U.N. 
spokesman disagrees. From the secretary-general point of view, it 
seems that the letter that we received from Iraq this morning does 
not have any conditionality attached to it, and it is our understanding 
that that is what the security council was demanding. Compliance, 
no conditions. So now we just have to wait and see if that is the 
council's reading of the same letter. The White House is reacting 
to that letter. Joe Lockhart just addressed the letter. Let's see 
what he had so say. The president met with his security team to discuss 
the events in Iraq. Given the situation, the president has decided 
to remain in Washington to evaluate appropriate next steps. Vice President 
Gore will be representing the United States at the apec summit. The 
president hopes to complete the Japan, Korea and Guam portions of 
the asia trip. That's all I have.
