According to a new report, the United States was apparently trying 
to kill osama bin laden during air strikes over Afghanistan in August. 
Bin laden is considered the mastermind behind the bombings of two 
U.S. embassies in east Africa this summer. "The New York Times" reports 
Clinton administration officials timed the cruise missile attack on 
bin laden's camps when they thought he was there. Bin laden is believed 
to have left the camp the day before the attack White House lawyers 
reportedly concluded before the attack such operations are legal under 
U.S. and international law. U.S. officials previously denied the air 
strike was intended to kill bin laden.
