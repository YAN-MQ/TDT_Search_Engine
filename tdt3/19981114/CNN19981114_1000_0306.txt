Paula Jones' husband says she is, "tickled to death" following the 
settlement of her sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. 
Mr. Clinton agreed yesterday to pay Jones $850,000. The settlement 
includes no apology or admission of guilt from the president. Jones 
alleged Mr. Clinton propositioned her in a hotel room while he was 
governor of Arkansas. An appeals court decision was pending on whether 
the lawsuit would be revived after its dismissal last spring. Mr. 
Clinton's side is expressing relief at the end of this costly case. 
The president's gotten rid of something that's been around for four 
years, that's not true. He can move on. The underlying case, basically 
on the Lewinsky matter, is now done with. And I think the American 
people, whether they view it as guilty or innocence, they are just 
glad to be rid of this so they don't have to hear about it anymore. 
So I think for a president that's in the public light, that's a win. 
As part of the deal, the White House received written assurance that 
the $1 million real estate investor abe hirschfeld offered Jones to 
settle the suit is "off the table." But sources tell CNN that does 
not legally prohibit Jones from receiving the money.
