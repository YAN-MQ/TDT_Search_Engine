When "NBC nightly news" continues -- In a moment, an update on our 
top story. The standoff with Saddam Hussein, the view from the home 
front from the families of Americans headed into harm's way. When 
I feel fresh, I'm always looking forward. Exploring, discovering. 
With always pantiliners, that freshness... leaves you free to be and 
do what you choose. Being spontaneous, taking chances. Only always 
odor absorbing pantiliners... have a unique core and freshweave cover 
that work together... to help keep moisture and odor away from you, 
for that always fresh feeling every day. - Getting close - being myself. 
Alldays pantiliners from always. Feeling fresh is being free.
