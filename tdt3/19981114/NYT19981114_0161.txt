Dr. Robert Silber, a hematologist and educator, died on Nov. 3 at 
his home in Durham, N.C. He was 67. The cause was heart disease, his 
family said. At his death Silber had been a clinical professor of 
medicine at Duke University Medical Center in Durham for six years. 
He was the director of New York University School of Medicine's hematology 
division from 1968 to 1992. His scientific research focused chiefly 
on leukemia and on the treatment of hematologic malignancies. In 1989 
he was one of a group of scientists who reported in the journal Science 
that a drug derived from a Chinese tree had proved to be a potent 
agent against colon cancer in experiments on animals. Born in Vienna, 
Silber moved with his family to the Dominican Republic in 1939 to 
escape Nazism. The family moved to the United States in 1945. He graduated 
cum laude from New York University in 1950 and received his medical 
degree in 1954 from the State University of New York's Downstate Medical 
Center in Brooklyn. Silber joined the New York University medical 
school's faculty in 1962 and became a full professor there as well 
as a division head. Among the honors he received was a Guggenheim 
fellowship. His 1954 marriage to Barbara Carol Antell ended in divorce. 
He is survived by his wife, Barbara Kamhi Silber; two daughters, Andrea 
Dickey of Guilford, Conn., and Laura Silber of Manhattan; two sons, 
Jeffrey of Ithaca, N.Y., and Michael of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
