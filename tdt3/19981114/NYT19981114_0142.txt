Master P, a rapper draped in diamonds and gold who has made $57 million 
this year with the help of hits that topped the singles and video 
charts, made his debut here Friday night as No. 30, a guard for Indiana's 
Fort Wayne Fury of the Continental Basketball Association. The Fury, 
a farm team, is paying $1,000 a week to the man who placed 10th this 
fall on Forbes magazine's list of the year's highest-paid entertainers, 
ahead of the Spice Girls, Eddie Murphy and Leonardo DiCaprio. Of the 
2,808 fans rattling around in the Connecticut State Armory and Arsenal, 
where the Connecticut Pride plays its home games, a few hundred, at 
most, were hip to Master P. Among most of them, the great game was 
to figure out which of the tall guys in red and black shorts and nameless 
jerseys was ``P,'' as he is known. The program and announcer used 
only his real name, Percy Miller. ``He should give away CD's, so people 
will know who he is,'' said Tom Nevins, 35, an engineer at a Teflon-coating 
plant who prefers country music. As Master P tells it, though, he's 
not after adulation in the seats, but rather respect on the court. 
His official biography describes him as an ``actor, director, film 
and record producer, the reigning king of reality rap and entrepreneur 
extraordinaire.'' At 28, he has founded No Limit Records (which signed 
Snoop Dogg), No Limit Clothing and No Limit Sports Management. All 
that did nothing to lessen the burn he had for playing in the National 
Basketball Association. So here he was in Hartford, schlepping his 
own sneakers in a mesh bag, tripping over the power cables as he checked 
out the court a few hours before the game. His only goal, he said, 
was to prove he was serious about being a professional athlete. He 
elaborated, a tad shyly, in the medium that made him a mogul: ``Now 
I'm off the stage. But I'm in the CBA. `` And I'm going to make the 
world say, `Ughh!' ``Now I'm on the basketball court.'' It's unclear 
whether Master P's side job is a con, a goof or a fantasy, but he 
talks about it in only the most earnest terms. ``There's a system 
to get where you need to go at, and I don't mind being a part of the 
system,'' he said, sauntering toward the visitors' locker room, which 
was labeled Women's Shower Room. ``If the system tells me I got to 
go to the CBA and go live in cities like Fort Wayne and get to where 
I need to go at, that's what I got to do.'' And so he has. Master 
P flies with the team, though for security reasons he stays at a separate, 
undisclosed hotel. Although he travels with three publicists, he says 
he is a humble person who likes his privacy. So after arriving in 
Hartford, he holed up at the hotel and ``watched a lot of TV.'' He 
might as well have done the town. The Master P thing was almost totally 
lost on the Armory crowd. ``Who?'' asked Christine Perry, 34, who 
prefers gospel music. ``He's going to be rapping, or playing?'' wondered 
Marvin Lawrence, 43, who had heard his 13-year-old son play Master 
P. Ron Strano, a 47-year-old general contractor, turned to his seatmate 
and asked, ``He's not a gangster rapper, is he?'' Howard Hamilton, 
15, said Master P was one of his top 10 rappers, but gave up trying 
to pick him out as the team warmed up. Master P's entourage kept its 
distance. In the locker room before the game, the rapper was even 
nice to a reporter who did not recognize him without his trademark 
stocking cap and earring and started asking him what it was like to 
play with Master P. As game time approached, Master P huddled at the 
bench, then shoved a stick of gum in his mouth. During the national 
anthem, most of the Fury's players clasped their hands behind their 
backs. Master P settled for hooking his thumbs over his shorts. For 
the first 12 minutes of the game, Master P _ 6-foot-4, 195 pounds 
_ watched from the sidelines. Second quarter, and Coach Keith Smart 
pointed him in. Master P took off his warm-up shirt, revealing biceps 
with two mammoth tattoos, one featuring a dollar sign. He proved to 
be an aggressive but clumsy player, fouling three times in his first 
2 minutes 12 seconds. He committed three turnovers with double dribbles 
and errant passes. On the plus side, he made one of two free-throw 
attempts and got a defensive rebound. After eight minutes, Coach Smart 
pulled him out. He got a pat on the backside from a teammate, then 
spent the rest of the game wearing a Powerade towel on his head. The 
Connecticut Pride won the season opener, 119-103. Leo Papile, director 
of scouting for the Boston Celtics, was sitting courtside and delivered 
a verdict. ``He struggled,'' Papile said. Master P had raw talent, 
he said, but no hope of making the NBA at his age. But Papile said 
it was admirable, even stunning, that Master P was able to hold his 
own among competitors who had been playing full time for years. For 
a while, it looked as if ``C.T.,'' the Pride's mascot lion, was going 
to get more autograph requests. But at the final horn, about 40 youngsters 
surrounded Master P, waving tickets, programs, caps and rap magazines. 
Resisting the entreaties of a home team security guard, Master P signed 
almost every one. Afterward, he met a crush of five reporters in the 
adjutant general's conference room. He said he had trouble getting 
the butterflies out, but still hoped to make the NBA later this season 
or maybe next. ``It's time to go to the wall, now,'' he said.
