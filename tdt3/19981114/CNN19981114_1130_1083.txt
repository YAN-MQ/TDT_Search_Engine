"CNN Headline Sports" is up next. Hi, I'm expecting a fax. Room 212 
wants the ammunition to deal with her toughest clients. Nothing? Davies, 
212. I called earlier. Right, fax. It hasn't come yet. I need it for 
a meeting. Excuse me, miss Davies? It just came in. Thank you, so 
much. Good morning, everyone. Business services by Marriott. If you 
looked into your local carrier's phone lines what time period would 
they place your company in? Why live in the past... when local's future 
is right through here? On-net. Where local, national and global all 
flow over one network, owned by one company. Oh, and did I mention... 
it'll save you money? On-net. From MCI Worldcom. With "CNN Headline 
Sports," I'm Russell Biven.
