New York is a tough town. The planet's most famous intern was cruelly 
reminded of that as she stormed around tony Manhattan stores and restaurants 
last week. The New York Daily News, which featured a photo of Ms. 
Lewinsky looking like an upscale bag lady and a detailed map of her 
shopping and eating tour, chronicled her tantrums with restaurant 
workers, other diners and photographers, and her zesty feasts on leg 
of lamb and polenta with chocolate sauce. Poor girl. No wonder she's 
in a bad humor. Her commercial window of opportunity is slamming shut. 
The nation, once glued to the soap opera of Monica and Bill, has canceled 
the show. Paula Jones has settled. The Republicans have been afflicted 
with a sudden case of realism. And the other ``high heel,'' as commentators 
dubbed former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey, apparently won't 
be dropping. Monica must be in a panic to squeeze the last drop of 
profit from this sordid tale. After Ken Starr wrote up her story so 
voluminously and with such bodice-ripping fervor, Monica and her mother 
realized with alarm that they had been scooped. Surely Marcia Lewis, 
the author of ``The Private Lives of the Three Tenors,'' knows you 
can't write a tell-all after all has been told. Ms. Lewinsky was one 
of the big losers in the election. She lost her chance to be Oliver 
North and rivet the country at a congressional hearing. So now all 
she has to sell is her voice. It is all that hasn't been heard. It 
is a voice that men say they find alluring, not the ditsy Valley Girl 
voice the world is expecting. Monica wants to unburden herself to 
Barbara Walters, to cloak herself in the legitimacy of the interviewer 
to stars and kings. But then she would have to sell an interview overseas 
to make money. There are lawyers to be paid, not to mention Bloomingdale's, 
Ann Taylor, Bergdorf's and personal trainers. She has also been mulling 
an offer from Fox, a multimillion-dollar package deal that would include 
a book, an interview and a made-for-TV movie. It seems to me that 
Monica's best bet to upgrade her image _ from president-chasing vixen 
to victim caught between a warring prosecutor and president _ is clearly 
the made-for-TV movie about the made-for-TV scandal. A good title 
for the movie might be the line that Lucianne Goldberg used last week 
to describe the taped conversations between Monica and Linda Tripp: 
``A lot of pain, a lot of anguish and a lot of shopping.'' Why settle 
for Shannen Doherty or Tiffani-Amber Thiessen when Monica could play 
Monica? (This idea apparently came up in passing with the Fox folks.) 
Monica, after all, did win a sixth-grade talent contest for her dancing 
and singing. She had a speaking part in ``The Music Man'' in high 
school and was voted ``Most Likely to Have Her Name in Lights.'' Her 
baby diva behavior in New York, and the new Vanity Fair featuring 
outtakes from her Herb Ritts epiphany in Malibu, confirm that a star 
is aching to be born. Now comes Ms. Lewinsky in powder-blue chiffon 
cuddling a poodle that has been dyed pink wearing a rhinestone collar. 
(The poodle, not Ms. Lewinsky.) Who else can bring the right nuance 
to the line readings of ``Blah, blah, blah,'' ``Da, da, da,'' much 
less, ``I never expected to fall in love with the president.'' And 
who better to play the stage mother than the stage mother herself? 
They should use, as a template, the unforgettable made-for-TV movie, 
``Tears and Laughter: the Joan and Melissa Rivers Story,'' which starred 
Joan and her daughter somewhat convincingly playing themselves. Monica 
and Marcia starring as themselves would not only be ratings catnip. 
It would be cathartic for the mantrapping mother-daughter team. Only 
Ms. Lewis could do justice to the scene where she emerges from her 
pummeling by Starr prosecutors, with a wheelchair at the ready, ashen-faced, 
showing her best side. Who but the real mother could bring the controlled 
fury necessary to pull off the crucial party scene where she confronts 
Evelyn Lieberman, the White House deputy chief of staff charged with 
keeping nubile babes out of Bill Clinton's sight line, and demands 
that her daughter be transferred back from her Pentagon Siberia to 
the president-trapping zone of the White House _ her rightful territory? 
When politics becomes entertainment, who needs actors?
