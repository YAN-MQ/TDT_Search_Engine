The husband of a Japanese woman who died after hitting her head in 
turbulence on a United Airlines flight bound for Honolulu sued the 
airline Saturday, a news report said. Takamasa Kataura, 34, filed 
for unspecified damages against United with the Federal District Court 
in San Francisco, claiming the airline was responsible for the death 
of his wife, Konomi, Kyodo News reported. Kataura's wife hit her head 
against the ceiling of the aircraft as it plunged 300 meters before 
stabilizing. She had not been wearing her seat belt. Kataura said 
he will specify how much he will demand in damages during the course 
of the trial, Kyodo said. More than 100 were injured over the Pacific 
on United Airlines 747 jumbo jet flight, which returned to Tokyo Dec. 
28 instead of continuing to its destination in Hawaii. United Airlines 
has said the seat-belt sign was turned on after the plane hit slight 
turbulence and announcements were made in English and Japanese alerting 
passengers to buckle up before severe shaking started.
