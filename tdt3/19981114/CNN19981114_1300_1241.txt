Well, it's Saturday. That means college football, and that's where 
we kick off. The fourth-ranked gators are hosting South Carolina at 
the swamp, and trying to extend the nation's longest home winning 
streak to 27. Missouri is back in college station for the first time 
since getting pummeled 73-0 in 1993. Eighth-ranked Wisconsin is battling 
to stay undefeated, but the 15th-ranked michigan plans to get in the 
way. And number 19 Penn state is trying to bounce back from that pounding 
at the hands of the Wolverines last week against northwestern. Let's 
go to work! Here we go! Everybody should be movin', everybody should 
be movin'! Well, they'll definitely be moving today in Knoxville. 
And you can expect a fully loaded neyland stadium. Top-ranked and 
undefeated Tennessee host number ten and also unbeaten arkansas. Confidence 
has a lot to do with everything. They believe in themselves, believe 
in each other, and that'll go a long way. The number two team in the 
country has a dogfight as well. Kansas state welcomes the number 11 
cornhuskers of Nebraska to Manhattan. Now, the Wildcats are favored, 
but don't forget, they have lost to Nebraska 29 straight times.
