A controversial Arkansas ban on a type of late-term abortion has been 
tossed out by a federal judge. He says the measure is unconstitutional, 
and so vague it effectively bans all abortions. The judge says it 
also fails to protect the health of pregnant women. The law is similar 
to one passed by Congress then vetoed by president clinton. It would 
have punished doctors performing the procedure, but not the patients.
