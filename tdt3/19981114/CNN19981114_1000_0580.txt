Travelers soon could have a new expense when they set course on the 
nation's interstate highways, thanks to an act of Congress. Charles 
Zewe has the story. Danny and Brenda voyles have been long-haul truckers 
for more than ten years. When they're on the road, they alternate 
taking sleep breaks -- but not in arkansas. You can't stay in the 
bunk most of the time. The roads are so rough. Arkansas interstates, 
experts say, are some of the worst highways anywhere. Some interstates 
here are being rebuilt. The state, however, claims it needs $7 billion 
to fix its highways and will get only $3 billion from the federal 
government. Simple math tells us we're going to be somewhere in the 
neighborhood of $3 billion to $3.5 billion short. As a result, Arkansas 
wants to be the first state in the U.S. to collect tolls on its interstate 
highways. Congress has also authorized tolls in Pennsylvania and Florida. 
Until now, most interstates have been free, paid for by federal gas 
taxes. Some older toll roads, like the New Jersey turnpike, were absorbed 
into the system. Soon, Arkansas drivers could be paying $2 tolls. 
And they're not happy about it. If it would improve the road system 
-- but if it's just going to go into somebody's pocket, I don't think 
it's worth nothing. Well I'm against it myself. Trucker B.J. Stephens 
pays $550 a year for a road-use permit and thinks tolls will make 
things tougher. We're taxed out to almost to the limit, and every 
time we turn around, it's just more and more expenses. Some truck 
drivers, like Danny voyles, don't like the idea of tolls either, but 
they see a benefit, too. If we get a toll road like that, it'll improve 
the road conditions and make for better driving for me and my wife. 
Arkansas highway officials think it's possible they could have federal 
approval and toll booths in operation within a year, marking what 
some people think could be the beginning of the end of the free ride 
for motorists on the U.S. interstate system. Charles Zewe, CNN, Little 
Rock.
