One of the state attorneys general participating in the tobacco talks 
says the two sides are very close to reaching a settlement. An announcement 
may come Monday. Under the deal, cigarettemakers would pay $206 billion 
over 25 years to the states as compensation for the cost of treating 
people with smoking-related illnesses. In return, the 46 states would 
agree to drop their lawsuits.
