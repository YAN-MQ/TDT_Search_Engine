Central America will receive more financial assistance from the United 
States to recover from hurricane Mitch. In his weekly laid yo address, 
President Clinton said the U.S. will offer an additional $45 million 
in equipment and services. Al Gore's wife, Tipper, toured the devastation. 
The conditions are unimaginable. The government has allocated a plot 
of land, divided into parcels, one per family. Their Shelter consists 
of sheets of plastic. Disease is rampant. The biggest concerns are 
food, water, and medicine. Yet everywhere I was struck by the spirit 
of the people. They are not defeated. They're cleaning up and rebuilding 
their lives. Mr. Clinton says he is considering debt relief for Nicaragua 
and Honduras. Mitch killed an estimated 10,000 people last month.
