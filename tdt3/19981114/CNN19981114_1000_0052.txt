CNN has learned that the Iraqi government is willing to let the inspectors 
back in without conditions. Earlier, Iraq's news agency said Saddam 
Hussein would responds so tifl to a Letter from Kofi Annan. That letter 
reportedly contain as call for the immediate resumption of U.N. weapons 
inspections as well as a review of the inspection program. In his 
first public statement since the restriction on weapons inspectors 
saddam Hussein has said the cries sis would only end in the U.N. lifts 
sanctions against his country. Secretary-general Annan says it is 
up to Iraq to end the confrontation. I would use this opportunity 
once again to urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi leadership 
to take the wise decision of resuming cooperation with UNSCOM and 
agency. I hope that this appeal, which has been made by many people, 
many in the region and myself, will be listened to by the Iraqi authorities.
