Republicans said the standoff with Iraq jufrs an increase in military 
spending. They also cite missions faced by the U.S. military as more 
reasons for appropriating additional money to defense. Idaho's senator 
says the decline in defense spendsing is endangering the military 
men and women. We cannot allow continued deterioration of our national 
security. We must improve our efforts to give our men and women in 
the armed forces the material, training and support they need to get 
their job done for us. Safely, and effectively, whenever they are 
in harm's way around the world. This need is dramatically demonstrated 
by the possibility that we may again be in direct military conflict 
with Saddam Hussein. The radio address outlined republican object 
tifshs in the next Congress. They include saving social security and 
keeping the budget balanced.
