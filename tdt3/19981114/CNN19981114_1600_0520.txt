This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather update." 
Two areas of low pressure will move across the eastern U.S. as we 
head through Sunday. In the west, a cold front moving into the Rockies 
will mean showers and some high-elevation snows. A new cold front 
system is due in from the west, and it looks like cloudy skies and 
rain stay in your pacific forecast for the early part of the workweek. 
A low pressure system should be weakening in the gulf of Mexico, but 
rain is still on tap for most of the deep south. Temperatures will 
be in the 60s, 70s and 80s across the southern tier of states, with 
30s, 40s and 50s to the north. On the extended forecast picture -- 
look for heavy rainfall in the northwest, a mix of rain and snow for 
the northern Rockies and the northern plains, and a heavy mix across 
the Great Lakes on Monday. Thunderstorms could be possible across 
Florida ending by Tuesday. Heavy rainfall, though, remains in your 
pacific northwest forecast for tuesday, gradually tapering off as 
we head into Wednesday. Some snow and showers can be expected for 
the northern plains into lake superior. The extended forecast for 
more than 7,000 cities is at CNN.com.
