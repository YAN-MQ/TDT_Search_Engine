Bangladeshi authorities Saturday ordered all fishing boats and trawlers 
in the Bay of Bengal to stay close to the coast after a depression 
was reported moving toward the arch of Bangladesh. A special weather 
bulletin said that the western, central and southern parts of the 
bay were experiencing low pressure 4 P.M. local time (1000 GMT) Saturday 
about 1100 km (680 miles) from the southeastern port city of Chittagong. 
The depression would move to the northwest, meteorological officials 
said. The maximum wind speed recorded within the 44 square km (18 
square miles) depression center is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) 
per hour, rising to 50 kmph (31 miles) in gust or squalls. The sea 
will remain moderate, the bulletin said. (hs, nnm)
