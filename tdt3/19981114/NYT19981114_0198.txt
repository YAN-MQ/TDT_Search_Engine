It seemed only yesterday, though it was really 10 years ago, that 
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., believed he could run a campaign 
his way _ or more precisely, the way of his wife and chief political 
adviser, Elizabeth. Back then, the senior senator could afford to 
be, well, the senior senator, which is to say capable of the kind 
of off-the-cuff intellectual candor that, in today's world of brass-knuckles 
politics, would probably find its way into a negative commercial by 
his opponent. Moynihan tells this story to make the point: In 1988, 
during his second re-election campaign, he was making a swing through 
Warren County, where residents were concerned about PCB contamination 
in the Hudson River. Although Moynihan had helped obtain $15 million 
to dredge the toxic sediments, no landfill had been found to dump 
them in. ``I said, `Well, there is no problem,''' Moynihan recalled. 
```There is plenty of room in Hamilton County.' And on the way out, 
Liz said, `Well OK, you just lost Hamilton County.' And indeed I did.'' 
Moynihan could afford the loss, since he carried all 61 of the state's 
remaining counties. But as he reflected the other day on his 22 years 
in the Senate and 40 years in politics and government, Moynihan, 71, 
acknowledged that his kind of courtly politicking would probably be 
drowned out in today's world of cut-and-slash campaigning. And though 
he does not quite say it, he suggested that his distaste for that 
style of politics was a reason for his decision to retire when his 
fourth term ends in 2000. ``I think that's the way it's going to be,'' 
he said of the negative campaigning that seemed to dominate congressional 
races around the nation this year. ``I don't think we could do our 
thing our way anymore.'' That was just one observation offered by 
the senior senator in a 90-minute inther day on his 22 years in the 
Senate and 40 years in politics and government, erview at his Capitol 
Hill office last week, where the conversation ranged, as is Moynihan's 
wont, across a galaxy of subjects. He was dressed for the occasion 
in his usual college-campus garb: tan suede shoes, charcoal-gray pants, 
a green-and-brown tweed jacket with green bow tie and oversized tortoise-shell 
glasses. The office was lined with books, many of them by him. (He 
has written or edited 18.) Over the fireplace hung a painting of Jack 
Butler Yeats, an Irish painter who was the father of the poet, William, 
and beside his wingback chair stood an eerie-looking mannequin that 
was meant to resemble Thomas Jefferson. Though he says his health 
is good, Moynihan is no longer the picture of vim and vigor. His gait 
is slow and labored, and he sometimes needs help negotiating steps. 
But he remains as puckish as ever, to the pleasure and no doubt occasional 
dismay of his staff. When, for example, his receptionist notified 
him of a coming meeting on ``fair taxes,'' Moynihan trained a professorial 
gaze on the young woman and said, ``Fair taxes? An oxymoron if I ever 
heard one. Do you know what an oxymoron is?'' Silence, a nervous smile. 
``Fair taxes,'' he finally said. ``That's an oxymoron.'' Moynihan, 
who was first elected to the Senate in 1976, said he and his wife 
had ``made up our mind'' after his last election, in 1994, to not 
run again, though he continued to hint that he might seek a fifth 
term. Asked why he continued to do limited fund raising if he knew 
he would not run again, Moynihan said his campaign organization has 
continued to do some promotional work for him. ``You need a certain 
amount of walking-around money in this job,'' he said. Moynihan said 
he had no regrets about his Senate tenure except, perhaps, his vote 
against using military force to push Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in 
1991. Asked if he now supports using military force against Saddam 
Hussein, Moynihan said yes, but only if the ultimate goal was to dislodge 
the Iraqi dictator from power. ``You have to change the regime,'' 
he said. ``The regime has made very clear that it does not keep its 
agreements.'' As for accomplishments, he takes pride in many, and 
his work bringing home money for big public works projects stands 
near the top. He was the main author of a 1991 law that changed the 
way the federal government financed highway and mass transit programs 
and that, not coincidentally, diverted significant sums to New York. 
But Moynihan lamented the growing inability of New York and other 
big cities to complete the kinds of monumental projects, like the 
West Side Highway in Manhattan, that in his mind change urban landscapes 
for the better and that ``people remember you for.'' ``We have a political 
rewards system that changed,'' he said. ``People began to acquire 
prestige by what they could prevent from happening. Public works got 
associated with the bad old day of Tammany Hall.'' Moynihan also warned 
that New York City would lose its competitive edge if it continued 
to get less than its share of federal money. For 22 years, he has 
helped publish an annual report showing that New York sends more tax 
dollars to Washington than it gets back in federal aid. ``We have 
that basic capital deficit,'' he said. ``And we have an attention 
deficit. In Washington, we are thought to be much better off than 
we are.'' Reflecting on this month's congressional elections, Moynihan 
said the Republicans may have hurt themselves by running advertisements 
making an issue of President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
The public's response was to tell Republican leaders, ``Get rid of 
it,'' he said, meaning the impeachment proceedings against the president. 
``And I expect they will.'' Though he has spent two decades in Congress, 
Moynihan _ who has also been an adviser to four presidents, ambassador 
to India and professor of urban studies at Harvard _ may be best remembered 
for his writings on race, ethnicity and social policy. It was as an 
aide to President Lyndon Johnson that Moynihan wrote a now-famous 
report warning that rising illegitimacy rates among inner-city blacks 
would deepen their poverty. Though Moynihan was accused then of blaming 
the victim, his thesis is now widely accepted _ a fact he proudly 
noted as he showed a visitor a graph from that 1965 report. Then in 
1969, Moynihan wrote an internal memorandum counseling President Richard 
Nixon to calm the nation's passions over race. In a much-quoted phrase, 
Moynihan said that race relations might benefit from a period of ``benign 
neglect,'' by which he apparently meant that the president should 
allow the heated rhetoric to cool. The statement was interpreted by 
some critics as calling for the neglect of black Americans, and they 
accused Moynihan of racism. Moynihan fretted then that such attacks 
had ruined him in the Democratic Party. And he clearly still feels 
the sting today, asking a reporter during the interview not to discuss 
the issue. But the problems of the poor also clearly remain on his 
mind. He warned in the interview that the sweeping 1996 welfare law 
that set five-year time limits on benefits might have gone too far 
and could cause ``a huge hidden calamity'' in a few years. And he 
asserted that his proposal to allow taxpayers to invest part of their 
Social Security taxes in interest-bearing accounts could create a 
new class of people who could leave sizable estates for their children. 
``I think that could have more effect on race in this country than 
anything else we're talking about,'' he said. Asked about his final 
two years in the Senate, Moynihan talked about his most recent book, 
``Secrecy: The American Experience,'' and about wanting to pass his 
bill to declassify many government documents and make it harder for 
the government to keep secrets. ``Democracy needs to be as open as 
it can be,'' he said.
