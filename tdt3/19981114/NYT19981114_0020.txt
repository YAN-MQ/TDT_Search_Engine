Red Holzman, the Hall of Fame coach who led the New York Knicks to 
their only two National Basketball Association championships, died 
Friday night at Long Island Jewish Hospital. He was 78. Holzman, whose 
wife, Selma, died in July, died of complications from leukemia, according 
to their daughter, Gail. When he retired from coaching in 1982, Holzman 
was the second-winningest coach in NBA history, with a .535 winning 
percentage. His 696 victories in regular-season play were second then 
only to Red Auerbach's 938, and the number of his triumphs as a Knick 
coach _ 613, by far the most in club history _ was retired on a Knick 
jersey and raised to the Madison Square Garden rafters in 1990. Holzman 
was the molder, conductor and architect of one of the most unusual, 
most thrilling and, for the involved basketball fan, most gratifying 
teams ever assembled. The 1970 and 1973 championship Knick teams _ 
the team lost in the finals in 1972 _ featured, in one or both seasons, 
Willis Reed at center; Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusschere, Cazzie Russell 
and Jerry Lucas at the forwards, and Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe and 
Dick Barnett at the guards. The teams brought an excitement to the 
Garden that the so-called Mecca of Basketball had rarely seen from 
hometown professional play. The Knicks beat the Los Angeles Lakers 
of Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Elgin Baylor in a grueling seven-game 
series for their first title, and Holzman was named coach of the year. 
They beat the Lakers again in 1973, this time in five games. Holzman 
was voted to the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., in 
1991, on the strength of his ability to successfully instill the basic 
precepts of the game into his team, and that was teamwork. ``I don't 
think there is such a thing as a coaching genius,'' Holzman said, 
``just hard workers.'' Holzman's hard work revolved around the fundamentals 
of the game. ``I stressed defense _ pressure defense,'' he once said. 
``And team basketball. And, on offense, moving the ball to hit the 
open man.'' In huddles he would sometimes let his players devise plays 
to create baskets. As for defense, however, he was the sole voice. 
Holzman, a City College of New York all-American, a pioneer player 
in the NBA with the Rochester Royals and a former coach with the Milwaukee 
and St. Louis Hawks, had been a scout for the Knicks when, in December 
1967, the team owner, Ned Irish, decided to replace the coach, Dick 
McGuire. The team was in last place, and Irish decided to reach out 
to the nearest candidate, which he presumed to be Holzman. Holzman 
was not interested. ``I like scouting,'' he said. But Irish persisted. 
``And I realized that if I didn't take the coaching job,'' Holzman 
said, ``I might not have any job.'' Holzman began his Knick reign 
by fining several players for coming late to his first practice. The 
fines were for $10 each, but they set a tone. To some, Holzman could 
be quite tough. ``During Red's early years, he was by design a superauthoritarian,'' 
Bradley said, ``and I was one of his targets for abuse. I would go 
for days without speaking to him. But his manner changed after we 
won the championship in 1970, and he became downright paternal and 
kind. Playing basketball became more fun than I had ever imagined.'' 
But on the sideline, the tail of Holzman's suit jacket flapping in 
the imaginary wind, he could be vociferous, particularly to referees. 
But he always seemed to keep his poise and sense of humor. On the 
surface, Holzman seemed an uncomplicated man, but he had many layers. 
He liked to tell reporters that he was boring, and that they should 
look elsewhere for the good stories. One writer wrote a column in 
which he imagined Holzman disappearing in his office in a cloud of 
humility. But indeed he understood his value, and had a wide range 
of interests: he read history books and detective novels, and he was 
a lover of films, particularly the old ones, and of good food and 
drink. He and his wife bought a house in Cedarhurst, N.Y., in the 
affluent Five Towns area of Long Island in the 1950s, and stayed there 
all their lives, raising Gail, their only child. But the house was 
as understated as Red Holzman's life seemed _ away from the basketball 
court, that is. He had nine suits, he said, all the same color. ``Who's 
looking?'' he wanted to know. He ordered his clothes by mail. ``They 
know my size,'' he said. And he was a street philosopher of sorts, 
with such homemade axioms as ``Never let a bald barber cut your hair, 
he has no respect for it. After the Knicks made the playoffs in the 
season in which Holzman took over the club, he agreed to stay on as 
coach. In December of the next season, the team traded for DeBusschere, 
giving the Knicks a tremendous force around the basket, as a defensive 
forward and long-range shooter. It was the piece that made the difference. 
Later, Holzman helped to engineer a trade that brought Monroe to the 
Knicks. Many thought the Knicks would need two basketballs, with Frazier 
and Monroe both needing to handle the ball in the backcourt. But under 
Holzman's guidance and team orientation, the players fit in perfectly. 
William Holzman was born on Aug. 10, 1920, on the Lower East Side 
of Manhattan and moved with his family to a tenement in the Ocean 
Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn when he was 4. His parents were 
Jewish immigrants, his mother from Romania, his father from Russia. 
His mother, Sophie, was, he said, ``a terrific cook and made every 
meal taste as if you were eating it for the first time in your life.'' 
His father, Abraham, was a tailor, and, like many Jewish parents, 
discouraged his son from playing sports. But young ``Roita,'' as he 
called him, which was Yiddish for Red _ Yiddish was the language Holzman 
grew up with _ became a standout athlete at Franklin K. Lane High 
School (which in 1977 named its new sports facility the William Red 
Holzman Gymnasium). Red was the tallest person in his family, at 5 
feet 10 inches. He received a basketball scholarship to the University 
of Baltimore. ``But I missed the soul food that my mother made, and 
I was always hungry,'' he recalled. ``I missed my folks. I missed 
Selma. And after six months I transferred to City College of New York.'' 
He became an all-America guard for two seasons there for the legendary 
taskmaster-coach Nat Holman, whose basketball philosophies of aggressive 
defense, movement without the ball, and hitting the open man Red would 
bring to perfection in his time as a coach. In 1942, he enlisted in 
the Navy and was placed in the morale unit at the Norfolk Naval Base. 
His job was to play basketball against other service and college teams, 
and he became friendly with a baseball player on the base, Phil Rizzuto. 
On one weekend pass, he returned to Brooklyn and married Selma. Holzman 
went on to play nine seasons for the Royals, playing alongside such 
stars as Bobby Davies and Bobby Wanzer. He was an integral part of 
the NBA championship team that beat the Knicks in a seven-game finals 
series in 1951 _ and was dribbling the ball, killing the clock, protecting 
the 4-point lead at game's end. He played briefly for the Milwaukee 
Hawks _ he finished his career with a 7.4-point scoring average and 
then took over as coach when the franchise moved to St. Louis in 1955 
_ until midway through the 1956-57 season when, despite having taken 
the team to the playoffs the season before, he was replaced. In 1959, 
Holzman was hired as chief scout for the Knicks, a move engineered 
by his pal Fuzzy Levane, then the coach of the Knicks. In an age before 
mass communications allowed for few secrets of prospects, Holzman 
beat the bushes, traveling all over the country in search of possible 
players. His recommendations included players like Reed and Frazier. 
Holzman became general manager and coach of the Knicks and repaid 
a favor by hiring Levane as scout. But when the great Knick teams 
began to dissolve because of age and injuries, Holzman was fired in 
1977 after the team missed the playoffs for the second straight year, 
and was replaced by Reed. Two years later he was brought back as coach 
and remained until after the 1981-82 season. With a new set of players, 
Holzman, then 62 and the oldest coach in the league, was unable to 
duplicate his earlier triumphs. He remained a consultant to the Knicks, 
and a valued elder statesman. He is survived by his daughter and one 
grandchild. Through the good days and bad, Holzman retained his sophisticated 
yet homespun composure. In winter he played mixed tennis doubles (``the 
women usually beat me, but I give them a workout'') and in summer 
he regularly went to an oceanside club near his home. ``I like to 
go to the beach,'' he said, lighting up a cigar. ``It's a good life.''
