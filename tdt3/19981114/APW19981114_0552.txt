As U.S. envoy worked Saturday on a deal to bring lasting peace to 
Kosovo, a reported shooting illustrated the long way to go until the 
end of tensions in the Albanian-majority Serbian province. The Serb 
Media Center _ which reflects the official Serb view in Kosovo _ reported 
that an ethnic Albanian loyal to Serb authorities was shot to death 
late Friday by ``Albanian extremists.'' His son was wounded in the 
attack, at Prekoluka village in western Kosovo. The two were part 
of local patrols, organized by the Serbian authorities seeking to 
prevent pro-independence Kosovo Albanian guerillas from taking control 
of the remote area. They were shot while at home, but the report left 
unclear whether they were armed. In Pristina on Saturday, U.S. envoy 
Christopher Hill met with Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova as 
part of the ongoing efforts to mediate a lasting settlement for the 
province, whose 90-percent ethnic Albanian majority wants independence. 
Hill said he saw quick movement ahead in the peace process. ``We discussed 
a political agreement, laid out some dates and timetables for work 
ahead,'' he told reporters. ```We are getting to the point where we 
need to start thinking about what this agreement is going to look 
like, to get all the details down because things are going to happen 
very quickly in the coming weeks.'' He did not go into details on 
the peace plan but suggested it would involve all-round compromise, 
saying: ``A lot of people are going to have to make some accomodation 
with the other side.''
