The statement was simple. Last year, In looking at the tattered defense 
he inherited, Bill Parcells intoned, ``If Victor Green leads this 
team in tackles again, we're in trouble.'' Well, look who leads the 
Jets in tackles as they take the field against the Colts Sunday: Victor 
Green, the mighty mite of a strong safety. And the Jets, so far, have 
not been in trouble. Indeed, they have been thriving, their 6-3 record 
tying them for the lead in the American Football Conference East. 
They also have come up with a novel way of using Green, whose overall 
play has been a significant reason that the Jets' defense ranks sixth 
in the National Football League. The 5-foot-11-inch Green, who barely 
weighs 200 pounds, will be asked to shadow Ken Dilger, the Colts' 
6-5, 260-pound tight end, as well as support the run against the outstanding 
Marshall Faulk. And for good measure, Victor, make sure you are back 
in pass coverage when Peytn Manning is throwing deep. Green is one 
of only four safeties in the league who is leading his team in tackles. 
In the 26 other instances, it is a linebacker. When Parcells looked 
at the team he inherited from 1996's 1-15 debacle, he saw a defense 
largely responsible for allowing almost 30 points a game. Green was 
the leading tackler. But at strong safety, with his responsibility 
in stopping the run, many of his tackles were 15 yards downfield. 
In other words, opposing runners were breaking free and making it 
all the way to the secondary. Parcells, and his defensive lieutenant, 
Bill Belichick, have crafted ways to use Green's intense love of tackling 
runners and allow him to do it not so far downfield. When the Jets 
bunch up eight defenders to halt the run _ a scenario they are likely 
to use against Faulk _ Green is part of that package. He has been 
all season. So Green has a team-leading total of 51 tackles, while 
strongside linebacker Mo Lewis, perhaps the most talented player on 
the defense and the leading tackler last year, is second at 45. ``I 
guess my tackling is about 70-30 run to pass,'' Green said. ``My tackling 
carried me through college. I knew I wasn't the greatest athlete. 
Coming into this league, I had to be good at something.'' Green is 
one of eight free-agent starters on the Jets' defense, but the only 
one who was on the team the year before Parcells took over. He is 
from Americus, Ga., attended a junior college in Mississippi, and 
then went to Akron to play under Gerry Faust, the former Notre Dame 
coach. ``I had been a Southern person my whole life, and I wanted 
to experience northern life,'' Green explained of his decision to 
play at Akron. The Jets acquired him as a free agent in 1993 after 
he was graduated with a degree in criminal justice. Green says that 
``week to week, I don't know what kind of defense the Jets will put 
me in.'' That is because the coaches are constantly shifting alignments 
and putting the opposition off balance. It is a difficult defense 
to typecast. At times, there have been four linebackers. After the 
Jets defeated the Falcons recently, Coach Dan Reeves told Parcells, 
``We had trouble preparing for you.'' The Falcons never were sure 
what the Jets were going to do. Green had a sack that game, as well 
as forcing a fumble. He disrupts people with a vengeance, as if his 
entire career is based on overcoming the initial impression he makes 
because of his size. ``Sometimes Coach Parcells tells me I'm too aggressive, 
but I'm very confident in what I'm doing,'' Green said. ``Maybe when 
you've come up after being a free agent, you feel you have to keep 
proving myself. I'm doing that now until I get the respect I feel 
I deserve.'' Still, the Jets did not use Green in such varied alignments 
when Parcells and Belichick took over last year. ``They've got more 
confidence in me now,'' Green said. ``They don't double up on the 
tight end, which they did last season.'' They trust him now in single 
coverage. Green decided after last year that if he were to be a full-time 
impact player, he needed the speed to keep up with receivers downfield 
as well as the strength to halt players near the line of scrimmage. 
He took off-season karate lessons, and spent hours jumping rope. He 
also worked out in Atlanta with about two dozen NFL players, and went 
one-on-one with the Broncos' tight end, Shannon Sharpe. It was a constant 
duel that has helped him this year. He is, by far, the most physical 
Jet in the backfield _ when he is back there _ and certainly a dangerous 
man up front as he attacks the line of scrimmage. ``I don't know how 
much of his talent is innate,'' Parcells said, ``but he made himself 
into a good player.''
