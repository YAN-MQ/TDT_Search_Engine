Paula Jones is said to be "ecstatic" now that her sexual harassment 
lawsuit against President Clinton has been settled. Mr. Clinton has 
agreed to pay Jones $850,000 within 60 days. In exchange, Jones will 
drop her lawsuit. The deal does not include a presidential apology 
or admission of wrongdoing, as Jones initially demanded. A former 
lawyer for Jones says an apology was no longer necessary. I think 
there are significant changes that have occurred. Most Americans probably 
today are more inclined to believe what she alleged about the president 
in view of other circumstances, the Lewinsky matter and kathleen Willey. 
If you try a case, you don't get the court to say, "well, you've got 
to write an apology," all you get is money. So the question here was, 
what was the president willing to do? And does the money speak? And 
I think it speaks to the fact that it's very significant, it's more 
than what she sued for. As part of the deal, the White House received 
written assurances the $1 million real estate investor abe hirschfeld 
offered Jones to settle the suit is "off the table." But sources tell 
CNN that does not legally prohibit Jones from receiving the money.
