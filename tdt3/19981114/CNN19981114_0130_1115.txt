After months of tough negotiations, the international monetary fund 
and several major donor nations have pushed through a $41 billion 
aid package for Brazil. The loans are intended to shore up the embattled 
Latin American economies and help stem turmoil in international markets. 
After the serious reputation damage that the Russian situation did 
to the iMF, it's certainly in their interest to rebuild themselves, 
or rebuild confidence in the multilaterals by helping Brazil avoid 
having a big crisis. Brazil should receive the bulk of the money over 
the next year.
