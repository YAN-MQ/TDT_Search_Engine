As U.S. envoy worked Saturday on a deal to bring lasting peace to 
Kosovo, a reported shooting illustrated the long way to go until the 
end of tensions in the Albanian-majority Serbian province. The Serb 
Media Center _ which reflects the official Serb view in Kosovo _ reported 
that an ethnic Albanian loyal to Serb authorities was shot to death 
late Friday by ``Albanian extremists.'' His son was wounded in the 
attack, at Prekoluka village in western Kosovo. The two were part 
of local patrols, organized by the Serbian authorities seeking to 
prevent pro-independence Kosovo Albanian guerillas from taking control 
of the remote area. They were shot while at home, and it the report 
left unclear whether they were armed. In Pristina on Saturday, U.S. 
envoy Christopher Hill met with Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova 
as part of the ongoing efforts to mediate a lasting settlement for 
the province, whose 90-percent ethnic Albanian majority wants independence. 
Hill said he saw quick movement ahead in the peace process. ``We discussed 
a political agreement, laid out some dates and timetables for work 
ahead,'' he told reporters. ```We are getting to the point where we 
need to start thinking about what this agreement is going to look 
like, to get all the details down because things are going to happen 
very quickly in the coming weeks.'' Heavy fighting in Kosovo stopped 
with the agreement signed Oct. 12 by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
pledging a pullback of Yugoslav army and Serb police from Kosovo and 
allowing a 2,000-strong international team to verify the pullback. 
Some violence has persisted, however, as the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe forms the verifying team, and Serbs and 
Albanians blame each other for the bloodshed. The American head of 
the OSCE verifier mission, William Walker, visited a war-devastated 
village near Pristina, on his first field trip in the province. He 
was accompanied by U.S. senators Tom Harkin and Frank R. Lautenberg. 
The government crackdown on the separatists in the province has left 
hundreds dead, mostly ethnic Albanians, and made refugees of hundreds 
of thousands more. Despite the agreement, the displaced have been 
reluctant to return. ``Looking at the destruction I can understand 
why people haven't moved back,'' Walker told The Associated Press, 
adding that much of the damage was ``random destruction for no military 
purpose,'' apparently by vengeful Serbs. The deaths of two government 
soldiers, killed Friday by Kosovo guerrillas, was ``also senseless 
violence'' Walker said. The Kosovo Liberation Army was not privy to 
the October agreement, but it claims it is respecting a de-facto cease 
fire and responding only when attacked. Authorities claim the guerrillas 
are provoking fights, hoping for a massive response that would then 
lead to new NATO threats of airstrikes against Yugoslav targets. The 
draft political solution Hill is working on envisages a broad autonomy 
for Kosovo Albanians. Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic, rules 
out full independence for Kosovo and this is also opposed by world 
powers because it could only be achieved by prolonged and spreading 
war.
