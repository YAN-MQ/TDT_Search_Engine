As four Central American countries struggle to recover from the catastrophe 
of Hurricane Mitch, the Clinton administration plans to make it easier 
for people from those countries who are already in the United States. 
The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced on Friday that 
it had suspended the deportation of aliens from El Salvador and Nicaragua 
``as a humanitarian response to the catastrophic damage'' caused by 
the hurricane. On Thursday, the agency made a similar announcement 
about aliens from Guatemala and Honduras. The temporary suspension 
of deportations will be in effect until Nov. 23, the agency said, 
when the situation will be re-evaluated. The temporary change would 
allow people who are in the United States from those countries, both 
legally and illegally, to remain here and work without fear of deportation, 
at least for the time being. Similar privileges have been granted 
to people from nations torn by violence in Eastern Europe and Africa. 
Immigration officials were careful to discourage any notion that the 
hurricane-related change, the details of which are still being worked 
out, would mean an open invitation to people from those countries 
to stay in the United States permanently. The goal of the change is 
to avoid further suffering by forcing people to return to homelands 
where destruction, poverty and threat of disease await them, the agency 
said. The most likely vehicle for extending the stays of people who 
might otherwise face deportation is a provision of law known as ``temporary 
protected status,'' which allows the attorney general to determine 
that foreign nationals can remain in this country because of dangers 
in their homelands due to conflict or environmental disaster.
