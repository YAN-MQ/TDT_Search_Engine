President Boris Yeltsin sent a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton 
restating Russia's opposition to the use of force against Iraq, the 
Kremlin said Saturday. In the message, Yeltsin ``spoke strongly against 
the use of force,'' the presidential press service said. He also criticized 
Iraq for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. The message 
was sent Friday, the Kremlin said. Russia has consistently argued 
against the use of force against Iraq, and has sought to play a mediator's 
role in Iraq's frequent confrontations with the West, including the 
latest crisis. Yeltsin told Clinton he hoped that by ``working jointly, 
we will be able to ward off the worst and return Baghdad to the path 
of compliance with the decisions of the international community.''
