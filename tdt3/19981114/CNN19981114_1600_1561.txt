The music ranged from classical to rock, and an unknown group of teenagers 
got the ultimate gig. Neil Connery reports. Hi, I'm Andy Ross and 
lead singer and lead guitarist. Hi, I'm Martin, I'm the drummer and 
backing vocalist. I'm das and I play rhythm guitar and keyboards. 
I'm Craig stalnaky and I play Bass guitar and do backing vocals. Tell 
me why are we controlling our destiny They're otherwise known as alive. 
At least to by appointment to her majesty, the queen. The four-piece 
boy band were meant to be playing rocksdale football supporters club. 
Instead, they'll be on stage at Buckingham palace for the prince of 
Wales 50th birthday party. The band wrote to the queen asking for 
a gig saying, "we are four good lads who don't do drugs, aren't scruffy 
and don't use foul language. Maybe that's where we've been going wrong. 
Anyway, if you can give us a break, it would be really cool. With 
our love to you and the royal family." I think we are all slightly 
stunned and amazed by that. We thought it would be nice that we got 
the letter. So it was like, wow! Alive hoped to land a record deal 
after their royal seal of approval. As for future venues -- We have 
plans for the White House. Maybe the taj mahal, as well, while we're 
out there. Neil Connery, itn.
