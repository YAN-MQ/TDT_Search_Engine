``One original thought,'' said Diogenes in the fourth century B.C., 
``is worth a thousand mindless quotings.'' You can find that selfless-serving 
blast at quotations in the Random House Webster's ``Quotationary,'' 
by Leonard Roy Frank ($45, but it's more than a thousand pages with 
index and claims to contain ``more new quotes than any other book.'') 
The neologism quotationary is a nice coinage, instantly conveying 
the meaning of ``dictionary of quotations.'' Frank's collection is 
rich in fresh quotationage, much more than a rehash of Bartlett's, 
grandfather of quotationaries. This valuable aid to speakers and writers 
cites sources and dates of the original comment or at least a recent 
quoting, so necessary to scholars. The above selection from Diogenes, 
for example, is attributed to a column that appeared in this space 
on April 7, 1996. Unfortunately, I forgot where I found it. It could 
be that one day long ago, in my search for an honest man in Washington, 
I shone a light in the face of an old guy who said, ``One original 
thought, etc.'' (No; I really looked it up somewhere.) This is by 
way of introducing the annual column about gifts of gab. As the Christmas 
holidays approach, language mavens everywhere look for guidance on 
what new books to give to literate friends. A gift of a word book 
conveys more than words can say. Here are two more: A Dictionary of 
Modern American Usage, by Bryan A. Garner, is an excellent work to 
complement your hairsplitting heir's copies of Robert Burchfield's 
third edition of Fowler's Modern English Usage and the loosey-goosey 
but most informative Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage. 
In some entries, Garner's work extends the reach of the prescriptive 
Fowler and the descriptive Merriam-Webster: In about, for example, 
the American usage book deals with (and frowns on my outdated use 
of) about the head, where blows are sometimes dealt. He's right; rather 
than sound like a bully out of the '60s, I would now use the Southernism 
upside the head, which Garner should include in a future edition. 
I think that the difference between enormity, in the sense of ``outrageousness'' 
and enormousness, ``hugeness,'' has broken down and that enormity 
has taken over both meanings, though it is used more often for size 
than depravity. E. Ward Gilman of Merriam-Webster agrees, but Garner, 
up there on the ramparts with Burchfield-Fowler, gutsily holds that 
``the historic differentiation between these words should not be muddled.'' 
As long as you put some thought into your decision, you pays yer money 
and you uses yer usage. (This book sells for $30 until Jan. 1, 1999, 
but the publisher _ Oxford _ warns that it will be $35 thereafter. 
I am planning a similar marketing campaign for a future word book 
of my own, penalizing buyers an additional $5 for every month they 
fail to make their purchase. Subtle literary sales pitch: ``This short-lived 
book is getting rarer and more valuable every day _ grab it while 
it's cheap.'' Does that really fool book buyers?) ``The Big Book of 
Beastly Mispronunciations,'' by Charles Harrington Elster, is not 
coming out until next month (Houghton Mifflin, $14, and months after 
that, still $14, until _ like all the others _ it's remaindered at 
Strand Book Store in New York for half price). But if you get a gift 
certificate to a bookstore, invest in this pronunciation guide in 
January; it's the best survey of the spoken field in years, and includes 
some original research. Take short-lived and long-lived: ``The i is 
long, as in alive.'' That's because they come not from the verb live 
but from the noun life. When you hear a television pundit pronounce 
the i as in give, go livid. Rhyme helps orthoepists. (Go pronounce 
that.) ``There is no day or dem, in academia,'' writes Elster. The 
word should rhyme with anemia and Bohemia. And fellatio should rhyme 
with Horatio,'' he rhymes, taking note of a form of what has come 
to be known widely as ``oral sex.'' ``Anyone who says fuh-LAH-tee-oh 
is speaking another language (and a dead one, too),'' the author opines, 
``treating the word as a foreignism when it is not. That strikes me 
as ostentatious.'' And Elvis is found at last. Is his name PREZ-lee 
or PRESS-lee? Northerners tend to prefer the Z, as did early TV impresarios 
Ed Sullivan and Steve Allen, but the author spoke to the lady who 
runs the Elvis Presley Birthplace in Tupelo (TOO-puh-loh), Miss., 
as well as the people in Graceland, the opulent Elvis estate in Memphis, 
Tenn., and all agreed on PRESS. He then viewed Elvis TV documentaries 
and heard it from the name-owner's mouth: ``In a comedy skit with 
Milton Berle, Berle mistakes Elvis for an importunate fan, and the 
King has to set him straight. `I'm Elvis PRESS-lee,' he says.'' How 
come there is an ee sound in the middle of prestigious, when there 
is none in litigious, religious and prodigious? Because prestigious 
has an accompanying noun, prestige, pronounced pre-STEEZH, and there 
ain't no nouns litige, relige or prodige. Now let's get down to basics: 
how to pronounce the. We all know that you say THEE in emphasis: ``Are 
you THEE Elwood P. Dowd?'' But how else do you differentiate between 
THEE, preferred by Quakers and some announcers at all times, and the 
less assertive THUH, finished with a shy schwa? When this was put 
to Elster by the cameraman on a TV set, he replied: ``Say THUH before 
words beginning with a consonant: You are THUH camera operator for 
THUH TV show. Say THEE before words beginning with a vowel sound: 
THEE operator wins THEE around-the-world tour.'' And that's THUH gift 
list for THEE earnest giver of a language book. ``Words _ so innocent 
and powerless as they are, as standing in a dictionary,'' wrote Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, but ``how potent for good and evil they become, in the 
hands of one who knows how to combine them!''
