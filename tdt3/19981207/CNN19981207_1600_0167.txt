President Clinton is proposing a crackdown on waste and abuse in the 
Medicare system. At a White House ceremony today, the president unveiled 
a plan, he says, could save the government $2 billion in health payments. 
It includes an attack on drug overpricing. According to the president, 
Medicare pays as much as ten times more than the private sector for 
certain prescription drugs. And he says that's "just wrong." We are 
using new authority we fought for to create new weapons in the fight 
against fraud. Beginning this spring, we will empower new specialized 
contractors, Medicare fraud hunters, who will focus on waste, fraud, 
and abuse. These new fraud hunters, by tracking down scams and waste, 
can bring real savings to Medicare and strengthen the system for the 
21st century. President Clinton's plan would eliminate markups on 
drug reimbursements, stop providers from charging for undelivered 
care, and require notification when private insurers pay for treatments.
