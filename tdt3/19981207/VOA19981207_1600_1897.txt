Russian President Boris Yeltsin briefly left a Moscow hospital today 
for a visit to the Kremlin where he fired several top aides before 
returning to his sick bed. Mr. Yeltsin was at the Kremlin for three 
hours, just long enough to fire his chief of administration and three 
other top aides. He then went back to the hospital to continue treatment 
for pneumonia.
