So, how far would you go to defend your most passionate interest? 
A weekend protest March doesn't qualify, not in this league. How about 
a year out of your life, a year this Thursday, in northern california. 
Not just anywhere in that bucolic part of the pacific northwest. NBC's 
Jim Avila. Above the mist on California's foggy northern coast 200 
feet up stands the defiant Julia "butterfly" hill. How dangerous is 
that? If someone was just jumping around up here, it would be dangerous, 
but not for me to just stand here. a 24-year-old environmental activist, 
a preacher's daughter, now living atop Redwood branches for one reason, 
to sabotage the harvest of a Shrinking American rain forest. I believe 
if every person had a chance to spend a few moments where I am standing 
right now, destruction to the world would come to a screeching halt. 
Admittedly idealistic, this Thursday marks one year in the redwoods. 
So long, she has forgotten how it feels to walk. This is my home, 
known as the go below. Supporters bring her food and take away waste. 
She sleeps on a platform covered by blue plastic, her only protection 
against strong wind and cold rain. I had 90 mile an hour gusts I got 
thrown about three feet by the hardest gusts and I decided I was going 
to die. She survived and vows not to come down until the pacific lumber 
company, which owns the 1,000-year-old tree, promises not to cut down 
virgin forest. I was raised to believe that when something is rare, 
its priceless, a Treasure and you take care of it. But the lumber 
company was built on a different premise. A 130-year-old history that 
views redwoods as a replenishable natural resource, and butterfly 
as a squatter. They've taken the law into their own hands, you know. 
They're trespassing. Two sides looking at the same country and seeing 
opposing traditions. Pacific lumber says America is a country of laws, 
and she's breaking them. Julia butterfly cites a tradition of civil 
disobedience and stays in her tree. I'm not putting anyone else in 
danger. I think we are in danger by allowing people to destroy our 
planet. But this lumber company is willing to wait, and so is she, 
a Stand off at 200 feet that may keep butterfly in the air for a very 
long time. Jim Avila, NBC news, Eureka California.
