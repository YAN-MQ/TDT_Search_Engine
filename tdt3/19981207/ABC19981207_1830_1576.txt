Finally this evening, the agony of the national football league. In 
the last 11 days, the out come of three NFL games has been affected 
dramatically by calls from referees. Today, the NFL said it's considering 
bringing back instant replay for the playoffs. Here's ABC's Bob Jamieson. 
It was the touchdown that wasn't which won the game for the New York 
jets yesterday, as the television replay clearly showed. He didn't 
get across. It was a botched coin toss on Thanksgiving that gave possession 
of the football -- and the victory -- to the Detroit lions in overtime. 
It was a catch ruled in bounds when it clearly wasn't which led to 
a New England victory over Buffalo that same week. The officiating 
is at an all-time low. For whatever reason, these guys cannot handle 
the games anymore 'cause the officiating right now is a total embarrassment. 
And to me, it strikes to the credibility of the NFL. We get some of 
these calls every year during big games and unfortunately, they're 
magnified because we're the only people on the field who aren't permitted 
to make a mistake. What has fans and players so angry is that these 
calls have come in crucial situations, affecting everything from millions 
of dollars in legal and illegal bets, to a team's chances to make 
the playoffs, and, ultimately, coaches' jobs and players' salaries. 
I saw it hit the ground. Sometimes people don't understand pressure 
and stress that is placed on players and coaches, when a call like 
that goes against you. You could lose a job. NFL officials seldom 
lose their jobs. Their performance is reviewed after every game and 
the league practice has generally been to do nothing more than keep 
officials with poor grades out of the playoffs. The player was not 
forced out of bounds. Another complaint is that NFL officials are 
only part-timers -- but with only a 16-game regular season, the NFL 
does not believe it realistic to have a full-time staff like baseball 
or hockey. I'm very much hopeful that next year, the NFL will have 
instant replay back. It's time. One of the key opponents to instant 
replay, Buffalo owner Ralph wilson, says he may now vote to bring 
it back. The loss to New England he blamed on officiating seems to 
have changed his mind. Bob Jamieson, ABC News, New York.
