Five Americans and one Russian are on NASA's first station-construction 
flight. A brief look at each: ___ Commander Robert Cabana has wanted 
to help build a space station ever since he joined NASA in 1985. NASA's 
target date, back then, was 1992. ``This is a chance to finally get 
started,'' he says. Cabana, 49, a Minneapolis-born Marine colonel 
and former test pilot, became captivated with flying at age 5. His 
family took him to the Smithsonian to see the planes of the Wright 
brothers and Charles Lindbergh, and ``it's something that just stuck 
with me.'' This is his fourth space flight. Between his third and 
fourth missions, he served as chief of the astronaut corps. ___ Pilot 
Rick Sturckow gave up race car driving to become a pilot and, ultimately, 
an astronaut. The space rookie from Lakeside, Calif., drove a Camaro 
in stock-car races throughout his home state before joining the Marines 
in 1984. NASA tapped him 10 years later. ``Yeah, I've jumped in a 
race car every once in a while just to kind of get the blood pumping,'' 
says the 37-year-old major. ``We still fly high-performance jets, 
the T-38s. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but you know 
it's not the worst, either. They're still enough to keep you awake.'' 
A veteran of Operation Desert Storm _ he flew 41 combat missions _ 
Sturckow couldn't wait to see how the shuttle compared with an F-18. 
He's trained as a backup spacewalker in the rare event one of the 
two designated spacewalkers becomes ill or is hurt. ___ Nancy Currie 
has what the crew considers to be the toughest job: Using the shuttle 
robot arm to lash the two space station pieces together. She'll have 
to rely on a computerized vision system because the two components 
are too big to see out the window. The task, she says, makes her feel 
like ``the whole weight of the program'' is on her shoulders. Her 
11-year-old daughter's advice? ``Be careful out there, Mom.'' Currie, 
39, an Army lieutenant colonel with a Ph.D. in industrial engineering, 
worked as a helicopter instructor pilot before joining NASA in 1987 
to work on the shuttle training aircraft. NASA picked her as an astronaut 
in 1990; this is her third spaceflight. She is from Troy, Ohio. ___ 
Jerry Ross got honorary membership in the ironworkers' union after 
he tested space station construction back in 1985. Now, he'll do it 
for real. As the crew's lead spacewalker, Ross will attach electrical 
connectors and cables between the first two station parts. He says 
the three spacewalks will be ``a heck of a lot more fun'' than his 
steel mill and highway construction work back in his college days. 
``If you design the job right, it's easier work. If we don't, then 
we pay for it in spades,'' says Ross, 50, an Air Force colonel from 
Crown Point, Ind. Ross will have seven spacewalks to his credit by 
flight's end, making him NASA's most experienced spacewalker. He's 
also one of NASA's most seasoned space fliers; this is his sixth mission 
since becoming an astronaut in 1980. ___ James Newman says being assigned 
as a spacewalking construction worker earned him points with his father-in-law, 
a civil engineer. ``He's glad to have a son-in-law who's in the construction 
business,'' he says, emphasizing the last two words. Newman, 42, a 
physicist and three-time space flier from San Diego, has one spacewalk 
to his credit and will have three more by flight's end. This is his 
third shuttle mission but his first with children at home. He and 
his wife have a 2-year-old boy and 10-month-old girl, which made launch 
day tougher than ever. ``I recognize the risk,'' he says, ``but this 
is what I have wanted to do for a long, long time.'' ___ Russian cosmonaut 
Sergei Krikalev is getting a sneak preview. He's scheduled to move 
into the international space station in early 2000. After that mission 
kept getting delayed _ the five-month stint should have begun in May 
_ he was added to this flight so the crew could benefit from his knowledge 
of Russian station hardware. Krikalev, 40, is the crew's most experienced 
spaceman. He flew to Mir twice, spending a total of 15 months there 
in the late 1980s and early 1990s. And in 1994, he became the first 
Russian to fly on a NASA shuttle. He says it will be sad to see Mir 
replaced by the international space station. ``But sometimes to build 
something, you need to replace old things with new,'' he notes. ``Some 
old shoes could be very convenient, but you need to change shoes from 
time to time.''
