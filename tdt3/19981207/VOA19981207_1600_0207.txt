Bosnian Serb General Radislav Kerstic pleaded not guilty to genocide 
charges Monday at the special UN-Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal in The 
Hague. The highest ranking Bosnian Serb to be arrested is charged 
with commanding the execution of thousands of Muslims after the fall 
of the so-called Safe Haven of Srebrenica three years ago. From The 
Hague reporter Lauren Comateau has details. The 50-year-old general 
listened carefully for over an hour as the charges were read out. 
Then before a packed courtroom, he emphatically said he was not guilty 
of directing the execution of thousands of Muslims after the Serbs 
took over Srebrenica. Prosecutors say General Kerstic was present 
at the scene of the crimes when men were separated from women and 
children, loaded onto buses, taken to execution sites and buried in 
mass graves. They say it was his troops that carried out the slaughter 
and that the general was even promoted during the massacre. General 
Kerstic, who acted under the command of former Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic, and his military commander, General Ratco Mladic, 
will now stand trial for genocide. General Kerstic's lawyer, citing 
the general's poor health and the prosecution's lack of evidence, 
said he'd soon ask for his clients release. Lauren Comateau for VOA 
News, The Hague.
