Germany's main governing and opposition parties united Monday against 
calls by ex-communists to grant amnesty to former East German officials 
convicted of such crimes as killing citizens as they tried to flee 
the communist state. Such an amnesty would demonstrate disrespect 
for former East German activists whose peaceful demonstrations led 
to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Volker Beck, a Greens legal 
expert, was quoted Monday as saying in the Berliner Morgenpost. As 
part of a proposed amnesty law, an ex-communist Party of Democratic 
Socialism lawmaker, Evelyn Kenzler, has called for compensation payments 
of 600 marks (dlrs 350) for every month that former East German soldiers, 
border guards and officials serve in German jails. The party has long 
argued against trying officials and the rank-and-file for enforcing 
what was then East German law, including the shoot-to-kill orders 
on the border. The federal Constitutional Court, Germany's nation's 
highest, ruled in 1996 that the trials legal because Wall shootings 
violated human rights. To date, some 80 trials of border guards and 
former leaders have produced hundreds of convictions on charges relating 
to shootings at the border with West Germany. Authorities say up to 
1,000 East Germans died trying to flee to the West during the nearly 
30 years of the Wall. PDS parliamentary leader, Gregor Gysi, on Monday 
said amnesty would help foster reconciliation between eastern and 
western Germany, but that it should only apply to those who were acting 
under orders. ``A soldier who shot at someone trying to flee who had 
already surrendered would also have been guilty under East German 
law,'' Gysi said in a telephone interview. Such a law, however, appeared 
unlikely to get anywhere, with both governing parties, the Social 
Democrats and the Greens, as well as the opposition Christian Democrats 
and the Free Democrats swiftly denouncing the idea. The Social Democrats 
said the proposal showed a ``contempt for basic law.'' The proposal 
only hardened suspicions by some that the party has not fully embraced 
democracy. ``The PDS is and remains a wolf in sheep's clothing,'' 
said Free Democratic vice chairwoman Cornelia Pieper.
