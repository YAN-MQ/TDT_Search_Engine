Hospitalized for nearly two months now, Joe DiMaggio suffered another 
serious setback over the weekend, his doctor acknowledged Monday. 
``Joe has had a significant and serious turn for the worse,'' Dr. 
Earl Barron told the Associated Press. ``The outlook has dimmed over 
the past 72 hours. He's not in good shape.'' The 84-year-old DiMaggio, 
who had lung cancer surgery on Oct. 14, two days after he was admitted 
to Memorial Regional Hospital here, again is suffering from a lung 
infection and blood pressure drop, Barron said. The Hall of Famer's 
relapse occurred on Sunday morning, said longtime friend Morris Engelberg, 
who responded to Barron's beeper message that ended with 911. ``Everything's 
wrong,'' a somber Engelberg said Monday. ``Fever. Fluid buildup. Dr. 
Barron gave me a list a mile long this morning.'' Engelberg, a tax 
attorney, said he has canceled all of his appointments for the week 
so he can be near the former Yankee center fielder. ``I'm just devastated,'' 
he said. ``I cried all day yesterday. I was sick last night. I couldn't 
sleep. My blood pressure went up.'' Engelberg spent part of Monday 
advising DiMaggio family and close friends of his third major setback 
since Nov. 16. And some are flying in _ including granddaughter Cathy, 
her husband and two children, as well as Joe Nachio, who has been 
DiMaggio's friend for 56 years. ``I just don't want him to have any 
pain, that's it,'' Engelberg said of DiMaggio. ``He's a very dignified 
man and I'm going to make sure he's dignified right to the end.'' 
A friend faxed Engelberg Monday's AP story depicting DiMaggio's condition 
as worsening. ``If anything, it's worse than what the report said,'' 
he said. Are DiMaggio's chances of a full recovery sinking? After 
a pause, Engelberg said, ``If I cancel appointments for a week, you 
can read into it. I can't call anything medically. But I'm a tax lawyer. 
This is my busiest time of year. If I've canceled everyone out Monday 
through Friday, you get some idea of how serious this is. ``There's 
so many things I have to do, but I can't work. It's serious. It's 
bad.'' DiMaggio's serious relapses began on Nov. 16, when his blood 
pressure suddenly plunged 30 points and Barron acknowledged fearing 
for his life. But by the time Engelberg arrived the next morning, 
DiMaggio was in front of a mirror shaving himself. The next setback 
came Thanksgiving weekend. DiMaggio celebrated his 84th birthday that 
Wednesday and Barron gave an upbeat medical report. DiMaggio appeared 
to be heading toward such a recovery that Engelberg talked about his 
rehabilitation once he left the hospital. Then the man voted in 1969 
as baseball's greatest living player fell victim again to a lung infection 
and blood pressure drop. ``He takes two steps forward and one back,'' 
Barron said at the time. That was a week ago. Monday is DiMaggio's 
56th in the hospital, a magic number more associated with his major 
league record hitting streak, which happened in 1941. Part of the 
problem is that certain medication sends DiMaggio's blood pressure 
plummeting. That has put the six-doctor team treating him in the position 
of ``reacting to what happens rather than anticipating,'' Barron said. 
``We are continuing supportive care,'' the doctor said Monday. ``The 
outlook is not as good as it was a few days ago.''
