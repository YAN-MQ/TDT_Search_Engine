From Public Radio International, this is THE WORLD, a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI, and WGBH Boston. It's Monday, December 
7th. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, much of the outside world thinks he's a 
wild man, but Venezuela's president-elect promises a people's government. 
Also, four months after the United States bombed a factory in Sudan, 
skepticism remains about Washington's insistence that the plant was 
making chemical weapons. If you are going to rely on the credibility 
of your own statements for justifying your actions, you better be 
damn sure that people can take your word to the bank? First, this 
news. For THE WORLD, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in 
London.
