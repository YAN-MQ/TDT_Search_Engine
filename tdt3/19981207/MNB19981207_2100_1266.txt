If the full House of Representatives does vote to impeach the president, 
the inquiry will then go to the next step as detailed in the constitution. 
A full trial in the U.S. Senate. That could take months. There is 
no appeal. A guilty verct means a new president. Our report on this 
tonight from NBC news justice correspondent Pete williams. It would 
truly deserve the title trial of the century. If house voted to impeach, 
senators would start preparations in January for turning the Senate 
into a courtroom. People 200 years from now will give this event meaning. 
History will give this meaning. We need to take it seriously. The 
Senate tried only one president for impeachment, Andrew Johnson, 1 
oo 130 years ago. The rules are clear enough for impeachment trials 
from 10 other federal officials. Step one, send a formal sum-ons to 
the president, giving him 20 days to respond to the charges in writing. 
The prosecutors, members of the house chosen when the impeachment 
articles passed, send the Senate their police. The president's lawyers 
file legal motions hoping to get evidence or the charges themselves 
dismissed. If that doesn't work, step four, the full Senate trial, 
probably by mid february to decide the president's fate. The Supreme 
Court's chief justice William rehnquist would reside the house members 
acting as prosecutors and the president's lawyers would sit at special 
tables set up on the Senate floor. Each side presenting and cross-examining 
witnesses. The senators themselves listen to evidence and vote to 
resolve legal disputes, but other than that, they don't speak, addressing 
their questions to witnesses in writing. It ice a 2/3 vote to convict 
on any impeachment count. That's 767 -- 67. If convicted on any count, 
the president would immediately leave office. The Senate could also 
forbid him to hold any other federal job. He would have no right to 
appeal. Pete Williams, NBC news at the capital.
