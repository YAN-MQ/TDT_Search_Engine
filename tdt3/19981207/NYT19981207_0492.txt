Here is a great war story. On one side is Amazon.com, the giant online 
bookseller (market value $5.5 billion), led by its 35-year-old Seattle-based 
founder, Jeffrey Bezos. On the other side is Barnesandnoble.com, the 
small but aggressive No. 2 with the brand name and a very rich partner 
(Bertelsmann AG), led by our subject today, Jonathan Bulkeley. Bulkeley, 
38, who started America Online's British operation, was hired last 
month in an attempt to make Bezos as miserable as possible. He starts 
Jan. 4 at the new Barnesandnoble.com headquarters on Ninth Avenue 
at 15th Street, in a Port Authority warehouse renovated into a postmodern 
lair of exposed computer cables and sleek cement floors. Thomas Middelhoff, 
the Bertelsmann chief executive who hired him _ and invested $300 
million for a 50 percent stake in Barnesandnoble.com _ said Monday 
that Bulkeley was ``the answer to Jeff Bezos. The future will show 
who will be better, Jeff or Jonathan. Personally, I bet on Jonathan. 
Jonathan is one of the reasons that Bertelsmann invested so heavily 
in the Barnesandnoble.com venture. I believe that for the first time 
ever Jeff will have real competition.'' The response from Bezos? Kay 
Dangaard, his spokeswoman: ``About 18 months ago, somebody said we 
were Amazon.toast because Barnes &AMP; Noble was coming online. And 
18 months later, we're 12 times bigger than Barnesandnoble.com. I 
think it's wonderful to be in a position where other people are trying 
to be you.'' So there was Bulkeley in his office last week, sounding 
necessarily tough. ``It's early,'' he said. ``We're motivated. We've 
got a killer team.'' He estimated Barnesandnoble.com had about 10 
percent of the online bookstore market compared to what he said was 
Amazon.com's 80 percent, although no one knows for sure. Interestingly, 
Bulkeley was working at America Online's Virginia headquarters in 
1994 when AOL called Barnes &AMP; Noble to set up an online bookstore. 
``They never called back,'' he said. In 1994 Amazon.com was up and 
running; Barnes &AMP; Noble finally crept online in 1997. ``But let's 
take this all in perspective,'' Bulkeley said. ``Three years does 
not end the war.'' Mr. Bulkeley ticked off what he saw as the advantages 
of Barnesandnoble.com: Some 4.5 million titles compared with Amazon.com's 
3 million; better access to out-of-print, used and rare books, and 
a brand name that will mean something to the millions of new customers 
expected to buy online in the coming years. Industry analysts describe 
Amazon.com's current 4.5 million customers as the ``Internet elite.'' 
(Monday, in a blow to Amazon, Microsoft named Barnesandnoble.com the 
exclusive bookseller on its MSN network of World Wide Web sites.The 
New York Times has a marketing partnership with Barnes &AMP; Noble 
that allows readers of the newspaper's Web site to order books directly 
from the bookseller.) Bulkeley also said that Barnes &AMP; Noble's 
purchase last month of the Ingram Book Group, the nation's leading 
book wholesaler, had the potential to speed up the delivery of a Barnesandnoble.com 
book to consumers. Right now, if a Denver resident buys a Barnesandnoble.com 
book that isn't in the company's distribution center in New Jersey 
but is available in Ingram's Denver warehouse (one of 11 around the 
country), the book goes first to the distribution center in New Jersey, 
then back to the Denver customer. ``That's called inefficient,'' he 
said. Bulkeley's hope is to eventually send the book directly. ``Does 
that win the game?'' he asked. ``No. Does it help? Yeah.'' Ingram 
also supplies more than half of Amazon.com's books, which Bulkeley 
said would continue. ``Ingram sells to everybody and will continue 
to sell to everybody,'' he said. Bulkeley, who is prematurely bald 
and has the manner of a genial salesman, grew up in Hartford, Conn., 
where his father was an Aetna vice president and his mother was a 
national executive for the Junior League. He went to Hotchkiss, graduated 
from Yale in 1982 and landed in New York as an ad salesman for PCjr, 
a magazine that followed IBM's computer of the same name. He went 
on to Time Warner, where he was publisher of a college magazine that 
is now defunct, and then Money, where he sold such Money products 
as ``Wealth Builder,'' a software program that provided early online 
access. ``I thought, `This is cool,''' Bulkeley said. By 1993 he was 
at AOL, where he worked to persuade media companies _ including The 
New York Times _ to go online, back in the pre-World Wide Web dark 
ages. In 1995 Bulkeley went to London to start AOL UK, a subsidiary 
of AOL Europe, which is half-owned by Bertelsmann. In three years, 
Bulkeley got the company 500,000 customers _ and impressed Middelhoff. 
``After one year he was profitable,'' Middelhoff said. Bulkeley is 
married with three children and will live on Fifth Avenue ``if we 
pass the co-op board,'' he said. One of his first jobs is to take 
Barnesandnoble.com public this spring. One of his first problems is 
to figure out what to do about people who can't find barnesandnoble.com 
at all because they are typing the brick and mortar store's ampersand 
_ a symbol that doesn't work on the Internet. ``Give me a couple of 
days,'' Bulkeley said.
