I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
We check your forecast. Temperatures today, it's much cooler back 
over the northern Great Lakes, and extending in through parts of the 
northeast, as temperatures fall behind a fairly strong cold front, 
which will be pushing through by later on this evening. Bringing with 
it, a chance for some showers along the eastern seaboard and back 
into the southeast. Another front is sweeping into the pacific northwest. 
More rain and wind and mountain snows are expected. That snow will 
be heavy in through the northern Rockies on through tomorrow. It should 
dry out a bit, though, as high pressure builds into the area as we 
head on into tomorrow. A look now at the extended forecast -- on Wednesday, 
we'll find rain showers along the gulf coast. And some rain and mountain 
snows expected back through the Rockies, as temperatures remain on 
the cool side over the northern midwest. On into Thursday, rain and 
thunderstorms through the southern plains. Look for temperatures to 
be coldest in portions of the Rockies, and warmest in parts of Florida, 
with forecast high temperatures into the 70s. On Friday, it begins 
to warm up in the southeast as temperatures remain cold through the 
upper midwest. For even more weather information, log into CNN.com.
