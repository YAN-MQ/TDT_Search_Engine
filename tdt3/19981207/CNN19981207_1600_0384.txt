A band of severe thunderstorms moving through Indiana last night caused 
power outages. High winds damages a building at Purdue University. 
Mary schwager takes a look. This is a view of the damage on the roof. 
Winds blew nearly 1/4 of it off. Parts of the building were flooded. 
I think they got it cleaned up. The storm was so strong it twisted 
pieces of the roof into giant-sized metal chunks. When crews came 
to clean it up, students tried to figure out what happened I thought 
of it a car accident. It was too bad of an accident if it was. The 
wind was really bad. In our apartment, we could hear the rain beating 
on our door. We were in the hallway. It's an outside hallway. The 
wind was blowing so hard. It sounded like cans were being drug down 
the stairs. When construction worker Doug arrived at the airport, 
he couldn't find his office. It rolled across the road over there. 
Across the county, downed trees and power lies caused out ages. Most 
of the electricity has been restored. Many people aren't too surprised 
by this sudden winter rainstorm. We've had unseasonably warm weather. 
Anything can happen in Indiana.
