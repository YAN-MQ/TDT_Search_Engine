All offices and factories were closed across Armenia on Monday to 
mourn the 25,000 people killed in a monster earthquake 10 years ago. 
At 11:41 a.m. _ the time the 1988 quake had hit _ a minute of silence 
was observed throughout the former Soviet republic. President Robert 
Kocharian traveled to the towns of Spitak and Gyumri, formerly Leninakan, 
where virtually every house was destroyed by the magnitude 6.9 quake. 
In Spitak, 4,003 people were killed. Armenian leaders and ambassadors 
from all countries with representatives in Armenia laid wreaths at 
the graves of 88 schoolchildren from the village of Dzhararat, 3 kilometers 
south of Spitak, who were in class when their school building collapsed, 
burying them under rubble. ``Many countries, international charity 
organizations and individuals, our Armenian Diaspora with pain in 
their hearts responded to the disaster and offered their help,'' Kocharian 
said in a statement released by his office Monday. ``We continue to 
receive it even now. And though 10 years have passed, we still feel 
that we need it.'' More than a million Armenians are estimated to 
live outside Armenia, many in the United States, and many donated 
aid for earthquake victims. Armenia is embroiled in a bitter ethnic 
conflict with adjacent Azerbaijan, which has imposed an economic blockade 
against and blocked railroads to its neighboring Caucasus Mountains 
nation. With international aid, some housing has been built for the 
700,000 people who lost their homes in the quake. On Monday five more 
two-story apartment buildings were declared ready for people to move 
in. A poster hung on one of the houses read: ``10 years of suffering, 
revival and faith.'' The quake rattled 40 percent of Armenia's territory, 
where 1 million people lived. Twenty-one towns and 324 villages were 
ruined or heavily damaged. Then-Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev 
cut short a summit with U.S. President Ronald Reagan in New York to 
return to the Soviet Union after the quake. On Sunday, Kocharian honored 
40 people who were active in restoration work. Among them was an American 
from Utah, John Huntsman, who has built a construction factory and 
made major investments in Armenia's construction industry. Huntsman 
was decorated with St. Mesrop Mashtots medal, Armenia's highest civilian 
award.
