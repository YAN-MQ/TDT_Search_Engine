The Asian shelf of Facets Multimedia, an unprepossessing, cellar-dwelling 
video store here, has 14 different films by Akira Kurosawa. The Eastern 
Europe shelf has ``Loves of a Blonde,'' an early comedy by the Czechoslovak-born 
director Milos Forman, though his most recent work in this country, 
``The People vs. Larry Flynt,'' is not in evidence, even on the American 
shelf. (Turns out it's in stock, just not displayed.) There's a section 
marked simply ``noir,'' another devoted to animation, a third to gay 
and lesbian films. ``We try not to organize things by `drama,' `action' 
and `romance,''' said Milos Stehlik, the proprietor, dryly synopsizing 
the difference between Facets and, say, Blockbuster. Specializing 
in foreign, independent and hard-to-find classic films, Facets is 
the country's largest video-rental business to eschew the product 
of contemporary Hollywood. It has 17,000 titles available for rent, 
and 35,000 for sale, and not one of them is called ``Total Recall'' 
or ``Titanic.'' ``It's a whole store defined by the fact that these 
are videos you can't get anywhere else,'' said Roger Ebert, the film 
critic of The Chicago Sun Times who is featured with Gene Siskel on 
the television show ``At the Movies.'' Other video distributors specialize 
in art films, ``but Milos has the biggest collection,'' Ebert said. 
``In foreign films he's got real depth. Not just French or Japanese, 
but films from Senegal or Indonesia or Malaysia. Experimental films, 
silent films. Underground films, as they used to be called. If you 
can't find it at Facets, chances are you can't find it. He's really 
making a difference, on a national, even a worldwide, level.'' To 
support its video business, Facets publishes a remarkable array of 
catalogs, some sold in book form: One lists gay and lesbian films 
on video, another, African-American videos. But many of its other 
publications are available free, like the Movie Lovers Video Guide, 
with its bright red cover and its inviting and informative array of 
lists (``100 Best Love Stories,'' ``50 Films About Art and Artists,'' 
``25 Great War Films,'' ``100 Super Kids Movies''). A good part of 
the business is by mail. Martin Scorsese and John Sayles are regular 
mail-order customers, Stehlik said. ``And we get a lot of people who, 
for some reason, are stuck in small towns.'' The shopworn quarters 
are a haunt for film scholars, university professors, ardent hobbyists 
and insomniacs who linger in front of a black-and-white television 
set. The place is a treasure trove, and at a time when video is increasingly 
the only cost-effective way for many films to be preserved and shown, 
Facets is an archive, full of forgotten, undermarketed and underappreciated 
work that has been outshouted by commercial movie making. ``A lot 
of what we carry is out of print,'' Stehlik said. ``More and more, 
we're a last resort.'' Indeed, there's a rescue aspect to Stehlik's 
business. For example, consider ``Le Feu Follet'' (``The Fire Within''), 
a 1962 film by Louis Malle about an alcoholic contemplating suicide. 
``A wonderful film,'' Stehlik said, ``with a really haunting, convincing 
portrayal of alcoholism by Maurice Ronet.'' But it's relatively obscure, 
to be sure, even to film enthusiasts familiar with Malle's better-known 
films, including ``Murmur of the Heart'' and ``Atlantic City.'' And 
members of Malle's family have pulled it from distribution, along 
with some others, to await the publication of a biography that they 
hope will stimulate interest in his work. Hearing this, Stehlik bought 
the extant video copies of the film from the family's American distributor, 
New Yorker Films. All 203 of them. ``That's it, in the country, right 
now,'' Stehlik said. Dan Talbot, president of New Yorker, called Stehlik 
``the Rolls Royce of video.'' ``He's wonderful and important; he's 
a savior of film,'' Talbot said. ``It's astonishing what that fellow 
has put together and made available for people who love film.'' The 
video business is now the driving force behind Facets, but it didn't 
start out that way. Upstairs from the video store is a 125-seat theater 
where Facets shows 16-millimeter films, often to tiny audiences, and 
a 35-seat video screening room used for film classes taught by local 
graduate students. An empty front room was once a live performance 
space; Stehlik's partner, Nicole Dreiske, ran a theater company there 
until 1994. ``It's a little temple of cinema over there,'' Ebert said. 
Stehlik, who is 49, has a story that itself seems worthy of an independent 
film. A trim blond man with an amused but undemonstrative manner (he 
could be a character in a deadpan drama made by, say, Louis Malle), 
he was born in Slany, just outside of Prague. When he was born, his 
father was in Germany. Before he could return, the Communists closed 
the borders, and it was 12 years before his mother could secure passports 
for herself and her son. In 1961 they went to Australia, where his 
father had emigrated. But by the time they arrived, he had already 
moved on to Chicago, where he was working as an electrical designer. 
It was another year before the family was reunited. In the late '60s 
Stehlik began frequenting the Clark Theater here, which offered a 
daily double feature. ``Foreign films,'' Stehlik said. ``Continuous 
shows, till 3 in the morning.'' He saw films like ``Jules and Jim,'' 
``Black Orpheus'' and ``Greed'' for the first time, and ``Shop on 
Main Street,'' by the Czechoslovak filmmaker Jan Kadar, who would 
become a mentor and friend. When, with a partner, he opened a used-book 
store, he held screenings there. When the bookstore went out of business, 
he started a foreign film series in a tiny theater in the Lincoln 
Park section of Chicago. The screen was a bedsheet. Eventually he 
joined one of the theater's directors, Ms. Dreiske, in opening Facets, 
whose mission was to present both live theater and films of the sort 
that couldn't be seen anywhere else in Chicago. (They married and 
later divorced, but their business partnership has survived.) The 
company's home was an unused Lutheran church where the audience sat 
in pews. The films were projected from the choir loft, and the screen 
was put up where the altar had been. Forced to move when the Lutherans 
sold the church, they found their current quarters, a West Side printing 
plant, in 1984. It was the dawn of the video business, but with considerable 
trepidation _ and with the encouragement of Ebert, who assured him 
them that video was the future of film viewing _ Facets bought 140 
videocassettes from a distributor. ``We taped the boxes to the lobby 
wall with Velcro, and whenever someone wanted to rent a tape, the 
film projectionist would run downstairs and get it,'' Stehlik recalled. 
Facets now buys videotapes from 1,100 different manufacturers, rents 
68,000 a year and sells 150,000 more. The company has recently entered 
the licensing business, buying the rights to produce and distribute 
the videos of some 200 films, mostly contemporary foreign titles. 
That's some assurance that the works won't disappear or become inaccessible. 
``I like to think,'' Stehlik said, ``that having the works of Bergman 
or Ozu on your video shelf is becoming the equivalent of having works 
by Joyce or Dickens on your bookshelf.''
