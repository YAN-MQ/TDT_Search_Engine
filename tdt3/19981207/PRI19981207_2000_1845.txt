The latest initiative to bring peace to the troubled Serbian province 
of Kosovo has suffered a setback. The most recent U.S. peace plan 
has been rejected by ethnic Albanians leaders. At the same time, NATO 
Secretary General Javier Solana is warning against any fresh offensive 
by Serb forces in the region. The BBC's Paul Wood has the latest. 
The NATO secretary general's stark message to Belgrade that a fresh 
offensive won't be tolerated comes in its predictions from all sides 
that come the spring, serious conflicts will reignite in Kosovo. The 
Serbian deputy premiere said that if what he describes as Albanian 
terrorists were allowed to strut around, murder, and kidnap, there'd 
be another summer offensive. Against this background, the Americans 
are trying to put together a peace plan acceptable to all sides, but 
the latest draft has been rejected by the chief ethnic Albanians negotiator, 
Sammy Agani, of giving Kosovo too little autonomy. Paul Wood reporting.
