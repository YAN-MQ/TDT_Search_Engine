Still, international financier George Soros is warning that global 
markets are vulnerable. Liz George reports from our business desk 
in New York. When George Soros speaks, markets listen. He's often 
described as the man who broke the Bank of England when his profitable 
currency dealings helped force Britain from the European exchange 
rate mechanism in 1992. This year, things haven't gone so well. His 
company lost around $2 billion in Russia, and now he's warning global 
markets are still bearish. He likens the crisis to a knocking ball. 
It swings around and knocks over one country after another. I use 
that because economies talk about equilibrium, and they sort of think 
that markets fluctuate like a pendulum, sort of swing, but they always 
come to rest, so it's an equilibrium. And I think that idea is false. 
The Hungarian-born financier has often been criticized for making 
huge profits by speculating on events which have led to human suffering, 
but he's unrepentant. I play by the rules, and the rules allow investing, 
buying currencies, and selling currencies, and so on. So I'm really 
just a market participant. I cannot really go against markets. You 
know, if I try to push things in one way and the market going another 
way, I would be crushed. I have absolutely no sense of guilt. George 
Soros has almost become legendary as a modern-day buccaneer, raking 
in billions of dollars through predatory assaults on the markets. 
So does money make him happy? No, it doesn't, but it certainly helps. 
I mean, I actually like to do good, and it enables me to do that. 
George Soros talking in London. For THE WORLD, I'm Liz George in New 
York.
