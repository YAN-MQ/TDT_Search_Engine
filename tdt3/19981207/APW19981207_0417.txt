When it comes to history, Korea and Japan have plenty of the bitter 
kind they need to put behind them to serve as co-hosts for soccer's 
World Cup in 2002. On Monday, they nearly _ but not quite _ succeeded 
during South Korea's 2-0 victory in a second-round Asian Games opener. 
The large South Korean and Japanese expatriate communities in Bangkok 
turned out to support their sides, but the Koreans were better prepared, 
clad in uniforms, banging gongs and drums and waving flags. They split 
into three main groups to cover all sides of the stadium, drowning 
out any cheers that the Japanese might have tried. ``Although you 
can see some Koreans saying, `Japan, go to hell' when they see Japanese 
crowds waving their flags, I don't think it's because of ill feelings,'' 
summed up Lee Yong-chan, 35, a Korean businessman. ``It's more of 
a competitive feeling toward an opponent,'' Lee said. The Koreans 
expressed confidence they would win _ and they did, off star striker 
Choi Yong-soo's two goals. They said to a man that they harbored no 
ill feelings toward Japan, which brutally colonized their country 
between 1910 and 1945. Relations between the countries have often 
been strained since the end of World War II, though the passions have 
cooled somewhat as the wartime generation passes on. Most in the crowd 
Monday were youngsters. For them, the prospect of being co-hosts for 
a World Cup in four years sparks deeper feeling than bad will toward 
Japan. Monday's game was just another soccer match _ and the desire 
to win, against whomever, was total. ``We have to win,'' said Kim 
Seung-joo, 25, a student. ``I don't have ill feelings toward Japan. 
I just want the Korean team to do their best.'' Businessman Lee was 
worried that the Asian economic crisis, which has hit South Korea 
especially hard, would undermine the Cup. Thailand, another recession-hit 
country, was barely able to organize the Asian Games, an Olympic-style 
event bringing together 6,000 athletes from 41 countries. ``I think 
it's going to be like this Asian Games _ we won't be ready,'' Lee 
said. ``You can't get anything without investment, yet that's exactly 
what we're trying to do.''
