The last of six defendants accused of carrying out systematic doping 
policies in the former East Germany has been convicted and fined by 
a Berlin court. Fifty-nine-year-old Bernt Pancill was ordered to pay 
$8,200 and will have to pay court costs likely to be several times 
that sum. He was sentenced for causing bodily harm to young female 
swimmers by giving them banned drugs in the 1970s and 1980s. According 
to prosecutors, the women suffered from such problems as unnatural 
body hair, excessive muscle growth, voice changes or severe acne. 
Pancill had denied the charges and his attorney told reporters outside 
the courtroom he would likely appeal.
