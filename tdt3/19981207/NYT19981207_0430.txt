A year and a half after Morgan Stanley Group, a leading investment 
bank, merged with Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co., the United States' 
third-largest retail brokerage firm, the two are starting to look 
more like a couple. The company said Monday that its three asset-management 
divisions would now report to one executive. Mitchell Merin, who is 
45, will oversee $356 billion in assets by heading the combined division, 
which includes institutional and individual asset management and the 
firm's mutual funds. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter ranked as the United 
States' ninth-largest asset manager at the end of last year. The move 
unites divisions that had remained separate after the May 1997 merger 
of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter. It also expands the turf controlled 
by executives who came to the merged company from Dean Witter. Merin 
will report to Philip Purcell, the company's chief executive, who 
came from Dean Witter. Merin now heads individual asset management. 
He served as Dean Witter's chief administrative officer when the companies 
merged. His appointment comes a week after James Allwin, 45, the head 
of institutional asset management and a Morgan Stanley executive, 
announced his retirement. ``Given Mitch's industry expertise and experience, 
he will provide the right leadership to take our asset-management 
business to the next level,'' Purcell and John Mack, the company's 
president, said in a statement. The consolidation makes sense, analysts 
said. Like all brokerage firms, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter wants to 
increase the assets it invests for clients, a business that generates 
steady fees in good times and bad. Unifying management should help 
to cross-sell products like mutual funds through the firm's distribution 
channels to ordinary investors. The executive changes appear to complete 
a reshuffling of asset-management personnel that had been announced 
in recent days. Richard Worley, chairman of Miller, Anderson &AMP; 
Sherrerd, an institutional money manager in Pennsylvania that Morgan 
Stanley bought in 1996, will replace Allwin as head of institutional 
asset management. Richard DeMartini, who had managed retail asset 
management, was named to a new post developing an international brokerage 
business. Worley and Richard Powers, head of Van Kampen funds, will 
report to Merin.
