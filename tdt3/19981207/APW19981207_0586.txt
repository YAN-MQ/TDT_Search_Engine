The first two building blocks of the international space station were 
firmly hooked together and soaring high above the Earth today, awaiting 
a visit from two spacewalking astronauts to attach electrical connectors 
and cables between the parts. During the 6{-hour spacewalk, scheduled 
to begin this evening, astronauts Jerry Ross and James Newman will 
hook up 40 connectors to supply power to the fledgling outpost. Newman 
likened the job to construction work. ``Essentially we're putting 
an office building together,'' he explained. Two other spacewalks 
are planned during the 12-day assembly mission, to install handrails 
and other tools for future crews. The first two space station parts 
_ the Russian-built Zarya control module and American-made Unity chamber 
_ were connected on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower out of the 
cargo bay of the shuttle Endeavour. The joined modules will be released 
from the shuttle once all of the spacewalks are completed. The components 
were linked as Endeavour soared 240 miles over the South Pacific. 
Astronaut Nancy Currie used the shuttle's robot arm to grab hold of 
Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) and position it several inches directly 
above Unity. Then shuttle commander Robert Cabana fired Endeavour's 
thrusters, raising it enough for the docking mechanisms on the two 
station components to snap together. ``We have capture of Zarya,'' 
Cabana announced the moment the pieces came together. ``Congratulations 
to the crew of the good ship Endeavour,'' replied Mission Control. 
``That's terrific.'' The task took several hours because the two parts 
needed to be perfectly aligned before they were joined, and the pieces 
are so big _ 77-feet long with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ 
that the astronauts had to rely on a computerized vision system and 
camera views, rather than direct line of sight. This was the first 
time such a ``blind'' docking had ever been attempted, and Currie 
was credited with a flawless performance _ lining up the parts so 
they were only half a degree and less than an inch off-center. A problem 
was detected with two antennas on the Zarya module that failed to 
deploy. The antennas must be unfurled in order for Zarya's backup 
docking system to work. That system won't be needed before next summer, 
but NASA is considering having Ross and Newman unroll them during 
a spacewalk. A Zarya battery also was not working properly, but the 
astronauts took up a replacement part. Despite the glitches, NASA 
officials lauded the first step of space station assembly as a success. 
``This is history,'' said Frank Culbertson, deputy program manager 
for space station operations. ``Bringing these two components together 
in this way ... I think is a good omen for what's coming ahead.'' 
NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed 
to assemble the entire orbiting complex, scheduled for completion 
in 2004. Once constructed, the station will have a mass of 1 million 
pounds, be longer than a football field and house up to seven astronauts 
and cosmonauts.
