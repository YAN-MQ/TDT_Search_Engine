The United States scrambled on Monday to keep the October agreement 
between Israel and the Palestinians on track, with Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright warning her Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, 
to adhere to the timetable set in the agreement and not to add new 
conditions. Later on Monday, President Clinton dropped by a meeting 
between Sharon and Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, and 
spent about an hour discussing the new problems in the Middle East. 
With new violence breaking out and the Israeli government coalition 
shaky, Clinton's weekend visit to the region is likely to be devoted 
to damage control as much as to celebration, one American official 
said. Clinton leaves on Saturday. In his news conference with Albright, 
Sharon repeated Israeli warnings that the second phase of the agreement 
reached at Wye, Md. _ requiring Israeli pullbacks from the West Bank 
in return for specific Palestinian steps to combat terrorism _ could 
not go ahead if the Palestinians did not keep their own commitments. 
He accused the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, of ``activating 
and encouraging'' what Sharon called a ``renewed intifada, `` or uprising, 
that represents ``a very difficult and critical obstacle to the continuation 
of the peace process, which we all want to achieve.'' Later, Sharon 
again warned that if Arafat unilaterally declares Palestinian statehood 
after May 4, 1999, when a final settlement is supposed to be completed, 
Israel would annex parts of the West Bank not yet given to the Palestinian 
Authority. ``We want to see the process moving forward,'' Albright 
said at a news conference here with Sharon, and she encouraged both 
sides to bring their differences, about the most recent agreement 
and everything else, to the negotiating table. ``Violence is not the 
answer, differences need to be brought to the table and solutions 
can only come from negotiations,'' she said. Albright dismissed questions 
about whether linton might postpone his visit, saying that the visit 
itself is a part of the agreement. Clinton is scheduled to attend 
a Dec. 14 meeting in Gaza at which the Palestine National Council 
and other Palestinian groups are to expunge formally from the Palestinian 
charter all clauses calling for Israel's destruction. Sharon said 
that Clinton will be welcomed as a friend of Israel. But he urged 
the president not to raise ``false expectations'' among Palestinians 
during his three-day visit.
