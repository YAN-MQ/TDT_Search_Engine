A group of jobless occupied unemployment offices in the southern port 
of Marseille on Monday, demanding a year-end bonus of 3,000 francs 
(dlrs 535). The jobless protest for the time being is limited to the 
Marseille region, but jobless activists have threatened similar actions 
in other French cities, including Bordeaux and Perpignan. The movement 
is similar to one that took place in France last December, with unemployed 
workers demanding a bonus in order to be able to celebrate the Christmas 
and New Year holidays. Last year's protests prompted Socialist Prime 
Minister Lionel Jospin's government to come up with a fund worth one 
billion francs (dlrs 178 million) to help the needy. Jobless activists 
say 15 billion francs is needed to help the jobless this year. The 
jobless protesters were quickly evacuated Monday from the unemployment 
offices.
