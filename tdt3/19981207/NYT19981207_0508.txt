The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 8: Few politicians 
get a second bite at power as quickly as Hugo Chavez, who won Sunday's 
presidential election in Venezuela. Six years ago Chavez led a military 
coup. It failed, but his messianic assault on the establishment captured 
the imagination of poor Venezuelans. Chavez's speeches today are more 
conciliatory, but he still frightens Venezuela's elite and makes Washington 
nervous about the future of a country that is now the United States' 
primary source of oil. Chavez could become a populist despot, or could 
use his mandate to make long-needed changes while respecting the rule 
of law. Washington and Venezuela's opposition should work with him 
to encourage a democratic approach. Venezuela's two main parties, 
which have traded power for 40 years, have squandered the country's 
wealth. Even when its oil was $16 a barrel, Venezuela borrowed. Today 
its oil is half that price, and dropping. Interest on Venezuela's 
foreign debt takes 40 percent of the budget, and 70 percent of its 
people live in poverty. Chavez's campaign program, which contained 
wildly contradictory ideas, was a spending fantasy. Reality will require 
budget cuts, but he can use them to produce long-term change. He is 
right to propose renegotiating the country's debt, and cracking down 
on tax evasion. He seems less interested in the most important change, 
bureaucratic reform. The government pays nearly 2 million people but 
does not provide decent education, health care, transportation or 
justice. Chavez must refocus the bureaucracy to serve the poor. He 
promised a referendum on a constitutional assembly that would dissolve 
congress, which he does not control, and write a new constitution. 
The idea is popular with Venezuelans, who want a fresh start. But 
it could also allow Chavez to close congress and write himself dictatorial 
powers. Washington should make clear it will help Chavez if he respects 
Venezuelans' rights and the rule of law. The traditional parties must 
also defend Venezuelan democracy, which has shut out ordinary citizens 
but has deterred the widespread political violence that has racked 
neighboring nations. The solution is to deepen democracy, Venezuela's 
most important achievement of the last 40 years.
