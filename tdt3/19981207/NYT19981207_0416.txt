In his most tart and aggressive comments yet about the antitrust case 
against his company, Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, blamed the 
government Monday for what has been widely perceived as his uncooperative 
attitude in a taped deposition, saying the real problem was not the 
answers he gave, but the questions he was asked. ``I had expected 
Boies to ask me about competition in the software industry,'' Gates 
said, referring to David Boies, the government's lead lawyer in the 
antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. ``But no, he didn't do that.'' 
Instead, he said during a news conference, Bois was just ``badgering'' 
him ``to give yes-or-no answers when he knew the questions were ambiguous.'' 
Gates has discussed the case before, including at last month's meeting 
with Microsoft's shareholders. But his comments Monday were the first 
time he has publicly criticized prosecutors for their questioning 
of him during his deposition. While gathering evidence for the antitrust 
trial, Boise and other lawyers for the government interviewed Gates 
for 20 hours in August. And as they have played excerpts from the 
deposition at the trial during the past eight weeks, criticism of 
Gates has mounted. Perhaps the potentially most damaging criticism 
was a comment two weeks ago by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who 
is hearing the case in U.S. District Court here. ``It's evident to 
every spectator that for whatever reasons, in many respects Gates 
has not been particularly responsive to his deposition interrogation,'' 
Jackson told Microsoft lawyers. Asked about the judge's remarks Monday, 
Gates said, ``I answered every question, but Boies made it clear that 
he is out to destroy Microsoft and make us look very bad.'' Gates 
spoke over a satellite video link to a news conference held here and 
organized by Microsoft to accuse the government of attempting to try 
the case in the news media. ``They are trying to turn this into a 
P.R. spectacle,'' said Charles Rule, a former head of the Justice 
Department's antitrust division who is now a Microsoft legal consultant. 
As he spoke, Rule was flanked by the leaders of Microsoft's legal 
team and large video monitors for Gates' appearance. ``Our focus is 
in the courtroom,'' Rule said, ``but we cannot and will not stand 
by without responding.'' Since the Justice Department filed suit against 
Microsoft in May, the government has not held a news conference relating 
to the case, nor has it issued a news release, except those about 
scheduling matters. Microsoft, on the other hand, holds one or two 
news briefings each week and regularly issues position papers and 
releases. Monday, for example, the company distributed a 21-page report 
titled ``A Case of Trial in Error: The Microsoft Antitrust Suit,'' 
which largely repeats legal and political arguments the company has 
already made several times. Monday afternoon, the Justice Department 
did issue a one-sentence statement: ``Microsoft's latest press statements 
are another public relations effort to distract attention from the 
overwhelming evidence introduced in court showing that Microsoft has 
illegally used its market dominance to block competition from innovative 
technologies that threaten its operating system monopoly.'' But Microsoft's 
arguments have resulted in at least one convert. South Carolina's 
attorney general, Charles Condon _ one of the 20 state attorneys general 
who filed their own antitrust suit against Microsoft _ said Monday 
he was dropping out of the case. In announcing his decision, Condon 
cited the planned acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. by 
America Online Inc. as evidence of healthy competition in the Internet 
industry. That has been a Microsoft argument since the proposed acquisition 
was announced last week. In fact, Microsoft filed a motion with the 
court Monday asking for permission to subpoena documents from Netscape, 
America Online and Sun Microsystems Inc., which has agreed to work 
closely with the merged companies. ``The parties to the transactions 
are all witnesses for the government in this case, and the fact that 
they are working cooperatively against Microsoft in the area of Web 
browsing software goes to the very heart of the government's claims,'' 
Microsoft said in its motion. New York is the lead state among the 
19 states that remain involved with the suit. Marc Wurzel, a spokesman 
for New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco, called Condon's decision 
``a non-event.'' ``It will have no impact on the case,'' Wurzel said. 
``And in the context of multistate efforts like this, it's not at 
all unusual for states to come in and drop out as the matter proceeds.'' 
Wurzel noted that Texas, a leader of the multistate investigation 
of Microsoft early this year, dropped out just before the suit was 
filed. Separately Monday evening, the government made public the direct, 
written testimony of the next witness in the case: David Farber, a 
computer-science expert at the University of Pennsylvania who takes 
the stand on Tuesday. In his testimony, Farber disputes Microsoft's 
assertion that bundling Internet software with the Windows operating 
system improves the efficiency of both products. In its suit, the 
government accuses Microsoft of bundling the two products as a tool 
to put Netscape, its chief rival in the market for Web browsers, at 
a disadvantage. ``These same efficiencies can be achieved without 
bundling of the Web browser software with what Microsoft calls its 
Windows operating system,'' Farber testified. ``This is because there 
are no technical barriers that prevent Microsoft from developing and 
selling its Windows operating system as a stand-alone product separate 
from its browser software.'' He added: ``There are no technical efficiencies 
for users achieved by combining Microsoft's browser software with 
the remainder of the software sold as Windows 98 that could not be 
achieved by writing two programs in a manner that later could be loaded 
and `integrated''' by manufacturers or consumers later. Responding 
in a news release Monday evening, Microsoft said: ``Farber has provided 
nothing more than an opinion piece on how he thinks Microsoft could 
have or should have designed Windows. But in our market economy, government 
consultants don't get to redesign software products.''
