The chief ethnic Albanian negotiator on resolving violence in Serbia's 
Kosovo province has rejected the latest U.S. peace plan for the area. 
Fami Agani called the proposal by U.S. Kosovo envoy Christopher Hill 
too close to Serbian demands. He said the latest plan abandons earlier 
efforts to develop independent institutions for Kosovo and again closely 
ties it to Serbia.
