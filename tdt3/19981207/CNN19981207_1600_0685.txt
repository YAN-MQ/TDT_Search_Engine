President Franklin Roosevelt proclaimed December 7th, 1941, a day 
which would live in infamy. 57 years later, America is remembering 
the Japanese attack on pearl harbor. Ceremonies in Hawaii today have 
included speeches, a 21-gun salute, taps, and a flyover by Hawaii's 
air national guard. In the nation's capitol, a wreath will be placed 
at the foot of the lone sailor statue on the U.S. Navy memorial.
