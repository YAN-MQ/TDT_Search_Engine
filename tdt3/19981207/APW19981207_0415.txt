The National Party that until 1994 denied nonwhites the right to vote 
on Monday filed a court challenge against voters registration rules, 
saying they favor the ruling party. The party is asking the Cape High 
Court to declare unconstitutional a requirement that all voters must 
have a bar-coded identity document in order to register to vote in 
next year's elections. ``No law of Parliament can come along and prescribe 
an administrative procedure which has the effect of disenfranchising 
millions,'' said party leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk. ``This amounts 
to gerrymandering.'' Bar-coded identification books were first introduced 
in 1986. But only about 65 percent of whites, the bulwark support 
of opposition parties, have the proper documents, compared to 80 percent 
of blacks. Many blacks rushed to obtain the new papers to replace 
their apartheid-era documents after white rule started disintegrating 
in 1990. Many whites carry pre-1986 documents that have no expiration 
date. The court was expected to hear the case on Thursday, said Jan 
Bosman, spokesman for the National Party that governed during decades 
of white minority rule. Another opposition party, the tiny mostly 
white Democratic Party, also plans to challenge the process in court 
in Pretoria on Wednesday. In the country's first all-race elections 
in 1994, which marked the end of apartheid and swept the African National 
Congress to power, people simply had to show up at any polling station 
and produce any identity document. The creation of a national voters 
roll, which also requires voters to register at specific stations, 
is seen as a maturing of South Africa's fledgling democracy. But it 
got off to a shaky start over the past ten days. Initial plans to 
register 24.7 million voters over one three-day weekend at the end 
of November were changed in the face of administrative and funding 
problems. Extra civil servants and soldiers were drafted to help register 
voters, and registration in half of the country was delayed until 
this past weekend. The Independent Electoral Commission also plans 
to add more days to register in the New Year. By Monday morning, about 
6.3 million names were recorded in computerized voter rolls, with 
an additional three million registrations expected from outlying districts. 
No date has been set for the election, expected to be sometime after 
May 1.
