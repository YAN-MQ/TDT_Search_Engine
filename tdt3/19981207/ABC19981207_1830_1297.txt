So there is, it is clear, a whole new definition to the meaning of 
"old." Anyone who's 55 or even 60 knows it doesn't mean today what 
it meant to our parents' generation. And as ABC's Carole Simpson reports, 
the advertising community, for one, needs to get the message. If you 
were to look at TV commercials, you would think that everybody cidx6323 
over 45 must wear false teeth -- My dentures always feel fine. Have 
gas -- uh, oh. Irregularity -- Don't compromise on your laxative. 
Heart burn -- Controlling acid. And constant aches and pains. I think 
we're gonna see a move away from ads about things that are wrong with 
you and move towards ads at talk about ways in which you can be better, 
be more energetic, be more vigorous. And it's starting to happen. 
Refusing to give in to -- The 78-million-strong baby boomers are growing 
older. But because they are expected to still dominate the marketplace, 
advertisers are paying new and close attention to this aging population. 
They're saying there's money to be made there. Pat sloan, former editor 
of "advertising age," says we're beginning to see older people starring 
in ads selling just about everything. It shows that people are feeling 
more comfortable with who they are and how they look and how they 
feel about themselves. Companies realize they can't afford to offend 
aging consumers. Dangerous. This ad for special K backfired, especially 
with won over 40.aced it with a whole new campaign making fun of women's 
preoccupation with weight. I will not let my dress size -- -- Determine 
my self-worth. Do I look fat in this? Do I look fat? Good advertising 
should be based on understanding and listening to your consumers. 
And so because the baby boomers are the largest group of consumers 
today, we're really listening to them. And you will see a change in 
advertising. When baby boomers were asked at what age someone is considered 
old, the average age was 79. Marketing experts believe today's middle-agers 
will redefine not only what it means to be not only 40, but over 60. 
And if businesses want their dollars, they have no choice but to change 
the way they appeal to them. Carole Simpson, ABC News, Washington. 
One other note -- a study from Johns Hopkins University says the average 
age of Americans, now 76. Back in just a moment.
