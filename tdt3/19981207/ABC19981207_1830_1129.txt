We are going to take "A closer look" at getting older in America, 
this week, which will affect some of us sooner than others. As you 
will see, our understanding of the aging process is changing, with 
good reason. There are 64,000 people in the United States who are 
now 100 years old or older. 64,000. Certainly keeps willard Scott 
busy. That's almost double what it was ten years ago. And the number 
of centenarians is likely to more than triple in the next 20 years. 
We start this series with a report from ABC's Rebecca chase on the 
science slowing down the aging process. Elizabeth steinmann tries 
to start each day with exercise. It may not be the toughest workout, 
but she is 101 years old. I guess the good lord wants me to live. 
He's not calling me yet. a Harvard University study of centenarians 
has found that not only are people living longer, but that the "oldest 
of the old" enjoy better health than people in their 70s. Caroline 
maclean is 103 years old. Centenarians, as a group, either markedly 
delay or they escaped various diseases associated with aging. They 
have genes that have given them this incredible survival advantage. 
In his lab, Dr. perls is still trying to isolate those genes. But 
researchers at the University of Texas southwestern medical center 
at dallas believe they have already unlocked one of nature's basic 
secrets, how to stop a human cell from growing old and dying. What 
we've been able to do is to take a cell and reverse the aging process 
in cell culture. Every time a cell divides, the genetic material on 
the ends of chromosomes gets shorter. When that genetic material runs 
out, the cell stops dividing, and eventually dies. But scientists 
here have isolated an enzyme called telomerase, that causes the genetic 
material to grow back. Cells treated with telomerase continue to divide, 
living well past their normal life span. One way to think about telomerase 
is the Energizer bunny. It keeps itself going and going and going. 
The Texas scientists have already tripled the life span for human 
skin cells in the test tube. And they believe their discovery could 
lead to new remedies for many problems we now associate with aging. 
By manipulating the basic aging process, scientists think they have 
unlocked the real fountain of youth, allowing more of us to live to 
be 100 and enjoy it. Rebecca chase, ABC News, Atlanta.
