Russia is urging the United Nations Security Council to quickly review 
Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions. After meeting with visiting 
Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Moscow today, Russian Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said he believes Iraq has complied with 
UN resolutions and therefore sanctions should end. Despite his optimism, 
there are no indications the economic embargo will be lifted anytime 
soon.
