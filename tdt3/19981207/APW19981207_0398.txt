Clashes over the release of Palestinian prisoners spread throughout 
the West Bank Monday, and a prisoners' group said its hunger strike 
would continue until Israel releases all its Palestinian prisoners. 
The Palestinian Prisoners Association urged Palestinians to stage 
an ``intefadeh'' _ or uprising _ until all Palestinian prisoners are 
released, Palestinian legislator Fares Kadoura told protesters in 
the Palestinian-controlled town of Ramallah. ``The Palestinians in 
Israeli jails announce that our revolution has started,'' Kadoura 
said, reading from a statement. Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners 
last month out of 750 promised it the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords, 
signed in October. Palestinians are angry that most of those released 
were accused of common crimes and want Israel to release ``security 
prisoners'' _ those detained without trial under prevention of terror 
measures. Kadoura, who is a member of the team negotiating the prisoners 
release with Israel, said that a hunger strike begun last week by 
hundreds of prisoners had now spread to all four Israeli jails and 
among all 3,000 Palestinian prisoners. Prisons Authority spokeswoman 
Orit Messer-Harel said she knew of only 514 prisoners striking at 
two prisons since Friday. There had been no health problems so far, 
she said. Israel would not heed the protests, Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu said. ``They want to impose on Israel to release murderers,'' 
he said on a tour of an archaeological dig in Jerusalem's Old City. 
``I don't free murderers.'' He did not address demands for the release 
of others not accused of being involved in killings, including members 
of banned militant groups. In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians 
have accused one another of failing to live up to various provisions, 
and Israel has threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop 
pullback. That could poison next week's planned visit to the region. 
Clashes took place in at least five West Bank locations, including 
some controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Most injuries were minor. 
Stone-throwing protesters ambushed Israeli vehicles in Abu Dis, a 
village east of Jerusalem. One Israeli in a pick-up truck fired on 
the protesters, wounding one of them in the thigh. The driver of the 
pick-up truck said his passenger _ whom he would not identify _ opened 
fire because they felt their lives were in danger. ``Suddenly 100-200 
Arabs with big stones surrounded us around the car,'' the driver, 
who would only give his name as Michael, told Associated Press Television. 
``They want to kill us.'' The wounded Palestinian was later listed 
in moderate condition in hospital. In the city of Nablus in the northern 
West Bank, 200 Palestinian riot police clashed with about 3,000 protesters 
demanding that the Authority increase pressure on Israel to release 
the prisoners. One prisoner's mother, Jazer Hamami, accused the Palestinian 
police of being more brutal than the Israelis. ``When the Israeli 
soldiers were here, none of them beat women,'' she said.
