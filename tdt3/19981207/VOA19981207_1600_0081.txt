After two weeks of hospital treatment for pneumonia, Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin returned to the work in the Kremlin today and promptly 
dismissed his top administration aide. VOA's Gil Butler is in Moscow 
and has a report. After spending 15 days in Moscow's Central Clinical 
Hospital, Mr. Yeltsin returned to the Kremlin long enough to fire 
his chief of administration, Valentin Yumachov and three other top 
aides. He also took personal control over the justice ministry and 
the tax police. Then he went back to the hospital to continue treatment 
for pneumonia. Kremlin officials say the shakeup was done to strengthen 
presidential power and was prompted by fears the administration was 
showing a lack of zeal in fighting corruption and political extremism 
amid the ongoing economic crisis. One aide said the shakeup means 
Mr. Yeltsin has no intention of giving up power before a scheduled 
presidential election in the year 2000. During the president's hospitalization, 
day-to-day Russian government has been in the hands of Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov. Gil Butler, VOA News, Moscow.
