The state of South Carolina has withdrawn from that anti-monopoly 
lawsuit against the Microsoft computer software company. The suit, 
filed by the federal government and 20 states, claims Microsoft is 
attempting to drive the Netscape company out of the Internet browser 
market. However, South Carolina says it sees no evidence of that. 
Microsoft stocks soured to a record high on the news, and it was part 
of the reason that the Nasdaq was so strong today.
