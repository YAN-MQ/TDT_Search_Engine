Roll out your red carpets. Sounds of trumpets. Today's Geography Quiz 
takes us to a Bohemian city built for a king. Our mystery site is 
in a Czech republic, and it was once an exclusive spa for Europe's 
rich and famous. Now it's a popular rest stop on the route from Frankfurt 
to Prague. Legend has it that our city was founded by Czech King Carl 
IV. He was led to its hot springs by a deer fleeing his hunting dogs. 
Today, travelers come to the city to soak in thermal pools. Instead 
of immersing yourself in the water, you can always try drinking it, 
although we're told it's something of an acquired taste. Perhaps that's 
why visitors and locals alike prefer the traditional herbal liqueur, 
Dekarofka. Are you thirsty for the answer? Well, we'll spring it in 
just a few minutes.
