Here are the major options to shore up Social Security, with their 
pros and cons: INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS PROS: An opportunity 
for nearly all workers to build wealth by investing in stocks and 
bonds. Higher rates of return than from the current system. Still 
receive a guaranteed benefit payment but lower than under the current 
system. CONS: Individuals face the risks of financial markets. Unequal 
benefits depending on investing skill or luck. Costs of administering 
140 million accounts would be steep. Would require deep cuts in guaranteed 
benefits or large tax increases. GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT PROS: Much 
lower administrative costs than individual accounts. Market risks 
would be spread across income levels and generations. Returns could 
close a substantial portion of the financial gap facing the system. 
CONS: Makes government a major force in stock and bond markets, raising 
the possibility of Washington meddling in private enterprise. Investment 
decisions subject to politics. RAISING RETIREMENT AGE PROS: Would 
reflect increased life expectancies. Further increases would keep 
constant the portion of adult life spent in retirement. Could eliminate 
some long-term problems. CONS: Already scheduled to rise gradually 
over the next two decades to 67. People who do physical work cannot 
be expected to continue working longer than they do now. Raising the 
age would hurt older workers who lose their jobs. CAP ON TAXABLE EARNINGS 
PROS: Raising the amount of income taxed from the current limit of 
$68,400 puts much of the burden for fixing Social Security on those 
who can afford it most. Cap leaves a greater portion of total earnings 
untaxed than in the past. CONS: Amounts to a substantial tax increase. 
Social Security is already a relatively bad deal for upper income 
people, and raising the cap would make it worse. REDUCING COST OF 
LIVING ADJUSTMENTS PROS: Many economists think the consumer price 
index overstates inflation and gives Social Security recipients a 
bigger increase than is justified. CONS: Some economists think the 
consumer price index understates the cost of living for the elderly. 
REDUCING BENEFITS FOR THE WEALTHY PROS: Places the burden on those 
who can most afford it either through tax increases or benefit reductions. 
Cutting benefits by 30 percent for people with retirement income above 
$60,000 a year and by 85 percent for people with retirement income 
over $110,000 a year would eliminate three-quarters of the program's 
long-term problems. CONS: A big tax increase. Taxing benefits might 
unduly hurt people who get high levels of benefits but have little 
or no other income.
