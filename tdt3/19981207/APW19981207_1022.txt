President Boris Yeltsin roused himself from his sickbed for three 
hours Monday, fired several of his top aides and then returned to 
a Kremlin hospital where he is recuperating from pneumonia. It was 
a classic performance from the ailing president, who rarely seems 
so energized as when he is firing someone. The dismissed aides included 
officials who had commented recently on the president's poor health. 
``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin told his staff as he delivered 
the news, according to presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin. Among 
those fired was Presidential Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev, one 
of Yeltsin's closest and most loyal aides. A former journalist who 
was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev had served as 
chief of staff for nearly two years _ an eternity in Yeltsin's Kremlin. 
``The president has found a way to revitalize his staff _ by firing 
it,'' observed Alexander Shokhin, leader of the pro-government bloc 
in parliament and, until recently, a steady Yeltsin ally. Shown on 
television, Yeltsin appeared animated and robust as he scowled and 
delivered one of his patented tirades. ``Tough discipline, order and 
reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin said slowly and sternly as he glared 
at his staff from the head of a long table. Aides looked down and 
busied themselves scribbling notes. Besides firing Yumashev and three 
of his deputies, Yeltsin announced that he was personally taking charge 
of ``all power ministries ... including the Justice Ministry and the 
tax police.'' ``Power ministries'' are usually defined as those related 
to national defense and security. The Justice Ministry and tax police 
are at the forefront of the fight against crime and corruption, which 
has taken on new importance following the killing of a top liberal 
leader, Galina Starovoitova. Yeltsin's announcement was seen as mostly 
symbolic, however, since the president already wields authority over 
all the ministries included in his statement, and the ministers who 
head them were left in place. His remarks mostly suggested that Yeltsin 
is tired of being portrayed as a figurehead who has relinquished all 
power to his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov. Primakov, appointed 
in September, has been left to single-handedly tackle the economic 
crisis that has mired the country deeper in poverty. Yeltsin has said 
little and done less about the economy in the months since it went 
into a tailspin in August. There has been a rising chorus of calls 
for the president's resignation, based on his poor health, but Yeltsin 
has been defiant, insisting that he will fill out his term until it 
ends in 2000. Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia since Nov. 
22, and Yakushkin said he would remain in the hospital as long as 
necessary to recuperate. He refused to speculate about how long that 
would be. Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential 
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, and Vladimir 
Makarov, a former KGB officer, was named to one of the deputy posts. 
The others remained vacant. Bordyuzha, who will keep his security 
job, was formerly chief of the Border Guards. Yakushkin said Yeltsin 
had dismissed the aides because of their failure to stem crime or 
respond to several incidents of political extremism, including anti-Semitic 
remarks by a Communist parliament deputy. ``That undermines confidence 
in the president and in the government as a whole, and that is inadmissible 
in the current difficult economic situation,'' Yakushkin said. Yeltsin 
has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained dismissals. The latest 
round of ousters was also thought to reflect his unhappiness over 
aides' unusual candidness about his health in recent weeks. Yumashev 
and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too weak to handle 
day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and suggested he leave 
control of the economy and other current affairs to Primakov. ``The 
president wanted to show who is the boss,'' said Shokhin. ``He's like 
a lion who licked his wounds and now roared at those who thought he 
was already out of the game.''
