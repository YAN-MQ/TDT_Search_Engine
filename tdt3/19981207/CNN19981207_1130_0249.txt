The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case with potentially broad 
consequences for the field of product liability law. At issue is a 
judge's latitude in admitting testimony from an expert witness. The 
case grew out of a lawsuit over a fatal auto accident allegedly caused 
by a faulty tire. The judge in the case denied the plaintiffs' request 
to present testimony from a tire expert. Court watchers say they suspect 
the justices will continue to give judges room to decide.
