The White House is getting ready to host a closed-door conference 
on the future of social security, tomorrow and Wednesday. President 
Clinton and republican leaders haven't yet ruled out any options for 
fixing the system, but a hot debate over whether to privatize social 
security is expected. House speaker-designate Bob Livingston and Senate 
majority leader Trent lott are refusing to personally take part in 
the conference, but they're sending representatives.
