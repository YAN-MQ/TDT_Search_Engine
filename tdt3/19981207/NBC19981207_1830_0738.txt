In Moscow tonight, Boris Yeltsin left the hospital for the first time 
in two weeks, but only for three hours. It was just long enough to 
meet with his top aides and fire four of them, including his chief 
of staff. Yeltsin claimed they were not fighting crime or political 
extremism. Others say he was just angry because they publicly had 
questioned the state of his health. When it was all over, Yeltsin 
went back to the hospital.
