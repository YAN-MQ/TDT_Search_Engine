Transport Minister David Collenette of Canada and his Hungarian counterpart 
Kalman Katona inaugurated a new airport facility Monday, marking Canada's 
biggest investment in this former communist country. The prime contractor 
for building Ferihegy 2B was the Canadian Commercial Corporation, 
a government agency, and the work was executed by the Aiport Development 
Corp. of Toronto, best known for their work on Pearson International. 
The Royal Bank of Canada was the leading financial backer of the dlrs 
120 million (Canadian) project. The new airport, designed to handle 
up to five million passengers annually, will start operations Dec. 
12, taking over the function of the old airport which will be closed 
for a major facelift. ``This will be an excellent reflection of Hungary's 
modern, dynamic image,'' Collenette said. The two ministers signed 
a bilateral Air Transport Agreement, which will allow a direct air 
link between the two countries starting next spring.
