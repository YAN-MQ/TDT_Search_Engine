Legislators from NATO and Egypt opened a three-day meeting Monday 
aimed at promoting cooperation in issues including terrorism and the 
elimination of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. The seminar was 
the first by a special committee of the North Atlantic Assembly, the 
alliance's parliamentary arm, held outside its headquarters. The committee 
deals with Mediterranean non-NATO states. The legislators will discuss 
Egypt's concerns about terrorism, nuclear weapons, the Middle East 
peace process, the migration of labor and economic development. At 
the opening session, Egyptian Parliament Speaker Fathy Serour urged 
the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to increase 
cooperation in preventing terrorism and to stop offering political 
asylum to terrorists. Serour also complained about the West's passiveness 
toward Israel's possession of a nuclear arsenal, which he said threatened 
regional security. He called on NATO members to deal with ``the problem 
of mass destructive weapons with one scale'' _ a reference to the 
greater attention paid to Iraq's weaponry than to Israel's nuclear 
capabilites. Serour also urged the NATO countries to help push forward 
the Middle East peace process and to start an economic partnership 
that would bring more investment to Egypt. He also asked that the 
rights of laborers who migrated legally to NATO countries be protected. 
Legislators from other Mediterranean countries including Israel, Jordan 
and the Palestinians also attended the meeting. The seminar's conclusions 
will be issued Tuesday, though it formally closes Wednesday.
