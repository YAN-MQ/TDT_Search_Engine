A nuclear reactor that was restarted last week at the Yuzhnaya nuclear 
power plant after lengthy delays was automatically shut down Monday 
by its safety system, officials said. The shutdown was caused by an 
unexpected lack of electricity feeding the reactor's control and safety 
equipment, said a spokesman at the state Energoatom company, which 
runs Ukraine's nuclear power plants. Plant workers were studying the 
cause, which did not result in any radiation leaks, the spokesman 
said. Yuzhnaya's reactor No. 2 was shut down in June for routine repairs 
and upgrades, and was supposed to be restarted in early October. It 
returned to work in full only last Friday. Yuzhnaya, Ukraine's second-largest 
plant, is located in Yuzhnoukrainsk, 280 kilometers (170 miles) south 
of the capital Kiev. It has three VVER-1000 reactors, which are considered 
more reliable than Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors. Monday's shutdown 
was bad news for Ukraine's already overloaded and cash-strapped energy 
system, which is burdened by customer debts and increased demand for 
energy during the winter. Ukrainian energy plants are owed more than 
dlrs 1 billion by consumers and have been working below capacity since 
October. Energy Minister Oleksiy Sheberstov has warned that his ministry 
would be forced to cut off electricity to entire regions if even one 
nuclear reactor is stopped. The Cabinet has been working on a list 
of enterprises that would be deprived of electricity if demand becomes 
dangerously high. On Monday, President Leonid Kuchma lashed out at 
top government officials and Sheberstov's ministry for failing to 
improve the energy situation, urging them to more carefully monitor 
energy supplies. He also warned that he would hold energy sector leaders 
personally responsible for continued problems, Kuchma's press service 
said. Meanwhile, officials at two other nuclear power plants said 
they are planning to extend the repairs of two reactors until the 
end of December, the independent UNIAN news agency said. The two reactors 
were due to go on line Dec. 6 and Dec. 10, it said. Ukraine's five 
nuclear power plants provide for more than 40 percent of the former 
Soviet republic's energy needs. At least 5 of the 14 operational reactors 
are undergoing repairs.
