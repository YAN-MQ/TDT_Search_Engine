Hollywood is often called the land of make-believe, and not just because 
it's the town where movies are made. Gloria Hillard attended some 
events around Tinseltown recently -- events that could only happen 
in Hollywood. Though it looked like one of those premieres, on closer 
inspection, a concert. Turns out it was a store opening. Yes, the 
boys from motley crue have gone into the retail business. Attention 
Kmart shoppers. And just in time for Christmas, from motley crue fans 
to beyond pink fans, it appears Barbie, that mutlitalented gal, is 
promoting her new CD and video. Think they're so cool they make a 
lot of noise they sipped pink lemonade at this trendy sunset club 
and then learned a new dance that was a cross between an aerobic step 
class and the macarena. I know exactly how she feels. From Barbie, 
the original babe in pink, to another. No, not this babe. This one. 
Miss piggy has joined a number of other celebrities in launching her 
own perfume. At the end of the day, there's only Moi. Hey, I'm out 
of focus. The same week Stefanie powers launched her perfume, rare 
orchid. I wouldn't doubt it, you know. Miss piggy is up to all sorts 
of things, you know. She really wanted rare orchid, but it was like 
beating her off with a stick. You know, she's a very determined woman. 
Now, this was miss piggy's perfume party. While at Jack haley Jr.'s 
house, they held a birthday party for 1-year-old rhodesian ridgeback 
littermates. Wayne Newton has one, but he couldn't attend the party. 
So what Wayne did is he obliged us by sending a tape with tippy on 
stage in her performance so everyone can enjoy her presence. They 
had designer doggie bags on display. But the honored guests preferred 
these doggie bags. It was just another week in Hollywood. Happy birthday 
to you Gloria Hillard, "CNN Entertainment News," Los Angeles.
