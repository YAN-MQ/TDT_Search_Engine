Scientists who have been keeping a close eye on space recently put 
some of their orbital photos on display. In this edition of "tech 
trends," Don Knapp takes a closer look at the heavenly images. This 
huge crack on the surface of you're rope pa is evidence of water, 
scientists say, an ocean of water in outer space. We're thinking there 
might be a liquid ocean underneath its ice crust. We're hoping that 
will tell us something about what is underneath that fault, what sorts 
of forces are causing the fault to slip. The new image from the galileo 
space probe shows scientists the surface appears to have broken and 
melted, perhaps the results of a Tidal action. Galileo's measurements 
of europa's magnetic field is another clue suggesting a layer of seawater 
on the distant Moon. What you can see is that the satellites in their 
orbit are moving into and out of this region. Meanwhile, another group 
of scientists have been studying earth's magnetic field, the Van Allen 
radiation belt in the earth's, "Magnetosphere." The magnetic field 
captures the solar wind electrons from the sun and moves them around 
the earth. Now, new findings suggest there may be times the particles 
are getting a Huge boost from the magnetosphere. What we're seeing 
is that the earth is a very efficient effective cosmic particle accelerator, 
here, we have one of a very giant scale operating in space. That could 
pose problems for astronauts, space ships and electronic satellites. 
The energy can go from something that can barely penetrate a piece 
of paper to energies that can pass through half an inch of aluminum 
or more and can pass through the skin of a spacecraft very easily. 
The failure of the paging satellite, galaxy four, last may was a Tipoff 
for scientists. They now believe particles accelerated by the magnetosphere 
bombarded the galaxy four's electronics and shut them down. The researchers 
say future space ventures now have another hazard to contend with 
-- space weather. And they suggest putting up more satellites to keep 
track of it. Don Knapp, CNN, San Francisco.
