When Peter Bevis first laid eyes on her, she was in sorry shape. Once 
the sleek, silvery queen of Puget Sound, she was washed up, literally. 
Beached in a muddy Alaskan cove, she had suffered the ignominy of 
becoming a shrimp-processing plant, and now the rusty, rotting vessel 
wasn't even good enough for that. ``But the minute I walked inside, 
I just found myself grinning from ear to ear,'' Bevis recalled. ``I 
said to myself, this thing is just too cool to be cut up for scrap. 
She's coming back to Seattle. She has to come back.'' So began the 
return odyssey of the ferryboat Kalakala, which was launched to great 
fanfare here in 1935 and served for 32 years thereafter, plying the 
waters of the sound with distinctive touches that included a futuristic 
design out of Buck Rogers, a double-horseshoe lunch counter and a 
ballroom with chandeliers and orchestra pit. The Art Deco-style Kalakala 
was saved by the obsessive decadelong quest of Bevis, a sculptor who 
was working as a commercial fisherman when he encountered the ferry. 
Bevis was supported by preservation societies around the world, including 
the Art Deco Society in New York, which called the vessel ``a unique 
Depression-era work of art'' in a letter imploring the fishing town 
of Kodiak to spare it from a salvager's torch. By the time the Kalakala 
finally did come back home to Seattle last month after a 16-day journey 
from Alaska, escorted by three tugboats and ringed by the sprays from 
fireboats, it was clear that this battered old hulk had touched a 
powerful nostalgic nerve in this city that so often seems to be rushing 
headlong toward a hyperwired future. Water is everywhere around Seattle 
and, long before there was Microsoft and a Starbucks on every other 
corner, there was a strong maritime tradition. A state ferry system 
still knits together dozens of communities, and thousands of people 
in the Puget Sound region commute to work every day via ferry. For 
years, the Kalakala was a symbol of Seattle, and as crowds of people 
have turned out to take a look at the ferry, now tied up at Pier 66 
downtown, the memories are flooding back. ``My late parents danced 
aboard the Kalakala in the '30s,'' wrote Marilyn Harnish in the visitors' 
logbook. ``I was delighted to walk where my parents walked and danced 
so many, many years ago. What fun they had!'' (While the ferry was 
primarily used for commuters on the 45-minute trip between Seattle 
and Bremerton, it also did moonlight cruises.) Another visitor, Brock 
Robison, recalled: ``Winter of 1950, foggy early morning, was in front 
of my beach house as fog lifted. ``There was the silver bird Kalakala'' 
looming before him, he wrote. ``Incredible!'' Corinne Welfelt had 
a very special attachment to the Kalakala _ she was born aboard it, 
on June 11, 1942. The vibrations aboard the boat, she explained, apparently 
sent her mother into a slightly early labor. The future of the 276-foot-long 
Kalakala, which is pronounced kah-LOCK-ah-lah and means ``flying bird'' 
in the language of the Chinook Indians, is still uncertain. Although 
visitors have thronged to it and Mayor Paul Schell has spoken enthusiastically 
of proposals to tie the boat up permanently as a floating monument 
near historic Pioneer Square, there is the matter of money. Much of 
the more than $1 million spent on the effort to return the Kalakala 
has come from Bevis, 45, who has lavished his life savings and a small 
inheritance from his uncle on the preservation effort. He is so attached 
to the boat that he is now living aboard it with his springer spaniel, 
Lucy. But estimates for refurbishing the ferry and turning it into 
an attraction with restaurants, stores and a historical display range 
from $5 million to $20 million or more. Furthermore, Bevis and the 
board of the nonprofit Kalakala Foundation are decidedly lukewarm 
to the idea of selling the boat to a commercial investor. ``This is 
not for any one person to own,'' said Bevis, a bearded bear of a man, 
as he offered a tour of a vessel that is so rusty in places, it almost 
seems to have been dragged up from the ocean depths. ``It's a piece 
of the city's history.'' The foundation has been getting donations, 
including a recent gift of $100,000, and Bevis seems possessed with 
an almost mystical belief that the Kalakala will become so beloved 
that it will actually generate revenue some day, which he hopes the 
foundation will be able to lavish on artistic and cultural projects 
elsewhere in the city. As he conducted the tour, Bevis sorrowfully 
described the changes forced upon the vessel during its shrimp-processing 
days. ``Both sides of the car deck were over here, but they were changed 
to walk-in freezers,'' he said. But even in its damaged state, the 
streamlined Kalakala is clearly a remarkable craft. ``It is a beautiful 
ship, inside and out,'' Bevis said. Pointing to a circular staircase, 
he said: ``Now you can see where Boeing engineers got their idea for 
the upper deck of the 747.'' Shortly after Bevis returned from an 
ocean fishing trip and first set foot in the craft, in 1988, he rushed 
over to the Kodiak town hall, trying to find out if he could claim 
the boat. ``I still had halibut guts in my beard,'' he recalled. He 
finally persuaded Kodiak officials, who were seeking bids to get rid 
of the ferry anyway, to sell it to him for a dollar. When he showed 
up this summer and took the dollar out of his wallet, the Kodiak city 
manager told him: ``Keep the money. You're going to need it.'' Bevis 
and friends and volunteers chipped and blasted 350 tons of concrete 
out of the ferry from its shrimp-plant days, took other steps to make 
it seaworthy and eventually were on their way to Seattle. And Bevis 
said he was optimistic about the ferry's future, as well as his own. 
``I just have this attitude about the whole thing,'' he said. ``If 
you're good to the Kalakala, she'll be good to you.''
