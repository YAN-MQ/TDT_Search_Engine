Dancesport, known socially as ballroom dancing, rocked the house Monday 
as it made its debut at a major international multi-sport event. It 
is only a demonstration event in the Asian Games, not counted in the 
medal standings, but a mostly young local crowd packed the 1,300-seat 
Bangkok Metropolitan Youth Center gymnasium to watch couples from 
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, 
Taiwan and Thailand rumba, waltz and cha-cha-cha their hearts out. 
Top honors in the standard dance _ waltz, tango, Viennese waltz, slow 
foxtrot and quickstep _ went to Li Chu-chung and Chang Ko-ping of 
Taiwan. China's Shen Yi and Huang Wenjuan carried off the silver, 
and the bronze went to their compatriots, Duan Baohua and Wang Yi. 
To deafening cheers, Thai dancers Surachai Sriprapat and Weerawan 
Sriprapat captured the gold in the faster and more risque Latin American 
category, which put contestants through their paces doing the samba, 
cha-cha-cha, rumba, paso doble and jive. Taiwan's Tsai Jui-feng and 
Chiu Shu-chen took the silver, and the bronze went to Ma Jun and Huang 
Rui of China. In September 1997, the International Olympic Committee 
granted dancesport official recognition as a sport, occasioning snorts 
of derision from lovers of more traditional athletic endeavors. Recognition 
does not automatically qualify a sport for IOC competitions. But the 
German-based International Dancesport Federation hopes to get the 
event into the 2008 Olympics, if not the 2004 games in Athens. No 
one watching Monday's show could deny that it was a spectacle, but 
is it sport? ``If (IOC president Juan Antonio) Samaranch says it's 
a sports, it's a sport,'' joked International Dancesport Federation 
president Rudolf Baumann, who flew to Bangkok for Monday's event. 
Like other supporters of the event, he contended that dancesport requires 
as much strength, training and endurance as many other established 
sports. Sport or not, the crowd loved the show. Take every Hollywood 
dance movie from the past 60 years, drop the plot line, tack together 
a highlights tape, and you've got the idea. ``Standard'' is for the 
older more up-market crowd. The men dance in white tie and tails, 
and their partners in flamboyantly colored ball gowns. ``Latin'' is 
where the younger crowd lets rip. The men wear what could best be 
described as black matador gear, and the women _ very little. Sequins 
figure prominently, however. ``It's terrific, it's fantastic, it combines 
art and sport, the physical and technique,'' said dermatologist Wibool 
Sareevutr, 31, a spectator. One of the Singaporean competitors, Wee 
Giam Goh, said he practices almost every day for 3-4 hours. ``It's 
graceful, exciting, good sport,'' said Goh, 45. ``If taken as a sport 
it lasts through old age, helping to keep good posture and flexibility.'' 
His dancing shoes, he said, cost 130 Singapore dollars (US dlrs 80) 
a pair, and each pair lasts only a few months. That's nothing compared 
to the gowns his wife must wear for the standard competitions. The 
prices range from 4,000-6,000 Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs 2,450-3,680) 
said Siew Bee Tan. They come from Italy and Britain. ``This is my 
third gown,'' she said. ``After a few dances you have to change it.'' 
The couple doesn't dance full-time. He's in business, she works in 
a bank. ``We save to dance,'' said Goh.
