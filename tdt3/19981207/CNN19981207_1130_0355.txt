After just three hours at the Kremlin today, Russian President Boris 
yeltsin is back in the hospital. He was originally hospitalized two 
weeks ago with pneumonia, the latest in a string of illnesses Yeltsin 
has had in the last several months. Though he only spent a few hours 
at the Kremlin today, Yeltsin didn't waste any time. He fired several 
top aides and took control of the justice ministry and the tax police. 
A spokesman says Yeltsin won't be going back to the Kremlin again 
until he finishes treatment.
