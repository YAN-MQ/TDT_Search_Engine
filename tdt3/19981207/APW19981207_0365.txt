Japanese swimmer Yasuko Tajima trounced China's world record holders 
Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan to claim the women's 400-meter medley gold 
medal at the Asian Games Monday. China won the opening two swim golds 
and was expected to take the third with event record holder Chen and 
200-meter medley record holder Wu in the field. But Tajima, third 
behind Chen in the event at this year's world championships, finished 
in 4 minutes, 39.92 seconds, well ahead of Wu (4:46.74) and Chen (4:47.34). 
Chen set the world record at 4:34.79 last year and backed it up by 
winning the world title in Perth in January. She got a poor start 
in the butterfly Monday and was fourth after 100 meters but headed 
into the final 100 meters of freestyle in second. But Tajima, 17, 
increased her margin from four seconds as Chen struggled down the 
stretch, unable to stop Wu from taking silver. Dual world championship 
medalist Shan Ying gave China a good start to the battle for 32 golds 
when she powered to victory in the 100-meter freestyle in an outside 
lane. Shan, who claimed bronze medals in the 50- and 100-meter double 
at the Perth world meet earlier this year, was second-slowest qualifier 
for the final and had to win from Lane 1. She turned in front at 50 
meters and finished in 56.20 seconds. China's Chao Na and Japan's 
Sumika Minamoto, the fastest qualifier, had a dead heat for silver 
in 56.39 seconds. China is returning to the Asian Games four years 
after a drugs scandal in Hiroshima, Japan. China won a remarkable 
25 of 32 golds in 1994 but seven of its swim team and 11 athletes 
overall were found later to have used steroids. China also dominated 
its home games in Beijing in 1990 with 20 golds. After six team members 
were sent home in disgrace from the Perth meet, China has claimed 
its team is free of drugs for this event. All swimmers were tested 
before leaving for Bangkok, according to Chinese press reports. Medley 
swimmer Xiong Guoming is back after he was one of the seven who returned 
a positive test in Hiroshima. China was on an early path to another 
Asian Games triumph as Zeng Qiliang followed Shan's win with victory 
in the men's 100-meter breaststroke. Zeng, who won the silver medal 
at the Perth world championships behind Olympic champion Frederick 
Deburghgraeve of Belgium, outclassed his rivals Monday. He finished 
in 1 minute, 2.32 seconds for a comfortable win over Japan's Akira 
Hayashi (1:02.55) and Malaysia's Elvin Chia (1:03.09).
