Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler says U.N. monitors will 
begin a Series of surprise inspections in Iraq any time now. He wants 
to determine whether Baghdad is cooperating fully in the search for 
banned weapons of mass destruction. After the inspections are finished, 
Butler says he will prepare a report to u.N. secretary-general Kofi 
Annan. I want to emphasize it will be a series of visits. It will 
begin at the beginning and end at its end. And when that ends at the 
end of this week or early next, I hope to be in a Position to formulate 
the report that was called for by the security council on the 15th 
of November, namely, a report by me to the secretary-general on whether 
or not Iraq has kept its promise of full cooperation. The weapons 
inspectors returned to Baghdad last month following a two-week standoff. 
They have been testing Iraq's promise by seeking access to documents 
and monitoring previously inspected sites.
