There was some good news for the White House attorneys that came late 
today in the form of an announcement from the justice department, 
that in at least one pending case there will not be yet another independent 
counsel. Janet Reno today made it clear there are "no reasonable grounds" 
to investigate alleged campaign finances violations.
