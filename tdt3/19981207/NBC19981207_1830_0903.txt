NBC news "in depth" -- tonight, a life for a life. Should a parent 
be allowed to put his own life on the line to save his child's? That's 
just one of several issues in the case of a teenage girl who desperately 
needs a new kidney. Right now, more than 40,000 people are on the 
waiting list for a donated kidney. Each day, 11 Americans die while 
waiting for an organ transplant. But now, that teenage girl has a 
chance at life, offered willingly by her own father. So who is standing 
in the way? NBC's Mike Boettcher tonight, "in depth." 16-year-old 
Renada Patterson needs help in a hurry. Her transplanted kidney, donated 
three years ago by her father, is failing, and she needs another quickly. 
There is a willing donor. Once again, it's her father, a California 
prison inmate. He abandoned her. And now he's willing to risk his 
own life to save Renada. It's got to be done. She needs it. I'm willing 
to do it. She's my daughter and I love her. But it's not that easy. 
Renada's doctor refuses to perform the transplant. Doctors will meet 
Thursday to decide whether to allow the transplant. The situation 
presents them a vexing set of questions. Does a father have the right 
to risk his own life to save his daughters, or is it wrong to allow 
a transplant if it threatens the donors life, family or not? Dr. Wade 
Smith is chairman of the hospitals medical committee, which will consider 
the fathers request. We really have to answer the question of if there's 
any part of this that we feel is unethical and would violate the ethics 
of the physician side then it would be ill advised to go forward with 
it. But to Vicki Daniel, Renada's mother, doctors' ethics is not the 
issue. This is a family issue. This has nothing to do with ethics. 
But it never would have happened if Renada would have taken the drugs. 
She didn't like the side effects. But her mother didn't know. She 
says there's nothing that's going to stop her now. So now, taxpayers 
could get the Bill. And her father could survive by undergoing dialysis 
at his prison, at a Cost of $40,000 a year, all billed to taxpayers. 
Should the public pay for a child's negligence and fathers demonstration 
of love? Renada's family can't help but think of the scene three years 
ago, after the first transplant, when Renada first met her father. 
Thank you very much for giving me a chance. I love you. This time, 
love may not be enough to make this second father/daughter transplant 
happen. A physician's first rule is to do no harm. A daughter in desperate 
need of a kidney or a father who would die if he gives it. Mike Boettcher, 
NBC news, Oakland.
