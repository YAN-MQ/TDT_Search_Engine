A lot of the talk surrounding this latest push for impeachment centers 
around the number three man in the house, whip Tom delay. This story 
will appear in tomorrow's "New York Times" under the byline of eric 
schmitt. What if delay fails? If he fails there will be no impeachment. 
There are a group of moderate republicans who are trying to get a 
censure resolution to the house floor. What Mr. delay has done, quite 
effectively so far, is to block that and make it known he opposes 
censure. The guessing is you've got an incoming speaker Bob Livingston 
who would rather be known for a few other things be sides scandal. 
Delay takes the Mantle of this and carries it for a while. That's 
right. Tom delay fills the need of the new speaker Bob Livingston 
who neither wants to be remembered as the man who got Bill Clinton 
off, nor does he want to be seen as a fanatic on impeachment. Tom 
delay who has been very outspoken -- Livingston has been silent on 
this Delay does not mind being seen as a fanatic on this subject. 
He is a trench warfare warrior. He is a plaque politician. Respected 
and feared by both republicans and democrats for his ability to count 
votes and pursuade members to come around to the views he has. He 
has been very out there on his views about raising money, boldly. 
About using the political clout, going back to the 104th that the 
G.O.P. had. To the point of being almost indelicate. He's a Blunt-spoken 
man, nicknamed the hammer for good reason. He is somebody who is valued 
-- his consistency is valued. People know where they stand with Tom 
delay. The down side, should he fail, he still will retain the leadership 
job, those have been chosen for the 106th. He is poised to remain 
number three, correct? His power actually grew in the last leadership 
elections, unlike Mr. gingrich. Tom delay grew in power. No one challenged 
him. He wronged some concessions from Mr. Livingston to increase power 
as the whip. Eric, thank you very much for coming on after filing 
your story "today show." It appears tomorrow.
