Shuttle astronauts Jim Newman and Jerry Ross are at work outside the 
future international space station. They're on a six-hour spacewalk 
to hook up 40 electrical connections between the first two components 
of the space station. Those two pieces were put together yesterday. 
Two more space walks are planned for this shuttle "endeavour" mission.
