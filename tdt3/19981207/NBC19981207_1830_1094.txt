aren't always up to the challenge of itchy, dry skin? That's why there's 
new cortizone 10 plus. Among these, only cortizone 10 plus has 10 
moisturizers, like aloe and vitamins, plus the power of cortizone 
10 to stop itch and help heal. So for itchy patches of dry skin, even 
eczema or psoriasis, try new cortizone 10 plus.
