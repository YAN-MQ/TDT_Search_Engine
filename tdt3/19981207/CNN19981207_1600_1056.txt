Back in this country, gas prices continue to fall. According to the 
biweekly lundberg survey, we've now seen an average 18 cent per gallon 
decline in the past year. In just the last two weeks, the average 
price of all grades of gasoline dipped by more than 2 1/2 cents a 
gallon to about $1.04 a gallon. Lundberg attributes the fall to the 
Asian economic crisis and an oversupply of crude oil.
