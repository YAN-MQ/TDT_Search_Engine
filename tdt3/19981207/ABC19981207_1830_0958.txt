One note overseas, in the Middle East, at least 70 people were hurt 
in clashes across the West Bank today. Less than a week before President 
Clinton's visit. In separate incidents, Palestinian and Israeli police 
fired on demonstrators who had been stoning Israelis in one case. 
They're all demanding the Palestinians are, the release of Palestinian 
prisoners from Israeli prisons.
