Israel has refused to extradite to Poland a Jewish man accused of 
atrocities against German prisoners after World War II, the Justice 
Ministry said Monday. Solomon Morel, who commanded a camp for German 
prisoners in southern Poland, allegedly tortured inmates and was considered 
responsible for at least 1,538 deaths, according to the Justice Ministry. 
Poland requested Morel's extradition in April on charges of beating 
and torturing prisoners and creating inhuman conditions at the Swietochlowice 
camp, which he commanded from February to November 1945. Israel sent 
a letter last month that said it refused to extradite Morel to Poland 
to face the charges. Orit Shemesh, a spokeswoman for the Israeli Justice 
Ministry, said the statue of limitations had run out on the case. 
A spokeswoman for the Polish Justice Ministry, Barbara Makosa-Stepkowska, 
said the charges against Morel failed to meet the definition of genocide 
under Israeli law. She said Israel's decision ends the case in Poland, 
which lacks the power to appeal. Morel could only be arrested if he 
left Israel, Makosa-Stepkowska said. The investigation was the only 
one in Poland against a Jew accused of retaliating against the Germans 
after their defeat. Polish investigators opened the case in 1992. 
In seeking Morel's extradition, they said the ``extremely bad conditions'' 
at the camp included hunger, overcrowding and epidemic diseases that 
led to an unspecified number of deaths. Morel, who lost his parents 
and two brothers during the war, moved to Israel in 1994.
