This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Tuesday morning. And you can see rainfall is expected 
in the east along a cold front as it continues its easterly movement. 
And imbedded within this, we may find a few thunderstorms. Meanwhile, 
in the northwest, another storm moves inland with snowfall particularly 
so at the higher elevations. As the storm in the northwest continues 
to move eastward, it'll spread some of the snow through the northern 
Rockies. In the east, rainfall will spread to the east coast. Only 
northern New England would see snowfall associated with this system. 
For it remains still rather warm particularly so in the southeast, 
although the cold air does continue its easterly movement as we go 
through the day. We extend on to our forecast for Wednesday. And you 
can see a rain/snow mix expected in parts of the Rockies with the 
cold air in place. As we head on into Thursday, you can see rain and 
thunderstorms possible along the gulf coast back through Texas. And 
by week's end, we're seeing rain showers scattered about in the southern 
plains states. Snow flurries are possible in the Great Lakes area.
