BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) - The U.S. envoy for Bosnia on 
Monday denounced the new Bosnian Serb president, saying he has been 
working against the 1995 Dayton accords that ended the Bosnian war. 
The statement by Robert Gelbard indicates Washington's displeasure 
with the extreme-nationalist President Nikola Poplasen and raised 
the possibility he might be replaced by the international officials 
who effectively rule Bosnia under the Dayton agreement. ``We are deeply 
concerned about what we have seen so far from President Poplasen and 
his short few weeks in office,'' Gelbard said in Banja Luka after 
he met Poplasen and acting pro-Western Bosnian Serb Premier Milorad 
Dodik. Poplasen's ``actions and his words have shown us that he is 
against the Dayton agreement,'' Gelbard told reporters. ``He appears 
to be using democratic mechanism for antidemocratic purposes.'' Poplasen, 
of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, won presidential elections 
in the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia last September over a moderate 
who was supported by Western peace officials. Poplasen's victory dealt 
a blow to international efforts to cement peace, restart ethnic tolerance 
and impose democracy in Bosnia after the 1995 agreement ended the 
3-1/2 year war. Polpasen's defiant anti-Western statements have prompted 
speculations that he might be sacked by Bosnia's international care-takers, 
as stipulated by the Dayton agreement which calls for the removal 
of all those Bosnian officials who jeopardize the U.S.-sponsored peace 
deal. Gelbard said he hoped that Dodik's reformist government -- which 
Poplasen is trying to remove by proposing a new premier close to Bosnian 
Serb war-crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic -- ``will continue in office 
because it has proved to be productive and positive one.'' Gelbard 
denounced Poplasen for his effort to push the Serb-controlled half 
of Bosnia closer to Serbia -- instead of working toward a joint Bosnian 
state together with rival Muslims and Croats -- by saying: ``Serbia 
has collapsed and communist-type economy. Bosnian Serbs are making 
progress in the opposite direction, trying to join the rest of the 
world.''
