Rwanda will maintain troops in neighboring Congo in the absence of 
adequate security guarantees along its border, Vice President Paul 
Kagame said. Kagame, who is also minister of defense, said on Sunday 
Rwanda would support any U.N.-brokered peace agreement which addresses 
both the concerns of Congolese rebels fighting to overthrow President 
Laurent Kabila and his country's own security concerns. ``If we were 
given cast-iron guarantees by the international community that our 
security concerns would be addressed, and Kabila demonstrated a genuine 
commitment to address our security concerns, then we would have no 
further need to keep our troops in Congo,'' Kagame told the British 
Broadcasting Corp. Rwandan Hutu rebels use bases in eastern Congo 
to launch cross-border attacks aimed at destabilizing the Rwandan 
government. So far, peace initiatives to end Congo's four-month war 
have failed over Kabila's refusal to negotiate directly with the Congolese 
rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and 
opposition politicians. He instead has demanded that Rwanda and Uganda, 
who are openly supporting the Congolese rebels, withdraw their backing. 
The conflict, which began Aug. 2, has drawn in Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia 
and Chad fighting in support of Kabila. In a summit in Paris last 
month, Rwanda agreed with Uganda, Zimbabwe and Congo to sign a cease-fire 
in Lusaka, Zambia on Dec. 14-15, but later added that any agreement 
will have to include the rebels. Kagame said his troops had intervened 
in Congo because Kabila had recruited thousands of former Hutu soldiers 
and militiamen who had fled Rwanda in fear of reprisals for a 1994 
genocide in Rwanda. ``The international community must understand 
that this is an issue that affects our very exsistance as a nation 
and as a people,'' he said. More than 500,000 minority Tutsis and 
politically moderate Hutus were slaughtered in the Hutu government-sponsored 
genocide before Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994, sending the 
defeated Hutu soldiers into what was then Zaire. Many of them regrouped 
in bases in eastern Congo. In 1996, Rwanda supported Kabila's rebels 
who ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko but failed to rid the 
common border from Hutu fighters. ``Kabila and his allies will never 
be able to overrun eastern Congo, that is impossible,'' Kagame said. 
``They also cannot wish away the problems they have created. They 
need to sit down and talk to those fighting them.''
