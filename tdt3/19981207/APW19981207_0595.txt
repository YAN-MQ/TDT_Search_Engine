When a young Romanian man was jilted days before his wedding, his 
parents came up with a solution: They rented a bride. Determined to 
save their 22-year-old son Lucian's honor and not lose money spent 
on nuptials, the family also rented parents for the bride, the Evenimentul 
Zilei newspaper reported. For days, the ``bride,'' a childhood friend 
named Mariana, rehearsed lines and practiced the ceremony with the 
groom. Lucian's family agreed that in exchange for her trouble, Mariana 
would receive $100. In Romania, wedding guests give money to help 
defray costs. If the wedding had been canceled, the family would have 
lost the hundreds of dollars it had spent. But only two-thirds of 
the guests came, and some, surprised by the new bride, weren't as 
generous as expected. As a result, Mariana received only $3 instead 
of the $100 she was promised. And that isn't her only headache: Apparently, 
Lucian has fallen for her and wants the marriage to last.
