The judge who sentenced Mike Tyson to prison for rape has three options 
regarding the former heavyweight champion's probation _ and one of 
them is returning him to jail. Tyson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor 
assault charges in Maryland last week, and that could be used as evidence 
by Judge Patricia Gifford of a possible parole violation. ``There 
are three things that could occur when the report is received,'' Gifford 
said Monday. ``A warrant for Mr. Tyson's arrest could be issued, a 
hearing on the report could be scheduled, or there could be no action 
toward a possible revocation of probation ... taken until sentencing 
in Maryland. ``Until I've reviewed the report and made a decision, 
it would be inappropriate to comment on possible action,'' the judge 
said. Sentencing is Maryland is expected early next year. The Montgomery 
County (Maryland) District Court said no exact sentencing date has 
been set. Probation officer George Walker said Thursday it appeared 
Tyson violated terms of his probation as a result of his no-contest 
plea. Tyson was released from prison in 1995. Gifford added four years 
of probation, however, meaning Tyson could be sent back to jail for 
any further violation. His probation is scheduled to expire in March. 
Tyson's no-contest plea stemmed from a minor traffic accident in August 
in which two motorists claimed the boxer kicked and punched them. 
Indiana authorities also reviewed the probation _ but took no action 
_ after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a title bout in 
June 1997. The Nevada Athletic Commission stripped Tyson of his boxing 
license but reinstated him in October. Tyson plans to fight Francois 
Botha on Jan. 16 in Las Vegas. A news conference is scheduled Tuesday 
in Los Angeles to announce the bout. The no-contest plea was not an 
admission of guilt. However, Tyson could face up to 20 years in prison 
_ 10 years on each count _ and be fined up to dlrs 5,000. The two 
men he scuffled with already have agreed to a settlement to avoid 
a civil suit. Tyson is training in the Phoenix area and intends to 
live there. He already has registered as a sex offender in Arizona 
as part of his planned move. His Arizona neighbors will not be notified 
when he chooses a permanent home. The community notification law did 
not take effect until after his conviction. To clear the way for his 
move, Tyson is selling his 62-acre estate in Ohio along with homes 
in Las Vegas and Connecticut, The Plain Dealer of Cleveland reports. 
The total asking price is dlrs 21 million.
