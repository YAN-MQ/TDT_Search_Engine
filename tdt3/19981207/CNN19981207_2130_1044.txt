If you're traveling out of the country and plan to drive during your 
trip, there are some important things you should know about rental 
car insurance. Lori Waffenschmidt has details in this edition of "working 
ahead." When you rent a car in another country, you have to make sure 
you know how the vehicle operates, which side of the highway to drive 
on, and other traffic rules. But before you get behind the wheel, 
make sure you have insurance. In the U.S., you may be covered by your 
personal car policies. And many charge cards offer supplemental insurance, 
if you use the card when renting. But the rules change when you leave 
the country. Many car rental companies overseas require that you purchase 
their own insurance. This, in turn, impacts your charge-card coverage. 
Some countries, for example, New Zealand and Australia, mandate that 
the insurance is actually covered in the cost of the car rental. So, 
they do not allow companies, credit card companies, to provide car 
rental insurance. If you plan to rent in one country and drive to 
another, keep in mind the laws vary. You'll need to understand the 
rental car rules in each nation you visit. It's also a good idea to 
rent from a major company headquartered in the United States, with 
a staff that speaks English -- Okay, thank you, bye. -- and offers 
24-hour roadside assistance. Most importantly, do your homework before 
you leave, and don't take chances. If you can't decide whether or 
not you need the insurance, it's probably best to go ahead and buy 
it. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN.
