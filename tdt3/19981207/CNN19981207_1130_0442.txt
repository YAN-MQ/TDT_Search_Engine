per 100,000. Following Baltimore is Washington D.C., St. Louis, Rochester, 
New York and atlanta. When it comes to syphilis, Baltimore also leads 
the nation with 99 cases reported for every 100,000 people. Memphis 
and Nashville, Tennessee, follow, with Atlanta and New Orleans tied 
for fourth. CDC figures show gonorrhea and syphilis cases have reached 
all time lows in most of the country, with syphilis nearly eradicated.
