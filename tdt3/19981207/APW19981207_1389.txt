In the latest crackdown on mobsters, a court here convicted 47 defendants 
of crimes ranging from murder to extortion to money laundering. Five 
defendants were acquitted. Italy's stiffest penalty, life imprisonment, 
was handed down to five mobsters for various homicides. Two turncoats, 
a man and his nephew, were given lesser sentences, 20 and 16 years 
respectively, for a pair of murders and for extortion because they 
had joined the growing army of mobsters who have collaborated with 
the state. During the trial, some Catania business owners who earlier 
had told investigators that they were victims of extortion took back 
the accusations when asked to confirm their testimony in front of 
the defendants. Prosecutors described the defendants as members of 
Mafia crime clans from the Catania area.
