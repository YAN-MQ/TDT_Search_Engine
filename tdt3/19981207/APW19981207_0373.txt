Iraq's Tariq Aziz and Russia's foreign minister said Monday that the 
Arab nation was again cooperating with U.N weapons inspectors and 
that sanctions relief should be granted soon. Aziz, Iraq's deputy 
prime minister, maintains regular ties with Russia, which is sympathetic 
to Baghdad and supports the early lifting of the comprehensive U.N. 
sanctions. ``We believe that soon the sanctions will be lifted,'' 
Russia's Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov told a news conference after 
meeting Aziz. ``We are approaching the end of a long process.'' Despite 
Ivanov's optimism, there are no signs that the United States and Britain, 
the leading proponents of sanctions, are prepared to ease their stance 
following repeated showdowns with Iraq. Iraq agreed to resume cooperation 
with U.N. weapons inspectors last month after a confrontation that 
nearly led to military strikes by the United States. Aziz said he 
hoped that ``lawful and objective inspections'' could take place next 
month. And he again criticized the U.N. Security Council for failing 
to end the embargo that was placed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait. ``For more than seven years Iraq has been following through 
on its obligations, but the Security Council hasn't been meeting its 
obligations,'' Aziz said. ``This is unacceptable.'' While offering 
Iraq moral support, Russia has insisted that Baghdad comply with U.N. 
Security Council Resolution 687, which calls for the dismantling of 
all weapons of mass destruction, the main condition for ending the 
sanctions. ``We are calling for the full implementation ... which 
should lead to the lifting of the oil embargo,'' Ivanov said. Aziz 
was to meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov later on Monday. 
Primakov, a fluent Arabic speaker who has known Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein for years, has mediated on several occasions when Iraq and 
the United Nations were in the midst of a confrontation. Iraq wants 
the embargo lifted so it can resume exporting oil at full capacity 
and rebuild its shattered economy. It is permitted limited oil exports 
at present to buy food and medicine. Russia, meanwhile, is owed billions 
of dollars by Iraq and wants to help rebuild the country's oil industry 
when the sanctions are lifted. However, world oil prices are already 
sagging due to an oil glut, and if Iraq increased its exports it could 
push prices even lower.
