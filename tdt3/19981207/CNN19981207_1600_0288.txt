Secretary of state Madeleine Albright expressed discouragement today 
with Libya's handling of two suspects wanted in the terrorist bombing 
of Pan Am Flight 103. It exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie 
almost 10 years ago. 270 people died. The two intelligence agents 
accused of planting the bomb remain in Libya. The United States and 
Britain have proposed they be tried in the Netherlands. Albright says 
it's high-time that justice be served. It has taken much too long, 
much too long, for the Libyans to make up their minds as to whether 
they will accept an offer that they themselves wanted, and so did 
a number of other countries, to have a third country venue. Yesterday, 
U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan said he had nearly reached a deal 
with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi concerning the two suspects. Albright 
says she's still waiting on an answer.
