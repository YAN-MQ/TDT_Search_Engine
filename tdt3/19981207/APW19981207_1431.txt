After nearly two decades of separation, an Israeli father was reunited 
with his son, a U.S. Marine on military maneuvers in Israel's southern 
Negev Desert. The father, Dr. David Ben-Menachem said Monday the two 
were separated when his estranged wife Jennifer left Israel for Jamaica 
and then Florida almost twenty years ago with their son Yossi and 
two daughters. Ben-Menachem said that his efforts to remain in contact 
with his children were rebuffed by his former wife's family and he 
had since given up hope of reunion. Israeli journalists at the training 
exercises noticed the 19-year-old Marine speaking in Hebrew and when 
they approached him, Levitt said he wanted to meet his father who 
he had last seen as a young boy. The Yediot Ahronot newspaper printed 
Levitt's photo on Friday and the two were reunited at Levitt's training 
base Sunday. ``We talked about the past and will keep in contact in 
the future,'' Levitt told Channel Two. U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry 
Schwartz said Levitt would be given special leave at the end of the 
maneuvers to spend time with his father. Schwartz said the exercises 
were routine under U.S.-Israel security agreements, adding that Israel 
was one of the few countries in the region that allowed U.S. Marines 
to train on its soil. Schwartz said the fleet would return to sea 
before U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region from Saturday.
