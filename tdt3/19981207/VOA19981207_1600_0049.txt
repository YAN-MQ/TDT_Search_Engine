I'm John Birchard, VOA News. Violent clashes have broken out in nearly 
all major West Bank towns. In Nabulus Palestinian police fought a 
running gun battle with scores of angry members of Palestinian Yassar 
Arafat's Fatah faction. Several people were injured, including police. 
Dozens of Palestinians were injured when Israeli troops fired tear 
gas and rubber-coated metal bullets at stone-throwing demonstrators 
throughout the West Bank. The rioters are protesting Israel's handling 
of prisoner releases under the Wye accords.
