Katja Seizinger, the dominant women's skier last season, refused to 
end speculation Monday that her career may be ended because of a severe 
knee injury. Seizinger announced she won't compete this season because 
recovery from the June 24 injury, which included torn tendons, has 
been slower than expected. ``The decision didn't come easy, but the 
season is over for me,'' said Seizinger, a three-time Olympic gold 
medalist. The German, last year's overall World Cup champion, didn't 
say when she can return to competition or whether she will. ``I can't 
answer that question right now _ but my health is more important,'' 
said Seizinger. Wolfgang Maier, head coach of the German ski team, 
also said Monday the 26-year-old told him she wasn't certain about 
resuming her career. ``She told me she's leaving it open,'' Maier 
said. Seizinger had occasionally publicly talked bout retiring in 
the near future even before the knee injury and torn tendons suffered 
during training at Schnalstal in Italy. Seizinger, 26, had hoped to 
be back on the slopes in mid-December and make her comeback by the 
World Championships on Feb. 1 in Vail, Colorado. ``There's not enough 
time now _ the theme world championships has been written off,'' said 
Seizinger. Seizinger swept nine of her career 36 World Cup races en 
route to her second overall title last season. She then capped her 
year by winning Olympic gold in the downhill and combination. ``My 
first thought after my injury was, you really should have quit after 
Nagano,'' Seizinger said. Seizinger, a student, had in the past said 
she didn't plan to compete at the 2002 Winter Games. ``Vail would 
be a good place to finish,'' she said at the time.
