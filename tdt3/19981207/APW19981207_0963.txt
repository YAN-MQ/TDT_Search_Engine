Police on Monday arrested a man suspected of helping plan August's 
car bombing of the town of Omagh, Northern Ireland's deadliest-ever 
terrorist strike that left 29 dead. Detectives said they found a Kalashnikov 
assault rifle, a handgun, ammunition and a substantial cache of bomb-making 
components in a raid on the 42-year-old man's home in Dundalk, a border 
town in the Irish Republic 50 miles (80 kms) south of Belfast. Police 
in both parts of Ireland have already arrested but released without 
charge more than 40 people suspected of belonging to the Irish Republican 
Army dissident gang that carried out the Aug. 15 attack. However, 
none of those suspects was caught in possession of weaponry. The dissidents, 
who oppose the IRA's July 1997 cease-fire and refuse to call themselves 
by a different name, were dubbed the Real IRA by Irish media. They 
called a truce in September in response to public horror over Omagh. 
The arrest came as leaders of all eight Northern Irish parties that 
supported April's peace accord gathered in the United States to receive 
two joint peace awards. Among the leaders are Protestant politician 
David Trimble and Catholic politician John Hume, who on Thursday will 
share the Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo, Norway. But in 
a symbol of how far apart Northern Ireland's key peacemakers remain, 
Trimble decided not to attend the first awards ceremony Monday at 
the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, where Sen. Edward Kennedy was 
expected to greet the other seven leaders. Trimble's spokeswoman in 
Washington, Anne Smith, said he was staying in the capital for private 
engagements and had prerecorded a video ``thank you'' for the Boston 
event. On Tuesday, all eight have been invited for lunch at the British 
embassy in Washington before they receive a joint accolade from the 
National Democratic Institute. Trimble's Ulster Unionist, graf 9 pvs
