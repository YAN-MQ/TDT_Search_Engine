A Polish Olympic official denied Monday that Zakopane's bid to host 
the 2006 Games had been changed into a joint bid with neighboring 
Slovakia. Janusz Tatera, secretary general of the Polish Olympic Committee, 
was responding to rejection of a Polish-Slovak agreement by Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, head of the International Olympic Committee. ``There was 
some kind of misunderstanding. Nobody's talking of a joint bid,'' 
Tatera said in a telephone interview. Both Zakopane in Poland and 
Poprad-Tatry in Slovakia are bidding to host the 2006 Olympics. Other 
competitors are Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy; a joint bid by Helsinki, 
Finland, and Lillehammer, Norway; and Klagenfurt, Austria, making 
a three-country bid that includes regions of Slovenia and Italy. Environmental 
groups, intellectuals and some political leaders have criticized the 
Polish bid, saying the construction and alterations needed to stage 
the Olympics would permanently damage the pristine Tatra mountains 
in violation of environmental laws. Polish and Slovakian officials 
announced Sunday that if Zakopane wins and cannot get permission to 
hold the downhill skiing in Tatra National Park, the races would take 
place at Poprad. ``Poland and Slovakia together? It's too late,'' 
Samaranch said when asked about the agreement. ``We have six bids 
from Europe and we will be meeting about it next week. Now to change 
the bids would be too late.'' But Tatera said the agreement announced 
Sunday would only involve cooperation, rather than a joint candidacy. 
He said if Zakopane wins the bid, it can still make changes concerning 
the venue of particular events. Poland would hold the downhill skiing 
at Poprad only if the Olympic committee fails to get permission to 
organize the racing on the Polish side of the border, he said. Much 
of the Zakopane area is in the Tatra National Park, established in 
1954 to protect plants and wildlife. It was designated a natural reserve 
by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
in 1992. Tatra National Park includes Kasprowy Wierch, Poland's tallest 
mountain for skiers at 6,557 feet. (1,998 meters) It has two slopes, 
and park management has resisted calls to build more lifts, saying 
it would damage the environment. ``Nobody ever said there will be 
no permission from the national park for the downhill'' in Zakopane, 
Tatera said. ``This is a question of negotiations and compromise.'' 
Almost every Olympic city, such as Nagano earlier this year, has similar 
environmental problems, Tatera said.
