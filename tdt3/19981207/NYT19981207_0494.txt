A planned public relations drive by Robert Kraft, the owner of the 
New England Patriots, to win support for a new stadium in Hartford 
got off to a rocky start Monday when he stood up the editorial boards 
of three of the state's largest newspapers. ``It was a slap,'' said 
Barry S. Lewis, city editor of The Advocate in Stamford, one of the 
wealthier cities in the state and one where the team is hoping to 
attract buyers for luxury boxes at the proposed new stadium. ``This 
was their idea in the first place, and then he didn't show.'' With 
the legislature to begin debating the Patriots' proposed deal on Wednesday, 
a public relations firm for the team arranged visits by Kraft to three 
newspapers in Fairfield County and in New Haven _ the state's two 
most populous areas, and ones that would receive the least direct 
benefit from a $375 million, state-built stadium in Hartford. At Coach's 
Sports Bar and Grille here, where Kraft was also expected Monday, 
managers scurried around looking for Patriots memorabilia and prepared 
one of their ``sky box'' booths for 10 guests. There was no need _ 
Kraft was in Massachusetts. Stacey James, the Patriots' director of 
media relations, said Kraft had never been scheduled to be in the 
state Monday and blamed the team's Connecticut public relations firm, 
Cashman &AMP; Katz, for the mix-up. ``He feels terrible,'' James said. 
``We'll be sure apologies are extended.'' The firm said it had expected 
Kraft to appear Tuesday. A Patriots vice president kept the appointments. 
The public relations people who had arranged the Connecticut visits 
did not explain Kraft's absence, leading to awkward moments as the 
greeting parties wondered if perhaps he was still on the way. Timothy 
M. Sowecke, publisher of The New Haven Register, said his readers 
would have appreciated having Kraft explain the issues in person. 
``I hope he's not taking the New Haven area for granted,'' said Sowecke, 
who added that his newspaper had generally supported the Patriots' 
plan. Kraft also had been scheduled to talk with editors at The Connecticut 
Post, in Bridgeport. Kraft and Gov. John G. Rowland are to face a 
skeptical audience as they address legislators at Wednesday's public 
hearing on their tentative agreement to move the team to a stadium 
that is to be built by the state and turned over to the Patriots rent 
free. Many legislators, while acknowledging that the state had to 
offer Kraft a good deal to lure him, have wondered whether the deal 
that Rowland negotiated was sweeter than it needed to be. Andy Wasynczuk, 
the Patriots' vice president for business operations and the official 
who appeared at the editorial boards, offered a preview of the Patriots' 
position on Monday, saying that Connecticut taxpayers were actually 
getting a better deal than those in other cities where new stadiums 
have been built. Wasynczuk noted that many stadiums were financed 
by sales tax increases, which are not part of the Patriots' package. 
He said he also was eager to explain to legislators that the tentative 
agreement was already the product of much give and take and that the 
team did not want to make any more changes. ``If you're buying a car 
and somebody quoted you a price and they've got the mats thrown in 
and then you say, `I'll do that deal if you throw in the sunroof,''' 
he said, ``it's kind of like, `Well, wait a minute, I thought we shook 
on a deal.''' The public relations drive is to continue on Tuesday, 
when Kraft is to appear with five Patriots players _ including quarterback 
Drew Bledsoe _ at a rally in Hartford and make what a news release 
called ``large donations'' to a youth football program in Connecticut. 
James said those events were on Kraft's calendar.
