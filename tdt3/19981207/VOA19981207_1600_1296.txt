Meantime, the magistrate leading the to alleged doping an Italian 
football is looking at the premature deaths of 45 players in the past 
ten years. Italian media say that Raphael Guaranello wants to see 
whether the deaths of players who were born in the 1950s and '60s 
were connected with illicit drug use. The magistrate could not be 
reached for comment. The investigation was triggered in July when 
Italian Cerea coach, Zenenek Ziemon of A.S. Roma told a magazine that 
drug-taking was common in the league. Ziemon's allegation had a wide 
impact, leading to the closure of the main test laboratory for the 
Italian Olympic committee. Five lab technicians were later fired and 
the head of the Olympic committee resigned. That's sports. I'm Park 
Brewer.
