Britain granted financial assistance totaling 1.6 million ringgit 
(dlrs 400,000) to the Malaysian Trust Council for use in sponsoring 
102 Malaysian students' studies in Britain, a news report said Monday. 
British High Commissioner (ambassador) Graham Fry formally presented 
a check for the aid, saying his country was the first to extend help 
to Malaysian students facing financial difficulties arising from the 
current economic downturn in the Southeast Asian country, state-run 
Bernama news agency reported. There are about 1,700 Malaysian Trust 
Council-sponsored students studying abroad in Britain this year. The 
aid money will allow several students who had planned to cancel their 
stay in Britain to continue studying there, the report said.
