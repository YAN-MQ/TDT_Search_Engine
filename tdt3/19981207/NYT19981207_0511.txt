When the organizers of a conference at the Fordham University School 
of Law decided on their theme _ ``Rediscovering the Role of Religion 
in the Lives of Lawyers and Those They Represent'' _ the Rev. J. Philip 
Wogaman seemed a logical choice as keynote speaker. ``We invited him 
because he is one of the leading scholars of Christian ethics,'' said 
Russell Pearce, organizer of the conference and an associate professor 
of law at Fordham. ``His role as pastor became more of a big deal 
after we invited him.'' As senior minister of the Foundry United Methodist 
Church in Washington, Wogaman has a unique perspective on legal ethics 
and religion: He is pastor to President Clinton and his family and 
one of three clergymen giving the president religious and personal 
counseling during his impeachment crisis. Speaking Monday at the first 
gathering of 120 lawyers, law professors, theologians, scholars, ministers, 
priests and rabbis, Wogaman noted that he was pastor to some 300 Washington 
lawyers and the father of a lawyer. He traced the accelerating search 
for higher meaning in the practice of law at a time when the profession's 
reputation has sunk through one notorious case after another. And 
while he did not dwell on the crisis swirling about his most famous 
parishioner, he did meet the audience's expectation that he would 
discuss the matter. ``The president, alleged to have committed perjury, 
is thereby considered by some to have violated the most sacred of 
all trusts,'' he said. ``I do not wonder that some commentators have 
considered this a matter of ultimate importance, although the breaking 
of the law _ if that is what happened _ does not logically entail 
a particular penalty such as impeachment. ``The question before the 
nation and the Congress,'' he suggested, ``is whether an ordinary 
human caught up like this president is would be subject to punishment.'' 
Noting that he was ``in a peculiar position to reflect on the force 
of law and the realities intersecting with it,'' he said, ``I am struck 
by Sept. 11, the day of the White House prayer breakfast. Everyone 
there agreed on a need for repentance and on an openness to grace 
and forgiveness. ``That was also the day the Starr report was released, 
whose focus was condemnation and a narrow application of the law.'' 
While Wogaman was the main draw, the opening session was marked by 
discussions on how best to infuse the practice of law with religious 
and moral principles without breaching the constitutional separation 
of church and state. ``The prevailing belief is that we are servants 
of the law itself, not of God through law,'' said Mohammed Fadel, 
a Muslim and a student at the University of Virginia Law School. ``The 
law is the product of the state, so we can't really complain that 
lawyers are not moral giants.'' Rabbi Arnold Goodman of the Ahavath 
Achim Synagogue, a Conservative Jewish congregation in Atlanta, posed 
a particularly perplexing question: ``If my religion informs me not 
to harm others who do not threaten me in any way, how can I, if I 
am a laywer, enable my client to prevail _ and by doing that, cause 
harm to another?'' Fadel responded: ``If you refuse to represent your 
client unless you are certain he is right, you are harming him. You 
cannot escape judgment.'' Workshops and panels Tuesday and Wednesday 
at the symposium, which was organized by the Auburn Theological Seminary 
and the Jewish Theological Seminary, among others, will include discussions 
on how to better infuse the law with the moral principles of religion 
and how to restore trust and confidence in it. Topics to be covered 
include ``How Does a Religious Lawyer Practice Legal Ethics in Corporate 
Practice?'' and ``How Does a Religious Lawyer Include Moral Content 
in Conversations With Clients?'' Out of this, Pearce, the conference 
organizer, said, would come plans for organizing teams of clergy members 
and lawyers in 19 cities.
