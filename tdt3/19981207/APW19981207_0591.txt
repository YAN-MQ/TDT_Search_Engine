Dozens of Ukrainian opposition party activists and lawmakers demonstrated 
Monday near the Swiss Embassy in Kiev to protest the arrest of their 
leader in Switzerland on money-laundering charges. The protesters, 
from the centrist Hromada movement, held placards that read: ``Hands 
off the leader of Hromada!'' and ``Switzerland, stop playing political 
games!'' Hromada chief and former Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, 
45, who is now a lawmaker in the Ukrainian parliament, was detained 
last Wednesday as he drove from France into Switzerland. Swiss authorities 
charged him in a money-laundering scheme on Friday. According to investigating 
Judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, a ``relatively large'' sum of money 
had been seized in Geneva in connection with the charges against Lazarenko. 
Last month, Swiss federal police announced that Switzerland was helping 
Ukrainian authorities track down money Lazarenko allegedly stashed 
in Swiss banks. Switzerland has handed over some bank documents to 
Ukraine, and investigations are underway in several Swiss states. 
Ukrainian authorities are already investigating whether Lazarenko 
and other Hromada leaders have been involved in corruption. Lazarenko 
was prime minister from 1996 to 1997, and was dismissed by President 
Leonid Kuchma. Critics say Lazarenko reaped huge profits from the 
distribution of natural gas supplies in the former Soviet republic 
when he served as prime minister, but he and his allies deny the charges. 
Lazarenko says the authorities want to discredit him before presidential 
elections in October 1999, and he has even accused Kuchma's close 
entourage of plotting to kill him. Lazarenko's party fared well in 
parliamentary elections this year and he was widely considered a top 
contender in the future presidential race. His arrest appears to deal 
his chances a severe blow. Several Hromada legislators from among 
Monday's protesters met with the Swiss ambassador, presenting the 
embassy with a letter that said Lazarenko's arrest was a ``planned 
action of reprisal against a politician whose party is in the opposition,'' 
the Interfax news agency reported. Lazarenko's initial term of arrest 
is eight days. A hearing is expected this week and Kasper-Ansermet, 
the judge, has said he would ask to detain the Ukrainian politician 
until trial. An investigator from Switzerland was expected to arrive 
in Ukraine Monday for meetings with his Ukrainian counterparts investigating 
Lazarenko's case, said Tetiana Zadorozhna, one of the protesting legislators.
