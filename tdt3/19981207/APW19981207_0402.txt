The Kurdish rebel leader detained in Rome was questioned Monday by 
a French magistrate investigating extortion attempts against Kurdish 
residents in France. The magistrate flew to Rome to interrogate Abdullah 
Ocalan, who heads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been 
fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The Italian 
news agency ANSA said the French magistrate was investigating efforts 
by the PKK to shake down Kurds in France. Ocalan has been detained 
in Italy since arriving from Moscow Nov. 12. Turkey, which considers 
him a terrorist responsible for thousands of deaths, has demanded 
his extradition, but Italy has refused because he could face the death 
penalty. Germany has also issued warrants for Ocalan on terrorist 
charges, but has declined to seek his extradition fearing it could 
cause unrest in the country's 2-million-strong Turkish community. 
Italy is now seeking support from its European allies for some sort 
of international tribunal to try him.
