White House attorneys will begin calling 14 witnesses tomorrow to 
mount a defense against impeaching President Clinton from. White House 
press secretary Joe Lockhart says the attorneys will present "exculpatory" 
evidence that independent counsel Ken Starr did not include in his 
report to Congress. First, four legal experts will discuss the "historical 
precedents and constitutional standards" for impeachment. The president's 
team will have 30 hours over two days to present its case. House Judiciary 
committee chairman Henry Hyde says committee staffers are drafting 
three articles of impeachment against President Clinton. He says they 
include what he calls "the generic issues" of perjury, obstruction 
of justice and abuse of power. Hyde says he predicts the White House 
defense will be a legal seminar, and not a rebuttal of the allegations. 
The White House lawyers chose to oos their time to attack Mr. Starr 
rather than answer the facts of the case against the president. In 
so doing, the White House continued in the direction it has chosen 
months ago when it decided to avoid the facts and attack the process 
hoping that in so doing it would turn the public's attention away 
from an alleged pattern of impeachable behavior. White House press 
secretary Joe Lockhart says much of the president's defense will focus 
on constitutional issues. I think we want to lay out a serious case 
in defense of these allegations. First and foremost at the beginning, 
talking about the constitutional standards, and then move towards 
the president president's counsel. One of the things you you have 
to recognize is that the committee didn't call anyone. There's no 
one to rebutt. We have the report from the independent counsel and 
we will address the allegations that are raised in that report. Hyde 
says a committee vote on censure has not been ruled out.
