In what Neal Gabler smilingly calls his unified field theory of American 
culture, his new book portrays the United States in an age of post-reality, 
a Republic of Entertainment increasingly devoted to indulging the 
fantasy lives of its citizens. Costumed in Ralph Lauren colonialist 
garb, slenderized in health clubs, body-sculptured by plastic surgeons 
and coached on lifestyle by Martha Stewart, ordinary Americans, he 
says in ``Life the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality'' (Knopf), 
are appropriating the trappings of celebrity to carve out prime roles 
in their own life movie. In the fame-driven future he envisions, everyone 
will be anonymous for 15 minutes, but Gabler, looking every bit the 
cultural critic (Armani black, stubbly salt-and-pepper whiskers), 
doesn't seem overly worried. ``Anyone who writes seriously about American 
culture is not in danger of becoming a celebrity,'' he said. Still, 
Gabler, the author of books on Walter Winchell and Hollywood, does 
not protest when lunch is arranged at Jean Georges on Central Park 
West. It is, after all, a locale in Woody Allen's new movie, ``Celebrity,'' 
featuring Judy Davis, Kenneth Branagh, Joe Mantegna, Leonardo DiCaprio, 
Melanie Griffith, Bebe Neuwirth, Winona Ryder, Gretchen Mol, Isaac 
Mizrahi, Erica Jong, Anthony Mason, Andre Gregory, Donald Trump, Donna 
Hanover and Joey and Mary Jo Buttafuoco. Unfortunately, or fortunately, 
none are in sight this lunchtime as the 48-year-old Gabler settles 
onto a banquette and, forgoing wine as too enervating at midday, orders 
a sparkling water. ``If by my theory the movie never ends,'' said 
Gabler, ``right now we're doing the interview scene.'' Contemporary 
American culture may be the first in history to permit its citizens 
to live entirely within their own manufactured realities, said Gabler, 
citing the social historian Daniel J. Boorstin. Increasingly, Gabler 
said, Americans are altering their lives to conform to their movie 
fantasies, whether it means shopping in entertainment zones or vacationing 
on entertainment farms or retreating completely into richly fabricated 
cyberidentities on the Internet. Where once movies were judged by 
how closely they approximated life, now life is rated by how closely 
it conforms to the movies. Even celebrity criminals from Timothy McVeigh 
to the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, and John Lennon's assassin, 
Mark David Chapman, seemed consumed by how their acts would play for 
a movie-addicted society, Gabler said. News, too, he said, is increasingly 
packaged as entertainment, with wars and presidential crises getting 
pithy rubrics (``Crisis in the Gulf,'' ``White House Under Siege'') 
like movie titles. ``We always thought that politics and economics 
are the crucial forces of our time, but entertainment is the most 
inexorable force of the 20th century,'' Gabler said, lofting a morsel 
of chevre-and-salmon mousse in a pastry shell. ``We export it and 
the world eats it up. It's the best hunger-satisfier that man has 
ever devised.'' Wondering if anything could resist this force, he 
said, he thought that perhaps Tibetan monks might be immune. But when 
Gabler said he ventured that thesis to a friend involved in Tibetan 
causes, the man laughed. He had once run into the Dalai Lama at the 
Formosa Cafe, a landmark movie-star haunt in West Hollywood. A waiter 
arrives with tureens of spicy carrot soup with shrimp and ceremoniously 
whisks off the lids. ``In the Republic of Entertainment, all are equal,'' 
Gabler said, eyeing the starring dishes. In the life movie, places 
celebrities go become celebrities themselves. And what about him? 
Wasn't he a player in the life movie too? Gabler did not deny it. 
``To describe this and not implicate yourself is to be duplicitous,'' 
he said. ``There's no way you can theorize and say you're not in the 
movie.'' But at least, he said, he was acknowledging it. His life 
is hardly in the limelight, however. He lives with his wife and two 
daughters, 11 and 14, year-round in Amagansett, N.Y., venturing into 
Manhattan only intermittently. He runs seven miles each morning and 
spends most of his day closeted with his writing, including a forthcoming 
biography of Walt Disney. Waiters arrived bearing platters of halibut 
and clams. Gabler ordered another sparkling water. ``Life the Movie'' 
follows his two books on popular culture, ``An Empire of Their Own: 
How the Jews Invented Hollywood'' (1988) and ``Winchell: Gossip, Power 
and the Culture of Celebrity'' (1994). The latest book grew out of 
an essay he wrote, ``Now Playing: Real Life, the Movie,'' for The 
New York Times Arts &AMP; Leisure section in 1991. He waited until 
he had finished the Winchell book and then spent three years on ``Life 
the Movie,'' two years longer than he had expected. ``Nothing is ever 
short in my movies,'' he said, likening his life, too, to a film. 
``They're like `Lawrence of Arabia.''' His method is to read omnivorously 
and keep voluminous notes on index cards, one thought to a card. That 
way, ``as Hitchcock said, by the time you start to shoot the film, 
it's done,'' Gabler said, as the fish course gave way to venison. 
Gabler traces the rise of entertainment culture to the nation's beginnings 
and an affinity for lowbrow amusements. ``Trash was deliberate,'' 
he said. ``Americans were literate. They chose trash because it was 
a glorification of the democratic impulse.'' So this is bad, right? 
Not necessarily, Gabler said, calling his ambiguity the most wrenching 
part of his survey. In an abrupt turnabout at the end of his book, 
written amid a continuing yin-yang internal debate, he declines to 
condemn the trend, citing studies that have found ``positive-illusionists'' 
to be in better mental health than realists. ``We can't live without 
illusions,'' he said. ``If a person can help himself by buying Ralph 
Lauren pants and Martha Stewart makeovers, what's wrong with that?'' 
He derided what he called an old Marxist mantra: ``You don't know 
how bad you have it.'' On the other hand, he said, ``there is something 
to be said for the grief and suffering we go through. Life is traditionally 
defined not by how pleasant it is but what Isaiah Berlin called `the 
grit in the oyster.''' Still he said, as the meal ended with a pear 
sorbet and sliced pear, chocolate balls and coffee, ``life in which 
you approximate your dreams is not a bad life.'' He anticipates a 
happy twist to his life movie, too, he said, a scene in which a filmmaker 
options his book for a documentary, to be called, perhaps ``Life the 
Movie, the Movie.''
