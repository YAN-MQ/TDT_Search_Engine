I'm Dave DeForest, VOA News. There were clashes throughout the West 
Bank Monday as Palestinians continued protesting Israel's handling 
of prisoner releases. In the biggest West Bank town, Nabulus, Palestinians 
turned their anger against Yassar Arafat's Palestinian police. We 
have more from VOA's David Gollust in Jerusalem. Demonstrations spread 
to every major West Bank town and dozens of Palestinians were injured 
in clashes with both Israeli and Palestinian security forces. Palestinians 
accuse Israel of violating the Wye River Agreement by releasing mainly 
criminal detainees rather than political and military prisoners in 
the first phase of implementation last month. Several thousand protesters 
marched in Nabulus, the biggest West Bank town which is controlled 
by the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian police open fire on demonstrators 
trying to storm their headquarters and at least seven were wounded. 
At several other locations in the West Bank, Israeli security forces 
used rubber-coated bullets against stone-throwing protesters with 
injuries on both sides. Near Jerusalem, an Israeli civilian whose 
car had been stoned shot and seriously wounded a young Palestinian.
