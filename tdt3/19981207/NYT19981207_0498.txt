Trying to reverse New York state's shrinking share of grant money 
for biomedical research, 10 of the state's academic medical institutions 
are joining to create a large center for the industry. The complex, 
the New York Structural Biology Center, will be owned and operated 
by the 10 medical institutions in the consortium and is expected to 
open on the campus of the City University of New York sometime next 
year. The center will house complex and enormous machines that employ 
high-field magnets used to study molecules, a costly and highly coveted 
type of biomedical research. The consortium will consist of the Albert 
Einstein College of Medicine, the City University of New York, Columbia 
University, Cornell University, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
Center, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York University School 
of Medicine, Rockefeller University, the State University of New York 
at Stony Brook, and the Wadsworth Center, as well as the New York 
State Department of Health. Officials said the consortium was unusual 
for a few reasons. The participating medical institutions are far 
more accustomed to competing with one another than combining forces, 
and an agreement of this scale is extremely rare. The complex's size 
of 34,000 square feet in a place as cramped as New York City is uncommon. 
Although the medical institutions will own and operate the center, 
its construction is being financed by private investors. That infusion 
of cash from a group of New York City businesses underscores the private 
sector's desperation to draw and maintain a core of research wizards 
that have recently opted for other cities. It will take about $20 
million to build and operate the new center initially. Health officials 
say that a large pool of cash and a collaborative rather than competitive 
strategy is needed if New York state hopes to fight its way back to 
being the top recipient of federal grants.
