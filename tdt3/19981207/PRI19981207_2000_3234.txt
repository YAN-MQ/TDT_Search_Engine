You don't hear much folk music on American pop radio stations, even 
though a lot of pop comes from folk music styles. But the pop music 
in Algeria shows its roots and it shows them proudly. This is Algerian 
singer, string player, and composer, Elsic Amaya, a rising star in 
Algerian pop music. Elsic Amaya was trained in the classical style 
of Andaluge and Algerian music. It taps into the traditions of southern 
Spain from the tenth to the 15th centuries, when Arabs, Christians, 
and Sephardic Jews lived in relative harmony. The 20th century music 
of Elsic Amaya capitalizes on the cross-fertilization of cultures 
from that time. Elsic Amaya blends the passion of flamenco guitars 
with the free style vocal improvisations of the Arabic Muba. "Allahya 
Allah" by Elsic Amaya puts the finishing touches on today's show.
