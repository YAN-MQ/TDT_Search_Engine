Companies that want to reprice options because their stock price is 
depressed, but thought that they had months left to act, scrambled 
Monday to get the job done before Dec. 15, when favorable accounting 
treatment will end. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has been 
moving for months to require that repriced options be recorded as 
an expense, just like wages, on a company's profit-and-loss statement. 
But in a surprise move, the board decided Friday that regardless of 
when the new rule is formally adopted it will be effective Dec. 15. 
``The board created a narrow window to reprice _ and a trap for the 
uninformed,'' said Brian Foley, an executive compensation lawyer in 
White Plains, N.Y. That narrow window was criticized by Nell Minnow, 
a principal at Lens Inc., an investment firm that has fought option 
repricings. ``The board should make its rule retroactive to Jan 1, 
1998,'' Ms. Minnow said. ``You shouldn't have a window of any kind 
because it creates all kinds of perverse incentives for managements 
to give themselves extra holiday presents.'' Alan Johnson, a New York 
compensation consultant to companies, said that since Friday ``the 
accounting firms have been out telling people this is the last bite 
at the apple.'' Paula Todd, a principal at Towers Perrin, a compensation 
consulting company, said her company and its competitors ``were counseling 
clients when the market dipped to not rush, to wait and see what the 
market was going to do because one of the problems about repricing 
was to do it prematurely.'' She added: ``So, there are a lot of companies 
that were sitting tight, trying to be responsible, that now find themselves 
in a tough spot. This is one of those no-good-deed-goes-unpunished 
stories.'' She said she worked with two companies Monday that were 
trying to decide if they would reprice and if they could move fast 
enough. But at Mercer Management Consulting, the nation's largest 
compensation advice firm, not one client of its New York office had 
called by Monday evening to ask how to reprice before next Tuesday, 
said Yale Tauber, a principal. A Towers Perrin survey, to be released 
soon, found that repricing was being considered by only about one 
in six companies that have options priced significantly above the 
company's current share price. Ms. Todd and Tauber said interest in 
rapid repricing would be concentrated in high-technology companies 
that use options as the most important part of a pay package. Stock 
options have become an increasingly popular way to pay executives, 
and even some nonmanagerial-level employees, because no expense is 
recorded on a company's annual profit-and-loss statement, yet the 
company gets an income-tax deduction. Instead, the expense is treated 
as a change on the company's balance sheet, where assets and liabilities 
are recorded. As options have become more common, the practice of 
repricing them when a company's stock price falls has also spread. 
Some companies have repriced options three, four or five times in 
recent years. Since the stock market's dip over the summer, repricings 
have been disclosed in regulatory filings by more than 100 companies. 
Timothy Lucas, the accounting board's research director, said that 
requiring companies to treat repriced options as an expense on their 
profit-and-loss statement was consistent with a 1972 opinion by the 
board's predecessor. That opinion held that a variable stock option 
plan _ in which the number of options or their strike price would 
be determined based on future events _ had to be treated as an expense. 
``We think repricing options makes them variable,'' he said. Johnson 
said the short deadline was part of a pattern by the board to tighten 
the availability of options that are not recorded as an expense. He 
noted that the board tried two years ago to require that all options 
be treated as expenses, but that fierce opposition from corporations, 
and a Senate vote overwhelmingly supporting the companies, persuaded 
the board to relent. He said the board ``is doing what all regulators 
do when they can't get what they want directly.'' ``They are rewriting 
the regulations to get closer to what they want,'' he said, adding, 
``The result is more confusing regulations, which creates more fees 
for people like me, and which is wonderful for people like me, but 
not for U.S. business.''
