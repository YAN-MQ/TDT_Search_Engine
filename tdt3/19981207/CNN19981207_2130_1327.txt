As expected, the diamondbacks signed Steve Finley despite a career-low 
249 average with San Diego last season. As you can see, Arizona did 
not sign the center fielder for his bat. Baseball has become that 
kind of game now where players seem to change teams quite often and, 
you know, hopefully, you know, I found a team I can be with here for 
a while and be successful with. When I came over here and visited, 
I saw what a great organization they put together, and, you know, 
they're going nowhere but up. Finley is the sixth free agent Arizona 
has signed this season. Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports."
