Astronauts on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour have begun a space 
walk to connect power cables in the world's first international space 
station. The cables will make the first two sections of the station 
that will be used by astronauts for experiments and accommodation. 
NASA spokesman John Arapidy at mission control in Houston says they're 
breaking new ground. The most visible feature is more than an acre 
of solar panels designed to capture power from the sun and convert 
it to electrical power for the station. It will be on a very exciting 
permanently manned research laboratory that will give us the opportunity 
to do things that we simply can't do on Earth. Over the next five 
years, hundreds of components will be added, involving 16 nations 
and 43 more missions.
