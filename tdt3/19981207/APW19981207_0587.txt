Hungary will be given membership in NATO in March, Defense Minister 
Janos Szabo was cited as saying on Monday. ``According to the latest 
reports we have, Hungary will be a full member of NATO in March,'' 
Szabo said, according to state radio. There was no word from Poland 
and the Czech Republic _ the other two former Soviet bloc nations 
expected to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization next year. 
But with membership for all three considered a package, the Hungarian 
announcement indicated that the other two would also be offered full 
NATO status in March. The three had been expected to be given full 
membership in April at a Washington ceremony marking the organization's 
50th birthday. Szabo's announcement appeared to confirm speculation 
that the date would be changed to avoid slighting Russia, which also 
will be attending the anniversary ceremonies. Moscow opposes expansion 
of NATO and is particularly against its former allies becoming members.
