Cesar, a prominent French artist who created large sculptures formed 
by crushed cars and scrap iron, died on Sunday in Paris. He was 77. 
Friends said the cause was cancer. Cesar _ he was born Cesar Baldaccini 
but used only his first name _ was France's best-known sculptor of 
recent decades, yet his works provoked strongly contradictory reactions. 
``Cesar was loved and detested,'' Le Monde wrote on Monday. Only late 
in life was he embraced by the French cultural establishment: He was 
France's representative at the 1995 Venice Biennale (where he showed 
a 500-ton monument of crushed cars); and his first retrospective in 
a French museum was not held until last year, at the Jeu de Paume. 
By then, however, the work by the stocky, bearded artist had begun 
to look dated. ``His love of life and good humor barely disguised 
his anxiety and his legitimate desire to be recognized as one of the 
great sculptors of his time,'' said Jack Lang, a former French culture 
minister. He once complained that he never had an art dealer to promote 
him in the United States and that he had not been properly recognized 
in Paris. At least two of his sculptures are nonetheless seen daily 
by thousands of Parisians: a large equestrianlike statue, ``Centaur 
_ Homage to Picasso,'' which stands on Rue du Cherche-Midi along the 
Left Bank; and ``La Pouce,'' a 40-foot-high reproduction of his thumb 
at La Defense in western Paris. Born in Marseilles to Italian immigrant 
parents, Cesar left school at 12 to help his father make casks, but 
at 15 he began night classes at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Marseilles. 
Six years later, he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where 
he lived for the rest of his life. Working first with plaster and 
iron, then with lead, wire and ceramics, he was initially influenced 
by Brancusi, Picasso, Giacometti and Germaine Richier. In the early 
1950s, when he was too poor to buy materials, he was delighted to 
discover the potential offered by scrap iron. ``You can find it anywhere 
and buy it for almost nothing,'' he later explained. He began by creating 
what became known as his beastiary, a series of fish, animals and 
insects made of scrap iron that earned him an invitation to exhibit 
at the 1956 Venice Biennale. In 1960, he presented his first crushed 
cars at the Salon de Mai, provoking an outcry from many French art 
critics. ``People thought I did it so I'd be talked about, because 
I was a `provocateur,''' he recalled, although conceding that it was 
a form of rebellion to present ``such an aggressive object.'' These 
works led him to be associated with the New Realists. In the 1960s, 
when one art critic described him as a ``modern predator of industrial 
folklore,'' he saw his work as going in three directions: ``compression'' 
(cars), ``expansion'' (multicolored lavalike sculptures made of polyurethane) 
and ``prints'' (``La Pouce'' or an enlarged breast). In 1976, he gained 
still greater renown in an unexpected way: He was commissioned to 
create the trophy for a new French equivalent of the Oscar film awards, 
the Cesar. ``He loved cinema and he liked being its symbol,'' said 
Daniel Toscan du Plantier, who heads France's movie industry academy.
