The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee asserted Monday that 
his panel had built a ``compelling case'' for the impeachment of President 
Clinton and challenged the president and his lawyers one last time 
to contest the evidence against him. On the eve of a critical two-day 
presentation of the president's defense before the Judiciary panel, 
the committee chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, impatiently dismissed Clinton's 
decision to call constitutional scholars and legal experts to argue 
that the framers of the Constitution did not envision impeachment 
as a punishment for personal misbehavior. ``For almost two months, 
I have been pleading with the White House and the committee Democrats 
to present some additional evidence that might demonstrate the president's 
innocence,'' said Hyde said at a news conference, surrounded by four 
stacks of legal boxes reminding television viewers of the 60,000 pages 
of evidence sent to the House by the independent counsel, Kenneth 
Starr. ``I haven't heard anybody say Monica Lewinsky is a liar.'' 
As committee Republicans worked behind closed doors Monday to refine 
three or four articles of impeachment against Clinton, the president's 
allies, across the political spectrum, beseeched Clinton and his lawyers 
to do more than offer a legalistic defense against the perjury and 
obstruction charges related to his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. The White 
House, in releasing the list of 14 witnesses who will help make Clinton's 
defense, said it would indeed extensively address both the facts and 
the law before the Judiciary Committee. But with sentiment in the 
Republican-controlled Congress hardening against Clinton, and his 
fate dependent on perhaps 20 to 30 wavering moderate Republicans, 
Clinton's allies called for one more public apology or written statement 
or dramatic gesture to reverse the momentum before the full House 
votes next week. ``I know from talking to a number of Republicans 
that they need some comfort, some assurance that he understands what 
he's done,'' said Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican who has been 
trying to build support for censure. ``He's got to make some admissions. 
He's got to come forward. ``There's no doubt the momentum is against 
censure and for impeachment,'' he added. Democrats made the same appeal, 
telling the White House that the president had to somehow show he 
was more concerned with the possibility of impeachment than with protecting 
himself from prosecution for perjury after he leaves office. ``I think 
it would be a good idea if the president again faced the American 
people,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass. Joe Lockhart, a White House 
spokesman, seemed to downplay the chance of such an appearance. ``The 
president is second to none in recognizing what was wrong in his behavior 
and apologizing to those who he's affected and hurt,'' he said. Republicans 
say it is now inevitable that the Judiciary Committee will report 
out one to four articles of impeachment against the president by the 
end of the week. The committee's Republicans were working to set down 
one or two counts of perjury, a count of obstruction of justice and 
a count of abuse of power. They called the drafts still a work in 
progress. ``It's very fluid,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.. ``It 
depends on where we come out when the evidence door is closed.'' For 
the first time, he and Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., suggested that 
Republicans were even considering citing Clinton's legalistic answers 
to 81 questions from the House Judiciary Committee as an instance 
of lying under oath. Canady said the answers contained ``willful misstatements 
of the facts'' in the way the president characterized his conversations 
with his personal secretary, Betty Currie, about gifts he had given 
to Ms. Lewinsky and about conversations he had with his secretary 
the day after he had denied that he and the intern had an affair during 
his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case. ``I think 
that he's lying in those answers,'' Canady said. Republicans said 
they were still debating whether there should be one count of perjury 
or two. And they said they were most divided over whether to charge 
Clinton with abuse of power. ``That's the one where there's some divergent 
views,'' said Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio. Rep. Howard Gekas, R-Pa., 
said he had reservations about charging abuse of power based on the 
president's invocations of executive privilege. ``I have trouble with 
it,'' he said.
