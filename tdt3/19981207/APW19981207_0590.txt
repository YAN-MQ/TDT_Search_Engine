The United States is putting together an aid package for Georgia that 
will include dlrs 5 million in cash and 35,000 tons of wheat, a presidential 
aide said Sunday. The aid package was unveiled at a meeting Saturday 
between President Eduard Shevardnadze and U.S. Ambassador Kenneth 
Yallovic, presidential spokemsan Vakhtang Abashidze told reporters. 
The cash will be used to support social programs in Georgia, he said. 
Georgia's central bank, meanwhile, has ceased propping up the lari 
and introduced a floating rate for the currency, according to Teimuraz 
Basilia, a presidential economic aide. He said the decision allowing 
the currency to float freely has the full support of the International 
Monetary Fund. Georgia has asked the IMF to help cope with the impact 
of Russia's economic crisis, poor harvests and a lack of fuel. A drought 
last summer halved Georgia's grain harvest and caused a significant 
reduction in hydroelectric output. The power shortage has already 
forced authorities to ration energy and residents of Tbilisi are getting 
electricity for just six hours a day. Basilia said the German government 
plans to extend a 40-year credit of 63 million marks (dlrs 37 million) 
to Georgia to restore a number of electric power plants on Vartsikhe 
river in the Southern Georgia.
