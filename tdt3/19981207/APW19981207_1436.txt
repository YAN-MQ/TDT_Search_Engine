The European Union endorsed a call by Italy and Germany Monday for 
a court in a neutral nation to try Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan 
who remains under police guard in Rome following his Nov. 15 arrest. 
EU foreign ministers issued a statement denouncing international terrorism 
and Ocalan's outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK. They also backed 
Italy for not extraditing Ocalan to Turkey where he could face the 
death penalty. Germany, which has issued a warrant for Ocalan's arrest, 
has ruled out seeking his extradition for fear of stirring unrest 
among the nation's Turkish population of 2 million, one-fifth of which 
are Kurds. Instead, Italy and Germany want an international tribunal 
to try him. That view was endorsed by the other 13 EU nations, but 
there is no international court with an clear mandate to take the 
case. ``This is not a problem for two, or three countries, but for 
the whole of Europe,'' Italian Foreign Ministers Lamberto Dini told 
reporters. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said ministers agreed 
the Council of Europe, a 40-nation organization that promotes democracy 
and human rights, should be asked to look for a solution. The council 
has a 1972 protocol allowing for the transfer of trials from one member 
nation to another. The PKK has fought a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy 
in Turkey, in which about 37,000 people have been killed. Ocalan faces 
murder and terror charges in Turkey.
