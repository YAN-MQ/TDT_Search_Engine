Six miners have been rescued after spending 27 days trapped underground. 
All six are said to be recovering in the hospital. The accident took 
place at a mine close to the capital, Beijing. Duncan Hewitt reports. 
The six miners were working in a shaft at a gypsum mine in Longyau 
County when the roof suddenly caved in, leaving them trapped some 
300 meters from the entrance. They ate the leather belts they had 
been wearing and collected water dripping from the roof of the mine 
shaft to drink. On the 27th day of their ordeal, rescuers finally 
succeeded in reaching them. After 10 days of treatment in a local 
hospital, all six are now said to be recovering. It's the latest in 
a series of disasters in China's notoriously dangerous mines. Duncan 
Hewitt, BBC, Beijing.
