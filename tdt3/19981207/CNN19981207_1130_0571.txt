Many family counselors once believed the demands of two careers could 
harm a marriage. Dan Rutz says a new study suggests the opposite. 
Dawn Zachariah loves the radio business. She's sold commercial time 
for 16 years. You wanted cobb county. Women 18 to 24? And you'll fax 
this over to me. Her husband, Allan, is also in a high-profile career, 
as partner in a major accounting firm. When they met as teenagers, 
both knew about each others' commitments to careers and marriage. 
You know your relationship is not something you just put on the shelf 
and let it sit there. I would not want to have to work really, really 
hard all day, and then come home and have to really work hard on marriage. 
This loving family helps psychologists prove their point, that neither 
climbing the career ladder, nor staying at home, makes or breaks a 
Marriage. I think we've had this myth, this rosy view of homemakers 
that they kind of sit around and relax all day when, in fact, they're 
working very hard and they experience sex problems in their marriage. 
They experience fatigue, and so do women who are employed full time. 
This wife/husband research team finds that sexual desire and frequency 
are about the same, regardless of where couples work. The research 
here isn't just about sex. The University of Wisconsin scientists 
say their work is helping to prove that problems with intimacy often 
run a lot deeper than many couples are willing to admit. I think a 
lot of people do ignore their relationships. I think a lot of people 
have fallen into a pattern of taking their relationship for granted. 
And the study shows couples, who blame too much of it on work, are 
wrong. Well, exactly. Society tells us, that dual-earner couples are 
just to busy to have time for each other. Tell that to the zachariahs. 
We've been fortunate, in that, we've always kept the relationship 
in focus and kept nurturing it, kept working on it. I think the biggest 
thing that I find with our marriage, and why it's been successful, 
is that we both respect each others' jobs. Just as they also respect 
one another. Dan Rutz, CNN.
