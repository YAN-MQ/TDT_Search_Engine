Religious authorities in a largely Muslim region in southern Russia 
have reinstated an ancient practice that requires men to pay a woman's 
parents for the right to marry her, a news report said Monday. The 
bride-price has been set at 2,000 rubles (about 100 dollars), the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported _ a significant amount in the impoverished, 
restive region of Ingushetia. The money must be handed over on the 
wedding day, and later the husband must also provide two sets of bed 
linen and two sets of clothing _ summer and winter _ for his wife. 
Violators will be punished by being shunned by other residents in 
their town or village, the report said. While the practice has not 
been codified as a law, few apparently dare to disobey it. Ingushetia 
has seen a steady increase in the number of bachelors because many 
men cannot afford to pay the 2,000 rubles, ITAR-Tass reported.
