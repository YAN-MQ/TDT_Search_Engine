The White House has given a guarded response to the landslide election 
victory Populist Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. Spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said he hopes Mr. Chavez will respect the country's constitution. 
Mr. Chavez is barred from entering the U.S. because of his role in 
1992's failed military coup. But officials are now saying he could 
be granted a visa by the time he takes office next February. Mr. Chavez

the lucrative oil trade.
