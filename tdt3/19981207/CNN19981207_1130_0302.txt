President Clinton wants to ensure not one dime of Medicare money is 
spent wastefully. He'll unveil a package of legislative initiatives 
today to help the government save $2 billion in health payments. Mr. 
Clinton's plan would crack down on Medicare fraud and abuse. Details 
include eliminating markups in the prices Medicare pays for drugs, 
preventing providers from billing Medicare for services not provided 
and requiring private insurers to notify Medicare when they cover 
a claim.
