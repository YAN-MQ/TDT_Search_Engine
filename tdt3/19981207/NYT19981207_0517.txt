The New York Yankees made an initial trade offer for pitcher Roger 
Clemens Monday, but an American League official said the Yankee bid 
is not among the two offers the Toronto Blue Jays are weighing seriously. 
In the end, though, Clemens will dictate where he is traded because 
of provisions in his contract. Owner George Steinbrenner met with 
team officials Monday in Tampa, Fla., to assess how seriously his 
club will pursue Clemens. Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, 
said Monday evening that he had spoken with Gord Ash, the general 
manager for Toronto; Cashman would not describe the substance of their 
conversation, or whether he had extended an offer. A league official 
said the Yankees made an initial offer _ perhaps involving second 
baseman Homer Bush and others. ``It won't be enough to get anything 
done,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``There 
are other deals out there.'' The Yankees' offer may have been only 
a first step to open negotiations and to buy them more time to examine 
the parameters of a possible deal. The Yankees, like other teams, 
are apparently concerned by what one American League executive called 
``the double whammy'': To acquire Clemens, a team would have to surrender 
two or three quality players, and then renegotiate a new contract 
with the five-time Cy Young award winner and pay him like a free agent. 
Clemens, 36, took advantage of an oral agreement with the Blue Jays' 
ownership and demanded that Toronto deal him. Incredibly, Clemens 
also has a strict no-trade clause, meaning that he can force the Blue 
Jays to swap him and then control his destination _ and, with only 
1999 and 2000 remaining on his current deal, Clemens presumably won't 
accept a trade unless his new team is willing to give him a more lucrative 
and longer contract. The Anaheim Angels and the San Diego Padres are 
among those teams interested in Clemens, but some baseball executives 
have been told that Clemens does not want to play for a West Coast 
team. Clemens' preference would be to play close to his Texas home, 
and naturally the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers are considered 
front-runners for his services. The Yankees, the Mets and Cleveland 
are also interested, but the Astros, Indians and Yankees and other 
teams are balking at the idea of trading players for Clemens, and 
then paying him as if he were a free agent. Ash said Monday that he 
has reduced the number of potential suitors from 12 to 14 teams down 
to six serious suitors, with a couple of clubs viewed as long shots. 
Toronto's leverage may have been reduced by the fact that money that 
was going to be paid to Clemens in the form of a bonus is being added 
to his salary the next two seasons. Clemens was in line to make $5 
million for next season, a modest price for a 20-game winner. But 
with the bonus money added, Clemens' salary for 1999 will be $8 million, 
and has increased from $6.35 million to $8.1 million in 2000. Executives 
around baseball expect that Clemens will want to be paid about $50 
million over four years. Kevin Brown, currently the best available 
free-agent pitcher, will most likely command a much greater contract. 
The Los Angeles Dodgers, Colorado Rockies and Baltimore Orioles all 
seem willing to give Brown the six-year deal he covets, and the St. 
Louis Cardinals, too, may be in the running. Baseball officials in 
both leagues believe that once Brown signs _ perhaps at the end of 
this week, when teams gather for the winter meetings in Nashville 
_ his annual salary will approach $14 million. With most teams having 
engaged in major moves already, there are not expected to be many 
trades at the meetings. Among the deals being discussed: the Braves 
have talked to Tampa Bay about the slugger Ryan Klesko, Arizona is 
talking to Pittsburgh about trading pitcher Brian Anderson for outfielder 
Jose Guillen, and several teams have asked the Padres about the availability 
of outfielder Greg Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs in 1998.
