NasA chose the Celtic song "Jerry the rigger" AS today's wake-up call 
for astronauts orbiting the earth in the space shuttle "endeavour." 
The crew was sleeping off yesterday's work, locking together the first 
two pieces of the international space station. Later today, astronauts 
Jerry Ross and Jim Newman will perform a complicated spacewalk, linking 
power cables between the modules. About 75 spacewalks are planned 
during the station's five-year construction.
