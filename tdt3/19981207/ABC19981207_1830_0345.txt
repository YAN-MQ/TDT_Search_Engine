President Clinton may yet have to do something dramatic as he tries 
to avoid impeachment. But not today. Today, it was a plan to save 
$2 billion in Medicare, he said. Crack down on fraud for one thing. 
ABC's John Martin, who monitors how your money is spent by the federal 
government, finds that getting the price down for drugs bought by 
Medicare would make a difference. Here's what the president is talking 
about -- Medicare pays $1 billion more than necessary for prescription 
drugs. Just look at cancer drugs. For this prostate and breast cancer 
drug, the veterans administration pays $299.38 per dose, but Medicare 
pays $513.60, more than $200 more. For the breast cancer drug, used 
for other treatments, as well, the VA pays $109.36, but Medicare pays 
$173.50, more than $60 more. For this chemotherapy drug, the VA pays 
1.18 per dose, Medicare pays $20.45, nearly 20 times more. The veterans 
administration pays less because it has negotiated cheaper prices 
with the drug companies for large purchases. But Medicare pays more 
because it reimburses doctors who dispense drugs in their offices 
at nearly the full sticker price set by the drug companies, even though 
the doctors buy at big discounts. Connecticut cancer doctor Arthur 
Rosenberg says the extra money covers his costs for administering 
the drugs in his office instead of sending patients to the hospital. 
I don't think oncologists are going to want to treat patients in their 
office. It will be there's no incentive for them to do so. They get 
paid a fee by Medicare for administering the drugs. Why should they 
want to tack on an extra profit? That's just more than the physicians 
are entitled to, thank you very much. But this may be more than a 
disagreement about discounts. It may involve price fixing. Federal 
agents are now investigating the drug companies99 companies. This 
involves hundreds of millions of dollars. "It's your money." John 
Martin, ABC News, Washington.
