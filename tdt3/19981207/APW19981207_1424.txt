Center fielder Steve Finley became the sixth free agent to sign with 
the Arizona Diamondbacks in the last month, agreeing Monday to a dlrs 
20 million, four-year contract. Diamondbacks' managing general partner 
Jerry Colangelo confirmed the deal had been completed and the team 
scheduled a news conference to introduce Finley. Arizona's deal far 
exceeded the three-year, dlrs 12 million offer Finley had to remain 
with the San Diego Padres. Finley said last week that his signing 
with the Diamondbacks was a foregone conclusion. ``Arizona wanted 
me over there real bad,'' he said. ``I think San Diego wanted me here, 
but they wanted me under their terms. It was unfortunate that it's 
the way it happened, but the game's a business.'' Colangelo has spent 
dlrs 117.4 million in recent weeks in an attempt to turn the Diamondbacks 
into a contender in a hurry. Most of the money went for pitching. 
Randy Johnson agreed to a dlrs 52.4 million, four-year deal, Todd 
Stottlemyre agreed to dlrs 32 million for year years, Armando Reynoso 
got dlrs 5.5 million for two years and reliever Greg Swindell received 
dlrs 5.7 million over three years. Arizona also picked up pinch-hit 
specialist Greg Colbrunn for dlrs 1.8 million over two years. Center 
field was a top priority because Devon White, Arizona's MVP last season, 
agreed to a dlrs 12 million, three-year contract with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. That left the crucial defensive spot to Dante Powell, a young, 
light-hitting player with little major league experience. Powell was 
obtained in a trade that sent reliever Alan Embree to San Francisco. 
Finley hit a career-low .249 this year with 14 homers and 67 RBIs, 
two years after setting career highs in batting average (.297), doubles 
(45), home runs (30) and RBIs (95) and winning his second straight 
Gold Glove.
