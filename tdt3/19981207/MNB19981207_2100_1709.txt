When we come back here, two members of the house who ultimately will 
be called on to decide, at least a part of this matter, of impeaching 
the president. Before we discuss goings on in Washington with two 
members of the house, this is Monday night, time for our first of 
the week look at the big three weekly news magazines, beginning with 
our look at the covers. They are "U.S. news," a story on love in the 
office. Behind the watercooler, sometimes in front. "Time" magazine 
a neck-snapping change of subject. Who was Moses anyway? And another 
neck-snapping change of subject, that is Nicole Kidman, the story 
is about how she is wearing absolutely nothing at times in her new 
broadway show by way of London, and their marriage and privacy and 
things like that inside "U.S. news," a passing we should 77 here before 
too many days go by. That is Roy benevides. He was with special army 
pours forces. In 1968, his actions earned him the medal of honor. 
He saved eight lives. Eight fellow fighters, exrads. In doing so he 
suffered 30-plus bullet and bayonet wounds. He was Roundy and fondly 
remembered when he died last week at the age of 63. He had just visited 
a school to try to tell his story, as he did just about every day. 
Inside "U.S. news," it's hard to see it as a threat, I must say. Inside 
"U.S. news." This is inside the tent reporting. Tonight is the annual 
congressional ball for all members of the house and senate. Inside 
"time" The question is impeachment. The speaker, Henry Hyde. It's 
for the product Ally-toids. You don't normally see them quite this 
good. That is our look at the news weeklies this Monday night. When 
we come back, NASA's latest mission. What is it been fitting in the
