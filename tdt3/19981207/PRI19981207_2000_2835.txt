Speaking of attacks, this final news note from 1998. Earlier this 
year, two Swedish men, one age 92 and the other a sprightly 80, fell 
in love with the same woman at a rest home in Gautenberg. Well, in 
due course, tempers flared and eventually, sword play ensued. Don't 
worry. Both men survived the fracas, and as for the woman herself, 
a youthful 82, she spurned them both. "They are ridiculous boys," 
she told police, "And I want no more to do with them."
