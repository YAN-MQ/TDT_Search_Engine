It was not so very long ago _ before women routinely entered the work 
force _ that college was sometimes billed as a place where they went 
to earn their ``M.R.S.'' Ancient history. Today, the very thought 
that anyone should talk about college as preparation for marriage 
appalls many students. So when some Barnard College students discovered 
recently that one of the college's brochures boasted that graduates 
of women's colleges were more likely to marry and have children than 
women graduating from co-ed colleges, they took offense. The complaints 
that followed have led the college's administration to agree to revise 
the brochure, which is sent to parents of prospective applicants. 
In addition to those who saw the brochure as stereotypical, some students 
saw the statement as a sign that the college did not value lesbians 
as much as other students. ``It was a slap in the face,'' said Sandra 
Chefitz, a Barnard senior and religion major from Chicago. ``It suggested 
that Barnard is not any more proud of its gay students than the University 
of Alabama.'' Shannon Herbert, an English major from Buffalo and president 
of Lesbians and Bisexuals in Action at Barnard, said she was not surprised 
to find Barnard trying to convince parents that the college was safe 
for their daughters. ``Marriage in our culture is seen as the pinnacle,'' 
she said. ``There is a stigma attached to women's colleges, a stereotype 
that they produce unshaven, unmanageable, unruly women, or women who 
become lesbians.'' Ms. Herbert said she had put up posters to alert 
other students about the brochure and discussed the matter with the 
dean of admissions. She and Ms. Chefitz then began circulating a petition 
demanding that future brochures delete the line, which she said reflected 
an ``unfounded fear that attending an all-women's college will inevitably 
result in lesbianism or spinsterhood.'' As a protest gained momentum, 
the admissions dean met again with students. The following morning 
_ last Thursday _ college officials agreed to revise the brochure. 
``Quite frankly, what the brochure was addressing was that with women's 
colleges, if it's not one stereotype, it's another,'' said Judith 
Shapiro, Barnard's president. ``The real message we want to send is 
that women can have it all. They can have satisfying work lives and 
satisfying personal lives, and their satisfying personal lives can 
come in many different varieties.'' Barnard officials said the brochure 
was put together eight or nine years ago and relied on figures from 
the Women's College Coalition, which is based in Washington.
