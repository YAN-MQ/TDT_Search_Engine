Now on Sunday, quarterback John Elway pulled off another comeback 
win as the Superbowl champion Denver Broncos extended their unbeaten 
record to 13 and 0. Elway drove the Broncos to a pair of touchdowns 
in the final seven minutes to beat the Kansas City Chiefs 35 to 31. 
With the victory, the Broncos clinched the home field advantage throughout 
the playoffs. Denver Coach Mike Shanahan said he liked the way his 
team played. Kansas City played a great, you know, did a great job. 
They were well prepared. They came out and played for 60 minutes. 
I was really proud of our football team, the way we fought back. We 
didn't take advantage of some opportunities, but I thought it showed 
the character of our football team the way we hung in there. We fought 
for 60 minutes and found a way to win.
