American telecom giant AT&T is under investigation over a planned 
alliance with British Telecom. The European Commission in Brussels 
will scrutinize the joint venture after warnings they could be creating 
a monopoly. Jonathan Beal reports. The European Commission has already 
carried out a preliminary investigation into the planned alliance 
between BT and AT&T. The two companies plan on combining resources 
to compete more successfully in the international calls market. But 
other telecoms operators fear that could lead to a monopoly in certain 
sectors, most notably, in attracting the customer of large multinational 
companies. The European Commission has four months to investigate 
and then decide whether the joint venture should go ahead. But as 
is already indicated that at present, there is not enough evidence 
of unfair competition to stop the venture. Jonathan Beal in Brussels.
