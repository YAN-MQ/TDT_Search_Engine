Movie director Mel Brooks once quipped, "Humor is just another defense 
against a universe." If that's the case, then 1998 should give you 
plenty of ammunition. As the year draws to a close, here's a few choice 
items from our ongoing look at the, well, the nuttier side of 1998. 
Ever feel like holing up somewhere to get away from all the bad news 
these days? You're not alone. A performance artist in the British 
town of Brighton locked himself in a box for a whole week all in the 
name of art. The artist, known simply Leon, offered this explanation. 
This is a piece of work that deals with manipulation of the individual 
by external stimuli. And this is - Whether it's art, whether it's 
an experiment, I don't know, but if you take away all the external 
stimuli from an individual, who do they become? Well, they become 
a gibbering wreck or at least Leon did. After a week in close quarters, 
he began screaming and demanding to bet let out. The breaking point 
seems to have been two mischievous six-year olds who happened on the 
public installation and spent some quality play time banging on Leon's 
crate with sticks.
