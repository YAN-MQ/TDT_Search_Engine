White House lawyers are calling 14 expert witnesses in their defense 
of President Clinton. Three of those named are members of the House 
Judiciary Committee that voted to impeach President Nixon a quarter 
of a century ago. They include former Massachusetts Congressman Reverend 
Robert Drinan. Mr. Clinton's lawyers have been given 30 hours to make 
their case in front of the House Judiciary Committee tomorrow and 
Wednesday. The committee is expected to vote for impeachment by the 
weekend.
