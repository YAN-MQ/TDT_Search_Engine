President Clinton's lawyers will call 14 witnesses to support their 
argument that impeachment is too severe a penalty for Mr. Clinton 
for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. This is White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart: ... president's counsels' presentation, we will look at 
both the constitutional standards and the allegations and the facts 
and the law in that context. Mr. Clinton's lawyers will present their 
case Tuesday and Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee. Committee 
Chairman Henry Hyde accuses the White House of avoiding the facts 
to attack the impeachment process. Mr. Clinton faces allegations of 
perjury and obstruction of justice in an effort to conceal his affair 
with Ms. Lewinsky.
