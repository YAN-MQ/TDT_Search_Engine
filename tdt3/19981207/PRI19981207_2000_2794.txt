Speaking of stimulation, one of the year's top stories was a release 
of Viagra, the wonder drug designed to cure impotence. As demand for 
the drug skyrocketed, one French restaurateur went so far as to spice 
up his sauces with the stuff. Jean Louis Gayon was unamused when the 
police raided his kitchen. They seized my supply of Viagra and served 
me with a confiscation order. They put seals on my doors. They gave 
me a copy of the confiscation order instead of the public prosecutor 
when registered the case within 24 hours. I don't feel like a criminal. 
I've had customers asking me for Viagra and ordering the Viagra menu. 
They think the whole thing is terrible and an attack on personal freedom.
