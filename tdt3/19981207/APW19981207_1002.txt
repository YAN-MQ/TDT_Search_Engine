Angolan government jets bombarded the central highland strongholds 
of the rebel group UNITA on Monday, for the fourth consecutive day, 
while infantry units supported by tanks advanced by road, a UNITA 
spokesman said. UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said at 
least 10 people were killed and about 50 were injured in the attacks 
which appeared to end the southwest African country's fragile four-year 
peace process. The government has refused to say whether it is attacking 
the rebel bases. However, the Defense Ministry will not let reporters 
into the area because it says it is an ``operational zone.'' U.N. 
staff last week reported hearing bomb explosions in the area. Gato 
said MiG jets launched two strikes early Monday on Andulo and Bailundo, 
rural towns about 290 kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Luanda where 
the UNITA leadership lives. UNITA troops supported by local militias 
had repelled a government attack by road on Andulo while fighting 
around Bailundo, 150 kilometers (90 miles) to the west, was deadlocked, 
according to Gato. Gato, speaking by satellite telephone, said he 
was in Bailundo, though it was not possible to confirm that. The government 
and UNITA have engaged in skirmishes in rural areas of this vast country 
in recent months, although both sides refuse to admit responsibility 
for ending the peace accord. Gato said UNITA still wanted to find 
a peaceful solution to the conflict but accused President Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos, who leads the governing MPLA Party, of wanting to crush 
the group. ``The peace agreement has effectively been buried by Dos 
Santos. He has implicitly ended it,'' Gato said. ``But we'll keep 
fighting back. There'll be no winner,'' he said. The 1994 U.N.-brokered 
peace pact, which ended a two-decade civil war between the foes, has 
not advanced since June. The government accuses UNITA _ a Portuguese 
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
_ of keeping a 30,000-strong guerilla army hidden in the jungle. UNITA 
has refused to relinquish control of its two last strongholds, claiming 
that the government has committed human rights abuses in areas already 
handed over. A 1991 peace agreement collapsed the following year after 
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi rejected his defeat in the country's first 
democratic elections which were won by Dos Santos and his Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA.
