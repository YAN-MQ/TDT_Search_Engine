Jewel is quickly becoming a one woman entertainment industry. Mark 
Scheerer looks at her work in music, movies, and books. I will get 
down on my knees and I will pray Positive change, making a difference, 
human compassion -- some of the themes running through "hands," jewel's 
new single, and her album, "Spirit," and her life. One person does 
make a difference. That's not a hard concept. I mean, you know, people's 
lives are changed by common kindness, as well as my one life has affected 
millions. Millions have been moved by 24-year-old jewel kilcher, at 
least moved enough to buy over 8 million copies of her first album. 
Proceeds from her book of poetry published earlier this year and money 
from her virtually nonstop touring are now going toward her new charitable 
organization called higher ground for humanity. It wasn't long ago, 
after all, that she was living hand to mouth. One of my goals when 
I was living in my car -- I think one of my main goals, was that I 
was excruciatingly aware at a young age that people went without things 
that they shouldn't have to go without, that I was denied medical 
aid, that I was dependent on people every night for food and that 
I wasn't unique at all. And I was better off than a lot of people. 
And it influenced a lot of those first songs I wrote, like "who will 
save your soul?" Who will save your soul Jewel is managed by her mother, 
nedra Carroll, who joined her at wNBC's Christmas tree lighting ceremony. 
I wonder as I wander Mother and daughter have just been sued for $10 
million by jewel's former manager, claiming breach of contract. You 
know, I haven't actually seen this yet. And so, I've had a few people 
talk to me about it, but I can't really comment on it. Jewel has put 
these hands and feet and face to work on the set of "Ride with the 
Devil," the next film by the director of "the ice storm," ang Lee. 
I've always wanted to get into acting, and I finally got done with 
touring and was able to do it. And, you know, thank my lucky stars 
that ang and a really brilliant script happened to come along. Performing 
at an AIDS residence is another way jewel puts her spirituality to 
work in the service of compassion. To me, being spiritual isn't hard. 
You don't have to do anything. You don't have to meditate. You don't 
have to lick your finger and hold it in the air and hope to be struck 
by spirituality, like lightning. In the end only kindness matters
