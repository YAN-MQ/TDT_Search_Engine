Bedouins on Monday kidnapped four German tourists, three of them women, 
according to tribal leaders and German diplomats. Three gunman of 
the Bani Dhabyan tribe forced the tourists into their truck on the 
main road between San`a and the Dhamar province, about 100 kilometers 
(62 miles) south of the capital, the tribesmen and diplomats said. 
The tourists were taken to Serwah, in the province of Marib, 170 kilometers 
(105 miles) northeast of the capital, they said, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. Yemen authorities have asked members of another tribe 
to negotiate the release of the tourists. The demands of the Bedouin 
kidnappers were not immediately known. The Germans apparently were 
on their way back to San`a after a trip through central Yemen when 
they were kidnapped. The Bani Dhabyan tribe has carried out numerous 
kidnappings, including the seizure in April of a British teacher, 
David Mitchell, his wife and their 14-year old son. The tribe roams 
areas around San`a and Marib. Armed tribesmen, who control large parts 
of Yemen, frequently kidnap foreigners to try to win concessions from 
the government in exchange for their release. The hostages are usually 
well treated and released unharmed.
