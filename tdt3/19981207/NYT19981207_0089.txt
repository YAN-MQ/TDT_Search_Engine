Everyone has heard about the LSD-soaked stickers given away to schoolchildren. 
The stamp-size tabs are reportedly decorated with blue stars or pictures 
of Superman, butterflies or clowns. Or how about the story of the 
child who is dying of cancer and wants postcards sent to him? Or how 
about Neiman Marcus' $250 cookie recipe? They are all urban myths, 
of course, stories that refuse to die no matter how many times they 
are roundly debunked. Science is different, right? Study results become 
part of the annals, authenticated by weighty papers and validated 
by panels of experts. This is the usual route to credibility. Then 
there are the myths. Take the ``Hawthorne effect,'' which is much 
embraced in social psychology. It refers to a study from 1927 to 1933 
of factory workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne Plant in Illinois. 
It showed that regardless of the changes made in working conditions 
_ more breaks, longer breaks or fewer and shorter ones _ productivity 
increased. These changes apparently had nothing to do with the workers' 
responses. The workers, or so the story goes, produced more because 
they saw themselves as special, participants in an experiment, and 
their inter-relationships improved. Sounds very compelling. ``The 
results of this experiment, or rather the human relations interpretation 
offered by the researchers who summarized the results, soon became 
gospel for introductory textbooks in both psychology and management 
science,'' said Dr. Lee Ross, a psychology professor at Stanford University. 
But only five workers took part in the study, Ross said, and two were 
replaced partway through for gross insubordination and low output. 
A psychology professor at the University of Michigan, Dr. Richard 
Nisbett called the Hawthorne effect ``a glorified anecdote.'' ``Once 
you've got the anecdote,'' he said, ``you can throw away the data.'' 
Myths happen in medicine, too. Dr. Robert Buckman, a cancer specialist 
at the University of Toronto, discovered an urban legend when he tracked 
the story of a spectacular cancer treatment to its source. Buckman 
first heard the story on June 25, 1990, in Toronto in a lecture given 
by Dr. Bernard Siegel, a doctor who has written popular books on the 
power of the mind over cancer. Siegel told of two oncologists chatting 
about a study they were participating in to test a combination of 
four chemotherapy drugs, which had the initials EPHO. One doctor's 
patients were doing spectacularly well; three quarters of them were 
responding to the drugs. But only a quarter of the other doctor's 
patients were improving. Then the first doctor explained that he had 
simply rearranged the letters of the drugs so they spelled HOPE. Siegel's 
audience was overwhelmed. ``If hope did that, then it was the most 
powerful anti-cancer agent the world had ever known,'' Buckman said. 
Still, he was skeptical. He knew by the initials of the drugs that 
the treatment must be for small-cell lung cancer, which is very difficult 
to treat. Why had he not heard of the study before? Buckman asked 
Siegel for his source, which turned out to be a book by Norman Cousins, 
who had referred to an article published in a 1988 Western Journal 
of Medicine. Buckman telephoned the writer, a cancer specialist in 
La Jolla, Calif. The doctor told Buckman that he had invented the 
story. It was a parable meant to tell doctors that there was more 
to treating cancer than merely doling out drugs, he said. Are scientists 
as credulous as the parents who worried about the LSD stickers? Perhaps 
urban legends take hold, Ross said, because ``sometimes a story deserves 
to be true.'' Scientists may be no different from lay people when 
it comes a message that strikes a chord in them. The Hawthorne effect 
had an enormous appeal for many social psychologists, Ross said. ``The 
study became a symbol initially for arguing that change itself is 
good or that anything you do produces positive effects,'' he said. 
Then it was interpreted to mean that people who take part in experiments 
behave differently simply because they are taking part in an experiment, 
he added. That, too, appealed to many researchers. ``A lot of us kind 
of believe that subjective factors matter a lot in medicine,'' Ross 
said. ``We want there to be demonstrations that make that point. And 
so we may ignore flaws and deficiencies in a study if it is saying 
something we believe to be important.'' Then, if some naysayer takes 
note of the paucity or absence of data, Ross said, ``it's like seeing 
a magician's trick and then having the magician tell how he did it.''
