A Polish court on Monday sentenced four nationalist skinheads to prison 
terms ranging from two to 25 years for attacks that killed three people 
and injured another. The skinheads, all aged 20, were members of a 
small extreme nationalist party called The Polish National Front. 
Two of them, identified only as Arkadiusz J. and Grzegorz S., were 
convicted of murdering a homeless man in August 1995. They received 
25-year prison terms, the longest available for under-age defendants. 
Both were 17 at the time of the crime. A third man, identified as 
Arkadiusz L., got a 15-year term for beating up a man who later died 
of his injuries. Another defendant, Robert W., received a two-year 
suspended sentence for taking part in an attack on a Zimbabwean in 
Poland. According to evidence at the trial, the group targeted homeless 
and drunken men because their party encouraged them to rid the country 
of ``unworthy'' people. All attacks took place in the town of Legionowo, 
some 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Warsaw. Judge Piotr Janiszewski 
said the aggression was ``their own choice, a tragic, false and bad 
choice for which they have to account.'' Poland has relatively few 
ethnic and racial minorities compared to other European countries, 
with more than 90 percent of the population being white Roman Catholics. 
Since the end of decades of communist rule in 1989, violence involving 
nationalist groups has increased as Poland has undergone economic 
transformation that brought high unemployment and other hardships 
to people used to guaranteed jobs of the state-controlled socialist 
system.
