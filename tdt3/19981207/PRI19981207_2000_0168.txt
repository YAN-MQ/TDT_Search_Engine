The ongoing power struggle in Iran between Reformers and Conservatives 
has taken another twist. The daughter of former President Rafsanjani 
has appeared in court charged with publishing false information in 
a liberal newspaper she edits. She was acquitted of the main charge 
but was found guilty of a lesser one. Jim Meir reports. The struggle 
within Iran's Reformists and hard line Conservatives is now breaking 
surface partly in the country's press and partly in the streets and 
on the university campuses. Both of those elements came together in 
the Tehran press court when Pfeiser Rafsanjani appeared to defend 
her newspaper, "Zahn" against charges that it falsely accused a police 
intelligence official of personally taking part in an assault on two 
pro Khatami government figures in a case which is seen very much as 
part of an attempt by the hard-line camp to hit back at the progressive 
supporters of President Mohammad Khatami. Jim Meir reporting.
