The 50th birthday of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights comes 
none too soon _ because the world needs to be reminded that the much-ignored 
document exists, the U.N. human rights commissioner says. ``We really 
need a celebration,'' Mary Robinson said in an interview Monday, before 
joining President Jacques Chirac to kick off a weeklong commemoration 
in the French capital. ``We need to renew the vision.'' Robinson, 
the former president of Ireland who has been U.N. High Commissioner 
of Human Rights for a year, said she was struck by surveys saying 
only seven percent of the world knows about the Declaration, created 
in the aftermath of Nazi genocide. ``If people know their rights, 
and know that they belong to them _ not to states _ it helps them 
to assert and to claim those rights,'' she said. But in fact, Robinson 
said, more people in the world are aware of the hazards to the environment 
than the hazards to human rights. ``In terms of awareness, we're about 
15 years behind the environmental lobby,'' she said. Fifty years after 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was inaugurated on Dec. 
10, 1948, atrocities persist, in places like Rwanda and Bosnia, to 
name just a few. The first priority is to address those gross violations, 
Robinson said. The world needs to learn how to address human rights 
violations by non-state actors _ paramilitary groups and extremists 
_ as well those by states, she said. Just as important is to focus 
on new areas, such as the influential role of international corporations, 
she said. ``Those corporations have immense power,'' she said. ``We 
need to show them that human rights is in the business interest of 
business.'' And then there is poverty _ ``such a terrible violation 
of so many human rights,'' Robinson said. ``One of the strengths of 
the declaration is that it recognizes economic rights, too.'' The 
weeklong celebration in Paris will draw U.N. Secretary- General Kofi 
Annan, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the Dalai Lama, 
Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng, and a host of other dissidents, celebrities, 
even rock stars. Chirac said Monday in a speech Monday that the celebrations 
were intended ``to wake up consciences, map out new paths'' in the 
struggle for human rights. There will be receptions, demonstrations 
and a concert starring Alanis Morissette, Peter Gabriel and Tracy 
Chapman, among others. There already has been one controversy: newspapers 
reported last week that Chirac had not included the Dalai Lama on 
the guest list for a luncheon Tuesday honoring Nobel laureates, suggesting 
China had pressured Chirac. The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader confirmed 
Monday that he had been invited and will attend.
