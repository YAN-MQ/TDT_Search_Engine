The Packers can Clinch a playoff berth with a win tonight over the 
Buccaneers. Tampa bay has struggled this year after making the playoffs 
last year for the first time since '82. A win today can tie the Bucs 
with the Cardinals and saints in the race for the final NFC wild card 
berth. Green bay's got some great fans. They travel with them. And 
our task is to make sure we play well at the beginning of the game, 
get our crowd into it, and I think we'll be fine.
