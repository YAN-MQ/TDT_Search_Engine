Police have detained 103 Romanians in what they contend may be the 
largest single roundup of suspected illegal immigrants in Britain. 
The Romanians were arrested Thursday at Dartford International Ferry 
Terminal, east of London, where they arrived after traveling by ferry 
from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, police said. Inspector Dave Berry 
said officers spent more than two hours locating the people and transporting 
them to four police stations. Those detained include children, police 
said. ``This is certainly the largest number that I've heard of,'' 
Berry said. ''We sometimes see about 15 at a time, I've never seen 
this number before.'' Immigration officials planned to interview the 
Romanians on Friday.
