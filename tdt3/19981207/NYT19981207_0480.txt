In what Vinny Testaverde described Monday as ``a magical season,'' 
one highlighted by his sleight-of-hand, referee-aided touchdown in 
the final moments of Sunday's game, the Jets found themselves needing 
only one more victory to guarantee their first playoff spot in seven 
years. But even more than locking up a wild-card slot in the playoffs, 
a victory over the Dolphins in Miami on Sunday night would also position 
the Jets favorably to capture their first division title since 1969, 
ending a dry spell longer than any other team's in the National Football 
League. If the Jets can beat Miami, they would need only one victory 
in their final two games _ either over the Buffalo Bills on the road, 
or at the Meadowlands against the New England Patriots _ to finish 
first. In any event, even only one victory against this final threesome 
would propel the Jets into the playoffs. How the Jets got to this 
position _ and they haven't had a chance to vie for first place this 
late since 1986 _ continues to be a subject of controversy. There 
was no question Monday, based on television replays, newspaper photos 
and comments from NFL officials, that Testaverde did not get the ball 
over the goal line on a fourth-down, do-or-die quarterback sneak from 
the Seattle Seahawks' 5-yard line with only 20 seconds to go. But 
the game officials ruled that he did, and as a result it became the 
dramatic winning touchdown in a 32-31 victory over the Seahawks that 
left the Jets at 9-4 on the season and tied for first with Miami in 
the contentious American Football Conference East. Testaverde himself 
said Monday that after the game, on the ride back to his parents' 
home on Long Island, he replayed in his mind what happened. He was 
trying to figure out what the head linesman Earnie Frantz had seen 
that led him to signal, without hesitation, a touchdown. Testaverde's 
conclusion: ``I had been bobbling the ball. ... Since I didn't have 
possession when I went down, I was able to recover it and got it over 
the goal line.'' And Coach Bill Parcells' opinion of all this? Monday, 
he asserted that he still hadn't seen the replay. ``I don't watch 
TV very often,'' he said. ``I read books when I'm home.'' Parcells 
conceded he did, however, view the Jets' tapes of the game, shot from 
the end zone and the sidelines. These are filmed for the benefit of 
the coaching staff and players and are different from the television 
tapes. ``You couldn't tell from our tapes,'' Parcells said. Then, 
his voice rising as he considered what some people believe to be a 
gift victory, he added: ``I've been on the other side of it, too. 
I'm not saying anything about it _ last year we voted for replay. 
There'll be another outcry for it now, and there already is.'' Parcells, 
who never formally complains to the league about officiating, added: 
``They're not taking the game away from us. They're not giving us 
the game back in Detroit last year.'' The Jets lost that season's 
finale when a victory would have pushed them into the playoffs. On 
an obviously wrong call in that game, the officials ruled that Bryant 
Westbrook had intercepted a Leon Johnson halfback-option pass in the 
end zone. Replays showed Westbrook was still juggling the ball as 
he stepped out of bounds and that the interception should not have 
counted. If Sunday's event was payback without replay, it still leaves 
Parcells with some concerns. He said he didn't know just how seriously 
injured his starting left cornerback, Aaron Glenn, was with a sprained 
ankle, or how bad defensive end Anthony Pleasant's hip strain was. 
Fullback Keith Byars also suffered a broken arm in the game. The Jets 
have been remarkably injury free this year _ three starters had missed 
a total of seven games _ but now, in only one game, three first-stringers 
had potentially serious injuries. Parcells said he would not disclose 
the availability of the three players until Wednesday. Parcells also 
said that he was concerned about the Jets' ability to hold up to the 
mental challenge of a stretch run in which the Jets will play three 
straight tough division games. ``One of the things you worry about 
right now is the energy to sustain, because they haven't been in games 
like this before,'' Parcells said. ``I told them after Sunday's game, 
`Hey, fellas, this is what it's going to be like.''' Only one current 
player, Mo Lewis, has ever been to the playoffs as a Jet, and that 
was in his rookie season of 1991. Parcells has, however, brought in 
players with significant playoff experience, such as Curtis Martin, 
Pepper Johnson, Byars and Bryan Cox. Parcells recalled that after 
Sunday's game, Johnson told him, ``We needed a game like this.'' ``I 
knew what he meant,'' said the coach. ``He didn't mean the comeback. 
He meant the chaos, the high pressure on every play, where every call 
can win or lose a game.'' There will also be a taxing physical component 
to these last three games. The Jets will arrive back home next Monday 
at 4 a.m. after their game in Miami. But they will be leaving four 
days later for a Saturday afternoon game against the Bills. They will, 
though, get an extra day of rest for their regular-season finale against 
the Patriots. There is uncertainty as to what will happen to the defensive 
lineup if Glenn cannot play. Does Parcells take Ray Mickens out of 
the nickel package, where he is performing at a high level, and make 
him a starter? And what kind of replacement would Jerald Sowell be 
for Byars, who has the fourth-highest number of receptions on the 
Jets (26) along with three touchdowns? And if Pleasant cannot play, 
would the Jets go to a 3-4 defense? ``Everybody,'' cornerback Otis 
Smith said, ``has to be on the top of his game right now. If you lose, 
you might not win the division.''
