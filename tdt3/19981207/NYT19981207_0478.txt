A group of elite professional players and super-agents gathered in 
an opulent Manhattan meeting room Monday to discuss the object of 
their announced relief effort: the needy and disadvantaged. But their 
remarks had less to do with Unicef than their own plight. The stars 
and agents continued a pattern of public missteps by discussing the 
desperate state of some National Basketball Association players who 
have become financially strapped during the five-month lockout. Blurring 
the definition of needy, the agents David Falk and Arn Tellem announced 
that a group of Olympic Dream Team members _ with the notable exception 
of Michael Jordan _ will ask fans to pay $1,000 for courtside seats 
when they converge on Atlantic City Dec. 19 for a game to benefit 
two charities: Unicef and cash-poor NBA players. Although the game's 
participants, like Patrick Ewing, will not be paid for their appearance, 
part of the net proceeds will be set aside in a trust fund for NBA 
players in need. Not only is the fund aimed at those making the minimum 
$275,000, but financial support could also go to players who have 
made millions but have failed to save their fortunes. ``If you look 
at the majority of people playing professional sports, after they 
finish playing, there are not a lot of them financially secure,'' 
Ewing, the union's president, said. ``They make a lot of money, but 
they also spend a lot of money.'' Fans may not be sympathetic, but 
players argue that there is more to their expenses than fancy cars. 
As Karl Malone put it, ``I have 26 nieces and nephews, and Uncle Karl 
is Santa Claus all the time, whether there is a lockout or not; and 
that's just the reality of it.'' Glen Rice said, ``People make bad 
judgments, bad investments and things like that. And you have guys 
who are young who make bad decisions.'' A panel of union members and 
executives is expected to be established to review each hardship case. 
The reality is, some players did not prepare for a long lockout. Few 
believed that the labor dispute, which is centered on how owners and 
players should divide $2 billion in annual revenues, would last long 
enough to jeopardize the season. Perhaps within the next two weeks, 
the league could decide to cancel the season. With no new meetings 
scheduled, the situation appears bleak. If the game is a hit, that 
will mean a feather in the caps of Falk and Tellem. Both agents have 
talked about the potential of a new league if the season is canceled. 
To many, this game is a trial balloon to that end. ``If the opportunity 
presents itself for a new league, at some point, if the lockout continues 
and the season is ultimately canceled, that's going to have to be 
considered,'' Tellem said. ``At this point, the focus of this announcement 
is that this game is to help players who need help, and it's also 
to give basketball to the fans and to help charities such as Unicef.'' 
Organizers of the event expect to generate at least $1 million in 
proceeds, with a projected $100,000 to $200,000 going to Unicef and 
a remaining portion of the net proceeds going to the player fund. 
So far, 13 players are committed to play. A total of 16 players are 
expected to participate from the four Dream Teams: the 1992 and 1996 
Olympic teams and the 1994 and 1998 world championship teams. These 
players are expected: Ewing, Malone, Rice, Vin Baker, Tom Gugliotta, 
Anfernee Hardaway, Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston, Reggie Miller, Alonzo 
Mourning, Gary Payton, Mitch Richmond and Dominique Wilkins. The game 
will be played in the 17,000-seat convention center. Although ticket 
prices will range from $25 to $1,000 for courtside seats, there will 
be no view of Jordan on the court. Curtis Polk, who works with Jordan's 
agent, Falk, said Jordan declined to participate because he did not 
want to send ``a mixed message to fans.'' ``Michael feels that he 
needs to stand by his earlier statements that he's still deliberating 
on whether he wants to come back and play or not,'' Polk said. ``He 
wants to see a resolution of the lockout before he makes that decision.'' 
Jordan would have been the main draw for the charity event. As it 
is, fans will most likely see a dunk-fest played with lots of offense 
and little defense. Thus far, fans have shown little interest in organized 
exhibition games. A game in Miami on Friday drew just 2,000.
