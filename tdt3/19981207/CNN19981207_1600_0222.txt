Attorney general Janet Reno is deciding today whether to recommend 
another independent counsel investigation of President Clinton. The 
investigation would focus on so-called "issue ads" from the 1996 election, 
paid for by the democratic party, not the president's re-election 
campaign. By using those ads, the president may have violated campaign 
spending limits. Auditors for the federal election commission have 
concluded, both the president and republican candidate Bob Dole exceeded 
spending limits by using such ads. But top justice department officials 
have recommended against seeking an independent counsel.
