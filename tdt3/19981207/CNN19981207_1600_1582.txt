Here's something for those of you with a hankering for holiday candy. 
The world's largest candy cane can now be found in lansing, Michigan. 
A team of candymakers assembled the treat that measures just over 
36 feet long. The monster cane started as a huge vat of sugar, corn 
syrup and water, boiled to 300 degrees. Candy crafters had to work 
quickly to stretch and mold the mixture that was hardening by the 
second. Last year's longest cane was 16 feet long.
