Police fired from rooftops onto a crowd of 3,000 people today in the 
West Bank city of nabulus, injuring at least five people. Many were 
bystanders who had gathered to watch rioters protest Israel's refusal 
to release Palestinian prisoners. The police action is the first sign 
Palestinians are containing violence in advance of President Clinton's 
visit this week. In Gaza, authorities showed CIA officials a cache 
of confiscated weapons to show they are meeting the wye agreement's 
security commitments.
