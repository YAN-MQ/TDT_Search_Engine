u.s. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says Libya is, in her words, 
"taking much too long to decide whether to hand over for trial two 
suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing." I believe that it is time 
for the Libyans to understand the U.K.-U.S. offer. Not a negotiation. 
There is no negotiating this at all. Ms. Albright once again outlined 
nonnegotiable terms for the trial, that it be held by a Scottish court 
in The Hague under Scottish law. If found guilty, the suspects would 
serve their sentences in Scotland. Libya claims the suspects will 
not get a fair trial.
