Another blown call, but the jets will take. I'm Anthony Keith James, 
and this is "CNN Headline Sports." Word around the league is, the 
Vikings are a good team. Minnesota ended green bay's three-year reign 
as NFC central champs by clinching the division Sunday with a 48-22 
win over the bears. Randall Cunningham hooked up with Randy Moss for 
three TDs. Vikings are 12-1. The pack can still make the postseason 
by clinching a wildcard berth with a Win over the Bucs tonight in 
an NFC central matchup.
