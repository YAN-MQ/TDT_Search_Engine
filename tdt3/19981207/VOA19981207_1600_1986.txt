In Nigeria, results from Saturday's local government elections show 
the center-left People's Democratic Party, or PDP, with a strong lead 
over its two main rivals. With most of the returns counted from Nigeria's 
36 states, the PDP has won more than a third of the contested positions 
on Saturday. VOA's John Pitman has details from Lagos. On Monday morning, 
Lagos newspapers used the words "landslide" and "sweep" to describe 
the gains made by the People's Democratic Party, the PDP, in Saturday's 
local government poll. As expected, the PDP drew most of its support 
from states in the central, eastern and northern parts of the country. 
Elsewhere the PDP's gains were overshadowed by its two main rivals. 
Here in the southwest, the Alliance for Democracy, or AD, an ethnic 
Yoruba-based party, won commanding majorities, including the chairmanships 
of 17 of the 20 local governments in Lagos State. In the southeast 
and far north, voters threw their support behind the center-right 
All People's Party. International and domestic observers declared 
Saturday's vote free and fair, an opinion which has largely been echoed 
by the local press. John Pitman, VOA News, Lagos.
