A baby was delivered on a crowded train platform in suburban Bombay 
as loads of coomunters gingerly stepped around a group that gathered 
to help the mother, a local newspaper reported Monday. First aid was 
given to the woman after she delivered a healthy baby boy Friday and 
she was later admitted to a hospital, Bandra station master Karegar 
confirmed Monday. Ammaji Varli, 28, was on the way to the hospital 
with her husband when labor pains forced her to disembark at Bandra. 
Women commuters rushed to cover Varli with their shawls to shield 
her from the rush of harried commuters, Mid-Day newspaper reported. 
A nurse who alighted at the same station took charge, while a beautician, 
also on the platform, provided the scissors needed to cut the umbilical 
cord after a tea stall owned dipped them in boiling water. ``Though 
this is my third child, it is a morning I will never forget .... I 
wish I could know who the people were who helped me out,'' Varli told 
the newspaper. The mother and son were discharged from the hospital 
Monday.
