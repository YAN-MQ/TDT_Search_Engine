Preliminary hearings opened at the High Court Monday in a case which 
lung cancer sufferers hope will be Britain's first class action law 
suit against tobacco companies. Attorney Brian Langstaff is bringing 
eight test cases to seek a judgment on whether 36 of the cancer sufferers 
who were longtime smokers are too late to take legal action. Under 
English law, most personal injury claims have to be lodged within 
three years, although a judge can use discretion. The remainder of 
the 52 cancer sufferers in the suit against Imperial Tobacco Ltd. 
and Gallaher Ltd. are within the three-year time limit. Although tobacco 
lawsuits have been fought for years in the United States, the law 
is not tested in Britain. Attorneys for the cancer patients are fighting 
the case under a 1995 law that allows lawyers to handle ``group action'' 
cases, similar to class-action lawsuits in America, without charging 
unless they win. Langstaff told Judge Michael Wright that his eight 
clients had suffered injury because the cigarettes they bought between 
the 1950s and 1970s contained more tar than was reasonably safe or 
appropriate. Under English law, companies have to minimize risk to 
people from their actions. Attorney Martyn Day argued that he can 
show that Imperial Tobacco and Gallaher, who control 40 percent of 
Britain's tobacco market, were negligent by reducing tar levels in 
cigarettes too slowly through the years. If the cancer victims win, 
thousands more who become sick each year could go to court with strong 
chances to succeed. Day has estimated some 20,000 of the 35,000 people 
who get lung cancer every year in Britain could collect awards of 
50,000 pounds (dlrs 80,000) each. That comes to 1 billion pounds (dlrs 
1.6 billion), more than the two tobacco companies' annual profits 
of 900 million pounds (dlrs 1.44 billion). The current hearing is 
expected two weeks.
