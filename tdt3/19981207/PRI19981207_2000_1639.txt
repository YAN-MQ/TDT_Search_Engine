You are listening to THE WORLD, and you can join us any time online 
24 hours a day at www.theworld.org. This is PRI. I'm Tony Kahn. Ahead 
on THE WORLD, the continuing controversy over the American bombing 
of a Sudanese plant. Five days before President Clinton's visit, Israel's 
prime minister faces his toughest political challenge to date. Also, 
Algerian pop music goes traditional, French restaurateur goes ballistic, 
and a British artist goes bananas. First, this news. For THE WORLD, 
this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in London.
