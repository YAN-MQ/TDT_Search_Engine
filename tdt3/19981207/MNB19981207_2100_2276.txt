About 240 miles above the earth tonight, one of the toughest construction 
projects ever is der way. Two crew members of the shuttle endeavor 
are spacewalking literally into the history books, working to hook 
up the wiring between the first two pieces of the international space 
station. Here with that, Robert Hager. It's a grueling six hour spacewalk 
NASA says could be one of the most difficult ever. The two astronauts 
hooking up 40 different power and computer cables, what some call 
the nervous system of the first two parts of the space station, newly 
joined, they are the Russian-belt electric generator called zarya, 
and the pass yadgeway called unity. Jerry Ross' fifth spacewalk. Actually, 
I worked in steel millions during summer while going to per due university. 
After I finished my bachelor's degree I worked on highway construction 
that summer. And gyms Newman, who likens this to work below. We're 
putting an office building together. Except this occurs more than 
200 miles high. Temperatures that can swing 400 degrees in night and 
day, and in bulky suits. Another 42 launches. The next shot is planned 
this summer in the Russians are ready on time. A Russian-built temporary 
living quarters for the first crew to take up residence, planned for 
some time in the year 2000. There could be even more lab rate quarters 
years later. A mock-up in Houston envisions the first private cubicles 
for astronauts. There is no up or down in weightlessness. The first-ever 
freezer for better food and the first-ever shower. The building has 
begun. A journey of billions of miles and billions of dollars. Beginning 
with the single steps of the spacewalk tonight. Robert Hager, NBC 
news, Washington.
