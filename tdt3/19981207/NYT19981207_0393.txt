Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. said Monday that it would pay Sepracor Inc. up 
to $90 million to license a molecule that is a purer form of Prozac, 
Lilly's market-leading anti-depressant. Sepracor, based in Marlborough, 
Mass., will also receive an undisclosed royalty on sales of the drug, 
R-fluoxetine, which is expected to have fewer side effects than Prozac. 
Analysts said the deal would benefit both companies. For Lilly, R-fluoxetine 
could extend the competitive life of Prozac, its biggest drug, which 
could face an onslaught of generic versions when its patents begin 
expiring in 2001. For Sepracor, the deal brings a welcome influx of 
cash, a potentially large contributor to revenue and a validation 
of its strategy of developing improved drugs based on existing ones. 
Sepracor's patents on R-fluoxetine run until 2015. Shares of Sepracor 
fell $3.125, to $84.875, after hitting a midday high of $95.25 in 
Nasdaq trading. Lilly rose 81.25 cents, to $86.9375, on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Analysts said the deal had been expected and was already 
reflected in the strong performance of Sepracor's shares in recent 
months. R-fluoxetine is in the first of the three phases of human 
clinical trials typically required by the Food and Drug Administration 
for the approval of new drugs. Lilly said that it hoped to complete 
clinical trials by 2001 and that it would file for regulatory approval 
at that time. ``R-fluoxetine is an exciting molecule with a good chance 
of becoming an important new advance in treating depression,'' Sidney 
Taurel, Lilly's president and chief executive, said in a statement. 
``This licensing agreement with Sepracor, coupled with our internal 
progress in developing new anti-depressants, will enable Lilly to 
introduce new and advanced treatments for this debilitating illness 
and to build upon our leadership position in neuroscience products,'' 
he said. Lilly said animal studies showed R-fluoxetine had the potential 
to offer greater flexibility in treating depression and to provide 
treatment benefits for more patients than most currently available 
anti-depressants, including Prozac. Introduced more than 10 years 
ago, Prozac was the first of a family of anti-depressants known as 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which also includes Zoloft, 
made by Pfizer Inc., and Paxil, made by SmithKline Beecham PLC. Although 
safer and more effective than earlier drugs for depression, Prozac 
and its competitors do have side effects, including sexual dysfunction 
and jittery nerves. Nevertheless, the drugs are a huge category, with 
Prozac alone producing worldwide sales of approximately $2.6 billion 
in 1997. Founded in 1984, Sepracor developed a technology to exploit 
the century-old discovery that most chemicals are formed with two 
mirror-image compounds, called isomers. For most drugs, only one side 
of the pair is active, and the other may cause side effects. By isolating 
the active isomer, Sepracor can develop a safer or more effective 
drug. Sepracor patented the isomeric forms of many leading drugs before 
their manufacturers devised ways to copy its technology. Most of those 
companies have been willing to license the improved version of the 
drug from Sepracor; the most successful to date is Hoechst Marion 
Rousell's antihistamine Allegra, which replaced Seldane after that 
drug was found to cause cardiac damage in some patients. Sepracor 
is also awaiting FDA approval for an improved version of albuterol, 
a common asthma drug. ``The basic strategy of Sepracor is low risk,'' 
said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners. ``When you have 
behind you Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Schering Plough and Lilly, you're 
pretty safe,'' he said. ``If you look at the list of drugs they have 
under development, it's very, very long. This is just the beginning 
of the story.''
