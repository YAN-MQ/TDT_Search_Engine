China's male gymnasts eclipsed the competition from South Korea and 
Japan on Monday in defending their team title at the Asian Games, 
opening what threatens to be another Chinese takeover of the gymnastics 
competition. A jubilant South Korea won a tight contest with Japan 
for silver, defending its runner-up title from the last Asian Games 
in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. Theirs was a fascinating duel. Japan 
led South Korea after the first discipline by more than half a point. 
But South Korea clawed its way back with a strong showing in the vault, 
its second discipline, only to drop back later in the competition. 
The South Koreans went into the last round trailing the Japanese by 
close to half a point. But minutes later, with a strong showing on 
the pommel horse while Japan stumbled on the floor, they had fought 
their way back again to secure the silver with 225.750 points to 225.375 
for Japan, once again the bronze medalist. China's team of veterans 
and newcomers led from its opening discipline, the vault. Showing 
greater power, speed, strength, consistency and technique than the 
other teams, the Chinese finished with 230.200 points, nearly a five-point 
cushion over the second-place Koreans. The team competition will be 
used to select qualifiers for the all-around and individual events. 
The competitions to find the best all-around men and women gymnasts 
take place Wednesday, with the individual apparatus championships 
the next day. China will be looking for a clean sweep of the team 
titles when its powerful squad of diminutive teen-age girls battles 
to retain the women's team title Tuesday. The team includes four veterans 
of the squad that captured bronze at last year's World Championships 
and two relative newcomers, including 16-year-old Xu Jing from Beijing, 
who stands just 1.43 meters (4 feet, 8 1/4 inches) tall and weighs 
just 35 kilograms (77 pounds). China's women swept all the gold at 
Hiroshima, led by gymnast Mo Huilan, who swept all four individual 
apparatus titles. Team coach Qian Kui said the squad had no one of 
Mo's quality and replied, ``It's very hard so say,'' when asked whether 
China's women were expected to sweep again. The team veterans include 
Kui Yuanyuan, who won a World Championship gold in 1996 on the floor, 
and bronze on balance beam at the 1997 worlds; Meng Fei, silver medalist 
on the uneven bars at last year's worlds; Liu Xuan, a beam bronze 
medalist at the 1996 worlds and a gold medal winner, again on beam, 
at this year's World Cup in Sabae, Japan; and 17-year-old Bi Wenjing, 
who got bronze on the uneven bars at the 1997 worlds and a gold in 
the same event at the World Cup.
