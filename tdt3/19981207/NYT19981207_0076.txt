Richard Nixon's political advisers were eerily prescient when they 
named his 1972 campaign organization the Committee to Re-elect the 
President: It wasn't too long before his critics dubbed it CREEP, 
a moniker that proved hard to shake, especially after the Watergate 
break-in. Nowadays, when nearly everything in politics is market-tested 
by polls, focus groups and consultants, it would be unthinkable for 
a presidential candidate to blunder into an acronym like CREEP. Consider 
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who is flirting with another run for president 
in 2000. The wholesome, uplifting name Kerrey chose for his political 
action committee, Building America's Conscience &AMP; Kids PAC, has 
an equally wholesome and uplifting (and even cute) acronym, BACKPAC. 
Campaign finance experts estimate that to be competitive in 2000, 
presidential candidates will need to raise a minimum of $22 million 
_ or $50,000 a day _ before the selection of delegates begins in early 
2000. So the hopefuls are building war chests even before they declare 
their candidacies, and most are turning to political action committees 
to raise money. Like corporations, labor unions and advocacy groups, 
congressional leaders and prospective presidential candidates are 
allowed to operate such groups under federal election law. In today's 
fund-raising frenzy, candidates and organizations have to be increasingly 
inventive in thinking up ways to separate donors from their money. 
Although the evidence is anecdotal, there are signs that patriotic, 
optimistic or catchy names help political action committees raise 
more cash. Emily's List, for example, whose memorable name stands 
for Early Money Is Like Yeast, has become the biggest PAC of them 
all, raising money for women candidates in congressional elections. 
``People like to identify themselves with positive terms such as hope, 
future and family,'' said Larry Sabato, a professor of government 
at the University of Virginia. ``Would you rather give to Americans 
for Hope Growth and Opportunity or the Committee for Steve Forbes?'' 
Americans for Hope Growth and Opportunity is the name chosen by Forbes 
for the nonprofit group he founded to raise money and help promote 
his free-market agenda. ``The name is his mantra,'' said Joel Rosenberg, 
an aide to Forbes, the wealthy publisher who made a surprisingly strong 
showing in his upstart bid for the Republican nomination in 1996. 
It's also a bit of a mouthful, Rosenberg conceded. ``Some of us said 
the name was going to be hard to fit around a mug,'' he said. But 
Forbes liked it, and the organization has managed to pull in an impressive 
$13 million from 140,000 donors. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who 
also ran for the Republican nomination in 1996, has two committees: 
Campaign for a New American Century and We the Parents. According 
to an aide, Brian Kennedy, Alexander chose the names himself. In fact, 
aides to all of the prospective 2000 candidates insist that their 
bosses chose their PAC names themselves without the help of polls 
or consultants. Alexander already had a PAC from 1996, the Republican 
Fund for the '90s, but that wouldn't do for 2000, Kennedy said. ``The 
message is for Republicans to provide leadership for the new American 
century, so that's how he picked the name,'' Kennedy explained. We 
the Parents, he added, was chosen because of Alexander's desire to 
put ``government and schools and the culture on the side of parents.'' 
Gary Bauer, a conservative leader making his first bid for national 
office, chose Campaign for Working Families. ``It underscores our 
Main Street focus,'' said Tim Goeglein, a spokesman for Bauer. The 
PAC has already pulled in millions of dollars. So far Vice President 
Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, hasn't set up a committee for 
2000. In the most recent election cycle, though, the vice president 
set up a PAC on behalf of Congressional candidates that was blandly 
named ``Leadership '98'' (Friends of Albert Gore Jr. Inc.). As for 
this time around, ``We're more concerned with the purpose than the 
name,'' said Marla Romash, a political adviser to Gore. Some PAC names 
are unabashedly direct, like the recently created Friends of Newt 
Gingrich. Others strive for a can-do flavor; last spring, New York 
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani unveiled Solutions America, a national 
organization to finance his out-of-state travel and give money to 
other Republican candidates. Some groups don't need stirring acronyms 
or language to stand out in the crowd: In the last election cycle, 
a PAC set up to defeat the effort by former Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., 
to regain his House seat called itself The Deranged One Has Been Dumped 
Committee.
