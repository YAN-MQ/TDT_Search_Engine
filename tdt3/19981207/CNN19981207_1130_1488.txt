In the next few weeks, 11 European nations will adopt a single monetary 
unit -- the Euro. England isn't one of them. Richard Blystone reports, 
the country is well known for reluctance to economic and political 
integration. Sometimes you could think this was not an island but 
a planet. This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England. 
Shakespeare gets credit or blame for some of it but only some. This 
fortress built by nature for herself against infection and the hand 
of war. Uninvaded for nine centuries, Britain alone in Europe was 
never forced to live with outsider' ways. We do things very differently, 
and that's the way we do them. And we're happy doing it that way. 
Everything from the side of the road you drive on, to the playing 
fields of summer, has evolved its own way. "Fog over channel, continent 
cut off!" Poor continent. And that European union anthem sounds German. 
But the channel barrier has been pierced. 20 million people a year 
now pass nonstop between Britain and the continent on dry land. So 
let's ask in the duty free. Now do you trust the Europeans? Trust 
the Europeans?! They're taking us over, aren't they? I'm European, 
so I trust myself. There you see, the younger generation, ready to 
take on the future. German finance minister oskar LaFontaine raised 
a storm here by calling for taxes to be "harmonized" across the union. 
London promises to veto any such move. Here's harmonized lunch in 
London, a Belgian restaurant, and mussels and chips. I think there's 
a lot of mistrust. We're not told that much about it. They give you 
the gloss on everything. But what's really going on? Despite E.U. 
publicity campaigns, pollsters found not one area where a majority 
would give up British decision-making powers to Europe. We're a nation 
of Islanders, whatever the politicians do there is a feeling among 
people that they don't want to be economically or politically tied 
in with Europe. Still, the bulldog breed is loosening up. The six-month 
rabies quarantine that used to keep continental canines from competing 
with British aristocracy at crufts, the only dog show a dog can pronounce, 
is soon to be lifted for dogs that can prove a vaccination, as well 
as a pedigree. Richard Blystone, CNN, London.
