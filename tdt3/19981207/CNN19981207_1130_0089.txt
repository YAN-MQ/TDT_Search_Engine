Judiciary committee member Bob Barr says he thinks the president is 
guilty of perjury, and hasn't done anything to disprove it. The republican 
from Georgia say he thinks votes in favor of impeachment could come 
from both sides of the aisle. On the floor, I think there will be 
some democrats who vote for impeachment and a few republicans that 
may vote against it, although that's difficult to say at this point. 
But I'm pretty sure that we will pick up republican votes and democratic 
votes on the floor. Barr has consistently been one of the president's 
harshest critics.
