White House attorneys are preparing their case for tomorrow's appearance 
before the house Judiciary committee. But President Clinton's lawyers 
are unhappy because they are not getting more time. In a statement 
released by the White House, attorneys say -- White House lawyers 
have 30 hours over the course of two days to defend the president 
against charges of perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of justice.
