Mike Tyson could be sent back to prison. His probation officer is 
expected to file a report on his latest legal problems with the Indiana 
judge who paroled him in 1995. The boxer entered a plea of no-contest 
to misdemeanor assault charges in maryland last week, that could be 
considered a violation of the conditions of his parole. Tyson served 
6 1/2 years behind bars in Indiana for rape.
