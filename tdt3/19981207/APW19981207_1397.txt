Efforts to forge a political solution for Kosovo appeared stalemated 
on Monday after the chief ethnic Albanian negotiator rejected the 
latest American plan for the troubled province. Fehmi Agani said the 
new U.S. draft for a political settlement in the majority Albanian 
province was too close to the views of Serbia. Kosovo is a province 
of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. Most ethnic Albanians, 
however, want independence or substantial self-rule. Speaking to reporters 
in the provincial capital Pristina, Agani blasted the American draft 
as ``unacceptable'' and said it could not be ``considered a basis 
for ... future negotiations.'' The United States is leading diplomatic 
efforts to hammer out a solution which would be acceptable both to 
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians and to the Serbian regime which 
wants to keep control over Kosovo. In Washington, a White House spokesman, 
David Leavy, said America would keep working on a formula to assure 
peace and stability in Kosovo and a return to the kind of autonomy 
the province had until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic canceled 
it a decade ago. ``We are determined to push for a political settlement 
that will bring autonomy to Kosovo,'' Leavy told a reporter. But that 
formula may no longer satisfy ethnic Albanian politicians. Hundreds 
have been killed and almost 300,000 ethnic Albanians displaced in 
a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces against Kosovo's separatists, 
before an October peace agreement brought about a tentative truce. 
American envoy Christopher Hill, shuttling between Belgrade and Kosovo, 
has so far presented four versions of a U.S. formula for the future 
of the province. ``The new (American) draft is ... almost identical 
to the Serbian'' plan, Agani told reporters. Serbia last month released 
its own proposal for Kosovo under which the province would be given 
a degree of autonomy but would remain under Serbian control. According 
to Agani, the latest American version accepted the major Serb demand 
to have Kosovo remain within Yugoslavia as part of Serbia and substantially 
within Serbia's legal system. The changes to which the ethnic Albanian 
side objected most revolved around Kosovo's future parliament which, 
according to the latest American draft, would not be able to pass 
laws. Also, the draft did not foresee Kosovo as having a separate 
government. This latest version of Hill's plan has not been studied 
by the Serbian government, Ivan Sedlak, an official in the Serbian 
team for Kosovo talks, said.
