Feline Transplants Q. Can cats have organ transplants? A. Yes, in 
some cases. The School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of 
California at Davis does about 30 kidney transplants a year for cats, 
at a cost of $3,000 to $4,000. Dr. Clare Gregory, a veterinarian who 
is a professor in the department of surgery and radiological sciences, 
said there were no other transplant programs for dogs or cats, though 
there was initial research on partial liver transplants. Because there 
is no organ procurement program for animals, he explained, veterinarians 
have to use live donors that can survive either donation of one of 
two organs or partial organ transplants. The school's Veterinary Medical 
Teaching Hospital maintains a colony of donor cats, and the owner 
of a cat that receives a kidney has to agree to adopt the donor. No 
need has been found for tissue matching in cats, and rejection of 
a transplanted kidney can easily be suppressed with cyclosporin, Dr. 
Gregory said. Without the drug, rejection occurs in about 21 days. 
The hospital also has a dialysis unit. Cats with acute kidney failure, 
caused by things like poisoning, usually need three to four weeks 
of dialysis, costing $3,000 to $6,000. In cats with chronic kidney 
failure, a few weeks of dialysis before a transplant makes success 
more likely. Readers are invited to submit questions by postal mail
