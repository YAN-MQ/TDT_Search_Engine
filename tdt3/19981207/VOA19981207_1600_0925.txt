Here in the United States, President Clinton has decided to remove 
Iran and Malaysia from the U.S. government's list of major drug-producing 
countries. But as correspondent Nick Simeone reports, he stops short 
of certifying both nations as fully cooperating in the fight against 
illegal drugs. In the case of Iran, the president cites a U.S. government 
review which he says suggests no evidence of significant poppy cultivation 
in usual growing areas. In a letter to Congress, Mr. Clinton says 
it's possible poppies for opium production are still being cultivated 
in remote areas, although unlikely at levels that would meet the definition 
of a major drug-producing country. The president offers no details 
about how the United States obtained evidence to reach these conclusions, 
although his letter to law makers says the Iranian government has 
reported its own success in eradicating poppy growth. One U.S. official 
said he presumes the evidence was gleaned from satellite photos. The 
president's decision to upgrade Iran's performance in the fight against 
illegal drugs occurs at a time when Washington and Tehran have been 
trying to encourage increased contacts after nearly two decades of 
no official diplomatic relations. But one White House aide said that 
desire had no bearing on the U.S. findings regarding drugs. The Clinton 
administration has been advocating a direct government dialogue with 
Iran's leadership with Iran favoring increased cultural or people-to-people 
contacts instead. In the case of Malaysia, that country has been identified 
as a key transit route for heroine reaching the United States. But 
President Clinton says the U.S. government now has no indication that 
drugs significantly affecting the United States have transited the 
country during the past few years. Nick Simon, VOA News, at the White 
House.
