The Islamic group Hamas on Monday denounced President Bill Clinton's 
upcoming visit to the Gaza Strip but made no threats against him. 
Hamas opposes peace with Israel and the U.S.-brokered land-for-security 
accord signed six weeks ago. Spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the group 
does not welcome Clinton, who is due in Gaza next Monday. ``He brings 
nothing for us, or for any Palestinians ... He is a 100 percent supporter 
of Israel.'' While Hamas opposes the visit, in an interview with The 
Associated Press Zahar said the group planned no attacks. ``From our 
side, we won't do anything. We don't believe any aggression against 
this (visit) will serve our purposes,'' he said. ``We will leave him 
to practice his tricks.'' However, Hamas' political wing, of which 
Zahar is a senior leader, customarily denies having prior knowledge 
of attacks by the group's military arm, the Izzedine al Qassam brigades. 
Zahar harshly criticized the U.S. stance on an escalating Israeli-Palestinian 
quarrel over the release of Palestinian prisoners by Israel. Palestinians 
are furious that most of those freed so far have been common criminals 
rather than people jailed for anti-Israel activity. The dispute has 
triggered Palestinian street riots that have left dozens hurt, and 
hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are on a hunger strike. Last week 
Washington said Israel was living up to its commitments on the prisoners. 
``How are we to listen to this?'' Zahar said angrily. Hamas has been 
the target of a crackdown by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority 
since Oct. 29, when it tried to blow up a school bus. The attack killed 
an Israeli soldier whose jeep was escorting the bus. In response, 
Arafat put the group's spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under 
house arrest. Hundreds of Hamas activists were jailed, including several 
senior leaders. Palestinian sources say more Hamas activists will 
be rounded up ahead of Clinton's arrival. Zahar, who was freed recently 
after several weeks in prison, said it would be ``shameful'' for Arafat 
to act against Hamas in connection with the Clinton visit. Asked how 
Hamas would respond, he said only: ``We are going to intensify our 
relationship with God.''
