Christmas trees are a harder sell this year. The vendors who arrive 
the day after Thanksgiving to turn the city's sidewalks and corners 
into oases of evergreen are battling an unseasonable enemy: freakishly 
warm weather. Simply put, it is hard for buyers to think of Christmas. 
That, combined with the effect the strong U.S. dollar has had on depressing 
the price of Christmas trees from Canada, could ultimately mean lower 
prices on the street, though no seller wants to suggest that yet. 
Christmas tree prices now run from $10 for a tiny balsam fir to $200 
for a towering Fraser fir. But some sellers said they are ordering 
cheaper balsams _ costing $20 or less for a 6-foot tree _ earlier 
than usual to spur the flat sales. Normally, these would come toward 
the end of the season to attract people who want the trees for only 
a week or two. In addition to lackluster sales, tree sellers have 
also had to deal with another weather-related problem: Some trees 
that would normally have been naturally refrigerated by December's 
chill are beginning to shed their needles before leaving the street. 
With the weather expected to turn colder, sellers are hoping that 
tree sales will pick up as the holiday nears. But so far, the season 
has been less than merry. ``We're down, everyone in the city is down 
in numbers,'' said Pippa Snook, who for the seventh year is selling 
trees on city sidewalks, the third year at her present location on 
Broadway. ``We're selling a few trees, but it ain't so much,'' said 
Martin Paulson, standing in front of his temporary boreal forest on 
86th Street. In Greenwich Village, Michele Pominville said, ``We haven't 
seen the Christmas spirit we've been looking for.'' Dejan Jesic, a 
nine-year veteran of tree-selling, said vendors generally agree that 
the overall business is down about 20 percent compared with past years 
at this time. He said there is also a consensus that sales will have 
to increase. ``I think everyone who usually has a tree will have one 
sooner or later,'' Jesic said. ``At the end of the season, sales will 
be the same.'' Such optimism is the official position of the National 
Christmas Tree Association, which has been nervously conducting nationwide 
sales surveys. But until the official results are in from last weekend, 
traditionally the high point of the four-week selling season, no one 
will know for sure whether the balmy weather will ultimately have 
an impact on the final tally. ``It is so unusual, I don't really know 
how to gauge it,'' said David Stenger, the association president, 
who owns a tree farm in Illinois. In recent years, street-corner Christmas-tree 
sellers have also been hurt by the big chain stores, such as Home 
Depot and Wal-Mart. They buy trees from farmers early in the season, 
warehouse them and then offer them for as little as $16 as a special 
bargain. The overall Christmas-tree market has changed fundamentally 
over recent decades, as more people have chosen artificial trees. 
According to Gallup Polls commissioned by the Christmas tree association, 
the proportion of natural trees has shrunk from 90 percent of households 
with trees in the 1960s to 46 percent last year. But the number of 
natural trees bought each year has not changed appreciably, staying 
fairly constant at around 35 million, as the total number of households 
has doubled. The relevant calculus from the buyer's perspective is 
this: The number of tree buyers has not changed, but the number of 
trees has increased as tree farming has allowed much more efficient 
production. Meanwhile, the low value of the Canadian dollar compared 
with its U.S. counterpart means that importing Canadian trees is especially 
cheap compared with buying domestic trees. Growers, particularly Canadian 
ones, are hurting. ``There are just too many trees,'' said Randall 
Mailman who harvests 20,000 trees a year from his Ran-Mac Farms in 
Chester, Nova Scotia. ``I've got my whole life in this farm and I'm 
going to end up selling it.'' Another grower, Robert Sanders in Midland, 
Ontario, said the low Canadian dollar means that for a tree priced 
wholesale at $15 Canadian, he gets only $10.25 U.S., compared with 
$12 in most recent years. ``There has always been a price advantage,'' 
he said. ``But this year, there's an extreme advantage.'' But whether 
this helps New Yorkers depends on what happens on the streets between 
now and Christmas. Many retailers make it clear that they don't want 
to cut prices. From this perspective, bad weather _ or at least certain 
types of it _ could help. Last Saturday, sales were briskest during 
a morning rain storm. ``New Yorkers love to buy trees in the rain,'' 
Ms. Snook said. ``It's the next best thing to snow.'' Jesic said the 
problem this year is that there has been no snow _ not even the quickly 
melted sort _ to lodge in people's consciousness as a sign that the 
Christmas season is here. Last year, he said, it snowed on Nov. 27 
and 28. ``That got people in the spirit early,'' he said. One of the 
few buyers said Monday that most people have it all wrong by not buying 
in warm weather. ``This is very pleasant, actually,'' Mary Lisa Burns, 
a modern-dance teacher, said. ``I'm not fighting the crowd, I'm not 
frozen and I have time to discuss Christmas trees.''
