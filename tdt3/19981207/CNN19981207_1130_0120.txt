Attorney general Janet Reno will decide today whether to seek an independent 
counsel to investigate allegations that democrats, including the president, 
broke campaign finance laws. Pierre Thomas looks at how the fine points 
of election law may come into play. For Janet Reno today, yet another 
decision about whether to seek an independent counsel to investigate 
democratic fund-raising abuses. This time the target is President 
Clinton himself. And skeptical republicans are watching closely. When 
you ask me, if I'm starting to lose a little faith that she's going 
to appoint an independent counsel, I never had any to start with. 
Specter, who has repeatedly demanded a wide-ranging investigation 
into democratic fund-raising, is threatening to take Reno to court 
-- to force action. This time, the controversy stems from TV ads like 
this one, paid for by the democratic national committee. President 
Clinton has put a balanced budget plan on the table, protecting medicare, 
Medicaid. Education, environment. But, were these democratic party 
ads just thinly-veiled commercials, specifically designed to benefit 
the Clinton/Gore campaign? Justice investigators want to know if Mr. 
Clinton illegally controlled democratic party ads,allowing him to 
exceed campaign spending limits by millions. The single most important 
thing here is that it must be made clear for the future that these 
are violations of the law, massive violations. Mr. Clinton has denied 
any wrongdoing. His defense, simple. He and dnc officials consulted 
their counsel about the legality of all the ads before they aired. 
That's important, because election law requires the government to 
prove suspects intended to commit crimes. Sources tell CNN, democratic 
campaign officials waived attorney/client privilege to give justice 
investigators full access to the lawyers' role in approving the ads. 
That move may prove persuasive. Law enforcement sources tell CNN, 
some senior justice officials are recommending Reno not seek an independent 
counsel investigation of Mr. clinton. Pierre Thomas, CNN, Washington.
