Fidel Castro has long kept a special place in his heart for Mexico. 
In the 1960s, Mexico stood alone among Latin American countries, defying 
Washington's entreaties to break relations with Communist Cuba. In 
the first two decades of Castro's revolution, Mexico was the only 
major Latin country whose guerrillas he refused to train. Castro even 
held his tongue in recent years, as Mexico has mostly abandoned its 
``anti-Yankee'' foreign policy in favor of closer economic integration 
with the United States. But last week, Castro suddenly abandoned his 
discretion. Addressing an economic conference in Havana, he derided 
contemporary Mexican policies, criticizing the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, accusing the Mexican government of turning its back 
on the third world and of letting American culture overwhelm Mexican 
traditions. ``When they ask Mexican children,'' Castro said, ```Who 
is the father of your country?' it's possible that many don't know.'' 
``But they sure know Mickey Mouse,'' he added, to the nervous titters 
of diplomats and economists. Foreign Minister Rosario Green, who recently 
made a cordial visit to Havana, called in the Cuban ambassador, Curbelo 
Padron, to express ``deep puzzlement'' over the outburst and called 
the Mexican envoy in Cuba back here for consultations. A congressman 
from President Ernesto Zedillo's governing Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, Francisco Javier Santillan Oceguera, called Castro's remarks 
an intervention in Mexico's internal affairs. The president of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee in Congress, Julio Faesler, urged Castro 
to ``keep in mind that we Mexicans feel sorry about the lack of success 
he's had with his own economic development.'' Some analysts suggested 
that Castro had aimed his remarks at former president Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari, who engineered the Nafta accord. But there was little 
evidence of that, because Salinas visited Havana recently and seems 
to enjoy excellent relations with Castro. Other experts suggested 
that Castro, sensing the PRI's potential defeat in presidential elections 
in 2000, was currying favor with opposition parties. Edelmiro Castellanos, 
a Cuban journalist here, saw a wider motive: that Castro was seeking 
to rebuild bridges to leftists all over Latin America, many of whom 
have grown disenchanted with him. ``His image with the left is in 
tatters,'' Castellanos said. A Brazilian Socialist, Luiz Inacio da 
Silva, whose movement has included some of Castro's most enthusiastic 
supporters, criticized Castro this fall because the Cuban has forged 
cozy relations with the Brazilian government, which da Silva views 
as conservative. Castro's backing among prominent Mexican intellectuals 
has cooled in recent years. A political scientist, Sergio Aguayo, 
has traced Mexican leftists' irritation back to 1988 when Castro was 
one of the few world leaders who supported PRI claims that Salinas 
had legitimately won presidential elections. When Castro attended 
Salinas' inauguration, Aguayo and other intellectuals were invited 
to meet him at dinner. Castro launched into a long monologue about 
the time that he spent in Mexico in 1956, preparing his insurgency. 
``It was an offensive situation,'' Aguayo said.
