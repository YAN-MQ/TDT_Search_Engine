On Thursday, the master alarm blared and red lights flashed just before 
the shuttle was to lift off. By the time controllers traced the problem 
to a momentary drop in hydraulic pressure and decided to press ahead, 
it was too late _ they had missed the cutoff by a second or two. ``Sure, 
it's frustrating,'' said Bill Readdy, shuttle program director and 
a veteran shuttle commander. ``But we do things right. We do things 
by the book, and we're not going to cut any corners even if it means 
just shaving a second or two.'' The six astronauts crawled out of 
the shuttle, and two threw up their hands. Cabana held up his thumb 
and index finger a half-inch apart: ``We were that close.'' The problem 
was confined to one of Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units. 
The pressure dropped just long enough to trigger the alarm, evidently 
because of a sensitive switch, then returned to normal. NASA engineers 
spent the day examining the problem, but found nothing wrong with 
any of the systems and were confident it would not reoccur. Endeavour's 
12-day flight is already a year late because of a cash crunch in Russia, 
one of NASA's partners in building the international space station. 
The one-day delay cost NASA about $600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime 
pay. Aboard Endeavour is an American-made connecting passageway named 
Unity. The astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the 
Russian space station piece and attach it to Unity. Then, two spacewalkers 
will hook up all the electrical connections and cables between the 
two cylinders, and attach handrails and tools for future crews. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries from around the 
world gathered again to see Endeavour and its crew off. ``Here we 
have 16 countries cooperating on a venture to the future,'' said Albright. 
``This is a good investment.''
