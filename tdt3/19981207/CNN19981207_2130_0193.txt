Attorney general Janet Reno announced today she will not seek appointment 
of an independent counsel to investigate President Clinton's role 
in campaign fund-raising during the 1996 election. The White House 
says it's gratified by the decision. Pierre Thomas reports. Thank 
you. Janet Reno's decision not to seek an independent counsel to investigate 
President Clinton drew quick political fire. The attorney general 
refuses to act under the clear statements of facts and under the clear 
statements of the law. But for a White House trying to fend off impeachment 
proceedings, reno's decision was a welcome relief. The justice investigation 
centered on whether Mr. Clinton illegally controlled democratic party 
ads, allowing him to exceed campaign spending limits by millions. 
Millions of working families President Clinton cut taxes. Critics 
said democratic national committee ads like this were really just 
thinly veiled commercials specifically designed to benefit the clinton/Gore 
campaign. The dnc ads were supposed to be for general party building, 
not to elect a Specific candidate. White House officials denied any 
wrongdoing. They say election laws governing political commercials 
are murky at best. In addition, the White House argued Mr. Clinton 
and democratic party officials consulted with legal counsel to clear 
the ads before they ran. That's important because election law requires 
the government to prove suspects intended to break the law. Reno concluded 
-- but the threat of an independent counsel to investigate campaign 
finance remains. Reno has yet to decide whether to seek an outside 
probe of Harold Ickes, former deputy White House chief of staff. CNN 
has learned Carol Bruce, the independent counsel investigating interior 
secretary Bruce Babbitt, has sent Reno a letter requesting authority 
to fold Ickes into her ongoing probe. Bruce is looking into whether 
Babbitt lied to Congress about whether campaign donations influenced 
his department's decision to block an application for an Indian gambling 
casino. Sources tell CNN the Bruce letter may well persuade Reno to 
seek an independent counsel investigation of Ickes. That could lead 
to another Clinton nightmare, a broad probe of alleged democratic 
fund-raising abuses reaching stretching directly into the White House.
