Still ahead, dangerous sailing -- are cruise lines doing enough to 
protect passengers from crimes at sea? Everything is done for the 
protection of the company, not for the passenger. Is there a crime 
wave on cruise ships? What you should know to protect yourself. NBC 
news "in depth" -- a young girl, desperately ill. Her father, in prison. 
Should he be allowed to risk his own life to save hers? Forget these. 
Remember this? Smile. eat. Make a mess. Make a memory. Escape to red 
lobster.
