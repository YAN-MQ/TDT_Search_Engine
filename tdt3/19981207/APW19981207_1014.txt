Assuming a familiar stance, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz 
and Russian leaders on Monday expressed a shared desire to see a swift 
end to the U.N. sanctions against the Arab nation. ``We believe that 
soon the sanctions will be lifted,'' Russia's Foreign Minister Igor 
Ivanov told a news conference after meeting Aziz. Despite Ivanov's 
optimism, there are no signs that the United States and Britain, the 
leading proponents of sanctions, are prepared to ease their position 
following repeated showdowns with Iraq over weapons inspections. Russia 
called for a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with United 
Nations resolutions, saying this should help wrap up seven years of 
U.N. weapons inspections. ``This review is to lead us to the lifting 
of the embargo,'' Ivanov said. ``We are approaching the end of a long 
process.'' When pushing its case for sanctions relief, Iraq often 
turns to Russia, which has long had good relations with Baghdad and 
wants to take part in rebuilding Iraq's shattered economy. Iraq agreed 
to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors last month after 
a confrontation that nearly led to military strikes by the United 
States. Aziz said he hoped that ``lawful and objective inspections'' 
could take place next month. And he again criticized the U.N. Security 
Council for failing to end the embargo placed on Iraq after its 1990 
invasion of Kuwait. ``For more than seven years Iraq has been following 
through on its obligations, but the Security Council hasn't been meeting 
its obligations,'' Aziz said. ``This is unacceptable.'' However, U.N. 
inspectors say Baghdad has repeatedly hidden weapons material and 
information that it must turn over to win sanctions relief. Aziz also 
met Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has mediated on several 
occasions when Iraq and the United Nations were in the midst of confrontations. 
While offering Iraq moral support, Russia insists that Baghdad comply 
with U.N. Security Council resolutions that call for the dismantling 
of all weapons of mass destruction. Iraq desperately wants to resume 
exporting oil at full capacity. It is permitted only limited oil exports 
at present to buy food and medicine. Russia, meanwhile, wants to recover 
billions of dollars in debts that Iraq ran up in the 1980s when it 
bought large quantities of weapons to wage war with Iran. Russian 
firms have already signed many large business contracts with Iraq, 
but they can't be implemented until the sanctions are lifted. However, 
oil prices are already sagging due to a worldwide oil glut, and if 
Iraq increased its exports, prices could fall even lower.
