Garth Ancier became the third top programmer in the last month to 
leave his network when he announced Monday that he was stepping down 
as president of entertainment for WB. He will be replaced by Susanne 
Daniels, who had been the executive vice president for prime-time 
series. Ms. Daniels becomes the third woman to hold the job of president 
of entertainment at a network, following Jamie Tarses at ABC and Nancy 
Tellem at CBS. Ancier will remain at WB, owned by Time Warner, as 
a programming consultant until his contract expires in May. He also 
intends to retain an ownership stake in the network. He is not permitted 
to open negotiations for a new position until February, but it is 
widely expected that NBC will pursue him for the job as its president 
of entertainment. Under Ancier, WB has recorded more growth in the 
last two years than any other network and has established a core of 
shows, like ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Seventh Heaven'' and ``Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer,'' which have strong appeal to young viewers, especially 
teen-agers. WB executives on Monday credited Ms. Daniels with having 
a hand in the acquisition and development of all those programs and 
several others. The decision to promote Ms. Daniels now moves up a 
timetable already set in motion by the network. Ms. Daniels, 33, said 
her contract had called for her to be named president of entertainment 
in June, at which time Ancier, 40, would have been elevated to president 
of the network. Ancier had been negotiating a new contract with the 
top WB executive, Jamie Kellner, over the last few months, but they 
could not reach an agreement. According to several executives at WB, 
Ancier, who started his career at NBC, has wanted a chance to program 
one of the full-time networks. ``I told them some time ago the direction 
I wanted to go in,'' Ancier said Monday. ``I do think it's better 
for the company to have this kind of orderly transition.'' Both Ancier 
and Ms. Daniels said they had worked well together. ``I'm really going 
to miss Garth,'' Ms. Daniels said. Ancier predicted that WB, which 
has surpassed the other fledgling network, UPN, in the competition 
to become a viable fifth broadcast network, would continue to grow. 
``I think they're in great shape,'' he said. ``The new show development 
looks terrific. I'm going to be keeping my ownership stake.'' Ancier 
owns 2 percent of WB. That will put him in an unusual position should 
he join a competing network like NBC. He said: ``It is a little odd. 
How often to do you help start up a network and then wind up competing 
against it?'' Ms. Daniels will have an unusual conflict of her own. 
She will program shows to compete with Fox's ``King of the Hill,'' 
a show whose executive producer, Greg Daniels, is her husband. Ms. 
Daniels will also be adding the title of president of Kids WB, the 
network's schedule of weekday afternoon and Saturday morning blocks 
of programs for children. And she will begin heading WB's in-house 
production company. She said WB would add two more hours of prime-time 
programming next fall, bringing the network's total to 13. ``And if 
we find the right show, we might move into late night,'' Ms. Daniels 
said. Movies are also likely to become part of the lineup, she added. 
Ancier said he would remain active consulting on the development and 
casting of WB's prospective new shows for the fall. But he will not 
be able to consider any offer from NBC or anyone else until February. 
``It's not something I have a choice about,'' he said. ``How it all 
works out, I've got to wait and see.''
