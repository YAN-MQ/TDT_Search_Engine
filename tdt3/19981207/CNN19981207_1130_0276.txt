The first two modules of the international space station are now firmly 
connected and soaring high above earth alongside the space shuttle 
"Endeavour." Today, astronauts Jerry Ross and James Newman will perform 
a 6 1/2 hour spacewalk to hook up power to the station. It took astronaut 
Nancy Curry several hours last night to join the parts using the shuttle's 
robotic arm. The parts are large, 77 feet long, and they had to be 
aligned perfectly.
