There's a transatlantic deal in energy. I'm Jan Hopkins at the CNN 
Financial Newsdesk in New York with this edition of "Dollars & Sense." 
Scottish power is buying Oregon-based Pacificorp in a deal valued 
at nearly $8 billion. Pacificorp is the third largest utility west 
of the Mississippi. It serves customers in seven states. It's the 
first takeover ever of a major U.S. utility by an overseas company. 
We've grown from being Scotland's largest utility to the largest utility 
in the U.K., serving gas, power, electricity and telecoms. We've been 
looking for the last 12 months in the U.S., and we're very pleased 
to be putting this transaction together with Pacificorp, one of the 
largest electricity companies in the USA. The deal is still subject 
to regulatory approval.
