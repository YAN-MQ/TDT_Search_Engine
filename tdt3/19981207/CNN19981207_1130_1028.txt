As the end of the year approaches, CNN takes a look back as what we 
consider the ten biggest business stories of the year. The sudden 
collapse and bailout of the long-term capital management hedge fund. 
Peter vials reports. As the brainchild of one of Wall Street's best 
and brightest, john merry weather. His strategy cooked up by economists 
was supposed to be fool-proof. Find investments that couldn't go wrong 
and bet on them with borrowed money. The world in 1998 did not behave 
the way John assumed it would. Whether their bets were right or wrong, 
they weren't right soon enough. When you're leveraged, you have to 
make margin calls. It's not enough to be right. You have to be right 
at the right time. The potential losses were staggering, estimates 
ran into the hundreds of billions. The federal reserve convinced Wall 
Street's biggest firms led by Merrill lynch and Goldman sachs to buy 
control of the fund for $3.6 billion. The plight of ltcm might have 
caused a ripple in financial markets or among financial regulators 
18 months ago. But in current circumstances, it was judged to warrant 
attention. At one point Warren Buffett toyed with buying the fund. 
He didn't, but he did put a supposedly sophisticated investing strategy 
into simple terms. He said, you never know who is swimming naked until 
the tide goes out. That's it for this edition of "Dollars & Sense."
