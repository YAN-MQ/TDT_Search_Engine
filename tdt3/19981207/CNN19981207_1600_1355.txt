Starting a small business takes a burning entrepreneurial spirit. 
A singular bold vision. The courage to fight an endless uphill battle. 
But that's not all you need. Oh, no... we need some furniture. And 
some curtains would be nice. That's why you need the visa business 
card. Because Jules seltzer furniture, like millions of other places, 
doesn't take any card from American express. I love these chairs! 
And I'm really happy with these window treatments. What? It's everywhere 
you want to be.
