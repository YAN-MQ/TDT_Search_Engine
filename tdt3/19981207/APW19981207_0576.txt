The United States is offering an aid package to Georgia that will 
include $5 million in cash and 35,000 tons of wheat, a Georgian presidential 
aide said Sunday. The aid package was unveiled at a meeting between 
President Eduard Shevardnadze and U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Yallovic 
on Saturday, Georgian spokesman Vakhtang Abashidze told reporters. 
The cash will be used to support social programs in Georgia, he said. 
Meanwhile, Georgia has asked the International Monetary Fund for loans 
to help it cope with the impact of poor grain harvests, a lack of 
fuel and the economic crisis in neighboring Russia. Georgia's central 
bank ceased propping up its currency, the lari, and let it float freely, 
a move supported by the IMF, said presidential aid Teimuraz Basilia.
