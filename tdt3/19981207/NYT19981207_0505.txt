The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 8: Even the 
most die-hard Jets fan knows that the team's come-from-behind victory 
over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday was outright robbery _ a gift 
not from the deity, as the Jets coach, Bill Parcells, would have it, 
but from a linesman whose eyes or mind must have wandered. Vinny Testaverde 
clearly came up short when he tried a quarterback sneak in the final 
seconds, but an official signaled a touchdown, even though video replays 
showed that the ball never crossed the goal line. Seattle's hopes 
of making the playoffs were shattered, and the Jets' hopes of winning 
the division remained intact. This fiasco came after a botched call 
the week before that allowed the New England Patriots to beat the 
Buffalo Bills, thanks to a pass that was ruled complete even though 
video replays showed that the receiver was out of bounds. The Patriots 
went on to win after another highly questionable call, knocking the 
Bills out of a first-place tie and keeping the Pats in playoff contention. 
Such season-turning mistakes are ample reason for the National Football 
League to reinstate instant replay to confirm or overturn questionable 
calls. Some critics of instant replay feel the number of bad calls 
is too small to warrant concern, or that human error is part of the 
game, or that subjective judgment will still be required to evaluate 
the videotapes, or that taking time out to review videotapes interrupts 
the flow of the game. Never mind that commercials interrupt the flow 
far more often. Instant replay is no panacea. The tape can be inconclusive, 
and its evaluators can make mistakes. But videotapes can make some 
calls definitively and can provide an additional angle of vision. 
When technology can prevent a game- or season-turning injustice, to 
refuse to use it is unreasonable.
