Colon cancer is the number two cause of cancer deaths in the United 
States. But if detected early, it is often curable. Which is why researchers 
at Johns Hopkins University began looking for the earliest possible 
sign of the disease. What they found is a genetic defect in four out 
of ten colon cancer patients. It's a Gene that fails to do its job 
of shutting down cell growth. What's unusual here is that we see the 
same abnormality, not just in the cancer, but also in the normal tissue 
of the same patients. The next step is to learn if having this defect, 
greatly increases the chances of getting colon cancer at some time 
in life. For the latest health news online, check out CNN.com/health.
