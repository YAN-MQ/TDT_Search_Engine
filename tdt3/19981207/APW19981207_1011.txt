The Irish Republic will host Northern Ireland in an exhibition soccer 
game next year, with the proceeds going to the victims of last August's 
Omagh bombing. The game will be at Lansdowne Road, Dublin, May 29 
and likely will attract a capacity 50,000 crowd. A car bomb planted 
by Irish Republican Army dissidents in the Northern Ireland town of 
Omagh killed 29 people and injured 370 Aug. 15 in the worst atrocity 
in the province's 30-year conflict. Details of the game were announced 
Monday along with several other matches being organized by Ireland 
as it prepares for European Championship qualifying games against 
Macedonia, Yugoslavia, Croatia and Malta. Mick McCarthy's team also 
will host Paraguay Feb. 10 and Sweden April 28. After the game against 
Northern Ireland in May, the Irish will visit Poland Aug. 18 and Denmark 
in Copenhagen Oct. 9.
