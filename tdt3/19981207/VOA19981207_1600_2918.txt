It's time now for business news, and let's go to New York and see 
if we've recovered some of the loses of last week. Here's Breck Ardery. 
Yes, we have. Dow Jones Industrial average closing at 9,070, up 54 
points; Standard and Poors, 500, closing at 1187, that was up 11 points. 
Nasdaq was up 37 at a new high. Well, analysts say stocks continue 
to rebound, which began Friday when bargain hunters came into the 
market after those big sell-offs earlier last week.
