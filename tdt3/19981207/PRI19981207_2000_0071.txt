Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has survived another challenge 
to his rule. He did so by postponing a crucial parliamentary vote. 
Meanwhile, there have been more clashes in the West Bank between Israeli 
troops and Palestinian demonstrators. Liz Doucet reports from Jerusalem. 
Mr. Netanyahu has survived another test but only by postponing it. 
He was saved from a crucial vote on early elections by a small religious 
party in his own right-wing coalition. United toward Judaism agreed 
to change the bill to a vote of no confidence. That means it will 
be delayed by a week, but it could be put off for up to two weeks, 
since the American president, Bill Clinton, is due to arrive this 
weekend. The visit expected to breathe more life into the peace process, 
but everyday seems to bring another blow. Liz Doucet, BBC Jerusalem.
