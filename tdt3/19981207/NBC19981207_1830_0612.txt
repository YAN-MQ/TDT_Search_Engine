240 miles above earth tonight, one of the toughest construction projects 
ever is under way. Two cue members of the shuttle "endeavour" are 
space walking into the history, hooking up the wiring for the first 
international space station. Here's Robert Hager. It's a grueling, 
6 1/2-hour spacewalk that NASA says could be one of the most difficult 
ever. The two astronauts hooking up 40 different outside power and 
data transmission cables, what one official calls the "nervous system" 
of the first two parts of the space station. Newly joined, they are 
the Russian-built electric generator and steering module called "zarya," 
or "sunrise," and the U.S.-built, six-sided connecting passageway 
called "unity." The astronauts, chosen for experience -- Jerry Ross, 
fifth spacewalk, a Mechanical engineer with practical training as 
well. Actually, I worked in steel mills during Summers when I was 
going through purdue University. And after I'd finished my bachelor's 
degree, and before I started my master's degree, I worked on highway 
construction that summer. And James Newman, who once walked in space 
for seven hours straight -- he too likens this to work below. Essentially, 
we are putting an office building together, Except this job occurs 
more than 200 miles high, in temperatures that can swing 400 degrees 
between night and day and in bulky suits and gloves that make movement 
difficult and tiresome. And this is only the first of more than 100 
spacewalks to build the space station -- and another 42 launches. 
The next shot is planned this summer if the Russians are ready on 
time, a Russian-built temporary living quarters for the first crew 
to take up residence in the space station, planned for sometime in 
the year 2000. And there could be even more elaborate quarters years 
later. A mock-up shows how it may have private compartments, with 
sleeping areas upright, because there is no up or down in the weightlessness 
of space, and the first-ever shower in space if engineers can design 
a way to vacuum off water. The building has begun, a journey of millions 
of miles and billions of dollars. Begins with the single steps of 
the first spacewalk tonight. Robert Hager, NBC news, Washington.
