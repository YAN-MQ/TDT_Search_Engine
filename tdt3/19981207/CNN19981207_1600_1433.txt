That letter your child mailed to Santa may not exactly be headed to 
the North Pole. Many of the notes sent to Mr. Claus are winding up 
at a General Electric plant in Schenectady, New York. That's because 
the zip code for the plant is 12345. And it seems some children use 
the first five numbers as the zip code for the North Pole. But the 
letters aren't going unanswered. Members of a special employees committee 
have been reading the letters and writing back to the kids.
