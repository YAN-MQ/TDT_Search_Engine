You can see rainfall continuing to move into the east and another 
storm rolling in through the northwest. Behind that cold front moving 
into the east, much cooler temperatures are sliding eastward, too. 
Consequently there could be a few isolated thunderstorms in the rain 
showers. Only northern New England would see snowfall in association 
with that weather system. In the west a lot of snow. Your forecast 
for high temperatures calls for cold weather in the west. Relatively 
warm in parts of the southeast. A short-lives situation. As you look 
at your extended forecast, cooler weather continues its easterly movement. 
Thursday, rain showers and thunderstorms in the southern plains states. 
On Friday, you can see rainfall scattered from the Great Lakes down 
to the gulf coast with snow flurries possible near the Great Lakes.
