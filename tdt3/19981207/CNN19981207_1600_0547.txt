From trade to travel, today's Europe is becoming a place without borders. 
Nowhere is this more evident than in one of the region's most historically 
disputed areas. Jim bitterman explains. Along the rhine river between 
French alsace and Germany, the relics of past defenses and past wars 
stand useless and abandoned. Repeatedly, governments tried to secure 
the region by force. And repeatedly, they failed. But lessons were 
learned nonetheless. Four times in less than a century, alsace went 
back and forth between France and Germany. That painful process people 
learned here, perhaps better than anywhere else, how to adwopt to 
a new situation and how to get along with their neighbors. Now, along 
the border, there are relics of peace. Customs posts as useless and 
abandoned as the military defenses, because alsace has already lived 
much of this decade in a Europe without borders. Take the alsacian 
city of savern for instance. Germans and French once fought in the 
city's streets. Today, a statue to Europe stands in the courtyard 
of city hall and an intersection has been renamed the crossroads of 
Europe. And not far away, European subsidies helped pay for a hi-tech 
industrial park. The mayor has no doubt his constituents are just 
as pro-Europe as he is. We know that we have more chances for freedom, 
more chances for prosperity, more chances to influence world affairs 
if we get together and we integrate Europe. On a parcel of several 
hundred acres of alsacian Woodland that has been in dispute between 
Germany and France since world war II, hikers regularly cross from 
one country to the other without even thinking where the border might 
be. An attitude 99-year old alsacian Josef uhlman would approve. In 
world war I, the Germans sent him into battle to keep alsace German. 
And in world war II the French send him to the front lines to keep 
alsacce French. Uniting Europe is a much better approach, he says. 
People no longer want to make war, they have become more intelligent. 
That is something on which many of his neighbors can agree. Jim bitterman, 
CNN. In French alsace.
