Scientists are getting a good look at the first close-up pictures 
of the North Pole of Mars, sent back by the Mars global surveyor spacecraft. 
They say the pole looks unlike anything they've ever seen, with smooth 
slopes in some places, deep Gorges and steep cliffs in others. But 
it's also smaller and holds less water than expected. Other geologic 
features suggest Mars may have once had a big ocean, although the 
Martian North Pole doesn't have enough water to fill one. Still, scientists 
say because the polar ice is made of water, there is hope of finding 
traces of ancient life.
