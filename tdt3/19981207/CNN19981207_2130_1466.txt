The sheriff's department in Malibu, California, says supermodel Cindy 
crawford was not seriously injured when her husband ran their Jeep 
into a Concrete mailbox yesterday. He swerved to avoid hitting a horse 
on the pacific coast highway and the passenger window shattered on 
impact. Crawford got pieces of glass in her eyes, which paramedics 
washed out with water. She was not hospitalized.
