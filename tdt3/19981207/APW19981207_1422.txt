About 150 angry French farmers demanding subsidies for rural agriculture 
in the Alps blocked a highway on Monday cutting access to a tunnel 
linking France and Italy. About 100 truckers seeking to enter France 
from Italy were stuck Monday evening in the Maurienne Valley. The 
farmers used about 10 tractors to block the RN6 highway, preventing 
any traffic from using the road and also managed to penetrate the 
A43 highway using bales of hay to impede traffic. The farmers say 
that they are threatened by reforms in European Union that would reduce 
their subsidies and need extra help from the French government. Some 
3,600 vehicles used the Frejus tunnel between France and Italy, which 
is now blocked.
