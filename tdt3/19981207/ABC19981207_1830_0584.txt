In Miami today, the U.S. customs service has been patting itself on 
the back for recovering a stolen Moon rock. In the 30 years since 
Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon, that's never happened. Here is 
ABC's Ned Potter. The "Apollo" astronauts went 250,000 miles to collect 
Moon rocks, and ever -- Nobody owns a piece of the Moon. We all own 
it. Sealed in plastic which they said a Florida man kept in his safe 
deposit box and tried to sell to undercover agents for $5 million. 
We're taking a piece of the rock itself. The rock from the Apollo 
17 flight had been given to a gift to honduras. It was allegedly smuggled 
back here. We started this investigation thinking we were going to 
get bogus lunar material. We really didn't expect to come up with 
a real one. Almost 100 samples have been presented to forge governments 
for good will and the U.S. cannot tell if some of them have reached 
the black market. There have been no charges yet. It turns out there 
are no laws against owning a Moon rock, but there are plenty against 
smuggling one through customs. Ned Potter, ABC News, New York.
