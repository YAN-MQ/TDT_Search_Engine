A Russian-flagged Italian survey ship rescued 52 clandestine African 
immigrants from rough waters south of Malta, but navy officials said 
Sunday there was little hope of finding five missing people. Authorities 
in Valletta, where the immigrants arrived Sunday, said the immigrants 
had been aboard a rickety wooden boat for two days without food or 
water. Survivors told police and military officials that their voyage 
of hope had begun in various African ports where they were picked 
up a ship. But after some days, the crew put them in the wooden craft 
and abandoned them, the officials said. When crew aboard the ship 
that came to their aid told them they would be taken aboard, the immigrants, 
too anxious to wait, jumped into the waters about 90 miles south of 
Malta and started swimming toward the Akademia Nicolas Starakov, which 
then plucked them up. The would-be immigrants were apparently hoping 
originally to reach Sicily, reports indicated. Thousands of people 
try to slip into Italy illegally to seek work or families in Western 
Europe. Italy's long, largely unpatrolled coasts attract smugglers, 
who pull up to beaches during the night and drop off the immigrants 
who have paid thousands of dollars for the voyage.
