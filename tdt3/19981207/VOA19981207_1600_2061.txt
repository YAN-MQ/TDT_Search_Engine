White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, told reporters Monday that 14 
witnesses for President Clinton will testify before the House Judiciary 
Committee, which is considering impeachment of the president. We are 
going to present over the next two days a very serious case for why 
the allegations as raised do not meet a constitutional standard for 
impeachment. We'll go through, from a historical perspective, each 
of the articles that have been articulated in the media -- so we assume 
that that is what the committee has in mind -- and the president's 
counsel will do a summation based on the facts and the law about why 
this doesn't rise to the level of impeachment. Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Henry Hyde, meanwhile, says he hopes Mr. Clinton's witnesses 
will be provide evidence that the president is not guilty and not 
simply argue that the proceedings are unfair. And I can tell you for 
almost two months I have been pleading with the White House and the 
committee Democrats to present some additional evidence that might 
demonstrate the president's innocence. But we haven't heard one word 
about evidence repudiating or rejecting the facts. Mr. Clinton faces 
allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice in an alleged effort 
to conceal a sexual affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. I'm Dave DeForest, 
VOA News.
