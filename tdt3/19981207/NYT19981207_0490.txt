The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 8: One of the 
sorriest episodes in modern Justice Department history has concluded 
with another demonstration of Attorney General Janet Reno's obstinacy. 
For the third time in a month, she has refused to hand her department's 
anemic investigation into President Clinton's 1996 campaign abuses 
over to an independent counsel. Both the FBI director and Justice's 
top prosecutor for campaign finance urged her to appoint an independent 
counsel under the part of the law allowing an attorney general to 
avoid conflicts of interest. Although she is mired in conflict, Ms. 
Reno decreed that no one would be appointed to investigate whether 
her boss illegally used ``soft money'' to support his re-election. 
Congress now has a duty to demand an inquiry run by someone not beholden 
to Clinton. Her action was based on her finding that Clinton did not 
``knowingly and willfully'' violate the law because he allegedly acted 
based on his lawyers' advice. Clinton is entitled to assert that his 
lawyers let him do it. But Ms. Reno is too compromised, and perhaps 
too hostile to the independent counsel statute, to look at the president's 
behavior objectively. The decision should be based on an examination 
of Clinton's actions, not just his excuses. In 1996 he boasted at 
fund-raisers that he would get around spending limits by using Democratic 
Party soft-money accounts to pay for television ads designed to promote 
re-election. If it were possible to escape investigation simply by 
citing lawyers' advice, countless defendants would have marched free 
through that loophole. In fact, Ms. Reno is arrogating to herself 
legal judgments about the president's intent that should be the province 
of an independent outsider. For two years her tactics have centered 
on dividing up the 1996 fund-raising abuses into slices, and then 
ruling that each slice is too trivial to investigate. But faced with 
the most reckless White House spending in a generation, she had to 
invent the new excuse that Clinton could ignore the law because his 
lawyers gave him a pass. Last week, looking at the same behavior, 
the staff and counsel of the Federal Election Commission found that 
both Clinton and Bob Dole, the Republican nominee, broke the law. 
That finding was right. Ms. Reno should have seized on it to ask for 
an independent counsel. Instead, she virtually invited the Federal 
Election Commission members to toss it aside. Under Janet Reno the 
United States has a Justice Department that chops off the legal process 
when necessary to protect her political sponsors. Soon she will make 
an unlamented exit to Florida, but the disgrace will linger over the 
department she has compromised.
