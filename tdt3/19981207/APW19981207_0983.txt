Olympic silver medalist Yukimasa Nakamura didn't want to stick around 
for a fight Monday, wrapping up an Asian Games judo gold medal in 
just 70 seconds. Nakamura, one of three brothers on the Japanese judo 
team, scored a clean ippon victory over Kazakstan's Ivan Baglayev 
in the half lightweight division. Nakamura defended the Asian Games 
title he won four years ago in Hiroshima and is focussed on improving 
his Olympic silver to a gold at the Sydney 2000 games. ``I want this 
win to be a springboard for me ahead of Sydney,'' Nakamura said. ``It 
was good to execute my strategy the way I planned.'' At extra lightweight, 
Kazuhiko Tokuno needed 4 minutes, 53 seconds to finish China's Yang 
Bo, twisting his opponent to the mat. In the women's extra lightweight 
class, Tomoe Makabe overcame North Korea's Cha Hyon Hyang on a referee's 
decision. Nakamura's brothers Yoshio and Kenzo will also compete at 
the games.
