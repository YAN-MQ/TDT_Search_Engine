Ailing Russian President Boris Yeltsin is trying to impose his waning 
authority in the Kremlin. Earlier today, he made a brief appearance 
at his office to sack a number of advisors. With details, here's Robert 
Parsons. Boris Yeltsin rose from his sick bed and drove through a 
slow storm today to warn his administration that enough was enough. 
Russian TV showed him with a meeting of his staff looking angry and 
stabbing the air with his fingers. He explained that he had sacked 
Valentine Yumasha from three of his aides 'cause the administration 
had failed to stop the erosion of trust in presidential authority. 
Mr. Yeltsin is unhappy at the way his latest spell in the hospital 
has left him sidelined from power. Even his own aides openly concede 
that he no longer plays a part in the day-to-day running of the country. 
Robert Parsons, BBC News, Moscow.
