In St. Louis, a federal judge is deciding whether a University radio 
station that carries National Public Radio can reject funding from 
an organization based on that organization's views. It's the Ku Klux 
Klan that's trying to provide the funding. Here's ABC's dean Reynolds. 
On your station for in-depth news and intelligent talk, we're 0.7 
kwmu. Kwmu, owned and operated by the University of Missouri at St. 
louis, is the public radio station here, and it has a problem. The 
Ku Klux Klan, the infamous, race-baiting, cross-burning Klan, wants 
to sponsor the station's broadcast of National Public Radio's "all 
things considered." There's a lot of educated people that seem to 
listen to that radio station. If I can attract five for the money 
that I donated to the University, then i look at it as if I gained. 
In exchange for his donation, cuffley wants the station to explain 
on the air that the money came from the Klan, "A white, Christian 
organization standing up for the rights and values of white Christian 
americans since 1865." The radio idea is part of a broadcast campaign 
by the Klan to overcome its bloody legacy by appearing civic-minded. 
But the University, which permits planned parenthood and gay and lesbian 
groups as radio sponsors, said no to the KKK. I came to the conclusion 
that we would lose many of our donors, particularly some of our very 
large donors. So cuffley has sued. It's a program that's offered to 
everybody in Missouri, to buy radio time on that network, and I just 
feel that I deserve the right, too. Some agree cuffley has a opponent 
on the grounds of free speech. Still others, say it's a lot of fuss 
about nothing. The Klan won't win many converts. You can put lipstick 
on a pig and call her Monique, and she's still a pig. a federal judge 
is expected to decide the issue this week. Dean Reynolds, ABC News, 
St. Louis.
