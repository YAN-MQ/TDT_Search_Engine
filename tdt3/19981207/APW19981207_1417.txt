Palestinian police opened fire Monday on rioters protesting Israel's 
refusal to release Palestinian prisoners _ the first sign that the 
Palestinian police were containing violence in advance of President 
Bill Clinton's visit this week. In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian 
police took to the rooftops and fired onto a crowd of some 3,000 Palestinians, 
mostly bystanders who had gathered to watch the rioting. Witnesses 
said at least five people were wounded and taken away to hospitals. 
A Jewish settler driving near the city of Jenin, also in the northern 
West Bank, was shot and wounded from gunfire towards his car, the 
Israeli army said. The settler, a resident of the nearby settlement 
of Ganim, managed to drive to an Israeli army outpost several kilometers 
(miles) away and was taken from there to a hospital in Afula, Israel. 
The shooting at a settler was the first since the Israeli army withdrew 
from that area last month as part of the Mideast land-for-peace accord 
and left Ganim and several other settlements isolated and surrounded 
by Palestinian-controlled areas. Protests on, 4th graf pvs
