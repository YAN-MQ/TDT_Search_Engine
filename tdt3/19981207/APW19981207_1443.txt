Endeavour's astronauts overcame their first hurdle Saturday in building 
the international space station: hoisting the 25,000-pound Unity chamber 
from the shuttle cargo bay with only an inch of clearance on either 
side. An even tougher job awaits them Sunday, when they attempt to 
pluck a much larger Russian station component from orbit and attach 
it to Unity without a direct line of sight. The six shuttle astronauts 
have been chasing the component named Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) 
since they rocketed into orbit Friday. They trailed the giant cylinder 
by 6,000 miles Saturday evening. Astronaut Nancy Currie used Endeavour's 
50-foot robot arm to lift Unity, the first American-made piece of 
the international space station. She moved the precious load slowly 
_ so slowly it almost appeared at first to be motionless. ``Beautiful 
and delicate work,'' radioed Mission Control. Currie raised Unity 
about 13 feet before tilting it to an upright position above a docking 
ring in the cargo bay. She lowered the cylinder to within a few inches 
of the ring; then the pilots fired Endeavour's thrusters and the shuttle 
moved up just enough for the pieces to snap together. The entire process 
took two hours. ``We've got Unity firmly attached to Endeavour,'' 
shuttle commander Robert Cabana reported, ``and we're off to a great 
start on building the international space station.'' Unity will serve 
as a connecting passageway once more modules arrive over the next 
few years. It's 36 feet long and 15 feet in diameter, and is composed 
of 50,000 mechanical parts, 216 fluid and gas lines, and 121 electrical 
cables containing a mind-boggling six miles of wiring. It barely fit 
in Endeavour's cargo bay, widthwise; there was only an inch to spare 
on either side, making Currie's job especially difficult. The last 
thing she wanted to do was bump Unity against the shuttle while lifting 
it from its horizontal position and setting it upright in preparation 
for Sunday's coupling with Zarya. The jointed shuttle arm, which also 
will be used for handling the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, has never 
wielded such massive objects before. The two station components are 
so big that Currie won't be able to see where they meet by looking 
out the window; she'll rely solely on a computerized vision system 
to line them up, the first ``in-the-blind'' docking attempt of its 
kind. ``It's not so much a case of how difficult it is,'' Currie explained 
before the flight, ``just how careful we have to be and how time-consuming 
it is.'' Zarya, launched Nov. 20 from Kazakstan, contains all the 
power and propulsion systems needed for the fledgling space station. 
Without Zarya, Unity would be a useless, empty can in orbit. ``I think 
Sunrise is very appropriate and I think Unity is very appropriate 
for the new station because it's a new beginning and we're all bound 
together,'' shuttle commander Robert Cabana said from orbit. Unity 
cost $300 million, Zarya $240 million. The National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration paid for both. NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin 
wondered aloud after Friday's launch whether the astronauts would 
pull everything off. ``We've practiced with robots. We've practiced 
with the shuttle,'' Goldin said. ``But now we're doing the real thing 
with hardware that cost a quarter of a billion dollars. Will we pull 
it off? I'm going to worry every day.''
