A parliamentary commission seeking to impeach Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin decided Monday he was not directly responsible for the collapse 
of the country's military, a news report said. Lawmakers had accused 
Yeltsin of underfunding the armed forces, which don't have the money 
to maintain equipment, modernize technology or properly train soldiers 
because of the country's economic problems. Commission members had 
said throughout the proceedings that they probably would not be able 
to prove that Yeltsin purposely sought to destroy the military, and 
as a result, his role in its collapse would not constitute an impeachable 
offense. Meanwhile, Yeltsin, who has been hospitalized with pneumonia 
over the last two weeks, surfaced briefly at the Kremlin on Monday 
to fire his chief of staff and other aides. He then returned to the 
hospital. The commission, which is drawing up articles of impeachment, 
has already said Yeltsin committed three impeachable offenses: instigating 
the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, illegally sending troops and 
tanks against his foes in the previous parliament in 1993, and launching 
the unsuccessful war in separatist Chechnya. Any impeachment motion 
is unlikely to remove Yeltsin. It would need a two-thirds majority 
in the upper and lower houses of parliament, as well as approval by 
the pro-Yeltsin Constitutional and Supreme Courts. The impeachment 
commission will meet in mid-December to discuss the fifth and final 
impeachment article, which accuses Yeltsin of genocide, the ITAR-Tass 
news agency said. The commission will try to determine whether Yeltsin 
was responsible for a deterioration in Russia's living standards since 
the Soviet Union fell that includes a greater incidence of disease 
and a lower birth-rate and life expectancy, Commission Chairman Vadim 
Filimonov told ITAR-Tass.
