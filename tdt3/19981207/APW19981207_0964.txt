He compressed car wrecks, blue jeans, vegetable crates - even fake 
Cartier watches - and turned them into art prized by museums and collectors 
worldwide. Cesar Baldaccini, the immigrant son of a cleaning lady 
who became one of France's leading contemporary sculptors died Sunday 
of cancer at his Paris home. Cesar, as he was known, was famous for 
giving the French cinema stars the coveted golden statue of excellence, 
the U.S. equivalent of the Oscar. The award, first given in 1976, 
is called the Cesar. A high-profile bon vivant on the Paris celebrity 
scene, Cesar was best-known for squashing, expanding and molding the 
discarded scraps of 20th century life. ``Cesar has incarnated sculpture 
at its highest level since the late 1950s,'' Culture Minister Catherine 
Trautmann said. His art, she said, oogave us a new definition of modernity.'' 
President Jacques Chirac praised Cesar's ``strength, capacity for 
renewal and force of his creative ideas.'' Despite the official accolades, 
Cesar was sometimes snubbed by the art establishment which had criticized 
him in recent years for selling out to commercial interest. His famed 
``Thumb'' - a reproduction of his own thumb and finger prints - today 
is available in every size for every budget. One version at La Defense 
corporate park outside Paris is 12 meters high (about 40 feet). ``The 
French estabishment always has trouble with commercial success,'' 
said art critic Ann Cremin. ``Cesar was a life force. Where ever he 
was there was a buzz. People gravitated to him, yet he refused to 
take himself seriously.'' Cremin recalled how Cesar once agreed to 
compact the wreckage of a friend after a serious accident. The friend 
now displays the sculpture of the near-miss in his Paris living room. 
``He's France's Andy Warhol,'' she said. Born Jan. 1, 1921 in Marseille, 
the son of Italian immigrants, Cesar earned pocket money making sausage 
for the family butcher. He quit school at 12, but went on to study 
art in Marseille and Paris. Too poor to afford clay, Cesar would rummage 
through city dumps for scrap metal to recyle into art. A member of 
the New Realism movement, Cesar ``sculpted'' other objects by striking 
them with a sledgehammer: bicycles, vegetable crates, coffee pots. 
He once compacted thousands of fake Cartier tank watches seized by 
French customs officials. He also made a giant breast cast from the 
bosom of a dancer at the Crazy Horse cabaret. As Cesar himself put 
it: ``I'm not an intellectual. I like to touch. It's my hands that 
make my head work.'' The funeral was scheduled for Thursday in Paris 
at the Saint-Germain-des-Pres Church to be followed by burial at the 
Montparnasse cemetery.
