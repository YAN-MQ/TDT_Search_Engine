Mark McGwire's historic 70th home run ball will be put up for bidding 
early next month by Guernsey's, an auction house in New York. The 
ball was hit into the stands in St. Louis by McGwire on Sept. 27, 
the final day of a regular season in which McGwire, with 70, and Sammy 
Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, with 66, both broke Roger Maris' record 
of 61 homers, hit in 1961. Guernsey's will also auction the available 
balls for home runs 61 through 69 hit by McGwire and Sosa. McGwire's 
70th was retrieved by Philip Ozersky, a 26-year-old scientist at the 
medical school at Washington University of St. Louis ``They know how 
to pull off an auction of this size,'' Michael Freedland, the Fort 
Lauderdale attorney who represents Ozersky, said Monday of Guernsey's. 
``And they're going to do an online auction simultaneously.'' After 
more than two months of sifting through offers, Ozersky decided to 
opt for the auction rather than accept other offers. Three collectors, 
represented by St. Louis attorney Alan Cohen, offered $1 million for 
the ball. If the ball does not attract a minimum price at auction 
_ which Freedland declined to divulge _ Ozersky can retain rights 
to it. But it appears as if $1 million is the threshold for a winning 
bid. Freedland estimates Ozersky has received more than 500 inquiries 
about the ball. The ball has been sitting in the St. Louis Cardinals' 
Hall of Fame for about two months, and was marked with synthetic DNA 
to make it certifiably identifiable. Sosa is scheduled to be at a 
news conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Tuesday to announce 
the availability of the home run balls and to confirm his intention 
to sign his most important ones.
