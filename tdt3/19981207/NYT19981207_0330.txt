It is holiday party time, but that needn't mean sequins or Lurex. 
Maybe a touch of gilded makeup, suggests Jose Parron, makeup director 
of Barneys New York. ``Today's makeup can result in a subtle sheen, 
a slight frost or a heavy glitter, depending on your style and courage,'' 
he said. The products he recommends include Illuminating Powder Foundation 
by Stila ($42); Copacabana Multiples Stick by Nars for face, lip or 
eye ($32); Makeup Forever Star Powder for a definite shine ($17), 
and Flin Flon Lipgloss by Cargo, which is half pink and half gold 
($15). Neiman Marcus has Estee Lauder's 24-Karat Gold collection, 
including glitter powder ($26) and gold eye shadow ($12.50), mascara 
($9) and gloss ($13.50). Chanel's gold cosmetics at Neiman Marcus 
include Lame nail polish ($15.50), Red Lame lipstick ($22.50) and 
gold eye shadow ($25).
