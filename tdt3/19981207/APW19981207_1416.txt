In the latest and clearest sign of serious trouble in the far-right 
National Front, one of party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen's loyalists 
openly defied him on Monday _ and was immediately fired. The episode, 
along with a second firing of a Front member who spoke out against 
Le Pen, provided further evidence that the flamboyant leader is losing 
his grip on the party he has led for a quarter-century. It came after 
a tempestuous weekend in which the rivalry between Le Pen and longtime 
lieutenant Bruno Megret burst suddenly and perhaps irrevocably onto 
the surface. The National Front is virulently anti-immigrant, and 
has been widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism. For 27 years, 
Le Pen has been the movement's absolute leader. But his increasingly 
public clashes with the quieter, more pragmatic Megret have deeply 
divided the party. On Monday, moments after a news conference in which 
a longtime Le Pen loyalist, Serge Martinez, harshly criticized recent 
actions by Le Pen, the party leader issued a terse statement. Serge 
Martinez is ``removed from all his political and administrative functions 
with the National Front,'' it said. He also fired Pierre Vial, another 
member of the party's political bureau who had questioned Le Pen's 
recent actions. Martinez, until late Monday the Front's head of personnel 
and a member of its 43-member political bureau, had announced at his 
news conference: ``The unity of our movement is gravely threatened.'' 
Without taking Megret's side, Martinez denounced what he called the 
``purges'' being led by Le Pen, with his ``anything-but-Megret'' attitude. 
He called for an urgent congress of all the party's 50,000 or so members. 
``We must protect the National Front from the explosion that threatens 
it,'' he said. He refused to say whether that meant calling Le Pen's 
leadership into question _ although that was the clear implication. 
The worst moment, Martinez said Monday, came last week when, as personnel 
director, he was forced to fire two Megret loyalists, ostensibly for 
economic reasons. Le Pen ``can no longer count on me for that kind 
of task,'' Martinez said. Le Pen and Megret first clashed publicly 
over Megret's strategy of making alliances with the traditional right. 
Things got uglier this summer when Le Pen, threatened with a legal 
ban on running for office, proposed that his wife _ not Megret _ replace 
him at the top of the party list for upcoming European Parliament 
elections. On Saturday, at a noisy party meeting, Le Pen ejected two 
of Megret's backers: Hubert Fayard and Nathalie Debaille, the same 
two who'd been fired a few days earlier. On Sunday night, he blamed 
the problems on ``a few people from an extremist and even racist minority.'' 
If Megret ``thinks my position represents a sort of betrayal,'' Le 
Pen continued, ``I think he has no business in the movement I preside 
over.''
