Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has survived a challenge 
in parliament to his government. A vote calling for early elections 
is being postponed following a compromised deal reached with one of 
Mr. Netanyahu's coalition partners. Meanwhile, there have been more 
clashes in the West Bank during demonstrations calling for the release 
of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
