Representatives of the International Monetary Fund resumed talks with 
the Belarusian government Monday on a dlrs 100 million emergency compensation 
loan. The IMF had previously agreed to offer the loan if Belarus fulfilled 
its recommendations for economic liberalization. The latest talks 
are to discuss what the government is doing to implement those plans, 
according to Yulia Lyskova, an IMF aide in Belarus. She said the talks 
were expected to last all week.
