Like your scotch neat? On the rocks? Pretension, be gone. A new campaign 
portrays it as way cool. A brand perceived as stolid, even stodgy, 
has hired an upstart agency for an infusion of what is hoped will 
be a hipper, more irreverent attitude. Gyro Worldwide in Philadelphia 
has become the agency in the United States for the Glenfiddich brand 
of single-malt Scotch whisky, distilled and sold by the British company 
William Grant &AMP; Sons Ltd. The assignment for the rest of the world 
remains at McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, part 
of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic Group of Cos. 
A campaign that was created by McCann, calling Glenfiddich ``the Friday 
Scotch,'' ran ``for about three years and delivered some solid numbers,'' 
said Mark Teasdale, senior vice president and marketing director at 
the American unit of Grant, William Grant &AMP; Sons Inc. in Edison, 
N.J. ``It moved the needle for us, but a little slower than we liked,'' 
he said. ``So we decided to be a little more aggressive'' and talked 
to several ``small, independent shops'' before choosing Gyro. The 
assignment is indicative of a trend whereby several large marketers 
have awarded parts of their accounts to smaller agencies with creative 
reputations while maintaining ties with the behemoth shops on their 
rosters. Among those marketers are Anheuser-Busch, Kellogg, Philip 
Morris, Sony, Texaco and Unilever. Gyro is known for provocative campaigns 
aimed at consumers in their 20s and 30s for such products as clothing, 
alcoholic beverages and cigarettes. Critics have complained that the 
agency courts controversy to gain attention for its work; an ad it 
created for a clothing retailer, Zipper Head, for example, showed 
Charles Manson with the headline ``Everyone has the occasional urge 
to go wild and do something completely outrageous.'' One current Gyro 
campaign is for the Red Kamel cigarette brand sold by R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings. The ads, in the ``retro 
chic'' vein, present such implausible images of World War II as an 
all-women rifle corps clad in khaki skirts and shorts. ``It comes 
down to a fresh perspective, a different attitude than what a more 
traditional ad agency would come up with,'' declared Steven Grasse, 
chief executive at Gyro. Gyro came to mind for the Glenfiddich assignment, 
Grasse said, because Teasdale had dealt with the agency while working 
for another liquor marketer, Paddington Corp. In looking at advertising 
in the scotch category, Grasse said, ``We've always laughed at its 
pretentiousness, which didn't appeal to the kinds of consumers we 
now see drinking scotch, people in their late 20s and early 30s. ``They 
weren't drinking it to be pretentious,'' he added. ``They were drinking 
it as if it were a more sophisticated microbrew.'' So, Gyro developed 
ads for Glenfiddich, the nation's No. 2 single malt behind Glenlivet, 
that are meant to ``be straightforward and tell it like it is,'' Grasse 
said, focusing on such elements as Glenfiddich's 111-year heritage 
and its family ownership. In Gyro-speak, those elements are conveyed 
with headlines like ``Made the same damn way since 1887,'' ``One hundred 
eleven years of obstinacy equals integrity,'' ``Some families hug. 
We make Scotch'' and ``For the year 2000, we are proud to announce 
not a single damn thing.'' To further communicate the intended no-nonsense 
attitude, the ads are in a minimalist style, showing only the Glenfiddich 
bottle and stag logo. In adopting what Teasdale described as ``a harder-edged 
attitude of obstinacy and stubbornness'' for the Glenfiddich brand 
image, ``we're fully aware,'' he said, ``that it's a fairly new approach 
for a staid category like single-malt scotch'' as well as ``a little 
bit of a double-edged sword in terms of maybe putting off some of 
our current customers.'' ``But getting new customers outweighed the 
risk,'' he added. ``We feel confident it's the right way to go.'' 
Grant will spend $6 million on the campaign, Teasdale said, in magazines 
with ``a younger skew than we had with `the Friday Scotch.''' So such 
publications as Details, ESPN Magazine, George, Icon, Out, P.O.V. 
and Wired were added to the media plan, he said, while ``a lot of 
the general business books'' such as Business Week were subtracted.
