Police have detained at least 1,000 suspected illegal aliens since 
a countrywide crackdown began in November, a police spokesman said 
Monday. King'ori Mwangi said the latest swoop Saturday at a Nairobi 
shopping center netted more than 40 people. ``We are rounding up all 
aliens without proper documents to be in the country,'' Mwangi said. 
Members of Kenya's Indian community _ known locally as Asians _ claim 
the police action is only targeting Asians in order to extort money 
from them. ``We are not specifically targeting Asians in this case. 
We knew where they (the illegal aliens) were,'' Mwangi said. ``We 
have arrested people of all races _ black, European and Asian,'' he 
said. Since 1994 between 40,000 and 50,000 unskilled or semi-skilled 
workers from the Indian region of Gujarat and from Pakistan have found 
their way into Nairobi and several towns in central Kenya, according 
to the independent Daily Nation newspaper. The paper said immigration 
records show that fewer than 1,000 work permits are issued every year 
while evidence on the ground shows that dozens of people from India 
and Pakistan are entering the job market every day. The newspaper 
said criminal syndicates lure would-be immigrants with promises of 
good jobs in Kenya where unemployment is estimated to be as high as 
50 percent of the working age population. The syndicates reportedly 
bribe Kenyan immigration officials to issue false work and residence 
permits. Mwangi said the crackdown will go on until all illegal aliens 
are netted. ``If they are refugees, they should remain in the camps. 
If they want to work here, there is a process, not just sneaking in,'' 
Mwangi said. He said most of the illegal aliens have been taken to 
court. If they are convicted of being in the country illegally, they 
must serve their prison sentences and then be deported. ``Some of 
these aliens are known to be drug runners,'' Mwangi said, ``We cannot 
compromise our security.''
