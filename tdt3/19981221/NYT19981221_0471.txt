Former Sen. George Mitchell will be named Tuesday to head an investigation 
by the U.S. Olympic Committee into allegations that Salt Lake City 
bribed its way into becoming host of the 2002 Winter Games, according 
to an Olympic official familiar with the appointment. Mitchell, the 
former Democratic senator from Maine who brokered the Irish peace 
talks earlier this year and who has been mentioned as a possible mediator 
in President Clinton's attempt to avoid removal from office, is chairman 
of the USOC's ethics committee. The USOC has grown concerned over 
public and corporate confidence in the 2002 Winter Games following 
allegations of vote-buying made by Marc Hodler, a senior IOC member 
from Switzerland. The USOC is also looking ahead, and wants to make 
certain that the American cities intending to bid on the 2012 Summer 
Games comply with IOC bidding rules. The IOC and a Salt Lake ethics 
panel are also investigating the scandal. Juan Antonio Samaranch, 
president of the International Olympic Committee, told a Swiss newspaper 
Monday that IOC members would be banned from visiting cities bidding 
to be hosts of the Olympics. The visits involve lavish wining and 
dining and gift-giving and have long been rumored to be vulnerable 
to corruption. ``I can tell you that the trips of IOC members to candidate 
cities, these are terminated,'' Samaranch told the Swiss newspaper 
Le Matin. It was unclear whether Samaranch meant that visits would 
be stopped only while the Salt Lake mess is sorted out, or whether 
they would be stopped permanently. In February, IOC members are scheduled 
for visits to cities bidding to be host for the 2006 Winter Games. 
A vote will take place next year. In light of the Salt Lake scandal, 
there is a move in the IOC to limit either visits or voting on host 
cities to a smaller group of members, perhaps the executive committee. 
Robert Helmick, who resigned as an IOC member and as president of 
the USOC over conflict-of-interest charges in 1991, said Monday that 
a small group of IOC members was willing to sell votes for extravagant 
gifts and favors, such as fur coats, shopping sprees and $5,000 to 
$10,000 in free first-class air fare that members and spouses receive 
to visit bid cities. Salt Lake officials have acknowledged spending 
$400,000 on a program of scholarships and athletic training for 13 
people, including six relatives of IOC members, most from Africa. 
However, the officials have characterized the spending as humanitarian 
aid, not bribery. Tom Welch, who headed the Salt Lake bid committee 
and later became president of its Olympic organizing committee, acknowledged 
in an interview last week that such lavish gifts as shotguns and skis 
had been given to visiting IOC members.
