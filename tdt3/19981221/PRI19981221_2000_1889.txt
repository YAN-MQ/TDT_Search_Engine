Presidents Ford and Carter have weighed in behind an embattled Bill 
Clinton. Writing in the New York Times, the two rivals say impeachment 
proceedings are deeply dividing the country. They're calling instead 
for a motion to punish Mr. Clinton for his wrongdoings. Jesse Jackson 
says impeachment would have grave consequences for the Republicans. 
It will now go to the Senate, and Clinton will prevail in that Senate. 
But more than that, the American people will prevail. And this right-wing 
group of mean-spirited people will pay a very high price for defying 
the will of the American public. Jesse Jackson.
