Patrick Ewing's day began in a midtown hotel, dispelling any notion 
of a rift within the players union. By nightfall, he was standing 
on a street in Harlem signing autographs for children. Trying to mend 
perceptions borne out of the NBA lockout, Ewing, sitting side by side 
with the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and a dozen players 
from the union's negotiating team, fielded questions from among 100 
players on a conference call. Inside the room, the committee pondered 
comments from Karl Malone that appeared to indicate a break among 
the players. On Saturday, Malone, the Utah Jazz forward, said he believed 
that the owners' offer was a fair deal that needed some adjustments. 
Minutes after Monday's meeting broke up, Ewing, the union's president, 
made it clear that one man's opinion did not indicate a division in 
the group. ``We don't agree with him,'' Ewing said. ``I don't know 
where it came from. This is the proposal that has been out there a 
long time, and it hasn't changed. On paper, it looks OK, but not when 
it's dissected. Everybody in there was disappointed because we've 
been on the same page for so long. And Karl's been with us the whole 
way. But there's no divide. I can tell you, we're together.'' Unity 
has sustained the union through every emotional up and down in the 
nearly 6-month-old lockout. Each hint of progress has been followed 
by a sustained silence between the two parties. With no new meetings 
scheduled, NBA Commissioner David Stern departed for his vacation 
in Aspen, Col., on Saturday, and Hunter said he intended to fly Tuesday 
to Oakland, Calif., for the holidays. Officials from both sides don't 
expect any contact between Hunter and Stern before Christmas, leaving 
early next week as the next plausible date for a bargaining session. 
That would give the two sides a small cushion of time to come up with 
an agreement and start a season of approximately 50 games by the first 
week of February. ``I'm sure that before this thing goes completely 
up in smoke, they would be inclined to have one more session,'' Hunter 
said. ``When and how that will occur is yet to be determined. ``I 
don't know what their motive or strategy is. I've told the guys all 
along that we can't be concerned with what their motives are. We know 
what our position is and what our bottom line is, and we intend to 
stay with it. Absent some compromise from the NBA, there will be no 
deal.'' Stern did not leave town with compromise on his mind. Instead, 
he reportedly said the season would inevitably be canceled if the 
negotiations continue on their same path. ``If the intent of his comment 
was to increase or turn up the anxiety, it hasn't happened,'' Hunter 
said. ``It's just another demonstration of where they've underestimated 
our guys.'' Ewing echoed those thoughts as he darted for a waiting 
car to take him uptown to the Harlem Dowling-West Side Center. He 
arrived to play Santa Claus to more than 100 children from the community 
with his Knicks teammates Herb Williams, John Starks and Marcus Camby, 
and Seattle's Jim McIlvaine, who tagged along from the union's meeting. 
The event was Ewing's brainchild. Over the weekend, Ewing took up 
a collection from a group of players and called a toy store. He placed 
an order for 150 gifts, and then, with the help of his teammates, 
handed them out to kids ages 2 through 17. One girl screamed in excitement 
when Ewing cupped her head. And another boy was giggling with the 
always kid-friendly Starks. For the most part, the kids were oblivious 
to the lockout, although one astute 9-year-old girl, Tiara, did say 
to her friend, ``They should be playing right now, and they're not 
because of all the money stuff.'' That stuff has often seemed at the 
root of the alienation the public has felt toward the players during 
the lockout. At times, players have appeared removed from the average 
person because of comments that have left them perceived to be greedy 
and out of touch. ``I think it means a lot to the kids for us to be 
here,'' Starks said. ``Some people think the guys are selfish and 
only think about themselves. But the majority of the league comes 
from poor backgrounds, and so we know what it's like not to have.'' 
Many of the kids standing before the players were children being aided 
by the center's family services. It was hard to find a child who was 
not touched by the attention the players gave them Monday. Even after 
all the presents had been handed out, Ewing, not one to normally linger 
after an event, stood next to his car and signed all autograph requests. 
He ended his day much like he had started it, as a mender of perceptions. 
``We just wanted to show that we have the Christmas spirit,'' Ewing 
said. ``This is all about giving.''
