Russia's defense minister said Monday that the former Soviet republics 
should cooperate more closely to deal with common political and military 
challenges, a news report said. Igor Sergeyev cited the ``unpredictable'' 
policies of United States _ a reference to recent American air strikes 
against Iraq _ as a reason for greater unity among the ex-Soviet republics. 
Russia was a staunch opponent of the attacks against Iraq. Sergeyev 
made his remarks as he opened a meeting of defense ministers from 
the Commonwealth of Independent States, a grouping of 12 former republics. 
The countries already work together on some military issues, and Russian 
troops are currently in three former republics where they help maintain 
the peace _ Moldova, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Sergeyev noted that 
the 12 nations have signed some 270 defense-related agreements since 
the commonwealth was formed in the wake of the 1991 Soviet breakup. 
However, the countries also have differences. Some have been active 
participants in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, such as Ukraine. 
Meanwhile, Russia and Belarus are adamantly opposed to NATO's moves 
to expand into eastern Europe. All of the commonwealth nations have 
struggling economies and military leaders regularly complain about 
funding shortages.
