For today's musical finale, we bring you a Spanish language singer, 
Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll. If her name is too long for your tastes, 
don't fret. She has made it user-friendly. You can just call her Shakira. 
Shakira is from Colombia and is a regular visitor to the top of the 
charts in her home country, as well as in Mexico and Venezuela and 
is a frequent chart topper on America's Latin music list, too. Even 
Portuguese-speaking Brazilians have snatched up more than 700,000 
copies of Shakira's latest, "Donde Estan Los Ladrones?" or "Where 
Are The Bees?"
