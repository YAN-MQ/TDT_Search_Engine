Church and government are pitted against each other in Germany over 
controversial plans to allow the sale of the abortion pill. Jonathan 
Charles reports from Frankfurt. The RU-486 abortion pill has always 
been controversial. It was introduced in France a decade ago. But 
since then, only Sweden and Britain have allowed its sale. Now the 
new center-left German government is indicating it won't block the 
licensing of the pill, enabling its prescription in Germany for the 
first time. Germany's chancellor Gerhard Schroeder says it will give 
women an alternative to surgical abortion. But the head of the Bishop's 
conference, Karl Lehman, says that playing down abortion by portraying 
the pill as a more gentle method is unacceptable. Jonathan Charles, 
BBC, Frankfurt.
