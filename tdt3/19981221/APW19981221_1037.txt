The speaker of Sudan's Parliament formally submitted his resignation 
to lawmakers Monday. The move was part of a political shuffle that 
is not expected to reduce his role as the most influential person 
in the government. Hassan Turabi's resignation must now be approved 
by President Omar el-Bashir, which is considered a formality. ``I 
am announcing to you my resignation as speaker of Parliament. I will 
remain amongst you as a member, leaving this seat for someone else,'' 
Turabi said in a speech in the National Assembly. Egypt's Middle East 
News Agency said the 400-seat National Assembly accepted the resignation. 
But the official Sudan News Agency later said a group of lawmakers 
decided to renominate Turabi on Tuesday when a new speaker is expected 
to be elected. Turabi had announced his resignation on Dec. 2 to work 
full time for the governing National Congress party, whose monopoly 
on politics ends on Jan. 1 The Political Associations Law, passed 
on Dec. 9, allows the formation of political groups that may contest 
elections. El-Bashir, who banned all political parties after seizing 
power in a 1989 military coup, said recently that the door was open 
for opposition figures in exile to come back and form political associations. 
But the presence of the hard-line Turabi at the head of Parliament 
had cast doubts on the government's willingness to allow the opposition 
to flourish. Political analysts interpreted Turabi's resignation as 
a government attempt to ease those fears. However, there is still 
some apprehension because the new law only speaks of ``political associations.'' 
Turabi opposed some Parliament members' demand for a clear-cut reference 
to ``political parties.''
