Now that the impeachment matter has moved beyond the house, some lawmakers' 
attitudes seem to be changing on the subject of censure. As Bob Franken 
reports, in the Senate, it may have a better chance of survival. There 
seems to be a bipartisan consensus that any plea bargain censure deal 
will have to wait a little while. There should be a cooling-off period. 
It should be the holidays is a time for reflection, and then let's 
get back to work. I think there will be a trial. But just when is 
that? In today's vernacular, that depends on what the word "trial" 
means. Most argue it technically begins once chief justice William 
rehnquist is sworn in to preside on January 7th. But weeks could pass 
before the actual testimony and arguments start. It's during that 
waiting period when most feel a bipartisan censure deal could emerge 
-- "bipartisan" being the operative word. The most important thing 
for us in the Senate is that we not allow to have happen in our institution 
what I think has happened in the others, and that is this become a 
sort of a food fight, a partisan food fight. This is the court of 
last resort. There have been reports that two key democratic senators, 
Robert byrd and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, might be obstacles to any 
censure arrangement. Both are known for their strict interpretations 
of the constitution. But a source in Byrd's office says he has specifically 
told his staff, "Censure is not unconstitutional. It has no constitutional 
basis, but censure is a constitutional possibility." Moynihan's view 
on censure was similar, said a top aide. Once the trial begins, Senate 
rules permit a vote at any time to terminate it, requiring only a 
simple majority. It's very possible that the trial might be terminated 
before it was completed. That's certainly within the Senate rules, 
but under the constitution, I think we have to proceed with a trial. 
Sources tell CNN that even as the White House prepares its legal defense, 
quiet, back-channel efforts are well under way to prepare a Censure 
package that would be acceptable to the president, while painful enough 
that the Senate could Muster enough votes for passage. Bob Franken,
