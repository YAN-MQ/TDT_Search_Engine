The 5,452-meter (3,387-mile) Popocatepetl volcano erupted with a spew 
of ash that fell on parts of Mexico City and briefly forced closure 
of the Mexican capital's airport, 75 kms (45 miles) to the northeast, 
on Monday. The ash eruption began at about 10:10 p.m. on Sunday and 
the volcano returned to ``relatively low levels of activity'' by midnight, 
according to the National Center for the Prevention of Disasters, 
which monitors Popocatepetl. A wind toward the northwest caused a 
light ash fall on the densely populated Xochimilco and Ixtapalapa 
districts of southeastern Mexico City and forced the city's airport 
to halt operations from 11:30 p.m. to 1:15 a.m., according to the 
disaster center. Three nights earlier, the volcano spewed red-hot 
rocks, setting off brushfires on its slopes. Popocatepetl has been 
spitting vapor, ash and rock intermittently since December 1994, after 
lying largely dormant since 1927. Some 300,000 people live on its 
slopes and tens of millions live within view of it.
