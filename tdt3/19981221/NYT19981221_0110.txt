As holiday shoppers clogged the thoroughfares last week, clutching 
glossy bags emblazoned with status names, one 59-year-old lawyer confided 
her innermost feeling: guilt. ``I had a great year,'' said the woman, 
who worried that if she gave her name, her clients would think they 
had paid her too much. ``In past years, I always went to Toys ``R'' 
Us and bought my grandson some cheap thing. This year, I'm heading 
to F.A.O. Schwarz and buying him one of those expensive motorized 
Legos. I don't care how much it costs. And my daughter-in-law. She 
asked for a Polartec robe. Well, I'm getting her cashmere! Then I'm 
going to Tiffany's and buy my son Limoges.'' How does she sound to 
you? Normal? Stressed? Over the edge? It all depends on who's sizing 
up the situation. Psychiatrists who specialize in ``shopping disorders'' 
might say she's at risk. A shopping disorder? That's when people spend 
more than they should, for reasons they shouldn't. They are not the 
regular stripe of holiday shoppers caught up in the wretched excesses 
of the season. These problem consumers are engaged in compulsive shopping, 
competitive shopping and revenge shopping (spending a loved one's 
money to exact punishment, which may be seen as an indication of caring). 
Doctors say these feelings, which reflect deeper psychological disturbances, 
may intensify around Christmas, when people are inundated with subtle 
and not-so-subtle messages to spend. ``The holidays are particularly 
difficult for some patients because these ritualistic events resonate 
with memories of festive and happy times,'' explained Dr. David Krueger, 
a Houston psychiatrist who wrote a book called ``Emotional Business: 
The Meanings of Work, Money and Success'' (Slawson Communications, 
1992), which focuses on the way people handle money. Some people shop 
to compensate for feelings of intense loneliness, Krueger said. ``Shopping 
becomes a proxy,'' he said, but the the thrill doesn't last that long. 
``It's like treating appendicitis with morphine. It doesn't resolve 
the conflict.'' Dr. David Belgray, the director of the Jewish Association 
for Counseling and Psychotherapy in New York City, says patients seek 
him out when ``they're to the point where they're in pain _ and the 
charge cards are up to their limits.'' ``Some people want to get the 
most, give the most, get the biggest present, give the biggest present,'' 
said Dr. Gail Saltz, a clinical instructor in psychiatry at New York 
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. ``It's natural to want 
to say: `I love you. You love me. Here's something special I picked 
out for you.' ``It's when you get carried away,'' she said. ``Then 
a lot of resentment can build up. You've spent too much. And in your 
mind, the people you gave the holiday presents to didn't pay you back 
emotionally.'' So how does anyone know if a loved one is a compulsive 
holiday shopper, heading straight for a new year full of anger, resentment 
and remorse? Krueger gives his patients a self-help quiz: _ ``Do you 
go shopping to escape feeling bored, empty, angry or scared?'' _ ``Do 
you use shopping or spending in a way that creates conflicts for you, 
or between you and others?'' _ ``Do you buy things with your credit 
cards that you wouldn't buy if you had the cash?'' _ ``When you shop 
or make a purchase, does your mood change _ do you feel euphoric or 
anxious?'' (If the answer is yes to any of the questions, he writes, 
patients could be using shopping as a way to regulate their self-esteem. 
Not good.) Another hint from Krueger: If a shopper starts to feel 
that her favorite salesclerk is her only friend, she might also be 
in real trouble. Another psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Sehl, the director 
of the Psychology Information Center in New York City, said a danger 
signal was ``somebody bragging about how much they've spent and then 
asking aloud: `Why did I buy that?''' Out of control? Sometimes it 
may not be your fault. ``The mother comes in to complain about her 
grown son, who's been running her credit cards up to the limit,'' 
Belgray said. ``It's our job to separate who's the adult. Why does 
the adult child have use of the parents' credit cards?'' For those 
who simply want to curb their spending, Sehl recommends that they 
pay attention to their mood when buying for themselves or others. 
``Check the impulse. Write it down on a piece of paper after you either 
buy or don't buy. If you're not in therapy, it could be therapeutic.'' 
Then again, if you bought a gift for all the wrong reasons, there 
is another solution. You can always return it. What about the lawyer 
who felt so bad about years of being cheap? ``She's trying to atone,'' 
said Sehl, who said he would need to see if her spending patterns 
repeated. ``If she only does it one year, she actually can atone. 
But if she keeps depriving, atoning, depriving, atoning, then she 
probably has a problem.''
