In Iraq today, the Deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, ridiculed the 
U.S. military. After four days of bombing, "A policy of hatred" he 
called it, Aziz said the U.S. had failed to seriously harm either 
the government or the military. For the most part, it's virtually 
inevitable that the U.S. and Iraq will reach different conclusions 
about all these raids. But in measuring success, as of tonight, there 
is a measure of agreement. ABC's John McWethy reports from the Pentagon. 
The U.S. claims to have hit 85% of its targets, making this one of 
the most accurate air campaigns ever conducted. But military officials 
concede that many of the buildings that were hit were empty -- equipment, 
troops and political leaders were gone. You might look at something 
like this, and one of our analysts would say this is moderate to light 
damage. But I guarantee you, nobody is working this morning in ba'ath 
party headquarters. Some of the most intense attacks were aimed at 
Iraq's ballistic missile program. We estimate that we delayed Iraq's 
development of ballistic missiles by at least a year. But a U.S. intelligence 
report obtained by ABC News said "most critical equipment" from inside 
the missile plants had been moved and Iraqi technicians that build 
the missiles were at home in bed. As for Saddam Hussein's weapons 
of mass destruction, the U.S. did not target facilities that could 
be converted quickly to mass-produce such weapons, including pharmaceutical 
and food processing plants, or breweries. These say Pentagon officials 
were not hit for fear thousands of civilians would be killed by plumes 
of poison gas or deadly viruses that might have been stored there. 
Many believe the job of containing Iraq is far from finished, raising 
tough questions for the future. Will the U.S. have to bomb again and 
under what circumstances? Will even more American troops have to be 
permanently stationed in 9 gulf and at what cost? Finally, can the 
U.S. hold the line on economic sanctions even though sympathy for 
Iraq, even among America's allies seems to be growing. John McWethy, 
ABC News, the Pentagon.
