The last bombs have fallen and reports say the attack on Iraq was 
a Success. But as Karl ro sell reports the final impact of "operation 
desert fox" may not be felt for quite some time. The Pentagon is continuing 
to assess the damage done during its four-day attack on Iraq. Planners 
are using images such as these, a B-1 bomber dropping 500 pound bombs 
on a republican guard barracks, and F-16s, dropping laser-guided bombs 
on storage, buildings, radar facilities and a republican guard barracks. 
Our success goes up almost daily, as we have a chance to make a more 
complete assessment. For example, we hit nine of his R & D missile 
facilities. We don't think he'll be doing any more research and development 
with his missiles for at least over a year. But questions about the 
success are already coming from Capitol Hill. We need a long-term 
policy to replace Saddam Hussein. That's what is missing. Perhaps 
in some people's eyes, he'll be stronger. We hope he'll be weaker 
because of this, but if we just do 70 hours of bombing and nothing 
else, he will get stronger. U.S. carriers and military personnel remain 
in the region. A reminder deference secretary Cohen says Saddam Hussein 
needs to open up to the U.N. weapons inspectors or face the consequences. 
He has a choice. He can allow UNSCOM inspectors back in or else he's 
going to continue to face the imposition of San shuns. So the sanctions 
aren't going away. The forces aren't going away. We're going to continue 
our containment policy. Forces remain on sand by but military sources 
say there may be a Slowdown in the personnel and hardware heading 
to the Persian gulf region now that "operation desert fox" is over.
