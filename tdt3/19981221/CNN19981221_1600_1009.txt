The international monetary fund sees a slowdown in the U.S. economy 
next year. I'm Jan Hopkins in New York with this edition of "Dollars 
& Sense." The IMF predicts that the U.S. economy will expand only 
by 1.8% next year. That's half the growth rate of this year, 3.6%. 
the IMF says the U.S. economy may also face additional risks from 
a potential drop in stock prices. The IMF painted an overwhelmingly 
pessimistic outlook for Russia, saying that economy is headed for 
free fall in 1999. And in Asia, IMF officials say that Thailand should 
emerge from recession next year, but south Korea and Malaysia will 
continue to battle falling output.
