The Dow Jones Industrials ended up 85 points today at 8989. The NASDAQ 
picked up 52 points on the day to close at 2138. An escalating trade 
dispute between the United States and Europe has its roots in an argument 
over bananas. In fact, you could call it a banana split if you're 
as shameless as my editor, which presumably you are not. In any event, 
the United States, in response to the European Union's tariffs on 
Caribbean bananas, is imposing stiff tariffs on a variety of European 
products. Liz George reports from our business desk in New York. It's 
tit for tat. The U.S. trade representative Charlene Barshefsky is 
slapping 100 percent tariffs on a list of imports from Europe. The 
items include biscuits, bath preparations, candles, handbags, sweaters, 
bed linens and more. The tariffs could be in place as early as February 
1. Ambassador Barshefsky says she's acting within World Trade Organization 
rules. The banana case is the fourth time that Europe's bananas regime 
has been struck down as contrary to international rules. We would 
prefer, and have always preferred, a settlement of the underlying 
substantive dispute. And we have repeatedly asked the European Commission 
to sit down with us, beginning, indeed, in June 1997, to resolve the 
underlying dispute. We have been persistently rebuffed in that. The 
European Union favors bananas produced in former colonies. But the 
United States believes its policy discriminates against Caribbean 
and Latin American growers, many of which are owned by U.S. companies. 
But despite the sanctions and the war of words, Ms. Barshefsky says 
this won't escalate further. We and Europe have a two-way trade relationship 
in about the $400 billion range. Any relationship of that size is 
bound to generate some friction. Disputes have to be resolved. We 
have won our case against Europe. We have acquired rights by so winning 
that case, and we intend to pursue the rights we have acquired through 
the litigation. But the notion of trade war or the notion that we 
and Europe will somehow not continue to have an extraordinary, productive 
trade relationship is complete nonsense. Meanwhile, the European trade 
commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, said today he deeply regrets the punitive 
duties, which he claims are being imposed unilaterally. And he says 
he's planning to challenge the sanctions at the WTO. For The World, 
I'm Liz George in New York.
