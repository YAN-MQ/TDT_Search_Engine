Indoor water parks, with their fountains, spouts and water slides, 
have grown increasingly popular. But a study that tracked two outbreaks 
of what researchers dubbed ``lifeguard lung'' shows that the spraying 
water that makes such parks fun can pose health complications as well. 
Health officials have long suspected that saunas, hot tubs and indoor 
fountains can be highly effective vehicles for transmitting infections. 
Microbes in the water are far more likely to make their way into human 
lungs when they waft through the air in what are technically referred 
to as aerosolized water droplets. In the case of a Colorado water 
park that was closed twice in two years by outbreaks of lung disease 
among lifeguards, researchers reporting earlier this month in the 
American Journal of Public Health found that chronic exposure to contaminated 
droplets was responsible for a kind of inflammatory lung illness, 
granulomatous pneumotitis, that can cause permanent scarring. In 1986, 
the city of Westminster, north of Denver, opened one of the country's 
first ``natatoriums,'' with three pools, two waterfalls, a water slide, 
fountain and two hot tubs. In the years that followed, a number of 
lifeguards at the facility developed respiratory symptoms, leading 
several to quit. In 1989, four guards were diagnosed with granulomatous 
pneumotitis and the pool was shut. A subsequent survey found that 
at least 27 percent of pool employees had been infected, reporting 
symptoms that included coughs, chest tightness and congestion. Dr. 
Cecile Rose of the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in 
Denver, who led the team that studied the outbreak, said two points 
were particularly worrisome: ``Young, healthy lifeguards were sick,'' 
she said. And tracking work records indicated a direct link between 
time spent at the pool and likelihood of infection. Engineers hired 
by the city said that increasing the flow of fresh air would dilute 
contamination sufficiently, said Bill Walenczack, the current director 
of parks, recreation and libraries, and the pool's ventilation system 
was overhauled at a cost of $600,000. It reopened in May 1990. Within 
three months, however, a second outbreak of lung disease among lifeguards 
was reported, and this time it hit 65 percent _ and the pool was closed 
again. After testing water droplets in the air, the researchers found 
high levels of bacterial cell residues called endotoxins _ 25 times 
higher within the water park than in outdoor air, and far higher than 
at two pools without water spray equipment that were tested. Levels 
were highest from samples taken in the ``crow's nest'' chair where 
lifeguards reported the most chest discomfort. ``They were sitting 
up there for hours and hours, being exposed to water droplets small 
enough to get deep inside the lung,'' Rose said in a telephone interview. 
The pool eventually upgraded parts of its system _ at a cost of $1.2 
million _ and since then there have been no new cases or complaints, 
said Walenczak. Although this is the first time that pools have been 
identified as a source of inflammatory lung infections, Rose warns 
that the growth of water spray features should put pool workers on 
their guard. Less clear is the risk of more occasional exposure. ``We 
don't really know what the risk is to users _ probably much lower, 
if there is any,'' said Rose.
