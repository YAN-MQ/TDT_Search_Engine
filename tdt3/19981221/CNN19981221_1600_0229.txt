Israel's parliament is holding an evening session to consider a measure 
to dissolve the government and hold early elections. That would set 
the stage for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to battle it out with 
political opponents, who oppose concessions made in the wye river 
land-for-security accord. Netanyahu holds a tenuous 61 to 59 majority 
in the Knesset. In order to bolster his position, yesterday, his cabinet 
suspended the hand-over of more West Bank land to the Palestinians 
as outlined in the peace agreement. Palestinian leaders call the move 
a "flagrant violation" and said Israel's internal political matters 
should not be allowed to affect the accord.
