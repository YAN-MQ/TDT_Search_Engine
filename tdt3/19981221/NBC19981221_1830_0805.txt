When we come back, NBC news "in depth." Now there are eight. Have 
the latest advances in making babies gone too far? All through here. 
All you can think about is getting rid of it quickly. I even tried 
Zantac 75, but it didn't work fast enough. Finally, I asked my doctor. 
And my doctor said Mylanta. Fast acting Mylanta was made to work fast... 
where heartburn hurts most, soothing on contact. It's so fast. And 
if you suffer from gas, there's a Mylanta just for you: Mylanta gas. 
I'm so clogged up. I just can't focus. You okay? Get tavi St-D. Just 
one works 12 hours versus four Tylenol cold pills. Tavist-D clears 
your congestion. Be clear-headed, clear through your day with tavist-D. 
A ouncing an amazing discovery. One-A-day has combined the power of 
herbs with vitamins... to help you during the cold season. Support 
your mood, even memory. New from one-A-day. Just what you need... 
to feel your best.
