The White House is gearing up for a trial in the Senate. Perhaps a 
resolution that including a vote on censure, a motion of censure. 
Rumored the house leaders would not allow censure to come to the floor 
as an option. Perhaps, we're looking at this, whether if there has 
to be a trial, what would the length be? What are the elements again 
that we would put together? At this stage, we're 48 hours past the 
vote. We think it's important that we explore every option, that we 
are having positive and respectful conversations with senators who 
have their own suggestions, and that we look to a way to continue 
to move this nation forward.
