New violence is reported in Serbia's Kosovo province as government 
forces shell ethnic Albanian guerrilla positions in the north. The 
operation followed an attack by unidentified gunmen who left a police 
officer dead and a women injured. Meanwhile several hundred Serbs 
demonstrated in Kosovo in protest over the killing of the area's Deputy 
Mayor last week.
