Faced with a choice between a crash landing in the Himalayas or the 
possibility of being forced down by China's armed forces, three balloonists 
seeking to circle the world nonstop pressed on into Chinese airspace 
Monday, hoping for a last-minute change of heart by the Beijing government. 
During the fourth day of their flight, the three-member crew _ Richard 
Branson, Per Lindstrand and Steve Fossett _ encountered the first 
serious check to their rapid progress. Soon after they had committed 
their 160-foot-high balloon to a course taking it over the Himalayas 
from India, the Chinese foreign ministry sent word that the overflight 
permission it had granted the balloonists on Nov. 26 had been withdrawn. 
In a satellite telephone interview Monday while the balloon was over 
Nepal at an altitude of 29,000 feet, Fossett said: ``We're in a real 
jam. We're already over the Himalayas and there's no place to land. 
We have to keep going into China, and once over Chinese territory 
they could order us to land, or might even shoot us down.'' ``We can't 
turn back, we can't land and we can't avoid China,'' Fossett said. 
As Fossett spoke, the balloon was 29,000 feet high and a scant 15 
miles from the Chinese border. Two hours later in the darkness of 
night the balloon crossed into China in a region dominated by the 
highest mountains in the world. In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair 
announced that his government had appealed to China to let the ICO 
Global Challenge pass. Branson (who is the billionaire chairman of 
the Virgin Group) and Lindstrand, chairman of Lindstrand Balloons, 
Ltd., are British subjects. Fossett, a wealthy commodities broker 
and a champion long-distance balloonist, is American. ``Since I'm 
an American, we're also trying to get Washington to appeal to China 
to let us pass,'' Fossett said. ``If we can just get past China there 
are no further political obstacles, and we have enough fuel to complete 
the trip. But right now it's touch and go.'' Since the ICO Global 
Challenge rose from its launching site at Marrakesh, Morocco, on Friday, 
jet-stream winds have whisked it nearly a third of the way around 
the world. But the flight has been anything but relaxing. On Saturday 
the balloonists were forced to fly through a dangerous corridor between 
a line of powerful thunderstorms in southern Turkey and the border 
of hostile Iraq. The balloon also had to carefully thread its way 
around the borders of Iran and Russia, which denied it overflight 
permission. Although a balloon cannot steer, it can rise or descend, 
seeking out winds blowing in the desired direction. For this, a team 
of ground-based meteorologists in London constantly analyzing weather 
data provides the ICO Global Challenge with essential guidance. No 
balloonists have ever come close to circling the earth nonstop, but 
more teams are expected to try in the coming months than ever before. 
Seven teams besides the ICO Global Challenge have announced plans 
to try their luck. Two of them _ Switzerland's Breitling Orbiter 3 
and Britain's Cable &AMP; Wireless Balloon _ are already at their 
launching pads in the Swiss Alps and Spain awaiting favorable weather 
to start. Two others hope to be ready before the season's weather 
opportunity ends in mid February. Three other balloon teams are planning 
attempts from the southern hemisphere next July.
