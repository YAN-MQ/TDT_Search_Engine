Every action has a reaction. The newest men's shirt collars, which 
are wider and longer, demand a chunky knot, so along come beefy neckties 
of wool and cashmere fabrics, many in suiting patterns like herringbone 
and plaid. Allan Flusser makes a blue herringbone cashmere tie ($125) 
and a wool blend tie with diagonal stripes ($120). Ermenegildo Zegna 
has a gray cashmere tie with a green silk grid pattern ($110), and 
Giorgio Armani has solid wool ties in pale or charcoal gray ($131). 
All are at Saks Fifth Avenue. Barneys New York has a textured gray 
cashmere tie ($78) with the store label; Luciano Barbera's cashmere 
plaid ($125) and brown wool ties with diagonal beige stitching ($98); 
Gucci's brown wool with a camel grid ($105), and Drake's tiny chevron 
in wool ($88). For someone in the Christmas spirit, there's a whimsical 
red wool tie with a pattern of tiny deer and trees by Holland &AMP; 
Holland ($98 at Saks).
