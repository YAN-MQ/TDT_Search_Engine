In the fullest military assessment since the bombing of Iraq ended, 
the American commander who led four days of strikes said Monday that 
American and British forces hit 85 percent of their targets and badly 
damaged the Republican Guards. While there were no signs of an uprising 
against President Saddam Hussein in the wake of the attack, as some 
planners had hoped, the commander, Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, 
said the strikes had weakened the Baghdad government, at least temporarily. 
He noted Iraq's decision on the eve of the strikes, which began last 
Wednesday, to divide the country into four military zones. He said 
such a step appeared aimed as much at quashing internal dissent as 
defending the country from American and British missile and air strikes. 
``If I were to make a judgment, I would say that was for internal 
control,'' Zinni said. ``And I would point to that one very open and 
obvious move on his part as maybe an indication he lacks confidence 
in his own ability to continue to ruthlessly rule.'' After he spoke, 
the Pentagon issued its most detailed assessment of the damage. Although 
the first incomplete assessments showed modest success, Monday's data 
showed 43 of 100 targets had been severely damaged or destroyed, while 
30 received moderate damage. Still, 12 targets suffered only light 
damage, and at least 13 suffered none at all. Most of these were surface-to-air 
missile batteries that are easily moved. Zinni said the analysts who 
decide how badly targets are damaged are by necessity conservative 
in their estimates. He also said targets that appeared only slightly 
damaged can in fact suffer greatly. As an example he showed an aerial 
photograph of the headquarters of Saddam's Baath Party. It had holes 
punched in its roof but was otherwise still standing. ``One of our 
analysts would say this is moderate or light damage,'' he said. ``But 
I guarantee you, nobody is working this morning in Baath Party headquarters.'' 
That has not diminished Iraq's invective. Ever since the raids stopped, 
Saddam's deputies have responded with defiance, declaring both a military 
and moral victory and vowing never to resume cooperation with United 
Nations weapons inspections. Monday, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
Aziz said the attacks had very little effect on Iraq's military, killing 
only 62 ``martyrs'' in the entire military and only 38 in the Republican 
Guard units that were a focus of four nights of bombings. There is 
no way to confirm Iraq's assertions on casualties, but Zinni did not 
dispute them. ``We are not in the business of body counting,'' he 
said. He did confirm that the Republican Guards had abandoned their 
barracks and headquarters before the strikes began, presumably tipped 
off that an attack was imminent when the U.N. weapons inspectors withdrew. 
Zinni said the attacks focused on the bases and equipment of four 
Republican Guard divisions and caused significant damage. He also 
emphasized the impact of the destruction of barracks and headquarters 
_ ``pretty tough,'' he said, ``if you're a troop in the field and 
you've got no place to go home to at night.'' Still, the campaign 
underscored the limits of air and missile strikes _ even one that 
proved to be the largest against Iraq since the Gulf War ended in 
1991. The Clinton administration has said the strikes accomplished 
the relatively limited objective of ``degrading'' Iraq's ability to 
threaten its neighbors and to produce nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons, without losing any American or British troops. ``I don't 
know how you measure that as a victory in any way,'' Zinni said. ``I 
think our friends in the region and others clearly look at what happened 
to Iraq and realize that Saddam suffered a defeat.'' But the attack 
has ended what the administration considered the best way to monitor 
Iraq's military activities: the United Nations inspectors. And Saddam 
is as defiant as ever. Finally, the attack has come at a steep cost. 
The United States spent $2 billion last year on its forces in the 
Persian Gulf; this attack will add hundreds of millions more. Zinni 
said it was too early to estimate the cost of the campaign, but each 
of the 400 or so cruise missiles the United States used alone costs 
an average of $1 million.
