Our top news stories of the day coming up next on The World. Don't 
forget you can join us any time online at www.theworld.org. This is 
PRI, Public Radio International. I'm Lisa Mullins. Still to come on 
The World, remembering Lockerbie 10 years later. We know who they 
are. We know their names. We know where they live. We see newsreel 
footage of them intermittently. But that was seven years ago that 
they were indicted and they're still walking around free in Libya. 
Also coming up -- the great and not so great dictators. First, this 
news.
