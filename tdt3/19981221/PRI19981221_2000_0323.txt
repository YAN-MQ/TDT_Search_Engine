More than 1,000 bottles of wine, champagne and cognac which belonged 
to former Romanian ruler Nicolae Ceausescu have been auctioned off 
in Bucharest. The money will go to an old people's home. The bottles 
were bought by a Romanian hotel chain, which paid around $17,000 for 
the entire collection. Most of the wines are Romanian, the oldest 
coming from a vineyard in the east of the country and dating from 
1918. Others were given to Mr. Ceausescu by fellow Communist leaders. 
Each bottle bears a golden ribbon and a card reading Ceausescu's family 
residence. From the BBC, this is The World.
