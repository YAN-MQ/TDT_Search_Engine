In our regular report about how the government spends some of your 
tax dollars, student loans and fake paperwork tonight. This is about 
loans intended for students who want to study at colleges overseas 
and those who figured out how to get your money without ever going 
to school. April 14th, 1998, federal agents spot this man in El Paso, 
Texas. He's trying to defraud the student loan program again, claiming 
he's attending school in the cibbean. I'm going to school. But the 
school closed two months before. He already ripped off taxpayers for 
$18,000. All had he to do was forth the signature of a medical school 
official certifying he was enrolled in the University. This man falsified 
six loan applications and collected $21,000 to attend a University 
in the Caribbean. How simple is the fraud? Relatively simple if one 
is willing to make various false statements and forth documents. So 
simple that Mohammed bilal afif Ibrahim filled out 22 phony loan applications 
and received $400,000. Here's how they got away with it. Tuition checks 
are mailed directly to the students, but education department officials 
do not even know if those students are attending school. We are identifying 
new cases on a consistent basis. Diane Van riper is the inspector 
general for the department of education. Her team uncovered the schemes. 
Do you think the department of education has moved aggressively to 
stop the fraud? no. How hard would it be to stop the fraud? It wouldn't 
be hard at all. Education department officials concede there are serious 
problems. We simply don't have the resources to travel to these institutions 
to review them in the same way we do domestic programs. So far, 18 
people have been charged with fraud, totaling $4 million. But the 
program is so easy to rip off, the losses could be millions more. 
No one knows. "It's your money." James Walker, ABC News, Washington.
