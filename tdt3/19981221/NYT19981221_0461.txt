A man accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden appeared in federal 
court Monday after his extradition from Germany and continued to deny 
any connection to terrorism, his lawyer said after the hearing. The 
suspect, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, was ordered held without bond by a 
judge after the prosecutor said the government was concerned about 
``the danger to the community and the risk of flight.'' A lawyer for 
Salim, while not conceding the government's points, said that he would 
not oppose the request for now. He reserved the right to ask the court 
for Salim's release on bond at a later date. Salim was handed over 
by German authorities on Sunday. He waged a three-month battle to 
avoid extradition in the investigation of bin Laden, the Saudi exile 
suspected of organizing the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa 
last August and of other acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. 
As part of the deal to secure his custody, the United States promised 
Germany that U.S. prosecutors would not seek the death penalty against 
Salim, who was arrested near Munich in September. German law bars 
extradition of suspects to countries where they may face execution. 
Salim, a Sudanese native who is believed to be of Iraqi descent, has 
been charged with four conspiracy counts, including conspiracy to 
murder, to use weapons of mass destruction, to transport explosives 
and to attack American military installations abroad. He is suspected 
of having played a central role in the organization led by bin Laden, 
which is called Al Qaeda. Prosecutors contend that Salim managed bin 
Laden's finances, conducted his international business deals, and 
sought to obtain nuclear weapons components for Al Qaeda. Salim, 40, 
a gaunt man with closely cropped black hair and a short beard, stood 
quietly by his lawyer in court Monday, saying only a few words to 
acknowledge that he understood his legal rights. After the hearing, 
his lawyer, Paul McAllister, said that his client continued to assert 
his innocence. ``The charges are really vague,'' McAllister added, 
saying that one of the counts in the federal complaint against Salim 
charges that he ``conspired to kill nationals of the United States'' 
but names no victims. ``You can't get any vaguer than that,'' McAllister 
said. During the hearing, McAllister also complained to Magistrate 
Judge Ronald Ellis that federal authorities had confiscated some of 
Salim's possessions, including a copy of the Koran that his client 
has had for 22 years and that is ``of great sentimental value,'' some 
legal papers and a wristwatch. McAllister said Salim needed the watch 
so that he could determine when it was time to say his prayers. A 
federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, confirmed that the materials 
were in government custody and ``have not disappeared,'' but said 
that for security reasons, the Bureau of Prisons would have the final 
say on whether they should be returned. Salim's arrival means that 
the government now has custody of five suspects _ a sixth is awaiting 
extradition in Britain _ who have been charged in connection with 
the embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania or other terrorism attributed 
to bin Laden by the authorities.
