This time of year, the ``singing postcards'' are on nearly every street 
corner, determined to carry on a Christmas tradition even if hardly 
anyone understands a word of the songs. They are parang bands, a cultural 
phenomenon in the Caribbean country of Trinidad and Tobago. They begin 
popping up in November and disappear by early January, but with Christmas 
just days away, the singing groups are hitting their peak. Imported 
from nearby Venezuela, the music has a lively, decidedly Latin beat. 
``Parang'' is a mispronunciation of ``parranda,'' the Spanish word 
for ``spree.'' One theory holds that Spanish missionaries began the 
tradition while trying to teach the natives the Christmas story through 
song. Another claims that Venezuelans who came to Trinidad to work 
the coffee and cocoa plantations brought the songs. ``But both _ or 
neither _ might be true,'' said Gail Ganpat of the parang group Los 
Buenos Parranderos. In this English-speaking country populated mostly 
by descendants of African slaves and East Indian immigrants, what 
makes parang's popularity all the more surprising is that the lyrics 
are in Spanish. Traditionally, the language of parang was a creole 
patois or even pseudo-Spanish created as Trinidadians mimicked the 
sounds of Venezuelan workers, Ganpat said. The trend now is a return 
to linguistically correct Spanish. The tradition took root during 
the Spanish occupation of the island from the early 1500s to the British 
takeover at the end of the 18th century, when itinerant groups of 
men and their guitar-like cuatros went from farm to farm like carolers 
singing Christmas songs. The singers would get a taste or two of rum 
from the locals in appreciation and move on to the next house or farm. 
The once-rural tradition has gone nationwide. ``Now it has come to 
the cities,'' said Cynthia Ross, president of the National Parang 
Association. Parang seems to be everywhere. There are concerts, festivals 
and contests that often last all night. During competitions, bands 
are given two topics that they must sing about _ themes such as the 
manger scene, the streets of Bethlehem, or the journey of Joseph and 
Mary. Today the institution of parang has given rise to such variations 
as the use of electrified instruments, women singers and even a genre 
of music know as ``soca-parang,'' a calypso twist on the old recipe. 
In some cases, the songs are now sung in English. ``Gimme rum, gimme 
whiskey, gimme something to eat, and we will sing you our Christmas 
songs,'' goes one. But part of the Parang Association's mission is 
to stick to the age-old lyrics, which Trinidadians still applaud even 
when they don't understand a word.
