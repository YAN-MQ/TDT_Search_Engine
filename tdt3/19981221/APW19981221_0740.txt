Chechen officials plan to travel to Moscow to turn over the severed 
heads of four Westerners found earlier this month in the breakaway 
Russian republic, Chechnya's presidential spokesman said Monday. The 
Chechens were expected in Moscow later this week and will give the 
remains to the British and New Zealand embassies, said Chechen presidential 
spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi of 
Britain and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were abducted Oct. 3 in Chechnya, 
where they were installing a cellular phone system. Their heads were 
found by a roadside Dec. 8. Authorities still have not found their 
bodies. British and Chechen officials denied Monday that the kidnappers 
were demanding a ransom for the bodies. ``I've had some indirect contact 
which suggests that the remains will be transported out (of Chechnya) 
tomorrow, but have not had direct contact confirming the report,'' 
New Zealand Ambassador John Larkindale told The Associated Press. 
``I certainly hope the report is true. We want to repatriate the remains 
as soon as possible,'' he said. The killers remain at large. Chechen 
President Aslan Maskhadov has accused a regional warlord linked to 
past kidnappings with the beheadings. Meanwhile, the head of the Chechengazprom 
gas company was kidnapped while traveling through Grozny in a company 
car, ITAR-Tass cited Chechen officials as saying Monday. Gas company 
employees rallied Monday night to demand that officials crack down 
on the kidnappers. Chechnya has been plagued by violence and kidnappings 
for ransom for years, especially since its 1994-1996 independence 
war against Russia. More than 100 people are thought to be in captivity 
there. Maskhadov, unable to control the rising crime wave, recently 
imposed a state of emergency and promised to crack down on armed bandits 
in the region.
