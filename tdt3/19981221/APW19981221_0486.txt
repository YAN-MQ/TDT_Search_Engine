A tanker has spilled 100 tons of crude oil in the Gulf after colliding 
with a jetty in Iran's southern port city of Bandar Abbas, the official

of the provincial environmental protection department, said a tanker 
carrying 60,000 tons of oil had collided with the jetty while trying 
to berth, IRNA reported. It did not say when the accident occurred 
or whether the tanker was Iranian or foreign. Efforts were underway 
to clean up the oil slick, Saeedpur said, adding that the incident
