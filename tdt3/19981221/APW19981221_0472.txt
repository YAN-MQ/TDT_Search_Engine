The Indonesian government on Monday acknowledged that dozens of ethnic 
Chinese women were raped during May riots that drove former President 
Suharto from power, but denied the attacks were systematic. The conclusion 
was based on a report issued last month by an independent panel investigating 
the May 13-15 riots in which an estimated 66 women were raped and 
10 more were assaulted. The unrest, sparked by economic hardship and 
the killings of four student protesters by the military on May 12, 
left 1,200 people dead. State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said Monday 
that the government so far could confirm that 52 women were raped. 
He added that officials had found 24 were sexually mistreated and 
four others were harassed. ``The government denies there was widespread 
and systematic rape as had earlier been claimed by some parties,'' 
Tanjung said, adding that reports of more than 100 rapes had proven 
unsubstantiated. He also reiterated the panel's finding that not all 
the victims of sexual violence were ethnic Chinese. Ethnic Chinese 
make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's population of 202 million. But 
they play a dominant role in the economy, and this has long invited 
resentment that has often spilled into violence. The government will 
launch a rehabilitation program for the victims of the violence and 
provide compensation for all material loss incurred during the riots, 
Tanjung said. The independent panel concluded some members of the 
military urged crowds to loot and burn in an apparent attempt to destabilize 
the government, while others let the angry mobs run wild.
