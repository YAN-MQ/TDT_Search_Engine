On the tenth anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing, President Clinton 
is warning Libya of further sanctions. Speaking at Arlington Cemetery, 
where he dedicated a memorial to the victims, he said the bombing 
suspects must be handed over for trial by the end of February. Let 
me be absolutely clear to all of you, our policy is not to trust Mr. 
Khadafy's claims. It is to test them. This is a take it or leave it 
offer. We will not negotiate its terms. If the suspects are convicted, 
they will serve their time in Scotland. A number of events have been 
taking place in the United States and Britain marking the anniversary. 
Two hundred seventy people were killed when Pan Am Flight 103 blew 
up over Scotland.
