The attack on Iraq may be over, but national security adviser Sandy 
Berger says the United States will pursue a "deliberate, sustained" 
effort to overthrow Saddam Hussein from within. Berger warns, though, 
that will not happen easily or quickly, even after four days of joint 
U.S./British air strikes. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, 
is declaring victory, and vows to resist any further attacks. Military 
planners say they used more than 415 cruise missiles to attack nearly 
100 targets, while pilots made 650 flights over Iraq to finish the 
job. The bombs destroyed military installations, weapons stockpiles 
and communication centers.
