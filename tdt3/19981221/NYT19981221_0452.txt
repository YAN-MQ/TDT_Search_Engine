Following is the letter from four Republican representatives, Sherwood 
Boehlert of New York, Michael Castle of Delaware, Benjamin Gilman 
of New York and James Greenwood of Pennsylvania, sent to Senator Trent 
Lott, the majority leader. The letter was made public by the authors. 
We write as Republicans who voted to impeach President Clinton. We 
cast that solemn vote because we believe that the president lied under 
oath and that such conduct is serious enough to merit impeachment 
and consideration of the case by the Senate. However, as this most 
serious and difficult matter moves to the Senate, we urge you to allow 
the Senate to consider strong censure as a remedy. We are not convinced, 
and do not want our votes interpreted to mean that we view removal 
from office as the only reasonable conclusion of this case. While 
some have questioned whether the House has the constitutional authority 
to consider alternatives to impeachment, it seems clear to us that 
the Senate does have the authority and the precedents to consider 
a range of options. Those options should include a tough censure proposal, 
which would impose a fine and block any pardon. In considering this 
matter, the Senate should take into account the subject of the president's 
false testimony, the degree to which his conduct threatens the integrity 
and functioning of the government of the United States, and the will 
of the American voter. We believe those factors may lead the Senate 
to conclude that a remedy short of removal is in order. We urge you 
to allow the Senate to consider this matter in a fashion that will 
allow a full debate and consideration of any appropriate action.
