After leading the Cardinals to verge of their first postseason appearance 
in 16 years in his second season as quarterback, Jake "the snake" 
Plummer has been given a four-year, $30 million extension by arizona. 
This organization, the family, the atmosphere around here is something 
that makes me feel very special to be here because they welcomed me 
open-arms during some tough times coming out of college. They stuck 
beside me. And now, it's my turn to give back to them and show them 
what I can do for them. And that's help put a winner out on the field 
for the Arizona Cardinals, this state and everybody.
