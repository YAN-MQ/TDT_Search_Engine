A retired judge was appointed Monday to take over a troubled inquiry 
into whether police acted improperly when they suppressed protesters 
during a 1997 Asia-Pacific summit meeting. Ted Hughes will take the 
place of a three-member inquiry panel that resigned because of confusion 
and controversy over allegations of bias and interference. The inquiry 
was launched by the Public Complaints Commission of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police after student protesters complained that their rights 
had been violated by officers during the 1997 Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation summit in Vancouver. Police used pepper spray to disperse 
students protesting the presence of Indonesian President Suharto. 
Some female protesters were also strip searched. Protesters subsequently 
contended that orders to break up the demonstrations came from the 
office of Prime Minister Jean Chretien because he wanted to spare 
Suharto embarrassment. Opposition parties and many of the protesters 
say the police complaints commission doesn't have the authority to 
deal with the issue of political interference. They have demanded 
a judicial inquiry into the affair, but Chretien has rejected those 
appeals and insists he did not intervene in police matters during 
the APEC summit. Hughes is scheduled to start hearings in January 
that will include repeat appearances from witnesses who testified 
during five sessions conducted by the now-disbanded panel.
