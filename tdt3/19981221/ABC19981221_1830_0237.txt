In the political Tempest that has been the impeachment process, there 
are several careers that have been changed forever. One of those belongs 
to Dennis Hastert of Illinois. Come January he'll have one of the 
most powerful jobs in the U.S. government when he's the new speaker 
of the house. Dennis Hastert, who will soon be 57, was a high school 
teacher and a Wrestling coach before he was a politician. Speaker 
Gingrich, myself and many other members of Congress -- He represents 
the largely republican suburbs west of Chicago. He was a state legislator 
before he ran for Congress in 1986. He is described as a conservative, 
but not an ideologue. There's a big role to play. We need to heal 
the wounds and we need to reach out across the aisle. Hastert has 
risen quite high in republican ranks while keeping a Fairly low profile. 
I didn't really seek this at all. It just kind of happened. So far, 
at least, a man without obvious enemies.
