Ten years ago today, a bomb exploded on Pan Am Flight 103, blowing 
the plane out of the air over Lockerbie, Scotland, and killing 270 
people. Today, memorial services were held to honor the victims in 
Lockerbie, in London's Westminster Abbey, Arlington National Cemetery 
and Syracuse University, which lost 35 students in the disaster. The 
victims' families have spent the past decade grappling with the tragedy. 
But many say they won't find peace until the two Libyan suspects in 
the case are brought to trial. Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy has agreed 
in principle to a trial in The Netherlands but has yet to hand over 
the two men. At first, Khadafy appeared to accept the idea of a trial 
under Scottish law. Now he's calling for an international court. He's 
also insisting the men serve their sentences in Libyan jails if they're 
convicted -- a condition the United States and Britain say they won't 
agree to. Peter Lowenstein, who lost his son, Alexander, on Pan Am 
Flight 103, isn't sure justice will ever be served. There are two 
Libyans that were indicted and most likely are the two men who placed 
the bomb into the system, starting in Malta and ultimately onto Pan 
Am 103. We know who they are. We know their names. We know where they 
live. We see newsreel footage of them intermittently. But that was 
seven years ago that they were indicted, and they're still walking 
around free in Libya. The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya 
in 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two suspects. Negotiations 
went nowhere until last summer, when the United States and Britain 
dropped their insistence that the trial be held on British or American 
soil. George Williams, whose son Geordi was killed in the explosion, 
says even if the trial does go ahead, it won't end the pain. This 
doesn't go away. When you lose a child, that's the worst kind of death 
I can imagine. And we both would have -- I'd gladly have taken his 
place, gladly. He had so much going for him in his life, and they 
snuffed it out. And people ask me, "Don't you think you'll ever have 
closure?" Well, closure will come when they close the lid on my casket. 
George Williams remembered his son, Geordi, at Arlington National 
Cemetery today, where families have erected a cairn of 270 stones 
in honor of their loved ones.
