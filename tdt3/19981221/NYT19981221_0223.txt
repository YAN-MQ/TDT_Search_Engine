This space has been hijacked this week by the Gotcha! Gang, a growing 
legion of readers who take preternatural delight in exposing the grammatical 
errors of the resident columnist. Their motto: ``No Haven for the 
Maven.'' (Excuse me; its motto.) From N. Lewis of Croydon, N.H.: ``You 
write, `A column in this space titled ``The Asian Connection'' had 
just appeared, followed the next day by a front-page article about 
John Huang's fund-raising in The Wall Street Journal.' ``John Huang 
was doubtless a very active fellow, but I doubt he was engaged in 
`fund-raising in The Wall Street Journal.''' Max Culpa for Mayor. 
Huang was surely not chasing the editor Robert Bartley down that newspaper's 
corridors seeking contributions to the Clinton campaign. A prepositional 
phrase like in The Wall Street Journal is a modifier and should cozy 
up intimately to the noun it modifies, lest another, closer noun be 
mistaken for the term being modified. In this case, the noun phrase 
being modified was a front-page article, but I put so many words in 
between that it is possible to think that fund-raising was the modified 
term. The philologist Richard Lederer had a good example of this abuse 
of prepositional-phrase position: ``Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address 
while traveling from Washington to Gettysburg on the back of an envelope.'' 
From Ed Cashin of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.: ``You say, `He offers 
the other two branches of government the choice,' but you mean `the 
two other branches.' Otherwise, we would have four branches of government.'' 
You know, he's got a point. I never thought of that before. Other 
is called a ``postdeterminer'' because it usually comes after words 
that are determiners, like numerals or other quantifiers that make 
a noun phrase specific. Thus, when I wrote the other two branches, 
it could be thought to stand against these two branches _ totaling, 
as my eagle-eyed critic observes, four branches. But if I had written 
the two other branches, there could be no doubt that only three branches 
exist. Some would call this pedantry, but I stand corrected, and in 
turn correct David Schippers, majority counsel of the House Judiciary 
Committee, for his castigation of the president's disdain for ``the 
integrity of the other two coequal branches.'' Cashin is hereby appointed 
recording secretary of the Nit-pickers' League, a highly sophisticated 
subgroup of the Gotcha! Gang whose membership is in constant turmoil 
about writing its name Nitpicker's League. Two weeks ago, in reviewing 
Bryan Garner's Dictionary of Modern American Usage, I misquoted him 
by writing that ``that historic differentiation'' between enormity 
(``outrageousness'') and enormousness (``hugeness'') should be upheld. 
Garner correctly wrote historical. Robert Burchfield's New Fowler's 
Modern English Usage quotes a forgetful maven on that: ``Any past 
event is historical, but only the most memorable ones are historic.'' 
Now to the alleged mistake that drew the most mail. In a line about 
the pronunciation of status, I wrote, ``That is usually pronounced 
STAT-us, as in statistics, by the highfalutin, and STATE-us by the 
hoi polloi.'' From Jim Tart of Dallas: ``My daughter Katie tells me 
that her eighth-grade teacher would have smacked her in the head with 
her grammar book had she said `the hoi polloi.' Katie says hoi polloi 
means `the masses,' and therefore should never be proceeded by the. 
Live by the sword and die by the sword.'' Thank you, Mr. Tart. (And 
when Katie comes by with her spelling book opened to precede, watch 
your head.) Curiously, this seeming redundancy in regard to a foreign 
phrase apparently infuriates Greek scholars. ``Wrong!'' shouts Stephen 
Esrati of Shaker Heights, Ohio. ``Hoi means `the.''' No doubt about 
that. Wrote Ronald Serafine of Butler, Pa.: ``One does not say `the 
hoi polloi' for the same reason that one does not say `with au jus.' 
How plead you?'' Innocent with an explanation, Your Honor. Take that 
French phrase first: When you order roast beef au jus, pronounced 
oh-ZHOO, you are using the French for ``in its juice'' (literally, 
``with juice''). Your waitress is in error if she treats that phrase 
as a noun and asks, ``You want the au jus on the side?'' Correct her, 
and you will soon have a chemise au jus. In the same way, if you correct 
an inviter who writes, ``Please R.S.V.P.,'' you won't get asked again 
to Repondez s'il vous plait (literally, ``Respond, if you please''). 
Those are two-language redundancies not yet given absolution by all-forgiving 
usage. When we speak of ``the hoi polloi,'' however, we are firmly 
grounded in an error that common usage over centuries has erased. 
Certainly, the hoi polloi translates formally and redundantly as ``the 
the masses,'' causing speakers of Greek and members of the Squad Squad 
to look at you with disdain. But the English idiom is the hoi polloi. 
Sometime next century, we will write that as hoipolloi to reflect 
its Anglicization. Robert Burchfield, in the third edition of Fowler's, 
calls the hidebound resistance to the in front of the Greek phrase 
``an attempt to force Greek grammar on the receiving language.'' He 
writes: ``Dryden and Byron wrote `the oi polloi' and who is to quarrel 
with them? And who is prepared to `correct' W.S. Gilbert's lines from 
``Iolanthe,'' 'Twould fill with joy, And madness stark/the oi polloi 
(a Greek remark)'?'' Though willing to go along with the usage roundheels 
on permitting that redundancy, I hang tough on semantics: The meaning 
of the hoi polloi should remain ``the masses,'' or in less-Marxist-sounding 
terms, ``ordinary folk.'' When the writer Pete Hamill told the interviewer 
Charlie Rose, ``Sinatra threw a party for Agnew in Palm Springs with 
all the hoi polloi in attendance,'' Francis Dyer of New York objected, 
noting that the phrase had not taken on a new meaning of ``important 
people, upper classes or `swells.''' That upside-down usage occurs 
often. The confusion comes from the similarity of the noun hoi polloi 
and the adjective hoity-toity, a rhyming compound from the English 
dialect term hoit, ``to play the fool,'' which has come to mean ``foolishly 
snooty.'' (What a pleasure it is to get back to correcting other people's 
mistakes.)
