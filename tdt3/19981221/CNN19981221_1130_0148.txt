The republican's second choice for speaker of the house is getting 
the thumbs up from his hometown. Patty Davis takes a look at Dennis 
Hastert. This is Yorkville, Illinois, the rural town of 5,000 that 
representative Dennis haft earth calls home. Home town values. Many 
here have no doubt the small town man they call Denny can handle the 
big job of speaker of the house. I feel like it is a very tough responsibility, 
and we're going to need the whole strength of the conference and everybody 
working together to make this work, and I think one of my strong points 
is to be able to bring people together and have them use their strengths 
so that we can move our agenda forward. His friends say he first earned 
their respect as a teach taert high school. Former student Gary Matlock 
was his first state wrestling champ. Denny had that charisma about 
him that it was just vibrant and radiant type of leadership. His leadership 
skills will be put to the test if elected speaker. His friends say 
he has a knack for building consensus. Not always agreed with things 
but one thing I know that we woulds a agree, that we would listen 
to me and I would list ton him and we would make a Decision from that 
point on. He's also demonstrated a behind the scenes manner on Capitol 
Hill as chief deputy whip. Police call analysts say Hastert may be 
what Washington needs. You need someone who can bring everybody together 
and I think Denny is someone that can do if. If elected speaker he 
will be one of the most power99 powerful men in Washington. But to 
his friends -- He's a small town boy that's done good. Patty Davis, 
Krorkville, Illinois.
