On Friday, he will turn 40, an age when most baseball players have 
long ago said goodbye to the game and when the few remaining old-timers 
are icing their aching muscles more, playing less and trying to hang 
on to fat salaries. Not Rickey Henderson, soon to start his 21st major 
league season, this one as the New York Mets' new left fielder and 
leadoff man. He is, as General Manager Steve Phillips said, ``Arguably 
the best leadoff hitter in the history of the game.'' At a news conference 
Monday at Shea Stadium, the Mets introduced Henderson, casually elegant 
in a plum-colored wool suit, a gray, figured shirt (no tie) with R.H. 
embroidered on the cuffs, beige leather-and-snake loafers and a standard-issue 
Mets cap. Henderson said he was dedicated to pulling the Mets out 
of the shadow of the champion Yankees. ``I'm hoping I'll change the 
Mets' image,'' Henderson said. ``I can create runs. I steal bases. 
I make things happen. We have guys like Mike Piazza who want to be 
with a winning team, so I'm hopeful we can get good.'' Having added 
Piazza in a late-season blockbuster deal, then picking up Bobby Bonilla 
and Robin Ventura during the off season in addition to Henderson, 
the Mets are hopeful that they can improve on their 88 victories last 
season. Henderson's achievements with his hometown Oakland Athletics, 
the Yankees, the Toronto Blue Jays, the San Diego Padres and the Anaheim 
Angels have him on course for the Hall of Fame. He is the career leader 
in stolen bases (1,297). He ranks third in walks (1,890), sixth in 
runs (2,014), 29th in games played (2,612), 30th in at-bats (9,473) 
and 52nd in hits (2,678). If he stays healthy, the next two years 
could send him past Babe Ruth (2,056) and Ted Williams (2,019) in 
walks and Ruth and Henry Aaron (both 2,174), Pete Rose (2,165) and 
Willie Mays (2,062) in runs. ``I think that's what keeps you going,'' 
Henderson said. But even he is amazed at his longevity. ``When I was 
20, 24,'' he said, ``I just wanted to last five years. I've always 
said age doesn't make a difference.'' After last season, when he batted 
a career-low .236 for the A's, he became a free agent. He said three 
or four clubs wanted him, but he picked the Mets because he felt they 
were on the rise. He signed a one-year contract for $1.8 million. 
The Mets hold an option that will guarantee him $2 million for the 
year 2000 if he makes 500 plate appearances in 1999. If not, there 
is a $500,000 buyout. He made 670 plate appearances this year and 
will have the same opportunity because he will be the Mets' starting 
left fielder. And, he warned, do not write this off as his final contract. 
``A couple of years ago,'' he said, ``I said I might play to 50. I 
don't have any idea how long I can play. If I still love the game 
and if I stay healthy, there is no limit.'' Still, he bemoaned that 
baseball has changed. ``Now it's more business than family,'' he said. 
``We used to care about one another and could stay with one club longer. 
Now you don't know where you're going to be. You do whatever you can 
do for your club, and the next day you may be gone.'' So Henderson 
is gone from Oakland, where he spent most of his career. The Mets 
were concerned that they stole only 62 bases last season (Henderson 
alone stole 66). Their leadoff batters combined for only 15 stolen 
bases last year, with an on-base percentage of .321. So they started 
looking for help. ``We saw some who could steal but not get on base,'' 
Phillips said, ``some who could get on base but couldn't steal.'' 
Then there was Henderson. ``He might have lost a step,'' Manager Bobby 
Valentine said, ``but he has the ability to make havoc.'' Some of 
that havoc was obvious last season, when Henderson, a right-handed 
batter, led the major leagues in walks (118) and stolen bases. Some 
was hidden in esoteric statistics that showed he also led the majors 
in pitches per at-bat (4.43) and pitches seen (2,903). In other words, 
he made pitchers work hard, he got on base often, he stole his way 
into scoring position and he scored often. ``I don't look for walks,'' 
he said. ``I like to go deep in the count so the other guys can see 
what the pitcher is doing. When I played in San Diego, the National 
League pitchers were new and I took more pitches. But then you get 
in a rut and you've got to be more aggressive. If my team needs me 
to be on base more, I'll take pitches. If the team is hitting, I won't.'' 
Desire, he said, is a key to base-stealing. ``You have to want to 
steal a base,'' he said. ``Some guys get caught and won't run the 
next 50 times. I can get caught nine times in a row, but I keep trying 
and I can make the 10th.'' He said there was no mystery to his success. 
``I've never lost my desire,'' he said. ``I still love the game. I 
don't think anything is left now in this game for me but to be a winner. 
The best thing is to be a winner. The worst thing is losing.'' To 
maximize Henderson's effectiveness, the Mets must find an ideal No. 
2 batter. Valentine said that Edgardo Alfonzo was the probable choice, 
with occasional switches to John Olerud, Ventura and Brian McRae. 
To Henderson, it's all the same. ``Bobby hasn't told me who's going 
to bat second,'' Henderson said, ``but he's going to have a great 
year, whoever it is.''
