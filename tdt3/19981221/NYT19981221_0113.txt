All across Latin America, presidents and party leaders are looking 
over their shoulders. With his landslide victory in Venezuela's presidential 
election on Dec. 6, Hugo Chavez has revived an all-too-familiar specter 
that the region's ruling elite thought they had safely interred: that 
of the populist demagogue, the authoritarian man on horseback known 
as the caudillo. A cashiered army colonel, Chavez is to be sworn into 
office for a five-year term on Feb. 2, the eve of the anniversary 
of a bloody but failed military coup he led in 1992. Chavez, a 44-year-old 
former paratrooper, maintains that only a ``social revolution'' can 
be ``the salvation of the country,'' and has vowed to convene a constitutional 
assembly that would rewrite Venezuela's charter and, in all likelihood, 
do away with the democratic two-party system that has prevailed for 
40 years. ``We're running scared; we have sweaty palms,'' said Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada, a former president of Bolivia who went to Caracas 
as part of an international delegation of election observers. ``Venezuela 
is something that will have a great impact.'' The emergence of Chavez 
resonates far beyond Venezuela's borders for reasons both symbolic 
and practical. Venezuela was the birthplace of Simon Bolivar, the 
father of South American independence, and Chavez has presented himself 
as Bolivar's heir and disciple _ despite his past disregard for the 
rule of law. In addition, the overthrow of the dictator Marcos Perez 
Jimenez in 1958 ushered in the modern cycle of civilian democratic 
rule in Latin America and made Venezuela a sort of political laboratory 
for the region. Particularly alarming to the political establishment 
is that Chavez achieved his victory by going outside the traditional 
party system and running as the independent candidate of a loose-knit 
coalition called the Patriotic Pole. Discredited by years of deeply 
entrenched corruption and partisan nepotism, both parties _ one slightly 
left of center, the other on the right _ united at the last moment 
behind Chavez's main opponent, only to find themselves made virtually 
irrelevant by the outcome. Chavez's triumph augurs ``the total disintegration 
of the strongest party system in Latin America,'' according to Arturo 
Valenzuela, director of the Center for Latin American Studies at Georgetown 
University. ``It really is an extraordinary lesson: that you cannot 
over a period of time run a political system with an explicit or even 
implicit pact to divide up the spoils and rule the country on the 
basis of patronage.'' In place of the parties _ which for all their 
flaws have demonstrated respect for democratic institutions _ Chavez 
seems inclined to govern on the basis of a mystical bond he claims 
to have established with Venezuela's 23 million people. He has also 
implied that his new ``people's government'' will not need a Congress 
or other institutions to interpret the popular will and has said he 
prefers direct consultation with voters to the give-and-take of building 
a legislative coalition through compromise and negotiation. ``This 
trend towards government by referendum and plebiscite _ that's not 
democracy, and that's what worries me the most,'' said Eduardo Gamarra, 
director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International 
University here. ``People in power who are having difficulties and 
want to forget the niceties of presidential democracy will be very 
attracted by this model of closing down Congress.'' Since the gradual 
disappearance of military dictatorships in the early 1980s, the basic 
assumption of Latin America's civilian politicians, as well as their 
patrons in Washington, has been that democracy works in tandem with 
open markets, privatization and free trade. But Chavez's resounding 
triumph in a country with the largest oil reserves outside the Middle 
East suggests a basic flaw in that thinking. ``There is growing frustration, 
anger and anxiety throughout Latin America because of the unrealized 
promises from increasing involvement in the global economy,'' said 
Jennifer Schirmer, a Harvard University professor who is an expert 
on Central American military regimes. ``If the upper classes and the 
elite have grown richer, most people, including the middle class, 
are experiencing economic loss, greater instability and an exponential 
growth in crime.'' In that context, she added, Chavez's emergence 
can be seen as ``the first salvo in a class revolt'' that may not 
always seek expression at the ballot box. Or as Luis Vicente Leon, 
head of the Venezuelan polling firm Datanalisis, put it, Chavez's 
followers ``vote for him out of rage'' _ a state of mind that exists 
in abundance from Guatemala to Brazil in nations whose governments 
have favored policies that generate wealth but do not distribute it 
equitably. By sending contradictory signals, Chavez has done little 
to calm concerns about his intentions. Following his triumph, he disavowed 
earlier statements that he would ``fry the heads'' of his opponents, 
described himself as ``a man of peace,'' promised to respect the rights 
of foreign investors and pledged ``a new democracy'' free of corruption 
and patronage. Yet he has also invoked the spirit of Juan Peron of 
Argentina and other populist dictators of the past. ``I am not the 
Peron of Venezuela, I am the Chavez of Venezuela,'' he has said. ``But 
if Peron worried about social justice and equality, then I agree with 
him.'' Of course, Chavez could end up taking the same path as Carlos 
Menem, who was elected president of Argentina in 1989 as a Peronist 
but has governed as a textbook enthusiast of open markets. Then again, 
he may follow the course of Alberto Fujimori of Peru, who made good 
on threats to bypass the traditional political system and has transformed 
himself into a strongman. Either way, a wake-up call to the perils 
of cronyism and growing income disparity has clearly been delivered 
to the region's leaders. What remains to be seen is who, if anyone, 
will heed the sobering message.
