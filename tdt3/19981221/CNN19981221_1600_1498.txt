Beauty was only part of a diverse nationwide contest in India over 
the weekend. The event was the 48th championship dog show. Hundreds 
of dogs representing 30 breeds converged on new Delhi to compete in 
categories such as obedience and working dogs. Organizers say the 
show promotes awareness and healthy breeding of dogs. But for many

best friends.
