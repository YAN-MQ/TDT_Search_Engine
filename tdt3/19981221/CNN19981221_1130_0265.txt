Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a tough challenge 
in parliament today that could threaten the wye peace agreement. The 
120 member house is meeting today to take up a no confidence motion 
against Netanyahu's government and a possible measure to set early 
pelections. If the no confidence motion is passed, elections would 
be held within 60 days. Even Netanyahu's supporters say he would likely 
lose since he holds only a One seat majority in the house.
