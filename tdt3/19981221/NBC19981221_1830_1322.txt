Tonight marks the tenth anniversary of the disaster that was Pan Am 
Flight 103, blown out of the sky by a terrorist bomb, leaving 270 
people dead, most of them Americans. Today, Libya's leader, who is 
sheltering the two main suspects in the bombing, put up new roadblocks 
to their trial, angering U.S. and British officials, and adding insult 
to injury for the victims' families. Here's NBC's Andrea Mitchell. 
Ten years after the explosion, the horror, they say, is just as constant 
-- the pain, never-ending. Every day, there's not a day that goes 
by that I don't think about it. There is another bomb ticking, the 
irresistible bomb of justice and truth. Simultaneous memorials today 
on both sides of the atlantic. Prayers at 2:03 P.M., the very instant 
flight 103 disappeared from the radar screen a decade ago. At a Parish 
church in Lockerbie, Scotland, in London's Westminster abbey -- at 
Syracuse University, the campus that lost 35 students to the terrorists. 
And at Arlington cemetery -- George waterson Williams. George and 
Judy Williams of suburban Maryland lost their only child, geordie, 
an army lieutenant heading home for Christmas. You feel so useless, 
and you can't do anything. The only thing I can do now is seek justice. 
Alexander lowensteen. 21-year-old Alexander Lowenstein, a Syracuse 
University student returning from a semester abroad -- We want to 
know who was responsible. But the two suspects, including a former 
top Libyan intelligence officer, are still beyond the reach of the 
law, especially after more roadblocks today from Libya's Moammar Qaddafi. 
We, as a government, together with the United States government, are 
doing everything in our power to bring the accused to justice. And 
we will not rest. Neither will the families. There's nothing I can 
do to bring my brother, my father, my sister back. So before I die, 
I want to say that I helped bring them justice. a solemn vow to the 
victims, no matter how many years it takes. Andrea Mitchell, NBC news, 
Washington.
