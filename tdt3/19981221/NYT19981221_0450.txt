In the decade previous to this one, New York's most celebrated baseball 
leadoff hitter was not the one referred to by Mets general manager 
Steve Phillips as ``arguably the best leadoff hitter in the history 
of the game.'' It was not Rickey Henderson, who scored 146 runs for 
the Yankees in 1985 and 130 in 1986. Surprisingly, it was a Met, Len 
Dykstra, who in many ways was the tobacco-spitting image of the 1986 
World Series champs. Dykstra, whose nickname was Nails, played wall-hammerin' 
hard, on the field and off. Not coincidentally, his career, like those 
Mets, burned out long before its time. Over in the Bronx, in the years 
when George Steinbrenner's Yankees sorely needed pitching far more 
than parking, Henderson occasionally loafed after a ball hit in the 
gap and protected his ``hammy'' like his wallet, but year in, year 
out, produced statistical documentation for future admission to the 
Hall of Fame. ``We had a good team, a good chemistry,'' Henderson 
said Monday at Shea Stadium, where he was introduced as the left fielder 
for the 1999 Mets. ``What we lacked was a little more pitching.'' 
Henderson played for the Yankees from 1985 to 1989, an era when Steinbrenner 
called his manager, Lou Piniella, during one All-Star Game break to 
triumphantly announce, ``I just won you the pennant.'' The owner had 
traded for pitcher Steve Trout, whose subsequent southpaw offerings 
had the navigational dexterity of a wind-blown balloon. While Dykstra 
was usually deified for every run generated by his bat and grit, runs 
not often wasted by a brilliant Mets pitching staff, Henderson's routinely 
breathtaking performance was typically lost in the monotony of a pitching 
and managerial revolving door. Those Yankees lineups contained three 
pillar superstars _ Henderson, Dave Winfield and Don Mattingly _ in 
the prime of their careers. In a shocking development, Henderson and 
Winfield, both African-American, absorbed the bulk of the criticism 
when the season invariably turned sour. ``I had controversy because 
of my hamstring,'' Henderson said, referring to 1987, when he played 
in just 95 games. ``I kept saying I was hurt, but because I have thick 
legs, they couldn't feel it, and they kept saying it was just tight. 
I had never had an injury before. I kept saying, `What's wrong?' People 
didn't understand, but I found out later the hamstring was torn.'' 
This is not meant to rewrite a personal history. As anyone who was 
around those Yankee teams will admit, Henderson, whether talking about 
himself in the first person or third, was not the easiest player to 
listen to. Nor was he above showing up to work without having taken 
his happy pill (an offense his most strident critics were surely never 
guilty of). But before Henderson begins his second go-round in New 
York, two points of retrospection can be made about his first. First, 
had Steinbrenner given the same weight to pitching in the 1980s as 
he has in the 1990s, Henderson and Winfield could very well have been 
ushered, like Mattingly, into Monument Park, instead of being run 
out of town. Second, that the 39-year-old Henderson has been brought 
back to New York after posting an on-base percentage of .375 in 152 
games last season for the Oakland Athletics, makes him an authority 
not only on his ``hammy,'' but also on the nurturing of a ballplayer's 
body to produce the maximum long-term results. Henderson had a major-league-leading 
66 stolen bases last season. The Mets had 62. Remarkably, with 20 
major-league seasons in the books, he is still playing the speed game, 
albeit somewhat slower afoot and at bat. Baseball's career stolen 
base leader, holder of two World Series rings, turns 40 on Friday, 
and here are the names of the only players who have scored more runs: 
Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Pete Rose, Willie Mays. Here are the 
names of those who have drawn more walks: Ruth, Ted Williams. ``I 
think his longevity says everything about his commitment to his career,'' 
Phillips said. ``That's his message, and that's the one I hope rubs 
off on the other players.'' Phillips said he asked the A's about Henderson's 
eagerness to play every day, and was told they had to fight to give 
him a day off. With the Yankees, he undoubtedly had himself removed 
from a few lineups when his muscles ached but he might have played. 
For this he was assailed by those who have never had to dive back 
into first base a half-dozen times, then get up and steal second an 
average of 81 times a year. Who would now claim that Henderson was 
off base to sit himself down every now and then? And where have you 
gone, Len Dykstra?
