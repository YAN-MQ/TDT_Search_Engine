On one side of the aisle, dropping phrases like ``Christian country'' 
and ``the real America,'' lawmakers rued the decline of absolutes 
in a permissive age. On the other side, invoking images of ``lynch 
mobs'' and ``good old boys,'' they warned of a right-wing coup. From 
one camp came allusions to Watergate that found similarities between 
the transgressions of Presidents Nixon and Clinton. From the other 
came gasps that such analogies were ludicrous. As Republicans brought 
the country to a presidential impeachment and Democrats fought to 
resist it, the debate encompassed more than questions of whether Bill 
Clinton committed perjury and whether lies under oath warranted impeachment. 
It exposed a cultural rift, with people viewing each other suspiciously 
from across the divide. The debate also quibbled over history and 
whether the crisis that gripped the presidency almost a quarter of 
a century ago applied to the situation now. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., 
said that some Republicans who were fighting for Clinton's removal 
from office were motivated in part by his embrace of minorities, which 
they found threatening. ``They think that America should look like 
they look _ white,'' Rangel said in an interview last week. He noted 
that the Republican side of the House Judiciary Committee was all 
white with only one woman, while the Democratic side had five blacks, 
three women and an openly gay man. ``It's a political lynch mob,'' 
Rangel said of the Republicans pushing impeachment. Republicans said 
accusations of racial or sexual animus were absurd. What propelled 
them, they said, was outrage over the specific actions alleged in 
the articles of impeachment against the president. But some Republicans' 
comments also reflected qualms about a departure from traditional 
mores in society symbolized by Clinton, who avoided military service, 
smoked marijuana and repeatedly cheated on his wife. Rep. Bob Inglis, 
R-S.C., used one of his speeches during the House Judiciary Committee 
hearings to attack moral relativism, which conservatives often attribute 
to liberals. ``One view is that there is absolute truth,'' Inglis 
said. ``The other view is that everything is relative.'' ``And really 
what we're seeing here in President Clinton, I believe, is the culmination 
of that,'' he said. ``He is the perfect embodiment of everything being 
relative.'' For several Republicans, there were clear parallels between 
Nixon's abuse of power in covering up the burglary of a Democratic 
political office and Clinton's attempts to keep secret his relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Livingston, who until Saturday had 
been designated as the next speaker of the House, noted that Nixon 
tried to conceal the actions of others but Clinton tried to conceal 
his own. ``So why was impeachment the remedy for Nixon and not for 
Clinton?'' he asked. Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., implied that Clinton's 
actions were graver than Nixon's. ``In Watergate, the president did 
not commit perjury,'' Bliley said during the impeachment debate Friday. 
Some Democrats wondered aloud if Republicans were engaging in a sort 
of payback for the 1974 House Judiciary Committee's vote to send articles 
of impeachment against Nixon to the full House. Nixon resigned before 
the House could vote. ``I have to believe that Speaker Livingston 
has not gotten over Watergate,'' Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said 
in an interview Wednesday, before the Louisiana congressman's announcement 
Saturday that he would not accept the speaker's post. ``It appears 
that some on the Republican side still feel that Richard Nixon got 
a bad deal and that somehow the score needs to be evened.'' The advocates 
and opponents of the impeachment process were separated by cultural, 
racial and even regional rivalries and suspicions, which were made 
clear not only in the back-and-forth between lawmakers but also in 
the voices of Americans trying to be heard. The conservatives' language 
reflected a desire to keep at bay the hair-splitting, religion-flouting 
intelligentsia Clinton sometimes turned to for counsel. Rep. Bob Barr, 
R-Ga., best articulated that wish earlier in the month during a Judiciary 
Committee hearing, taking on several lawyers and scholars who testified 
on the president's behalf. Barr was not depressed by their arguments, 
he said, because ``I think there are two Americas, and there is a 
real America out there.'' ``And it is that America that I have great 
faith in, because it's that America that understands what perjury 
is,'' he added. Last week, when Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, spoke of America 
as a ``Christian country'' when announcing his support for impeachment, 
it seemed to echo Barr's sentiments. At the same time, many of the 
people protesting the impeachment process represented movements and 
groups demonized by conservatives. Prominent feminists marched on 
the office of Livingston last week to demand a meeting, after which 
one of them, Betty Friedan, called the leaders of the impeachment 
effort ``a bunch of dirty old white men.'' Writers like Toni Morrison 
and E.L. Doctorow spoke at anti-impeachment rallies and, inevitably, 
Hollywood celebrities added their voices, with actor Robert De Niro 
personally calling a politician or two to sway their vote. Like their 
political opponents, they had come to see impeachment as a referendum 
on something more than a series of actions by the president, and their 
positions were informed by something larger than party fidelity. The 
words of one Democratic congresswoman during the House debate Friday 
captured their perspective well. ``This is indeed a Republican coup 
d'etat,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. ``Republicans are the 
vehicles being used by the right-wing Christian Coalition to direct 
and control our culture.'' Her audience, both inside and outside the 
U.S. Capitol, included people who felt that she and some Democrats 
were trying to seize the reins in just the same way.
