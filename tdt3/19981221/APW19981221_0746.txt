Charles Bietry, the controversial president of struggling soccer giant 
Paris Saint-Germain, resigned on Monday, the club announced. Reeling 
from a string of disastrous results, PSG, France's richest club, lies 
in 11th place in the French standings, 22 points behind leader and 
archrival Marseille. The club has been in crisis since Bietry, a former 
sports journalist, took over in pre-season. After a string of poor 
results, including a defeat by tiny Maccabi Haifa in the European 
Cup Winners Cup, coach Alain Giresse was fired. But results have not 
improved since Bietry re-appointed Artur Jorge as PSG coach. In its 
final match of 1998 last Saturday, PSG was beaten 2-0 by minnow Lorient. 
Before moving to PSG, Bietry had been sports director at pay television 
broadcaster Canal Plus, which owns the club. Bizarrely, one of Bietry's 
last major decision's at PSG was to re-appoint Jorge. As a sports 
commentator, Bietry had been one of Jorge's biggest critics when the 
Portuguese coach was last in charge at PSG. Bietry, who often sits 
alongside players on the bench during matches, has been accused by 
former players and officials of interfering in team matters.
