The Ugandan army has denied reports it is aiding UNITA rebels fighting 
Angolan government troops, the government-owned New Vision newspaper 
said Monday. ``We have no links with UNITA. We see it as another way 
by Angola of diverting attention from its increasing internal woes 
in face of battlefield losses in the Democratic Republic of Congo,'' 
a military source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Uganda's 
largest newspaper. Following the outbreak in August of a rebellion 
against Congolese President Laurent Kabila, Angola intervened on the 
government side with troops and equipment. But there have been reports 
that it recently withdrew a battalion from the Congo when serious 
fighting broke out in central Angola around the town of Cuito between 
government troops and UNITA forces. Angola and UNITA, the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, signed a peace agreement 
in 1994. Recent news reports have quoted an Angolan military source 
as claiming that UNITA fighters have been seen wearing Ugandan and 
Rwandan army uniforms. In 1997, Angolan troops joined Congolese rebels 
backed by Rwanda and Uganda to oust the longtime head of the former 
Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko, and put Kabila in power. At that time, Angola 
was seeking to deprive UNITA of bases in what was then southwestern 
Zaire. Uganda and Rwanda are supporting the current rebellion in what 
is now Congo because Kabila has allowed rebels acting against them 
to set up bases in eastern Congo. ``Our army is in eastern Congo for 
strategic reasons,'' the newspaper quoted the Ugandan military source 
as saying. ``How could a government with no control of half its territory 
(Angola), chose to intervene in Congo?''
