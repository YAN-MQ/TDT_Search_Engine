President Clinton laid a wreath at Arlington national cemetery today 
to mark the tenth anniversary of the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, 
Scotland. Bells tolled for two minutes at 2:03 this afternoon, the 
hour the plane crashed. In Lockerbie, relatives of victims gathered 
with townspeople for an inter-faith service. 259 people on the plane 
were killed as well as 11 people on the ground. Just as the victims 
of the disaster are being remembered, people are promising not to 
forget those responsible for the bombing. Ten years ago, for you and 
for us, a bomb was ticking. Be assured of this. There is another bomb 
ticking, the irresistible bomb of justice and truth. Be certain that 
our wreath laying today is not a symbolic gesture, it is a Declaration 
that we will not rest until we have justice and truth, until all responsible 
for your deaths are held accountable.
