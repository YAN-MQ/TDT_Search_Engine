Two former presidents, one a republican, the other a democrat, are 
in unison in what the Senate should do regarding the impeachment of 
president clinton. In a joint editorial in today's "New York Times," 
President Gerald Ford and President Jimmy Carter say, "Senate procedures, 
through their flexibility and freedom, provide the means to end this 
national ordeal in ways that can uphold the rule of law without permanently 
damaging the presidency." And that "the American people expect and 
desire an outcome that is firm, fair and untainted by partisan advantage." 
Ford and Carter state, in order to heal the nation, they "personally 
favor a bipartisan resolution of censure by the Senate."
