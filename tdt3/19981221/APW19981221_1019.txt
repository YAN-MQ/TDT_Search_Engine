Azerbaijan urged Russia on Monday to drop a deal to supply Armenia 
with warplanes and beef up military posts in the Caucasus Mountains 
nation. Russia and Armenia signed a deal recently on military cooperation, 
which Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry called a threat to stability in 
the region. The ministry said in a statement Monday that the deal 
contradicts efforts to settle the dispute over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, 
which is inside Azerbaijan but is populated mainly by Armenians. Armenia 
and Azerbaijan fought a six-year war for the region that killed 25,000 
people. Russian, U.S. and French mediators are trying to help the 
two countries resolve the dispute. The military agreement was reached 
during a recent visit to Armenia by the commander of the Russian air 
force, Anatoly Kornukov, the ministry statement said. The deal calls 
for supplies of Russian MiG-29 fighters and strengthening Russian 
military presence in Armenia. Russian military have remained there 
since the 1991 Soviet collapse under an agreement with Armenian officials. 
Azerbaijan has long protested the close Russian-Armenian relations.
