BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley 
Clark, arrived Monday for a brief meeting with head of the Serb-led 
Yugoslav army, the U.S. embassy in Belgrade said. Clark's visit comes 
amid escalating violence in Serbia's southern Kosovo province. The 
American embassy said Clark arrived to discuss ``technicalities'' 
with Gen. Lt. Dragoljub Ojdanic, the newly appointed commander of 
the Yugoslav army. After Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic signed 
a deal last October allowing international monitors in Kosovo, NATO 
began deploying 1,800 soldiers in neighboring Macedonia as a backup 
force in case the monitors run into trouble. But in a recent interview, 
Milosevic said any attempt by NATO to cross into Yugoslavia would 
be prevented by Yugoslav border troops. Milosevic recently appointed 
Gen. Ojdanic as army commander, after firing Gen. Momcilo Perisic, 
following his criticism of the Yugoslav leader over several issues.
