two days after President Clinton's impeachment by the US House of 
Representatives, the White House is focusing on the trial to begin 
in the Senate next month. Vice President Al Gore is appealing for 
a fair bi-partisan proceeding. VOA's Deborah Tate reports. The Vice 
President used a White House Event, Monday, to again criticize Saturday's 
impeachment vote in the House as wrong for the Constitution and wrong 
for America. Mr. Gore who was a US Senator from Tennessee before becoming 
Vice President six years ago, appealed to his former colleagues to 
be voices of reason, deliberation and healing. I hope the Senate will 
therefore forge a fair bipartisan compromise to end this matter promptly. 
And to end it in a way that will respect the will and the wisdom of 
the American people. Mr. Gore was referring to public opinion polls 
showing most Americans preferred censuring, or publicly rebuking Mr. 
Clinton, rather than removing him from office for his efforts to conceal 
his affair with former intern, Monica Lewinsky. Deborah Tate, VOA 
News at the White House.
