The head of Germany's Roman Catholic Church assailed the government 
Monday for planning to allow sales of the RU-486 abortion pill. ``Playing 
down abortion by portraying this drug as a more gentle method is unacceptable,'' 
Karl Lehmann, head of the German bishops' conference, said on German 
radio. ``It remains an illegal killing.'' Former chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, a Christian Democrat, blocked sales of the pill for years, but 
the center-left government that emerged from September elections promised 
a change of course. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder appeared to clear 
the way last week by saying he welcomes giving women an alternative 
to surgical abortion. Edouard Sakiz, the patent holder, said after 
Schroeder's endorsement he would apply to European Union authorities 
next month for approval to market the pill in Germany. The German 
minister for women's affairs, Christine Bergmann, on Monday rejected 
calls for talks with the church. ``I really don't know what there 
is to talk about,'' she said. The abortion pill was first marketed 
in France in 1988. In Europe, only Sweden and Britain have also allowed 
its sale so far. The pill causes an abortion if taken within the first 
49 days of pregnancy. The German company Hoechst originally owned 
the RU-486 patent through its French subsidiary Roussel Uclaf and 
considered marketing the drug in Germany. But the company said at 
the time it would do so only with the backing of Kohl's government, 
which withheld support. Under pressure from anti-abortion groups, 
the company transferred the patent in April 1997 to Sakiz, one of 
the drug's developers. Sakiz produces the drug with a small company 
in France whose name he keeps secret, fearing reprisals from abortion 
opponents.
