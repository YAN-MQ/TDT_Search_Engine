Malaysia has asked Japan for a dlrs 5 billion share of Tokyo's dlrs 
30 billion recovery package earmarked for struggling Asian economies, 
a news report said Monday. Malaysia's Second Finance Minister Mustapa 
Mohamad said that if Malaysia received the money, it would be sufficient 
to finance his nation's 1999 budget deficit, the state-run Bernama 
news agency reported. Recession has taken its toll on Malaysia's economy. 
The inflation rate has risen, industrial production has fallen 10.4 
percent and the overall economy shrank 8.6 percent in the third quarter, 
a dramatic slowdown from a 7.8 percent growth rate in 1997. Bernama 
quoted Mustapa as saying Malaysia's Economic Planning Unit was ``putting 
out a request for about dlrs 5 billion from the Miyazawa Plan,'' referring 
to the stimulus package named after Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa, who unveiled the fund in October. ``Japan is serious with 
Malaysia's loan application and we hope that the deal would be finalized 
soon,'' Mustapa was quoted as saying. Malaysia's announcement comes 
just a few days after Japan's ambassador to Malaysia outlined a separate 
dlrs 2 billion financial aid program for the recession-hit Southeast 
Asian nation. Ambassador Issei Nomura also said that the Japanese 
government was still considering Malaysia's application for a yen 
loan under the Miyazawa plan. The dlrs 30 billion package is to be 
shared by the hardest-hit East Asian economies _ Indonesia, Thailand, 
the Philippines, Malaysia and South Korea. Nomura had said there was 
no fixed allocation for Malaysia and the maximum amount available 
was about dlrs 5 billion.
