There are some important pronouncements from Robert Isabell, the Manhattan 
florist who did Caroline Kennedy's wedding, Jacqueline Onassis' funeral, 
last year's Versace tribute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and, 
this year, the White House. White lights on Christmas trees have become 
so tiresome that he has switched to the mixed colors considered so 
hideously downmarket in the 1980s. Pointsettias are overdone, but 
they last. Carnations can actually be chic, like the burgundy ones 
he used at the opening of the New York Public Library's Reading Room. 
(``Oscar de la Renta called and asked, `What were those beautiful 
flowers?''') Sunflowers are an unfortunate trend, but marigolds, like 
those he used for the opening of the Jackson Pollock exhibition at 
the Museum of Modern Art, are marvelous. Magnolia leaves on Christmas 
mantels have become very big in the North. But never, ever use a vanilla-scented 
candle at dinner, unless you're in Bali. ``In New York City,'' he 
said, ``it's just all wrong.'' So went a conversation last week with 
Isabell, which started on his daily morning prowl through the 28th 
Street flower district, continued in his black Cadillac en route to 
his 13th Street office (where his staff was making snowmen out of, 
yes, carnations, for a ``winter wonderland'' party), and ended up 
at his West Village town house, a modernist villa with an interior 
atrium of cascading walls of philodendron, where he talked about his 
Christmas decorations for the White House. ``It was a great honor,'' 
he said, ``maybe even more this year than other years. I hope we brought 
some happiness to the Clintons.'' Isabell worked with Nancy Clarke, 
chief White House florist, who has been there since the Carter administration. 
He made 18 gold-leafed conical trees for the East Room, a lot of crystallized 
fruit for the State Dining Room and an enormous outdoor wreath of 
noble fir and blue lights for the South Portico. This he considers 
his masterpiece. He and his staff hand-dipped 1,500 bulbs into a blue 
gel used for theater lighting to get just the right hue _ ``presidential 
blue,'' as he calls it. ``Royal blue is not the color of the presidency,'' 
he said. ``That's too dark. It has no life. And Navy blue is very 
blackish. This is a very intense, memorable blue. You'll always remember 
seeing a wreath of blue lights.'' Isabell has been the premier florist 
and party producer for New York society and people with enormous amounts 
of money for more than a decade, but this is his first foray into 
the White House. ``We knew about him, of course,'' said Capricia Penavic 
Marshall, the White House social secretary. ``And Mrs. Clinton had 
seen his work before, and noted it.'' In June, Isabell was invited 
to a White House dinner, and by September, Mrs. Clinton had her office 
give him a call. ``She gave me the directions, specifically,'' Ms. 
Marshall said. ``She said, `I would like to bring in Robert Isabell 
to work with Nancy Clarke.'' Isabell made several trips south, and 
got along famously with the first lady, Ms. Marshall said. ``They 
had a wonderful time,'' she added. ``They walked from room to room, 
deciding where they were going to place things.'' Isabell, who says 
he is in his ``late 30s,'' said he came to Manhattan from Duluth, 
Minn., 20 years ago, which means he arrived in his late teens. This 
is entirely possible, since he didn't go to college. (Although in 
1995, Vanity Fair said he was 41.) In any case, Isabell is murky and 
sensitive about his past. His mother was a homemaker; Vanity Fair 
described his father as a power-plant operator. ``I don't want to 
talk about my father,'' Isabell said last week. ``I just don't want 
to even get into it.'' Isabell, who is tall, dark and handsome, with 
a soft Minnesota accent, did say he worked in a Duluth greenhouse 
from a very young age, then for the society florist Renny when he 
first arrived in New York. Soon he had started his own business _ 
and was planning events for Studio 54. In August 1989 he created the 
50th-birthday party for Saul Steinberg at which two children dressed 
as cherubs wheeled out a five-tier cake covered in gold and silver 
leaf. But his biggest party to date was the three-day celebration 
in 1995 of the wedding of Marie-Chantal Miller, the second daughter 
of a billionaire, and Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece. For the pre-ceremony 
ball, Isabell created a Greek temple at an estate outside London. 
``The party went on until six in the morning,'' he said. ``I've never 
seen so many young girls wearing couture.'' Nonetheless, friends describe 
Isabell as shy, a little mysterious, and private. ``You run into him 
at these places, and there's Robert in the corner, in a little denim 
jacket, watching everything,'' said Wendy Wasserstein, the playwright. 
And yet, Isabell does 300 to 400 events a year, from the 50-foot moss-covered 
Eiffel Tower he once built for Bendel's to Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's 
lily-of-the-valley wedding bouquet. Why flowers? ``I don't even know,'' 
he said. ``It always brings joy to people. People use them at the 
important moments of their lives.''
