Two of the National League's greatest quarterbacks are set to face 
one another in the weekly Monday Night game. It will be John Elway 
of the Superbowl Champions Denver Broncos visiting Dan Marino and 
the Miami Dolphins. This is just the second meeting in their illustrious 
16-year careers. The first time they played each other was in 1985, 
and Miami won 30-26. Marino is among the many who are surprised the 
two teams have not met in so long. Yes, it's kind of weird. I don't 
really figure out how that - it's almost impossible - but it has happened. 
And so it's really unusual, I'm looking forward to the game. I really 
am. I just think its kind of weird that it hasn't happened for so 
long. Elway and Marino are the only quarterbacks in NFL history to 
amass 50,000 yards, and also hold the distinction of passing for 3,000 
yards in 12 different seasons. Elway finally won the elusive Super 
Bowl Ring last season. Marino has yet to win the big game. That's 
a look at Sports, I'm Jim Stevenson.
