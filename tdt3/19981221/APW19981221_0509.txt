Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala on Monday handed his 
resignation to the country's king, the royal palace said in a statement. 
Koirala's resignation as prime minister of the minority government 
is a technical requirement for Koirala's Nepali Congress and its new 
partner _ the Communist Party of Nepal, United Marxist Leninist _ 
to form a new coalition government. Koirala will continue as the prime 
minister of the new coalition government. King Birendra has also set 
Wednesday as the deadline for any other parties to come forward and 
stake their claim for a government as required by the constitution. 
Nepal was an absolute monarchy until a pro-democracy movement forced 
constitutional reforms in 1990 that reduced the king to a figurehead. 
Nepal has been politically unstable since, with five prime ministers 
in the last four years. On Sunday, Koirala persuaded the communist 
group to back him so the two parties could lead Nepal into general 
elections early next year. Koirala lost the support of a junior partner, 
the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal, on Dec. 10 when 13 
government ministers from the group quit the Cabinet over several 
local disputes. A group of opposition parties filed a no-confidence 
motion against Koirala and his nine-month-old government on Sunday. 
Koirala's resignation pre-empted that move.
