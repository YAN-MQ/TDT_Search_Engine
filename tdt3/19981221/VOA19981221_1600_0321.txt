Heavy artillery fire has again rocked the capital of Congo Brazzaville, 
where government troops have been fighting opposition militia. Witnesses 
in Brazzaville say shops and homes are being looted by pro-government 
militiamen run amuck. Brazzaville's former Prime Minister Bernard 
Collelas says his fighters have infiltrated southern areas of Brazzaville, 
but President Sasu Ingassa says his troops are in control of the capitol.
