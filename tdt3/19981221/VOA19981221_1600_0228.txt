The United States and Britain say they will seek a additional sanctions 
against Libya if that country does not hand over two alleged terrorists 
to The Netherlands for trial. VOA United Nations correspondent Max 
Ruston reports. US and British Ambassadors say they will seek the 
additional sanctions in February if Libya does not hand over the two 
men suspected of bombing Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie Scotland. 
The warning came on the tenth anniversary of the bombing, which killed 
270 people. Libya has agreed in principle to hand over the two men 
for trial in a Scottish court in The Netherlands, but it has not done 
so claiming a number of legal issues remain to be resolve. The main 
point of dispute is where the two men will serve their sentences if 
found guilty. Libya is objecting to the demand by Britain and the 
United States that they serve their sentences in Scotland. US Ambassador 
Peter Burley says patience is running out, and the world community 
cannot wait forever for Libyan authorities to reach a conclusion on 
the issue. Max Ruston, VOA News, United Nations.
