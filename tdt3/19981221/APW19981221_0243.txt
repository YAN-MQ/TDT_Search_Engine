Baghdad renewed its claim of victory on Monday, and extremist Muslim 
groups threatened retaliation for the four days of U.S.-British airstrikes 
against Iraq. Meanwhile, U.N. officials said humanitarian workers 
would return to the Iraqi capital on Tuesday to resume supervision 
of food aid. The workers were evacuated last week to the neighboring 
Jordanian capital Amman amid the bombardment. Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein, in his first public comments since the attacks ended late 
Saturday, said Iraq was victorious against ``enemies of God.'' In 
a brief speech Sunday on radio and television, Saddam said the Iraqi 
people and the army have proved to be ``worthy of what your leadership 
expected from you.'' ``God will repay well and crown your heart with 
clear victory,'' he said. No final casualty toll has been released, 
but previous reports indicated at least 42 Iraqis were killed and 
96 wounded in the strikes, which unleashed the most severe firepower 
since the 1991 Gulf War. Iraqi forces offered little resistance other 
than anti-aircraft fire. Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, claimed 
Sunday the toll was much higher. ``Casualties are in the thousands 
in terms of people killed or wounded, but we don't have any final 
figure,'' he told CNN. ``There has been enormous damage mainly to 
the civilian infrastructure and to human lives.'' In halting the strikes, 
President Bill Clinton said the 70-hour assault severely damaged Iraq's 
ability to build weapons of mass destruction. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright said Sunday that the United States might strike again if 
Saddam rebuilds his weapons of mass destruction. ``We reserve the 
right to use force again,'' Albright said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
Iraqi officials have not allowed reporters to inspect areas where 
the most extensive damage occurred, including presidential palaces 
and defense installations. In New York, a statement issued by U.N. 
spokesman John Mills said oil monitors from the Dutch company Saybolt 
have remained on duty and that teams from the British firm Lloyds 
Register was asked to return immediately to certify incoming food 
shipments. Extremist Islamic groups, meanwhile, threatened retaliation. 
Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, said in a statement sent 
to the Cairo office of Al-Hayat newspaper that the attacks were ``a 
disgrace to the Islamic nation,'' the paper reported Monday. The group 
called for a ``holy war'' against the United States and a boycott 
of American and British products, the paper said. It also called trying 
``those who live in the White House as war criminals.'' Anonymous 
calls to Al-Hayat also threatened attacks on Kuwaiti embassies and 
``American interests'' in the Gulf. In Iraq's state-run newspapers, 
the rhetoric Monday was as strident as before the assault and repeated 
the government's assertion that it was the winner. ``Victorious, as 
the bad bid has failed,'' said the headline in Al-Qadissiya. In his 
speech, Saddam also criticized the Arab world for pretending to be 
``asleep ... or sick'' and not supporting Iraq. ``A new aggression 
(was) started by the enemies of God and the nation. With it, the resistance 
started again,'' he said. After calling off the attacks, Clinton said 
he hoped that U.N. weapons inspectors would be able to return to Iraq 
to resume their 7 1/2-year mission to search and destroy illegal weapons. 
The airstrikes were launched on the grounds that Iraq was obstructing 
the work of the weapons inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission, 
or UNSCOM. But Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan declared Saturday 
night that UNSCOM's ``mission is over.'' Baghdad was bustling with 
normal activity, but in the streets, there was anger. If ``Clinton 
has achieved his mission, why does he say the inspectors must return?'' 
asked Ali Mahmoud Abdel Munaim, an unemployed 32-year-old man. If 
everything illegal has been destroyed in the airstrikes, ``the next 
step ought to be lifting of sanctions,'' he said. The U.N. economic 
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted 
until UNSCOM certifies Iraq is free of all nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons and long-range missiles. UNSCOM chief Richard Butler said 
it was necessary to return the monitors to Iraq, telling Associated 
Press Television News that the inspections were ``a test case in the 
field of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.'' After 
the strikes, many Iraqis were coming to terms with the blows the missiles 
dealt to their lives. Adil Mohammed Nori, a 50-year-old spice store 
owner, said he was preparing to drive 185 miles (297 kilometers) to 
the southern town of Ali al-Gharbi. Asked why, he said: ``To attend 
a funeral for a mass destruction weapon that Clinton has destroyed: 
my 12-year-old niece.'' He said the girl, Zehra, was killed in one 
of the missile strikes. The Pentagon says 425 Tomahawk cruise missiles 
were fired during the campaign _ more than the number fired in the 
entire five-week Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq says its 
gunners shot down more than 100 Tomahawks. The offensive involved 
650 aircraft missions, including 32 sorties by 12 British Tornado 
fighter-bombers. When Clinton called a halt to the attack, it apparently 
caught the British by surprise. The Royal Air Force had to recall 
four Tornadoes that were already en route from Kuwait to Iraq to bomb 
Republican Guard positions, said Group Capt. Bryan Collins.
