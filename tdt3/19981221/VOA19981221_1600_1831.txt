Israel's Parliament has voted overwhelmingly for early elections, 
after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to win support for 
his peace-making policy with the Palestinians. The vote was 81-30 
in favor of a new election with nine other Knesset members obstaining 
or absent. VOA's correspondent, David Gulles reports from Jerusalem. 
Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud Party decided to join in the move for 
elections after it became clear the Prime Minister's right leaning 
coalition stood to lose a confidence vote in Parliament. The left-of-center 
Labor Party accuses Mr. Netanyahu of wrecking the peace process with 
the Palestinians by pandering to far-right parties. In a blistering 
speech, Labor leader, Ahud Barrach heard here through an interpreter, 
said the government had lost all principles. It's a systematic capitulation 
to the extremists in order to survive. This is a government, which 
cannot and does not wish to work for the sake of the whole of the 
Israeli people. Mr. Barrach turned down a last minute appeal from 
the Prime Minister to join in a national unity government. David Gulles, 
VOA News, Jerusalem.
