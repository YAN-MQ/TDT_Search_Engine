Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." While Dan Marino and John 
Elway battle it out in a matchup of two future hall-of-famers, one 
of this season's top guns has suffered a setback, although for how 
long is still uncertain. Randall Cunningham has a broken left hand, 
although it did not prevent him from using his right on all handoffs, 
as Minnesota wrapped up home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs 
with a 50-10 thrashing of jacksonville last night. Randall Cunningham's 
hand, you know, it's -- I guess you'd say a break along a certain 
line. There's not a lot of swelling in there. It's on his left hand. 
And I'm not sure exactly what we'll do preventative-wise. There was 
nothing on it at practice just a while ago. I'm not sure if they'll 
continue to pad it as they did before or not. But that opposite hand 
has very little effect on your throwing.
