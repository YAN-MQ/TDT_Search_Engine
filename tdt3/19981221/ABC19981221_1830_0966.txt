"On the money" tonight -- a nasty trade dispute between the U.S. and 
Europe about bananas. The U.S. is about to impose a 100% tax on European 
imports, ranging from handbags and cashmere sweaters to sheep's milk, 
used to make cheese. The U.S. says this is because the European union 
gives preferential treatment in the banana trade to its former colonies, 
which the U.S. claims is unfair to American companies.
