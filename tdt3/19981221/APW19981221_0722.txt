LONDON (AP) _ U.S.-British airstrikes left Iraq ``significantly weaker'' 
and wrecked parts of its military structure, Prime Minister Tony Blair 
said Monday. ``The full battle damage will await a later time, but 
I think it is beyond any doubt at all that we have set back certainly 
part of his military infrastructure several years,'' Blair said in 
an interview broadcast by Cable News Network. Earlier, Blair's office 
said the military action targeted 100 sites and left the Iraqi air 
defense system ``in ruins.'' Britain, the United States and its allies 
will look at the possibility of resuming weapons inspections in Iraq, 
but ``there is no point in having such a regime unless it works,'' 
Blair said. Ultimately, force might be required again to contain President 
Saddam Hussein's ambitions, he said. ``Saddam is significantly weaker. 
There are parts of his military infrastructure that is in ruins. It 
is true that we could do even more if we were committing an even greater 
amount of force, or ground troops, but I think that people aren't 
prepared to do that in this situation,'' Blair said. ``What happens 
now is perfectly simple,'' he added. ``One, we contain him, if necessary 
by the threat of military force. Two, we investigate whether it is 
possible to put a proper regime in. If it is, we do that. If it isn't, 
and if Iraq is not going to cooperate at all, then we have to rely 
on other methods of containment. And thirdly, of course, we make sure 
that the regime of sanctions enforcement is tightened.'' A spokesman 
for Blair, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said targets during 
the four-day bombardment that ended Saturday included 20 command and 
control facilities and nine sites linked to the Republican Guard. 
Attacks on 35 other targets ``have left the Iraqi air defense system 
in ruins,'' said the spokesman. Six of the targets were related to 
delivery systems, including remote-controlled aircraft, for Iraq's 
weapons of mass destruction, he said. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook 
said earlier that Britain's next step would be to try to isolate Iraq 
in the world community and reduce any support Saddam Hussein's regime 
has among Arab nations. Cook said there also would be new attempts 
to get humanitarian aid directly to the Iraqi people. ``It's not going 
to be easy,'' he told BBC Radio, ``because Saddam does everything 
possible to obstruct and prevent it, and it is very difficult to operate 
in Iraq without Saddam's agreement given the brutality and savagery 
with which he represses all opposition.'' After a meeting later with 
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, Cook said the European Union 
would participate in the humanitarian efforts. Britain also wants 
to ensure that U.N. monitoring of Iraq's weapons program is maintained 
and that sanctions are better enforced. Britain and the United States 
had said Iraq's refusal to cooperate fully with the inspectors led 
them to attack. Iraq says it will no longer tolerate the weapons inspections. 
Cook said the military strikes had destroyed Saddam's ability to jam 
radio programs being broadcast into Iraq from opposition groups and 
news programs. ``We can try now to get the truth into the Iraqi people,'' 
he said. The foreign secretary said he would spend Monday speaking 
by telephone with European and Arab leaders to try to build support 
for non-military action against Iraq. ``We will be seeking to build 
the broadest possible consensus against Saddam and make sure he is 
as isolated as possible,'' he said. Eight Arab states _ including 
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria _ warned Baghdad last month that it 
would be ``held responsible for any consequences'' of not cooperating 
with U.N. officials. But no Arab government expressed support for 
the airstrikes _ which were condemned by the world's largest Muslim 
group, the 52-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference based 
in Saudi Arabia. The United States said Sunday that the airstrikes 
had achieved their specific military objectives, and that U.S. policy 
was shifting toward toppling Saddam.
