Baghdad renewed its claim of victory on Monday, and extremist Muslim 
groups threatened retaliation for the four days of U.S.-British airstrikes 
against Iraq. Meanwhile, U.N. officials said humanitarian workers 
would return to the Iraqi capital on Tuesday to resume supervision 
of food aid. The workers were evacuated last week to the Jordanian 
capital Amman amid the bombardment. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, 
in his first public comments since the attacks ended late Saturday, 
said Iraq was victorious against ``enemies of God.'' In a brief speech 
Sunday on radio and television, Saddam said that the Iraqi people 
and the army have proved to be ``worthy of what your leadership expected 
from you.'' ``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear 
victory,'' he said. No final casualty toll has been released, but 
previous reports indicated at least 42 Iraqis were killed and 96 wounded 
in the strikes, which unleashed the most severe firepower since the 
1991 Gulf War. Iraqi forces offered little resistance, other than 
anti-aircraft fire. Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, claimed 
Sunday the toll was much higher. ``Casualties are in the thousands 
in terms of people killed or wounded, but we don't have any final 
figure,'' he told CNN. ``There has been enormous damage mainly to 
the civilian infrastructure and to human lives.'' In halting the strikes, 
President Bill Clinton said the 70-hour assault severely damaged Iraq's 
ability to build weapons of mass destruction. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright said Sunday the United States might strike again if Saddam 
rebuilds his weapons of mass destruction. ``We reserve the right to 
use force again,'' Albright said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Iraqi 
officials have not allowed reporters to inspect areas where the most 
extensive damage occurred, including presidential palaces and defense 
installations. U.N. officials said that more than 100 U.N. aid workers 
would leave Amman early Tuesday for Baghdad. A statement issued by 
U.N. spokesman John Mills in New York said oil monitors from the Dutch 
company Saybolt have remained on duty and that teams from the British 
firm Lloyds Register had been asked to return immediately to certify 
incoming food shipments. Extremist Islamic, 14th graf prvs
