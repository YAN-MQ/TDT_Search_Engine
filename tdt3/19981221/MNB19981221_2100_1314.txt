Midnight marks more than the start of a new day for gas station owners 
across the country. After a 10-year grace period the federal deadline 
has arrived for stations to replace or upgrade underground station 
tanks. The E.P.A. worried about ground water pollution from leaks 
says 10 years is more than enough notice. Some station owners say 
they can't afford to change, dig up and install. If they ignore the 
law and get caught they face fines of up to $11,000 a day.
