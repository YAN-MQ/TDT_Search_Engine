Japan's trade surplus has fallen for the first time in 20 months. 
As Amy Vickers reports from the VOA Asia News Center, the numbers 
surprised economists who had expected a small increase. Japan's trade 
surplus with the rest of the world shrank 15 percent in November, 
compared to the same time a year earlier. It was he first contraction 
in nearly two years. Keiko Kondo, a strategist with Investment Bank, 
Merrill Lynch, Japan says the data defied most analysts expectations 
that the surplus would continue to rise. I think people see that the 
trend is different, based on the number this time. But I think it's 
probably too early to conclude, I think, that the trends reversing 
at this point. I think people want to see, if it is to continue maybe 
they will start reacting. In the previous month, the surplus had surged 
24 percent. Economists say, the latest figures suggest Japan's export 
industries, including automobiles and electronics are slowing down. 
The biggest decline was in goods and services to the rest of Asia, 
which is still struggling with recession. It fell by two-thirds from 
a year ago. In contrast, Japan's surplus with the United States grew 
by one percent. Although the trade figures show Japan cannot rely 
on exports to cure its economic woes, the government, Monday, reaffirmed 
its commitment to stimulate the economy domestically. It approved 
a draft budget for the coming fiscal year, which aims to end the recession 
through heavy spending. Parliament is expected to approve a final 
version next month. Miss Kondo says, the budget will boost spending 
by a record 5.4 percent. Most things were expected in the sense that 
we had already an announcement of a large fiscal stimulus, earlier 
in the economic package. And basically the budget includes a lot of 
that. So, I guess in terms of how to finance that, obviously they 
have to increase the issuance of deficit financing bonds. The bonds 
will cover the sharp drop in revenue and the surging budget deficit 
that will result from the increased spending. But, with Japan's economy 
suffering through its worst period since World War II, Japan's Finance 
Minister says these steps are essential. Amy Vickers for VOA News,
