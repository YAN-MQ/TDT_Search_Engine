And that brings us now to time for Sports with Jim Stevenson. Well, 
a very big day on the ski slopes where Austrian skiers have made history 
before the home fans in Innsbruck. Led by double-Olympic gold-medalist 
Hermann Meyer, they swept the top nine places in the Men's World Cup 
Super Giant Slalom race. That had never happened before in the men's 
or the women World Cup circuit. The previous best team showing was 
when France had the top six women in a downhill race in Italy in 1968, 
30 years ago. Finishing second to Meyer on Monday was Christian Meyer, 
he's no relation. Fritz Stroebel was third. Norway's Laso Paulson 
was the first of the non-Austrian finishers in 10th place, he was 
one full second behind the winning time. Skiers in the second through 
sixth places were separated by a mere five one-hundredths of a second. 
Meyer known as the Hermanator is now the over all World Cup leader 
in skiing.
