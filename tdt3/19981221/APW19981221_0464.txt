More than 1,000 bottles of wine, champagne and cognac belonging to 
former Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's were sold Monday for 
about dlrs 15 a bottle. A Romanian hotel chain paid about 180 million 
lei (dlrs 17,000) for 1,140 bottles of Ceausescu's wines, which he 
received as presents during his 25-year-rule. The vintage alcohol 
will go on sale at three company hotels in Transylvania and Bucharest, 
``so that anyone can drink the former president's wine,'' Livia Sinescu, 
deputy director of Savion S.A., said by telephone. The state-run company 
Bucur S.A., which organized the auction, said it was ``fairly satisfied'' 
with the sale. The starting price was 35 million lei (dlrs 3,334). 
The proceeds will go to a senior citizens home. Most of the wines 
come from Romanian vineyards. Others were given to Ceausescu by other 
Communist leaders. The oldest bottles come from the Tirnave vineyard 
in eastern Romania and date to 1918. Savion outbid five other Romanian 
companies to buy the collection. Each bottle is sealed with a gold 
ribbon, bearing an attached card reading ``Ceausescu's family residence.'' 
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed in December 1989 after 
a summary trial. The couple lived in the lap of luxury while most 
Romanians languished in deep poverty _ both fascinating and repelling 
many Romanians. The government plans to include overnight stays in 
dozens of the couple's marble and gold-plated villas and palaces as 
part of a luxury travel package. Ceausescu's cars and boats are awaiting 
a government decision to be auctioned.
