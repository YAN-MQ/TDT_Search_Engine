You may admire Kazuko's work, but don't call her a designer. ``I don't 
design,'' she said emphatically the other day. ``I make things.'' 
What she makes are one-of-a-kind necklaces, pins, earrings and bracelets 
of precious and semiprecious stones wrapped in gold wire; evening 
belt purses of antique fabric trimmed with pearls and crystals; hand-painted 
stationery, and vests made of antique laces adorned with delicate 
stones. Her jewelry has earned her a loyal following in the 10 years 
it has sold at Barneys New York stores, but the newer note cards and 
fabric pieces have created the impetus for an exhibition of Kazuko's 
work planned for spring at the Holly Solomon Gallery, 172 Mercer St. 
Kazuko considers herself an artist. Others may call her an artisan. 
She makes everything herself, with no assistants, working on the floor 
of her all-white apartment high above West 57th Street. ``I call this 
a high-rise loft,'' she said, pointing to a view of Central Park and 
beyond through uncurtained windows. ``I'm obsessed with light. When 
I meditate, I look at the clouds.'' She lives with almost no furniture, 
stacking her belongings on the floor and covering them with white 
fabrics like dropcloths. ``I grew up very modern in Japan, and now 
I live very Japanese,'' she said. Her piles of books are blanketed 
with gauze. ``I cover them because they talk too much,'' she said. 
``They have too much energy coming out.'' Her computer, which is also 
white, sits shrouded on the floor of her bedroom, though she prefers 
to write everything by hand, even invoices and faxes. The only color 
comes from spindly plants, tiny animal figurines, framed photographs 
and, when she works, colored stones like coral, tourmaline and aquamarine. 
A diminutive, birdlike woman with long black hair, Kazuko wore nothing 
but black for many years, until her acupuncturist told her that black 
attracts negative energy. (Tell that to the fashion flock.) Now she 
wears only white, usually voluminous swaths of fabric from designers 
like Issey Miyake, Fernando Sanchez and Yeohlee. ``I totally believe 
in fashion,'' she said. ``Fashion is like Zen. What we put on our 
body is as important as what we eat and breathe.'' She wears a bracelet 
encasing three large clear crystals on one wrist and a changing assortment 
of necklaces holding colored stones and crystals around her neck. 
The stones she chooses carefully each day, not for color but for symbolism. 
She believes in the power of crystals, attributing special properties 
to each stone and calling her jewelry ``healing sculpture.'' ``You 
feel a healing energy when you stitch each bead,'' she maintained. 
``Your heart has to be in the right place. If I'm angry, I can't make 
these things. The needles cut and the wires bruise my skin.'' She 
said that when someone first suggested rubbing a stone for 15 minutes 
a day to release its healing power, she was skeptical. ``I tried it 
for two weeks and began to feel better,'' she said. ``I began to study 
crystals. This belief in crystals didn't start in the '60s. It has 
been throughout history. I envisioned the caveman seeing a crystal 
in his cave and rubbing it until it shined.'' Some of the women who 
wear her jewelry believe, like Kazuko, that it has talismanic properties. 
Kitty D'Alessio, a former president of Chanel and of Josie Natori, 
wears Kazuko's clear crystal bracelets all the time since a bout with 
cancer five years ago. Holly Solomon says she never leaves the house 
without a Kazuko crystal heart. ``I wear her pieces because I have 
luck with them,'' Ms. Solomon said. ``Every time I wear them, I make 
a deal.'' Gloria Vanderbilt, Anne Slater and the chef-restaurateur 
Daniel Boulud also collect Kazuko's jewelry. (Men tend to wear small 
stones pinned inside their jackets.) In New Age-speak, clear quartz 
crystal can balance the emotions, stimulate the brain and dispel negative 
energy. But it's a good bet that most women who wear Kazuko's jewelry 
aren't interested in magical qualities. They just admire it for its 
beauty, which is both primitive and sophisticated _ and because it 
is instantly recognizable and rarely fails to elicit admiring comments. 
That's certainly why fashion magazines photograph the jewelry, and 
why it has retained a prominent spot in every Barneys store. It fills 
two showcases inside the main entrance to the Madison Avenue store 
and is displayed in the tallest fixture on the main floor of the Beverly 
Hills branch. No one who enters a Barneys could avoid seeing it and 
usually stopping to look, if not to buy. Although Kazuko, who uses 
just one name (``like Cher and Madonna,'' she said), studied painting 
as a child in Tokyo, she dabbled in many arts after arriving in New 
York in 1968 on a scholarship. ``I studied theoretical drama at NYU 
and went to La Mama and worked there for a year,'' she said. She then 
became interested in photography and exhibited her hand-painted photographs 
in a SoHo photo gallery in 1972. When she developed an allergy to 
the chemicals, she looked for a new outlet for her creativity. ``I 
became a technojunkie and started making videos,'' she said. ``I was 
making avant-garde videos, trying to express everything poetically. 
I wanted to make technology my slave, but it didn't work out. Technology 
was not making me happy.'' Her friend Robert Frank, the photographer, 
told her to do something simple, ``something that makes you happy.'' 
Since she had been collecting antique fabrics and beads, she started 
to make scarves and adorned them with beads. ``I wanted to do something 
one of a kind that comes out of my hand and my heart,'' she said. 
``I used to wrap the stones with silk threads, but I had no idea silk 
wouldn't hold the stone.'' That's when she discovered gold wire and 
developed the cagelike wrapping that became the Kazuko signature.
