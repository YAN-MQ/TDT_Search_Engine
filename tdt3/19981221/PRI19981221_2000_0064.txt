For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in London. 
Israel is headed for early elections. Polls could take place in March 
or April after parliament passed draft legislation during fierce debate 
about the government's handling of the peace process with the Palestinians. 
Lise Doucet reports from Jerusalem. It was a roll call vote and one 
after another, the vast majority voted yes to new elections. Even 
the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, realized this was the only 
way forward. His fractious right-wing coalition had collapsed. His 
last-ditch appeal for a national unity government fell on deaf ears. 
The leader of the opposition Labor Party, Ehud Barak, said it was 
too late this government was finished. Mr. Netanyahu's speech to parliament 
was, in effect, his first election salvo. He was, he declared, the 
only leader tough enough to negotiate with the Palestinians. Lise 
Doucet, BBC, Jerusalem.
