Two former presidents have intervened to try to end impeachment proceedings 
against Bill Clinton. In a newspaper editorial, Gerald Ford and Jimmy 
Carter have offered a compromise plan that would severely censure 
him instead. From Washington, The World's Owen Faye reports. Under 
the proposal, Clinton would have to admit he lied under oath but would 
be exempt from criminal prosecution for doing so. The bipartisan censure 
plan is designed, in the words of the two men, to heal the jagged 
divisions tearing at America's national fabric. In the editorial, 
Carter and Ford noted the severe partisanship in the House which surrounded 
the impeachment voting and suggest that a Senate trial might be equally 
unpleasant. It remains to be seen if the plan is formally endorsed. 
President Clinton currently enjoys record high approval ratings and 
may opt to take his chances in the Senate. For The World, I'm Owen 
Faye in Washington.
