The latest attempt to fly around the world in a balloon is in question 
tonight. Richard Branson and Steve Fossett lifted off from Morocco 
on Friday, for a Trip they hoped would last about two weeks. They 
spent several hours today hovering over the Himalayas, waiting for 
permission to enter Chinese air space. Here's ABC's Sheila MacVicar. 
High above some of the most inhospitable terrain on the planet, the 
three balloonists came up against China's refusal to let them cross. 
Near the Chinese border, American Steve Fossett spoke to ABC News. 
We don't know whether they'll just let us pass through or whether 
they'll force us to land or whether they'll start shooting. So we're 
quite worried. The ground team said China had given permission to 
fly a narrow southern route, but detours to avoid Iraq and winds that 
would not cooperate brought the balloon too far north. Our options 
are very limited. In fact, practically none. We're unable to land 
here, because these are very high mountains. Late today, they did 
enter China, with no permission. And if Chinese authorities do demand 
that the balloonists land, they cannot come down safely until they 
clear these treacherous mountains. Sheila MacVicar, ABC News, London.
