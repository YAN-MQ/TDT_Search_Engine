One of Puerto Rico's largest dairy companies has fired 10 truck drivers 
who are facing federal charges of diluting milk with water and salt. 
Tres Monjitas Inc. fired six drivers on Friday and four others while 
federal prosecutors were investigating the charges, general manager 
Juan Corrada del Rio said in Monday's Primera Hora newspaper. On Friday, 
U.S. prosecutors indicted 20 dairy farmers, 12 truck drivers and seven 
administrators on charges they diluted milk shipments en route from 
farms to processing plants. The farmers allegedly paid drivers to 
thin the shipments with water and add salt so that they would pass 
tests based on milk's lower freezing point. Prosecutors claimed to 
have videotapes of workers diluting the milk. They said the mixture 
was harmless to consumers, and most of the shipments were stopped 
by U.S. agriculture inspectors. Tres Monjitas and its main competitor, 
Suiza Dairy, asked U.S. officials to investigate after detecting the 
diluted milk earlier this year.
