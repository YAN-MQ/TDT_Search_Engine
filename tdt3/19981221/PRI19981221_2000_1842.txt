Iraq has gone on the offensive, accusing Washington and London of 
criminal aggression and of lying about the true effect of recent military 
action against it. Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz said the 
vast majority of casualties were civilian and not military. But the 
U.S. commander in the Persian Gulf, General Anthony Zinni, says allied 
forces would never fire at civilian targets. We absolutely do not 
target those types of things. We take every care to ensure that civilian 
casualties are prevented to the best of our ability. No, I do not 
have any numbers of casualties. We do know, however, Republican Guard 
infrastructure -- barracks, command and control -- we have significantly 
destroyed, disrupted those facilities. General Zinni also said 74 
percent of the strikes were, in his words, "fully successful."
