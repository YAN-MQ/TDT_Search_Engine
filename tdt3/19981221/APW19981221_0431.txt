Ministry of Tourism officials met Monday with members of the Kenya 
Tourism Board after the board complained it was being sidelined in 
the campaign to win tourists back to Kenya, a ministry spokeswoman 
said. The row grew out of the failure of the tourism ministry to pass 
on 90 million shillings (dlrs 1.5 million) in operating funds to the 
board as well as the ministry's sending of its own people to Japan 
to promote tourism. The tourism board was set up to promote Kenya 
abroad. Tourism has been Kenya's second most important source of foreign 
currency earnings. Arrivals have been dropping steadily since 1990 
as competition from South Africa, Seychelles and Mauritius eats into 
the market. Meanwhile, Richard Leakey, director of The Kenya Wildlife 
Service, and a member of the tourism board, said told the independent 
Daily Nation to problem seemed to stem from the attempt by ministry 
officials to secure jobs they feel are threatened by the board's existence. 
Leakey also called for the abolition of tourist visas, saying the 
requirement put off potential visitors because it was ``cumbersome 
and costly.''
