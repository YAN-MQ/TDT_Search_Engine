BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union approved a deal Monday 
to cut emissions from heavy lorries by roughly 30 percent by the year 
2000 and by 50 percent by the year 2005, compared with current levels. 
EU environment ministers agreed on a 30 percent cut in particulates 
- the invisible specks of airborne dirt from traffic fumes that can 
get trapped in the lungs and cause severe damage to people's health. 
Ministers also agreed to curbs on hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide 
by 2000. Under the new rules, heavy lorries would have to be equipped 
with special exhaust filters from the year 2000. Ministers also discussed 
how best to dispose of used cars without polluting the environment. 
Austria's Environment Minister Martin Bartenstein, current chairman 
of the EU's environment council, said nine million vehicles are being 
decommissioned each year in the Union. Of that figure, 25 percent 
are considered as dangerous waste, he said.
