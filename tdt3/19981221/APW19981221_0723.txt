After years of pledging his loyalty, England striker Matt Le Tissier 
has threatened to leave Southampton if the south coast team gets relegated 
from the Premier League. With his team next to last in the standings, 
the 30-year-old striker, who has been at the The Dell since he started 
his career 13 years ago, said it would be very difficult for him to 
accept life in division one. ``I would put money on us staying up 
but then I have always liked a long shot,'' Le Tissier said on Monday. 
``I want to play in the Premier League for the whole of my career. 
That's the one thing I have always wanted to do. ``I think I'm good 
enough to play in the Premier League for the rest of my playing days 
and, of course, that's the place to be. It would be very difficult 
for me to play in the First Division.'' Le Tissier and Saints have 
fought off huge bids by clubs like Manchester United and Arsenal to 
lure away the talented striker, who has played eight times for England. 
But he feels he may have to move if the club is relegated. ``That 
is no disrespect to the players down there but I'd like to think I've 
got enough to offer in the Premier League to stay there,'' he said. 
``Obviously I don't know how I'll feel in the summer. Then when the 
situation arises I'll have to take all my feelings into consideration.''
