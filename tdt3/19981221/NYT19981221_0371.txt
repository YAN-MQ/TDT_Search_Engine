Stocks rose for a third consecutive session Monday, pushed higher 
by continued flows into popular large-capitalization issues and torrid 
demand for companies that do business on the Internet. Analysts and 
traders said that the House vote on Saturday to impeach President 
Clinton had virtually no effect on investors, who lifted the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock and Nasdaq composite indexes to record high 
closes Monday. ``The major issue is conviction, and the market seems 
to think that at most Mr. Clinton will be censured,'' said Ned Riley 
Jr., chief investment officer at BankBoston, who noted that the Federal 
Reserve chairman and the Treasury secretary, had more power to move 
markets. ``In terms of influence, the markets look at Alan Greenspan 
first, Bob Rubin second and Bill Clinton third,'' he said. A far more 
critical issue to most mutual fund managers, according to Riley and 
others, has been their failure to meet or surpass key benchmark market 
gauges this year. Trying to make up for lost time, many mutual funds 
during the last few sessions have been increasing their weightings 
in the stocks that have done the most to move those gauges to their 
current lofty levels. Heavy buying in a handful of big technolgy companies 
was instrumental in driving the S&AMP;P 500 and Nasdaq to new highs.. 
The S&AMP;P rose 14.81 points, or 1.25 percent, to 1,202.84. Nasdaq 
jumped 51.89 points, or 2.5 percent, to 2,138.03. For the year, Nasdaq 
is up nearly 36 percent, and it has risen 50.7 percent since its 52-week 
low on Oct. 8. By contrast, the 85.22-point gain in the Dow Jones 
industrial average seemed almost mundane. The Dow closed at 8,988.85, 
up about 1 percent. Five of the 30 stocks that make up the blue-chip 
index set records. Prices of smaller stocks also rose, but at a much 
more sedate pace. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks 
closed at 401.83, up 4.41 points, or 1.1 percent. ``This is primarily 
a big-cap rally, which suggests there is a certain amount of haste'' 
by mutual fund managers to get into the market, said Christine Callies, 
chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. Through 
Friday, the S&AMP;P 500 was up 22.5 percent for the year. But Riley 
noted the average growth and income mutual funds, and equity income 
mutual funds, are only up 9.5 percent. ``There is a huge disparity,'' 
he said. ``I believe there is a year-end rush to dress up portfolios 
to show that holdings of the S&AMP;P best performers are now in proportion 
to the weightings of those stocks in the index.'' Most popular are 
seven technology stocks that Riley said are responsible for nearly 
two-thirds of the 23.95 percent gain in the S&AMP;P 500 this year: 
Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Dell Computer, Cisco Systems, Lucent Technologies 
and MCI Worldcom. All of those issues gained more than a point Monday. 
For example, Microsoft jumped 2|, to 140 7/16. Cisco added 4\, to 
94 11/16. And Lucent was up 5|, to 104. I.B.M. was one of five Dow 
stocks to hit highs, climbing 4 13/16, to 176]. The other Dow stocks 
to post new records were AT&AMP;T, GE, Wal-Mart and McDonald's. Internet 
stocks soared again, driven by strongly positive comments from Mary 
Meeker, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst whose views on the business 
are respected by investors. In an interview with Barron's, Ms. Meeker 
said the sharp increase in Internet users over the last three years 
makes Internet stocks attractive. Among Internet companies, Amazon.com 
jumped 32 1/16, to 318}. Yahoo gained 30 9/16, to 242~. And Onsale 
Inc. gained 24 5/16, to 68. The apparent mania for Internet stocks 
also helped to lift the stocks of brokerage houses that offer discount 
trading over the Web. Shares of Charles Schwab, the largest online 
brokerage firm, rose 7 5/16, to 51 11/16. E-Trade Group, the second-biggest 
online broker, gained 4 13/16, to 32[. And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 
which owns Discover Brokerage Direct, gained 4 15/16, to 76 9/16. 
Other big winners Monday included Amgen, the world's leading biotechnology 
company. Amgen shares soard 12 3/16, to 100 5/16 after the company 
said it had won all rights to a once-a-week version of Epogen, its 
anemia drug, in an arbitration fight with Johnson &AMP; Johnson. Johnson 
&AMP; Johnson shares fell 2{, to 77. The strong performance of the 
stock market stood in stark relief to a poor performance by bonds. 
Before Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open 
Market Committee, prices of the government's benchmark 30-year bond 
fell by nearly a point and its yield rose to 5.06 percent from 5.00 
percent on Friday. ``Rather than worrying about Clinton, perhaps the 
more significant question is whether the performance of the bond market 
and the stock market can continue to diverge,'' said Ms. Callies of 
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``The market doesn't have a lot of support 
in terms of good corporate earnings.'' Three cuts in short-term interest 
rates by the Fed since late September have been instrumental in the 
stock market's remarkable recovery. But most analysts do not expect 
the Fed to cut further until it sees additional signs of weakness 
in the economy.
