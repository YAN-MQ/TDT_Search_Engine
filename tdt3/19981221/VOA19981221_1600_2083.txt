the Angolan rebel group, UNITA, says troops from Namibia and Zimbabwe 
have joined the Angolan government's offensive against UNITA. A statement 
from UNITA says soldiers from the two countries joined the fighting 
on Friday. There was no immediate comment from the Angolan government 
but Namibia and Zimbabwe denied the UNITA allegation. The UNITA statement 
appeals to all Angolan patriots to resist what it calls "The challenge 
to our dignity presented by foreign troops."
