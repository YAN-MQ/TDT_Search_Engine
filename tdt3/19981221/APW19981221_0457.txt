Lebanon's new government on Monday lifted a five-year ban on public 
demonstrations. The Cabinet _ in its first meeting since Prime Minister 
Salim Hoss' government won a vote of confidence last week _ also named 
a new commander for the country's 65,000-strong army, according to 
Information Minister Anwar Khalil. He is Brig. Gen. Michel Suleiman, 
a Maronite Catholic, who most recently commanded forces in southern 
Lebanon. Suleiman, 50, replaces Gen. Emile Lahoud, who was elected 
by Parliament as Lebanon's president on Oct. 15. The ban on street 
protests _ which had often turned violent _ had been in place since 
September 1993. It was imposed after nine people were killed in clashes 
between troops and militant Muslims protesting the first Palestinian-Israeli 
peace accord. In 1992, street riots amid an economic crisis forced 
the resignation of then-Prime Minister Omar Karami. Khalil said demonstrations 
would be allowed, but only with Interior Ministry approval. The Cabinet's 
decision was ``in line with the government's policy of protecting 
freedoms, particularly the freedom of expression,'' Khalil said. The 
previous government of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri repeatedly banned 
protests and, on occasion, sent the army into the streets to prevent 
labor unions from staging protests against Hariri's economic policies. 
Suleiman, the new commander, joined the army in 1967. In recent years, 
he commanded the estimated 12,000 troops stationed along Israel's 
self-styled ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon. The choice respected 
a tradition that the army commander be a Maronite under Lebanon's 
power-sharing formula among its 18 religious sects. Lahoud has pledged 
to try to do away with some of the sectarian-based allocation of powers, 
and one of the appointments Monday reflected this. The Cabinet appointed 
army Brig. Jamil Sayyed, a Shiite Muslim, as head of the General Security 
Department, which handles foreign residents, publications and passports. 
That post traditionally was held by a Maronite. Brig. Edward Mansour, 
a Melchite Catholic, was named chief of the State Security Department, 
an internal security organ which normally went to a Shiite. Brig. 
Hassan Fawaz, a Shiite, was appointed Mansour's deputy. Abdul-Karim 
Mansour, a Sunni Muslim, became director general of the Internal Security 
Forces, and Brig. Nasser Rahban, a Maronite, was named commander of 
the Gendarmerie police force. Col. Raymond Azar, a Maronite, was made 
chief of Army Intelligence, the Cabinet announcement said.
