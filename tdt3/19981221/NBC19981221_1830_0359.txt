And when this year began, Newt Gingrich was the powerful speaker of 
the house and then was replaced by Bob Livingston of Louisiana. Now 
he's gone, as the result of extramarital afars. And he will likely 
will beplaced by whom? NBC's Gwen Ifill. Dennis Hastert's profile 
is so low, most Americans have no idea who he is. But republicans 
say the former wrestler is just the coach they need to fix a broken 
house republican caucus. I really didn't seek this at all. It just 
kind of happened. I think we need to bring our conference together. 
We need to heal the wounds. We need to reach out across the aisle. 
He is no Newt Gingrich revolutionary. But, shell-shocked republicans 
say, he is also no Bob Livingston, the gingrich successor who quit 
after acknowledging he'd been unfaithful to his wife. I've been happily 
married for 26 years. Married to Jean, a middle school teacher who 
stays behind in the family's small-town Illinois home when Hastert 
leaves every week for washington. Allies say Hastert is a fixer who 
can talk to democrats and heal house republicans, now rocked with 
internal strife. The members wanted someone that they know was solid, 
a man of integrity. He had no personal problems, but also could lead 
this team with a very narrow majority. Hastert, for years, a trusted 
republican vote counter, now poised to seize a job that places him 
third in line to the presidency. At home in Illinois, longtime friends 
and constituents praised the choice. Go Denny! Hastert's first campaign 
manager says his regular-guy qualities will serve him well. Denny 
has a great amount of patience and is able to exercise that by letting 
people talk it out. Hastert's chief Ally -- powerful majority whip 
Tom delay. Within hours of Livingston's announcement, delay locked 
up votes for hastert, locking out competition. But confrontation is 
not in Hastert's game plan. His first task will be a big one -- to 
get past impeachment, past scandal, and get the house back on track. 
Gwen Ifill, NBC news, the capital.
