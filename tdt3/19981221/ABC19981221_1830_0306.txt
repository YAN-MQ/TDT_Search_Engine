The other big much more personal story of the day, in Houston, the 
world's first surviving octuplets are struggling to survive tonight. 
Octuplets, as in eight. The six girls and two boys are in critical, 
but stable condition. Their mother had been taking fertility drugs. 
She went without food late in her pregnancy to make extra room for 
the babies to grow. "A remarkable woman," her doctor said. Here's 
ABC's Jane Clayson. Doctors at Texas children's hospital say 27-year-old 
nkem chukwu is just relieved her children are alive, even though they're 
in critical condition. I walked in and I said, "how are you doing, 
nkem?" And she said, "I'm blessed." So I know she's doing well. The 
first child was born two weeks ago. Doctors used drugs to stop the 
other seven from coming, until yesterday, when an assembly line of 
40 doctors and nurses delivered the babies by cesarean section, in 
just under 3 minutes. The babies weigh between 11 ounces and just 
under 2 pounds. Doctors say, they have an 85% chance of surviving 
various complications. Initially, lung problems. The next issue will 
be blood pressure problems, then potential heart problems. Nkem chukwu 
left her home in Houston two and a half months ago to be hospitalized. 
She spent some of that time lying at a steep, uncomfortable incline, 
to lessen the pressure of 25 pounds of baby weight. It was quite remarkable 
that she was able to live in an upside down position with her head 
lower than her feet for over two weeks. The chukwu's are Americans, 
originally from Nigeria. He is a respiratory therapist. Doctors say 
the couple is deeply religious and never considered aborting one or 
two of the fetuses to give the others a better chance. The mother 
of the only known octuplets may go home this week. Her babies will 
stay here well into the new year. Jane Clayson, ABC News, Houston.
