The European Union announced Monday that it will provide financial 
aid to Southeast Asian nations to strengthen the enforcement of local 
laws protecting intellectual property. The EU said in a statement 
that the 5 million euro (dlrs 5.5 million) program, a joint project 
with Thailand, will provide training for police, customs and justice 
authorities in the region to meet World Trade Organization standards 
on property rights. The five-year program will include technology 
transfers to upgrade the enforcement system in line with EU standards.
