U.S. treasury made a mistake. The department discovered it's been 
paying social security and other trust funds hundreds of millions 
of dollars a year in extra interest. The error dates back 20 years 
ago when calculations were switched from paper to computer. The estimated 
amount of money that's been credited to social security, $1.4 billion. 
Treasury secretary Robert Rubin plans to reduce interest payments 
but not enough to change when social security funds run out of money.
