The United States and Britain are warning Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 
they will seek more U.N. sanctions against his country if the Lockerbie 
bombing suspects are not turned over. Last week, Libya's parliament 
approved a trial in the Netherlands, but said some obstacles must 
be overcome before the two men are handed over. The U.N. security 
council is scheduled to review Libyan sanctions in february.
