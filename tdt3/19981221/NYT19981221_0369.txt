In a setback for computer users looking for deep pockets to help pay 
the cost of dealing with year 2000 problems, J. Baker, an apparel 
retailer, has dropped its claim that Andersen Consulting, the designer 
of a computer system Baker installed in 1991, is liable for the system's 
year 2000 defects. Baker had been threatening to sue New York-based 
Andersen when the consulting company instead rushed to a Massachusetts 
state court in August asking for a ruling that there was no basis 
for such a suit. The contract said nothing about the year 2000. Baker 
said Monday that as a result of a mediator's report backing Andersen 
it had agreed that Andersen owed it nothing for year 2000 repairs. 
Andersen is dropping its request for a state court ruling. Baker, 
based in Canton, Mass., operates several retail clothing chains, including 
Casual Male Big and Tall.
