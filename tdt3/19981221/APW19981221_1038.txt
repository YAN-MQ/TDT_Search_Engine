With the mournful lament of bagpipes and prayers of healing, the people 
of Lockerbie paid tribute to the 270 people killed when a bomb brought 
Pan Am Flight 103 crashing down on this tiny town 10 years ago Monday. 
The hundreds who packed Dryfesdale Parish Church heard messages from 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
who renewed their vows to punish the culprits who hid the bomb in 
a suitcase on Dec. 21, 1988. But they also heard quiet sobs that echoed 
throughout the century-old church as a few moments of silence were 
observed before the bagpiper blew her lament. ``In the lives that 
were lost, some very young, there was meaning and achievement,'' the 
Rev. David Almond told the gathering of about 600 people, which included 
60 family members of those who perished. ``Our task in commemoration 
is to continue that meaning and to build on that achievement.'' The 
congregation heard the children of the local elementary school sing 
a tribute, ``Let There be Love,'' as well as a message from the queen. 
``We pray on this anniversary that the families will find solace together 
in quiet remembrance across the world,'' the queen's message said. 
In a separate service in London's Westminster Abbey, attended by Blair, 
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Prince Andrew, the second son of 
Queen Elizabeth II, hundreds listened as one-by-one the names of the 
259 passengers and crew and 11 of Lockerbie's own residents were read 
out as a candle was lit for each. Simultaneous services, graf 8 pvs
