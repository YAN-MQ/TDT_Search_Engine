Two prominent Chinese dissidents have received long prison sentences 
for subversion -- 11 and 13 years in jail. They're both founders of 
the Independent China Democracy Party. American embassy spokesman 
in Beijing Tom Cooney says the verdict is deplorable. We are deeply 
disappointed with both the guilty verdicts and the extremely harsh 
sentences. No individual should be arrested, tried or sentenced for 
exercising internationally recognized freedoms. We hope these deplorable 
decisions will not be allowed to stand. Chinese authorities have dismissed 
foreign criticism as interference. They're vowing tough action against 
dissidents.
