Double Olympic champion Hermann Maier led a historical Austrian sweep 
of the top nine places in Monday's World Cup Super-G at the legendary 
Patscherkofel course. Never before in World Cup history skiers from 
the same country had finished 1-9 in men's or women's races. Maier's 
victory and the team triumph at the home course which hosted the 1976 
Olympics definitely restored the prestige of Austria's ``Power Team'' 
coming from three consecutive setbacks. ``The Herminator'' clocked 
an unbeatable time of one minute, 23.52 seconds down the 1,947-meter 
long course, dropping 570 meters. Christian Mayer and Fritz Strobl 
placed second and third respectively for the all-Austrian podium in 
the third super giant slalom race of the season. Mayer trailed the 
winner by 0.76 seconds. Strobl was one hundredth of a second back. 
The race, started 65 minutes late because fog had initially hampered 
visibility, looked like the Austrian national championships as also 
late starters such Patrick Wirth and Werner Franz beat skiers from 
the ``rest of the world'' for the sensational 1-9 finish. The previous 
best team showing dated back to 1968, when French women finished 1-6 
in a downhill race at Abetone, Italy. Austrian skiers already had 
swept the top five places in a Super-G at Aspen, Colo. last month. 
Norway's Lasse Paulsen was the first of the non-Austrian finishers 
in tenth place, with an impressive gap of 1.01 seconds. Maier's third 
season victory _ the 13th of his World Cup career - vaulted the strongly-built 
Austrian skier atop the overall standings with 540 points after 12 
races. Norway's Lasse Kjus, who had entered Monday's race as overall 
leader, slipped to second place. Maier, twice fourth in the two previous 
races in Val Gardena and Alta Badia, made acrobatics to avoid a spill 
at mid course, when he hit the snow with a hand while clearing a gate. 
``It was a sensational race for me and for the team. We need more 
races like this ... I skied miles away from the ideal line and I struggled 
to win on this track, as Klammer did to achieve his Olympic victory,'' 
Maier said. Franz Klammer, who won the Olympic downhill title at this 
course, was at the finish line to congratulate his fellow-countrymen 
for their impressive showing. The home skiers were cheered by a huge 
crowd, including hundreds of children as classes in the Innsbruck 
area were closed for the race. ``The course was perfect, and the fans 
gave me a big boost,'' Maier said. The men's World Cup continues at 
Bormio, northern Italy, with a downhill on Dec. 29.
