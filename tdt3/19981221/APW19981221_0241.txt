Fuel prices doubled overnight in Nigeria, where motorists awoke Monday 
to find gasoline had shot up from 12 cents per liter to about 29 cents. 
The sudden increase in the cost of fuel comes despite continued assurances 
by Nigeria's ruling military government that gasoline prices would 
not be hiked. Kerosene, which is used by most Nigerians as cooking 
fuel, jumped from 10 cents per liter to 27 cents. Diesel and aviation 
fuel were subjected to similar increases. There was no immediate explanation 
from the government on the increase, but one senior administration 
official told The Associated Press the change was the result of market 
forces. ``Oil companies have been given a free hand to adjust prices 
without interference,'' the official said on condition of anonymity. 
``The increase is purely on the basis of market forces.'' Although 
Nigeria is one of world's largest oil producing countries, it is a 
net importer of refined fuel. All four of Nigeria's refineries sit 
idle due to disrepair. Chronic fuel shortages plague Nigeria, Africa's 
most populous nation, and black marketeers often fill the void with 
vastly overpriced gasoline and kerosene smuggled in from neighboring 
countries. As part of a larger effort to alleviate the country's fuel 
problems, the government has broken the state-controlled National 
Petroleum Corporation's stranglehold on the domestic market. Foreign 
and domestic oil companies can now import and distribute refined petroleum 
products to meet the domestic shortfall. Nigeria's military leader 
Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has made it a priority to rehabilitate the 
country's refining capability, which when fully operative has a 425,000 
barrel daily capacity. Abubakar took control of Nigeria after the 
death of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died in June reportedly of 
a heart attack. Abubakar has been working to liberalize Nigeria and 
hand power over to a civilian government next year.
