BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British airstrikes killed 62 soldiers, 
demolished key Iraqi factories used to produce missile parts and severed 
phone lines between the north and south, Iraqi officials said Monday. 
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said civilian casualties were ``much, 
much higher,'' but refused to give details. Iraq earlier said that 
42 people were killed in the four nights of airstrikes. The attacks 
targeted key military bases, government buildings, communication centers 
and factories that could be used to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. 
Iraq says the missiles also struck colleges, post offices, dormitories, 
a museum and an oil refinery. ``They want to ... strip Iraq of any 
serious industrial capabilities,'' Aziz said. ``This is a policy of 
hatred.'' But he added that the United States and Britain failed to 
seriously harm the Iraqi government or military. ``They boasted of 
great success ... They lied,'' Aziz said at a news conference in Baghdad. 
The Republican Guard, the country's elite fighting force and a main 
target of the attacks, lost 20 soldiers, he said. Eighteen soldiers 
of the Special Republican Guard and 24 soldiers in other branches 
of the military were also killed, he said. A total of 180 soldiers 
were injured, he said. But most of the strikes hit empty barracks, 
Aziz said, adding that ``these barracks could be and will be rebuilt.' 
In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the airstrikes have 
set back parts of Iraq's ``military infrastructure several years.'' 
A spokesman for Blair, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 
targets included 20 command and control facilities and nine sites 
linked to the Republican Guard. Aziz confirmed Monday that the strikes, 
which devastated telephone centers in the southern city of Basra, 
has severely disrupted communication between the largely Shiite Muslim 
south and the predominantly Sunni Muslim north of the country. The 
south rose in rebellion following the 1991 Gulf War. The uprising 
was crushed by troops loyal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Aziz 
dismissed claims that the recent attacks could lead to another rebellion. 
``They thought, foolishly, that when they sent a few hundred missiles 
against Iraq that the people of Iraq would rise up against their leadership,'' 
he said. ``This is fantasy.'' The attacks heavily damaged factories 
that could be used to produce weapons of mass destruction or long-range 
missiles. Those sites included the al-Nasser factory in Taji, 60 kilometers 
(40 miles) north of Baghdad and the al-Nida factory, south of the 
capital, Iraqi officials said. Both factories produced short-range 
missiles that are not banned by U.N. resolutions. U.N. weapons monitors 
closely monitor both factories to ensure that they are not used to 
build components for rockets with ranges beyond 150 kilometers (90 
miles). Iraqi officials said that the speed of the attacks took them 
by surprise and workers did not have enough time to remove crucial 
equipment before the factories were attacked. The officials spoke 
on customary condition of anonymity. The United States and Britain 
began the attacks shortly after chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard 
Butler accused Iraq of failing to fully cooperate with the inspectors. 
Al-Nasser was heavily bombed during the 1991 Gulf War but workers 
had removed most of the high-tech lathes before the attacks. The U.N. 
weapons monitors had 12 remote-control monitoring cameras at al-Nasser. 
The U.N. weapons teams are responsible for dismantling Iraq's programs 
to build chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and missiles with 
ranges in excess of 150 kilometers (90 miles). Aziz said that Baghdad 
will not allow the monitors to return. ``The weapons inspectors were 
killed by the American missiles,'' he said. ``I cannot give them another 
life.'' He added that the United States and Britain must be condemned 
and held accountable for the attack and U.N. sanctions must be lifted. 
``Without that, it would be difficult for Iraq to talk,'' he said. 
The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Security 
Council diplomats have said that they will not be lifted until Iraq 
fully cooperates with U.N. weapons inspectors.
