Well, Wall Street is off to a good start for the week, with the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average closing at 8988, that was up 85 points, almost 
one percent. Standard and Poors 500 Index closed up 14 points to a 
record high, 1202. And the NASDAQ Index also closed at a record high 
for the second straight session. Analysts say the weekend Impeachment 
of President Clinton had absolutely no impact on the stock market, 
because the action was expected. Expected events usually do not move 
stock prices. Instead many traders embarked on an end of year buying 
spree, confident that stocks will continue to rally into next year. 
But a less positive view came from the International Monetary Fund, 
which expects the rate of economic growth is going to slow next year 
from about 3.5 percent to less than 2 percent. In a report issued 
today, the IMF also says there is a possibility of what it calls, 
a renewed correction in US stock prices sometime next year. But, as 
I say, today was all-positive. Once again, Dow Jones closing up 85 
points. This is Breck Artery. Thanks Breck.
