Police in Italy have arrested about 20 Albanians, accusing them of 
bringing children into the country illegally and forcing them to beg 
on the streets. Twenty Albanian children aged between 13 and 17 were 
found living in an abandoned factory on the outskirts of Milan. They 
were kept in primitive conditions. The children told the police they 
were beaten and tortured. From the BBC newsroom in London, this is 
Pamela McCall for The World.
