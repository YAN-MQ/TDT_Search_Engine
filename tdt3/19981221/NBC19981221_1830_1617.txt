Rarely has there been such a disconnect between where America lives 
and works and what happens inside the Beltway around the nation's 
capital. Here we have only the second president in the nation's history 
impeached, and the country is not happy with those who did the impeaching. 
NBC's Jim Avila tonight. 'tis the season for anything but scandal. 
America likes its politicians quiet and out of the way this time of 
the year. Its very surreal. And it puts a real damper on the holiday 
season. Because people are thinking of stuff they don't ordinarily 
have to think about. Across the country, from New York City Christmas 
shoppers -- It has kind of taken a little bit away from the holiday 
spirit. To the boardwalk along L.A.'s Venice beach -- I'd like to 
see the process go as quickly as possible, so we can get on with our 
lives. America wants Christmas carols uninterrupted by political scandal. 
Mitch Clark raises show horses in Danville, Kentucky. He blames President 
Clinton, wants him to resign. But mostly he's had enough. I'm a little 
disappointed that this much attention has been brought on the office 
of the presidency. Quite frankly, it's embarrassing for America. In 
fact, two-thirds of Americans polled by NBC news say they don't want 
a trial. Most are looking for a quick compromise or to drop the matter 
entirely. Northwestern political science professor Kenneth janda says 
the American public thinks Congress acted contrary to the season. 
Why don't they just go home and have Christmas and then start afresh 
with a Clear mind, and maybe with a little more good will toward men. 
And back in Danville, where a respectable 60% of the registered voters 
turned out in 1996, there's no apathy. Tobacco farmers just have a 
lot more on their minds than the president's efforts to cover up an 
affair. His dropping his pants with someone in the White House is 
not going to effect my bottom line. Here, many think too much time 
and money has been wasted. $10,000 a dang minute -- spend that on 
the old people. Annoyed by presidential misconduct and bitter congressional 
politics, the message from the heartland is "enough already." Jim 
Avila, NBC news, Chicago.
