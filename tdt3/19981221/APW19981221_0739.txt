A storm of opposition from both foes and friends of the new peace 
accord brought Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government 
to the brink of collapse Monday. Netanyahu, backed into a political 
corner, was expected to agree to dissolve his government and call 
early elections to seek a public mandate for his policies. Israel's 
divided Knesset, or parliament, convened Monday evening for what was 
expected to be lengthy debate on the faltering Wye River land-for-security 
peace accord and prime minister's hardline stance toward the Palestinians. 
Early on, Netanyahu briefly addressed lawmakers and was heckled by 
a right-wing lawmaker when he referred to terms for an Israeli pullback 
from the West Bank. Netanyahu said that if the Knesset failed to back 
his withdrawal terms, he would back an early elections bill also scheduled 
for a vote on Monday. ``Most of the country supports our policies,'' 
Netanyahu said. ``If the Knesset doesn't support them, we will turn 
to the people and ask them to support it.'' He indicated he would 
consult with the opposition on an appropriate date for elections in 
that case. Netanyahu's speech sounded like a campaign opener: ``The 
way to reach true peace is to maintain demands that Palestinians carry 
out their obligations, that way we will protect peace, security and 
Jerusalem.'' Ehud Barak, the leader of the opposition Labor party, 
outlined a platform addressing Israel's sagging economy. ``This government 
divided Israel and gave into the extremists _ at the expense of education, 
of employment, of true security for all,'' he said. The head of each 
parliamentary faction was to speak for five minutes, and then Netanyahu's 
peace polices would go to a vote.
