BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Monday it will continue 
to press for a World Trade Organization solution to its banana dispute 
with the United States, even after Washington unveils a list of EU 
goods subject to stiff trade sanctions. Nigel Gardner, spokesman for 
the EU's Foreign Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan, said the EU will 
not impose sanctions against Washington. Instead, the EU will ``move 
quickly towards establishing a (WTO) panel.'' ``We believe we have 
a very strong case in the WTO because the U.S. sanctions are unilateral 
and therefore are illegal,'' Gardner said. The United States is expected 
to publish later Monday a list of EU products threatened with 100 
percent import tariffs in protest at the EU's banana import regime 
which Washington feels violates free trade rules. The U.S. sanctions 
would only go into effect from March 3, for procedural reasons, Gardner 
said. Gardner said the EU Commission will request an arbitration panel 
at the WTO to assess the legality of the so-called 301 trade laws 
in the United States. These laws allow the U.S. government to determine 
whether its trade partners are unfairly protecting their markets, 
and to impose retaliatory measures. The EU and the United States often 
bicker over trade issues and regularly accuse each other of protectionnism. 
In this particular case, Washington claims the EU's banana import 
system unfairly favors imports from former European colonies. The 
United States argues the EU has not done enough to fall in line with 
a WTO verdict last year which ruled against the EU's favorable treatment 
of a number of African, Caribbean, and Pacific region countries. The 
EU says it approved new import regulations to comply with WTO demands, 
but the United States and Central and South American banana producers 
claim its banana import regime is still discriminatory.
