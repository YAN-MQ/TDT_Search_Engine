I'll be right back with the view of what's going on in Washington, 
from the rest of America. Trains now go 300 miles an hour. Mail, 3000 
miles a second. Athletes continually break records. So how come pain 
relief isn't faster? Introducing Advil liqui-gels-- the first and 
only pain reliever... in a Faster-acting liquid-filled capsule... 
that's gentle on your stomach. On tough pain, Advil liqui-gels are 
stronger and faster... than extra strength Tylenol. Headaches to muscle 
aches, new Advil liqui-gels. Just got faster. I work out to keep my 
body in shape. To help keep my mind sharp I take new uanterra ginkgo 
biloba. It helps me concentrate, maintain focus. Why quanterra? All 
ginkgos aren't the same. The patented quanterra extract was proven 
safe and effective by doctors in extensive clinical trials. And it 
increases oxygen supply to the brain. With new quanterra mental sharpness 
I feel my best, naturally.
