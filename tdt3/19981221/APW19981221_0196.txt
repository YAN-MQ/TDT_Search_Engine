The four parties of Slovakia's coalition government won six out of 
eight mayoral posts in the country's largest cities in municipal elections 
last week, local media reported Monday. Government candidate and former 
prime minister Jozef Moravcik was elected mayor of the Slovak capital 
Bratislava, according to initial unofficial results released in papers 
Monday. Rudolf Schuster, who the government is also supporting in 
presidential elections next year, was reelected mayor of the country's 
second largest city, Kosice. Three top representatives of the nationalistic 
Slovak National Party, including the party chairman and vice-chairman, 
also won mayoral posts. Party chairman Jan Slota, the new mayor of 
Zilina, is well-known for his anti-minority orientation. The Dec. 
18-19 municipal elections were held with no major problems or disturbances, 
the Central Election Commission said Monday. Official final results 
are to be announced on Tuesday.
