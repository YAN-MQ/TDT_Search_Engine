With their latest accord with Israel already frozen, Palestinian officials 
view Israel's early elections as a gamble that holds out a prospect 
for change but insures a deepening peace stalemate in the meantime. 
There was a strong sense among lawmakers gathered here Monday for 
a session of the Palestinian Legislative Council that peace efforts 
between Israel and the Palestinians have once again become subject 
to the vagaries of Israeli domestic politics. Courting the right's 
support before the Israeli legislature voted on new elections Monday, 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured Cabinet approval on Sunday 
for a series of conditions for further troop withdrawals in the West 
Bank, effectively suspending the land-for-security accord signed on 
Oct. 23 in Washington. Chief among those conditions was a demand that 
the Palestinian Authority ``abandon its intention to unilaterally 
declare a Palestinian state'' on May 4, 1999, when the interim self-rule 
agreements expire. Other demands include an end to incitement and 
violence, collection of illegal weapons and acceptance of Israel's 
terms for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Netanyahu contends 
that he simply wants an end to Palestinian violations of the agreement. 
But to Palestinian ears his conditions _ the platform for his call 
for new elections _ are excuses to renege on the accord, boding ill 
for the coming months even though Netanyahu might ultimately be unseated. 
Some Palestinian officials expect a deepening diplomatic paralysis 
as the Israelis become embroiled in an election campaign and Netanyahu 
stakes out tough positions to garner votes from the right. ``He should 
not kidnap the peace process as a hostage to achieve what he is planning,'' 
said Ahmed Qurei, known as Abu Ala, speaker of the legislative council 
and an architect of the 1993 Oslo peace accords with Israel. ``No 
doubt this election will freeze the agreement and it will be very 
dangerous,'' Qurei said. ``We are waiting for May 4. This is the last 
chance for this agreement.'' With Netanyahu effectively suspending 
the latest accord, the announced intention by Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat to declare a state on May 4 has given the Palestinians potent 
diplomatic leverage, eliciting dire warnings from Netanyahu and injecting 
a sense of urgency into the peace effort. Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian 
negotiator, warned that stagnation could have grave consequences. 
``Mr. Netanyahu is trying to gather the right wing around him and 
he has already decided to freeze the peace process,'' said Erekat, 
``but how can we survive the next months with settlements, and confiscation 
of land? He is turning the Palestinians into enemies as a theme in 
his election campaign. He is creating a pressure-cooker situation 
on the ground.'' Other lawmakers, however, saw an opportunity in the 
elections, noting that Netanyahu had already halted the latest agreement 
anyway. ``Even if there were no elections, the process is frozen,'' 
said Ziyad Abu Zayyad, a Palestinian lawmaker from Jerusalem. ``I 
would rather see new elections, because maybe they will bring a change.'' 
Hanan Ashrawi, a former Palestinian cabinet minister, said: ``This 
is not bad news. It is a test for the Israeli people whether they 
will cast a vote for peace or for consolidation of the extreme right-wing 
hold on the Israeli body politic.'' Palestinian officials assert that 
the Israeli government is bound by the latest accord, regardless of 
any election campaign. They maintain that despite Netanyahu's accusations 
to the contrary, they have kept their part of the agreement. They 
point out that articles of the Palestine Liberation Organization charter 
calling for the destruction of Israel have been revoked, that decrees 
have been issued against incitement and illegal weapons, and that 
suspects wanted by Israel have been jailed. Israel, meanwhile, did 
not carry out a further West Bank withdrawal that was supposed to 
have occurred last Friday. Salah Taamari, a legislator from the Bethlehem 
area, said he sought to avoid potentially false hopes that Netanyahu 
would be defeated. ``We can't afford the luxury of waiting to see 
if the Labor Party will win,'' Taamari said, referring to the Israeli 
party under whose leadership the Oslo agreement was reached. ``It 
all depends on what happens on the ground in these few months. How 
much land are we going to lose? How many lives are we going to lose?''
