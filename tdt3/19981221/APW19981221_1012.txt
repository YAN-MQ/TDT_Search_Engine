Slumped in his seat at the Knesset head table, Netanyahu cast a vote 
for the elections bill moved by the opposition Labor Party. Netanyahu 
had struggled to keep his government afloat in the two months since 
returning from the Israeli-Palestinian summit in Wye River, Maryland, 
with a new land-for-security peace agreement with the Palestinians. 
Hard-liners opposed to further concessions to the Palestinians defected 
from Netanyahu's government. He sought _ and received _ tacit support 
from the Labor Party in order to sustain the peace agreement. But 
he lost Labor when he froze implementation of the Israeli commitments 
under the accord, after accusing the Palestinians of sabotaging it.
