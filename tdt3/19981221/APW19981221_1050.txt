President Miguel Angel Rodriguez expressed frustration Monday at the 
escape from prison of an Israeli-Panamanian citizen wanted on money 
laundering charges in the United States. ``I feel very ashamed by 
this. We look like fools,'' Rodriguez told reporters at his office. 
Josef Mordok escaped from a prison in San Jose on Wednesday, after 
a man presented prison officials with false documents supposedly ordering 
Mordok's release. The U.S. government last week turned over documents 
to support the extradition of Mordok, who is wanted on charges of 
laundering some dlrs 100 million from drug trafficking. Rodriguez 
said he worried that the case ``could affect diplomatic relations'' 
with the United States. He said judicial officials had not yet fully 
explained the circumstances of the escape.
