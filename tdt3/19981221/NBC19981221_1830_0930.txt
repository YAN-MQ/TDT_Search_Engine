NBC news "in depth" tonight -- a rare and stunning event, eight babies 
born to one mother -- octuplets. It happened in Texas to a woman who 
had been taking fertility drugs. Tonight, her eight babies are hanging 
on to life. NBC's Jim Cummins begins our "in depth" reporting. The 
Texas octuplets, six girls and two boys, remain in critical condition 
tonight at this neonatal icu. Pediatrician Patti savrick says the 
big worry now, their lungs, small and weak. These babies are critically 
ill. And we do have a lot of hurdles to get over. And there's going 
to be some UPS and Downs in that critical course over the first week 
or two, essentially. Baby "A," the first born, 12 days before the 
others, is off a Ventilator and is doing better. After the first one 
was born, the babies aligned themselves in such a Position that ultrasound 
was now able to see that there was seven remaining babies. The challenge 
-- delaying labor so the other seven can survive. Their mother, nkem 
chukwu, rests upside down to relieve pressure on her lower body and 
is fed through an IV, no solid food to leave room for the babies. 
Until Sunday, when the seven other babies arrive within seconds of 
each other in this delivery room jammed with 30 doctors and other 
medical specialists. Earlier, doctors had asked the mother if she 
wanted to abort any of the fetuses to improve the odds for the others. 
Mom has very strong religious beliefs. And this is not something she 
would entertain. Tonight, all eight struggle to survive. But Dr. savrick 
is most concerned about baby "E," a girl, the smallest, who weighs 
less than 11 ounces. This baby is quite small. She would easily fit 
into the palm of my hand, especially if she had her arms and legs 
coiled up. For now, the parents refuse to be interviewed or to release 
any pictures of their eight babies, making medical history. Jim Cummins, 
NBC news, Dallas.
