There's a school where the toughest courses are the most popular, 
lectures are a joy, and no one ever cuts class. This renowned institution 
is the Nicklaus flick golf school. Can you feel that? Yeah. Where 
the faculty is unparalleled... your elbow softer. And the dean has 
6 masters. People might confuse you for a golfer. When you go, bring 
your visa card. Because at the Nicklaus flick golf school, they don't 
take American express. Ooh, yeah! You've done your homework. Visa... 
it started as a vacation, grew into a passion... and eventually led 
to a career. But you had your challenges along the way... like keeping 
an international organization focused and motivated... or structuring 
the acquisition of a Key competitor. At Arthur Andersen, we help people 
make those kinds of decisions, and that helps them focus on whatever 
it is that got them wherever they are.
