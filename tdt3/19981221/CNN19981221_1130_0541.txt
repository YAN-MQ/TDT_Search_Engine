Doctors in Houston, Texas, are caring for the first-known set of surviving 
octuplets. A 27-year-old woman gave birth five boys and two girls 
this morning, all by cesarean section. Another girl was born naturally 
on December 8th, 12 weeks premature. The seven born today were ten 
weeks premature. Doctors say the babies range from 11 ounces to 1 
pound, 11 ounces. All eight are listed in critical condition. The 
octoplets born in Texas face serious challenges to their survival 
since they were born premature. Dr. Steve Salvatore has more. In the 
case of multiple births, there are two concerns. The health of the 
mother, which has traditionally always been the number one priority, 
and the health and survival of the fetuses. There is one problem, 
however, the human body is not designed to carry multiple pregnancies, 
so the odds of developing complications is high. When you get up to 
these high order multiple pregnancies, the uterus is so large, it 
is unusual to keep a pregnancy to the point where you deliver and 
the baby's become able to survive. Now that the octuplets have been 
born, some of the greatest challenges they'll be facing will be in 
the first 24 to 48 hours after birth. Initial problems that we run 
into in the first few days are lung problems, heart and lung problems. 
Once we get through the lung and the heart problems, the next problems 
we run into are what we call metabolic problems, sugar, water and 
salt. Doctors will be closely monitoring the babies' blood pressure 
to check for possible shock, and blood count for anemia. They will 
also be monitoring "blood gases" to make sure the lungs are providing 
enough oxygen. The chances of survival of the fetuses increases dramatically 
after 28 weeks. Breathing on their own will be an extremely big deal. 
All the babies in general we would look for when they reach air, when 
they came off oxygen, when they came off vent later support and when 
they would then start eating. And the bigger the babies are at birth, 
the better their chances for survival. For now, it's just one day 
at a time. Dr. Steve Salvatore, CNN, New York.
