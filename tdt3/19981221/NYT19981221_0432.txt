Headline sizes seen two or three times in a generation were on display 
Sunday in the United States' major newspapers, as editors and reporters 
strove to make their coverage match, in its sweep, its depth and its 
manner, the gravity of the second impeachment of a president in American 
history. And few if any renditions of the stark word ``impeached'' 
were larger than the one used by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which 
featured type 2 3/4 inches deep. Beyond the sheer size of its typeface, 
The Post-Dispatch distinguished itself by reserving its entire front 
page for a narrative essay written out of St. Louis, prompting strong 
objections from all five members of the newspaper's Washington bureau. 
Among other things, they objected to the writer's failure to disclose 
that he was basing his information largely on televised coverage of 
the debate and was not on the scene. The essay, by senior staff writer 
Harry Levins, began, ``New York Democrat Charles Rangel rose Saturday 
to utter one of the rare sentences on which both sides of the House 
of Representatives could agree: `Mr. Speaker, the whole world is watching.''' 
In studied contrast to traditional news-writing style, which calls 
for the most important information to be billboarded at the top of 
an article, the essay did not mention President Clinton's name until 
the fifth paragraph, and the actual votes on the four articles of 
impeachment were not mentioned until 31 inches into a 34-inch narrative. 
In effect, Cole Campbell, The Post-Dispatch's editor, said, the newspaper 
was following the path laid out by weekly news magazines by offering 
interpretation, color and context to a readership familiar with the 
basic facts. Over the past two decades, newspapers have been leaning 
increasingly on texture and detail in their coverage. But rarely do 
they substitute texture and mood for facts in front-page coverage 
of historic moments. ``We knew that people would know the outcome 
of the vote when they picked up the paper, so we wanted to do a story 
that conveyed the historicity of the moment,'' said Campbell. ``We 
thought a writer who could capture the feel of the debate would be 
in a position to capture something that would be of value to people 
the day after'' they learned about the impeachment. ``The essay built 
toward the vote,'' explained Campbell, who said that he and three 
top editors, two design editors and a photo editor held a Friday night 
meeting at which they decided on the unconventional approach. One 
of the models for Levins' narrative, Campbell said, was The New York 
Herald's coverage of the 1871 search for the explorer Dr. David Livingstone, 
which built toward the journalist Henry Morton Stanley's discovery 
of the doctor in Africa and his words ``Dr. Livingstone, I presume?'' 
The newspaper's Washington bureau chief, Jon Sawyer, who covers Dick 
Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, wrote an interpretive 
article about the president's ability to govern. This was published 
as part of a two-page inside spread of articles, including four from 
the Washington bureau. No other major papers took the route of The 
Post-Dispatch. But many editors reached deep into the grab bag of 
layout strategies to compose front pages as memorable as the ones 
that announced President Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Neil Armstrong's 
moon landing in 1969 or President Nixon's resignation in 1974. The 
Sunday Oregonian in Portland offered the single word ``Impeached'' 
in full capitals as a 2-inch headline, with the full text of the first 
article of impeachment in smaller type above it. A picture of Clinton 
more than a half-page deep dominated the page, offset by smaller images 
of four other people: Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel; Monica 
Lewinsky; Henry Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, 
and Paula Jones. The Miami Herald, The San Diego Union-Tribune, The 
Las Vegas Sun and The Times-Picayune of New Orleans all featured 1- 
or 2-inch-high headlines, abutted by smaller boxes reporting the decision 
on each of the four articles of impeachment. The New York Times, traditionally 
reserved in the size of its typefaces, ran the headline ``Clinton 
Impeached,'' roughly three-quarters the size of its best-known large 
headlines, ``Nixon Resigns'' and ``Men Walk on Moon,'' which were 
both more than an inch deep.
