On the 10th anniversary of the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland, 
the United States told Libya Monday that it would face more sanctions 
if two Libyan suspects are not turned over for trial by a Scottish 
judge in the Netherlands by February. ``Ten years is much too long 
to wait for justice,'' said Peter Burleigh, the American representative 
on the Security Council, which discussed the issue Monday. In Libya, 
however, Col. Moammar Gadhafi only widened the breach Monday, apparently 
rejecting the compromise plan for a trial in the Netherlands by saying 
that he wanted an international tribunal to hear the case. Earlier 
this month Libya's national assembly seemed to endorse the plan for 
a Scottish trial after a personal appeal to Gadhafi from Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan, who went to Libya on Dec. 5. ``An international court 
is the solution,'' Gadhafi told a Dutch television interviewer in 
a program taped last week and broadcast in the Netherlands Monday, 
``with judges from America, Libya, England and other countries.'' 
On Monday, at a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery marking the 
bombing, President Clinton said the plan to hold the trial in the 
Netherlands was a ``take it or leave it'' deal. ``We will not negotiate 
its terms,'' he added. For years Libya refused to allow American or 
British courts to try the suspects in the bombing, which killed 270 
people, including 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, the Scottish town 
where the plane came down. In August Britain and the United States 
offered the compromise of a trial in a third country, and the Netherlands 
agreed to allow a Scottish court to be set up for that purpose in 
Utrecht. But Libya, under U.N. sanctions since 1992, continued to 
stall, raising a number of questions about the treatment of the suspects 
and where they would be imprisoned if convicted. British officials 
and the secretary-general's legal counsel, Under Secretary-General 
Hans Corell, replied exhaustively to the Libyans. Sir Jeremy Greenstock, 
Britain's representative at the United Nations, said Monday that all 
the questions raised by Libya had been answered. ``These clarifications 
show that we have no hidden agenda and that we are acting in good 
faith,'' he said after the Council meeting Monday morning. ``Our objective 
is simply a free and fair trial before the eyes of the world. If acquitted 
the two accused would be free to return to Libya.'' Arab diplomats 
say that Libya is concerned that the two suspects, Basset Ali Mohamed 
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, could be pressed by Western intelligence 
agencies or trial prosecutors to talk about more than Lockerbie. Annan 
said again Monday that he remains optimistic that Libya will eventually 
comply with the request to send the suspects to the Netherlands. But 
the signs from Libya seem to be pointing in another direction. In 
February the Security Council will review the sanctions on Libya, 
which include a ban on international air travel to and from the country, 
an arms embargo and a bar on the sale of spare parts for aircraft 
and the oil industry. The sanctions would be suspended immediately 
if the suspects were handed over. By February, Burleigh said Monday, 
``the Libyan government will have had six months to accept the offer 
it long said it would accept.'' ``If by that time, the government 
of Libya has not handed over the suspects for trial before a Scottish 
court in the Netherlands,'' he said, ``we will seek additional measures 
to compel compliance.''
