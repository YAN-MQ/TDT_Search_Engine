The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 22: The campaign 
to choose Israel's next government began Monday, more than a year 
ahead of schedule. That will mean regrettable new delays in peace 
talks with the Palestinians. But the elections, to be held sometime 
early next year, will give Israeli voters a chance to reinforce the 
wobbly Middle East peace effort. The fractious right-wing coalition 
led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the past two and a half 
years has shown itself incapable of consistent movement toward peace. 
A new, more broadly based government could prove more productive. 
Netanyahu's two main opponents, Ehud Barak, the Labor party leader, 
or Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, an independent centrist, are obvious 
candidates to lead such a government. But Netanyahu, if he can find 
a way to free himself from the uncompromising right, could also do 
the job. Netanyahu is more of a pragmatist than an ideologue and deserves 
credit for leading his Likud party away from rejection of all territorial 
compromise. But most of his term has been consumed by narrow tactical 
maneuvers, and he has yet to articulate a clear vision of what would 
constitute a fair and acceptable peace. Regrettably, he has launched 
his re-election campaign with a threat to suspend his part in carrying 
out the American-brokered Wye accord he signed in October. Barak is 
an untested campaigner who will have to overcome voter suspicions 
that his Labor party is too eager for agreement with the Palestinians 
and not careful enough on security issues. Lipkin-Shahak, a retired 
army chief, has no political experience and, since he is still formally 
a military officer, has refrained from publicly expressing his views. 
But many centrists see him as the best hope for achieving a secure 
peace. Labor and Likud have both been losing voters, and these elections 
are likely to go to the candidate who can sway the large group of 
independents who want a negotiated peace but also want Palestinian 
leaders to control terrorism. Israel would be well served if these 
supporters of a fair peace prevail at the polls and shape the next 
government.
