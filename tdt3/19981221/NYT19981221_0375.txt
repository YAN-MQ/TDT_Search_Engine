For Jason Robert Brown, setting out to write the music and lyrics 
for ``Parade'' was hard, but not for the reasons one might expect. 
It was not because he was 24 at the time _ he is now 28 _ and never 
had written a musical before. It was not because two renowned veterans 
of the theater _ the Tony award-winning director Harold Prince, who 
helped conceive the show, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright 
Alfred Uhry, who wrote its book _ had decided to gamble on a complete 
unknown. Nor was it because it would be tough for anyone to write 
a musical about a man who was lynched after being wrongly convicted 
of murdering a teen-age girl. It was difficult, Brown says, because 
he wanted to bring to life Leo Frank, the man at the center of the 
play, a New York Jew working as a superintendent at a pencil factory 
in Atlanta in 1913. The character eluded him. ``The piece had historical 
resonance and political resonance, but I couldn't find a lot of personal 
resonance,'' said Brown in an interview shortly before ``Parade'' 
opened last week at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center. 
Although critical reaction to ``Parade'' has been mixed, the play 
arguably represents the most ambitious new work of the season, given 
that large-scale original musicals rarely come along these days, and 
that ``Parade'' deals with such weighty subjects: the trial of a man 
falsely accused, the specter of anti-Semitism, the transformation 
from an agrarian to industrial society, the testing of a marriage. 
``Parade'' also has been closely watched as part of the saga of Livent 
Inc., co-producer of the show with Lincoln Center Theater; the company 
recently sought bankruptcy protection. The production marks the joining 
of two forces in the theater: Prince, whose productions have included 
``Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Evita'' and ``Sweeney Todd,'' and Uhry, 
author of ``Last Night of Ballyhoo'' and ``Driving Miss Daisy.'' Such 
collaborators might intimidate even the most seasoned of composers, 
particularly given that Prince turned to Brown after Stephen Sondheim 
turned down this project. But Brown said he felt up to the task. ``I 
didn't have doubts about the musical end of it,'' he said. ``I was 
much more concerned about the language. There was a delicacy to the 
language of those times. There was a lot of gentility and precision 
in the way they spoke. I'm much more a product of spitting things 
out.'' Prince said it was not such a leap of faith. He said he had 
worked with the songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Ebb when 
they were starting out, and with Sondheim in his early days as well. 
``I feel great confidence in young people,'' Prince said. ``Jason's 
view of things is understandably more contemporary, and I have more 
experience, more knowledge. We're good for each other.'' Prince's 
daughter, Daisy, discovered Brown's work at a piano bar in Manhattan 
and brought the young composer to her father's attention. Prince recalled 
being particularly impressed by a song Brown had written about Betsy 
Ross. ``I thought it was miraculous,'' he said. In writing ``Parade,'' 
Brown worked closely with Uhry, who grew up in Atlanta and whose great-uncle 
owned the pencil factory run by Leo Frank. Just about every time Brown 
sat down to write a song, he was working from a text by Uhry, whom 
the composer described as a generous and kind partner. ``I leaned 
on Alfred to give me as much color as he could,'' Brown said. ``It 
was in his bones.'' Uhry said he was impressed by how quickly Brown 
keyed into a world Uhry knew so well. ``The first song he played me 
was `The Old Red Hills of Home,' and he's never been in the state 
of Georgia,'' Uhry said. ``I got a big lump in my throat.'' Brown 
also steeped himself in research about the Frank case and about the 
period, reading newspaper articles from the time. ``I was trying to 
make sure I understood the idiom and the people and the kind of rage 
that could make this happen in the first place,'' Brown said. ``I 
implicitly understood Howard Beach, and I implicitly understood the 
L.A. riots. And I guess, being inside this particular issue, I couldn't 
understand Atlanta in 1913.'' Like Leo Frank, Brown, who grew up in 
Rockland County, is Jewish. He said he came late to making a personal 
connection to the character. ``I didn't see Leo as being me,'' he 
said. In September 1997, Brent Carver stepped into the role of Frank 
for the workshop production of ``Parade.'' Something about Carver's 
interpretation of the role, which he also plays in the current production, 
made Brown identify with Frank for the first time. ``Seeing Brent 
do it, I was finally able to put myself up there,'' Brown said. ``I 
saw what he was looking for, saw what he needed and saw that I hadn't 
given it to him. There was something about the way he was closed off 
and bristled around people that I really recognized.'' Uhry said he 
had come to see a lot of Frank in Brown as well. ``I see a reserved 
person who feels like a fish out of water a lot of the time,'' Uhry 
said, ``and reins in his real feelings.'' Brown said that he developed 
his sense of outsiderness and reserve as a young boy. Being skipped 
from the middle of third grade to the middle of fourth grade left 
him in a strange no man's land of academic distinction and social 
alienation, he said. ``Kids didn't want to let me into the club,'' 
he said. ``I spent 10 years trying to figure out where I fit into 
a world where everyone was older.'' At age 8, he asked for a piano 
because he wanted to grow up and be Billy Joel. ``The minute I started 
doing it, I knew what I wanted to be doing,'' Brown said. ``Sitting 
behind that piano, I could express myself.'' After two years of college 
at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, Brown dropped out and 
followed a girlfriend to Miami, where he taught at a performing arts 
high school. In 1990 he came to New York, and supported himself by 
playing in piano bars and middle-school productions. All along Brown 
had been writing songs. He decided to put some of them together for 
cabaret singers at one of the clubs where he played, Eighty-Eight's. 
One night Ms. Prince was in the audience. She directed the revue off-Broadway 
as ``Songs for a New World'' in October 1995, and the score was recorded 
by RCA Victor. There are only about 15 minutes of ``Parade'' without 
music. Yet he has tackled other projects while working on ``Parade,'' 
like writing the arrangements for William Finn's ``New Brain'' at 
Lincoln Center and ``Dinah Was'' at the Gramercy Theater, as well 
as orchestrations for ``Love's Fire'' at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. 
All of which, Brown said, left him looking forward simply to sleeping 
past noon. ``Everyone asks, `What after `Parade'?'' he said. ``And 
I just sit there and stare at them.''
