Angola's UNITA rebels on Monday shelled the outskirts of a key central 
highland town in a bid to seize it from government forces. UNITA artillery 
gunners targetting Kuito opened fire at dawn, hitting the airport 
and Cunji, a village that sits seven kilometers (4 miles) away on 
high ground overlooking Kuito, the Roman Catholic bishop in Kuito 
told Radio Eclesia. The intensity of the bombing tore the roofs of 
some houses in Kuito, Bishop Jose Nambi told Radio Eclesia. There 
was no immediate word on casualties. Since Angola's 1994 peace accord 
started unraveling earlier this month and fighting erupted anew, battles 
have focused mostly on Kuito, the capital of Bie province which lies 
some 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda. Government 
forces attacked UNITA's central highland strongholds Andulo and Bailundo 
on Dec. 4 but failed to gain control of them. UNITA then launched 
an offensive to seize some central highland towns under government 
control, namely Huambo and Kuito. Huambo reportedly is calm now. There 
are up to 60,000 displaced people in Kuito, adding to a population 
of some 100,000, according to the United Nations' World Food Program. 
``The thing that breaks your heart is that the city was beginning 
to be rebuilt,'' WFP spokeswoman Maria Flynn said. Kuito was wrecked 
by shelling and street fighting between government troops and UNITA 
rebels in 1993, a year before the United Nations brokered a peace 
agreement. The pact has crumbled amid continuing hostilities between 
the government and UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola. Also Monday, UNITA accused Namibia 
and Zimbabwe of sending troops to support President Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos in the renewed fighting. ``Jose Eduardo dos Santos was forced 
to rely on foreign military support to try to resolve an internal 
conflict,'' the UNITA leadership said in a statement faxed to The 
Associated Press. Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are supporting Congo's 
President Laurent Kabila against insurgents who are backed by Rwanda 
and Uganda, a longtime ally of UNITA. Angola's civil war started in 
1975, after a 14-year fight for independence from Portuguese colonial 
rule. The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement 
collapsed a year later after UNITA refused to accept defeat in U.N.-sponsored 
elections.
