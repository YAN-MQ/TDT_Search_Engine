An opposition leader on Monday charged that a new courtroom being 
built within the central prison was designed to keep the public away 
from a mutiny trial. Vincent Malebo said that a group of soldiers 
suspected of overthrowing the military leadership in September were 
to stand trial in the specially constructed security area. Lesotho 
government officials could not be reached for comment. Malebo made 
his comments at a news conference about progress of a special commission, 
the Interim Political Authority, that is to prepare new elections 
within 18 months. Malebo is a member of the group. The commission 
was set up by the government and opposition after 3,500 South African 
and Botswanan soldiers entered Lesotho in September to quell an army 
mutiny and unrest linked to elections last May. The arrival of the 
troops triggered widespread rioting and firebombing in the capital 
of Maseru, in which scores of South Africans and Lesotho citizens 
died. Lesotho's governing party won by a landslide in the May election, 
but opposition parties claimed the vote was rigged. A commission official, 
Khauhelo Raditapole, said the group would give high priority to the 
question of the continued detention of soldiers suspected of participating 
in the mutiny. When the soldiers were arrested in October, opposition 
leaders charged the government had betrayed a promise made to soldiers 
that nothing would happen to them if they returned to their bases.
