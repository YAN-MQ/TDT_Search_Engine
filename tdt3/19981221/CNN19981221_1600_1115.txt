Security specialists warn there's a new software virus being spread 
by e-mail. It's called the Ms word macro 97 class virus. As its name 
implies, the virus infects Microsoft word files. It has also caused 
several networks to crash. Apparently, the virus gives the E-mail 
recipient a message telling the user that he or she "is a big stupid 
jerk."
