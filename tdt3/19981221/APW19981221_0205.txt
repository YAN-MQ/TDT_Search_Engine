For nearly eight years, the metal gate outside the al-Rasheed family 
home has been left unlocked. ``I don't want him to return and find 
it closed,'' sobbed the mother of musician Abdullah al-Rasheed, who 
left to buy bread for his wife and six children on Jan. 3, 1991, during 
the seven-month Iraqi occupation. He didn't return. The symbolic hope 
of the open gate is in sharp contrast to the family's cheerless reality: 
no answers and the tearful prospect they may never learn his fate. 
There are hundreds of similar stories around Kuwait, where the government 
claims 605 people were detained or captured by Iraqis and never accounted 
for after the 1991 Gulf War. Resolving the cases is one point in the 
U.N. resolutions that ended the conflict. But Western leaders, constantly 
wrangling with Saddam Hussein over weapons inspections, rarely publicly 
press the issue of the MIAs. It's generally been left to the Kuwaiti 
government and a coalition of families to carry on the wrenching quest 
of seeking those who never came home. Some were soldiers in the U.S.-led 
coalition, said Kuwait's National Committee for the Missing and POWs. 
Others were believed to be with the underground resistance during 
the occupation. ``I truly don't know why they took my son,'' said 
al-Rasheed's mother, Naima Hassan Al-Salem, who last heard from freed 
Kuwaitis in 1991 that her son was held in a southern Iraq jail. ``I 
can only say that, God willing, someday he will walk through those 
gates and come home. Maybe that will happen if Saddam ever falls.''
