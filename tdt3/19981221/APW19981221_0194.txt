An Egyptian radical Islamic group issued a series of threats against 
the United States and Kuwait to avenge the U.S.-British airstrikes 
on Iraq, a leading Arab newspaper reported Monday. The London-based 
daily Al-Hayat said it received a statement and a phone call claiming 
to be from al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, which urged 
a holy war against the United States and threatened to blow up Kuwaiti 
embassies. Al-Hayat's office in the Gulf state of Bahrain also received 
a phone call from a man who did not identify himself with any group 
and threatened to attack American interests, including ones in Bahrain, 
the newspaper said. In Bahrain, a U.S. Embassy official said the embassy 
received a telephone bomb threat Sunday and that the building was 
evacuated, but no bomb was found. The embassy official, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity, said the caller did not identify himself 
with any group. The four days of missile and bomb attacks on Iraq 
came after the chief U.N. arms inspector accused the Iraqi government 
of failing to cooperate in the search for weapons of mass destruction. 
The U.S.-British airstrikes also led to protests throughout the Arab 
world. In its Monday edition, Al-Hayat printed a statement attributed 
to the Islamic Group which said that fighting Americans ``is an order 
from God'' and added that without such a fight ``we cannot get dignity 
and stop American arrogance.'' The newspaper said it also received 
a phone call Sunday from a man speaking with an Egyptian accent who 
said ``the Islamic Group will bomb eight Kuwaiti embassies around 
the world on Monday.'' Kuwait, which was invaded by Iraq in 1990, 
is among the few Arab states that supported the U.S.-British action. 
The Islamic Group carried out a six-year campaign of violence aimed 
at toppling Egypt's secular government that led to more than 1,250 
deaths. Its spiritual leader is Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who is jailed 
in the United States on a conviction of conspiring to blow up New 
York landmarks. The Islamic Group statement urged a ``jihad,'' or 
holy war, against the United States, a boycott of British and American 
goods and the ejection of U.S. and British ambassadors from Islamic 
countries. ``What is happening in Iraq should raise the (Muslim) nation 
... and push it to inflict the required punishment on the Americans 
and their allies,'' the statement said. Al-Hayat is one of the most 
well-known newspapers in the Arab world and frequently receives communiques 
from Arab and Islamic groups. Two days ago, it printed a statement 
issued in the name of the Egyptian group Islamic Jihad-Vanguards of 
Conquest also threatening to avenge the bombardment of Iraq by punishing 
the United States.
