When we come back, we'll take "A closer look" at fertility drugs. 
I work out to keep my body in shape. To help keep my mind sharp I 
take NEWr uanterra ginkgo biloba. It helps me concentrate, maintain 
focus. Why quanterra? All ginkgos aren't the same. The patented quanterra 
extract was proven safe and effective by doctors in extensive clinical 
trials. And it increases oxygen supply to the brain. With new quanterra 
mental sharpness I feel my best, naturally. Teddy gibbs can't let 
a sore throat stop him. Even when it feels this raw. He toughs it 
out through the hacking cough... the aches, the fever but when the 
job is done he's desperate... ... for fast, powerful theraflu relief. 
With the first sip of that soothing, lemony hot liquid he feels comfort 
instantly. Soon, his throat feels calmed his cough quieted. Maximum 
strength theraflu. Now in new cherry sore throat and cough. Instant 
comfort. Powerful relief.
