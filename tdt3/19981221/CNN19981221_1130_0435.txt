Gas prices hit an all-time low last week. Analyst Trilby lundberg, 
who tracks the price of gas, says the weighted average for all grades 
of gasoline fell to $1.03.55 gallon last week. If inflation is factored 
in, last week's price is cheaper than 1986s previous record low. Tulsa, 
Oklahoma, had the nation's cheapest gas at about 75 cents per gallon. 
Honolulu, Hawaii, was the most expensive at $1.51 per gallon.
