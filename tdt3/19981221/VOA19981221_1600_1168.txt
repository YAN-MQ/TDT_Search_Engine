French World Cup football hero Zenadeen Zidon has been voted Reuters' 
1998 Sports Personality. Zidon scored two goals in France's 3-0 win 
over Brazil in the final. Zidon also enjoyed an outstanding year with 
his professional club Yuvantues which won the Italian Championship 
and reached the European Cup finals for a third successive year. Finishing 
second in the balloting by 60 Sports Editors and reporters in 35 countries, 
was Austrian ski star, Hermann Meyer. The man known as the Hermanator 
recovered from a spectacular downhill crash to win Olympic Gold Medals 
in the Giant Slalom and Super Giant Slalom at Nagano. US track star 
Marian Jones was third in the Reuters poll. She was undefeated in 
the Women's 100 and 200 meters this year, and did not lose in the 
Long Jump until September.
