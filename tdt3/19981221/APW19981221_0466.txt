Two Israelis charged with spying in Cyprus pleaded innocent Monday, 
and their trial was postponed until next month. Udi Hargov and Igal 
Damary, whose case has strained relations between Israel and Cyprus, 
also were denied bail. Israel has denied they were spying in Cyprus 
on behalf of Turkey but hasn't said what their mission was. But Israeli 
media has said it was a bungled operation by the Mossad, possibly 
related to anti-aircraft missiles that Cyprus was planning to deploy 
on the island in the next few weeks. The botched spy mission led to 
the resignation of Mossad's second-in-command, Israeli media reported. 
Hargov, 37, and Damary, 49, were brought to court handcuffed and guarded 
by armed members of the special police anti-terrorist squad. Neither 
spoke during the brief proceedings, except to plead innocent to three 
separate charges. The trial is to open Jan. 20. The two were arrested 
Nov. 6 at Zigi, a small fishing village on the southern coast of Cyprus 
next to an army camp and a military training area. In addition to 
spying, they were charged with conspiring to commit a crime while 
in Israel and Cyprus between Oct. 15 and Nov. 6, and with possessing 
scanning and recording equipment without a government license. They 
face a maximum sentence of 10 years. Tension has risen on the island 
because of threats by Turkey to prevent the planned deployment by 
Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. Both Israel and Turkey 
are known to be interested in gaining information on the arrival of 
the missiles, expected in the next few weeks.
