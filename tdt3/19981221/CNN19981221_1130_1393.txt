I've just got this burning love for food. But sometimes it just doesn't 
love me back. Heartburn surging up to here. What my doctor calls acid 
reflux. When I get it, he says get gaviscon. Only regular gaviscon 
forms a soothing, protective barrier to help keep stomach acid down 
-- where it belongs. Mylanta can't -- pepcid ac can't. Only gaviscon 
can. So my heartburn doesn't come back to burn me. It helps keep acid 
down where it be longs.
