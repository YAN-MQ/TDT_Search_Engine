The reformist center-right government on Monday survived a vote of 
no-confidence sought by leftists and nationalists who accused it of 
ruining the economy. Prime Minister Radu Vasile's government was supported 
by 283 votes and 163 legislators voted against, national radio station 
reported. There are 486 legislators in the two-chamber parliament. 
Vasile criticized the opposition, comprising the leftist Social Democracy 
Party and the nationalist National Unity and Greater Romania parties, 
for their move which he claimed was politically motivated. ``The longer 
reforms are delayed, the more painful are economic solutions,'' said 
Vasile before a joint sitting. Vasile said the government is committed 
to continue its reforms by privatizing and closing the money-losing 
companies. He said his government will have the support of the International 
Monetary Fund which said it would lend money to the government to 
help the unemployed if it closes down bankrupted companies. Vasile 
blamed the opposition, which ran the country from 1990 to 1996, for 
delaying privatization. He said the government was now forced to sell 
state assets at a ``very reduced price.'' Some 143 lawmakers supported 
a motion blaming the government for chaos in the economy and a serious 
drop in living standards. ``Romanians have become poorer and poorer, 
and government reforms ... are mostly a mockery,'' said Valeriu Tabara, 
leader of the National Unity Party. In Nov. 1996, the newly elected 
government launched an ambitious but painful economic reform program 
to privatize the state sector and introduce a tight fiscal policy. 
Since then, purchasing power and production have dropped sharply. 
While unemployment has risen to over 9 percent, the average monthly 
salary has dropped to about 1.2 million lei (dlrs 120). The government 
recently said that some 170,000 people lost their jobs this year and 
70,000 other jobs would be cut over the upcoming weeks, as 29 state 
money-losing companies are closed. This was the third no confidence 
vote brought against the government in the last two years. It also 
easily survived the first two.
