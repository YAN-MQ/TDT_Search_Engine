NATIONAL FORECAST The coldest air mass of the season will invade the 
Northeast on Tuesday, punctuated by strong winds. Powerful gusts of 
wind will accompany an Arctic front as it forges rapidly east from 
western New York and western Pennsylvania. Gusts to 50 mph are possible, 
particularly in valleys such as the Mohawk Valley of New York and 
the Winnoski Valley of Vermont, which have open exposure to west and 
northwesterly winds. Strong winds are also likely atop mountains, 
with gusts well over 100 mph occurring at the summit of Mt. Washington 
in New Hampshire. Ahead of the sharp Arctic front, morning temperatures 
will be in the 40's and 50's along the rainy Northeast seaboard. But, 
by Wednesday morning, readings will have plummeted into the single 
digits, teens or low 20's from Portland, Maine, to New York City, 
where the first 32-degree temperature of the season will be observed 
in Central Park. Meanwhile, snow showers and snow squalls will rage 
downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario as Arctic air is rapidly moistened 
in transit over unseasonably tepid waters. Heavy snow is possible 
on high ground across northwest Pennsylvania and southwest New York, 
where moistened Arctic air is forced to rapidly ascend the sloping 
terrain. Lake-effect snows will taper and gradually end as a ridge 
of high pressure builds into the region later Tuesday. An incursion 
of cold air will also take place in the Gulf Coast states. Monday's 
high temperatures were in the 70's in northern Louisiana. Tuesday, 
readings will struggle to exceed 32 degrees. Focus: Minneapolis Mileposts 
Two wintry mileposts were just passed in Minneapolis. Two inches of 
snow fell on Sunday, marking the season's first snowfall of one inch 
or more in the Twin Cities area. Sunday's ``plowable'' snow ranks 
as the city's seventh latest date on record for the first snowfall 
of an inch or more. In quick fashion Monday morning, the temperature 
in Minneapolis fell to minus 1 degree Fahrenheit, marking the first 
sub-zero degree reading since January 20, 1998. The 334-day streak 
without temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit ranks as the city's 
third longest on record.
