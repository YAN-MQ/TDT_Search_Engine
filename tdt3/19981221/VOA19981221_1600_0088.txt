Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz says the US and British Airstrikes 
against Iraq in recent days killed 62 soldiers and wounded 180. But 
that civilian casualties were much higher. VOA Middle East Correspondent, 
Scott Bob reports the remarks come as UN relief workers say they plan 
to return to Iraq Tuesday. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz assailed 
the US and British governments for the attacks, saying they should 
be called to account for their actions. They acted according to the 
law of the jungle. They did not act according to international law. 
US and British officials say the four nights of air attacks hit nearly 
100 targets in Iraq, and severely disrupted the Iraqi military command 
structure. But, Mr. Aziz dismissed their claims as lies. The head 
of the UN humanitarian workers in Iraq, Monday said his staff is returning, 
to resume distributions of food and medicine to Iraqis suffering from 
eight years of economic sanctions. Iraqis continue to dig out from 
the rubble left by the missile attacks. The attacks brought demonstrations 
and wide spread criticisms from the Arab world. Scott Bob, VOA News, 
Amman.
