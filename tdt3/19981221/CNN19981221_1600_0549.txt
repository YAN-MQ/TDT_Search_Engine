A team trying to become the first to circle the globe nonstop in a 
balloon is cruising toward the center of China. Problem is, China 
has not okayed the travel plans. Mark Austin has the latest. Okay, 
there it is. Visual contact with the balloon straight ahead. 29,000 
feet about 30 miles. Richard Branson's balloon is currently trying 
to bisect k2 and everest over the Himalayas, but he's heading for 
the Chinese border and at the moment, China won't let him in. Desperate 
attempts are being made to change that, but so far to no avail. It's 
the latest in a line of problems. They had to thread their way past 
Iraq and whether a lightning storm with parachutes at the ready. In 
pictures beamed to the chase plain, Branson had this to say. The only 
problem was that we had to go up high to avoid thunderstorms which 
meant that we went slightly closer to the Iraqi border than we would 
have liked. But we managed to avoid the Iraqi border and then come 
up and try to head down this particular corridor that we're heading 
down at the moment. That was before the latest difficulties with the 
Chinese authorities. Itn's Terry Lloyd is in the chase plane. The 
problem they've got is that they cannot come down. They're over the 
Himalayas. There's the dangers of all the peaks, the mountains, k2 
and Everett there. They can't possibly come down, even if they're 
ordered to. The winds of the moments are likely to blow them into 
Chinese air space later this afternoon, and there's not much they 
can do about that. The great threat, the great danger of course is 
that the Chinese military jet will threaten to shoot them down. It's 
because they had to avoid Iraq that the balloon won't be able to fly 
through a previously agreed corridor in China. Back at the operation 
center, organizers are frantic. We've been talking to everybody that 
can help. And, sir Ted Heath has been on the phone this morning, and 
we've been asking him for his help and talking to the foreign office. 
We're talking to anyone that can help. It is a very difficult situation. 
The next few hours, say the organizers, are crucial. Mark Austin, 
itn.
