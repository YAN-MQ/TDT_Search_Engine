Time now for a festive footnote from The World's back pages. Manufacturers 
are having a tough time in Germany this year. It seems as though the 
sales of garden gnomes are coming up short. According to a BBC report, 
the home-grown gnome market is facing stiff competition from abroad. 
German craftsmen have traditionally turned out garden gnomes since 
1870. They're especially popular around Christmas time. But now, inferior 
Eastern European gnomes are flooding the market. Up until recently, 
every truck entering the country from the east was searched for contraband 
gnomes, with many foreign-born gnomes impounded and destroyed. But 
the law was lifted, and now gnome knockoffs are freely crossing borders.
