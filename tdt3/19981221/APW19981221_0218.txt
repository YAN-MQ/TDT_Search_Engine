A club for American expatriates in Singapore was evacuated and the 
U.S. Embassy was searched on Monday after a bomb threat, an embassy 
spokesman said. No bombs were found in either location. The embassy 
received a non-specific threat against Americans by phone from an 
unidentified caller around noon, said the embassy spokesman, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. Singapore authorities were notified immediately 
and a search of the embassy was conducted, the spokesman said. No 
bombs were found and the embassy was declared safe at 1:15 p.m., whereupon 
it resumed normal operations, he said. Local police said in a statement 
that the bomb threat appeared to be a hoax. Under Singapore law, false 
bomb threats are punishable by up to seven years jail and a 50,000 
Singapore dollar (dlrs 30,300) fine. Security personnel at the American 
Club, a centrally-located private facility catering to U.S. citizens 
but also open to locals, said about 300 members, guests and employees 
were evacuated shortly after noon and the club was subsequently closed 
for the day. Police conducted a search but found no bomb, they said, 
adding that the club would reopen Tuesday as regularly scheduled. 
Security guards carrying metal detectors continued to turn away members 
arriving to at the club in the afternoon and early evening on Monday. 
The embassy spokesman declined to comment on whether the bomb threat 
was connected with the recent U.S. military strikes against Iraq. 
U.S. Embassies around the world have heightened their security since 
the bombing started last week amid concern over possible retaliatory 
attacks.
