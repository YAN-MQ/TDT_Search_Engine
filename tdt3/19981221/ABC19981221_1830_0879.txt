The United States is unhappy with China tonight. China shut the door 
on dissent in a very forceful way today, sentencing two pro-democracy 
campaigners to very long prison terms. China recently signed a treaty 
promising to respect human rights. It sent a very different message 
today. In Beijing, here is ABC's Jim Laurie. Xu wenli was freed five 
years ago after serving 12 years in jail because he had campaigned 
for democratic reform. Today, he got another 13-year sentence, for 
wanting one thing -- a legal opposition party. His trial, a mere three-hour 
hearing in a court cordoned off by police and off limits to the press 
and public. Xu's wife says a fair trial was never possible. Xu was 
denied his own attorney and given no time to prepare a defense. This 
at a time when many here thought China was becoming more tolerant 
of political dissent. Now the Chinese have virtually crushed the tiny 
pro-democracy movement. President Jiang Zemin has laid down the line 
in harsher terms than have been heard in years. "The socialist system 
cannot be weakened," said Jiang. "Western political systems must never 
be copied." What is exaoinary about all this is China's democracy 
movement is so small, a few hundred people. Tiny groups like this 
meeting secretly. Yet in the words of Jiang Zemin, "they must be nipped 
in the bud." Jim Laurie, ABC News, Beijing.
