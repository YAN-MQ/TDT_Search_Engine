Exercising with a small child in a jogging stroller, bike seat or 
backpack seems like a great experience for both parent and child. 
But safety experts are split over the idea, and offer a longer list 
of cautions than you might have imagined. Dr. Bryant Stamford, a professor 
of exercise physiology at the University of Louisville, Ky., who reviewed 
the subject in last month's issue of the journal The Physician and 
Sports Medicine, found expert opinion to be ``pretty polarized.'' 
No solid statistics are available to guide the debate, he said, ``but 
it's the kind of thing where if an accident happens once, it's probably 
going to catch a lot of attention.'' On the other hand, he said, experts 
should remember that responsible parents ``deserve some credit'' for 
common sense. Even so, he warned that there are risks, especially 
in areas where winter terrain makes the going rough. ``As a rule, 
the younger the child, the greater the risk,'' he said. ``A crash 
could be disastrous for a newborn.'' Below, Stamford offers suggestions 
for runners, bikers and hikers who want to take a small child along 
for the ride: Running ``Pushing a stroller while you're jogging to 
me seems pretty safe,'' Stamford said in a telephone interview. But 
when buying a jogging stroller, he recommended choosing a model that 
is sturdy, stable and will not tip on turns. ``Don't trade safety 
for savings,'' he said. ``Expect to pay over $200.'' He also suggested 
choosing a model with a deep seat and a seat belt, and wearing a safety 
wrist strap to prevent the stroller from getting away from you. When 
running with your child, never run in traffic or ``close quarters 
of any kind,'' and avoid rough surfaces. Try to anticipate hazards 
like car doors opening and never leave the stroller unattended. If 
your child is an infant, try to keep his or her head from bouncing. 
Large, slightly deflated tires can decrease jostling. A child's bicycle 
helmet offers added protection. Stamford also recommended making sure 
the child is neither under nor overdressed. ``Remember, what's comfortable 
for the exercising adult is likely not for a seated child,'' he said. 
Biking ``The things that happen with bicycles bother me more,'' Stamford 
said. In the article, he noted that: ``Bicycles are, by nature, unstable 
and adding a seat decreases stability even more.'' Quite a few experts 
reject the idea of child bicycle seats completely. Others caution 
against carrying children heavier than 40 pounds _ because of stability 
concerns _ or under a year old, because their necks are weak and might 
be strained by bumps or the side to side whipping motion of a bike 
laboring uphill. When buying a bike seat, make sure that it has spoke 
guards, safety belt and adequate padding, and that it fits securely 
to the bicycle frame. When riding, avoid clothing or blankets that 
could get caught in the spokes or other moving parts. Do not ride 
at night or in traffic, and you and your child should always wear 
helmets. Bicycle trailers seem safer, though they are far from ideal. 
Communication with the parent is limited and the ride can be rough. 
``Another factor is that trailers cost much more than seats,'' Stamford 
said. Hiking Hiking with a child in a backpack ``may be the safer 
option,'' Stamford said, but backpacks ``are not risk free.'' Backpacks 
come in various sizes, and large packs are generally more comfortable 
for the child and offer greater support. When hiking, ``take smaller 
steps, avoid rough, hard-to-see or slick terrain and don't walk too 
fast, especially when going downhill.'' And never wear a baby backpack 
when fly-fishing, lawn moving or skiing. In all these activities, 
Stamford concluded, the key is vigilance. ``The average person tends 
to think that since I'm a safe person, I can do this safely,'' he 
said. ``But some factors will always be out of control. You can do 
it a thousand times safely, but it only takes one little mishap to 
be pretty catastrophic.'' The best safety equipment, he said, is ``real 
serious thought.''
