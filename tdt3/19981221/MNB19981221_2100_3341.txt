On the news wire right now is what the national weather service is 
calling a winter weather warning for upstate New York. Prepare for 
a quick change to winter weather. Let's confirm that with meteorologist 
Janice huff of WNBC-TV in New York. Thanks, Brian. A very quick change. 
Tomorrow at this time in the northeast wind chill values could be 
30 to 40 degrees below the current range. Right behind this front 
it's changing over to snow in parts of Michigan, illinois, Indiana, 
into Missouri. Also some icy conditions. 50's right now in New York 
City and Philadelphia as well as Pittsburgh. Behind that, teens and 
single digits and temperatures below zero over the plains. Once again 
tonight a bitter cold night for the northern plains, the central rockies, 
even some 20's over the central valleys of California. In southern 
California freeze warnings are in effect tonight. Tomorrow highs in 
the 50's. Not making it ute of the single digits and teens in the 
northern plains. Rain in Boston. 50's along the eastern seaboard. 
81 in Miami. That is all going to change in the east by Thursday as 
the Arctic blast over the plains and Canada shifts through the Great 
Lakes and into the northeast. So you are going to see a drastic change 
in the weather across the northeast, even as far south as the carolinas 
by Thursday. Christmas eve may be some freezing rain. That's the weather 
around the nation, Brian. Back to you. Janice huff, thank you very.
