Janet Brewster Murrow, a radio broadcaster and relief worker during 
World War II in London, where her husband, Edward R. Murrow, was CBS' 
star war correspondent, died on Friday at the North Hill retirement 
community in Needham, Mass., where she lived. She was 88. Mrs. Murrow 
was born in Middletown, Conn., and graduated in 1933 from Mount Holyoke 
College in South Hadley, Mass. As a student leader she met Murrow, 
who was president of the National Student Federation of America. They 
married in 1934. Beginning in 1937, and through World War II, they 
lived in London, and Murrow went on to direct CBS' World War II reporting 
team and to win fame for his reporting about the war. Soon after the 
war began in September 1939, Mrs. Murrow made her first radio broadcast, 
for CBS, about family life in wartime, and she became an occasional 
broadcaster for CBS and BBC. Her relief work included arranging for 
British recipients to get medicine and other supplies from American 
donors and helping evacuate British children to the United States. 
She also served on a British-American crisis team that worked to enhance 
relations between British civilians and American military personnel 
stationed in Britain. In 1946 she received the King's Medal from Britain, 
and the Murrows returned to the United States. She became a Mount 
Holyoke trustee for 21 years and also served on the boards of National 
Public Radio and the Henry Street Settlement House in New York. Murrow 
became a CBS vice president and television broadcaster and then the 
U.S. Information Agency's director from 1961 to 1964. He died in 1965. 
Mrs. Murrow is survived by a son, Casey, of Putney, Vt., and two grandsons.
