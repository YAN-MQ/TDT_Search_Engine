Network associates says it has discovered a new type of computer virus 
that is more dangerous than any virus previously encountered. The 
virus infects a corporation's computer network and can randomly encrypt 
files. The encryption essentially scrambles the files into indecipherable 
code. The virus has also claimed at least one victim, MCI Worldcom. 
MCI tells "CNN Financial News" that virus has been contained.
