Miami's uphill battle is next in "CNN Headline Sports." And later 
-- using Hollywood as the bait to bring out the best in school students. 
You spend your days-- and probably more evenings than you'd care to 
admit-- caught up in things like trying to align your company's strategies... 
with process and technology... and managing risks to your global operations. 
At Arthur Andersen, we've got people with knowledge and experience... 
who can help you make those kinds of decisions. And while that may 
not exactly get you home early, it just might free you up enough... 
to take care of something that's really important.
