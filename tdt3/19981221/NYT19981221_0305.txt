Like cashiered spies groping for a mission, veteran literary spy masters 
are coming out of the Cold War into a new world order that is hard 
on current sales and indifferent to their old-fashioned trench-coat 
espionage fiction. Some well-known authors have recently parted with 
their publishing houses in search of a fresh approach to increase 
sales, a strategy as elusive as KGB moles. Others, like John le Carre, 
have found intrigue in new settings. In March his new book, which 
promises the thrills of a spy novel in a sinister world of international 
finance, will be published. The book begins, of course, with the execution 
of a lawyer in horn-rimmed glasses. Most dramatic, perhaps, is the 
literary turn taken by Frederick Forsyth, the author of ``The Day 
of the Jackal'' and ``The Odessa File,'' who has changed publishing 
houses as his sales have declined, acquired a new literary agent and 
publicly renounced the thriller genre to ``try my hand at something 
else.'' Something else is a slim volume, a sequel to Gaston Leroux's 
1910 novel, ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' that grew out of discussions 
with the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, who may stage it as a musical. 
Forsyth's publisher of more than 25 years, Bantam, chose not to buy 
the manuscript, ``The Phantom of Manhattan,'' which places the disfigured 
character in a Coney Island factory cleaning fish. But the author 
found another taker. The market is colder than a Siberian winter for 
espionage tales, many publishing executives and agents say, blaming 
the end of the Cold War and shifts in readers' tastes. Today they 
prefer the Tom Clancy style of technological thrillers featuring exotic 
military weapons and an executive-style CIA hero to the lonely agent 
who survives deception, betrayals and multiplying body counts in the 
twilight world of espionage. ``When someone like Freddie doesn't want 
to write them anymore, then there must be something going on in the 
world that makes it difficult for a master,'' said Forsyth's new agent, 
Ed Victor, who added that the authors' moves probably reflect ``that 
spy fiction has peaked, and people usually look for people to blame, 
which means you can fire your publisher, fire your agent.'' Since 
the Berlin wall crumbled in 1989 and the Soviet Union collapsed in 
1991, writers who established themselves by exploring the duplicitous 
world of spycraft have had much more difficulty climbing the heights 
of the New York Times best-seller list, occupying those rarefied levels 
for fewer weeks, if at all. For example, Len Deighton followed the 
life of Bernard Samson, a star-crossed British agent, in three trilogies, 
two of which were best sellers in the 1980s and 1990. But the last 
set, published through 1996, failed to make the ranks. Forsyth achieved 
enduring success with ``The Day of the Jackal'' and ``The Odessa File,'' 
which lingered on the list for 48 weeks. But his last best seller, 
``Icon,'' a postcommunist thriller set in a disintegrating Russia, 
slipped off the list after two weeks. Paperback sales for ``The Day 
of the Jackal'' exceeded 3.5 million copies, while sales for ``Icon'' 
were a million fewer, a publishing executive with knowledge of the 
sales history said. For his sequel to ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' 
Forsyth has signed with an untraditional publisher, Michael Viner, 
the president of New Millennium Entertainment in Beverly Hills, Calif. 
Viner is better known for publishing tell-all nonfiction like Faye 
Resnick's book about Nicole Brown Simpson. In the last two months, 
writers like Robert Ludlum and Ken Follett have left their publishing 
houses for new ones, moves that often reflect polite differences about 
advances or sales expectations that publishers do not consider promising 
enough to justify the generous contracts of flush days. How the Genre 
Waxes and Wanes But the public explanation from Ludlum, Follett and 
le Carre is a desire for fresh approaches, a yearning that has seized 
some well-known writers like an old-fashioned global conspiracy. Ludlum, 
who achieved his biggest successes in the 1970s with tales of complex 
global plots, left his publisher of more than two decades, Bantam, 
for St. Martin's Press, which offered him an eight-figure contract 
and a new strategy. His sales at Bantam had settled to a plateau of 
about 450,000 copies for recent titles like ``The Matarese Countdown,'' 
whose plot revolved around a CIA rookie battling a planet-threatening 
dynasty of killers. ``It's certainly harder to get an audience hot 
about the Cold War, because it's just not there anymore,'' said Jack 
Romanos, the president of Simon &AMP; Schuster, which is publishing 
le Carre's new book through its Scribner imprint. ``It's been difficult 
to take it to a different area. People have tried to make it work 
in South America, the Middle East and China, but it never had the 
same cachet as when it was the good old Americans against the communists.'' 
Historically, spy fiction has flourished and waned with the inspiration 
of war or its threat. The first spy novel in Western literature is 
credited to James Fenimore Cooper, who in 1821 wrote ``The Spy: A 
Tale of the Neutral Ground,'' a novel based on a Revolutionary war 
spy, said Thomas B. Allen, co-author of a reference guide, ``Spy Book.'' 
There was a dry spell until the American Civil War inspired a spate 
of exaggerated memoirs by spies on both sides. After another drought, 
spy fiction surfaced again in the early 1900s and flourished in 1930s 
pulp magazines. But Allen said the two World Wars produced fewer spy 
novels than the Cold War, with its tense and ambiguous atmosphere 
that could not be defined as real war or peace. ``I think we're in 
a valley,'' Allen said of the present cycle, noting that some authors 
are floundering as they search for new themes. ``The generation of 
spy novelists that included le Carre were writing inside their own 
time about things that were almost happening. So now we're in a time 
where nothing much is happening. ``You don't have the FBI in espionage 
mode; they're more in accounting mode.'' Most affected by the cooler 
market are the second-tier authors who were writing in the genre, 
said Romanos of Simon &AMP; Schuster. The well-known authors, he said, 
had a tougher time keeping their audience, while ``the next level, 
the up-and-coming spy fiction, began to shrink dramatically, so there's 
hardly any more of it.'' Younger thriller writers like Daniel Silva, 
37, author of ``The Unlikely Spy'' and ``The Mark of the Assassin,'' 
draw inspiration from World War II, but ``going back to the Cold War 
would be a little strange,'' he said. ``Instinctively it doesn't feel 
right. There's not enough distance and drama.'' Le Carre, a former 
British intelligence officer whose real name is David Cornwell, can 
be viewed as a case study of shifting to new themes while tinkering 
with publishing relationships. The author left his publisher of 20 
years, Alfred A. Knopf, changed literary agents and is poised to publish 
a new book, ``Single &AMP; Single,'' that continues his movement away 
from espionage themes and the prosaic world of his weary and brooding 
spy, George Smiley. His last book, ``The Tailor of Panama,'' involved 
an elaborate plot to void the Panama Canal Treaties. His base of readers 
has eroded and his past sales figured into his last advance from Simon 
&AMP; Schuster, which dropped to $2.5 million. At Scribner, where 
marketing executives have a one-word view of Cold War spy fiction 
(``Done'') the publishers are positioning le Carre to reach a new 
generation of readers. Scribner is planning to print 300,000 copies 
of the novel. Wesley Wark, a University of Toronto history professor 
who specializes in the study of intelligence services and spy fiction, 
said the espionage genre still had life but was ``going through a 
difficult period when clearly new settings or scenes are required.'' 
In Search of a New Lode Instead of new spy settings, though, writers 
are switching to new genres with the intrigue of politics or police 
work. ``You have to wait for the Cold War to be quaint as a little 
Napoleonic war,'' said Charles McCarry, a former CIA intelligence 
officer who has moved from novels about spies to books about political 
intrigue like his best-selling ``Lucky Bastard.'' ``After doing this 
for almost 30 years,'' McCarry said, ``what happens is that you live 
your experience and eventually it runs out. So you find another vein.'' 
A contrarian view of the Cold War comes from Follett, who with his 
departure this month from Crown for Dutton, an imprint of Penguin 
Putnam, intends to write a historical novel based on a failed launching 
of an American satellite amid Cold War tensions in 1958. He is careful, 
however, to correct any typecasting of the book as a Cold War novel. 
``If you say it's a Cold War story,'' Follett said, ``people will 
think it has a character like Smiley and involves a KGB person and 
an FBI agent who are at loggerheads. And it isn't like that at all. 
None of the principal characters are Russian.'' Follett noted that 
he had avoided the spy genre in his last two novels, the latter a 
contemporary thriller called ``The Hammer of Eden,'' which centers 
on aging hippie eco-terrorists. ``Certainly, the golden age of the 
spy story is definitely over,'' Follett said. ``But that doesn't mean 
that there aren't going to be any good ones written. In order to do 
so, I've had to set my story in 1958. I don't think it would work 
in 1998. We're not afraid of the Russians anymore. You need someone 
to be afraid of.''
