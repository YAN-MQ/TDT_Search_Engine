A Chinese dissident who arrived in New York on Sunday accused the 
government in Beijing Monday of ``trampling on human rights'' and 
said he had been beaten while in captivity. After serving more than 
two and a half years in a labor camp, the activist, Liu Nianchun, 
managed to give a faint smile and convey his appreciation to the U.S. 
government for his new-found freedom. With his wife and 10-year-old 
daughter by his side during an hourlong news conference at the Manhattan 
office of Human Rights Watch, Liu described the human rights situation 
in his home country. ``My release into exile for medical treatment 
cannot be seen as an improvement of China's human rights situation,'' 
he said. ``The very fact I am here, forced to leave China in order 
to receive medical treatment, is a serious violation of human rights 
in itself.'' Recent events like the broadcasting of President Clinton's 
human rights debate with President Jiang Zemin on Chinese television 
were significant steps, Liu said, but do not reflect the true nature 
of the situation. ``Presently and practically speaking,'' he said, 
``these events have masked and diminished perception of the actual 
situation on gross human rights abuse, leading some democratic countries 
to claim that China has already shown marked change in the realm of 
human rights.'' Liu recalled beatings by prison guards for offenses 
as minor as not saluting when entering the bathroom or dining hall. 
``I refused to do that,'' he said. ``It was an insult to my personal 
dignity. ``I was in a `re-education through labor' camp in China. 
I was extremely sick, and it was very difficult to get a medical examination, 
and even more difficult to obtain treatment. My living conditions 
were deplorable.'' Liu said his 80-year-old mother had gone on a hunger 
strike to protest his incarceration. And his wife, Chu Hailan, who 
arrived with him in the United States on Sunday, was beaten by police 
when protesting on his behalf, he added. ``We must urge the Chinese 
government to match deeds and words and desist in openly trampling 
on human rights,'' Liu said. Speaking through a translator throughout 
the news conference, he said he hoped to return to China someday but 
for now would work in exile for a democratic China. He said he suffered 
from seven illnesses, but he identified only one, high blood pressure.
