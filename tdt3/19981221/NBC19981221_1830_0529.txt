Still ahead -- after the smoke clears in Iraq, mission accomplished? 
How much damage was really done? If the point of this was to take 
out Saddam Hussein and the republican guard, I don't think we did 
as much as we needed to get gone. Saddam hangs on. What happens now 
after desert fox? And history in the making -- eight babies born to 
one mother. NBC news "in depth" tonight -- octuplets. What are their 
chances of surviving? With the dremel rotary tool system, you can 
remove old grout, cut drywall, clean golf clubs, drill pinecones, 
install a smoke alarm, I.D. electronics, shape tile and more. The 
dremel rotary tool. for more than 65 years, it's been the one tool 
to count on. Did I mention it cuts? My first boyfriend-- Rick whiting. 
I hadn't seen him in years. And we're at our 20th reunion catching 
up, and I get this terrible heartburn. But Rick hands me Zantac 75. 
"Thanks," I said. "So, did you ever become an accountant?" "No," he 
says, "A doctor." The medicine in Zantac 75 is the #1 doctor-prescribed 
acid reducer. It relieves even your toughest heartburn, controlling 
acid for up to 12 hours. Dr. Rick whiting. Zantac 75 for tough heartburn.
