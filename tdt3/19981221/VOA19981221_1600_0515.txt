The United Nations food or cultural organization or FAO says the food 
outlook for sub-Saharan Africa has improved over the past year. But 
as VOA correspondent, Alex Bolita reports from Johannesburg, the FAO 
says there are still several countries facing serious food problems 
largely because of civil strife. A new FAO report says food production 
has increased in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa over the past year, 
with above average to record harvests in several countries. As a result, 
the UN organization predicts food import requirements on the continent 
are likely to be lower than last year. Senior FAO Economist, Mueta 
Rukendeema tells reporters at a Johannesburg news conference that 
countries in the Sahel region of West Africa did especially well. 
Overall sub-Saharan Africa faces a more favorable food situation now, 
then last This is because there have been a good harvest in regions 
of, sub-regions of Africa, particularly the Sahel has done very well. 
They are expecting a record harvest. Mr. Rukendeemas says countries 
in East Africa, which have had food problems in the past, have also 
done well during the past year including Ethiopia. But he says a potential 
food crisis is unfolding in Somalia following five poor harvests, 
the result of draught, civil strife, flooding, and pest infestations. 
The Food and Agriculture Organization Economist says another facing 
a potential food emergency is Angola. The situation is deteriorating 
there fast, and while they had good production, the production has 
been better than last year. But if the situation deteriorates, as 
it seems to be, then you are going to have level of people, and therefore 
people in need of food, food assistance. Mr. Rukendeemas says the 
FAO is monitoring events in Angola closely. He says other countries 
being watched closely because of food problems include Congo Kinshasa, 
and Sudan. Alex Bolita, VOA News, Johannesburg.
