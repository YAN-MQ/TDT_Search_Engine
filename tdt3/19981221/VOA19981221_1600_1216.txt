National Football League Quarterback, Jake Plummer has reaped the 
benefits of playing well for the Arizona Cardinals, by receiving the 
largest signing bonus in league history. Plummer signed a 4-year contract 
extension, Monday, worth nearly 30 million dollars, including a huge 
15 million-dollar bonus. Known as Jake the Snake because of his elusiveness, 
Plummer has led the Plummers within sight of the team's first playoff 
appearance since 1982. Plummer says the big contract is a sign to 
the rest of the team that management is serious about building a wining 
franchise in Phoenix. It's a great sign to these guys that we are 
focused in on winning, and what we want to do is win ballgames, what 
ever it takes. And I'm just excited. I really feel lucky to be here 
in this opportunity at this moment, because we're going the right 
direction, and that's up. Previously the largest signing bonus had 
been a $13 million payment to Dion Sanders of the Dallas Cowboys.
