Scores of riot police were deployed around the U.S. and British embassies 
in Damascus on Monday, two days after demonstrators attacked the missions 
to protest military strikes against Iraq. The Syrian Foreign Ministry 
on Monday expressed regret over the attacks and pledged to upgrade 
security at diplomatic missions and international organizations. More 
than 1,000 demonstrators, mostly students, attacked the U.S. and British 
embassies and their cultural institutes Saturday to protest U.S. and 
British airstrikes on Iraq. The British ambassador to Damascus, Basil 
Eastwood, protested to Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa late 
Saturday for the attack on the British Embassy and British Council. 
According to a British Embassy statement, al-Sharaa offered a ``full 
apology and stressed that there will be suitable protection for all 
British buildings and nationals.''
