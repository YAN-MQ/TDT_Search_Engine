With the certainty of the snows now enveloping this tree-lined city, 
Tatyana Gofman predicts that Kazakhstan will soon sink into the economic 
crisis that has long affected so much of the world. She even knows 
when. ``After January 10,'' says Ms. Gofman, a clothing merchant who 
is discounting everything in her shop by 40 percent. Many of the million 
people in this city are nervous as Jan. 10 draws near, because, as 
people explain patiently, that is Election Day, when President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev seems almost assured of winning a new seven-year term. 
After that, voters say, he is expected to discard the artifices with 
which, seeking votes, he has kept the local currency stable, homes 
heated and state pensions paid. ``Of course there is going to be a 
crisis here,'' said Ms. Gofman, an ethnic Russian who sells jeans 
and shirts. ``How can there not be if there is one in Russia? Everyone 
is having these sales. They want to sell as much as possible now because, 
after Jan. 10, no one will buy anything.'' Foreign analysts in Kazakhstan 
agree that trouble is on the way, but they lay the blame not on government 
policies but on a drop in world commodity prices. For seven years, 
this republic of 16 million people has benefited from an enormous 
oil rush. Since the Soviet collapse, Almaty, a financial center in 
the foothills of a ski resort, has sprung to life with bars, restaurants 
and boutiques like Ms. Gofman's. And the republic's global profile 
has risen as the Clinton administration has embraced the entire Caspian 
Sea region as a key strategic and commercial interest. Today, however, 
local and Western economists suggest that a pause is under way in 
the Caspian oil rush. In its place are signs of an economic slump 
across the region. To the south and east, the currencies of Kyrgyzstan, 
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Georgia have plunged in recent months. 
Even Azerbaijan, which has attracted much foreign investment, recently 
had its largest oil consortium, led by British Petroleum and Amoco, 
suspend scheduled work on a 4-billion-barrel field that is already 
producing oil. The foreign analysts say the government's sensible 
monetary policies will cushion the blow, already being felt by neighbors 
like Russia, when trouble arrives. They do not fix a date for the 
onset of economic problems, nor blame electoral politics or Russia's 
financial collapse. Rather, analysts chiefly cite the brutal impact 
of low world commodity prices on poor nations that, pinning recovery 
hopes on oil, metal and agricultural sales, hesitated too long to 
diversify into private manufacturing and build a steady tax base. 
``These countries are in for some difficult times because they made 
some unrealistic assumptions, and now they are haunting them,'' said 
Hartmut Fischer, an economist here from San Francisco University who 
specializes in the region. After this year's 40 percent drop in world 
oil prices, Caspian region leaders are already discussing their plight. 
Nazarbayev is concentrating much of his re-election campaign not on 
promises calculated to please the electorate but on preparing his 
people for worse times ahead. ``It is absolutely clear that the threat 
of economic catastrophe is appearing slowly,'' Nazarbayev said in 
a recent speech. In a later interview, he said: ``I think that 1999 
and 2000 will be tough. It is a phase. We need to outlast it.''
