After 317 days in captivity in Chechnya a French aid worker was recently 
freed by Russian commandos in a gunfight that killed three kidnappers. 
The ending could have been quite different for the worker, Vincent 
Cochetel, 37. Other foreigners have been kidnapped in what appears 
to have become a routine way to raise cash in the breakaway Caucasus 
republic. The heads of four foreign hostages were found this month 
in a sack on a roadside. Their kidnappers are reportedly demanding 
ransom for the bodies. Cochetel, looking thin and wan, spoke to reporters 
after his return to Geneva last week, the end of an ordeal that began 
in the early hours of Jan. 29, when he was seized at his apartment 
by three masked men. Cochetel was head of the U.N. refugee agency 
office in Vladikavkaz, capital of North Ossetia, another Caucasus 
region that borders Chechnya. As with other foreigners who continue 
to take the risk of living and working in the Caucasus mountains, 
he said never believed that he would be kidnapped. French and U.N. 
officials negotiated for Cochetel's freedom. Despite many demands 
for ransom, the refugee agency said none was paid. The case attracted 
the attention of President Jacques Chirac of France, who contacted 
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia to urge the rescue. He was freed 
on Dec. 11, when, Cochetel recalled, he was awakened in the middle 
of the night, blindfolded and driven to the border between Chechnya 
and Ingushetia, another Russian republic, where Russian anti-terrorist 
forces were waiting. ``I didn't now whether I was being liberated,'' 
he said. ``The soldiers said nothing.'' He heard automatic gunfire, 
and with his handcuffed hands behind his back he tumbled out of the 
car to the ground. Two Russian soldiers dragged him to another vehicle. 
When he looked back, he added, he saw two cars that had exploded. 
The operation left three kidnappers dead. Cochetel was unharmed. Cochetel 
said he spent the first three days and nights of his captivity locked 
in the trunk of a car in freezing weather and without anything to 
eat. He was shuffled among 10 hiding places, he estimated. In each, 
he said, showing handcuff marks on his wrists, he was chained almost 
the entire time. He received a pail of water daily for drinking and 
washing and another to use as a toilet. ``I had 15 minutes of light 
each day either from a candle or a lantern,'' he said. ``Then they 
took it away when I finished my meal,'' the single daily meal that 
usually consisted of soup and bread. Cochetel lost 44 pounds in 11 
months. ``I was too heavy before,'' he said after arriving here, where 
he is being treated in a hospital.
