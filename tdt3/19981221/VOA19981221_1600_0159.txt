Former US Presidents Jerry Ford and Jimmy Carter are urging the US 
Senate to censure President Clinton for his misconduct. In a New York 
Times commentary the two former presidents, one a Republican, one 
a Democrat write that rehashing lurid details that led to his impeachment 
will only increase divisions. They suggest censure would end the impeachment 
ordeal and uphold the rule of law, without permanently damaging the 
presidency. Presidential Spokesman Joe Lockhart welcomed the former 
Presidents' remarks but added it is up to the Senate to act on the 
proposal. Mr. Lockhart says the Senate trial could vindicate the President 
by offering a more reasoned look at the facts. This process was not 
about the facts, there was no fact-finding that took place within 
the Judiciary Committee or within the House. It was simply a regurgitation 
of the referral that came from Mr. Starr. And it was -- what it was 
more about was politics. And the determined leadership of the Republican 
Party to push this process forward and try to remove the President 
from office. White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
