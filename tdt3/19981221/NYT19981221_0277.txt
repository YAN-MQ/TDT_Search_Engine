Q. Does the appendix have any use in the human body? A. The vermiform 
(Latin for worm-shaped) appendix, a dead-end branch of the intestines, 
plays at least a minimal role in the immune system and is also sometimes 
regarded as a potential spare part for replacing things like a diseased 
urinary bladder. Along with the adenoids, tonsils and spleen, the 
appendix is classified as part of the mucosal immune system, a secondary 
set of immune organs along the mucus-lined membranes of the body. 
This system is also called the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue, 
or MALT. Like the rest of the gut, the appendix contains nodules called 
Peyer's patches where certain types of immune cells mature and ``learn'' 
whether or not to react to foreign substances by calling in cellular 
troops to attack the invaders. This function of the appendix is most 
pronounced in the first few decades of life and declines thereafter. 
However, the appendix is not a specialized immune organ and is not 
essential to health. Dr. Carol Shoshkes Reiss, an immunologist at 
New York University, explains that it is a vestigial part of the gut 
that was important in animals whose diets were composed of more fiber 
than humans consume. It is not normally full of immune cells called 
lymphocytes, she said, ``except when it becomes infected, and since 
it is a pouch, this occurs with some frequency.'' Then lymphocytes 
and macrophages, which clean up microbial invaders, infiltrate in 
order to deal with the infection. Readers are invited to submit questions
