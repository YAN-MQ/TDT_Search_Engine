A lot of people think children watch way too much television. But 
it's hard to argue with the educational results of kids who produce 
their own TV shows. Dennis Michael reports. Hold it! I didn't take 
anything! An after-school special? In a sense, yes. In their free 
time, these kids are shooting a television show they conceived, wrote 
and produced. You having fun? Yeah. They're students taking part in 
"the story project," an innovative program that uses the resources 
of Hollywood to get kids interested in learning. Story project, everybody's 
doing it! We're not trying to develop people here for the entertainment 
industry, necessarily. This is just the hook that we're using to get 
them interested in writing and in reading and being literate, and 
it's working. The program is the brainchild of actress Dina Merrill 
and her husband, Ted hartley, head of rko. We recruited a number of 
writers and directors and created a 16-class syllabus which began 
with journal-keeping and worked through the various aspects of making 
a movie. You're not a man yet? You haven't hit that yet? I'm doing 
better in English now since I've got in this program. It's helped 
me with my poetry, as well as writing scripts. With the story project, 
it's a chance for me to put my creativity out there for everybody 
to see. This -- these are pictures of CDs, and it shows my love of 
music. The classes, taught at boys and girls clubs in Los Angeles, 
range from photography to improvisation. The emphasis is on writing 
and reading. You're really trying hard to practice and stretch for 
the tryouts. Definitely, you see a growth mentally, because they've 
learned stuff that they've never been exposed to before. We've seen 
that a lot of grades have improved, a lot of students have done better 
in school. Beside better grades, some kids in the program recently 
got another reward -- a trip to the premiere of Disney's new movie, 
"mighty Joe young." We got to walk up the red carpet. I know. I was 
so -- Walk on the red carpet! The premiere benefitted the story project, 
which hopes to expand. We're now at the end of our second year, and 
what started with a group of 16 students is now well over 150 and 
now in three locations, and we have applications now to broaden it 
even more. It's already broadening young minds. Dennis Michael, "CNN 
Entertainment News," Hollywood.
