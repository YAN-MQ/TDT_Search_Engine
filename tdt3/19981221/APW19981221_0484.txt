German air force reconnaissance jets have joined the chase for an 
extortionist suspected of carrying out three attacks on the country's 
railways, the government said Monday. A Defense Ministry spokesman 
refused to say exactly where along the 40,000-kilometer (25,000-mile) 
track network the Tornado planes were patrolling. The national rail 
company, Deutsche Bahn, says it has received four letters in the past 
week, apparently from the same person, demanding payment of 10 million 
marks (dlrs 6 million). Security already had been tightened on the 
railway following the attacks. Some 400 border police have been assigned 
to guard tracks, and helicopters also are being deployed. In the most 
serious incident tied to the extortion attempt, a cargo train carrying 
paper rolls derailed Friday near Anklam, 160 kilometers (100 miles) 
north of Berlin. No one was hurt. Earlier last week, rail workers 
discovered bolts had been loosened on the same line. Officials believe 
the tools to loosen them were stolen from the railway. A freight train 
in Berlin ran into 10 concrete flagstones on the tracks late Saturday. 
The train's snow shield pushed the stones off the tracks and it continued 
its journey undamaged. Also Saturday, a commuter train ran into six 
trees that someone had placed on the tracks. The train was damaged 
but continued its journey. Transport Minister Franz Muentefering said 
Monday he would spare no ``personnel, energy, money and technology'' 
to solve the case, which has unsettled Deutsche Bahn and travelers 
alike. But the head of Germany's rail union, Rudi Schaefer, said rail 
security was still flawed and must be improved. High-speed trains 
needed permanent observation, Schaefer told the Neue Osnabruecker 
Zeitung newspaper. Schaefer charged the head of Deutsche Bahn, Johannes 
Ludewig, had failed to properly inform railway employees and the union 
of the incidents.
