Just a month ago, markets here were rallying as the International 
Monetary Fund moved toward announcing a $41 billion bailout for Brazil. 
In a spree of optimism that some analysts warned was wildly excessive, 
Brazilian stocks rose 91 percent in a nine-week period through Nov. 
27, and 22.5 percent in November alone. There was no obvious cause 
for such enthusiasm, either in company performance or in the government's 
progress toward fiscal discipline. This month stocks are bouncing 
wildly again, but mostly in the opposite direction. As of Friday, 
they had fallen 21.5 percent. Although the benchmark Brazilian stock 
index shot up 6.19 percent Monday, at least some of the buying was 
attributed to market gains elsewhere. The underlying sense in Brazil 
is that more irrational selling is in store. ``I see it as unbridled 
pessimism, which has no foundation,'' said Rodrigo Fiaes, chief of 
equity research at Banco Icatu here. ``When the market was on the 
upswing, people were not discounting negatives. Now the market is 
only discounting the negatives, and not taking positive developments 
into account.'' Yet the urge to dump shares of Brazilian companies 
was not completely unwarranted, and some analysts consider it a correction 
of excessive confidence. Since the IMF bailout was announced, there 
have been some signs that the Brazilian Congress may not be as quick, 
or as pliant, in accepting the economic belt-tightening proposals 
of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration as investors 
had hoped. Congress rejected a proposal to make retired civil servants 
pay into the pension system, and it went home for the holidays without 
approving the government's revised 1999 budget, or extending and increasing 
a special financial-transactions tax that officials are counting on 
to meet revenue targets promised to the IMF. ``It's a razor-edge situation,'' 
said Edmar Bacha, executive director of BBA Securities in New York. 
``Because the price is not as low as indicating default, nor as high 
as indicating that Brazil is over the hump, there's a tremendous uncertainty 
right now as to which way Brazil is going to go. Is it Russia or Korea?'' 
Trading volume has fallen tremendously, with daily trades totaling 
$225 million toward the end of last week _ one-third of what they 
were before the global financial crisis began. With such low liquidity, 
the stock exchange has become a kind of fun-house mirror, magnifying 
small movements of capital at price extremes. At the end of 1997, 
about 30 percent of the trading was done by foreigners. By now, most 
foreign investors have fled. ``The market is leaving aside the fundamentals, 
and reacting strongly to any news related to Congress, or to the austerity 
package,'' said Roque Sut Ribeiro of the Marka Nikko Asset Fund here. 
Brazil's dollar reserves, now at $49 billion after it received a first 
installment of nearly $10 billion IMF aid in recent days, are still 
in decline. As of the end of last week, $2.64 billion had flowed from 
foreign reserves. If trading takes place among a smaller number of 
investors these days, the number of companies they are trading is 
also minuscule, compared with those traded on stock exchanges in the 
United States. Brazil's main index, the Bovespa in Sao Paulo, is made 
up of a handful of blue-chip companies, including Telebras, Petrobras 
and Eletrobras. Investors will be watching for new appointments that 
Cardoso is expected to make on Wednesday. He is expected to create 
some new jobs in his Cabinet, including a civilian minister of defense 
and, later, a minister of production who would wield considerable 
power. But the most important announcements for markets this week 
will involve appointments to head Petrobras; a savings institution, 
the Caixa Economica Federal; the Banco do Brasil; and the National 
Bank for Development. One name that has been mentioned to head the 
development bank is Maria Silvia Marques, the chief executive of CSN, 
the national steel company. Her appointment would be taken as a sign 
by investors that privatization would continue to be a government 
priority. ``If Cardoso can get it right, in the sense of sending a 
positive signal to the market,'' Fiaes said, ``and if the market will 
be satisfied with the options, we'll see a general improvement in 
sentiment toward Brazil.''
