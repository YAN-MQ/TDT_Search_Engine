hospital tonight, where doctors say it is far too early how many of 
the very premature eight will live. We get more on the remark annual 
arrival from NBC news correspondent Jim cummins. Texas octupletsemain 
in critical condition at this I.C.U. pediatrician says their big worry 
the lungs, small and weak. The babies are critically ill, we have 
a lot of hurdles. Baby A.T. first born, 12 days before the others 
is off a ventilator and doing better. After the first one was born 
the babies aligned themselves in such a Position that ultrasound was 
now able to show that there were seven remaining babies. The challenge 
-- delaying labor so the other seven can survive. Their mother, nkem 
chukwu rests upsidedown to relieve pressure on her lower body and 
fed through an I.V. no solid food to leave room for the other babs 
until Sunday when the seven babies arrived within secon of each other. 
Earlier doctors had asked the mother if she wanted to abort any of 
the fetus improving the odds for the others. Mom has very strong religious 
beliefs and this is not something we would entertain. Tonight all 
eight struggle to survive. But the doctors are most concerned habit

quite small. She would easily fit into the palm of her my hand. For
