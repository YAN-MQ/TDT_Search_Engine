With "operation desert fox" now over, and all quiet on the Iraqi front 
tonight, the Pentagon is telling and showing how much damage U.S. 
and british forces inflicted. And Iraq is defiant, and denying that 
it was all that bad. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski joins me now from the 
Pentagon. Tom, the Pentagon is doing everything it can to prove this 
mission was a success. But one official tells us tonight that over 
all, it's pretty unremarkable. Iraqi's digging out from under the 
rubble today, acting more defiant than defeated. Pictures of Saddam 
Hussein himself appeared on Iraqi TV, as if to show the world he had 
survived still one more U.S. bombing, as Iraqis play the victim, and 
call Americans the villain. They are criminals and this aggression 
is a criminal aggression. In four straight nights of air strikes, 
American forces launched 1,000 bombs and missiles. Saddam's special 
republican guards were primary targets. But Iraq claimed today only 
62 military were killed, 180 wounded. There were no firm numbers on 
civilian casualties. Still, at the Pentagon today, the commander of 
"operation desert fox" army general Anthony Zinni, reported that out 
of the targets, 85% were considered successful hits. I think the kinds 
of things that we went after -- equipment and infrastructure -- we 
were highly successful. But Zinni acknowledged that there's no evidence 
the air strikes took out a single chemical or biological weapon, and 
Iraq repeated today that after the air strikes, U.N. weapons inspectors 
will not be permitted back in the country. Former inspector Scott 
Ritter thinks Saddam is in better shape today, after air strikes. 
I think this is a very feel-good campaign, achieving very little of 
significance. It's estimated the operation cost upwards of $1 billion. 
Some in Congress wonder if it was worth it. I don't think we did as 
much as we needed to get done. If the point of it was degradation, 
somebody is going to have to explain to me what we degraded. Administration 
officials say that American forces are prepared to strike Iraq again 
if Saddam Hussein gets out of line, which will leave those American 
forces on a higher state of alert in the Persian gulf for as far as 
the eye can see. tom? Thanks very much. Jim Miklaszewski tonight at 
the Pentagon.
