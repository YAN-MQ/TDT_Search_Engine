Ten years ago today a terrorist bomb blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over 
lockerbie, Scotland. One service today will be at a memorial built 
thanks to one victim's mother. Kathleen Koch has the story. Like so 
many who lost loved ones in the 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 bombing, Jane 
Schultz comes to this memorial to find peace. On the tenth anniversary 
of the crash, Schultz also finds hope, hope that hints that Libya 
may turn over the bombing suspects means families may finally see 
the trial they've long campaigned for. This is something that we've 
been waiting for ten years. We have always just wanted that the truth 
be known to the world, and that justice be served. And I said, I want 
to take a picture of you. Schultz beams over the last photograph she 
took of her 21-year-old son Thomas. He was flying home from London 
when the plane blew up. Years since she's pressured president bush 
to pass anti-terrorism legislation. The president of the United States, 
accompanied by Jane Schultz. But many consider Schultz' greatest accomplishment 
the 1995 erection of this memorial at Arlington national cemetery 
to the 270 crash victims. The uphill battle took her more than three 
years. The most, I think, important focus for me was that maybe I 
would be able to give something back to the families. To help them 
heal. There's going to be no traffic going down. And as she organizes 
the tenth anniversary rememberance, Schultz' latest goal is personal 
healing. Really I guess to put -- try to put the pieces of my broken 
heart back together and move forward and to do whatever I can for 
peace. Peace an elusive goal for a woman who believes her son would 
be proud of what she's done. Yes, I think he would. I think he would 
say "good job, mom." Kathleen Koch, Arlington Virginia.
