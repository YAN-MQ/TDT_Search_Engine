This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Tuesday. It is turning wintry, as very cold high pressure 
builds through the central and eastern United States. A cold front 
will drop all the way down into Florida and the gulf coast, with some 
rain and snow in the forecast in south Texas and across New England. 
We'll also see cold weather building into the southeastern part of 
the country. Tuesday's highs -- subzero over the upper midwest and 
northern Rockies. We'll see temperatures below the freezing Mark from 
New York into Texas and across the pacific northwest. The only warm 
air really will be across Florida, where we'll see anything from 60s 
to a couple of 80s. Looking ahead to Wednesday, you can see how cold 
it's going to be across much of the country, with either snow in the 
Great Lakes to an icy mix down through the Ohio and Tennessee river 
valleys. On Thursday, we'll see precipitation mostly on the east coast 
and in the south, with some rain and snow in the northwest. Then for 
Friday, Christmas day, rain and snow from the Great Lakes to the gulf 
coast and in the northwest and still rather cool. Don't forget, four-day 
forecasts, 7,200 cities, at CNN.com.
