For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in London. 
The Israeli parliament has voted for an early general election. The 
draft legislation was passed during a debate about the government's 
handling of the peace process with the Palestinians. The bill still 
has to be approved at two further readings. But it's expected elections 
could be as early as March or April. The Palestinians insist Israel 
must continue to implement the Wye peace accord.
