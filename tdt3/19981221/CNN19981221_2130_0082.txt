Two former presidents are calling for an end to impeachment proceedings 
against President Clinton. In an op-Ed article in "the New York Times," 
presidents Gerald Ford and jimmy Carter say impeachment has already 
"brought profound disgrace" to Mr. clinton. They say the Senate should 
agree on a censure resolution. Mr. Ford and Mr. Carter referenced 
examples of pardon and Clemency in their own administrations. They 
say the Senate has a similar opportunity to promote healing.
