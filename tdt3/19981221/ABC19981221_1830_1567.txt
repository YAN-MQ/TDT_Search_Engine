Finally this evening, disaster at Christmas. That's what we called 
it ten years ago tonight when Pan Am 103 was blown out of the sky 
over Scotland taking so many lives and changing so many others. For 
many of the families who were left with so much less, anniversaries 
are a time to look for new strength. Here's ABC's Aaron brown. In 
the historic places where nations mourn and remember, the names were 
read. At Westminster in London and at the memorial at Arlington, eulogies 
were delivered. We dedicate this day of the winter solstice to the 
memory of all who were lost and the families who know the meaning 
like no one else can. Now, please join me -- People could close their 
eyes and still see that unforgettable image. 270 people died that 
day -- the youngest, 2 months. The oldest, 82. Average age just 27. 
35 of the dead were coming home to Syracuse, New York, students mostly, 
and they were remembered in a service there today. The dead included 
alexia tsairas, a budding photojournalist whose parents have set up 
a foundation so others will remember what they cannot forget. Initially, 
you work toward what they call closure. I don't think there is anything 
such as closure. Not for her and not for the lowenstiens, who returned 
this weekend to Lockerbie. Each trip back painful, none, though, like 
the first. We were taken by the farmer to the spot where our son landed. 
It was a small crater. It's quite possibly the most awful thing I've 
seen in my life, but I'm grateful that I saw it. This weekend, families 
were again welcomed in Lockerbie, as they had been ten years ago. 
And tonight, in the central church, they mourned together, bound together 
in tragedy. "It's hard to describe," said one man, "that such a tragedy 
could have fostered such a new group of friends, all of whom agree 
we wish we had never met." Aaron brown, ABC News.
