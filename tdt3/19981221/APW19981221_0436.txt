Prosecutors on Monday dropped murder charges against a nurse in the 
deaths of 22 patients at a home for the elderly, but left open the 
possibility she could be tried on other charges. The nurse was charged 
in October 1997, shocking a country that prides itself on its extensive 
social services and good medical care. At the time, police said the 
nurse also was suspected of embezzling 384,000 kroner (dlrs 60,000) 
from the victims. The 22 victims, aged 65 to 97, died after being 
given doses of a morphine-based drug while in the care of the Plejebo 
nursing home in downtown Copenhagen. The deaths occurred between August 
1994 and January 1997. The nurse, whose name cannot be released under 
court order, could still face other charges such as theft and embezzlement, 
prosecutor Karsten Hjorth said. The nurse was fired from the home 
in March 1997 after admitting to minor embezzlement.
