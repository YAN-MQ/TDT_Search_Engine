Joan Lunden for Claritin. For years, I tried to deal with seasonal 
allergies. I took a million different kinds of over-the-counter antihistamines-- 
had a Cupboard filled with allergy medications! They made me feel 
drowsy. Then my doctor prescribed nondrowsy, once-A-day Claritin. 
Claritin works for me. Claritin has a low occurrence... of side effects, 
such as headache, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth. After I talked 
to my doctor, I was amazed... how easit was to control my seasonal 
allergy symptoms.
