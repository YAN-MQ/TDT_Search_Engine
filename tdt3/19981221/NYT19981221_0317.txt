The full text of one of the briefer of the several score brief chapters 
in this collection of anecdotes and ruminations by Czeslaw Milosz 
is this: ``It looks as if that, ready, formed in every detail, waited 
nearby, at a hand's stretching, and had I caught it, I would not have 
drawn the thing out of the nothingness all around, but taken, as if 
from a shelf, an object already existing.'' You want to read that 
sentence a few times, striving to absorb its meaning, to puzzle out 
the identity of the rather vague ``that'' that is ``ready'' and ``formed 
in every detail.'' It seems most likely, though far from certain, 
that ``that'' is a poem or another work of the imagination and Milosz, 
the Polish writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980, is 
commenting on the difficulty inherent in poetic creation. The already 
existing, he seems to be saying, has a power that can block the writer's 
struggle to bring creation out of nothingness, so that the poet instead 
falls back on words, ideas, phrases already on the shelf. Mimicry, 
an unconscious absorption of the rhetorical culture, can take on an 
illusory sort of originality when in fact they make the poet not a 
creator but a conformist. Milosz's ``Roadside Dog'' is an elusive 
as well as allusive work, a book not exactly of poetry but not of 
prose either. It is composed mostly of fragments more or less in the 
tradition of Pascal's ``Thoughts,'' though generally it has more of 
a valedictory tone than a classically philosophical one. Some of Milosz's 
subjects are what one might expect of a poet whose life has extended 
for most of the century: memory, forgetfulness, aging and the depths 
to which human beings are capable of falling. Milosz, born in 1911, 
writes about writing, about poetry and about those very human frailties 
of resentment and self-importance. ``To believe you are magnificent,'' 
goes one very lapidary and especially valedictory passage. ``And gradually 
to discover that you are not magnificent. Enough labor for one human 
life.'' ``Roadside Dog'' is, in other words, a difficult pleasure, 
but it is a pleasure. Milosz speaks, as he has in his many earlier 
works, in phrases that seem almost ordinary, stylistically unexceptional, 
but that are in fact cryptic, compact and as closely carved as pieces 
of Chinese ivory. It is difficult to isolate an overriding preoccupation 
here, but one can recognize a basic recurring concern in Milosz's 
mystical and difficult fragments. It is the battle against nothingness, 
the need to forge some sort of order, moral and spiritual, out of 
the chaos represented by the history of recent decades. In one passage, 
for example, titled ``Watering Can,'' Milosz talks of the way in which 
the movies and photography have created the habit of paying attention 
to things as well as people, to ``a multitude of objects.'' He concludes, 
``Precisely in this, in our clinging to distinctly delineated shapes, 
does our hope reside, of salvation from the turbulent waters of nothingness 
and chaos.'' In one of his more explicitly political ruminations, 
Milosz writes of the slaughter of the Warsaw ghetto and how such a 
tragedy might in a way be easier for an atheist than a believer. The 
atheist, Milosz writes, is freed ``from a quarrel with the Creator 
who must be held responsible for the suffering of human beings.'' 
The atheist ``should accept the world as it is'' with murder of the 
weak by the strong an ordinary part of nature. But it is ``whence 
comes our protest, our scream: No!'' he writes, that separates humans 
from nature and ``makes us a lonely species.'' Is this argument for 
the ``peculiar place of man'' an argument for the existence of God? 
Milosz, who writes of being a Roman Catholic but makes few other explicit 
references to religion, seems to be speaking for the existence of 
a higher power. But he speaks for that presence directly in a few 
concise sentences and without flinching in the face of the most powerful 
case that can be made against it. Other fragments are less weighty, 
including some brief reminiscences about Poland and the world before 
the cataclysm of World War II. The very phrase ``roadside dog'' that 
gave Milosz his title comes from a memory (or perhaps from Milosz's 
imagination) of traveling in a horse-drawn cart from village to village 
in some unnamed old country at the beginning of the century. Always, 
Milosz writes, ``we were barked at by a dog, assiduous in its duty.'' 
The suggestion is that these essays are like apocrypha, secondary 
and somewhat random reflections, not part of one's main body of work. 
In one of the longer chapters that come in the second half of the 
volume, Milosz writes about fleas, about how we have forgotten that 
for much of history people lived lives afflicted by parasites that 
``the civilization of politeness'' required them to pretend did not 
exist. Often Milosz seems to invoke secondary events to shed light 
on more central concepts. He begins a chapter called ``Ancestors,'' 
for example, with the startling statement ``To tell the truth, we 
should not exist.'' He reminds us of the unspeakable hardships suffered 
by past generations who ``died like flies from epidemics, from starvation, 
from wars, and though children swarmed, for every 12 of them only 
one or two survived.'' For one family line to have survived is veritably 
miraculous, Milosz concludes, leaving us with one of his densely suggestive 
ideas: ``Our species should have disappeared a long time ago, and 
it is still alive, incredibly resistant. That you and I happen to 
be part of it should be enough to give us pause for meditation.''
