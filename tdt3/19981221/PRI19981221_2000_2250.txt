Today, the sun's light will swiftly wane and dusk will creep across 
the winter sky. In other words, it's the start of winter, which plays 
a role in today's geography quiz. We're in search of an ancient city 
where the winter solstice was reverently observed in honor of Mithras, 
the god of light. His cult began in ancient Iran and spread to our 
mystery location in the second and third centuries A.D. Soldiers were 
the main patrons of this faith. They performed secret ceremonies in 
subterranean temples. This very day was revered since they believed 
it was the yearly nativity of the sun. By the fourth century, the 
cult of Mithras declined after the emperor Constantine became a Christian. 
Today, the city is the holy center for the Catholic faith. Guessed 
it yet? We'll shed a little light on the answer a little later.
