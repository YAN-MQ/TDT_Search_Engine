Audiences are giving the new movie "you've got mail" a stamp of approval. 
The romantic comedy was the number one film at the box office this 
weekend, earning $18.7 million. The movie reunites Meg Ryan and Tom 
Hanks. "The prince of Egypt" was in second place, opening to solid, 
but unspectacular business. The animated story of Moses brought in 
just over $14 million. It's receiving strong competition from "A bug's 
life." The Disney animated feature finished in third place with $9.5 
million.
