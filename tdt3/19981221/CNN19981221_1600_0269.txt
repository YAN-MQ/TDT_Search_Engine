Two former presidents are calling on the Senate to end the impeachment 
proceedings against President Clinton. Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, 
in a "New York Times" editorial, say the senate should embrace a bipartisan 
censure resolution stating that Mr. clinton lied under oath. They 
say impeachment by the House of Representatives has "already brought 
profound disgrace to Mr. Clinton." Democrats contend a Senate trial 
would tie up the three branches of government for the next four months.
