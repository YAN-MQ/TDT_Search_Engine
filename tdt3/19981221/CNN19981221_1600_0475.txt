First -- the extended national weather forecast. This is a look at 
your "CNN Headline News Weather," begins with our forecast weather 
map for this evening. You can see the cold front continue its movement 
to the east coast behind this front, snowfall along the front, rainfall. 
And mixed in between, some ice. It's been a problem throughout the 
day today in parts of the midwest. Area of high pressure is moving 
in behind this, and that means that by tomorrow night, things dry 
out throughout much of the nation, although it will remain rather 
cold, daytime highs today, only in the single digits for much of the 
midwest, the northern plains see highs remaining below zero throughout 
much of the day. Relatively warm today in parts of the southeast. 
In your extended forecast, that rainy, snowy mix is expected in parts 
of the middle and lower Mississippi river valley as we move into Wednesday. 
The temperatures warm just a bit. Thursday, rain showers possible 
along the gulf coast. Snow showers possible in the Great Lakes area. 
And as we move on into the latter part of the week, we'll be looking 
at a Bit of rainfall still in parts of the south and icy mix possible 
in the Great Lakes area. For more weather information, log on to CNN.com.
