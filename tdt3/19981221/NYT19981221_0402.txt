Linda Tripp, world-famous taper of presidential inamorata, was back 
at her office in the Pentagon on Monday after working from home at 
her $90,000-a-year job while the wheels of justice ground their way 
through the last 11 months to the impeachment of the commander in 
chief. ``She was in, but she's gone,'' a secretary told a visitor 
at room 1E776 in the outermost of the Pentagon's five rings. Festooned 
with a door-front Christmas wreath, the office houses the Pentagon's 
Institute for Planning and Long Range Preparation, a typically plain 
workplace that Mrs. Tripp was freed from using under a government 
arrangement known as flexi-place. She rocketed to the heights of Washington 
controversy when she shared with criminal and civil investigators 
the fruits of her furtive tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky. Mrs. 
Tripp's anguished declaration to the nation as the year luridly roared 
forward _ ``I am you'' _ has become one of the folkloric quotations 
of the presidential scandal, ranking with the utterance of William 
Ginsburg, Ms. Lewinsky's first lawyer: ``No one ever lies. People 
often do what they have to do to make their story sound right.'' Along 
the catacomb-like corridors of the Pentagon, Linda Tripp sightings 
have been claimed in recent days by passing military professionals 
as if they had glimpsed one of the F-117 ``stealth'' attack-fighters 
designed to fall upon the enemy without ever being seen by eye or 
radar. ``I spotted her with her publicist,'' one alert colonel announced 
tersely to a friend. For months, the Pentagon has been extremely reluctant 
to discuss Mrs. Tripp's work situation and no new word was offered 
Monday. Mrs. Tripp's return occurred on a gray day when the capital 
city struggled to find some post-impeachment serenity. President Clinton 
volunteered at a soup kitchen, ladling tomato sauce over pasta and 
wishing Congress a merry Christmas as his aides strategized privately 
to spare him a Senate conviction and expulsion from office. He also 
played host at the Winter Holiday Festival _ the annual Christmas 
party for news workers, many of whom were tracking the president's 
year of scandal and impeachment even as they took time out for the 
White House wassail. ``This is payback time,'' one journalist commented 
evenly, jammed amid a throng of 4,000 invitees wending their way toward 
a South lawn tent where they found cookies, soft drinks, beer, wine 
and coffee plus a platoon of clowns to amuse the young ones in the 
crowd. Miffed journalists noted there were none of the more sumptuous 
offerings _ lamb chops and the like _ of the more commodious media 
parties thrown by the president last year, a month before the press 
plunged into the Lewinsky scandal. Celebrants were distracted by media 
celebrities intent on a moment's seasonal peace amid the impeachment 
story. ``Where are the clowns?'' a small boy asked Bob Novak, who 
seemed Dickensian as he put aside his usual ``Crossfire'' scowl to 
smile upon the lad. ``Isn't this nice?'' Geraldo Rivera asked his 
little children as they approached the richly twinkling White House 
Christmas tree. ``This is where the president gets his presents,'' 
said Rivera, who has been as tireless as Santa every night on cable 
television searching out who's been good and bad in the Clinton scandal. 
The city's impeachment anxieties were not easy to put aside. For some 
reason, one of the first portraits displayed beyond the entryway was 
of Andrew Johnson, the 19th century president who preceded Clinton 
in impeachment and survived conviction by a single Senate vote. The 
slow going by the thick mob of party invitees lent a Jackson-era aura 
of heatedness to the evening, particularly when some veteran White 
House reporters were stopped at the door, informed their names were 
not to be found on the computerized security check list. ``You're 
destroying my reputation!'' one of them angrily announced, dressing 
down security workers and unleashing cell phone alarums to various 
White House sources. At the Pentagon, the president smiled gently 
upon one and all passing what Mrs. Tripp termed the ``jumbo'' office 
photos that Ms. Lewinsky used to muse upon in her tell-all conversations. 
As the world's largest office building, spilling up and out through 
Dantesque office rings, the Pentagon would seem like an ideal place 
to go unnoticed, with security clearances at all the entrances and 
hordes of workers in the halls. But not for Mrs. Tripp, and not in 
this tumultuous year. Other federal workers in the vast bureaucracy 
have closely tracked her working arrangements and salary, which doubled 
since she worked at the White House for the first two years of the 
Clinton administration. Under her job, involving computer planning 
work on the Pentagon's annual Joint Civilian Orientation Conference, 
Pentagon officials confirmed Mrs. Tripp would be eligible for the 
proposed 4.4 percent wage increase announced Monday by the Clinton 
administration.
