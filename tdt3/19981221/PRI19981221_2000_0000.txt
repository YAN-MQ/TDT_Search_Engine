From Public Radio International, this is The World -- a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH Boston. It's Monday, December 
21. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. Today -- the view from Baghdad. The 
Iraqis have no great love for their leader, but even less for the 
United States. The view from Washington now that the air strikes have 
ended. What next? Lawmakers debate a leader's political fate in Washington 
and in Jerusalem. Also, we check up on some of the world's great dictators. 
A nation of blue-eyed blondes. We'll have a blond Europe, a blond 
Asia, a blond America. A blond world. And a brunette dictator. Dictator 
of the world. Destiny. First, though, this news.
