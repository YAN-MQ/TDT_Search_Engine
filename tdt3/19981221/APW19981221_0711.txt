Sudan's Parliament on Monday accepted the resignation of its speaker 
as part of a political shuffle that is expected to preserve his role 
as the most influential person in the country. The 400-seat Parliament 
has accepted the resignation of Hassan Turabi, Egypt's Middle East 
News Agency reported from the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. It gave 
no other details. The report could not be immediately confirmed. The 
resignation must now be approved by President Omar el-Bashir, but 
that is considered a formality. Turabi had announced his resignation 
on Dec. 2 to work full time for the governing National Congress party, 
whose monopoly on politics will end next year under a law passed Dec. 
9. The Political Associations Law, which comes into effect Jan. 1, 
allows for the formation of political groups that may contest elections. 
El-Bashir, who banned all political parties after seizing power in 
a 1989 military coup, said recently that the door was open for opposition 
figures in exile to come back and form political associations. But 
the presence of the hard-line Turabi at the head of Parliament had 
cast doubts on the seriousness of the government's willingness to 
allow the opposition to flourish. Political analysts interpreted Turabi's 
resignation as a government attempt to ease those fears. However, 
there is still some apprehension because the new law only speaks of 
``political associations.'' Turabi was strongly opposed to some Parliament 
members' demand for a clear-cut reference to ``political parties.''
