Spina bifida can be damaging to a baby. The spinal column doesn't 
dwep properly. Doctors at the children's hospital in Philadelphia 
are using a technique to lessen the severity of the disorder. They've 
performed their first such operation on a fetus after discovering 
the presence of spina bifida during a routine ultrasound. The vurgry 
was performed when the mother was just five months pregnant. You're 
trying to use the surrounding tissues there in the back and then basically 
sew things up so the developing spinal cord has some element of protection. 
There are only two centers in the world that offer the treatment. 
And some doctors think it's still too risky since spina bifida is 
not life threatening. Surgeons at the children's hospital still don't 
know whether the surgery worked. They're still waiting to see if their 
first patient walks. Check out CNN.com/health for the latest health 
news on line. For "your health," Christy law son, "Headline News."
