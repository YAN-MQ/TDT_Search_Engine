US General Anthony Zenie who ran the four-day US led bombing of Iraq, 
is denying Baghdad's claim that civilian areas were attacked. He says 
US and British planes and missiles struck only military bases and 
industrial plants linked to banned weapons. General Zenie says allied 
forces are ready to strike again on short notice if it is determined 
Iraq is trying to restart banned weapons programs. General Zenie's 
Pentagon briefing, Monday, followed claims of heavy civilian casualties 
by Iraq. The United Nation's Security Council will meet again, Tuesday, 
to assess the Iraq situation.
