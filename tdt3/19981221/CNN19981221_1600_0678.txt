Spina bifida can be devastating to a family. The birth defect occurs 
when the spinal column doesn't develop properly. A condition that 
can lead to paralysis. Now, doctors at the children's hospital in 
Philadelphia are using a Surgical technique to try to lessen the severity 
of the disorder. They've performed their first such operation on a 
fetus after discovering the presence of spina bifida during a routine 
ultrasound. The surgery was performed when the mother was just five 
months pregnant. You're trying to use the surrounding tissues there 
in the back, and then basically sew things up so that the developing 
spinal cord has some element of protection. There are only two centers 
in the world that offer the treatment. And some doctors think it's 
still too risky, since spina bifida is not life-threatening. Surgeons 
at the children's hospital still don't know whether the surgery worked. 
They're still waiting to see if their first patient walks. Check out
