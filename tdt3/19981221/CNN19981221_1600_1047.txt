As for the U.S. economy, the IMF said despite slowing growth, there 
is no need to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. Federal 
reserve policymakers are, in fact, meeting tomorrow to determine the 
course of short-term rates. The fed is expected to leave them unchanged. 
It will be the fed's final meeting of the year. Most analysts on Wall 
Street think that the central bank will sit tight until at least the 
first few months of 1999.
