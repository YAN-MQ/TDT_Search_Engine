People in Britain and the United States have paused to observe the 
exact moment, ten years ago, when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded and crashed 
over Lockerbie Scotland. 270 people died in the terrorist bombing, 
December 21, 1988 at Universal Time. Two Libyans are suspected. The 
United States and Britain warned Libya today, tighter sanctions will 
be sought unless the suspects are handed over by the end of February.
