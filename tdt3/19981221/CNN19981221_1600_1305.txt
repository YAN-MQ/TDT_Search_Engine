The dolphins can advance to the playoffs with a win. Tonight's game 
was supposed to be about seeking to protect the heritage of the 1972 
dolphins. Now it's about a win tonight. A win over the fal cans next 
week also. It's the struggle to win to get in the playoffs against 
the best team in the league. Obviously, other people will make more 
out of it. It's not known in Jimmy Johnson will be on the side lines 
due to the passing of his mother today.
