Three men hoping to be the first to circle the world by balloon neared 
China early Friday, still hoping for permission to fly on a northerly 
course but fearing that they may be ordered to abandon their quest. 
``We are effectively in an emergency situation,'' said British tycoon 
Richard Branson, who has teamed with American Steve Fossett and Sweden's 
Per Linstrand. ``But we are friends with the Chinese people, and this 
is a sporting event, an adventure. We have no choice but to go over 
China, and we would be enormously grateful if they let us in,'' Branson 
said Thursday. China had given permission for the ICO Global balloon 
to travel in its airspace south of 26 degrees north latitude. But 
because of diversions around Mediterranean storms and Iraq, the balloon 
crossed the Himalayas further north than planned. Because of the rugged 
Himalayan terrain, the balloon had no place to land before reaching 
China, project director Mike Kendrick said. ``The Chinese are very 
friendly. I've apologized to them,'' Kendrick said. ``It is their 
airspace. They are entitled to keep us out. I have no argument with 
that at all, but we are appealing to them.'' Britain's Foreign Office, 
which was in touch with Chinese officials in an effort to get permission 
for the flight, advised the balloonists that they must follow any 
orders from China once they are over its territory. At the same time 
diplomats were seeking Chinese help for the balloonists, a senior 
official, Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett, was criticizing 
China for the 13 year prison sentence given to dissident Xu Wenli 
on Monday. ``I was shocked to learn today at the speed with which 
Mr. Xu Wenli was tried, and the severity of his sentence,'' Fatchett 
said. The balloonists also had a problem before crossing Libya, when 
permission was unexpectedly revoked. That was resolved on Saturday 
just before the balloon entered Libyan airspace. The 270-foot (82-meter) 
balloon reached the Himalayas after a quiet day Sunday crossing Turkmenistan 
in Central Asia and flying over Afghanistan. Over the weekend, the 
team had faced fierce thunderstorms and was forced to follow a narrow 
corridor in the Caucasus to avoid flying over Iraq, Iran and Russia, 
which had denied permission to use their airspace. Branson and Lindstrand 
have already beaten their personal best of 48 hours in a hot air balloon 
during a 1991 crossing of the Pacific. Fossett has made four tries 
to ring the globe. On the last, he was lucky to survive when his balloon 
tore in a thunderstorm, after traveling 15,000 miles (24,000 kms). 
Branson has tried, and failed, four times to become the first to circle 
the world non-stop in a balloon. Improved technology has been used 
to make this balloon, including a canopy of Kevlar of the kind used 
for bulletproof vests. The crew members estimate the trip could last 
from eight days to nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere 
in western Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, 
which will take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific 
and the United States. The team secured permission from 97 countries 
for overflights and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, 
Russia and North Korea. At least three other crews have been waiting 
for favorable weather to launch balloons _ from Albuquerque, New Mexico, 
Loves Park, Illinois, and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team plans to 
take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.
