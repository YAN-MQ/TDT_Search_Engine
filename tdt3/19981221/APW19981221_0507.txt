Germany's Deutsche Bank signed an agreement to buy a 10 percent stake 
in Greece's Eurobank in the first partnership of its kind between 
a Greek and major foreign bank, the two banks said Monday. The price 
of the acquisition, which is part of a strategic partnership between 
the two banks, was not announced. ``The alliance with Eurobank is 
a further step in Deutsche Bank's European expansion,'' said a joint 
statement issued by the two sides. The German bank said it took an 
interest in the Greek market due to the country's anticipated participation 
in European economic and monetary union and the market's growth potential. 
``Today Greece is in a position to become an EMU member in the foreseeable 
future,'' said Brend Albrecht von Maltzan, a member of the German 
bank's divisional board for retail and private clients. Greece hopes 
to join the European Union's single currency by 2001. ``The market 
is still underbanked. Consequently the timing is ideal for us as it 
will enable us to participate in the market's development,'' he added. 
Two board members from Deutsche Bank will join the board of directors 
of Eurobank, the second-largest private bank in Greece. The partnership 
will focus on private banking activities, asset management and selected 
investment banking products, the banks said. Cooperation will be extended 
in the future to business areas such as insurance and transaction 
services. ``The aim of Deutsche's European strategy is to be the leader 
in the distribution of financial services and gathering assets in 
Europe,'' von Maltzan said Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank bought 
the U.S. Bankers Trust and the Belgian unit of Credit Lyonnais. It 
has also made selective acquisitions in Italy and Spain. ``For Eurobank, 
the alliance with Deutsche Bank is an opportunity to ... strengthen 
its competitive position in the rapidly evolving Greek banking system,'' 
said Eurobank's Managing Director Nicholas Nanopoulos. Eurobank has 
been expanding within the Greek market, with acquisitions including 
the Bank of Crete and an estimated 20 percent stake in Ergobank, a 
major Greek private bank.
