Iraq on Monday rejected suggestions that it might change its decision 
to end cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors if the composition 
or leadership of the inspection teams was changed. At a news conference, 
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz brushed aside a proposal from President 
Jacques Chirac of France under which U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq 
over its invasion of Kuwait would be lifted while a new team of inspectors 
monitors sites where Iraq is suspected of producing weapons of mass 
destruction. He condemned Chirac's proposal for ``concentrating on 
Iraq selectively'' and asked, ``Why doesn't he make a proposal to 
look after what Israel has?'' Aziz also said that reconstituting the 
inspection teams under a chairman other than Richard Butler, whose 
work he has sharply criticized, would not be acceptable. ``Richard 
Butler is a cheap pawn in the hands of the Americans,'' Aziz said. 
``He is not the issue. The issue is the American and British position 
during the whole period, which prevented the Security Council from 
making any serious effort to lift the sanctions.'' Aziz reiterated 
the country's position, expressed after U.S. and British bombing raids 
began last week, that it has decided to halt all cooperation with 
U.N. weapons inspectors. ``The weapons inspections were killed by 
the American and British missiles,'' he said. ``I cannot give them 
another life.'' Aziz said Iraq would not accept any resumption of 
inspections until the United Nations votes for a ``condemnation of 
the aggressor'' and lifts the economic sanctions it imposed on Iraq 
eight years ago. ``Without that it will be difficult for Iraq to talk,'' 
he said. ``How can I receive a suggestion from a party that does not 
condemn the aggression? How can I discuss a solution if that solution 
does not include an end to the sanctions?'' In condemning Chirac's 
proposal, Aziz said: ``In all this bombing, not a trace of chemical 
or biological weapons was detected. All this rhetoric about weapons 
of mass destruction is a big lie.'' By ending its cooperation with 
weapons inspectors, Iraq risked further isolating itself at a time 
when it appeared to be winning at least grudging sympathy from France, 
Russia, China and several Islamic nations. It also effectively challenged 
the United States and Britain to see if they can sustain a policy 
of periodic bombing of Iraq, which they may now decide is the only 
way to control what they say is President Saddam Hussein's deadly 
arsenal. Aziz described the Clinton administration as criminal and 
accused Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain of turning his country 
into ``a tail of the fox that is in Washington.'' ``We shall never 
accept any conditions made by Clinton or Blair,'' he said. ``I refuse 
all these conditions totally and strongly. ``We did not damage our 
relations with the United Nations. They damaged the United Nations 
itself. They acted according to the law of the jungle. They did not 
act according to international law. It is their responsibility to 
rebuild their relations with the international community and their 
relations with the Security Council and the United Nations.'' The 
weapons inspectors made thousands of inspections and installed scores 
of cameras and monitoring devices in factories and other facilities. 
They repeatedly complained, however, that Iraqi officials were denying 
them access to suspicious sites and seeking to impede and limit their 
work. The United Nations has said it would not lift sanctions until 
the inspectors certify that Iraq is not hiding nuclear, chemical or 
biological weapons or the means to deliver them. At his news conference 
Monday, Aziz, who was dressed in military fatigues, also gave the 
first full Iraqi assessment of the damage from last week's bombing 
raids. He said 62 Iraqi officers and soldiers had been killed and 
another 180 wounded. Although he gave no figures for civilian casualties, 
he said they were ``much higher.'' He said bombs had hit military 
barracks and government offices, but charged that others had fallen 
on ``hospitals, private homes, schools and other civilian sites.'' 
Aziz's assessment of the damage contrasted sharply with that of U.S. 
and British officials, who have asserted that their bombs fell only 
on military targets. Asked about the U.S. decision to close embassies 
in Africa temporarily because of the threat of terrorist reprisals, 
Aziz replied: ``America is afraid of the people because America is 
a criminal, and I mean the American administration. They know that 
the people in the world hate them, hate them because they are criminals.'' 
Aziz also ridiculed U.S. and British hopes that bombing raids would 
spark an uprising against the Iraqi government. ``This is Rambo-like 
fantasy,'' he said. ``The Iraqi people strongly and genuinely support 
their leadership.''
