Even in this brave new world of reproductive technology, ak the up 
lets are clearly with exception. But thanks to technology 75,000 children 
in this country are alive tonight. The technology can give women, 
not just one baby, but many. Robert Bazell continues our "in depth" 
reporting with the question, how many are too many? The seven healthy 
children born to Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey last year in Iowa offered 
a heartwarming story with a happy ending. But many experts warn it 
often does not turn out so well. When you deliver higher-order multiple 
fetuses, it's not necessarily a Positive outcome. Indeed, if they 
survive, infants as tiny and premature as those in Houston face a 
long list of potential physical and mental disabilities. The nervous 
system is still developing. And the earlier a baby is born, the higher 
chance of developmental problems. The Houston mom, like Bobbi McCaughey 
took fertility drugs, which increase the risk of multiple births. 
Indeed, the number of births of twins or more jumped 344% from 1980 
to 1996. But doctors say that while twin, or even triplet births are 
inevitable, larger numbers are not. Experts say the births of lots 
of babies at once following the administration of fertility drugs 
is often avoidable, and can be the result of irresponsible medicine. 
The reason? Doctors give the drugs in two stages. If ultrasound or 
blood tests show that a woman is developing too many eggs, the doctor 
does not have to give the second hormone injection, thus preventing 
the pregnancy. And some say laws are needed to make sure doctors practice 
properly. I think the law and regulation of reproductive technology 
is just lagging behind where the power of this technology actually 
is at. If a woman does find herself pregnant with multiple fetuses, 
there is another option called selective reduction, aborting some 
so the others can survive. This woman, who found herself pregnant 
with ten, did just that, then had healthy twins. But the Houston woman, 
like Bobbi McCaughey, rejected that option because of personal beliefs. 
Such difficult dilemmas can put mothers and babies at great risk.
