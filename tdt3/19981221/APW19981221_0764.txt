Kevin Fisher swore he hadn't been drinking when he called police to 
say he had spotted a wallaby under a lamppost in this central England 
city _ on Reindeer Road, no less. ``Mr. Fisher couldn't believe his 
eyes and sounded quite shaken. He swore blind he was still sober,'' 
a Staffordshire Police spokesman who was not identified told Press 
Association, the British news agency. ``Luckily, we took him seriously,'' 
the spokesman said. ``Though at first we were tempted to tell him 
to hop it.'' Willy the wallaby, a member of the kangaroo family, had 
escaped from a nearby animal park, but was captured after Fisher called 
police Saturday night. The park said it had not yet located Willy's 
secret escape route.
