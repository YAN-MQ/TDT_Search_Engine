Life may offer a smoother ride for a once blind horse in Colorado. 
The animal, which appeared to be destined for a slaughterhouse, can 
now see, thanks to successful cataract surgery. Linda Denzel of our 
affiliate kcnc has the story. Tucker is almost a year old now. He 
can see for the first time in his life. This has been a milestone 
weekend for this thoroughbred. The doctor has released Tucker to go 
outside and to have exercise now. And it's just a matter of however 
long it takes us to find the right home for him now. Tucker was born 
blind and sold for slaughter before Colorado horse rescue stepped 
in. Generous coloradans donated money for his surgery. Now he can 
see, but he'll need a very special home. We're looking for somebody 
that has experience with horses and training young horses, because 
he does need a lot of training and handling. Most horses Tucker's 
age know simple commands, like "walk," "Stop," "trot" and "no." Because 
of his blindness, Tucker was afraid to move. Now he's making up for 
lost time. Right now, he still doesn't know how to behave. You know, 
you take him for a walk, and you tell him "walk," and he has no idea 
what you're telling him. He wants to go run and play. So he's quite 
a 700-pound handful to go out and take for a walk. Because he's such 
a handful, Colorado horse rescue doesn't think he'd be a good horse 
for a child. He's so full of energy now because he can see. He wants 
to go there now. Tucker will need plenty of patience, love and training. 
Walk. no. no. no. no. He wants to run and play and doesn't want to 
slow down, so -- Kind of drags you along? One extreme to the other. 
Yes, he does. You take him for a long walk, and you're worn out by 
the time you get back. Prospective adopters should also know that 
Tucker's sight will never be perfect. But with training, he'll make 
a wonderful riding horse someday. This is a tough time of year for 
Colorado horse rescue. They're caring for more than 40 horses. The 
volunteers here would love it if all of them found good homes for 
christmas. That was reporter Linda Denzel of affiliate kcnc in Denver.
