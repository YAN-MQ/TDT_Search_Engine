Hermann Maier led an Austrian parade down the legendary Patscherkofel 
Olympic course and up the scoreboard. The ``Herminator'' won Monday's 
super-giant slalom and was followed immediately by eight of his countrymen, 
the first time a country has swept the top nine places in an Alpine 
World Cup event. Racing on the same course where Franz Klammer captured 
the 1976 Olympic title, Maier and his teammates thrilled a huge home 
crowd, including many children who were given the day off to watch 
their heroes. ``It was a sensational race for me and for the team. 
We need more races like this ... I skied (far) away from the ideal 
line and I struggled to win on this track, as Klammer did to achieve 
his Olympic victory,'' Maier said. With Klammer in the finish area 
to congratulate his countrymen, Maier finished the 1,947-meter course 
in 1 minute, 23.52 seconds. Christian Mayer was .76 of a second behind 
and Fritz Strobl another hundredth back to place second and third 
and fill the podium with Austrians in the third super giant slalom 
race of the season. Stephan Eberharter was fourth followed by Rainer 
Salzgeber and Hans Knauss. After the race finally got underway 65 
minutes late due to fog, Patrick Wirth, Andreas Schifferer and Werner 
Franz finished seventh, eighth and ninth to make the race look like 
the Austrian national championships before Norway's Lasse Paulsen 
ended the domination by finishing in 10th, 1.01 seconds behind. Previously, 
the best team showing dated back to 1968, when the French women swept 
the top six places in a downhill race at Abetone, Italy. Austrians 
gave an indication of their dominance last month by taking the top 
five places in a super-giant slalom at Aspen, Colorado. Maier's third 
victory of the season _ and 13th of his World Cup career _ vaulted 
the defending World Cup champion back to the top of the overall standings. 
With 540 points from 12 races, Maier moved past Norway's Lasse Kjus 
by three points. Kjus slipped to second place with a 14th-place finish 
in Monday's race. Mayer moved into third with 462 points, ahead of 
Eberharter. Maier also piled up a commanding lead of 280 points, 50 
more than Eberharter, in the super-giant slalom standings. The Austrian 
superstar, who finished fourth in the two previous races in Val Gardena 
and Alta Badia, had to recover from a near crash at midcourse when 
his hand touched the snow while clearing a gate. ``The course was 
perfect, and the fans gave me a big boost,'' Maier said. ``I just 
wanted to win here. This race was very special to me.'' Strobl, who 
reaced the podium despite starting 45th, said the team success ``took 
a lot of pressure off of us.'' ``Third place also gives me a lot of 
morale for coming races. We certainly have the best Super-G team.'' 
The men's World Cup circuit will break until reconvening Dec. 29 in 
Bormio, Italy. The Austrians, who already have six victories in slalom, 
giant slalom and super-g, will try for the fourth time to win their 
first downhill of the season.
