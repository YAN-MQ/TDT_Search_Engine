This is "CNN Headline News." Good morning, I'm Linda Stouffer. Thank 
you for joining us. Despite impeachment, it's business as usual for 
President Bill Clinton. Today, he visits a volunteer kitchen in Washington, 
attends a memorial service at Arlington cemetary for victims of Pan 
Am Flight 103 and hosts a Holiday party for members of the press. 
Meanwhile, his attorneys are considering challenging the legality 
of President Clinton's impeachment. They claim, if the 105th Congress 
impeached Mr. Clinton, then it may be unconstitutional for a different 
Congress, the 106th, to try him. Despite the shadow of a Senate trial, 
a new CNN/"USA today" Gallup poll finds the president's approval rate 
rising.
