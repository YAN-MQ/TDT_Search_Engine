Iraq has been outlining damage inflicted during American and British 
air strikes. Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz accuses President 
Clinton and Prime Minister Blair of lying about the true impact of 
the bombings. He says there were many more civilian than military 
casualties. The whole total of casualties in the military, the Republican 
Guard, the special Republican Guard, all other branches of the Iraqi 
army, 62 martyrs, 180 wounded. The civilian casualties are much, much 
higher than the military casualties. Mr. Aziz also made it clear there's 
no possibility of UN weapons inspectors resuming their duties in Iraq.
