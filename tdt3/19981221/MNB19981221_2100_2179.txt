trying to say on Sunday. ? I ac tually just start on Monday. So I 
really don't kno well, you can't make software better... until you 
know wh people want to do with it. What do you want to do? What do 
you want to do Woman: what are kids really doing with technology, 
and why is it helpi them learn? We've noticed you tend to do some 
pretty amazing thing how can I make the comput easier for you to use 
E-mail's going to be Li the telephone. You pick it U you call somebody... 
things we never wou have imagined. What if your compu could recognize 
your face in fact, we do our best work trng to keep up with yo imagination. 
I design softwa for people like my da my mother, my neighbors. What 
gets you up the morning? What are you passionate about Woman: it has 
to be for kids, for all different typ of people to use it. What if 
your comput uld talk to you what if your comput turned on like a Lamp 
so our tagline. In part, it's an invitation to you. In part, it's 
a question because... we really need to know the answe so, we'll ask 
it agai Teddy gibbs can't let a sore throat stop him. Even when it 
feels this raw. He toughs it out through the hacking cough... the 
aches, the fever but when the job is done he's desperate... ...for 
fast, powerful theraflu relief. With the first sip of that soothing, 
lemony hot liquid he feels comfort instantly. Soon, his throat feels 
calmed his cough quieted. Maximum strength theraflu. Now in new cherry 
sore throat and cough. Instant comfort. Powerful relief.
