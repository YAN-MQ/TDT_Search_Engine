The events of this past weekend have been described in terms like 
tragedy, madness, and farce by the European press. As NBC news correspondent 
Charles Sabine reports from London, the U.S. is looking less like 
a global soup power to some. Should the president of the United States 
resign? Agree or disagree? Dorothy in ing Graham. Good evening. He 
should be kicked out. He's gone too far. The news of President Clinton's 
impeachment is certainly getting reactions overseas but ones which 
are not improving the image of the White House. I think the people 
here feel that the United States has taken leave of its senses. We 
cannot believe what's going on. The U.S. right now are looking not 
like a superpower but really a ship of fools. Good evening. From sex 
at the White House to a trial for his political life. How did the 
president arrive at the gravest moment of his political career? The 
European media have done their best to keep up with and unravel the 
complexities of monicagate but the result seems to be at least an 
image of a democracy that's lost its way. The Americans have got themselves 
in a dreadful mess. The French famous for tolerating the infidelities 
of their leaders see the impeachment and upcoming Senate trial as 
particularly bizarre. What French people cannot understand is that 
the American American president, supposedly the most powerful man 
on the earth is treated like dirt for what for the French is peccadillos. 
But should any of these opinions matter to America? Well, yes, according 
to many editorials around the world, which tell readers that now more 
than ever the president is not just the leader of the United States, 
but of the free world and his responsibilities extend beyond his own 
borders. Many blame the scandals in Washington undermining last week's 
air strikes over Iraq resulting in a lack of international support 
for the mission. The American president has been weak and, that he 
cannot be as efficient as he should be as the leader of the free world. 
It reduces the presidency to nothing at a time when the world situation 
has probably never been more dangerous. It's for that reason that 
in some corridors of power in Europe the suggestion is being privately 
made that perhaps resignation would be preferable to months of a show 
trial that could leave the free world rudderless in a dangerousea. 
Charles say Bean, NBC news, London.
