A South Korean warship fired several warning shots Monday near a Japanese 
boat fishing for tuna in international waters between the two countries, 
Japan's coast guard said. Several shots landed about 10 meters (330 
feet) from the 4.9-ton vessel piloted by 41-year-old Eiji Yamamoto, 
but the Japanese fisherman was unhurt, said Shinji Sezaki, a spokesman 
for Japan's coast guard. The incident occurred about 10 kilometers 
(6 miles) east of the site where South Korean navy ships sunk a North 
Korean speedboat in a gunbattle last Friday, Sezaki said. The warship 
initially ordered Yamamoto to move away using light, whistle and microphone 
signals, but the fisherman did not heed the warning, said another 
coast guard spokesman, Eiji Nagano. Yamamoto told Japanese authorities 
that he had not noticed the preliminary warnings, Nagano said. The 
subsequent life fire rounds might have been fired from a machine gun, 
he said. A South Korean military spokesman, who identified himself 
only as Lt. Col. Kim, said the warship had fired warning shots because 
the boat ignored warnings to leave the area. Yamamoto told Japanese 
officials that the shots were fired after the South Korean boat chased 
him away from a point about 90 kilometers (56 miles) southwest of 
Izuhara, Nagasaki Prefecture (state). In Friday's incident, South 
Korean navy ships and aircraft sank the North Korean vessel, described 
as a low-slung, speedboat used to drop off or pick up spies, after 
a six-hour chase. South Korean navy vessels are now searching for 
a suspected mother ship, which is believed to have taken the sunken 
speedboat boat toward the South Korean shore before Friday's incident. 
Kim declined to say if the navy initially believed the Japanese fishing 
boat to be the mother ship. Japan's coast guard warned Japanese fishing 
boats to be careful in their operations in the Korean Straight between 
Japan's southern main island of Kyushu and Korea.
