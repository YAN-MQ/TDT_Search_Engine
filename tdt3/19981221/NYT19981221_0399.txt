A handful of moderate Republicans who voted to impeach President Clinton 
appealed to the Senate on Monday to consider censuring the president 
instead of convicting him, as many lawmakers scrambled to find a way 
to avoid a lengthy, embarrassing Senate trial. Because most senators, 
used to deciding things in clubby caucuses, are away and the only 
precedents for a presidential trial are 130 years old, there was no 
evidence that a consensus existed, nor any clear idea if Senate rules 
would hamper or assist one if it emerged. The White House, through 
Vice President Al Gore, continued to demand that the Senate quickly 
``forge a fair bipartisan compromise.'' For his part, the president 
publicly ignored the issue and turned to the symbolic duties of his 
office in a holiday season. But the day's most striking development 
was the letter from Reps. Sherry Boehlert and Benjamin Gilman of New 
York, Mike Castle of Delaware and Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania, which 
they prepared to send to Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader. They 
released its text on Monday night, and plan to send it on Tuesday. 
``We are not convinced, and do not want our votes interpreted to mean, 
that we view removal from office as the only reasonable conclusion 
of this case,'' they wrote, although the articles of impeachment for 
which they voted each concluded: ``Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, 
by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial and removal from office.'' 
They argued in their letter that while it was ``questionable'' whether 
the House had authority to deal with censure, the Senate clearly ``does 
have the authority and the precedents to consider a range of options. 
Those options should include a tough censure proposal, which would 
impose a fine and block any pardon.'' The congressmen all voted Saturday 
against allowing the consideration of a Democratic move to allow a 
House vote on censure. Another House Republican who voted for impeachment, 
W. J. Tauzin of Louisiana, was consulting with colleagues on Monday 
about asking the Senate to avert a trial. His spokesman, Ken Johnson, 
said, ``The feeling is the president paid a terrible price for his 
actions. The Clinton presidency has been indelibly stained by impeachment.'' 
He said House Republicans could vote only up or down on impeachment. 
``That was a lousy choice, but the only one allowed under the Constitution,'' 
he said. ``Our hands were tied. Too much blood has been spilled already 
and there's a time to begin the healing process.'' But despite a rising 
clamor among past and present politicians for censure, the alternatives 
put forward so far face two formidable obstacles, at least today. 
Most such proposals, including the one offered on Monday by former 
Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, require that Clinton concede 
he lied under oath, a step his aides insist he will not take. With 
that in mind, or perhaps merely as a bargaining tactic, some WHite 
House aides say censure may be unworkable, ``It just may be there's 
no acceptable form of censure, so why go through that?'' said one 
Clinton adviser. A trial, he said, would provide the country with 
a ``definitive end to this thing.'' ``No one is going to fault us 
for mounting a defense,'' he said. ``And believe me, we're going to 
mount one. Believe me.'' Further, several senior Republican senators 
have said that they have a constitutional duty to at least begin a 
trial. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is likely to play a prominent 
role in any trial, said that he would like to see the Senate vote 
on the two articles of impeachment approved on Saturday before considering 
any alternatives. But he said he believed it could be done quickly. 
He said in an interview there was ``a lot of discussion about at what 
point is censure an appropriate discussion. My view is we need to 
commence the trial. Otherwise it just completely makes short shrift 
of the action of the House.'' Republicans have said that they expect 
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate's leading expert on rules 
and procedures, to support their contention that the Senate is obliged 
to open a trial. But on Monday, Byrd kept his options open. ``Whether 
there is a trial or whether there is some other solution, that decision 
must be made by senators,'' he said, ``and it must be bipartisan or 
it will have absolutely no credibility with the public.'' He made 
a similar argument for the primacy of the Senate. He warned that the 
White House should not expect to control the terms of a censure resolution. 
``For the good of our nation, there must be no 'deal' involving the 
White House or any entity beyond the current membership of the U.S. 
Senate,'' he said in a written statement that signaled that at least 
some Senate Democrats would maintain some distance from the president.
