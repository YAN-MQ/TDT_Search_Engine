The Clinton impeachment is big news in the United States. But what 
kind of impact is it having in other parts of the world? Steve harrigan 
looks at the reaction, in Moscow. The Russian government refused to 
comment on the president clinton impeachment saying it's an internal 
affair for the United States. But everyone's got an opinion. Even 
on the ice. Clinton? A good man, a real man, who does it right. Impeachment 
has had little effect on Mr. Clinton's popularity in russia, where 
many people say they're puzzled by what the fuss is about. We don't 
have any laws in this country, but over there, they've got all kinds 
of laws. You put your hand on the Bible and swear and that's it. Most 
immediately affected by the impeachment are the Clinton doll sellers. 
Who still don't have all the names right. Paula Jones. Jessica Flowers. 
Since impeachment, interest in the dolls has fallen. Americans are 
the main buyers. And they're getting sick of this scandal. So, have 
prices. When it all started with Monica, we sold dolls for $50. Now 
we're lucky to get $12. And what would happen to business if the president 
were removed from office? There will be a new president, and we'll 
draw someone new. Business is eternal. Steve harrigan, CNN Moscow.
