At the Supreme Court tonight there are arguments over one of the most 
basic aspects of police power. If a police officer pulls you over 
for a minor traffic violation, should that officer be allowed to search 
you and that car? Should they have that authority? Some think that 
power is too easy to abuse. Here's Pete Williams. Chances are, it's 
happened to you. Police do it millions of times a year, pulling drivers 
over for minor violations like speeding. Usually, it ends with a ticket, 
but what if it didn't stop there? In Iowa, thanks to a recent court 
decision, police can go much further, conducting full-blown searches 
of drivers and everything in their cars, even when they don't suspect 
a crime. Iowa police did just that in 1996, when they pulled over 
Patrick knowles for speeding. When they found marijuana in his car, 
he sued, claiming the search was unconstitutional. The state today 
defended traffic searches, saying they help protect police. In every 
case, there is a possibility of danger to officers. For example, some 
very dangerous criminals have been found as a result of traffic stops. 
But at the Supreme Court today, not a single justice seemed to buy 
the state's argument. Chief justice rehnquist asked, "what additional 
evidence of speeding would you expect to find in the car, once it's 
stopped?" And justice souter said, "if safety is the concern, officers 
invite more risk by demanding to search instead of just handing the 
driver a ticket." Civil liberties groups warn that if Iowa wins, other 
states are eagerly waiting to try the same kind of searches. Opponents 
argue it would give police far too much power. It's a humiliating 
public kind of embarrassment to be searched by the police. And we 
have to ask ourselves, "is that kind of humiliation warranted for 
someone who's just committed a traffic offense?" Courts have gradually 
given police more authority to conduct searches, especially in the 
Hunt for drugs. Based on their questions, the justices seem likely 
to rule that police need some reason to suspect a crime before they 
search, and speeding isn't enough. Pete Williams, NBC news, at the
