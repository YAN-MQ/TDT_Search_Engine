BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) _ FC Brugge denied VfB Stuttgart a second miracle 
in as many UEFA Cup rounds Tuesday, ending a nine-man comeback attempt 
with a goal from Alexandar Ilic for a 3-2 win that qualifies the Belgian 
champion for the third round. Brugge advanced on a 4-3 aggregate score 
following a 1-1 draw in Germany two weeks ago. Both sides were 1-1 
after regulation time on Tuesday, setting up a spectacular finish 
in extra time. After Stuttgart came close to the impossible by surging 
from behind twice when two men had already been sent off with reds 
cards, Brugge pounded the German defense till it finally broke in 
the 115th minute. Serb playmaker Ilic headed home a cross from Sven 
Vermant in the near corner for the late decider, finally knocking 
the last wind out of the incredible Germans. ``We should have finished 
this off a lot earlier but we didn't. So it turned into a real thriller,'' 
said FC Brugge coach Eric Gerets. Five minutes ahead of Ilic's goal, 
striker Fredi Bobic had put Stuttgart with one foot in the third round 
with a fierce left-foot shot for 2-2. Stuttgart had made its own comeback 
near impossible in the second half when, already trailing 1-0, Pablo 
Thiam t seemed the game was over, Brugge leading on an Olivier De 
Cock goal and facing just nine men. But Dutch captain Frank Verlaat 
gave the Germans hope again, equalizing with a glancing header in 
the 76th minute. Buoyed on by the 13,000 fans at the Jan Breydel Stadium, 
Brugge went looking for the decider but long failed to find a hole 
in the depleted German ranks. Chance seemed to be on Stuttgart's side 
too. Brugge's Nzelo Lembi and Khalilou Fadiga hit the bar and the 
post in a furious 95th minute. Brugge went ahead 2-1 in the 105th 
minute when Gert Claessens knocked in a rebound from Stuttgart goalie 
Marc Ziegler, who was unable to stop a shot from Fadiga. In a seesaw 
show of shifting fortunes, Bobic's goal proved to be insufficient 
and Ilic prevailed. ``This is truly amazing,'' said Brugge captain 
Franky Vander Elst after the match. And, at 37, he has already seen 
it all. Brugge, which had enough with a goalless draw to advance to 
the next round, never held back and boldly went for victory from the 
start.
