A prominent Swiss Jewish leader Tuesday called on Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu to explain why he is honoring two leading critics 
of Switzerland's World War II role shortly before he visits the country. 
At a ceremony planned in Jerusalem on Nov. 17, Netanyahu is to honor 
Edgar Bronfman, head of the World Jewish Congress, and U.S. Senator 
Alfonse D'Amato for their ``convictions and courage'' in pushing through 
a settlement by Swiss banks of Holocaust victims' claims. Sigi Feigel, 
honorary president of the Hebrew Congregation of Zurich, issued an 
open letter to Netanyahu after the Israeli ambassador in Bern called 
on the Swiss to welcome him when he arrives Nov. 25 for a Swiss-Israeli 
economic seminar. ``Non-Jewish friends asked me whether you (Netanyahu) 
put any value on the feelings of the Swiss population,'' Feigel said 
in his letter. ``Why this honor so close to your visit to Switzerland?'' 
Feigel asked, calling on Netanyahu to give an answer ``personally 
and directly to the Swiss people.'' Feigel has long been a critic 
of Jewish organizations who accused Switzerland of acting as banker 
to Nazi Germany. He accused Bronfman and D'Amato of making untrue 
allegations which ``deeply hurt the feelings of a large part of the 
Swiss population.'' Following international pressure, Swiss banks 
agreed in August to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors to 
compensate for World War II losses. New York City Comptroller Alan 
Hevesi, who threatened Swiss banks with sanctions, and U.S. Undersecretary 
of State Stuart Eizenstat, who oversaw the talks that led to the settlement, 
are also to be honored at the ceremony in Jerusalem. Feigel's letter 
follows another flap in September over a leaked letter Netanyahu wrote 
praising Bronfman for his ``great pride, dignity, skill and aplomb'' 
in the negotiations. Netanyahu moved to end the row with a conciliatory 
statement after a visit to Israel by Switzerland's armaments chief 
and the economic seminar were briefly put in doubt. The Swiss government 
remains angry with Bronfman for what it considers were unfair attacks 
and in particular for remarks earlier this year about ``total war'' 
on the Swiss. Switzerland has not protested the planned honors, Foreign 
Ministry spokeswoman Yasmine Chatila said.
