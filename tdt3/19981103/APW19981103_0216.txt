Palestinian security forces have in recent months foiled Iranian-backed 
attempts by Islamic militants to assassinate Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat and senior members of his government, a senior Arafat aide 
said Tuesday. Iran is training and funding a secret cell within the 
Islamic militant group Hamas to carry out the assassinations and suicide 
bombings in Israel, Tayyeb Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of the 
Palestinian Authority, told The Associated Press. ``We arrested several 
of these people who had plans detailing the assassinations,'' Abdel 
Rahim said. The most recent arrest came in October when Palestinian 
intelligence agents arrested a Hamas activist, Jamal Natche, in the 
West Bank town of Hebron. Natche was given orders by Iran to kill 
Arafat, Abdel Rahim said, but did not provide details. As a result 
of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security agreement, there have 
been mounting threats against Arafat, both by Hamas in the Palestinian 
areas and by radical Muslim leaders abroad. Iran's spiritual leader, 
Ali Khamenei, has called Arafat a traitor. The leader of the pro-Iranian 
Hezbollah group in Lebanon, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, said Arafat's 
hands should be chopped off for signing the agreement. The Hamas military 
wing, Izzedine al Qassam, warned Arafat of ``the wrath of vengeance'' 
for his crackdown on Hamas, imposed after last week's suicide attack 
by the group on an Israeli convoy. On Monday, the 69-year-old Arafat 
dismissed the threats with a wave of his hand. ``It is not the first 
time and it won't be the last. I don't care,'' said Arafat, who has 
survived several attempts on his life during his decades as Palestinian 
leader. Israeli media reports said the CIA has given Arafat's security 
chiefs, Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan. instructions on how to 
deal with the new situation. However, Abdel Rahim said security for 
Arafat has not been beefed up in response to the threats. Rajoub would 
only say that Palestinian security forces, especially Arafat's bodyguard 
detail, known as Force 17, is always alert. Several of Arafat's bodyguards 
have received training in the United States. With no designated successor, 
Arafat's sudden death would create chaos within Palestinian society. 
Such a situation would seriously threaten a already shaky peace process. 
Iran is an outspoken foe of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords 
and has close ties to Hamas which has carried out more than a suicide 
bombings in Israel, effectively disrupting the peace process at critical 
moments. Abdel Rahim said the Palestinian Authority was determined 
to stop Iran from meddling in Palestinian affairs. ``We won't allow 
Iran to create an Afghanistan in our areas,'' Abdel Rahim said, referring 
to the civil war-torn Asian nation. The Palestinian daily Al Quds 
which is close to the Palestinian Authority wrote in an editorial 
that it found Khamenei's attacks on Arafat ``very shocking.'' ``We 
wished the statements by Khamenei had not been made and we still hope 
that the government of Iran will appreciate efforts made by the Palestinians 
to maintain good relations with Iran,'' the newspaper said.
