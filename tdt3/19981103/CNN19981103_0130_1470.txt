He's no picasso. Then again, he's no human, either. In south Africa, 
paintings by Oliver the otter have been auctioned to benefit the Pretoria 
zoo. His technique is simple. Hop in the paint, then leap on the canvas. 
Walking, rolling around and shaking are all popular methods. Oliver's 
two works brought in more than $2,800.
