Anthony Williams started life as an abandoned infant in Los Angeles. 
On Tuesday, 47 years later, he was elected mayor of the nation's capital. 
In between, he led a peripatetic life that included waiting on tables 
at the Park Plaza Hotel in New Haven, Conn., to work his way through 
Yale University, four years in the Air Force, and both law and graduate 
public-policy degrees from Harvard University. Then there were bureaucratic 
and administrative jobs with the Department of Agriculture, the state 
of Connecticut, the Community Development Agency in St. Louis and 
the Redevelopment Authority in Boston, and an adjunct professorship 
at Columbia University. He is, in short, an outsider, and on Tuesday, 
Washington, a city peopled largely by outsiders, elected him to succeed 
Mayor Marion Barry, who did not seek re-election. Williams, the Democratic 
candidate, defeated the Republican nominee, Carol Schwartz. Asked 
in an interview during the campaign what he knew about his birth parents, 
Williams replied that all he knew was that he was born on July 28, 
1951, in Los Angeles. ``That's about it,'' he said. Williams went 
from the misfortune of being an abandoned baby to adoption into a 
large, warm family, that of Virginia and Louis Williams, who were 
both postal clerks. Mrs. Williams gave birth to six of her own children, 
and she and her husband adopted Anthony and also raised a godchild. 
``We didn't come from a rich family, but from a noble family,'' Williams 
said. ``We were enriched by our parents.'' Louis, who died earlier 
this year, and Virginia Williams insisted that their children study 
hard. One result was that all of them graduated from college. ``We 
have Ph.D.s, a doctor, a CPA and artists, from Stanford, MIT, Yale, 
UC-Santa Clara, Northwestern and UCLA,'' Williams said of his brothers 
and sisters. Virginia Williams, now retired, worked as a volunteer 
in her son's mayoral campaign. She said the other day that she was 
the first member of the family to run for public office, seeking a 
seat on the City Council in Los Angeles. ``I finished 16th in a field 
of 32,'' she said, smiling broadly at the inauspiciousness of her 
political career. Anthony Williams, who improved his family's election 
record on Tuesday to two out of three (he was elected to the Board 
of Aldermen in New Haven while an undergraduate), has lived in Washington 
for less than three years. ``Lots of people haven't lived long in 
D.C.,'' Williams said the other day between campaign stops, by way 
of explaining why his opponents' charge that he is a carpetbagger 
had no impact in the Democratic primary. Much of Washington is made 
up people who made their mark elsewhere before moving here, and in 
many of the middle class and more affluent neighborhoods it is an 
unusual event when two people meet and find they were both born here. 
Williams was able to win the Democratic primary by campaigning as 
a cost-cutter in an overspending city when he served as its chief 
financial officer. He won the primary easily, defeating three members 
of the City Council who were identified by the voters as part of the 
government establishment that brought Washington almost to bankruptcy. 
The Republican candidate, Ms. Schwartz, was born in Mississippi, raised 
in Texas and has lived in Washington for 33 years. A member of the 
City Council, she was the underdog from the start. She is a Republican 
in a city where the Democrats hold a 10-to-1 advantage in party enrollment. 
She is a white in a city that is about 60 percent black. She was outspent 
heavily. Williams said he expected to spend $1.5 million on the campaign, 
compared with Ms. Schwartz's $250,000. Williams is a black Democrat 
who ran in a black and Democratic city. His is not yet a household 
name. At a recent staff meeting of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, 
its managing partner for the Washington area, John Schweiters, tried 
to build up some enthusiasm for Williams' appearance by asking the 
employees: ``How many of you have heard of Robin Williams?'' Most 
hands shot up. ``Ted Williams?'' Fewer hands were raised. ``Tony Williams?'' 
Almost no hands. That will change, starting Tuesday.
