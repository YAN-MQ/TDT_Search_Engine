In the National Football League, Troy Aikman of the Dallas Cowboys 
returned to the starting lineup Monday and threw two touchdown passes 
leading the visiting Cowboys over the overmatched Philadelphia Eagles 
34 to nothing. Aikman completed 14 of 26 passes for 171 yards in his 
first game since mid-September when he suffered a fractured collar 
bone during a lost to Denver. The Dallas quarterback says the Cowboys 
have something to prove. We wanted to come out and play well and dominate 
the football game, and we feel that we were able to do that. Now what 
we've got to do is we've got to go out and do that this week. Dion 
Sanders had a 69-yard punt return for a touchdown. Emmett Smith ran 
for 101 yards, and receiver Michael Ervin caught a ten-yard touchdown 
pass to help Dallas remain at the top of the NFC East Division. Eagles 
coach Ray Rode says it's time for his team to do some soul searching. 
It's come to the point too where guys got to be here to play football. 
They got to play, too. You know, that's the bottom line. They've got 
to play. And I don't think anybody's really satisfied with their performance. 
So, you know, they're going to get up and try to get the performance 
right. With a 38 to nothing loss to open the season, the hapless Eagles 
became the first home team in NFL history to be blanked by 30 or more 
points twice in the same season.
