Shuttle diplomacy in Kosovo entered another round on Tuesday with 
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill traveling to the provincial capital of 
Pristina to talk with representatives of the ethnic Albanian majority. 
Hill held separate talks with Serbian President Milan Milutinovic 
and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch on Monday after arriving 
from the Macedonian capital, Skopje. Hill, the U.S. ambassador to 
Macedonia, has led international efforts to find a political solution 
for the secessionist Serbian province. Hundreds of people have been 
killed and an estimated 300,000 more have been forced from their homes 
since February, when Serb authorities launched a crackdown on ethnic 
Albanian militants in the southern Serbian province where ethnic Albanians 
outnumber Serbs 9 to 1. Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. 
Also Tuesday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft was meeting 
in Belgrade with Yugoslav government officials and representatives 
of media organizations that were banned under a harsh new media law.
