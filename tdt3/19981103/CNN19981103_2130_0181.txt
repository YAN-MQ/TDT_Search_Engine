Many Americans never made it to the polling stations. Some out of 
apathy, others out of protest. Susan Candiotti has more on voter motivation, 
or the lack there of. In New York City, where democrats widely outnumber 
republicans, a Steady stream of voters were keeping poll workers busy. 
The balloting put an end to weeks of one of the most expensive, at 
about $35 million, and downright mean campaigns in the country. People 
can be nasty. Each candidate blames the other for the constant mudslinging. 
The race pits incumbent republican senator Alfonse D'Amato -- It's 
great to wind up the campaign at home. -- against democratic challenger 
congressman Charles Schumer. Please don't forget to vote. Here and 
elsewhere across the U.S., voters view Negative campaigns the same 
way -- with disgust and resignation. There will be a greater turnout 
when races turn positive. Voter turnout also important in other high-profile 
races. In Florida, Jeb bush, the former president's son, is trying 
to become the second bush to hold a governor's post at the same time. 
In Illinois, voters are deciding whether democratic senator Carol 
moseley-Braun will win her battle for a second term. What to tell 
your kids, I didn't know what to say. Both parties are anxious to 
see whether last-minute GOP ads, which make thinly vealed references 
to the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, will impact voters. This mother said 
she ignored them. I just tried to pay attention to each of the candidates 
and what they stand for, and not the Negative campaigning about President 
Clinton. An election is a war, and I think they use any means at their 
disposal to fight the war. And if you thought this off-election year 
was less than stimulating, remember impeachment hearings are just 
around the corner. Susan Candiotti, CNN, New York.
