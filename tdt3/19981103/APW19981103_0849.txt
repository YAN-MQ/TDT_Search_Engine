Yugoslavia's European Championship qualifying game against Ireland, 
called off last month due to the crisis in Kosovo, will be played 
in Belgrade on Nov. 18, the Irish soccer association said Tuesday. 
The Group 8 match was orginally scheduled to take place in Belgrade 
on Oct. 10 but was postponed by UEFA because of the threat of NATO 
air strikes against Yugoslavia. ``It is a great relief that we now 
know where we are going,'' said Football Association of Ireland chief 
executive Bernard O'Byrne. ``I am happy that the final decision has 
been made by UEFA because we can now go ahead with our travel plans.'' 
Ireland team manager Mick McCarthy said he always believed the match 
would be staged in Belgrade. In Nyon, Switzerland, a UEFA spokesman 
said he could not confirm that a final decision had been taken about 
the venue.
