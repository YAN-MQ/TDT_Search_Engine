I'm Bill Hazzerd, VOA News. President Clinton's Democratic Party has 
scored a surprising if not potentially historic victory in the off-year 
U.S. elections. VOA's David Swan reports the Democrats at almost every 
level turned back what was expected to be a Republican tide. The party 
holding the White House almost always loses congressional seats in 
these elections. Instead, Democrats have held their own in the Senate 
and are apparently on pace to gain a few seats in the House of Representatives. 
The results confounded Republicans who hoped to exploit the president's 
affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky. Senate Democratic leader 
Tom Daschle says this takes the steam out of the drive for congressional 
impeachment of the pr. Obviously, no one really know yet. This is 
going to be a decision that House members are going to have to make, 
but they can't feel very good about prolonging this, given the results 
tonight. Many Americans say the White House scandal was not a factor 
in their votes. Democrats also picked up a few governor seats, including 
the one in California, which was among the biggest prizes in Tuesday's 
balloting. David Swan, VOA News, Washington.
