Parliament headed toward a government confidence vote Tuesday following 
days of debate that exposed deep rifts in the governing Socialist 
party. But Premier Costas Simitis appeared almost certain to survive 
the vote in the 300-seat chamber, where his party has a comfortable 
majority. Socialists are expected give near-unanimous backing to Simitis 
although some party dissenters harshly criticized the government's 
strict belt-tightening measures _ aimed at earning Greece a place 
in the European Union's single currency group. Simitis, who is midway 
through his four-year term, called the confidence vote after the Socialists 
lost ground to the more conservative New Democracy opposition in municipal 
elections last month. He intended the vote to represent a stamp of 
approval for the government's policies. But it also was a possible 
dress rehearsal for an important party congress in March, when Socialist 
hard-liners are expected to intensify their challenges to Simitis. 
The dissenting bloc _ joined by Defense Minister Akis Tzochatzopoulos 
_ accuse Simitis of breaking with the Socialists' populist roots to 
concentrate on economic reforms in the EU's poorest nation. Tzochatzopoulos 
predicted eroding support for the Socialist party unless it ``sides 
with the people once again.'' The Socialists have led Greece for 14 
of the past 17 years. But Simitis insists that Greece risks becoming 
a second-tier economy unless it can meet EU fiscal goals. Among Greece's 
challenges is lowering inflation and trimming the state debt. But 
some labor unions and leftist groups have fought back with strikes 
and protests. Some recent firebombings have hit financial targets 
such as tax offices. ``Our government is determined to press ahead,'' 
Simitis told lawmakers when debate on the confidence vote opened Sunday. 
Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU that failed to qualify 
for the first round of monetary union. Britain, Denmark and Sweden 
opted out of joining.
