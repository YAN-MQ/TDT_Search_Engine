Today is Tuesday, November 3rd, 1998. Fifty years ago today, the morning 
edition of the November 3rd, 1948 "Chicago Tribune" newspaper had 
a bold headline that read: "Dewey Defeats Truman." This referred to 
the expected victory in the previous day's presidential election of 
New York Governor Thomas Dewey, the Republican candidate over the 
incumbent, Democrat Harry Truman. However, the headline was wrong. 
Later, a picture of a laughing President Truman holding the "Tribune" 
with its incorrect headline, became famous. The editors of the Chicago 
newspaper who had put together the November 3rd edition the night 
before wrote the headline based on premature election returns that 
gave Governor Dewey the victory. They also accepted the nearly unanimous 
forecasts of public opinion surveys that had said Governor Dewey would 
win the election. President Truman himself was one of the few political 
forecast of either party who believed he would win. President Truman's 
1948 election victory is considered one of the major political upsets 
in American history.
