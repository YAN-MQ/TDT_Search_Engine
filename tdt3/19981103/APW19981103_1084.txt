MONACO (AP) - Boosted by a pair of early goals, Monaco beat Austria's 
Graz AK 4-0 on Wednesday and easily qualify for the last 16 of the 
UEFA Cup with a 7-3 aggregate win. Monaco, last year's Champions League 
semifinalists, never looked in trouble against the Austrians after 
opening the scoring as early as the eighth minute. The away defense 
cleared a corner, but the ball fell to Frank Gava, who fired in a 
stunning left-footed volley from 25 meters (yards). Within ten minutes 
Robert Spehar, one of the scorers in the first leg, made it 2-0. Nigerian 
striker Victor Ikpeba dashed down the left wing, and crossed to the 
unmarked Croatian, who calmly headed in from 10 yards (meters). Monaco, 
who conceded a late equalizer in the first leg 3-3 draw two weeks 
ago, moved up another gear, and penned in the Graz AK defense for 
most of the first half. Djibril Diawara put the game beyond doubt 
with a fine individual effort early in the second half. The 23-year-old 
Senegalese utility player danced through the Graz AK defense before 
rounding the goalkeeper and tapping the ball into the net. Then Gava 
latched on to a long through ball to score his second of the match 
and make it 4-0.
