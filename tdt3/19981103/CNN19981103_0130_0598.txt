When it comes to health problems, gender matters. A women's health 
advocacy group has released a list of ten diseases that experts say 
affect women differently than men. Sexually transmitted diseases top 
the list, followed by depression, osteoporosis, lung cancer and heart 
disease. Women are more likely to have an autoimmune disorder. And 
the female body reacts differently to anesthesia, drugs, alcohol and 
pain. The society for the advancement of women's health research says 
medical studies need to focus more on these gender differences.
