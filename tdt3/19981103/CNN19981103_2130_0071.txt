Not every Senate race was a nail-biter. In Arizona, incumbent republican 
John McCain will spend another six years in Washington, after beating 
democrat Ed ranger. It will be McCain's third term. On to Colorado 
where democrat-turned-republican Ben nighthorse Campbell defeated 
former state first lady dottie Lamm. In South Dakota, Senate minority 
leader Tom Daschle has beaten republican ron Schmidt for a third term. 
And in North Dakota, democratic incumbent Byron Dorgan easily retains 
his seat.
