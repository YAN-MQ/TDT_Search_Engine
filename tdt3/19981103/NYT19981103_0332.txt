Anyone who watches ``Velvet Goldmine,'' Todd Haynes' extravagant, 
silver-spangled, $7 million valentine to glam rock, is bound to wonder 
if the filmmaker was himself once a glitter-crazed teen-age rebel 
who hennaed his hair, experimented with cross-dressing and pranced 
around in six-inch platform shoes. The answer is no. ``Velvet Goldmine,'' 
which is set mostly in London in the early 1970s, follows the rise, 
fall and mysterious disappearance of Brian Slade, a David Bowie-like 
superstar whose stage alter-ego, Maxwell Demon, bears striking similarities 
to Bowie's most notorious invention, that flame-haired, extraterrestrial 
androgyne Ziggy Stardust. The movie also observes Brian's stormy, 
sexually charged relationships with two Americans: his flamboyantly 
theatrical wife Mandy (Toni Collette), who resembles Bowie's former 
wife Angela, and Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), a surly exhibitionistic 
rocker who suggests Iggy Pop crossed with Jim Morrison. But for all 
the characters' resemblances to real people, ``Velvet Goldmine,'' 
which opened Friday, doesn't pretend to be a cinematic roman a clef 
about the glam rock era. What Haynes has constructed is a surreal 
pop fantasia that includes 23 songs, some of them done as lavish production 
numbers whose opulence rivals the glitziest fantasies of Busby Berkeley. 
At these moments, ``Velvet Goldmine'' looks and feels almost like 
science fiction. ``There were so many movies that affected me,'' Haynes 
says in an interview, ``but the ones that influenced this film the 
most came out of the drug culture _ movies like ``2001,'' ``A Clockwork 
Orange'' and ``Performance.'' ``Velvet Goldmine'' also tips its hat 
to ``Citizen Kane.'' Brian's story is reconstructed through the eyes 
of Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), a reporter who was once one of 
the star's most ardent fans. A decade has passed since Brian, at the 
height of his stardom, sabotaged his career by faking his own onstage 
assassination. Assigned to write a whatever-happened-to story about 
Brian (it is now 1984), Arthur embarks on a search that is as much 
an investigation into his own troubled youth as it is a ``Citizen 
Kane''-like quest for the ``Rosebud'' in Brian's past. Although it 
would be easy to assume that the reporter is a stand-in for Haynes, 
they share few, if any, similarities. Where Arthur comes from a brutal 
English working-class background, Haynes, 37, grew up in comfortable 
circumstances in the Los Angeles suburb of Encino. Haynes was too 
young in 1972 (the year Bowie brought his Ziggy Stardust tour to the 
United States) to appreciate glam rock at its height. ``I was only 
11,'' the lean, wholesome-looking filmmaker recalls over a plate of 
calamari at the Bowery Bar in New York. ``But I remember when suddenly 
there were these girls wearing lipstick and bright colored clothes 
and painting their nails. They had a tough, cool, blase attitude and 
talked about Ziggy and Iggy and bisexual this and bisexual that. It 
was so antithetical to the '60s ideology and style that at the time 
I found it a little off-putting.'' It was as an undergraduate at Brown 
University, where he majored in art and semiotics in the early 1980s, 
that Haynes became fascinated with glam rock, the campy, dandified 
English style popularized not only by Bowie but by Marc Bolan, Roxy 
Music and Gary Glitter and adopted by American rockers like Lou Reed 
and Iggy Pop, both of whom were briefly Bowie proteges. Two 1970s 
pop albums that were much admired in the artistic circles in which 
Haynes traveled while at college were ``Here Come the Warm Jets'' 
and ``Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy,'' by the rock experimentalist 
Brian Eno, who had played synthesizer in Roxy Music. Eno had also 
produced three albums for Bowie in the late 1970s. Working his way 
back through these albums, Haynes developed a new appreciation for 
the glam music culture that had put him off a decade earlier. ``The 
more I researched, the more I discovered a clear intellectual lineage 
that went back to Oscar Wilde,'' he says. ``What glam rock kept demonstrating 
was the same basic position against nature, played out in a popular 
context. I kept seeing recurrences in the ideas distinguishing the 
glam artists from the '60s rock stars who preceded them, and the ideas 
distinguishing Wilde from the romantics who had come before him. In 
both cases there was a playing with sexual orientation, an emphasis 
on the pose, and the notion of self-consciously constructing yourself 
as a star.'' Superficially, ``Velvet Goldmine'' could not be more 
different in tone from Haynes' last film, ``Safe,'' a cool, visually 
elegant portrait of a Southern California woman (played by Julianne 
Moore) who develops an environmental disease and flees to a sinister, 
pollution-free new-age commune in New Mexico. ``Safe,'' in turn, seemed 
a radical departure from ``Poison,'' the notorious 1991 film that 
won him the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance and infuriated right-wing 
critics of the National Endowment for the Arts, which had provided 
$25,000 of the movie's $250,000 budget. ``Poison'' folded together 
three stories, including a horror film parody and a prison drama adapted 
from Jean Genet, into an elliptical parable about paranoia and social 
stigmatization in the age of AIDS. That film, an art-house hit that 
earned $1 million, was a huge stylistic leap from Haynes' first film, 
``Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story.'' In that 43-minute bio pic 
of the singer who died of anorexia, the characters are played by Barbie 
dolls. Because of its unauthorized use of the Carpenters' music, ``Superstar'' 
has not been allowed to be shown since 1990. As different as they 
are from one another, however, all four of Haynes' feature films share 
an attitude that Haynes describes as ``oppositional.'' ``I'm a political 
filmmaker, and the politics of identity is where I see the core of 
my focus,'' he explains. ``We live in a society that insists on prescribing 
our identities. I think the glam era posed some of the strongest dangers 
to that by encouraging a refusal of any fixed category for sexual 
orientation or identity in general. Glam rock was invested in blurring 
the difference between masculinity and femininity, heterosexuality 
and homosexuality, and that's tough on society. All those lines were 
rigorously reinstated in the '80s.'' For someone this dedicated to 
challenging the status quo, Haynes seems devoid of the hostility often 
associated with artistic rebels. The oldest of three children born 
to parents he describes as ``doggedly liberal and incredibly loving 
and supportive,'' he is mild-mannered and boyishly enthusiastic. His 
father, a sales representative for a cosmetics company, recently helped 
Haynes' younger brother Shawn set up his own line, ``The Velvet Goldmine 
Collection.'' ``Although I had a wonderful childhood, I still remember 
being angst-ridden all my life,'' he says. ``I had friends and was 
popular, but I identified with people who were unhappy and often befriended 
the person who was the outcast. I felt terrorized by the notions of 
what a man is supposed to be in the world.'' The realization that 
he was gay, he says, drove him to explore sexual politics. His study 
of feminism provided him with a theoretical perspective that has exerted 
a profound influence on work. Haynes was only 9 when he made his first 
film, ``Romeo and Juliet,'' (inspired by the Franco Zeffirelli film), 
in which he played all the parts, using double exposure. During his 
high school years, while a student at The Oakwood School, an arts-oriented 
private school in North Hollywood, he spent two years producing a 
23-minute short called ``The Suicide,'' about a sensitive boy struggling 
through high school. His main film project while at Brown was a 43-minute 
Godardian study of Rimbaud and Verlaine. Each of his commercially 
released films, Haynes says, involved a different experiment. ``In 
`Superstar,' I wanted to tell a story with dolls and in the process 
make you forget you were watching dolls,'' he says. `` `Poison' was 
an experiment in reading, in asking an audience to actively engage 
with different ways of telling almost the same story. `Safe' was an 
experiment in restraint and in not giving an audience every answer 
as to how to read a character. It follows the exact line that a disease-of-the-week 
movie would follow. But when the character finds a therapeutic or 
spiritual answer, that answer is wrong. `Velvet Goldmine's' experiment 
is in its excess and stylization and its attempt to keep an emotional 
engagement.'' One of Haynes' most ardent champions is his producer, 
Christine Vachon, whose company, Killer Films, was the co-producer 
of the current art-house hit ``Happiness'' by the other hot young 
filmmaker named Todd (Solondz). ``Todd has a special understanding 
of film language, of how everything works together from the tiniest 
prop to the sound effects,'' Ms. Vachon says of Haynes. ``Each film 
comes fully formed in his mind, and then he painstakingly has to fill 
it out. I don't know any other director who does that to that degree.'' 
``Velvet Goldmine'' had a difficult birth. As it was about to go into 
production, the French company that had underwritten the original 
$8 million budget pulled out of the project. The producers then had 
to scramble to get another deal (for only $7 million), which meant 
that the shooting schedule had to be cut by several days. When Bowie 
refused to let the filmmakers use his songs, Haynes had to assemble 
a score that mixed cover versions of non-Bowie glam rock songs from 
the 1970s (including several early Roxy Music numbers) with made-to-order 
period pastiches. One of his models was the fictional 1993 movie about 
the Beatles, ``Backbeat,'' in which young postpunk bands re-recorded 
and revitalized the group's early music. If ``Velvet Goldmine'' at 
moments resurrects the glamour of old-time Hollywood musicals, in 
other ways the movie is pointedly anti-Hollywood. It isn't a boy meets 
girl (or boy) and lives happily-ever-after story. And unlike the typical 
rock-and-roll movie, in which the music liberates the characters and 
makes the world a groovier place, the glam rock movement is remembered 
as a phenomenon that, no matter how liberating it might have seemed 
at the time, didn't go anywhere. Haynes abhors the way contemporary 
Hollywood films ``only confirm social ideas of identity and reward 
them at the end.'' ``Film is an incredibly powerful medium that both 
reflects and instructs,'' he says. ``That's why its job shouldn't 
be to tell you the truth or show you the cool way to be. As Fassbinder 
said, you can't give people the revolution. All you can do is show 
them the problems.''
