Hi, I'm expecting a fax. Room 212 wants the ammunition to deal with 
her toughest clients. Nothing? Davies, 212. I called earlier. Right, 
fax. It hasn't come yet. I need it for a meeting. Excuse me, miss 
Davies? It just came in. Thank you, so much. Good morning, everyone. 
Business services by Marriott. MCI five cent sundays. Five... Daffy: 
cut! I need passion. Depth. I need intensity. MCI five cent sundays. 
Five cents a minute. Every... cut! Sunday. Think big. Think Shakespeare! 
"Five cents a minute! every Sunday!" Five thenth a minute. Every thunday. 
I ask for an actor. They send a comedian. Call 1-800-sundays to become 
an MCI customer. Again. Call 1-800... Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline 
Sports."
