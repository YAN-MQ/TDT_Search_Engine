The United States is taking steps to beef up security at its embassies 
and diplomatic facilities around the world. The state department announced 
today that President Clinton has signed a Measure that will, among 
other things, cover costs incurred by the August bombings of the U.S. 
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, upgrade physical security at U.S. 
embassies around the world and provide additional funding for anti-terrorism 
programs.
