The known death toll is still rising in Nicaragua and Honduras. Thousands 
have died in the mudslides and floods triggered by Hurricane Mitch. 
Hundreds of thousands have lost their homes. We have a report from 
VOA's Bill Rodgers in the Nicaraguan capital. Nicaraguan authorities 
say as many as 1500 people may have been killed by floods and mudslides 
in recent days in the northwestern part of the country. The worst 
single disaster occurred Friday when a wall of mud and rocks rolled 
down the flank of the Casitas volcano destroying five communities 
in the area. Rescue workers are still searching for survivors but 
some 2,000 people are still missing. Authorities fear an outbreak 
of cholera and other diseases from the rotting corpses that remain 
scattered in the debris. The region around the volcano, some 115 kilometers 
north of the Nicaraguan capital, remains isolated and accessible only 
by helicopter. The head of Nicaragua's civil defense, Colonel Jose 
Garcia, says flood and other emergency supplies are being ferried 
in by helicopter to communities stranded by the flooding. Colonel 
Garcia told a local television station late Monday the hardest hit 
regions of the country in the departments of Chinanbega and Matagalpa. 
In Honduras, officials there say the death toll may be in the thousands 
from the floods and landslides caused by Hurricane Mitch's torrential 
rains. Reports say Honduras' Atlantic coast is flooded, and hundreds 
if not thousands of people are stranded on the roof tops of their 
homes or sitting in trees waiting for the flood waters to subside. 
Honduran President Carlos Flores Facuse Monday made an urgent appeal 
for international aid. The hurricane, one of the strongest in decades, 
has since been downgraded to a tropical depression. Officials estimate 
the storm's destruction has left hundreds of thousands of people homeless 
in Central America. Bill Rodgers, VOA News, Managua.
