Government attorneys played portions of the Microsoft chairman's videotaped 
deposition at his company's antitrust trial Monday. The tapes, which 
were recorded last summer, also were released to the public Monday. 
In the deposition, government lawyers ask Bill Gates about a disputed 
meeting two years ago between Microsoft and rival Netscape in which 
microsoft allegedly offered to divide the Internet browser market. 
Are you aware of any instances in which representatives of Microsoft 
have met with competitors in an attempt to allocate the market? Objection. 
I'm not aware of any such thing. And I know that it's very much against 
the way we operate. It would be against company policy to do that? 
That's right. A Microsoft spokesman says the tapes were played to 
distract attention from what he calls "the weakness of the government's 
case."
