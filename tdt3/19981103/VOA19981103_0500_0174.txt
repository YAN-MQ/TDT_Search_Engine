An Iraqi defector says President Saddam Hussein keeps a secret arsenal 
of chemical and biological weapons hidden even from his senior ministers. 
The "London Guardian" newspapers quotes Abus Aljanabe, the former 
private secretary to Mr. Saddam's son, Uday. According to the newspaper, 
Mr. Aljanabe said that Uday Hussein, his brother, and two other men 
supervise a special 600-member force whose job is to conceal the weapons 
from U.N. arms inspectors. The defector is quoted as saying that even 
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz does not know where the banned 
weapons are kept.
