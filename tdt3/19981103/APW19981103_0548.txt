BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The Council of Europe inaugurated a streamlined 
European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, Tuesday which 
it hopes will deal faster with a rapidly increasing number of citizens' 
complaints. ``Nearly 800 million Europeans will have access to this 
court,'' Daniel Tarschys, the secretary-general of the Council of 
Europe, told the inauguration ceremony. ``With 40 judges and a jurisdiction 
spanning from Nuuk in Greenland to Petropavlovsk, in Kamchatka (in 
the Russian far east) ... this will be the largest permanent court 
in the world,'' Tarschys said. The new court will work full-time, 
unlike the old one which operated just one week every month and handled 
about 100 cases a year, said council spokeswoman Kathy Burton. ``We're 
hoping the new system will speed up the procedure quite dramatically,'' 
Burton said. Under the old court system set up in 1950, rulings often 
took years. Already this year, 4,791 cases have been registered, the 
Council of Europe said in a statement. Under the new system, a human 
rights commission which examined cases before they went to court will 
be scrapped so cases come before judges sooner. The court rules on 
infringements of the 1950 European Human Rights Convention which is 
signed by all 40 nations in the Council of Europe. Citizens from those 
nations can bring cases to the European court after they have exhausted 
legal options in their home countries.
