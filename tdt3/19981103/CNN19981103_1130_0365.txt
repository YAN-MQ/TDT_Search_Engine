Some people in south-central Oklahoma say they've never seen flooding 
like this. More than 150 people were evacuated from the town of Blackwell. 
No one was hurt, but estimates of property damages are expected to 
increase once a nearby river recedes from a record crest of more than 
34 feet. Slow-moving storms dumped inches of rain on northern Oklahoma 
and southern kansas and some people blame the flooding on lack of 
flood-control systems. Four counties in south-central Kansas have 
been declared disaster areas.
