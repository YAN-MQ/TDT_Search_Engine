This week we've been taking "A closer look" at service and the ramifications 
of bad service. We've been asking basically is service dead? We all 
know what it's like to be an unhappy consumer. Bad service can be 
a drag on the whole economy. You've heard word of mouth. Some market 
research shows the average disgruntled customer tells ten people about 
their experience. That's a lot of bad advertising. Here's ABC's Erin 
Hayes. Delta airlines was once ledge endary for its customer service. 
We all love the things we do. And we'll do them all to please you. 
Such a happy place that in 1982, the employees actually bought the 
company an airplane. But that didn't last. Economic conditions Delta 
began losing money. Worried more about happy stockholders than happy 
employees, Delta cut 11,000 jobs cut baggage handlers, ticket agents, 
profits went way up, but employees were miserable. There were mistakes 
made, and lack of enthusiasm, lower wages, that people just didn't, 
well, if there was a ball game that day, people didn't come to work. 
And Delta's legendary customer service went down the tubes. Last year, 
1997, Delta ranked tenth out of ten of the major airlines. The new 
president is determined to turn things around. Without happy customers, 
he says Delta has no future. We're out there in the most competitive 
industry that I've ever seen, fighting it out every day, and the only 
way that you win is you have better customer service than the other 
fellow. Hard lesson learned? It's a hard lesson learned that if you 
abandon it, it can be costly to get it back. Al dunlap learned that 
the hard way, laid off thousands of the sun beam workers. Wall Street 
loved him. He wrote a book, "mean business" and they nicknamed him 
chain saw Al. This summer, sun beam realized sales were sliding. Al 
dunlap got the boot. Any company that thinks it's going to be really 
on the road to prosperity by cutting costs when it affects the customers 
are absolutely wrong and on the road to disaster. In fact, recent 
research indicate bottom lines are boosted by good customer service. 
It shows when customers are happy, stock prices tend to rise unhappy, 
they fall. Every dollar invested in customer service tends to give 
$2 to $5 back in incremental profit back to the company. Delta is 
now reinvesting and it's scores for customer satisfaction are climbing. 
Delta employees have a new project, the company's original dc-3. They're 
restoring it. A sign, they hope, that the old spirit of Delta is on 
its way back. Erin Hayes, ABC News, Atlanta.
