Palestinian leader Yasser arrived in Madrid Tuesday night to hold 
talks with Spanish leaders on the new land-for-security agreement 
he signed with Israel, the state news agency Efe reported. Arafat 
is to meet Wednesday with King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jose 
Maria Aznar and have dinner with Foreign Minister Abel Matutes. The 
Palestinian leader is in Spain at the invitation of Matutes, who was 
present when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
signed the peace agreement October 23 in Maryland. The accord calls 
on Israel to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank 
in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Moslem extremists who oppose 
peace with Israel. But problems have already emerged. Israel said 
Tuesday it will not carry out the agreement until it gets assurances 
that the Palestinian Authority headed by Arafat will arrest 30 Palestinian 
fugitives.
