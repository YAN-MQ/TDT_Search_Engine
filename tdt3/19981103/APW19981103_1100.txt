Hard-liners in Russia's parliament were demanding details of Boris 
Yeltsin's health, while the recuperating president held private talks 
Tuesday with his defense minister in southern Russia. The lower house 
of Russia's parliament, the State Duma, will consider a bill Thursday 
that would require Yeltsin to undergo a medical checkup. If the bill 
is approved, presidential doctors would have to release their conclusions 
following an exam. The bill requires the checkup be carried out by 
the medical department of Yeltsin's office, not an independent team. 
To become law, the bill would have to be approved by the upper house 
and Yeltsin himself, who is almost certain to veto it. The president's 
envoy to parliament, Alexander Kotenkov, said the bill had little 
chance of success. ``Apart from being tactless, the document is illegal,'' 
he said on Tuesday. Kotenkov and other critics of the bill said a 
specific reference to Yeltsin effectively turns it into an administrative 
directive to the presidential doctors _ something that the Duma has 
no right to pass. Communist Partly leader Gennady Zyuganov insisted 
the law should be approved. ``He (Yeltsin) is an absolutely irresponsible 
person and is incapable of running the country,'' he said. ``We are 
governed by an unsober person. In effect, the president has become 
a full-blown alcoholic.'' Communists and other Yeltsin foes have long 
accused the president of drinking heavily, a charge the president 
has denied. Zyuganov has been increasingly blunt in recent days. ``Alcoholism 
isn't an insult, it's a disease that is very difficult to cure,'' 
Zyuganov said Tuesday. Yeltsin, resting at the Black Sea resort of 
Sochi, is recovering from what his aides call fatigue and high blood 
pressure. The latest illness has again brought a new round of calls 
for the president's resignation by his Communist foes. Yeltsin insists 
he has no serious illness and says he will serve out his term that 
runs until the middle of the year 2000. Presidential aide Oleg Sysuyev 
said Tuesday that Yeltsin would ``fully perform'' his Kremlin and 
constitutional duties. Yeltsin also planned to resume long-delayed 
meetings with governors and presidential envoys to Russian regions, 
Sysuyev said during a visit to Strasbourg, France, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency reported. Yeltsin met with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on 
Tuesday to discuss military reform and building housing for retired 
officers. Russian television showed brief footage of a smiling Yeltsin 
welcoming Sergeyev to his residence and then sitting across from him 
behind a small table. Yeltsin, dressed in a dark cardigan and white 
shirt, looked tired but displayed no visible signs of illness. The 
president began a two-week stay in Sochi on Friday. He had been working 
only sporadically in recent weeks because of his poor health.
