Finally tonight, it's "the news without Brian Williams," and somebody 
is stealing the great wills of baseball. Not mahry wills, the stolen 
base kings, last wills, the documents of the dearly beloved. They 
all are baseball hall of famers who played for the Boston red stockings 
and Bean -- beaneaters ever the 1880 and 1890's. Last week the Register 
of probate in Suffolk county, Massachusetts report the that the wills 
of Tommy McCarthy, Hugh Duffy, and George Wright were missing along 
with that of a fourth unideaed baseball figure and that the one belonging 
to McCarthy was put up for sale. This is creepy enough, even if you 
don't know that when they played for boston, outfielders McCarthy 
and Duffy were known als the heavenly stwinls. Bloomington, Illinois 
officials rorpt that they checked on the thestament of Boston's iron-man 
pitcher Charlie "old Hoss" radborn and it's missing. May have been 
missing since 1988, the last time anybody checked. Radborn not only 
holds the unbreakable record of 59 or 60 wins in one sfeen, he was 
Providence's only pitcher, but more importantly, his cantankerous 
nature explained the theft rate. He didn't like to sane autographs 
or poles for photos. Here's the opening day photo shot. Yes, inside 
the circle, he's making a finger jest chur to the photographer. 19th 
century baseball hall of fame autographs are rare. Let's hope that's 
the rash of theverts owing to sheer greed rather than something more 
ghoulish. There's a church yard in Baltimore in which no fewer than 
five 19th century hall of famers are actually buried.
