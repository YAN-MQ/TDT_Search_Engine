His talk show is off the air, and his life is in free fall after entering 
that show business dark zone known as ``between jobs,'' but Larry 
Sanders is still every inch the slightly off-kilter celebrity his 
fans came to know so intimately in ``The Larry Sanders Show'' on HBO. 
But he remains a man who hides nothing embarrassing, as we discover 
in his soon-to-be-released book, ``The Autobiography of Larry Sanders: 
Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), 
which tells all and then some. Lunch with Sanders is a journey into 
a sort of entertainment nether world. Things got off to an awkward 
start with his suggestion that we meet at Le Dome, the hottest show 
business restaurant about 15 years ago but the only place he said 
he was guaranteed a good table. He arrived 20 minutes late and instantly 
excused himself to make the obligatory visit to a neighboring table 
for some much-needed recognition. ``I have to say hello to my old 
friend Peter Asher, you know, the famous record producer, used to 
be with Peter and Gordon,'' Sanders said. ``He's a great guy.'' ``Hey, 
Garry,'' said Asher. Sanders hastily took him aside for some whispered 
exchanges, then he returned to our table wearing the look of chagrin 
he made so famous on ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' which ended its run 
last spring after winning the first Emmy for its writers, the highly 
regarded Peter Tolan and another person named Garry Shandling. Shandling, 
as it happens, is also listed as the ``as told to'' author of the 
autobiography, but Sanders dismissed him as a sort of secretary who 
took some time to assemble the book only because he had no other useful 
work. As Sanders put it, ``I said, `Look, maybe you can help me transcribe 
it and organizationally help me, plus I think it would be a joy for 
you just to hear about my life.' And he said, `OK.''' It was clear 
that Sanders was off the air; he ordered a big meal and ate heartily. 
In fact, he said, he is happy that he does not have to watch his weight 
so closely any longer. ``Television really does add about 10 pounds 
to your physical appearance, and actually television adds about 20 
pounds to your ego, by the way,'' he said. To try to keep his ego 
from being deflated, he added, he has started a new diet. ``I have 
a nutritionist who is Bruce Willis' nutritionist, and she has increased 
my carb level to maintain my ego at a very steady place, rate, mountain, 
actually,'' he said, adding that the nutritionist did not actually 
work for Bruce Willis but just used the name in the title of her business 
because that appealed to insecure celebrities. ``I actually go to 
Kevin Costner's doctor; I don't know his first name or last name, 
I just know him as Kevin Costner's doctor,'' he said. ``I have Kate 
Capshaw's decorator doing my wood floors and Candice Bergen's hair 
stylist doing my hair tomorrow, in fact. I made the mistake the other 
day of going to Jackie Chan's acupuncturist, and I am so energetic 
that I can't handle it.'' Sanders insists in his book that he will 
not traffic in idle gossip, but he goes on to reveal affairs with 
a number of actresses and said those flings were all behind him. He 
confessed, however, that one of those flames still burned bright, 
for the actress Winona Ryder. As viewers of the talk show will recall, 
Ms. Ryder spurned Sanders' advances in favor of the comic who replaced 
Sanders, Jon Stewart. ``I'm sure now that Winona knows she made the 
wrong choice,'' Sanders said. ``We've all done that in our lives, 
and that makes me love her all the more because she's vulnerable and 
makes mistakes. In fact, I got a note from her the other day that 
says, `Please stop calling me.' But the fact that she sends a note 
means that there's something more subliminal there. We also have what 
I think is a very romantic thing, which is that every time I drive 
by her house she closes the curtains. It's like a little signal we 
have.'' Asked about great moments from his talk show, Sanders was 
candid about the difficulties of finding the right chemistry with 
a guest. ``You know, most of the great moments in a talk show happen 
spontaneously where, no matter how much preparation you have, there's 
some unexpected moment that creates a spark between the guest,'' he 
said. ``There was never one of those.'' Sanders went on to say that, 
though preparation was important, intuition played a more important 
role in the success of a talk show host. ``One of the things I'm most 
proud of is I always felt as an interviewer I reflected what America 
was thinking,'' he said. ``That was such a gigantic accomplishment 
because I don't read anything, any newspaper, any book, any map. I 
don't listen to the news because I find newscasters to have even bigger 
egos than talk show hosts. So I really knew very little and had to 
sort of wing it.'' Sanders insisted that the future, though empty 
for him at the moment, would be bright. ``There's not a day that goes 
by, by the way, when I don't go up to someone and say, `Aren't you 
curious about what I'm going to do next?''' he said. ``I think people 
feel awkward pushing me on it, and so they're nice enough not to respond.'' 
He added: ``I don't see myself pursuing an acting career, but I'm 
sorting that out. If the right thing came along perhaps, you know, 
if there was a `Private Ryan' type of movie, I might be interested 
in playing one of the soldiers. Or for that matter, one of the frightened 
French shop owners who has to run into the cellar. Although that might 
make a good special for me on television. But that's in the future.''
