Five Hong Kong soccer players appeared in court on Tuesday as Amy 
Dickers reports from the Chinese territory. They have been charged 
with fixing matches. Hong Kong's anti-corruption officials Tuesday 
brought a total of 17 charges against the five men. All the charges 
relate to match fixing, including the rigging of a World Cup qualifier. 
The soccer players pleaded not guilty to all charges. Three of the 
men were accused of conspiring to take 26,000 U.S. dollars to insure 
Hong Kong's team lost two goals to Thailand in a World Cup qualifying 
match last March. Hong Kong lost the game two to nothing. The two 
other players were charged with accepting $3800 each to restrain their 
efforts in the match. A sixth athlete has already been sentenced to 
one year in jail after being convicted of rigging the game. The judge 
presiding over the case granted the five men release on bail of $3800 
each, but impounded their passports. He called these offenses extremely 
serious and told the athletes not to leave Hong Kong. The case was 
front page news in Hong Kong's newspapers Tuesday. It was also the 
subject of some stern editorials which criticized the footballers' 
conduct. Amy Dickers for VOA News, Hong Kong.
