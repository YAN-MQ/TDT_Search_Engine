Nearly 4 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C and most 
don't realize it. It's a slow-acting virus transmitted through the 
blood that was first discovered nearly a decade ago. Hepatitis C attacks 
the liver, resulting in inflammation. And in some cases, cirrhosis. 
When star tissue breaks up the normal structure of the liver, the 
most common symptom is fatigue. But many patients have no symptoms. 
Nearly 3/4 of the people who contract the illness carry it for life. 
The centers for disease control and prevention reports most new infections 
are due to drug use or sexual behavior. Also at risk, infants born 
to infected women, hospital workers and anyone who had a blood transfusion 
prior to July, 1992. Hepatitis C is detected through a blood test. 
There's no vaccine against the disease. Treatment is available through 
an anti-viral drug, but there's no cure.
