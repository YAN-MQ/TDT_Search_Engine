The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments today as to whether police 
can search people or their possessions when they have been ticketed 
for routine traffic violations. A lawyer for an Iowa man says his 
client's constitutional protection against unreasonable searches was 
violated when police found marijuana in his car after he was given 
a speeding ticket. The court is expected to rule in the case by July.
