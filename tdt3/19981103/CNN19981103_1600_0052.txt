Americans are deciding today whether to change the political landscape. 
Each vote cast will help determine the balance of power in the House 
of Representatives. Which party will control the Senate, and who will 
reside in the governors mansions. Here's what's at stake -- these 
elections are about more than just the candidates. In some states, 
voters are deciding whether to Levy more taxes, or build new schools. 
President Clinton says this is the chance for voters to deliver a 
message to government. I think this election is a referendum on all 
the hopes of the American people for the future and their assessment 
of the current condition and how we get from here to a better tomorrow. 
I think that's what it will be. That's what all elections are. None 
of us know what is going to happen. That's the honest truth.
