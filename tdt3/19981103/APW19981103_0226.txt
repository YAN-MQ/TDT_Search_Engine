Three bombs exploded, killing one man, and a fourth device was deactivated 
in a western Tajikistan town, a news report said Tuesday. The first 
blast went off near the office of the Interior Ministry in the town 
of Kurgan-Tyube on Monday night, killing a driver working for the 
regional prosecutor's office, the Interfax news agency reported. Another 
bomb exploded near a weapons storage facility belonging to the Kurgan-Tyube 
police department, while the third went off near a downtown market. 
No one was injured in those two blasts. Local police detonated a fourth 
bomb Tuesday morning, also in Kurgan-Tyube, located 95 kilometers 
(58 miles) of the Tajik capital Dushanbe. Police have detained a number 
of suspects, Interfax said, without providing further details. Tajikistan's 
five-year civil war formally ended last year but the country still 
suffers from periodic outburts of violence.
