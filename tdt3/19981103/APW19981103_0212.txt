A member of Myanmar's chief opposition party has resigned as a member 
of the parliament elected in 1990 but never allowed by the military 
government to meet, a state-run newspaper said Tuesday. Min Thu Wun, 
89, a scholar and poet, cited age as his reason for stepping down, 
the newspaper New Light of Myanmar said. But the resignation adds 
to the dozens of members of the parliament who have quit in recent 
years. Some have accused the government of pressuring them to resign. 
Min Thu Wun is the second member of parliament for the National League 
for Democracy, headed by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, 
to have quit since Suu Kyi stepped up a campaign against the military 
government in July. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by 
the military since 1962. Suu Kyi rose to prominence in anti-government 
uprisings in 1988 that were bloodily suppressed. The military allowed 
elections in 1990 but never honored the results after the opposition 
won in a landslide.
