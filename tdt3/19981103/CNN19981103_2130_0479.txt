This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Wednesday. Rain will push into the pacific northwest 
changing to snow in the higher elevations. We'll also see snow through 
the northern and central Rockies and perhaps out into the plains states 
with rain showers farther south in Texas. Rain will move off the east 
coast, but we'll continue to see rain and thunderstorms across Florida. 
Highs on Wednesday will range from 30s in northern New England the 
Great Lakes and northern plains to 60s and 70s, a couple of 80s in 
the extreme south. Looking ahead to Thursday, rain continues in the 
northwest with a mix of rain and snow through the plains as cool air 
pushes into that area. Friday, rain and snow in the northwest, scattered 
showers through Texas. Rain and snow possible around the Great Lakes. 
And on Saturday, it'll be wet across much of the country with snow 
in some of the cooler spots. Highs will be just in the 30s over the 
northern plains. Don't forget, you can find four-day forecasts for 
more than 7200 cities. The address -- CNN.com.
