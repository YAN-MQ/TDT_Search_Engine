Palestinian security forces have in recent months foiled Iranian-backed 
attempts by Islamic militants to assassinate Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat and senior members of his government, a senior Arafat aide 
said Tuesday. Iran is training and funding a secret cell within the 
Islamic militant group Hamas to carry out the assassinations and suicide 
bombings in Israel, Tayyeb Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of the 
Palestinian Authority, told The Associated Press. ``We arrested several 
of these people who had plans detailing the assassinations,'' Abdel 
Rahim said. In October, Palestinian intelligence agents arrested a 
Hamas activist, Jamal Natche, in the West Bank town of Hebron. Natche 
was given orders by Iran to kill Arafat, Abdel Rahim said, but did 
not provide details. In a sharply worded leaflet, Hamas denied that 
it was receiving money from Iran. ``Those who are cooperating with 
the enemy should remain silent,'' the leaflet said in a reference 
to the Palestinian Authority's pledge as part of the new peace agreement 
to crack down on Hamas and to try and prevent terror attacks against 
Israelis. Hamas, which has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings 
in Israel since 1994, said the attacks would continue. ``Hamas renews 
its commitment to the Palestinian people to continue the holy war 
and resistance against our occupiers,'' the leaflet said. A Hamas 
leader, Ismail Hanieh, said that more than 300 supporters of the group 
have been rounded up since last Thursday's suicide attack on an Israeli 
convoy in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian official have put the number 
of detainees at more than 100. Hanieh said the dialogue between Hamas 
and the Palestinian Authority has resumed. Hanieh said he met Monday 
with Palestinian intelligence officials and demanded that all detainees 
be freed. He said the security officials did not give an immediate 
response. As a result of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, there 
have been mounting threats against Arafat. Iran's spiritual leader, 
Ali Khamenei, has called Arafat a traitor. The leader of the pro-Iranian 
Hezbollah group in Lebanon, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, said Arafat's 
hands should be chopped off for signing the agreement. The Hamas military 
wing, Izzedine al Qassam, warned Arafat of ``the wrath of vengeance'' 
for his crackdown on Hamas, imposed after last week's suicide attack 
by the group on an Israeli convoy. On Monday, the 69-year-old Arafat 
dismissed the threats with a wave of his hand. ``It is not the first 
time and it won't be the last. I don't care,'' said Arafat, who has 
survived several attempts on his life during his decades as Palestinian 
leader. Israeli media reports said the CIA has given Arafat's security 
chiefs, Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan. instructions on how to 
deal with the new situation. However, Abdel Rahim said security for 
Arafat has not been beefed up in response to the threats. With no 
designated successor, Arafat's sudden death would create chaos within 
Palestinian society. Such a situation would seriously threaten an 
already shaky peace process.
