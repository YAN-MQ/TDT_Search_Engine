On the brink of dawn, when almost any other college undergraduate 
would expect the right to sleep undisturbed, Emily Seifert slipped 
stoically out of her warm bed, pulled on boots and a snug jacket, 
and trudged into the bracing chill of a New England autumn to lend 
a hand with the farm chores. ``It was kind of fun being out at 6:30 
and watching the sun come up, because I wouldn't be out otherwise,'' 
said Ms. Seifert, a 19-year-old sophomore at Sterling College. Rising 
with the chickens _ and feeding them _ is part of an education at 
Sterling, an iconoclastic Vermont institution that integrates labor 
with learning at a time when some traditional colleges are phasing 
out work programs and increasing financial aid to allow students more 
study time. Sterling College considers how its students learn as no 
less important than what they learn. So they build a stone wall before 
sitting down in class to discuss what Robert Frost meant when he began 
his poem: ``Something there is that doesn't love a wall.'' They are 
taught, in a course called Forgotten Arts, to make their own snowshoes 
and canoe paddles, which they then use to venture out and study the 
woods and rivers of northern Vermont. The college library and its 
computer room stay open all night. But down the road, draft horses 
and other livestock await feeding and watering at the campus barn. 
The college's agricultural courses grow 15 to 20 percent of its food. 
And Sterling students learn to use an ax as well as a computer. ``A 
computer is a tool, too,'' said the college's president, John E. Williamson. 
``You have to keep your skills sharp in both of them.'' Sterling College, 
once a boys' preparatory school, became a two-year junior college 
in 1987. This year, it expanded into the smallest accredited four-year 
college in the country. The college has only 75 students on campus, 
a 140-acre expanse of rolling meadows and woods. Fifteen second-year 
students are deployed in field internships around the country. With 
its focus on the environment, Sterling offers majors in sustainable 
agriculture, wildlands ecology and management and the growing field 
of outdoor education. ``Students in general hunger for meaningful 
work, and stewardship of land speaks to them a lot,'' Edward Houston, 
the dean of the college, said. ``In America we still consider that 
owning and taking care of land is one of our deepest freedoms. But 
taking care of land is hard work.'' Houston admitted that owning an 
ax was not obligatory at Harvard, where he was an undergraduate. But 
at Sterling, he said, ``We think of ourselves as a liberal arts college. 
It's not just about forest management. It's about a metaphor for life.'' 
Sterling students have gone on to become foresters, veterinarians, 
farm managers, environmental lawyers and officials in the Forest Service 
and National Park Service. At least one became a doctor, another an 
architect, yet another an artist. ``There's a lot of things at Sterling 
that you can be good at,'' said Vanessa Gabriele, 21, a sophomore 
from Freeport, Maine. ``I knew I'd learn enough about how to live 
my life, and it wouldn't be a waste of time.'' If Sterling College 
doesn't fit the conventional mold, neither do its students, many of 
whom chafed at learning by the book and at the social frivolity of 
their adolescent peers. Ms. Seifert was home-schooled in Fletcher, 
Vt., until she was 16, when her parents sent her to the local high 
school. She felt uncomfortable with the other students. ``A lot of 
them were very busy being obnoxious adolescents with raging hormones,'' 
she said. As a result, Ms. Seifert said, ``I wasn't interested in 
going to a college that was a lot like public high school.'' At Sterling, 
she said, ``It's hands-on, not sitting and listening for hours and 
hours, but doing things, too.'' Any college that launches its first 
semester by dispatching students on an overnight orienteering course 
and ends it with a four-day winter expedition that forces them to 
trek through 30 miles of snow and ice hardly meets anyone's definition 
of a party school. ``I think that Sterling instills a real sense of 
the work ethic,'' said Diane Morgan, the college's director of career 
resources. When its graduates apply for paid jobs, she said, ``They're 
willing to work long hard hours, and they don't mind being asked to 
work.'' Scott Shope, a 25-year-old junior from Seattle, worked for 
several years as a firefighter and heavy equipment operator to save 
enough money for Sterling's tuition, which is $18,900 a year, including 
room and board. More than 70 percent of the students do receive some 
financial aid. ``I guess you could say Sterling walks the walk,'' 
said Shope, who plans to become a wildlife ecologist. ``The place 
is right for me. It's the only place I ever considered seriously.'' 
Sterling's curriculum cuts across traditional disciplines. The natural 
science course assigns each student a ``bio'' or plot of wetland or 
woodland to study for its botanical and geological secrets. In another 
course on forestry techniques, students use a two-man crosscut saw 
and extract the timber with horses. They are taught rock climbing 
to develop self-confidence as well as to depend upon each other. ``The 
learning that the students are doing outside the walls has an absolutely 
direct connection with the syllabus that's given in their classwork,'' 
said Williamson, a former Outward Bound instructor. For example, he 
said, the winter expedition offers the context for a literature course, 
Triumphs of the Human Spirit, that discusses such books as ``West 
with the Night'' by Beryl Markham and ``South'' by the polar explorer 
Ernest Shackleton. The college's eight faculty members and seven adjuncts 
work alongside their charges. ``The notion of doing meaningful labor 
across generations has disappeared to a large degree,'' said Houston, 
who teaches a survey course titled Humans and the Environment. Mike 
Serbanica, 18, from Madison, N.J., found his teachers unusually accessible. 
``They're always willing to talk to you and find out what's going 
on,'' Serbanica said. ``At any other university, they'd just be on 
their way to the next class.'' But Jessica Vernay, from Cortland, 
N.Y., said they also pile on the homework. ``There's more reading 
than I could ever do,'' Ms. Vernay said. ``There's a lot of reading 
and a lot of assignments and a lot of times where you have to sit 
down and write.'' Even so, Ms. Vernay, who is 21, was allowed last 
year to go off to Alabama to build an experimental house from bales 
of straw and plaster. Houston said he wants students to cultivate 
a self-reliance that goes beyond marketable skills. ``I like them 
to get away from the idea that you have to buy everything,'' he said. 
``I want to help them see that consumerism is a fairly inadequate 
measure of success.'' After earning an Associate of Arts degree in 
resource management, 80 percent of Sterling's graduates have pursued 
a B.A. at other colleges as diverse as Middlebury, Oberlin, Sarah 
Lawrence and the University of Vermont. But now that Sterling has 
been accredited as a four-year institution by the New England Association 
of Schools and Colleges, more students plan to stay on. Ms. Gaffney 
said her father, a philosophy professor, and her mother, an antiquarian 
book seller, didn't want her to attend Sterling for just two years. 
``My parents were more interested when they found out it would be 
four years,'' she said. As the college expands, Williamson plans to 
add more dormitories and a new science laboratory and recruit more 
faculty, and he has put the library online. But he said he was determined 
not to have Sterling's expansion eclipse the outdoor experiences that 
kept the small college unique. ``The challenge is to make sure we 
don't turn all of that off and put computer terminals in every room 
and keep the kids inside all year,'' Williamson said.
