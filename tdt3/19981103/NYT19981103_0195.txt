NATIONAL FORECAST At 3 p.m. CDT Tuesday, the remnant circulation of 
winds that once were Hurricane Mitch regenerated into a minimal tropical 
storm about 50 miles west-southwest of the city of Campeche on the 
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. On Wednesday, the marginal tropical system 
will move eastward across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida. With 
moisture gathering ahead of the system, clusters of showers and thunderstorms, 
some heavy, will develop over the peninsula and will likely intensify 
Wednesday night and into Thursday as the tropical system approaches. 
Heavy rain and flooding are possible over the southern half of the 
Florida peninsula. Meanwhile, fog and patchy drizzle will dampen much 
of the Front Range of the Rockies on Wednesday as moist winds from 
the east continue to be forced up the sloping terrain. Light, patchy 
snow will dust higher elevations across parts of Colorado and Wyoming. 
Light to moderate rains will affect the Pacific Northwest Coast on 
Wednesday as a Pacific disturbance moves inland. The focus of moderate 
rains will likely occur on west-facing slopes of the Coastal Range, 
Cascade and Olympic mountains. Patchy light snow will continue over 
the mountains of northern New England as a low pressure system which 
has been stalled over the Canadian Maritimes for several days continues 
to circulate cold, moist air southward from Quebec. Sprinkles of rain 
will fall in the valleys. However, moist air moving eastward will 
dry on descent from the Appalachians, setting the stage for a partly 
to mostly sunny day along much of the Northeast Seaboard. FOCUS: ILKS 
OF FOG Fog blanketed the Front Range of the Colorado Rockies early 
Tuesday as moist winds from the east gently glided up the sloping 
terrain. This ilk of fog is called upslope fog. More traditionally, 
ground fog, sometimes called valley fog, forms on a clear night with 
light winds as the ground rapidly loses its heat to space. In turn, 
the ground chills a layer of overlying air, coaxing invisible water 
vapor to condense into tiny water droplets. Another type of fog called 
advection fog forms when moist air passes over cool ocean waters. 
The wind then carries or advects the fog inland.
