Hoping to pressure Germany into demanding the extradition of Chilean 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chilean exiles filed complaints Tuesday with 
German prosecutors accusing the former dictator of responsibility 
for human rights abuses 25 years ago. Pinochet ``must be brought to 
justice,'' said Rainer Patz, spokesman for a group coordinating the 
action. ``We're doing this for those who can no longer speak.'' While 
France issued an international arrest warrant Monday for the former 
dictator, and Switzerland has demanded Pinochet's extradition, prosecutors 
were examining whether Germany has jurisdiction in all its cases. 
None of the plaintiffs were German citizens when the alleged abuses 
happened. There also were questions about whether the statute of limitations 
has expired on the charges, which date back to 1973. Suits on behalf 
of four plaintiffs were filed Tuesday in Hanover and Hamburg. One 
man accuses Pinochet of responsibility in his kidnap and torture, 
and of the disappearance and probable murder of his brother in 1976. 
Three other plaintiffs accuse Pinochet of genocide, murder, crimes 
against humanity, deprivation of personal liberty and causing serious 
bodily harm. A fifth plaintiff, who filed her suit on Monday in Cologne, 
accuses Pinochet of depriving her of personal liberty and causing 
bodily harm during her arrest and torture in 1973. More legal actions 
were expected, Patz said. Germany's Justice Ministry did not return 
calls seeking comment. The legal actions were the latest by Chilean 
exiles who say they suffered under Pinochet's 17-year rule since Britain's 
High Court ruled illegal the former dictator's arrest in London on 
a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping 
and torture. Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, is expected 
to rule this week on an appeal claiming that Pinochet is immune from 
prosecution as a former head of state. The judges were expected uphold 
the appeal, meaning that Britain would be unlikely to honor other 
extradition requests. Chilean exiles across Europe _ in Belgium, Norway 
and Sweden _ have filed complaints similar to the ones in Germany 
seeking either Pinochet's prosecution or extradition A report by Chile's 
democratically elected government says more than 3,000 people were 
killed or disappeared during Pinochet's rule.
