Brad Pitt eats pancakes there. Sandra Bullock asks for huevos rancheros. 
Nicolas Cage shows up with his family for brunch. And Vince Vaughn 
and Jon Favreau, over numerous cups of coffee, worked out the plot 
of the movie ``Swingers'' and actually filmed a crucial scene there. 
No, it's not some trendy cafe with an unlisted phone number and a 
snooty policy of favoring celebrities, models and assorted hangers-on. 
It's the thoroughly nondescript Hollywood Hills Coffee Shop, (first 
come, first served) in a downscale Best Western Hotel on Franklin 
Avenue near Vine Street _ a part of town in need of urban renewal. 
And what makes the coffee shop successful is not so much the movie 
and television clientele but the high-quality comfort-style food _ 
breakfast dishes all day _ which seems as unglamourous and basic as 
the street outside. ``We serve all day long because that, really, 
is the L.A. lifestyle,'' said Susan Fine Moore, the coffee shop's 
owner, a onetime chef, restaurant consultant and food writer. ``Here 
you're always driving somewhere _ you can have a meeting at noon, 
go over the hill to a studio in the valley and be finished at 2:30, 
and you're hungry. You go to a fancy restaurant, and they say, `Oh, 
the kitchen's closed.' I don't understand that.'' Ms. Moore took over 
the once-shabby restaurant with her husband, Michael Moore, a former 
model, in 1994. The food, she said, was ``inedible, beyond crummy, 
embarrassing.'' Shaking her head, she said: ``Half the time the lights 
weren't even on. There were dead fake plants in the window.'' But 
the feisty Ms. Moore said the place had ``good bones.'' With a $50,000 
investment, the couple repainted, cleaned up, bought new dishes (``There 
wasn't a plate that matched,'' she said), built red Naugahyde booths, 
hired a new staff and created a sort of diner-Mex fusion menu. The 
dishes range from omelets and meat loaf to burritos and the popular 
torta tortillas (omelets made with tortillas and topped with salsa). 
Shrewdly, Ms. Moore kept prices low (most dishes cost less than $10), 
sent out flyers in the neighborhood (which is populated by aspiring 
actors) and hung out a sign saying, ``Last Cappuccino Before the 101.'' 
(Thousands of cars pass the restaurant en route to the nearby Route 
101, the Hollywood Freeway; it was a signal, of course, that the coffee 
shop was coming up in the world.) Its coffee shop roots give it little 
tolerance for Hollywood's diet fads. ``We kind of pride ourselves 
on being an oasis from all that craziness,'' said Ms. Moore, who is 
planning to open another restaurant, the Bungalow, nearby. ``There's 
a new diet, a new fad every week, but actually people seem a little 
bit less obsessed than they used to be about diets. Otherwise we wouldn't 
be so busy. Generation X is lovely _ they'll eat anything. And the 
older generation is figuring, I suppose, who wants to live to 108 
if you can't put butter on your potato?'' In the first weeks of Ms. 
Moore's management of the restaurant, and as word spread, customers 
began to drift in, especially actors and others who live in the more 
affluent Hollywood Hills and Beachwood Canyon areas nearby. The earliest 
customers were noncelebrities in the film and television business 
who lived in the neighborhood _ set designers, makeup artists, costumers, 
cinematographers, writers, producers, mid-level executives. The comedy 
team that created the CBS show ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' used a 
back room at the restaurant to write the pilot. Soon enough, celebrities 
began showing up _ Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Paltrow, Edward Burns, Jennifer 
Aniston, Johnny Depp, Minnie Driver, Matthew McConaughey, Gary Oldman, 
Andy Garcia, Quentin Tarantino. Brad Pitt's arrival caused a bit of 
a stir. ``It was like meeting, well, Burt Lancaster,'' said Ms. Moore, 
who is 50. And the place is starting to show up in some of the customers' 
material: Sandra Bernhard refers to it in her show opening Thursday 
night at the Booth Theater in New York, ``I'm Still Here . . . Damn 
It!'' What do the customers like about it? ``It's just great food 
in a very relaxed atmosphere _ and you don't feel like everyone's 
craning their heads to see who's having breakfast with who,'' said 
Lorenzo Di Bonaventura, president of worldwide production at Warner 
Brothers, who often eats there in the morning on the way to work. 
Jon Favreau, the actor, who was living in a $470-a-month apartment 
near the restaurant when Ms. Moore took it over, began spending afternoons 
there drinking coffee at a table with his friend Vince Vaughn, then 
another unemployed actor. They began plotting the screenplay for ``Swingers,'' 
about unemployed actors in Hollywood. A key scene in the hit film 
_ in which Vaughn matches goo-goo eyes with a woman who turns out 
to be making faces at her baby _ was shot at the coffee shop. ``It 
was like a family atmosphere,'' Favreau said. ``We didn't have a lot 
of money, and I lived in a tiny apartment up the block. I loved the 
people who ran the place, who made you feel like a big shot, even 
if you weren't. Very good portions _ you never left hungry.'' Favreau, 
who grew up in New York, added: ``It's a gathering place. You always 
run into a dozen people you know. It reminds me of places in Queens.'' 
The restaurant's 2,500-square-foot dining area seats 88 people at 
15 tables and a 14-seat counter. The prime tables are the half-dozen 
booths by the windows, but there are no reservations, and even well-known 
actors wait in line. Sometimes people from as far west as Brentwood 
and Beverly Hills take the long drive to Hollywood for Sunday brunch. 
``We have an inside joke,'' Ms. Moore said. ``People from Brentwood 
come here, and if you take them to what we consider the best table, 
they'll refuse it right away. They have to refuse the first table 
you show them. We'll call them on it. We'll say, `Are you from Brentwood?' 
They'll say, `How did you know?' '' TORTA TORTILLA Adapted from Hollywood 
Hills Coffee Shop Time: 30 minutes 12 6-inch corn tortillas 14 large 
eggs 6 teaspoons butter Tomatillo Sauce (recipe follows) 1{ cups shredded 
ranchero or other mild cheese 3 cups cooked black beans (optional). 
1. Heat oven to 200 degrees. Soften the tortillas by sprinkling lightly 
with water and warming briefly on a grill or hot skillet. 2. In a 
medium mixing bowl, combine the eggs and whisk until well blended. 
Set a fine strainer over a bowl, and pour the mixture into the strainer. 
Whisk until it has drained into the bowl. Set aside. 3. In a 6- or 
7-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, melt 1 teaspoon butter. 
Add \ cup egg mixture, and immediately add 1 tortilla. Quickly tilt 
the pan (or turn the tortilla with a fork) to coat both sides with 
egg. Immediately add another \ cup egg mixture and another tortilla. 
Again coat the top of the tortilla with egg. 4. Allow the bottom of 
the torta to set and lightly brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Using a spatula, 
flip the torta to brown the other side. Transfer to a heat-proof platter, 
and keep warm in the oven. Repeat the process to make a total of six 
tortas. 5. To serve, transfer a torta to each of six serving plates. 
Top each with \ cup shredded cheese, and a spoonful of Tomatillo Sauce. 
Pass the remaining sauce separately. If desired, serve with a side 
dish of black beans. Yield: 6 servings. TOMATILLO SAUCE Time: 45 minutes 
20 tomatillos, husks removed 3 whole jalapenos, stems removed 1 onion, 
chopped 1 cup loosely packed cilantro Salt and freshly ground black 
pepper. 1. In a medium saucepan, combine the tomatillos, the jalapenos, 
the onion and the cilantro. Add just enough water to cover. Place 
over high heat, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer until 
the tomatillos are softened, about 30 minutes. Drain the mixture into 
a clean pan or bowl, reserving the liquid. 2. Transfer the vegetables 
to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Add just 
enough of the cooking liquid, about \ cup, to thin the mixture to 
a fluid sauce. Mix well, and season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Refrigerate until needed. Yield: 3 cups.
