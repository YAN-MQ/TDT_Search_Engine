Two thousand ABC employees who went on a 24-hour strike on Monday 
were not allowed to return to work Tuesday morning. Signs were posted 
on doors of ABC's offices and studios in five cities _ New York, Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Washington _ announcing a lockout 
of workers. After the union went on strike Monday at 5 a.m., affecting 
both the network and WABC-TV, its New York affiliate, the network's 
management responded by locking the employees out. The strikers, including 
camera operators, videotape editors, couriers, technicians, engineers 
and some writers, will be locked out until their union, the National 
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, promises to give 
ABC warning of future strikes, said Julie Hoover, a company spokeswoman. 
Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the union, which is known as Nabet, said 
there was little chance of that happening. ``That would require us 
to waive our rights as a labor union,'' he said. The union got some 
moral support Tuesday, Election Day, one of the busiest news days 
of the year. Vice President Al Gore canceled an interview with the 
network and the Senate candidate Charles Schumer vowed not to give 
interviews to ABC reporters. The Rev. Jesse Jackson joined the picket 
line in Chicago, and Michael Moore, the film producer, picketed with 
workers on Manhattan's Upper West Side. According to union officials, 
workers walked off their jobs over a dispute about a health care plan 
that the Walt Disney Co., ABC's parent, would like the workers to 
accept. ``The conflict is about the company's failure to provide information 
on the proposed medical plan,'' Donahue said, adding that the network 
would not provide details about the costs of out-of-network care under 
its proposed health plan. Ms. Hoover said the medical issue was bogus. 
``Nabet is trying to put pressure on us at the bargaining table,'' 
she said. Since the strike, Nabet has made two offers, both of which 
were rejected by ABC. It offered not to strike on the health care 
issue again and not to strike for 30 days. ``That provides us with 
security for 30 days and nothing on Day 31,'' Ms. Hoover said. Ms. 
Hoover said the workers would be replaced with ABC employees trained 
to do the behind-the-camera jobs and with temporary workers. Tuesday 
about 250 ABC workers wearing placards bearing the words ``Locked 
Out'' picketed outside ABC's studios and offices on Manhattan's Upper 
West Side. ``In the past, there have been fights,'' said one of the 
locked-out workers, Douglas Godly, 39, a maintenance technician who 
has worked for ABC for eight years. ``It was like a family squabble. 
We've had labor differences before. But this is the worst I've seen 
and it's Disney's doing. They have made themselves very unpopular 
at ABC.''
