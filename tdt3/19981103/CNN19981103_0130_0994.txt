Hundreds of union workers at ABC walked off the job Monday in a dispute 
over health care benefits. Tony Guida reports on how the network is 
dealing with the strike. Excuse me, again, I am sorry. Regis philbin 
had a tough morning on his ABC program Monday. Microphones refused 
to work, cameras had a mind of their own. ABC employees who normally 
operate cameras and mikes were on the picket lines. What do we want?! 
Contracts! When do we want them?! now! Some 2,200 ABC union employees 
walked off the job in New York, los Angeles, Chicago, Washington and 
San Francisco. Union leadership said it was a 24-hour walkout to protest 
what it called "An unfair labor practice" by the company, not providing 
enough information on a new medical plan. Without that information, 
we can't decide what's in the best interest of our members. Would 
you buy an insurance policy without knowing what coverage would be 
provided? ABC said it provided all the information it had. There is 
bad blood between this union, know as nabet, and ABC. The workers 
have not had a contract in 19 months. The union has threatened job 
actions before. But the union's action was met with retaliation. ABC 
said it was locking out the strikers, adding -- The company's announcement 
coming just as the union was erecting picket lines at veteran's stadium 
in Philadelphia, site of ABC's Monday night football telecast. ABC 
said it would call off the lockout when the union guarantees the company 
in writing that it will give ABC advance notice of any future job 
actions. It's really in some ways a declaration of war. Does the union 
underlabelize the right to strike any time it wants, once there's 
no contract? They have that right. And now ABC is essentially asking 
to give those rights up. On the picket line, the workers watched the 
maneuvering, and they're concerned. There's a lot of posturing going 
on. And I think the atmosphere is moving quickly towards a poison 
well. Late Monday, the union seemed to give a little, saying it will 
not strike on the health issue again if the company agrees to have 
it decided by an outside mediator. Tony Guida, "CNN Financial News,"
