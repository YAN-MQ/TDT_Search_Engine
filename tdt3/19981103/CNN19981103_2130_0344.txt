"Almost impossible to predict the extent of the damage" -- that's 
how the president of Honduras describes the aftermath of hurricane 
Mitch. Across Honduras and Nicaragua, civil defense officials say 
there may be as many as 7,000 dead and 1 million people homeless. 
Parts of southern Mexico have also been especially hard hit. Over 
1,000 deaths in Nicaragua are blamed on mudslides. President Clinton 
says the U.S. must do all it can to help its neighbors. It is inconceivable 
to most Americans that a natural disaster would lead to the deaths 
of thousands of people. And keep in mind that all of those countries 
are much smaller than we are. Imagine how we would feel in America 
if 7,000 people died in this country in a natural disaster. And the 
combined population of these countries is so muck smaller than ours. 
Virtually every family will be effected in some way or another. And 
so I would say, first of all, let's help them deal with the present 
crisis, and deal with it as rapidly and as well as possible, and of 
course look at what we can do to help them rebuild. The U.S. is looking 
for ways to expand the $3 1/2 million in aid. Helicopters and other 
aircraft along with disaster assistance response teams have been sent 
to each country affected by the storm.
