Just across the street from Madison Square Garden, Paul Vellios was 
sitting with a dozen of his regulars at the bar of Cafi 31 Tuesday 
night, with his eyes fixed on an empty dining room. Normally, the 
sports bar would have been packed with Knick fans by early evening 
and filled with players late at night. Normally, Allan Houston would 
have taken a table with some friends and sat quietly eating an appetizer. 
Normally, John Starks would have popped in and shaken a few hands 
as he found a seat in the back. But normality fell victim to the reality 
of the National Basketball Association lockout Tuesday night. With 
eager waiters standing in the background, Cafi 31 was bare. By about 
8:10 p.m., the originally scheduled tip-off for the Knicks game against 
the Celtics, the Garden looked like the first cousin to an abandoned 
warehouse without a player, fan or vendor to fill its famous space. 
``It's quiet around here, isn't it?,'' said Vellios, who is part owner 
of Cafi 31. ``We go as the Garden goes. If there are people over there, 
there are people in here. Now, everything is different. I'm just trying 
to hold on because the holidays are coming up, and I don't want to 
let go of any of my regular people. It's not an easy situation for 
anyone right now. ``Businesses are hurt, and the fans are hurt. Usually, 
we have kids coming in after the game, lining up for autographs. I 
guess maybe those kids will do better in school now, because they'll 
get home early enough to get their homework done.'' An easy going 
and warm man, Vellios smiled and seemed to be taking the lockout as 
well as he could even though the rhetoric officially turned into reality 
Tuesday night. Perhaps to some fans and players, the night will go 
by without a second thought. What is on television? What movie is 
playing? To others, the first canceled game night of the NBA season 
meant an unsettling adjustment to their normal routines. For the past 
17 years, Buck Williams has had his body ready for the NBA's opening 
night. Instead of feeding off the optimistic buzz of a new season, 
instead of getting his ankles taped, the Knick veteran forward said 
he would be cleaning off the dining-room table after dinner. ``I'm 
going to be domestic,'' Williams said on Monday. ``I'm going to be 
doing all the chores around the house. I'll be taking kids to school, 
packing up the dishwasher. I'll be doing it all. ``You do feel a little 
empty. The leaves are turning different colors, and your body clock 
is a certain hour. It's telling you it's time to go to work. It's 
telling you that it's November and it's time for the regular season. 
You walk around and you get this feeling that something isn't right.'' 
Something is wrong when a longtime ticket-holder such as Fred Klein, 
who has missed only 15 Knick home games since 1959, sees the word 
``canceled'' next to opening night. All these years, Klein has been 
taking his seat beneath the Knicks' basket. Through championship seasons 
and forgettable slumps, he has been sharing his love of the game and 
a piece of his life with his courtside buddies while the price of 
his seat has risen from $2.50 to $175 a game. ``I love the game, and 
when it's there, I'm there,'' said Klein, a restaurant broker and 
investor. ``If the players and owners want to ruin it for themselves, 
let them do it. To me, it's a social thing. I know everyone who sits 
around me. We've all been friends for years. ``No one is getting hurt 
here except the fans and the poor guys who sell you a soda. The other 
guys, they're rich no matter what.'' That sentiment was shared by 
other season ticket-holders. Some are increasingly bitter toward the 
lockout, and feel their voices are going unheard in the debate. Most 
had plans to settle in front of the television or work late. ``What 
else can you do?'' said Lee Fein, a manufacturer in the garment district, 
who has been going to Knick games for more than 20 years. ``I feel 
that this whole thing is absurd on both sides. Neither side should 
be so arrogant in their position _ as reports have shown _ because 
time is wasting. There are other options for the fans and viewers. 
We all have long memories. ``Living in the metropolitan area, with 
all the options there are for us, we can be unforgiving as a fan base. 
I think we'll definitely miss it because we love basketball and the 
NBA. But I think that even though you remember how great it can be, 
no one is going to sit home and pine for the NBA.'' Some ticket-holders 
will be in a bind without the Knicks. Where else will celebrities 
get their camera time? Where else can Spike Lee get under Reggie Miller's 
skin? Where else can corporations entertain clients?
