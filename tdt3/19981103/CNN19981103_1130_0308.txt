Defense secretary William Cohen is in the Persian gulf area working 
to line up support for the possible use of force against Iraqi President 
Saddam hussein. And the U.N. security council is meeting on a resolution 
expected to condemn Iraq for its decision to end cooperation with 
chemical and biological weapons inspectors. Secretary Cohen met with 
Britain's defense minister before flying on to the gulf. The two issued 
a joint statement saying all options for dealing with Iraq remain 
on the table including the use of military force.
