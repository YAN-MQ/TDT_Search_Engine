The Council of Europe inaugurated a streamlined European Court of 
Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, that it hopes will deal faster 
with citizens' complaints. ``Nearly 800 million Europeans will have 
access to this court,'' Daniel Tarschys, the secretary-general of 
the Council of Europe, said at the inauguration ceremony Tuesday. 
``With 40 judges and a jurisdiction spanning from Nuuk in Greenland 
to Petropavlovsk, in Kamchatka (in the Russian far east) ... this 
will be the largest permanent court in the world,'' Tarschys said. 
The new court will work full-time, unlike the old one that operated 
just one week every month and handled about 100 cases a year, said 
council spokeswoman Kathy Burton. ``We're hoping the new system will 
speed up the procedure quite dramatically,'' Burton said. Under the 
old court system, rulings often took years. The court rules on infringements 
of the 1950 European Human Rights Convention that was signed by all 
40 nations in the Council of Europe. Citizens from those nations can 
bring cases to the European court after they have exhausted legal 
options in their home countries.
