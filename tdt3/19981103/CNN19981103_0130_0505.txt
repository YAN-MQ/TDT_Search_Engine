With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen McGinnis. 
Temperatures are dramatically cooler from Hudson bay to the Great 
Lakes and across the northern great plains. Temperatures mostly in 
the 30s. In the southeastern United States, temperatures also drop 
off, 60s and 70s can be found, while mostly 50s for the pacific northwest. 
In our election day forecast and then moving on into Wednesday morning, 
we do have a weather system that will be impacting the mid-atlantic 
and the southeast. It looks like some of that moisture also through 
the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. While a frontal system pushes on shore 
for the pacific northwest, San francisco can expect a cloudy day. 
Look for some afternoon showers for Honolulu and around 85, and some 
snow expected in Barrow, Alaska. For Wednesday, those temperatures 
still cool through the midwest. And some 70s can be found in the desert 
southwest. By Thursday, 70s and 80s in the southwestern U.S., still 
30s through the Great Lakes, 40s and 50s into the mid-atlantic. And 
then by Friday, look for some rain and snow across the northern Rockies 
and for the pacific northwest. For more weather information, log onto
