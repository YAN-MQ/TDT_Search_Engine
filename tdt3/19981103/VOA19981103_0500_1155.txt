Good morning, Charlene. Good morning, Les. Share prices are higher 
on the major European stock exchanges as we speak. The London's FTSI 
up but just barely. The FT100 is ahead by four points at this hour, 
and in Paris, the CAC40 is up 32, and the DAX in Frankfurt is up ten. 
The London morning gold fixing of $290.10 an ounce is up ten cents 
from the close in New York.
