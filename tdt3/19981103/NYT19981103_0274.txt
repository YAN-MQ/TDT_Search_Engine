You know who I want to meet?'' the good doctor asks. ``The sick, twisted 
little bean counter who came up with the health maintenance organization.'' 
As a prickly but secretly noble physician who spouts outrageous truths, 
Ted Danson's John Becker is no more believable than the saintly Marcus 
Welby was. But here, in a promotional spot for the new CBS sitcom 
``Becker,'' he sounds oddly realistic, echoing opinions heard more 
and more often, on and off television. Under the heading ``Becker 
on HMOs,'' the harangue continues: ``You go in with a headache; they 
do a credit scan before a CAT scan. Need surgery? They biopsy your 
wallet. HMOs, you know what HMOs stand for? Have Money or Die.'' More 
astute than the labored series itself, the promo sounds a theme that 
medical dramas have also leaped on this season. ``Chicago Hope,'' 
``E.R.'' and the new ``L.A. Doctors'' have all included more than 
one major story pointedly attacking HMOs. The shows reflect the widespread 
image of HMOs as faceless, heartless monoliths that would rather save 
a penny than save a life. On ``Chicago Hope,'' Dr. Aaron Shutt (Adam 
Arkin) runs into an HMO representative who has been reviewing the 
doctor's prescription for an expensive drug. ``Is that what you HMO 
guys do all day?'' Shutt asks. ``When we're not torturing animals,'' 
says the rep, acknowledging the image of his profession and offering 
viewers a crowd-pleasing joke. Television is scrambling to catch up 
with a critical mass of public opinion, as increasing numbers of people 
have joined managed-care groups (one recent estimate puts HMO membership 
at 75 million, which is 30 million more than five years ago). The 
most volatile stories are not about generic health insurance (though 
those references abound, too), but specifically, angrily about health 
maintenance organizations. The dramas give voice to the audience's 
common complaints about HMOs: not enough individual attention or choice 
of doctors, a maddening lack of logic in the rules of coverage, the 
Kafkaesque nightmare of dealing with a slow-moving bureaucracy about 
an issue as personal and urgent as health. And though in reality, 
patients may blame greedy doctors (or cheapskate employers) for being 
saddled with frustrating HMO care, television doctors are life-saving 
heroes, and this season their noblest acts include standing up to 
HMOs. Every one of these plots involves a heroic doctor who personally 
confronts a villainous number cruncher or physician from an HMO. Fulfilling 
a viewer's fantasy, the series doctors get in the faces of the supposedly 
faceless bureaucracy. This fantasy goes only so far, though. Even 
these fictional HMOs never back down, sending one of the scariest 
social messages to come along in a while: Health maintenance groups 
are even more powerful than doctors. On ``Chicago Hope,'' Shutt prescribes 
the expensive new medication only because a manic-depressive patient 
named Artie reacts badly to two standard, HMO-covered drugs. The HMO 
representative explains that the new drug is covered only for hospitalized 
patients, not out-patients like Artie. ``So let me get this straight,'' 
Shutt says. ``Artie can have the pills he needs only after he suffers 
the psychotic episode the pills would prevent? That's your policy?'' 
On ``L.A. Doctors,'' Dr. Tim Lonner (Matt Craven) has a similar response. 
Astonished that an HMO called Steadicare won't cover medication for 
a migraine patient, he tells his office administrator: ``I don't get 
the logic here. We're talking about a hundred bucks worth of pills 
a year. Without them, they're going to have to cover three or four 
visits to the E.R. each month at $300 a pop. Hasn't anybody explained 
that to them?'' Both plots lead to volatile confrontations. Without 
his medication, Shutt's patient attempts suicide, and Shutt later 
drags the HMO representative into Artie's hospital room. ``It's your 
fault!'' Artie yells. ``I'm not a name on your list. I'm a human being, 
for God's sake.'' The HMO rep says he's sorry and walks away. Shutt 
loses the insurance fight but gains the last word and the moral victory. 
``This is wrong, and you know it,'' he says, though the rep is disappearing 
down the hall and can't hear. ``L.A. Doctors'' is less realistic and 
more blunt than ``Chicago Hope'' or ``E.R.,'' and Lonner's confrontation 
more comic as he decides to shake some sense into the HMO account 
representative, known to him only as 8294-7. Unable to get through 
the 17 voice-mail options on the HMO phone line, Lonner turns up at 
their office, a Dilbert-like warren of anonymity. There he finds 8294-7, 
a wimpy guy with a pocket protector and white hair, played by Michael 
Pollard. Lonner grabs him by the neck and throttles him, obviously 
reading the minds of viewers who have envisioned just such a request 
for benefits. But 8294-7 has his own complaints. ``Can you imagine 
having a job where the whole world hates you?'' he whines. Even worse: 
``I'm covered by Steadicare. I just pray to God I never get sick.'' 
Yet, heartless to the end, he rejects the claim one last time. Lonner 
seems to be a one-man crusade against HMOs. In another episode, he 
arrives at the hospital to see one of his patients, a high school 
athlete with pneumonia. A physician who introduces herself as Meyer 
from the HMO won't let him see the patient or his records. Like all 
the HMO characters, whether doctors or bean counters, male or female, 
Meyer is dowdy and rumpled, in contrast to the series' sleekly good-looking 
heroes. And though Lonner and his three partners have an upscale private 
practice, they also have mile-wide altruistic streaks and the bizarre 
habit of turning up at their patients' houses. So Lonner sneaks in 
to see his patient and decides that he requires a $1,500 test to rule 
out a blood clot. It's no surprise that the HMO doctor refuses. ``From 
where I sit, it looks like you're crunching numbers deciding what 
people are acceptable to sacrifice so your profit margin keeps going 
up,'' Lonner tells Meyer. And she offers the HMO side of the argument. 
``The fact is, doctor, most of the people that are in this hospital 
right now could not afford to be here if it weren't for managed care. 
And just for the record, my patients get the same quality care they 
would if I were in private practice.'' ``Lucky them,'' Lonner says 
sarcastically. There are more complicated arguments to be made on 
both sides, but they are far beyond the bounds of such dramas. And 
why should drama do anything more? There are other places to note 
that some large HMOs have not been doing well lately or that a saber-rattling 
doc like Lonner is pure fantasy. Television dramas satisfy a different 
urge and serve an important social function; the outraged doctors 
deliver a message to HMOs, the fictional ones and all the real ones 
listening in, with an impact beyond what any individual viewer could 
hope to achieve. ``E.R.'' plumbs the complexities of the issue with 
greater dramatic results. In a recent episode, Dr. John Carter (Noah 
Wyle) admits a boy with leukemia to the hospital to treat dehydration. 
In fact, the child is not dehydrated, but the false diagnosis will 
allow him to be treated for expensive in-patient treatment that his 
insurance would not otherwise cover. Yet when the boy's mother learns 
about the ploy she panics and takes him away, afraid of losing their 
coverage completely if Carter's well-meaning scam is discovered. ``What's 
going to happen?'' asks Lucy (Kellie Martin), the medical student 
Carter is supervising. ``He's going to die,'' Carter says of the boy. 
In an earlier episode this season, an unconscious older woman is brought 
into the emergency room and resuscitated by Carter. Soon a cold-blooded 
woman in a drab blue suit arrives and announces, ``I authorize admissions 
for Blue Beacon, her HMO. This lady's a DNR,'' meaning a patient who 
left do-not-resuscitate orders. ``I can't justify an expenditure of 
$5,000 a day on a patient who should not be alive, who does not want 
to be alive,'' she tells Carter. ``Her choice was not to be resuscitated. 
That's what's in the HMO file; that's the guideline I have to follow.'' 
The patient has no family. Carter turns off the machine, takes out 
the tube helping the woman to breathe and sits quietly watching her 
die. ``She's not suffering. It's what she wanted,'' he says, ostensibly 
to Lucy but just as much to convince himself. Recently, HMOs have 
been fighting back with frequent television commercials meant to enhance 
the image of the industry as a whole. One ad compares the cost of 
an expensive operation under most health insurance plans with a $150 
co-payment for an HMO member. The commercials make television even 
more of a battleground in a public relations war that HMOs are surely 
losing. A commercial is no match for the image of the pained and thoughtful 
Carter watching an old woman die.
