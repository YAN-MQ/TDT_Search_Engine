Stay tuned for news next on VOA News now. It's 2130 universal time 
and this is VOA News Now. The United States and Britain say force 
is an option against Iraq unless he steps down in the latest standoff 
over United Nations weapons inspections. On today's DATELINE, a look 
at differing views of justice and reconciliation. All that and more 
in our next half hour of VOA News Now. First, the latest world news. 
I'm Robert Burns, VOA News. As Iraq continues to defy international 
weapons inspectors, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright describes 
the situation as grave. She says all options, including military force, 
are possible. VOA's Gil Butler reports from the State Department. 
Secretary Albright said the focus now is on consultations. She told 
reporters she's been on the telephone almost constantly for the past 
48 hours while Defense Secretary Cohen consults in person in the region. 
She said the United Nations Security Council is considering a resolution 
that would put into official form a very strong demand issued last 
Saturday that Iraq cooperate with the weapons inspections. But she 
made clear authority for military options already exist.
