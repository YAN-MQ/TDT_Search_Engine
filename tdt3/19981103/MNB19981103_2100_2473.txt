Speaker of the house Newt Gingrich. His own re-election wasn't in 
question. Here he is live right now in his home district in Marietta, 
Georgia. He is explaining what is going on around the country on a 
night when open questions are being asked about his leadership of 
the party in this campaign. Let's listen. It has offered the kind 
of leadership that will reduce the size of government and cut taxes. 
I want to see how the election comes out the rest of this evening. 
As you look around the country, there are a couple of things you won't 
hear in the nad media. This will be the first time in 70 years that 
republicans kept control of the house for a third term. And you would 
think that to do something for the first time in 70 years would be 
a fairly big deal, but T among the Washington pundits. But why is 
it a fairly big deal? Because you have every committee will be chaired 
by republicans, every subcommittee will be chaired by republicans. 
The rules committee will be 9-4 in favor of republicans. And we will 
schedule legislation based on a republican agenda. We will gain seats 
this evening as the evening goes on. And let me say to you, we're 
gaining them from a base people tend to forget. Since Bill Clinton 
became president, we have gained 51 house seats, 12 senate seats, 
14 governorships, and over 500 state legislators. Sadly, all those 
figures are not from tonight, but over time since Clinton started 
as president and you have just heard through the national media what 
the speaker said. The national media would not tell you. And that 
is for three straight terms the -- one party has retained control 
of the house. In this case it's been the republicans. Some positive 
spin on tonight's developments so far. A little bit of defiance from 
the speaker of the house talking about the layout of committees in 
the House of Representatives. So far it can't be called a great night 
for the G.O.P.
