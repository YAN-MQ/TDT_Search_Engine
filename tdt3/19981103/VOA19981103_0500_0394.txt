The corruption trial of Malaysia's ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar 
Ibrahim has resumed in Kuala Lumpur. Mr. Anwar was brought to the 
courthouse earlier today to consult with his lawyers over fresh evidence 
presented during the opening of the trial on Monday. The former deputy 
prime minister has pleaded not guilty to the corruption and sexual 
misconduct charges against him saying they are politically motivated. 
Dozens of riot police have surrounded the courthouse where the trial 
is taking place, but there have been no reports of disturbances.
