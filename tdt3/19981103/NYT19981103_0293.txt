Stocks were narrowly mixed in fairly sluggish trading Tuesday as investors 
resisted pushing prices, which are now at levels not seen in nearly 
three months, any higher. After a four-day advance that sent its shares 
to their highest levels since Aug. 18, the Dow Jones industrial average 
closed unchanged at 8,706.15. The Dow, which slipped during the morning, 
came back in the early afternoon and fell back again at the close, 
has not finished unchanged at the end of a trading day since Dec. 
2, 1996, the New York Stock Exchange said. Meanwhile, the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index barely budged, closing down 0.76 point, 
or less than one-tenth of a percent, to 1,110.85. The Nasdaq composite 
index lost ground, falling 12.48 points, or seven-tenths of a percent, 
to 1,788.43. But the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks posted 
another gain, rising 0.74 point, to 387.56. Volume on the Big Board 
was fairly subdued at 695.47 million shares, down from 751.96 million 
on Monday. After the torrid advance recorded over the last few weeks, 
traders and analysts said a period of consolidation was to be expected. 
``We have put quite a bit of distance between where the market is 
now and its lows'' during the summer, said Bob Gasser, head of block 
trading at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. ``Before any of the major indexes 
makes a major move from here, there has to be some tangible evidence 
about 1999 earnings,'' he said. ``So it is good news that at this 
point the market is sort of trading sideways.'' Richard Cripps, chief 
market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore, said, ``in talking with 
portfolio managers, my sense is that the market is a little tired 
here.'' ``The market is at an important juncture,'' he continued. 
``We are either going to trade on valuations, which means we are at 
the top of the trading range, or we will be trading on momentum and 
will move higher. My sense is that most managers are not inclined 
to go back to the momentum trade.'' Overseas, market indexes in Japan 
and Hong Kong posted strong gains, and stocks also did better in Mexico 
and Brazil. But stocks were mixed on European exchanges. Among Dow 
stocks, Citigroup fell for the second straight session, losing 2, 
to 44 1/8. The world's biggest financial services company has lost 
more than 6 percent of its value since James Dimon, the company's 
president, was forced out. Coca-Cola rallied for a second straight 
day, rising 1 15/16, to 72 15/16. And General Electric was up 1 1/8, 
to 88 1/2. Elsewhere, shares of Boston Scientific Corp. fell 5 7/8, 
or 11 percent, to 46 3/8, after the medical equipment manufacturer 
said it had discovered accounting irregularities at its Japanese subsidiary. 
Trading was halted on the news, dragging down share prices of other 
medical equipment manufacturers. Medtronic dropped 1 5/8, to 64 15/16, 
and Biomet declined 1 5/16, to 33 1/4. Tuesday's most active stock 
was Ciena Corp., which fell 3 9/16, to 18 1/4, giving back part of 
a 78 percent gain recorded during the last three trading sessions. 
In part, investors sold Ciena out of disappointment that a $23 million 
contract announced Tuesday with Enron Corp. to supply networking equipment 
was not larger. Ciena's stock had risen sharply before Tuesday on 
speculation about new contracts and a possible renewed takeover offer 
from Tellabs Inc. or another potential suitor, most likely Cisco Systems. 
``There was good breadth to the market today,'' as gainers outnumbered 
stocks that fell in price, said Phil Roth, chief technical market 
analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``And the reason the market 
is not going to go straight down again is because the breadth is good.'' 
Still, Roth said he expected that early next year the S&AMP;P 500 
would test the lows it hit late this summer. And he suggested a more 
significant test could come before that. ``A lot of people are betting 
that the Federal Reserve Board will cut interest rates again this 
month,'' he said. ``If they don't, that could be a disappointment.''
