As floodwaters receded and communications improved, Central America 
on Tuesday began grasping the ``panorama of death'' in the wake of 
Hurricane Mitch, which killed an estimated 7,000 people and wiped 
whole villages off the map. The greatest devastation was reported 
in Honduras, where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 _ 10 
percent of the population _ were forced to flee their homes after 
last week's storm. Countless more were lacking fresh water, food and 
medicine. Nicaragua's death toll was also high. Official preliminary 
figures showed 1,330 dead and 1,903 missing nationwide. Pope John 
Paul II expressed condolences Tuesday and urged worldwide aid to help 
Central America ``overcome these difficult moments.'' Appealing for 
international help, Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse said 
Monday ``the floods and landslides erased from the map many villages 
and households as well as whole neighborhoods of cities.'' ``We have 
before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin in all of the national 
territory,'' he said in a nationally broadcast speech. ``There are 
corpses everywhere,'' the president said. ``The most conservative 
calculations of the dead are in the thousands, not in the hundreds.'' 
Many parts of Honduras remained cut off almost a week after Mitch 
barreled into the Bay Island of Guanaja with 180 mph (290 kph) winds. 
The storm pounded across the isthmus, dropping up to 25 inches (63 
centimeters) of rain in a six-hour period, before dissipating Monday 
in southern Mexico. Virtually all of Honduras was flooded, from the 
lowland marshes on the Atlantic Coast to the mountains, hills and 
plateaus of the interior. Responding to widespread looting and vandalism, 
Flores Facusse suspended constitutional liberties for two weeks, enabling 
authorities to seize property, detain suspects and conduct unlimited 
searches. People were ordered off the streets between 9 p.m. and 5 
a.m. In Nicaragua, as many as 1,500 people may have died in mudslides 
when the crater lake of the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall 
of mud and debris onto villages below. By late Monday, soldiers had 
found 808 bodies in the mudslide area. Local civil defense officials 
said they planned to go into the disaster area on Tuesday and burn 
bodies to lower the risk of disease. Nicaraguan Defense Minister Pedro 
Joaquin Chamorro said in a telephone interview Monday night that there 
had been another small mudslide on the northern slope of the volcano, 
but there were no apparent casualties. More than 30 houses were destroyed, 
he said. Miguel Angel Ortiz told of waiting three days with his family 
on a hilltop under pouring rain after a wave of mud, trees and rocks 
crashed down on the village of El Ojochal. Running to the top of a 
hill, they were among few in the village lucky enough to get out in 
time. Help never came and they finally walked out Monday because of 
hunger and thirst. ``There was no food, no water and a lot of disease, 
a lot of death,'' said the 33-year-old. ``We needed to get out of 
there.'' Among the hurricane casualties in other Central American 
countries, El Salvador's National Emergency Committee listed 174 dead, 
96 missing and 27,000 homeless. But its own regional affiliate in 
San Miguel province reported 125 dead there alone. Guatemala reported 
100 storm-related deaths. A plane crash Sunday in western Guatemala 
blamed on Mitch's remnants killed 10 U.S. missionaries of the Living 
Water Teaching Mission and their Guatemalan pilot, doctors said. Mexico 
reported one storm-related death. The International Red Cross on Monday 
tripled its appeal for assistance to dlrs 7.4 million. In Washington, 
President Bill Clinton said the U.S. government was providing dlrs 
2 million in food, medicine, water and other relief supplies. U.S. 
military aid flights began arriving Monday in Honduras and were distributing 
aid Tuesday in Nicaragua, where officials said that as of Tuesday 
they would fine people who exploit the crisis to raise prices on basic 
foods Nicaragua's government, however, rejected Cuba's offer of doctors 
but accepted medicine from the Communist island.
