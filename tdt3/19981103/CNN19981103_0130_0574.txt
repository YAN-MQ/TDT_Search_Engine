A genetically engineered drug has won FDA approval to help treat people 
with rheumatoid arthritis. Doctors stress "enbrel" is not a cure, 
but they say it can help some of the hardest-to-treat cases by reducing 
the pain and swelling in joints. Enbrel also appears to have fewer 
side affects than traditional treatments. Patients require injections 
twice a week at a cost of about $220. The drug should be available 
by the end of the week.
