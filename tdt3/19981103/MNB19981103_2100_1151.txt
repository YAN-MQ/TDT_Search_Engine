And vis-A-vis the discussion of the management in the G.O.P., we're 
going to talk to one of them. Trent Lott will be among our guests. 
O.P. not off to have the night they had expected perhaps a few week 
ago. When we come back, John hock Hockenberry looks at what the voters 
are saying. As long as there are Sunday drives in the country, and 
holiday flights home. As long as big cities need bright lights and 
we never get tired of things that go fast and far and high. The people 
of Texaco will go to the ends of the earth to find the energy the 
world needs to keep going. This is it! We're here! ha-ha-ha! Texaco. 
Don't you just love this job? Do you know me? Not yet. I'm starting 
my own business... ...and that's a little scary. For me the card is 
my support system. I rely on it to build my office fill my closets, 
buy business lunches, dinners... and when it all gets to be too much... 
I rely on it to bring me home. It's good to know there's someone there 
when you need them. The difference is membership.
