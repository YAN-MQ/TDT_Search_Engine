Overseas tonight, the U.S. military is wrestling with an unusual threat, 
lazers. Two American helicopter pilots flying peace-keeping missions 
over Bosnia have had their eyes burned after lasers were aimed at 
them from the ground. In response, U.S. has ordered all helicopters 
to wear goggles. But how big a problem is this? We asked ABC's John 
McWethy. At first U.S. military officials believe that the incident 
was caused by nothing more harmful than a laser pointer than this 
one. In fact, in Bosnia, these have become a favorite toy of children, 
even though at close range, they "can" cause damage to an eye. Pilots 
in Bosnia have reported numerous incidents where they have spotted 
a Small laser pointed in their direction. The Pentagon today made 
it clear that the most recent incident was more serious. Our belief 
is that this was an incident involving a laser that was not a toy. 
Perhaps, say officials, it was a laser designator of the type that 
thousands of weapon systems now use to improve accuracy. Many weapons 
from the old Yugoslav military incorporated such devices. Whether 
the intent was hostile or just mischief is unclear, but it does create 
a dilemma for the U.S. The problem is that these lasers can be extremely 
disruptive to American military operations, but not so provocative 
that we would respond with overwhelming force. Soldiers lives are 
not threatened, but their vision could be, giving an adversary that 
wants to irritate and annoy a low cost way to do it. John McWethy, 
ABC News, Pentagon.
