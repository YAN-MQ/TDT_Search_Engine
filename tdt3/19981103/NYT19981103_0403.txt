The town of Greenwich has made the Connecticut Lottery Corp. pay for 
inflicting Powerball mania on the suburb: $93,608.03, to be precise. 
When crowds jammed the suburb's small streets in July to buy a chance 
at a $295 million jackpot, Gov. John Rowland promised to reimburse 
angry town leaders for their troubles. The town selectmen submitted 
a bill for overtime expenses and cleanup costs, and last Friday they 
received their check. Connecticut participates with 18 other states 
and the District of Columbia in the Powerball lottery game. Since 
New York and New Jersey do not, residents of those states streamed 
into Connecticut in July when the jackpot reached record levels. And 
instead of driving up to New Canaan or Stamford where there were no 
lines, the visitors hopped off at the first Turnpike exit and the 
first train stop in Connecticut. The streets quickly became congested. 
The police were forced to pay officers overtime to direct traffic, 
and the Fire Department had to keep more people on the job because 
the crowds made it impossible for other stations to help in emergencies, 
Fire Chief Mike Peuterbaugh said. Tom R. Ragland, first selectman, 
said it took 25 minutes for a fire truck to drive three-fourths of 
a mile to respond to a fire at a gas station selling Powerball tickets. 
``The station could have blown up and no one got out of line,'' Ragland 
said. ``And the machines there were down. That's why I call it a frenzy.'' 
The town will be reimbursed $74,034.68 for police overtime, $9,531.39 
for Fire Department overtime, $9,306.89 for the Department of Public 
Works' cleanup efforts and line control and $735.07 for the ambulance 
service. The reimbursement will come from the money the state lottery 
usually contributes to the state general fund, said Missy Riordan, 
the lottery spokeswoman. During its last fiscal year the Connecticut 
lottery earned $264.2 million. During the height of the July frenzy, 
some Greenwich residents pressured retailers to stop selling lottery 
tickets. Three stores that sold lottery tickets this spring and summer 
have dropped the game, Mrs. Riordan said. ''We lost thousands of dollars 
of business and sales because of the chaos,'' said John J. Laverty, 
assistant manager of the Food Emporium, one of the stores that dropped 
the game. But 25 Greenwich stores still sell the tickets, and state 
lottery officials have a plan to ease the burden if Powerball mania 
strikes again. Lottery officials are creating a brochure to distribute 
at Grand Central Terminal to encourage New York and New Jersey buyers 
to go to other towns besides Greenwich. Mrs. Riordan said that when 
the jackpot gets high enough, they will push buyers to other towns. 
But Ragland dismissed such plans as mere public relations. ``When 
I pick up the phone I want to know they will cooperate and pull the 
plug on Powerball in Greenwich,'' he said.
