of opera. World renowned tenor, Placido Domingo, is to take over as 
artistic director and co-manager of a Los Angeles, California opera 
in June 2000. Domingo, of course, is a member of the famous Three 
Tenors. He will be replacing Peter Hemmings, who is retiring. The 
57-year-old Domingo is currently the Los Angeles' Operas artistic 
adviser and principal guest conductor. He says he will continue his 
singing and conducting career and his duties with the Washington Opera
