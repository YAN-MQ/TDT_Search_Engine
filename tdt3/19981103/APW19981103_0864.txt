With floodwaters receding and communications improving, rescuers struggled 
Tuesday to reach thousands cut off by Hurricane Mitch, fearing that 
hunger could add to an estimated 7,000 people already dead in Central 
America. The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, where an estimated 
5,000 people died and 600,000 _ 10 percent of the population _ were 
forced to flee their homes after last week's storm. Countless more 
were lacking fresh water, food and medicine from Mexico and Guatemala 
to El Salvador and Nicaragua, where a mudslide may have swallowed 
hundreds of villagers. ``The floods and landslides erased from the 
map many villages and households as well as whole neighborhoods of 
cities,'' President Carlos Flores Facusse said, appealing for international 
help in a speech broadcast throughout Honduras on Monday. ``There 
are corpses everywhere, victims of landslides or of the waters.'' 
Responding to widespread looting and vandalism, Flores Facusse suspended 
constitutional liberties for two weeks and imposed a curfew. With 
roads and bridges destroyed throughout the nation, the head of Honduras' 
air force, Col. Alfredo San Martin, said Tuesday that the country 
has gasoline for only about a week. If fuel cannot be distributed, 
aid shipments to regions already short of food could be stalled, he 
said. The International Red Cross tripled its appeal for assistance 
to dlrs 7.4 million Monday. The U.S. government was considering ways 
to expand the dlrs 3.5 million in emergency aid it was providing to 
the region, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Tuesday. U.S. military 
aid flights began arriving Monday in Honduras and U.S. Blackhawk helicopters 
started distributing aid Tuesday in Nicaragua, where officials said 
that they would fine people raised prices on basic foods. Pope John 
Paul II expressed his condolences Tuesday and urged worldwide aid 
to help Central America ``overcome these difficult moments.'' Many 
areas were still cut off almost a week after Mitch barreled in with 
180 mph (290 kph) winds. The storm pounded the Central American isthmus, 
dropping up to 25 inches (63 centimeters) of rain in a six-hour period, 
before dissipating Monday in southern Mexico. El Salvador's National 
Emergency Committee listed 222 dead, 135 missing and 50,000 homeless. 
Guatemala reported 100 storm-related deaths. Mexico reported one. 
Nicaragua's official preliminary figures showed 1,330 dead and 1,903 
missing nationwide. As many as 1,500 Nicaraguans may have died in 
mudslides when the crater lake of the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending 
a wall of mud and debris sliding down onto villages below. By late 
Monday, soldiers had found 808 bodies. Local civil defense officials 
said they planned to burn bodies on Tuesday to cut the risk of disease. 
Nicaraguan Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said in a telephone 
interview Monday night that there had been another small mudslide 
on the northern slope of the volcano, but there were no apparent casualties. 
About 34 houses were destroyed, he said.
