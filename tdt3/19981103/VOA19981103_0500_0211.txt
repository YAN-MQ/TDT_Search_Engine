Defense Secretary William Cohen has begun a trip to Europe and the 
Middle East to consult with U.S. allies on the Iraqi situation. The 
U.N. Security Council will meet later today to discuss a resolution 
condemning Iraq. However, it is unclear whether the resolution includes 
sanctioning a military strike. Iraq, for its part, contends that by 
blocking its efforts to win a formal review of the U.N. sanctions 
imposed after the Gulf War, the United States forced it to stop cooperating 
with the U.N. inspectors.
