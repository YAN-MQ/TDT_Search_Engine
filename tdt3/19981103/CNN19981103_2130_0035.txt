The Senate race in Illinois is still too close to call, with democratic 
incumbent Carol Moseley-Braun in fierce competition with republican 
state senator Peter Fitzgerald. It's also too close to call in Wisconsin, 
where voters are deciding between democratic senator Russ Feingold 
who has taken no pac money, and his republican challenger, representative 
Mark Neumann. So far, the democrats have picked up three Senate seats 
formerly held by republicans with the victories of Schumer in New 
York, Evan bayh in Indiana and John Edwards in North Carolina.
