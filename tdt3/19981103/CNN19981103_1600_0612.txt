Astronauts on board "discovery" flexed the shuttle's 50-foot arm this 
afternoon to retrieve a satellite. Instruments on Spartan, a 3,000-pound 
solar physics laboratory had been studying the sun's outer atmosphere, 
which occasionally sends out a solar wind that disrumts kpluntions 
on earth. The astronauts have also been focusing on experiments that 
could change the way people on earth fight a disease spread by parasites. 
Ann Kellan has more. The tropical rainforest -- home to millions of 
species of plants and animals, many of them still undiscovered by 
humans. Some of the treasures of the rainforest are going for a ride 
on the space shuttle. And the result could be a cure for a devastating 
disease. Chagas disease is a problem mainly in rural areas of Latin 
America, where it kills thousands of people every year and infects 
millions. It's spread by bugs that live in the walls, ceilings or 
floors of poorly constructed houses. The bugs carry a deadly parasite 
that is passed on to people when bug droppings get into their eyes, 
mouth or cuts in the skin. Five years ago, U.S. astronaut Franklin 
Chang Diaz, who was born in Costa rica, had an idea for fighting chagas 
disease. It was based on experiments that he'd been doing on the space 
shuttle and a New approach to drug design. This is a new way in which 
medicines are made. Using the weightless environment in space to create 
a Crystal that gives you the internal structure of any substance that 
you're looking for. The project, called "chagaspace," brings together 
scientists from south and central America and the United States. They 
collect and analyze plants from the rainforest that might be turned 
into drugs against chagas disease. Scientists crystallize compounds 
from the plants, proteins from the parasite, and mixtures of the two. 
Crystals produced in space are often much better formed than earthbound 
crystals because they form without interference from gravity. While 
the biggest hope of the chagaspace researchers is to find a cure for 
chagas disease, they say everyone has gained from this international 
cooperation. Ann Kellan, CNN.
