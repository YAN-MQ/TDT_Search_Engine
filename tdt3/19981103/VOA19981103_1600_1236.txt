Outfielder Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs has gotten the most votes 
of the 1998 Associated Press Major League Baseball All Star Team. 
Sosa, who lost this year's thrilling home run chase with four fewer 
round trippers than St. Louis Cardinal's first baseman Mark McGwire, 
won in the ballot box. The Dominican outfielder picked up 187 votes 
in the nationwide balloting by sports writers and broadcasters. That 
was five more than his St. Louis slugging rival. Only one player from 
the World Series champion New York Yankees made the team. That was 
David Welles, who was voted in as the left-handed starting pitcher.
