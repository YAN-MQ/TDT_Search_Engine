Wildlife rangers and farmers in Australia are considering a plan to 
cull thousands of kangaroos. It could turn out to be the world's largest 
cull of wild animals, but conservationist groups want the killing 
stopped. From Sydney, Michael Pesharp reports. The fate of about four 
million kangaroos hangs in the balance. Farmers say they're a pest 
and should be used for their meat and fur, but conservationists claim 
the whole species has been threatened by a series of annual culls. 
They say hunters take or need the biggest and best animals, leaving 
behind a weakened population more susceptible to disease. There are 
about 20 million kangaroos in Australia. They're hunted by night. 
Their skins are also used for high- quality training shoes. Michael
