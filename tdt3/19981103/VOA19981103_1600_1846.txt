Secretary of State Albright has also intervened in a dispute holding 
up Israeli actions to ratify the new interim peace deal with the Palestinians. 
Ms. Albright phoned Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, after he postponed 
a Cabinet meeting that was supposed to debate the agreement. Mr. Netanyahu 
said the security plan submitted by Israel was not complete. However, 
State Department Spokesman James Rubin says the Palestinians have 
met their responsibilities by submitting a plan to combat terrorism.
