The Pittsburgh steelers aren't ruling all-pro cornerback Carnell lake 
out of Monday's game against green bay, despite a severely sprained 
ankle suffered in Sunday's loss to Tennessee. The steelers now say 
lake has a 50/50 chance of playing. It's not as significant, according 
to Carnell, as the one that he had in 1993 where he missed two games. 
And where he did have a high ankle sprain and he did miss two games. 
You know, really, you know, those are tough to deal with. But it's 
nowhere near as significant, in talking with Carnell this morning, 
as it was then.
