Monday night's 6-2 victory over the Florida Panthers was worth more 
to the New York Islanders than 2 points in the standing. It also made 
them a winning team for the first time in almost a year at 6-5-0. 
``It's kind of a barrier,'' Trevor Linden said of the .500 mark. ``And 
once you break through it, psychologically it's healthy, it's good. 
Once that momentum gets rolling, it's a lot easier to win.'' The Islanders, 
who improved to 4-1 on this homestand, were last above .500 on Nov. 
19, 1997, when they were 9-8-4. The Islanders even moved into a tie 
for first place in the Atlantic Division at 12 points with the Philadelphia 
Flyers (5-4-2). ``It puts a smile on your face,'' Rich Pilon said 
of the Islanders' place atop the division. ``It's nice to get over 
the hump and be in first place for a change.'' The Islanders' offense 
did not waste its chances on Monday night, the defense did not allow 
many and Tommy Salo's goaltending (18 saves) was outstanding. Two 
goals each by Bryan Smolinski and Robert Reichel helped the Islanders 
to their most lopsided victory of the season. The Islanders fell behind 
by 2-1 early in the second period, but bounced back with five straight 
goals. They outshot Florida by 29-20. Smolinski opened the scoring 
with a power-play goal 1 minute 11 seconds into the game, one-timing 
the puck past Florida goalie Sean Burke from the middle of the right 
circle. Florida's Rob Niedermayer tied the score at 1-1 with a power-play 
goal at 5:36. Panthers defenseman Robert Svehla made a cross-ice pass, 
but the puck deflected off Niedermayer's skate and into the Islanders' 
net. Salo immediately skated toward the referee, Stephen Walkom, to 
complain. After a review, the goal was allowed. After Florida went 
ahead, 2-1, on Bill Lindsay's goal at 2:41, the Islanders scored three 
straight goals in the second period. Smolinski tapped in a rebound, 
Reichel scored on a wraparound and Linden fired one in with 52 seconds 
left. Reichel's goal was surely the Islanders' strangest this season. 
Reichel was coming out of the penalty box, where he had been sent 
for unsportsmanlike conduct, just as Linden cleared the puck. Burke, 
unaware of Reichel, left the crease to stop the puck. Reichel easily 
stole it from the Florida goalie, skated around the goal and scored. 
Reichel tapped in a rebound at 1:21 of the third period to give the 
Islanders a 5-2 lead. Claude Lapointe turned the game into a rout, 
scoring the Islanders' sixth goal on the power play at 10:30 of the 
third period.
