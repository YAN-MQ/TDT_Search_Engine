Americans are going to the polls to choose a new House of Representatives 
and one-third of the Senate, 36 state governors, and hundreds of local 
officials. President Clinton, whose political future may hang in the 
balance in today's election, has made an appeal for a big turnout. 
VOA's David Gullis reports from the White House. Mr. Clinton has said 
the election is not a referendum on himself or his conduct and the 
Monica Lewinsky affair, but aides concede that the outcome could affect 
the momentum of impeachment efforts in Congress. A president's party 
traditionally loses seats in Congress in midterm elections. If the 
Democrats' losses are minimal, it's felt here it make take some of 
the steam out of the effort to unseat Mr. Clinton. The president has 
focused on getting key party constituent groups, especially black 
and Hispanic voters, to go to the polls. In a photo session at an 
economic meeting here, Mr. Clinton made one last get-out-the-vote 
appeal. I voted. I presume everybody here has already voted or is 
about to. And my own message today is that every American who has 
not yet made the decision to go and vote should do so. Mr. Clinton, 
who cast an absentee ballot in his home state of Arkansas, plans to 
watch election results on television here with his wife and friends. 
David Gullis, VOA News, the White House. Most analysts are predicting 
modest gains by Republicans in both the House and the Senate where 
the party already holds slim majorities.
