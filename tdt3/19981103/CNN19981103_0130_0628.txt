John Glenn and the space shuttle "discovery" crew spent several hours 
relaxing Monday. At least one work break is scheduled on all shuttle 
flights to prevent crew fatigue. Tony Clark looks at how they filled 
the time. It was a relatively relaxing day on board the shuttle "Discovery." 
The crew was given several hours of free time so they could break 
from their busy schedule, have private conferences with family members 
and enjoy the view from 340 miles above earth. The free time is really 
critical to making the crew's health stay high for the entire flight. 
On the shuttle's mid deck, the Japanese astronaut showed why John 
glenn calls her miss nuclear energy as she worked out on the shuttle's 
exercise bicycle. And an agile Pedro duque showed how much fun weightlessness 
can be. Duque, the first Spanish shuttle astronaut received congratulations 
from spain's minister of education Monday. Buenos tardes, Pedro. And 
in a long-distance exchange with students in Madrid, he said he feels 
fortunate to have been selected to fly on "discovery." While the astronauts 
took it easy, the Spartan satellite they deployed over the weekend 
was sending back near real-time solar images. For the first time in 
the Spartan program's history, we're able to share and look at this 
data real-time during the flight. We actually have these images out 
on the Internet being shared both with the scientific community and 
wider public audience. NASA decided to send "discovery's" crew to 
bed early Monday so they could be rested up for Tuesday's retrieval 
of the Spartan satellite. But for John Glenn, even going to sleep 
means suiting up for another experiment. Yes, I have 21 different 
leads, I believe coming off the body, different parameters that are 
being measured. It makes it -- a box around your middle to record 
all this on. Despite being all wired up, the 77-year-old Glenn told 
CNN's walter cronkite he's getting a good night's rest. Tony Clark,
