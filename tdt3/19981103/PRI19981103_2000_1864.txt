Honduras has confirmed that 5,000 people have been killed after the 
flooding caused by Hurricane Mitch. Another 11,000 are still missing. 
In neighboring Nicaragua, 2,000 people are feared dead in mudslides. 
In many areas, people are now facing acute food shortages and the 
danger of disease. Nicaraguan Ambassador to Britain, Nora Kamples- 
DeLankas. Most of the areas that had been affected are inaccessible 
completely, so there are many people who are dying because we can't 
reach them, and already we have a lot of cholera in some of the places 
that had been used for refugees. You have more than 400,000 people 
homeless, and you're talking about 10% of the population of Nicaragua. 
Nicaraguan Ambassador to Britain, Nora Kamples-DeLankes.
