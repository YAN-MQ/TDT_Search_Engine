It looks like nude pictures of Dr. Laura Schlessinger will stay on 
the internet. A federal judge in California says there have been at 
least 14,000 hits to the Internet entertainment group's web site, 
making it impossible to order a recall. The pictures were taken decades 
ago by a man who claims to have had an affair with Schlessinger. She 
sued when the pictures resurfaced on the web last week. Dr. Laura 
is heard on radio stations nationwide, dispensing advice on morality 
and family relationships.
