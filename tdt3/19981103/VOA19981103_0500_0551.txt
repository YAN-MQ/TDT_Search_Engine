New artillery attacks are being reported in Kashmir along the line 
that separates Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of the disputed 
Himalayan region. Pakistan says Indian artillery fire late Monday 
wounded three people and damaged more than 100 shops in the town Ajura. 
And Indian police officials say Pakistani artillery shells killed 
two civilians and injured ten other people including two soldiers. 
On Thursday, the two sides are scheduled to begin nine days of talks 
in New Delhi aimed at diffusing tensions between the two rivals and 
working toward resolving a decade-long territorial dispute over Kashmir.
