President Clinton says Iraq's refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons 
inspectors is completely unacceptable. He met Monday with his national 
security team to discuss Baghdad's latest defiance. Iraq announced 
Saturday that it will no longer allow inspectors access to suspected 
weapons sites. The parliament endorsed that decision Monday, calling 
the U.N. team "A threat to Iraqi security." Inspection commission 
chairman Richard Butler says this latest confrontation is the most 
serious so far, but he has no intention of backing down. I deeply 
regret that they have actually made this happen. And I hope that the 
council will design the steps required to bring this to and end. We 
are in Baghdad now, I'm not withdrawing our people. We are ready and 
able to do this work quickly and honestly but we need their cooperation. 
And I hope that gets restored quite soon. President Clinton says he'll 
be consulting with U.S. allies in the days ahead to determine a response.
