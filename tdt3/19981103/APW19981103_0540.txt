The French Foreign Ministry said Tuesday a date has not yet been set 
for the visit of Iranian President Mohamed Khatami. ``The exact dates 
are currently under study,'' said ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret, 
responding to a Monday report in the newspaper Le Monde that Khatami 
would visit France in February. Le Monde cited Iranian Ambassador 
Ali-Reza Moayeri. Gazeau-Secret expressed France's pleasure that Khatami 
has accepted the invitation to visit France, but added that the date 
has not yet been decided upon. Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine extended 
an official invitation to Khatami during his visit to Tehran in August. 
Vedrine's was the highest level French visit to Iran in seven years. 
It would be Khatami's first trip to a European nation since taking 
office in August 1997. The Iranian leader has expressed the wish to 
improve relations with the West, particularly the European Union.
