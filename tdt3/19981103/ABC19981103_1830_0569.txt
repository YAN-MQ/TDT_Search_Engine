More evidence of the ternl damage done by the tropical storm Mitch. 
Ron Claiborne reported for us where entire villages were buried by 
mudslides. Tonight we know the storm's worst effects have been felt 
in neighboring honduras. More than 5,000 lives lost. The president 
of Honduras is not exaggerating when he says before us we have a panorama 
of death, December lags and ruin. ABC's Ron Claiborne is there again. 
From the air, you can see the vastness, the magnitude of what has 
happened, most of this country has been destroyed. Even in the capital 
city, tegucigalpa, the damage is everywhere. Here rescue workers were 
struggling frantically to free people still trapped in debris. There 
are an estimated 1 million homeless people in this country of 6 million. 
Even more, 70% of the infrastructures, schools, hospitals, rootds 
and bridges have been destroyed. It will be years before this country 
recovers from this disaster. And as bad as it is here, it's even worse 
outside the capital. Officials are racing against a spread of hunger 
and water-born disease, trying to reach the hundreds of thousands 
of people who are still isolated. Ron Claiborne, ABC News, tegucigalpa, 
Honduras.
