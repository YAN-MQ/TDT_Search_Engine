Rumors of Sean Connery's return have James bond fans shaken and stirred. 
Published reports in London say sony pictures is meeting with Connery 
to discuss forming a studio in Scotland. If the deal goes through, 
the studio would reportedly remake the 1965 bond classic "thunderball" 
with Connery again starring as the legendary 007. Connery's last bond 
film was 1983's "never say never again."
