Glenn and the rest of the crew were awakened by the sound of electric 
guitars and pounding Drums. "The house is a rockin'" by Stevie Ray 
Vaughn was especially chosen for astronaut Stephen Robinson. The house 
is a rockin' don't bother to come on in. Robinson is the shuttle's 
robot arm operator. He will grapple and retrieve the $9 million Spartan 
satellite today. The satellite was released two days ago to study
