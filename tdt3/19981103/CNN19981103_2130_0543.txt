The British former au pair convicted of killing a baby in her care 
is asking for permission to sell her story. An attorney for Louise 
Woodward is asking a federal judge to set aside an injunction that 
requires Woodward to notify an American judge before selling her story. 
It's unclear if she has any deals in the works. An attorney for the 
parents of Matthew Eappen says he will file an opposition to the motion.
