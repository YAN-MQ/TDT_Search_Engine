Formula One champion Mika Hakkinen says his near-fatal crash three 
years ago only reinforced his love for the dangerous sport. Hakkinen, 
who won Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix to claim his first series championship, 
met Tuesday with McLaren staff members in the team factory south of 
London. ``After the crash I did not think about driving for a while,'' 
said the 30-year-old Finn, who suffered severe head injuries in the 
crash while practicing for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. ``I realized 
there were other things in my life.'' ``It helped give me the opportunity 
to spend time with family and friends. Up until then I had been so 
busy in my racing career.'' Hakkinen, who lapsed into a coma after 
the crash but returned to the track in four months, said the time 
in the hospital made him appreciate the sport. ``It was a hard way 
to learn things like that. I don't recommend it,'' he said. ``But 
when I first went to test in the south of France after the crash I 
realized I still loved it. This was the sport I wanted to do.''
