An official report of riots that rocked Indonesia last May says the 
army may have started them deliberately. Investigators uncovered evidence 
army units instigated unrest to justify declaring emergency powers 
during the fall of former President Suharto. Jonathan Head reports. 
Team Chairman, Mazuki Diresman, says their investigations had concluded 
that the May riots were a deliberate attempt by units of the armed 
forces to create a crisis in order to justify the declaration of emergency 
powers. In other words, something very close to a coup d'etat. He 
said he couldn't say whether this was a move in support of or against 
Mr. Suharto. That comment at least will satisfy those who always believed 
that the May riots were the result of a conspiracy within the political 
and military elite. Jonathan Head, BBC News, Jakarta.
