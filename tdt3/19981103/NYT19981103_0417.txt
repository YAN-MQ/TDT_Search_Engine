Jerry L. Schwartz, a journeyman journalist who was equally comfortable 
writing about baseball and Beethoven, died on Sunday at Northside 
Hospital in Atlanta. He was 51 and lived in Atlanta. The cause was 
complications from leukemia, said Jonathan Wax, a family friend. As 
the founder of a one-person freelance writing business called The 
Atlanta Bureau, Schwartz wrote and contributed hundreds of articles 
to news organizations including The New York Times, Reuters and The 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution. A native of Memphis, he earned a degree 
in journalism from the University of Missouri in 1969 before joining 
the staff of The Miami Herald and then of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
He is survived by his wife, Carolyn Harmon Schwartz, the press secretary 
to former President Jimmy Carter and the director of public information 
for the Carter Center; a daughter, Elizabeth Rose Schwartz, of Atlanta; 
a son, Max David Schwartz, of Atlanta; his mother, Mildred Schwartz, 
of Memphis; and a sister, Vivian K. Poole, of Memphis.
