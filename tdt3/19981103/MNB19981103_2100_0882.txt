New numbers with governor races. Jane Hull, the incumbent beating 
the 39-year-old democratic challenger Paul johnson. Hull will remain 
in office there. Wisconsin, as he calls himself in the regional accent, 
Tommy Thompson will be going back to office. The incumbent G.O.P. 
governor in Wisconsin. And in Georgia, this was an open seat. Popular 
democrat Zell Miller was term limited and could not run again. Roy 
Barnes, the democrat has kept that in democratic hands. Guy millner, 
the republican. This had been a tight one and toss-up down to the 
wire tonight. So so far tonight some big ones breaking for the republicans 
against the democrats. Ie, Lauch Faircloth going down in North Carolina. 
Al D'Amato in New York. And there's more. Some statehouses changing 
hands.
