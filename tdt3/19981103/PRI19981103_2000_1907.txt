Senior Palestinian negotiator, Sahib Arokat, is calling on Washington 
to force Israel to ratify the peace agreement signed at the Wye Plantation 
Summit last month. The deal was due to have come into force on Monday, 
but Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, delayed a cabinet leader called 
to consider the deal. He says the Palestinians have not provided all 
necessary security guarantees.
