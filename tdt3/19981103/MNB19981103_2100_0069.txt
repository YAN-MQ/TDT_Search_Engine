This is a big one tonight for the democratic party. A pickup of a 
Senate seat in New York. In Arizona, as expected, one half of McCain-Feingold, 
John McCain, the naval aviator shot down in the Vietnam war, a war 
hero, a prisoner of war for many years. A man many are mentioning 
for possible national politics. John McCain holds on to his Senate 
seat from the state of Arizona. Ben nighthorse Campbell, also a decorated 
military veteran and former 1964 U.S. Olympic team captain, carried 
the American flag during the opening ceremonies. Air force veteran 
in Korea. Ben nighthorse Campbell, G.O.P. hangs on to one. And in 
Louisiana, Bill Clinton may not have any better friend in the U.S. 
senate than this man, John breaux, moderate, southern democrat. He 
is going to go back to the Senate for Louisiana. Democrats Hang on 
to that one. North Dakota, another incumbent hangs on, remember tonight 
all the UPS and downs. When the night is over, 97% of the incumbents 
nationwide are expected to hang on to their seats when all the shouting 
is over. Byron Dorgan will be going back to the Senate representing 
North Dakota. Tom Daschle, no surprise here. The minority leader in 
the U.S. Senate. Is going back to the Senate. An easy victory over 
the republican challenger Ron Schmidt in South Dakota. North Carolina, 
the other big one on the east coast tonight as we have announced already 
in our last half-hour, Lauch Faircloth the conservative republican 
senator being turned away after one term in favor of the young real 
estate lawyer, John Edwards, the democrat, as reported live from his 
headquarters not long ago. Some governors' races and some hot ones, 
Bill janklow, the incumbent republican is being returned to office 
in South Dakota. In New York, kind of a splintered opposition ticket 
against him. The popular upstate, conservative republican, George 
pataki, governor of New York, who attracted some strange bedfellows 
in his support is being returned to office. The governor's mansion, 
the governor's office in Albany, New York.
