Darko Kovacevic scored twice to lead Real Sociedad to a 3-0 drubbing 
of Dynamo Moscow on Tuesday and advance his team to the third round 
of the UEFA Cup. The aggregate score was 6-2 since Real beat Dynamo 
3-2 in Moscow two weeks ago in the first leg of the second round. 
On Tuesday the two sides played a scoreless first half under driving 
rain in Anoeta stadium in this seaside city in the Spanish Basque 
country. Kovacevic broke the ice in the 56th minute with a crisp header 
after a corner kick from Francisco Jose de Pedro. Five minutes later 
Ricardo Sa Pinto missed with a blazing left-footed shot from just 
outside the area. But in the 70th minute Oscar de Paula stole the 
ball on an error by the Russian defense and dribbled past goalie Dmitry 
Tyapushkin, who slid in a puddle of water in a vain attempt to stop 
the shot, making the score 2-0. Kovacevic, who came up with two goals 
in Moscow as well, scored again in the 75th minute as Sa Pinto passed 
him the ball at midfield and the Croat ran in solo, then arced the 
ball above Tyapushkin's head when the Russian came out to meet him. 
It was Kovacevic's fifth goal in UEFA Cup play this year.
