Are there rules of thumb to guide parents checking a baby sitter's 
references? How does one get a preschooler to clean her room? Are 
there ways to make a new teen-age driver safer? Parents by the thousands, 
as well as teachers, school administrators and community workers, 
are finding expert advice on these and almost any other question on 
the National Parent Information Network, available on the Internet, 
and through a toll-free telephone call. The project, at the University 
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is being financed by the federal 
Department of Education. Mostly, the parents ask the kind of questions 
that they might have posed to a trusted neighbor or family member 
a generation or two ago. Parents of babies and toddlers ask most frequently 
about getting their children to sleep. After that, the biggest issue 
is what to do about hitting and biting. Toilet training and bed-wetting 
come close behind. Other questions asked frequently: When should my 
child walk? When should my child talk? How many words should he speak 
at age 2 or 3? When should my child read? In September, the network 
had 250,000 visits to its Web site (www.npin.org), and staff members 
expect the total this year to reach 2 million. Telephone calls, answered 
by staff members from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern standard time at (800) 
583-4135, are running at 1,000 a month. The Parent Information Network 
operates primarily as an information service, a latter-day cooperative 
extension for family issues. ``We are not a hot line,'' said Dr. Anne 
S. Robertson, director of the network. ``But if people call in a crisis 
situation, we can refer them.'' The staff members, who include researchers 
with backgrounds in early childhood, health care, day care, and special 
education, link callers with expert advice, either online or available 
through a library or community organizations. ``We've had questions 
from parents who know they are about to be homeless,'' said Dr. Amy 
Aidman, a staff member. In Illinois, Dr. Aidman said, such parents 
are referred to a toll-free number at the state Board of Education 
where that issue is handled. Dr. Robertson remembered a tearful call 
from a woman in a Southern state who had just been told that her daughter, 
who had an attention deficit disorder, was being retained in kindergarten. 
School officials had told the mother _ incorrectly, as it turned out 
_ that she could not request federally financed special education 
assistance until her child reached the fourth grade. Dr. Robertson 
got the name of someone in the woman's home state who helped her. 
Sometimes, callers are hesitant about stating their problem. Once, 
a woman called with what she said was a question about diapering her 
baby. ``I got on the phone when the staff realized the woman wasn't 
accepting our answers,'' Dr. Robertson said. ``She had just moved 
to California and was living in a trailer park. She had a new baby.'' 
Dr. Robertson found out that the woman had just been told she might 
have seizures, and that she had no health insurance. ``I told her 
we could find a health care visitor willing to home visit,'' she said. 
``We did some research and we gave her the name and number.'' The 
National Parents Information Network also has a free online service 
in which subscribing parents can exchange advice and opinions. Staff 
members monitor the electronic discussions to make sure the remarks 
do not get too intemperate. ``Breast-feeding is a big topic,'' Dr. 
Robertson said of the discussions. ``Some people think if you don't 
beast-feed, you deny nutrition to your child. But others say they 
can't breast-feed. The discussion got heated, and it was not part 
of our `netiquette.' So we asked people if they wanted to contribute 
to an article on the subject.'' The resulting article, edited by a 
the network's researcher, appears on the Web site. The staff draws 
on the largest education database in the world, established by the 
Educational Resources Information Service, a federally financed and 
managed network. The service draws information from more than 850,000 
records of journal articles, research reports, curriculum and teaching 
guides, conference papers and books. The material is made available 
by 16 clearinghouses on separate education topics that collect, abstract 
and index information about education, answer requests for information 
and produce special publications. The telephone answering component 
of the network was developed in 1992 as a pilot project at the service's 
Clearinghouse on Information and Technology, at Syracuse University. 
The University of Illinois runs the Clearinghouse on Elementary and 
Early Childhood Education. The advice is usually down to earth. A 
preschooler will straighten up her room if the expectations are realistic, 
said Dawn Ramsburg, a network research assistant. Her advice included: 
Make the bed up with a comforter; do not ask her to flatten sheets. 
Store toys on shelves instead of a box. On the question of teen-age 
driving, the network cites Tom Deats, a Texas police officer who set 
up a national teen-age safe driving program, 4MYTEEN. On the question 
of checking references for a baby sitter, Dr. Jeanne Beckman, a licensed 
clinical psychologist who practices in Winnetka, Ill., wrote: ``I 
am suspicious of any sitter who can only give names of people for 
whom they sat only one time, or for whom they have sat only recently.'' 
Tackling what to do if an unsatisfactory baby sitter uses you as a 
reference, she wrote: ``I feel you have a responsibility to somehow 
convey the difficulty, even if all you say is, `Yes, she sat for me, 
but I cannot give you any more information.' That kind of statement 
actually conveys lots of information.'' CLEARINGHOUSES AND TOPICS
