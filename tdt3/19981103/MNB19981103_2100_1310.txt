Score one for President Clinton on that strategic move. Our exit polls 
show black votes have been crucial to democratic successes in a number 
of key Senate races. Tonight in New York, where Charles Schumer beat 
Alfonse D'Amato decisively, he had 85% of black voters on his side. 
In South Carolina, where earnest Hollings held on to his seat with 
92% of the black vote. In Illinois, where Carol Moseley Braun is hanging 
in there thanks to votes from a whopping 97% of her fellow blacks. 
The black vote becomes more important when you realize Schumer and 
Hollings lost the majority white vote to their republican opponents. 
And the same dynamic also played out in North Carolina where black 
voters gave democrat John Edwards his margin of victory over Lauch 
Faircloth. Let's talk, tactically this was an extraordinary move for 
Bill Clinton. He essentially played a Ralph Reed card against the 
republicans in the sense when there is a low voter turnout in an off-year 
election small number of people going in high percentages are decisive. 
Representive of 1994. This time just the opposite. Nothing concentrates 
the mind of the possibility of a hanging. Bill Clinton went to the 
core of the democratic party and asked for their support and they 
appreciated his asking. Very interesting Wednesday morning quarterbacking.
