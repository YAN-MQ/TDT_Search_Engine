Piet Hein Geeris scored twice and the Netherlands scored four times 
in the second half to rout South Korea 5-0 on Tuesday for its third 
victory in as many games and keep it on top of the Champions Trophy 
standings. The result left the world and Olympic champs as the only 
unbeaten and untied team after three rounds of the six-nation event. 
It moved four points ahead of second-placed Australia (1-2-0), which 
was held to a 4-4 draw earlier Tuesday. South Korea fell to 1-1-1, 
four points and fourth place, just behind Spain on goal difference. 
Teun de Nooijer, Remco van Wijk and Marten Eikelboom also scored for 
the Netherlands, which has outscored its opponents 12-4. South Korea 
looked strong in the opening minutes but quickly folded. Forwards 
Kim Jeong Kui and captain Park Shin Heun were smartly checked by a 
strong Dutch defense. The Netherlands jumped ahead in the 30th minute 
when Jeroen Delmee crossed from right to Hein Geeris, who pushed the 
ball in the empty net. Geeris scored again six minutes into the second 
half, blasting a shot from the top of the striking circle past South 
Korean keeper Ku Jin Soo. Holland's Van Wijk scored off a 48th minute 
short corner, while Eikelboom completed the tally with a brilliant 
goal in the 69th minute.
