Surrounding himself with supporters in his home village who call him 
``father,'' Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo announced Tuesday that he would 
seek the presidency of Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. Obasanjo, 
61, who was president from 1976 to 1979 and remains the only military 
ruler in this country to have given up power to a civilian government, 
was immediately seen by many Nigerians as the front-runner in the 
elections set for February. Nigeria's military government has pledged 
to hand over power to a civilian president on May 29. Obasanjo emerged 
from three years in prison in June shortly after the death of the 
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. Obasanjo comes from the Yoruba of the south 
and has strong ties to the northern Hausa and Fulani, who dominate 
the military. He presented himself as the man capable of holding together 
a country whose regional, ethnic and religious fissures have widened 
in recent months with the death of Abacha; the death of Moshood K.O. 
Abiola, Nigeria's most famous opposition figure; and unrest in the 
oil-producing Niger Delta. ``Every Nigerian has a stake in the survival 
and prosperity of the country,'' Obasanjo said at a news conference 
that was attended by politicians from all over the country and began 
with Christian and Muslim prayers. ``This stake should be recognized. 
No section or group should be made to feel disenfranchised or alienated.'' 
Obasanjo gained respect inside and outside Nigeria for handing over 
power in 1979 to a civilian government. That administration was ousted 
in a military coup a few years later. In 1995, Obasanjo was sentenced 
to 15 years in prison for an abortive coup against Abacha, whose ruinous 
and ruthless rule over Nigeria turned it into an international pariah. 
Obasanjo was freed after Abacha's death by Nigeria's current president, 
Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar. Abubakar, who has begun a series of political 
and economic reforms, has said he does not intend to run. After attending 
a book party in Lagos Tuesday morning, Obasanjo traveled north to 
his farm here, a 25-mile trip made longer by the frequent mile-long 
lines at gas stations. The general arrived an hour late. He was driven 
into his estate on a dirt road, past banana plants, and was led out 
of his car and carried onto a stage. ``Our father, Obasanjo, should 
be the president of this country,'' said Kola Olanrewaju, 20, as he 
stood in the crowd. ``He has been very good to us, and we all know 
what he can do. We are all anxious about the future.'' Oluwole Abdullahi, 
32, said: ``Obasanjo, we have known him to be a very good father. 
He has served in government before. So I think he is the only one 
in this country with the experience and credibility to take us to 
the promised land.'' ``We know that he will get the respect of Great 
Britain and the United States,'' Abdullahi added. ``We know that he 
will be credible to the other people in the country _ to all the groups. 
Of course, some people may have grudges against him, but people will 
forget.'' The resentment is from some of the general's fellow Yoruba 
who believe that he is too close to the Muslim Hausa and Fulani of 
the north, and that in the close 1979 elections, he helped deliver 
victory to a northerner over a southerner. What is more, many Yoruba 
fault him for not having strongly supported Abiola, a Yoruba who had 
converted to Islam. ``He's accepted by the international community 
for having given up power and he's a military man, so he satisfies 
the North,'' said Olisa Agbakoba, a prominent human-rights lawyer 
in Lagos and a member of Nigeria's third-largest ethnic group, the 
Ibo, in the south. ``The fundamental problem is that he does not satisfy 
his own people in the south.'' Obasanjo's announcement Tuesday had 
been expected since he joined the People's Democratic Party last week. 
The party is one of nine that recently qualified to present candidates 
in local election scheduled for next month, as well as statewide and 
presidential elections set for January and February, respectively.
