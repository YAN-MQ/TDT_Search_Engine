This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News" weather 
forecast for Wednesday. Rain showers will move off the southeast coast, 
but we'll continue to see showers and thunderstorms across Florida 
as moisture from the remnants of mitch moves towards that region. 
We'll also see rain showers stretched from Texas along the east slopes 
of the Rockies, some of that in the higher elevations will be snow. 
There's also more rain in the forecast across the northwest with some 
mountain snow. High temperatures on Wednesday will be just in the 
30s from the northern plains to northern New England. You can find 
60s and 70s, but they'll be down far in the south. Looking ahead to 
Thursday, look for rain in the northwest with cool temperatures over 
the northern plains. For Friday, a mix of rain and snow around the 
Great Lakes, rain and mountain snow through the northwest with showers 
into Texas. On Saturday, much of the country will see some rain showers 
or possibly snow showers. Highs from the northern Rockies into the 
Great Lakes will be just in the 30s. Don't forget, you can find four-day 
forecasts for 7,200 cities at CNN.com.
