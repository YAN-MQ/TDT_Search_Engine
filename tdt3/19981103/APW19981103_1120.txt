Calling Hurricane Mitch the worst natural disaster to hit Central 
America this century, U.N. ambassadors from five nations appealed 
Tuesday for international help to feed and clothe the survivors and 
bury the dead. Rebuilding the hardest-hit countries _ Honduras and 
Nicaragua _ will take many years and billions of dollars. But with 
victims still clinging to trees and rooftops, the ambassadors said 
the region's top priority is emergency assistance. Central Americans 
struggled Tuesday to reach thousands of people who remained stranded 
almost a week after Mitch barreled into the Bay Island of Guanaja 
with 180 mph (290 kph) winds. The storm pounded the isthmus, dropping 
up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain in a six-hour period, before 
dissipating Monday in southern Mexico. The storm and its aftermath 
has killed more than 7,000 people, most in Honduras and Nicaragua, 
and thousands remained stranded or in shelters. Honduran Ambassador 
Hugo Noe-Pino _ flanked by envoys from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala 
and Costa Rica _ said Tuesday that the killer storm had put the country's 
development efforts back by at least 30 years. In Honduras, 75 bridges 
have collapsed, 70 percent of the country's infrastructure has been 
damaged and 70 percent of its gross domestic product has been lost, 
Noe-Pino said. ``The need of food, medicine, clothes and other basic 
things is very, very important,'' he said. ``The government is at 
this moment unable by itself to assist all the people.'' The Red Cross 
has estimated that Honduras needs about dlrs 10 million in immediate 
assistance, he said, and overall damages could reach at least dlrs 
2 billion. Noe-Pino said the two major banana companies in Honduras 
have talked about a loss of dlrs 850 million. Coffee and melon export 
crops also have been lost _ and the loss of domestic food crops is 
so large that he predicted very serious food shortages. Nicaraguan 
Ambassador Alfonso Ortega Urbina said 70 percent of his country's 
infrastructure has been destroyed, including more than 40 bridges. 
``The situation of the people is tragic. They don't have food. They 
don't have shelters. They don't have clothes. So they're desperately 
in need of help,'' he said. ``We will not have crops for the next 
six months so there will be hunger.'' The Red Cross and countries 
including the United States, Britain, Spain and Norway have provided 
some aid to the region, but Nicaragua desperately needs more assistance, 
he said. Ortega Urbina said the country needs dlrs 15 million to dlrs 
20 million immediately for emergency aid to victims and to bury the 
dead and get rid of thousands of animals killed in the hurricane. 
Nicaragua also will not be able to pay the service on its current 
debt of dlrs 1 billion, the ambassador said, blaming the storm and 
urging international institutions and governments to help the country's 
economy in this time of crisis. The ambassadors of El Salvador, Guatemala 
and Costa Rica also appealed for assistance. The five ambassadors 
later met with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The U.N. General 
Assembly appealed Monday for speedy relief to help victims on Hurricane 
Mitch. The U.N. World Food announced Tuesday that it had distributed 
over 100,000 tons of food previously earmarked for development projects 
in Nicaragua and was distributing food in Honduras. UNICEF said it 
had provided dlrs 20,000 worth of medicine to Nicaragua and was shipping 
500,000 sachets of oral rehydration salts, used in cases of diarrhea 
and cholera. In Honduras, UNICEF said it was providing food, drugs 
and blankets for several thousand people and clean water for 62,500 
people for a week.
