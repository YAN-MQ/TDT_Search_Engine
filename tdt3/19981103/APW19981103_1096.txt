Faced with depleting fish stocks and alarmed by the potential damage 
to their economies, more than 80 nations on Tuesday approved a voluntary 
agreement to limit fishing worldwide. Under the accord, nations also 
pledged to protect sharks and seabirds. Each year, thousands of sharks 
are accidentally caught in nets used by tuna fishermen while thousands 
of seabirds die when they try to feed off bait on fishing lines and 
become ensnared by the hooks. The document was adopted at a weeklong 
conference at the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization of 
the United Nations and has been submitted to the agency's fishing 
committee for final approval, expected in February. ``In most cases, 
the greatest risk is not the extinction of fish species but the extinction 
of economies,'' said Serge Garcia, director of FAO's Fisheries Resources 
Division. The world ocean catch is valued at about dlrs 80 billion 
a year, and fish farming adds another dlrs 42 billion. Fisheries employ 
about 200 million people worldwide. Garcia said that too many fish 
are being caught every year, preventing many species from reaching 
reproduction age and causing the number of fish in the ocean to drop. 
He estimated that an additional 10 million tons of fish could be caught 
each year if stocks were allowed to regenerate. ``If we reduce our 
fishing capacity, the fish will be bigger and there will be more of 
them,'' said Garcia. He said governments needed to restrict fishing 
licenses and encourage the retirement of vessels, two key recommendations 
in the accord. China, Russia, Japan, the United States and India lead 
the world in fishing tonnage, according to 1995 figures. Backers of 
the accord said it won the approval of all the key fishing nations, 
including the United States. What has happened with cod in Canada 
is a prime example of overfishing, said Garcia. There, the average 
life of cod, which is 20 years when they are undisturbed, has dropped 
to just 3, far below the age when they can start spawning. Species 
most at risk of further depletion include Atlantic cod and redfish, 
haddock, anchovy, swordfish and tunas such as bluefin, bigeye and 
albacore. FAO said that an increased trade in shark fins and other 
exotic shark products in recent years has critically endangered several 
species. The accord asks nations to adopt protective measures including 
special nets with holes for sharks to escape. It also calls on fishermen 
who accidentally catch sharks to put them back in the ocean alive 
and withdraw any hooks from their jaws.
