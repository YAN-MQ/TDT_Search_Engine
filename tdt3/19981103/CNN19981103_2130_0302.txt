Social issues ranging from gay marriage to late-term abortions dot 
several state election ballots. Washington state voters will decide 
on a proposition that would ban racial quotas in government hiring 
and higher education. There are two abortion measures on the Colorado 
ballot. One would end legalized late-term abortions. The other would 
require minors who want an abortion to notify their parents. Voters 
in Alaska and Hawaii will decide whether same-sex marriages should 
be forbidden. And the district of Columbia and four states take up 
the issue of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use.
