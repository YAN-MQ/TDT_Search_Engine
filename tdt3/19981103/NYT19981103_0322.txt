Nearly 10 years ago, Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. merged 
to form Time Warner Inc., promising that the creation of the world's 
largest media concern would result in hefty profits from synergies 
among distinct products like magazines, films, music, books and cable 
television. But it is only in the last year that Time Warner has emerged 
from managerial turmoil and difficulties selling a host of products 
under one roof to begin delivering on the lofty promises of its megamerger. 
Last April, Citicorp and Travelers Group agreed to merge to form Citigroup, 
promising that the creation of the world's largest financial services 
concern would result in hefty profits from ``cross-selling'' distinct 
products like mortgages, credit cards, savings accounts, stocks, bonds, 
corporate loans and mergers and acquisitions advice. Like Time Warner, 
Citigroup is getting off to a rocky start, and it may be some time 
before any of the hype surrounding the creation of Citigroup becomes 
reality. ``The ability to cross-sell, the buzzword of this merger, 
is going to be harder to deliver in an environment in which there 
is less demand for the products,'' said Charles Peabody, an analyst 
with Mitchell Securities Inc. ``This is like turning a battleship 
around _ it's going to take a long time.'' Like Time Warner in its 
early days, Citigroup has co-chief executives, and on Sunday those 
co-leaders, Sanford Weill and John Reed, acted to quell turmoil within 
Citigroup's newly minted executive suite by asking for the resignation 
of James Dimon, the company's president. Citigroup employees, analysts 
and Wall Street have given that move a sign of approval, arguing that 
Dimon was the person best suited to succeed Weill and Reed. In trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, Citigroup's already battered 
stock took a further hit, plunging $2, or 4.34 percent, to $44.125. 
But beyond the emotional reaction to Dimon's departure from Citigroup, 
a more basic question remains: How will Weill and Reed get their troubled 
corporate businesses, those involving investment banking activities 
like stock and bond trading and underwriting that Travelers specialized 
in, to mesh with such staid businesses as corporate lending that were 
Citicorp's forte? They are not saying. Perhaps reeling from their 
inability to get off to a smooth start and the threat of looming defections 
within the executive ranks, Messrs. Weill and Reed have been unavailable 
for comment over the last two days. Although the two executives selected 
on Sunday to turn around the corporate business, Victor Menezes and 
Michael Carpenter, have been described by Citigroup as amply suited 
for their new roles, neither has been available for interviews. Citigroup's 
spokesman, John Morris, did not return repeated phone calls on Tuesdau 
seeking comment on the company's plans. In an interview on Sunday, 
Reed described Citigroup's corporate business as ``in a class of our 
own,'' compared with robust rivals like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 
Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs. On paper, that view appears true. 
For example, in terms of U.S. debt and equity underwriting, Citigroup 
has managed $193.7 billion worth of deals so far this year, compared 
with $247.8 billion for Merrill Lynch, $179.5 billion for Morgan Stanley 
and $127.7 billion for Goldman, according to the Securities Data Co. 
But Citigroup, unlike these competitors, also has access to Citicorp's 
savings deposits to feed future deal making. And Citigroup has $45 
billion in shareholders' equity, compared with $15 billion for Morgan 
Stanley, $8.9 billion for Merrill and $6.5 billion for Goldman. ``On 
a flow chart, they may look like they're well ahead of their competitors, 
but the working pieces are not yet a well-oiled machine,'' Peabody 
said. ``There are reasons to question their ability to execute because 
some of the prior deals Travelers has done have yet to bear fruit.'' 
Indeed, while one of the reasons put forth for Dimon's forced resignation 
was $1.3 billion in bond trading losses Citigroup's Salomon Smith 
Barney unit incurred in the third quarter, the acquisition of Salomon 
Brothers last year by Travelers was Weill's brainchild _ and something 
Dimon had opposed. The jumble of businesses Weill had assembled before 
merging with Citicorp were not completely knitted together, and with 
an even larger number of different businesses now being meshed, the 
task of coordinating them is even more complex. ``They are neither 
fish nor fowl compared with the other big firms,'' said Raphael Soifer, 
an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Company. ``They are 
heavily weighted overseas, especially in emerging markets, have a 
large foreign- exchange operation and have a range of investment banking 
operations that aren't yet bulge bracket.'' The one great worry for 
Citigroup is that its problems and continued squabbling between Citicorp 
and Travelers executives over corporate turf, may ultimately cause 
defections among its clients to more stable firms on Wall Street. 
But analysts said that so far that worry was not a reality. ``I don't 
know how apparent it is to customers that there is turmoil at Citigroup 
right now,'' said David Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; 
Woods Inc. ``But I don't think customers are seeing service degrading 
either.'' Meanwhile, Citigroup still has to prove that the rationale 
for its merger was valid. ``If part of the vision of the merger was 
cross-selling, Citigroup can't do that until it figures out how to 
make the structure work,'' Berry said.
