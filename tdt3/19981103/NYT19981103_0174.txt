The electric waffle iron is one appliance from the 1950s that never 
really evolved. While newer items like the food processor combine 
the tasks of many tools and gadgets, the waffle iron still does just 
waffles. It must be pulled out of the closet and plugged in, it does 
only a couple of waffles at a time and it is difficult to clean. And 
at about $40, it seems a bit high for something people do not use 
very often. But it may finally have some competition: the Nordic Ware 
Belgian Waffle Iron. Its appeal? It is not electric, which means it 
is more compact, and it is far easier to clean. Though it, too, is 
about $40, it may get more use. To see how it performed, I tested 
it against an average electric waffle iron, the Villaware Belgian 
Waffler. The Villaware iron made a picture-perfect waffle. And making 
it could not have been easier. I put the batter in, closed the lid 
and waited for the light to go off. The resulting waffle was evenly 
browned, uniform in shape and looked as if it had just come out of 
a factory. The Nordic Ware waffle iron, on the other hand, took some 
skill to use. The flat, square two-sided iron, which weighs a tad 
over three pounds, must be heated for a few minutes on both sides 
on the stove top before adding the batter. I cooked the waffle on 
one side for a little less than a minute, then flipped the iron to 
brown the other side. This is where the Nordic Ware's greatest advantage 
became apparent. It allows the cook to control the heat so you can 
have dark waffles that are unevenly browned and rustic-looking, or 
pale, soft and spongy ones. Which makes it perfect if you're cooking 
for a fussy crowd. Waffles cooked dark in the Nordic Ware iron were 
also crispier than ones from the electric iron. If you heat up the 
pan enough, it browns the outside of the waffles quickly and deeply 
while allowing the center to stay moist. An electric waffle iron cannot 
do this, as it has even heat. For a dark waffle, you must overcook 
it, and then the interior ends up dry. The Nordic Ware Belgian Waffle 
Iron sells for about $40 in New York City.
