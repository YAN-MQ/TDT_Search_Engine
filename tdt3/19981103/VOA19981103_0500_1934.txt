Rescue workers in Central America are recovering hundreds of dead 
bodies and assisting the survivors from devastating floods and mudslides 
triggered by Hurricane Mitch. Officials estimate 7,000 people in Honduras 
and Nicaragua were killed in last week's storms. Hundreds of thousands 
of people are homeless. Honduran President Carlos Flores described 
a scene of death and desolation as he appealed for help. Pope John 
Paul also urged international aid to help Central America.
