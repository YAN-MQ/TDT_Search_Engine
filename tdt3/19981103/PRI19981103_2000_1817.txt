For THE WORLD, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom in London. 
The United Nations Security Council is resume talks on how to respond 
to Iraq's decision to stop cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors. 
British diplomats say they're preparing the resolution strongly condemning 
Iraq's behavior. Rob Watson reports. Council members are still uncertain 
about just how serious this current crisis really is. That, they say, 
depends on whether or not President Saddam Hussein has decided, once 
and for all, to get rid of the U.N.'s weapons inspectors or whether 
it's just another bargaining ploy from the Iraqi leader. If it's not 
just brinkmanship, most diplomats here are agreed this could be the 
most important showdown since the end of the Gulf War. The BBC's Rob 
Watson at the U.N.
