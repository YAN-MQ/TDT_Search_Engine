Russia's chief diamond producer and the South African cartel De Beers 
on Tuesday extended an agreement for the sale of Russian rough diamonds 
for three more years. The agreement, effective through the end of 
2001, allows Russia's Almazy Rossii-Sakha (ARS) to sell De Beers at 
least dlrs 550 million worth of rough diamonds each year. ARS supplies 
to the South African cartel are expected to reach about dlrs 900 million 
this year, said ARS president Vyacheslav Shtyrov. Under the agreement, 
Russia also may sell 5 percent of its diamonds from current production 
and 20 percent of diamonds from state reserves on the open market. 
De Beers' chief executive, Nicholas Oppenheimer, denied reports that 
the company planned to provide a diamond-backed loan to the cash-strapped 
Russian government. ``There have been no discussions on that matter,'' 
Oppenheimer said in Moscow after signing the trade agreement. Russian 
news agencies have quoted unidentified government officials as saying 
Oppenheimer would discuss the loan during the visit. They did not 
indicate the size of the possible loan, but said it would have been 
secured by diamonds held by the state treasury. De Beers earlier granted 
Russia a trade advance of dlrs 1 billion to develop Russian diamond 
fields. Russia supplies about 20 percent of the world's uncut gems, 
and 5 percent of all cut diamonds. The terms of the new trade agreement 
are unchanged from the current one, which expires at the end of the 
year. Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov praised the extension 
of the deal, the Interfax news agency reported. ``We are working in 
what is a very important field for us,'' he was quoted as telling 
Oppenheimer.
