Now for the other side in this equation, our reporter at the stunned 
d'Amato headquarters. Go ahead. Indeed it is here, Brian. A lot of 
people here. It is a very subdued crowd here at the election night 
headquarters for the republican party. A slight chant is going up 
now for one of the other candidates, but it is not Alfonse D'Amato. 
A man who has been considered a very tough street fighter seems to 
have met his match tonight. And after 18 years of being in the Senate, 
three terms, it looks like he will not be going back to Washington. 
Some are saying maybe it's because of all the negativity that occurred 
in this campaign. They're blaming a lot of it, it seems, on Alfonse 
D'Amato. And they're saying now that it looks like Schumer may have 
been just sticking up for himself trying to defend himself against 
the Negative ads that came out from D'Amato. The other thing is we're 
hearing from some people is that they think that the word may be that 
Al D'Amato may have just spent too much time in the senate. 18 years 
is a long time. And tonight it seems like the vote is -- the voters 
in New York are saying it is long enough. Again, a very subdued crowd 
here. I should mention to you also, as you know, that Al D'Amato has 
been pretty much riding on the coat tails of the popularity of the 
governor of New York, and that is pataki. I was asking if he would 
appear on stage tonight with him. We're told he will not. Al D'Amato 
leaving the U.S. Senate. The seal of the Senate on the lectern behind 
our reporter there, senator d'Amato will only be able to lay claim 
to that until January. New York has a new senator as of tonight.
