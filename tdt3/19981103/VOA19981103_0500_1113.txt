It's coming up on ten hours, 49 universal time. Here's the major news 
story we're following this hour. President Clinton has warned that 
all options are on the table until Iraq allows U.N. inspectors to 
resume their work. The U.N. Security Council meets today to discuss 
a draft resolution demanding Iraq's cooperation with the inspectors. 
We'll have an update on that story in about ten minutes. And you're 
right up on the hour universal time. We are turning to business news 
right now. Paul Westpheling is switching roles today and brings us 
the business.
