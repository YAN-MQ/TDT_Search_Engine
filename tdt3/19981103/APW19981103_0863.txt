On Nov. 17, Mireya Perez will make a bit of history in Chile: she 
will become the first woman ever to reach the rank of general. The 
promotion will culminate a 32-year-old career of Col. Perez in the 
Carabineros, Chile's militarized national police. The pioneer thinks 
that others soon will follow. ``From now on, I expect to see every 
year more women becoming generals,'' she said. She does not expect 
problems with male subordinates, since she already has quite a few. 
As general, she will keep her job as head of a special police division 
in charge of family affairs. The armed forces have admitted women 
since the early 1970s, but none of them has yet reached the top. Army 
commander in chief Ricardo Izurieta announced recently that some branch 
colonels may soon become generals.
