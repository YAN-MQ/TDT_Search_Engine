The Oklahoma City bombing case is the most expensive investigation 
in U.S. history. Government officials say investigating and prosecuting 
the attack cost taxpayers more than $82 million. The FBI alone had 
more than 2,500 agents on the case. One prosecutor who worked on the 
case said it was important to leave no stone unturned. The investigation 
resulted in the convictions of bomber Timothy McVeigh and conspirator 
Terry Nichols. The April 1995 attack killed 168 people.
