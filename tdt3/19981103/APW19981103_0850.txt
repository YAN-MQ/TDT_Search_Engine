The ex-wife of murdered fashion scion Maurizio Gucci was convicted 
of his contract killing Tuesday and sentenced to 29 years in prison. 
Her four co-defendants were also convicted, with the triggerman getting 
a life sentence. The verdict came only a few hours after Patrizia 
Reggiani Martinelli made a final plea for mercy before a crowded courtroom, 
saying she was naive and involved in his murder only against her will. 
Her lawyer said she turned to him in bewilderment after the verdict, 
while fights broke out between police and journalists pushing to get 
closer to the woman Italy's press has dubbed ``The Black Widow.'' 
```Truth is the child of time,''' the lawyer quoted her as saying. 
```Evidentally, they didn't believe me.''' Ex-husband Maurizio Gucci, 
46, was shot dead March 27, 1995, on the steps of his Milan office. 
He was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, founder of the fashion company 
known for its leather goods and double ``G'' logo. He was the last 
Gucci to hold a stake in the company, but he sold out for dlrs 120 
million in 1993 after a long history of family discord. Prosecutors 
alleged his ex-wife had him killed to gain control of his fortune. 
The prosecution had asked for the maximum _ a life sentence. But the 
panel of two judges and five citizens chose a shorter prison term. 
Also convicted were her longtime psychic adviser, Giuseppina Auriemma, 
the doorman of a seedy hotel, a debt-ridden pizzeria owner accused 
of pulling the trigger, and an unemployed auto worker accused of driving 
the getaway car. Auriemma was sentenced to 25 years in prison, the 
doorman got 26, the driver got 29 years and the triggerman was sentenced 
to life. All but Gucci's ex-wife and the pizzeria owner confessed. 
With its sordid courtroom revelations about greed, betrayal and shameless 
social climbing, the five-month trial has aired a seamy side of Milan, 
the chic capital of Italy's fashion industry. Prosecution witnesses 
testified that Reggiani Martinelli wasn't satisfied with her dlrs 
860,000 a year in alimony and wanted all of her ex-husband's money. 
Pale and drawn, Reggiani Martinelli pointed her finger Tuesday at 
Auriemma, whom she says arranged the murder, then blackmailed her 
for dlrs 375,000. ``I have been naive to the point of stupidity,'' 
she told a packed courtroom that included her son and mother. ``I 
found myself involved against my will. I deny categorically that I 
was an accomplice.'' The once-glamorous Reggiani Martinelli said Auriemma, 
a Neapolitan of humble origins, used her to satisfy an obsessive hunger 
for money and power. ``Never let even a friendly wolf into the chicken 
coop. Sooner or later it will get hungry,'' she said. Reggiani Martinelli, 
50, has admitted threatening Gucci and repeatedly seeking someone 
to kill him, but says she never went through with the plan. Auriemma 
has admitted arranging Gucci's murder but testified that she did it 
at Reggiani Martinelli's behest. She made no final statement Tuesday. 
The driver of the getaway car, Orazio Cicala, and hotel doorman Ivano 
Savioni, who acted as a go-between, both made public pleas for forgiveness. 
Alleged triggerman Benedetto Ceraulo again maintained his innocence. 
``I've reflected a lot over these long months,'' Savioni told the 
court. ``I know that I face many long years in prison for what I've 
done. I ask the pardon of Gucci's children and am horrified that things 
went so much farther than I intended.'' Lawyer Giovanni Maria Dedola 
said the younger of the couple's two daughters took the verdict in 
tears. He promised an appeal. ``The fact that they gave less than 
life imprisonment means there was some doubt and that gives us some 
hope,'' he said.
