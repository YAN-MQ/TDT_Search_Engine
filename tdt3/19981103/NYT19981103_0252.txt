Spain's prime minister said Tuesday that he had authorized his government 
to talk with people close to the leading Basque guerrilla group to 
test the trustworthiness of the rebels, who announced what they called 
an indefinite cease-fire six weeks ago. Prime Minister Jose Maria 
Aznar, who survived a bomb attack by the rebels in 1995 when he was 
the opposition leader, has said there can be no peace talks directly 
with the rebel group, known as the ETA, until it permanently renounces 
violence to end its 30-year armed fight for an independent Basque 
homeland. The prime minister's chief spokesman, Josep Pique, said 
the initial talks aimed ``only to verify if there is a real willingness 
to abandon arms and stop the violence.'' Aznar answered with a simple 
``yes'' when reporters asked if he had authorized the initial contacts. 
Soon after, some of his aides said privately that the Basque rebels, 
who are blamed for 800 deaths, were showing signs of wanting a permanent 
peace since their announcement on Sept. 16 of the unilateral cease-fire. 
``First, the guns remain silent,'' one aide noted. Further, he added, 
the leftist independence coalition Euskal Heritarrok, which is linked 
to the rebels, has expressed respect for the results of the Basque 
parliamentary elections last month, which was won by moderates who 
prefer to keep the prosperous Basque region within Spain. Government 
officials insisted they would not reveal the timing, location or the 
participants in the initial talks. But one of Aznar's aides said he 
had heard the venue might be in France, Belgium or even Mexico. The 
talks would be the government's first acknowledged contacts since 
1989 with the ETA, whose initials in the Basque language stand for 
Basque Homeland and Liberty, and the first ever by a conservative 
government. The previous talks under the Socialist administration 
lasted just a few months before breaking off. Each side blamed the 
other for the impasse, and the ETA renewed its wave of bombings and 
shootings. But officials said that the ETA's current cease-fire, its 
first without conditions or an end date, is a better start for the 
peace process, which they expect to involve long and difficult negotiations. 
Madrid politicians point out that the cease-fire comes after police 
arrests have thinned the ranks of the rebels and large street demonstrations 
in Spain since last year, including in the northern Basque region, 
have united people of diverse political parties to call for a permanent 
peace. The opposition Socialist Party expressed surprise Tuesday that 
it had not been consulted about the start of initial talks, but the 
moderate Basque Nationalist Party, which has governed in minority 
in the Basque region for 18 years, called the government's announcement 
``a new important element in the peace process.'' The most cautious 
reaction came from the Association of Victims of Terrorism, based 
in Madrid, which urged that the talks should not lead to a ``secret 
amnesty'' for some 530 ETA convicts or suspects who are jailed in 
Spain. The victims association, representing 1,400 Spanish families 
who comprise half of those affected by terrorist attacks, has argued 
vigorously that the victims not be forgotten on the path to peace.
