A top magistrate openly accused the president's office of meddling 
in politically sensitive cases, media reported Tuesday. In yet another 
sign that Romania's judicial system is suspected of bowing to political 
interests, the general secretary of the Magistrates Association, Viorica 
Costiniu, said the presidential office had obtained access to confidential 
files through the justice ministry. She did not specify which cases. 
Since communism was overthrown in 1989, there have been repeated allegations 
that political leaders intervene in certain sensitive cases. Officials 
elected two years ago vowed to allow the judicial system to function 
independently, but corruption continues. Last week, during a visit 
to Norway, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu said that Romania's 
magistrates were ``communists,'' prompting the magistrates to respond. 
Speaking on private Antena 1 TV late Monday, Costiniu also said chiefs 
of police or prosecutors often telephone judges before some trials 
open, suggesting solutions to the case. Bucharest daily Ziua Tuesday 
said it was impossible for honest magistrates to survive in the system, 
forcing many to abandon the profession ``at an alarming rate'' to 
become lawyers and public notaries. A judge in Romania's Supreme Court 
of Justice, Maria Coca-Cozma, who heads the magistrate's association 
told reporters at a news conference Monday that judges ``who oppose 
interference are intimidated and threatened'' by top prosecutors. 
She cited two cases, where she said judges had come under pressure. 
One involved a huge cigarette smuggling scandal in April in which 
security officers close to President Emil Constantinescu were charged 
and the other was the case of Syrian businessman who was charged with 
massive fraud and had close links to former President Ion Iliescu. 
The Magistrates Association represents some 2,450 civil and military 
judges. Almost three-quarters were appointed after 1989.
