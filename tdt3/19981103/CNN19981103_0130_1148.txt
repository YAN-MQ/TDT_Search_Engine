A football player makes news off the field next in "CNN Headline Sports." 
And later -- a familiar face from television's past says "cheers" 
to a new comedy series. Of all the things we might put honey in, the 
best may be new honey cough. Introducing the first line of cough drops 
and cough syrup combining effective medicine with real honey. To relieve 
even the worst coughs. New honey cough: mmmm! Mike Sammond, "CNN Headline 
Sports."
