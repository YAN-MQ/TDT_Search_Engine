Indonesia's ruling Golkar Party appeared split Tuesday over whether 
to apologize for its role in keeping authoritarian former President 
Suharto in power for three decades. Newspaper reports quoted the party's 
deputy chairman, Marzuki Darusman, as saying sorry for Golkar's past 
performance. ``I want to apologize on behalf of Golkar for all of 
the mistakes it made in the past,'' The Jakarta Post quoted him as 
saying at a political seminar in the capital Monday. Darusman said 
Golkar needed to rebuild its relations with the Indonesian people 
ahead of elections next year. However, party chairman Akbar Tanjung 
said Tuesday that Darusman's comments did not represent an official 
apology by the party. Akbar, who is also the government's state secretary 
and a Cabinet minister, told reporters at the Presidential Palace 
that Golkar did not need to say sorry as it was unclear what it should 
apologize for. ``Officially and organizationally, Golkar has never 
apologized,'' he was quoted as saying by the official Antara news 
agency. Opponents have criticized Golkar for playing a major role 
in Suharto's regime, which has been accused of corruption and human 
rights abuses. Many say it should seek forgiveness from Indonesians 
for past wrongs and for allowing Indonesia to slide into the current 
economic crisis. Protests and riots forced the old autocrat to quit 
in May amid the economic turmoil. During Suharto's era, Golkar was 
one of only three political parties allowed to contest what were tightly 
controlled elections every five years. It has overwhelmingly dominated 
the Parliament since 1971. At the most recent election in 1997, it 
won more than 70 percent of the vote. However, Suharto's successor, 
President B.J. Habibie, has promised political reforms and fresh democratic 
elections, scheduled next May. The reforms are to be discussed next 
week by the People's Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest legislative 
body. Critics have questioned how far Habibie and the assembly will 
push the reform process. Nevertheless, it is certain that Habibie 
will allow many new political parties to contest the election. Analysts 
say Golkar will probably lose its huge parliamentary majority at the 
May election, largely because of its past record. This is even though 
it has undergone extensive reform within its own ranks to cut its 
links with Suharto's legacy. It has dumped Suharto as its patron and 
has purged its ranks of many of his closest aides.
