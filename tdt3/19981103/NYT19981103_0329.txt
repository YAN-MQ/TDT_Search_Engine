Less than a month after Boston Scientific Corp. was forced to recall 
a new medical device because of severe safety concerns, the company 
announced Tuesday that its Japanese subsidiary had improperly inflated 
sales by millions of dollars. Executives at the medical device company 
said a routine internal review had detected that the subsidiary had 
recently reported $40 million to $50 million in sales of inventory 
to distributors that were not true sales. In addition, the subsidiary 
may have overstated sales in earlier years by a further $40 million, 
said Larry Best, the company's chief financial officer. The company 
is ``aggressively investigating'' the accounting irregularities, Best 
said, and will have more information in a few weeks. Revenue for this 
year is still expected to top $2 billion, he said. Two executives 
in charge of the company's Japanese operations _ the president of 
the Japanese subsidiary and the president of Boston Scientific International 
_ have offered to resign, Best said. Tuesday's announcement took Wall 
Street analysts by surprise. The company's shares fell $5.875, to 
$46.375, on the New York Stock Exchange. ``I think the company has 
seen an erosion of its credibility,'' said Eli Kammerman, an analyst 
at Raymond James &AMP; Associates, who has not recommended the stock 
to investors since July because he said he regarded the company's 
estimates of future earnings as exaggerated. ``This problem highlights 
the intense pressures that Wall Street puts on companies to meet earnings 
expectations,'' Kammerman said. Last month, Boston Scientific, which 
is based in Natick, Mass., voluntarily recalled a medical device after 
at least one patient died and 26 others were injured. The recall came 
only two months after regulators at the Food and Drug Administration 
began letting the company sell the device, a new type of catheter, 
or tube, used to gain access to internal organs and blood vessels. 
The product that was recalled, known as a stent, was used in patients 
with heart problems. The FDA is now investigating whether Boston Scientific 
should have notified federal regulators before it changed its method 
of manufacturing the stent. Referring to the investigation, Best said, 
``I don't think there is an issue there at all.'' He added that the 
company was trying to get the product back on the market by early 
1999. Tuesday, some Wall Street analysts said that they were disappointed 
by the announcement of the accounting irregularities, but that they 
were relieved that the problem seemed to be confined to Japan, which 
now accounts for about 20 percent of the company's sales. Glenn Reicin, 
an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said he did not believe 
the accounting irregularities were as severe as those found this year 
at other companies, such as Cendant Corp., a marketing and franchising 
company. ``Is this another Cendant?'' Reicin asked. ``Based on the 
information presented by management, the answer is probably not.'' 
``This is a situation where the overzealousness of management in Japan 
hurt the company,'' he said. The company is also grappling with another 
big accounting issue that involves its recent acquisition of Schneider 
Worldwide, a medical device manufacturer, from Pfizer Inc. The company 
has postponed reporting third-quarter results to try to comply with 
new requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission on accounting 
for certain types of acquisitions. Boston Scientific paid $2.1 billion 
for Schneider and had expected to write off hundreds of millions of 
dollars of that as the amount paid for Schneider's past research and 
development. But the SEC has recently been cracking down on companies 
that have tried to write off too much of the cost of an acquisition 
by taking a one-time hit to their bottom lines. Best said that Boston 
Scientific's auditing firm, Ernst &AMP; Young, is now evaluating just 
how much of the Schneider acquisition can be written off. The less 
the company writes off now, the more goodwill, an intangible asset, 
the company must add to its balance sheet. That amount must then be 
gradually written off, reducing future earnings.
