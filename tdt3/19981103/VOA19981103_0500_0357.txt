Israel's Cabinet is set to begin debate today on the new peace accord 
with Palestinians that gives them control over 13 percent more of 
the West Bank. Israeli officials say Cabinet approval is expected 
Wednesday after the Cabinet reviews a Palestinian plan for boosting 
security. Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's 
implementation of the U.S. brokered accord will be delayed until parliament 
approves it next week. The accord was due to take effect Monday. In 
a show of good will, Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat agreed to the 
postponement.
