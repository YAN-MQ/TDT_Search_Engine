Pope John Paul II offered prayers for the more than 7,000 killed by 
Hurricane Mitch and appealed for aid for the survivors Tuesday. The 
Vatican sent its condolences through the papal nuncio in Nicaragua, 
the country hardest-hit by the storm. John Paul ``prayed for the eternal 
rest of the deceased and asked God to console those affected by the 
tragedy,'' the message said. ``At the same time, His Holiness urged 
institutions and all men of good faith moved by feelings of fraternal 
solidarity and Christian charity to lend their help to overcome these 
difficult moments.'' The pontiff asked the nuncio, Monsignor Luigi 
Travaglino, to relay ``his paternal solicitude and feelings of closeness 
to the injured and homeless to whom he sends, from his heart, the 
comforting apostolic benediction as a sign to all those affected among 
the beloved Nicaraguan people.''
