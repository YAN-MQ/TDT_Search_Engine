NBC news White House correspondent David Bloom, the word has just 
hit the White House that they the democrats have just gained a senator 
from a big state, Al D'Amato, taking leave of the Senate, David it 
must be greeted well there? k! There are a number of race races the 
White House is watching closely. I can tell you every single one of 
those tight races that have been called so far have broken for the 
democrats. Schumer beating D'Amato in New York. Down in North Carolina, 
Edwards defeating Faircloth. The three new democratic governors elected 
in the south in Alabama, South Carolina, and Georgia. The White House 
officially, the president hasn't reacted, but they're positively giddy 
tonight. One White House official who's with the president now told 
me a few minutes ago, who would have said eight weeks ago this sort 
of thing could happen? Tonight, while a number of returns have yet 
to come in, White House officials very giddy this evening. Sometimes 
giddiness is predictable. Thank you David Bloom. We should add, from 
the associated press here is their lead. President Clinton has graduated 
the democrats' first big winner while his wife has been watching a 
movie. We're told by A.P. the White House is able to get first-run 
movies from the White House theater. Hillary Rodham Clinton is watching 
"beloved." We're told the reason is she wants to calm election night 
nerves. So far the president on the record has placed two phone calls 
to the victorious center-elect Evan bayh and to returning democratic 
stalwart, chris dod.
