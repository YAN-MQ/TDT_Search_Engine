Well, it's almost as if we didn't need to have a session today because 
the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed exactly unchanged at 8706, 
and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed at 1110. That was down 
by just a fraction of a point. The only real movement was in NASDAQ, 
which was down 12 points. That was because of weakness in some technology 
issues. Well, there was also some caution in advance of U.S. election 
results, although the Republican Party is expected to retain control 
of both houses of Congress.
