Ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Ragoba toured war-tattered 
Central Kosovo Tuesday with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill. The two men 
ventured into areas where Kosovo Liberation Army troops and Serbian 
troops had clashed until a truce and pull out of most government forces 
a week ago. I'm Robert Burns, VOA News.
