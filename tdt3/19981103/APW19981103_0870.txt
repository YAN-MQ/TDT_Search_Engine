A Swiss foundation holding the copyright to Anne Frank's famous diary 
went to court Tuesday against an Amsterdam newspaper that printed 
parts of five newly discovered pages. The Basel-based Anne Frank Fund 
scolded the daily Het Parool for what it contends was the ``unauthorized 
publication'' of excerpts. Its suit in the Amsterdam District Court 
claims copyright infringement. The squabble began in August, when 
longtime Frank family friend Cor Suijk revealed he held five previously 
unpublished handwritten pages penned by the Jewish teen hiding from 
the Nazis. On Aug. 26, Het Parool published about 400 words of excerpts 
on its front page next to a large photograph of Anne. The new diary 
entries contained Anne's criticisms of her parents' strained relationship. 
Germ Kemper, the lawyer for the Anne Frank Fund, said the group wants 
the newspaper to run a correction acknowledging copyright infringement, 
and stop quoting from the new pages and sending copies to other media. 
The newspaper has refused, contending it had the right under Dutch 
and European freedom of speech laws to print the excerpts. ``All requirements 
for lawful quotation have been satisfied,'' said Willem van Manen, 
a lawyer for the newspaper, which has not said how it obtained the 
passages still in Suijk's possession. A verdict has been scheduled 
for Nov. 12. The Anne Frank Fund holds all rights to ``The Diary of 
Anne Frank,'' an international bestseller in dozens of languages. 
It has no connection to the Amsterdam-based Anne Frank Foundation, 
which runs a popular museum in the canal house where the girl and 
her family hid for two years until their betrayal. Anne died of typhus 
in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp weeks before it was liberated 
in the spring of 1945.
