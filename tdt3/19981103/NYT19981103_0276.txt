The classified advertisement was tucked away on page 22 of the Addison 
County Independent, the twice-weekly paper serving 7,000 readers in 
the shadow of the Green Mountains. ``Heartfelt thanks,'' it began, 
``to all the friends and neighbors who supported our family during 
the three long years Sam was in Boston at school. You chauffeured 
the kids, helped Eugenie fix things, chase heifers and keep a sense 
of humor.'' The ad went on to make special mention of the teachers 
at the Monkton Central School, ``who showed us enthusiasm for lifelong 
learning.'' Even, it added, ``in a middle-aged farmer's quixotic journey 
to law school.'' ``We survived,'' the ad concluded. ``Sam's home.'' 
Eugenie Doyle, a 46-year-old substitute teacher at the elementary 
school, spent $19.60 to place that ad on Oct. 5. It was intended to 
reach the 1,687 residents of this farming and bedroom community about 
55 miles south of the Canadian border, who had picked up the slack 
for her absent husband, however deeply it had pained her to ask for 
help. ``When you say thank you,'' she said in an interview, ``you 
realize how much you've been given, and how rich you are.'' In 1995, 
battered by an economy that set the price of milk well below what 
it cost to produce it, Ms. Doyle's husband, Sam Burr made a change. 
After two decades as a dairy farmer _ the only job he had ever really 
known or wanted, but a job in which he had run up losses of $30,000 
in some years _ Burr decided to go to law school at age 44. He picked 
the law, he said, because he ``wanted to make a difference.'' There 
were 3,688 dairy farmers in Vermont when he bought his first farm 
in 1975; this year, there were 1,770. And those who were left, Burr 
reasoned, could probably use an advocate who understood the pressures 
bearing on them. Burr picked Northeastern University in Boston, 260 
miles south, because it was close enough for him to travel home on 
the weekends. And after the first year, there was a co-op program, 
which meant that he could alternate three-month terms on campus with 
internships in Vermont. But Burr, a wiry man with thick gray sideburns, 
also wanted to escape for a while. Two years earlier, he had been 
forced to auction the last of the 59 heifers in his herd. And for 
a man who prefers the company of cows to people _ his cows' names, 
including Rocket and Lulu, are memorialized in a folder on his desk 
titled ``Gone but Not Forgotten'' _ there was only so much empty barn 
he could take. ``There is nothing more frustrating than being on a 
farm, watching things go downhill and not being able to figure out 
how not to make it happen,'' he said, walking past rows of organic 
strawberries grown by his wife to provide ``grocery money'' in his 
absence. Holding out hope that they could find him something else 
to do, his wife had begged him not to go to law school. ``It seemed 
like, first the cows go, then the equipment, then the farmer,'' she 
said. But scraping together tuition money from the sale of eight residential 
lots carved from the farm's 270 acres, as well as with loans from 
relatives, Burr departed for Boston in August 1995. It would not be 
his first time in school there: Burr had graduated from Harvard in 
1974 with a degree in anthropology. He had hoped at the time, he said, 
to attend a more rural school but had been talked out of the idea 
by Harvard's president, Dr. Nathan M. Pusey, a family friend. At Northeastern, 
Burr discovered that he loved learning about the law and became an 
active participant in class discussions, where fellow students referred 
to him as ``Pops.'' Meanwhile, his wife was feeling his loss. On the 
first day of school after he had left, Ms. Doyle got a flat tire with 
her daughter, Nora, then 11, and her twin sons, Silas and Caleb, then 
8, in the car. She realized she would have to call a neighbor for 
help, but that was hardly something that came naturally. ``Farmers 
can be really isolated,'' she said. ``You kind of stick to yourselves.'' 
She did call, and John Padua, who owns a nearby nursery, responded. 
Ms. Doyle wanted to fix the tire herself. He took the kids to school. 
A week or so later, a neighbor who lives on the edge of the family's 
farm, Robin Hopps, telephoned Ms. Doyle at the school to say that 
the heifers being boarded on Ms. Doyle's property _ their home farm 
had grown too small _ were loose. Rounding up her kids from their 
classes, she returned to find the problem: her husband had given permission, 
unbeknown to her, for a bull to be temporarily lodged there as well. 
He had trampled the fence. That night, the bull got out again and 
was somehow held at bay in Ms. Hopps' compost heap by her housemate, 
Wendi Sue Harper. Ms. Doyle, twisting the animal's tail, got him home. 
There were other kindnesses by neighbors that Ms. Doyle logged: one 
fixed the furnace in the middle of the night, another moved the refrigerator, 
and any number picked up one child at soccer practice while she picked 
up the other. For the children, the hardest part was when their father 
``had to leave on Sunday,'' said Caleb, now 12. Now Burr is home, 
and his family is getting used to the idea of seeing him in a suit. 
Prior to this year, he had only owned two: a black one from high school, 
which still fit, and one he inherited from his grandfather two decades 
ago. He is working, for the time being, at the Vermont Legislative 
Council, a government agency that helps legislators draft bills. Though 
he still hopes to advocate on behalf of his fellow farmers, he has 
not quite figured out how. For now, Burr works in a cramped office 
adjacent to the statehouse, where atop his computer sits a faded blue 
corderoy hat, with the name of the Blue Seal grain company emblazoned 
on the front. He had worn it, he said, every day of his life as a 
farmer.
