The ex-wife of slain fashion heir Maurizio Gucci made a final plea 
of innocence Tuesday before a packed courtroom, saying she was naive 
and involved in his murder against her will. A verdict from the panel 
of two judges and five citizens is expected later in the day. Patrizia 
Reggiani Martinelli is accused of murdering her ex-husband to gain 
control of his fortune. The prosecution has asked for the maximum 
sentence in Italy: life imprisonment. Also on trial for murder are 
her longtime psychic adviser, Giuseppina Auriemma, the doorman of 
a seedy hotel, a debt-ridden pizzeria owner accused of pulling the 
trigger, and an unemployed auto worker accused of driving the getaway 
car. All but Gucci's ex-wife and the pizzeria owner have confessed. 
Gucci, 46, was shot to death March 27, 1995, outside his Milan office. 
He was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, founder of the fashion company 
known for its leather goods and double ``G'' logo. Maurizio Gucci 
was the last Gucci to hold a stake in the company, but he sold out 
for dlrs 120 million in 1993 after a long history of family discord. 
With its sordid courtroom revelations about greed, betrayal and shameless 
social climbing, the five-month trial has aired a seamy side of Milan, 
the chic capital of Italy's fashion industry. Prosecution witnesses 
testified that Reggiani Martinelli wasn't satisfied with her dlrs 
860,000 a year in alimony and wanted all of her ex-husband's money. 
Pale and drawn, Reggiani Martinelli pointed her finger Tuesday at 
Auriemma, whom she says arranged the murder, then blackmailed her 
for dlrs 375,000. ``I have been naive to the point of stupidity,'' 
she told a packed courtroom that included her son and mother. ``I 
found myself involved against my will. I deny categorically that I 
was an accomplice.'' The once-glamorous Reggiani Martinelli said Auriemma, 
a Neapolitan of humble origins, used her to satisfy an obsessive hunger 
for money and power. ``Never let even a friendly wolf into the chicken 
coop. Sooner or later it will get hungry,'' she said. Reggiani Martinelli, 
50, has admitted threatening Gucci and repeatedly seeking someone 
to kill him, but says she never went through with the plan. Auriemma 
has admitted arranging Gucci's murder but testified that she did it 
at Reggiani Martinelli's behest. She made no final statement Tuesday. 
The driver of the getaway car, Orazio Cicala, and hotel doorman Ivano 
Savioni, who acted as a go-between, both made public pleas for forgiveness. 
Alleged triggerman Benedetto Ceraulo again maintained his innocence. 
``I've reflected a lot over these long months,'' Savioni told the 
court. ``I know that I face many long years in prison for what I've 
done. I ask the pardon of Gucci's children and am horrified that things 
went so much father than I intended.''
