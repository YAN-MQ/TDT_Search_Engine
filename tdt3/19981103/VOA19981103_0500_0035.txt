The Iraqi decision over the weekend to stop all cooperation with United 
Nations weapons inspectors has drawn several responses around the 
globe. President Clinton called his National Security Council into 
session on Monday to a response to a situation which Mr. Clinton called 
completely unacceptable. We have details from VOA's David Gullis at 
the White House. Mr. Clinton told reporters after the National Security 
Council meeting, the second in its many days on Iraq, that no options 
for responding to Saddam Hussein's latest move were being ruled out. 
But there were no announcements of any change in U.S. or ally deployments 
in the Gulf region, and White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said U.S. 
forces already in the area are capable of dealing, as he put it, "quickly 
and forcefully if called upon to act." Speaking at a White House health 
care event, Mr. Clinton depicted the latest turn of events as another 
attempt by Saddam Hussein to escape the sanctions in place against 
Baghdad since the end of the Gulf War. Instead of dividing the world 
community, however, Mr. Clinton said the gambit has backfired and 
only strengthened international resolve as seen in Saturday's unanimous 
U.N. Security Council condemnation of Iraq. For Iraq, the only path 
to lifting sanctions is through complete cooperation with the weapons 
inspectors without restrictions, run-arounds, or roadblocks. In the 
coming days, we will be consulting closely with our allies and our 
friends in the region. Until the inspectors are back on the job, no 
options are off the table. Mr. Clinton said the United States will 
be consulting closely with its allies in the next few days. It was 
announced that Defense Secretary William Cohen, who broke off a trip 
to Asia because of the latest crisis, is being sent to Europe and 
the Middle East as part of the process. The United States has kept 
a large military presence in the Gulf since the beginning of the year 
when Iraq triggered another confrontation by trying to bar American 
inspectors from the U.N. contingent. The force includes some 200 military 
planes and a naval fleet led by the nuclear aircraft carrier, Eisenhower, 
capable of firing long-range tomahawk cruise missiles. David Gullis, 
VOA News, the White House.
