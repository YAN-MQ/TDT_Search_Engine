Dutch telecommunications giant Royal KPN NV said Tuesday it will eliminate 
3,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting restructuring program. KPN said 
the reorganization, which was announced in April and will cost 800 
million guilders (dlrs 427.8 million) this year, is aimed at enhancing 
its efficiency. The company will cut 4,000 jobs in the coming three 
years but also will create 1,000 new positions in growth sectors such 
as Internet activities and mobile telephone and information technology. 
KPN said the deepest cuts would be made in the fields of fixed network 
operations, construction and maintenance, at directory inquiries and 
its installation business. Also included in the cuts are 1,000 jobs 
at KPN's corporate office and service units. KPN said forced redundancies 
will ``probably be unavoidable.''
