Voter reaction to the sex scandal surrounding President Clinton and 
Monica Lewinsky is being gauged in today's congressional elections. 
THE WORLD's - rather David Levali reports the elections could have 
a major impact on the president's political future. There's much at 
stake in these mid-term elections. In all, voters are choosing from 
among candidates for 36 governorships, 34 Senate seats, and 435 seats 
in the House of Representatives, and the overall outcome of today's 
voting could shift one way or another the political balance of the 
now Republican-controlled Congress. That's critical because the 106th 
Congress, which takes office in January, will likely preside over 
the matter of President Clinton's possible impeachment. Despite months 
of campaigning and millions of dollars worth of TV ads, election analysts 
are predicting a lower-than-average turnout, in this, the last national 
election of the century. For THE WORLD, I'm David Levali.
