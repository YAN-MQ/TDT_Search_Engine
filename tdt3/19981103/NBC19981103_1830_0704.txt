Now to the def strags in central America where even as the death toll 
climbs, numbers are missing or are homeless. The storm is still dangerous. 
It's moving. But where Mitch has already struck, the human tragedy 
is overwhelming. George Lewis remains in that part of the world. a 
man in Guatemala carrying the body of his son. "Why did you take him 
from me, God," he sobs. "Why did you take him from me?" Experts here 
say the central American death toll could go as high as 13,000. The 
suffering is everywhere. People on rooftops in Guatemala, waiting 
to be rescued. In Nicaragua, a river of mud covers a wide area where 
1,500 people are believed dead -- buried by mud. Rather than disturb 
them, the government talks about turning this place into a national 
cemetery to honor the victims. For the survivors, life has turned 
into a major struggle. The situation of the people is tragic. They 
don't have food. They don't have Shelter. They don't have clothes. 
So they are desperately in need of help. Some places, like this nicaraguan 
village of La Paz norte, appear beyond help. Here, mudslides and flash 
floods claimed 25 lives. This spot is where six people died. Two families 
huddled together in a house to escape the rising floodwaters. They 
put the children on the roof for safety. But then, the house collapsed 
and the children were swept away. Silvia araoz, the mother of three 
of the children, survived by clinging to a rope for several hours. 
When she was rescued, she said she didn't want to leave until the 
bodies of her children were recovered. Two of Sylvia's relatives, 
gerado and Andrea Reyes, survey the devastation. Andrea says, "we've 
lived here all our lives. Every time I come back here, I realize my 
grandmother and cousins are gone." While some of the villagers talk 
about rebuilding, others say they don't want to live here anymore. 
If you take the grief and suffering here and multiply it by hundreds 
of other villages that have been devastated, you begin to realize 
the magnitude of what's happened in central America. George Lewis, 
NBC news, La Paz norte, Nicaragua.
