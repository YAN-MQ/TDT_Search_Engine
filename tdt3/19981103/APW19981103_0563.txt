A Spanish judge filed an extradition request Tuesday to bring former 
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet from London to face charges 
of genocide, terrorism and torture in Spain. Judge Baltasar Garzon, 
whose earlier detention order resulted in Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest 
in London, sent his extradition request to Spain's Justice Ministry, 
which could present it Friday to a Cabinet meeting, sources close 
to the judge told reporters.
