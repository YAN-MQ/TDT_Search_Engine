A solemn Kerry Collins apologized today for driving while intoxicated 
in North Carolina. Collins was arrested Monday morning hours after 
the Panthers, his former team, beat the saints. I completely accept 
full responsibility for my actions. Driving under the influence of 
alcohol is a serious offense, one which should not be taken lightly. 
This is my first offense and it will be my only offense.
