Treasury secretary Robert Rubin getting a strong note of approval 
today from President Clinton. At a meeting with his top economic advisers, 
including Rubin, the president addressed mounting speculation Rubin 
would step down from his post following today's elections. We haven't 
discussed it in quite a while. He knows that I want him to stay as 
long as he's comfortable sitting in that chair. And I think all of 
us know there are a lot of things going on in the world today, and 
the United States has a special responsibility. I'm very pleased at 
the work we've been able to do under secretary Rubin's leadership 
to stabilize the financial conditions, especially in the last couple 
of months. Rubin had no comment about his plans.
