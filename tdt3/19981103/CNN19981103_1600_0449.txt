The United States has sent military aircraft and helicopters to Ferry 
supplies to areas of central America hard hit by storm system Mitch. 
Meantime, the red cross is tripling its appeal for aid, to help the 
victims of the storm. The agency now says it needs $7.5 million. Many 
towns in Honduras are still isolated after floods washed out roads 
and bridges. Nicaraguan officials are also asking for disaster assistance. 
We are fighting against sickness at the moment, and we need blankets. 
We are asking for medicines, for any type of things that going -- 
we have no milk at all, because the main areas of the country are 
in the north, where are the milk producers are completely cut off 
and we can't reach these people, so the main tactic at the moment 
is to save these lives, to get to these people as much as we can. 
The death toll in central America from Mitch is believed to be at 
least 7,000, but officials say they may never know the actual number.
