A government team investigating last May's riots in the Indonesian 
capital says it has verified that 66 women, mostly ethnic Chinese, 
were raped in the violence. The panel issued a report Tuesday disputing 
claims by the military that no mass rapes were committed during the 
riots, which helped bring down former President Suharto. I'm Dave 
DeForest, VOA News.
