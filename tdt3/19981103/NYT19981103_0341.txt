With subtle shifts of tone and emphasis, the British government is 
signaling new warmth toward the soon-to-be introduced European single 
currency, promising to divulge a ``national change-over plan'' for 
the euro earlier than many people had previously thought. British 
pundits detected the shift from ministerial statements on Monday, 
replacing the word ``if'' with a more decisive ``when'' in references 
to the conditions for euro membership by Britain _ by far the biggest 
economic and political heavyweight of the four European Union nations 
outside the current euro club of 11 nations that will participate 
in using the new currency on Jan 1. Economists and political analysts 
said the shift could mark the beginnings of a campaign to prepare 
Britain's deeply divided public for a less contentious approach to 
the new currency. In recent years, the British economy has outpaced 
those of Continental Europe, provoking the argument among critics 
of monetary union that Britain has more to lose than gain from joining 
in the euro. But ``with the economic outlook worsening for cyclical 
reasons, this splendid isolation is no longer looking so splendid,'' 
said Holger Schmieding, senior economist with Merrill Lynch, and adding, 
``That should mean that British public opinion should become a bit 
more euro-friendly.'' Indeed, the chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon 
Brown, reduced the government's forecast Tuesday for 1999 growth to 
a range of 1 percent to 1.5 percent from about 2.5 percent. At issue 
is what Brown on Monday called a ``national change-over plan'' to 
be published in January setting out the practical steps for Britain 
to join the euro at a later date. Previously, the government had insisted 
that no decision be made before a referendum after the next national 
election, which will most likely be in mid-2002. While Brown did not 
modify that timetable, he said the government of Prime Minister Tony 
Blair wanted to prepare for joining in euro participation before the 
proposed referendum. ``This government has decisively and unambiguously 
put this country on a new road of constructive engagement with Europe,'' 
he told British business leaders at a meeting in Birmingham. ``We 
will set out the stage-by-stage procedures that will need to be followed. 
We will spell out the practical implications of changing to the euro, 
and we will give new advice to companies on the way to take forward 
their preparations.'' Peter Mandelson, the trade and industry secretary, 
said: ``It would be economic lunacy for the sake of Euro-skeptic ideology 
to marginalize Britain on the sidelines of what should be its own 
market. We have made clear that we will join the single currency when 
it is in Britain's economic interests to do so.'' The remarks had 
little effect on the market, with the pound already well down from 
highs earlier this year against the German mark, the key European 
currency. The pound was quoted Tuesday at 2.75 marks, compared with 
3.10 marks at its strongest level several months ago. Part of the 
pound's strength was ascribed by dealers to its role as a potential 
hedge against the euro. But the issue remains deeply divisive, with 
the opposition Conservatives demanding a much longer delay before 
a referendum, while the bulk of British business is in favor of joining 
in the new currency. Even on the current schedule, Britain will be 
outside the euro zone not only in January, when it goes into use in 
electronic business _ including huge euro-denominated stock, bond 
and derivatives markets _ but also when euro notes and coins enter 
circulation in January 2002. And some economists expressed puzzlement 
on Tuesday at reports that Brown was considering a 40-month gap between 
announcing a referendum and introducing euro notes and coins _ a schedule 
that could delay full British membership until 2005, later than many 
financial institutions here had expected. ``I think the way we look 
at it is that the government has decided that it's the right thing 
to do and it's just a question of time after a referendum,'' said 
David Mackie, an economist at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. ``But I'm a bit 
puzzled. The government gives the impression that it's a done deal, 
but they also give the impression that a pretty long timetable is 
needed.'' The issue has touched off heated debate. For instance, The 
Sun tabloid _ a staunch and powerful opponent of the euro _ characterized 
Brown and Mandelson as ``euro fanatics'' in an article Tuesday _ echoing 
assertions by Tories that the Labor government was seeking to stampede 
Britons into supporting the single currency without proper debate. 
By contrast, many business leaders at the Birmingham meeting urged 
the government to go further and set a date for joining, complaining 
that official vagueness made it hard to plan for the euro's introduction. 
``We believe our members very much support joining the single currency, 
but we are concerned that there is not enough leadership given by 
the government in terms of preparation by business for the euro,'' 
said Sir Clive Thompson, president of the Confederation of British 
Industry, the influential employers' group.
