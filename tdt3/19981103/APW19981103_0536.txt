Lawmakers on Tuesday failed to approve constitutional amendments that 
would have allowed President Nelson Mandela to promptly announce a 
date for South Africa's second all-race election. Because discussion 
on the amendments hit a snag, naming a date for the 1999 election 
will only occur next year at the earliest, when parliament reconvenes. 
As currently written, the 1996 constitution does not allow Mandela 
to declare an election date before the five-year mandate of his government 
runs out in April. The election must be held within the following 
three months. Lawmakers of all parties want to change the law to allow 
the date to be announced sooner, giving election organizers more time 
to organize the balloting and allowing politicians more time for campaigning. 
However, discussions snagged on a clause that would shift the power 
to call local elections in South Africa's nine regions from provincial 
heads to the president. The ruling African National Congress supports 
the change, saying it allows both national and local elections to 
be held on the same day, while opposition parties see it as an erosion 
of provincial rights. A committee dealing with the amendments decided 
to postpone further discussion on the issue until parliament reconvenes 
in February. Parliament adjourned in September but was in special 
session this week to consider legislation it didn't manage to attend 
to during the normal term. Unless the constitution is amended, the 
earliest Mandela can call elections is on April 30, according to his 
office.
