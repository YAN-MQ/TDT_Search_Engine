In January 1986, Ian Gibson received a message he had awaited for 
years: Salvador Dali was ready to see him. An Irish-born author, Gibson 
was writing a biography of Federico Garcia Lorca, the Andalusian poet, 
and Dali had finally agreed to talk about his intimate friendship 
with Garcia Lorca, forged during their school days in Madrid. Gibson 
sped to the Teatre-Museu Dali in the Catalan town of Figueras. He 
was led to an imposing chamber with an interminably long red carpet. 
At its end was the celebrated Surrealist, bedecked in a white silk 
cloak, perched on a throne. But Dali, 81, was hardly in shape for 
an interview. ``He was a sack of bones,'' Gibson recalls. ``His eyes 
were vacant and his body was terrible to behold. It was awkward and 
anguishing. He had these tubes up his nose, and he couldn't articulate.'' 
Still, says Gibson: ``I couldn't but be awed. I was suddenly in the 
presence of this myth. I've interviewed thousands of people, but none 
affected me like this.'' ``I wouldn't be so awed now, I have to say,'' 
he adds. ``But I was awed then.'' Though this was Gibson's only meeting 
with the artist, who died in 1989, he went on to know him all too 
well. He spent six years working on an 800-page biography, ``The Shameful 
Life of Salvador Dali,'' which was published here this month by Norton. 
When the book was released in London a year ago, most critics praised 
Gibson's approach, citing his sensible focus on Dali's early years 
and his unflinching look at the artist's progressive debauchery and 
corruption. ``The problem with Dali is that he's an objectionable 
human being,'' says Gibson, a robust man of 59 with a graying mop 
of reddish curls. ``We're talking about someone who never developed 
emotionally. It worked well when he was young and fit. But not later. 
The mask fell off.'' The title of Gibson's Dali biography, a twist 
on the artist's 1942 memoir, ``The Secret Life of Salvador Dali,'' 
signals Gibson's predominant theme: that a man infamous for his exhibitionistic 
antics was, at heart, timid, guilt-ridden and sexually repressed. 
``He writes about it himself in `The Secret Life,' '' says Gibson. 
``It's there more frankly than in any Spanish autobiography.'' Yet 
as Gibson acknowledges, ``The Secret Life'' is hardly a historical 
document; it is a novelistic approach to autobiography by an artist 
consciously trying to create his own myth. How, then, to determine 
what is fact and what is fantasy? ``It's a feeling for the text itself,'' 
says Gibson, who went back to the unpublished French original. ``And 
comparing it with what's in other sources. I tried to be skeptical. 
But every so often I probably lowered my guard.'' Those other sources 
include correspondence, like letters between Dali and Andre Breton, 
not seen by other scholars, as well as parish and newspaper archives 
in Dali's native Catalonia. (Gibson taught himself Catalan to read 
them.) Among his discoveries were details about the suicide of Dali's 
paternal grandfather, an event that Salvador probably learned of when 
he was in his 20s, and that Gibson believes had a profound effect 
on him. ``It convinced me he was terrified of being paranoid,'' he 
says, citing Dali's famous dictum: ``The only difference between a 
madman and me is that I am not mad.'' Gibson attributes much of Dali's 
lifelong sense of shame to his sexual anxieties: about the size of 
his penis and about the fact that masturbation was virtually his only 
means to orgasm. ``Dali was the first serious artist in history ever 
to make onanism one of the principal themes of his work,'' Gibson 
writes in his book. While ``The Great Masturbator'' of 1929 is undoubtedly 
Dali's best-known work on the subject of self-satisfaction, Gibson 
believes that many other paintings from throughout the artist's career 
are variations on the same theme. He also speculates that Dali had 
resisted admitting the possibility that he might have had homosexual 
leanings, particularly toward Lorca, and that this was one reason 
he waited so long before giving an interview to Gibson about his relationship 
with the poet. Such anxieties came to the fore, Gibson writes, when 
Dali met his future wife, Gala, and worried that he would not be able 
to perform. Fortunately, though, the Russian-born Gala was open to 
mutual masturbation, which became the couple's preferred method of 
satisfaction. As the years passed, Gala found a series of successively 
younger lovers to satisfy her. Dali, meanwhile, directed both male 
and female members of the entourage that followed him between his 
principal haunts _ among them, Paris hotels and his seaside home in 
Cadaques _ in erotic games for his voyeuristic pleasure. Dali's orgies 
were not really orgiastic in the Dionysian sense,'' writes Gibson, 
``because he planned them down to the last detail and constantly intervened 
to tell the actors what to do, what to stop doing (he enjoyed interrupting 
them when they were just on the point of orgasm, for example) or how 
to do whatever they were doing better.'' If the milieu was sordid 
_ ``I didn't want to meet any more people involved with orgies,'' 
Gibson says _ the type of detective work involved is the author's 
specialty. A resident of Spain since 1978, he has made a career of 
examining some of the most complex and controversial episodes in the 
country's recent history, notably at the time of its Civil War. The 
first of his 12 books, on the death of Lorca at the hands of Fascist 
soldiers in Granada in 1936, was banned by Franco's government when 
it was released in Spain in 1971. But by the time the first volume 
of his Lorca biography came out in 1985, the Socialists were in power 
and Gibson became a full-fledged literary celebrity, a familiar presence 
on television talk shows and in the daily press. ``Ian is popular 
for two reasons,'' says his friend Tom Burns, a British-born, half-Spanish 
journalist who has written several books on modern Spain. ``One is 
that he has a natural empathy for Spain. He takes life with both hands 
and enjoys it. The other is the intelligent way he has been able to 
research and write about Spanish ghosts. Spaniards are still uneasy 
about fellow Spaniards reporting their own history. Ian has explained 
Lorca, for instance, to Spaniards in a way that Spaniards themselves 
couldn't have done.'' Gibson's star faded a bit when the conservative 
government came to power in 1996. But by then, he had already fled 
the limelight by moving from Madrid to Restabal, a whitewashed town 
near Granada with a stunning view of the Sierra Nevada. The villa 
he shares with his wife, Carole (who edits his books), is framed by 
a fragrant tangle of orange and lemon trees; the couple also cultivate 
olives, pomegranates and almonds. Out back is a swimming pool built 
with the proceeds of Gibson's recent sale (for what he says was ``a 
modest sum'') of his Lorca archive to the Lorca Casa-Museo in Fuente 
Vaqueros, the poet's birthplace. ``I call it the Federico Garcia Lorca 
memorial pool,'' he says. Brought up in a Methodist family in Dublin, 
Gibson got hooked on Spain during a summer course in Madrid after 
his freshman year at Trinity College, where he studied French and 
Spanish. He planned to move abroad, as his idol James Joyce did, but 
instead, in 1963, he married Carole, his college sweetheart. Two children 
soon followed. To support his family he took jobs teaching Spanish 
at the Queen's University in Belfast, and later at the University 
of London. In between, he made frequent trips to Spain to pursue his 
research on Lorca. Initially his investigations concerned the folk 
sources of Lorca's poetry in and around the Vega of Granada. But literature 
soon paled beside what he was hearing about Spain's Civil War. ``I 
met so many people who suffered,'' he says. ``It engaged my missionary 
zeal.'' Years later, his Lorca book became the subject of ``Death 
in Granada,'' a movie about Lorca's death starring Andy Garcia. When 
it was released last year, it was not well received on either side 
of the Atlantic. ``It just wasn't the film one had envisaged,'' Gibson 
says diplomatically. ``Critics thought some elements were a bit corny.'' 
So did some of his admirers. ``Foreigners have a certain sort of tendency 
to idealize Spain, and Ian sometimes falls into that trap,'' Burns 
says. ``That is something that Spaniards resent quite a lot.'' Now 
that he is finished with Dali, Gibson has returned to a project he 
began 20 years ago, a study of Henry Spencer Ashbee, a 19th-century 
British millionaire, traveler, Hispanist, bibliophile and collector 
of erotica. Gibson hopes to prove that Ashbee wrote an infamous tome 
called, appropriately, ``My Secret Life,'' an account of erotic adventures 
in Victorian London that is thought to be a memoir. ``I've always 
been interested in secret lives,'' Gibson says. ``In what's beneath 
the surface.'' And when he finishes with Ashbee, he hopes to go to 
Greece. ``I'll take my computer with me and write a memoir of my life,'' 
he says. ``Maybe I'll fictionalize it.''
