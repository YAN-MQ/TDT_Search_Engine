After a week of bargaining and optimism, the two sides in the National 
Basketball Association's labor dispute are now faced with a sobering 
obstacle: they can't agree on the mechanics of a basic economic issue, 
a development that may soon lead to canceling more games. ``Right 
now, we appear to be dead in the water,'' the league's deputy commissioner, 
Russ Granik, said Tuesday night. ``Maybe something will happen tomorrow 
to put some wind back in the sails. But after Billy's comments on 
Monday, we seem to have a long way to go.'' Granik was referring to 
the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, who after a meeting 
between lawyers from the two sides indicated that the owners and players 
were ``far apart'' from reaching a compromise and belatedly starting 
the season. He said his gut feeling was that the season would begin 
in January. Hunter informed league officials on Monday that a full 
union bargaining team, comprising 15 to 20 players, would not be coming 
to New York for a hoped-for meeting. Instead, internal negotiating 
teams will meet at a midtown law firm Wednesday morning with the intention 
of trying to work out details of a proposed escrow system. That plan 
would go into effect after two or three years of using a luxury-tax 
system to curb salaries. In those escrow plan years, the sides would 
figure out at the end of each season how much revenue was devoted 
to player salaries. If a target number was exceeded, part of the escrow 
money would go all the 29 teams. Neither the owners nor the players 
would divulge details, but it appears that the issue has killed any 
progress toward agreement on a mechanism to divide revenues. ``Without 
going into specifics, the NBA just dug in, and they want more,'' Hunter 
said. ``They're not satisfied with the concessions we've made. The 
more I put out there, the sweeter the deal gets for them. That's what 
this is about right now.'' The larger issue is total revenue distribution; 
the players want to earn 60 percent of basketball-related income while 
the owners are offering a 50-50 share. After an unproductive exchange 
Monday over how an escrow system would work, the two sides are concerned 
that talks may break off soon after they start Wednesday. ``We felt 
like we were getting somewhere, but right now we are back to square 
one,'' Granik said.
