Senator John Glenn says being back in space again has reinforced his 
religious faith and his wish for peace on Earth. The 77-year-old senator 
told a news conference from the Shuttle Discovery Monday that if everyone 
could see Earth from where he is, people might be more peaceful than 
they have been in the past. The senator also expressed hope his mission 
will benefit all people over age 65. Mr. Glenn, the oldest man ever 
launched into space, is conducting experiments to study the aging 
process.
