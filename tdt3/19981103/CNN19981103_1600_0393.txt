A prostitute in Cleveland, Ohio, has gone on television to tell clients 
he has HIV. A judge ordered Tony brown to make the announcement, after 
he pleaded guilty to attempted soliciting. The judge said brown admitted 
being sexually active since he found out he had HIV, six months ago. 
She says brown admitted telling only some of his clients. In the broadcast 
from jail yesterday, brown urged his clients to contact the county 
health department immediately.
