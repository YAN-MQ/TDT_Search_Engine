the side, and the leader... Our mystery city has played host to this 
famous horse race for nearly 140 years. Today, to take the first prize 
was more than $11/2 million. ...In fifth spot, Gul Geery, then Dara 
Zary, Persian Pants off the track... Besides today's big race, the

boom. A century earlier, the city was the center of another boom, 
the Australian Gold Rush, so what's the name of our city down under 
and its famous race? Hold your horses. The answer will be along in
