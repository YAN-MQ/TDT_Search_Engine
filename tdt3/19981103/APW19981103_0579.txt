A Spanish judge filed an extradition request Tuesday that seeks to 
bring former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet from London to 
face charges of genocide, terrorism and torture in Spain. Judge Baltasar 
Garzon, whose earlier detention order resulted in Pinochet's arrest 
in London on Oct. 16, sent his extradition request to the Justice 
Ministry, which in turn could present it to a Cabinet meeting Friday, 
sources close to the judge told reporters. Although eager not to upset 
political and economic ties with Chile, Spanish Prime Minister Jose 
Maria Aznar has promised his Cabinet will not block a request for 
extradition. The government has until Nov. 25 _ Pinochet's 83rd birthday 
_ to pass the extradition on to London. Garzon pushed ahead with his 
bid to bring Pinochet to trial after Spain's National Court ruled 
Friday that its judges were competent to investigate human rights 
crimes committed in Chile and Argentina when military juntas ruled 
in the 1970s and 1980s. Pinochet was recovering from back surgery 
in London when arrested. England's High Court later ruled that the 
arrest was illegal as the former Chilean dictator was entitled to 
diplomatic immunity. The retired general was subsequently released 
on bail but remains under police guard pending an appeal before a 
panel of judges from the House of Lords that is expected to begin 
deliberating Wednesday. If the panel upholds the immunity decision, 
Pinochet would be freed and any extradition request from Spain would 
be futile. Also Tuesday, representatives of some 40 political and 
social organizations were to hand in a letter of protest to the British 
Embassy in Madrid call on British authorities to facilitate Pinochet's 
trial in Spain. Pinochet cannot be prosecuted in Chile because he 
is a senator for life, a job created for him in a constitution he 
steered to enactment. More than 3,000 people disappeared or were killed 
during Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship which began with a bloody 
coup against the elected government of President Salvador Allende.
