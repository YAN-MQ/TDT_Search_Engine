And finally from us, a reminder for us as well as you, that it's not 
always over until it's really over. Remember those three little words, 
Dewey beats truman. In 1948, President Harry truman was desperate 
for votes. In the last days of campaign, he made 350 different stops. 
Lots of people yelled out "give 'em hell, Harry." But the polls said 
he was too far behind the republican challenger, governor Tom Dewey 
of New York. Americans went to bed that election night 50 years ago 
believing it was dewey in a landslide. So why was Harry truman smiling 
so as he held up the first edition of "the chicago tribune?" The press 
had too much faith in the polls. The polls were very primitive then, 
and they were wrong. In this business, as in politics -- we try not 
to forget.
