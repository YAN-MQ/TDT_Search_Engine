Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said Tuesday he had authorized talks 
with groups linked to the militant Basque ETA separatists, marking 
the first time his government has taken steps to negotiate an end 
to the 30-year conflict. ``There are news reports that I have authorized 
contacts. It's true,'' Aznar said upon his return from a trip to London. 
The contacts would be through the Basque National Liberation Movement, 
a loose grouping of ETA and other militant separatist organizations, 
a spokesman for Aznar's office said on customary condition of anonymity. 
``The contacts, that have not happened up until now, will take place 
with the go-betweens of ETA's world,'' the spokesman said. ``We cannot 
say anything yet about the how, who and when.'' The official government 
spokesman, Josep Pique, told reporters that the contacts were aimed 
at exploring possibilities opened up by the cease-fire, ``to find 
out whether (ETA) is really willing to give up violence for good.'' 
ETA ushered in the Basque peace process two months ago when it declared 
an indefinite cease-fire in its campaign for a Basque homeland straddling 
northern Spain and southern France. Groups close to ETA said the truce 
was modeled on the Northern Irish process that led to last April's 
peace accord and urged the government to promote a negotiated settlement 
as British Prime Minister Tony Blair had done in Northern Ireland. 
Irish republican leader Gerry Adams visited the Basque region last 
month and urged Aznar's government to respond positively to the cease-fire 
by opening negotiations for peace. A group of Basque political parties 
and organizations known as the Irish Forum secured Adams' backing 
for its proposal, known as the Lizarra Declaration, for all-party 
peace talks, including the government and ETA. The government rejected 
the proposal at the time. Extensive peace talks between a Spanish 
government and ETA have not taken place since 1989 when the Socialist 
party was in power. The failure of these talks, held in Algeria, was 
subsequently used to justify hard-line policies ruling out a negotiated 
solution to the conflict. Aznar's tough stand against ETA _ including 
the arrest of Basque militants, the dismantling of a major ETA financial 
network and the closing of an allied daily newspaper _ is believed 
to have been a factor in bringing about the cease-fire. The Irish 
Forum includes Herri Batasuna, the political coalition linked to ETA, 
as well as moderate Basque nationalist parties, labor unions and civic 
groups. Responding to Aznar's announcement Tuesday, Herri Batasuna 
issued a statement stressing ``the need for dialogue and negotiation 
as the only valid way to address the conflict''. ``We are faced with 
an historic opportunity that requires vision and courage,'' the group 
said. The government's, 15th graf pvs
