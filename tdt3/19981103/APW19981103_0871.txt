Adil Mattar scored in the 83rd minute to give the United Arab Emirates 
a 3-2 victory Tuesday over Oman in a preliminary match of the the 
six-nation Gulf Cup. It was UAE's second win following its 1-0 victory 
over host Bahrain in the opening match of the tournament. The other 
teams participating are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. UAE took the 
lead in the 37th minute when forward Adil Mohammed deceived the Omani 
defense. Ali Thani followed in 57th minute to give the Emirates its 
second goal. Oman's Majdi Shaban brought the scores level 2-2, scoring 
the first goal in the 75th minute with a powerful shot taken almost 
19yards from the goal post. His second goal came from a penalty shot 
awarded to him after he was yanked to the ground by a UAE defender. 
Though the Omani team had a better attack they could not execute well 
near the post. Mattar brilliantly controlled the ball with a header 
and then kicked the ball in the center from the right side of the 
goal to give UAE the winning goal in the 83rd minute. Tuesday's victory 
also made UAE the only side to record two wins so far in the tournament.
