An estimated 7,000 people in Honduras and Nicaragua were killed in 
last week's storms. Hundreds of thousands of people are homeless. 
Honduran President Carlos Flores described a scene of death and desolation 
as he appealed for help. Pope John Paul also urged international aid 
to help Central America. Here in Washington, President Clinton pledged 
U.S. support and says $3.5 million in emergency assistance has already 
been spent. Mr. Clinton talked about the situation at the White House. 
These nations are our neighbors. They all have people who are part 
of our country now. They are both close to our shores and close to 
our hearts. We must do whatever we can to help, and we will. Already, 
we have provided almost $3.5 million to air lift food, plastic sheeting, 
water containers, and blankets into the region. We provided military 
aircraft and helicopters to get supplies to isolated areas and deployed 
a disaster assistance response to each affected country. The greatest 
destruction is being reported in Honduras where an estimated 5,000 
people died. Nicaragua authorities estimate 2100 people died there, 
including 1500 killed by the Casita volcano mudslides that swept away 
several northeastern villages.
