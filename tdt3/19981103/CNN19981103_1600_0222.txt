Because many races are hinging on the flow of traffic to and from 
the polling booths, campaigns have been in high gear trying to get 
out the vote. Bill Schneider looks at those efforts, and whether they 
promise to be successful. a midterm election is like a cheap circus. 
Ancient elephants, toothless tigers, chattering monkeys, a couple 
of high-wire acts and lots of clowns. But no main event. In the 1992 
presidential election, 52% of voting-age Americans cast a Ballot. 
At the 1994 midterm, however, only 37% showed up. No main event. In 
fact, turnout in midterm elections has been dropping since 1962. Voters 
are getting scarcer, and therefore more valuable. This year, it'll 
be even harder to get them out. why? Because they're happy. Two-thirds 
of Americans feel good about the economy. People tend to vote when 
something is bothering them. And this year, nothing much seems to 
be bothering the American public, not even the impending impeachment 
of the president. Another reason turnout is crucial is the two parties 
are so evenly matched. Republicans have an 11-seat margin in the house 
-- the smallest majority for either party since 1954. Close elections 
put a premium on getting your side out to vote. That's why we're seeing 
so many Negative ads this year. The best way to get your core supporters 
out is to alarm them. "If you don't vote, the forces of evil will 
get elected." I just want to suggest to you that you cannot leave 
$1 trillion near Al gore and Teddy Kennedy -- -- without them spending 
it. That kind of Negative campaigning may turn out your core supporters, 
but it's totally out of sync with the mood of most Americans. Most 
people are pretty satisfied and they don't understand why politicians 
keep trying to alarm them. That's why the public feels so disconnected 
from politics this year. The Negative campaigns have nothing to do 
with the way most Americans feel. Bill Schneider, CNN, Atlanta.
