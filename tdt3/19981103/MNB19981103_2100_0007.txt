Welcome back, 6:00 at night in Los Angeles. In New York, it's 9:00 
P.M. New York is about to send a new man to the U.S. senate, Alfonse 
D'Amato, is out. There is a new senator-elect, Charles Schumer has 
defeated Alfonse D'Amato who has been a senator for a long time from 
the state of New York. Schumer, 47, a tireless campaigner. Said he 
never met a television camera he didn't like or wasn't willing to 
chase around the block. He ran a very hard campaign. The air war in 
this one got dirty toward the end. Alfonse D'Amato, kind of the son 
of the vast political long island machine of a man named Joseph margiata 
who ran things, brought a lot of young people up through the system. 
Alfonse D'Amato who came in as part of the Reagan revolution will 
be leaving the U.S. Senate replaced by Charles Schumer, a Brooklyn 
democrat from New York, recipient of a lot of last-minute campaigning 
from the White House. We are going to go to both headquarters shortly.
