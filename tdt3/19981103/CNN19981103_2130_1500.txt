On this election day, millions of Americans are exercising their constitutional 
right by not voting. Jeanne Moos examines the psyche of the nonvoter. 
When it comes to voting, most Americans drag their feet. We're looking 
for nonvoters. You got it. Well, that's me. I've never voted. Ever? 
Ever. Hey, there's nothing to fear behind the curtain of a voting 
booth. It's not the shower scene from "psycho." That's it! After the 
dirty D'Amato/Schumer Senate race, this news day cartoon suggests 
voters could use a shower. Some nonvoters seem haunted by guilt. She 
keeps telling me I should vote. It's my duty to vote. Other nonvoters 
claim they abstain for philosophical reasons. They all stink. All 
the candidates are horrible. They're all full of crap. Some express 
belligerence. Others plead ignorance. I didn't know today was election 
day. Yeah. It was? Yeah. Oh, well, I guess next year. And if you think 
he must have been living on another planet, hey, outer space is no 
excuse. Ask John Glenn. And I'm proud to say that all of us on this 
flight voted by absentee ballot before we left. The authors of a study 
on nonvoters divide them into five main groups -- The doers, the unplugs, 
the irritables, the don't knows and the alienateds. I think you might 
be an irritable. Are you an irritable? Yep, I'm irritable. I'm not 
unplugged, not irritable, not don't know, I'm a doer. a doer who doesn't. 
Like right now, if there's a polling place right here to vote, I'd 
vote. But I have to go out of my way. I think you're a new category. 
I think it's called, lazy? Not all nonvoters are guilt-ridden. Did 
you vote today? no. Our favorite group of nonvoters are the don't 
knows. You don't know? I don't know. I don't know. a don't know, they 
tend to answer don't know when asked anything about politics. Right. 
You know who's running for the New York Senate seat? no. You're a 
don't know. Congratulations. A true nonvoter digs in his heels and 
says, "I'm not going in there." Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
