On a darkened stage, Marco Greco breathed slowly, rolled his shoulders 
and prepared to transport himself back to 1975 and Arthur Avenue. 
A spotlight vanquished the void, rendering his face into a chiaroscuro 
mask of a wide-eyed child. ``Pop,'' he said in a pleading little boy 
voice, ``I don't like to make the mozzarella. I just like to eat it.'' 
He turned slightly to the side and assumed the cocky, tilted-head 
stance of an older man. ``Hey, no complain!'' boomed the heavily accented 
voice. ``Act like a man. Always treat the mozzarella like a bella 
femina. In life, baby, you be good to the mozzarella and the mozzarella 
be good to you.'' This is the stuff of Greco's life, in which he mastered 
the art of making cheese at Mike's Deli, the Bronx landmark his father 
has run for decades at the Arthur Avenue Market. Now he has turned 
it into art yet again in ``Behind the Counter with Mussolini,'' a 
one-man play about fathers and sons, dictators and dreams. At the 
heart of the piece, which opens next week at the Theater at St. Peter's 
Church on East 54th Street, is the struggle between an immigrant father 
who works like a horse to live like a man, and his son, who is drawn 
to another world beyond the deli counter. It is not one of those I-Hate-My-Parents 
psychodramas. The play, like Greco's life, is a loving realization 
of the strength he drew from the frenzied marketplace where shoppers 
shouted and haggled with countermen for the best deals on ``pro-SHOOT'' 
and ``mooz-a-REL.'' His father's friends, food salesmen with giveaway 
nicknames like Joe Bananas and Nicky Fish, are there. So, too, is 
the more complicated figure of Il Duce. ``When we were growing up 
my father had a picture of Mussolini behind the counter,'' Marco said. 
``It's still hanging. We always thought it was Uncle Fred, who was 
a sergeant in the U.S. Army. For me, it became a way to use Mussolini 
as a metaphor. Who, at some time in life, has not had the feeling 
their parents are dictators?'' The assumption growing up under his 
stern father was that he would go into the family business. In the 
play, his character, Armando, became the mozzarella king who resists 
any idea of leaving the neighborhood. He spends time with his friends, 
who talk and act as if they were copping lines from the ``How to Be 
a Guido Handbook,'' replete with shorthand references to ``The Godfather,'' 
parts one and two. Life was ver-ry, ver-ry nice. But Marco, like Armando, 
began to change when he went to college. ``I met the first girl who 
wasn't planning her wedding or worrying about hair gel,'' Marco said. 
``And I had an anthropology teacher who was something else to look 
at.'' What she taught him to look at was his culture. Suddenly, the 
customers at the deli became real to him in a way he had never noticed 
before. He learned their stories. He also began to consider leaving 
the deli. The character in the play goes through Guid-tox and starts 
wearing corduroy pants with cuffs,'' he said. ``When your universe 
gets bigger, all of a sudden you can look at life very critically. 
But when you spend all this time watching your father work, doing 
it for you, it's not that easy to walk away.'' Until somebody swiped 
a salami. Marco ran after the thief, his father also in pursuit. They 
caught him on Crescent Avenue, where father and son began to yell 
at each other. ``In the process of arguing with my father, I grabbed 
the salami and whacked the guy twice in the head,'' Marco said. ``There 
is no pride in beating a guy with a salami. I couldn't believe I had 
come to this over a $20 piece of meat. We were no longer the immigrants 
off the boat desperate for two cents. What we did was vent the frustration 
between father and son.'' Marco went to study drama, and later he 
started a theater troupe in the Bronx. He also traveled to the New 
World called Hollywood. He had some roles, but they were the tired 
bits that the masters of pop culture reserve for young Italians. Instead, 
he returned home and started writing his play. In doing so, he applied 
one of is father's lessons: Work is good. ``I'm scared,'' he said 
during a break in rehearsal. ``If this pleases the critics, my life 
can change drastically.'' One critic has already approved. His father. 
``By himself, he discovered I gave him something good,'' Michael Greco 
said. ``The play, it's 100 percent true. That's why he makes me a 
proud father. He finally found out who is Michael Greco.'' No complaints, 
baby.
