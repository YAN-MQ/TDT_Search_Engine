President Clinton watched the election returns roll in Tuesday night 
much the same way that he had campaigned: from the White House, in 
the company of loyal friends and quietly. Although he has bitterly 
complained in the last two days about the political culture of Washington, 
the president remained sequestered with his wife, Hillary, here rather 
than venture into a country that was molding his political fate. ``None 
of us know what is going to happen,'' Clinton said Tuesday morning. 
When asked if this election, with impeachment hearings looming, was 
a referendum on whether he should stay in office, the president replied 
that it was ``a referendum on all the hopes of the American people 
for the future and their assessment of the present condition.'' Clinton 
monitored the returns for part of the evening in the office of John 
D. Podesta, his chief of staff, and telephoned several Democrats across 
the country as they won or lost their campaigns. Hillary Rodham Clinton 
spent the evening watching the movie ``Beloved'' in the White House 
theater. Like birthdays for others, elections have served as signposts 
in Clinton's life, and he seemed to be in a philosophical mood Tuesday. 
Answering a handful of questions before a lengthy meeting with his 
economic advisers, he seized on a reporter's observation that Election 
Day marked his ``sixth anniversary.'' ``They have been six very good 
years, very good years for our country,'' Clinton said. ``And as I 
tell everybody around here, even the bad days are good.'' Clinton 
spoke Tuesday with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico about storm 
damage in Central America, and with Prime Minister Tony Blair of England 
about Iraq. But though his aides said the president seemed focused 
on such matters, they said he was quite nervous about the election. 
His political director, Craig Smith, regularly updated him throughout 
the day, and the president placed several calls to friends around 
the country, asking, in the words of one adviser, ``Whaddaya hear, 
whaddaya know, whaddaya think?'' ``He's desperately worried about 
the money,'' the adviser said, referring to a $110 million Republican 
Party advantage in fund-raising in this election. ``All the late information 
was good, all the polling and the anecdotal stuff, but they've got 
so much more money, and he's just haunted by how much more money they 
have.'' Early this year, some White House aides speculated that Democrats 
might actually gain seats in the midterm elections. But such talk 
faded as the Monica Lewinsky scandal intensified this summer. Now 
they are emphasizing that money, rather than any presidential dalliance 
and lies, gave the Republicans a powerful advantage. In addition to 
a last-minute push for help from donors, Clinton and other Democrats 
worked hard in recent days to encourage black voters _ among the most 
reliable Democrats _ to go to the polls. That strategy appeared to 
be paying off, White House aides said Tuesday. Through a series of 
recent interviews with news organizations oriented toward black and 
Hispanic Americans, Clinton repeatedly urged his listeners to vote, 
warning that Republicans would obstruct policies beneficial to minorities. 
In a measure of how much his political position has recovered since 
his acknowledgment of an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton tried to 
turn the scandal to his advantage, suggesting that Republicans who 
were focused on it could not govern effectively. The president presented 
himself as the victim of relentless political enemies obsessed with 
scandal, in an interview broadcast Monday night on the cable network 
BET. ``There's a sort of a permanent political class in Washington 
that tends to thrive on such matters because they're not affected 
by what I came here to do,'' Clinton said. He reeled off policy goals, 
like raising the minimum wage, that he said did not matter to such 
people. ``There is a group in America where the acquisition of political 
power is more important than the purpose for which it's used,'' he 
said. Clinton said some of his opponents never thought they would 
have another Democratic president in their lifetimes. ``The ones that 
are consumed with personal animosity toward me or toward Hillary,'' 
he said, ``I think are just angry because they thought they and their 
crowd would always be able to drive up to the West Wing to work every 
day.'' He said that he was ``not even angry at them anymore,'' adding, 
``I'm just sorry.'' In response to a question, Clinton said the elections 
of 1992 and 1996 were the most important of his career. But this election, 
he said, is ``very important to me because it will determine how much 
I can do for the American people in the next two years.'' Clinton 
took part in few campaign-style rallies this year. His aides said 
they decided on a Rose-Garden strategy well before Clinton was enveloped 
by scandal. In 1994, they said, sending Clinton out to campaign seemed 
to hurt candidates' chances, and previous presidents seemed to do 
little good for their parties' candidates in off-year elections. Instead, 
Clinton raised money for Democrats and doggedly highlighted a select 
handful of issues, even as the furor over Ms. Lewinsky seemed to be 
drowning him out. Other Democrats picked up on those same themes _ 
shoring up Social Security, raising the minimum wage, modernizing 
classrooms _ with a unanimity not seen since 1992, White House aides 
said.
