A French court on Tuesday relayed a temporary arrest warrant for former 
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to British authorities, judicial 
officials said. The temporary arrest order is the final step necessary 
before France can officially ask for Pinochet's extradition, the officials 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. On Monday, French Judge 
Roger Le Loire issued an international arrest warrant for Pinochet 
on charges of ``sequestration followed by torture.'' That step was 
also required for France to ask Britain to hand over Pinochet. Last 
week, a lawyer representing three French families whose relatives 
disappeared in Chile after Pinochet took power in 1973 filed a complaint 
with a French court, asking for Pinochet's extradition to face charges 
of crimes against humanity. Pinochet, 82, was arrested in a central 
London hospital Oct. 16 after undergoing back surgery. England's High 
Court ruled last week that Pinochet was immune from prosecution as 
a former head of state. He was granted bail, but remains under police 
guard at another hospital in north London. British prosecutors _ acting 
on behalf of a Spanish magistrate seeking the former Chilean dictator's 
extradition on allegations of murder, kidnapping and torture during 
his 17-year rule _ have until the end of the business day Monday to 
appeal formally. Switzerland has also requested Pinochet's arrest 
and extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture. A report 
by Chile's democratically elected government says some 3,000 people 
disappeared during Pinochet's rule.
