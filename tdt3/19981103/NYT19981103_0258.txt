Two trials are under way in this suddenly fractious Southeast Asian 
country. One is in a drab Kuala Lumpur courtroom, where Malaysia's 
former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, is fighting charges of 
corruption and sex-related crimes. The other is on the streets outside, 
where students, taxi drivers and politicians are treating the case 
as a referendum on Anwar's former boss, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 
``There is a crisis of confidence here,'' said Lim Kit Siang, the 
most prominent opposition leader. ``If public confidence in the system 
of justice is shaken, Mahathir's position will definitely be eroded.'' 
Prosecutors began presenting their case Tuesday, saying Anwar, who 
was dismissed by Mahathir in September and later arrested, had engaged 
in ``sexual misbehavior'' and then obstructed a police investigation 
of his conduct. Their first witness was a former director of the Special 
Branch of the Malaysian police. Prosecutors say Anwar asked the official 
to obtain a retraction from a man who had said Anwar had had a homosexual 
relationship with him. In Malaysia homosexual acts are a crime. Anwar 
has pleaded not guilty to 10 charges of corruption and sodomy. If 
convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison. The lurid nature 
of the charges and Anwar's prominence _ he was long regarded as Mahathir's 
successor _ has turned this case into a national obsession. With the 
news media carrying heavily sanitized reports of the trial, the public's 
hunger for information is ravenous. Outside the courthouse a crowd 
of 30 people surrounded a reporter, pleading for a detailed account 
of the Tuesday's events. Several said they were doubtful that Anwar 
would receive a fair trial, given that he had been ousted after a 
fierce power struggle with Mahathir. ``I would say the odds are 60-40 
against him,'' said a young man who would not give his name because, 
he said, plainclothes police officers were watching the gathering. 
``We want to show the world that we support him.'' A woman standing 
next to the man furtively lifted a traditional Malay shawl to show 
off a white T-shirt emblazoned with Anwar's picture. ``We don't like 
Mahathir,'' she said, ``but we are scared to talk about it.'' As on 
Monday, supporters of Anwar were corralled behind police barricades 
under the gaze of troops wielding automatic weapons, truncheons and 
tear-gas canisters. A water-cannon truck was parked in front of the 
High Court Tuesday morning to discourage demonstrations. Protests 
against Mahathir, which reached a peak two weeks ago when dozens of 
demonstrators clashed with the police on the streets of Kuala Lumpur, 
have been notably absent during the first days of the trial. People 
said they believed that would-be demonstrators had been scared off 
by police warnings. But they added that if the public came to believe 
the trial was unfair, crowds would again take to the streets. ``The 
underlying issues that brought people on the street are the same,'' 
said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of political science at the University 
of Malaya. ``The Anwar case, of course, but also the whole issue of 
the government and the man who sits at the apex of the government.'' 
The trouble is, Malaysians are getting a heavily edited version of 
events. After court adjourned on Monday, Anwar sharply criticized 
Mahathir and another top official in remarks to reporters. Most local 
papers, with the notable exception of The New Straits Times, did not 
report his comments. The cramped courtroom has raised further doubts 
about the handling of the trial. Several diplomats, including a representative 
of the U.S. embassy, were turned away on Monday, prompting the State 
Department spokesman, James Rubin, to say, ``We have serious concerns 
about what's going on there.'' The judge, Augustine Paul, also refused 
to grant observer status, which would guarantee seats, to human rights 
groups. A U.S. diplomat and a representative of Amnesty International 
did attend Tuesday's session. Still, although Anwar's lawyers were 
rebuffed again Tuesday in their efforts to have the case dismissed 
or delayed on a legal technicality, they said they had no complaints 
about the conduct of Paul. Mahathir has said nothing publicly about 
the trial, concentrating in a speech here on Monday on the global 
economy. As he has before, Mahathir pinned the blame for the Asian 
crisis on foreign currency traders, who he said ``are well on their 
way to bringing about a worldwide recession.''
