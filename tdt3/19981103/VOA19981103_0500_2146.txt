With the latest standoff in Iraq over United Nations weapon inspections, 
China is urging Iraq to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors 
as the quickest way to end the economic sanctions the U.N. Security 
Council has imposed on Baghdad. VOA's Roger Wilkison reports from 
Beijing that the Chinese foreign ministry is calling on all sides 
in Iraq's latest standoff with the weapons inspectors to exercise 
restraint. Foreign ministry spokesman Jubung Zao told reporters through 
an interpreter Tuesday that China is concerned about Iraq's decision 
over the weekend to suspend cooperation with the U.N. arms inspectors 
and monitors collectively known as UNSCOM. We express our concern 
and disquiet over this decision of Iraq and appeal to it to review 
its comprehensive cooperation with UNSCOM as soon as possible. Mr. 
Zao said that in exchange for Iraqi cooperation, the Security Council 
should move toward a review of the economic sanctions that it imposed 
on Baghdad eight years ago. Iraq should fully fulfill its relevant 
obligations. At the same time, the Security Council should make an 
objective and fair evaluation and conclusion of inspection work already 
done and gradually lift the sanctions on Iraq. After the Gulf War 
in 1991, the Security Council made lifting the sanctions contingent 
upon Baghdad's dismantling of suspect nuclear chemical and biological 
weapons programs. China has in the past urged an end to the sanctions 
which it says are taking a heavy toll on the Iraqi people. Iraq's 
latest decision to end contacts with UNSCOM has triggered suggestions 
by the United States and Britain that military retaliation may be 
one way to get Iraq to comply with Security Council directives. China 
has long opposed any such military action, and Mr. Zao called Tuesday 
for dialogue instead of confrontation to overcome the latest impasse. 
We hope the relevant parties can excise what is and endeavor to properly 
solve their differences and contradictions through dialogue and cooperation. 
Mr. Zao suggested that such an approach can lead to an early conclusion 
of arms inspections efforts and the lifting of sanctions against Iraq.
