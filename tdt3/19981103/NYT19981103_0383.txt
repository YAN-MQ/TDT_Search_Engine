NEW YORK _ H. Carl McCall, who climbed from an impoverished childhood 
to become the first black candidate elected to statewide office in 
New York, easily won re-election Tuesday to a second term as state 
comptroller. McCall, a 63-year-old Democrat, handily dispatched a 
challenge by Bruce Blakeman, a Republican who is majority leader of 
the Nassau County Legislature. McCall was first appointed to the Comptroller's 
post to fill a vacancy in 1993 and won a full term in 1994. Four years 
ago, McCall won a tight race against Herbert London, a New York University 
professor, surviving the Republican tide that lifted George Pataki 
to the State House. This year, McCall scared off potential challengers 
by amassing more than $5 million in campaign money and he did not 
face serious opposition. Blakeman, a 43-year-old lawyer who has been 
majority leader of the Nassau County Legislature since it was created 
in 1995, was selected to run against McCall during a telephone conference 
call among state Republican Party leaders last spring. The comptroller 
is the sole trustee of the state pension fund, which is worth about 
$100 billion and is one of the single largest pools of capital in 
the nation. McCall collected millions in campaign contributions from 
lawyers, real estate advisers and investment companies that do business 
with his office. The contributions do not violate state campaign finance 
laws. Still, Blakeman sought to make criticism of them the thrust 
of his bid for office. Polls, however, consistently showed McCall 
ahead by about 30 points, and the race received little attention. 
In addition, similar questions were raised about the fund-raising 
of prominent Republicans, including Gov. Pataki. In the final week, 
McCall's campaign spent $3.8 million on advertising and kept up a 
busy schedule of events. McCall had considered running against Pataki 
this year but was dissuaded by the governor's own aggressive fund-raising. 
By August 1997, Pataki had raised more than $9 million and McCall, 
saying he was content in his job as comptroller, announced he would 
seek re-election. At campaign stops, McCall repeatedly trumpeted his 
success in directing the investments of the pension fund, noting that 
under his stewardship the fund had nearly doubled to more than $100 
billion from $56 billion. He also described his conducting of various 
audits of state and local agencies, and said the audits had benefited 
the state on many issues, like education and health care. Blakeman 
pushed his close ties to Republican officials including Pataki and 
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and on the campaign trail he 
suggested that McCall, as a Democrat, could not be as effective with 
the Republican leaders. McCall, on his part, paid scant attention 
to his opponent and rarely, if ever, mentioned him.
