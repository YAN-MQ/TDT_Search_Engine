Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. On August 17th, President 
Clinton delivered what could very well be the most memorable speech 
of his presidency: his address to the public concerning his extramarital 
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. So much has 
been revealed about Bill Clinton, the president, but what about Bill 
Clinton, the man? I'm Carol Pearson. Clinton biographer David Maranis 
shares his knowledge Wednesday on "Talk to America." I hope you'll 
join me Wednesday at 17 hours universal time on "Talk to America."
