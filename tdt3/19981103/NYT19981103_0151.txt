Pricewise, Cetamura is near the lower end of the impressive wines 
produced by Badia a Coltibuono, the 1,000-year-old abbey and estate 
of the Stucchi-Prinetti family at Gaiole in Chianti. Roberto Stucchi, 
who studied oenology at the University of California, is the winemaker. 
Cetamura is a negociant wine; that is, a wine made from purchased 
grapes or from bulk wine made elsewhere and finished in the Badia 
cellars. The principal grape in this and other Chiantis is sangiovese. 
Cetamura is never a profound wine but, at its best, can be a light- 
to medium-bodied Chianti with good structure and lots of flavor. It 
is meant for easy current drinking. The 1996 vintage admirably supplies 
all the wine's best attributes and sells at a delightfully low price. 
In doing so, it joins other reasonably priced Chiantis whose ratio 
of price to quality should embarrass the producers of many California 
sangioveses.
