About 5,500 Russian officials are under investigation for taking bribes 
this year, and Russia's economic troubles are creating a breeding 
ground for corruption, the interior minister said Tuesday. ``A poverty-stricken 
official is always prone to crime,'' Sergei Stepashin told a news 
conference. He called for increasing salaries of police and other 
officials, sharply devalued by a steep dive of the Russian currency 
since the government stopped propping up the ruble in August. Russian 
police have undertaken a massive effort to combat graft, including 
corruption in its own ranks, but the problem has continued to plague 
the government, Stepashin said. ``We are especially concerned about 
corruption on the grassroots level, such as bribe-taking among traffic 
police and various small offices,'' he said. Stepashin urged the government 
to radically streamline the bureaucracy to reduce the opportunities 
for bribery. Last week, Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent liberal lawmaker 
and a presidential hopeful, caused an uproar when he said Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov's new government is as prone to corruption as its 
predecessors. On Monday, Yavlinsky specified his accusations in a 
letter sent to Primakov, urging him to investigate past business connections 
of several high-ranking Cabinet members and their lobbying efforts 
for business interests. Primakov criticized Yavlinsky for failing 
to provide evidence, but instructed his aides to investigate into 
the accusations and prepare a detailed response. The Prosecutor General's 
office, meanwhile, has ordered a preliminary investigation on possible 
libel charges against Yavlinsky over the allegations. Stepashin on 
Tuesday described Yavlinsky's accusations as a publicity effort and 
called on him to provide hard facts. Yavlinsky, in his turn, has said 
that he simply wanted to draw public attention to the problem and 
it remained up to police and prosecutors to collect specific evidence.
