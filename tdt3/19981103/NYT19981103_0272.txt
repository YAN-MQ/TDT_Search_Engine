New Orleans last week became the first city to sue firearms manufacturers 
for millions of dollars for the cost of violence involving guns, and 
several other cities are expected to follow in the next few months, 
city officials and gun control advocates say. The New Orleans suit 
is based on a claim of product liability, that the gun makers have 
failed to incorporate enough safety devices in their weapons, making 
them ``unreasonably dangerous.'' Other cities that are close to filing 
suits of their own are Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, with 
San Francisco and Dade County, Fla., also exploring the possibility. 
But under a new plan being put forward by Mayor Edward G. Rendell 
of Philadelphia, 30 to 60 cities might file suit in their state courts, 
all on the same day, at some point next year, he said in a telephone 
interview. The plan is under discussion by the United States Conference 
of Mayors, he said. ``The impact of so many cities filing suit all 
at once would be monumental for gun manufacturers,'' Rendell said. 
``They don't have the deep pockets of the tobacco industry, and it 
could bring them to the negotiating table a lot sooner'' so cities 
would not have to wait years for the outcome of trials, he added. 
The New Orleans suit, filed on Friday in state district court against 
15 gun manufacturers, seeks to recover ``millions of dollars'' that 
the city has spent to combat gun violence, including hiring more police, 
raising police pay, improving emergency trauma care and starting new 
youth programs, said Mayor Marc Morial. The legal action will be paid 
for by a group of prominent anti-tobacco lawyers led by Wendell Gauthier 
of New Orleans, in exchange for an agreement that they would receive 
20 percent of any settlement, or 30 percent of any damages award. 
The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in Washington, D.C., the group 
founded by Sarah Brady, the wife of James Brady, the former White 
House press secretary who was wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt 
on President Ronald Reagan, will serve as co-lead counsel and has 
helped devise the legal strategy for the suit. Morial said he decided 
to act after ``witnessing the awesome powers of intimidation of the 
gun lobby in the state legislature'' and then the recent gunshot killing 
of a gospel singer who was his friend. ``Someone needed to step up 
and break the ice,'' Morial said in a telephone interview. The gun 
industry may control legislatures around the country, Morial said, 
``but the beauty of the American legal system is that it levels the 
playing field,'' giving cities a chance in court to develop a new 
way to fight crime. ``We've done everything we can as a city'' to 
reduce handgun violence, Morial said. The homicide rate in New Orleans 
has dropped by more than 40 percent since 1994. But Morial said it 
was now time to try to force gun makers to produce safer products 
that could not be used so easily by juveniles or criminals. Rendell's 
position, however, represents a change. Earlier this year his legal 
staff prepared a lawsuit, but he put it on hold while he negotiated 
with gun manufacturers represented by the American Shooting Sports 
Council, a lobbying group. Rendell said he had hoped the talks would 
lead to quicker progress than litigation, but that he was now ``pessimistic'' 
because the firearms makers had failed to support state and federal 
legislation limiting buyers to one gun a month. ``That was the seminal 
test, and they failed it,'' Rendell said, saying they offered instead 
what he described as ``the usual excuses.'' Richard Feldman, the executive 
director of the American Shooting Sports Council, in Atlanta, said 
that the New Orleans' suit ``was just inevitable, too tempting, when 
you have a bunch of plaintiffs' lawyers sitting on fat settlements 
from the tobacco industry.'' Feldman said that the New Orleans suit 
``won't solve one murder, or won't stop one bad guy from taking a 
gun and using it against a citizen of New Orleans.'' The real problem 
with murders using guns, Feldman said, is that ``Society does not 
keep the people in prison it's supposed to keep in prison.'' Moreover, 
he said, the New Orleans suit was based on a faulty premise, ``alleging 
we have not used safety devices which have not been invented yet.'' 
``These mayors had better think carefully about the political liability 
they open themselves up to in their own backyard,'' Feldman said. 
The gun industry has the support of 80 percent of the American people, 
he claimed. ``Two can play this game.'' The suits in Philadelphia 
and Chicago are likely to be based on different legal theories than 
the product liability claim in New Orleans. Rendell said a major part 
of Philadelphia's suit would be to pursue the gun makers for creating 
a public nuisance, trying to recover the $58 million a year he estimates 
gun violence costs the city in excess police, court and jail expenses.
