A 72-year-old Croat woman suspected of torturing inmates in the country's 
most notorious World War II camp declared Tuesday the charges are 
groundless, her attorney said. Nada Sakic, who was extradited from 
Argentina on Monday, met with an investigative judge from the Zagreb 
district court, Mirjana Rigljan, in the first step toward determining 
whether she will be indicted for war crimes. Her husband Dinko, 76, 
is already imprisoned here, facing war crimes charges. Mrs. Sakic 
was extradited on a warrant accusing her of ``carrying out torture, 
inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as terror, intimidation and 
collective punishment of civilians,'' which led to the deaths of an 
unknown number of inmates. As a teen-ager, Mrs. Sakic allegedly was 
a guard from 1942-45 in the women's block in the Stara Gradiska camp, 
part of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex. Dinko Sakic, extradited 
from Argentina in June, is suspected of ordering, witnessing and participating 
in the war crimes committed in the Jasenovac camp he commanded between 
1942 and 1944. Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and antifascist 
Croats were killed at Jasenovac, the most notorious of more than 20 
concentration camps run by Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet state. 
After hearing the charges, Mrs. Sakic said she ``doesn't even want 
to respond to such false accusations,'' her attorney Branko Seric 
told reporters. ``She didn't want to present her defense because she 
thinks the charges are groundless,'' Seric said. Asked whether she 
thereby feels not guilty, he replied: ``Absolutely.'' The district 
court will now hear witnesses. Mrs. Sakic, who suffers from advanced 
Parkinson's disease, spent the night in Zagreb's main prison, where 
her husband also is imprisoned. But the two have not met, pending 
approval from prison authorities, Seric said. The Sakics married in 
late 1944, after apparently meeting each other through Maks Luburic, 
Nada's half-brother and Dinko Sakic's superior. Luburic was in charge 
of all World War II camps in Croatia. Some Croatian media claimed 
Nada was actually put into Stara Gradiska by Luburic, who wanted the 
young sister, left without parents, to be safe and taken care of by 
his subordinates. According to these claims, she did wear a uniform, 
but was not a camp guard and did not participate in any of the developments 
there. Seric indicated that will be her defense, saying ``That is 
exactly what happened.'' ``She was in the camp by a combination of 
circumstances, not as an official in charge of doing things that she 
is now accused of,'' he said. The two, 13th graf pvs
