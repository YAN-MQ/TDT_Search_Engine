The hour's top stories are two minutes away, followed by a check of 
Wall Street in "Dollars & Sense." And still ahead -- professional 
sports games, once a television network's dream has suddenly turned 
into a ratings nightmare. We'll take a look at why sports fans are 
tuning out. MCI five cent sundays. Five... Daffy: cut! I need passion. 
Depth. I need intensity. MCI five cent sundays. Five cents a minute. 
Every... cut! Sunday. Think big. Think Shakespeare! "Five cents a 
minute! every Sunday!" Five thenth a minute. Every thunday. I ask 
for an actor. They send a comedian. Call 1-800-sundays to become an 
MCI customer. Again. Call 1-800... the day we started business, we 
had over 30 years experience as the world leader in satellite services 
and systems. We are the world leader in digital satellite television. 
And, the world's leading provider of private business networks. Introducing 
Hughes, a familiar name with a brand new focus. When you need the 
best in satellite and wireless communications. We make it happen.
