Suitcases pour forth steam to suggest a train station, even as later 
in the evening actors attired as peasants become the train that bears 
down upon _ and kills _ the title character, Anna Karenina. Two high-stepping 
women form a carriage, while rows of bentwood chairs function as seats 
as well as weapons of sorts, debris and, at one point, items of clothing. 
If this sounds like the emphatic physical style of the Britain-based 
company Theatre de Complicite that has visited New York of late, think 
again. The stripped-down version of Leo Tolstoy's ``Anna Karenina,'' 
arriving on Wednesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic 
Theater, is a production by Shared Experience _ another London theater 
company that makes imaginative use of relatively few props. But this 
is no simple exercise in minimalist theater. For more than two decades, 
the touring troupe has put the actor at the center of the event, enhanced 
by only as much set design as is needed to release the affective heart 
of the story. Though the company has worked off and on within the 
classical repertory since it began in 1975, Shared Experience has 
made a name for itself by adapting novels, more often than not 19th-century 
epics like ``The Mill on the Floss'' by George Eliot, ``War and Peace'' 
by Tolstoy and ``Jane Eyre'' by Charlotte Bronte. Not surprisingly, 
it has been compared to two other London-based touring troupes _ Complicite 
and Cheek by Jowl _ because all three companies make a point of preferring 
nonnaturalistic theater and releasing the physicality of the actor. 
Shared Experience is the last of the three to make its debut in the 
United States. The Complicite production of ``The Street of Crocodiles,'' 
presented last summer at the Lincoln Center Festival, was greeted 
with acclaim, as was the company's earlier ``Three Lives of Lucie 
Cabrol.'' For its part, Cheek by Jowl has made three well-received 
visits to BAM with highly stylized, virtually choreographed stagings 
of Shakespeare and John Webster. ``We get lumped together because 
we work outside the established venues,'' said Nancy Meckler, an American 
expatriate who has run Shared Experience since 1987 and who is directing 
six performances of the three-hour ``Anna Karenina'' in Brooklyn. 
``I think we're all interested in asking questions about what theater 
is and how to make it; we're all very interested in process.'' But 
Shared Experience predates the other two companies and, given that 
Cheek by Jowl is on indefinite hiatus, may outlast at least one of 
them. Besides, no other troupe in the English-speaking theater has 
_ for so long a time _ looked to the novel as a source for inspiration, 
notwithstanding the success at various times of the Royal Shakespeare 
Company's Tony Award-winning ``Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby,'' 
based on the Dickens tale; the musical ``Les Miserables,'' from the 
Victor Hugo story; and the all-male version of Graham Greene's ``Travels 
With My Aunt'' that began at the Citizens Theater in Glasgow. (The 
Citizens, interestingly, staged its own ``Anna Karenina'' in 1987 
with five actresses playing the heroine.) In fact, long before Ms. 
Meckler was making her name as a freelance director in England of 
classics like ``Macbeth'' and ``The Cherry Orchard,'' an English director, 
Mike Alfreds, was creating Shared Experience. He presented three evenings 
of different collections of the ``Arabian Nights'' stories and a version 
of Dickens's ``Bleak House'' that ran for 10 hours over 4 nights, 
with 7 actors played 120 characters; in ``Anna Karenina,'' 8 performers 
assume 54 parts. In 1987 Alfreds spent a year away from his company, 
directing at the National Theater, and by the time he returned had 
decided to move on in his career. Now, he heads another touring company, 
Method and Madness, which just opened a stage version of the American 
crime novelist James Ellroy's ``Black Dahlia'' at a theater in Exeter, 
in southwest England. But back in the 1970s, Alfreds recalled, ``I 
thought, I'm a great believer in narrative. If you give an audience 
a story, they've got a narrative to hang on to _ then, you can take 
them anywhere.'' His aim, he said, was to restore an unfettered, even 
liberating rapport between audience and actor: ``It wasn't just about 
doing literary novels, it was actually very much about the relationship 
with the audience that an actor could suggest through words and movements, 
things that weren't there, that you evoked for the audience whatever 
they wanted to see.'' That concept gave rise to the name Shared Experience, 
the idea being that the audience, Alfreds said, ``shared in the creative 
event.'' Today, Ms. Meckler speaks of keeping that respect for the 
actor while wedding it to the Expressionistic style of theater that 
she prizes. Ms. Meckler, who grew up in Great Neck on Long Island 
and graduated from Antioch College in 1963, has lived in Britain since 
1968. Speaking on a recent afternoon in the converted Soho laundry 
that is Shared Experience's office, she said: ``I know Expressionism 
is a dirty word because we always just think of a Munch painting. 
To me, Expressionism is when you have theater that expresses things 
that are usually hidden, things going on in the mind and the imagination.'' 
Hence the troupe's fiercely moving 1994 version of ``The Mill on the 
Floss,'' which refracted the heroine, Maggie Tulliver, into three 
distinct Freudian selves, or appetites. Or ``Anna Karenina,'' which 
first opened in London in 1992 in an adaptation by Helen Edmundson, 
a former actress. The production, Ms. Meckler said, aims not for a 
documentary-like recreation of Tolstoy's Russia but to pierce to the 
passionate heart of two distinct yet intersecting souls, the doomed 
Anna (played by Teresa Banham) and her lover, the robust, idealistic, 
possibly even triumphant Levin (Richard Hope). ``It's Peter Brook's 
`empty space,' basically,'' said Hope, referring to the prevailing 
pared-down esthetic not just of the Paris-based English theater legend 
but of that of Shared Experience, the company that has employed him 
for much of the 1990s. (Hope played Pierre in the troupe's 1996 staging 
of ``War and Peace,'' a co-production with the Royal National Theater.) 
Was Hope concerned about an enterprise that required distilling nearly 
1,000 pages of prose, especially since the first five weeks of rehearsal 
were spent entirely on Act I? ``I did think it was madness to attempt,'' 
he said. ``What you hope is that you can stand by the novel; though 
you're not doing the novel exactly.'' Indeed, Shared Experience wants 
less to create a stage equivalent of the book than to capture something 
of its energy and passion in a theatrical form. ``It's using the medium 
of theater to maximum poetic potential,'' said Richard Eyre, the former 
artistic director of the National who had invited the company to work 
on ``War and Peace'' there two years ago. ``Two to three chairs become 
a palace,'' Eyre continued. ``Eight people become a train. That to 
me is the poetry of theater, the theaterness of theater.'' Britain 
isn't alone in such endeavors. In the United States, the Book-It Repertory 
Theater in Seattle is in its 10th year of similar projects, though 
on a less ambitious scale. Book-It's artistic director, Jane Jones, 
will be represented in New York in February as co-creator and co-director 
(with Tom Hulce) of the stage version of John Irving's novel ``The 
Cider House Rules'' at the Atlantic Theater Company Off Broadway. 
The two-part play, which has been done at the Seattle Rep and the 
Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, runs for a total of about six hours, 
though Ms. Jones said only the first half would be presented in New 
York. ``I just want to see the return of good stories on stage,'' 
Ms. Jones said. While some London critics _ Michael Billington in 
The Guardian, for one _ decry the trend of novels on stage as a loss 
for the literature involved, Ms. Jones argues that critics ``should 
consider themselves lucky that they are getting good stories and some 
of the most fantastic characters ever written.''
