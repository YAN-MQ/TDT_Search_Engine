A U.S. bank proposal for the developing world to take a bigger role 
in combating global warming has received a cool reception at a U.N. 
climate summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. China and other developing 
nations have blocked formal talks over voluntary commitments from 
poor countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The summit of 160 
countries opened Monday as a follow-up to the 1997 global warming 
treaty.
