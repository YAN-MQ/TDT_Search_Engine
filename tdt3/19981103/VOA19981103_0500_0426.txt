The trial of Mr. Anwar seems to be having a chilling effect on U.S. 
relations with Malaysia. President Clinton will visit there next week 
to attend a regional summit but administration officials say President 
Clinton will not be holding any bilateral talks with the prime minister 
during his stay. A report from VOA's Kyle King at the State Department. 
White House officials say Mr. Clinton's trip to Malaysia will go ahead, 
but they say they are concerned about the trial of former Malaysian 
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Mr. Anwar was fired from his 
job in September after disagreeing with Prime Minister Mahatir over 
economic policy. He is now on trial charged with corruption and misconduct. 
State Department spokesman James Rubin says U.S. participation in 
the APEC summit does not reflect a lack of concern about the issues. 
We've made clear that we are not going to be having bilateral discussions 
with the Malaysians while we're there. We're there for the meeting 
of APEC and not as part of any bilateral support for what's going 
on there. We have serious concerns about what's going on there. U.S. 
officials have also protested the barring of U.S. and western diplomats 
from the trial of Mr. Anwar who could face up to 20 years in prison 
if convicted. State Department spokesman James Rubin says on U.S. 
diplomat and several other envoys and journalists were turned away 
from the trial, although the chief justice had announced the court 
would be opened to all spectators. Given the enormous interest in 
this trial, it is in Malaysia's interest to follow the policy announced 
by the high court and allow spectators to observe the trial on a first-come, 
first-served basis including representatives of international and 
local organizations, as well as diplomats. U.S. officials say some 
journalists were allowed in during the first day of the trial, but 
at least six western diplomats were refused entry, including the U.S. 
embassy representative who was second in the waiting line. Kyle King,
