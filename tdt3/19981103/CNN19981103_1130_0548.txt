Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was supposed to meet with 
his cabinet today. To discuss the latest Middle East peace agreement. 
But Netanyahu delayed the meeting, saying debate would not take place 
until the Palestinians submit a complete security plan for fighting 
terrorism. Jerrold Kessel has more. The Israeli prime minister was 
supposed to be convening his cabinet to begin a debate. But hours 
before the scheduled meeting, Mr. Netanyahu indicated further delay 
was necessary. I spoke yesterday to secretary Albright about receiving 
this important guarantee. And if we receive it, I'll convene the government. 
If not, I'll wait until I receive it. I won't show the ministers an 
incomplete report. The reason was that Palestinians hadn't committed 
themselves in writing as they had promised at the wye summit to one 
specific security guarantee which Mr. Netanyahu had won from them. 
Then, yachts sack mordechai, who was holding a meeting with top Palestinian 
officials, including Yasser Arafat's security chief, explained what 
precisely was holding up ratification. Release of 30 that killed Israeli 
people and it had been agreed tho those 30 people have to be in the 
prison. We would like at least of those people with the time line, 
when we find that, we can be much more comfortable about what we agreed. 
Mordechai said he expected Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat to talk later 
in the day, in a bid to overcome the snag. Some top Palestinian officials, 
however, showed their impatience at what they see as more Israeli 
shilly shallying. It's political by this government. I have no confidence 
at all that they will respect their signature and that mr. Netanyahu 
is a man of peace. The bumpy road that many had expected between commitment 
and implementation seems now even more bumpy than anticipated. Jerrold 
Kessel, CNN, Jerusalem.
