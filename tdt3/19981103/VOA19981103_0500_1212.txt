There were a couple of clouds hanging over the markets yesterday. 
The government reports the savings rate of the average American has 
dropped to its lowest level since 1933. In fact the latest figures 
show many Americans are now spending more than they earned, indicating 
increased borrowing. Kevin Flanagan of the American Stanley Dean Witter 
Investment Company says that cannot be sustained. Consumers will not 
be able to tap in anymore to spend down the road. And what we're seeing 
is an unwillingness to extend more credit. So I would expect to see 
spending patterns move to a weaker pattern as 1998 comes to a close.
