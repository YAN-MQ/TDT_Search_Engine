Ethiopia has ordered the Sudanese People's Liberation Army to close 
its office in western Ethiopia on the border with Sudan, a source 
said Tuesday. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told 
The Associated Press the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi 
had ordered rebel leader John Garang to close the SPLA office in the 
Gambella region that borders Sudan. The Sudanese government had also 
agreed to curb the activities of Ethiopian opposition groups in its 
territory, the source added. The move was seen as a sign of further 
improvement of ties between Addis Ababa and Khartoum, strained since 
suspected Sudan-based assailants tried to assassinate Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak at an Organization of African Unity summit in Addis 
Ababa in 1995. Quoting the Sudanese Al Alwan newspaper, three private 
Ethiopian newspapers reported at the weekend that Garang had been 
had been ordered to pull out his forces away from the border area 
in addition to closing the SPLA office in Gambella. But when questioned 
about the newspaper reports Tuesday, government spokeswoman Selome 
Tadesse replied: ``Was there an SPLA office in western Ethiopia in 
the first place?'' She said she would not at any rate comment on reports 
from independent newspapers whose sources, she said, were unreliable. 
The relationship between Ethiopia and Sudan began to improve dramatically 
after the outbreak five months ago of a simmering border conflict 
between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Eritrea has been at loggerheads with 
Sudan, which it accuses of interference in its internal affairs. Eritrea 
is host to the National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella group of 
Sudanese opposed to the Islamic Front government of President Omar 
el-Bashir. Ten days ago, Ethiopian Airlines resumed flights to the 
Khartou, 2 1/2 years after suspending them in the aftermath of the 
Mubarak assassination attempt. Ethiopia accused Sudan of complicity, 
and relations fell to an all-time low.
