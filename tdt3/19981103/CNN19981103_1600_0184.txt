The race for one of California's Senate seats is also expected to 
come down to the wire. Republican Matt fong is pitted against incumbent 
Barbara boxer. The voter turnout issue is really important. It's not 
just about me. I do better with a larger turnout. But it's a lot more. 
It's about people understanding that their daily lives are impacted 
by who sits in the United States Senate seat. I hope it's going to 
be enough for us to get out our base vote, I don't know, 57%, 58%. 
But now my message to everybody is exercise your civic responsibility 
and vote. We just hope that you'll make the time some time between 
now and 8:00.
