An outbreak of malaria has left more than 270 people dead, mostly 
children, in several parts of southern Yemen, health officials said 
Tuesday. The hardest hit is the province of al-Dali, 200 kilometers 
(130 miles) southeast of San'a, where 156 people have died since early 
last month, said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
In the area of Mawiya, 200 kilometers (130 miles) south of San'a, 
73 people died and 44 others died in the province of Lahij, 280 kilometers 
(180 miles) south of San'a, they said. The officials said hospitals 
in the infected areas are unable to cope with the high number of patients. 
The health ministry has dispatched several medical teams and medicine 
to the affected areas. No other details were available. Heavy rains 
more than two months ago left pools of stagnant water, allowing malarial 
mosquitoes to breed, said the officials. Yemen, an impoverished country 
of 17 million in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, spends 
only 400 riyals (dlrs 3) annually per person for health care.
