Five Chilean exiles have filed complaints against former Chilean dictator 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, accusing him of responsibility for their arrest, 
kidnap and torture in Chile in 1973, prosecutors said Tuesday. A Chilean 
man who has since gained German citizenship has accused Pinochet of 
responsibility in his kidnap and torture, and of the disappearance 
and probable murder of his brother in 1976 in papers filed in a Hanover 
court. A Chilean woman, who also since became a German citizen, accused 
Pinochet of depriving her of personal liberty and causing bodily harm 
during her arrest and torture, according to a complaint filed in Cologne. 
A third complaint, filed in Hamburg on behalf of two Chilean exiles 
who have German citizenship and a Chilean expatriate, accuse Pinochet 
of genocide, murder, crimes against humanity, deprivation of personal 
liberty and causing serious bodily harm. Prosecutors were determining 
whether Germany has jurisdiction in the cases, since neither Chilean 
was a German citizen when the events happened, and whether the charges 
were still valid 25 years after the fact. The legal actions were the 
latest by Chilean exiles who claim to have suffered under Pinochet's 
17-year rule since Britain's High Court ruled illegal the dictator's 
arrest in London on a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition on charges 
of murder, kidnapping and torture. Britain's highest court, the House 
of Lords, is expected to rule this week on an appeal to the High Court 
ruling that Pinochet is immune from prosecution as a former head of 
state. The judges were expected to uphold the ruling, meaning that 
Britain would be unlikely to honor other extradition requests, should 
the new cases advance that far. Chilean exiles in Belgium, Norway, 
Switzerland, Sweden and France have independently filed complaints 
similar to the ones in Germany seeking either Pinochet's prosecution 
or extradition: _France issued an international arrest warrant Monday. 
_Switzerland has requested Pinochet's extradition. _In Sweden, criminal 
complaints have been filed. _In Belgium, six Chilean exiles launched 
legal proceedings to have Pinochet extradited there if the Spanish 
bid fails. _In Norway, a Chilean exile has filed a complaint alleging 
Pinochet was responsible for the disappearance of two friends in 1974. 
A report by Chile's democratically elected government says more than 
3,000 people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's rule.
