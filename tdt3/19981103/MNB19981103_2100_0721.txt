When we come back, the opinion of a former G.O.P. vice president, 
Dan quayle on what is shaping up in part as a not so lucky night for 
the G.O.P. around the country. It was one of those moments in life 
you want to keep. My husband thought he was getting dinner. My daughter... 
a new friend. Time to cook the lobster! When the moment came, I didn't 
have to worry about the light being low hey! That's my lobster! Or 
them turning out blurry because they were moving. With Kodak Max, 
I knew I'd get my picture. Low light, sunlight, action or still Kodak 
Max is all you need to know about film.
