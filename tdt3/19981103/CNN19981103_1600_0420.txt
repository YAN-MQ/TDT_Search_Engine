O.J. Simpson's heisman trophy, golf clubs and other belongings could 
be on the auction block as early as February, as the result of his 
wrongful death judgment. A judge in California approved an agreement 
today between the families of murder victims Nicole Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman. Under the plan, the items will be sold and the families will 
split the proceeds. Simpson was ordered to pay $33.5 million after 
a jury judged him responsible for those deaths. His assets were seized 
last year and have been in storage ever since.
