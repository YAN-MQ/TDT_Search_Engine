Two of Singapore's big four banks announced Tuesday they were cutting 
their prime lending rate by half a percentage point, paving the way 
for other local institutions to follow suit. United Overseas Bank 
reduced the rate it charges its best customers to 6.5 percent effective 
Tuesday, its third cut in less than two months and the biggest single 
cut since local banks began lowering their lending rates recently. 
The Singapore stock market reacted jubilantly, with the benchmark 
Straits Times Industrial Index rising 4.4 percent in the first 15 
minutes of trading before giving up most of its gains on profit-taking. 
The index closed 0.33 point higher at 1,263.47. Later Tuesday, the 
Development Bank of Singapore Ltd. announced an identical cut, effective 
Wednesday. Singapore's other two major local banks _ Oversea-Chinese 
Banking Corp. and Overseas Union Bank _ are expected to follow. Singapore's 
three-month interbank rates have plunged to near three-year lows of 
2 percent, pulling down the prime lending rate in the process, market 
observers said. Local banks usually adjust their prime rate when it 
exceeds the interbank rate by 2 to 3 percentage points. In early October, 
the major local banks lowered their prime rates by a quarter percentage 
point to 7 percent, following an identical cut in early September. 
The gradual lowering of lending rates is expected to aid businesses 
in need of capital and ease homeowners' mortgage payments, which had 
risen to relatively high levels during the economic crisis. Mounting 
global pressure for lower interest rates and faltering domestic demand 
for loans will continue to put pressure on Singapore's prime lending 
rate, said analysts.
