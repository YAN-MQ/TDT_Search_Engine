On another subject, Ms. Albright has intervened in a dispute holding 
up Israeli action to ratify the new interim of peace agreement with 
the Palestinians. She phoned Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu after 
he postponed a Cabinet meeting that was supposed to debate the agreement. 
Mr. Netanyahu said the Palestinian security plan was not complete. 
However, State Department spokesman James Rubin says the Palestinians 
have met their responsibilities by submitting a plan to combat terrorism.
