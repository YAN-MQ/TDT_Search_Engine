As government troops battled Tuesday to retake a remote state capital 
from leftist rebels, the government declared that it had no choice 
but to press on with efforts to seek peace. A presidential envoy said 
President Andres Pastrana would inaugurate planned peace talks in 
the coming weeks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, 
of FARC, the country's oldest and most powerful insurgency. The rebel 
group flattened a frontier police post Sunday with homemade missiles 
in Mitu, a town of 15,000 inhabitants in southeastern Vaupes state, 
near the border with Brazil. The Colombian Red Cross, the only observers 
allowed access by the rebels, said an estimated 60 officers and 10 
civilians were killed and as many as 45 police taken prisoner. ``We 
are moved, we are hurt and we are saddened,'' government peace commissioner 
Victor G. Ricardo told a news conference. ``But the objective of the 
peace process is precisely to stop this river of blood.'' The massive 
rebel attack on the eve of planned peace talks has increased distrust 
of the guerrillas and forced the government to justify concessions 
made to bring them to the table. Pastrana, who took office in August 
vowing to end a 34-year civil war, has agreed to begin peace talks 
without a cease-fire and to withdraw the army from a Switzerland-size 
region. Critics say the rebels will take advantage of the gesture 
_ set to be completed by Saturday _ to tighten their grip on southern 
Colombia. As a prelude to the talks, the rebels also want to exchange 
captured soldiers and police _ up to about 290 after Sunday's siege 
_ for 452 jailed guerrillas. Pastrana has so far not agreed to the 
demand. The armed forces commander, Gen. Fernando Tapias, said he 
could not confirm the weekend death toll provided by the Red Cross, 
but said eight security force members were killed and 20 wounded when 
reinforcements airlifted into Brazilian jungles near Mitu were repelled 
by waiting rebel fighters. Tapias said army efforts to regain control 
of Mitu were proceeding slowly to avoid killing civilians, which he 
said the guerrillas were using as ``shields.'' The bloodshed has underscored 
the power of the rebels, who have racked up victory after victory 
against poorly trained, dispirited security forces _ and haven't lost 
a battle in nearly a decade. A soldier who suffered bullet and shrapnel 
wounds in the fighting outside Mitu said in an interview that his 
column was ambushed by rebels with machine guns, grenades and mortars, 
and at least five of his comrades were killed. ``They are better armed 
than we are,'' Pvt. Cesar Tulio Espitia told Radionet network from 
a hospital in San Jose del Guaviare, the army's staging area 300 kilometers 
(190 miles) from the fighting.
