That's a look at sports. I'm Jim Stevenson. Thank you very much, Jim. 
We'll have a sports update again one hour from now and business news 
is not far away, just about 25 minutes from now. Still to come in 
this hour, dramatizing the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution 
in a new musical. And on Dateline, justice and national reconciliation 
in the wake of the arrest of former Chilean dictator Pinochet, and 
South Africa's Truth Commission report. I'm Tony Riggs with Victor 
Morales. Stay with us as VOA News Now continues.
