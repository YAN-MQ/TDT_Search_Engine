Good evening. In this congressional election, the republicans made 
a big bet late in the campaign that the White House scandal would 
help their party and hurt democrats. Tonight, based on interviews 
with voters and political insiders from both parties, it appears that 
bet failed. We can project a winner in one race in Indiana. Democrat 
Evan bayh picks up the Senate seat of retiring republican Dan coats 
-- a gain for the democrats. And that's a seat once told by Mr. bayh's 
father. Joining me throughout the night, Tim russert, NBC Washington 
bureau chief and moderator of "meet the press." Tim, we'll be talking 
about all of this during the course of the evening. There appears 
to be more good news than bad news for the president. The republican 
party remains a formidable force, but it could lose some key races 
and its overall gains in Congress are likely to be minimal. It appears 
tonight this election will be good news for President Clinton when 
he faces impeachment proceedings when the Congress returns to washington. 
According to the exit polls, Americans did not feel that today's vote 
was a Referendum on the president. When asked what issue mattered 
most in their votes, just 6% said the lewinsky scandal. 23% sited 
morals and ethics. And 71% said other issues like health care, social 
security, education and taxes. That does not mean the voters are letting 
the president off the hook. When asked about punishments for the Lewinsky 
scandal, here's what they had to say. 36% said they would support 
impeachment. When asked if the president should resign, 44% said yes. 
38% said they would support censure. When important theme that could 
carry threw tonight, whether Americans feel the country is on the 
right track. Among all voters today, 63% think things are going in 
the right direction. 37% think the country's on the wrong track. Democrats 
are feeling positive about the country's direction. 81% say it's good. 
Republicans are in a more sour mood today. Tim russert, what are we 
to make of all of this? A greater disconnection between the nation's 
capitol and the people? It's extraordinary. The people are saying 
they care about real issues. Republicans had a strategy, release the 
grand jury testimony create an outrage. It looks like that may not 
happen. The president will then have a case to make, saying, can't 
we end this? Does that mean a censure? Does that mean a deal? Republicans 
have to make a decision, carry out impeachment against the will of 
the part. We need to look at the governors out there who have chosen 
a different track all together. They are the recipients of support 
from people all across the country by margins of two to country. Republican 
governors are winning by performance not ideology. We may have a struggle 
for the soul of the republican party. No doubt about it.
