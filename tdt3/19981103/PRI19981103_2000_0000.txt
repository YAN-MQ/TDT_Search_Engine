From Public Radio International, this is THE WORLD. A co-production 
of the BBC of World Service, PRI, and WGBH Boston. It's Tuesday, November 
3rd. I'm Lisa Mullens in Boston. Today, the Pentagon says it's got 
the guns to strike Iraq, and Iraq insists it won't back down. Also, 
the ex-wife of Italian fashion heir, Gucci, gets 29 years behind bars, 
and the color lines get blurred in Jamaica. I guess the European and 
the American White is trying to get darker, and then the darker people 
are trying to get lighter, so I guess God must be there trying to 
make up his mind here. You know, who should I make white; who should 
I make black? You know, it's quite funny. First, this news. For THE 
WORLD, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom in London.
