He did cast an abtenty ballot but senator John Glenn isn't sweating 
out this election day. He retired this year. And like a lot of retirees, 
he went to Florida. But, as we all know, he didn't stop there. He 
and the rest of the crew of "discovery" were very busy today with 
satellites and other science. Here's NBC's Robert Hager. Flawlessly, 
the shuttle's crew retrieves the small satellite it pushed out into 
orbit Sunday, to study the sun's corona for two days. Congratulations! 
And great job. And these are some of the 900 pictures the satellite 
took. The corona, or outer atmosphere, can influence weather here 
on earth. As the mission passes half-way point today we're learning 
new information about the odd way weightlessness affects people in 
space. The body quickly senses that it doesn't have to work hard without 
gravity. Astronauts exercise, but still, bones lose density, muscles 
weaken, the heart shrinks 15% in the first day or two. And there's 
this, from commander Curt brown. Your stomach and your intestines 
and that kind of stuff shut down for a few hours to sort of figure 
out what's going on. Then everything cranks back up and your food 
and stomach and intestines and all start working like normal. Food 
tastes a little different. Sweets are sweeter. But salt and spices 
are harder to taste. No one knows why. And the body may not absorb 
things as well. When you do take medications, will the appropriate 
dosage get into your system or will it -- not be absorbed, and then 
do you need to take more medicine? As John Glenn points out, without 
gravity, more body fluid goes to the head. Yesterday, everyone was 
puffed-face around here, looked like the Poppin' fresh doughboy or 
something like that. And I think my face is still swelled up some. 
After awhile, puffiness goes away, but another change comes on. It 
will be interesting when we find out if our bodies stretch out some 
up here. They say some people have a little back uneasiness when that 
happens. Astronauts typically gain about an inch or two of height. 
But previous flights have shown, on returning to earth, all these 
changes go away. A remarkable tribute to the human body's ability 
to adapt -- whether on earth or 350 miles up, in the wonders of an 
alien environment. Robert Hager, NBC news, Washington.
