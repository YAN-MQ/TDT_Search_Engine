The voice of the people had a decided edge of exasperation to it on 
Election Day when voters were asked whether the threatened impeachment 
of President Clinton was a factor in their ballot decisions. ``I just 
voted and I didn't even think about it,'' said George Gordon, a 96-year-old 
retired food broker, emerging from a public school polling station 
on West 77th Street in New York City. ``It's a lot of baloney. Who 
gives a damn about the man's sex life?'' he added, frowning at the 
question in the sunshine. ``I've been voting since the Depression 
and the only president I'd trust not to fool around with women would 
be good old Harry Truman.'' Outside a Chicago voting place, Scott 
Vanderweele made a similar quick survey of rectitude in the Oval Office. 
``I don't know any president _ maybe Jimmy Carter _ who hasn't done 
a little sleeping around, and I don't know any 50-year-old man who 
hasn't lied about it,'' said Vanderweele, a 49-year-old systems analyst, 
describing the Republican Congress' impeachment inquiry as ``insane.'' 
Americans professing to be tired of the whole sex-and-mendacity scandal 
in Washington still betrayed that they were up to the minute on its 
historicity. ``You know, Jefferson fooled around with his slaves,'' 
said Joyce Schlichting, an 85-year-old New Yorker who was sparkled-eyed 
as she emerged fresh from voting. ``Kennedy was worse than Clinton, 
but Clinton got caught. Let him serve out his term.'' With Election 
Day results being awaited by politicians as a referendum of sorts 
on the president's predicament in Washington, voters randomly interviewed 
across the country tended toward tolerance of the president and impatience 
with his Republican inquisitors. ``It just made me vote Democratic 
because Republicans keep harping on it,'' said Anthony Duran, a 32-year-old 
television cameraman, sipping coffee as an early voter in the Fairfax 
district of Los Angeles. ``It actually made me come out and vote.'' 
In some cases, the raw numbers of surveys of voters leaving the polls 
_ where Clinton's popularity amid the scandal was confirmed once more 
_ were hardly a match for the angry edge to the views of voters. ``I 
voted against the Republicans for being such pinheads, for not getting 
down to issues,'' said Judy Malone-Stein, an artist and teacher, after 
voting at the Lanier Middle School in Houston. ``It's a dangerous 
time in this country when people start prying into peoples' private 
lives and not taking care of business.'' The president's critics were 
no less fervid. ``Clinton should be booted out,'' said Joe Strack, 
a municipal employee in Oceanside, New York. ``Whether by impeachment, 
resignation _ just leave. A president has to have family values,'' 
he said. ``How can he speak for this country now?'' To the contrary, 
surveys of voters leaving the polls found the president's political 
capital holding strong, with 6 in 10 wanting the impeachment inquiry 
to be quickly ended, without the House even holding hearings. ``They 
pushed too far,'' Andrew Paton said of the Republicans, after voting 
in Houston, echoing the view of Christopher Larkosh in Chicago that 
the impeachment issue ``really backfired'' on the party. ``People 
are sick of hearing about it and mixing President Clinton's personal 
life with the goings-on of government,'' Larkosh said. In Brooklyn, 
N.Y., Carlos Gorbea, a playwright, voted and then prodded neighbors 
on Montague Street: ``Did you vote yet?'' ``The president violated 
his obligations by lying to everybody,'' Gorbea said. ``But I wouldn't 
waste the time, energy and money to impeach him,'' he added, denouncing 
the Republicans even more strongly for driving the scandal forward 
at the expense of what he said were far more vital issues and needs. 
Across the street, Jay Brady, an artist, said the impeachment drive 
gave her a special impulse to vote. ``I would like to see the hypocrites 
and the scolds have the rug of opportunity pulled out from under them,'' 
she said, referring to Ken Starr, the independent counsel, and Speaker 
Newt Gingrich. The surveys at the polls showed the voters making a 
distinction between approving of Clinton as a president (about 60 
percent) but disapproving of him as a person (60 percent). One voter, 
Harvel Lewis, an engineer from Mount Vernon, N.Y., speculated that 
the president's resilience with the public may have more to do with 
compassion amid their own private failings than with his political 
popularity. ``I've been through that road before myself,'' he said 
gently, without elaborating. Some voters found the scandal issue rooted 
in differences of generation more than party. ``The majority of my 
peers can get over it: the bar has been lowered since we were born,'' 
said Jennifer Logothetis, a 28-year-old government worker in New York. 
``We can forgive infidelity. I have a problem with the lies. But impeachment? 
I don't think so.'' If nothing else, the president's scandal showed 
ordinary voters inured to the luridness of it after 10 months of revelations 
as candid as Chaucer. ``Yes, he lied, yes, he can't keep his zipper 
zipped,'' said Shannon Havard, a restaurant manager and registered 
Republican in Houston. ``But I don't think it affected how he ran 
the country. Republicans are acting like it was the crime of the century.''
