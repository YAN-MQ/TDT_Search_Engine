More than $3 million in U.S. relief supplies are on the way to help 
central america in the aftermath of hurricane Mitch. Other organizations, 
including the church of latter day saints, also are sending emergency 
supplies. An estimated 7,000 people across central America are feared 
dead. Hundreds, if not thousands more, are unaccounted for. Mitch's 
strong winds and pounding rains triggered mudslides and flooding across 
Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Rescue workers say 
massive mudslides literally wiped entire towns off the map. They say 
the devastation is so widespread, the exact death toll may never be 
known. Honduras has suspended constitutional liberties to try to combat 
looting. This will allow authorities to detain suspects and conduct 
unlimited searches. Honduran President Carlos flores says his country's 
infrastructure is in ruins. We don't have water maybe in 60% of the 
cities. We're unable to transport fuel. From our atlantic and from 
our southern ports. Most of the infrastructure is destroyed. Agriculture, 
we have lost between 70%. And the total dead, we won't count them 
in the hundreds. It's in the thousands that we have. If you would 
like to give money to help relief efforts in central America, the 
red cross is accepting donations at 1-800-help-now.
