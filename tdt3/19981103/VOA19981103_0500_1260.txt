Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is again denying charges by the U.S. 
government that his gigantic computer company used its considerable 
influence to eliminate competitors. During testimony Monday, the vice 
president for Software Engineering at Apple Computer testified that 
Microsoft was threatening to withdraw its technical support for the 
popular business software known as Office Suite if Apple would incorporate 
Microsoft's Internet browser into its computer operating system. Prosecutors 
asked Mr. Gates about a memo allegedly sent to him by colleague Don 
Bradford. The Justice Department says the note discussed how Microsoft 
could work through Apple to frustrate Netscape's success. Questioned 
by prosecutors about the memo, Mr. Gates gave a curt denial. Was it 
your understanding in February of 1998 that Microsoft was trying to 
get Apple to do something to disadvantage Netscape? no. Do you know 
why Mr. Bradford would have written it in February of 1998 and sent 
a copy to you? I'm not sure. The Microsoft anti-trust trial is in 
its third week. The proceedings are expected to continue here in Washington 
for at least three more weeks.
