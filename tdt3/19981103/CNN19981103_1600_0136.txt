One of the hotly-contested Senate races is in New York. Republican 
incumbent Alfonse D'Amato and challenger Charles Schumer are neck-and-neck 
in a nasty contest filled with name-calling and Negative ads. If there's 
one thing the candidates have in common, it's their level of confidence. 
I feel very good about it. I think in the final analysis, people are 
going to say, Al D'Amato does make a difference, he does care about 
our concerns," and, "what would we do without him?" So I feel good 
about it. My gut feeling says it's a close, close race. But the momentum 
is on our side. The more people learn of my record, my desire to make 
our school better -- my kids go to the public schools -- on making 
our streets safer, protecting social security, the more they come 
over to our side.
