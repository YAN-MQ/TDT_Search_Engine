Janet Benshoof, the lawyer who heads the Center for Reproductive Law 
and Policy, did not know Dr. Barnett Slepian, the Buffalo doctor who 
was murdered because he performed abortions. But years ago, she represented 
his clinic. ``We've represented most of the abortion providers,'' 
Ms. Benshoof says, in her organization's Wall Street offices. ``At 
one time or another nearly all our clients have been under death threats.'' 
A joke of the sort Ms. Benshoof's staff edits out when they can: ``I 
feel like I'm married to the mob,'' Ms. Benshoof says, dryly. ``Saturday 
night, after the doctor was shot, another client called and talked 
for an hour. He was also in upstate New York. He said, `Do you think 
I could just get police protection until the leaves fall off?' He 
thought once the trees were bare and there was snow on the ground, 
he'd be OK. It would be harder to find cover and not to leave tracks.'' 
Ms. Benshoof has been fighting for abortion rights a long time. For 
15 years she was director of the American Civil Liberties Union's 
Reproductive Freedom Project. Six years ago, she founded the Center 
for Reproductive Rights, a nonprofit organization that today has a 
staff of 50 and a $5 million budget. The victories have been significant. 
Ms. Benshoof filed a citizen's petition with the Food and Drug Administration 
in 1994 that resulted in the FDA's approval of the ``morning-after 
pill,'' and she has battled anti-abortion rulings in 40 states. But 
in the wake of the Buffalo murder, Ms. Benshoof, who is 51, seems 
not so much tired as weary. She says she is sickened by Slepian's 
murder, but not surprised. ``There have been 1,700 acts of violence 
against health-care providers since 1977, whether arson or battery 
or invasion,'' Ms. Benshoof says. ``These are not empty threats.'' 
Delineating the work of what she calls ``the theocratic right'' to 
``recreate our political and legal structure,'' she seems discouraged. 
Yet despite the gravity of the subject, Ms. Benshoof, in a three-hour 
conversation, is not without humor. Ask how she'd like people to think 
of her, and her first response is ``as funny _ really funny.'' Discussing 
a case involving frozen embryos, there's a fact Ms. Benshoof must 
include: ``The father was a refrigerator repairman.'' Ms. Benshoof 
is also known for nerve. When the governor of Guam, years ago, signed 
a law that made even the discussion of abortion illegal, Ms. Benshoof 
flew there, stood up at a news conference and recited the address 
of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Hawaii. She was arrested on the 
spot. Released, she took the government to court and won. Nor does 
she fear for her life. Ms. Benshoof's phone number has always been 
listed, and she does not own a bulletproof vest. ``I'm very Buddhist 
on that,'' Ms. Benshoof says. ``If I'm supposed to die, I'll die. 
I also sky-dive. And I scuba-dive. I don't think I've ever been scared 
in my life.'' Ask Janet Benshoof what she wanted to do while growing 
up in the small town of Detroit Lakes, Mich., the second child of 
a county prosecutor and a teacher, and she'll answer with one deeply 
felt word: ``Leave!'' ``I was in the world of books,'' Ms. Benshoof 
says. ``What I did all the time _ what I still do all the time _ is 
read. If you give me a choice between going to a party and reading, 
I'd rather read.'' A self-characterization that turns out to be frequent, 
in both past and present: ``I guess I was weird.'' Feminist role models 
were not plentiful. Ms. Benshoof's mother (the teacher) gave up her 
career when her children were born. Ms. Benshoof encountered a female 
lawyer only when she attended Harvard Law School. It was also at Harvard 
that Ms. Benshoof met her husband, Richard Klein, who is a professor 
at Touro College in Huntington. They have twin sons, who are 20. Ms. 
Benshoof cannot explain why she wanted to be an advocate for women, 
only that from the time she was in law school it was what she wanted 
to do. She prefers not to say whether she has ever had an abortion. 
Asked when she believes the life of an unborn child begins, she gives 
a legal answer. ``I think a fetus is not a person under the Constitution 
until they're born,'' Ms. Benshoof says. ``I'm not trying to be evasive. 
I do think it's a legal issue.'' The reporter shares a confidence 
about occasionally questioning her own work, wondering whether a subject's 
history, failings, secrets, should remain secret. ``How I feel when 
I'm scuba-diving, like I'm not sure I'm supposed to be down there,'' 
Ms. Benshoof says, understanding the intrusiveness of journalists 
quickly _ maybe too quickly. ``Like maybe I'm disturbing their world.'' 
Does Ms. Benshoof ever have doubts about her work? ``I never have 
any doubts about that,'' she says. ``Ever.'' In her work, how would 
she most like to be remembered? Ms. Benshoof thinks about it. ``I 
don't think I'd want it to focus on one case,'' she says. ``I don't 
know how to say this, it sounds so hokey. I'd like people to say, 
`She wanted to make the world a better place.''' Ms. Benshoof gestures 
outside, to the canyons of Wall Street. ``There are towers all around 
us, filled with lawyers, brokers. I don't think most of them have 
a vision of changing the world. I'd like people to think just `She 
had a bigger view.'''
