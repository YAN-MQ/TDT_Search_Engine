I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." Forecast 
continues to call for more snow back through portions of the midwest 
today. Especially over the northern plains. We do have some cold air 
funneling down. Funnel system in the pacific northwest will spread 
some showers. And looking for the remnants of Mitch to bring some 
tropical moisture northward into Florida and parts of Cuba. Take a 
look at temperatures today. They're still quite cold over the northern 
midwest, back through the northern Great Lakes. The forecast high 
temperatures are only in the 30s today. Warmest weather along the 
gulf coast into Florida where highs remain back into the 80s. Look 
now at the extended forecast. On Thursday, cold air continues over 
the northern midwest. We'll find rain in the pacific northwest. And 
thunderstorms back in through Florida. On Friday, again, it is still 
cold over a good part of the north. We'll find some mixed precipitation 
back through the Great Lakes. And as we head into Saturday, again 
scattered showers over much of the north. Some of those in the form 
of some snow showers with temperatures still into the 30s. For more 
weather information, including four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 
cities, log into CNN.com.
