The U.S. Supreme Court is debating how much authority police should 
have during traffic stops. At issue is whether police have the right 
to search people or the car of a Person ticketed for a routine traffic 
violation. During today's arguments, several justices expressed doubts 
about giving law enforcement such broad power. The court is expected 
to rule in the case by July.
