Just ahead on THE WORLD, we step into the ring with a champ on PRI, 
Public Radio International. THE WORLD is sponsored by the Capital 
Group Companies, investing throughout the world for individuals and 
institutions, and THE WORLD is sponsored by Merck, dedicated to the 
needs of society through pharmaceutical research and consumer education 
to improve the quality of life. Merck, committed to bringing out the 
best in medicine. I'm Lisa Mullens. Still to come on THE WORLD, against 
the odds, a Russian entrepreneur turns his love of music into a successful 
company. I never imagined it would turn into a world music business, 
let's say. Any business in the capitalistic way was still virtually 
unknown and still kind of breaking into. First up, this news.
