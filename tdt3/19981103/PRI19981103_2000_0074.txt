the United Nations Security Council is resuming talks on how to deal 
with Iraq. Baghdad's decided to stop cooperating with U.N. weapons 
inspectors, and it's calling for the head of the inspectors, Richard 
Butler, to resign, a tactic Mr. Butler says is a diversion. It's one 
of the oldest tricks in the bag. If you don't like the message, shoot 
the messenger. Now, I won't be obliging because that would be to give 
in to what is a transparent distraction. The issue is their weapons, 
not who runs my organization. U.N. Weapons Inspector, Richard Butler. 
Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense, William Cohen is continuing a tour 
of European and Gulf States to consult allies on the Iraqi problem.
