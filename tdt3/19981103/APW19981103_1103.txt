Rescuers have found more than 1,900 bodies in the mud that runs down 
the volcano and sweeps down these broad, flat plains, the mayor of 
this municipality said Tuesday. A two-hour walk out of the town's 
center and into the sugar cane fields turned up 22 bodies still in 
plain view _ bloated, scratched and tangled in trees, cane stalks 
and mud. ``It is full, full of bodies,'' Ariel Mendoza, a 26-year-old 
construction worker said, pointing at the Casitas volcano. ``From 
where the mud starts, down to the sea.'' Mayor Felicita Zeledon of 
Posoltega, the largest city near the disaster area, said in a live 
radio interview Tuesday that 1,930 cadavers had been recovered in 
villages below Casitas volcano. Other officials gave lower, but still 
ghastly calculations of the death toll here: The Red Cross said 1,250. 
The president's office said 1,338. Bodies found Tuesday were being 
burned to prevent the spread of disease, Zeledon said. Nicaragua's 
Health Ministry said it was dispatching medical brigades to help recover 
and bury bodies and to fumigate the region. Villagers said they found 
about 200 bodies here at the San Pablo sugar cane plantation, just 
outside of town. Amid the crushed cane stalks lie muddy shoes, purses, 
tires, a colander. The stench of death crops up every few hundred 
yards where a body lies: A little girl with her hair braided into 
the cane stalks by the slide. A man still wearing boots, but nothing 
else. A boy, perhaps 8, snuggled under a tree trunk. Or just an arm 
sticking out of the mud. The government urged people living near Casitas 
and eight other nearby volcanos to evacuate their homes Tuesday for 
fear of new mudslides. More heavy rains have been falling in recent 
days. Another small mudslide on the northern slope of the Casitas 
volcano wiped out 34 houses Monday night, but there were no apparent 
casualties, Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said. Residents 
``must be mindful of the situation and look for refuge,'' President 
Arnoldo Aleman said. Central American officials say more than 7,000 
people died in floods and mudslides triggered by Mitch, one of the 
strongest hurricanes ever to hit the Caribbean. The tragedy here occurred 
Friday morning following pounding rains. Part of the crater in the 
Casitas volcano collapsed and the lake inside formed a deluge down 
the slope. Ricardo Donaires, 34, his wife, and their baby boy spent 
three days in the open on a hilltop in the village of Rolando Rodriguez 
before hiking to safety on Monday. ``We suffered without eating and 
without drinking water for three days,'' Donaires said, now at a schoolhouse 
converted into an emergency shelter in Posoltega. At first, soldiers 
struggled to bury bodies where they lay. But with the fear of epidemics 
growing, civilian volunteers set out from the nearby community of 
Chichigalpa to burn bodies. ``We need the government to send us gasoline 
if they want to avoid an epidemic,'' said Robert Lopez Marcia, a member 
of Chichigalpa's emergency commission. At an improvised shelter at 
a Chichigalpa elementary school, doctors were in desperate need of 
medicine, antibiotics and bandages, and there was little clean water 
or food. Children lay on desks with bloody bandages on their heads. 
Along the Pan American highway, thousands of people walked in the 
pouring rain, some leaving the disaster area, others going in to search 
for family members. ``The only thing the federal government does is 
ask us for a number every half hour _ how many dead, how many injured,'' 
complained Chichigalpa Mayor Elijio Palacio. ``But they don't send 
us anything.''
