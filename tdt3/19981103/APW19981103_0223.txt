Responding to public protest, Germany's most influential newsmagazine 
defended on Tuesday its use of an Adolf Hitler portrait in ads promoting 
its series about the 20th century. Newspapers that ran the full-page 
ads this week _ and Der Spiegel magazine itself _ reported complaints 
from readers that the head shot of Hitler, without any explanatory 
text, amounted to ``a glorification of a war criminal.'' The ads feature 
a photo of Hitler above the line ``Look history in the face.'' Only 
on the next page, under a photo of a crying Hitler youth member meant 
to reflect the Nazi era's dark side, is there a reference to the 50-part 
Spiegel series, which began this week. Spiegel spokesman Matthias 
Schmolz said magazine editors anticipated some controversy, but felt 
Hitler could not be ignored. ``He stands, probably like no one else, 
for German history in the 20th century, certainly very disastrous 
and unspeakable, naturally,'' he said. ``But as far as that goes I 
believe he's a good choice, because it makes clear what the series 
is about.'' He said the editors decided to limit the Hitler ads to 
newspapers, though, ``to avoid just such misunderstandings.'' Other 
figures such as Vladimir Lenin and John F. Kennedy appear on outdoor 
billboards. To complaints that neo-Nazis could use the newspaper ads 
as posters, Schmolz said only: ``Whoever does that, we feel sorry 
for them.''
