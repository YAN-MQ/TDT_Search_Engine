A new experimental drug is offering hope to AIDS patients. Preliminary 
testing of T-20 shows it decreased the AIDS virus by 99% in the blood 
levels of four patients who took the highest dose. The improvements 
took just two weeks. T-20 uses a different method than currently approved 
AIDS drugs. It attacks HIV's ability to penetrate the body's cells. 
Scientists still need to test for the drug's long-term side effects.
