Negotiations of a different sort are going on in Russia. A team of 
U.S. negotiators in Moscow is said to be close to an agreement on 
a deal to provide food assistance to Russia. The negotiations, however, 
are shrouded in secrecy as we hear from VOA's Peter Heinline in Moscow. 
A U.S. embassy spokesman says talks will continue Wednesday between 
a team from Washington and a delegation including senior officials 
from Russia's agriculture ministry. The spokesman says negotiations 
appear to be going well, but he stressed their being held in utmost 
secrecy. When the Washington delegation arrived last week, Moscow 
media reported the United States is prepared to lend Russia $1 billion 
to be used for purchases of American wheat and other commodities. 
The Interfax News Agency says the money will allow Russia to import 
up to eight million tons of U.S. wheat over the next five years. This 
year's Russian grain harvest is expected to be about 47 million tons 
or only about half last year's yield. The agriculture ministry says 
production of meat, butter, and other dairy products will also be 
sharply lower than a year ago. Agriculture minister Victor Samanov 
says 22 of the country's 89 regions face acute grain shortages during 
the coming winter. The issue of food aid is sensitive in Russia where 
it is widely believed humanitarian assistance earlier this decade 
was mostly siphoned off and sold, while the needy got almost nothing. 
Word of another round of food assistance prompted cynical reactions 
in the local media, much of it speculating that the real reason for 
offers of U.S. help is that American farmers have mountains of surplus 
grain they want to get rid of. U.S. officials say the deal being negotiated 
this week will include terms on how the aid will be transported and 
other matters to insure it reaches the right people. Peter Heinline, 
VOA News, Moscow.
