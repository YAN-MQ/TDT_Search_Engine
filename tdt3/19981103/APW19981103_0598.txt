Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein wants a timetable on when U.N. sanctions 
will be lifted before he will allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume, 
a visiting Russian legislator said Tuesday. Ultranationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky told reporters after two hours of talks with Saddam that 
the Iraqi president saw ``no problem'' with monitoring. ``But he would 
like to have information when the blockade (will be) eliminated,'' 
Zhirinovsky said. ``When? This year, next year, next century?'' said 
the legislator, a regular visitor to Iraq who has had good relations 
with Saddam. Saddam has not spoken publicly since the government announced 
Saturday that it was halting dealings with the U.N. Special Commission, 
which oversees weapons inspections. Iraq's precondition for resuming 
cooperation was U.N. pledges to begin easing or lifting the trade 
sanctions. The stance has put Iraq on a collision course with the 
U.N. Security Council, which termed the action a ``flagrant violation'' 
of U.N. resolutions. U.S. President Clinton and British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair suggested that military force was an option. Zhirinovsky 
said of Saddam that ``he would like peace.'' But he added: ``Iraq 
made everything to fulfill all resolutions of the United Nations, 
but the United Nations doesn't make anything for Iraq.'' The sanctions, 
imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, limit the 
sale of oil and ban most other financial dealings with Iraq. The Security 
Council has said they will not be lifted until the inspectors certify 
that Iraq has eliminated its non-conventional weapons. Iraq has charged 
that the Special Commission, under Australian Richard Butler, has 
been working on behalf of the United States to prolong the sanctions. 
Zhirinovsky quoted Saddam as saying the Special Commission needed 
to be restructured to make it ``more objective.'' The Iraqi leader 
suggested Butler should be replaced by someone from China, Russia 
or France, the Russian legislator said. Representatives of the three 
countries have been the most willing members of the Security Council 
to consider easing the sanctions. On Tuesday, China urged Iraq to 
end the standoff and said cooperation would be the quickest way to 
end the sanctions. At the same time, the Security Council should fairly 
evaluate the inspection work so far and ``gradually lift the sanctions,'' 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said. The United States and 
Britain, the other permanent members, insist sanctions stay in place 
until the weapons inspections are finished. Earlier Tuesday, some 
60 coffins were carried atop taxis in the latest symbolic funeral 
procession for children the government says died because of the sanctions. 
About 100 women, most dressed in black, accompanied the orange and 
white taxis, shouting ``Today we bury them, tomorrow we will avenge 
them'' and ``America is the enemy of God.'' The protesters abandoned 
their usual route to the U.N. headquarters and, instead, marched to 
the gate of the Al-Rasheed Hotel. A number of diplomats _ including 
Zhirinovsky _ are staying at the hotel, most to attend the Baghdad 
International Fair. Western reporters also stay at the Al-Rasheed. 
Also Tuesday, three monitoring teams from the Vienna-headquartered 
International Atomic Energy Agency went into the field to check three 
previously declared weapons sites, U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross 
said. She said a technical team from the U.N. Special Commission _ 
which looks into biological and chemical weapons as well as long-range 
missiles _ went out to deal with a problem involving a camera or a 
sensor. She gave no other details. While Iraq has halted the work 
of UNSCOM inspectors and monitors, it has continued to allow nuclear 
monitors to work. In a front-page editorial Tuesday the state-run 
Al-Iraq daily said the country should prepare to battle ``the U.S. 
monster'' regardless of the sacrifices.
