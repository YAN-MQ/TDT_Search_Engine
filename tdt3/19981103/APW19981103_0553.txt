A Spanish judge filed an extradition request Tuesday that seeks to 
bring former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet from London to 
face charges of genocide, terrorism and torture in Spain. Judge Baltasar 
Garzon, whose earlier detention order resulted in Pinochet's arrest 
in London on Oct. 16, sent his extradition request to the Justice 
Ministry, which in turn could present it to a Cabinet meeting Friday, 
sources close to the judge told reporters. Sources close to the Judge 
Baltasar Garzon said the petition could be made ready later in the 
day and passed onto the Justice Ministry which in turn would likely 
present it at Friday's cabinet meeting. Although eager not to upset 
political and economic ties with Chile, Spanish Prime Minister Jose 
Maria Aznar has promised his government will not block a request for 
extradition.
