A former Nigerian military leader says he will run for president in 
national elections set for February. General Alusagen Obasano announced 
his candidacy Tuesday at his farm about 40 kilometers north of Legos. 
General Obasano called for national unity, greater political autonomy 
for Nigeria states, increased spending on education, and a crackdown 
on corruption. He led Nigeria for three years before voluntarily stepping 
down following elections in 1979.
