Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova returned to Kosovo's countryside 
Tuesday with a U.S. envoy anxious to show peace is returning to the 
disputed province. The trip marked the first time in nine years that 
Rugova toured sections of a province he was elected to lead. Accompanied 
by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, Rugova visited the front line where 
Serb forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas battled last month. Rugova 
called his outing Tuesday ``the beginning of the liberation,'' noting 
it was his first time visiting Kosovo villages since he became involved 
in politics in 1989, when Serbian authorities stripped the region 
of its autonomy. The fighting ended with the Oct. 12 agreement between 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke 
that averted NATO airstrikes on Milosevic's forces in Kosovo. Under 
the agreement, the forces have withdrawn from Kosovo and some of the 
tens of thousands of refugees in the region have started returning 
home. ``I did see lots of destruction of property and houses, but 
still I did see a beginning of people returning to their homes,'' 
Rugova said. Sporadic violence by both sides continues, along with 
intimidation by Serb police intended to prevent people from going 
home in some areas. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 
2 million people, complain of routine harassment and detention by 
Serb police. The lack of free movement intensified in a Serb crackdown 
on Albanian separatists that began in February. Subsequent fighting 
left hundreds dead, sent an estimated 300,000 fleeing and caused NATO 
to threaten airstrikes that forced Milosevic into the agreement with 
Holbrooke. In the village of Banja, 20 miles southwest of Pristina, 
Rugova spoke with ethnic Albanians in the shadow of a mosque with 
a destroyed minaret. ``I'm happy that you came here and that you are 
working day and night for us,'' said Fahredin Shurdhaj, who greeted 
Rugova with a kiss on the cheek. Further down the road in Orahovac, 
a town populated by both Serbs and ethnic Albanians, a Serb teen-ager 
complained to Rugova that his father was missing because of the turmoil. 
``We are together in this,'' Rugova replied. Afterward, Rugova said 
that although some refugees were going home, others were staying away 
because of the continued Serb police presence throughout Kosovo. ``We 
have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is still fear 
for some people to get back home,'' he said. Hill, who is trying to 
set up negotiations between Albanians and Serbs on a political agreement 
to set up a three-year interim period of self-rule for Albanians in 
Kosovo, said progress had been made. ``We can see clearly that there 
are changes out there and that people have indeed begun to return 
to their homes,'' he said. ``Now we must make sure that they are able 
to stay in their homes, that they are never driven from their homes 
again. And to do that we need a lasting settlement.'' Albanians want 
the region to be a republic in Yugoslavia, like Serbia and Montenegro, 
while Serbs insist it remain a Serbian province. While Yugoslavia 
maintains it has complied with Western demands to reduce its forces 
in Kosovo to levels before the February crackdown, the guerrilla Kosovo 
Liberation Army says more special police and soldiers must go. The 
guerrillas also warned that no political settlement for the province 
is possible without their consent. ``Sidelining the KLA from political 
issues ... will provoke negative consequences in the search for a 
solution for Kosovo,'' said a statement by the rebels obtained by 
The Associated Press. The guerrillas say they won't compromise in 
their push for independence. ``My job is to help ... make my country 
and people free,'' said Ramush Haradinaj, a 30-year-old KLA commander, 
at Jablanica in central Kosovo. ``We see some good things,'' he said. 
``But it is not enough.''
