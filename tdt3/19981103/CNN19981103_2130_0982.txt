Today is an important day for sports fans in Denver and San Diego. 
Voters there are casting ballots on measures to build new stadiums, 
which team owners say they need to stay competitive. Casey wian reports. 
San Diego's padres and Denver's Broncos could not have picked a Better 
time to ask taxpayers for roughly $400 million each to build stadiums. 
The padres are coming off their first world series appearance since 
1984, while the Broncos are the defending Super Bowl champions and 
remain undefeated halfway through this season. The situation here 
in Denver is that we have a stadium that is 50 years old. It is very 
antiquated. And we think the economics of the NFL today dictates that 
a community should make sure that they have a first-rate, world-class 
facility, enabling their local teams to compete against everybody 
else. While owners say they need the added revenue a new stadium generates 
to afford top players, in the past 20 years, no football team with 
a new stadium has made the Super Bowl. The surprising world series 
appearance by San Diego's padres has boosted support for its stadium, 
despite a grand jury report released Monday that said the proposal 
is based on unrealistic economic assumptions. Typically, they're only 
a good deal for taxpayers if they are part of a Larger redevelopment 
and revitalization effort. On a stand-alone basis, it typically means 
that the money is redirected from taxpayers to the owners of the teams. 
And that is typically not a very balanced proposition. Some are already 
regretting big stadium investments. Oakland spent $225 millon to lure 
the raiders back from Los Angeles in 1995. The deal costs the city 
$20 million a year, and the raiders are again threatening to leave. 
Even the Baltimore Orioles' park at Camden yards, considered a model 
of modern stadium innovation, is now operating at an $11 million-A-year 
deficit. Stadium deals now in development are trying to address an 
anticipated taxpayer backlash. Here in Los Angeles, two groups are 
proposing new stadiums to attract an nFL franchise. Both are counting 
on money from adjacent retail and entertainment complexes to ease 
the Burden on taxpayers. Casey wian, "CNN Financial News," Los Angeles.
