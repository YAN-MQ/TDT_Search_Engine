Central American governments have stepped up their appeal for international 
aid. They can't cope on their own with the aftermath of floods that 
have already killed thousands. They say famine and disease could claim 
even more lives. Honduras has confirmed at least 5,000 people have 
been killed, and another 11,000 are still missing. Honduran Ambassador 
to London, Roberto Flores, says children have suffered badly. It's 
the children that have been mostly affected. Some people have had 
to tie their children on top of the trees waiting for the help to 
arrive, and this is still pending. We need boats; we need food; we 
need medicine. It's really a major, major disaster for Honduras. Honduran 
Ambassador, Roberto Flores.
