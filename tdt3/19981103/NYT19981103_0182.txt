Emeril Lagasse _ restaurateur, author, cult figure _ was carving turkey 
on the Thanksgiving episode of his hit cooking show ``Emeril Live.'' 
``You want to slice the breast,'' he instructed, ``so that it's, like, 
edible.'' The audience _ 150 packed into the Metropolis Studios in 
Manhattan for the taping last month _ nodded, captivated. He laid 
down a thick slice of bread, spread it with creole mustard, topped 
it with a slice of turkey, then a slice of orange cheese, another 
slice of turkey, a brush of mustard, and another piece of bread. Then 
Lagasse dipped the turkey tower into beaten egg, fried it and put 
it into the oven. When it was done _ no time or temperature was given 
_ he cut it into quarters and set it on a plate spread with cranberry 
sauce. The audience oohed, aahed and applauded, impressed by his genius. 
Samples got passed out to a lucky few. I was one of them. I took a 
bite. It was a bad turkey sandwich. A very bad turkey sandwich. The 
bread was greasy, the turkey was dry and the orange mystery cheese 
wasn't even melted. I passed it on to another audience member, who 
could hardly contain herself. Between bites, she turned to me and 
said, ``This is like my dream come true _ I got to eat Emeril's food!'' 
Emeril Lagasse, more jester than cook, is catering to legions of gleeful 
fans. Who can begrudge all the joy he seems to bring? Lagasse reaches 
more people than Julia Child _ a wondrous cook, of course, who expanded 
the culinary appreciation of her audience _ could ever imagine in 
her heyday on television. In addition to ``Emeril Live,'' the Food 
Network's highest rated show, he's on hours a day, watched by viewers. 
He makes weekly appearances on Good Morning America as the show's 
food coorespondent. He is about to open his fifth restaurant. William 
Morrow has just published his fourth cookbook, ``Emeril's TV Dinners.'' 
This month, readers of GQ magazine chose him as Chef of the Year. 
And yet with all that potential influence, Lagasse, as he barrels 
through his frantic shows and churns out his books, is the antithesis 
of the thoughtful, methodical Ms. Child. So maybe, he's not so funny 
after all _ not to everybody, at least. ``A lot of professional foodies 
are a bit dismayed at the tone of the program,'' said Michael Batterberry, 
the founder of Food Arts magazine. ``It really smacks a little bit 
of the wrestling ring or the roller derby.'' Said Dorothy Cann Hamilton, 
president of the French Culinary Institute: ``Julia was a missionary. 
And Emeril is not a missionary preaching haute cuisine to the masses.'' 
But his followers are fervent nonetheless. Recent book signings have 
been utter mob scenes. While most cookbook writers would be ecstatic 
if they sold 100 books at a signing, Lagasse sold 2,000 on a swing 
through Poughkeepsie, N.Y., last month. (A few days before, he sold 
another 9,000 in 20 minutes on QVC.) Last spring, when the Food Network 
opened its phone lines to sell tickets to ``Emeril Live,'' over 500,000 
people called. The 1,500 tickets were gone in 21 minutes, and by 2 
p.m. that day, the flood of calls had crippled the network's phone 
lines. His Website _ www.foodtv.com _ gets an estimated 1.2 million 
page views per month. Before his meteoric rise on television, Lagasse, 
39, had a fairly modest culinary career. He started at the age of 
12 working in a Portuguese bakery in Fall River, Mass., and went to 
cooking school at Johnson &AMP; Wales University in Providence, R.I. 
After working at a string of restaurants on the East Coast, he got 
his first break when Ella Brennan hired him to replace Paul Prudhomme 
as the head chef at Commander's Palace in New Orleans. In 1990, he 
opened his own restaurant, Emeril's, in New Orleans. But it wasn't 
until someone discovered that he was a natural on television that 
his career shifted into high gear. Lagasse captivates his audiences 
with a loud, high-octane dialogue. He works the stove, feeds his clamoring 
audience like a zookeeper _ tossing cubes of salami and bags of potato 
chips to them _ and spews cooking tips at random. While most cooking 
shows putt along, for his, the accelerator is pushed to the floor. 
He even has his own cooking language. ``Bam!'' he yells when he slams 
chiles into a sizzling pan. ``Bam!'' he cries as he hurls herbs irreverently 
onto a slab of grilled steak. ``Bam!'' he says when he has nothing 
else to say about a dish. He gives cooking a charged athletic, accessible 
quality, even if you wince every time you know a ``Bam!'' is coming. 
And he relentlessly preaches a gospel of empowerment. ``We're not 
building rocket ships here, folks,'' he will say as he begins a new 
recipe. Or, ``It ain't that difficult,'' as he carves a piece of meat 
with ease. But Lagasse rarely starts and finishes a recipe in a linear 
or comprehensive fashion. He uses no measurements, skips key steps 
and is extremely vague in his instructions. Placing a chicken in a 
pot of water, he once said, ``Now you cook it for a very long time,'' 
leaving viewers to wonder whether he meant an hour or days. And he 
throws around terms _ like deglazing, rendering and chinois _ used 
mainly by professionals. So viewers are left confused about what he 
is saying _ and what he is doing. And yet, they continue to watch. 
Lagasse is most widely credited for making sophisticated cooking accessible 
to mass audiences. But in doing so, he often dumbs down recipes so 
much that he removes all the intellectual effort that goes into creating 
subtle flavors in a dish. Rather than an informative show like David 
Rosengarten's ``Taste'' on the Food Network, where you learn to make 
a dish systematically from beginning to finish, his has become like 
a prime-time sitcom filled with quick hits of humor and lots of action. 
Lagasse insists that to improve a dish you need to ``kick it up a 
notch'' and add extra flavor, usually in the form of garlic, bacon 
or Essence, his own brand of spice mix, which is an incredibly bitter 
mixture of garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme, dried oregano, 
cayenne, sweet paprika, salt and pepper. And by bam-ing everything, 
from crispy-fried redfish to beef tenderloin, with chopped garlic 
and Essence, the underlying message is that simple, well-prepared 
food is not good enough. Consider, for instance, the Southern fried 
chicken with mashed potatoes in ``Emeril's TV Dinners,'' a dish that 
can be extraordinary on its own. Lagasse, though, insists on seasoning 
it with Essence no less than three times during the recipe. What will 
it taste like then? Essence, not buttery, salty chicken. With the 
same irreverence, he regularly abuses classic recipes. His recipe 
for quail with forcemeat in his book ``Louisiana Real &AMP; Rustic'' 
(William Morrow, 1996) is kicked up beyond recognition. He calls it 
an ``old time French dish,'' then proceeds to include his Rustic Rub, 
which contains garlic powder and onion powder, in the forcemeat and 
as as a spice rub on the quail. He does the same to cassoulet, adding 
Rustic Rub to both the meats and the breadcrumb topping. His style 
is loose to the point of sloppy. A ``panzanella'' he made on one recent 
show looked disturbingly like a heap of food headed toward the garbage 
disposal, a gloppy jumble of salami, cheese, radicchio and mozzarella. 
As a finishing touch, he dumped the croutons over top, and added one 
last ``Bam!'' as croutons and cheese tumbled on to the counter surrounding 
the plate. Part of Lagasse's appeal has been his ability to make people 
feel liberated about eating. But he takes that approach so far that 
it almost seems perverse. After reading his books, all I wanted was 
a salad. In ``Emeril's TV Dinners,'' which includes recipes from ``Emeril 
Live,'' one chapter is called ``Pork Fat Rules.'' Sure, it provokes 
a laugh, but who really wants to eat pork burgers in gravy with French-fried 
sweet potatoes? His recipe for smashing smashed potatoes recipe in 
``Louisiana Real &AMP; Rustic'' is downright suicidal. For one and 
a half pounds of potatoes, he calls for a stick of butter, a cup of 
roasted garlic and a cup of heavy cream. A variation suggests covering 
this ghastly mixture with a cup of grated cheddar and baking it in 
the oven. What you get is soupy mashed potatoes that taste of garlic 
and cream and not at all of potato. And if you make the variation, 
your extra effort is rewarded with a layer of cheese and grease that 
rises to the top. His roasted turkey calls for TWO sticks of butter 
(shoved into in slits in the flesh of the bird). I'm not sure anyone 
has lived to tell whether or not it's good. The same book contained 
just one lettuce-based salad, maw-maw's slaw, whose eight servings 
are bound with one and a quarter cups of mayonnaise. The vegetable 
chapter of ``Emeril's TV Dinners'' is no better. All but one recipe 
contains cheese. So many of his dishes somehow boil down to the same 
thing: meat and potatoes. Which brings to light another of Lagasse's 
deceits: he has not brought haute cuisine to a wider audience. He 
has simply repackaged the pillars of the American diet. But Lagasse 
show no signs of stopping, or changing. On the contrary, his fifth 
restaurant, Emeril's of Orlando, is scheduled to open in Florida this 
December. A sixth restaurant, which will be in Las Vegas, is in the 
works for 1999. And television fans will soon have yet another morsel 
to gnaw on: a documentary called ``The Making of Emeril Live,'' which 
debuts Dec. 6 on the Food Network. His fans are blind to any faults 
he might have. They even take the blame for failed recipes, a show 
of tolerance that is practically unheard of in the cookbook world. 
Barbara Ninos, a self-described ``Emerilyte'' who cooks from his books 
each and every Sunday night, still can't get the filling to set on 
the banana cream pie from ``Emeril's New New Orleans Cooking'' (William 
Morrow, 1993). ``It's not his fault,'' she said. ``I know it's mine.'' 
Well, no. When this newspaper tested the recipe, not only did the 
cream not set, but there was also far too much pie dough, too many 
bananas and two and a half cups too much filling for the nine-inch 
pie. Ms. Ninos is just one of many Emeril fanatics, who faint in front 
of him, watch his show religiously, and send him stuffed animal pigs. 
Mrs. Ninos and her family, who were at the turkey taping wearing T-shirts 
from Nola, one of Lagasse's restaurants in New Orleans, had just returned 
from a two-day trip there. A trip they made solely to eat in Lagasse's 
restaurants. ``Why else would you go to New Orleans?'' Mrs. Ninos 
wondered. But why exactly do fans continue to watch, when beneath 
his frail facade there is so little? Perhaps as Eileen Opatut, the 
senior vice president of programming at the Food Network, explained, 
it is the fans themselves. People feel guilty about food, she said, 
but they don't feel guilty about watching television. ``So in some 
ways,'' she said, ``People can get an access to food and comfort on 
television.'' And with ``Emeril Live,'' they can let their hair down, 
take in the butter and cream, and let out a big holler _ ``Pork fat!'' 
If you're hoping to learn much from Emeril, don't get your hopes up 
too high. Here's a sampling of what the fans are served on ``Emeril 
Live'' and in a recent book. Poor cooking skills: On one episode of 
``Emeril Live'' _ the theme was cooking in diners _ Lagasse made a 
simple patty melt. First, he burned the onions on the griddle. As 
the camera zoomed in on the jet-black strands, he said, ``I love when 
the onions are like that.'' Then he charred the bread. Bad technique: 
In his book ``Emeril's Creole Christmas'' (William Morrow, 1997), 
a recipe for truffle risotto with parmesan croutons instructs the 
reader to heat the stock and dump in all the rice at once, without 
stirring. Traditional, creamy risotto is made by sauteeing the aromatics 
and the rice, then adding the heated stock in small increments and 
stirring until the rice is tender. Mangled tradition: ``Now this is 
not a traditional panzanella like if you're a panzanella expert,'' 
Lagasse said on ``Emeril Live.'' ``Hey! What can I say?'' It might 
be nice if he would say what an actual panzanella is: a peasant salad 
of dry bread, tomatoes, olive oil, red onion and sometimes basil. 
Legasse's version isn't a matter of creative license. He's just making 
something else: it includes raw garlic, onions, salami, mozzarella, 
parmesan cheese, radicchio, balsamic vinegar and fried croutons. A 
facade of accessibility: On his show, Lagasse often deep fries the 
likes of onion rings and breaded eggplant. But even if you did want 
to duplicate his efforts at home, you'd have a hard time. He's using 
a professional deep fryer. Sloppy presentation: Preparing an appetizer 
tray of toasts with a variety of simple toppings isn't exactly a finesse 
operation, but it doesn't have to be a a mess either. On one show, 
Lagasse haphazardly topped some toasts with cheese, some with steak, 
some with peppers and some with cheese and meat. Then, instead of 
slicing onions so that they would lay on each one _ as anyone else 
on earth would _ he tossed chunks of raw onion over the entire plate, 
missing many of the toasts. For a finishing touch, he managed to identify 
a couple of the individual toasts in the rubble and dropped a bit 
of creole mustard on each: the unappetizers of the evening.
