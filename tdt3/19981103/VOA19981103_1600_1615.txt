Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. On August 17th, President 
Clinton delivered what could very well be the most memorable speech 
of his presidency: his address to the public concerning his extramarital 
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. So much has 
been revealed about Bill Clinton, the president, but what about Bill 
Clinton, the man? I'm Carol Pearson. Clinton biographer David Maranis 
shares his knowledge Wednesday on "Talk to America." I hope you'll 
join me Wednesday at 17 hours universal time on "Talk to America." 
Today is Tuesday, November 3rd, 1998. Fifty years ago today, the morning 
edition of the November 3rd, 1948 "Chicago Tribune" newspaper had 
a bold headline that read: "Dewey Defeats Truman." This referred to 
the expected victory in the previous day's presidential election of 
New York Governor Thomas Dewey, the Republican candidate over the 
incumbent, Democrat Harry Truman. However, the headline was wrong. 
Later, a picture of a laughing President Truman holding the "Tribune" 
with its incorrect headline, became famous. The editors of the Chicago 
newspaper who had put together the November 3rd edition the night 
before wrote the headline based on premature election returns that 
gave Governor Dewey the victory. They also accepted the nearly unanimous 
forecasts of public opinion surveys that had said Governor Dewey would 
win the election. President Truman himself was one of the few political 
forecasters of either party who believed he would win. President Truman's 
1948 election victory is considered one of the major political upsets 
in American history. Stay tuned for news next on VOA News now. It's 
2130 universal time and this is VOA News Now. The United States and 
Britain say force is an option against Iraq unless he steps down in 
the latest standoff over United Nations weapons inspections. On today's 
DATELINE, a look at differing views of justice and reconciliation. 
All that and more in our next half hour of VOA News Now. First, the 
latest world news.
