In a case that has angered Hispanic residents of Houston, police officials 
here have dismissed six officers involved in a botched drug raid in 
which a Mexican landscaper was killed by police gunfire in his bedroom. 
``I have not seen, in my opinion, a case as egregious as this case,'' 
said Chief Clarence Bradford, who announced the action on Monday night 
after the department committees on civilian review and administrative 
discipline recommended the dismissals. The decision came less than 
two weeks after a grand jury here declined to indict five of the officers 
in the death of the landscaper, Pedro Oregon, and filed a single charge 
of criminal trespass, a misdemeanor, against the sixth officer. Bradford 
said the officers burst into Oregon's apartment on July 12 after Ryan 
F. Baxter, whom they had stopped for public intoxication and who was 
on probation on drug charges, gave the police the name of someone 
he said was his drug supplier in exchange for his own release. With 
an address supplied by Baxter, the six officers raided Oregon's apartment. 
As the officers entered the apartment, one accidentally fired, striking 
another officer who was wearing a bulletproof vest. Believing that 
Oregon had fired the shot, the other officers began shooting, firing 
33 times and hitting Oregon 12 times, Bradford said. Oregon's gun 
was found near his body but was not fired in the raid. An autopsy 
found no drugs or alcohol in his system, nor were any drugs found 
in the apartment. Oregon, a 22-year-old Mexican immigrant, was the 
father of two who coached soccer and worked as a landscaper. He had 
no known criminal record. The internal investigation found that the 
officers had illegally entered the apartment without a search warrant 
and violated police policy by using an unregistered and intoxicated 
informer in an unauthorized narcotics investigation. A Harris County 
grand jury began an investigation of the six officers: Sgt. D.H. Strouse 
and Officers D.R. Barrera, P.A. Herrada, D.R. Perkins, L.E. Tillery, 
and James R. Willis. On Oct. 20, the grand jury returned one count 
of criminal trespass against Willis. That action angered many Hispanic 
residents here and prompted city officials and the Mexican Consulate 
in Houston to request a federal civil rights investigation. A Justice 
Department spokesman said Tuesday that the case was under investigation.
