Voters throughout the United States are casting ballots for local, 
state, and federal office holders today. Despite the attention given 
to the possible impeachment of President Clinton, many voters say 
they're thinking more about local issues as they cast their ballots. 
VOA's Michael Leland reports from Chicago. Tuesday's congressional 
vote is seen by some as a signal from the American people on whether 
they want President Clinton removed from office because of his sex 
and alleged perjury scandal. But Marty Clancy of Chicago says she 
is sending no such signals this election day. Because I think that 
they won't impeach him anyway 'cause it's a bad move and they know 
that, so it really wouldn't matter. And I think we have enough senators 
anyway without, you know, what I mean, that would be enough for them 
both. Ms. Clancy says she's more concerned about U.S. Senator Carol 
Mosely-Braun's future than with President Clinton's. Ms. Mosely-Braun 
is in danger of losing her seat to Republican challenger Peter Fitzgerald, 
who would become the first Illinois Republican elected to the U.S. 
Senate in 20 years. Michael Leland, VOA News, Chicago.
