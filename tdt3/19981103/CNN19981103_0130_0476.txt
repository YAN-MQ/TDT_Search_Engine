The parents of Matthew Eappen, the child who died in the care of British 
au pair Louise Woodward, are asking for several million dollars in 
damages. The eappens won their civil case last summer when Woodward 
did not respond. The judge gave them until Monday to specify damages. 
The family's lawyer says the eappens want to make sure Woodward does 
not profit from their son's death.
