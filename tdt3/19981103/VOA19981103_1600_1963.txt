Astronauts aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery have used the shuttle's 
robot arm to retrieve a solar research satellite. The shuttle crew 
today plucked the satellite out of orbit for the return to Earth in 
the Discovery's cargo bay. The crew had released the satellite Sunday 
to gather data on the sun's atmosphere which ejects a solar wind that 
sometimes disrupts communications and power supplies on Earth.
