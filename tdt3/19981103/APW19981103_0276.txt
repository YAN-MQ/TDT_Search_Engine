Iraq stepped up its rhetoric against the United States on Tuesday, 
with a state-run newspaper urging the country to prepare to battle 
``the U.S. monster'' regardless of the sacrifices. Iraq was certain 
that the battle over the inspections would end in ``victory'' for 
Baghdad and ``humiliation'' for the United States, the Al-Iraq daily 
said in a front-page editorial. The oratory followed the weekend's 
announcement that Iraq was halting the work of U.N. weapons inspectors 
monitors, in essence breaking ties with the group responsible for 
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. But it has continued 
to allow nuclear monitors to work, and has let technical teams ensure 
that U.N. equipment continues to function. Three monitoring teams 
from the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency went 
into the field Tuesday to check three previously declared weapons 
sites, U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said. And a technical team 
of weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, 
went out to deal with a problem involving a camera or a sensor. She 
gave no other details. Iraq accuses the United States and Britain 
of working to prolong the sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its 
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The government has said it will not allow 
inspections to resume until the Security Council agrees to deal with 
the sanctions. It also says the UNSCOM director, Richard Butler, should 
be replaced and that its teams should be more balanced. One longstanding 
Iraqi complaint is that there are too many American and British monitors. 
The sanctions, which limit the sale of oil, Iraq's financial mainstay, 
have devastated the economy. The Security Council has said the sanctions 
will not be lifted until the U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is 
free of non-conventional weapons. The U.N. Security Council has declared 
the decision to ban inspections a ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. resolutions, 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton warned on Monday that military action 
was possible. Tuesday's response was succinct: ``There will be no 
compromise in our decision to halt cooperation with the Special Commission 
and its spies,'' the paper said. ``This decision compels us to fight 
in a battle to redeem our rights.'' It urged Arab nations and other 
countries friendly to Iraq to rally behind Baghdad ``to defeat the 
U.S. monster'' because winning will not only be fruitful for Iraq 
``but for the whole world, which America is pushing to the abyss.'' 
Al-Iraq concluded: ``There will be no backing down this time no matter 
the sacrifices.'' At midmorning, about 100 women mostly covered in 
the black dresses and head scarves of observant Muslims staged a symbolic 
funeral for 60 children that the Health Ministry said died in recent 
days. Such demonstrations, organized by the government, are staged 
several times a month to protest the U.N. trade sanctions, which Iraq 
says have left the country without adequate food and medicine. As 
they marched, the women shouted, ``Today we bury them, tomorrow we 
will avenge them'' and ``America is the enemy of God.'' One of their 
banners read: ``Down America, down Britain because you are killing 
Iraqi children.''
