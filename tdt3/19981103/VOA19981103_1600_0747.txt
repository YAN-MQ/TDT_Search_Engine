South Africa's government has defended it's military deployment in 
the Lasutu a day after it announced it. And Botswana will begin to 
withdraw troops from the tiny kingdom. South African Deputy Foreign 
Minister, Aziz Pahad, says the troops sent to quell violence stemming 
from Lasutu's May elections have restored the political process there. 
The South African government has been sharply criticized by the opposition 
for sending poorly prepared troops to Lasutu. Dozens of people, most 
of them civilians, died in the subsequent fighting.
