The conservative Christian coalition has mounted a massive effort 
to get out the vote for the candidates it favors today. John king 
reports from Indianapolis. Prayer and politics go hand-in-hand on 
the Sunday before election day, as the Christian coalition looks to 
put its stamp on election '98. The coalition distributed 1.1 million 
of these voter guides Sunday in indiana, 36 million nationwide in 
conservative Churches where politics is gospel. Our responsibility 
is to step forward and to vote our conscience. And I pray that you 
will help each one to do that. And the sumpb said Amen. The biggest 
complaint in this year's election is that turnout will be dismally 
low. But religious conservatives now rival the elderly as the nation's 
most-committed voters and the leafletting at this church and thousands 
like it across the country is part of an effort to use its clout to 
tip the scales in close races. CNN was granted an unprecedented behind-the-scenes 
look at the inner workings of a political organization that spends 
the millions raised from checks like these on a grassroots network 
that its many critics can only envy. You making calls? do it, do it. 
What's going on? What do you hear? In an age of 30-second attack ads, 
the Christian coalition focuses instead on using the latest technology 
to build its grassroots network. This computer program maps friendly 
Churches and voters state-by-state, neighborhood-by-neighborhood. 
I don't know if anyone else does this. Pretty state of the art. Computer-generated 
calls are made by the thousands, reminding christian conservatives 
to vote on Tuesday. The mail brings another reminder that it's time 
to vote. Repetition is the coalition's recipe for success. John king, 
CNN, Indianapolis.
