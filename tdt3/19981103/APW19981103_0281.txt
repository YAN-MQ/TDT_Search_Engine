Pakistan fought back to hold Australia to a 4-4 tie in the 20th Champions 
Trophy men's field hockey tournament Tuesday. Pakistan was down 3-1 
late in the second half until quick goals by Atif Bashir and Sohail 
Abbas tied the score. However, Troy Elder gave Australia a 4-3 advantage 
when he received a well-timed pass from Scott Webster. With only two 
minutes left on the clock, Bashir once again rescued Pakistan and 
got the much-needed equalizer off a fine pass from Imran Yousuf. Earlier, 
Australia opened the scoring with Brent Livermore's ninth minute field 
goal, and captain Jay Stacy doubled the lead with a penalty score. 
Pakistan narrowed the gap to 2-1 just before halftime when Naveed 
Iqbal capitalized on a fine cross from Haider Hussain. Stacy scored 
his second goal four minutes into the second half when a powerful 
shot off his team's seventh short corner beat Pakistan custodian Mohammad 
Qasim. Australia now has five points after three matches with one 
victory and two draws. Pakistan, beaten 4-3 in its opening match against 
South Korea, has two points following tie games against Spain and 
Australia. Result: Australia 4 (Brent Livermore (9th min), Jay Stacy 
(12th min, 40th min), Troy Elder (67th min); Pakistan 4 (Naveed Iqbal 
(34th min), Atif Bashir (60th min, 68th min), Sohail Abbas (65th min).
