Relief workers are struggling to help the victims of hurricane Mitch 
in central America. Whole villages were wiped off the map by floods 
and mudslides in Nicaragua and Honduras. Authorities confirm at least 
1,300 deaths but fear as many as 7,000 may be dead. The president 
of Honduras says his country faces a "panorama of death, desolation 
and ruin."
