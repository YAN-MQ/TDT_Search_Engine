NBC news today show co-host Matt Lauer is now at the victorious headquarters 
of Charles Schumer, senator-elect from New York. Good evening to you. 
The roar went up two minutes ago as the projection was heard and scene 
on monitors around this room. This is the election night headquarters 
for Chuck Schumer, after a bitter, negative and expensive campaign 
he has defeated Alfonse D'Amato in this race for Senate. This was 
a race that got very personal at times. Of course, Alfonse D'Amato 
is the head of the Senate banking committee. He was the man at the 
helm of the Senate hearings into Whitewater. Many people at the White 
House felt that he was too hard on Hillary Rodham clinton. So the 
president, the first lady, the vice president, all made campaign appearances 
on behalf of Chuck Schumer. 10 appearances in all. Apparently they 
paid off. Chuck Schumer has now ended the run of Alfonse D'Amato in 
the Senate. Couple of numbers from the exit polling, Brian, that might 
be of interest to you. The Jewish vote has always been a stronghold 
for Alfonse D'Amato, this time with Chuck Schumer being a Jewish candidate, 
he received 75% of the Jewish vote, Alfonse D'Amato received 24% a 
nother note on the subject of honesty, we asked people if they felt 
Alfonse D'Amato was honest. 30% said yes. 62% said no. Maybe a backlash 
there to some of the Negative campaign ads that have been flooding 
the airwaves here in New York state for the past couple of months. 
Any way, we do not know if the candidate is in the building right 
now. I saw him a second ago on the monitor. He's expected to address 
his supporters a short while from now. A big win for the democrats. 
A very big win for Chuck Schumer. Brian, back to you. Matt Lauer, 
the man who served in Congress for 18 years now, Chuck Schumer, democrat 
of Brooklyn is going to the U.S. Senate.
