International observers were still demanding Tuesday to be given seats 
in the corruption and sexual misconduct trial of Anwar Ibrahim. U.N. 
Rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy, himself on trial in Malaysia for defamation, 
said Malaysia was hurting its image by barring dozens of international 
human rights, judicial and diplomatic observers from the trial. ``By 
not allowing the international community to come in and observe the 
trial, the prime minister is undermining the name of the country,'' 
Param said outside the red-brick High Court Tuesday. Judge Augustine 
Paul ruled before the trial formally began Monday that international 
observers would not be given special observer status and could watch 
the trial on a first-come, first-serve basis. But most could not get 
into the small courtroom. Paul called the appeal by Anwar's lawyers 
on behalf of the observers an ``insult to the court.'' ``There is 
no reason to let foreigners check us,'' he said. Representatives of 
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch did get seats in the 
public gallery. Special status would have meant reserved seats and 
allowing them to formally report on the the trial. Adnan Buyong Nasution, 
an Indonesian attorney with the Geneva-based International Commission 
of Jurists, managed to get a seat in the courtroom Tuesday. ``This 
trial doesn't impress me at all,'' he said. ``It's full of irregularities. 
The judge isn't responsive enough in a case fraught with heavy political 
impact.'' Anwar, sacked by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 
2 as his deputy and finance minister, is on trial for alleged corruption 
and illegal sexual acts. His case generated international concern 
after he appeared with a black eye and bruises during his arraignment. 
Anwar, who has pleaded innocent to the charges, which he calls politically 
motivated, said he was beaten by police the night of his arrest Sept. 
20. ``If Malaysia wants to be in the Security Council of the United 
Nations and also play an important role in the international global 
community, why is it afraid of letting foreign observers in?'' Param 
said. Last month, Malaysia was granted one of 10 non-permanent seats 
on the U.N. Security Council. The United States complained loudly 
Monday about a U.S. diplomat and other representatives of foreign 
embassies being turned away from the proceedings. ``We believe that 
given the enormous interest in this trial, it is in Malaysia's interest 
to follow the policy announced by the High Court and allow spectators 
to observe the trial on a first-come, first-serve basis, including 
representatives of the international and local organizations, as well 
as diplomats,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
