A sordid tale of greed, jealousy and hate came to a close Tuesday 
when a Milan court convicted the ex-wife of fashion heir Maurizio 
Gucci of his contract murder and sentenced her to 29 years in prison. 
All five defendants in the trial were convicted of premeditated murder, 
with the accused hitman getting the stiffest sentence, life imprisonment. 
Italy does not have the death penalty. Onetime-socialite Patrizia 
Reggiani Martinelli, dubbed the ``black widow'' by Italy's press, 
blinked a few times when the judge read out her sentence for the murder 
of her ex-husband and then, her eyes red-rimmed, lowered her head. 
Gucci, the last of his family to hold a stake in the maker of luxury 
loafers, handbags and other accessories with the famed double-G logo, 
was shot four times as he walked into his office building on March 
27, 1995. Prosecutors alleged that Reggiani Martinelli, 49, paid the 
four co-defendants to eliminate Gucci, whom she had publicly made 
clear she despised. They painted her as a greedy woman who wasn't 
content with her dlrs 860,000 a year alimony and feared that Gucci's 
new companion would devour his wealth. Earlier in the day, when Judge 
Renato Semek Ludovici allowed the defendants one last plea to the 
jury, Reggiani Martinelli declared: ``I was naive to the point of 
stupidity,'' renewing her denial that she had ordered the slaying.
