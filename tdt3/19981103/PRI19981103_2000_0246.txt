The ex-wife of Italian fashion magnate, Maurizio Gucci, has been found 
guilty of plotting his murder three years ago. Prosecutors said Patrizia 
Reggiani wanted to get her hands on his money. Italians have been 
gripped by the five-month trial which involved stories of jealousy, 
hate, and astrology. Rhonda Garrin reports from Rome. The late Maurizio 
Gucci was gunned down outside his office in Milan in 1995. Patricia 
Reggiani, who in her youth was said to resemble Elizabeth Taylor, 
was dubbed "the black widow" by the Italian media. She admitted paying 
up after the killing, but blamed the whole thing on her former close 
friend, a self-proclaimed clairvoyant. Both women were found guilty, 
together with three accomplices. The former Mrs. Gucci will be leaving 
behind a life of luxury for a 29- year term in jail. Pamela Garrin 
in Rome.
