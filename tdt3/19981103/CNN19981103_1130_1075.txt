Donna Karan stores facing dismal sales lately. The up-scale fashion 
design house reporting third quarter profits soared, but still disappointed 
Wall Street analysts. The company predicts earnings will be flat for 
the entire year. And warns that it's selling its bloated inventories 
at lower than expected margins. Donna Karan blames weak demand from 
Asia, and at its outlet stores in this country. Shares of Donna Karan 
are down more than a half, at 7 9/16.
