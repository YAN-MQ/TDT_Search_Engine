Beck sees dead ends everywhere on his new album, ``Mutations.'' Creativity 
and culture are played out, love has faded away. There aren't even 
any new jokes to be told. ``Who wants to be there to sweep the debris, 
to harness dead horses?'' he sings. Well, for the length of the album, 
it seems that Beck does. He contemplates entropy and decay with his 
most lucid and unguarded songs, as he renounces his old studio tomfoolery. 
Some of the songs could be about long-lost love, but nearly all of 
them also read as impressions of a time when the only certainty is 
a free-floating sense of loss. On previous albums, Beck has been a 
quizzical but resourceful post-modernist, sorting through the fragments 
and juxtapositions of an era that offers a surfeit of information 
with no clear hierarchies or boundaries. ``I'm picking up the pieces 
and I'm putting them up for sale,'' he sang on ``Odelay,'' while his 
music turned those pieces into sonic collages that could be zany or 
oddly affecting. ``Mutations'' (DGC) is more reflective. Facing the 
same post-modern situation, its songs muse on what it means when ``Dead 
ends they won't come to life any more.'' Yet even as he writes about 
being immobilized, he finds beauty, insight and sly humor. The way 
Beck, 28, tells it, ``Mutations'' simply happened to fall together. 
He had just finished more than two years of touring and had a band 
sharpened by constant performing. He also had a backlog of songs and 
a handful of new ones. He thought he would make an album for Bong 
Load Records, an independent label, that would be a low-key sidetrip 
from his million-selling albums on DGC Records, ``Mellow Gold'' from 
1994 and ``Odelay'' from 1996. A producer he wanted to work with, 
Nigel Godrich (who recorded Radiohead's ``OK Computer''), was available 
for just two weeks. So Beck and his band made up arrangements on the 
spot, mostly performing live in the studio and often finishing a song 
a day. By the time the two weeks were up, Beck had a complete album. 
Soon afterward, DGC decided that it was worth a full major-label release 
and acquired it from Bong Load. ``We were doing it so quickly we didn't 
have time to think about it,'' Beck said in an interview in his house. 
He looks like he hasn't slept much; he's stubbly and rumpled, speaking 
slowly and carefully in a deeper register than his singing voice. 
The music on ``Mutations'' sounds old-fashioned in places. It draws 
on blues, honky-tonk, folk-rock, country waltzes and bossa nova; its 
influences stop short chronologically before the hip-hop sampling 
and drum machines that gave Beck his hits. But the tunes can't take 
refuge in the past. Chords wander in wayward directions, away from 
traditional paths; oddball instruments and electronic sounds flicker 
at the edges. The new songs are stranded between eras in an unmistakably 
1990s way, full of anachronisms and odd linkages; they're ``looking 
back at some dead world that looks so new,'' Beck sings. ``People 
write that I dig through the pickle barrel of the past,'' he said. 
``But I think of the music of the last hundred years as contemporary. 
It's all part of a fluid continuous line. People have a general sense 
of superiority to the past, but I don't think we're any smarter or 
more enlightened. We were still the same people 80 years ago as we 
were 20 years ago. I also think that when you come to the end of something 
you really have to go back to the beginning.'' That end is not, he 
insists, the end of the century. ``I'm trying hard not to make any 
millennial statements,'' he said. ``People are too hung up on that. 
For the millennium, I just want to come out with a party record with 
dumb sounds and dumb songs and dumb lyrics.'' ``Mutations'' marks 
a change that's more private than an adjustment of the calendar. Beck, 
whose albums, stage shows and television appearances have been full 
of deadpan parodies, says he is ready to give up irony. ``I've been 
guilty of irony and cynicism, those things that are symptomatic of 
our times,'' he said. ``You can't really blame anybody, in the way 
irony and cynicism are pounded into everybody's heads in every TV 
commercial, as if we're all insiders on the big joke here. But there's 
got to be more than just the joke. I'm trying to be more conscientious 
of certain attitudes and try to grow beyond them and come up with 
something new.'' ``Mutations'' doesn't move with the giddy metamorphoses 
of Beck's DGC albums. Nor does it go back to the sketchy, folky sound 
of ``One Foot in the Grave,'' a 1994 side project that he released 
on K Records. Yet the music isn't a complete departure from Beck's 
past albums; it's a continuation of woozy, country-and-fuzztone songs 
like ``Pay No Mind (Snoozer)'' on ``Mellow Gold'' and ``Lord Only 
Knows'' on ``Odelay.'' Most of the new songs gaze at the general decline 
with a calm, thoughtful tone, while bending old frameworks way out 
of shape. ``Bottle of Blues,'' which sees Viagra as something that 
masks a deep malaise, has a 12-string strum that harks back to Lead 
Belly, but it veers away from the shape of the blues and finds distorted 
synthesizer solos and wah-wah guitar sneaking into the mix. ``Nobody's 
Fault But Mine,'' about the ruins of a romance, could have been a 
Neil Young meditation, but floats instead on an Indian drone. ``Tropicalia'' 
is a bossa nova that looks at a decaying resort city where ``The embassies 
lie in hideous shards/Where tourists snore and decay''; true to the 
sonic irreverence of the 1960s Brazilian musical revolution called 
Tropicalia, the arrangement merges typical bossa nova flute and trombone 
with swooping, bubbling synthesizer noises. And ``Sing It Again,'' 
arranged like a Willie Nelson waltz complete with an acoustic guitar 
solo, wanders into unlikely chords as Beck sings, ``Oh won't you lay 
my bags upon the funeral fire?'' Beck expects to warp his sources. 
``You can't write a pure country song any more,'' he said. ``You can't 
write a pure Appalachian ballad. Because we live in a world where 
we've all heard speed-metal, we've all heard drum-and-bass, we've 
all heard old-school hip-hop. Even if you're not influenced by it 
or you're not using elements of it, they're in your mind. That's why 
I called the album `Mutations,' because it's trying to embrace the 
evolution, embrace the impurity of the music.'' The old, noisy, style-hopping 
Beck re-emerges on the album's last song, hidden after the stately 
trudge of ``Static,'' a song about the temptations of resignation 
and ``convalescent bliss.'' In the untitled song, Beck starts with 
the electric harpsichord and airy harmonies of mid-1960s pop, then 
dives toward a fuzz-toned psychedelic bass and freakout drumming, 
then shifts through some tempo changes. Yet within the music's manic 
thrills, he sings about ``derelict boulevards'' and ``no direction 
to be known.'' If there is a way out, it's the paradoxical perseverance 
that turns up in ``We Live Again,'' a dreamy, hovering waltz about 
old age and death. ``The end of the end,'' Beck sings. ``We live again/Oh, 
I grow weary of the end.'' Somehow, it sounds like hope.
