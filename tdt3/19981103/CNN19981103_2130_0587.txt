The shuttle astronauts are using their time in space to study how 
plants found in the rain forest could cure a human disease. Ann Kellan 
has more in this edition of "tech trends." The tropical rainforest 
-- home to millions of species of plants and animals, many of them 
still undiscovered by humans. Some of the treasures of the rainforest 
are going for a ride on the space shuttle. And the result could be 
a cure for a deadly disease. Chagas disease is a problem mainly in 
rural areas of Latin America, where it kills thousands of people every 
year and infects millions. It's spread by bugs that live in the walls, 
ceilings or floors of poorly constructed houses. The bugs carry a 
deadly parasite that is passed on to people when bug droppings get 
into their eyes, mouth or cuts in the skin. Five years ago, U.S. astronaut 
Franklin Chang Diaz, who was born in Costa rica, had an idea for fighting 
chagas disease. It was based on experiments that he'd been doing on 
the space shuttle and a New approach to drug design. This is a new 
way in which medicines are made -- using the weightless environment 
of space to create crystals which then give you the internal structure 
of any substance that you're looking for. The project, called chagaspace, 
brings together scientists from south and central America and the 
United States. They collect and analyze plants from the rainforest 
that might be turned into drugs against chagas disease. Scientists 
crystallize compounds from the plants, proteins from the parasite 
and mixtures of the two. Crystals produced in space are often much 
better formed than earthbound crystals, because they form without 
interference from gravity. While the biggest hope of the chagaspace 
researchers is to find a cure for chagas disease, they say everyone 
has gained from this international cooperation. Ann Kellan, "Headline
