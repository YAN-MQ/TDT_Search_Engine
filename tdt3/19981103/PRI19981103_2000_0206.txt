Washington says it's satisfied with the security plan drawn up by 
the Palestinians as part of last month's peace deal with Israel, despite 
Israeli concerns that it does not go far enough. The Israel government 
has yet to ratify the deal. They say the sticking point is the Palestinians 
failure to arrest 30 people accused of terrorist offenses.
