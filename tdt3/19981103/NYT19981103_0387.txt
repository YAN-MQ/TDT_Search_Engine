James L. Day, a former Marine Corps squad leader who belatedly won 
a Medal of Honor earlier this year for almost single-handedly killing 
more than 100 advancing Japanese at the height of the battle for Okinawa, 
and went on to become an unofficial ambassador of good will on the 
island, died on Oct. 28 at his home in Cathedral City, Calif. He was 
73. The cause was a heart attack, family members said. Day did not 
receive the medal until President Clinton presented it to him last 
January at a White House ceremony, because most of the men who witnessed 
his gallantry were soon killed in another action. There were snags 
as well. Over the years, paperwork got lost, then discovered and then 
lost again. But by 1995, statements from eight witnesses were assembled 
telling how Day, who retired from the Marine Corps as a major general, 
repelled enemy attacks by hurling hand grenades and blazing away with 
his carbine and a light machine gun. All this despite suffering white 
phosphorus burns over much of his body (from friendly fire) and fragmentation 
wounds on his hands when his machine gun overheated and exploded. 
Some waves of enemy infantry consisted of as many as 40 men, according 
to the citation, and nearly a dozen of them came to within a few feet 
of Day's fox hole. After being knocked unconscious by an artillery 
shell, Day was found surrounded by the bodies of the more than 100 
Japanese infantrymen he had killed. ``There was really no good reason 
for me to fall back,'' he said in an interview. ``I expected help 
to come at any time. It just never came, so I kept doing what I was 
doing.'' The action took place on May 14 and 15, 1945. Day was then 
a member of the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Marines, 6th Division, which bore 
the brunt of the fighting. The battle for Okinawa, which began on 
Easter Sunday, was not only the last but also one of the bloodiest 
battles of the Pacific war. U.S. and Japanese commanders recognized 
that the island, only 350 miles south of the nearest of the Japanese 
home islands, was the final barrier to an invasion of Japan. In 81 
days of intense fighting, with a sharp increase in the use of kamikaze 
aircraft, U.S. losses came to 12,500. The Japanese death toll rose 
to 120,000, and more than 150,000 civilians died. Day returned to 
Okinawa in 1984 as commanding general of U.S. Marine Corps bases in 
the Far East with headquarters in Okinawa. On that tour, he said, 
he became aware of how little Okinawan cultural property had survived. 
Since his discharge in 1986, he played a major role in returning more 
than 130 works of art and artifacts that had been removed by Americans 
during and after the war. One of his most important recoveries came 
in 1991, when Day secured approval for the return of a 15th-century 
temple bell seized by Marines on Okinawa in June 1945; for the next 
45 years, it was exhibited as a war trophy at the Virginia Military 
Institute in Lexington. Day was praised for his efforts to recover 
lost Okinawan cultural property by Shizuo Kishaba, president of the 
Ryuku-America Historical Research Society in Okinawa who flew from 
Japan to California to attend the funeral. ``Our culture was in danger 
of being erased from the earth,'' Kishaba said. ``General Day spared 
us that fate.'' Day is survived by his wife, Sally; a daughter, Gayle 
Eustice, of Barstow, Calif.; and three sons, Bill, of Atlanta, Jim, 
of Honolulu, and Matt, of San Diego.
