With its advertising revenue falling short of projections and three 
resource-intensive news initiatives just getting under way, The Los 
Angeles Times announced Tuesday that it would cut its 6,400-member 
work force by 250 people, or nearly 4 percent. The newspaper is trying 
to return its staffing to the leaner level of 1995, when it eliminated 
the equivalent of 700 full-time jobs. High-margin help-wanted advertising, 
which accounts for more than 16 percent of total advertising revenue, 
fell sharply in the third quarter. This setback came as the paper, 
which is owned by Times Mirror Co., was bringing out its Southern 
California Living section, which started on Sunday, and its national 
edition, which started Oct. 5. More than 40 new positions have been 
added to the news department this year for these ventures and for 
expanded business and health coverage. About 50 jobs in the regional 
Ventura and Valley editions _ about one-third of the total _ are now 
being eliminated. Most of those employees are expected to find jobs 
elsewhere in the 1,100-member news department. Overall, 30 news employees 
will leave the newspaper through a voluntary severance program, as 
will 20 in the operations department. Customer-service calls will 
be contracted to APAC Teleservices; 130 employees who did this work 
will be laid off. The remaining layoffs will be scattered around the 
newspaper.
