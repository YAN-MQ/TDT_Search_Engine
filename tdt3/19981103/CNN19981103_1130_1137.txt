That's "Dollars & Sense." Back to you, Catherine. Good to see you, 
Valerie, thanks. Boxer Mike Tyson may be back in the ring in January. 
Details next in "CNN Headline Sports." By the end of the week, seven 
more lives will be saved. By the end of the day, sixteen people who 
couldn't walk, will. By the end of the hour, these special filters 
will help make twenty-five thousand more gallons of water ready for 
drinking. And by the end of this message one more premature baby will 
be protected. All of which is made possible with the help of a material 
we call plasti if you could accompany your data on its trip overseas 
the experience would be alarming. Local carriers handing it to national 
carriers over to cable carriers... till you don't know who has your 
data. Unless you send it through here. With the one and only company 
that owns the entire network-- local, national, and international. 
So you know who has your data. On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
