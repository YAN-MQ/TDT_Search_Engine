Dutch telecommunications giant Royal KPN NV said Tuesday that it will 
eliminate 3,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting restructuring program. 
KPN said the reorganization, which was announced in April and will 
cost 800 million guilders (dlrs 427.8 million) this year, is meant 
to enhance its efficiency. The company will cut 4,000 jobs in the 
coming three years but also will create 1,000 new positions in growth 
sectors such as Internet activities and mobile telephone and information 
technology. KPN said the deepest cuts will be made in the fields of 
fixed network operations, construction and maintenance, at directory 
inquiries and in its installation business. Included in the cuts are 
1,000 jobs in KPN's corporate office and service units. KPN said layoffs 
will ``probably be unavoidable.''
