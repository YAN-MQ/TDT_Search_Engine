Negotiations that begin this week in New Delhi on trade, terrorism, 
drug trafficking and other issues will be a tough test of India's 
contention that it doesn't need to talk about Kashmir to improve relations 
with uneasy neighbor Pakistan. Pakistan made a concession when it 
agreed to the New Delhi talks, but now insists they're merely a sideshow 
to negotiations on the Kashmir territorial dispute that has fueled 
two wars. Pakistan's top foreign office bureaucrat and his Indian 
counterpart discussed Kashmir in the Pakistani capital last month, 
but their consultations yielded little more than pledges to meet again 
in February. Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf told 
The Associated Press on Monday he expected no breakthroughs in New 
Delhi, saying there could be no increased cooperation until the ``core 
Kashmir problem'' is solved. India nonetheless tried to ensure an 
optimistic atmosphere, announcing Monday that it would soon release 
39 Pakistani fishermen who were detained Oct. 24 for violating Indian 
waters. India and Pakistan both routinely detain each others' fishermen, 
and efforts to speed releases were expected to get a boost during 
the New Delhi talks. The Kashmir dispute, though, shadows many of 
the issues on the New Delhi agenda. On Thursday, the first day of 
talks, officials will discuss a water-sharing project involving a 
Kashmiri river. The next day, Siachen, a glacier battlefield in Kashmir, 
comes up for discussion between defense ministry officials. An Indian 
foreign ministry official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, 
said the best that could be hoped for was an agreement to stop the 
almost daily skirmishing across Siachen. The two countries cannot 
even agree on whether they agreed to withdraw troops from the glacier 
when they last met on the issue, in 1992. In all, six days of talks 
are scheduled between Thursday and Nov. 13 on issues ranging from 
the tangled Siachen dispute to starting bus service between the Indian 
capital and the Pakistani border city of Lahore. Bharat Karnad, a 
national security expert at New Delhi's independent Center for Policy 
Research, said the talks with the most potential are probably those 
focusing on trade, scheduled for Nov. 10. Among other things, officials 
were to discuss a proposal for cash-strapped Pakistan to sell electricity 
to India. ``It's a great hook to tempt the Pakistanis on an issue 
that makes economic sense to them. Once that's settled ... I think 
you'll see more give and take on both sides,'' Karnad said. ``It's 
a great beginning. If there's going to be any advancement at all in 
the political realm, it's going to come in the wake of trade ties. 
I think the Pakistanis are slowly coming to realize this.''
