British tennis players Tim Henman and Greg Rozebsky have kept alive 
their hopes of playing in the elite ATP championships as they both 
scored straight sets wins at the Paris Indoor Open. The ninth seated 
Henman needed only 68 minutes to defeat promising French teenager 
Arnot Depascali 6-3, 6-3 on Tuesday, while number 13 Rozebsky beat 
Nicholas Kiefer of Germany, 6-3, 6-4. The did not go as well for 14th 
seated Gorn Evanisovich of Croatia as he was eliminated by American 
Todd Martin, 4-6, 6-1, and 7-6. Both Henman and Rozebsky are vying 
for a berth at the lucrative ATP championships to be played later 
this month in Hanover, Germany. Only two of the eight slots in the 
tournament are still available.
