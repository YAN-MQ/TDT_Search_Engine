Top stories are next. And still ahead -- behind the scenes of a labor 
dispute at ABC. Do you know me? Not yet. I'm starting my own business... 
...and that's a little scary. For me the card is my support system. 
I rely on it to build my office fill my closets, buy business lunches, 
dinners... and when it all gets to be too much... I rely on it to 
bring me home. It's good to know there's someone there when you need 
them. The difference is membership.
