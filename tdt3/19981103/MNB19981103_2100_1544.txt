Laura ingraham and Howard fineman joining us here. It seems to me 
based on what the exit polls are saying and the turnout of african-American 
voters and how that was decisive in New York and South Carolina. The 
American voter is saying the republican majority? The house and Senate 
have squandered their successes from 1994. It's totally level playing 
field going into the 2000 election. Laura, that's a stunning defeat. 
Slight exaggeration. 1994 and 1996 republicans have won high numbers 
of seats which is part of the reason they're not winning that much 
this year. They had a muddled message going into the fall and compromised 
on the budget. That hurt their base -- which was angry about the Clinton 
and Lewinsky matter, but wasn't energized to fight back on the Negative 
campaigning, like the again denying race. Remember those ads in the 
last week eeverb everyone talked about. The republicans ended up with 
the worst of both worlds. They energizeded democrats but were too 
late to energize their base. In other words, the republicans brought 
happy democrats to the polls. They're not bringing their own people 
out. What the republicans needed to do to get their Christian coalition 
base out is say, if this is a moral matter, let's here emotion. It's 
interesting the issue related constituents Si politics worked for 
the republicans as well as the democrats. In Texas George W. bush 
benefits from a turnout from Hispanics. I have two words, spannish 
lessons. Both George and Jeb bush speak Spanish. And consist ensy 
in message. Both bushes refused to talk about the Lewinsky matter. 
They stuck to their local issues driving the voters to the polls. 
Republicans didn't do that. I was one of the people who said the republicans 
had a consistent theme throughout on Clinton and Lewinsky. Maybe that 
wasn't the right thing. Is there a repudeation of the media? We have 
been talking about the decisiveness and significance of this impeachment 
business for eight months now. The voters have a message for us, too. 
The message is it's possible to walk and chew gum at the same time. 
We as voters can disapprove of Bill Clinton's personal behavior and 
still like what he's doing as president. Which is what the house was 
saying all along. Your last word? People are cynical abouthe media. 
That's politics. Howardened and Laura, we'll be back. Stay with us.
