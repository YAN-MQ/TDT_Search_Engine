hours universal time from Washington. This is VOA News Now. Defense 
Secretary William Cohen is visiting Europe and the Persian Gulf to 
consult with U.S. allies about Iraq's latest refusal to cooperate 
with U.N. weapons inspectors. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
says the Palestinians still have not provided a key element of their 
security plan. International observers continue to arrive in Kosovo 
to monitor the security situation there. We'll hear from the head 
of the observer mission. Americans entered the polls today in midterm 
elections that will determine the makeup of the next Congress and 
which could decide the future of President Clinton. We'll have a report.
