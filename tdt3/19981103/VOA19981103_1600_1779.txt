I'm Robert Burns, VOA News. As Iraq continues to defy international 
weapons inspectors, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright describes 
the situation as grave. She says all options, including military force, 
are possible. VOA's Gil Butler reports from the State Department. 
Secretary Albright said the focus now is on consultations. She told 
reporters she's been on the telephone almost constantly for the past 
48 hours while Defense Secretary Cohen consults in person in the region. 
She said the United Nations Security Council is considering a resolution 
that would put into official form a very strong demand issued last 
Saturday that Iraq cooperate with the weapons inspections. But she 
made clear authority for military options already exist. Let me say 
that the United States believes that we have all authority we need 
to use military force if we have to because the international community 
has spoken on this any number of times. Mrs. Albright said the objective 
of holding out the threat of force is to get Iraq to cooperate with 
U.N. inspections. Gil Butler, VOA News, the State Department.
