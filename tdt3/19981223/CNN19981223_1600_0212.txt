A balloon team trying to circle the globe nonstop is expected to fly 
out of chinese airspace today. British tycoon Richard Branson and 
two teammates will then head over south korea toward Japan. Yesterday, 
China agreed not to ground the balloon, even though it had veered 
off its original course and into unauthorized airspace. The balloon 
team began its trip December 18th in Morocco.
