Finally tonight, a different dining experience. Who hasn't gone to 
a restaurant and thought, maybe it's a little cramped? The seats aren't 
all that comfortable? Or the service is awful? You might get up and 
leave. Well, in Japan, ABC's Mark Litke has found one restaurant where 
that is not an option. You've got to believe that a meal in a prison 
would rank as one of the world's worst possible dining experiences. 
But don't tell it to the Japanese. Just dying to dine behind bars 
at perhaps the strangest new restaurant in tokyo. The name of this 
place, no surprise, is Alcatraz and the prison experience it serves 
up begins right here at the front gate, which doesn't open until you 
stick your hand in this security scanner. Then once inside, you got 
it. And the cuffs stay on until your personal cell door slams shut. 
Now, why in a nation famous for both its lack of crime and its food, 
why would anyone want to get locked up for dinner? Drinks served in 
hype determinic Needles, toilet paper for napkins, this businessman 
says it makes him feel liberated from his ordinary button down life. 
These women say they get a thrill from the sense of danger. And the 
owner, who got the idea from American movies, of course, says it's 
really very Japanese. To experience something strange and foreign 
without ever leaving the safety of their home islands. In fact, in 
this joint, if America isn't your thing, you can also choice a North 
African prison cell or a jungle prison camp set under sheltering mosquito 
nets. Bizarre you say? Absolutely. But in this safe and law abiding 
nation, you just don't get many opportunities like this. Mark Litke, 
ABC News, Tokyo. Different, I guess, but I thought most restaurants 
had bars.
