A group of NBA players say they've developed a proposal that will 
end the nearly six-month old lockout imposed by team owners. Agents 
for the players, who asked not to be identified, are trying to convince 
the player's union chief, Billy Hunter, to accept their plan. The 
proposal would essentially, accept the league's latest stands for 
a new collective bargaining agreement. But, the new plan includes 
the designation of so-called "fanchise" players who would not be subject 
to salary caps.
