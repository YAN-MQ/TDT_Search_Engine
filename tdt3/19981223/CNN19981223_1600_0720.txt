New research may end concerns over epidurals, which are a type of 
anesthesia administered to women during childbirth. Some doctors have 
maintained receiving an epidural makes a woman more likely to require 
a caesarean section. But a new study of over 2,000 women concludes 
epidurals are not the cause of C-sections. It says child births that 
require epidurals are complicated and painful deliveries that likely 
would result in C-sections anyway. The study appears in the "journal 
of the American medical association."
