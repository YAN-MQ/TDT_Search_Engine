City governments, across the United States, are preparing law suits 
intended to hold hand-gun makers responsible for the multi-billion 
dollar cost of violent crime. The Washington Post reports, elected 
officials and gun-control advocates, are inspired by the success of 
lawsuits against tobacco companies. They see a chance to hit handgun 
makers with so many lawsuits in so many places that the industry will 
be forced to pay huge monetary settlements, and accept tough new regulations 
on the sale of their products. Philadelphia mayor, Ed Rendell, has 
proposed simultaneous filing of law suits, by as many as 100 cities, 
on the same day sometime next year.
