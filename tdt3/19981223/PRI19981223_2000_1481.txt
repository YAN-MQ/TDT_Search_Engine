1998 will not be remembered fondly by international bankers. Analysts 
say the flight from risky investments was mishandled. The latest from 
Liz George of our business desk in New York. The BIS was formed in 
1930. It's owned and controlled by central banks around the world. 
Basically, it's a meeting place for central bankers, providing a forum 
for cooperation and discussion. It's also a bank for central banks 
and international financial institutions. One of its most important 
committees is the banking supervision committee, now headed up by 
William McDonough. The banking supervision committee has two major 
chores facing us in 1999. The first is that we're going to be putting 
out a report in either January or early February on the 1998 experience 
with what some called hedge funds, we prefer to call highly leveraged 
institutions. We will be putting out an analysis of what happened 
and then a best practices paper for banks and securities firms which 
engage as either lenders or counterparties with the highly leveraged 
institutions. The other thing we're doing, which is a bit longer term 
project, is a revision of the Basle capital accord, which is mandatory 
fairly early on in the G-10 countries and then is subscribed to by 
a great many emerging market countries will be shifted to one that 
is really much more meaningful in the rather more developed creative 
financial markets of 1999. Will it be able to prevent another 1998 
happening? We can never fully prevent financial market participants 
from making mistakes. We can only make it less likely that errors 
will be repeated, and we will certainly try to do that. We can never 
make it impossible. And you really don't want to make it impossible 
because the nature of financial intermediation, which is what creates 
growth in a market economy, is that there is always experimentation. 
There's always trial. And with trial, there will always be some error. 
What one wishes to do is to seek to avoid that error reaching a level 
of importance that it could really be a threat to the well-being of 
the peoples of our countries. That's our task for next year. Big task. 
You bet. William McDonough, chairman of the banking supervision committee 
for the Bank of International Settlements and president of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York. For The World, I'm Liz George in New York.
