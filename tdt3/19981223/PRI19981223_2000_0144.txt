National security adviser Sandy Berger says Washington will attack 
Iraq again if president Saddam Hussein rearms. He adds the administration 
will do all it can to strengthen Iraqi opposition. If we are serious, 
we must do this carefully, not noisily. We will not play recklessly 
with the lives of those who may risk their life to oppose Saddam. 
And we must not imply commitments before we are clear about their 
risks and costs and likely benefits. Sandy Berger.
