The state of Michigan says it will try to enforce a cease-and-desist 
order against retired pathologist Jack Kevorkian for his role in the 
televised assisted suicide death of a man. Kevorkian has already been 
charged with first-degree murder. Kevorkian's license was suspended 
in 1991 and last year the state issued a Cease-and-desist order, which 
prohibits him from practicing medicine without a license. If a judge 
agrees he violated the order, he could face 30 days in jail and a 
$250 fine.
