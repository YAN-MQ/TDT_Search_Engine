Sudan's lawmakers on Wednesday re-nominated the country's most influential 
politician as Parliament speaker, two days after he had resigned to 
work full time for the ruling party. Members in the 400-seat National 
Assembly unanimously supported Hassan Turabi by a voice vote, backing 
his nomination by calls of ``Allahu Akbar'' or ``God is great.'' Turabi 
did not attend the house. If he accepts the nomination as expected, 
he will hold the post until the end of the Parliament's term in April 
2000. Turabi had submitted his resignation to the house on Monday, 
saying he wanted to devote all his time to the ruling National Congress 
Party at a time when Sudan is making tentative moves toward a multi-party 
system from Jan. 1. Turabi's re-nomination took place without any 
hitch. Deputy Speaker Alison Manani Magaya opened the session by asking 
for nominations to fill the speaker's post. Another deputy speaker, 
Abdul-Aziz Shidou, proposed Turabi's name. No other name was proposed 
and the proceedings were called to an end. Magaya, the deputy speaker, 
then told the legislators: ``Dr. Turabi could resume his post anytime 
he wants.'' On Tuesday, Sudan's Vice President Ali Osman Mohammed 
Taha had called on legislators to respect Turabi's wish to resign. 
Taha said his call was endorsed by President Omar el-Bashir. Under 
a new law el-Bashir's government will on Jan. 1 legalize political 
groups that may contest elections. El-Bashir had banned all political 
parties after seizing power in a 1989 military coup. He, however, 
said recently that the door was open for opposition figures in exile 
to come back and form political associations. But the presence of 
the hard-line Turabi at the head of Parliament had cast doubts on 
the seriousness of the government's willingness to allow the opposition 
to flourish. Political analysts interpreted Turabi's resignation as 
a government attempt to ease those fears. There was no immediate reaction 
from the opposition on his re-nomination. There were also some apprehension 
about the law, which only speaks of ``political associations.'' Turabi 
was strongly opposed to some Parliament members' demand for a clear-cut 
reference to ``political parties.''
