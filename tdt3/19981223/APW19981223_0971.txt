Eidan Tal and Yossi Abuksis scored second-half goals and Israel shocked 
European power Yugoslavia 2-0 in an international friendly on Wednesday. 
Yugoslavia was without seven regulars and Israeli coach Shlomo Sherf 
used the opportunity to experiment with several youngsters. The Israelis 
overcame a scare when Darko Kovacevic had an apparent goal disallowed 
by a controversial offside call in the 38th minute and finally took 
the lead when Tal, one of the youngster, scored off Najwan Ghrayib's 
cross in the 57th minute. Kovacevic was ejected for elbowing defender 
Amir Shelah midway through the final half and Israel capitalized. 
The hosts secured their victory in the 82nd minute when Haim Revivo 
lifted the ball over the onrushing Yugoslavian defense to Abuksis, 
who calmly chipped the ball over Yugoslavian keeper Ivica Kralj. After 
a first half in which neither team settled into a cohesive pattern, 
the Israelis gradually took control following Kovacevic's dismissal. 
``I'm satisfied with how we played,'' Sherf said. ``Games like this 
build a team's character.''
