The Supreme Court on Wednesday threw out an earlier ruling that ordered 
a newspaper to pay a large sum in moral damages to the country's interior 
minister. The Supreme Court ordered the Starokievsky district court 
in Kiev to reconsider the minister's lawsuit against the daily Kievskie 
Vedomosti, the independent UNIAN news agency said. The Supreme Court 
said the judge in the earlier case made several unspecified violations 
during the hearing. It was not clear when the new hearing would start. 
Interior Minister Yuriy Kravchenko sued the newspaper following the 
publication of articles last year that alleged he had bought an expensive 
car out of public funds set up to help families of policemen killed 
in the line of duty. The Starokievsky court ruled that the publication 
stained Kravchenko's dignity and honor, and ordered Vedomosti to pay 
him 5 million hryvna (dlrs 2.5 million at the time) for the damage. 
It also ordered two journalists who wrote the articles to pay the 
minister 20,000 hryvna (dlrs 10,000) and 7,000 hryvna (dlrs 3,500), 
respectively. Wednesday's ruling was the latest in a series of cases 
involving Ukraine's opposition media, which has lost in most instances. 
Two opposition papers, Vseukrainskie Vedomosti and Politika, have 
closed down this year. The former lost a libel suit to a businessman 
and politician, and the latter had its registration revoked after 
a court ruled it had revealed unspecified state secrets. Opposition 
newspapers in Ukraine have often alleged harassment by authorities. 
But government officials say the fault lies with the newspapers and 
accuses them of publishing libelous materials.
