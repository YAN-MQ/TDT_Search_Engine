In south Korea today, a story of mayhem at the monastery, or temple 
really. It involves two factions of Buddhist monks. One faction of 
monks in November took over an ancient Buddhist spiritual home and 
refused to leave. Today, riot police, armed with a court order, stormed 
the building and ordered the occupying faction to leave. They wouldn't. 
They resisted the police water Cannon. One monk actually stabbed himself. 
Another immersed himself in gasoline. The monks tried to set the building 
on fire. Police hurled in tear gas, then followed that by engaging 
the monks in hand-to-hand combat. Power and money are at stake here. 
The winning faction will control 1,700 monks, $10 million and a temple 
that is 1,000 years old. 100 monks were arrested today. Perhaps a 
bit more meditation is in order.
