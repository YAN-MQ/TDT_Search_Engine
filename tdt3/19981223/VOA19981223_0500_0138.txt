Lebanese guerrillas have fired salvos of Cutta Usa rockets into Northern 
Israel, injuring at least 10 civilians and causing heavy property 
damage. The pro-Iranian, Hizbollah, group claim responsibility for 
today's attacks. The attacks were an apparent retaliation for Tuesday's 
Israeli air strikes against suspected Hizbollah guerrilla targets 
in Lebanon.
