Denis Dutton spotted a window of opportunity on the World Wide Web, 
but instead of opening a portal for the masses, he installed a porthole 
for intellectuals. Dutton is the publisher of Arts &AMP; Letters Daily 
(www.cybereditions.com/aldaily), a Web site intended to serve as an 
online starting point for cerebral browsers. Launched in October, 
the site is really just a single, regularly updated page with links 
to about 75 carefully chosen articles, essays and book reviews residing 
elsewhere on the Internet. Current selections, culled from the online 
editions of academic journals, foreign magazines and dozens of other 
publications, include a British critic's witty dismissal of the best-selling 
novel ``The God of Small Things'' and political commentary by the 
author Salman Rushdie. ``There is emphatically not that much good 
writing available for free on the Web,'' Dutton said. ``But what little 
is there can be a source of pleasure for readers who like the arts, 
ideas and debate.'' Dutton, a philosophy professor at the University 
of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, asserted that Arts &AMP; 
Letters Daily is a ``portal,'' a hot concept in Web commerce these 
days. The term describes sites like Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) and Walt 
Disney Co.'s new Go Network (go.com) that strive to provide well-organized 
access to the Web's jumble of information. They do so with a collection 
of features like search engines and customized content like local 
sports scores. To that end, Dutton, 54, and his three-person staff 
have equipped Arts &AMP; Letters Daily with links to news sites, online 
reference works and educationally inclined Web guides like Encyclopaedia 
Britannica Inc.'s eBLAST (www.eblast.com). Arts &AMP; Letters Daily, 
Dutton argued, ``is fundamentally a portal site. It is a place for 
the literate Web surfer to begin the day. Disney can have its teenagers. 
We are targeting educated adults, the people who make a difference 
to the intellectual, economic and political life of the world.'' But 
Arts &AMP; Letters Daily and SciTech Daily Review (www.scitechdaily.com), 
a newly launched companion site concentrating on science and technology, 
function more like portholes than portals. Although the sites offer 
views of the same expansive sea of online information that the portals 
do, they do it through narrower windows. Jim Hake, founder and chairman 
of GII in Santa Monica, Calif., which bestows the annual Global Information 
Infrastructure Awards to Web sites it deems noteworthy, believes the 
emergence of portholes will be one of the major Internet trends of 
1999. ``As people become more savvy users of the Net,'' Hake said, 
``they want things which are better focused on meeting their specific 
needs. We're going to see a whole lot more of this, and it's going 
to potentially erode the user base of some of the big portals.'' At 
eBLAST, which bills itself as ``the thinking person's guide to the 
Web,'' 25 editors and 200 contributors categorize and rate more than 
1,000 diverse sites each week. The online resource, a free supplement 
to a subscription-only version of the encyclopaedia (www.eb.com), 
already contains about 160,000 sites. ``We're putting our seal of 
approval on other people's Web sites,'' said Paul Hoffman, eBLAST's 
42-year-old publisher, In late October, the Chicago firm redesigned 
the then 4-month-old site to make it faster and, despite its smarty-pants 
slant, more generic in appearance. Noting that both the populist Zagat's 
guide and the more refined Michelin directory list their restaurants 
in alphabetical order, Hoffman said, ``People are used to looking 
a certain way at information on the Web now. If you depart too extremely 
from that, it takes your users too long to find what they want.'' 
Dutton, a U.S. native who has lived in New Zealand since 1984, is 
certain there is a sizable audience for brainy online content.``Some 
people might reject Arts &AMP; Letters Daily as a niche interest,'' 
he said, ``but there are a few million Americans who are genuinely 
interested in the life of the mind.'' And even if the market turns 
out to be limited, there are limits to how wide Dutton is willing 
to expand his porthole. ``We will never have horoscopes,'' he said 
flatly. ``If people want horoscopes, they will have to go elsewhere.''
