Up next -- why Christmas trees have gotten so expensive this year. 
Some surprising trade secrets. And still ahead -- the two brothers 
whose spirit lasts all year long. Like a fire in my chest. A terrible 
taste in my throat. If heartburn has you by the throat, you may have 
the toughest heartburn... for this, doctors recommend gaviscon. Only 
regular gaviscon forms a soothing, protective barrier to help keep 
stomach acid down, where it belongs. Mylanta can't. Pepcid ac can't. 
Only gaviscon can. Better. Relief. Sleep. One word convinced me... 
an herbal could help me maintain emotional balance. Centrum. One name 
means... an advance in herbals to help maintain memory. This winter, 
I'm taking the only herbal... backed by centrum science. Introducing 
centrum herbals. Some other brands can be missing natural ingredients... 
because herbals can vary from plant to plant, dose to dose. Only centrum 
uses Pharmaprint... to guarantee a more complete herbal every time. 
One word can help make a difference in your health. Six individual 
centrum herbals. Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. The more I wipe, the worse 
this tissue feels. No regular tissue sooths better than puffs plus-- 
not even the other national brand. It's the most soothing puffs ever. 
An incredibly soft tissue with lotion, with aloe and vitamin E. wow, 
that's magic. Can you feel the lotion? Maybe next time your nose won't 
get so red. - That would be magic. - Puffs plus.
