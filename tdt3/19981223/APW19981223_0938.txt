Russia's Communist leader, effectively endorsing the anti-Semitic 
rhetoric of his allies, accused Jews on Wednesday of bringing on the 
``extinction'' of Russia's people and the country's economic woes, 
according to a news agency report. Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov 
_ a prominent politician who finished second in the 1996 presidential 
election _ also suggested that Russia's Jewish community condemn Zionism, 
the Interfax news agency reported. Zionism, a movement supporting 
the Jewish state of Israel, is often used by Russian anti-Semites 
to refer to a perceived Jewish conspiracy against other ethnic and 
religious groups. ``Our people are not blind. They cannot fail to 
see that the spread of Zionism in the state government in Russia is 
one of the reasons for the current catastrophic condition of the country, 
the mass impoverishment and the process of extinction of its people,'' 
Zyuganov said in what Interfax described as an open letter. The letter 
to President Boris Yeltsin's chief of staff and national security 
chief Nikolai Bordyuzha and Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov 
was Zyuganov's most blatant public expression of anti-Semitism. No 
one was available in either of the addressees' offices or the Communist 
Party on Wednesday evening to comment on the letter or to provide 
a copy. In the past, Zyuganov has mostly confined himself to tacit 
support for his overtly anti-Semitic allies. Zyuganov's letter came 
in response to demands by Russian liberals and international Jewish 
organizations that the Communist Party, the largest party in Russia, 
censure virulent anti-Semitic remarks by two of its members. Under 
Zyuganov, the party has taken on an increasingly aggressive, nationalistic 
tone. Anti-Semitic rhetoric has grown with the nation's economic troubles 
_ the traditional spark for scapegoating. Several prominent Russian 
businessmen and politicians have called for banning the party, saying 
it had evolved into a fascist grouping. In his letter, Zyuganov outlined 
the ``aggressive, destructive role of Zionist capital in the collapse 
of Russia's economy and the pilfering of its national wealth,'' Interfax 
reported. ``The root of all our evils is the criminal policy of the 
anti-national, non-national oligarchy,'' Zyuganov wrote. At the same 
time, Zyuganov insisted that he condemned anti-Semitism and was only 
calling for fighting an alleged Jewish conspiracy for world domination. 
The Soviet Communist Party had also said it was against anti-Semitism 
_ at the same time suppressing Jewish culture and imposing quotas 
on Jews in universities and high-paying or government jobs. Virulent 
anti-Semitic statements by Russia's Communists have been reaching 
increasingly higher levels of the party in recent months, culminating 
Wednesday with Zyuganov's letter. In speeches this fall, Communist 
lawmaker Albert Makashov, a retired general, blamed the country's 
problems on ``zhidy,'' or ``yids,'' a derogatory term for Jews. Communists 
in parliament blocked a resolution condemning him. This month, prominent 
Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' 
on Russians. He also said that Russia's post-Soviet collapse would 
not have occurred if Russia's government was not made up ``exclusively 
of one group, the Jews.'' President Boris Yeltsin's governments have 
contained a number of Jews and other minorities in prominent positions, 
but they have always been outnumbered by ethnic Russians. Russia has 
a history of discriminating against Jews, dating to czarist times. 
The discrimination, based more on ethnicity than religion, prompted 
waves of Russian Jews to emigrate. Since the Soviet-era restrictions 
were lifted, grassroots anti-Semitism has remained widespread. It 
has been spilling out since Russia plunged into its latest economic 
troubles.
