The murder trial of a prominent lawyer in Delaware has taken another 
bizarre twist. Deborah feyerick has the latest. Thomas capano said 
he wanted to protect himself and his longtime mistress. So he made, 
in his words, a cowardly decision. The once-powerful Wilmington attorney, 
accused of killing another former girlfriend, testified he decided 
to hide the body, get rid of the murder weapon and wipe away the evidence 
in his home. The trial has recessed until next week. But Tuesday, 
capano maintained he did not kill Anne Marie Fahey in a Jealous rage 
2 1/2 years ago, as prosecutors allege. Instead, he continued to accuse 
his former mistress, debby MacIntyre, claiming she shot Fahey accidentally, 
then helped capano clean up and rearrange the furniture in his home. 
MacIntyre testified earlier that she bought a gun at capano's request. 
But she denied any involvement in the killing. I feel there is a great 
deal of anger that she has, because of what he said about her in the 
courtroom. But at this point in time, it's just another day, another 
story. Addressing the jury he testified that he went into automatic 
pilot, stuffing the body in a cooler. He then carried to it the garage 
he said with her help because it was, quote, not something he could 
have done myself. While maintaining his innocence, capano said he 
blamed himself for lying to macIntyre and sparking the events, he 
said, which led to Fahey's death. With the help of his younger brother, 
Gerry, capano said he tossed the body and the gun into the summer 
waves of the atlantic. Neither have been found. Capano testified he 
never told this story before because, he said, he thought MacIntyre 
would protect him, as he was protecting her. And he said he felt it 
better to talk directly to a jury. Deborah feyerick, for CNN, Wilmington, 
Delaware.
