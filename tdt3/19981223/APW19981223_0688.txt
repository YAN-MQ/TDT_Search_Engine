Guerrillas in south Lebanon fired a hail of rockets at northern Israel 
early Wednesday, causing heavy property damage and injuring at least 
13 people. Israel swore to react. Although the cross-border attack 
with Katyusha rockets was the heaviest in nearly three years, most 
people in Israel's north had spent the night in shelters, expecting 
retaliation for an Israeli air strike in Lebanon the day before that 
killed seven civilians. In the border town of Kiryat Shemona _ so 
often hit by rocket attacks that some Israelis call it ``Kiryat Katyusha'' 
_ one rocket smashed into a bank, wrecking its cash machines. Broken 
glass littered the streets. A tree was uprooted by a direct hit, and 
the electricity was knocked out in some areas but later restored. 
Another rocket bore a hole in an apartment building, scattering sheets 
of plaster and hunks of twisted metal on the ground below. Tens of 
thousands of people in northern Israel were told to stay in shelters 
all day. Israel's army said its forces returned artillery fire, but 
gave no other details about the military response. Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu called a special meeting of his security Cabinet 
to discuss the attack, then flew by helicopter to the area that had 
come under attack. ``We can't let this pass quietly,'' Netanyahu told 
reporters in Kiryat Shemona. ``We will react according to our considerations, 
when we want. And we will react.''
