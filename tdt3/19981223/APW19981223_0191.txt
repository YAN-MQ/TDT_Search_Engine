Russia on Wednesday delivered a plane load of medicine to Tajikistan, 
and the supplies were also to be distributed in war-torn Afghanistan, 
a news report said. Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations delivered 
the 16 tons of medicine to Tajikistan's capital Dushanbe, the ITAR-Tass 
news agency reported. Seven tons will be distributed in remote regions 
of Tajikistan, a country still recovering from a 5-year civil war 
that formally ended last year. The remaining nine tons will be sent 
on to neighboring Afghanistan, a land devastated by two decades of 
war. The report did not say whether the aid would go to the ruling 
Taliban movement in Afghanistan, which Russia opposes, or to areas 
controlled by the opposition in northern Afghanistan.
