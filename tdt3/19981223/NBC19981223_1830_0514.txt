A new government rule goes into effect tonight. To deal with an environmental 
hazard that most of us never even think about because we can't see 
I. underground tanks that hold gasoline. If they're old or leaking, 
they have to be replaced. As of today, NBC's Kelly O'Donnell has more 
on the problem tonight and a Very costly solution. Beginning today, 
an estimated 20,000 gas stations nationwide face fines of up to $11,000 
a day. Their underground fuel tanks don't meet the government's new 
safety standards. Unable to afford the new tanks, many "mom and pop" 
family businesses are closing. It's really sad. Who wants to have 
to drive 20 miles to get a tank of gas. Today's new rules should help 
stop dangerous underground gas leaks that can poison drinking water. 
The federal government gave station owners ten years to make the change. 
I was very sad when we had to shut it down. In Oregon, Jim winningham 
and Fred Morgan closed after 25 years. They don't have the $150,000 
needed to upgrade their tanks. We're not the only small outfit that's 
going out of business. There's a bunch of us little guys that are 
a thing of the past. In 1998, 2 million gas stations nationwide. By 
year's end, just 600,000 still in service. Michael kortenhof oversees 
Oregon's gas tank replacement program. All you can say is that it's 
an unfortunate outcome of a necessary environmental protection. Necessary, 
because experts say more than two-thirds the old tanks already dug 
up had leaks, and so the dangers aren't just a possibility. The worst 
has already happened. Last year in Wisconsin, one man died when this 
house blew apart after fumes from leaking underground gas tanks ignited. 
Contractor Don Reid predicts everyone will be hit at the pump. The 
oil companies have to recoup this somehow, and it's all going to be 
reflected in the price of gas. Drivers may pay still another way, 
spending more time when the gauge nears empty in search of a gas station 
that could be harder to find. Kelly O'Donnell, NBC news, Los Angeles.
