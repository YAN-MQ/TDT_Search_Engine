Ten hours, 30, universal time. This is VOA News Now. U.S. Defense 
Secretary announces that some warplanes, and troops, are being pulled 
out of the Persian Gulf. Lebanese guerrillas fire rockets into Northern 
Israel. At least eight civilians are injured. We examine the most 
urgent question in Washington, today: Will the U.S. Senate hold the 
trial for President Clinton. Those stories and much more in this half-hour 
of VOA News Now. Hello, again, from Washington. I'm Charlene Porter, 
along with Paul Westfeeling.
