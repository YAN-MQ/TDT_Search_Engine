Books on health are very popular, in the United States. The list of 
best-selling non-fiction books typically includes titles on alternative 
medicine, diets, cancer prevention, heart disease, and since Viagra 
hit the market in March, impotence. How can you tell which ones are 
likely to be good for your health? Dr. John Renner, the president 
of the nonprofit, National Council for Reliable Health Information, 
urges caution. He says he is suspicious about medical books written 
by businessmen, rather than creditable scientists or physicians. I 
think you've got to look and see what the claims are, whether they're 
trying to sell you something additional, whether its magnets. Or whether 
they're trying to get you to buy foods laced with Chlorophyll, which 
has not a really good scientific background for humans. It's important 
for plants. Dr. Renner advises a skeptical approach to health books 
that aren't written by doctors or scientists.
