Turning now to the weather, the bitter cold that has gripped the midwest 
extended farther south today. Deep in Texas, the temperatures struggled 
to reach 20. Add moisture to the cold an you have a real mess for 
all the preholiday traveling. Here's ABC's Morton dean. They look 
like highways from hel. Interstate 81 better New York, an ice slick, 
a Good evening. Chain reaction, 40 cars. Interstate 35, Austin, Texas, 
two huge pileups, 58 vehicles. Two deaths. There were other nasty 
winter surprises in Texas today. It snows in Texarkana once every 
five years. This is the year. This is the kind of weather that produced 
an album of winter sounds. Jackson, Mississippi, chain saws slicing 
through downed trees. Nashville, Tennessee, cars creeping and crunching 
along slippery roads. If the sounds of winter, the winter music are 
familiar, so are the words. Chicago. It's just freezing. New York 
City -- Are you cold? yes. But there were some people in high places 
today who did not complain about the weather. Skiers. More snow on 
some snow starved mountains. Morton dean, ABC News, New York.
