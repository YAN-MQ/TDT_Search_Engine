Are you facing surgery in the near future? What you eat beforehand 
can help determine how quickly you recover. A report to a recent meeting 
of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, suggested that eating 
potatoes could theoretically lengthen the time anesthetic drugs remain 
in your body. Other pre-operative advise, is to tell your doctor of 
any allergies you have, since some anesthetic drugs trigger reactions, 
especially in patients who are allergic to soy and eggs. And, the 
president of the anesthesiologists' group, Dr. William Owen, stresses 
the importance of telling your doctor about all the medications you're 
taking, even over-the-counter ones, such as aspirin. Dr. Owen says 
so many people take aspirin routinely, to prevent a heart attack, 
that they don't even think about mentioning it to their doctor. But, 
he warns, a single aspirin can prolong bleeding time, significantly.
