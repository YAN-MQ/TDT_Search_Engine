China warns they won't be letting up on the current drive against 
political dissent. Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin made the warning 
amid international criticism of dissident trials. Carrie Gracey reports 
from Beijing. In a speech peppered with references to hostile forces 
abroad and dissatisfaction among laid-off workers at home, China's 
Communist Party chief warned that the 50th anniversary of Communist 
Party rule and the return of the Portuguese colony of Macao would 
make 1999 a vital year for China and that preserving stability was 
paramount. But the imprisonment of Chinese citizens for the crime 
of trying to organize their own political party makes it clear that 
Beijing's definition of the freedoms of expression and association 
is very much narrower than that of London or Washington. Carrie Gracey, 
BBC, Beijing.
