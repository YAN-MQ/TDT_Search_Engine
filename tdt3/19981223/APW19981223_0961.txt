Concerned with the fast-deteriorating situation in Kosovo, two top 
NATO officials warned both sides in the conflict Wednesday against 
launching more attacks. NATO's top commander for Europe, American 
Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of ``increasingly aggressive Serb military 
and police activities.'' Speaking to reporters in neighboring Macedonia, 
he said the alliance is watching closely to ensure Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic keeps his promises under an October agreement aimed 
at halting bloodshed in the secessionist Serbian province. Echoing 
the security concerns, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said in 
Brussels that the escalating violence and killings in recent days 
``pose a grave risk to the cease-fire.'' ``We remain fully vigilant 
and ready to act,'' he said. The officials' comments came as reports 
said one man was killed and three others wounded in the latest two 
shootouts in Kosovo _ in the northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica and 
in a suburb of the capital Pristina late Tuesday. The Serb-run Media 
Center said an unidentified gunman burst into an Albanian-owned bar 
in Kosovska Mitrovica wounded two ethnic Albanians, one of whom died 
Wednesday. The survivor is known for his loyalty to Serbian authorities. 
Police sealed off the district where the bar is located and were pursuing 
the perpetrator, the report said. Two Serbian police officers were 
also reported wounded when ``terrorists'' opened fire with machine-guns 
in a Pristina suburb, the Serb center said. The continuing spiral 
of violence threatens to revive the all-out war that raged between 
secessionist ethnic Albanians and Serb security forces from February 
to October. During that time some 1,000 people lost their lives and 
another 300,000 lost their homes. Clark said the stepped-up police 
activities were not in conformance with Milosevic's pledges in an 
Oct. 12 agreement. He reiterated that Milosevic and top military commanders 
in Belgrade have been told they ``must comply with their promises 
made to NATO.'' NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe spoke on 
a visit to the alliance's 1,800-strong extraction force, deployed 
in Macedonia in case the unarmed international verifiers in Kosovo 
are threatened. International officials also have criticized Kosovo 
Albanian rebels for endangering the cease-fire by carrying out provocative 
missions. Solana warned both sides ``not to try to use the Christmas 
and New Year period to launch attacks or to conduct operations which 
would undermine the fragile security situation in Kosovo and further 
jeopardize the prospects for a peaceful solution.'' But in a sign 
of continuing defiance, the main board of Milosevic's Socialist Party 
met Wednesday and said it supports Serbian forces' continuing efforts 
and ``destruction of the terrorist gangs.'' In a separate development, 
the U.S.-based Physicians for Human Rights sent a letter to Milosevic 
objecting to what it called ``systematic and pervasive abuses'' by 
Serbs against Kosovo Albanian physicians, other health workers and 
patients, continuing since the October cease-fire. The group released 
preliminary findings of a two-month study documenting what it said 
was a pattern of Serbian intimidation of Albanian doctors, ``marked 
by instances of murder, torture, detention, imprisonment and forced 
disappearances.'' Kosovo Albanian medical facilities have been searched, 
property confiscated and many clinics and health centers burned to 
the ground, and patients have been beaten, the report said. ``Attacks 
on health facilities, doctors and their patients are war crimes,'' 
said Dr. Jennifer Leaning, one of the lead researchers and a member 
of the group's board of directors. She said the campaign by Serbian 
police and health professionals ``disregards norms of medical neutrality 
that are protected under international human rights and humanitarian 
law.'' There was no immediate response from Serbian authorities. Also
