Those three balloonists, who are hoping to be the first to circle 
the globe in a hot-air balloon, are leaving Chinese air space and 
entering the most dangerous space of their journey. They're crossing 
the Pacific Ocean. Lori Castman brings us up to date. The American 
spokeswoman for the balloon team, Lori Levin, says the three pilots 
are carefully checking out all systems on board as they head off to 
cross over about 3,000 kilometers of ocean. The biggest danger over 
the Pacific is if they would hit a thunderstorm, or if the would have 
to actually land in the water. If they had to come down in the water, 
it would be very difficult to rescue them. Right now the balloon is 
averaging about 30 kilometers an hour, but will probably travel at 
four times that speed across the Pacific. Ms. Levin says it should 
take a bit more than two days to cross the Pacific, which would bring 
them over the United States on Christmas day. The balloonists almost 
had to end their quest when they entered Chinese air space, and authorities 
there insisted they land. But, intense diplomatic efforts brought 
a change of heart, and the mission remains on course. There were some 
fears earlier in the day, that if the balloon did not correct it's 
course, it would end up drifting over North Korea. MS. Levin says 
that would have spelled disaster. If we had gone over North Korea, 
we would immediately have had to come down. The balloonists, led by 
British tycoon Richard Branson, left Morocco last Friday. They had 
to change direction, a bit, to avoid the U.S. and British air strikes 
over Iraq. Then, the politics are flying over China nearly brought 
them down again. Ms. Levin said the pilots are glad to have the political 
problems behind them, so they can concentrate on their goal, to be 
the first to circle the globe in a hot-air balloon. Lori Castman,
