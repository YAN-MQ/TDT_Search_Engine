Washington is telling three Cuban diplomats at the United Nations 
to leave the country for alleged espionage. The expulsions follow 
an FBI investigation. They have until Monday to leave. Two other Cuban 
envoys at the UN returned to Cuba several weeks ago. Last September, 
the FBI arrested 10 people in Florida, accusing them to spying on 
U.S. military bases and Cuban exile groups. With the time at four 
minutes past the hour, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in 
London. You're listening to The World.
