Two of the nation's leading banking companies, Chase Manhattan and 
J.P. Morgan, were accused in a lawsuit filed Wednesday of wrongfully 
seizing bank accounts and safe-deposit assets of Jewish customers 
during the German occupation of France in World War II and then failing 
to return them after the war. The suit was filed in U.S. District 
Court in Brooklyn on behalf of Jewish citizens of France, Israel and 
other nations who survived the Nazi occupation or are relatives of 
victims. A lawyer for the plaintiffs said he believed it was the first 
class-action suit charging American banks with having wrongfully seized 
and kept the assets of Holocaust victims. Seven French banks were 
also named as defendants. The lawyer, Kenneth McCallion, said the 
suit had been brought under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which permits 
foreigners to bring suits in American courts charging violations of 
international law. McCallion said he and other lawyers in the case 
were looking into the possibility of adding Chase and Morgan as defendants 
in a suit, previously filed in the same court against the French banks, 
in which the plaintiffs include Jews who are citizens of the United 
States and who survived the Nazi years in France. American citizens 
who are relatives of French Jewish victims are also plaintiffs in 
this suit. A spokesman for Morgan, Michael Golden, said, ``We understand 
the seriousness of this issue and will certainly look into these allegations 
with care.'' Chase Manhattan called it an ``unnecessary lawsuit,'' 
saying it had been in discussions with the World Jewish Congress for 
several weeks in an effort to ``establish a process for facilitating 
payment to former customers of the Chase Bank of Paris or their heirs 
whose accounts were frozen and subsequently seized by the Vichy French 
or Nazis.'' The bank said it was ``recently made aware of questions 
of propriety'' concerning its actions in World War II, and that it 
had begun ``a vigorous examination of the historical records'' and 
started consulting with Jewish organizations and experts to identify 
former customers or their heirs. ``Chase immediately said it would 
pay these customers or heirs with interest,'' the bank said. The suit 
was the latest in a series in the last two years that have leveled 
similar charges against banks of other nations. In August, Credit 
Suisse and UBS settled, agreeing to pay $1.25 billion in restitution. 
Because seven French banks were named as defendants, along with Chase 
Manhattan and Morgan, the plaintiff class potentially numbers ``tens 
of thousands of people,'' McCallion said. Most of them live in France, 
Israel, Canada and Australia. But the great bulk of those affected 
have claims against the French banks, he said.
