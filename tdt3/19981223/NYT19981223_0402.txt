Of the two beautiful women, one was married to a cad, the other to 
a fool, and when these husbands proved neglectful, the wives themselves 
fell into bed, their fingers touching each other's skin as if feeling 
an intricate brocade. This scene from ``Fire'' is the first time an 
Indian film has explicitly shown homosexual relations, an event both 
repellent and opportune to a waning fringe Hindu movement known as 
Shiv Sena. Its offended minions have attacked theaters, shutting down 
the movie in Bombay, New Delhi and other big cities. ``I have become 
the victim of an Indian gestapo,'' lamented Deepa Mehta, 43, the film's 
director. ``This is so very ridiculous _ and also so scary. I don't 
even think it's the lesbianism that threatens them. It's that the 
movie says women have choices, and that is frightening to a male-dominated 
society.'' Ms. Mehta, who divides her time between Toronto and New 
Delhi, was seated in a front room of her parents' home here as three 
severe-looking men with automatic weapons held vigil outside. These 
bodyguards were ordered by the Supreme Court. Already shown in several 
countries, ``Fire'' is a two-year-old, award-winning film that has 
struck some critics as sensitive and acute and others as a soap-operatic 
bore. The government's Censor Board approved the movie without cuts 
in May, and it had been playing to good crowds for two weeks before 
Shiv Sena discovered the nature of its romantic heart. ``Is it fair 
to show such things which are not part of Indian culture?'' Balasaheb 
K. Thackeray, Shiv Sena's leader, asked in a magazine interview. ``It 
can corrupt tender minds. It is a sort of a social AIDS.'' Using a 
politically correct mix of men and women and alerting the news media 
beforehand, so-called Shiv Sainiks rampaged through a matinee show 
in Bombay on Dec. 2, smashing glass and burning posters. The next 
day, theaters in New Delhi, Pune and Surat were similarly hit. Then 
came a theater in Calcutta, though the audience there fought off the 
marauders and the movie remained open. With these highly publicized 
incidents, the nation's elite began taking sides. The venerable film 
star Dilip Kumar spoke in favor of artistic freedom only to find near-nude 
Shiv Sainiks circling his home. If Kumar favored such cinematic immodesty, 
they reasoned, he should be treated to a continuing procession of 
men in underpants. For India's Hindu nationalist leadership _ troubled 
by heaps of dirty linen among the strange bedfellows in its coalition 
government _ its Shiv Sena allies have become an embarrassment. Thackeray's 
party controls the populous state of Maharashtra, but his support 
is accompanied by his tongue, an instrument that has praised Hitler 
while denouncing Christians, Muslims and Sikhs. This year, a report 
of a judicial inquiry named him a provocateur of frenzied Hindu mobs 
that in 1992 burned Muslim homes and businesses and killed 1,200 in 
Bombay. Recent parliamentary elections have shown a drop in the Shiv 
Sena's appeal to disaffected Hindu slum-dwellers. Thackeray seems 
to be grasping for issues. Just before attacking ``Fire,'' he tried 
to have the Pakistani cricket team banned in India, a notion rebuked 
by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. The prime minister also has 
condemned the movie theater violence, though it is the Supreme Court 
that has commanded protection for Ms. Mehta and the film's exhibition. 
Theater owners so far are unwilling to reopen the film. The national 
Censor Board has decided to review its approval of ``Fire.'' Controversy 
is nothing new to Indian censor boards, especially given the prodigious 
film industry's simultaneous instincts for prudishness and lust. In 
the 1970's, kissing on the lips was being debated while the very same 
movies reliably featured orgiastic dances by scantily clad women. 
Today, bedroom embraces remain as timid as Rock Hudson and Doris Day, 
though virtually every film has singing sweethearts who do so much 
pelvic thrusting that a love scene appears more like an exercise video. 
``Erotic movement: this is the devil's food of Hindu cinema,'' said 
Vishnu Khare, a film critic. ``Everyone may remain fully clothed, 
but there is a lot of sexual posturing and rubbing together of bodies. 
It is a supreme form of voyeurism.'' Violence, including rape, is 
also customary in the films. ``The victim is either the hero's sister 
or the hero's brother's wife,'' Khare said. ``It can't be the heroine 
because by becoming a rape victim a woman becomes untouchable. As 
soon as I see a hero's sister-in-law, I know she is there to be raped 
and then killed.'' Foreign films are held to a different standard. 
In New Delhi, some two dozen theaters show ``morning movies,'' a popular 
pre-noon display of soft pornography from other countries. ``If it's 
a white female torso, nobody minds it,'' Khare said. ``It merely proves 
to Indians how fallen and decadent white people are.'' Still, with 
American films beamed nightly on television, many Indians fear that 
their bedrooms are being colonized and their sexual conventions transformed. 
To some, this sexual timorousness may seem odd. After all, this is 
the land of the Kama Sutra and ancient triple X-rated temple carvings. 
Acceptance of homosexuality remains uncommon here, and this was especially 
so at the Shiv Sena headquarters in northern New Delhi. Inside a tiny 
office sat the group's local chief, Jai Bhagwan Goyal, 43, a small-factory 
owner. ``Even if we assume lesbianism does happen, what is the point 
of showing it to people?'' he asked in exasperation. ``Everyone knows 
what goes on between a husband and wife, but they do not do it in 
the middle of a road.'' To further make his point, Goyal made a few 
phone calls and brought together 10 women from the group. Dressed 
in saris and shawls, these housewives were pained to discuss a world 
where homosexuality even existed, let alone one where it was portrayed 
in a movie. ``This is an insult to Indians everywhere, and we would 
gladly go to jail or even die before we allow such a thing to be shown,'' 
a woman said as the others nodded. Goyal then ushered them out. He 
and his men had something to do that could not involve mixed company. 
He had obtained a bootleg video of ``Fire'' and, for the first time, 
would see the film. The seven men watched it at Goyal's factory so 
as not to defile their homes. They switched it off before it ended, 
in part because their copy was in English instead of one dubbed in 
the more familiar Hindi. Still, they had viewed ``Fire'' long enough 
to see the much-talked-about sex and had reach a shared conclusion. 
``Nothing could ever be more disgusting,'' Goyal said, though this 
simple pronouncement did not seem quite enough. So he repeated himself. 
``Nothing,'' he said. ``Nothing, nothing.''
