Greek and Turkish Cypriots _ and their allies in Greece and Turkey 
_ were divided Wednesday on U.N. Security Council resolutions calling 
for moves to reunite the island. The Greek Cypriot government welcomed 
the resolutions, saying they suggested a new impetus toward its call 
for disarmament and negotiations on the divided island. In Athens, 
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos also greeted the resolutions 
as showing that the world body realized ``the dangers contained in 
a prolongation of the problem.'' But Turkey and Turkish Cypriots were 
critical, saying the Security Council failed to consider Turkish Cypriot 
views or recognize the existence of the breakaway Turkish state on 
the island. A statement from the Turkish Foreign Ministry said suggestions 
in the resolutions were ``not based on agreements that should have 
been reached between the sides concerned.'' The statement said the 
United Nations failed to consider a proposal by Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktash for a confederation between the islands' governments. 
A statement with similar wording was issued by Denktash. In a session 
late Tuesday, the council renewed the mandate of the 2,500-member 
U.N. peacekeeping force which patrols a buffer zone between the Greek 
Cypriot community in the south and the Turkish Cypriots in the north. 
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded after a abortive 
coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot 
state in the north is recognized only by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 
troops there. The council called the status quo ``unacceptable'' and 
said ``negotiations on a final political solution of the Cyprus problem 
have been at an impasse for too long.'' It demanded compliance with 
U.N. resolutions that call for a reduction of troops and weapons and 
the island's reunification. Briefing reporters Wednesday, Greek Cypriot 
Foreign Minister Yiannakis Cassoulides said: ``This is the first time 
in many years that the Security Council demands compliance with its 
previous resolutions on Cyprus, particularly with regard to refraining 
from the threat or the use of force, and on the reduction of troops 
and armaments. ``This gives emphasis to what is important for us,'' 
he added. Cassoulides also welcomed a statement by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton on Tuesday in which he promised ``all necessary steps 
to support a sustained effort'' to implement the council's resolutions. 
In Athens, Pangalos praised Clinton's comments, but he added that 
the United States should ``ask Turkey to immediately withdraw the 
American weapons systems'' in northern Cyprus. Tension has been rising 
recently following Turkish threats to prevent the planned deployment 
by the Greek Cypriots of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. Greece 
said it will support Cyprus if it is attacked in line with their joint 
defense agreement. The resolutions did not mention the missiles, but 
the council expressed ``its grave concern at the continuing excessive 
levels of military force and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and 
the rate at which they are being expanded.''
