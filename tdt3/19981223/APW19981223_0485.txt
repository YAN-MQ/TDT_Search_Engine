The United Nations has extended a peacekeeping mission in the Central 
African Republic until next December to strengthen the country's fragile 
peace, U.N. officials said Wednesday. The U.N. troops will help restructure 
the country's military, which has staged three major rebellions against 
President Ange-Felix Patasse. Since this month's parliamentary elections 
that weakened the ruling party, the military appears more divided 
between loyalists and opponents of Patasse. U.N. officials said the 
rival groups clashed Monday in barracks in the capital of Bangui. 
No casualties were reported. The Security Council authorized the peacekeeping 
mission in March to replace French troops who had been in the country 
to help enforce a peace agreement. Election figures from the second 
round of staggered voting were released Tuesday, indicating the ruling 
Movement for the Liberation of the People of Centrafrique won 47 of 
109 parliamentary seats. A coalition of several opposition parties 
control 29 seats after the two rounds of voting. The remaining seats 
belong to a variety of independent candidates or smaller opposition 
groups, which could play a key role in helping the MLPC or the opposition 
coalition to control the legislative branch of government. The election 
is seen as an important effort to stabilize the Central African Republic, 
which has been wracked by ethnic and factional violence since independence 
more than three decades ago. Patasse's position is not affected by 
the vote and presidential elections are not immediately planned.
