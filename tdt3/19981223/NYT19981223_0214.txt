They call themselves the Ebay 14. While the name may sound like a 
group of political prisoners, they are actually a handful of pet advocates 
who say they got kicked off of www.ebay.com, the online auction service, 
after complaining about the auction of several St. Bernard puppies 
this month. The 14, with canine-style email names like ``stbernard1'', 
``rridgebacks'' and ``rescue'', said they were suspended from the 
service for sending messages protesting the auction of the dogs Dec. 
16. Members of the group oppose such auctions because they think that 
buying a pet through the Internet is ill-advised. ``Complaint: AUCTIONING 
LIVE ANIMALS IS AGAINST EBAY POLICY,'' wrote one of the suspended 
members, Deborah Busby of Hoover, Ala. Another person, also suspended, 
wrote to say: `No responsible dog-breeder would sell like this. No 
responsible person would bid.'' The notes were posted on one of the 
bulletin boards run by ebay.com to allow comment on the sellers offering 
goods through the service. Jennifer Chu, a spokeswoman for ebay.com, 
said her company permits the animal auctions because they are legal. 
Ms. Chu said the members were suspended because they had violated 
the site's policy by posting criticisms of a seller with whom they 
had not done business. In an e-mail to the members informing them 
of their suspension, ebay.com said it was taking the step because 
it believed they had engaged in a practice called ``feedback bombing,'' 
in which an organized effort, often using aliases, is made that lowers 
the level of discourse. Although the writers of the messages said 
no organized effort had been made, it appears that some of them learned 
of the auction through bulletin boards for people interested in animals. 
After issuing the suspensions, ebay.com told the members that they 
could be reinstated if they posted a ``positive'' message on the bulletin 
board to balance out the earlier negative ones. Ms. Busby did so _ 
that is, she checked off the ``positive'' box provided to rate the 
seller, but also wrote that she had had not experience with him _ 
and her service was restored. Nevertheless, she said, ``I am left 
with a very bad taste in my mouth. I don't beleive that I could, in 
good conscience, support Ebay by purchasing anything through their 
site.'' Some animal advocacy groups say they agree that animals should 
not be bought through auction. Bob Slay, an American Kennel Club official, 
said,``Auctions are bad for dogs, because so often the dog goes to 
a home where the new owner has not given sufficient thought to responsible 
ownership,'' Slay said. Ann Church, senior director of government 
affairs for the Humane Society of the United States, was also critical 
of the practice.``It goes against what we tell people to do when selecting 
a new pet,'' she said. ``It's going to be a member of the family, 
and live for 10 to 25 years, depending on the species. It's not something 
to do on a whim.'' Animal advocates fear that pets bought on line 
who don't get along in their new homes will be sent to shelters and 
euthanized. For prospective owners, buying on line can also pose problems, 
say the advocates. They will not be able to tell how well an animal 
is socialized or what health problems it might have. It is also difficult 
to verify a pet's pedigree on line or to return an animal that does 
not work out. The American Kennel Club has decided that as of April 
1999 it will not register dogs sold via auction or raffle _ whether 
on line or otherwise _ unless they have tattoos or microchips as a 
form of permanent identification prior to being sold.
