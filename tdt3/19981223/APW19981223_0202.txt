The prosecution's star witness in the sexual misconduct case against 
dissident Anwar Ibrahim conceded Wednesday there was evidence against 
her allegation Anwar had sex with the wife of a former aide. Ummi 
Hafilda Ali, a 31-year-old advertising executive, alleged in a letter 
to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad last year that Anwar had sex with 
the wife of her brother, his former personal secretary. The letter 
sparked a scandal that led to Mahathir's sacking of Anwar as finance 
minister and deputy prime minister in September. Anwar was subsequently 
arrested and charged with corruption and illegal sex acts. But on 
Wednesday Ummi conceded in court that her brother denied his wife 
had slept with Anwar. Ummi said her brother, Azmin Ali, demanded that 
she change the facts in her original statement to Mahathir. Ummi faced 
Anwar's defense attorneys for a third day Wednesday in the sensational 
trial, which has provoked unprecedented civil unrest in the Southeast 
Asian capital. The government's treatment of Anwar has also sparked 
international criticism of Mahathir's rule. Ummi has been at the center 
of the Anwar scandal since her allegations last year. She also encouraged 
Azizan Abu Bakar, a driver in the Anwar household, to publicly accuse 
the politician of sodomizing him. Two weeks after writing her letter, 
Ummi was arrested and retracted the statement. Ummi claims she was 
coerced by police, but Anwar insists Ummi is part of a high-level 
conspiracy to ruin him and denies the charges against him. Defense 
attorneys have accused Ummi of taking bribes and fabricating tales 
about Anwar's sexual misdeeds because she was furious that he had 
spurned her romantic advances. Ummi said she wrote the letter to protect 
her family honor, but agreed that it had instead torn the family apart. 
``My brother was angry with me for raising those suspicions against 
his wife,'' she said. ``He told you there's no truth in your suspicions, 
right?'' defense attorney Gurbachan Singh asked her. ``Yes,'' she 
replied. Ummi testified Monday that her allegations in the letter 
to Mahathir were true, but that she retracted them because police 
had threatened to send her to jail for two years. Anwar, whose beating 
while in police custody led to an international outcry and close monitoring 
of his trial, is being tried for four counts of corruption. A separate 
trial for another corruption charge and five illegal sex acts charges 
will follow.
