First the states sued the tobacco companies and recovered hundreds 
of billions of dollars in smoking-related Medicaid costs. Now more 
than a dozen cities either have sued the gun industry or are preparing 
to, in a growing campaign to ultimately win in court the handgun controls 
that gun interests have kept them from winning in state legislatures 
and Congress. Although gun manufacturers have defeated suit after 
suit brought by individuals, many mayors express confidence that they 
will prevail, forcing firearms makers to pay huge damages or accept 
new restrictions on the production and marketing of handguns. ``The 
success of the tobacco litigation had a tremendous impact on us,'' 
said Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County. ``Before, people thought 
the tobacco industry was untouchable, and the same with the gun industry. 
Now there is a ray of hope, and it's time to send the bill for gun 
deaths and injuries to the gun makers.'' One city after another is 
joining the list of those taking on the industry, and the number is 
expected to grow to 40 or 50 by next summer. One reason for their 
optimism is that, where juries tended to view criminals or the injured 
parties themselves as responsible for the damages cited in suits brought 
against the industry by individuals, the cities' lawyers believe that 
those juries, as in the tobacco litigation, will be more receptive 
to the argument that a broader society is burdened by the costs resulting 
from use of a dangerous product. The cities are encouraged as well 
by their recognition that the gun industry not only is much smaller 
than the tobacco industry, with far less money to wage courtroom wars, 
but also could be a more vulnerable foe before urban jurors, many 
acutely sensitive to the effects of gun violence. The municipal handgun 
litigating began in late October, when New Orleans became the first 
city to sue the gun industry. New Orleans contended that gun makers 
failed to incorporate enough safety devices in their weapons, a shortcoming 
that the suit said made them ``unreasonably dangerous.'' Chicago followed 
two weeks later, advancing a different argument: Its officials maintained 
that Chicago suburbs, where gun-control laws are more lax than in 
the city, were being flooded with guns by the industry. The resulting 
illicit flow of weapons into the city creates a ``public nuisance,'' 
says Chicago, whose suit demands $433 million to cover police and 
hospital costs attributable to handgun violence since 1994. Bridgeport, 
Conn., and Newark, N.J., plan to file suit before the end of the year, 
officials there say, to be followed in January by Miami and by Gary, 
Ind., and in February by Boston. Leaders in Philadelphia, St. Louis, 
Atlanta, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., and Tampa, Fla., 
plan suits later in the winter or in the spring. New York City has 
not indicated when, or even whether, it will join the list, but many 
others are expected to do so. ``I think it is reasonable to assume 
that unless we have some strong action by the gun industry, there 
will be 40 to 50 lawsuits out there by July 1,'' said Philadelphia 
Mayor Edward G. Rendell, who heads a task force on guns for the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors. ``This is going to be a different day'' for 
the gun makers, he said. Eventually, said Tom Cochran, executive director 
of the Conference of Mayors, more than a hundred cities will sue. 
``There is a lot going on,'' Cochran said. ``The lawyers are seeing 
green on this issue.'' Some of those lawyers were involved in the 
tobacco litigation, he said, and they think ``they can bring the gun 
industry to its knees.'' The suits are especially threatening to the 
industry because it is so much smaller than the cigarette industry, 
with combined sales of handguns, rifles, shotguns and ammunition of 
only $1.4 billion in 1997, compared with sales of $48 billion for 
the tobacco companies. Moreover, sales of all types of firearms have 
been stagnant for almost a decade, slipping to 3.8 million guns in 
1996 from 4.3 million in 1989, according to the federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. In California last year, sales of handguns 
were at their lowest level since 1973. ``They don't have the deep 
pockets the tobacco companies have,'' said Kristen Rand, a senior 
lawyer for the Violence Policy Center, a research and advocacy group 
in Washington. ``The gun industry is in denial. They were shocked 
that the cities filed suit.'' But gun industry executives express 
equal confidence that the cities will fail, just as did suits on behalf 
of individuals. ``They don't have a leg to stand on, as far as the 
law is concerned,'' said Paul Januzzo, vice president and general 
counsel for one gun maker, Glock Inc. ``Cigarettes were supposed to 
be enjoyable, relaxing, and they turned out to be lethal,'' Januzzo 
said. ``But guns are designed to be lethal. That's why people buy 
them,'' he said, dismissing the accusation, as is made in the New 
Orleans suit, that the gun manufacturers are liable for a defective 
product. ``What we have is a bunch of frustrated big-city executives 
who have lost control of the crime problem,'' Januzzo said, ``and 
they are looking to blame someone else.''
