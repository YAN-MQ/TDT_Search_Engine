Israel says it will retaliate for a cross-border rocket barrage by 
Lebanon's Hizbollah guerrillas Wednesday morning. Prime Minister, 
Benjamin Netanyahu, issued the warning during a visit to the border 
region where 16 Israeli civilians were injured. Hizbollah was responding 
to an Israeli air strike, Tuesday, which killed eight Lebanese civilians, 
including a woman and six of her children. Israel apologized for the 
deaths, which it called accidental. Here is government spokesman, 
David Barrilon. This was a mistake on the part of the pilots. We not 
only explain the mistake, but also apologize for it. These things 
happen. The pilots were attacking military targets, in Lebanon, which 
is a part this war, that we certainly don't want, but which continues 
as long as the Hizbollah is attacking us. David Barrilon.
