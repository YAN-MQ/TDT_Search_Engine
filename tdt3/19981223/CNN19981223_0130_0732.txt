National rifle association President Charlton Heston has sent an apology 
to "60 minutes" correspondent Mike Wallace. The CBS news magazine 
ran a profile on Heston Sunday. Before the piece ran, Heston had accused 
"60 minutes of "SWAT-team journalism." In the letter to Wallace, Heston 
says he has been reminded it is wiser to critique a work after seeing 
it.
