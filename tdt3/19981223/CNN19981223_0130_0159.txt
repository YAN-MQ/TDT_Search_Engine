The federal reserve has decided against making any additional changes 
in U.S. interest rates this year. It will keep the overnight bank 
lending rate at 4 3/4%, where it has stood since November 17th. Analysts 
predict the fed will wait until a slowdown occurs. I believe that 
they will ease in the first quarter of 1999, but they do not consider 
it timely right now. I think it is very probable that they might have 
two cuts in the first half of 1999. The fed cut borrowing rates three 
times in the past three months to spur the economy.
