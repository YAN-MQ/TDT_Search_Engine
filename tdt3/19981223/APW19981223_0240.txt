North Korea on Wednesday rejected the American-led U.N. Command's 
proposal for border talks to discuss the sinking of a suspected communist 
spy boat in South Korean waters. The low-slung, 12-ton North Korean 
boat went down off South Korea's south coast Friday in a gun battle 
with South Korean navy ships. The command, acting on a South Korean 
request, proposed to North Korea on Monday that military generals 
from both sides meet in the truce village of Panmunjom to protest 
what the Seoul government considered a ``grave military provocation.'' 
``Although obliged to respond favorably to such a proposal by the 
agreement establishing the general officer talks, the Korean People's 
Army today rejected the meeting,'' the command said in a news release 
Wednesday. The command said it will continue to press North Korea 
to live up to its obligations. South Korea said the craft was on a 
mission to land spies. But North Korea accused the South of fabricating 
the incident. With the help of the United States, South Korea keeps 
close watch on the North with camera-equipped satellites and spy planes 
and communications intercepts. Lacking such sophisticated tools, North 
Korea counters by trying to place spies in the South via land and 
sea routes. The U.N. Command and the North's Korean People's Army 
signed the 1953 armistice that ended the three-year Korean War, which 
American-led U.N. forces fought on South Korea's behalf. Both sides 
hold the general officer talks to discuss enforcement and violations 
of the armistice. The North Korean boat, believed to be carrying up 
to eight crewmen, was first spotted as it approached a port on the 
South's south coast. It was pursued for hours by South Korean warships 
before it was sunk in a gun battle. The lack of a peace treaty between 
the two Koreas leaves them technically still in a state of war.
