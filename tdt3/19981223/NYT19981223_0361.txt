The Rev. Lord Soper, a Methodist minister and Labor peer who was the 
most famous and longest-running soapbox orator at Speakers' Corner 
in Hyde Park, died on Tuesday in London. He was 95. A strikingly handsome 
silver-haired man dressed in a black cassock and white collar, he 
was always the one with the biggest crowds at the paved northern end 
of the park that on every Sunday since 1855 has been a gathering spot 
for robust debate, slashing give and take and display of British eccentricities. 
In the tradition of Speakers' Corner, he warmed to hecklers and bested 
them with humor, charming them by addressing them as ``fatheads'' 
and ``rascals.'' To a man who asked if after all God wasn't dead, 
he replied, ``Funny, I hadn't heard that He was unwell.'' To a very 
short man who ridiculed his pacifism, saying, ``If I'm attacked, shouldn't 
I defend myself?'' he looked down and said, ``In your case, I would 
advise against it.'' With stirring fluency of language, a prodigious 
vocabulary and a sonorous gravely voice, he inveighed passionately 
against disparate enemies including war, poverty, drinking, smoking, 
McCarthyism, gambling, apartheid, blood sports, abortion, euthanasia, 
exploitative employers, slave labor, capital punishment and profit. 
Decades before they became fashionable, he campaigned for the ordination 
of women, homosexual rights and vegetarian eating habits to spare 
animals. A lifelong Socialist, he said that Christianity and capitalism 
were incompatible. A republican, he chastised the Queen for going 
to the races because he said it encouraged betting, Prince Philip 
for playing polo on Sundays and the other members of the royal family 
for hunting deer and foxes. He objected to the growing mention of 
sex, saying, ``It doubles the crowd, but it halves the argument.'' 
But he insisted on dwelling on sin. ``Talking about Christianity without 
saying anything about sin is like discussing gardening without saying 
anything about weeds,'' he explained. He was unshakable in his convictions, 
sticking to his absolute pacifism even during World War II when German 
planes were bombing the homes and work places of the people he was 
speaking to. Asked in later years what he would do if the Russians 
invaded Britain, he said, ``Welcome them with a cup of tea.'' He had 
taken his crusade for radical causes outdoors for the first time in 
1926, speaking to dockers and other workers at Tower Hill in East 
London, and he continued speaking there every Wednesday even after 
he began his Sunday afternoon sermons in Hyde Park in the early 1940s. 
No amount of London weather could cause him to cancel, and he regularly 
harangued crowds in lashing rain and blustery gales. He said his motto 
was ``Hit 'em as hard as you can as long as it's above the belt,'' 
and he told The Times of London in 1991 that he thrived on the twice 
weekly events because there were not many opportunities for personal 
confrontation anymore. ``They have all been swallowed up by public 
relations,'' he said. Donald Oliver Soper was born in London on Jan. 
31, 1903, to deeply religious Methodist parents. He decided to become 
a minister when he was 13, encouraged by his father, an insurance 
salesman and temperance campaigner. His Methodist convictions deepened 
at Cambridge where he was an undergraduate and the London School of 
Economics, where he obtained a doctorate. He had developed his ability 
to attract attention in school, where he excelled as an athlete and 
an academic. In an incident, though, that he said scarred him for 
life, a cricket ball he had bowled bounced up errantly and struck 
an 18-year-old classmate in the chest, killing him instantly. The 
young man had a defective heart, it emerged. He began his inner city 
brand of ministry at the South London Mission in 1926 and 10 years 
later became head of the West London Mission, one of the city's great 
pulpits, where for the next 42 years he preached to throngs in the 
large Kingsway Hall. In his years there it became the biggest single 
social service entity of any church in Britain, devoting its attentions 
particularly to prisoners, homeless girls, unmarried mothers and juvenile 
offenders. After his retirement in 1978, he continued with his Sunday 
morning sermons at another Methodist church. Prime Minister Harold 
Wilson made him a life peer in 1965, and he took the title Baron Soper 
of Kingsway. He spoke out frequently on his favorite subjects in the 
House of Lords, campaigning for higher taxes on liquor and tobacco. 
In 1987 he founded an evangelical crusade for young people called 
the Order of Christian Witness, and in 1988 he became the chairman 
of the League Against Cruel Sports, which campaigns against hunting. 
In recent years he had suffered from arthritis, and he increasingly 
used a wheelchair and had to be lifted in place to deliver his weekly 
outdoor sermons. His wife, Marie, died in 1994, and he is survived 
by four daughters, nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. 
On his 90th birthday, he explained why he never retired from his vigorous 
pastoral work. ``I am a Methodist preacher, and I suppose in some 
respects I'm peculiar in that I never wanted to do anything else,'' 
he said. ``I never had any doubts that I was going to offer myself 
to the church as a preacher, therefore you can say I'm an addict. 
Or you can say I have a calling. But I'm committed. And that's not 
a credit to me. It's just a condition.'' An accomplished pianist, 
he loved the playing of Jelly Roll Morton and collected jazz recordings. 
He could not, he said, ``contemplate heaven without the music of Bach 
and Fats Waller.''
