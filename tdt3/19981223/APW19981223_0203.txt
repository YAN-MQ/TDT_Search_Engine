The NATO-led peace force in Bosnia removed Croatian police from a 
disputed area along Bosnia's western border to Croatia, NATO announced 
on Wednesday. Bosnia and Croatia are currently negotiating to define 
the border near Martin Brod, a small town in Bosnia, some 220 kilometers 
(150 miles) west of Sarajevo. Martin Brod was considered in Bosnia 
before the 1991-1995 war but since the fighting ended in this area, 
Croatian authorities moved the border deeper into Bosnian territory. 
When they returned into the area after fighting stopped, many of the 
residents of Martin Brod found their homes or land on the other side 
of the border, in Croatia. Croatian border police prevented them to 
go there. Bosnia's top international official, Carlos Westendorp, 
sent a letter to both countries saying until the two border commissions 
agree on the frontier, he wqill consider the pre-war demarcation line 
to be valid. This means that the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation should 
be in charge of the area instead of Croatia. In response to a request 
from Westendorp's office, the NATO-led peace force removed the Croatian 
police without any incident, a NATO press release said. ``The territory 
is now under the jurisdiction of the Federation police,'' the statement 
said.
