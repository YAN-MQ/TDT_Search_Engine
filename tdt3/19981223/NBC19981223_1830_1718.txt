That's just the right note for me to say, we've all been through a 
lot this year. And I know it's taxed the patience of just about everyone, 
including, incidentally, those F us on this side of the camera. We 
still have a ways to go together. A little break might help, so I'm 
off for Christmas and the first week of the new year. I'll see you 
back here in the first week in January. May you have the happiest 
of holidays and a glorious new year. That's "Nightly News." I'm Tom
