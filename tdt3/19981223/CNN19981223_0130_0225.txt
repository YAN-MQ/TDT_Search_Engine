House republicans are preparing to present their case against president 
clinton to the Senate. But as Bob Franken reports, some house republicans 
are now considering options short of removing Mr. Clinton from office. 
Sources tell CNN there are "more than a dozen" house republican moderates 
who now want the Senate to adopt a punishment of president clinton 
short of removal from office even though they voted for impeachment. 
Many are not going public yet, but Bob franks, of New Jersey has. 
Franks issued a statement supporting the call by former presidents 
Ford and carter for -- "A bipartisan censure resolution." But -- "the 
president must acknowledge that he lied under oath." Something President 
Clinton has steadfastly refused to do. Franks joins four other republican 
congressmen, Boehlert, Gilman, Greenwood and castle, who sent a letter 
to senator Trent Lott suggesting that "A remedy short of removal is 
in order." Most democrats were unimpressed. I'm disturbed that they 
didn't say that before they voted in the house. That seems to me it 
would have been a more timely place and time to make that point. Many 
republicans didn't allow for this vote and the only way we could keep 
it going was to send it over to the Senate. Some senators were quick 
to dismiss the statement from democratic senator Robert Byrd in which 
he called on "the White House or any entity beyond the current membership 
of the Senate" to stay out of the censure negotiations. I think it 
would be pretty hard to do this -- the censure route -- without talking 
at all with the White House, the people who are going to be censured. 
Although there are no formal negotiations, sources tell CNN, friends 
of the president are soliciting ideas for a censure proposal from 
so-called political "elders" from both parties. One who was asked 
says "I think this man," meaning President Clinton, "will have to 
be publicly humiliated beyond impeachment" with maximum news coverage, 
including live television. Bob Franken, CNN, Capitol Hill.
