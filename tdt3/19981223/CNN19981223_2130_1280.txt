After becoming the first wideout to gain 1,000 yards with three different 
teams, former patriot, dolphin and current eagle, Irving Fryar says 
this sunday will be his last in the NFL, ending a 15-year pro career. 
15 years has flown by. But at the same time it's had its moments when 
it's dragged along, too. But yeah, it's been pretty hard to believe 
that it's been 15 years. It doesn't feel lime 15. Doesn't seem like 
15. When I genuinely accepted it in my heart it was like a house was 
lifted off my shoulders.
