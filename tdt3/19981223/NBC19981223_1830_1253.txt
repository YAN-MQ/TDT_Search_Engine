And back here on the ground -- even if most of the country had not 
turned cold, you'd know it was Christmas because of all the trees 
everywhere. You might not give them a second thought the rest of the 
year. But to the people who grow them, it's a high risk, all consuming 
business. NBC's Mike Boettcher explains. Your holiday centerpiece, 
the Christmas tree. It's hard to tell how straight they are. Chances 
are, you paid more this year. This was about $30 last year. It's now 
$40. And are probably wondering why. $59.54 is your total. Well, it 
turns out a $700 million business that sells a symbol of goodwill 
is as cutthroat as Wall Street, and sometimes worse. In the tree business, 
remember, there's only one month to sell the product. It's not really 
just growing trees. We're making memories. Making memories is risky, 
as Jim heater, owner of silver mountain christmas tree farm in sublimity, 
Oregon, can attest. With a crop of 3 1/2 million firs, he's one of 
the country's largest tree farmers. These trees are the class of 2002, 
ready for harvest in four years. But there is risk for the tree farmer. 
No way of knowing what the economy will be like then. No guarantee 
of profits. There were no profits the past decade. A glut of trees 
sparked a ruthless pricing war and many tree growers went broke, resulting 
now in an undersupply and generally higher prices. It's feast or famine. 
From seedling to maturity takes ten years, with an investment of about 
$12 per tree, the amount it takes to nurture a seedling prune it every 
year and protect it from disease. To move trees from forest to truck 
requires expensive helicopters. And there's a cost you wouldn't expect. 
In such a competitive business, farmers depend on Gallup polls. The 
results most American's prefer, shapely Noble firs. So while you admire 
your tree -- There you go our Angel. Remember, it's the end of an 
investment that began when Ronald reagan was president and the Berlin 
wall was standing. This year it finally paid off. And the man who 
planted it is celebrating a very, merry Christmas. Mike Boettcher, 
NBC news, sublimity, Oregon.
