The title of John Bayley's ``Elegy for Iris'' is a little misleading 
since the Iris of the title _ Iris Murdoch, the novelist and philosopher, 
to whom Bayley is married _ is still quite alive, both in the pages 
of this memoir and in reality. But Ms. Murdoch suffers from Alzheimer's 
disease, as Bayley, himself a literary critic and novelist (``The 
Red Hat''), reveals in the second chapter of his touching book. He 
writes: ``The power of concentration has gone, along with the ability 
to form coherent sentences and to remember where she is, or has been. 
She does not know she has written 26 remarkable novels, as well as 
her books on philosophy; received honorary doctorates from the major 
universities; become a Dame of the British Empire.'' So presumably 
by using the word elegy in his title Bayley meant to write of an Iris 
who has gone away, who has done what he was always afraid she would 
do in the fantasy he has had of their relationship as ``a fairy story 
_ the kind with sinister overtones and not always a happy ending _ 
in which a young man loves a beautiful maiden who returns his love 
but is always disappearing into some unknown and mysterious world, 
about which she will reveal nothing.'' He concludes, ``Eventually, 
he makes some dire mistake, and she disappears for good.'' Certainly 
Bayley tries to draw some distinction between the old Iris and the 
new, between the well and the ill. Three-fourths of the book is called 
``Then,'' the last 50 pages ``Now.'' In the ``Then'' section he describes 
how he met and fell in love with Iris in 1954, when she was teaching 
philosophy at St. Anne's College, Oxford, and he was just completing 
his English studies and was about to become a teacher at St. Antony's 
College. In the ``Now'' section he reproduces entries in a 1997 diary 
detailing daily life with Alzheimer's. In the ``Then'' section he 
describes an Iris whose mind was so complex and mysterious that he 
could never hope to understand it. In the ``Now'' section she is an 
anxious child who keeps saying ``When?'' and ``I want.'' Before, their 
marriage was a joining of solitudes, a moving ``closer and closer 
apart,'' in the words of A.D. Hope, an Australian poet. Now, ``we 
move closer and closer together,'' Bayley writes, ``and Iris' little 
`mouse cry,' as I think of it, signifying loneliness in the next room, 
the wish to be back beside me, seems less and less forlorn, more simple, 
more natural.'' Yet for all that Bayley tries to separate the two 
Irises, they keep blending in both sections. In the ``Now'' section 
he encounters the ghost-parts of the former Iris, her gentleness, 
her love of company, her goodness. In the ``Then'' section, a woman 
whose husband also has Alzheimer's says to him, ``Like being chained 
to a corpse, isn't it?'' Bayley is repelled. ``How could our cases 
be compared?'' he asks the reader. ``Iris was Iris.'' Very much alive 
to him still, despite his title. What makes her alive in these pages 
is her husband's love, which is so absolute and mysterious that it 
pervades every word he writes. It is not a particularly sexual love; 
``Certainly our bedroom habits (the deep, deep peace of the double 
bed after the hurly-burly on the chaise longue, as Mrs. Pat Campbell 
noted) were always peaceful and unbothered by considerations of better, 
or more.'' What brought them together was more the discovery of the 
children in each other. Of the night they first ``fell into each other's 
arms,'' Bayley writes, ``With arms around each other, kissing and 
rubbing noses (I said how much I loved her snub nose), we rambled 
on and on, seeming to invent on the spot, as we talked, a whole infantile 
language of our own.'' Looked at objectively, some of what Bayley 
describes is desperate. Whenever Iris, made anxious by time's loss 
of conventional shape and progression, asks, ``When are we leaving?'' 
he thinks of the blinded airman in Faulkner's novel ``Soldiers' Pay'' 
who keeps saying to his friend, ``When are they going to let me out?'' 
Iris' compulsive behavior _ collecting trash from the street, overwatering 
the houseplants, following the author around the house for reassurance 
_ often drives him to angry outbursts: ``You're mad. You're dotty. 
You don't know anything, remember anything, care about anything,'' 
he reports himself shouting at her. The use of diary form in the ``Now'' 
section suggests that he is resorting to the advice of the Rev. Sydney 
Smith, whom he describes as ``a benevolent clergyman of Jane Austen's 
time,'' who ``used to urge parishioners in the grip of depression 
who appealed to him for help to `take short views of human life _ 
never further than dinner or tea.''' Bayley continues: ``I used to 
quote this to Iris when troubles began, as if I were recommending 
a real policy which could intelligibly be followed. Now I repeat it 
sometimes as an incantation or joke, which can raise a laugh if it 
is accompanied by some horsing around, a live pantomime of `short 
views' being taken. It is not now intended to be rationally received, 
but it gets a smile anyway.'' In the book's final entry, dated Dec. 
25, 1997, Bayley concludes his account of the day: ``A snooze then. 
Iris will sleep deeply. Later we listen to carols and Christmas music. 
And I have the illusion, which fortunate Alzheimer's partners must 
feel at such times, that life is just the same, has never changed. 
I cannot imagine Iris any different. Her loss of memory becomes, in 
a sense, my own. In a muzzy way _ the Bulgarian wine, no doubt _ I 
find myself thinking of the Christian birth, and also of Wittgenstein's 
comment that death is not a human experience. We are born to live 
only from day to day. . . . The Rev. Sydney Smith's advice is most 
easily taken during these ritualized days. The ancient saving routine 
of Christmas, which for us today has been twice blessed.'' So in ``Elegy 
for Iris,'' Bayley celebrates his beloved partner's survival. PUBLICATION
