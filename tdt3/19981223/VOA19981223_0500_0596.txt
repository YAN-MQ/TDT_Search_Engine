The United States is said to be considering expelling three Cuban 
diplomats accredited to the United Nations for alleged espionage activities. 
The Washington Post newspaper quotes diplomatic sources as saying 
the Cuban Mission at the United Nation's, was notified of the U.S. 
intentions, earlier in the week. The report says Cuban officials were 
given 24 hours to counter the charges, but there is no word, at this 
time, if Cuba has come up with any reply. The newspaper did not learn 
the nature of this alleged espionage. But, it quotes unnamed sources 
as saying, " The case may be linked to the arrest of 10 Cuban Nationals 
in Miami, last September." The 10 were accused of collecting intelligence 
about U.S. military installations, in Southern Florida, and trying 
to infiltrate local anti-Castro groups.
