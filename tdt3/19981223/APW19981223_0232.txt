The president and vice president of one of Poland's leading companies 
_ Elektrim SA _ have resigned due to a scandal surrounding a secret 
deal to sell a lucrative cellular telephone stake for a nominal price. 
The resignations of longtime president Andrzej Skowronski and first 
vice president Emilian Bryk were accepted late Tuesday by the supervisory 
board of Elektrim, a founding member of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. 
Supervisory board chairman Ryszard Jacyno will take over temporary 
management of Elektrim, and Jan Kolodziejczak, vice chairman of the 
board, will take over Jacyno's duties, according to a statement issued 
Tuesday night. Elektrim announced last month that it agreed in 1996 
to sell a 6.5 percent stake in Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa, the nation's 
first cellular telephone company, for little more than the nominal 
price at the time, when the company was first being organized. Polska 
Telefonia Cyfrowa later was given one of two licenses to operate a 
digital cellular telephone network, and its business has boomed. Analysts 
estimate the 6.5 percent stake is now worth as much as dlrs 150 million, 
perhaps five times more than Elektrim would receive under the 1996 
deal with a financial backer. Elektrim's share price fell by nearly 
30 percent after the announcement, which sparked an investigation 
by Poland's Securities and Exchange Commission and demands by angry 
shareholders for the resignation of top managers. Jacek Socha, chairman 
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the deal should have 
been disclosed sooner because it was important for Elektrim's share 
price. In its statement Tuesday, the Elektrim supervisory board said 
no member of management broke any law in connection with the deal. 
Elektrim is a diversified company with holdings in telecommunications, 
power generation equipment and other aspects of electrical engineering.
