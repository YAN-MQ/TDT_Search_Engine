British tycoon Richard Branson is guiding his hot air balloon toward 
shanghai, China, this evening at 60 miles per hour. It hasn't all 
been smooth sailing in his attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Nic 
Robertson has more. It was high over the Himalayas that Richard Branson 
and his gas balloon ran into trouble. The balloon strayed off course 
Monday, outside air corridors previously agreed to by the Chinese 
government. We just needed a different bearing to get us out, get 
us to China, any way. That's what we're left on, that's what we're 
hoping for in the next few hours. The Chinese, who say they were concerned 
about air traffic safety in their airspace, told the balloonists Tuesday 
they would have to land. Faced with being forced to land and abandoning 
their record-breaking attempt, Branson relayed messages to his ground 
support staff on how to convince the Chinese to let the flight continue. 
We would ask you to realize that this is no ordinary balloon. We are 
currently over very high, snow-clad mountains. British prime minister 
Tony Blair also sent a message to the chinese, as Branson's ground 
team tried to get the message out that landing would be dangerous. 
We cannot steer the balloon as it goes where the wind takes it. We 
have full cloud cover and cannot see the ground. We cannot descend 
through the cloud, as it will create ice on the balloon, resulting 
in a crash. Oh, look, we've just got permission to do this -- to go 
to China. a last-minute reprieve for Branson and his team by Chinese 
authorities has allowed them to continue their global flight. I think 
diplomacy won the day. And, you know, using friends like Ted Heath 
and, you know, Tony Blair at number 10. The balloon, already forced 
to change its flight path to avoid the "operation desert fox" in Iraq, 
may now be back on track -- weather, fuel and politics permitting.
