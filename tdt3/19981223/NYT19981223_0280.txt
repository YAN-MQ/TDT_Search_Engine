For baby-boomers who love the television shows of their childhood, 
the scene on Tuesday evening at Restoration Hardware, a home-furnishings 
store on lower Fifth Avenue, was pure ``Twilight Zone.'' Circling 
a tall Christmas tree and sofa, and heaped high on a coffee table, 
were stacks and stacks of toys introduced in the 1940s and '50s, like 
a holiday that had been kept on ice: tin speedboats, gyroscopes, Shoot 
the Moon games, Slinkys and yo-yos. William Watkins, a 42-year-old 
film producer, was piling a basket fast with tin rockets, penguins, 
trains and robots. Another customer had walked off with the last DC-3 
airplane while Watkins was taking a quick stroll through the store, 
a fact that he now sorely regretted. ``He who hesitates . . . ,'' 
Watkins said, as the woman next to him picked out a kazoo. The gring, 
gring of handle-bar bicycle bells went off steadily in the background. 
Who were the toys for? ``Friends,'' he said. ``In their 40s. They 
all have everything they could possibly want.'' John Badeer, a 28-year-old 
investment banker, walked by with three Slinkys under his arm. ``They're 
for my brothers and sisters,'' he said. And how young were they? ``They're 
older, in their 30s. My oldest brother's a trader. It will give him 
something to play with when he's stressing out. I work at J.P. Morgan. 
It's pretty surprising how many Slinkys I see.'' Russ Orenstein, a 
37-year-old publisher, had four colored yo-yos in tow. As gifts for 
children? ``Some are,'' he said. ``The blue one's for me.'' Not since 
Kane whispered ``Rosebud'' has the nation thought so hard about the 
toys from its past. Baby-boomers, now parents and grandparents, are 
hitting their second childhood. A generation about to slip into senior-citizenship 
has created a growing market for newly produced classic toys, from 
log building sets to electric football fields to Dr. Seuss books, 
and it doesn't have to go to toy stores to find them. Boomers can 
walk into home stores like Pottery Barn, drugstores like CVS, clothing 
stores like Bergdorf Goodman and J.C. Penney or order through catalogs 
like L.L. Bean, Garnet Hill and Avon. Restoration Hardware's New York 
store sold more than 200 tin trains, 150 sock monkeys and 200 gyroscopes 
last weekend. ``They're not buying them for the kids, to be honest,'' 
said Jeffrey Whitney, the store's assistant manager. Restoration, 
with 64 outlets nationally, reported sales of 15,000 Slinkys and 15,000 
yo-yos _ the 1955 wooden reissue from Duncan _ this month. ``Adults 
are definitely playing a larger and larger part in toy sales, buying 
toys for themselves,'' said Cliff Annicelli, associate editor of Playthings, 
a monthly toy-industry trade publication. The yo-yo has become a craze 
this year for the second time since its debut in 1928. Mike Burke, 
marketing manager of Duncan Toys, said his company is shipping ``hundreds 
of thousands a week.'' Those sales are cross-generational, he added. 
Wham-O, the company that launched the Hula Hoop, the Frisbee and the 
Super Ball, went back into business in June, reincarnated by a 38-year-old 
former Mattel executive. Diane Brush, director of merchandise for 
Garnet Hill, speaking of toys for adults, said, ``It's great stress 
relief.'' (The caption beneath the tin robots in Garnet Hill's current 
catalog states flatly, ``Not intended for children.'' ) Ms. Brush 
said of Garnet Hill's president: ``Every summer his wife buys him 
300 balsa airplanes, so he can sit on the back deck and fly them. 
When he has people over for drinks, the cartons come out and everyone 
gets a few.'' In addition to catalogs and so-called lifestyle department 
stores, adults can also go to specialty toy stores that emphasize 
traditional toys, from mom-and-pop operations like the Toy Box, in 
Ligonier, Penn., outside Pittsburgh, to chains like Zany Brainy and 
Noodle Kidoodle. Or they can go to online businesses, like Back to 
Basics Toys or Etoys. ``Thirty-five percent of our offering is classic 
toys,'' said Jane Saltzman, vice president of merchandising for Etoys. 
``It's a top-10 click, from over 100 categories.'' Boomers can also 
find the originals at antique shops or collectors' shows; there are 
now more than 10,000 vintage toy events each year. The ``big two'' 
of the $20 billion toy industry _ Mattel and Hasbro _ are not letting 
the adults get away, either. ``They need them because they're losing 
children at an earlier age, to computers, telephones, electronics 
and apparel,'' said Richard Brady, president of Play Co. Toys and 
Entertainment Corp., a toy retailer that has expanded aggressively 
this year in the category of traditional toys. ``Girls _ they used 
to have them until 12 or 13, now they drop out of toys at age 10,'' 
he said. ``The same with boys. They're dropping out at 8 _ they used 
to have them until 12.'' According to a report published by the NPD 
Group, a retail market-research company, 16.3 percent of toy recipients 
in 1997 were over 18. G.I. Joe, a 34-year-old character, is now ``mostly 
adult sales,'' said a Hasbro representative. The company's Furby, 
an electronic plush pet, became this season's ``it'' toy by crossing 
the line between children and adults, according to David Niggli, executive 
vice president of merchandising for FAO Schwarz. But Mattel's Barbie, 
who turns 40 next year in a bouffant of publicity, is the 400-pound 
canary in the toy market _ thanks to several generations of paying 
admirers. ``Barbie dominates,'' said Ed Roth, of the NPD Group, ``with 
over $1 billion in sales in the U.S. last year.'' Roth estimated that 
more than 15 percent of sales were adults buying Barbie for themselves. 
This has not escaped the notice of mass marketers like Avon, the world's 
leading direct seller of beauty products, which has gone into toy 
retailing. ``We're one of Mattel's top-10 customers,'' said Joyce 
Mullins-Jackson, director of marketing for Avon Toys, who transformed 
the company's gift and decorations division into a toy business in 
1996. The first Avon Barbie, ``Spring Blossom,'' had $14 million in 
sales. The second, ``Winter Velvet,'' doubled that. Priced at $34.99, 
it was aimed at adults. Careful not to neglect any sales in the family, 
Avon also sold a Hot Wheels Father and Son Then and Now Mustang toy 
car. Toys are all of us. In a weird cocktail of marketing that is 
equal parts childhood and parenting _ think of the chocolate martini 
_ the toy industry, both manufacturers and retailers, has addressed 
the fact that it has an increasingly adult audience on its hands. 
``And that's why,'' says the voice-over of a television commercial 
from a new, nostalgic advertising campaign from the toy giant, Toys 
``R'' Us, ``50 years later, we still believe that life _ at any age 
_ should be fun.'' Children are seen playing Twister, a game from 
the 1960s. ``Parents want their kids to have the experiences they 
had when they owned the toy,'' said Eric Garfinkel, a lawyer who started 
Back to Basics Toys in 1988. ``Or if they didn't have the experience, 
they want to give it to their kids. I looked at myself as my prototypical 
customer. I had a 2-year-old son, and I couldn't find the classics 
I grew up with.'' Garfinkel, 44, continues to be a committed Nok Hockey 
player, a 57-year-old game featured in his catalog. Toy manufacturers 
like Dean Helfer, president of Channel Craft and Distribution, which 
makes jacks, pick-up-sticks and wooden toys, are aiming their business 
at men. Helfer's clients include J .C. Penney, Bergdorf Goodman, L.L. 
Bean and Levinger. Thomas Lowe, president of Playing Mantis, which 
manufactures classic die-cast toy cars and action figures like Dr. 
Evil, the Lone Ranger and Tonto, said: ``Everything we've done is 
geared toward males 25 to 45 _ 90 percent of our business. If you 
took the adults away we wouldn't exist.'' Lowe said his company sold 
8 million cars and 80,000 dolls last year. ``Guys like to hold them 
and look at them,'' he said. ``They get warm, fuzzy feelings.'' But 
are adults playing with their new toys? ``People are buying trains 
to play with,'' Judy Hoffman, senior vice president of sales and marketing 
for Lionel, the toy-train manufacturer. ``The trend is away from collectors 
who sit them on a shelf.'' Ms. Hoffman estimated that 65 percent of 
Lionel's buyers, who are largely adults buying for themselves, buy 
them to play with. The company now has a successful program with QVC, 
and Ms. Hoffman added that ``stores like Sharper Image will play a 
big part in our growth in the next year.'' At Restoration Hardware 
on Tuesday, children walked by the displays of toys and games briskly 
while parents sat down with them. ``It doesn't do anything,'' a young 
guard at the door explained to a man picking up a tin flying saucer. 
But it does. ``It's not just that people are regressing,'' said Gary 
Cross, a professor of history at Pennsylvania State University and 
the author of ``Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing Worlds of American 
Childhood'' (Harvard University Press; 1997). ``The flow of time in 
our century is the flow of goods. No one cares about the Cuban missile 
crisis _ but you care about the Barbie that was out that year. It's 
a way of placing yourself in time, reckoning with the fact you're 
middle-aged. It lets you laugh at the fact that childhood was a long 
time ago.'' Are we there yet? Can we go home now?
