In ``Patch Adams,'' Robin Williams plays a medical maverick who finds 
no situation too grim for a guffaw. He develops the theory that the 
best way to treat a dying patient who wants one last safari is to 
shock the man out of a sound sleep with balloon animals, for example. 
Naturally, the establishment is slow to appreciate Patch, to the point 
where he winds up making a heartfelt courtroom-style speech in defense 
of his methods. Here's a film for anyone who'd like to hear Williams 
declaim, ``If we're going to fight a disease, let's fight one of the 
most terrible diseases of all: indifference!'' Choosing another of 
the soggier roles he has lately favored, Williams spends a lot of 
time here smiling gratefully at the compliments heaped on him (``God, 
Patch, it's amazing what you've done with this place, you know?'') 
and looking significantly older than the medical student he initially 
plays. To save the material from utter oblivion, he also does his 
share of clowning, though it bears the stamp of the creative team 
(the director, Tom Shadyac, and the writer, Steve Oedekerk) behind 
some Jim Carrey films. The whiff of ``Ace Ventura'' extends to proctologist 
jokes, gynecologist jokes (including a big, bawdy sight gag) and masturbation 
jokes. Low humor might count for more here if it weren't constantly 
overshadowed by the film's maudlin streak. Williams, in a film based 
on a true story, plays a man whose own period of mental illness helps 
him empathize with patients and makes him vow to bring more laughs 
to their hospital experience. Dedicated to the point of wearing a 
bedpan on his head and an enema bulb on his nose, he keeps the nurses 
collapsing in grateful laughter and the patients charmed, while also 
courting a beautiful fellow student (Monica Potter) with a dark-eyed, 
nostrilly resemblance to Julia Roberts. ``People are good?'' he rails 
when life turns brutally tough. ``Trust people? Hah!'' But you can 
bet that the film's Patch will not let his kindness waver for long. 
Eventually he founds the Gesundheit Institute, billed here as ``the 
first fun hospital in the world'' and presumably the reason why playing 
Patch struck Williams as a good idea. But the role, like Marc Shaiman's 
noxious soundtrack, is too full of prefabricated sentiments to let 
an actor breathe. ``Patch Adams,'' which begins in 1969 and has a 
notably perfunctory period look, also features Philip Seymour Hoffman 
as the roommate too starchy to appreciate Patch, and Peter Coyote 
as one of the many desperately ill people who succumb to Patch's charms. 
(Williams arrives at his bedside amusingly dressed as an angel, calling 
this a ``preview of coming attractions.'') Also here is the year's 
least welcome technological advance, the computer-generated butterfly 
meant to provide a touch of magic for a film that has none of its 
own. PRODUCTION NOTES: `PATCH ADAMS' Directed by Tom Shadyac; written
