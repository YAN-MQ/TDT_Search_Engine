The Duke University Blue Devils have defeated Kentucky 71-60, while 
the Cincinnati BearCats beat Houston. In U.S. College basketball action, 
Elton Brand led the second ranked Blue Devils with 22 points, which 
avenged a loss to Kentucky in last year's collegian tournament. Duke 
coach Mike Kryzewski says that his team just played that much better 
than Kentucky. Well I really respect Kentucky, and I think they -- 
it was tough to score on them. And, we just were able to get a few 
more points, and our inside was, I think, a little bit better than 
their inside, today. And, Wangdon was very good. Kentucky coach, Tubby 
Smith, says he tried to get his team fired up. But, in the end, the 
Wildcats were not able to overcome the Blue Devils'attack. I trained 
harder. I thought that was an area where we were finishing with the 
basket. And, so I meant to be stronger and play harder. We got the 
ball inside, and we did. We did make a run there, and we just couldn't 
sustain it. Meanwhile, Alvin Mitchell scored a career-high 21 points, 
as third-ranked Cincinnati crushed Houston 115-78. Mitchell says his 
BearCats just wanted to pounce on the Cougars. We just wanted to come 
out all right, intentionally tonight. You know, we've been coming 
out slow like in our power games. Tonight we just wanted to come out 
and jump on them early. Six ranked North Carolina lost its Atlantic 
Coast opener to Georgia Tech, 66-64.
