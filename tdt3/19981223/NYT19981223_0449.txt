In the face of international calls for changes in the Iraqi weapons 
inspection program, the Clinton administration said Wednesday that 
it would stick to its demand that Iraq allow strict U.N. inspections 
to resume. Even as the Pentagon ordered a withdrawal of some of the 
U.S. forces sent to the Persian Gulf, National Security Adviser Sandy 
Berger said in a speech that the United States would continue to work 
to contain the regime of Saddam Hussein. He said that Washington stood 
ready to use force again to stop Baghdad from developing nuclear, 
chemical or biological weapons, and he demanded that economic sanctions 
remain in force. ``If there's not some method of verifying compliance, 
then we cannot envision there being any form of sanctions relief,'' 
Berger said. He continued: ``The strategy we can and will pursue is 
to contain Saddam in the short and medium term, by force if necessary, 
and to work toward a new government over the long term. The goal of 
containment is to prevent Saddam from rebuilding his deadly weapons 
and from threatening his neighbors.'' Yet even as Berger spoke, a 
former concealment expert with the U.N. Special Commission, Scott 
Ritter, said in an interview that the United States and Britain relied 
on obsolete intelligence in directing their bombing campaigns against 
Iraq's weapons-related plants. ``There is absolutely no doubt that 
we bombed a lot of empty buildings,'' said Ritter, who resigned from 
the Special Commission in August in disgust at U.S. policy. The Iraqis 
had been prepared for a military strike more than a month ago, when 
President Clinton called off a bombing raid at the last minute, and 
so had moved much of its most critical weapons-related equipment and 
infrastructure long before last week's air raids, Ritter said. ``I 
can tell you that the U.S. intelligence is not very good on this stuff,'' 
he said. Ritter's statements were echoed by a current Unscom inspector, 
Rod Barton, a microbiologist whose Op-Ed article in The New York Times 
on Wednesday was critical of the Clinton administration's Iraq policies. 
He wrote that the ``damage done to Iraq's weapon-making ability was 
probably marginal.'' Iraq, he wrote, has a well-honed ability to move 
and hide elements of its weapons programs. Coming in the face of such 
criticism _ in addition to renewed pressure from France, Russia and 
other nations for a diplomatic compromise between the United Nations 
and Iraq _ Berger's speech was intended to make it clear that Washington 
is not going to ease up on Baghdad, a White House official stressed. 
``The message is we are going to stay engaged in containing Saddam, 
and loosening the sanctions regime is not going to happen,'' the official 
said. Berger said the United States would oppose any efforts to weaken 
Unscom's authority to inspect and monitor Iraq's weapons programs, 
while also rejecting suggestions that the U.N. Security Council make 
it easier for Iraq to end years of economic sanctions. ``We should 
not reward Iraqi intransigence with new watered-down monitoring mechanisms 
designed to meet Iraq's demands,'' he said. ``We don't believe that 
we ought to lower the bar. We don't believe we ought to dumb down 
the system.'' Berger also observed that the bombing campaign was not 
designed to eliminate Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, or to 
oust him from power. Instead, the operation had less ambitious goals 
_ to degrade his weapons programs, and diminish his ability to control 
his country. ``The operation that ended on Saturday inflicted substantial 
damage on Saddam's weapons-of-mass-destruction programs and on his 
military capability to threaten his neighbors,'' Berger said. ``That 
does not mean the threat is gone.'' Meanwhile, the United States is 
moving to unwind the large military force it had built up in the region 
in recent weeks, administration officials said. The number of U.S. 
troops in the gulf region is scheduled to be reduced from more than 
29,000 to 21,000 to 22,000.
