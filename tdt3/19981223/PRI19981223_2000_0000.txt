From Public Radio International, this is The World -- a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH Boston. Today is Wednesday, 
December 23. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. Coming up -- the United States 
stands its ground on Iraq, saying there's no alternative to containing 
Saddam Hussein. In Senegal, women take a lead in banning a barbaric 
practice. And those friendly skies are anything but, thanks to more 
and more cases of air rage. This is a very serious state of affairs. 
It is a growing phenomenon. It's growing in number, and it's growing 
in severity. Also, we celebrate Christmas in Havana and hear the musical 
messages of Franco-Spanish singer Manu Chao. First, this news.
