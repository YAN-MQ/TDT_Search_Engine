In health news, a new approach to hip replacement surgery shows promise. 
Of the many health books, you pick the ones that give you the best 
advice. More good news about smoke-free work places, and what you 
eat before surgery, may slow down your recovery from the anesthetic. 
Jane Hughes has this report. Researchers have developed a way to produce 
a plastic life-sized model of the patients fractured, or malformed, 
hip socket. This model enables doctors to determine the extent of 
hip damage, more precisely than x-rays. The new approach uses an array 
of computerized scans to create the model. Researchers at Washington 
University, School of Medicine, in St. Louis, Missouri tested it on 
19 patients. They found a plastic model shows more clearly than x-rays, 
the amount of bone lost, and the type of prosthesis needed. Professor 
of medicine and lead researcher, Dr. Douglas Robertson, says that 
with the plastic model, the surgeon can even practice performing the 
surgery ahead of time.
