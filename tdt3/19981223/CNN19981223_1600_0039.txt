People dreaming of a white Christmas may actually get their wish this 
holiday season. Snow, ice and frigid temperatures are gripping much 
of the country. The blustery weather came as a surprise to people 
in the south, causing treacherous driving conditions from Texas across 
the Tennessee valley to the carolinas. Holly Firfer has more. After 
enjoying record warm temperatures yesterday morning, today across 
the country, people woke up to single digits and in some places snow 
and sleet. New York residents bundled up as the temperature plunged 
36 degrees, from a Record high of 63 to a blistering 27 degrees which 
felt like 12 degrees with the windchill. As temperatures dipped in 
Chicago, the frigid weather has health officials concerned. The mayor 
and all the authorities in the city, very early, told the people to 
protect themselves. Staying indoors and trying to avoid exposure. 
In Washington D.C., visitors were chilled from head to toe, while 
waiting in line outside the Smithsonian to see the Van gogh exhibit. 
Trying to stay as warm as they could. We've been here since 6:30 in 
the morning freezing stuff. Meanwhile, in the southern states, the 
cold weather has made traveling a nightmare. Icy roads caused a 39-car 
pile up on interstate 35 near Austin, Texas, leaving two people dead, 
and at least 16 injured. In Dallas, those hoping to head out of town 
for the holidays were slowed as ice blanketed the highways. And those 
at the airport didn't fare any better. Ice was also blamed for accidents 
in Alabama and traffic jams throughout tennessee. I left about 6:45. 
The expressways were terrible. I went a different way to come this 
way, it took me about 30 minutes longer than usual to get here. But 
those who really don't need to be anywhere in a hurry welcomed this 
winter wonderland. Holly Firfer, CNN.
