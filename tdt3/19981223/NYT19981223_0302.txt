At first glance, she could be a shining example of a modern California 
girl. She studies in honors classes as a senior at the public high 
school in Encinitas, Calif., and she's applying to top-tier colleges 
like Brown University and the University of California at Berkeley. 
She speaks five languages and takes classical piano lessons. She has 
written for the school newspaper, acted in school plays and become 
a community representative in her high school's feminist club. She 
goes out dancing to techno and trance music and listens to R&AMP;B, 
British pop and a little heavy metal. She fights with her mother over 
curfews. And she's addicted, she says, to exchanging e-mail with her 
friends. But one look at her left hand _ and the thick, purple-striped 
calluses on her fingers _ reveals that she has another life. Anoushka 
Shankar, the 17-year-old daughter of the renowned sitar master Ravi 
Shankar, is also her father's student and disciple, and sometimes 
she has to miss school to perform with him at concert halls around 
the world. She may be a Metallica fan, but she is also mastering Indian 
classical music: the raga compositions and rhythmic cycles that have 
been passed down through centuries of oral tradition. Her debut album, 
``Anoushka'' (Angel/EMI), was released in October; it's a recital 
of compositions by her father and pieces that he has popularized. 
Two hours a day on weekdays, and three or four hours a day on weekends, 
Ms. Shankar practices the sitar, learning the repertory and picking 
up improvisational ideas from her father. ``Everything changes when 
I walk into the music room,'' she said in her hotel suite on her last 
visit to New York, when she performed alongside her father at Carnegie 
Hall. ``I could be lying with my feet in my father's lap watching 
a movie, but the second we walk into the music room, I am a disciple. 
In general, it's a situation of utter surrender on the disciple's 
part, and utter respect. It may not be as much with me as with his 
other students, because I'm his daughter and I'm a little spoiled. 
But it is a beautiful relationship.'' Ms. Shankar found out she was 
Ravi Shankar's daughter when she was 7 years old, and he was 68. ``He 
was always a kind of father figure in my life,'' she said. Anoushka 
lived with her mother in London and when Shankar came through on tour, 
they would visit him in his hotel; Anoushka called him Baba (father) 
as a term of respect. When Ravi Shankar married her mother in 1988, 
a blood test showed that Anoushka was his daughter, and she changed 
her last name to Shankar from her mother's name. Two years later, 
at her mother's urging, she began studying the sitar with her father 
in New Delhi, where she still spends summers, and then in California. 
She got started in Indian music reluctantly. ``I had always enjoyed 
listening,'' Ms. Shankar said. ``I could sit happily and listen to 
my dad teaching the other students. But then it would be so frustrating 
to go back and have to do all the beginning skills. The better I got, 
the more I started to enjoy playing. And at about 12, my dad said 
to me: `Look, you've got to get serious about it. If you don't want 
to play, that's fine, but if I'm going to teach you it should be something 
deeper.' By then, I loved it.'' While most of Ravi Shankar's students 
come to him when they are already skilled musicians, his daughter 
started with him as a beginner. In a way, that makes Ms. Shankar the 
purest of her father's disciples, musically formed entirely in his 
image. ``It is better to have soft wax than a hard stone,'' Ravi Shankar 
said. Ms. Shankar began sharing the stage with her father when she 
was 13, and her performances with him have drawn glowing reviews. 
``She's special,'' Peter Watrous wrote in The New York Times in 1996. 
``We have a bond that comes up only onstage,'' Ms. Shankar said. ``It's 
spiritual, and then it's my father, and then it's my guru, and it's 
the beautiful music and the excitement, and then it's my own excitement 
in being onstage and if I play well. It's just amazing. Even when 
it's really dark and you can't see the people, you're just aware of 
that many people being there, and it adds an energy, especially when 
it's a really great audience that's enjoying the music. You feel this 
energy _ I know it pumps my dad up, and it pumps me up. And when they 
applaud after you play the music, I love that feeling.'' Yet Ms. Shankar 
still considers herself a relative novice. Indian classical music 
is an improviser's medium, with a performer creating up to 90 percent 
of a piece. And Ms. Shankar does little improvising in public; onstage 
and on her album, her bursts of exuberant virtuosity are largely composed. 
The album is, she says, ``a baby step'' that acknowledges her father's 
pervasive role in her music. ``I don't think I really have much of 
a musical personality of my own yet,'' she added. ``I'm still really 
self-conscious about improvising in front of people. I always have 
this fear that it's going to be wrong. But it's slowly been getting 
better, so it will go away _ it kind of has to. I'm improvising a 
little bit more as time goes on, but it's hard for me to say what's 
going to happen when I go off on my own, because I'm sure it's going 
to change.'' Ms. Shankar intends to keep her traditional and modern 
worlds separate. ``A lot of my friends want me to add a techno beat 
to the sitar and stuff like that,'' she said. ``But that's not the 
kind of thing I want to do. Coming from my father and learning in 
such a serious way from him, I'd feel almost that I was doing something 
bad. I have such a spiritual respect for the sitar that I want to 
keep that the way it is.'' Ravi Shankar has taught generations of 
students, and his legacy in Indian music will not rest entirely with 
his daughter. He is philosophical about how the family tradition will 
evolve in his daughter's hands. ``She would excel at anything she 
put her mind to,'' he said. ``What happens to her music will depend 
on her talent. And on her karma.''
