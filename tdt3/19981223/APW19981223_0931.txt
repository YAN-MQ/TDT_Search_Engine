Care for AIDS patients in the United States is less expensive than 
generally believed _ about dlrs 20,000 per person per year, according 
to a new study. The study estimated a total cost of dlrs 6.7 billion 
annually, or less than 1 percent of all U.S. medical expenditures 
on patients. ``Compared to what we spend on all kinds of other things, 
it's just not that much money'' for the government to spend, said 
project co-director Dr. Samuel A. Bozzette, a health care researcher 
at RAND, the Santa Monica, California, think tank overseeing the government-sponsored 
research. The dlrs 20,000 tab is roughly one-third of the estimates 
from the early 1990s, when firm figures were hard to come by, and 
before the advent of AIDS drug cocktails that have proven powerfully 
effective in fending off the disease and keeping patients out of the 
hospital. The study was conducted in 1996, just as the combination 
therapy was coming into widespread use. It found 55 percent of people 
being treated for HIV were taking one of the newer AIDS drugs by December 
1996. Doctors believe use of the new drugs has since risen sharply. 
The study estimated that only half of all American adults infected 
with the AIDS virus saw their doctor at least once every six months. 
Many of those not getting care were unaware they were infected. However, 
an encouraging 85 percent of those with full-blown AIDS were getting 
regular care, with most of them seeing AIDS specialists. Early treatment 
can slow the disease, extend lifespan and save money by reducing hospitalizations. 
The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
It was based on interviews of 3,072 people treated in hospitals or 
doctors' offices in dozens of urban and rural areas around the country.
