Pitcher, Roger Clemens, of major league baseball's Toronto Blue Jays, 
has withdrawn his demand to be traded. Baseball's only five-time Cy 
Young Award winner says he would still accept a deal if Toronto works 
one out. And, he would not set preconditions to re-negotiate his $31.1 
million four-year contract. I'll go out there and win as many games 
as I possibly can do with Toronto. And, if something else comes up 
where Toronto thinks they can improve their team for the immediate 
future, or down the road, then we'll talk again. Clemens had hoped 
for a trade to a team closer to his home in Texas, but Toronto could 
not work out any deal. Toronto wants three to four quality players, 
or minor league prospects, if it decides to trade the 36-year old, 
hard-throwing, right hander.
