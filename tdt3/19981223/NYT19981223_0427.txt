James R. Tobin, the president and chief executive officer of Biogen 
Inc., resigned abruptly and mysteriously on Wednesday, sending the 
stock of the biotechnology company down 8 percent in heavy trading. 
Biogen said that Tobin had resigned his posts and his seat on the 
board of directors, effective immediately, for ``personal reasons.'' 
His positions will be assumed by James L. Vincent, the company's chairman, 
who had been the chief executive before Tobin took over in 1997. Executives 
of the company, based in Cambridge, Mass., declined to elaborate on 
Tobin's reasons for stepping down and said he was not available to 
comment. But they insisted the resignation, which came at a board 
meeting on Tuesday, was not related to the operations of the company, 
which are ``in the best shape'' in the company's history. ``The event 
is not connected with any other happening at the company,'' Vincent 
said in a conference call with securities analysts on Wednesday. ``This 
was not a discharge,'' Vincent said. ``This was not a gentle pushing. 
This was not a whisper in the ear.'' He also said that he did not 
have a dispute over strategy with Tobin and that Biogen was ``not 
going to have any lurching changes in strategy.'' Still, the reluctance 
of the company to state the reasons led to numerous rumors and clearly 
worried investors. Shares of Biogen fell $7.0625, or 8 percent, to 
$79.8125, with 17.7 million shares changing hands, 12 times the recent 
daily average. Tobin had been popular on Wall Street because of his 
friendly manner and was credited by analysts with spurring sales of 
Biogen's only product, Avonex, a multiple sclerosis drug. Before Wednesday's 
tumble, Biogen stock price had nearly tripled from its 12-month low 
of $32.75. ``Obviously it's disturbing to have something like this 
happen and it's going to put a cloud over the stock for the short 
term,'' said Meirav Chovav, a biotechnology analyst with Salomon Smith 
Barney. But she added that Avonex continued to do well and that she 
``fully believes'' that there are no operational issues involved in 
the resignation. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, Biogen reported net 
income of $37.57 million, up 83 percent compared with results in the 
period a year earlier. Revenue surged 44 percent, to $152.9 million, 
mainly from sales of Avonex. Matt Geller, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer 
in New York, said that despite rising Avonex sales, Biogen still faced 
critical challenges, including coming up with a second product. ``There's 
nothing yet that's compelling, where you can say this clearly is going 
to be a product,'' he said. Meanwhile, he said, Avonex, which is known 
generically as beta interferon, already faces competition from a similar 
drug, Betaseron, marketed by Schering A.G. of Germany. And a third 
company, Ares-Serono S.A. in Switzerland, is trying to enter the U.S. 
market with its drug. Also, he said, the company's royalties from 
products it developed but that are sold by others will shrink starting 
in 2001. Vincent, 59, who will once again take over as chief executive, 
came to Biogen as chief executive in 1985, turned the money-losing 
company around and then brought Avonex to the market in 1996. But 
he then turned the company over to Tobin. He said he intended to remain 
chief executive this time for only a year or two and planned to find 
a successor from within Biogen's ranks. Tobin, 54, spent most of his 
career at Baxter International, the medical products company, rising 
to president and chief operating officer in 1992. But he resigned 
_ also just before Christmas _ in 1993 after disputes over strategy 
with the chief executive. Biogen hired him in February 1994 as president 
and chief operating officer and made him chief executive in February 
1997. Vincent said that because Tobin resigned voluntarily, he would 
not receive severance pay. But the company proxy from last April showed 
that Tobin owned 541,668 shares of Biogen, including options, which 
would be worth more than $40 million.
