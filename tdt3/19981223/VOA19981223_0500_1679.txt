There is a group, in the state of Michigan, we want to tell you about 
this morning. It's opposed to what it calls "frivolous law suits." 
And it has put together a list of what it calls "wacky warning labels." 
Now this group is called Michigan Lawsuit Against Abuse Watch -- that 
is Michigan Lawsuit Abuse Watch -- and its president says unnecessary, 
obvious warning labels are a sign that manufacturers are extremely 
worried about being sued by people who misuse their products. Or, 
they're concerned about people who are incredibly stupid. Incredibly 
stupid. Well, this year, for the second year in a row, the organization 
released some of what it judges is the wackiest of the warning labels. 
One of them is a prescription pill, or off hands on a bottle of prescription 
sleeping pills. And, it warns that the drug might cause sleepiness, 
duh. What's the point? Yea. Another one on the list goes to a fireplace 
lighter. It cautions against using the devise near fire, flame, or 
sparks, duh. And there is a cartridge for a laser printer with a warning 
label that says not to eat the toner inside the cartridge. Just in 
case you get a little hungry while you're sitting there whacking it. 
Well, in the middle of the night, you know. Pounding away on the computer, 
yes. All right. Michigan Lawsuit Abuse Watch has selected a warning 
label on a folding baby stroller as the wackiest of wacky warning 
labels. The warning reads, "Remove your child before folding the baby 
stroller." You know, sometimes I do forget to do that, yes. You leave 
that poor baby right in that stroller, so... What were you telling 
about the wacky world... Oh yes. We were putting in an air conditioner, 
one time there -- just putting in a window air-conditioner. And, there's 
a label on the air-conditioner that says," Do not drop out window." 
Thank you very much. I'll try not to.
