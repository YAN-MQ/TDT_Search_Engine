Imagine a new communications technology: It is not necessarily secure, 
it requires people to leave their desks to use it and delivery can 
take days. Oh, and large attachments cost extra. The technology is 
called a letter and, for the forerunner of the United States Postal 
Service, it was the ``killer app'' of its time. But that was 200 years 
ago. Today, in the face of technologies like fax machines and electronic 
mail, the Post Office is fighting for its piece of the information 
age. The service is in the midst of making a hard self-examination, 
and establishing pilot programs across the country, that could significantly 
change the face of postal delivery in this country within the next 
several years. In August, when Postmaster General William J. Henderson 
announced the formation of the new Postal Service Technology Group, 
he said the goal was to ``enable us to accomplish our aggressive vision 
of an information rich mailstream within the next five years.'' So 
who is supposed to help wrest the wheel of the postal stagecoach from 
the mud in which it has been mired? Among them are Norm Lorentz, whom 
Henderson named as the service's first chief technology officer, and 
Robert Reisner, the postal service's vice president of strategic planning. 
``What is a 21st century Postal Service?'' is how Reisner puts the 
question he sees in front of him and his colleagues. For now, the 
Postal Service's vision of itself in the future is not purely digital. 
It is more along the lines of a hybrid service, straddling the worlds 
of physical and electronic communication. At the outset, Reisner dismisses 
any notion that the world will be a place where all reading takes 
place on screens. ``There is no way in the next decade you won't need 
paper, he says. Already, as part of a five-year plan begun in September 
1997, the Postal Service has undertaken a variety of pilot projects 
aimed at realizing a post office for the future. PostOffice Online, 
for example, allows small businesses to purchase products and coordinate 
shipping through the Internet 24 hours a day. Although similar services 
exist, the Post Office is hoping to draw customers through what is, 
effectively, one of the best known brand names in the country. The 
post office is also thinking about creating ``electronic postmarks'' 
_ a postal time/date stamp that can be printed on mailing labels and 
envelopes with a laser printer. This would serve in place of a traditional 
postal meter for small businesses and private citizens. The Service 
is also testing programs that function purely electronically. Post 
ECS (Electronic Courier Service) is a system that makes the transmission 
of attachment files over the Internet more secure. Similarly, Certificate 
Authority verifies a sender and receiver through private electronic 
``keys'' on the Internet. There is also discussion of the Post Office 
creating an Internet domain for non-profit, educational, government 
and individual addresses. Creating this future presents formidable 
challenges. Customers _ especially businesses _ are already opting 
for digital delivery systems. Electronic banking, alone, poses a substantial 
threat to the Postal Service's revenues. Some 38 billion pieces of 
first class mail per year_ representing revenues of about $6 billion 
_ are directly threatened by such banking, according to a recent Postal 
Service report. That is about a third of the Postal Service's overall 
mail volume, and about a fifth of its revenues. (Despite the rise 
of Spam _ unsolicited Internet mail _ the Postal Service reports that 
their Class A advertising mail, better known as a junk mail, remains 
stable). How successful is the Postal Service likely to be in its 
efforts to catch up? No one can say. Undeniably, it is off to a late 
start. ``The Postal Service is a government agency,'' said B. Alexander 
Henderson, a senior technology analyst for Prudential Securities. 
``Of course they are going to be late.'' Nevertheless, Henderson said, 
the service ``should be applauded'' for its moves to modernize. He 
predicted that some steps, like electronic postmarks, could appeal 
to the 90 percent of small businesses without their own postage meters 
and could create a substantial market in support products. Moreover, 
this is not the first time the Postal Service has faced a monumental 
transition. Similar periods of technological change have occurred 
since Benjamin Franklin was the first Postmaster General. Everything 
from steamboats to balloons to ponies have been employed to transport 
mail. In 1959, a Navy submarine even fired a missile containing 3,000 
letters in an effort to increase delivery speed. But creating new 
services to compete these days is a huge technological and organizational 
challenge, ``given the bureaucracy that we are,'' said Lorentz. And, 
as a government organization, he added, the Postal Service must get 
permission for any major changes it wishes to makes. ``We have a lot 
of owners,'' he said.
