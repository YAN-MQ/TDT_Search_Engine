A Malaysian court has dismissed a law suit filed by former Deputy 
Prime Minister, Anwar Abreheen, who claimed he was illegally fired 
by Prime Minister Mahaathir Mohamad. The suit was rejected by the 
high court in Kuala Lumpur, today. Mr. Anwar's lawyers had argued 
that Mr. Mahaathir violated the constitution by failing to consult 
with the king before firing Mr. Anwar. The former deputy Prime Minister 
was fired in September, and is now facing charges of corruption and 
sexual misconduct.
