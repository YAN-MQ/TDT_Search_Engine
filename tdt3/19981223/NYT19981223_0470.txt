The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 24: How 
earnest and public-minded it sounded when tobacco company executives 
warned early this year that the attempt to jack up cigarette prices 
through the pending national tobacco bill would inevitably lead to 
smuggling and a black market. No less than Steven Goldstone, the chairman 
of RJR Nabisco, warned that it was virtually impossible to stop a 
determined batch of smugglers, given that 14 million cigarettes can 
fit into a single truck. Goldstone called it ``irresponsible'' to 
ignore the smuggling that neighboring countries had experienced when 
they raised cigarette taxes. Well, now it turns out that Goldstone 
assuredly was right about the dangers of smuggling. The only problem 
was, he pointed his finger in the wrong direction. This week a marketing 
subsidiary of his own company pleaded guilty to criminal charges and 
paid a $15 million fine for actions that enabled others to smuggle 
cigarettes into Canada. The scheme was hatched after the Canadian 
government raised tobacco taxes in an effort to cut smoking. Those 
taxes applied only to cigarettes sold in the Canadian market, not 
to exports. So cigarettes were shipped from a Reynolds plant in Canada 
to the United States where the guilty Reynolds subsidiary aided the 
filing of false statements that they were to be shipped on to Russia 
and Estonia, a maneuver that exempted them from taxes in both Canada 
and the United States. In reality, the cigarettes were sold to distributors 
in New York. The subsidiary has admitted only to customs violations, 
not smuggling. But in truth, says U.S. Attorney Thomas J. Maroney, 
the subsidiary knew that the cigarettes were destined to be smuggled 
back into Canada, in this case through an Indian reservation in upstate 
New York. RJR Nabisco says it ``very much regrets'' the episode and 
calls its subsidiary's actions ``inconsistent with the way Reynolds 
does business.'' It has closed the subsidiary and is taking steps 
to prevent a recurrence. But the apologies seem a bit late. The tobacco 
industry has long been accused of looking the other way when it comes 
to smuggling. Now we know it is even worse. The shame of this episode 
is that a subsidiary of America's second-largest tobacco company actually 
joined the criminals.
