A former high school wrestling star in Connecticut has pleaded no 
contest to reduced charges in the second rape case against him. Under 
a plea bargain, alex Kelly will get no additional prison time added 
to the 16-year sentence he's already serving for rape. Kelly was charged 
with raping two teenage girls in 1986, but fled the country before 
trial. He surrendered in Switzerland in 1995.
