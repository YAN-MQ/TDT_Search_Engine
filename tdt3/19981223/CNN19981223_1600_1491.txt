When the original "secret of nimh" came out in 1982, apparently, they 
didn't tell you everything. 16 years later, MGM/ua home video is releasing 
"the secret of nimh II: timmy to the rescue" as a direct-to-video 
title. The tape is on the market now, in time to fill any empty stockings 
that show up later in the week. This is Dennis Michael with the "Hollywood 
Minute."
