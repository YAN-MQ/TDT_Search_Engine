The Security Council, struggling to rebuild the fragile unity among 
members that was shattered by the American and British bombing raids 
in Iraq last week, met Wednesday to thrash out a statement broadly 
outlining a policy toward President Saddam Hussein. After several 
hours of closed-door talks, the council agreed to defer further formal 
discussion until next week. ``I think there is a sincere wish from 
all delegations to agree on a text,'' Hans Dahlgren, the Swedish representative, 
said after the meeting. ``But it won't be today.'' Russia is expected 
to produce another version of its proposed draft of the policy statement 
on Thursday, after the introduction of new ideas by the United States. 
President Clinton's administration wants to tone down the role Russia 
would propose for the secretary general, among other changes. ``Some 
of these amendments are helpful; some of these amendments are going 
contrary to the initial goal of this presidential statement,'' said 
Yury Fedotov, Russia's deputy representative. ``Russia wants a very 
clear statement, which would express the view of the majority of the 
Security Council,'' he said, ``and which would say basically three 
important things, which are: the Security Council is in charge and 
the Security Council is in favor of a political settlement of international 
crises; two, that the secretary general must continue to play his 
important and meaningful role in this crisis, and three, we have to 
determine what has to be done in order to resume the implementation 
of the Security Council resolutions on Iraq.'' Both sides appear ready 
to call a high-level meeting of the U.N. Special Commission. The commission, 
known as UNSCOM, was originally a panel of experts sent by various 
nations to work out a disarmament plan for Iraq in 1991, after the 
Persian Gulf War. When the process went on much longer than expected, 
the part-time commission had to hire a permanent staff _ the weapons 
inspectors under Richard Butler who have been working full time on 
Iraq. The commissioners now meet only periodically as an expert board, 
with Butler as executive chairman. By calling a meeting of the higher-level 
commission, the Security Council hopes to defuse to some degree the 
tension over Butler and his day-to-day inspection and monitoring teams, 
which have now been barred from Iraq by Saddam's government. The move 
could also save the commission. The United States wants it and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency recognized as the sole judges of 
Iraqi compliance with a 1991 council resolution on disarmament. Under 
the resolution, Iraq must be declared free of nuclear, biological 
and chemical weapons as well as certain missile systems to qualify 
for a lifting of sanctions. Iraq says it meets the test. Butler says 
it does not. On Wednesday, China joined Russia in calling publicly 
for Butler's dismissal. Shen Guofang, China's deputy representative, 
told reporters this morning that Butler ``should go.'' Iraq, apparently 
unchastened by last week's air strikes, on Wednesday made the U.N.'s 
work a little more difficult by barring all of its flights into the 
country. The Iraqis turned back a plane carrying military observers 
based along the Kuwaiti border. They also refused to allow Secretary 
General Kofi Annan's special envoy, Prakash Shah, to fly out of Iraq. 
He had to make a 12-hour trip by road to Amman, Jordan. The Iraqis 
told Annan that it was unsafe to fly because British and American 
air maneuvers continued over the country.
