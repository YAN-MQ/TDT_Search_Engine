NEW YORK _ ``The Nutcracker'' can take many surprising forms. But 
the best of them remain tributes to good cheer. An especially pleasant 
reinterpretation is ``The Harlem Nutcracker,'' in which Donald Byrd 
choreographically transplants the action from 19th-century Germany 
to 20th-century New York. Tchaikovsky's music undergoes its own metamorphosis, 
for the production is set to the jazz arrangements Duke Ellington 
and Billy Strayhorn made of some of the familiar tunes and to additional 
music composed and arranged by David Berger. ``The Harlem Nutcracker'' 
returned to New York when Donald Byrd/The Group opened a two-week 
run of it Tuesday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Byrd's company 
has been augmented by guest dancers and singers, including members 
of the New York Ellington Gospel Choir and the Creative Outlet Performing 
Arts Program. The Club Sweets Jazz Orchestra, conducted by Berger, 
provided rousing accompaniment. Unlike most productions in which Clara, 
the heroine, is a little girl, Byrd's Clara is a widow and a grandmother 
who at a family party has a vision of her deceased husband and travels 
back in memory with him. The longest stop on their journey is a Harlem 
nightclub of the 1930s, and its floor show allows Byrd to poke affectionate 
fun at cabaret acts. While chorus-lines strutted, a brassy gum-chewing 
Cigarette Girl (amusingly played by Theresa Howard) occasionally wandered 
among the customers. Leonora Stapleton was a torrid Sugar Rum Cherry 
(this version's equivalent of the Sugar Plum Fairy). Stephanie Guiland 
and Brian Brooks showed fine comic timing as they portrayed colossally 
vain dance partners. And there was boisterous jitterbugging. Just 
as a good traditional ``Nutcracker'' is more than a diversion, so 
``The Harlem Nutcracker'' is not merely a spoof. The key to the ballet's 
significance lies in the way its first-act party pays tribute to the 
warmth of family and friends. The more imposing celebrations in the 
second act thereby become glorifications of the spirit of conviviality. 
Eduardo Sicangco's sets and Gabriel Berry's costumes for the Harlem 
version made the party in the parlor cozy and the club appear bright. 
Both parlor and club became fun places to be. The party was attended 
by children and grownups who, in characterization, ranged from nice 
to naughty. But no one grew too naughty and everyone looked like someone 
interesting to know. The gentlest of these people were Clara and the 
Ghost of Her Husband, as played by two guest dancers: Eleanor McCoy, 
a former member of Dance Theater of Harlem, and Gus Solomons Jr., 
a notable choreographer in his own right. Byrd has been dramatically 
daring in his scenes for them for, in addition to remembering a nightclub, 
they relive turbulent moments from black history. Not every image 
is equally powerful. Nevertheless, the sequences indicate that ``The 
Harlem Nutcracker'' has serious implications. This may also be the 
only ``Nutcracker'' in which Clara suffers what looks like a heart 
attack and which is at least a case of severe heart palpitations. 
And an allegorical figure of Death keeps reappearing. Usually, Ms. 
Howard is cast in the role. But, at the conclusion, Death proved to 
be Solomons, this theatrical surprise suggesting that the love of 
Clara and her husband is eternal. By having love ultimately prevail, 
the choreography proclaims joy to the world. The handsome production 
has been made possible, in large part, by the sponsorship of Aetna 
Inc., and Byrd thanked Aetna in a curtain speech. His ``Harlem Nutcracker'' 
continues through Jan. 3 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette 
Ave., Fort Greene.
