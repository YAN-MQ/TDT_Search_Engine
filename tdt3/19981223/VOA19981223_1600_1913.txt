Here in Washington, U.S. National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, 
has warned Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, that U.S. forces are ready 
to strike, again, if he tries to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction. 
Mr. Berger said the U.S. has an obligation to strike, has the will 
to do so, and has the forces ready to attack. Mr. Berger said the 
air strikes on Iraq, last week, weakened Saddam Hussein, and the Middle 
East safer.
