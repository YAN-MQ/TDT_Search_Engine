In a related story, the Nike athletic wear company says it will not 
pay NBA players endorsement contracts as long as the labor lockout 
continues. A company spokeswoman says that the company believes the 
current labor dispute, between players and owners, is hurting the 
fans and the game. The spokeswoman says the company does not want 
to damage its relationship with the players, but Nike has to make 
common sense business decisions. Some agents have said Nike should 
hold money from the league as a sign of good faith. However, the company 
has made no such decisions.
