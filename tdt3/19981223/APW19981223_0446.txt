SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO's top commander for Europe, American 
Gen. Wesley Clark, warned Wednesday of escalating violence in Serbia's 
turbulent Kosovo province. ``We are watching the situation very closely 
and we are seeing increasingly aggressive Serb military and police 
activities,'' Clark told reporters after meeting Macedonian authorities 
in the capital, Skopje. NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Europe 
said these activities were ``not in conformation with the promises 
made by the Yugoslav government'' and that the matter causes great 
concern for the international community. ``We are calling on all parties, 
including the (Kosovo) Albanian parties, to refrain from violence,'' 
Clark said after his meeting with Macedonia Prime Minister Ljubco 
Georgievski. Clark reiterated that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
and top military commanders in Belgrade have been told they ``must 
comply with their promises made to NATO.'' Clark flew to Macedonia 
from Brussels on a brief visit to the alliance's 1,800-strong Extraction 
Force, deployed here for the purpose of rescuing unarmed international 
monitors in Kosovo, should they come in harm's way. Two months ago, 
Milosevic pledged _ under the threat of NATO airstrikes _ to reduce 
his government troops in the southern Serbian province that borders 
Macedonia and allow deployment of unarmed peace verifiers in Kosovo. 
But a continuing spiral of violence threatens to unravel Kosovo's 
tenuous October truce. ``I came here to visit the facilities ... and 
also to thank the Macedonian government for its very warm hospitality 
and support for the NATO mission,'' Clark said. He was due to inspect 
NATO's Extraction Force facilities in the northern town of Kumanovo 
and visit about 500 American soldiers. The Americans are part of a 
UN mission deployed in Macedonia since 1992 to prevent the conflict 
within former Yugoslavia from spreading to the vulnerable area. Macedonia 
seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991 _ the only former Yugoslav republic 
to do so without bloodshed. It joined NATO's Partnership for Peace 
Program in 1995.
