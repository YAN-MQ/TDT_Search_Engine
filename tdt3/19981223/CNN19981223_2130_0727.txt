Coming up -- the information superhighway has become a convenient 
marketplace for musicians and music bootleggers. And that's creating 
a whole new technology for fans everywhere. That and top stories, 
after the break. I will remember you will you remember me in December, 
every minute you talk on AT&T will mean an AT&T donation don't let 
your life to the American red cross. The more calls you make, pass 
you by... the more help we can give. And I will remember you this

out to those who need it most. Will you remember me bold yet very
