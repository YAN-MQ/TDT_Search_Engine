U.S. defense secretary William Cohen has ordered the withdrawal of 
some american troops from the Persian gulf. Between 8,000 and 9,000 
troops will leave the area. Some of the deadliest U.S. bombers will 
depart, as will the aircraft carrier "enterprise." Cohen says enough 
troops will remain in the gulf to thwart any offensive by iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein. Cohen is visiting officials and U.S. troops today 
in Kuwait and Saudi arabia.
