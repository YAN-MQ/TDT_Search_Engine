It was the era of the British invasion, the summer of love and a war 
that divided the country. Now it's a mouse click away. The '60s are 
what's "on-line." Whether you're a nostalgic baby boomer or just a 
student of the '60s, you'll find plenty of groovy stuff at a site 
set up by the University of Virginia library's special collections 
department. "The psychedelic '60s: literary tradition and social change" 
offers a Kaleidoscopic overview of the era that broke all the rules. 
The site shows off the library's impressive collection of period artifacts, 
from Woodstock to Watts. It traces the historical roots of the '60s 
back to the 19th century and the works of Ralph waldo Emerson, Henry 
David thoreau and Walt Whitman. Jump 100 years forward to poet Allen 
ginsberg and Timothy Leary, the harvard professor turned LSD promoter 
who coined the term "tune in, turn on and drop out." The sites offers 
commentaries on the music that defined and shaped the generation, 
the anti-war movement, the fight for civil rights and the women's 
lib movement. Check out the hippie handbook, as mom and pop tried 
to come to terms with their long-haired, bell-bottomed kids. The site 
features much more on that turbulent time. CNN.com will link you to 
this and other sites. That's what's "on-line."
