In South Korea, thousands of riot police have stormed a Buddhist temple 
in Seoul, ending a long standoff between rival monks. Dozens of police, 
and monks, were injured -- some seriously,-- when officers raided 
the temple. Authorities fired water cannons, and tear gas, to force 
their way into the temple, today, which was being occupied by about 
100 monks. The monks responded to the attack by throwing firebombs 
and rocks. Some of the monks also cut themselves, in protest, and 
threatened to set themselves on fire. Dozens of monks, and their followers, 
were arrested after the clash.
