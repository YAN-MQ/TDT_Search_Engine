This is Dennis Michael with the "Hollywood Minute." It's time to start 
thinking about it. The '90s are almost over. Vh1 and the hard rock 
cafe have been thinking about it. The vh1 series "hard rock live" 
is planning an early retrospective with an episode called "the best 
of the hard rock live: '90s hits." '90s musical icons hootie and the 
blowfish are the headliners. You don't have to wait till the last 
minute to get nostalgic.
