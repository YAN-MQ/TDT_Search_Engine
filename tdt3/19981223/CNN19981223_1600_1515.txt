Actor, comedian, Broadway singer -- or all of the above. Cynthia Tornquist 
checks out Martin short's latest gig. Martin short says the hardest 
thing about his role in the broadway musical "little me" is surviving 
to the end of the show. 77 so sing and dance do a trick but quick! 
I gotta die! 77 It is an amazing workout. 'cause I'm no spring chicken. 
Short plays not one, but eight characters. I love you as much as I 
am able considering we're sinking There's Noble eagleston, an overachieving 
blue blood. Amos pinchley, an 88-year-old scrooge. Otto schnitzler, 
a Hollywood director. Val DuVal, a French singer, among others. What's 
the prime boom that's sublime boom One time they shoved me off on 
stage, and they forgot to take the mustache off. I saw faith kind 
of start to laugh, and I went like this, and I knew the mustache was 
there. I went, "well, how lucky that I have my electric finger with 
me," you know, and took it off. And with this show, you can do -- 
you can say anything, or improvise anything. "little me" seems tailor-made 
for short, who made his name in the '80s on "sctv" and "Saturday night 
live" creating characters such as Ed grimley, later seen on the cartoon 
network. Me, Ed grimley, hosting my own special on the cartoon network. 
Yet Martin short has done relatively little musical theater in the 
last 20 years. He began performing in musicals in Toronto during the 
1970s, but spent most of the '80s and '90s working in television and 
films such as "the three amigos." Only recently has short returned 
to the stage, in a production of "Promises, promises" last year, and 
in 1993 in "the good-bye girl," a Musical version of Neil Simon's 
1977 film. So let's keep improvising Neil Simon, who also adapted 
"little me" for sid Caesar in 1962 has reworked the material for short. 
The humor has gotta be sharper, and I think it is a lot sharper now. 
Next fall, short returns to television with a late-night talk show. 
In the meantime, Martin short can be found on Broadway in "little 
me," running through February 7th. Cynthia Tornquist, "CNN Entertainment 
News," New York.
