Erin Oates didn't buy any Christmas presents this year. She doesn't 
expect to get any from Santa, either. It's not that Ms. Oates, 40, 
a public-relations professional who lives on Manhattan's Upper West 
Side, is a Scrooge. Or that she was too naughty to make Santa's list. 
She wants it this way. Instead of hauling a garbage bag full of gifts 
for her nephews home to Mississippi this year, Ms. Oates will take 
a video camera. Fresh from the pain of her grandmother's death at 
91 earlier this year, she and her brother plan to spend Christmas 
interviewing their parents, 66 and 69, to capture the story of their 
lives and their love. ``I wouldn't call myself a religious person,'' 
Ms. Oates said, ``but there's a beautiful, spiritual aspect of the 
season. When the focus is all on what you're getting, that gets lost.'' 
Not that you could tell from the crowds of shoppers on Madison Avenue, 
or even the new studies pegging the average amount spent on holiday 
gifts at nearly $1,000 per family, but Ms. Oates is part of a growing 
though still small movement of people, in New York and around the 
country, who have simplified their celebrations of Christmas and Hanukkah. 
For some, it is about cutting back to save money and avoid debt. For 
others, it is an environmentally conscious effort to reduce the reams 
of wrapping paper clogging landfills. For many, it reflects a deeper 
cultural shift, as they struggle to redefine the season not as one 
of sales but of sharing, replacing stress with serenity. Jill Gerken 
and her boyfriend, John Wodnick, high school teachers who live in 
Montclair, N.J., spent last weekend making ornaments out of pine cones 
with his family. Renee Fogarty, a mother of two in Yorktown, organized 
people on her block to put a basket of food, in secret, on the steps 
of the house of an elderly neighbor each day this week. Virginia Peckham 
of Port Chester, made books combining cartoons she drew of her stepgrandchildren 
with funny things the children have said as gifts for their parents. 
At Debbie Steinke's family gathering in Queens on Christmas Eve, each 
person plans, in lieu of gifts, to share a favorite holiday memory. 
``There's more fun, there's more time, and there's more meaning,'' 
said Betsy Taylor, director of the Center for a New American Dream 
in Takoma Park, Md., which distributed a brochure about simplifying 
the holidays this year. Ms. Taylor has reduced the number of presents 
she gives her two children, stopped gift giving among the adults and 
turned Christmas dinner into potluck. The family has also established 
new traditions for itself: having the youngsters decorate shoeboxes 
filled with useful gifts to take to homeless shelters and creating 
a special play for everyone to perform on Christmas Eve. ``I have 
not one time been asked, `What am I going to get for Christmas?''' 
Ms. Taylor said. ``But I have been asked 10 times, `What's the play 
this year?' '' A poll commissioned by Ms. Taylor's group found that 
44 percent of Americans said they felt pressure to spend more than 
they could afford during the holidays, and only 28 percent said the 
season leaves them feeling joyful. Those polled said 1 of every 3 
hours during the holiday season was devoted to activities that made 
them feel ``stressed or uncomfortable.'' Four out of five said they 
would prefer a photo album of their childhood to a store-bought gift. 
``We are a nation of self-storage units because we can no longer fit 
in our houses all the stuff that we own,'' said Bill McKibben, author 
of a new book, ``Hundred Dollar Holiday,'' which joins ``Simplify 
Your Christmas: 100 Ways to Reduce the Stress and Recapture the Joy 
of the Holidays'' by Elaine St. James as documents of a trend. ``When 
it started, we were very pious, and thought that it was about the 
environment, what a waste of stuff and batteries and things, and all 
this money should go to poor people,'' said McKibben, 38, who lives 
in Johnsburg, in the Adirondacks. ``Really, it was about the fact 
that too many people had come to dread the approach of Christmas at 
least as much as we anticipated it. We wanted to figure out how to 
make it more fun.'' Hence the Alternative Gifts Catalog (www.altgifts.org), 
where people can buy a pig for a farmer in Laos or a bicycle for an 
orphan in Haiti, neither of which have to be stored in their apartment. 
``The rush to buy Christmas gifts is a kind of unholy thing that we 
engage in every year,'' said Harriet Prichard, founder of Alternative 
Gifts, which raised $970,000 for charities around the world last year. 
``This becomes really a self-sustaining gift that multiplies.'' But 
in the capital of commercialism, the quest for simplicity is complicated. 
People are busy. Galley kitchens are not conducive to homemade jam. 
And all those sparkling lights and shiny bows beckon from store windows. 
``It might be a little harder to do this in New York,'' Ms. Taylor 
acknowledged. ``People from all over the world go to New York to shop. 
Everywhere you step, you're bombarded with the message: buy this, 
show your love through this gift.'' Indeed, Ms. Peckham's repeated 
attempts to start a ``simplicity circle'' of people trying to downshift 
have fallen apart; next year, she is moving to Maine. Linda Fingerson 
of the Upper East Side is a member of such a support group, but said 
``the degree to which I've simplified anything is not very much.'' 
``It's murder, especially in this season, when everything's out there,'' 
said Naomi Kavish, an electrologist who lives on the Upper West Side 
and has committed to cutting back, decreasing her debt and saving 
for retirement. ``It's a lot of fun, but what happens is you get caught 
up, and before you know it, you've spent hundreds of dollars that 
you didn't intend to spend, so you spend the rest of the year catching 
up.'' Ms. Kavish, 58, has always given her daughter, 21, a separate 
gift for each of the eight nights of Hanukkah, plus one whopper at 
the end. This year, she shopped only with cash so as not to exceed 
her budget, avoided impulse buying by waiting a week between spotting 
and buying gifts and cut the price tags on her daughter's presents 
in half. ``I told her, `There's not going to be Hanukkah,' then I 
said, how can I take the holiday away from her?'' Ms. Kavish said. 
``Last year, it was two CD's. It was nuts. Now it's like, enough, 
one is good.'' People with young children find it more challenging 
to cut back. But Julius Adams, who lives in Rego Park, Queens, said 
he buys his sons small gifts, toys they can play with together. The 
family also gives money to the children's library at their synagogue, 
where the boys spend a lot of time. ``To us, simplification is not 
you get rid of everything; it's scaling down and deciding what's important,'' 
said Adams, a consultant who works at home. ``To me, it's if you're 
much calmer about your life.'' That's why Ms. Fogarty puts ``Recycled 
gifts only'' on her boys' birthday invitations. And why Claire Mayer, 
68, of Morristown, N.J., is giving her son a quart of homemade soup 
each week for a year. Now, Reine says, he has time to select thoughtful 
gifts instead of grabbing items at the last minute. He ordered 200 
copies of the Center for a New American Dream's brochure ``Simplify 
the Holidays'' to hand out in his neighborhood.
