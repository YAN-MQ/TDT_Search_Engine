Belgium's highest courts have found former NATO Secretary, General 
Billy Class, guilty on corruption charges, and have given him a three-year 
suspended sentence. John Frasier in Brussels reports Class was among 
a number of senior Belgium politicians and officials who were convicted, 
in what's been dubbed, "Belgium's trial of the century." The charges 
date back to the late 1980s when Belgium's Dutch and French-speaking 
socialist parties were paid bribes in return for awarding two defense 
contracts, each of which was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Both socialist parties were members of a country's coalition government. 
A bribe of $1.4 million was given for a contract for 46 helicopters, 
from the Italian firm Agusta. There was also a $1.6 million bribe 
to secure an order for an MT Radar System, the Belgium's F-16 jet 
fighter bombers, from the French firm, Dessau. At the time Claus was 
Economics Minister in approving both of the contracts. Clause always 
denied the charges. But, he was forced to resign from his top NATO 
job, in October of 1995, when it became clear that he faced prosecution. 
Other politicians convicted, include the former head of Belgium's 
French speaking socialist party, Espitaus, who went on to become president 
of the French Region of Belgium. And, there was a guilty verdict for 
former Belgium Defense Minister, Etoum, who went on to become deputy 
Prime Minister, until he too, was forced to resign from political 
life. Etoum has already been found guilty of a separate corruption 
charge, involving the commissioning of bogus opinion polls, which 
were funded by the Belgium government. French businessman, Serge Besso, 
who paid one of the bribes to the Belgium politicians, was also convicted. 
Spitaus, Etoum, and Besso, each received a two-year suspend jail sentence. 
There also was suspended sentences of up to two years for eight other 
Belgium officials, who were found guilty in the same trial, which 
began in September. John Frasier, for VOA News, Brussels.
