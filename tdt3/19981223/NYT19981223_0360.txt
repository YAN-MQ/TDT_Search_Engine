The three-man crew of the ICO Global Challenge became the first balloonists 
to cross the Asian continent from one end to the other on Wednesday, 
and the first to fly over the towering Himalayan range. During the 
sixth day of their attempt to circle the world nonstop, Richard Branson, 
Per Lindstrand and Steve Fossett completed their worrisome crossing 
of China and expected to reach Japan before midnight EST Wednesday 
night, and thence the Pacific Ocean. As their balloon left the Asian 
mainland at about 29,000 feet it entered a wind system bearing the 
craft eastward over the Yellow Sea at nearly 90 mph. The crew relaxed 
after confronting a series of crises. At the last moment Tuesday, 
when it was too late to alter course, China barred the balloon from 
entering Chinese airspace, but in the succeeding hours, during which 
the crew feared that Chinese fighters might shoot them down, diplomatic 
efforts on behalf of the aeronauts prevailed. Wednesday morning the 
balloon crossed the Chinese coast at a leisurely 47 mph. Mike Kendrick, 
the balloon's operations director in Uxbridge, England, said in a 
telephone interview that the balloon's acceleration to nearly 90 mph 
shortly after it left China was especially welcome in view of various 
delays the balloon had encountered. Guided by their meteorologists 
and ground team, Branson's crew had to deal with Libya's initial refusal 
to grant overflight permission, dodge dangerous thunderstorms over 
Turkey and thread a complicated course avoiding Iraq, Iran and Russia. 
Completing a safe trip over Afghanistan, India and Nepal, the balloonists 
found themselves over China, where new problems awaited them. ``Our 
mission team has calculated that we've had an average of 2.6 crises 
per day since the launch last Friday from Marrakesh, Morocco,'' Kendrick 
said, ``and now we deserve some good luck.'' But despite detours imposed 
by diplomatic, military and weather complications and despite a greater 
than expected consumption of propane fuel for the balloon's hot-air 
burners, the successful completion of a global circumnavigation ``has 
not been ruled out,'' Kendrick said. ``I'm looking forward only one 
segment at a time,'' he said. ``Now that we're past China, we're looking 
toward the 5,000-mile flight across the Pacific _the most dangerous 
segment of the round-the-world journey.'' Fast jet-stream winds over 
the ocean could carry the balloon to North America's west coast by 
Christmas Day, he said, ``but bad weather east of Japan is kicking 
up 15-foot waves _ terrible conditions if the balloon should be forced 
down.'' Fossett, the American member of the British crew, has made 
four previous solo attempts to circle the world, during the most recent 
of which, starting from Mendoza, Argentina, he flew about 15,200 miles 
_ a record. That attempt ended on Aug. 16 when a violent storm hit 
without warning, ripping his balloon and plunging his unpressurized 
capsule into the Coral Sea about 500 miles east of Australia. The 
crash was the closest shave ever for Fossett, a wealthy 54-year-old 
commodities broker, yacht racer, long-distance swimmer, Iditarod dog 
racer, mountain climber and balloonist. After the crash and his rescue 
by a passing yacht, he said he was not sure he would ever attempt 
a transglobal balloon flight again. But when Branson, his former main 
competitor, offered him a berth on the ICO Global Challenge a few 
months later, Fossett quickly accepted.
