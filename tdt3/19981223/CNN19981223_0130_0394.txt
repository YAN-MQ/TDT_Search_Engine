The world is reaching out to victims of hurricane Mitch, but a lot 
of those relief supplies aren't reaching their final destination. 
Susan Candiotti explains why. In Miami, at least 3 million pounds 
of food, clothes and medicine remain piled high, frustrating world 
relief's Miami coordinator Steve kabick. We need to get this stuff 
down there. It isn't doing us any good here. "down there" is Honduras, 
Nicaragua and other parts of central america hit hard by hurricane 
Mitch. The biggest problem we've had is just transportation -- getting 
the stuff moved here from Miami into the countries that need the help. 
Because of the holidays, space on freighters and planes has been limited. 
Also, the Pentagon says "operation desert fox" forced the cancellation 
of a Couple of disaster relief airlifts. World relief and other charities 
are scrambling to get donations moving. We want to get this all packed. 
The picture is a little brighter at Catholic charities, where a Prearranged 
disaster plan has helped move donations. By the time we're finished, 
we will have moved over 4 million pounds. Volunteers continue to sort 
and move out items sent from as far away as Minnesota. The pace is 
expected to pick up after Christmas. One Miami-area clothing manufacturer 
donated 30,000 of these holiday-decorated cotton sweatshirts. Obviously, 
some things will be more practical than others for people living in 
tropical heat, but organizers say anything that cannot be used in 
central America will be sent somewhere else. It's bad because you 
don't have what you need. Which is why 10-year-old Joey Latham is 
volunteering. It's just nice to know that people that need it more 
than I do -- they can have what they need. Susan Candiotti, CNN, Miami.
