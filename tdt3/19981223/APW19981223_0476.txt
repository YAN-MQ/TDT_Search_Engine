Austrians received an early Christmas present from their president 
Wednesday _ a new first lady. After weeks of speculation as to when 
and where Thomas Klestil would marry his former aide, Margot Loeffler, 
the president surprised Austria with an unannounced private ceremony 
Wednesday at Vienna City Hall. In the past few weeks, speculation 
as to where Klestil and Loeffler would marry was the talk of Vienna's 
tabloids. Wednesday's ceremony was not disclosed in advance and no 
guests attended, the Austria Press Agency reported. The couple's relations 
have been widely published, since Klestil's former wife, Edith, walked 
out of the presidential palace on New Year's Eve 1993 after 40 years 
of marriage. It was rumored that Klestil's relationship with Loeffler 
had caused the breakup. Nevertheless, the president won a second six-year 
term in the largely ceremonial post last April, defeating four challengers 
with 63 percent of the vote. In September, he finalized his divorce. 
The 44-year-old Loeffler first met Klestil in the 1980s and later 
worked as his office manager during his first two years in office. 
In 1994, she transferred to the foreign ministry. Klestil, 66, is 
a career diplomat widely credited with helping restore Austria's credibility, 
which was damaged by the controversy over the Nazi German wartime 
service of his predecessor, Kurt Waldheim.
