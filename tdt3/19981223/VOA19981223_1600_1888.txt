Iraq has banned U.N. weapons flights into the country, four days after 
the end of the U.S. and British air strikes. U.N. Special Envoy, Shah 
Prakash, had to leave Baghdad, Wednesday by road. An Iraqi foreign 
ministry official told the French news agency, the action was taken 
to protect their flights from Iraq's anti-aircraft defenses, which 
are still on alert for possible further attacks by U.S. and British 
forces.
