Heavy-duty vehicles have long been powered by Diesel engines. They're 
simple, fuel efficient and major polluters. But a Canadian company 
says it's developed a cleaner option. Rick Lockridge reports in this 
edition of "tech trends." Diesel engines do the world's heavy lifting. 
Durable but dirty, they exhale a sooty breath that poisons the air. 
But this bus, despite the Diesel engine in the back, has given up 
its dirty habits and is now living the clean life -- converted to 
natural gas. At the present moment, we have a very big atmospheric 
pollution concern. So we feel we have a very good product to step 
into an existing market on a Short-term basis. What Westport innovations 
has is a patented way to turn a Diesel-burning engine into one that 
Burns almost all natural gas, while using just enough Diesel to start 
the all-important combustion cycle. The Westport conversion kit contains 
sophisticated injectors, which handle both Diesel fuel and natural 
gas at the same time. Other components store the natural gas at the 
high pressures necessary for efficient burning. Since natural gas 
is generally about 30% cheaper than Diesel fuel, Westport says bus 
lines and truck companies can recoup the cost of each $20,000 kit 
in just a couple of years. And the company says converted engines 
emit only about half the pollutants of conventional diesels. It's 
a very easy way to get a very clean technology out as quick as possible, 
because -- basically, because it's so simple. a converted Westport 
bus is already shuttling college students around Berkeley, California. 
How does this thing handle? It handles real good, real good. I get 
a better ride out of this one because you get more power, especially 
on the takeoff. Westport hopes nations under pressure to meet the 
1997 Kyoto protocol clean air standards will turn to its technology. 
The company believes it can eventually capture almost a third of the 
$70 billion global Diesel engine market. Rick Lockridge, CNN.
