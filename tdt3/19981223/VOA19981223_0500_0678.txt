Supporters of Paraguay's former army commander, retired General Lino 
Sasa Oviedo, have curtailed public transportation, and thrown bombs 
at the Supreme Court building. VOA correspondent, George Meek, in 
our South American bureau says, "They just demand the resignation 
of Phass. The Supreme Court judges were trying to send General Oviedo 
back to prison." Most busses in Asuncion went on a one-day strike 
in support of General Oviedo. But, army trucks offered rides to workers 
so government and private offices could function normally. Demonstrators 
burned tires and set off bombs outside the Supreme Court building, 
shattering some windows. The protesters pelted police, firefighters 
and passersby with stones and bottles. A military court sentenced 
General Oviedo, in April, to 10 years in prison, for attempting the 
coup in 1996, a charge that he denies. Opinion polls indicate he would 
have easily won the presidential election in May, had he not been 
in jail. His running mate, Raul Cubas, won in his place and promptly 
pardoned the general. Three weeks ago, the Supreme Court ruled, in 
a five-four decision, that the pardon is unconstitutional. President 
Cubas refused to accept that decision. He says the Supreme Court has 
no authority to restrict the executive branch's prerogative to grant 
pardons. Mr. Cubas says only a military tribunal can reconsider the 
case. One of the Supreme Court Justices, Alli Shano Ayana, says the 
protests are an affront to the judicial system and the justices will 
not resign. General Oviedo has said that if they do not, there will 
be indefinite protests, starting next week. George Meek, VOA News, 
Rio de Janeiro.
