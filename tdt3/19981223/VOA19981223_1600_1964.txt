The Palestinian authorities released Islamic militant leader, Shahak, 
Yadnuseen, from two months of house arrest. The founder of the Hamas 
was put under restrictions following an anti-Israeli bomb attack by 
Hamas, after the Y River Peace Deal. The Palestinian officials said 
the house arrest was ended as a good will gesture, because of the 
Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Two weeks ago, Hamas militants warned 
they would resume attacks against Israel, if their leader was not 
freed by December 25th.
