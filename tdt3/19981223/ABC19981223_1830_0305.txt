In California, freezing temperatures are having a devastating effect 
on the citrus crop. The cold snap may have already destroyed nearly 
all the state's lemon crop and more than 20% of its naval oranges. 
Here's ABC's Lisa Salters. For Rod radtke, a third generation citrus 
farmer, the holiday season will not be a happy one this year. The 
damage has been done. It can't be undone now. Five straight nights 
of below-freezing temperatures, in the teens and low 20s. Almost all 
of radtke's 2,500 acres of naval oranges have been destroyed, an estimated 
$7 million loss. Radtke is not alone. Throughout the San Joaquin valley, 
the heart of California's $1 billion citrus industry, farmers are 
fighting to save their lemon and orange crops, by building fires to 
keep the trees warm and using wind machines to keep the warm air circulating. 
So far, it's been a losing battle. That combination will save us maybe 
three, four degrees of temperature, but if it gets as low as 20 to 
23 degrees, we might as well shut it off and go home. And though farm 
officials say it is too soon to estimate the extent of the losses 
industrywide, the bottom line for consumers is that supermarket prices 
for citrus fruit will likely double. The current price of 39 cents 
to 49 cents per pound may be going to 89 cents to 99 cents per pound. 
But farmers are already paying the price. Even if the cold weather 
unexpectedly breaks today, one farmer told me, the crop losses here 
would still be catastrophic. Lisa Salters, ABC News, Fresno, California.
