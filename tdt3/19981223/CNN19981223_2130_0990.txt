First there were LPs. Then CDs. Now there are MPs. MP3s, to be precise. 
As Mark Scheerer tells us, this high-tech gadget is putting a new 
spin on the music industry. The walkman of the future is here. And 
boy, does it have some people worked up. It's a portable mp3 player, 
and mp3 is a format for compressed music that you get off a PC or 
off the Internet. College kids with access to high-speed modems have 
been swapping songs over the Internet ever since the mp3 technology 
arrived. And now, with the Rio player, they can go mobile. The recording 
industry association of America has tried -- so far, unsuccessfully 
-- to keep the Rio player off the market. And they've just announced 
an initiative to try to stop the digital bootlegging of copyrighted 
music via the Internet. I will get down on my knees Among established 
music stars like jewel and hootie and the blowfish, there's varying 
degrees of concern over mp3's impact on their livelihoods. I'm not 
too worried about it in the long run of things. And I have plenty 
of money. I'm okay. You know, it can hurt the artist. And it's not 
just a money issue, but it's a control issue, you know, being able 
to control what you put out and market it properly. It's creating 
opportunities, however, for unsigned musicians, through web sites 
like mp3.com, where they can offer their music for sample or sale. 
What they're really doing is trying to use the Internet as a radio, 
in effect, a 100 million-person radio as a way for them to broadcast 
their music and, you know, alert new fans to their music. Major retailers 
we contacted were reluctant to speak about the digital future. Other 
opinions are divided. If you're buying music over the Internet, what 
will you be buying from the cD retailer? I don't think the CD retailers 
go away. I think that if record labels and artists use the Internet 
effectively, there'll actually be a greater demand for CDs. Mp3 and 
its related hardware, the Rio player, can safely make this statement 
-- some people get so scared at the sound of a revolution Mark Scheerer, 
"CNN Entertainment News," New York.
