When darkness comes to this city, you can hear the clatter of security 
gates rolling down on rows of storefronts, the sound of the streets 
fortifying themselves for the night. Unconsoled by recent drops in 
reported crime, store owners in New York City continue to seal their 
investments each night behind the riot-proof shields that first appeared 
in great numbers during the late 1960s. The persistence of this riot-proofing 
is a sign that retailers, like old generals, are still stubbornly 
fighting the last war. But a new type of gate that is now becoming 
more widespread is the perfect addition to the streetscapes of Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani's safer but sterner New York. Until recently security 
gates came in two styles. The most impenetrable are fabricated from 
solid steel or aluminum plates, blank slates for graffiti that can 
intimidate after-hours passers-by. The second common type, metal grilles, 
are preferred by better business groups because they allow illuminated 
displays to light the sidewalk and invite innocent nighttime use of 
the streets, but these open gates risk raising merchants' fears of 
broken glass. The new security shutters, marketed under names like 
Screenguard and Steelvision, are made from the same materials as the 
strongest solid shutters, but punched through with a tight offset 
grid of circular holes that admit the window-shopper's gaze without 
weakening a store's defenses. By combining lock-down security with 
an accommodating veneer, these gates reflect the mood of a city where 
crime has been reduced, but at a cost to public freedom; they say 
``welcome'' and ``beware'' with equal volume. Jerry Raimondo, a manager 
at City-Gates Manufacturing Corp. in Queens, New York City's largest 
security gate company, said their Screenguard brand perforated gates 
are chosen primarily because they offer increased security. ``With 
grille gates,'' he said, ``a car can pull up, throw a chain around 
it and pull it off.'' The perforated metal gates offer no purchase 
for such break-ins, and they also prevent vandalism, litter and the 
free passage of vermin. Despite their ability to combat so many quality-of-life 
bugaboos, Raimondo said the perforated gates remain ``extremely rare.'' 
They represent ``much less than one percent'' of the roughly 100 gates 
his company installs each day. ``That kind of gate is an acquired 
taste,'' he said. One retailer who has acquired the taste is Debra 
Lachance of Area I.D., a new mid-century modern furniture store on 
Elizabeth Street in Little Italy. She says that design alone determined 
her choice of a gate from Century Overhead Doors in Brooklyn. Lighted 
from behind, the gate's close-set holes throw a moire screen over 
her store. ``The concept was to make it look like an optical illusion,'' 
she said. ``We wanted to create a certain mystery.'' Other storefronts 
with the new gates appear disproportionately in design-conscious areas 
of Manhattan: an eyeglass store on Seventh Avenue in Chelsea or a 
shoe store on Broadway in Soho, for instance. But because the perforated 
metal shields suit the spirit of the new New York, merging maximum 
protection with cold politesse, they may also soon find homes elsewhere 
on less posh shopping streets. Dan Pisark, director of the Retail 
Improvement Department of the 34th Street and Grand Central Partnerships, 
is enthusiastic about the possibilities for perforated gates in his 
district. Since 1996, he has managed a program to promote open gates 
along shopping streets in midtown Manhattan. The program offers to 
pay up to 50 percent of the cost of replacing a solid gate, but it 
has not swayed many store owners: only five of the 28 solid gates 
along 34th Street have been replaced, Pisark said. ``Some retailers 
are still of the opinion that as soon as the sun goes down, it is 
not safe,'' he said, ``but that's just not true anymore.'' Frustrated 
by resistance on the street, the 34th Street Partnership is promoting 
a top-down legislative solution. Tom Duane, an outgoing New York City 
Council member, is among the sponsors of a bill, currently pending, 
that would mandate 75 percent transparent gates along 34th and 42nd 
Streets, from river to river. While he has not yet seen any of the 
perforated metal gates, he is optimistic about their ability to make 
the streets more welcoming after dark. ``As someone who is out and 
about at night, having more opportunities for window shopping can 
only improve street life,'' he said. ``It makes it safer. It's good 
for the stores. It's good for the streets.''
