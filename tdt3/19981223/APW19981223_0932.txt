Government forces and UNITA rebels continued fighting Wednesday in 
the central highlands further undermining a 1994 peace pact, while 
reports indicated that the army had taken control of two rebel-held 
towns. In Huambo province, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast 
of the capital Luanda, ``battles rage all over the place,'' according 
to an aid worker, who asked not to be identified. ``The government 
has retaken Vila Nova and has a firm grasp of Caala,'' the aid worker 
said, referring to two towns approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) 
from Huambo city. The resumption of fighting this month has sent more 
than 50,000 displaced people flooding into Huambo, about half of the 
existing population. Stores in the city were empty because the harvest 
had been destroyed by the fighting and the roads leading into the 
city were unpassable, the aid worker said in Luanda, adding that the 
airport was under military control but closed to commercial flights. 
The United Nations' World Food Program is planning to fly about 300 
tons of food supplies into Huambo over the next two weeks. Another 
aid worker, speaking from Huambo on condition of anonymity, said Namibian 
troops were flewn into Huambo two days ago. The government had denied 
rebel claims that Zimbabwe and Namibia have sent troops to support 
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Meanwhile, UNITA rebels continued 
their two-week-long siege of the city of Kuito, capital of neighboring 
Bie province some 130 kilometers (80 miles). An International Red 
Cross statement said there were 160 wounded, some in serious condition. 
The center of Kuito _ which was hit Tuesday by rebel artillery shells 
_ was quiet Wednesday, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Bie told state 
radio, RNA. The United Nations brokered a 1994 peace agreement between 
the government and UNITA, but festering friction led to renewed clashes 
in the diamond- and oil-rich country. In a statement released Wednesday 
in Luanda, the government condemned the U.N. for its ``passivity and 
complicity'' in face of UNITA's ``constant violations'' of the 1994 
accord. The statement said instead of disbanding its rebel forces 
as it agreed in the 1994 pact, UNITA _ the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola _ has built up a 40,000-strong army equipped 
with ``armored vehicles, long-range artillery and great fire power.'' 
The U.N. envoy to Angola, Issa Diallo, said Wednesday he understood 
the government's disappointment that the accord had not been fully 
implemented but that negotiation was still the key to peace. ``We 
must think the solution to Angola's problem is compromise, peace, 
and dialogue,'' he said in an interview broadcast on state radio. 
``It's the most expensive way, but one we must insist on,'' he added. 
The U.N. spent dlrs 1.3 billion on implementing the 1994 accord and 
at one time had 7,000 international peacekeepers stationed in the 
vast nation. Civil war between the government and UNITA broke out 
in 1975 following the vast southwest African country's independence 
from Portugal. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the following year when 
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi rejected his defeat in the country's first 
elections and returned to war.
