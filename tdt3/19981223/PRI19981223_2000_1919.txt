The national disaster committee in Kenya has almost finished distributing 
financial aid to those hurt in the August bombing of the U.S. embassy. 
Kenyans donated nearly $4.5 million to the fund, and it's gone to 
3,000 claimants. Kathy Jenkins reports from Nairobi. There have been 
cases where committee members wished they could have given more. For 
example, a man who spent several days trapped in the rubble of a collapsed 
office block in the end received only the $500 payment. The committee 
is to set a precedent in Kenya by publishing audited accounts showing 
how it shared out the public donations. This will be important to 
many Kenyans who, because of the levels of corruption in their country, 
are often very skeptical about where their money goes once it leaves 
their hands. Kathy Jenkins, BBC News, Nairobi.
