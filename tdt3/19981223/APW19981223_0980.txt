Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov acknowledged Wednesday that serious 
problems were hampering Russia's relations with the former Soviet 
republic of Azerbaijan, Russian news agencies reported. After meeting 
in Moscow with his Russian counterpart, Azeri Foreign Minister Tofik 
Zulfagarov said his government was concerned by Russia's military 
and technical ties with Armenia, Azerbaijan's neighbor and rival, 
and by Russian-Azeri differences over how Caspian Sea oil should be 
transported, the Interfax news agency said. Azerbaijan favors a route 
through Turkey, while Russia is pressing for a route through its own 
territory. The U.S. government has been lobbying for the Turkish route, 
which it considers a way of developing east-west oil and gas transportation 
corridors in Central Asia, avoiding Russia and Iran. Ivanov said that 
Russian-Armenian cooperation is based on international law and ``is 
not aimed against Azerbaijan,'' Interfax reported. Ivanov pledged 
that Russia would do everything possible to resolve the problems in 
bilateral relations, Interfax said.
