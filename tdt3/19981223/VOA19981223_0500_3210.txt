Fifteen years ago, four-college buddies of the University of Vermont, 
formed the band called "Phish." It's spelled P-h-i-s-h, although it's 
pronounced like the animal -- the mammal, I should say, fish. Yea, 
whatever. Whatever. They've been described as being similar to the 
"Grateful Dead." Now this is what it's all about. Unlike the Dead, 
Phish is an underground band, one that built a hugely successful career 
without ever having a big hit record. But, as we hear from VOA's Catherine 
Cole now, the new Phish album, "The Story of the Ghost," might change 
all that. For years, critics have said that while Phish can draw thousands 
of fans to concerts, their studio album sounded boring, when compared 
to the live shows. So, Phish decided to take the best of the new songs 
they're performing, in concert, trim them a bit, and then record them 
in the studio. That gives "Birds of a Feather," the feel of a live 
jam session. That is "Birds of a Feather" from the new Phish album, 
"The Story of the Ghost." This studio version captures the feel of 
a live Phish concert and helps you hear why so many Grateful Dead 
fans have adopted Phish as their new favorite band. The song, "Giudi,", 
is another Phish "fave" to make the transition from live show to CD. 
"Giudi" of the new Phish CD, "The Story of the Ghost." It's quite 
typical of the sound that's made Phish a hit with so many college 
and post-college-age Americans. But, the band also brings a few new 
ideas to this record. The song "Brian and Robert" features some harmonies. 
To my ears, it's like the Beach Boys singing "Pink Floyd." That's 
"Brian and Robert" off the latest Phish CD. With nine albums under 
its belt, the band, Phish, seems on the verge of breaking into the 
mainstream. But, long-time listeners shouldn't be afraid that success 
will hurt the group. Guitarist Trey Anastazio has been quoted as saying, 
"It's too late for commercial success to ruin us." I'm Catherine Cole.
