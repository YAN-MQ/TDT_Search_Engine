The Washington Post says none of the U.S. Senate's 45 democrats is 
currently willing to convict President Clinton on two articles of 
impeachment in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The paper says preliminary 
inquiry shows no certain democratic votes to convict Mr. Clinton, 
and strong support for some alternative punishment. Their report also 
says a dozen of the Senate's 55 republicans have been discussing censure 
in an apparent move to avoid a long Senate trial. Meanwhile, the White 
House continues to search for interest in Congress for a way to avoid 
placing an impeached president Clinton on trial in the Senate, for 
covering up his relationship with a former White House intern. Correspondent 
Nick Smeone, at the White House, reports one Senate democrat says 
such a deal may close at hand. The White House has been hoping law 
makers can reach a compromise that would spare the nation, what could 
be, additional months of lengthy, and perhaps embarrassing testimony, 
about the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. As he was 
leaving budget talks, at the White House Tuesday, democratic senator, 
Christopher Dodd, told reporters an agreement that most senators could 
support, may be close. And, that the next few days will be critical. 
What seems to be emerging, in my view, is that there are not the votes 
to convict this president for impeachment. There are the votes to 
censure this president. That seems to be a bipartisan consensus that 
is emerging. If that is the case, and it appears to be, then it seems 
to me it's in the best interests of the Senate to move to that result, 
sooner, rather than later. White house spokesman, Jule Lockhart, says 
the fact that several republicans in the House of Representatives, 
say they favor censure rather than placing the president on trial 
in the Senate, is a positive sign that members of Congress want to 
put this matter behind them. Nick Smeone, VOA News, at the White House.
