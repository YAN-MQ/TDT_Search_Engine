Russian Prime Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, says it will be up to the 
United States to repair relations with his country in the aftermath 
of last week's U.S. led air attacks against Iraq. But, Mr. Primakov 
told reporters in Kazakhstan today, that a return to cold war relations, 
between east and west, is not possible. Moscow fiercely denounced 
the bombing campaign, against Iraq, as a violation against United 
Nations' rules, and recalled its ambassadors to Washington and London, 
for consultations. The Kremlin envoy to the United States is returning 
to his post, today. Russia's foreign ministry says its representative 
to London will return to his mission on Saturday.
