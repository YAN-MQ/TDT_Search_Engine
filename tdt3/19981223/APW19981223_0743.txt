The United States and Russia signed a dlrs 625 million food aid agreement 
Wednesday after months of negotiations, clearing the way for deliveries 
of American food to prevent hunger among Russia's needy. The United 
States will donate 1.5 metric tons of wheat to Russia free of charge, 
and provide another 1.5 metric tons of various agricultural commodities 
under a long-term loan. An additional 100,000 tons of various foodstuffs 
will be distributed directly to Russia's poor. The aid will be arriving 
``over the next several months,'' said John Tefft, deputy chief of 
mission at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, who signed the deal along with 
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik. No specific date has 
been set for the start of the deliveries. But officials have said 
the aid is likely to start arriving early next month. Russia's current 
economic crisis, coming on top of the worst grain harvest in 40 years, 
has spurred serious worries about food shortages during the winter. 
Plenty of food has remained in stores so far, but inflation that has 
soared since the crisis hit in August has put much of the food out 
of the reach of impoverished Russians. Russia's cash-strapped government 
also worries about its ability to deliver food to far-flung northern 
regions. Much of the U.S. food aid is to be sold in stores in those 
regions, with revenues going to Russia's pension fund to help pay 
off many months' backlog of pensions, Tefft said. ``This hopefully 
will make food purchases somewhat less burdensome for those older 
Russians who have been particularly hard hit by the current financial 
crisis,'' he said. Previous aid deals have been tainted by corruption, 
and the work on the latest agreement has stretched out for two months 
as the United States insisted on working out guarantees that the aid 
will be used properly this time. The agreement follows Russia's sharp 
criticism of the United States over last week's bombings of Iraq, 
when President Boris Yeltsin and other top officials used angry rhetoric 
unheard since the end of the Cold War. Kulik said Wednesday that he 
didn't think Russia should have turned down food aid because of the 
dispute. ``It was never said anywhere publicly that this should become 
a hurdle to the development of economic, cultural and other ties that 
for many years have connected our two countries,'' he told reporters.
