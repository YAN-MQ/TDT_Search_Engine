Surgeons may some day treat brain tumors and heart ailments with the 
click of a computer mouse. Washington University neurosurgeon Ralph 
Dacey used a pioneering magnetic surgery technique to direct a biopsy 
needle to the brain tumor of a 31-year-old man. The Dec. 17 biopsy 
at Barnes-Jewish Hospital indicated the man needed chemotherapy. The 
Magnetic Surgery System will be tested on four other brain tumor patients 
over the next several months, Dacey said Tuesday. Several years of 
trials will likely be necessary before the procedure is commonly used. 
Dacey and officials with Stereotaxis Inc., which helped develop the 
system, believe it will help in getting surgical tools _ and perhaps 
medicine _ to hard-to-reach areas of the brain and the heart. They 
say it may eventually help treat aneurysms, coronary artery disease 
and other ailments. For a traditional biopsy, a surgeon would manually 
push a rigid needle via a long, narrow catheter through the brain 
to the tumor. Magnetic surgery allows the catheter to follow curved 
routes, bypassing sensitive areas of the brain, or travel along blood 
vessels to or near the heart, Dacey said. Surgeons around the country 
said the procedure appears promising. ``I just think this is a better 
way,'' said Warren Selman, professor of neurosurgery at Case Western 
Reserve University in Cleveland. ``I think part of our problem is 
getting around structures that are in the way,'' Selman said. ``The 
ability to steer around an object instead of merely go through it 
is an exciting development.'' In magnetic surgery involving a brain 
tumor, a small hole is drilled in the patient's skull. The surgeon 
places a plastic bolt in the hole to provide entry for a guidewire 
with a magnet that travels through a catheter about the width of a 
strand of spaghetti. The surgeon views magnetic resonance images (MRIs) 
of the patient's brain on a computer screen. The three-dimensional 
view allows him to plan the best route to the tumor. The patient's 
head is placed in a machine between superconducting magnets and a 
catheter is inserted through the bolt. The surgeon, sitting at the 
computer console, uses a mouse or joystick to guide the magnet to 
the tumor in about five minutes. The guidewire positioning system 
pushes the small magnet through the brain, with the fields from the 
superconducting magnets controlling its direction. When the head of 
the instrument reaches the desired area, the surgeon pulls out the 
guidewire, leaving the catheter in place to act as a tunnel. He then 
inserts a tiny surgical tool through the catheter that snips out a 
tissue sample for the biopsy. Universities and laboratories around 
the United States have been developing magnetic surgery for more than 
a decade. Trials have been previously performed on animals. Doug Kondziolka, 
professor of neurosurgery at the University of Pittsburgh, called 
the procedure very promising but said there are concerns. ``How reliable 
is this way to control something deep in the brain?'' he asked. ``For 
example, control of the magnetic field, the control and accuracy of 
the manipulation.'' Dacey said the procedure is safe, even in the 
event of a computer failure. If that happens, he said, surgery would 
be performed manually.
