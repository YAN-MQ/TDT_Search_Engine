Two state radio broadcasters were recently arrested in the Congo, 
bringing to 10 the number of journalists imprisoned in the war-torn 
Central African country, a press freedom group said Wednesday. Yvette 
Idi Lupantsha, a news anchorwoman, and Risasi Gisonga, an editor for 
the state-owned Radio-Television National du Congo were arrested on 
December 19, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said 
in a letter to Congo's President Laurent Kabila. By Wednesday, neither 
had been released. Idi is the first female journalist detained in 
the country. At least 67 journalists have been arrested or received 
death threats from the government since Kabila took power in May last 
year, the CPJ said. ``This multitude of press freedom violations demonstrates 
a blatant disregard for the most basic standards of free expression 
established by international law,'' the letter said. Both Idi and 
Risasi were accused by the government of being ``traitors to the republic'' 
colluding with the United States over broadcasting their opinions 
about a press conference held by Kabila. The CPJ said it regarded 
the journalists' arrests as violations of the U.N. Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and the African Charter of Human and People's Rights, 
both of which Congo has signed. Confronted by growing economic problems 
and a rebellion in eastern Congo that has drawn in at least six other 
countries, Kabila's military has instituted a press crackdown by jailing, 
deporting and assaulting foreign and local journalists who disseminate 
stories unfavorable to the government. Political opponents of Kabila 
have also been summarily jailed and tortured.
