The FBI is launching a full-scale investigation into how Salt Lake 
City scored the 2002 Olympic games. Some Salt Lake City committee 
members are accused of giving lavish gifts to members of the international 
Olympic committee. They include free medical care and scholarships 
for relatives. Sources tell CNN the investigation will focus on fraud 
charges and potential tax violations. Salt Lake City was selected 
to host the 2002 winter games.
