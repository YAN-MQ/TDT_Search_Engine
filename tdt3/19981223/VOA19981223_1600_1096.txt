National Basketball Association Commissioner, David Stern, says if 
a labor dispute with players cannot be resolved soon, he will cancel 
the rest of the season. In an interview, with Fox Television, Stern 
said that he would love to sit down and negotiate with union head, 
Billy Hunter. However, if no talks are held, Stern says, he will have 
to call a meeting of the NBA Board of Governors to discuss canceling 
the season. Stern needs permission of the Board of Governors to cancel 
the season. The team owners locked players out of team facilities, 
beginning in July, because players' salaries were out-pacing revenues. 
So far, two months of the regular season have been canceled. The All-Star 
game has also been called off, and players have lost hundreds of millions 
of dollars in salaries.
