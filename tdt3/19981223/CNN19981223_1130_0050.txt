A touch of the North Pole is here, and it's not even Christmas yet. 
Frigid Arctic air has spread across the nation. Though ski resorts 
in the Rockies and elsewhere are welcoming extra snow, at least 29 
traffic deaths in Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and oklahoma are 
blamed on the weather. A white Christmas came early for folks in Ohio, 
making driving difficult. The quick change in seasons has hit many 
parts of the country like a bucket of ice water. In Texas, the Mercury 
plunged 40 degrees in just a matter of hours. Instead of sunscreen, 
it's scarves and parkas. In the northeast, the national weather service 
says it's a new record for lack of snow in Buffalo, New York. The 
city got it's first dusting of the season yesterday. Usually by now, 
Buffalo has been covered at least once.
