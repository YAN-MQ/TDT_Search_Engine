The FBI says it has found a car belonging to a man they want to question 
in the shooting death of a doctor who performed abortions. Authorities 
say James kopp's car was found in the parking lot of Newark international 
airport in New Jersey. They say the car had fake license plates. Kopp 
has been named as a material witness to the October killing of Dr. 
barnett slepian. Police say he's not a suspect. He is the focus of 
a manhunt. We do know, we have information that puts James kopp here 
in the area on october 18th 19th, 20th, and 21st. We do not have information 
that can tie him in on the 22nd. The shooting took place on the 23rd. 
We're trying to get the public's help, and anyone who might have seen 
him then, who may have seen him, who may have anything they may think 
is related during that time, we would appreciate that. Authorities 
say kopp is an anti-abortion activist affiliated with the violent 
"army of God" group.
