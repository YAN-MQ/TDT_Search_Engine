Not since the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran has U.S. territory 
been so egregiously invaded as last week _ and nobody in the distracted 
Clinton administration seems to care. In Damascus, where the Syrian 
dictator Hafez Assad rigidly controls the populace, tens of thousands 
massed in protest, ostensibly about our bombing of Iraq. A selected 
part of the mob _ about 1,000 drawn from the ruling Baath Party _ 
was permitted to march at night where demonstrators are never allowed 
to go: through the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood, where the U.S. 
Embassy and the ambassador's residence are located. Assad's mobsters, 
chanting ``down with America'' and bringing large stones for the occasion, 
shattered windows and breached the outer defenses of the embassy. 
The U.S. Marine guards fired tear gas vainly as Syrian intruders scaled 
the walls and tore down the U.S. flag. Unhindered by Assad's police, 
the mob then smashed the windows of the residence of U.S. Ambassador 
Ryan Croker. The dictator's supporters destroyed the ambassador's 
car, broke into the residence and rampaged through the ground floor 
smashing everything in sight and terrorizing his wife, Christine, 
who fled upstairs to take refuge in a locked ``safe haven'' room that 
shielded her from flying glass and intruders. Then the mob withdrew, 
having expertly carried out its assignment, and stoned the British 
Embassy on the way home. ``Large demonstrations are rare in the Syrian 
capital,'' wrote the AP stringer, ``which is under tight security 
control, and today's marches throughout downtown could not have occurred 
without government approval.'' Here's proof of Assad's complicity: 
Film crews accompanied the invaders of our territory and Syria's official 
television proudly showed the rapacious triumph. What was the response 
of the U.S. government to this outrage against our diplomats and their 
families, our territorial sovereignty and our embassy flag? ``Demarche-mallow,'' 
as one State Department hand privately mocked our feeble reaction. 
Croker lodged a formal protest; Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering 
summoned Syria's representative to listen to a stern lecture; and 
Syria's foreign minister, pretending the demonstration was spontaneous, 
offered his regrets. After getting $1.4 billion to harden embassies 
against terrorists, doesn't anybody at Foggy Bottom want to secure 
embassies against mobs sent by dictators? Is a striped-pants complaint 
the most we can do in the face of such provocation? Doesn't Madeleine 
Albright understand that State's pusillanimous response broadcasts 
the weakness of American will? ``I all but called the Syrian ambassador 
a liar to his face,'' Pickering told me. ``We did get a public expression 
of pseudo-apology. We demand and expect full compensation, which may 
amount to a half-million dollars. The Syrian police, in our view, 
joined the mob. This is not a trivial or a passing matter.'' But State's 
response has been trivial; not even a recall of ambassador or suspension 
of relations in the face of state-sponsored terrorism. The rest of 
the Arab world fully understands what signal Assad was sending them: 
he, and not Saddam Hussein or Yasser Arafat, is the central actor 
in the region, and is unafraid of twisting the U.S. paper tiger's 
tail. Assad's message to the White House is also unmistakable: Pay 
attention to me. He despises Arafat and cannot abide the nine days 
of attention given him at Wye, plus the presidential visit to Gaza. 
He hates Saddam, too, and the new prestige conferred on him by Clinton's 
pinprick-plus air strikes. Because he considers himself snubbed and 
his Golan Heights claim marginalized, Assad escalates Hezbollah attacks 
on Israelis in Syrian-occupied Lebanon and trashes the U.S. Embassy 
in Damascus. Reached in Raleigh, N.C., an indignant Senate Foreign 
Relations Chairman Jesse Helms said: ``This is where Clinton has brought 
us. There's no respect for this country anymore. But the Senate won't 
sit on its hands about this.'' He plans hearings on the Damascus break-ins, 
perhaps in conjunction with Armed Services, when Congress convenes.
