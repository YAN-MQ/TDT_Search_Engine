A leading French industrialist and a former secretary-general of NATO 
were among 12 defendants convicted by Belgium's highest court Wednesday 
on corruption charges involving two military contracts in the late 
1980s. Serge Dassault, 75, head of the French defense concern Dassault 
Aviation, was convicted of authorizing payment of 60 million Belgian 
francs, or $1.76 million, from the Electronique Serge Dassault subsidiary 
to the Socialist parties in the Dutch- and French-speaking parts of 
Belgium in 1989 in exchange for a $192 million contract to equip Belgian 
F-16 jets with new electronics. He received a two-year suspended sentence. 
Willy Claes, 60, who resigned as secretary-general of NATO in October 
1995, was found guilty of charges that in 1988, as an official of 
the Socialist Party in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, he authorized 
the acceptance of $1.37 million in kickbacks from an Italian helicopter 
manufacturer. He received a three-year suspended jail sentence, the 
maximum demanded by the prosecution, and was barred from holding office 
for five years. The court also found the former defense minister of 
Belgium, Guy Coeme, 52, and deputy prime minister, Guy Spitaels, 67, 
both Socialist officials, guilty of receiving bribes from Dassault 
and gave each of them two-year suspended sentences. Eight other Belgian 
party officials were also convicted of various other corruption charges 
and received suspended jail terms of up to two years each. The penalty 
for Claes was the maximum under Belgian laws that until recently had 
permitted corporations to make ``donations'' to political parties, 
a common practice in the freewheeling world of military contracting 
before 1989. Dassault had long refused to go to Belgium to answer 
questions from investigators but attended the trial in Brussels, protesting 
his innocence, and left after Wednesday's verdict. The only payments 
he knew about, he testified, were $1.76 million that his since-deceased 
mother had been tricked by Belgian swindlers into sending to a Swiss 
bank account. But the court found that $1.76 million in payments by 
Dassault had insured that the electronics contract went to the French 
company instead of to the main rival bidder, Litton Industries of 
the United States. Prosecutors picked up the corruption trail after 
Andre Cools, a Socialist leader in French-speaking Belgium, was murdered 
in Liege in 1991, purportedly for a share of bribery money from the 
Italian company Agusta SpA. Claes was Belgium's economic affairs minister 
in 1988, when Agusta received a $353 million contract to supply 46 
A-109 helicopters, winning against bids from French and German competitors. 
He became secretary-general of NATO in September 1994, but the Belgian 
Parliament voted to lift his parliamentary immunity from prosecution 
in October of the next year and he resigned, insisting he was ``totally 
innocent'' of charges that he had approved a $1.5 million kickback 
from Agusta to the party. But the Belgian court ruled Wednesday, ``It 
is not excluded that prior to awarding the contract he gave his assent 
to his chief Cabinet aide to accept the offer made by Agusta.'' Claes 
said Wednesday that he would appeal to the European Court of Human 
Rights in Strasbourg, France.
