Following is a statement Wednesday by Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the 
House Republican whip, about the impeachment of President Clinton 
and prospects for a Senate trial, as provided by DeLay's office: I 
am reluctant to make statements regarding the impeachment process 
now that it is in the hands of the Senate. However, after watching 
events unfold over the past few days I thought it was imperative to 
shed some light on some misinformation being batted around by the 
media. First, as majority whip in the House it is my job to count 
votes. I can tell you with great certainty that a censure resolution 
would have failed in the House. The Democrats' resolution was too 
weak, a Republican resolution would have been viewed as too strong, 
and the White House will never negotiate in good faith. Any resolution's 
chances of passage were minuscule at best. Second, as we saw in the 
House, without any review of the evidence it is premature to be talking 
about a deal or short-circuiting the process. There are reams of evidence 
that have not been publicly aired and are only available to members. 
I make these remarks with the utmost respect for the members of the 
Senate, but these are uncharted waters for the Senate and the complexity 
of the situation is being underestimated by some members of the media 
and the White House. The reason the House adopted articles of impeachment 
was due to the overwhelming evidence against the president. Before 
people look to cut a deal with the White House or their surrogates 
who will seek to influence this process, it is my hope that one would 
spend plenty of time in the evidence room. If this were to happen, 
you may realize that 67 votes may appear out of thin air. If you don't, 
you may wish you had before rushing to judgment.
