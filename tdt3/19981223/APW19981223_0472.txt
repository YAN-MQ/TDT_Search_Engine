Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin was freed Wednesday by Yasser 
Arafat's Palestinian Authority after nearly two months of house arrest. 
Outside Yassin's house in a slum neighborhood of Gaza City, a crowd 
of rejoicing followers surrounded the frail sheik in his wheelchair, 
kissing and greeting him. Yassin's release is likely to heighten tensions 
between the Palestinians and Israel, coming as the two sides accuse 
each other of violations of the now-stalled Wye River land-for-security 
accord. Israel has repeatedly said Arafat has not done enough to fight 
Islamic militants like Hamas, and word of Yassin's release drew new 
criticism from Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel. ``The Palestinian 
Authority has to decide whether it wants to meet its commitments to 
fight Hamas terror and move the peace process forward or turn a blind 
eye to the terrorist activities of the Hamas leadership,'' Fogel said. 
A spokesman for Hamas, Mahmoud Zahar, said the group welcomed the 
decision to free Yassin. Yassin was put under house arrest on Oct. 
29, after a Hamas activist killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt 
to blow up a bus full of Israeli schoolchildren. The attack came only 
six days after the signing of the Wye River accord. Yassin's house 
arrest, which deeply angered his following, was one of Arafat's strongest 
steps yet against Hamas. At one point, in a leaflet signed by its 
military wing, Hamas demanded his release and made a rare direct threat 
against Arafat. The radical group opposes any peace with Israel and 
has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings over the past several 
years.
