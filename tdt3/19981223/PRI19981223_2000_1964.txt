A Norwegian woman has been jailed for two days for refusing to pay 
a fine imposed for giving her son an unapproved name. Kirsti Larsen 
says she was instructed in a dream to call her 13th child Gesher, 
the Hebrew for "bridge." The local authority refused to register the 
name. Norway bans names it considers ridiculous or inappropriate.
