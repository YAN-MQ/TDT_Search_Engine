British entrepreneur Richard Branson and his teammates floated over 
northern China's ancient sites Wednesday after the government bowed 
to British appeals to let their hot-air balloon pass through prohibited 
airspace. One Chinese air traffic controller grumbled that planes 
flying between Xi'an, site of China's famed terra-cotta warriors, 
and the capital Beijing were having to adjust their flight paths because 
of the balloon. ``People don't like uninvited guests,'' said the controller 
at Xianyang Airport, near Xi'an. He refused to give his name. British 
diplomats worked late into the evening Tuesday seeking Chinese permission 
for the round-the-world balloon to continue its course. China's Foreign 
Ministry finally telephoned Britain's ambassador at about 9.30 p.m. 
(1330 GMT) to say that the balloon could carry on ``but it has to 
leave Chinese airspace as soon as possible,'' said embassy spokeswoman 
Harriet Hall. ``I'm gripping wood with both hands,'' she added when 
asked if she expected further problems for the flight. The Chinese 
air traffic controller said the balloon could be seen with the naked 
eye and on radar as it passed over the walled city of Xi'an, about 
900 kilometers (550 miles) southwest of Beijing, on Wednesday morning. 
No commercial flights were delayed or canceled because of its passage, 
he added. ``It's flying OK,'' added another air traffic controller 
in Beijing. Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand 
of Sweden, aloft in the ICO Global balloon heading eastward around 
the globe, were hoping to catch a jetstream to get them quickly out 
of Chinese airspace. ``We are going to look ... for the fastest, most 
direct route out of China, which is what the balloon wants to do anyway,'' 
said project director Mike Kendrick. China originally had given the 
balloonists permission to cross the country below 26 degrees north 
latitude. But they drifted further north Monday after navigating around 
Mediterranean storms and closed airspace over Iraq, Iran and Russia. 
The Chinese then asked the balloonists to land in Lhasa, the Tibetan 
capital, but the balloon overshot the airfield. As it became apparent 
that the balloon would inevitably cross into unauthorized Chinese 
territory, Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a message to Chinese Premier 
Zhu Rongji asking for China's help. ``Thank you to the Chinese government,'' 
Branson said upon hearing that China had finally granted permission 
for them to continue their flight. ``We are embarrassed to have entered 
the airspace without permission and relieved that they understand 
our position.''
