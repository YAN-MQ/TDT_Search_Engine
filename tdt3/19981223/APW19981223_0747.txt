Iraq ordered the United Nations on Wednesday to a cancel a scheduled 
flight of military observers who monitor the cease-fire and demilitarized 
zone on the Iraq-Kuwait border, a U.N. official said. Iraq offered 
no explanation for its decision, which was likely to increase tensions 
with the United Nations. The U.N. official, who spoke here on condition 
of anonymity, said he hoped the measure was temporary and that the 
United Nations was pursuing the matter with Iraq. In New York, U.N. 
spokesman Hiro Ueki said: ``Iraqi authorities notified the United 
Nations they would not allow U.N. flights in Iraq under the present 
circumstances. We don't know why.'' Ueki said Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, had planned to fly out of Baghdad 
on Wednesday but instead traveled by road to the Jordanian capital, 
Amman.
