Sources tell CNN that more than a dozen house republican moderates 
who voted for impeachment are expected to come forward in the days 
ahead to urge the Senate not to remove President Clinton from office. 
Republican representative Bob franks of New Jersey is urging support 
for a Bipartisan censure resolution if the president acknowledges 
he lied under oath. Our legal analyst Roger Cossack says the censure 
momentum is growing. Censure seems to be the way this is going now. 
The senators apparently do not want a trial. There's the proposal 
that says let's count noses, and if there's not enough votes to convict, 
let's censure. The Senate takes up the impeachment matter when it 
returns to work January 6th.
