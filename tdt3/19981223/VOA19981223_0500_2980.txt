Elsewhere, Australian shares fell slightly. But, New Zealand stocks 
rose after the government released very positive third-quarter gross 
domestic product numbers, showing the country emerging from recession. 
The economy grew seven-tenths of one percent after two straight declining 
quarters. Steven Topless of VTLX Browning, Wilmington, says, the uptake 
was fairly widespread in the economy. It was driven by an export expansion, 
which filtered through into the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. 
I guess, you do need to be aware that we had a drought the first half 
of the year, which distorted our growth profile, somewhat. In part 
of the bad spec that we saw in the third quarter was actually a bad 
spec from the week quarters associated with that drought. Growth and 
exporting industry has helped offset week activity in industries dependent 
on the domestic economy, such as construction.
