A ruling party member of Singapore's parliament had an unwelcome visitor 
while enjoying a quiet Sunday home with the family _ a meter-long 
(yard-long) crocodile. Mohamad Maidin Packer, who is also Parliamentary 
Secretary for the Ministry of Mohamad Education, called the police 
when the animal wandered into his yard, state-run TV reported. A total 
of ten men _ police and animal handlers _ restrained the crocodile 
and took it to a zoo. Singapore's Primary Production Department was 
investigating. The escaped animal was believed to be a neighbor's. 
It is illegal in Singapore to keep wild animals without a license, 
the report said.
