A power struggle over Buddhist leadership in south Korea turned violent 
again today when police raided a monastery. Wayne Gray reports. The 
raid on the Buddhist monks headquarters in the south Korean capital 
began early Wednesday. Hundreds of police, supported by water cannons, 
stormed the monastery, and met fierce resistance from the monks inside. 
As police moved in, rocks and bottles rained down. This was the third 
clash between the monks of the chogay order and the police, who tried 
twice before to serve a court order demanding the monks leave the 
building. The dispute began when monastic leader song wol-Ju announced 
that he would seek a third four-year term. Opponents say that would 
violate a rule limiting the chief monk to two terms. Song originally 
argued that his first term shouldn't count, since it was interrupted 
by south Korean military rule in the 1980s. Dissidents have occupied 
the monastery's five-story administrative offices on the temple grounds 
since driving out song's supporters in mid-November. Song has since 
withdrawn his candidacy for "most venerable monk," but the competing 
factions have yet to agree on how to conduct elections. As police 
stormed the grounds Wednesday, some monks tried to stab themselves. 
Others poured petrol on their bodies, threatening to set themselves 
afire. Some five hours after the standoff began, police backed by 
earth movers smashed through barricades and forced their way to the 
building. Several officers fell while trying to climb to the top of 
the back of the structure. Authorities say about 20 police and monks 
suffered injuries, some described as serious. 76 monks and their followers 
were arrested. Wayne Gray, "Headline News."
