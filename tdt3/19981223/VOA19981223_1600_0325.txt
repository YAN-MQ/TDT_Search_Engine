A move to censure President Clinton instead of removing him from office, 
appears to be gaining momentum in the U.S. Senate. But, Oklahoma republican, 
Don Nickels, says, censure is not one of the options for Senate Consideration. 
A vote is "guilty or not guilty." It's not, "I don't like those two

next month. I'm Dave Deforest, VOA News.
