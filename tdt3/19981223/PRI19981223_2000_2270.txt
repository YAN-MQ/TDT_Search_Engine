Today's geography puzzler takes you to the lush green hills of one 
of England's most beautiful counties. Pick up one of the many Thomas 
Hardy novels that was set here, including the "Mayor of Casterbridge," 
"Trumpet Major" or "Return of the Native," and you get a bleaker picture 
of our mystery region. This destination is a major tourist haven, 
with its pretty seaside villages. You can find here remnants of Iron 
Age forts, unique geology and one of Europe's most famous fertility 
symbols, the figure of a giant man carved into a hillside. It's known 
as the Cerne Giant. Another clue -- our location was the birthplace 
of the British Trade Union movement. And earlier this week, this sleepy 
county was awakened by a trans-Atlantic air and sea rescue operation, 
though nobody needed to be rescued. We'll tell you about that when 
we reveal the answer to our geography quiz in just a few minutes.
