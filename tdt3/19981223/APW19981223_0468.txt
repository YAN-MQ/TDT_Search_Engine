Israeli police said Wednesday they had uncovered a crime ring that 
snared couples that had illegally immigrated from Ukraine, forcing 
the women to work as prostitutes and the men to engage in criminal 
activities. Gang members working in the Ukraine were obtaining passports 
from Jewish couples who did not intend to go to Israel and forging 
them for use by other couples, said spokeswoman Linda Menuhin. When 
those couples arrived in Israel, ringleaders here would force them 
to go to work for the gang. The crime ring also fraudulently collected 
government subsidies for new immigrants, the police spokeswoman said. 
On Wednesday, police arrested a man and woman in the northern city 
of Haifa for involvement with the gang. The woman had been trying 
to flee the prostitution ring, Menuhin said. She said more arrests 
were expected. Stories about sex slavery in Israel began surfacing 
shortly after the mass immigration of Soviet Jews began in 1989, eventually 
bringing nearly 800,000 newcomers to Israel. Russian-based crime gangs 
used the influx of immigrants as a cover for sneaking in an estimated 
10,000 prostitutes over the past decade. The sex trade has grown into 
a dlrs 450-million-a year business, with women often finding themselves 
virtually enslaved by crime bosses.
