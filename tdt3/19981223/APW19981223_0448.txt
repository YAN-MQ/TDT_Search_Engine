The government has approved a military plan to recruit civilians to 
help police fight crime in Indonesia, an official said Wednesday. 
Minister of Information Yunus Yosfiah said 40,000 civilians would 
be recruited in January and would be trained in all military training 
centers across the country. He said Armed Forces chief Gen. Wiranto 
has reported the plan to a meeting of Cabinet ministers dealing with 
security and political affairs. ``The government has given its approval 
to the plan,'' Yosfiah said after the Cabinet meeting, presided over 
by President B.J. Habibie. Yosfiah said the recruits would undergo 
four-month training until April. ``Their task is to help the Indonesian 
police in safeguarding the people's environment, especially during 
the meetings of the People's Assembly,' Yosfiah said. He reasserted 
that the civilian militias would only help police instead of ``defending 
the state.'' Military chief Gen. Wiranto had suggested the controversial 
plan following near-daily protests in Jakarta and other cities mainly 
by students pressing for swifter democratic reform. Under the plan, 
as many 200,000 young, unemployed people might eventually be recruited 
for the group, dubbed ``Ratih,'' an acronym for ``Rakyat Terlatih,'' 
or trained people. They would be equipped with sticks, riot shields 
and handcuffs and will have powers of arrest. Government critics and 
human rights activists have criticized the plan to establish a militia, 
arguing that the deployment of thousands of young men in the streets 
would only exacerbate unrest. There are fears of more unrest as newly 
formed political parties jostle for influence ahead of general elections 
scheduled for June. Justice Minister Muladi has said that the government 
has drafted a law, to be submitted to Parliament next month, that 
would allow their formation. Indonesia is facing political uncertainty 
since Habibie took office in May, replacing President Suharto, who 
was forced from office by widespread protests over his 32-year authoritarian 
rule. Habibie has been implementing political reforms, but students 
say he is not moving fast enough, and some still considered his administration 
as merely continuation of his predecessor. Student have often clashed 
with security forces during rallies to demand the trial of Suharto 
for alleged corruption and the end of the military's political role.
