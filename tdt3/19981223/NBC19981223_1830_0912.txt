Of course, all this costs money, and lots of it. The department of 
defense has spent $3 billion on operations in the Persian gulf this 
year alone. It's a small fraction of the Pentagon's budget. But as 
NBC's Andrea Mitchell tells us, there's no end in sight. Every day 
the U.S. keeps its forces in the gulf to contain Saddam hussein, taxpayers 
spend at least $9 million. And when the U.S. strikes Saddam, the costs 
literally explode. Bombing Iraq does not come cheap. For example, 
each bombing run by a fighter jet costs an estimated $17,000. The 
U.S. flew 650 sorties against Iraq in "operation desert fox." That 
adds up to more than $11 million in flight time alone. Even more expensive 
-- cruise missiles. Navy ships fired 325 tomahawk cruise missiles 
at Iraqi targets last week. The cost to fire and replace them in the 
arsenal -- $715 million. And there's more. U.S. planes fired 0 air-launched 
cruise missiles at Saddam's factories and palaces. Another $270 million. 
Another costly question -- since most experts agree U.N. inspectors 
will now never get back in to monitor Saddam's weapons, have we laid 
a trap for ourselves forcing our troops to remain indefinitely? I 
think you will see a continued large commitment to the Persian gulf 
region, primarily sea and land-based aircraft. So the U.S. commitment 
in terms of military people and money is going to continue very high. 
On top of that, the diplomatic and political costs. The weapon inspectors 
are not back. Saddam is still there. Our alliances in the region and 
around the world are somewhat weaker. All things being equal, this 
was not a good investment for the United States. The administration 
insists keeping Saddam from building new weapons is worth every penny. 
Saddam has learned that we have not lost our resolve to block his 
aggressive aims. What's the bottom line? In just the time it took 
to report this story, we spent at least $12,500 to keep peace in the 
gulf. And the meter is still running. Andrea Mitchell, NBC news, Washington.
