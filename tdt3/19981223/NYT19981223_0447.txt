Four people died in the superheated, smoke-filled stairwell of a Manhattan 
high-rise building on Wednesday as they tried to escape a fire that 
started in a 19th-floor apartment where the family of the actor Macaulay 
Culkin lived. It was the second fire with multiple deaths in a New 
York City apartment building in less than a week, coming just five 
days after three firefighters were killed responding to a blaze in 
Brooklyn. Fire officials had not determined the exact cause of the 
blaze, but said they suspected that an electric heat pump in the apartment 
may have shorted out. The victims _ three women and one man living 
in apartments on floors above the fire _ were probably trapped in 
what Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen described as ``a blast of 
heat and smoke that went up the stairway like a chimney.'' The victims 
were found in a stairwell on the 27th and 29th floors, officials said. 
The man was identified as Maitiu Breathnach, 32. Officials had not 
yet been able to identify the dead women. The fatal circumstances, 
Von Essen said, were similar to those that led to the deaths of the 
three firefighters last Friday. In that case, the firefighters died 
when a fireball engulfed them as they entered the narrow hallway of 
the burning Brooklyn building. ``When we start to move in, the fire 
comes out _ it roars out, it vents itself up through the stairwells, 
then out the building,'' Van Essen said. ``And if these people were 
coming down or were trying to get down below the fire, they could 
have gotten caught in that blast of smoke and heat.'' The four-alarm 
fire was reported shortly before 10 a.m. at South Park Towers, a 51-story 
building at 124 West 60th Street with 542 apartments on the upper 
floors and medical and commercial offices on the lower 10 floors. 
As white ashy smoke poured from the window of the Culkin apartment, 
on the southeast corner of the building, residents of other apartments 
above, below and on the other side ran onto their balconies waving 
and shouting for help. The Culkin family escaped without injury. Nearly 
200 firefighters and fire trucks from 48 separate companies arrived 
on the scene. Nine firefighters were injured, most with neck, back 
and shoulder pain. Two were in stable condition at New York Presbyterian 
Hospital, where they were treated for burns on their faces and necks. 
Law enforcement officials said the blaze started in apartments 19D 
and 19E, separate units that had had been combined into one apartment. 
They said they suspected that an electric heat pump,part of a heating 
unit mounted on the wall of each apartment, may have shorted out. 
The unit from the scorched and gutted apartment was removed and will 
be sent to electrical engineering consultants for study, the officials 
said. At least one witness, observing the fast-spreading fire from 
an adjacent building, said he saw a Christmas tree on fire inside 
the apartment. The witness, Joe Libretti, an ironworker at a building 
under construction at 2 Columbus Circle, said he looked over to South 
Park Towers from his perch on the 15th floor at about 9:45 a.m. and 
saw the window of the 19th-floor apartment blast open. ``It was like 
a pop _ it cracked it and it popped,'' Libretti said. Inside the apartment, 
he added, he and his co-workers saw a Christmas tree burning. The 
fire was so intense, Libretti said, that the window frame of the apartment 
melted as the fire ``spread like a wild cat.'' Culkin's mother, Patricia 
Bentrup, lived in the apartment, as did at least three of Culkin's 
younger brothers, according to neighbors. One of the brothers, Kieran, 
has also appeared in films, including ``Father of the Bride 2.'' Macaulay 
Culkin, who gained fame with his lead role in the film ``Home Alone,'' 
lives separately from the family. Michele Bega, his publicist, said, 
``The Culkins are fine, but saddened for those who perished in the 
fire.'' Ms. Bega said she had no information on the family's whereabouts. 
Neighbors said they saw Mrs. Bentrup and some of the children, several 
of whom attend acting classes at the nearby Professional Children's 
School, in the building lobby, wrapped in blankets, shortly after 
the fire alarm sounded.
