Two Hong Kong citizens and a Malaysian kidnapped by former Muslim 
rebels in the southern Philippines were released Wednesday after 106 
days in captivity. Officials said no ransom was paid for the release 
of Law Cheung Yau and So Chi Ming of Hong Kong and Tong Ket Ming of 
Malaysia. But a military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said the men's employer paid at least 2 million pesos (about dlrs 
51,000) in ``board and lodging'' fees to the kidnappers. Hours after 
their release, the three men were flown to Manila where they met President 
Joseph Estrada, who had given strict instructions to the authorities 
to ensure their safety. ``We are happy that no untoward incident happened 
to these people,'' Estrada said. ``We are continuing our drive against 
kidnapping.'' The three were seized Sept. 8 while buying live fish 
for sale to Hong Kong restaurants near an island in Tawi-Tawi province 
close to the border of the east Malaysian state of Sabah. They were 
then brought to Sulu province and moved from town to town in the hinterlands 
as police and soldiers searched for them. The kidnappers included 
members of the Muslim extremist Abu Sayyaf group, whose leader was 
killed in a raid by police last Saturday, and former members of the 
Moro National Liberation Front, the main Muslim rebel group that had 
signed a peace agreement with the government. Negotiators led by MNLF 
chief of staff Yusuf Jikiri and Sulu Gov. Munib Estino fetched the 
victims from the kidnappers' mountain hideout outside Timbangan town, 
about 920 kilometers (575 miles) south of Manila. ``We are very happy 
that we have been released by the kidnappers,'' said Malaysian Tong 
Ket Ming. He said they were fed mainly dried fish and root crops and 
were not harmed by the kidnappers. ``The first thing I will do is 
talk to my family in Hong Kong, my mother, my father,'' said Law Cheung 
Yau. Estino said the kidnappers held the three men hostage to show 
the government that they have been ``left behind'' in receiving social 
benefits for former rebels. ``We had to explain to them the program 
of the government for development, that's why it took us many days 
for them to accept the program of the government,'' he said. The three 
men were brought to a military hospital in Zamboanga City, north of 
Sulu, for a checkup, before they were flown to Manila for the meeting 
with Estrada.
