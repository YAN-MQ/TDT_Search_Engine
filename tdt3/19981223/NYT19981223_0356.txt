NATIONAL FORECAST Ice-storm warnings were issued Wednesday for parts 
of the Gulf States as freezing rain and freezing drizzle coated trees 
and power lines from Texas eastward. The stage was set for icing once 
an Arctic front stalled across the South this week, insuring only 
a thin layer of cold air next to the ground. Ice will again glaze 
parts of the South Thursday as a thin layer of Arctic air holds steady 
and relatively warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico flows inland 
and rises over the thin Arctic wedge. The greatest risk of icing will 
extend from the Tennessee Valley to the southern and central Appalachians 
and then east to North Carolina and southern Virginia, where lifting 
of Gulf air is augmented by a pocket of strong jet stream winds. North 
of this icing zone, a stripe of light to moderate snow will fall across 
northern Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, southern New Jersey and southeast 
Pennsylvania. A dusting to two inches of snow are likely, with accumulations 
of three or four inches in the mountains and along the coast, where 
Atlantic moisture is drawn into the fray. Storminess will resume in 
the Pacific Northwest as a jet stream disturbance races inland near 
Vancouver Island. Increasing onshore winds from the Pacific will import 
ocean moisture into western Washington and Oregon, paving the way 
for rain. Heavy snow will fall in the Cascades. Snow will also fall 
across eastern Washington and Oregon, with freezing rain or sleet 
affecting areas where a deep layer of cold air retreats in the face 
of advancing Pacific air. Focus: Shallow Chill Freezing rain glazed 
Birmingham, Alabama, Thursday, as air temperatures near the ground 
hovered at 31 degrees. Yet, 5,000 feet aloft, temperatures were close 
to 50 degrees. Such a vertical variance indicates the shallowness 
of the Arctic air mass that invaded the Deep South this week. The 
caricature of the Arctic air mass resembles a wedge of cheese, with 
the thinnest part of the wedge directly behind the front that marked 
the leading edge of Arctic air. But the front stalled across the South, 
keeping cities such as Birmingham in shallow chill, which set the 
stage for freezing rain.
