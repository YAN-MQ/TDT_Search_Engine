Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa on Wednesday acknowledged a prominent 
businessman's concerns about political instability, but said the government 
would ensure a business-friendly environment. Tung was responding 
to comments by billionaire Li Ka-shing Tuesday that the political 
environment has become too unstable and hostile for business. Li announced 
that he had scrapped a 10 billion-Hong Kong dollar (U.S.-dlr 1.28 
billion) investment plan with a foreign company. His two companies, 
property developer Cheung Kong Holdings and conglomerate Hutchison 
Whampoa, led the blue-chip Hang Seng Index's slide Wednesday. The 
index fell 1.6 percent to close at 10,158.75. Speaking to reporters, 
Tung didn't directly agree or disagree with Li's comment on Hong Kong's 
political environment, but said he respected the tycoon. Tung, who 
was picked by Beijing to lead Hong Kong after it was returned to Chinese 
rule on July 1, 1997, called for harmony among disparate elements 
in the society. ``A good environment which is conducive to business 
and investment is very important to Hong Kong. That's the way to ensure 
the recovery of our economy and to create more jobs for our people,'' 
Tung said. ``A harmonious community is fundamental for the creation 
of a good, attractive business environment,'' he said. Li's comments 
Tuesday apparently were a swipe at pro-democracy politicians, who 
have recently stepped up calls for freer elections and more help for 
the city's disadvantaged as the economy slides deeper into recession. 
Only a portion of the 60-seat legislature is directly elected. In 
recent protests, pro-democracy lawmakers called large property developers 
greedy and unfeeling for demanding that would-be home-buyers who defaulted 
on pre-payments for homes honor their purchase agreements. Hong Kong's 
economy is expected to shrink by 5 percent this year, and the once-mighty 
property market has been in the doldrums.
