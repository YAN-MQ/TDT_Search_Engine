Dean Dierschow caressed his prized green and yellow British Petroleum 
marble. It is the type of scene that plays out every day and night 
in Silicon Valley, Silicon Prairie, Silicon Beach, Silicon Alley, 
Silicon Forest and Silicon Glen. The Silicon rule: the weirder the 
hobby, the more interesting the person. Dierschow, 39, knows of only 
two other people in the world who collect British Petroleum memorabilia. 
He has two BP marbles, three models of gas stations and numerous model 
cars and trucks, three decks of cards, a ruler, a key chain, a flag, 
a tie clip, a soccer ball, a credit card, a mug, a tape measure and 
the piece de resistance, a commemorative plate from the Alaskan pipeline. 
``Pretty cool, isn't it?'' said Dierschow, a game engineer at Segasoft 
Networks who says he has absolutely no connection to British Petroleum 
except that ``as a kid, my favorite color was green.'' Traditional 
business environments stress conformity and belonging to the local 
country club. Not so in geekdom, where status symbols have been reversed. 
Giving people a ``core dump'' on an esoteric topic like building a 
theremin (an obscure electronic instrument) from scratch is the Silicon 
Valley equivalent of playing 18 holes. Here it is perfectly acceptable, 
if not encouraged, to out-strange the person in the next cubicle. 
But finding originality in nerd circles takes a heck of a lot of work. 
Dressing up like Spock at your weekly Trekkie club meeting just won't 
cut it. That is why you will see Alexia Massalin, an engineer at Micro 
Unity who is widely heralded as a technical genius, giving and receiving 
piggyback rides and collecting stuffed koala bears. Jonathan Hirshon 
walks to his public-relations job in Santa Clara's Tech Center twirling 
an ebony and silver 19th-century cane, one of his collection of seven 
walking sticks. ``I rather enjoy being known as the eccentric guy 
with the cool canes,'' he said. Chris DiBona, a marketing director 
for VA Research, includes in-depth descriptions of terrorist groups 
on his Web page. ``People say: `Hey! You're that guy who's interested 
in terrorism.' It's a nice conversation breaker.'' Ben Thornton, a 
programmer living in the Silicon Hills of Austin, Texas, brags about 
being a nude ham radio operator. Paul Gore, an assistant professor 
of psychology at Southern Illinois University, said techies had a 
predilection for prepubescent hobbies, in direct correlation to their 
creativity. ``Programmers have very strong artistic tendencies,'' 
said Gore, who is a vocational psychologist. ``Studies show that an 
openness to new experience correlates with overall intelligence. Some 
people might say these hobbies are `juvenile,' but I see them as unconventional 
and very original.'' Thus, in Silicon Valley, midnight squirt-gun 
wars are not uncommon. But do not expect to fit in just because you 
take unicycle lessons, said Lynn Taylor, a vice president at the recruiting 
firm Robert Half International. ``Being gimmicky won't help you get 
a job,'' she said, but it doesn't necessarily hurt. Giving piggyback 
rides, for example, might not get you a job on Wall Street, but high-tech's 
mores are a bit different. ``Piggyback riding reflects that the person 
is approachable,'' Ms. Taylor said. Finding techies with social skills 
is a particular challenge, she added. ``People tend to remember my 
name when they need someone in my field,'' said Ms. Massalin, the 
piggybacker and koala lover. She believes that exceptional technical 
people usually favor social experimentation and nonconformity and 
have no need to adhere to convention. ``I happen to know good-working 
but not otherwise exceptionally creative technical folks, and they 
seem not to have unusual hobbies,'' said Ms. Massalin, who is known 
to begin and end her conversations with the word ``qua,'' which she 
says is the sound a koala makes. Anyone can be a Denver Broncos fan 
or even have knowledge of Oriental rugs, but it is the rare adult 
bird who still collects Hot Wheels. Dierschow, the British Petroleum 
collector, is also a proud member of the Bay Area Matchbox Collectors 
Association. He displays his cars on dusty spice racks nailed to his 
walls. Dierschow, a soft-spoken man with long hair who says he washes 
his clothes ``quarterly,'' still has his first toy car: a 1962 Volkswagen 
Caravette, a camper in mint green. His parents gave it to him when 
he was 7 years old. He has an MGTD Sports Car, a 1929 4.5-liter Bentley 
and an ERF 686 Ever Ready Platform truck _ more than a thousand toy 
vehicles in all. While showing off his cars, Dierschow turns into 
a nerd version of Vanna White, holding them up proudly and chatting 
about his best piece: a 1953 Elizabeth II coronation coach. Dierschow 
calls the beat-up coach his Holy Grail. When he decided to become 
a collector of Matchbox toys in his late 20s, Dierschow found the 
coach. ``I decided to go ahead and spend $165 for a lousy piece of 
metal because when I was a kid, that's what I wanted the most,'' he 
said, showing off the coach, tarnished and chipped and pulled by eight 
horses. Upstairs in his house, Dierschow has a collection of more 
than 1,000 cartridge video games. In another room, he also has what 
looks to the untrained eye like a pile of junk. Look closely, however, 
and you realize that it is a pile of old computers, peripherals, game 
consoles, joysticks and various cords. He has a dream: to stack the 
30 or so consoles and have them running, as a sort of altar to video 
games. Michael Butler, a contract programmer and self-proclaimed ``computer 
bum,'' was at Dierschow's house and overheard his Dierschow's dream 
speech. ``I didn't know you were collecting,'' Butler said. ``I got 
rid of some fairly obscure peripheral devices, like, you remember 
the Fairchild Channel F?'' ``Yeah, I've got one,'' Dierschow said. 
``Do you have the little control knobs?'' ``I've got a couple.'' ``They 
tended to break. I had a few spares that I threw away.'' ``Oh, wow.'' 
``We've never had this conversation, but one of the things that I've 
always wanted to do was take my KIM-1 and load it up with Microchess 
and leave it running! If you have a place for it here, I would be 
honored.'' ``Cool.'' But it is downstairs, at his temple to BP, where 
Dierschow expressed the most glee. ``I get some of the strangest looks 
when people look at this collection and say, `It's, er, BP?' '' He 
spends about 40 minutes a day at the Ebay online auction service searching 
for BP merchandise. ``I'd love to have BP come over and take a look 
at my collection and photograph it or something,'' said Dierschow, 
who also calls himself Oblivious. He added that he occasionally took 
items from his BP collection to show off at work. ``Maybe it's a little 
bit weird, but I used to have a boss who was into windsurfing,'' he 
said. ``That is weird.''
