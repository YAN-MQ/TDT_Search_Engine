In an action long sought by Gov. George E. Pataki and other proponents 
of the death penalty, New York state's highest court Wednesday sharply 
reduced the fees paid to court-appointed lawyers who represent poor 
defendants in capital murder cases. The Court of Appeals did not explain 
why it was ordering the reductions. But Pataki and many state lawmakers 
who support the death penalty have been pushing for a cut in the fees, 
contending that they were higher than in other states and that the 
defense costs in the state's capital murder trials had been too high. 
Defense lawyers, many academic experts on capital punishment and even 
some district attorneys have been lobbying to maintain the fees. They 
said that lowering them would make it less likely that the most skilled 
defense lawyers would accept death penalty cases, and that the overall 
quality of the defense in capital cases would decline. Capital punishment 
was reinstated in New York three years ago. So far, 31 defendants 
have been indicted on first-degree murder charges and formally notified 
that prosecutors would seek the death penalty in their cases. Six 
have gone to trial, and two have been sentenced to die. Nearly all 
the other cases were settled through plea bargains or are awaiting 
trial. One defendant killed himself before his case could come to 
trial. Capital defendants who cannot afford to hire a lawyer _ and 
the vast majority cannot _ are represented by lawyers from the Capital 
Defender Office, which was created by the legislature, by local public 
defenders or by private lawyers appointed by the courts. The reduction 
in fees applies only to court-appointed lawyers. The Court of Appeals, 
which by law determines rates for capital cases, in 1996 set the fee 
at $175 an hour for a lead counsel and at $150 an hour for an associate 
counsel. In reducing the fees, the court also created a two-tiered 
system. It provides one rate for lawyers while they represent defendants 
charged with first-degree murder, and a higher rate once those defendants 
have been formally notified that prosecutors will seek the death penalty. 
A lead lawyer will now be paid $125 an hour for legal work, a reduction 
of 29 percent, after a district attorney has filed what lawyers call 
a ``death notice.'' The fee for a lead lawyer will be $100 an hour 
for representing a murder suspect before a death-penalty notice is 
filed. The fee for an associate counsel will be $100 an hour after 
a death notice is filed, a reduction of 33 percent. The associate 
counsel's fees for work prior to a death notice will be $75 an hour. 
State Sen. Dale M. Volker, a Republican from Depew, outside Buffalo, 
who led the effort to reinstate the death penalty in New York for 
two decades, has lobbied strongly for a reduction in defense lawyers' 
fees. Volker did not return calls seeking comment, but he made clear 
his position in an interview two weeks ago. ``Attorneys in New York 
are getting more money than any attorneys in the country in capital 
cases, and we need to put some brakes on it,'' Volker said. ``I believe 
we should give adequate compensation to lawyers who represent defendants 
in capital cases. But there isn't a doubt that there has been some 
padding here by attorneys, that they are trying to say, `The death 
penalty is too expensive.''' Court-appointed lawyers in federal capital 
cases receive $125 an hour. In other states, fees range from $150 
an hour in California to $20 an hour in Alabama, according to data 
provided by the Court of Appeals. Defense lawyers and some district 
attorneys said capital cases were more complicated, time-consuming 
and expensive than typical criminal cases. They say lower fees might 
prevent the best lawyers from representing capital defendants. ``This 
is going to create a crisis in the death penalty where none existed.'' 
said Jonathan E. Gradess, executive director of the New York State 
Defenders Association. On Tuesday, the Court of Appeals struck down 
as unconstitutional most of the plea bargaining provisions in New 
York's death penalty law. It is likely that plea bargains will now 
be harder to obtain and that more capital cases will go to trial. 
``There is now a greater need for experienced counsel,'' Gradess said. 
``They turn around and cut the fee.''
