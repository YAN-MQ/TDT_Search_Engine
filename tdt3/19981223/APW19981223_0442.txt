Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin was freed Wednesday by Yasser 
Arafat's Palestinian Authority from nearly two months of house arrest. 
The move is likely to heighten tensions between the Palestinians and 
Israel, coming as the two sides accuse each other of violations of 
the now-stalled Wye River land-for-security accord. A spokesman for 
Hamas, Mahmoud Zahar, said the group welcomed the decision to free 
Yassin.
