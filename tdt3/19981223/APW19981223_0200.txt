A British military helicopter crashed just outside of a NATO base 
in Gornji Vakuf, some 70 kilometers (40 miles) west of Sarajevo, NATO 
officials said Wednesday. The Lynx helicopter carried three people 
on board -- all of whom were reported hurt -- when it crashed Tuesday, 
said Maj. Keith Jarvis, a NATO spokesman in Sarajevo. The extent of 
the injuries was not announced. Local police in Gornji Vakuf, citing 
witnesses, said one person died but NATO refused to comment on the 
report. ``The crash is now subject to formal military investigation 
and there will be no further comment to the cause of the accident 
until the investigation is completed,'' Jarvis said. Since NATO deployed 
the peace force three years ago, 91 members have died while on duty 
in non-combat accidents _ mostly traffic accidents or landmine blasts.
