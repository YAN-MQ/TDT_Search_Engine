For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in London. 
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he'll avenge Hezbollah 
rocket attacks against northern Israel. Hezbollah says the attacks 
are in response to yesterday's Israeli air raid into Lebanon. A woman 
and six of her children were killed. From Jerusalem, Lise Dusette 
reports. Mr. Netanyahu said Israel would respond, according to "our 
considerations when we want." His warning came after Israel's security 
cabinet met to consider its response to Hezbollah's attack against 
northern Israel. Dozens of rockets caused extensive damage, but there 
were few casualties since residents were ordered to spend the night 
in bomb shelters. More and more Israelis believe Israel should pull 
its troops out, but the government is reluctant to withdraw without 
sufficient guarantees that Hezbollah fighters would not advance to 
the very edge of Israel. Lise Dusette, BBC, Jerusalem.
