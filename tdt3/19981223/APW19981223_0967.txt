A bus collided with a fuel truck on a highway near the Black Sea port 
city of Samsun on Wednesday, burning at least 11 people to death, 
news reports said. At least 10 other people were injured in the fiery 
crash, the Anatolia news agency reported. The two vehicles were still 
ablaze hours after the accident, raising fears the casualty count 
would go higher. The bus was en route to Samsun from the capital, 
Ankara, 420 kilometers (250 miles) to the southwest. The area is not 
a major tourist destination. Anatolia said the crash was caused by 
faulty passing and a slippery road. It was not clear which of the 
two vehicles was at fault.
