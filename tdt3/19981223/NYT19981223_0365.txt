The Nicaraguan ambassador, Francisco Aguirre Facasa, still seemed 
stunned by the magnitude of the catastrophe. He noted that the deluge 
_ 30 to 60 inches of rain in just three or four days _ came at the 
tail end of the monsoon season. The country was already saturated 
when the storm, unimaginably violent, arrived. ``It was the worst 
natural disaster ever to hit the Western Hemisphere,'' said Aguirre 
Facasa. Roads, bridges, homes, businesses, crops, livestock and thousands 
of people were destroyed when Hurricane Mitch tore through Central 
America in late October. Honduras and Nicaragua were hit the worst. 
The story would have gotten much more coverage in the United States 
if Monica and Bill had not had such a stranglehold on the news. More 
than a dozen villages in northwestern Nicaragua were buried when the 
walls of a volcano gave way after its crater filled with water. Two 
thousand or more people were killed. The mayor of a nearby town said 
at the time, ``It is like a desert littered with buried bodies.'' 
Aguirre Facasa talked about the ``killer landslides'' and rampaging 
rivers in a telephone conversation Wednesday. ``Altogether they cost 
us 4,000 lives,'' he said. ``At one point, we had 900,000 people homeless.'' 
The waters are receding but the emotional, physical and economic devastation 
remains. Doctors who returned to New York this week from a humanitarian 
mission to Nicaragua spoke of the sense of depression and despondency 
they found in large segments of the population. ``People have lost 
relatives, their jobs, their homes, all of their possessions,'' said 
Dr. Paula Rackoff, who was one of three physicians from Beth Israel 
Medical Center in New York who volunteered to go to Nicaragua. The 
trip was jointly sponsored by the hospital and a humanitarian group, 
the American Jewish World Service. Most of the people seen by Dr. 
Rackoff and her colleagues, Dr. Lauren Shaiova and Dr. Michelle Torres, 
were women and children living in wretched circumstances. Families 
were crammed into schools, churches, outdoor encampments and other 
emergency shelters. They did not have enough food. Sanitation was 
poor, medical supplies were scarce and there was widespread suffering 
from dehydration, infections and other ailments that are easily treatable 
under ordinary circumstances. The problems wrought by the hurricane 
were compounded by the fact that Nicaragua was desperately poor to 
begin with. Many families were struggling to meet their most basic 
needs before the hurricane hit. Dr. Rackoff said she was surprised 
by the absence of men and the plight of the women in the villages. 
``We all had this gnawing question of where the men were,'' she said. 
``We were told over and over that the women were really in charge 
of the household and the men had very little responsibility. The women 
often have many children. The average number is six, with a few different 
fathers.'' The doctors visited clinics in five villages, including 
a women's health center in Tipitapa, offering what Dr. Rackoff described 
as ``the very basics'' of primary care. Much of what they encountered 
had nothing to do with the hurricane. ``There was a lot of venereal 
disease, which we weren't prepared for,'' said Dr. Rackoff. ``The 
women running the health center told us they really needed medication 
for pelvic inflammatory disease, which we didn't have, and that there 
is a lot of stage one cervical cancer, which is curable. It's an outpatient 
procedure here. They don't even have speculums in the women's center.'' 
Dr. Rackoff said there were many requests for birth control pills 
and condoms. She said, ``The women seem like they really want to take 
care of themselves, but they don't know which way to turn.'' Tens 
of thousands of Nicaraguans remain homeless and short of food and 
medical help. Christoph Gorder, the project director for the humanitarian 
group AmeriCares, said that during a recent visit to Nicaragua relief 
workers pleaded with him ``to get meals for the people for Christmas.'' 
AmeriCares is about to send a 63,000-pound shipment of medicine and 
hospital supplies to Nicaragua, but the level of need there and in 
other parts of Central America is staggering. ``It is going to be 
a very difficult Christmas,'' he said.
