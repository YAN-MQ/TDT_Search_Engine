A provincial court on Wednesday ordered a medical examination for 
retired Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski to establish if the former communist 
leader can stand trial. Jaruzelski, 75, is accused of ordering riot 
police to open fire on workers rioting over price increases in December 
1970. He was defense minister at the time, when riot police killed 
44 workers in the cities of Gdansk, Gdynia, Szczecin and Elblag. The 
Provincial Court in Gdansk, a Baltic Sea port, opened a case against 
Jaruzelski and 11 other former communist officials on March 28, 1996, 
but the trial was delayed by the repeated absence of some of the defendants 
or their lawyers. Last year, Jaruzelski and four other accused were 
temporarily exempted from the trial due to ill health. His doctors 
cited kidney and back problems, as well as depression. The Gdansk 
court decided Wednesday that Jaruzelski should be examined to check 
if his health improved enough to appear in court, Judge Jacek Hyla 
told the PAP state news agency. All of the former communist officials 
could receive up to 25 years in prison if convicted of ordering and 
directing the riot police shooting. In 1981, Jaruzelski was Poland's 
leader and ordered the martial law crackdown on the Solidarity democratic 
movement. While many Poles believe he should be prosecuted for the 
martial law period, in which human rights abuses occurred, Jaruzelski 
has so far avoided standing trial.
