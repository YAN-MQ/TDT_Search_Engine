When you pick up a prescription drug, do you check the label to make 
sure you're getting the right medicine? An estimated 1.3 million Americans 
are injured each year because of medication errors, such as receiving 
the wrong drug or taking the wrong dosage. The institute for safe 
medical practices estimates 25% to 30% of the problems are caused 
because health care workers mix up drugs with similar names. More 
than 1,000 drugs have names that either look or sound alike. To avoid 
a drug mixup, experts recommend you know the brand and generic names 
of all your medications. Doctors can use computers to write prescriptions, 
avoiding the problem of illegible handwriting. And pharmacists should 
double-check the dosage and explain the drug's use.
