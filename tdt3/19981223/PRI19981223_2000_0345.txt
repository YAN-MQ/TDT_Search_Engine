Cambodia says it wants compensation from the Taiwanese firm blamed 
for dumping toxic waste near the coastal town of Sihanoukville. Deputy 
prime minister Sar Kheng says the company should pay for the clean-up 
work and compensate local people. Clean-up efforts have failed so 
far. Soldiers wearing heavy protective clothing could not work in 
the heat.
