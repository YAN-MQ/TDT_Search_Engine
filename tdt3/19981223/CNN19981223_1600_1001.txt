Technology stocks drive the financial markets towards record highs 
today. I'm Lauren Thierry in New York with this edition of "Dollars 
& Sense." Intel drew support following an upgrade from meryll Lynch. 
And America online was named as the first Internet stock to be added 
to the s&p 500. And the most stellar performer has been a relative 
unknown, online auction house ubid. That stock is up more than $100 
a share this week alone. That's a rise of about 1,000%. Other Internet 
stars include Amazon.com and eBAY. %, 38, of all initial public offerings 
this year have been Internet related. But all that glitters is not 
necessarily gold. Bill Tucker reports. Of the 38 Internet IPOs that've 
come to market this year, 80% are trading above their offering price. 
And this hasn't been a good year for IPOs. Only 35% of all other offerings 
have gained ground. Analysts say dot com it, and they will come. Maybe 
there's 50 companies and maybe 20 are real legitimate, and the others 
are kind of coming along for the ride. And it's your role as a stock 
picker to separate the one from the other. But to ignore the industry 
is foolish. And while many institutions have shied away from Internet, 
individual investors have been very active traders in the stocks. 
And the market frenzy has been made worse by fear -- fear of missing 
the next big one, fear of being the only investor on the block not 
cashing in on the Internet, a fear heightened by the relatively small 
size of the typical Internet offering. Nobody wants to miss the next 
Yahoo! That's clearly the case. I think that there's also a Buyer 
sentiment that seems to have shifted maybe several months ago, again, 
going back to the big Christmas season. And nobody wants to miss out. 
But internets are clearly not for everyone. They're very volatile. 
Creative computers, for example, is up better than 140% in just the 
past six days. But in the nine sessions prior to that, it was down 
60% performances like that mean investors should take a quick gut 
check and decide if they have the stomach for the ride. Bill Tucker, 
"CNN Financial News," New York.
