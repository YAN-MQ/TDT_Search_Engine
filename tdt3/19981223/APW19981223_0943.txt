Talking more like a Wall Street master of the universe than a cook, 
Bernard Loiseau says becoming the first three-star chef to sell stock 
will further expand his empire. ``I'm on full power, I'm the leader 
of my profession, in good financial health, and I have development 
projects,'' the outspoken cuisinier said Wednesday, five days before 
his stock goes on sale. The 322,500 shares, at a price of 49 francs 
(dlrs 8.75) each, will hit the Secondary Market of the French Bourse 
on Monday. At that price, that would amount to 15.8 million francs 
(dlrs 2.8 million). ``The stock market isn't garbage. For a company 
to enter the market means cutting debt, allowing self-financing and 
investment,'' Loiseau said at his three-star Cote d'Or restaurant 
in Saulieu, a Bourgogne city of eastern France. ``I have 20 years 
before me. I want to make this little company move,'' said Loiseau, 
who has managed to marry cuisine with showmanship and marketing to 
hang on to Cote d'Or's three Michelin Guide stars since 1991. Loiseau 
wants to expand his current empire that also includes Tante Louise 
in Paris, catering, consulting and a retail shop. ``My greatest strength 
is that I have been able to diversify my activities in the restaurant 
business between ``high fashion'' and ``ready-to-wear,'' he said. 
``When I was 15 years old I always said I would be the best cook in 
France. Now I want to ensure the long-term life of my companies.'' 
Could that mean less time in the kitchen?
