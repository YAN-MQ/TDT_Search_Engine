Kyrgyzstan's entire government resigned Wednesday after President 
Askar Akayev accused the cabinet of incompetence and failing to develop 
the country's anemic economy, news reports said. ``It is impossible 
to work with such a cabinet,'' Akayev was quoted as saying by the 
presidential press service. He said the small, mountainous Central 
Asian nation should enter the new year with ``a new, more capable 
government.'' Prime Minister Kubanychbek Zhumaliyev and all the government 
ministers resigned and the president was expected to issue a decree 
formally dismissing the government, Russian news agencies report. 
Akayev and the Security Council criticized the cabinet for poor economic 
performance, the reports said. According to government figures, the 
economy has grown 1.7 percent this year, which would make Kyrgyzstan 
one of the few ex-Soviet republics that hasn't seen an economic contraction 
this year. However, the country suffers from high inflation, a trade 
deficit and a weakening currency. Akayev has been president of Kyrgyzstan 
since it gained independence in the 1991 Soviet breakup. The mountainous, 
agricultural nation that has seen minimal economic development since 
then.
