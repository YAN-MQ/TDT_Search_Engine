Facing a tableful of politicians at a Capitol Hill club last week, 
the waitress picked out Rep. Christopher Shays and exclaimed, ``You're 
the guy that I saw on TV. You're the guy that had that meeting.'' 
Shays, the famously bland Connecticut Republican whose constituents 
had vented about impeachment until 2 a.m. at a town meeting that C-Span 
broadcast live on Tuesday of last week, said he took the woman's name 
so he could delve into her views on the topic later. Shays calls himself 
``an extreme moderate'' and last week he was decidedly undecided about 
whether to vote to impeach President Clinton. So Washington hung on 
his every hem and haw. First he declared that he opposed impeachment. 
Then early last week, in a grim sign for the White House, he said 
he was rethinking that. By midweek, he had become convinced the president 
had obstructed justice and was set on voting ``yes.'' Then he returned 
to his original position. Along the way, he presided over the town 
meeting for 1,500 at Norwalk City Hall, huddled privately with the 
President on Friday, and adopted the stance of a solicitously curious 
country doctor, as he sought the views of voters in private chats. 
To his supporters in his district, here in the Connecticut suburbs 
of New York City, it all reflected rigorous research, deep thinking 
and admirable independence. To his critics, it was ludicrous hand-wringing. 
Shays was greeted by both camps on Wednesday as he returned to his 
district to explain himself with the mantra that ``impeachable offenses 
were not proven and the proven offenses were not impeachable.'' He 
does remain highly critical of Clinton and asserted that ``The worst 
thing he could do is to treat the Senate like he treated the House, 
and that was by not fully complying with the investigation.'' Shays 
said he finally decided on Friday morning, just 24 hours before he 
would break from his party and become one of five Republicans who 
voted against impeachment. Later that day, he met with the president 
for 70 minutes. To set an intimate tone, Shays brought no staff, which 
for Washington's powerful is nearly as remarkable a gesture as showing 
up barefoot. The president, who kept one of his lawyers in the room, 
may have been wasting his time. Shays, who said he will keep the specifics 
of their discussion secret, said he had been determined to make up 
his mind in advance, noting that the president ``can be very persuasive.'' 
So instead, Shays used the meeting to tell the president about the 
very mixed views that had emerged at the town meeting. On Wednesday 
morning, Karen D. Blackwell, an antiques dealer, hugged Shays as he 
returned to Norwalk City Hall to meet constituents. Ms. Blackwell, 
a member of the Norwalk Republican Committee, had favored impeachment 
but was willing to forgive her representative's conclusion. ``Christopher 
voted his conscience and his heart,'' Ms. Blackwell said. But Kenneth 
J. Slapin, a local Democratic organizer, accused Shays of being on 
a ``showboat circuit,'' and scolded him for ``trying to have it both 
ways by bashing the president and then voting against impeachment.'' 
Shays, who stopped publicly discussing his views in the four days 
before the votes on articles of impeachment and had not explained 
them since, offered an earnest autopsy on Wednesday. He said he began 
to re-examine his opposition to impeachment when several colleagues 
who had been anti-impeachment began to waver. ``I was thinking, `What 
are they seeing, what are they aware of, that I'm not aware of,''' 
he said. At the town meeting on Tuesday of last week, he said he heard 
powerful arguments for and against the president, and said he was 
struck by the number of constituents who ``not only dislike him, they 
think he's a despicable person.'' As he began driving back to Washington 
in the hours before dawn, he was leaning against impeachment. ``I 
really concluded that those who wanted the president impeached wanted 
to set a standard,'' he said. ``But I didn't feel that impeachment 
was the way you _ quote, unquote _ set a standard. When the American 
people elect someone, I believe it's sacred and I believe you only 
remove for high crimes.'' On Wednesday, though, he changed his mind 
after he looked at some secret material about Clinton, including a 
description of an unsubstantiated encounter with another woman, that 
the independent counsel's office had provided to the House Judiciary 
Committee. The material, which was viewed by several moderate Republicans 
who were wrestling with their decisions, was available to members 
of Congress but not to the public. ``It was very alarming, very unsettling,'' 
Shays said. ``It involved conduct by the president that is alleged 
to be pretty horrific.'' He said he began to ``believe that this information 
I was looking at would support obstruction of justice.'' He said that 
when he went to bed, he was convinced he could vote for at least one 
article of impeachment. On Thursday, he said he went back and looked 
at the documents again, spoke to Republican lawyers and investigators 
who had looked into it. That afternoon, he said he became concerned 
that the allegations had not been proven. The next day, he talked 
to a person familiar with the material, whom he would not identify 
beyond saying that the person is outside Congress or the White House. 
``This individual said to me, `There is no obstruction of justice,''' 
Shays said. ``So whatever I thought about the actions that involved 
the president, there was no obstruction of justice.'' However, Shays 
said that if the House eventually is asked to join a joint censure 
with the Senate, he will think about it.
