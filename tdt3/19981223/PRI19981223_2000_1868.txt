Defense Secretary William Cohen says Washington is reducing its military 
presence in the Gulf region, but it will still keep nearly 20,000 
troops there. Mr. Cohen was speaking during a visit to troops on the 
USS Enterprise. Frank Gardner reports from Dubais. Less than four 
days after launching the biggest air strikes on Iraq since the Gulf 
War of 1991, the crew sang along at a mini concert given by Carole 
King and other musicians accompanying the U.S. defense secretary. 
The Pentagon has described William Cohen's visit as one of good will 
at Christmas time. But he's also carrying a message for a wide audience. 
He told U.S. forces that without them, America would not be a superpower. 
No doubt for the benefit of those in Baghdad, Mr. Cohen emphasized 
to reporters that despite the imminent withdrawal of up to 9,000 U.S. 
troops and warplanes from the region, U.S. forces could still strike 
Iraq at any time. Frank Gardner, BBC News, Dubais.
