Belgium's highest court has found former NATO Secretary General, Willie 
Claus, guilty of corruption charges, and has given him a three-year 
suspended jail sentence. John Frasier, in Brussels, reports, Claus 
was among a number of senior Belgium politicians and officials who 
were convicted in what has been dubbed, "Belgium's trial of the century." 
The charges date back to the 1980's when Belgium's Dutch and French-speaking 
socialist parties were paid bribes in return for awarding two defense 
contracts, each of which was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Both socialist parties were members of the country's coalition government. 
At the time Claus was Economics Minister, and he played an important 
role in approving both of the contracts. Claus always denied the charges, 
but he was forced to resign, from his top NATO job, in October of 
1995, when it became clear that he faced prosecution. Other politicians 
convicted, include the former head of Belgium's French-speaking socialist 
party, De Spitaus, who went on to become president of the French region 
of Belgium. And, there was a guilty verdict for former Belgium Defense 
Minister, Akee Kohem, who went on to become deputy Prime Minister, 
until he, too, was forced to resign from political life. French businessman, 
Trej Dackau, who paid one of the bribes to the Belgium politicians, 
was also convicted. John Frashier, for VOA News, Brussels.
