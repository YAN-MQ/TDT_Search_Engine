Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky vowed to support politicians 
struggling for independence of Moldova's Slav-dominated region of 
Trans-Dniester, a separatist official said Wednesday. Zhirinovsky's 
one-day visit Tuesday came as Russia's State Duma prepared to debate 
a resolution that could call for recognition of Trans-Dniester's sovereignty. 
Zhirinovsky predicted most lawmakers would approve the resolution 
and ask President Boris Yeltsin to officially back the separatists 
in the breakaway region, Grigori Marakuta, a spokesman of the Trans-Dniester 
parliament said. Zhirinovsky, president of Russia's Liberal Democratic 
Party, refused to meet with Moldovan national officials. He also warned 
neighboring Romania not to interfere in politics of Moldova, a former 
Soviet Republic. ``Romania should watch out for its own interests 
and take its gaze off the east, because it is known that any attempt 
of expansion eastwards has ended badly.'' About three million of Moldova's 
4.5 million inhabitants are ethnic Romanians while the rest are mostly 
Slavs who moved here during Soviet times. Trans-Dniester, a sliver 
of land in eastern Moldova, with a population of 700,000 mainly ethnic 
Slavs, declared independence in 1990 fearing that Moldova would seek 
to reunite with neighboring Romania. A five-month war between Moldova 
and the separatists in 1992 killed about 700. Fighting ceased after 
Russia sent in troops. Relations have remained tense. Recently Ukraine, 
Romania and Moldova urged Russia to withdraw its few remaining troops 
from Trans-Dniester and recommended an international monitoring force. 
The presidents of the three countries signed a document saying that 
Trans-Dniester is a region inside the territory of an independent 
Moldova. But Zhirinovsky said the communist-dominated Duma would recommend 
the independence of Trans-Dniester. He said that Moscow expects later 
a union between Russia and Trans-Dniester. A Chisinau government spokesman 
said Wednesday that Moldova considers Zhirinovsky's visit ``private'' 
and the government hasn't yet commented. Trans-Dniester separatists 
gave Zhirinovsky 30 bottles of cognac who posed for photos with the 
waitresses who served him. Zhirinovsky presented his hosts with a 
signed bottle of Zhirinovsky vodka, which vodka producers named after 
him.
