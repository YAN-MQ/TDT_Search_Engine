Anatoly Rybakov, whose long-suppressed novel about the Stalinist era, 
``Children of the Arbat,'' finally appeared in 1987 to affirm the 
reality of glasnost, died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 
87 and also had a home in Moscow. His wife, Tatyana Rybakova, said 
he died in his sleep. He had heart surgery last summer and recently 
suffered a bout of bronchitis, but two days before his death he had 
attended a party for a visiting Russian democrat, Grigory Yavlinsky. 
His widow said the author's remains would be cremated and his ashes 
returned to Moscow. When in 1987, ``Druzhba Narodov,'' or ``Friendship 
of the Peoples,'' one of the Soviet Union's so-called ``thick journals,'' 
published ``Children of the Arbat,'' the reaction inside and outside 
the the nation was immediate and remarkable. In the Soviet Union, 
the magazine's circulation, went from its normal run of 150,000 to 
800,000. Abroad, the book's release sharply raised the credibility 
of President Mikhail Gorbachev's talk of new thinking, reform and 
openness. Using fictional characters in a historical setting, the 
book described and evoked the Stalinist past, portraying the lives 
of childhood friends from a Moscow neighborhood as they became enmeshed 
in the terror of the 1930s, some as prisoners in Siberian camps, others 
as apparatchiks compromised by opportunism. Stalin was portrayed mostly 
through imagined interior monologues as cunning, brutal and cynical. 
But it was not the literary quality of the work that stimulated such 
a wide response. Irving Howe reflected the views of most critics when 
he called the work ``disappointing, lumbering and uneven.'' He noted 
that it lacked ``the lyricism of Boris Pasternak's `Dr. Zhivago,' 
the moral fire of `The First Circle,' the intellectual audacity of 
Vasily Grossman's `Life and Fate.''' Instead, Howe contended, ``What 
we have here is a novel that seems made to order, decades in advance, 
for the Gorbachev moment: tell more than anyone since Khrushchev about 
the time of terror, but don't stray too far from the party's orthodoxies 
and avoid the `delicate' problem of the relations between the terror 
and the system. Boldness of presentation fades off into timidity of 
reflection.'' But it was precisely ``the boldness of presentation'' 
that made ``Children of the Arbat'' so singular. This was, after all, 
a book that first appeared in the Soviet Union. It was not published 
in some samizdat, or underground, venture and then reprinted abroad. 
It had been written 20 years earlier, and twice before, in 1966 and 
in 1978, it had been announced that it was to be serialized in journals 
only to have those decisions countermanded by Communist Party officials. 
When the book first appeared, the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko declared, 
``After this, it will be impossible to have the same history books 
in our libraries and schools.'' Moreover, it was written not by a 
marginal dissident, but by a writer who had been enormously well known 
throughout the Soviet Union for his children's stories, which had 
been turned into films and which four decades earlier had won him 
that imprimatur of orthodoxy, the Stalin Prize. A short but stocky 
and powerful man, who had used his own experiences as a gulag prisoner, 
truck driver, war hero and dance instructor, in ``Children of the 
Arbat'' and its two sequels, Rybakov was abashed by the criticism 
that related his work to that of Pasternak and Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn. 
``These are great writers and I am not trying to equate myself with 
them,'' he said in an interview in 1987. ``But their books were published 
across the border, and mine was the first to be published in the Soviet 
Union.'' He also wrote two novels that continued to trace the lives 
of the scattered group of friends from the old Arbat neighborhood. 
``Fear'' was published in 1992 and ``Dust and Ashes,'' which concludes 
as the Soviet Army is turning the tide of battle in World War II, 
was published in 1996. Rybakov continued to write until his death, 
while serving as a leader of Russia's PEN Club. He divided his time 
between Moscow and New York, saying that because of the nearly steady 
stream of people eager to see him in Russia and enlist his support 
for their causes, he found it easier to write in his Manhattan apartment. 
Anatoly Rybakov was born on Jan. 14, 1911, in Chenigov in what is 
now Ukraine. His father, Naum, was an engineer. The family, assimilated 
Jews, moved while Anatoly was still a child to the Arbat district 
of Moscow, where he attended the Moscow Institute of Railway Engineers. 
He was still in school when he was arrested in 1933 and sentenced 
to three years of exile in Siberia. He once said that as a committed 
Communist, ``I was very depressed after the arrest for I had done 
nothing.'' He added: ``But I soon found out from others that if you 
did nothing you only got three years. If I had done something, they 
would have given me 10 years.'' He wrote his first book, a work for 
children called ``Kortik'' (``The Dagger''), in 1948. A story of wartime 
heroism, it became extremely popular and was made into a movie. Stalin 
is said to have admired it, and in 1951, after having written several 
children's books and a novel called ``The Drivers,'' Rybakov was awarded 
the Stalin Prize. In 1978, Rybakov's novel ``Heavy Sand'' appeared 
in the Russian literary journal Oktyabr. It dealt with the plight 
of Ukrainian Jews tortured and killed by the Nazis. Peter Lewis, writing 
in The Times Literary Supplement, said the publication ``caused a 
sensation in the Soviet Union,'' where ``Russian writers, while pouring 
out material about the Patriotic War of 1941-45, have shied away from 
the uniquely terrible Jewish experience of that time for domestic 
political reasons (including Stalinist and post-Stalinist anti-Semitism).'' 
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons from earlier marriages, 
Aleksandr and Aleksei.
