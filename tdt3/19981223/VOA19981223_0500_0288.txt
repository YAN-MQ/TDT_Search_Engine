A U.S. newspaper says the United States is considering expelling three 
Cuban diplomats, that are credited to the United Nations for alleged 
espionage activities. The Washington Post quotes diplomatic sources 
as saying the Cuban mission, at the United Nations, was notified of 
the U.S. intentions on Monday. The report says Cuban officials were 
given 24 hours to counter the charges. There is no word, at this time, 
if Cuba has made a reply.
