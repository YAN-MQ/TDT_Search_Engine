International monitors on Wednesday welcomed an agreement under which 
Dutch experts will help Russia to destroy part of its decaying arsenal 
of Cold War chemical weapons. The Dutch government has pledged to 
donate 10 million guilders (dlrs 5.3 million) to help fund a project 
to destroy 6,500 metric tons of poison that has been stored since 
the 1950s at a depot in Kambarka, 1,200 kilometers (744 miles) east 
of Moscow in the Udmurt Republic. Serguei Batsanov of The Hague-based 
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said the Dutch 
gesture should prompt other governments to help Russia destroy its 
40,000 tons of chemical weapons _ the world's largest such stockpile. 
While Russian authorities have said the destruction is a priority, 
they add that they cannot afford to complete the task themselves. 
``While welcoming this particular agreement, the director general 
believes it would be a good example for other countries which have 
not yet joined this cooperation process to follow suit,'' Batsanov 
said. Under the agreement, a Dutch expert from the Defense Ministry 
will oversee the delicate operation to destroy arsenic-based lewisite 
poison gas. Russian officials say they expect foreign money to cover 
about dlrs 1 billion of the estimated dlrs 6 billion cost of destroying 
their chemical weapons.
