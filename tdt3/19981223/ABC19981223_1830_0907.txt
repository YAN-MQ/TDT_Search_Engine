The nation's largest organization of doctors is getting into a scrap 
with the nation's largest health care manager. Aetna/U.S. healthcare 
wants to buy the health care business owned by prudential insurance. 
The American medical association, which has never fought a medical 
merger before, says in a letter to the justice department that this 
is a bad idea. Here's ABC's George strait. The nation's largest doctor 
group says it is outraged over the proposed billion-dollar deal between 
the two health insurance giants, because the merger would put too 
much power in the hands of one company. In its letter to the justice 
department, the ama complains, the new health care giant would be 
covering one in at least every ten Americans. The ama said patients 
will suffer because, "Aetna's ultimate responsibility is to its shareholders, 
not the medical needs of each patient." It is anti-competitive. It 
is anti-choice. And it will result in a decrease in the quality of 
patient care. Aetna has been under considerable fire from doctors 
recently. Hundreds of physicians in Texas, New York, and other states 
have refused to work for Aetna. They say the fees it pays doctors 
are too low, and that Aetna doesn't allow doctors to give the best 
medical care available. The CEO of Aetna says those charges are unfair. 
Profits are important, but we feel that is not at all in conflict 
with providing good quality care at an affordable price to the largest 
number of americans. Health care experts say this battle centers on 
two issues. First, the ama, which has been rocked by scandal and declining 
membership is struggling to remain relevant. The second is money. 
Insurers make money docs as little as they can get away with. Docs, 
on the other hand, they want nobody looking over their shoulder. They 
want to be able to deliver whatever services they want and charge 
as much as they can get for them. Billions are at stake. But the ultimate 
winner or loser in this fight is patients. What the two sides are 
really arguing are differing visions of the best way to deliver health 
care. George strait, ABC News, Washington.
