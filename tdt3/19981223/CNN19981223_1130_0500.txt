There are two more shopping days until Christmas, but it may not be 
enough for retailers. Analysts initially predicted a 4% to 5% gain 
over last year's sales, boosted in part by lower wholesale prices. 
But sales have not reached the predicted highs. Weather appears to 
have influenced shopping habits. Recent warm temperatures stemmed 
winter clothing sales. And now, snowstorms could keep many last-minute 
buyers housebound. Some retailers are hoping after-Christmas sales 
will compensate for the losses.
