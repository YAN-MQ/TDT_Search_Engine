The United States says it will withdraw many of its most sophisticated 
bombers and thousands of its troops from the Persian Gulf. Defense 
Secretary, William Cohen, made the announcement today during a stopover 
in Saudi Arabia, at the start of a two-day visit to U.S. forces in 
the Gulf. Pentagon officials say several heavy bombers, including 
the giant B-52s and other aircrafts used in the bombardment of Iraq, 
will return to their bases in the United States. They say the number 
of troops in the Gulf region, will also be scaled down from nearly 
30,000 to about 20,000.
