Shares in South Korea stayed telecommunication's giant, Korea Telcom, 
rose 15 percent on their debut on the main board of the Korean Stock 
Exchange, today. Analyst Nomo Rhea of Samson and Seoul, says it's 
a way for the government to lure foreign investment. For international 
investors, the problem, in terms of investing in Korea, like other 
Asian markets, has been -- there has not been enough quality stock. 
So, if you look from a top-down perspective, Korea looked much attractive 
in the regional perspective. But, in terms of actual stock picking, 
you didn't really have much choice. And, a lot of investors try to 
avoid the large conglomerate stock, because of the restructuring risk. 
And, in that sense, I think where Telecom, which will have a market 
capitalization of $8-$9 billion, offers a new opportunity for international 
investors. Shares of KT which monopolizes local and long-distance 
phone service have, up to now, been traded on the, informal, over-the-counter 
market.
