The NATO-led peace force in Bosnia removed Croatian police Wednesday 
from a disputed town along the two countries' border, drawing an angry 
response from Croatia. A group of Canadian peacekeepers expelled the 
Croatian police without incident from the town of Martin Brod, an 
area where Bosnia and Croatia are still negotiating over the border, 
a NATO statement said. Martin Brod, about 150 miles (250 kilometers) 
west of Sarajevo, was considered part of Bosnia before the 1991-95 
war. But during fighting, Croatian forces moved the border deeper 
into Bosnian territory and claimed about half of the town. The half 
that had been under control of Croatian police was put under the jurisdiction 
of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation, the statement said. International 
officials say Bosnia should control the area until its status is settled. 
Croat President Franjo Tudjman condemned the NATO move and contacted 
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana to demand the alliance's troops 
be removed. ``Such a one-sided action could have unforeseen harmful 
consequences,'' Croatia's National Security Council said in a statement 
carried by state-run radio. Earlier this week, Tudjman threatened 
to send troops to Martin Brod if NATO-led forced tried to take control 
of the Croat-controlled half of the city. The top international official 
in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, said in a statement that the peacekeepers 
were forced to eject the police after Croatia failed to keep promises 
to remove them.
