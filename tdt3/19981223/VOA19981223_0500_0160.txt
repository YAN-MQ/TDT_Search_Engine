Israel says it's upcoming early elections will not delay implementation 
of the Y River Peace Agreement, provided Palestinians uphold their 
end of the accord. Both the Palestinian authority and the United States 
has reacted sharply to reports the peace process would be frozen during 
the election campaign, which could extend into May. The Palestinians 
say they are complying with the Y Accord, but accuse Israel of setting 
new conditions.
