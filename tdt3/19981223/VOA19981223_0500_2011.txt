Lebanese guerrillas have fired salvos of rockets into northern Israel, 
in apparent retaliation for an Israeli air strike in Lebanon, on Tuesday, 
that killed a Lebanese woman and six of her children. At least 10 
Israelis have been reported wounded, in the barrage of Katusha rockets, 
which caused heavy property damage. VOA's David Gullis has a report 
from Jerusalem. The early morning rocket barrage had been expected, 
after the errant Israeli air strike and an unusual public apology, 
by Israel, for the Lebanese civilian deaths. The Katusha rockets fell 
in and around the northern Israeli town of Kuriat Shamona, near the 
Lebanese border, and in the western Galilee region. Israeli casualties 
were reported in both areas, though civilians had been instructed 
to spend the night in bomb shelters. The Lebanese family members, 
a mother and her six children, aged 1-16, were killed when a rocket 
fired from an Israeli plane hit a farmhouse in the northern Bekaa 
Valley, not far from Syria. The stated targets of the air strike, 
one of two staged by Israel, Tuesday, were positions held by pro-Iranian 
Hizbollah guerrillas, who have been battling Israeli troops in Israeli' 
s self-declared Lebanese security zone. Hizbollah avowed retaliation 
for the civilian deaths, and called on the Lebanese government to 
press for a U.N. Security Council meeting over, what it said, is a 
blatant violation of the 1996 agreement limiting the conflict. Israeli 
Defense Minister, Uksad Mordikide, told Israel television he had sent 
messages to Lebanon and Syria, expressing regret about the deaths, 
and hoped that the violence does not escalate. At the same time, he 
warned Hizbollah not to try to disrupt live to northern Israel, and 
that Israel was prepared to take all necessary measures if it does. 
Israeli aircraft over-flew southern Lebanon during the night, dropping 
flares to try to deter the launching of Katusha's which have a range 
of about 20 kilometers. Israeli artillery in the security zone was 
also reported to be returning fire. Israel and Hizbollah have been 
fighting in southern Lebanon since 1985, when Israel staked out the 
security zone along its border after withdrawing from a broader Lebanon 
invasion. David Guillis, VOA News, Jerusalem.
