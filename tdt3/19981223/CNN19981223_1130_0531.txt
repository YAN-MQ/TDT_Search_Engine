In a Texas hospital, the world's only known living octuplets continue 
their fight for life. Charles Zewe is in Houston with an update on 
their conditions. Critical. Stable. Struggling. The chukwu octuplets, 
doctors say, are showing small signs of life. They do respond to sound, 
they do respond to light, they do respond if you would bump their 
bed, they move around. The babies, who have not been named, are being 
watched for infection. There is particular concern for the tiniest 
of the eight, who, at 10.3 ounces, is as small as a Beanie baby. You 
can hold her hand in the end of your thumb. Lung development is the 
biggest threat. Pediatricians say only one of the eight can breathe 
on its own. And doctors suspect problems with blood flow to the babies' 
lungs. The mother, said to be much improved and in very good spirits, 
has been moved from intensive care to a private room. The parents 
issued a written statement saying, they're very excited and grateful 
to God. Are you interested in making a contribution to the fund? As 
doctors deal with the brittle health of the eight, contributions of 
money and baby goods for the chukwu's are only trickling in, in comparison 
to the outpouring of public support when the McCaughey septuplets 
were born in Iowa last year. Over lunch at a popular African restaurant, 
members of Houston's large, nigerian immigrant community said donations 
are slow, because no one is certain yet they'll live. People want 
to see the eight children survive first, basically and then afterwards, 
I'm sure there will be a lot of support pouring in for them. But doctors 
say the octuplets won't be "out of the Woods" medically for a while. 
They're going to be in a life-threatening situation for several weeks.
