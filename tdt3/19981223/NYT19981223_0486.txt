In a case pitting New York state against New York City, a judge approved 
a revised formula Wednesday night for sharing the more than $25 billion 
from the national suit against the tobacco industry. But the dispute 
is far from settled. The city's lawyers, who have charged that the 
plan shortchanges the city by as much as $2 billion, said they would 
appeal. The extraordinary windfall involved, projected at $1 billion 
a year for 25 years starting in 2000, plus an amount as yet undetermined 
beyond that, provoked an intense legal scramble involving the governor, 
the state attorney general, New York City and Westchester and Erie 
Counties. The formula approved Wednesday was the third version drafted 
by the attorney general, Dennis Vacco, whose office is authorized 
to settle the case, subject to court review. That approval came from 
Justice Stephen Crane, the administrative judge in charge of civil 
cases in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. But the city's appeal is 
expected to keep the case from being resolved until after Jan. 1, 
when Vacco, a Republican, is to turn over the post to Eliot Spitzer, 
a Democrat. Spitzer has criticized Vacco's handling of the case, but 
has so far declined to comment on the allocation of money, except 
to say that he is open to reviewing it. ``No matter how you slice 
it, it's a huge amount,'' he said. If he does try to modify the formula, 
he would confront the prickly political considerations and conflicting 
regional interests that already complicate the dispute. The money 
sharing would be based partly on population and partly on Medicaid 
costs. If Spitzer tries to raise the city's share, someone else would 
lose money. Lorna Goodman, a senior litigator for the city, said: 
``I don't know what will happen when we get a new attorney general. 
He, of course, can change it. But it's a zero-sum game.'' The formula 
approved Wednesday night would give $12.8 billion to the state, $6.7 
billion to the city and $5.5 billion to the 57 counties outside the 
city. Erie and Westchester Counties both challenged the formula. The 
issue could also be an early test of Spitzer's relations with Gov. 
George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, rival Republicans who campaigned 
against Spitzer but who are sparring with each other over the tobacco 
money. Spitzer paid a previously scheduled visit to the mayor Wednesday, 
but it was not known whether the money was discussed. Last week, Pataki 
was upset with Vacco's second draft, which had given $7.1 billion 
to the city. After the governor objected, Vacco issued the third version, 
restoring $400 million to the state. Vacco's office was pleased by 
the judge's decision upholding the formula. At an afternoon court 
hearing, the counsel to Vacco, Lucia Valente, defended the plan. ``It 
is fair, and it is reasonable,'' she said. ``We are balancing the 
interests of everyone.'' Ms. Valente added, ``We are talking about 
the biggest settlement in state history and the biggest settlement 
in national history.'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's press secretary, Colleen 
Roche, said, ``The judge's decision is unfair, and we will pursue 
every appellate avenue to ensure that New York City gets treated fairly.'' 
Ms. Goodman of the city's legal staff said: ``All the counties lumped 
together get 145 percent of their tobacco-related medical costs and 
we get 74 percent of ours. That's a gross disparity.'' Bolstering 
the mayor's stand, City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, whose approval is 
needed for the city to settle the tobacco suit, urged an appeal. Hevesi, 
a Democrat, said, ``I'm hopeful the new attorney general will fully 
review this case.'' The city raised three main arguments against Vacco's 
latest plan. The city said the formula is partly based on population, 
which does not reflect the actual health costs caused by smoking; 
that the formula omits the smoking-related costs of health coverage 
for government workers, retirees and their families, and that the 
formula was based on erroneous figures for Medicaid costs. Vacco's 
lawyers defended the formula as correct and fair to the city and said 
that population has been used in allocations elsewhere, notably in 
California. Crane said he was not empowered to revise the formula, 
only to reject or accept it as fair. He said the city's share compared 
favorably with what it would receive in some other states. In Texas, 
the state government took 87 percent and left 13 percent to counties, 
he said. The judge was reluctant to challenge the intricacies of the 
calculations. ``The complexity and controversy over the formulas used 
by the city versus those used by the state to derive the Medicaid 
figures alone,'' he wrote, ``provide eloquent evidence of the wisdom 
of according the attorney general's allocation a presumption of fairness, 
reasonableness and adequacy.'' Crane credited Vacco with negotiating 
the formula ``in good faith and at arms length.'' The ruling concluded: 
``For sure, other terms could have been negotiated. Likewise, other 
allocations could have been made between the counties, state and city 
of New York. But these observations do not render the settlement, 
including the class action allocation, less than fair, reasonable 
and adequate.''
