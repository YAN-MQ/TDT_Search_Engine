Three Cuban diplomats at the United Nations who are suspected of spying 
were ordered Wednesday to leave the country, American officials said. 
The three men were linked to espionage after an investigation by the 
FBI that led to the arrest and indictment of 10 suspected Cuban agents 
in Miami three months ago. The three men in New York have diplomatic 
passports, which give them immunity from prosecution as spies. The 
State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said Wednesday that the three 
diplomats _ identified by other U.S. officials as Eduardo Martinez 
Borbonet, a first secretary; Roberto Azanza Paez, a third secretary, 
and Gonzalo Fernandez Garay, an attache _ were being expelled ``for 
activities incompatible with their diplomatic status.'' The phrase 
is Cold War code for espionage. The three have been ordered to leave 
the United States by Monday evening. Those arrested in Miami were 
charged with trying to infiltrate military bases and Cuban exile organizations 
in the United States. They face life in prison if convicted. Hundreds 
of spies from Cuba's spy service, the Direccion General de Inteligencia, 
or DGI, live and work in the United States, according to former members 
of the service who have defected. A sizable fraction of the Cuban 
delegation at the United Nations has always been made up of intelligence 
officers, according to U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement officials. 
Many nations _ including the United States _ have used the United 
Nations as a base for intelligence work since it was founded more 
than 50 years ago, according to former officials of the CIA. During 
the Cold War at least a third of the diplomats at the Soviet Mission 
to the United Nations were suspected by the FBI of working for Soviet 
intelligence. Cuban intelligence officers do not operate under cover 
only as diplomats. They have posed as taxi drivers, real-estate brokers 
and weapons dealers in New Jersey and Florida. They have also posed 
as members of the Cuban immigrant communities in Miami who actively 
oppose the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro. Many of those groups have been 
infiltrated for years; the chief of operations of one of the most 
militant anti-Castro organizations secretly reported to Havana for 
a decade. Castro has openly defended his right to conduct intelligence 
operations in the United States. He justifies them as a legitimate 
response to American attempts to overthrow or undermine him over nearly 
four decades, and to the many groups of Cuban exiles who seek a swift 
end to his rule.
