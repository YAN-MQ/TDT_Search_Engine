The human rights group, Amnesty International, has condemned both 
government forces, and rebels, in Congo Brazzaville, for killing unarmed 
civilians. Amnesty says, since late August, hundreds of unarmed civilians 
have been reported killed in fighting between the rebel Ninja militia 
and government forces in the Pool region of Southern Congo. It says 
those displaced by the fighting, may be at risk for starvation or 
disease.
