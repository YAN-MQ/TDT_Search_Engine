Two hundred camels, 600 horses, 1,000 extras, 300 wigs, 1,500 pieces 
of jewelry. An epic saga of sex, greed and the clash of ancient civilizations! 
A desperate true-life tale of a once-mighty entertainment medium, 
beset on all sides by ruthless new competitors, struggling to retain 
its viability! Sound vaguely familiar? It's ``Cleopatra,'' the megabudgeted 
four-hour ABC mini-series, brainchild of the flamboyant and free-spending 
producer Robert Halmi Sr., the king of big-budget television. Said 
spectacle is currently finishing a five-month shooting schedule in 
Morocco and England, among other exotic locales, and is scheduled 
to be broadcast on two nights during the vital May sweeps period. 
As even casual media buffs can tell you, the last and more famous 
``Cleopatra'' _ the megabudgeted 1963 motion picture starring Elizabeth 
Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison _ nearly bankrupted 20th Century 
Fox and brought a definitive halt to the hegemony of the major movie 
studios. But that's a portentous parallel that people in the network 
television business, particularly people like Susan Lyne, ABC's executive 
vice president for movies and mini-series, steadfastly refuse to draw. 
``It's material that stands out,'' she says of the $30 million television 
production, which stars Timothy Dalton as Julius Caesar, Billy Zane 
as Marc Antony and Leonor Varela, a French-Chilean actress, as the 
Queen of the Nile. ``And these days,'' adds Ms. Lyne, ``in order to 
attract attention, you have to give television audiences something 
big and different.'' In fact, ``big'' (if not, strictly speaking, 
different) is the rallying cry in the made-for-television-movie world 
these days. Staggeringly expensive epics are prime cannon fodder during 
sweeps periods, the thrice-yearly ratings matchups that determine 
advertising rates for the entire year. These mega-mini-series or mega-movies 
_ NBC calls them Big Events _ contain exotic locations, stellar international 
casts and/or lavish special effects. A majority contain all three. 
A typical two-hour network television movie costs $3 million; these 
cost approximately $12 million to $35 million each. This February, 
for instance, NBC has scheduled a three-hour ``Alice in Wonderland,'' 
starring Martin Short, Gene Wilder, Ben Kingsley and Whoopi Goldberg, 
among others. ABC has ``Stephen King's Storm of the Century,'' a six-hour 
horror story that the author wrote directly for television. In May, 
CBS will counter ``Cleopatra'' with ``Joan of Arc,'' now filming in 
Prague. NBC has tentatively scheduled ``Noah's Ark,'' starring Jon 
Voight, Mary Steenburgen and F. Murray Abraham, and ``Atomic Train,'' 
a disaster-suspense epic starring Rob Lowe and appropriately lavish 
special effects. ``Arabian Nights'' (ABC), to be filmed in Turkey 
and Yemen, and ``Aftershock''(CBS), about a major earthquake that 
hits New York City, are already in production for November 1999. Alone 
among the four major broadcast networks, Fox is currently out of the 
big-budget mini-series race. That decision can be traced to the frighteningly 
low ratings of ``Gargantua,'' an expensive horror movie that it presented 
last May. ``I think the networks believe they're getting their money's 
worth,'' says Mark Carliner, the producer who nudged the high end 
of the budget scale when overseeing ``Storm of the Century'' recently. 
Carliner, who previously produced the movies ``Stalin'' and ``George 
Wallace'' for HBO, spent $12 million on special effects and set construction. 
It cost $1.5 million, he says, to rebuild much of the business district 
of Southwest Harbor, Maine, inside a sugar beet storage facility near 
Toronto, in preparation for destroying large parts of the town in 
a giant wave pool in Tucson. That cost another $1 million. The mini-series 
has 60 speaking roles. The casting process took four months. ``Listen, 
it has to be an event,'' says Carliner. ``And in order for it to be 
an event, a lot of money has to be spent. If we get a huge tune-in, 
than ABC has six hours to promote other parts of its schedule.'' That's 
good, explains the producer, because in the last few years ABC, along 
with the other major networks, has lost large chunks of its traditional 
audience. ``Let's face it,'' he adds. ``These days, most people have 
no idea what's on ABC.'' Or on any of the networks. Indeed, when a 
mega-mini-series succeeds _ like NBC's medieval sword-and-sorcery 
epic ``Merlin,'' which had its premiere in last May's sweeps and attracted 
a spectacular 16.5 rating and 37 share _ it not only trounces the 
competition but rolls back, at least temporarily, the hordes of upstart 
diversions competing for American television viewers' leisure time. 
``We're not just competing with cable,'' says Lindy DeKoven, NBC's 
executive vice president for mini-series and movies for television. 
``Not just with 500 channels, and not just with the Internet. We're 
competing for people who are working longer hours and have less time 
and patience to tune in. ``The fact is, they'll come to see an episode 
of `Dateline' about the septuplets. They'll come to see Monica Lewinsky 
on `Barbara Walters.' They'll come for a spectacular mini-series. 
But will they come for just another episode of `Frasier'? I don't 
know.'' It's this kind of pressure, to create distinctive ``appointment 
television,'' that has caused networks and mini-series producers alike 
to attempt to outdo and outspend one another. Paradoxically, it has 
also tended to make each mega-mini more and more like its predecessors. 
For instance: gone, perhaps forever, are 9- or 13-part mini-series 
like ``Roots'' or ``War and Remembrance.'' Accepted wisdom is that 
committing to all those hours is simply too risky: if viewers tune 
out early, the networks are left with weeks of ratings poison. ``It's 
just hard for an audience to make that kind of a commitment,'' says 
Sunta Izzicupo, CBS senior vice president for movies for television 
and mini-series. ``And with the increase in costs it's just not economically 
feasible any longer.'' Also at a decided disadvantage are original 
stories by unknown writers, as opposed to historical-biblical epics, 
end-of-the-world scenarios and new renditions of oft-adapted literary 
classics. Ms. Lyne says, ``It helps if it's a story that people know 
_ and particularly love _ and that you're telling in a big way.'' 
Ms. Izzicupo says: ``An average person can tell you lots about Joan 
of Arc. She was young; she was French; it was long ago. She led an 
army, was divinely inspired, wore armor, was burned at the stake.'' 
Such a big head start with the audience, agrees Ms. Lyne, makes it 
simpler to create billboards, advertisements and on-air promotions, 
a prime consideration when staking so much on only a few precious 
hours. ``It makes it easier when you don't have to explain everything 
in a 30-second promo,'' she says. Ms. DeKoven says, flatly, ``I'd 
say I spend 80 percent of my time thinking about how to promote these 
projects.'' Not all that much time, however, is spent thinking about 
how to finance the more expensive mega-minis. To a surprisingly large 
extent, this chore is handled by the aforementioned Halmi. He was 
the progenitor and major force behind more than half the projects 
mentioned in this article, including ``Merlin,'' ``Noah's Ark,'' ``Arabian 
Nights'' and ``Alice in Wonderland,'' in addition to ``Cleopatra.'' 
``How do I pick my projects? I'll tell you, I just look at my bookshelf, 
which is pretty big and extensive, and I pick them as they come before 
my eyes,'' says Halmi, 74, by telephone from his office in London. 
``We've breathed a little bit of fresh air into stale network programming,'' 
he adds. ``And since they only have about 57 percent of the market 
now, they need that.'' Often described as an ``old-style showman,'' 
Halmi is something of a throwback to bygone movie moguls like Spyros 
Skouras, Darryl Zanuck and Sam Spiegel. Asked why he makes his mini-series 
in such remote and inaccessible locations, he replies, ``If I make 
it in the back lot, it smells of the back lot.'' A former member of 
the Hungarian resistance and, after World War II, a photographer for 
Life magazine, Halmi began producing television movies and mini-series 
in the 1970s. In 1994 Halmi's production company was bought by Hallmark, 
the privately held greeting card and entertainment company. Hallmark 
is majority owner of the Odyssey Channel, a domestic cable network, 
and Hallmark Entertainment Networks, an international pay-television 
service. After Halmi's mega-minis are shown on the American networks 
(typically for a license fee of only about one-third of their cost), 
they are sold internationally, then reserved for use as programming 
on their own networks. ``We will end up making lots of money,'' he 
says. ``Believe me.'' In 1995 Halmi approached NBC with his first 
pitch for a star- and-special-effects-laden fable, and with some trepidation 
the network agreed to make ``Gulliver's Travels,'' starring Ted Danson. 
In February 1996, it won an impressive 29 share of the audience. In 
May 1997, Halmi's production of ``The Odyssey'' hit a homer, as one 
weekly magazine put it. Then came ``Merlin,'' and the other networks 
opened the floodgates. But such proliferation may lead to problems. 
A serious one, say industry executives, is that not every expensive 
mega-mini-series, not even every Robert Halmi mega-mini-series, is 
a success. Last October his production of ``Crime and Punishment,'' 
filmed in Budapest and starring Ben Kingsley, Julie Delpy and Patrick 
Dempsey, finished fourth in its time period. Of course, dismissive 
reviews didn't help either. Another danger is viewer saturation. ``I 
stay up nights wondering how we're going to top ourselves next time,'' 
admits Ms. DeKoven. And how many times will they have to rebuild ancient 
civilizations? All of his sweeps wins are fine as far as they go, 
maintains Halmi, ``but one or two mini-series a year won't make anything 
happen.'' ``The networks have to think of the in-between times,'' 
he says. ``They'll have to enter new dimensions. They'll have to be 
creative. And they'll have to spend more money.''
