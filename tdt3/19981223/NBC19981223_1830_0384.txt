Still ahead -- a first for the U.S. military. "In depth" tonight -- 
I did what I had to do. I hit my target and was able to do what the 
military asked me to do. Women on a mission in the Persian gulf, and 
making history. And the secret life of your Christmas tree. Where'd 
it come from? How old is it? You might be surprised. A ouncing an 
amazing discovery. One-A-day has combined the power of herbs with 
vitamins... to help you during the cold season. Support your mood, 
even memory. New from one-A-day. Just what you need... to feel your 
best.
