Another new study shows that banning smoking in the work place improves 
the respiratory health of employees. In 1994, the state of California 
prohibited smoking in bars and taverns, among the world's most smoke-filled 
work places. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, 
published the results of their study of 53 bartenders, in a recent 
issue of the "Journal of the American Medical Association." Lead researcher, 
Dr. Mike Arsner, says the study confirms the benefits of "no smoking" 
legislation. The experience reduced respiratory symptoms, such as 
coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, and the experiences of 
significant improvement of lung function. So, I think the most important 
message is that creating smoke-free work places benefits workers over 
a fairly short time period.
