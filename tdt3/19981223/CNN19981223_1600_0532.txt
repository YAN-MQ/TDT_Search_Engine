This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for later today. Snowfall, ice, rain, all continue in 
parts of the southeast. Much of the nation continues in the deep freeze, 
but it's in the south where we're seeing travel problems with slick 
roads due to the ice associated with the moisture overriding this 
cold air. Then as the rainfall falls through the cold air, it begins 
to freeze. You can see it's gonna continue to be a problem right through 
tomorrow night. Although conditions are expected to improve by tomorrow, 
things will begin to warm just a little bit in the south. But much 
of the nation is very cold today. As you can see, the upper midwest, 
the plains states, in the single digits for high temperatures today. 
We take a look at our extended forecast. You can see that things tend 
to warm just a little bit by Friday. We move on into Saturday, and 
a big storm continues to roll in through the northwestern portion 
of the United States. And on Sunday, temperatures continue to moderate 
throughout much of the nation. For more weather information, log onto
