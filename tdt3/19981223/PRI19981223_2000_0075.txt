For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in London. 
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will strike 
back after a rocket attack by Hezbollah guerrillas from Lebanon. Several 
Israelis were injured. The Hezbollah attack followed yesterday's Israeli 
air raid on eastern Lebanon. A Lebanese woman and six of her children 
died. Israel has apologized for what it calls "human error." Prime 
Minister Netanyahu says there is no parallel between a tragic mistake 
and a deliberate intention to kill. What happened here today was not 
an accident, because Hezbollah terrorists deliberately shot right 
into this village rockets that could have killed many people and, 
for the grace of God, they didn't. Benjamin Netanyahu. Hezbollah says 
the Israeli attack is part of an ongoing pattern. It says Israel constantly 
violates the April 1996 understanding that both parties would not 
target civilians. Hezbollah spokesman Ibrahim Moussawi says the violations 
cannot be ignored. We were targeting the settlements on the northern 
border of Palestine just to tell them that they cannot target our 
civilians and escape without punishment. Hezbollah spokesman Ibrahim 
Moussawi.
