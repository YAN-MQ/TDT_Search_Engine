Berlin prosecutors said Wednesday they were investigating a letter 
claiming responsibility for a weekend bomb blast at the grave of a 
German Jewish leader. In the letter, sent to prosecutors and a Berlin 
newspaper, the alleged perpetrator denies any extreme-right political 
motive, claiming he wanted mainly to protest against the renaming 
of a Berlin street after the late leader, Heinz Galinski. Justice 
Department spokesman Matthias Rebentisch declined to release any more 
details, saying only that the letter was being examined to determine 
if it is authentic. The Saturday night bombing at a Jewish cemetery 
in western Berlin stirred nationwide shock. The homemade bomb destroyed 
a marble slab marking Galinski's grave. Galinski headed Germany's 
Central Council of Jews from 1988 until his death in 1992. He had 
headed Berlin's Jewish community since 1949. An official in the Berlin 
district of Wedding, where a street near the Jewish Hospital was renamed 
Nov. 27, said there were a few protests at the time, including unfriendly 
letters. ``One of them was in a language very reminiscent of '33,'' 
Hans Nisble said, referring to the year the Nazis took power in Germany. 
But he said there was no known far-right scene in Wedding. Police 
have offered a 20,000 mark (dlrs 12,000) reward for information in 
the bombing.
