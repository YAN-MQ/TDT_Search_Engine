The United States says it will withdraw many of its deadliest bombers 
and thousands of its troops from the Persian Gulf. Defense Secretary, 
William Cohen, made the announcement today, during a stopover in Saudi 
Arabia, at the start of a two-day visit of U.S. forces in the Gulf. 
Mr. Cohen told reporters that there would be enough U.S. troops and 
equipment to strike Baghdad, if Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, threatened 
U.S. allies in the region. Meanwhile, many of the U.S. troops and 
planes that rushed to the Gulf for recent air strikes on Iraq, have 
been ordered to go home. But, Defense Secretary, William Cohen, Washington 
will keep a strong force in the Gulf, just in case Baghdad threatens 
its neighbors. VOA's Jim Malone reports. Mr. Cohen's comments came 
as he visited U.S. troops in the Gulf, just days after they launched 
hundreds of air strikes against Iraq. He told reporters, thousands 
of troops, and dozens of planes, are being sent home soon, including 
B-52 heavy bombers that launched cruise missiles at targets across 
Iraq. Meantime, the aircraft carrier, Enterprise, which launched many 
of the attack jets that struck Iraq, will soon head for the Mediterranean 
on routine patrol. Mr. Cohen is scheduled to greet U.S. military personnel 
in Saudi Arabia and on the Enterprise, and talk to some Gulf leaders, 
all part of a two-day visit to the area. Mr. Cohen's orders will cut 
the U.S. Gulf force from nearly 30,000 to less than 22,000 U.S. troops.
