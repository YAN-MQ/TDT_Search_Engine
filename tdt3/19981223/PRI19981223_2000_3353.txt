Manu Chao's single "Bongo Bong" puts the wraps on this edition of 
our program. Don't forget The World is online at www.theworld.org. 
In Boston, I'm Lisa Mullins. Please join us again tomorrow for another 
spin of The World. Mama was queen of the mambo. Papa was king of the 
congo. Deep down in the jungle, I start banging my first bongo. Every 
monkey like to be in my place instead of me. 'Cause I'm the king of 
bongo, baby. I'm the king of bongo bong. I went to the big town, where 
there is a lot of sound. From the jungle to the seedy looking for 
a bigger crown. So I play my boogie for the people of big city, but 
they don't go crazy when I'm banging on my boogie... He love the bongo. 
He love the bongo. Hear me when I come, baby. The World is a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, Public Radio International and WGBH Boston 
and is made possible in part by the PRI Program Fund, whose contributors 
include the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation, the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation and the Charles Stewart 
Mott Foundation.
