In Indian Cashmere, police say separatist's guerrillas have killed 
nine civilians in pre-dawn attacks. VOA New Delhi correspondent, Dr. 
Spacian, has that story. Police say the killings took place in Kohl 
Dahm,, a village 70 kilometers from Srinagar, the summer capitol of 
Indian Cashmere. The victims were relatives of guerrillas who had 
surrendered to authorities, over the years, under a government to 
rehabilitate guerrilla fighters. No group immediately claimed responsibility, 
but police blame Muslim separatists waging a decade-long fight against 
Indian rule in Cashmere. Other details were not immediately available. 
Indian Pakistan had fought two wars over Cashmere, a disputed territory 
that is divided between them. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of arming 
and training separatist guerrillas operating in Indian Cashmere. Pakistan 
denies this, and says it gives them only political support. The armies 
of both nations occupy heavily fortified positions on both sides of 
the cease-fire line that divides Cashmere, and there are periodic 
outbreaks of shelling along the boundary. Despite many attempts at 
negotiations, over the years, India and Pakistan have not been able 
to resolve the Cashmere dispute. Pakistan favors the United Nations 
plebiscite in which Cashmeres would choose to join India or Pakistan. 
New Delhi views Cashmere as part of India. Analysts have long expressed 
concern that Cashmere could spark a wider conflict between India and 
Pakistan. Both nations tested nuclear devises in May. Douglas Vaction,
