Flight controllers for three balloonists, trying to become the first 
to circle the globe non-stop, said the trio should depart Chinese 
airspace in a few hours. Richard Branson, Steve Fawcett, and Tera 
Lindstrom, are expected to reach the Yellow Sea and cross to South 
Korea and Japan before beginning a long eastward flight across the 
Pacific Ocean. The high-flying trio ran into political difficulties, 
on Tuesday, when their balloon strayed from an air corridor assigned 
by Chinese authorities. At one point, Chinese officials ordered the 
crew to land in Chinese-controlled, Tibet. But, later rescinded the 
order after the flurry of negotiations with British and American diplomats.
