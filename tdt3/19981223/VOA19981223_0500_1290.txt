The International Tennis Federation says Peter Corda, of the Czech 
Republic, tested positive for the steroid, Nandrelone, in a routine 
testing done at Wimpleton, last July. The substance is banned by the 
ITF. The ITF has stripped Corda of his ranking points, and taken away

take the drug, and said no further penalties would be imposed. And
