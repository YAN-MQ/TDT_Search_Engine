The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Dec. 24: As 1998 
ends, Long Island residents can breathe easy about one thing: They 
won't have William J. Catacosinos to worry about anymore. Catacosinos, 
the former chairman of the Long Island Lighting Co., or Lilco, became 
a figure of scorn on Long Island as his company came to be known for 
high electric rates. A complicated transaction, in which Lilco merged 
into the parent of Brooklyn Union Gas while a state agency bought 
some of the company's assets, was supposed to end the controversy. 
Instead, it only intensified the furor. Catacosinos had a contract 
whose generosity soon became infamous. Although the essentials of 
his deal had been disclosed in regulatory filings, it was not completely 
understood either by state officials or by those of Keyspan Energy, 
the Brooklyn Union parent. The deal gave Catacosinos $42 million in 
cash _ much of it provided under a golden parachute. Such parachutes 
normally protect executives who lose their jobs. But Catacosinos got 
the money even though he was staying on as chairman and chief executive 
of the merged company. After embarrassed state officials cried foul, 
he was forced out of the new job, although he got to keep his office, 
along with a car and driver, until July 31, 1999. Now, in the final 
insult to shareholders, he has negotiated a deal that will allow him 
to keep those perks for another year, until July 31, 2000. The company 
will put up $25,000 to buy furniture for him, and will pay rent on 
an office away from company property. In return, he agreed not to 
have anything to do with any effort to take over Keyspan. The money 
for the payments to Catacosinos came from Keyspan, whose shareholders 
have seen the value of their investment fall since the Lilco transaction 
was completed. It is they who have suffered as a result of Catacosinos' 
greed and the poor job done by officials from the state and Keyspan 
in negotiating terms of the merger.
