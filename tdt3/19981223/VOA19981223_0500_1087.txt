The ball will bounce, no more, in the women's American Basketball 
League. The organization announced, Tuesday, it's halted operations 
for the season, and has filed for bankruptcy. The nine-team league 
was in it's third season of play and had completed about one-third 
of the current season when it shut down operations. The ABL has struggled, 
financially. And, it's had much trouble competing with the rival WNBA, 
which is fueled with the national and advertising support from the 
National Basketball Association.
