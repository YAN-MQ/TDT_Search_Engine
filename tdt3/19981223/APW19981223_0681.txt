More than 29,000 children in Ukraine stayed home from school Wednesday 
because teachers across the country have joined a strike to protest 
unpaid wages, the Education Ministry said. Nearly 2,500 teachers at 
44 schools in four Ukrainian regions were protesting Wednesday, more 
than double the number on strike last week. Of these, 28 schools already 
have been closed for nearly two months, the ministry said. Scattered 
protests involving thousands of the former Soviet republic's 500,000 
teachers began at the start of the school year in September. Wage 
debts have continued their steady rise despite the protests, reaching 
456 million hryvna (dlrs 133 million) as of last week, the ministry 
said. The debt could further increase after the New Year because extra 
money will have to be allocated to provide heating for schools in 
many rural areas, education officials say. Ukraine's government has 
chronic problems in collecting taxes, leaving it without money to 
pay huge wage debts.
