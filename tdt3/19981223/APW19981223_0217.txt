The NATO-led peace force in Bosnia removed Croatian police from a 
disputed area along Bosnia's western border to Croatia, NATO announced 
on Wednesday. Bosnia and Croatia are currently negotiating to define 
the border near Martin Brod, a small town in Bosnia, some 220 kilometers 
(150 miles) west of Sarajevo. Martin Brod was considered part of Bosnia 
before the 1991-1995 war but since the fighting ended, Croatian authorities 
have moved the border deeper into Bosnia. When they returned to the 
area after fighting stopped, many of the residents of Martin Brod 
found their homes or land on the other side of the border, in Croatia 
and they were blocked from returning by Croatian border police. Bosnia's 
top international official, Carlos Westendorp, sent a letter to both 
countries saying until the two border commissions agree on the frontier, 
he will consider the pre-war demarcation line to be valid. In response 
to a request from Westendorp's office, the NATO-led peace force removed 
the Croatian police without any incident, a NATO press release said. 
``The territory is now under the jurisdiction of the Federation police,'' 
the statement said.
