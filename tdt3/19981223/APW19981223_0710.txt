Nearly 50 Nepalese protesters Wednesday burned photographs of an Indian 
actress who in a radio interview said the Himalayan nation was once 
part of India. They gathered outside Madhuri Dixit's hotel and demanded 
that she apologize for the comments made Tuesday. The actress is visiting 
Katmandu for the release of an album from her new movie. Dixit's costar 
in the movie, Akshay Kumar, apologized to the crowd for Dixit's comments. 
Nepal, a predominantly Hindu nation, was never part of India. Police 
later dispersed the protesters. Indian film stars are revered in Nepal 
where most theaters run Hindi language movies.
