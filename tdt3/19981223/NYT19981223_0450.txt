The National Basketball Association is like a chain of 29 franchised 
stores arrayed strategically nationwide, each catering to a different 
market, each hoping to sell out its inventory of seats. The chain's 
employees earn unusually high salaries, but, in turn, the 29 outlets 
can charge steep prices to watch their costumed workers perform in 
glitzy arenas or on television. But the nearly six-month-old lockout 
has altered the chain's business. The stores are closed, the employees 
are not being paid and advance ticket revenues must be refunded on 
a prorated basis each month. The only bright spot for team finances 
is the combined $465 million being paid by NBC and Turner Sports, 
the league's national television partners, even if the season is shuttered. 
The financial health of the NBA's teams has been at the crux of the 
league's negotiating stance as it presses for something resembling 
cost certainty. The NBA has claimed financial distress for some of 
its franchises and seeks relief in a restructured contract with the 
players. But in an industry generating $2 billion annually, and with 
most team finances unavailable to the public, it is difficult to discern 
exactly where the problems are. The league and the players union disagree 
on how many teams are losing money, but only two teams, the Boston 
Celtics and the San Antonio Spurs, make their finances public. The 
Celtics are a public company and the privately owned Spurs released 
their statement in a so-far-unsuccessful bid to get city government 
financing for a new arena to replace the five-year-old Alamodome. 
Last season, the Celtics missed the playoffs under coach Rick Pitino 
but still earned $12.3 million on revenues of $75.7 million. Sparked 
by the return of center David Robinson and the addition of the rookie 
Tim Duncan, the Spurs returned to the playoffs, but lost $1.8 million 
on revenues of $65.9 million. Without the playoff revenue, the Spurs' 
loss would have been $3.9 million. The largest difference in the teams' 
revenues was derived from ticket sales: The Celtics collected $39.1 
million (which may include luxury-suite income, but the statement 
is not explicit) compared with the Spurs' $24.3 million. The Spurs' 
and Celtics' figures are normal for NBA teams _ greater than unsuccessful 
teams with lower payrolls like the Los Angeles Clippers, but less 
than what the Chicago Bulls reap and spend, several sports finance 
experts said. Forbes magazine estimated the Bulls' 1997-98 revenues 
at $112.2 million and operating profit at $8.6 million, while the 
Knicks made $18.3 million on $109.7 million in revenues. The Clippers 
took in $39.3 million, but lost $4.9 million. ``The Celtics are a 
typical big-market team, but they're just another tenant in an arena, 
and the Spurs are similar, in a small market,'' said Michael Ozanian, 
statistics editor of Forbes magazine. In the case of the Celtics and 
the Spurs, neither owns the arena they play in. Teams like the Bulls, 
Knicks, Philadelphia 76ers, Detroit Pistons, Washington Wizards and 
Portland Trail Blazers have the advantages of earning revenues from 
other events like hockey and circuses, while paying no rent to a city 
or county. ``For some, a lot of revenue is tied to paying off debt 
service to build the arena, and the other events were supposed to 
be gravy,'' Ozanian said. ``Someone like Abe Pollin has a lot of debt, 
and what was gravy isn't the case now.'' Pollin owns the year-old 
MCI Center, the Wizards and the Washington Capitals. The Knicks and 
the 76ers have the added edge in also being part of the same company 
that carries their games on cable television. The companies are now 
losing out by not being able to sell lucrative commercial advertising 
to their teams' games. The Celtics reported TV and radio revenues 
of $28 million, $11.4 million from NBC. The rest came from Turner 
Sports, and local radio and TV deals. The Spurs received $14.7 million 
from NBC and Turner, and $18.7 million more from local media rights 
and arena advertising, the latter an unusually steep figure for a 
team in one of the league's smallest markets that also plays in an 
arena without a corporate name attached to it. Although the Celtics 
did not itemize what they received from royalties from the national 
licensing that they split with all other teams, the Spurs revealed 
their share to be $2.9 million. The Spurs, who receive 80 percent 
of the revenues from the city-owned Alamodome's luxury suites and 
club seats, reaped about $2 million from that lucrative area. Suite 
revenues at the Fleet Center in Boston are divided among the Celtics, 
the Bruins and debt payments; the Celtics may have included that income 
in ticket sales. For both teams, the largest expense is salaries. 
The Celtics reported $43 million in total basketball expenses, most 
of which is paid to their players; the Spurs' reported a $34.9 million 
payroll, led by the $12.4 million paid to Robinson. But a comparison 
of the Celtics and the Spurs presents an anomaly. While Boston is 
the sixth-largest market, three times larger than San Antonio, the 
Spurs' $67.7 million in expenses is greater than the Celtics' $61.9 
million. ``Keep in mind, whether it's a small market or a big one, 
teams are competing in the same market for players,'' said Paul Much, 
managing director of Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, an investment 
banking firm in Chicago. ``And while big-market teams usually have 
bigger revenues, they usually have higher expenses.'' Although the 
players are not getting paid during the lockout, coaches, executives 
and other employees will continue to be. To cut down expenses, teams 
will almost certainly lay off workers if the season is canceled. The 
Celtics must pay one unusually high salary during the lockout _ Pitino's. 
Even if Pitino doesn't coach a game this season, his contract to be 
coach, president and director of basketball operations calls for annual 
salaries of $6.75 million through May 6, 2003, and $2 million annually 
through 2007. The team will also keep paying Red Auerbach, its former 
coach and general manager. Now a consultant, Auerbach receives $250,000 
a year for life; he got bonuses of $500,000, $600,000 and $100,000 
in each of the past three years. Although all teams will have to pay 
ongoing expenses if the season is canceled, the Celtics and the Spurs 
won't have to pay rent to their landlords. The Celtics' Fleet Center 
lease requires no rent payments, while the Spurs' payment of $5,000 
a game is not required if the team doesn't play. But the Seattle SuperSonics 
and the Golden State Warriors are in rent disputes at the Key Arena 
and the New Arena in Oakland, Calif., respectively, and disagree over 
whether their leases require them to pay rent even if they don't play. 
The city of Seattle may lose $4.8 million if the NBA cancels the season. 
``We could go to arbitration, but after Jan. 1, we'll sit down and 
try to negotiate,'' said Sue Donaldson, the Seattle City Council president. 
``We feel the team has an obligation to pay, whether they play games 
or not.'' The Warriors' quarterly rent of $375,000, and other payments, 
are needed to repay the debt incurred by the county for $100 million 
in arena renovations. The team and Alameda County will go to arbitration 
next month to settle their dispute, said Kyle Spencer, a Warriors 
spokesman, over what the team thinks is a lease clause that absolves 
it from paying rent during a work stoppage.
