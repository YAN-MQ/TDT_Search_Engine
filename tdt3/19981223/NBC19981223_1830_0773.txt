"Operation desert fox," whether it was a mission accomplished still 
is subject to some debate. But one thing is a matter for the record 
books now. The first American women Navy aviators to fly combat bombing 
missions. We begin "in depth" tonight with Ron Allen on board the 
carrier "USS enterprise." Through four nights of intensive bombardment, 
a military milestone. Four female aviators flying combat strike missions 
missions from the deck of the "USS enterprise." Navy fighter pilot 
lieutenant kendra Williams of Anchorage, Alaska, always dreamed of 
flying into battle like her father, a Vietnam veteran. She took the 
controls of an F-18 during the first wave of "operation desert fox." 
I went out and did what I was asked to do. I hit my target and was 
able to do what the military asked me to do. Another female aviator, 
Andrea quy, also in the middle of the fight. After completing her 
mission, she E-mailed her family in Apple Valley, minnesota, to say 
she was back safely. It was incredible. And, yes, they were shooting. 
We are finally using the training we went through. Everyone thinks 
it's a big deal, also because it's the first few women in combat. 
Today, defense secretary William Cohen honored the 6,300 men and women 
on board the "enterprise" responsible for more than half the strike 
missions of "desert fox." Thank you for your dedication, your patriotism 
and your professionalism and the way you carried out this operation 
against Saddam Hussein's forces. You were fantastic. The secretary 
celebrated with the troops and announced the "Enterprise" will soon 
leave the gulf and many of America's deadliest bombers will pull back. 
The Pentagon says that still leaves more than enough firepower to 
strike saddam again. For secretary Cohen, this is the easy part. The 
difficult mission lies back on shore, convincing America's allies 
in the region who gave very limited support to "operation desert fox" 
that bombing Iraq was the right thing to do. No question for pilot 
kendra Williams. We're proud of ourselves. We had a good time. We 
did our job well, and we're proud of that fact. Savoring what the 
Navy calls a victory, preparing tonight to sail on to the Mediterranean, 
and waiting for the next call to arms. Ron Allen, NBC news, aboard 
the "USS enterprise."
