As the Senate prepares to try President Clinton on two articles of 
impeachment, some people on Capitol Hill are endorsing alternatives 
from removing him from office. Bob Franken reports on the public and 
frifd discussions on what to do. Sources tell CNN, there are more 
than a dozen house republican moderates who now want the Senate to 
adopt a punishment of president clinton short of removal from office 
even though they voted for impeachment. Bob franks has already come 
forward. Franks issued a statement supporting the call by former presidents 
Ford and carter for -- "A bipartisan censure resolution." But, "the 
president must acknowledge that he lied under oath." Something President 
Clinton has steadfastly refused to do. Franks joins four other republican 
congressmen -- Boehlert, Gilman, greenwood and castle, who sent a 
letter to senator Trent Lott suggesting that "A remedy short of removal 
is in order." Some senators were quick to dismiss the statement from 
democratic senator robert Byrd in which he called on -- "the White 
House or any entity beyond the current membership of the Senate" to 
stay out of the censure negotiations. I think it would be pretty hard 
to do this, the censure route, without talking at all with the White 
House, the people who are going to be censured. Although there are 
no formal negotiations, sources tell CNN friends of the president 
are soliciting ideas for a censure proposal from so-called "political 
elders" from both parties. One who was asked says "I think this man," 
meaning President Clinton, "will have to be publicly humiliated, beyond 
impeachment." With maximum news coverage, including live television.
