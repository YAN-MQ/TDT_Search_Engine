Aaa has released its list of best cars, minivans and sport utility 
vehicles. Ed Garsten has the winners. The aaa rated vehicles based 
on value, performance and safety and named its top choices in 11 categories. 
The top sedan under $30,000 is the Chevy Malibu. It's surprisingly 
agile, it's easy to get in and out of. It holds a lot of cargo, and 
it's certainly priced right. But the aaa says the Oldsmobile intrigue 
and Acura 3.2tl are also good choices in that price range. In the 
$30,000 to $35,000 range, the BMW 328i scored best. It's well balanced, 
it's muscular, it's luxurious. It does everything right. In the $35,000 
to $40,000 price bracket, the Saab 9-5 wagon was tops, according to 
the aaa. The wagon boasts superior styling and a unique cargo handling 
system -- not a wagon, not a car, not even a truck, but a little of 
each. The Subaru forester was the top sport utility vehicle under 
$25,000. Over $25,000, the completely restyled Jeep grand Cherokee, 
which offers a Larger load area than previous models. And the top 
minivan was the Ford windstar, with side air bags, remote-powered 
side sliding door and backup warning system. The best vehicle overall, 
regardless of price or category, was the Mercedes s500. Even at 50 
grand, a good value, says the aaa. Now, it has a more powerful engine. 
It's lighter, and it's more economical. And it has a whole host of 
safety and convenience features. To come up with its ratings, the 
aaa tested more than 180 cars, minivans and station wagons, putting 
them through 20 separate tests. Ed Garsten, CNN, Detroit.
