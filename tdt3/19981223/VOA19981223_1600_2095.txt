President Clinton says he will ask Congress to increase Federal assistance 
to the homeless by 15 percent, to $1.12 billion, next year. During 
a visit to a boys' and girls' club in Baltimore Maryland, the president 
said he would present the proposal to Congress next month. If we can 
persuade the Congress to enact it, it will be the largest effort to 
combat homelessness in the history of America. And, it will be done 
within the balanced budget. The announcement was the president's first 
public policy statement since being impeached by Congress, last Saturday.
