'twas the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a 
Creature was stirring, not even a mouse. President Clinton is in the 
holiday spirit, despite his latest legal woes. He and first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton read stories and Sang Christmas carols with about 50 
children at the White House today. Highlights included Mr. Clinton 
reading the popular Christmas poem, "A visit from St. Nicholas," with 
a little help from the kids.
