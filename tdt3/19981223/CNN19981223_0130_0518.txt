With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
Taking you from Wednesday into Thursday morning, there could be an 
icy mixture all the way from the arklotex region into the lower Appalachians. 
All the way from Dallas to Huntsville, into Charlotte, North Carolina, 
could see some freezing rain or some ice. As far as temperatures are 
concerned, 20s all the way down into Texas. Could see a half-inch 
accumulation of ice in Dallas. Fairbanks, Alaska, is expecting a high 
temperature of 10, while breezy conditions will prevail across the 
Hawaiian islands, and wet and windy through portions of the Caribbean. 
In our extended forecast, the icy conditions still linger across the 
southeastern United States, so watch out, it's gonna be slow going 
on those roads. Going into Friday, temperatures rebound just a bit 
across the south-central plains, but heavy rain begins to push into 
the pacific northwest on christmas day, with more icy conditions still 
possible in the southeast and the mid-atlantic. By Saturday, a nice 
rebound for the south-central U.S. for more weather information, log 
on to CNN.com.
