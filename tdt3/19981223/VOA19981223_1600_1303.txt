The post-season college football bowl season continues, later today, 
when the Marshall thundering herd squares off against the Louisville 
Cardinals in the Motor City Bowl. The game in Pontiac, Michigan., 
in the Silver Dome will feature two hard-throwing quarterbacks. Louisville's 
Chris Redman, passed for more than 4,000 yards in 29 touchdowns, this 
season. Chad Pennington, of Marshall, fired the ball for more than 
3,400 yards and 24 touchdowns. The thundering herd ended its season 
with 11 wins and 1 loss, while Louisville was 7 and 4. That's sports. 
I'm Jim Stevenson.
