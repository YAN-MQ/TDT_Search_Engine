President Clinton practiced charity and pleaded for mercy Wednesday 
in his first foray out of Washington since the House impeached him 
Saturday. The president announced $850 million in federal grants for 
programs for the homeless at a gymnasium in a public housing project 
here Wednesday. He received long standing ovations from an audience 
of Democratic officeholders, welfare officials and African-American 
clergy members when he entered the room and when he rose to speak. 
Drawing political lessons from Scripture, Clinton urged both his allies 
and his adversaries to remember that the Bible teaches that charity 
is not a virtue but an obligation. And, ruminating on the true spirit 
of Christmas at a particularly trying time, the president said that 
charity ``doesn't really mean go out and give a bunch of money to 
poor people so you can feel righteous.'' ``It means,'' Clinton continued, 
``what it really means, is whether you're tall or short, whether you're 
fat or thin, whether you're black, brown or white, whether you look 
like a movie star or a person who had one boxing match too many, whatever 
the different circumstances of your life are, inside each of us there 
is a core that is the same and not one person is better than another.'' 
Clinton, wearing a red tie with Christmas designs, asked that he be 
judged as ``no better than, but, thank God, no worse than'' anybody 
else. As the president's aides and lawyers begin discussions that 
they hope will lead the Senate to censure him rather than eject him 
from office, Clinton has spent the past several days reflecting on 
the quality of mercy, which seems in scant supply in the capital lately. 
Since his impeachment, Clinton has served lasagna in a Washington 
soup kitchen, led a prayer service on the 10th anniversary of the 
downing of Pan Am 103 and read ``A Visit from Saint Nick'' in a slow 
sing-song to a group of schoolchildren in the garlanded East Room 
of the White House. He belatedly began his Christmas shopping Wednesday 
with a stop at a Peace Corps boutique in downtown Washington. His 
evenings have been filled with the obligatory holiday parties at the 
White House, several of which the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
sat out because of a pulled back muscle, aides said. In words and 
pictures, Clinton is trying to convey an image of a humble and a contrite 
soul resigned to his fate. At a holiday party Sunday evening, he told 
Los Angeles Times reporter Elizabeth Shogren that he was working to 
purge the anger from his heart and trying to follow South African 
President Nelson Mandela's example of turning the other cheek to his 
tormentors. Clinton has told friends that he believes the House impeachment 
process was deeply unfair and blindly partisan. He freely expresses 
both his anger and his remorse, often in the same breath, one close 
friend said. He is confident that he will prevail in Senate trial 
if no censure deal is reached in advance, this friend said. And he 
will not resign, everyone around him asserts without qualification. 
From Saturday's display of party unity on the White House South Lawn 
after the impeachment vote to Wednesday's announcement of new financing 
for the homeless, Clinton has surrounded himself with Democrats and 
children, who provide a shield of sorts against the harsh winds of 
political judgment. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., was among the party 
leaders who shared the dais with Clinton at Wednesday's event at Pleasantview 
Gardens, a Baltimore public housing project. ``We have not forgotten 
that in the midst of your personal difficulties,'' Cummings said, 
looking at the president, ``you continue to work hard every day. Please 
remember our faith in you.'' Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, a Democrat, 
joined Cummings in bemoaning the bitter partisanship that he said 
had seized Washington. ``The divisiveness we have seen the past few 
weeks is unhealthy for our country and our democracy,'' Glendening 
said. ``We need you at the helm.''
