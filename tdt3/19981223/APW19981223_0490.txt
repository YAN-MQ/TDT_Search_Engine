Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, on a visit to Kazakstan, 
said Wednesday that his country will repay all its debts, but would 
need to restructure them because of the country's economic crisis. 
``Russia will not declare default, we have no intention of declaring 
default,'' Primakov said in Kazakstan's capital Astana. ``Russia will 
pay all debts, both internal and external.'' But he stressed that 
the government would seek to reschedule its obligations. ``Russia 
is interested in debt restructuring,'' Primakov told reporters. Russia 
faces dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debts that fall due next year, 
but the government has only earmarked dlrs 9.5 billion for foreign 
debt servicing and wants to reschedule the remainder with creditors. 
After the latest economic crisis hit in August, the government stopped 
making payments on dlrs 40 billion worth of treasury bills. Creditors 
regarded this as a default, and restructuring negotiations are still 
underway. The government badly needs new loans from the International 
Monetary Fund and other lenders to pay off its debts. It has included 
dlrs 7.5 billion in foreign loans in next year's proposed budget, 
although there's no guarantee they will materialize. The World Bank 
on Tuesday promised to release a dlrs 400 million loan for repairs 
and construction on Russia's vast road system, but said that it wouldn't 
release dlrs 950 million in promised loans for economic restructuring, 
social security and the coal industry until at least March. The IMF 
and other lenders say a sound federal budget is a key condition for 
granting new loans. They also urge the government to more effectively 
combat tax-dodging that remains widespread. Deputy Prime Minister 
Valentina Matviyenko on Wednesday acknowledged that a huge share of 
the economy has remained out of reach of the tax collector. ``The 
amount of money spent by the population is two to three times higher 
than the official incomes,'' she said at a news conference. Parliament 
is generally supportive of Primakov's government and have indicated 
that the next year's budget could win a quicker approval without bitter 
debates of recent years that dragged out for months. However, there 
are still plenty of opponents. ``The budget stands no chance to win 
approval in its current shape,'' Eduard Rossel, the governor of the 
industrial Yekaterinburg region in the Ural Mountains, told a news 
conference Wednesday. He ruled out a quick passage of the budget, 
saying the government will have to listen to regional leaders who 
don't want to see their share of the budget cut. Also Wednesday, Russia's 
parliament again turned down a proposed land code that would have 
allowed increased land sales, including the sale of some farmland. 
President Boris Yeltsin supported the measure, but the Communists 
and other hard-liners in parliament want to keep most land, and farm 
land in particular, in state hands. Meanwhile, Primakov held talks 
with Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev and agreed to increase the 
amount of Kazak oil going through Russian territory and reduce Russian 
railway tariffs for Kazak goods. Relations are generally good, despite 
some tension in the past over the alleged discrimination against ethnic 
Russians in Kazakstan and a dispute over mutual debts.
