Libya has dismissed President Clinton's recent threats of more sanctions. 
Washington wants Libya to hand over the two suspects in the Pan Am 
bombing by February or further sanctions will be imposed. The BBC's 
Jim Muir has more. Libyan foreign minister, Omar Muntasser, twice 
said that Libya wanted the two men to be tried before a neutral court. 
This was apparent confirmation of Colonel Khadafy's suggestion earlier 
this week that the court should be international and involve judges 
from Libya, Britain, America and elsewhere. It's a major departure 
from what's on offer from London and Washington -- namely, that the 
trial should be held before Scottish judges under Scottish law but 
convened at a specially arranged site in The Netherlands. The Libyan 
foreign minister said Libya would not submit to American threats.
