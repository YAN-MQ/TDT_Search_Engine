Much more news still to come on The World. Don't forget you can check 
us out anytime in cyberspace at www.theworld.org. This is The World 
on PRI, Public Radio International. I'm Lisa Mullins. Still to come 
on The World, crossfire along the Israeli-Lebanese border and the 
threat of revenge from Benjamin Netanyahu. Also, the growing problem 
of air rage and the values of a Franco-Spanish post punk rocker. I 
could die tomorrow. I'm full. I love my life. Now I can make music. 
I don't care if I sell or I not sell. First, this news.
