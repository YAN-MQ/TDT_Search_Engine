Half the runway lights were not working when a Thai Airways jet crashed, 
killing 101 people in a nighttime rainstorm two weeks ago, an airport 
official said on Wednesday. ``Even now they're not working. Something 
in the electrical system broke down and our electricians have said 
we're still waiting for imported parts before it can be fixed,'' said 
Pratiyudh Boonrod, Executive Director of Administration at Surat Thani 
airport where the crash took place. ``But we notified every airline, 
so the pilot should have known,''he said. Waravuth Siri-oat, an electrician 
at Surat Thani airport, was quoted in Wednesday's The Nation newspaper 
as saying that half the lights being shut off should not have affected 
the visibility of the runway. The runway lights are 60 meters (198 
feet) apart. With half of them switched off, each working light was 
120 meters (396 feet) apart. The plane crashed on its third attempt 
to land. Airport officials have already been a target of questioning 
for removing their instrument landing system during runway renovations. 
The system helps pilots land in bad weather. A government committee 
is investigating the cause of the crash of the Airbus A310-200 on 
Dec. 11 at Surat Thani, 530 kilometers (330 miles) southwest of Bangkok 
and a gateway to popular resort islands. Some of the 45 survivors 
blamed the pilot for trying to land repeatedly in bad weather instead 
of diverting to another airport or returning to Bangkok. The pilot 
had complained to the tower of poor visibility, air traffic controllers 
at Surat Thani airport told The Nation. The paper quoted one anonymous 
Thai Airways pilot who disputed the electrician's contention that 
having only half the runway lights on would not affect visibility. 
``We need those lights, especially when the weather is very bad,'' 
he told the paper. He added that airport officials should have maximized 
other equipment, such as runway lights, considering the instrument 
landing system had been removed.
