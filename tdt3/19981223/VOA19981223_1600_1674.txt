For 15 years, at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia, 
Regina Jennings worked as a cleaning woman. Well, she doesn't work 
there any more, but she hasn't forgotten the school. Now she wants 
to give something back, and not just something. If you listen here: 
Ms. Jennings has saved some money over the years, and she wants to 
use her savings to help the university. She will request, in her will, 
that after her death, she leaves $93,000 to West Virginia University. 
The donation is to go to her favorite department, at the school, the 
College of Law. Ms. Jennings says everyone in the College of Law was 
incredibly nice to her, when she worked there. She has no children, 
and she says she does not want to leave all her money to her extended 
family. The $93,000 is nine times what Regina Jennings earned, each 
year, as a cleaning woman at the university. Isn't that something?
