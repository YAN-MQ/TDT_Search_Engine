A half-century after they were hanged by the Allies, wartime Japanese 
leader Hideki Tojo and six other convicted war criminals were quietly 
honored Wednesday in a memorial service in Tokyo. More than 600 people 
gathered for a three-hour service at the Kudan Kaikan hall in downtown 
Tokyo, a hall spokesman said. The memorial was sponsored by a group 
planning to build a permanent hall for those executed. Participants 
sang the Japanese national anthem and offered a one-minute prayer 
for the souls of the war dead at the start of the ceremony, which 
included statements by Tojo's granddaughter, Kyodo News agency reported. 
As Japan's prime minister from 1941 to 1944, Tojo authorized the surprise 
attack on Pearl Harbor. After Japan's surrender in 1945, Tojo and 
six other top leaders were found guilty of war crimes in the Tokyo 
trials and hanged on Dec. 23, 1948. While Tojo is widely reviled abroad 
as a symbol of Tokyo's brutal rule over a wide swath of Asia and its 
war against the Allies, he is a more ambiguous figure at home. A popular 
film released in May depicted him as a gentle family man who went 
to war in self-defense _ a popular notion among right-wing activists 
and revisionist academics who say Japan should not be ashamed of its 
past. Officials from the Showa Memorial Hall Preparation Committee, 
which sponsored Wednesday's service, were not available, but a phone 
message machine at their official urged ``any Japanese who loves Japan'' 
to come to the memorial. The conservative Sankei Shimbun newspaper 
reported Tuesday that Tojo's granddaughter, Yuko Tojo, is working 
to build a memorial hall to the executed war criminals to reestablish 
their reputations. ``I would like to hand over from generation to 
generation the historical facts which are not being taught at school,'' 
Yuko Tojo was quoted as saying by the Sankei. Still, Tojo and the 
other war criminals symbolize times that many in Japan would rather 
forget. National broadcaster NHK made no mention of the memorial on 
Wednesday, which was also a national holiday to honor Emperor Akihito's 
birthday. Kyodo News carried a report on its English-language service, 
but had no story in Japanese.
