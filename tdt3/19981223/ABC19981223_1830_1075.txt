When we come back -- when religion and Christmas do not mix. We'll 
take "A closer look." I work out to keep my body in shape. To help 
keep my mind sharp I take NEWr uanterra ginkgo biloba. It helps me 
concentrate, maintain focus. Why quanterra? All ginkgos aren't the 
same. The patented quanterra extract was proven safe and effective 
by doctors in extensive clinical trials. And it increases oxygen supply 
to the brain. With new quanterra mental sharpness I feel my best, 
naturally. Gosh, you know, I just went to use the phone. And you say 
once you got back your wife was gone? Yes, sir. Hello! What? Have 
you checked the hot enchilada? oh, no! Millicent gets terrible heartburn. 
Not this time. What's that? Looks like the remains of an individually 
wrapped pepcid ac chewable. Introducing pepcid ac chewables. The first 
chewable to stop heartburn before it starts. Millicent, is that you? 
Start living heartburn free with new pepcid ac chewables.
