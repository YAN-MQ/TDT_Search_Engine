Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. On December 23rd, 1913, 
President Woodrow Wilson, signed a measure that established the Federal 
System. The system was designed to improve the supervision of banking, 
in the United States, and to increase citizens' confidence in their 
banks. The system was set up in 1913. It placed Federal Reserve Banks 
in 12 major American cities. These banks lend money to member banks, 
and require them to keep a certain amount of money available to depositors. 
The Federal Reserve has gained enormous influence in the 85 years 
since it was established. The Fed determines the amount of money in 
circulation, and can act to control lending rates and currency inflation. 
Well, we're very close to 22 hours, universal and we're closing down
