Here beside the ruins of one of history's greatest cities, the frustrations 
of modern Iraqis seem especially poignant. Little remains of Babylon's 
legendary glory. Desert sands long ago swallowed up the hanging gardens 
that were among the wonders of the ancient world. Archaeologists who 
uncovered the splendid Ishtar Gate at the beginning of this century 
shipped it off to Berlin. Most of the other treasures found here are 
now at museums in Germany, France and Britain. Great emperors like 
Darius, Xerxes, Alexander and Nebuchadnezzar fought for and ruled 
this region, and today, together with the rest of Iraq, it is once 
again a battleground. President Saddam Hussein is determined to maintain 
his rule, but the United States and Britain want to drive him from 
power. Because Nebuchadnezzar, who ruled from 605 to 562 B.C., brought 
his empire to a peak of wealth and power, it is perhaps inevitable 
that Saddam would seek to bask in his glory. A billboard that greets 
visitors to Babylon is dominated by portraits of both men. At the 
site where the royal complex once stood, a poster proclaims, ``From 
Nebuchadnezzar to Saddam Hussein, Babylon Invokes Its Glories on the 
Path of Jihad and Glorious Development.'' But in nearby villages there 
is little to evoke past triumphs. Eight years of economic sanctions 
have left the region around Babylon severely deprived. The United 
Nations imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. They 
were intended to force him to limit his rearmament program, compensate 
Kuwaitis for the damage he wreaked on their country, account for those 
missing, and respect human rights within his own country. The sanctions, 
which ban nearly all foreign trade, have produced little progress 
toward those goals. They have, however, reduced many Iraqis to poverty. 
Soon after Iraq's defeat in Kuwait, the United Nations approved a 
plan under which the Iraqi government could sell limited amounts of 
oil and use the profits to buy food. At first Saddam refused to accept 
the plan, fearing that it would be used as an excuse to maintain the 
sanctions indefinitely. In 1996, he changed his mind, and from that 
moment the lives of ordinary Iraqis improved from wretched to simply 
bad. Oil sales now pay for more than $5 billion worth of food each 
year, the largest aid effort in the history of the United Nations. 
More than 250 U.N. aid workers who monitor the program left Iraq before 
last week's allied bombing raids but began returning Tuesday night. 
``This program has been the major change in life here since the bad 
times began eight years ago,'' said a European diplomat based in Baghdad. 
``It's of really major importance to the Iraqi people, because it 
provides a basic ration to millions of people who might otherwise 
starve.'' Under the aid program, each Iraqi is entitled to a basic 
monthly ration of flour, cooking oil, tea, salt, sugar, rice, dried 
beans and soap. Families with small children also receive powdered 
infant formula. ``Thank God for that ration,'' said Nima Mutar, 71, 
a father of 10 who manages his household on a monthly budget of about 
$20. ``Before it started we were really suffering.'' Mutar, whose 
small home is a mile from the ruins of Babylon, can now feed his family, 
but just barely. His adult sons, one a factory worker and the other 
a roadside vegetable vendor, earn only a fraction of what they earned 
a decade ago. In those days the family ate meat and vegetables every 
night; now they are luxuries reserved for once or twice a month. ``We 
hear rumors that the U.N. is going to start giving us eggs and milk,'' 
Mutar said. ``That would be great, because we don't want our little 
girls to get sick.'' For the Mutar family and others around Babylon 
who drink impure water, live on an inadequate diet and have no access 
to vaccinations, the specter of illness is ever-present and terrifying. 
They know that patients who enter the clinic in nearby Mahawil are 
likely to die there. ``We have no tools for diagnosis, no ultrasound 
equipment, no supply of fresh syringes, hardly any basic medicine, 
and an X-ray machine that only works when the power is on,'' lamented 
Buthayna Shibil, 26, a doctor who sees a dozen infants and small children 
die each month. ``If there were no sanctions, almost everyone who 
comes here would be home healthy in a few days.'' Officials in Washington 
say that they are prepared to consider a widening of the oil-for-food 
program but insist that sanctions remain in place until Saddam is 
deposed or drastically changes his policies. Ms. Shibil said she could 
not comprehend that attitude. ``Parents come in here crying for mercy 
and beg me to save their children,'' she said as she looked helplessly 
down on a malnourished infant afflicted with a blood infection that 
she said was likely to kill him within a few days. ``When they die, 
the parents ask me, `Why couldn't you do anything?' I tell them it 
is because of the war, because America is making war on the Iraqi 
people. Americans want sickness and disease and death in Iraq. They 
want Iraqi people to die.'' Prakash Shah, chief U.N. representative 
in Iraq, said money that came into Iraq under the oil-for-food program 
``is not by any measure enough to meet the needs here.'' ``You still 
see a lot of malnutrition and terrible health problems,'' Shah said 
in an interview. ``If you compare conditions here to what they were 
before this all started, you have to admit that they are really quite 
miserable.''
