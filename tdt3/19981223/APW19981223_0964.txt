Seeking to attract foreign investors despite Russia's economic crisis, 
the lower house of parliament on Wednesday approved a bill that would 
give more concessions to investors in natural-resource production. 
The bill would make equipment purchases for production-sharing projects 
exempt from import duties and the value-added tax, and would also 
allow such projects to pay taxes in crude oil instead of cash. ``The 
mere fact that this bill was passed signifies a great victory of reason,'' 
said Alexei Mikhailov, chairman of the State Duma's Committee on Natural 
Resources. The bill _ actually a package of amendments to production-sharing 
legislation _ still needs to be approved by the upper house of parliament 
and be signed by President Boris Yeltsin to become law. Earlier this 
month, the Duma finally passed another production-sharing bill, which 
raises the limit on foreigners' access to Russian natural resources 
from 10 percent to 30 percent of overall production, and allows smaller 
projects to go ahead without express parliamentary approval. However, 
development of Russia's production-sharing potential is still hobbled 
by the lack of a comprehensive list of projects that qualify for the 
status, Mikhailov said Wednesday. Only two production-sharing agreements 
with foreign investors _ oil projects Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 _ 
have been implemented in Russia since its law on production-sharing 
agreements went into effect at the beginning of 1996. A list of projects 
that could be granted that status is being finalized by parliament, 
and is expected to be up for a vote early next year, a Duma official 
said.
