Winter weather across the U.S. is making travel dangerous in places, 
but the race is on to get home for the holidays. Industry analysts 
predict a busy travel time from Christmas eve to new year's day. Aaa 
says a record 45.2 million people are planning to travel 100 miles 
or more away from home. 35.5 million of them are expected to drive, 
while 7 million will fly, take the train or bus. But industry analysts 
say concerns about the nation's economy could put a Chill on some 
trip plans. In a travel industry association survey, 25% of those 
asked worried that the economy will get worse. That's up from 12% 
last year. 56% said it will stay the same. That's down from 68% last 
year.
