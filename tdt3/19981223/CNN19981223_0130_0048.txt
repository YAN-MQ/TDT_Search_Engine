"CNN Headline News," I'm Denise Dillon. The first cold wave is sweeping 
across the United States, ending weeks of unusually mild weather. 
The sudden changes in temperature have caught people all over the 
country by surprise as Bob Cain reports. The sudden onslaught of winter 
hit the usual suspects first -- buffalo, flurries and a midday temperature 
of 18 degrees, more snow in the forecast. Duluth, Minnesota, 18 degrees 
below zero overnight. In Detroit, where the windchill dipped below 
zero, seven people were sent to hospitals for treatment of smoke inhalation 
after fire broke out in a High-rise apartment building. The fire department 
said a heating vent sparked the blaze. In ski areas like Aspen, Colorado, 
and in northern Michigan, the snow couldn't have been more welcome. 
We're so excited to have the snow here and to have the skiers here, 
we're just all for it. One Michigan ski slope spokeswoman said, "these 
people have been sitting in their driveways with their skis on, waiting 
for snow." Winter has also arrived in St. Louis, which has had its 
share of slick streets and damaged cars. You have to slow down and 
extend your distance from the guy in front of you, because you just 
don't know what's wet and what's ice. In fact, colder weather is descending 
on nearly the whole nation -- The south and southeast on notice to 
brace for a possible ice storm. In the far west, California orange 
growers are feeling the chill. Yeah, there's still a chance of some 
damaging temperatures the next two, three nights, so be keeping the 
wind machines ready to go, running them at night, running the water. 
And across wide areas of the country, that's what nature is doing 
-- Keeping the wind machines going in this first big cold wave of 
the season. Bob Cain, CNN.
