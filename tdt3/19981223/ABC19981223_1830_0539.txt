There was more defiance of the international community today from 
Iraq. The government has now banned all United Nations flights in 
and out of iraq. And in Washington today, the president's national 
security adviser, Sandy berger, said that if Saddam Hussein rebuilds 
his weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. will use military force 
to destroy them. The question is, how can the U.S. now keep track 
of what Saddam Hussein is doing? Here's ABC's John McWethy. American 
officials say they have no doubt that Iraq is already embarking on 
a crash campaign to make biological and chemical weapons. Now that 
the bombing is over and U.N. inspectors and their monitoring cameras 
are gone. The United States will now have Ron a very limitember of 
spies along U-2 surveillance planes and satellites. Planes and satellites 
can see buildings, but not what is inside. They can detect movement 
of trucks and trains, but not know what the cargo is. American officials 
concede that will mean even less knowledge about Iraqi efforts to 
make weapons of mass destruction. If history is any guide, Saddam 
Hussein will turn to well-developed facilities that now make something 
else, fertilizer or pharmaceuticals, for example. In the last war, 
the gulf war, he converted one of these to the mass production of 
Anthrax in about three months. And we're talking about hundreds of 
weapons. It would take Saddam Hussein even less time to make a few 
biological warheads, which could then be mounted on old Scud missiles. 
To produce a single Scud missile, which would deliver an agent to 
a Neighboring city, he could do very quickly, within a week or so 
because all that's required is some 100 liters or so of biological 
agent. It is far from clear whether the U.S. would be able to detect 
such an effort. And if it did, whether the world political climate 
would tolerate yet another American bombing campaign. John McWethy,
