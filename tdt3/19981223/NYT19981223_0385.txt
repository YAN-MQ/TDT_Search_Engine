In an advertisement now running for ``Fosse: A Celebration in Dance,'' 
the ballet and modern dancer Desmond Richardson stands in profile, 
his hands on his hips, a bowler perched at a raffish angle on his 
head. One leg is straight and the other bent. He wears ballet slippers. 
Sheathed only in tights and a vest, his remarkably muscular body looks 
sculptured. In the show (now in previews at the Broadhurst Theater, 
where it opens Jan. 14), he assumes this pose in ``Mr. Bojangles,'' 
a tender tribute to dancers past their prime. Most of the production's 
30 numbers, culled from Robert Fosse's prodigious choreographic output 
and featuring excerpts from ``Pajama Game'' and ``All That Jazz,'' 
require a hard-edged sensuality. Rising to the occasion in six pieces, 
Richardson lets go his full intensity in a solo, ``Percussion 4,'' 
and in ``Cool Hand Luke'' he gyrates in vintage Fosse style, looking 
as experienced as the rest of the 35-member cast, all seasoned show 
dancers. After opening in Toronto in July, ``Fosse,'' directed by 
Richard Malby Jr. with assistance from the singer-dancer greats Ann 
Reinking and Gwen Verdon, had limited engagements in Boston and Los 
Angeles. Reviews have been favorable. The question is how did a classically 
trained dancer become an emblem of such a quintessentially Broadway 
style in his first Broadway appearance? ``Audiences are stunned by 
Desmond,'' said Ms. Verdon. ``He's totally different from any performer 
I've ever seen. Besides his amazing musicality, he moves like a panther.'' 
In fact, Fosse's moves felt natural to Richardson. ``Jazz is in my 
body,'' he said. ``I was a street dancer before I was anything else.'' 
In the last few years, several superb male dancers have come to the 
fore in classical and modern dance, among them Vladimir Malakhov and 
Jose Manuel Carreno at American Ballet Theater, Matthew Rushing at 
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and Albert Evans at New York 
City Ballet. But, even in such impressive company, Richardson's technique 
and expressiveness stand out. ``When we danced together in Nacho Duato's 
`Remanso' at ABT,'' said Malakhov, ``Desmond made everything look 
so easy. I wished I could be like him.'' At 30, Richardson has already 
been a principal dancer with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, 
the Frankfurt Ballet and American Ballet Theater. Moreover, his talent 
has attracted choreographers as diverse as George Faison, Ulysses 
Dove, Garth Fagan, John Butler, William Forsythe and Lar Lubovitch. 
``Instinctively, Desmond conveys poetry in movement,'' said Lubovitch, 
who choreographed the lead in Ballet Theater's ``Othello'' for him. 
``Then there's his superb technique. As a dance linguist, he speaks 
eloquently in all styles. Nothing he performs is flat or uninflected.'' 
Faison went further: ``He is the most magnificent dancer America has 
produced in years.'' Richardson blossomed early. As a child, he started 
dancing at home, in New York City. ``My family likes to party,'' he 
said. ``They're from the South and the Caribbean. Everybody dances 
in my house _ salsa, reggae, soul. We watch to see who can do the 
newest step. My mother acts as catalyst. She knows how to bring the 
party up. When we dance, the feeling comes from inside. No pretense. 
No facade. It infiltrates you.'' But until he discovered ``Great Performances'' 
on Channel 13, Richardson didn't have any concept of professional 
dance. ``Then I fell in love with every aspect of dance _ the theater, 
the music, the costumes, the sets,'' he said. ``They became a part 
of me.'' Since his parents couldn't afford dance classes, he auditioned 
for the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan. He won a place 
as a freshman and within a year had a scholarship to continue his 
studies at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center. In 1986, Ailey asked 
him to join his company. From the beginning, Richardson maintained 
a professional life outside established dance. In 1988, Michael Jackson 
asked him to be in his video ``Bad'' and since then he has performed 
in other videos and toured with En Vogue, Aretha Franklin, Prince 
and Madonna. In 1994, he established his own modern troupe, Complexions, 
with the choreographer Dwight Rhoden, in order to support and explore 
new dance movement. ``I fill myself up with as many things as possible,'' 
he explained. ``I like works that are completely out of the ordinary. 
Alvin taught me the importance of versatility. He said: `If you can 
sing, you have to sing; if you can act, act. You'll bring all that 
to the stage, and it's so very relevant.' '' So far, no one company 
has given Richardson a chance to exhibit the full extent of his abilities. 
``Such an incredible talent should be catered to,'' said Keith Lee, 
who choreographed for Richardson at the Ailey company. ``Desmond shouldn't 
have to go all over the place to find interesting opportunities. An 
artistic director should bring them to him. Bob Joffrey did that at 
the Joffrey Ballet for his principal dancers and so did Lucia Chase 
at ABT.'' After seven years with the Ailey company, he left for the 
Frankfurt Ballet to try something new. He joined Ballet Theater in 
1997, largely because Lubovitch wanted him for the lead in his full-evening 
work ``Othello,'' a co-production of Ballet Theater and the San Francisco 
Ballet. He expected Ballet Theater to offer him other opportunities. 
However, his only other role of significance was in ``Remanso.'' ``When 
I went there,'' he said, ``many people with the company seemed surprised 
that I had been trained in ballet. It's so ridiculous. I'd like to 
think my color didn't have anything to do with my not being asked 
to play big classical roles. But given my technical abilities, I don't 
know what to think.'' One role that Richardson wanted badly was Romeo 
in Sir Kenneth MacMillan's ``Romeo and Juliet,'' a role that has not 
been danced in the full-length version by an African-American in a 
major company in this country. Although Kevin McKenzie, artistic director 
of Ballet Theater, considers Richardson a great dancer, he did not 
think he was ready for Romeo. Instead, he was given Tybalt in that 
ballet and had the mimed role of Carabosse, the evil fairy, in ``The 
Sleeping Beauty.'' He also appeared with Ballet Theater in Jerome 
Robbins's ``Fancy Free'' and as the partner of the Russian ballerina 
Nina Ananiashvili in Clark Tippet's ``Some Assembly Required,'' both 
modern ballets based in the classical vocabulary. Rudolf Nureyev traveled 
constantly to find places to exercise his talents. Consequently, he 
appeared with numerous ballet and modern dance companies over the 
course of his lengthy career, even doing a stint in the Broadway show 
``The King and I.'' Richardson's pace and his need for variety aren't 
unlike Nureyev's. Take, for example, the last 13 months: His marathon 
began in November 1997 when he joined Ballet Theater for its season 
at City Center in New York. Meanwhile, he had heard about ``Fosse'' 
from his friend Elizabeth Parkinson, a former Joffrey dancer who was 
already in the show. In December, he auditioned for Chet Walker, a 
co-choreographer with Ms. Reinking of ``Fosse,'' and was signed on. 
In January, Richardson went to Toronto to start workshops for ``Fosse.'' 
Two months later, he took a leave to dance ``Othello,'' with the San 
Francisco Ballet. In early June, he returned to New York to appear 
in ``Othello'' with Ballet Theater at the Metropolitan Opera House. 
A couple of weeks later found him in a SoHo loft performing Rhoden's 
works with Complexions. The tempo didn't let up. By July, he was back 
in Toronto with ``Fosse.'' (Given his importance to the show, the 
producers had only regretfully agreed to his missing the last week 
in Toronto and the first week in Boston.) In August, he hopped on 
a plane for Milan, Italy, where Forsythe, artistic director of the 
Frankfurt Ballet, choreographed a piece for him to perform at La Scala 
with Alessandra Ferri, a principal dancer with Ballet Theater. His 
only break from the production since then was in October when Complexions 
performed at the Hostos Center for Arts and Culture in the Bronx. 
Between engagements, he kept up with acting and voice lessons, for 
in the future he hopes to do films. In spite of his unforgiving schedule, 
Richardson thrives on varied assignments. The choreography of ``Fosse'' 
demands from him special attention to detail. From Forsythe, he grew 
to understand improvisational technique. ``Billy made me see how I 
make decisions,'' he said, ``and how and where movements originate 
in my body and mind.'' In Europe, he also discovered that artists 
use their skills quite differently from the way they do in the United 
States. ``There, a performance is all about the work,'' he said. ``It's 
not about the performers. The dancers invite you into what they're 
doing; it's not in your face. Unfortunately, here everything has to 
be pow! Right now! ``Technique should only be an accouterment,'' he 
added. ``A dancer must breathe life into every gesture. Then, his 
spirit and individuality color it. It's what I work for. It's what 
I do in `Fosse.' ''
