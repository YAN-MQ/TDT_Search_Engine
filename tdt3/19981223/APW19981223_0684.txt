German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping arrived for a pre-Christmas 
visit to his troops serving the NATO-led peace force mission in Bosnia 
on Wednesday. During his visit to the Bosnian capital, Scharping met 
commanders of the NATO-led peace force and his soldiers in the German 
base in the Sarajevo suburb of Rajlovac. Sharping said based on what 
he'd seen on the ground, Bosnia's main problems no longer concern 
the military, but civil reconstruction, the lack of cooperation between 
the ethnic groups and protecting security. He emphasized that multi-ethnic 
civilian projects are a large part of what German troops are doing 
in Bosnia. ``The Bundeswehr is cooperating only with those companies 
who have workers from all three ethnic groups,'' he said. ``This way 
a signal is sent out that if they can work together ... they can live 
together.'' Germany currently contributes some 3,000 troops to the 
32,000-strong international peacekeeping force in Bosnia. Asked how 
long the German soldiers will stay in Bosnia, Scharping said: ``I 
believe, that we will stay for a longer time, just like everybody 
else.'' It's the second time Scharping has visited German troops in 
Bosnia since he took the post.
