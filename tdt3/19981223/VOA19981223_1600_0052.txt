Iraq has banned United Nation's flights into the country, four days 
after the end of the U.S. and British air strikes. U.N. Special Envoy, 
Shaw Prokosh, had to leave Baghdad, today, by road. An Iraqi foreign 
ministry official told the French news agency the action was taken 
to protect the flights from Iraq's anti-aircraft defenses, which are 
still on alert for possible further attacks by U.S. and British forces. 
U.S. National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, has warned Iraqi leader, 
Saddam Hussein, that U.S. forces are ready to strike again, if he 
tries to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Berger says 
he believes it would be pointless to send United Nations weapons inspectors 
back into Iraq, if Baghdad does not intend to cooperate with them. 
But, the United States is making clear; there must be some monitoring 
system in place. Correspondent, Nick Simeone has details from the 
White House. Despite calls by some countries, for changes in the weapons 
inspection process. National Security advisor, Sandy Berger, says 
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council remain united. 
President Saddam Hussein must fulfill his disarmament obligations 
before there can be any talk of sanctions being eased. But, with U.N. 
weapons inspectors having been blocked repeatedly, Mr. Berger is raising 
the possibility that it may now be time to consider other ways to 
monitor Iraq's suspected weapon sites. At the very least, it is going 
to have to be found some -- if you want sanctions released -- some 
mechanism is going to have to be found. And, we would submit that 
it needs to be a professional, independent, non-political arms-control 
mechanism, as is UNSCOM, to verify that he has complied. At the same 
time, he says, the United States plans to work to strengthen opposition 
to the Iraqi leader. Mr. Berger admits maintaining support for nearly 
a decade of economic sanctions is requiring an increasing amount of 
diplomatic skill. Nick Simone, VOA News at the White House.
