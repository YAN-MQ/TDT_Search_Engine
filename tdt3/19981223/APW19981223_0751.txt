Three balloonists flew out of Chinese airspace toward the Pacific 
Ocean on Wednesday, keeping alive their bid to be the first to circle 
the world in a balloon. After two days of diplomatic tension over 
the balloon's passage through prohibited Chinese territory, the craft 
finally cleared Chinese airspace shortly before 1530 GMT, the project's 
ground crew said. The ICO Global balloon was at 26,000 feet (8,000 
meters), traveling at about 40 knots (45 mph, 72 kph), a speed that 
would take about 10 hours to reach Japanese air space on a track between 
the cities of Yamaguchi and Hiroshima, a spokeswoman added. One Chinese 
air traffic controller grumbled on Wednesday that planes flying between 
Xi'an, site of China's famed terra-cotta warriors, and the capital 
Beijing were having to adjust their flight paths because of the balloon. 
``People don't like uninvited guests,'' said the controller at Xianyang 
Airport, near Xi'an. He refused to give his name. British tycoon Richard 
Branson, flying with American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand 
of Sweden, told BBC Radio by telephone that they hoped the hot air 
and helium balloon could get across the Pacific in a couple of days 
``and be just coming in over the American border for Christmas Day. 
Washington (state) is where we think we'll be taken.'' Balloon pilots 
navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to ascend or descend 
into different wind systems, and cannot plan their courses and speeds 
precisely. ``We're pleased and relieved and grateful that the Chinese 
finally let us through,'' he said. Beijing had said the balloonists 
could cross China below 26 degrees north latitude. But the trio drifted 
further north on Monday after navigating around Mediterranean storms 
and closed airspace over Iraq, Iran and Russia. The project ground 
crew said the Chinese asked the balloonists to land at the Lhasa airfield 
Tuesday morning, but that the balloon overshot the field and it was 
impossible to come down anywhere else. British diplomats worked late 
into the evening Tuesday seeking Chinese permission for the round-the-world 
balloon to continue its course. China's Foreign Ministry finally telephoned 
Britain's ambassador in Beijing at about 9:30 p.m. (1330 GMT) to say 
that the balloon could carry on ``but it has to leave Chinese airspace 
as soon as possible,'' said embassy spokeswoman Harriet Hall. The 
ground crew said the Pacific leg of the journey was the most hazardous. 
``The ocean is so big that the rescue services do not operate that 
far out,'' project director Mike Kendrick told Sky News. ``The frequency 
of shipping is not good. If they ditch in the Pacific it is very difficult 
and the chances of survival are not good, though we have to make sure 
everything is right.'' ``The next two days will be very tense,'' said 
Kendrick. ``We are trying to get to America for Christmas Day which 
will give us a good shot of crossing America on a fast jetstream.'' 
The balloon took off from a Moroccan air force base outside Marrakech 
on Dec. 18. The trip is expected to last from eight days to nearly 
three weeks. The balloonists hope to touch down somewhere in Western 
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will 
take them over India, the South China Sea, the Pacific and the United 
States. The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights 
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North 
Korea.
