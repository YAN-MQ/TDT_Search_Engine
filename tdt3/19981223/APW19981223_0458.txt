The supreme court on Wednesday found ex-NATO chief Willy Claes and 
two other former government ministers guilty of corruption in awarding 
two defense contracts in the 1980s. It gave Claes, 60, a three-year 
suspended jail term and former defense minister Guy Coeme, 52, a two-year 
suspended sentence. It also convicted former premier Guy Spitaels, 
67, and Serge Dassault, 75, head of France's Dassault aviation concern, 
of corruption but did not immediately announce sentences. Eight others 
_ former aides and associates _ were to hear later Wednesday if they 
are guilty or not. The court said Claes, 60, must have known Italy's 
Agusta SpA paid 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) to oil the awarding 
of a December 1988, contract for 46 army helicopters. ``It is not 
excluded that, prior to awarding the contract, (Claes) gave his assent 
to his chief Cabinet aide to accept the offer made by Agusta,'' Marc 
Lahousse, the court's presiding judge, said in a decision that took 
hours to read. He said Claes' and his co-defendants bent the rules 
to favor Agusta at the expense of France's Aerospatiale SA in a helicopter 
contract award. The court also found that Dassault Aviation SA's payment 
of 60 million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) constituted corruption _ 
to win a June 1989 deal to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics 
to beat out U.S.-based Litton Industries Inc. in the bidding. Each 
contracts was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Claes and the 
other 11 defendants went on trial Sept. 2, pleading innocent. Agusta 
and Dassault paid bribes to Belgium's Dutch and French-speaking socialist 
parties through secret Swiss and Luxembourg bank accounts. The trial 
in the 15-judge high court came after the parliamentary immunity of 
Claes and the others had been lifted. It was a final curtain for party 
bosses who, until the 1990s, ran their political families out of their 
wallets, unhindered by laws banning corporate political donations. 
It was not until 1989 that Belgium outlawed such donations. Thus, 
prosecutors did not have to prove corporate money was paid but that 
the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed so closely to the awarding 
of contracts that Claes and the others simply had to know they were 
bribes. The trial's origin lies in the still unresolved murder of 
Andre Cools, a onetime socialist minister who was slain in 1991, presumably 
because he knew of financial wrongdoing. Claes became NATO secretary-general 
in September 1994. He quit in disgrace 13 months later when the Augusta 
investigation made it untenable for him to lead the western alliance. 
He was long a powerbroker in the Dutch-speaking Socialist Party. Spitaels, 
the former deputy premier, has long been the mainstay of French-speaking 
socialists. For Coeme, the former defense minister and a francophone 
socialist, the trial was his second in two years. In 1996, the supreme 
court gave him a two-year suspended jail term for corruption.
