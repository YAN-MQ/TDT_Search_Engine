British engineering group General Electric Co. PLC announced twin 
deals Wednesday with other European businesses to create joint ventures 
in the missile and satellite industries. The deals mark the latest 
step in the long-running consolidation of the European defense and 
aerospace industries, aimed at creating European giants to rival the 
top defense groups in the United States. In the defense field, GEC 
announced a 50-50 joint venture with Italian defense engineering group 
Finmeccanica combining their ground, naval, missile system and air 
traffic control activities. The new company, to be called Alenia Marconi 
Systems, will have turnover of about 1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.7 billion) 
a year, they said. In the space sector, GEC has joined with France's 
Lagadere, Germany's Daimler-Chrysler Aerospace (Dasa) and again with 
Italy's Finmeccanica to merge satellite activities. That venture will 
have turnover of about 1.8 billion pounds (dlrs 2.9 billion) a year 
and will be subject to approval by authorities in each of the countries 
involved as well as from the European Union. The name of the new space 
company was not immediately available. GEC is already part-owner of 
Matra Marconi Space, a joint venture with Lagardere. Under the latest 
deal, Matra Marconi Space will merge its activities with the space 
industry business of Dasa and Finmeccanica's space division Alenia 
Spazio. ``The new company, with an unrivaled scientific potential 
in Europe will play a key leadership role in the conquest of the solar 
system and the associated programs,'' Phillipe Camus, chief executive 
of Matra Hautes Technologies, and Peter Gershon, chief executive of 
Marconi Electronic Systems, said in a joint statement. A spokesman 
for GEC said the new space group would have a ``comprehensive capability'' 
in making satellites for observation and telecommunications. The group's 
main competition will be the U.S. aerospace group Lockheed Martin. 
The agreement comes a day after GEC said it would split its civil 
operations from its defense activities to prepare for European consolidation 
in defense and aerospace. The company, which is not related to General 
Electric in the United States, has been reported to be among the firms 
talking to British Aerospace PLC about possible mergers. General Electric 
Co. rose 6 pence to close at 543.5 pence on the London Stock Exchange.
