In the spring of 1995, Gary Cavalli, an energetic marketing maven 
in California, predicted that the United States was ready for a women's 
professional basketball league. In October 1996 Cavalli unveiled the 
American Basketball League. The next summer, the Women's National 
Basketball Association, with ferocious backing from the NBA, launched 
its inaugural summer campaign. From that instant the question became 
whether there was enough interest and money for two women's league. 
On Tuesday the verdict was delivered in cold, crushing fashion: the 
ABL announced that it was declaring bankruptcy and ceasing operations, 
effective immediately. ``We gave every ounce of energy and blood, 
sweat and tears to keep it going,'' Cavalli said Wednesday from his 
office in San Jose, Calif. ``We ran out of time and we ran out of 
money. I don't know what the final judgment of all this is going to 
be. Maybe it's that there is only room for one, and I'm not sure which 
one it would have been.'' Despite the predictions of failure _ and 
the steady signs of it for the last two and a half years _ no one 
was prepared for Tuesday's announcement. Carolyn Young, the New England 
Blizzard star and the ABL's second-leading scorer, was Christmas shopping 
when she got the news. ``My husband called me,'' she said. ``He said: 
`I've got some bad news for you. The league has folded.' I told him, 
`You must be kidding.' I didn't believe him.'' K.C. Jones, the coach 
of the Blizzard, was in his office watching tape when he got the call. 
``Wow,'' he said. Jones said the scene at team headquarters Wednesday, 
when the staff had to clear out, was the saddest thing he had seen 
in his sports career. That career covers consecutive national basketball 
championships at the University of San Francisco in 1955 and 1956; 
eight consecutive NBA titles with the Boston Celtics; a gold medal 
as a member of the 1956 U.S. Olympic team in Melbourne; two years 
in the Army, where he played football; a brief fling with the L.A. 
Rams, and, finally, NBA championships as head coach of the Celtics 
in 1984 and 1986. With Jones' history, you begin to grasp the magnitude 
of pain, sorrow and uncertainty. ``As far as being sad, this was the 
biggest,'' Jones said. ``You're talking about people out of jobs. 
The whole league just went down.'' The consistent response from players 
and coaches was shock over the league's collapse and the lack of warning. 
``I am shocked,'' said New England guard Jenn Rizzotti. ``I never 
saw it coming.'' But Cavalli said there was abundant warning _ not 
of the place and time, but certainly of the ABL's financial condition. 
``We never told them we were headed toward bankruptcy. But players 
have been aware for six months that the situation was unstable,'' 
he said. ``At a players' advisory board meeting in August, we said 
we did not have enough money to make it through the season. But we 
kept holding out hope.'' Could all of this have been avoided? Cavalli 
thinks so. ``I think if we were by ourselves we would have won,'' 
Cavalli said. ``Maybe we could have made it in basketball season doing 
the way we did it if we didn't have to battle the NBA. Or maybe they 
are right in that the only way it works is if it's in the summer and 
out of season _ I would hope that was not the case. But if it is, 
that's OK. ``The main thing we want to have happen here is that there's 
women's professional basketball in the United States. As the wife 
of one investor said, `I'm glad we tried.' That's how I feel: I'm 
glad we tried.'' They tried hard. Cavalli said he spoke with players 
in the league about accepting a 5 percent pay cut. They would give 
the money back to the league, which would purchase tickets for underprivileged 
children. The league furnished players with forms to fill out; 30 
of 90 responded. ``We tried to organize a doubleheader with NBA players,'' 
he said. ``We had picked out dates, and place. No network would pick 
it up. I thought that was a little strange.'' The rival WNBA has been 
conciliatory. Valerie Ackerman, the president of the WNBA said in 
a statement: ``This is an unfortunate setback for the women's sports 
movement. We applaud the great efforts and passion of the ABL's players 
and all the league and team personnel who labored so hard to start 
and sustain the league.'' For ABL players and coaches, all this is 
irrelevant. As Jones said, everyone is in a state of shock. ``It's 
pretty bizarre,'' he said. ``Nothing to do, no games to play, nobody 
to coach.''
