It's unlikely that the movie ``City of Angels'' will be celebrated 
at any of the forthcoming Hollywood awards programs. The movie, a 
remake of Wim Wenders' 1988 film, ``Wings of Desire,'' stars Nicholas 
Cage and Meg Ryan, opened on April 10 to bland reviews and grossed 
a respectable $55 million. Then, as all films that fail to endear 
themselves to critics and vast crowds, it was shoved aside by a new 
crop of movies. By late June, it could no longer be found in theaters. 
Then something odd happened. On July 4, a month after ``City of Angels,'' 
the motion picture, began its inevitable journey toward videotape, 
``City of Angels,'' the soundtrack, became the No. 1 album on the 
Billboard chart. Today, more than five months after the movie disappeared 
from the theaters, ``Music From the Motion Picture `City of Angels' 
'' remains firmly entrenched among Billboard's top 40 albums. Having 
earned quadruple-platinum status (four million units sold) and spawned 
two hit singles (``Uninvited'' by Alanis Morissette and ``Iris'' by 
the Goo Goo Dolls), it has become the best-selling record to be released 
in 1998. That the No. 1 album of 1998 is a soundtrack seems particularly 
apropos. Though film-music sales have long been a profitable subdivision 
of the music business _ the two largest-selling soundtracks of all 
time, ``The Bodyguard'' (18 million copies) and ``Purple Rain'' (13 
million), dwarf ``City of Angels'' _ never have so many been released 
in a single year. In 1990, 16 soundtracks appeared on the Billboard 
album chart; in 1998, there were more than 50. ``This is an all-time 
high,'' said Liz Heller, an executive vice president of Capitol Records. 
Of this year's major soundtracks, ``Music From the Motion Picture 
`Armageddon' '' has earned triple-platinum certification, and ``Hope 
Floats'' and ``Dr. Dolittle'' (both double platinum) have also outlasted 
the movies they accompanied. In late November, nearly a month before 
the film arrived, Dreamworks set a record by releasing three separate 
soundtracks (pop, country and inspirational) for a single movie, the 
animated feature ``The Prince of Egypt.'' ``There's definitely a real 
concerted effort now,'' said Jeff Mayfield, the director of charts 
at Billboard magazine. ``All the major companies have units that deal 
specifically with soundtracks. Sony has an entire division that works 
with every label in its system. They exist to actively marry music 
to movies.'' (Sony produced last-year's top-selling soundtrack, ``Music 
From the Motion Picture `Titanic,' '' which sold 10 million copies.) 
Since movies and their soundtracks invariably are produced by the 
same corporate entity _ Warner Brothers released ``City of Angels'' 
and Warner Sunset/Reprise put out ``Music From the Motion Picture 
`City of Angels' '' _ a successful soundtrack would seem to be the 
ultimate synergistic triumph. Soundtracks also allow record companies 
to piggyback on a film's promotional campaign, which reduces the album's 
marketing costs. Though ``City of Angels,'' the film, grossed $55 
million domestically, it was estimated to have cost $80 million to 
make. Industry analysts speculate that ``Music From the Motion Picture 
`City of Angels' '' will gross roughly $30 million to $35 million, 
which, theoretically, makes the soundtrack more profitable than the 
movie. Today, soundtracks have become prefab greatest-hits packages. 
``More than ever, sales are measured in the short term,'' said Ron 
Fierstein, manager of the pop singer Shawn Colvin, ``and soundtracks 
are the quintessential short-term product.'' With impatient corporate 
parents to placate, labels are less willing to wait around for individual 
artists to assemble a body of work from which hits packages can be 
fashioned. Soundtracks offer instant commercial gratification without 
the expensive commitment associated with long-term artist development. 
This has created a culture in which success is increasingly measured 
entirely in hit singles, and artists who are unable to deliver are 
as unpopular with labels as overbudget filmmakers are with movie studios. 
``Putting all your money into soundtracks is a dangerous investment 
strategy,'' said Moby, the electronic music star who scored much of 
the soundtrack for the recent James Bond film ``Tomorrow Never Dies.'' 
``Record companies aren't building artistic equity.'' But record companies 
seem more sanguine about the long-term effects of a marketplace larded 
with soundtracks. ``Overall, I think the positives far outweigh the 
negatives,'' said Jack Rovner, president of RCA Records. ``The exposure 
a new artist gets on a big-selling soundtrack is incredible. And when 
you have an artist in the middle of a down time _ as you did with 
Alanis Morissette _ it can have incredible results.'' By including 
a Morissette song on the ``City of Angels'' soundtrack (the singer's 
first recorded work in three years), her label helped whet the public's 
appetite for a forthcoming solo album. ``You couldn't ask for a better 
setup,'' Rovner said. Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records, 
rejects the notion that soundtracks can be detrimental to artistic 
growth. ``I think `City of Angels' helped make Alanis a better artist,'' 
he said. ``When we asked her to contribute a song, we never said `Write 
a hit record _ or else!' We just wanted something by her. But when 
`Uninvited' became a hit, it was a huge compositional breakthrough. 
It taught Alanis that she could do what she wanted, and still reach 
people.'' Of course, not every artist is of the magnitude of Morissette, 
a performer whose mere presence can turn a soundtrack into a hit record. 
Given the limited appeal of the film ``City of Angels,'' it is unlikely 
that the soundtrack would have fared so well without her. ``At $15 
a CD, customers are less likely to take a risk,'' said John Grandoni, 
vice president of purchasing for National Record Mart, a retail music 
chain. ``That's why soundtracks are so successful. They're usually 
filled with recognizable names.'' But lesser-known performers may 
not be so lucky. Even with a song on the million-selling ``Music From 
the Motion Picture `Godzilla,' '' an unknown band like Fuzzbubble 
may never be heard from again because its label may feel that the 
group has already had its best promotional chance. Then there is the 
larger question of whether soundtracks actually bear any creative 
relationship to the films that they represent. In the past, songs 
picked to appear on soundtracks were assumed to advance themes expressed 
in the movie. Today, most soundtracks feature songs that are barely 
audible in the movie, making the term ``music from the motion picture'' 
less an example of synergy than, as Grandoni put it, ``false advertising.'' 
``Some of these albums are music `inspired by' the film,'' he said. 
`` `Godzilla' is a great example. A lot of those songs aren't even 
in the movie.'' But Mayfield of Billboard takes the view that any 
exposure for an artist is better than none. ``If you're heard on a 
soundtrack at all, it's usually for 10 seconds over the jukebox in 
a coffee shop while a character is ordering fries. I'm not sure that's 
meaningful. But with 20 million people watching, hey, it's worth the 
risk.''
