A 14-year-old boy was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of stabbing 
an 80-year-old woman to death with a kitchen knife in an attempted 
robbery, police said. The boy told police investigators that he first 
threw a stone against the front door of Miyoshi Moriyama's residence 
at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, an official said. When Moriyama opened the door, 
the boy went into the house and stabbed her, said a police official 
at Neyagawa, western Japan, speaking on condition of anonymity. The 
official said the boy tried to take money from Moriyama, who owned 
an apartment house and lived alone. But Moriyama screamed and went 
out of the house and the boy ran away without taking any money, the 
official said. The woman later died. The police are withholding the 
name of the boy because he is a minor. The killing comes as Japan 
is increasingly concerned about a rise in juvenile crime. Last year, 
a 14-year-old was arrested for killing a younger schoolmate and leaving 
his severed and mutilated head at a school gate. This year through 
November, 144,228 juveniles between the age of 14 and 19 were arrested 
or taken into protective custody for alleged criminal offenses, up 
3.1 percent from the same period in 1997, according to a report released 
recently by the National Police Agency. Strict gun laws have limited 
the number of firearm-related crimes committed in Japan, but the use 
of knives has become popular in recent years among juvenile delinquents.
