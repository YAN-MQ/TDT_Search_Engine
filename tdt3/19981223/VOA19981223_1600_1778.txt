Stay tuned as VOA News Now continues with news. It's 21 hours, 30 
universal time. And, this is News Now. Iraq bans United Nation flights 
into the country four days after the end of U.S. and British air strikes. 
The U.S. National Security Advisor issues another warning to Iraq 
if it tries to rebuild it's weapons of mass destruction. And, in Dateline, 
we'll look at the role of non-governmental organizations and helping 
to deal with regional conflicts, in this half-hour. First, a summary
