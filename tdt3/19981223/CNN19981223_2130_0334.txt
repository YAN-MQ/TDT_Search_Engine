The FBI says it has found a car belonging to a man they want to question 
in the shooting death of a doctor who performed abortions. Authorities 
say James kopp's car was found in the parking lot of Newark international 
airport in New Jersey. They say the car had fake license plates. Kopp 
has been named as a material witness to the October killing of doctor 
barnett slepian. Police say he's not a suspect. We do know, we have 
information that puts James kopp here in the area on october 18th, 
19th, 20th and 21st. We do not have any information at this point 
that could very definitely tie him in on the 22nd. As you know, the 
shooting took place on the 23rd. So what we are trying to do is solicit 
the public's cooperation and their help and anyone in that time that 
might have seen him. So anyone who has any information, who may have 
seen him, may have anything that they think may be related to that 
would help us to firmly tie Mr. kopp to this area during that time 
frame. We certainly would appreciate that. Authorities say kopp is 
an anti-abortion actsivist affiliated with the army of God group.
