Bulgaria's top prosecutor appealed to the country's constitutional 
court to throw out a referendum to abolish the monarchy passed 52 
years ago, state media reported. Bulgarian Prosecutor General Ivan 
Tatarchev appealed to the 12 judges of the constitutional court to 
invalidate the 1946 law that called for the referendum. He argued 
the law was against the constitution then and still is now, as neither 
envisaged the possibility to be amended by a referendum. It was not 
immediately clear when the court, which is empowered to review legislation, 
would rule. Also not clear is whether a possible invalidation of the 
law would directly resurrect monarchy. Tatarchev's move coincided 
with a meeting between Bulgaria's President Petar Stoyanov and the 
country's former king Simeon II, who is visiting his homeland for 
Christmas and New Year. ``I will probably have to tell you something 
at the end of my stay here, but now I can just wish you a merry Christmas,'' 
Simeon told state radio after the meeting. In the ceremonial hall 
of his office, Stoyanov showed the king Bulgaria's new coat of arms, 
on which the royal regalia _ a crown and three crowned lions _ have 
been restored half a century after being abolished by communists. 
No further details of hour-long discussions were disclosed. The referendum 
was organized by the communists, who the Soviet army installed in 
1944, and held while Soviet troops were present in Bulgaria. Critics 
of the referendum say it was rigged and illegal. Supporters say it 
reflected wide public resentment to monarchy because of its role in 
allying Bulgaria with Nazi Germany in World War II and persecuting 
anti-Nazi resisters. Simeon, 61, acceded to the throne at the age 
of six in 1943, when his father Boris III died shortly after making 
Bulgaria a German ally. He reigned under regencies until the 1946 
referendum, after which he and his family were exiled. Although the 
vast majority of modern Bulgarians feel republican, Simeon commands 
wide respect for his non-partisan behavior and European touch. They 
received the former monarch, now a businessman, living in Madrid, 
Spain, with a tumultuous welcome during two brief visits to his homeland 
in 1996 and 1997.
