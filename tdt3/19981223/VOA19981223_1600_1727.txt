Well, here's another story that will warm you heart, and it's also 
from Morgantown, West Virginia. Some people, especially children, 
feel bad about having their birthdays in December. And that's because, 
they feel that Christmas takes away some attention from their birthdays. 
But, 11-year old Heather Higgens, of Morgantown, did something special 
for her birthday, in December. She says she has everything she needs, 
so she asked that all the kids coming to her skating party for her 
birthday, bring a gift to be donated to needy children. Gifts will 
be given to the "Toys for Tots" campaign. That's a Christmas season 
event sponsored by the United States Marine Corps. The U.S. Marine 
Corps picked up about 20 gifts from Heather. A Staff Sergeant who 
works as a coordinator in the "Toys for Tots" campaign said, "That 
girl is something special." Indeed she is.
