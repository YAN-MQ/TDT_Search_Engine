Police have arrested a man suspected of trying to extort 10 million 
marks (dlrs 6 million) from the German railways with acts of sabotage, 
officials said Wednesday. Police, aided by air force reconnaissance 
planes, had been chasing the blackmailer for several weeks amid a 
growing holiday-season scare for railway employees and passengers. 
Helicopters and 400 extra federal border police were also ordered 
out to patrol rail lines. The suspect was arrested late Tuesday at 
an autobahn rest area in Bavaria, the Austria Press Agency reported. 
He had been enroute to a ransom money handover in neighboring Austria, 
where police were poised to nab him, the report said, quoting the 
Austrian interior ministry. German Transport Minister Franz Muentefering 
voiced relief, calling the arrest ``reassuring news for the safety 
of all train travelers at Christmas time.'' Earlier, the manhunt had 
centered on the northeast of the country, where rail lines were sabotaged 
several times in recent weeks. Federal criminal, pickup 5th graf pvs.
