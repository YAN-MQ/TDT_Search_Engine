Russia, and the United States, held discussions in the United Nations 
Security Council, Wednesday, in an effort to resolve their differences 
over how to deal with Iraq. VOA's United Nations Correspondent, Max 
Rustin, reports. The council held its third consecutive day of discussions 
on a Security Council statement proposed by Russia. In the latest 
meeting, U.S. diplomats proposed revisions of two key elements of 
the statement. Russian diplomats say, they are waiting for further 
guidance, on the issue, from Moscow. The U.S. revisions would remove 
a sentence expressing regret that force was used against Iraq. The 
United States also wants to change the wording of requests for assistance 
from U.N. Secretary General, Kofi Annan. U.N. Officials say, Mr. Annan 
is welcome to play a diplomatic role, and assist with humanitarian 
issues. But, they say they do not want him to intervene in disarmament 
issues unless specifically asked to do so, by the Council. Max Rustin, 
VOA News, United Nations.
