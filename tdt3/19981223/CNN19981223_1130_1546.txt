Millions of dollars, the reputations of companies and entire universes 
rest in the hands of just a few people in Silicon Valley. Greg Lefevre 
looks at a most influential job -- the video game tester. These guys 
get paid for this? Yes, and it's very important work. Continuous, 
rigorous testing of the latest video game technology. The market's 
exploding -- up 16% to more than $4 billion this year. All those kids 
that played video games ten years ago, they're adults now, and they've 
got even more money to spend. Competition is stiff. Realism is extreme. 
Dave Ross drives to work and drives at work, for electronic arts. 
We've photographed a stuntperson doing all the types of moves you 
would see someone in a Winston cup team doing. Over at 3do, sound 
designer Sean Carson tweaks a fight scene. Five years ago, we would 
have maybe one dying sound, and now maybe we have six. Even the point 
and shoot games demand strategy and planning. Remember, kid, serve, 
protect -- survive. Electronic arts' "future cop lapd" needed something 
more exciting than a cop car. We decided to have something that was 
a little more articulated and a Little more exciting to look at. Yes, 
that's Eric's picture, grafitti-like on the wall. I think what you're 
starting to notice now, however, is that the market for games is really 
spreading out. Meaning older. The average gamebuyer is 24 years old. 
With more women buying, games like "heroes of might" and "magic II" 
are now testing at 3do. But for now, the guy games still dominate. 
And must be tested. I'm getting paid for this? I'm about to die. Greg 
Lefevre, CNN, Redwood city, California.
