Is laughter the best medicine? That's the driving question behind 
the movie "patch Adams." Our Bill Tush caught up with the film's star, 
Robin Williams. I want to learn about people, I want to help them 
with their troubles. That's what I do. But you suck at it. He can't 
stop clowning around. Who better to play it than O Robin Williams? 
It's hard to believe but -- even in terms of clothing he makes me 
look amish. He is a clown. Yochb if he's registered. National clown 
union. I'll tell you something, -- some guys calls in, were you clowning 
without a Union card? Hard to imagine somebody being more outrageous 
than Williams. Donner party of 50 Somebody has got to exercise some 
control and that's what the director comes in. A lot of the comedy 
in this movie was improvised from Robin. We had a wonderful script, 
and he would always get us to certain place and robin would run from 
there That has to be a laugh riot for William' could stars. He would 
go off and tan jentds and we would go, okay, he did his thing. It 
was fantastic, because every one would laugh. That's Monica Potter 
who place his love interest. Here is where the poetic license comes? 
It's actually a man in real life. Really Are you serious? The real 
person was a man who was a good friend of patch Adams But patch, remember 
is real, whacky and a lot taller than the man who plays him. Looks 
like a combination of Salvador Dali and emmett Kelly. And like the 
man he place, Robin Williams believes laughter is the best medicine. 
The hospital will cover all of your bills. Any other questions? Bill 
Tush, CNN Entertainment News New York.
