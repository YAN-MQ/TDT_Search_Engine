In South Africa, suspected actionable violence has led to the killings 
of six men in a pre-dawn raid in a village along the south coast of 
Kwazulu Natau, province. VOA's Johannesburg correspondent, Alex Bolita 
reports. Investigators have launched an intensive manhunt for the 
attackers responsible for the pre-Christmas raid on a village along 
Kwazalulu Natua,'s south coast. Police spokesman, Vishna Nydu, says 
the unknown attackers used both AK-47 assault rifles and machetes, 
in the brutal killings. Fifteen huts were burned to the ground and 
six men, between the ages 40 and 60 were either shot or hacked to 
death. We believe that this attack may be related to section fighting 
in the area. The attack came one day after a judge released five men 
jailed in connection with a politically motivated massacre of 18 people, 
in Kwazulu, Natua, at Christmas, three years ago. The judge found 
they'd been wrongfully convicted. The attackers were supporters of 
the Zulu Nationalist Encotta Freedom party, which has been engaged 
in a long, and often bloody, struggle for political control in the 
province, with backers of the African National Congress. Alex Bolita, 
VOA News, Johannesburg.
