The justice department and the FBI are to launch a full-scale investigation 
into alleged improprieties by Olympic organizers in Salt Lake City, 
Utah. Some members of Salt Lake City's bid committee have been accused 
of giving international Olympic committee members lavish gifts, in 
the effort to garner the 2002 winter games. Sources tell CNN, the 
investigation will focus primarily on fraud and potential tax violations. 
The alleged violations are considered serious, because they may have 
deprived other cities of hosting the Games.
