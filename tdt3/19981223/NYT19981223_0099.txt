Wearable computers are considerably less geeky than they used to be. 
But the day when average Americans wear one as nonchalantly as they 
wear a Walkman CD player is still several years in the future. When 
that day does come, though, Xybernaut Corp. contends it will be poised 
to reap the rewards from a patent portfolio it has been building since 
the early 1990s. This month Xybernaut received its ninth and, the 
company says, most substantial American patent. The latest patent 
covers, for example, a headset operated by a remote computer through 
radio, satellite or cellular transmissions. ``That means you don't 
have to wear the processor,'' said James Ralabate, who was Xerox Corp.'s 
general patent counsel during the 1970s and who is now with Xybernaut. 
``You could have several headsets functioning off a remote host computer, 
for example,'' he said. ``And it covers three types of activation: 
voice, eye and brain activation.'' Not that Xybernaut has such a product 
on the market just yet. Last week it announced its latest model: a 
mostly speech-activated computer powered by a 22-ounce processor that 
straps onto a person's belt and contains 128 megabytes of RAM and 
a 4.3-gigabyte hard drive. This version has a head-mounted display 
system, which gives the same viewing ability as a 15-inch monitor 
viewed at two feet, the company says. ``What you're wearing on your 
belt is essentially your laptop,'' said Michael Jenkins, chief technology 
officer at Xybernaut. Among those testing Xybernaut's technology, 
the company says, are the U.S. Customs Service, Mercedes-Benz, Lockheed-Martin 
and the U.S. Navy. Xybernaut's president, Edward Newman, called the 
latest patent the linchpin in the company's patent portfolio. ``With 
this you can have multiple headsets operated by a remote computer, 
like nodes on a network,'' he said. ``It totally frees up the paradigm 
of wearables. This is the patent we've been waiting for.'' The actual 
technology will require more waiting, however. The company said it 
could not say exactly when such computers would be on the market. 
Xybernaut received patent 5,844,824. Patents are available by number 
for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.
