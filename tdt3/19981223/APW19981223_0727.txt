Boris Yeltsin will make several trips abroad next year since doctors 
have judged him able to travel, the presidential chief of staff said 
Wednesday, according to the Interfax news agency. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 
head of the presidential administration, met with Yeltsin at the president's 
country residence, Gorky-9, just west of Moscow. He told reporters 
after the meeting that Yeltsin planned to travel extensively in Russia 
and would confer with regional governors, as well as the heads of 
political parties, Interfax said. He said that he had talked with 
Yeltsin about ways of increasing the presidential administration's 
influence over political developments in the regions, and proposed 
that Yeltsin should coordinate more with regional governors. The schedule 
for Yeltsin's foreign travels is still being drawn up, but the president 
has promised several foreign leaders that he will visit their countries, 
Bordyuzha was quoted as saying. The administration ``must play an 
active role in the life of the country and help Russia climb out of 
the abyss,'' Bordyuzha said. Bordyuzha, who is also secretary of Yeltsin's 
Security Council, said that ``today there is no sphere of activity 
that doesn't hold danger for the state.'' He said that the presidential 
administration and Security Council would therefore take an active 
role in elaborating legislation, including laws dealing with economic 
reform, political extremism and the fight against economic crime, 
Interfax said. Yeltsin has made only occasional trips to the Kremlin 
recently, spending most of his time at Gorky-9 while recuperating 
from illnesses including a recent bout of pneumonia. He canceled several 
foreign trips in the autumn because of health problems. The 67-year-old 
leader underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago. But 
he insists he has no crippling illness and intends to serve out his 
term, which runs until mid-2000.
