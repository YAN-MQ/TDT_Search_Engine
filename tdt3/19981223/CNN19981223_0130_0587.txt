Two tons of materials including magnesium and titanium are burning 
at a Scrap metal yard southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Firefighters 
say the situation is especially dangerous because water will not put 
out a magnesium and titanium fire. But city firefighters are spraying 
water on nearby buildings to try to keep the flames from spreading. 
Authorities say they do not know if any of the scrap yard employees 
were trapped in the fire.
