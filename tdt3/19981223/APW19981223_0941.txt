The U.S. Justice Department and the FBI on Wednesday formally opened 
an investigation into alleged improprieties in Salt Lake City's successful 
bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. A Justice Department prosecutor 
met in Salt Lake City on Wednesday with FBI and other law enforcement 
officials looking at accusations that members of the Utah bid committee 
used scholarships and other gifts and favors to buy the votes of International 
Olympic Committee members. ``We've opened an investigation into allegations 
of improprieties in connection with the Salt Lake City Olympics bid,'' 
department spokesman Myron Marlin said in Washington. Marlin would 
not elaborate on the possible charges or focus of the investigation. 
Until now, the department said only that it was conducting a preliminary 
review. But after Wednesday's meeting, law enforcement officials decided 
they had enough information to broaden the investigation, law enforcement 
sources said on the condition of anonymity. The formal investigation 
starts immediately. The Justice Department refused to comment on the 
scope or duration of the investigation. In its Wednesday editions, 
national daily USA Today said the preliminary review had focused on 
possible extortion and tax and wire fraud. Should investigators attempt 
to bring a tax fraud case, according to USA Today, they would be required 
to show that Salt Lake organizers misused tax-exempt funds by buying 
the lavish gifts or by financing scholarships for relatives of IOC 
members. The federal probe is the fourth inquiry into the Salt Lake 
allegations, and only one of them is expected to be finished by the 
time the IOC meets to discuss another major issue _ doping. While 
the IOC expects to wrap up its own bribery probe by Jan. 23, at least 
two of the other inquiries won't finish until after a worldwide doping 
summit set for Feb. 2-4. On Tuesday, the U.S. Olympic Committee appointed 
a five-member panel headed by former U.S. Senate leader and Northern 
Ireland peace negotiator George Mitchell. Mitchell, who also was considered 
for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, said the panel would hold its 
first meeting next week and finish work by the end of February. ``We 
have to be thorough, but at the same time we have to do this promptly,'' 
Mitchell said. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee, meanwhile, said 
an investigation by its ethics board would report its findings at 
a Feb. 11 meeting. ``All we need to do is determine what happened, 
at whose hand, and why,'' said Gordon Hall, a former Utah Supreme 
Court justice who heads the SLOC probe. ``I don't envision that it 
will take a long time to do that.''
