Commissioner David Stern will recommend Jan. 7 that the National Basketball 
Association owners cancel the entire season if a a new collective 
bargaining agreement has not been reached by then, a development that 
leaves two weeks for a resolution to the league's costly and calamitous 
labor dispute. Stern has scheduled a special board of governors meeting 
for that date, at which the NBA's labor relations committee will submit 
a report to representatives from the league's 29 teams. ``If we are 
where we are now on Jan. 7, David and I will recommend to the board 
that we cancel the season,'' said deputy commissioner Russ Granik. 
``I expect there to be negotiations before then. But if we don't get 
anywhere _ and there's no reason to think otherwise right now _ we'll 
have done what none of us thought was possible.'' The NBA had not 
lost a game to work stoppage in its 52 years before this season. Now, 
the players and owners are perilously close to becoming the first 
league in professional sports history to lose an entire season to 
labor strife. Already, the first three months of the season has been 
lost and losses in player salaries may exceed $500 million. The day 
after they took out full-page ads in The Los Angeles Times and USA 
Today to portray their side in the lockout, top officials of the National 
Basketball Players Association declined comment on the NBA's deadline. 
But the feeling among many players was that at least they now have 
a date to work with. ``Weeks ago we tried to get the league to establish 
a date, if only to bring immediacy to the negotiations,'' said Danny 
Schayes, a member of the union's negotiating committee. ``If anything, 
it gives us a measuring stick when we have to get a deal. There's 
no question, we now have to meet. We can't make a deal in our living 
rooms. I hope this will spur activity.'' Neither the league nor the 
union is expected to resume talks until after the Christmas holiday, 
possibly as early as Monday. Union executive director Billy Hunter 
returned home to Oakland, Calif., on Tuesday. Stern has been at his 
vacation home in Aspen, Colo., since the weekend. Granik said that 
the two have spoken every day, and that the decision to call the meeting 
rested with Stern. Stern and Granik have resisted requests to decide 
on a drop-dead date, believing that if a deal were close to being 
consummated, a deadline would serve no purpose than to apply undue 
pressure to the process. But Wednesday they appeared to conclude that 
any agreement signed after the first week of January may not be profitable 
enough for the owners or legitimate enough to the fans to take the 
risk. ``At some point we have to face up to the facts,'' Granik said, 
when asked why a date was finally picked. ``We can't lose the season 
without a board meeting. It just became obvious with how things we're 
going. At least as of that date, we'll know where we're headed.'' 
Before the announcement Wednesday, Day No. 175 of the lockout was 
proceeding like many others; no talks and no hope of an immediate 
settlement. The last round of bargaining took place 11 days ago, a 
session that broke off after less than an hour. Hunter and Granik 
have admitted that a deal could be hashed out in 24 hours, but the 
union has been much more optimistic than the league about actually 
having a season. While baseball has had eight work stoppages since 
1972, including a 232-day strike that wiped out the 1994 World Series, 
it has never lost an entire season. The National Football League and 
the National Hockey League played through both world wars and, like 
baseball, never lost an entire season of competition to labor strife. 
In 1919, the Stanley Cup playoffs were not completed due to a flu 
epidemic. But none of those players ever lost $1.1 billion in salaries, 
the price tag for the players if the season is canceled. Patrick Ewing 
has lost $6.1 million so far, nearly a third of his annual salary 
of $18.5 million, currently the league's highest. An additional $300 
million to $400 million in leaguewide revenues would be lost as well. 
Meanwhile, the players' full-page ad, which began ``Setting the Record 
Straight,'' did not do much to break the stalemate, according to Granik. 
``It shows to me why we are exactly where we are,'' Granik said of 
the ad, which contained charts, graphs and full explanations about 
the players' positions. ``We're about ready to cancel the season. 
To come out with that kind of rhetoric ... it almost seems like the 
union wants to guarantee that we cancel the season.''
