Former President Suharto might be named a suspect in a probe of corruption 
during his 32 years of authoritarian rule, Indonesia's top prosecutor 
said Wednesday. A decision to label Suharto a suspect would be a big 
step forward in the government inquiry into the wealth of his family, 
which is estimated to be worth billions of dollars. Under Indonesian 
law, people are named as suspects after preliminary questioning but 
before formal charges are filed in a criminal case. Critics have alleged 
that Suharto, who quit in May after riots and protests, amassed a 
fortune by siphoning off state wealth for the benefit of his children 
and associates. Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib said there was 
a possibility of taking the legal step of naming Suharto a suspect, 
the official Antara news agency reported. ``Based on the statements 
of witnesses, it leads in that direction,'' Ghalib said. ``However, 
we cannot hastily draw such a conclusion. We need some rechecking.'' 
President B.J. Habibie, under pressure from student protesters who 
want Suharto to be put on trial, had ordered Ghalib to intensify the 
investigation of his predecessor. Critics have alleged that Habibie 
is too compromised by his links to Suharto to conduct a serious investigation 
of the 77-year-old ex-army general. On Dec. 9, government prosecutors 
questioned Suharto for four hours about corruption allegations. The 
questions related to multimillion-dollar charitable foundations formerly 
under his control, a national car project run by one of his sons with 
huge tax breaks, the contents of his bank accounts and presidential 
decrees that allegedly benefited his family and friends.
