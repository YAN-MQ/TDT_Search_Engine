Meanwhile, the International committee of the Red Cross says it is 
alarmed by renewed fighting between rebel forces and Nigerian-led 
West African Ecomog troops outside the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown. 
Lisa Schlein, in Geneva, says the Red Cross reports, "Fighting is 
continuing for a second day in satellite towns east of Freetown." 
The Red Cross says rebels allied with Sierra Leone's ousted military 
junta, have been threatening to enter Freetown, in the last few weeks, 
and free their imprisoned leader. Red Cross information officer, Michael 
Kliner, says the agency is very concerned that the rebels appear to 
be making good on their threat. Shooting has been heard at the entrance 
of the town, Ackese, and north east of the peninsula of Freetown. 
When fighting hits there, that usually means that the situation is 
accelerating. In response to the dangerous situation, Mr. Kliner says 
the Red Cross has sent 12 of its staff members out of the capital 
to safer areas. And, he says the Red Cross has restricted the movements 
of the 12 Red Cross delegates, who remain in Freetown. He says Red 
Cross delegates cannot move freely around the town. They are only 
allowed to go to the Red Cross office, two nearby residences, and 
to work in the hospitals. The personnel in Freetown includes a complete 
surgical team, which is able to continue to work in the surgical hospital 
that the IRC's operating in Freetown, and we also maintaining contact 
with local authorities, with the echomode military authority, that 
are present in the town, and continuing to monitor the situation, 
and try to resume activities as soon as the situation allows. Mr. 
Kliner says the Red Cross doesn't know how many people have been wounded, 
or may have been killed, during the fighting. But, he says there are 
reports of wounded people arriving at the hospital in Freetown. He 
says Liberia has closed its border with Sierra Leone, and he says 
a number of checkpoints have been closed, preventing people from moving 
outside the area of conflict. Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency says 
that it has no information of refugees fleeing to neighboring countries. 
However, it says it does have reports that large numbers of people 
have become internally displaced in Sierra Leone, as the result of 
this latest fighting. Lisa Schlein, for VOA News, Geneva.
