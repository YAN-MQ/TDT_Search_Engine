It's only the second day of the season, but already winter has arrived 
with a vengeance in many parts of the U.S. The World's David LaValley 
reports. The season's first real blast of cold air iced the nation 
from southern California to New England and is creating some havoc. 
Ice was blamed for a 59-car pile-up in Austin, Texas. Residents in 
central New York are digging out after nearly 20 inches of snow fell. 
A freeze warning was in effect today for orange growers in California. 
And in New York's Central Park, strollers are now bracing against 
wind chills nearly 30 degrees lower than yesterday's high. For others, 
the winter weather is welcome. It ended a snow drought in some eastern 
ski areas and whitened the landscape for the holidays. The nation's 
capital wasn't even spared. Forecasters say Washington is in store 
for one inch to three inches of snow by tomorrow. For The World, I'm 
David LaValley.
