Ex-NATO secretary general Willy Claes received a three-year suspended 
jail sentence Wednesday after being convicted of corruption in two 
defense contracts he awarded as economics minister in the late 1980s. 
After a four-month trial, the supreme court also gave two-year suspended 
sentences each to ex-defense minister Guy Coeme, 52, former vice-premier 
Guy Spitaels, 67, and Serge Dassault, 75, head of France's Dassault 
aviation concern after convicting them of corruption, too. Eight former 
aides and associates received suspended sentences of up to two years. 
All defendants lost their civic rights meaning they cannot vote in 
elections or run for office for up to five years. The court said Claes, 
60, had to know that when Italy's Agusta SpA said it was ready to 
pay 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) to win a December, 1988, 
contract for 46 army helicopters, it was a bribe for his Dutch-speaking 
socialist party. ``It is not excluded that, prior to awarding the 
contract, (Claes) gave his assent to his chief cabinet aide to accept 
the offer made by Agusta,'' Marc Lahousse, the court's presiding judge, 
said in a summation of the case that took four hours to read out. 
He said Claes' and others bent the contract rules at the expense of 
France's Aerospatiale SA which had a valid rival bid for helicopters. 
The court also found Dassault Aviation SA's gift of 60 million francs 
(dlrs 1.62 million) to grease a June, 1989, deal to equip Belgian 
F-16 jets with new electronics was a bribe to beat rival Litton Industries 
Inc. of the United States. Another 30 million francs (almost dlrs 
900,000) from Dassault ended up in the coffers of French-speaking 
socialists. The Agusta and Dassault contracts were worth hundreds 
of millions of dollars each. Claes and the other 11 defendants went 
on trial Sept. 2, pleading innocent. All attended the sentencing hearing. 
In addition to suspended jail terms, Claes and three former aides 
were ordered to repay 110 million francs (dlrs 3.2 million). Appeal 
to the high court ruling is not possible. Claes issued a brief statement 
calling the case against him politically motivated and said he would 
launch an appeal with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, 
France. ``The logic of prosecution, which earlier led to my resignation 
as NATO secretary general, demanded a conviction,'' he said. ``This 
is totally unjust (and) I don't accept it.'' An appeal to the human 
rights court will take years and will not suspend implementation of 
Claes' conviction and sentence in Belgium. Other defendants sounded 
equally bitter. ``In the 11 years, 12th graf
