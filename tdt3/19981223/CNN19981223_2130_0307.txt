British entrepreneur Richard Branson is expected to float over Japan 
tomorrow, as he continues his attempt to circle the globe. Branson 
told the BBC he expects to cross the American border on Christmas 
day, possibly over Washington state. The ground crew of the project 
says the leg over the pacific ocean will be the most dangerous. The 
balloon took off December 18th from Morocco, and Branson and crew 
hope to end their voyage by touching down in western Europe.
