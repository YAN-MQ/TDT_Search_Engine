It's been four gaze since the U.S. military halted their air strikes 
on Iraq and now we're getting word on how much the operation cost. 
650 bombing runs by fighter jets cost $11 million. The Pentagon spent 
nearly $1 billion to fire and replace the tomahawk tomahawk and cruise 
missiles used. But there are costs that can't be measured in dollars. 
NBC's donatella lorch reports from Baghdad. Life in Baghdad is back 
to normal. Students are back at school since massive air strikes, 
back to classrooms crippled by sanctions. At a junior high school, 
teenagers study in ramshackle rooms with no welcome trissity. Are 
you angry about that? Yes, I am very angry about this because this 
is my country and this is my pupils, my family. Like many Iraqi teenagers 
he dreams of becoming a doctor but under these conditions he'll be 
learning skills decades out of date of the they are called the sanction 
general -- generation, young Iraqis who do not remember life without 
sanctions or bombings. And those who do make it face a daunt is problem, 
no new text books or medical equipment. In this medical school, they 
are short of all lab equipment and microscopes are out of order. I 
feel like ni my rights have been taken away from me and others in 
my generation. He is worried about the young children here. I had 
a happy childhood in comparison to what I see now. Children are being 
deprived of food, medicine, even toys. Boutte but out of suffering 
comes a stubbornness and strength passed down from teacher to student. 
I am going to struggle, to learn, to stand and show the others I am 
a human being and try to live peacefully with others. A daunting task 
for this country locked in conflict with the United States.
