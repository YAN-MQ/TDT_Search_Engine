In a moment, handcuffs and hard time. Have you made your reservations? 
Time is running out on Buick's swing into '99. And for a short time 
only, we've got numbers that'll make your head spin. And a new twist-- 
but these numbers won't be around much longer so better jump now. 
Swing into your Buick dealer today. Out here, am I supposed to say, 
"slow down, I'm constipated"? I don't think so. So I rely on doctor-recommended 
metamucil. It works with my body, gently. Which is important to a 
sensitive guy like myself. With the dremel rotary tool system, you 
can create a sign, cut drywall, clean gunky faucets, reslot a stripped 
screw, add a drain hole, debarb a Fish hook, remove old grout and 
more. The dremel rotary tool. for more than 65 years, it's been the 
one tool to count on. Did I mention it cuts? It hurts so bad. That 
burning sensation. So I saw my doctor. He said where heartburn hurts 
most is where Mylanta works fast. All down through here where you 
want help fast.
