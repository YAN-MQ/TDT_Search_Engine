The Indonesian government has formally declared its intention to ratify 
next year three conventions of the International Labor Organization 
on human rights, a report said Wednesday. A letter of intent to ratify 
the conventions was signed Wednesday by Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris 
and ILO Director in Jakarta, Iftikhar Ahmed, witnessed by President 
B.J. Habibie, the official Antara news agency said. Under the letter 
of intent, Jakarta reaffirms its commitment to ratify the remaining 
three core conventions by June 1999, Antara said, quoting a statement 
from ILO office. The three conventions were No. 105 on the abolition 
of forced labor, No. 111 on discrimination, employment and occupation, 
and No. 138 on the minimum age of employment. The ratification would 
make Indonesia the first East Asia country to ratify all seven of 
the ILO's all seven fundamental human rights conventions. the statement 
said. Indonesia has already ratified ILO Conventions on the freedom 
of association and the right to organize, forced labor, the right 
to organize and collective bargaining, and equal remuneration. Some 
40 countries have ratified all seven conventions while 55 other have 
endorsed six of the seven, the statement said. Habibie, who replaced 
authoritarian President Suharto in May, has relaxed tight restrictions 
on labor unions and delivered a list of liberalizing reforms by opening 
the door to freedom of expression and association. Suharto resigned 
amid widespread violence and student-led protests against his 32-year 
authoritarian rule.
