Thousands of South Korean riot police have stormed a Buddhist temple 
in Seoul, ending a long standoff between rival monks. Dozens of police, 
and monks, were injured, some seriously, when officers raided the 
Chugea Temple, Wednesday. Authorities fired water cannons, and tear 
gas, to force their way into the temple, which is being occupied by 
about 100 monks. The monks responded to the attack by throwing firebombs 
and rocks. Some of the monks, also, cut themselves in protest and 
threatened to set themselves on fire. Dozen's of monks, and their 
followers, were arrested after the clash.
