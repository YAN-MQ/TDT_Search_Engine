A new report by a media expert, says minorities, especially older 
women and Hispanics, are badly misrepresented on American television. 
The study was conducted for the Screen Actor's Guild by George Gerbner, 
a telecommunications professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania. He says, aging women are usually portrayed as evil, 
and unappealing on situation comedies and dramas. Professor Gerbner 
also said, Hispanics, Asians, the disabled and Native Americans are 
rarely seen on these programs in proportion to their actual population. 
And, that Hispanics are often used as villains, instead of leading 
characters. The study says of all minorities, only African-Americans 
are properly represented on television.
