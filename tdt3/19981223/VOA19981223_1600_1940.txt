Israel says it will retaliate for cross border rocket barrages by 
Lebanon's Hizbollah guerrillas, Wednesday morning. Prime Minister, 
Netanyahu, issued the warning during a visit to the border region, 
where 16 Israeli civilians were injured. Hizbollah was responding 
to an Israeli air strike, Tuesday, that killed eight Lebanese civilians, 
including a woman and six of her children.
