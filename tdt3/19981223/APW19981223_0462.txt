Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin was freed Wednesday by Yasser 
Arafat's Palestinian Authority after nearly two months of house arrest. 
The move is likely to heighten tensions between the Palestinians and 
Israel, coming as the two sides accuse each other of violations of 
the now-stalled Wye River land-for-security accord. A spokesman for 
Hamas, Mahmoud Zahar, said the group welcomed the decision to free 
Yassin. Israel has repeatedly said Arafat has not done enough to fight 
Islamic militants like Hamas. Word of Yassin's release drew new criticism 
from Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel. ``The Palestinian Authority 
has to decide whether it wants to meet its commitments to fight Hamas 
terror and move the peace process forward or turn a blind eye to the 
terrorist activities of the Hamas leadership,'' Fogel said. The frail, 
ailing Yassin, who uses a wheelchair, was not expected to make any 
public appearances until later in the week, Hamas sources said. With 
the lifting of the house arrest, he was expected to receive a few 
close associates. During his house arrest, he was prevented from receiving 
visitors. Yassin was put under house arrest on Oct. 29, after a Hamas 
activist killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to blow up a bus 
full of Israeli schoolchildren. The attack came only six days after 
the signing of the Wye River accord. Yassin's house arrest, which 
deeply angered his supporters, was one of Arafat's strongest steps 
yet against Hamas. At one point, in a leaflet signed by its military 
wing, Hamas demanded his release and made a rare direct threat against 
Arafat. The militant group opposes any peace with Israel and has carried 
out more than a dozen suicide bombings over the past several years.
