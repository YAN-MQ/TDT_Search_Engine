Sudan's lawmakers on Wednesday selected the country's most influential 
politician as Parliament speaker two days after he had resigned to 
work full time for the ruling party. Members in the 400-seat National 
Assembly unanimously supported Muslim cleric Hassan Turabi in a voice 
vote amid shouts of ``Allahu Akbar'' or ``God is great.'' Turabi did 
not attend the session. Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported late 
Wednesday that Turabi later visited the Parliament and told the legislators 
he would accept the post. He can hold it until the end of the Parliament's 
term in April 2000. Turabi had submitted his resignation on Monday, 
saying he wanted to devote all his time to the ruling National Congress 
Party as Sudan moves toward a multi-party system starting Jan. 1. 
The formal submission followed weeks of rumors _ and then confirmed 
reports _ that he planned to leave the position. Turabi's re-nomination 
took place without any hitch. Deputy Speaker Alison Manani Magaya 
opened the session by asking for nominations to fill the speaker's 
post. Another deputy speaker, Abdul-Aziz Shidou, proposed Turabi's 
name. No other name was proposed and the proceedings were called to 
an end. Magaya then told the legislators: ``Dr. Turabi could resume 
his post anytime he wants.'' On Tuesday, Sudanese Vice President Ali 
Osman Mohammed Taha had called on legislators to respect Turabi's 
wish to resign. Taha said his statement was endorsed by President 
Omar el-Bashir. A new law recently passed by el-Bashir's government 
will legalize political groupings starting Jan. 1. They will be allowed 
to contest elections. El-Bashir had banned all political parties after 
seizing power in a 1989 military coup. He said recently that the door 
was open for opposition politicians in exile to come back and form 
political associations. But the presence of the hard-line Turabi at 
the head of Parliament has cast doubts on the seriousness of the government's 
willingness to allow the opposition to flourish. There was no immediate 
reaction from the opposition to Turabi's re-nomination. There also 
was apprehension that the new law speaks only of ``political associations.'' 
Turabi had strongly opposed the demand by some Parliament members 
for a clear-cut reference to ``political parties.''
