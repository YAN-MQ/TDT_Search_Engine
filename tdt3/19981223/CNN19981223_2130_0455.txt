New Jersey governor Christie Whitman says it was a miracle there weren't 
more serious injuries during a 60-mile police chase on the New Jersey 
turnpike. The driver of a tractor-trailer was shot three times and 
critically wounded, after running several vehicles off the road. A 
state trooper was shot in the foot. The chase started after the driver 
was pulled over for speeding. He kicked an officer in the head and 
fled.
