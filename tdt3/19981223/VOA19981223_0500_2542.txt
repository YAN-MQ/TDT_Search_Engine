The world's first surviving octuplets, eight babies, are clinging 
to life in a hospital in the U.S. city of Houston, Texas. With doctors 
optimistic about their survival, right now, the eight babies -- six 
girls and two boys, they are -- are in critical, but stable condition 
at Texas Children's Hospital. Although no great progress is reported 
in the babies' health, doctors say that, in premature birth cases, 
no news is good news for now. The smallest baby, a girl, weighs just 
320 grams and can fit in the palm of a woman's hand. She's the one 
who concerns doctors the most. Seven of the babies are on ventilators, 
and all are being fed intravenously. Meanwhile the mother, 27-year 
old Nigerian-born, Enkemp Choukal, is said to be in very good spirits. 
She's expected to go home by the end of the week. But, her eight children 
could remain in the hospital for a least two months.
