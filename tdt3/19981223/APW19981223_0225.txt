French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said the U.N. Security Council 
should set up a new system of continuous surveillance to prevent Iraq 
from producing weapons of mass destruction. ``The time has come for 
the Security Council ... to assume its responsibilities and adopt 
a new system. Which one? Not a system investigating the past, but 
a system of precautions for the future,'' Vedrine said in an interview 
in Wednesday's edition of the daily Liberation. ``Continuous control 
would consist, first of all, of surveying any resumption by Iraq of 
the manufacture of banned weapons. It would also aim to prevent the 
continuous deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Iraq,'' 
he said. Vedrine added that such a method would provide the basis 
for an eventual lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq after the 1991 
Gulf War. France was critical of the U.S. and British airstrikes on 
Iraq and has long called for a lifting of sanctions. The United States 
has rejected France's proposal for a new arms control system in Iraq 
and wants to keep UNSCOM, the U.N. special commission on arms inspection, 
in place.
