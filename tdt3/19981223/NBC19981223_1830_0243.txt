With just one full day of shopping left until Christmas, the American 
economy continues to roar along on almost every front. And that translates 
into the sweetest sound for retailers and wholesalers -- Big sales. 
NBC's Jim Avila with more on that tonight. There's no crisis at the 
mall. The attack on Iraq. The historic impeachment of the president. 
And still America shops. Two good years in a row, the best since 1984. 
Sales are up pretty dramatically over the last year. That is, perhaps, 
the hidden story here. In fact, the average American will buy 25 presents 
for Christmas this year, spend $814 on gifts -- up 4.5% from the $779 
spent a year ago. Joyce Graham spent $1,200 for her family. I think 
Americans are feeling more confident. I think the Clinton issue -- 
I feel more people are thinking it's a Personal issue between him 
and his wife. Experts say the American confidence level is at an all-time 
high. 0% believe their jobs are secure until the year 2000. Rutgers 
University professor Lionel Tiger wrote a book on America's unique 
optimism. People don't seem to think they need to save money for a 
rainy day, because they don't see what that rainy day will be. There's 
a whole shopping generation under 25 that have never lived in a recession. 
And the great depression is now 60 years away. Kristen haar says her 
mother tells her about the days of strict Christmas budgets. But personal 
economic fear is a complete stranger. I haven't ever had a problem 
or wondered if I would ever have enough money. And the sunny American 
attitude is good for the country. The dean of northwestern's Kellogg 
school of management was out shopping for electronics today, confident 
that American optimism is a Self-fulfilling prophecy. If we all consume 
well and we all act as if there is no problems for the future, we're 
going to consume and we're going to invest. And if we consume and 
we invest, things will be well. I call it the "virtual cycle." And 
with sales up 5%, the American economy calls it "merry christmas."
