The U.S. Olympic Committee has appointed a special panel to investigate 
bribery allegations in connection with Salt Lake City's bid to host 
the 2002 Winter Olympics. Former U.S. Senate Majority Leader, George 
Mitchell, will head the panel, and expects to report to the USOC by 
the end of February. Any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, the panel 
discovers, will be turned over to prosecutors. International Olympic 
Committee and the Salt Lake organizer committee are also investigating 
the alleged bribery. The IOC has already said it will not withdraw 
the 2002 Winter Olympics from Salt Lake City. Salt Lake spokesman, 
Frank Zang, told VOA sports the city is dedicated to staging a successful 
Olympics. You know, Salt Lake may prove to be a catalyst for long-term 
reform in the Olympic movement. Changes are taking place. And these 
investigations will provide further examination and recommendations 
for the future. A report, earlier this month, said a scholarship fund 
run by the Salt Lake organizers had benefited relatives of six IOC 
members.
