Italy's premier on Wednesday denied reports that his center-left government 
was involved in negotiations to send Turkish Kurdish rebel chief Abdullah 
Ocalan to a third country, saying the leader was free to go where 
he pleased. Italian and Turkish newspapers in recent days have been 
filled with reports claiming Ocalan, whose detention here Nov. 12 
created an international incident, was about to be kicked out of Italy. 
The list of countries mentioned include Estonia, South Africa, Libya, 
Pakistan and South Africa. But Premier Massimo D'Alema said a ruling 
by Rome's appeals court last week to lift all restrictions on Ocalan 
made him free to choose his own destiny. ``The most probable outcome 
is that Ocalan will leave the country,'' D'Alema said during a year-end 
news conference. ``But for this to happen Ocalan must decide on his 
own.'' D'Alema insisted that there were ``no negotiations of any kind 
underway'' to find a country which would take Ocalan. Corriere della 
Sera daily on Wednesday quoted an Italian Communist lawmaker who had 
met with Ocalan as saying the Kurd was refusing to leave Italy unless 
he was guaranteed a safe haven elsewhere. Ocalan, who heads the Kurdistan 
Workers Party, or PKK, had requested political asylum in Italy. Italian 
RAI state television, however, said Ocalan's departure was a matter 
of hours or at the most, days. Ocalan's arrival in Italy on a flight 
from Moscow unleashed a political and legal battle with Turkey, which 
wants him extradited so he can be tried on terrorism charges. Italy 
has refused to extradite Ocalan citing Italian laws that prevent the 
extradition of suspects to countries where they face the death penalty, 
as is the case with Ocalan in Turkey. Earlier this week a Rome magistrate 
indicated that Ocalan could be extradited for crimes that do not carry 
the death penalty. D'Alema said it was up to the courts to decide 
on the matter and insisted that Italy would ``fully abide'' its laws. 
Italy's refusal to extradite Ocalan angered the Turkish government 
and people, prompting unofficial boycotts of Italian goods. On Wednesday, 
D'Alema said the ``tensions'' with Turkey had been ``overcome'' and 
expressed optimism about a solution to the impasse. Close to 37,000 
people have been killed since Ocalan's group began fighting for autonomy 
in southeast Turkey in 1984.
