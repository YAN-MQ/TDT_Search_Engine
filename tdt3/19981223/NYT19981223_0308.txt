In ``Stepmom,'' Julia Roberts plays the nicest person ever to wear 
black at a downtown photo shoot. She's a talented photographer so 
nice that she seems more interested in her boyfriend's children than 
in the man himself (Ed Harris). She's definitely too nice to have 
broken up his marriage to the suburban mama lion played by Susan Sarandon, 
in a story with enough suds to take care of your 1999 laundry needs. 
What could be worse for this woman than learning she has terminal 
cancer? You know what: getting used to the prospect of Julia Roberts 
taking her place. Tomatoes at the ready, you can expect to loathe 
all this for very good reasons, from the platitudes coughed up by 
five screenwriters to the same sunny unreality Chris Columbus brought 
to ``Home Alone.'' (Everyone lives in a shelter magazine, be it a 
downtown loft or a suburban monument to home and hearth.) There's 
also this past year's favorite Hollywood preoccupation, the death 
thing, which is handled quite differently from the way it was in the 
other dying mother story, ``One True Thing.'' In that film, death 
was a domestic tragedy; here it's more of a learning experience. Ms. 
Sarandon's Jackie is together enough to bop with the children to a 
Motown song just after they've heard the really bad news. Still, ``Stepmom'' 
has a couple of secret weapons. These two actresses are so galvanized 
and team up so well that the women's relationship soon upstages anything 
having to do with the man. (The chemistry between Ms. Roberts' Isabel 
and Harris' Luke is negligible enough to make rumors that they have 
been showering together sound highly exaggerated.) Both Ms. Roberts 
and especially Ms. Sarandon, who has the much more believable role, 
go through their motions with unexpected conviction and make the film 
a lot more watchable than it has any right to be. The howlers here 
are almost a form of inadvertent fun. (Isabel has no problem dropping 
everything in SoHo and easily dashing up the Hudson whenever the children 
need help.) For every terrible contrivance in the script _ like the 
inevitable sequence where a little boy gets lost in Central Park, 
then winds up holding court at the police station _ there is a glimmer 
of substance here, too. To its credit, the film doesn't sugarcoat 
its women too monstrously, and it lets real conflicts and opinions 
occasionally creep in. Both actresses are executive producers of the 
rare Hollywood film to incorporate Woody Guthrie's ``This Land Is 
Your Land'' and letting Ms. Sarandon warn a dishonest child about 
looking like . . . ``Well, he's not President anymore, so why be petty?'' 
The story begins on a note of glossy animosity, with Ms. Roberts running 
afoul of both children, 12-year-old Anna (Jena Malone) and 7-year-old 
Ben (Liam Aiken) every time she tries to be sweet. ``Stepmom'' would 
like you to believe that even a smiling, ever patient Julia Roberts 
presenting the gift of a new puppy is not enough to cut the mustard 
here. ``I'll handle it from here, Isabel,'' snaps Jackie when Isabel 
hands over the children, prompting a refreshingly catty, ``I'm sure 
you will, Jackie'' in reply. But Isabel tries so hard that she makes 
little inroads all the same. Meanwhile Jackie is sharpening her zingers 
about Isabel and campaigning mightily for the title Mother of the 
Year. On the level of crafts projects alone, ``Stepmom'' is enough 
to make real life pale, yet Ms. Sarandon somehow manages to keep all 
that quilting from overshadowing the woman she plays. Her Jackie is 
tart and fiery, in a snappishly good performance that would be affecting 
even without the multi-hanky dialogue. (``You know how a caterpillar 
becomes something else? Just think of me flying off somewhere.'') 
She tries her best to keep this story human even when it heads toward 
a happily-ever-after ending in which somebody still dies. Columbus 
gives the film a lavish look and a thick skin about storytelling cliches, 
directing the most contrived encounters as if they were utterly new. 
Motown music is tacked on as heavily as possible, working overtime 
to make feeling bad another way of feeling good. PRODUCTION NOTES:
