A Christmas tradition of reconciliation has finally united Poland's 
polarized political opponents. But only on radio. Listeners of private 
Radio Zet, a nationwide station, for the past week have heard the 
voices of former communists and leading members of the Solidarity 
movement that toppled communist rule mixed together in singing Wsrod 
Nocnej Ciszy (In The Quiet of the Night), a popular Polish carol. 
The broadcaster had 15 politicians and public figures, including Solidarity 
leader Marian Krzaklewski and ex-communist leader Leszek Miller, sing 
the carol individually, a Radio Zet technician said Wednesday. Then 
it took a line or two from each version to compile the completed song. 
Some of the voices are decidedly off-key, while others sound better, 
particularly those of ex-communists Danuta Waniek, who ran the successful 
1995 electoral campaign for President Aleksander Kwasniewski, and 
Izabella Sierakowska, an outspoken, hardline leftist parliament deputy. 
Solidarity founder and former President Lech Walesa declined to sing, 
claiming he has no voice. But he cues the carol with a word pun in 
Polish that translates to ``Known people sing carols only with us.''
