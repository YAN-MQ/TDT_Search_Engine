A bipartisan panel of senior senators may play a big role in president 
clinton's upcoming impeachment trial. CNN has learned majority leader 
Trent Lott plans to create the panel, which could recommend some sort 
of compromise involving censure. But as wolf Blitzer reports, a major 
sticking point remains. It's a key ingredient of virtually every proposed 
censure compromise, but vice President Al Gore insists President Clinton 
is not about to accept it. The president has said that he did not 
lie under oath. He has acknowledged that he gave statements that were 
less than helpful to his interrogators, and he was misleading. But 
that's a very different proposition. But that's precisely the problem. 
If the president hopes to avoid a full-scale Senate trial, he may 
have to admit he did lie under oath. His aides say he's refused to 
do so for two reasons -- first, he doesn't believe he did, even though 
he concedes he misled the court. Second, his lawyers fear it would 
leave him in permanent legal jeopardy. On this second point, some 
presidential supporters see one way out -- the senate could provide 
him with immunity. The vice president, who continues to insist the 
president will never resign, also promises the White House will be 
careful in its overtures to the Senate. You will not see a lobbying 
campaign where the president and I are buttonholing senators. That's 
not something that feels like it's appropriate in this situation. 
For his part, Mr. Clinton continues to project business as usual -- 
On this day in Baltimore unveiling a new, $1.1 billion budget for 
the homeless. Maryland governor parris glendening had refused to appear 
with the president early on during the Lewinsky scandal, but no longer. 
We need you at the helm as we continue to help Americans reach their 
individual potential. Mr. president, did you get all your shopping 
done? Not quite. But it was good. In between everything else, the 
president bought some last-minute christmas gifts. In trying to maintain 
the momentum for censure, the White House is anxious to move quickly, 
before the other side can reverse that momentum, as they earlier did 
in the house. Wolf Blitzer, CNN, the White House.
