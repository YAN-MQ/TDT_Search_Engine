I'll remember 1998 as the year I spied a display box with rows of 
what looked, from a distance, like identical videotapes with black-and-flame-colored 
covers. But at close range it turned out to hold two different titles 
packaged in suspiciously similar ways. Each featured the oversize, 
noble heads of its actors against a blazing backdrop. Each signaled 
a tale of something terribly important at stake. Each beckoned with 
the portentous look of an experience not to be missed, not even in 
4-by-7-inch form. One was ``Gone With the Wind.'' The other was ``Armageddon,'' 
1998's most idiotic hit and biggest box office winner, and the distance 
between such landmarks is shrinking all the time. For audiences clobbered 
by indifferent star vehicles and formula films (or both, in the case 
of ``Meet Joe Black''), this was a year with almost no major movie 
events worth talking about _ though the gratifying exception, ``Saving 
Private Ryan,'' tore up the studio rule book and made viewers eager 
for an unfashionably wrenching spectacle in the summertime. Otherwise, 
the mainstream came no closer than the overrated ``Truman Show'' to 
a thought-provoking popular success, though ``Shakespeare in Love'' 
looks like a high-end crowd-pleaser for the winter season. But outside 
the realm of mall movies and out on the margins, there was much to 
admire. Great films were few, but there were more than enough good 
ones for anyone who knew where to find them. If the bad news is that 
not many of the year's best films got the attention they deserved 
on the first go-round, the good news is that 4-by-7-inch second chance. 
Catch up with some of the titles to follow and you'll find the other 
1998, the darker, riskier film year that outshone the dull high-profile 
one. The three D's of 1998 _ doppelgangers, dummies and death _ were 
its most visible and bizarre trends. Do great minds merely think alike, 
or is some subversive synergy leading to echolalia on the creative 
front? Though each of these films had its own distinct origins, we 
nonetheless saw double when it came to bugs (``Antz,'' ``A Bug's Life''), 
battle (``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``The Thin Red Line''), mortally 
ill mothers (``One True Thing'' ``Stepmom''), meteors (``Deep Impact,'' 
``Armageddon''), totalitarian television-age fantasy (``The Truman 
Show,'' ``Pleasantville''), deliciously sly gay gentlemen (John Hurt 
in ``Love and Death on Long Island,'' Ian McKellen in ``Gods and Monsters'') 
and bleak, wintry tales that cut to the bone (``Affliction'' ``A Simple 
Plan''). Brendan Gleeson, one of the year's best actors along with 
Nick Nolte, McKellen and Tom Hanks, even turned up twice as larger-than-life 
Irish gangsters, in ``The General'' and ``I Went Down.'' As for the 
dummies, this year they got smart. ``There's Something About Mary,'' 
the great guilty pleasure of 1998, was much too amusingly contrived 
by the Farrelly brothers to qualify as mere hair-gel humor, with Matt 
Dillon's dim detective cornering the market on dopey wit. And after 
``The Wedding Singer'' and ``The Waterboy,'' Adam Sandler's single-digit-IQ 
bit will never look like cinema verite again. Best and sneakiest of 
all was ``The Big Lebowski,'' the Coen brothers' overlooked off-the-wall 
gem in which Jeff Bridges, in the unlikeliest of the year's best acting 
performances, brought hilarious panache to playing a blissfully out-to-lunch 
California dude. Audiences who flocked to broad humor this year weren't 
showing a strange taste for pie fights and bathroom gags. They were 
simply going where the real fun was. Perhaps that's because 1998's 
most conspicuous Hollywood vogue was for the sugarcoated demise, which 
cast its pall despite lunatic efforts to give it a feel-good spin. 
Sentimental afterworld stories never go out of style, but what this 
year offered wasn't the same old sexy-pottery scenario. Death became 
a learning experience, a new phase of personal growth, a post-human 
snowman, a black-tie fete, an occasion for special crafts projects 
_ anything but a bummer, and when it was dealt with painfully (``One 
True Thing'') it didn't fly. Buoyant denial prevailed. It was it's-my-party-and-I'll-die-if-I-want-to 
time. One more thing: 1998 was especially unhelpful to the makers 
of 10-best lists, since there were few towering works but an abundance 
of very good ones. Beyond my particular Top 10 _ ``Saving Private 
Ryan,'' ``Happiness,'' ``The Butcher Boy,'' ``Shakespeare in Love,'' 
``Henry Fool,'' ``The Celebration,'' ``A Simple Plan,'' ``The Opposite 
of Sex,'' ``Bulworth'' and ``Western''_ there was much more worthy 
of special notice. Among this season's films alone, I especially admired 
``The General,'' John Boorman's razor-sharp, beautifully shot portrait 
of the wily Irish thief Martin Cahill, and Paul Schrader's bleak, 
riveting ``Affliction,'' with Nick Nolte and James Coburn locked in 
explosive father-son fury. The enrapturing beauty and peculiar naivete 
of ``The Thin Red Line'' heightened the impression of Terrence Malick 
as the Brian Wilson of the film world. Also outstanding: ``Central 
Station,'' with a great performance from Fernanda Montenegro; and 
``Hilary and Jackie,'' a deep, psychologically rich portrait of the 
du Pre sisters as musical prodigies and sibling rivals, with Emily 
Watson mesmerizing and raw as the more flamboyant Jacqueline. Other 
actresses who did spellbinding work this year were Ally Sheedy as 
a jaded recluse in ``High Art,'' Samantha Morton immersing herself 
in the emotional turmoil of ``Under the Skin,'' Christina Ricci as 
the perfect foil in ``Buffalo 66'' and the teen queen of comic malevolence 
in ``The Opposite of Sex,'' Joan Allen shaking off 1950s propriety 
in ``Pleasantville,'' Thandie Newton and Kimberly Elise in the intense 
sisterhood of ``Beloved,'' and the ``One True Thing'' co-stars Meryl 
Streep and Renee Zellwegger also doing fine work in other films (``Dancing 
at Lughnasa'' and ``A Price Above Rubies,'' respectively.) Dominique 
Swain hovered startlingly between womanhood and childhood in Adrian 
Lyne's impressive ``Lolita,'' which also offered a fine, harrowing 
performance from Jeremy Irons. Tartly good Susan Sarandon shone through 
the soap and baloney of ``Stepmom.'' Earlier, Robert Towne's ``Without 
Limits,'' about the runner Steve Prefontaine, was a haunting meditation 
on age and youth, defeat and victory, with Donald Sutherland especially 
fine as a thoughtful, seasoned coach. Spike Lee's ode to family ties 
and basketball, ``He Got Game'' was pure, kinetic flash, with an unexpectedly 
gritty Denzel Washington doing his best work as a loser given a second 
chance. ``Gods and Monsters,'' conventionally made but impressive 
in its ambitions, made a one-of-a-kind showcase for McKellen as the 
veteran director of ``Frankenstein'' at the end of his days, while 
Derek Jacobi scarily inhabited another iconoclast, the painter Francis 
Bacon, in ``Love Is the Devil.'' When it came to spinning out of control, 
Ben Stiller's fine, corrosive performance as a druggy Hollywood player 
in ``Permanent Midnight'' took the cake. Steven Soderbergh's ``Out 
of Sight,'' John Frankenheimer's ``Ronin'' and Robert Altman's ``Gingerbread 
Man'' were among the year's most entertaining genre films. Vincent 
Gallo, Gary Oldman and Darren Aronofsky made attention-getting debuts 
with ``Buffalo 66,'' ``Nil by Mouth'' and ``Pi,'' respectively. David 
Mamet's ``Spanish Prisoner'' matched ``The Truman Show'' in witty 
gamesmanship and clever calculation. Among the unreasonably overlooked 
were Jonathan Demme's ``Beloved,'' a richly enveloping film that fell 
victim to a backfiring publicity blitz; ``Velvet Goldmine,'' underscoring 
Todd Haynes' stature as one of the most daring of American filmmakers; 
John Sayles' eloquent and profoundly decent ``Men With Guns,'' and 
``The Real Blonde,'' another acid satire from Tom DiCillo, with his 
``Living in Oblivion'' knives still sharp. Pedro Almodovar's ``Live 
Flesh'' was the brightest and steamiest of foreign films, with ``Post 
Coitum,'' a French film of tortured romance, another hot ticket. Two 
especially fine films from Iran were ``Taste of Cherry,'' a small, 
perfect life-vs.-death parable from Abbas Kiarostami, and ``The Mirror,'' 
a quiet little treasure from the director of ``The White Balloon.'' 
And the Russian drama ``The Thief'' was a reminder of the potboiler 
as universal genre. The genuinely shocking French thriller ``See the 
Sea,'' by Francois Ozon, delivered the year's most Hitchcockian chills, 
``Psycho'' color clone notwithstanding. Among documentaries, ``The 
Farm: Angola U.S.A.'' was the year's most affecting by dint of its 
subject matter, as it observed black prisoners hopelessly enmeshed 
in the prison system. And ``Arguing the World'' offered a lively history 
of New York Jewish intellectuals raised on socialism and debate. But 
there was no business like show business in the documentary arena 
this year, with Barbara Kopple's ``Wild Man Blues,'' about Woody Allen; 
``Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth,'' a vivid biography; and best 
of all, D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus' ``Moon Over Broadway,'' 
a deft behind-the-scenes look at the theater, with the fly-on-the-wall 
acuity Pennebaker once brought to ``Don't Look Back.'' Another documentary 
giant, Frederick Wiseman, made the epic ``Public Housing,'' shown 
at the New York Film Festival but not theatrically released. Beyond 
``Touch of Evil,'' there were two brilliant revivals that outshone 
most of the year's new work. Krzysztof Kieslowski's ``Decalogue,'' 
10 moral tales made for Polish television, remains a little-seen classic 
deserving wider attention. And Fellini's magnificent ``Nights of Cabiria'' 
remains as profound and thrilling an experience as can be had from 
watching a movie screen. These are films that have already reached 
the 4-by-7-inch format, but they are also the ones that fuel our faith 
in cinema's power to endure. If you should mistake either of them 
for ``Armageddon,'' by all means get your money back.
