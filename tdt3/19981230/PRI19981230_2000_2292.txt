For today's geography quiz, we're visiting the largest town in the 
Central American country of Belize. The first settlers here are widely 
believed to have been Mayan Indians. English pirates arrived in the 
1600s. They harvested trees in the rainforest and flooded the logs 
down the Belize River to their ships. The city's had it's share of 
disasters: fires, epidemics and devastating hurricane in 1961. Even 
so, several landmarks are still standing, including the only manually 
operated swing bridge in the world. One final clue now. The city used 
to be the capital of Belize until 1970 when the government moved to 
Belmopan. You've got a few extra minutes for this one. The answer 
is coming up later this half hour.
