The mother of the Houston octuplets went home from the hospital today, 
praising God and her doctors. She said she was amazed when she first 
saw her babies. The smallest died Sunday. The rest are in critical 
condition. Doctors expect them to remain hospitalized for at least 
eight months. She says the pregnancy wasn't easy, but she endured 
it because of her love for the babies.
