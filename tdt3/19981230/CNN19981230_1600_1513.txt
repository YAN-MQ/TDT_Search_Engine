The wonders of technology can help you have a baby without enduring 
labor pains. Jeanne Moos explains. Behind this curtain lurks your 
future. Do you want a boy or a girl, Jeanne? 'tis the season of the 
immaculate conception, and none is more immaculate than this. You 
two are going to have a baby. They call it the Gene machine. See your 
future child today. Bring a partner. Take turns having your photos 
taken. Pick the sex. Pick the race. Out springs your offspring. She's 
cute, huh? Yeah. There is some science involved. The camera takes 
49 specific points on each face and blends them together to get your 
future child. We're not DNA experts, but we're an amusement company. 
And it can be amusing. All my kids come out with goatees. Phil eng 
is technical manager at the video Arcade, xs New York, one of 60 locations 
in north America where the Gene machine can be found. When Phil and 
I mated, photographically-speaking, our child did exhibit an ever-so-slight 
goatee. This girl grabbed a stranger. But if you don't pose properly 
-- come on, let's see. Oh, my goodness. What is wrong with her eyes? 
At least there's no custody battle. Who's going to get to keep the 
picture? She can. And you're never too old to make a baby this way. 
This guy and his wife already have kids. So how did the Gene machine 
do compared to the real thing? Oh my gosh, that kid is ugly. Hey, 
it does look like Rebecca, though. Her eyes -- I don't know what happened 
to her eyes. Another husband and wife with three kids opted for a 
boy, but their son, Andrew, saw no resemblance. We'll stop with three 
if that's what the fourth will look like. Each photo is labeled "for 
amusement only" to protect against frivolous lawsuits, surmised this 
lawyer. Take it as a guarantee this will be my child, and then sue 
them if they get an ugly kid. The makers of photomorphosis tell the 
time that someone dropped his drawers and mooned the Gene machine. 
And then the camera's trying to recognize eyes, nose, mouth. Finding 
a face while being mooned is harder than trying to find the face of 
the man in the Moon. For five bucks a pop, anyone can have a Gene 
machine baby, two girls, two guys. We got a choice. You want a boy 
or girl? What do you want to have, darling? They decided on a girl. 
I'm so proud of you. And even if you're turned off by your offspring 
-- Still a kid. Still our kid. Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
