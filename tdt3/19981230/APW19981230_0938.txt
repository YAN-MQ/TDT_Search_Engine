Police who smelled a rat when they saw two men fishing with no reels 
or line found more than a ton of hashish hidden nearby. The two fake 
anglers were arrested Tuesday on a cliff overlooking the Mediterranean 
near the town of Lagos in southern Malaga province, the state news 
agency Efe reported. The men, who had fishing rods with no reels or 
line, were apparently guarding a drug shipment hidden at the foot 
of the cliff. Police found 37 bails containing a total of 1,200 kilos 
(2,640 pounds) of hashish. Firemen used ropes and pulleys to retrieve 
the drugs.
