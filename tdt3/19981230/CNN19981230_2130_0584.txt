1999 is right around the corner, but it may take longer to get here 
than you think -- one second longer, that is. Anne Kellan explains 
in this edition of "tech trends." On December 31st, just before the 
clock strikes midnight in Greenwich, England -- that's 7:00 P.M. eastern 
standard time -- the world gets an extra second, a leap second of 
time. Astronomers say it's needed to keep the world's clocks in sync 
with the earth's rotation. And we now know that the rotation of the 
earth is slowing down very slightly. And that's why we have a leap 
second. The tide causes the earth's rotation to slow down. About every 
year or year and a half, we do need to add a leap second to take into 
account the slowing down of the rotation of the earth and to synchronize 
atomic time with astronomical time. Astronomicaclocks keep time according 
to the earth's rotation, while atomic clocks are more precise and 
keep time by the unchanging vibrations or oscillations of a radioactive 
atom. U.S. naval observatory master clock. The amic clock, the world's 
official timekeeper, has had 22 leap-second adjustments since 1972. 
Without tjem, those lost seconds would add up. Imagine thousands of 
years from now, sunrise occurring at noon, or sunset at midnight. 
The U.S. naval observatory in Washington, D.C., is in charge of making 
sure that extra second is programmed into computers onboard global 
positioning satellites that send out the correct time to people on 
earth. If seconds matter a lot to you, this $200 watch by sharper 
image has a tiny receiver in it that picks up signals from the atomic 
clock. What can you do to get in sync with earth's "real time"? On 
new year's eve, when your glass is in the air and the countdown is 
under way, "wait a second!" Ann Kellan, CNN, Atlanta.@
