I'm Charlene Porter, along with Paul Westpheling. We're bringing you 
this hour of VOA News Now. Have you talked about your child's health 
today? My baby eats well, but how do I know if she's getting the proper 
nutrition? The growth of your child is a good way to tell if she's 
getting all the nutrients she needs. What's the best way to measure 
my baby's growth? By getting your baby's weight checked regularly. 
A health worker can then compare your baby's weight to the ideal weight 
of children the same age and height. So if there's a problem, it can 
be detected early? That's right. Give your baby a healthy start. Find 
out from a health worker about the best foods to feed growing children. 
Your child's health is your family's future. It is 10 hours 18 universal 
time, and the top story of the hour: United States and Britain say 
the two no-fly zones in Iraq will be strictly enforced in spite of 
Baghdad's threat to fire at the patrolling allied planes. We'll have 
more on that story and the rest of the hour's top news in our next 
summary about 12 minutes from now. What we've got now for you is a 
look at sports, and here he is, Jim Stevenson.
