China is cracking down on foreign-based dissidents who sneak back 
into the country. A Hong Kong based human rights group says long exiled 
Chinese dissident Wong See, who slipped back into China through Macao 
will stand trial for endangering state security. The arrest of Mr. 
Wong follows the sentencing without trial on Tuesday of two U.S.-based 
dissidents to three years in a labor camp after the snuck into the 
southern Chinese city of Huang Chow.
