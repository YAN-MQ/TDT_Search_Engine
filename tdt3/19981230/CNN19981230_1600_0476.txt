This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast." Beginning this evening and going on out into tomorrow evening 
-- which, of course, is new year's eve. We'll see some snow showers 
lingering across New England and the Great Lakes as very cold high 
pressure continues to sink into the southeastern part of the country. 
Meanwhile, another storm is developing in the northwest. That will 
produce some pretty interesting weather in the next couple of days 
from the Rockies into the plains and then eastward. High temperatures 
today. Subzero and single numbers over the upper midwest. Pretty cool 
in the southeast as well, where winds will make it feel very cold 
because of the wind chills. A couple of 70s in south Florida. We will 
see 70s in the southwest as well, where it has been above normal in 
some places. Looking ahead to Friday, snow and rain develop through 
the plains states, with some snow showers over northern New England. 
On Saturday, heavy snow will develop in the central plains and middle 
mississippi river valley with rain in the southeast. And for Sunday, 
rain and snow in the east, rain showers in the northwest, and still 
pretty cold. Don't forget, four-day forecasts at CNN.com.
