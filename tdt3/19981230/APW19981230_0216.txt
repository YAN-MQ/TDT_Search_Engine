A top Malaysian activist on Wednesday reiterated his call for the 
removal of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad _ but said Malaysia needs 
even broader reforms to avoid sliding deeper into a political and 
economic morass. Tian Chua, who recently got out of jail after his 
latest arrest without charge, also called the sex-and-corruption case 
against sacked deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim a ``comedy'' that 
is amusing the populace at a time when Malaysians should be focusing 
on broader issues. Tian said the only way out of Malaysia's mess is 
a radical shakeup of what he characterized as a corruption-ridden 
political and legal system. ``We must have a steady and constant change 
of new blood that can guarantee transparency and accountability in 
government,'' said Tian, chairman of Malaysia's opposition Coalition 
of People's Democracy. Tian, 36, who was freed on bail Dec. 5, met 
Wednesday afternoon with journalists in Hong Kong to discuss the human 
rights situation in Malaysia. Relaxed and soft-spoken, Tian said his 
interrogations by Malaysian authorities were harsh, but he said he 
was only slightly beaten, compared to some prisoners who were more 
severely abused. He added that political detainees were placed in 
overcrowded cells without access to clean water. ``We were jailed 
with drug addicts and common criminals,'' Tian said. Tian's coalition, 
composed of 20 human rights and opposition political groups, has demanded 
reform and protested against Mahathir's 17-year rule. Tian said Mahathir 
may call snap elections within six months, but Tian did not name an 
alternative political candidate that the opposition would back. Tian 
cautioned that Mahathir's removal alone would not ensure a viable 
leadership. The immediate concern of the reform movement _ or ``reformasi'' 
as it is called _ was the abolition of laws that restrict political 
freedoms. ``We must look into the constitution itself so that civil 
and human rights may be better integrated,'' Tian said. Tian said 
the ongoing Anwar trial was a sham that the Malaysian people found 
``extremely amusing.'' ``The government is determined to sentence 
Anwar regardless of what the independent courts say,'' Tian said. 
Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 after deeming him morally unfit to 
lead the country. Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20 and badly beaten 
while in police custody. Anwar now is on trial for abuse of power 
and will be tried separately on charges of engaging in illegal sex 
acts, including sodomy. Prosecutors are trying to prove Anwar had 
sex with the wife of his former secretary, sodomized his family driver 
and abused his powers to cover up the affairs. Tian called for an 
independent judiciary that did not condone intimidation of lawyers, 
a fair and honest electoral system, and an investigation into the 
business practices of Malaysia's politicians. Because Asia's financial 
crisis shows little sign of abating, Tian called for loosening the 
ties between the political and financial communities to better position 
Malaysia for recovery. ``Economic affairs must be as transparent as 
possible,'' Tian said. Tian also said the recently concluded summit 
of the 11-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations did little 
to further a reassessment of the organization's founding policy of 
non-interference in each others' internal affairs. ``Human rights 
and civil liberties transcend national borders,'' Tian said.
