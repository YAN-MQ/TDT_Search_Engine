Italy's top environment and culture officials said `no' Wednesday 
to a proposal to build giant flood gates between Venice and the Adriatic, 
upholding the ruling of a government-appointed environmental panel. 
The project could be revived only if _ and only after _ authorities 
tried a series of other measures to restore Venice's lagoon, Environment 
Minister Edo Ronchi said in a joint decree with Culture Minister Giovanna 
Melandri. The project would have placed 30-meter-high (98 feet) barriers 
on the seabed at three entrances to the lagoon. When flooding threatened, 
the barriers would jut up 2 meters (6 feet) to block the waves. Backers 
said the gates were the only sure way to save Venice from increasing 
flooding, which threatens the city's treasures and its tourism. High 
water hit St. Mark's Square and other low-lying areas a record 101 
times in 1996. Opponents _ including the government-appointed panel 
that said no on Dec. 10 _ said the gates risked making the lagoon 
a turgid pool, cut off from the sea. They urged standby measures such 
as raising foundations and pavements. Italy had spent dlrs 150 million 
and years of planning on the project, making killing it a painful 
decision. ``A typical Italian `no.' No one ever has the courage to 
say `no,'' said Giancarlo Galan, president of the regional council 
of Veneto, which includes Venice. ``In short, it's a decision not 
to save Venice, at least not for now _ that is to say not for the 
next five, 10 or 32 years, or for the next five, 10 or 200 scientific 
studies.'' Venice Mayor Massimo Cacciari urged every level of government 
to get to work now on projects to safeguard both Venice and its lagoon. 
With Wednesday's decree, Cacciari said, ``comes an obligation of the 
government to make up for lost time.''
