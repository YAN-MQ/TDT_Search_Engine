The sign that no theatergoer wishes to see was up the day of the performance: 
The star of the show _ in this case Martin Short in ``Little Me'' 
_ was out sick. At 4 p.m. on the Monday before Christmas there already 
were a dozen ticket-holders at the box office, demanding their money 
back, indifferent to the talent of the fellow who was taking over 
the starring role. ``Oh, boy, I sure wouldn't want to be that guy,'' 
an actor, Michael McGrath, said as he walked by. This was an extreme 
inside joke. He was that guy. Moreover, ``Little Me,'' a farce originally 
written for Sid Caesar in the early '60s, demands that the star sing, 
dance and do 36 costume changes for seven parts, including a French 
crooner, a show biz agent, and a prince from a country so small ``it 
had been defeated in war by Luxembourg.'' Would McGrath _ who, in 
addition to being Short's understudy, has five roles in the show _ 
share his feelings about taking on the starring role on 24-hour notice? 
``Shock,'' McGrath, 41, says after posing outside the Roundabout Theater 
on Broadway, where as usual, nobody recognizes him. Elaborate, please. 
``I knew Marty was having trouble vocally,'' says McGrath (pronounced 
McGraw), ``but I'd understudied for him before, in `The Goodbye Girl,' 
and I had never gone on. The man's got cords of steel; he never missed 
a show. They told me I was going on after the Sunday matinee. I went 
home, ran lines with my wife until 10:30, then I went to bed. I didn't 
sleep very well. The most fearful thing is I'm going on for Martin 
Short. I'm not naive, I know people won't be coming to see me. ``Then, 
when I stepped out on the stage, I got entrance applause and I thought, 
`OK The people who are here want to be here.' After a while it felt 
like I could do no wrong, that the people were on my side. They were 
seeing live theater, something that doesn't happen all the time.'' 
There is a theater story we never tire of: the understudy who, with 
little notice, takes over for the star and brings down the house. 
McGrath, who lives in Weehawken, N.J., with his wife, Toni DiBuono, 
an actress, and their daughter, Kathleen, 3, went on for the star, 
who was ill with a cold, three times last week. Thinking of McGrath 
as an overnight sensation would not be correct. Outside his theater, 
there was no sensation. McGrath has made a living as an actor for 
20 years. He's starred in the Groucho Marx role in a revival of ``The 
Cocoanuts'' two years ago, and has been featured in a number of other 
shows. ``I'm called a quirky leading man,'' McGrath says, ``quirky'' 
being the show business euphemism for a person who does not have classic 
good looks and is known to cut up. (He has also been called ``puckish,'' 
which is show biz for short.) Except for ``The Cocoanuts,'' McGrath 
has not had a starring role to call his own in a major New York show. 
When he did, he did not keep it long, moving on to a supporting role 
in another musical, ``Once Upon a Mattress,'' where he stayed for 
only three weeks. ``I made a big mistake,'' McGrath says, ``but I 
learned my lesson: Never do something for money. We had a new child; 
I was making less than $1,000 a week on `The Cocoanuts.' Going to 
the new show, I was making nearly three times that. It just didn't 
work out.'' What did McGrath earn going on for the star in ``Little 
Me?'' ``Nothing,'' McGrath says, without rancor. This is the thing 
that McGrath believes made him an actor: the pleasure of showing off, 
from the time he was a boy. He grew up in Worcester, Mass., the youngest 
of five children. His father was a car salesman who always sang around 
the house; his mother was a baker. McGraw put in three months at the 
Boston Conservatory of Music before quitting and got his first job, 
in summer stock, within the year. An interesting thing happened when 
McGrath went on for Short. Fueled by the terror or excitement of a 
leading man who had never had a full rehearsal, the cast was energized. 
McGrath seized his seven roles with manic glee. When lines were blown, 
the cast improvised, sometimes breaking into unscripted, laughter 
themselves. After the show, McGrath found a bottle of Dom Perignon, 
from Martin Short, in his dressing room. Then McGrath and his wife 
went to Cafe Un Deux Trois for what was to have been their fifth anniversary 
dinner, and it became a double celebration. ``Little Me'' is to close 
at the end of January. In March, McGrath is scheduled to do another 
off-Broadway show, ``Exactly Like You,'' a Cy Coleman musical. But 
he'll always have that Monday curtain call, in which the audience 
_ including this reporter, who had planned on seeing Martin Short 
_ gave McGrath the special ovation for people who leap into impossible 
situations full throttle and soar. They rose to their feet, screaming, 
``Bravo! Bravo!''
