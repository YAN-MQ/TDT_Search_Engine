The grand jury investigating the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing has found 
no additional conspirators. It says it cannot determine if a third 
person was involved in the blast, along with Timothy McVeigh and Terry 
Nichols. 168 people were killed in the explosion. The grand jury also 
found no evidence that the federal government knew about the attack 
in advance. With the time at four minutes past the hour, I'm Derrick 
Stoffel. You're listening to "The World."
