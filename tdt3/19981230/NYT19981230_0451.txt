The last time the Cardinals won a playoff game, Harry Truman was president. 
On Saturday, Jake Plummer will lead a handful of overdue veterans 
and a nameless supporting cast into Irving, Texas, for a playoff game 
against the Dallas Cowboys, who, quite simply, own them _ twice this 
season, 16 of the last 17 times overall and every game at Texas Stadium 
in the 1990s. ``We know what it's like to lose there,'' said Lomas 
Brown, a seven-time Pro Bowl offensive tackle. ``We don't know what 
it's like to win there.'' When it comes to the post-season, the Cardinals 
don't know what it's like to win anywhere. The Chicago Cardinals won 
the National Football League title game against the Philadelphia Eagles 
in 1947. But the franchise has played four post-season games since 
then and lost them all. Since relocating from St. Louis in 1988, the 
Cardinals have suffered 10 consecutive losing seasons. Even when Chris 
Jacke kicked a 52-yard field goal as time expired to defeat the San 
Diego Chargers, 16-13, last Sunday and vault the Cardinals into the 
playoffs for the first time since 1982, the sellout crowd at Sun Devil 
Stadium couldn't get it right, failing to tear down the goal post. 
Long-suffering fans don't have big-game experience. What about the 
players who haven't beaten a team with a winning record this season? 
``You have to experience the pressure yourself, there's no osmosis 
in the NFL,'' said Coach Vince Tobin, whose club finished 9-7, its 
first winning record since 1984, after a disastrous 4-12 mark in 1997. 
``We've played pressure games. I don't think it's that big a leap 
to the pressure of the playoffs.'' Jacke, who was out of football 
when he got a call in November, kicked three consecutive game-winning 
field goals on the last play. After Wednesday's practice, the Cardinals' 
veterans were making the task of beating the Cowboys (10-6) sound 
daunting, even if Deion Sanders doesn't play because of a toe injury. 
``I always envisioned what this was going to be like,'' said five-time 
Pro Bowl defensive back Aeneas Williams, who has spent his eight-year 
career in Arizona. ``I badly wanted to be here when we did it. Now 
that we've made it, I don't know if I'm confident about winning, but 
I sense an air from this team that we believe we have the ability 
to win. There's more substance to believe that now.'' A string of 
miraculous finishes does wonders for the psyche. The Cardinals, who 
lost six games last season in the final minute, have reversed the 
script this year with the elusive Plummer getting much of the credit 
for seven victories of 3 points or less. ``We've been in situations 
too many times where we've had to come back,'' said Plummer, who without 
shoulder pads has a place-kicker's build. ``Actually, I'd like for 
that to change,'' added Plummer, who was already a local hero at Arizona 
State, where he led the Sun Devils to victory in the 1997 Rose Bowl. 
``I'd like to be ahead instead of behind. But this year nobody expected 
us to get this far.'' Last week, Plummer was rewarded with a four-year, 
$29.7 million contract extension that puts him just behind Steve Young 
as the second highest-paid football player. He ranked only 10th in 
the National Football Conference _ 17 touchdowns, 20 interceptions 
_ but the Cardinals aren't complaining. Plummer's improvisational 
skills seem best suited for the frantic, no-huddle, two-minute-drill 
situations dictated by final drives with the game on the line. ``I 
like his competitiveness, the way he directs the team, his athleticism,'' 
said Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman, who is 11-2 in the post-season. 
``You look at that team's season, the way they pull out close games, 
and it's apparent that football team won't quit. Teams with lesser 
character would quit and they didn't.'' This team was constructed 
by the vice president of player personnel Bob Ferguson. In addition 
to drafting Plummer last year, he traded down one slot last March 
so San Diego could take Ryan Leaf and Arizona could get a king's ransom 
from San Diego: two first-round picks, a second-rounder, the wide 
receiver Eric Metcalf (whose kickoff return set up Sunday's victory) 
and linebacker Patrick Sapp. ``We proved to people we are not the 
dumbest kid on the block; we just didn't fall off the turnip truck,'' 
Ferguson said. Adrian Murrell, the former Jet, was acquired in the 
off season, and led the team in rushing with 1,042 yards and eight 
touchdowns. Another former Jet, wideout Rob Moore, caught 67 passes 
for 559 yards and two touchdowns. ``I see some similarities with this 
team and when Green Bay just started to get good,'' said Jacke, who 
went to the Super Bowl with the Packers and joined the Cardinals after 
Joe Nedney blew out his knee. On Saturday they will try to do something 
they haven't done in 51 years: win a playoff game. They're a confident 
bunch. They know they'll be facing Troy Aikman and not Craig Whelihan. 
``I don't mind if this game goes down to the last few minutes, because 
that's when Jake comes to the fore and takes charge,'' Tobin said. 
Just as Plummer has done the last three weeks.
