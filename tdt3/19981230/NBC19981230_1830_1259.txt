We heard for the first time today about the experience of having octuplets. 
Seven of the babe yiz survived. Doctors say they are doing well, in 
fact. Today in Texas, their mother told her story. NBC's Dan Lothian 
is has the story. Looking like anything but a mother who just delivered 
octuplets, 27-year-old nkem chukwu was beaming as she talked about 
the surprise family she and her husband always wanted. I wanted to 
have as many as God wants to give me. Did you want to have them all 
at once? Yeah, it doesn't matter. In the darkest hours of pregnancy, 
bedridden, and by doctors orders nearly upside down to relieve pressure, 
chukwu says she prayed. I knew it was coming to an end, that it won't 
be long and I'll see my children. And I'll be able to cuddle and love 
them. The Nigerian immigrants, both American citizens, say their faith 
worked. When I saw them for the first time, I was so amazed. I mean, 
what God blessed me with. Eight in all were delivered earlier this 
month at this Houston hospital. On Sunday, the most frail infant, 
a girl, died. Doctors say the prognosis is good for the remaining 
infants -- more than a 92% chance of survival. They have no brain 
damage and are in critical but stable condition. Four are breathing 
on their own. But all must gain at least four times their current 
weight before they can go home. That could happen in two to three 
months. We're feeling better and better about the babies as each day 
goes on. And right now, I think we're go going to discharge seven 
good babies. In the couples community outside downtown Houston, no 
special homecoming planned. But neighbors are ready to help. Everybody 
will be pretty supportive of those people because I'm sure they're 
going to need all the help they can get. We bring the blood of Jesus 
-- And from their Nigerian pastors who were following tradition today, 
blessing the couples house, and promises of help from their congregations. 
As from now, you'll see people coming to visit them, bringing them 
all kinds of gifts, financial things and other things. And it's also 
a tradition from Africa. As she left the hospital for the first time 
in almost three months, chukwu had no misgivings about going through 
such a risky pregnancy. They're part of me. I'm not complete without 
them. All the infants, she says, even the girl who died, are a gift 
from God. Dan Lothian, NBC news, Houston.
