Most states apparently have met the first welfare to work goal under 
the 1996 federal law. The Clinton administration says 36 states and 
the district of Columbia meet the requirement of getti 25% of participating 
families to work. One state is still compiling data, and the others 
were not required to meet the goal at this time. The department of 
health and human services also says new census bureau figures show 
1.5 million parents who received welfare in 1997 were working in March 
of this year.
