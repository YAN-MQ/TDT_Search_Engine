The hostage drama in southern Yemen is over, but not without casualties. 
Four hostages were killed in gunfire after yemeni troops stormed the 
hideout where Islamic extremists were holding 16 western tourists. 
The tourists were kidnapped yesterday, when gunmen stormed their bus 
in southern Yemen. Britain's foreign secretary has confirmed that 
three of the victims were british nationals. The other victim is believed 
to be Australian. Yemeni officials say at least three kidnappers were 
killed in the raid.
