January 12000 is approaching. We are starting a 10-part series called 
"Y2K, will the bug bite? Kate snow starts with this report. Sometimes 
it's hard to tell who is in charge, people or computers. Computers 
bring electricity to our home and delivering life-saving medicine. 
They contain some of the most mundane systems on earth and some of 
the most deadly ones, too. We've become dependent on computers in 
a short period of time. We don't realize how dependent we are. We 
are about to realize that if we have malfunctions. All this trouble 
because of one little glitch? The combination of these advances brought 
about a second generation of computers in 1960. The Y2K bug was born 
in the '60s. '74 meent 1974. In the days when computer memory was 
expensive, that made sense. It doesn't make sense anymore. Many computers 
will confuse the year 2000 with the year 1900. Some could make mistakes 
and produce useless data. Others might simply crash. We don't know 
exactly what's going to happen. When you have tens of thousands of 
problems, you can being guaranteed that a vast majority will be trivial 
and that a handful will be severe. What's the chance your telephone 
won't work? Will it be safe to fly? Over the next several days, we'll 
help you separate the reality of the problem from the myths. I didn't 
done one thing about it. We live with technology every day. You'll 
hear from the experts who agree the bug is serious, but not the end 
of the world. Even the worst case scenarios what are now shavepg up 
in the United States, based on what we know, are not the end of civilization. 
Most important, we'll show you how to be prepared and not overreact. 
Some charge of your own preparedness. Don't panicic. Don't let somebody 
on a web site tell you what to do. With so many computers with our 
lives, you don't want the year 2000 to creep up on you. Kate snow, 
"Headline News."
