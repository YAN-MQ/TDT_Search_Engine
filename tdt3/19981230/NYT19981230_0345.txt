President Clinton just cannot seem to get himself censured. Predictions 
after the midterm elections that Clinton would escape impeachment 
with censure by the House foundered on his refusal to say that he 
lied under oath, along with steely legislative management by Republican 
leaders. A similar dynamic could take hold in the Senate. Clinton 
has told his aides he will not concede that he lied, even though some 
senators are urging that he do so to pave the way for censure. What 
is not yet clear is whether enough senators _ 51 or 60, depending 
on how censure is presented _ would be satisfied with such a rebuke, 
without Clinton's acknowledgment of wrongdoing. Already the possibility 
of a pre-emptive censure has faded, since Majority Leader Trent Lott 
has said he will insist on at least opening the proceedings. As the 
House Judiciary Committee demonstrated, such proceedings can have 
a certain inexorability. White House aides have told Democratic senators 
that Clinton hopes to be censured immediately after a Senate trial 
opens, because he is anxious to see the accusations against him resolved 
by Jan 19. On that day, he is to deliver his annual State of the Union 
Message to a joint session of Congress, and he would prefer that his 
audience not be mulling his removal from office. Accompanied by his 
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, his daughter, Chelsea, and his dog, 
Buddy, Clinton arrived in Hilton Head on Wednesday for his annual 
New Year's retreat to the spirit-and-status-boosting conference called 
Renaissance Weekend. While they say they have not yet seen any proposed 
censure language, White House advisers insist a deal could nevertheless 
be struck quickly. ``There's no Tom DeLay in the Senate,'' said one 
senior White House aide, referring to the House whip who corralled 
votes for Clinton's impeachment. Republicans in the Senate are less 
likely to act as a bloc, this adviser argued, adding that Senate Democrats, 
by contrast, are cohering. But even some moderate Republicans have 
their doubts about a swift censure. ``The colleagues with whom I've 
talked have as many different versions of censure and resolutions 
as there are senators,'' said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine in an interview 
Wednesday. ``Some people are talking about the need for the president 
to make an admission. Some are talking about a fine of some sort. 
Others are talking about the need to insure that the president could 
be subject to criminal penalties after his term is over.'' In weighing 
the possibilities for censure, the White House confronts a confounding 
array of variables, including what procedure the Senate will adopt. 
Lott is considering whether to hold a vote to open the trial after 
first hearing a presentation of the evidence from the House. If that 
vote failed, Clinton's hand in negotiating a mild censure would be 
immeasurably strengthened. The White House must also politely round 
up enough independent-minded senators, who are scattering over the 
question of censure. In the House, Republicans and Democrats may seem 
obstreperous but dutifully follow their leaders. By contrast, the 
Senate is genteelly fractious; Democrats are differing over whether 
Clinton should insist on a trial, and even some conservative Republicans 
say it would be silly to make him concede he lied. For her part, Sen. 
Collins said that she would make no decisions before hearing the evidence, 
but that an admission by Clinton of perjury would ``help move the 
process along.'' ``If you are entering into the equivalent of a plea 
bargain, which is what you are talking about with censure, there is 
an admission and an acceptance of responsibility,'' she said. But 
Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., a conservative, said of seeking such an 
admission: ``It is trying to get some pound of flesh out of the president 
here, to what end?'' Impeachment, he said in an interview, was already 
a blacker mark than any censure. Like Santorum _ though for very different 
reasons _ Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a liberal, argues that Clinton 
should go to trial rather than be censured. ``I believe that more 
and more of my colleagues are seeing the wisdom of having a trial,'' 
he said in a telephone interview. ``I think the Republican Party is 
reeling from this.'' He said that, with impeachment now hanging over 
his head, Clinton deserved a ``definitive vote.'' Republicans appear 
to agree that a trial should begin, but in interviews they offered 
a range of views on censure. ``We owe it to the House to start on 
the trial,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., a moderate. ``It would 
be an insult to the House to say, ``Well, let's just have a vote on 
dismissing the whole thing.'' He added, ``That doesn't mean that at 
some stage later on there wouldn't be a pause to consider another 
approach.'' He said he had no view on what form censure should take. 
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who has been critical of Lott on occasion, 
said that he was inclined against censure even after a trial began, 
calling it dangerous. ``When you read the Federalist papers, impeachment 
was never intended to be a punishment,'' he said. ``It was never intended 
to force people to admit to something or extract a fine.'' Under one 
scenario, a relatively small group could block any consideration of 
censure. If a censure proposal were offered like any piece of Senate 
legislation, it would be subject to filibuster, meaning that it would 
require at least 60 senators to pass. To circumvent that obstacle, 
senators might attach a censure resolution to a motion to dismiss 
the accusations against Clinton. Such a motion would require only 
a simple majority. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said that Senate 
Democrats would take that approach. ``The only question,'' he said, 
``is when the 51 votes are cast to adjourn with censure.''
