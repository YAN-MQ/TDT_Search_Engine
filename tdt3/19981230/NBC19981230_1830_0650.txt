Another matter requiring the attention of the traveling White House 
-- there has been another skirmish in the skies over Iraq. From the 
Pentagon tonight, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on this latest exchange of 
fire. jim? Brian, for the second time in three days, Iraq has fired 
on allied warplanes. Again, no planes were hit. Once again, U.S. forces 
rurp the fire with a vengeance. This time, Iraq targeted British as 
well as U.S. combat planes, firing six to eight anti-aircraft missiles 
at British tornadoes and U.S. F-16s as the warplanes patrolled the 
southern no fly zone northwest of talil. The missiles missed their 
Mark. And within an hour, American F-16s struck back. Gun camera video 
released tonight at the Pentagon shows laser-guided bombs striking 
three separate targets at the Iraqi missile site. The U.S. military 
claims it had no choice but to shoot back. It was certainly an unprovoked 
attack today. Our forces in the region flying operations and watched 
the missions took appropriate actions. Although allied warplanes easily 
evade add tack, the skies over iraq are becoming more dangerous. U.S. 
sources tell NBC news the Iraqi military is moving adecisional missile 
batteries to both the northern and southern no-fly zones. Even more 
disturbing, the U.S. military lost track of at least 20 Iraqi mobile 
missile batteries over the past couple of days, making it impossible 
to determine where or when Iraq may attempt to strike next.szewski
