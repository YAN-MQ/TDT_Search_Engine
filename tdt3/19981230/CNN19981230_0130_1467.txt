Residents of St. Joseph's home for the blind in New Jersey will have 
a new year's dinner fit for a king -- king neptune, that is. And they 
owe it to a cache of ill-gotten lobsters and shrimp. Police arrested 
two New York men for using stolen credit card numbers to buy $3,000 
worth of seafood. And since the lobsters would have spoiled before 
they could be shipped back to Maine, authorities decided they might 
as well not go to waste.
