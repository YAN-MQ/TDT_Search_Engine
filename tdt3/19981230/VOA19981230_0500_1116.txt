The U.S. college football post season continued Tuesday with action 
at the first ever Music City Bowl in Nashville, Tennessee, where Virginia 
Tech completed an impressive 38 to 7 victory over Alabama. The 24th 
ranked Hokies who had never beaten Alabama in ten previous tries displayed 
an overwhelming defense that intercepted three passes, blocked two 
punts, and recovered a muff punt. Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer 
was happy to have beaten an Alabama team rich in post season history. 
We beat really a team that we have some respect for, their tradition, 
what they're all about. I thought his played great, got some good 
turnovers in the game. That helped us. This feels absolutely great. 
The victory ended a two-game losing streak in bowls for Virginia Tech, 
one of only ten teams to go to a bowl game in each of the last six 
years. Alabama meanwhile had its five-game post season winning streak 
snapped in its worst bowl defeat since 1972. In the Micron P.C. Bowl, 
the University of Miami Hurricanes defeated the North Carolina State 
Wolf Pack 46 to 23. The victory pushes Miami's post season record 
to a perfect 12 and 0. The college football post season ends next 
Monday night when Florida State takes on Tennessee for the National 
Championship in the Fiesta Bowl.
