Three British subjects and one Australian have been killed in Yemen 
following a hostage rescue operation to free 16 tourists held by Islamic 
militants. Yemen's interior ministry says the kidnappers killed three 
of the captives during the rescue. Their fourth victim died later 
in a hospital. At least two of the tourists, including a U.S. citizen, 
were injured in the operation. Three of the 18 kidnappers were also 
killed in the shoot-out which occurred in a mountainous area northeast 
of the city of Addan. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman 
Lee McLellan responded to the government action. The Yemeni government 
has said to us that when they were able to find the hostage takers 
and the hostages, the kidnappers began to execute members of the hostage 
group and as a consequence, the Yemeni officials felt they had to 
intercede immediately. So they went in and affected a largely successful 
rescue mission. That is State Department spokesman Lee McLellan. The 
Yemeni Interior Ministry says troops launched the rescue operation 
after the kidnappers began killing the hostages. British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair says the incident has caused him shock and horror. The 
kidnappers who call themselves Islamic Jihad sees the hostages on 
Monday near the southern town of Badiwa south of the Yemeni capital, 
Sana'a. The captors are not affiliated with Islamic Jihad groups in 
the Palestinian territories or Egypt.
