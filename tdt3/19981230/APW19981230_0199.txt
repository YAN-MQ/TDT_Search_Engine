Pakistani authorities allowed former prime minister Benazir Bhutto 
to board a Dubai-bound flight on Wednesday, days after they barred 
her from leaving the country, an official from her party said. Bhutto 
left for Dubai on Wednesday, said Munawar Suharwardi, a spokesman 
of Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples' Party. On Monday, authorities prevented 
Bhutto from going to Dubai, saying she may not leave because of corruption 
cases against her. Lahore High Court on Tuesday gave permission for 
her to leave. ``It is a victory of justice,'' Bhutto told reporters 
at the airport. Bhutto, the twice elected prime minister and the opposition 
leader, has gone to Dubai to celebrate New Year with her three children 
who are studying there. Former president Farooq Leghari sacked Bhutto's 
government in 1996 under allegations of corruption and misrule. Bhutto 
and her jailed husband Asif Ali Zardari face a number of corruption 
cases. Bhutto has denied the charges and accuses Sharif of graft and 
of victimizing the opposition. There was no immediate comment from 
the government.
