Yemen faced a barrage of criticism Wednesday after its troops stormed 
the hideout of Islamic extremist kidnappers holding 16 Western hostages. 
Four of the hostages were killed. Two other hostages were wounded 
during the siege Tuesday near the southern town of Mawdiyah, about 
175 miles (280 kilometers) south of the capital, San`a. The remaining 
10 hostages were freed unharmed. One of the wounded, Claire Marston 
of Britain, was ``in a very bad way,'' British diplomat David Pearce 
told reporters at Al-Jamhouriya Hospital in the southern port of Aden. 
Marston was awake after surgery on her shoulder _ where she was shot 
_ and knew her husband, Canadian-born Peter Rowe, had been killed, 
Pearce said. The two women were ``as well as can be expected,'' he 
added. The other woman, an unidentified American, was shot in the 
pelvis, hospital officials said on condition of anonymity. Security 
forces killed three of the kidnappers and captured another three, 
including the leader, the Interior Ministry said. Yemen blamed the 
kidnappers for the deaths of the three Britons and an Australian, 
one of whom died later in in a hospital. Brig. Mohammad Saleh al-Turaiq, 
the chief of security in Aden province, said Wednesday that the kidnappers 
were the first to open fire. ``The Egyptian (kidnapper) began shooting 
at the hostages, which forced our troops to storm the hideout,'' he 
told reporters in the presence of the British ambassador. Al-Turaiq 
said his forces were chasing some kidnappers who got away. He accused 
foreign elements of instigating the kidnapping, but refused to elaborate. 
Yemeni officials have identified the Egyptian as Osama al-Masri. In 
Cairo, Egyptian security sources said the name was the alias of a 
wanted Islamic extremist. They refused to give his real name. The 
officials said the kidnappers belonged to Islamic Jihad, a group of 
about 200 members based in a camp in south Yemen. They had seized 
the hostages _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians _ to 
demand the release of two of their leaders and in protest against 
the recent U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq, officials said. 
Police had detained the leaders in a crackdown on Islamic vigilantes. 
Kidnappings of foreigners occur often in Yemen, large parts of which 
are run by lawless tribes, but until now the hostages usually have 
been treated well and released unharmed. This was the first time Islamic 
extremists had abducted foreigners. British newspapers accused the 
Yemeni authorities of premature intervention. The Daily Mail asked 
on the front page, ``Did our tourists really need to die?'' British 
Ambassador Vic Henderson reportedly had pleaded with the San`a government 
to do nothing ``that in any way could jeopardize the safety of the 
hostages.'' In San`a, Yemenis told journalists they were surprised 
the government had intervened so quickly when it usually negotiated 
for several days, if not weeks, with kidnappers. A London-based Islamic 
human rights group said Tuesday that it had contacted the kidnappers 
on Monday and received assurances that they would not harm the hostages. 
``We hold the Yemeni government responsible for the deaths. The way 
the authorities handled the situation was barbaric and irresponsible,'' 
said a spokesman for the Islamic Observation Center. In the wake of 
the killings, Germany appealed to the San`a government not to attempt 
to rescue the four Germans held hostage by a tribe in northeast Yemen, 
Yemeni officials said Wednesday. In London, the Foreign Office confirmed 
that three Britons _ Ruth Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Rowe 
_ were killed, but did not provide their ages or hometowns. The Australian 
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the fourth victim was 
a 35-year-old man from Sydney whose name would not be released until 
next of kin had been informed. The surviving hostages were recovering 
from their ordeal at an Aden hotel, diplomat Pearce said Tuesday. 
``They are obviously in a state of severe shock, and I mean severe 
shock,'' Pearce said. Pearce said Wednesday it was hoped that the 
11 Britons could be flown home on Friday. The kidnapping began Monday 
when the tourists' convoy of five vehicles was ambushed by men who 
opened fire on their police escorts near Mawdiyah, Yemeni security 
officials said. Yemen said the governor of Abyan province, Ahmad Ali 
Mohsen, was negotiating with leaders of the Al-Fadl tribe, to which 
the kidnappers belong, before the shootout occurred. Tribesmen usually 
kidnap foreigners to press the government to provide new roads, water 
or clinics.
