Eritrea has demanded an investigation into the deaths of two of its 
nationals held for months in detention camps in Ethiopia set up after 
the eruption of a violent border dispute in May. Mohammed Said Abdulbeker 
Idris died of jaundice and other complications in early December and 
Mohamedzeyen Said Kahsay died Nov. 25 of pulmonary tuberculosis in 
hospital in southwestern Ethiopia, according to Iternational Committee 
of the Red Cross death notifications sent to the Eritrean government. 
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said the two men, both in their mid-thirties, 
were ``detained illegally'' in the Blatein detention center in southwestern 
Ethiopia and died of ``inhuman treatment and lack of medical attention.'' 
Ethiopia maintains it has detained only Eritreans suspected of assisting 
the Eritrean war effort. In October, three other Eritrean detainees 
died at the Blatein camp, according to the Red Cross. Tesfamariam 
Tekeste, a senior Foreign Ministry official said Ethiopia maintains 
detention centers for Eritreans throughout the country. The ministry 
called on Ethiopia to release all Eritrean civilians. The Red Cross 
will not comment on because it could hamper the agency's ability to 
assist those in detention. Hostilities erupted between Ethiopia and 
Eritrea in May over disputed border areas, resulting in the deaths 
of hundreds in two weeks of heavy fighting. Since then, tensions have 
simmered along the 990-kilometer (620-mile) border, where forces massed 
on both sides exchange sporadic artillery fire. Each government has 
accused the other of deporting tens of thousands of their nationals. 
Eritrean officials charge that an estimated 700 to 1,000 Eritreans 
are being deported from Ethiopia each week. Ethiopian government spokeswoman 
Selome Tadesse said Tuesday that only family members of suspected 
Eritrean spies had been expelled in the last three weeks, but an Ethiopian 
government source said on condition of anonymity confirmed close to 
1,000 had been deported each of the past three weeks. Selome said 
Ethiopia has expelled an estimated 10,000, while Eritrea claims that 
figure is as high as 45,000.
