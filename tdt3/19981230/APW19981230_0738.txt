Four Germans taken captive by Yemeni tribesmen on Dec. 7 were set 
free on Wednesday, Yemeni security officials said. They said the four 
_ three women and a man _ were in good condition and were on their 
way to the Yemeni capital San`a. The officials spoke on customary 
condition of anonymity. There was no information on whether the government 
had agreed to the kidnappers' demands for better public services. 
The release of the Germans came a day after Yemeni security forces 
confronted Islamic militants holding 16 Western hostages. Four of 
the captives died in the melee. Bani Dhabyan gunmen abducted the Germans 
on Dec. 7 in Marib province, which is 170 kilometers (105 miles) southeast 
of San`a. The Bani Dhabyan were pressing the government to provide 
more schools, hospitals, telephone lines and roads for their region. 
German officials had expressed concern about the hostages, especially 
a woman who reportedly was ill. A Yemeni newspaper has identified 
them as Norbert Degen, Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. 
The embassy has not confirmed the names. The tribal leader said the 
health of 64-year-old Brunner, who suffers from high blood pressure, 
was of concern. But he said the hostages received medicine for Brunner 
along with Christmas gifts of chocolates and cigarettes from the embassy. 
Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are controlled 
by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to take the law into their 
own hands to get their demands fulfilled. The hostages are usually 
treated well and released unhurt.
