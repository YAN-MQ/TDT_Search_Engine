Four climbers were killed in an avalanche on a Scottish mountain while 
they were ``living life to the full and doing what they enjoyed most,'' 
their parents said Wednesday. Three of their fellow hikers survived 
the avalanche after being rescued after being trapped for 16 hours 
under tons of snow on the 4,000-foot (1219-meter) Aonoch Mor peak 
near Ben Nevis in the Scottish Highlands. Doctors and mountain rescue 
leaders said it was amazing they stayed alive for so long in subzero 
temperatures. The avalanche struck on Tuesday just an hour after the 
group, six scout members and their instructor, had begun a two-day 
winter climbing skills course. They were reported missing at 2230 
GMT Tuesday when they did not return from the day's climb. Royal Air 
Force mountain rescue teams immediately began a search. Gale force 
winds forced a helicopter to abandon rescue attempts, but ground crews 
found the group at 0120 GMT Wednesday, a police spokesman said. ``Rescuers 
spotted one of the survivors whose top half was showing, but it took 
another two hours to dig everyone else out,'' said police inspector 
Charles Ross. ``It is amazing that anyone survived in the circumstances. 
They were all experienced climbers who were members of some kind of 
organization and had decided they wanted to get some winter conditions 
experience.'' Steven Newton, 24; Sarah Finch, 25, and instructor Roger 
Wild, were carried off the mountain one at a time, and taken to Belford 
Hospital in Fort William, where they were being treated for hypothermia. 
The bodies of Emma Ray, 29; Paul Hopkins, 28; Matthew Lewis, 28, and 
Ian Edwards, 30, were recovered Wednesday. Lewis' father, Bill, said 
his son was a recently qualified accountant. ``We were not there to 
make a judgment on whether they should have heeded weather warnings,'' 
he said. ``Until we can control the weather, we can't do much about 
such a thing as this.'' ``Matthew was very keen to get the experience 
the trip offered and he put a lot of effort into going. I'm concerned 
they might have been overkeen on the day,'' he said. Mrs. Lewis said 
her thoughts were now with the survivors. ``They must have been through 
a dreadful trauma, being buried alive for 16 hours,'' she said. ``They've 
got to live with that the rest of their lives, seeing their friends 
die.'' ``Who knows, they may never get over that,'' she said.
