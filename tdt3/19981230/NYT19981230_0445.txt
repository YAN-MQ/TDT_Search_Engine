San Francisco Coach Steve Mariucci was asked Wednesday to explain 
why his 49ers have lost five successive games to the Green Bay Packers, 
including three straight in the playoffs. ``Too many sacks,'' Mariucci 
quickly responded. Just as quickly, he added: ``And the turnover ratio 
has been lopsided in their favor. The number of big plays for them 
_ the quick-strike factor _ has been a definite issue. Injuries have 
played a role.'' Mariucci paused. ``It's one of those things that 
drives you nuts while you're going through it, and then you find a 
way out,'' he said. ``It's not a whole lot different than the Packers' 
situation with Dallas a few years ago.'' Since the 49ers and Packers 
meet again in the divisional playoffs Sunday at San Francisco's 3Com 
Park, everyone has an opinion about what makes the regal, high-flying 
49ers such flops _ home or away _ against the rough-and-ready Packers. 
``I think it comes down to a lot of luck,'' Green Bay safety LeRoy 
Butler said Wednesday. That is not a factor Packers Coach Mike Holmgren 
had considered. ``Winning streaks are tough to explain sometimes,'' 
Holmgren said. ``I think we kind of snuck up on them a little bit 
in 1995, and that got it started.'' Green Bay's coming of age as one 
of the National Football League's elite teams can be traced to its 
27-17 upset in San Francisco in the 1995 National Football Conference 
divisional playoffs. The Packers fell a game short of the Super Bowl 
that year but have gone to the two Super Bowls since then. Along the 
way, the Packers twice defeated the 49ers in 1996 _ 23-20 in overtime 
during the regular season at Lambeau Field and 35-14 in the divisional 
playoffs. Last season, Green Bay went to 3Com Park and came home with 
a 23-10 victory in the conference championship game. Last month, nine 
sacks of 49ers quarterback Steve Young led to a 36-22 Packers rout. 
Can it be, then, that it is just one of those things, and the Packers 
have the 49ers' number? ``No, I don't think there's anything psychological,'' 
49ers running back Garrison Hearst said. ``We play a physical game.'' 
So might the 49ers be finally due to win one? ``You might think that,'' 
Butler answered. ``But I kind of remember hearing the same thing the 
last time we played them.'' No wonder Mariucci said it is driving 
him nuts. It is also clouding his future, or has at least led to speculation 
about his contract status. There have been reports in Bay Area newspapers 
that Mariucci's job could be in jeopardy if he loses his third consecutive 
game to the Packers. Mariucci's predecessor, George Seifert, had the 
best winning percentage in the history of the NFL, but he was 0-3 
against Green Bay. He was eventually run out of town. To add to the 
intrigue, one rumored successor to Mariucci is Holmgren, who was an 
assistant in San Francisco for five seasons and might be looking for 
a job as coach and general manager somewhere else next season. In 
this bizarre scenario, Mariucci, a former Packers assistant under 
Holmgren, could replace his former boss in Green Bay. Wednesday, Holmgren 
was miffed at suggestions that Mariucci was coaching for his future 
this weekend. ``It's ridiculous,'' Holmgren said. ``I'm proud of the 
job he's done in San Francisco.'' Mariucci, for his part, politely 
declined to be specific about his situation or any potential new contract. 
``We have put it on the back burner,'' he said. ``The intentions of 
all parties involved is to get it done right after the season is over. 
We are focusing on the playoffs, not on speculation. I addressed the 
team and told them the same thing. ``We've got an important football 
game to play.'' Oh yes, the game. As often happens this time of year, 
coaches and players Wednesday seemed to focus on stopping their opponent's 
running game. ``If you watch 49ers film and you see Hearst running 
with the football in the other team's secondary, you're watching a 
team losing to the 49ers,'' Butler said. ``He'll kill you if you don't 
tackle him before he gets much past the line.'' When the Packers defeated 
the 49ers in last year's conference championship game, they held San 
Francisco to just 33 yards rushing on 18 carries. Hearst was coming 
back from a broken clavicle and rushed for only 12 yards on 8 attempts. 
The Packers also sacked Young four times in the fourth quarter of 
that game, holding him to 1 yard rushing. Containing Young in the 
pocket is another goal of the Packers. ``You can't rattle Steve Young,'' 
Butler said. ``But you can hit him and make you sure you tackle him 
when you do.'' Conversely, the 49ers know that the principal reason 
Green Bay struggled at times this season was that injuries made the 
Packers' running game virtually purposeless. ``For a while, we could 
not run at all,'' Holmgren said. ``Now at least we can run it a little. 
Nobody is going to be at midseason form, but we're getting a little 
more healthy there. Hopefully it's not too late.'' Packers running 
back Dorsey Levens returned late in the season to gain 378 yards on 
115 carries. But he rushed for only one touchdown. A productive running 
game would lessen the load on Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre, who 
in an attempt to make up for the Packers' rushing deficiencies has 
thrown 23 interceptions this year. In the meantime, Mariucci awaits 
the renewal of a longtime rivalry, one that dates to 1950. It has 
been a streaky series, with the 49ers twice winning six or more games 
in a row and the Packers winning five successive games three times. 
``When we kick if off, it will be 0-0,'' Mariucci said. ``It's a new 
football game.''
