The hostages were being led by their kidnappers up the mountains to 
a hideout when shots rang out _ Yemeni soldiers sent to rescue the 
16 Westerners had opened fire. It was this shooting Tuesday in southern 
Yemen that triggered the two-hour gun battle that killed four hostages, 
three Britons and an Australian, two former hostages said Wednesday. 
They said they were forced to stand with their hands in the air to 
shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered back two of them were 
shot dead by their captors and the others cowered behind an embankment, 
they said. The account appeared to contradict a Yemeni government 
statement, which said security forces opened fire ``after the kidnappers 
had already started killing the hostages.'' The soldiers were only 
trying to ``prevent further killings and to save the lives of the 
hostages,'' the statement said. In a letter to British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair, Yemen's Prime Minister Abdel Karim al-Iryani repeated 
that version of events and conveyed his condolences to the victims' 
families.
