Two U.S. senators said Wednesday that they would investigate the sophisticated 
marketing practices of the largest sweepstakes companies and other 
mass mailers, just as entries for such contests are arriving in millions 
of Americans' mailboxes. The inquiry will focus on whether new federal 
laws are needed to regulate the language and appearance of mass mailings 
designed to persuade consumers to buy goods promoted by sweepstakes 
and similar contests. It will be conducted jointly by two subcommittees 
of the Senate governmental Affairs Committee. ``Some major sweepstakes 
firms use deceptive language, confusing rules and repeated mailings 
targeting vulnerable people,'' said Sen. Susan M. Collins, R-Maine, 
chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. ``We intend 
to investigate these deceptive practices, hold hearings and introduce 
legislation to better protect consumers.'' The investigation will 
also be conducted by the International Security, Proliferation and 
Federal Services Subcommittee, which is chaired by Sen. Thad Cochran, 
R-Miss. The panels held a joint hearing on the issue in September, 
and investigators have been interviewing witnesses in recent weeks. 
Among the companies that will be examined are two of the industry 
leaders, American Family Publishers and Publishers Clearing House. 
Spokesmen for the companies have said that their direct-mail packages, 
which are mailed to millions of American homes, comply with all laws 
and are not misleading. But subcommittee staff members said concerns 
have been raised about recent mailings from both companies, including 
sweepstakes entries that appear to be government documents. The investigation 
also will examine whether the elderly are targeted and exploited by 
mass mailers. Advocates for senior citizens say that they are often 
victims of the sophisticated language used to sell everything from 
magazines and videos to flower bulbs and jewelry. They say the elderly 
are frequently confused by the language and sometimes become so consumed 
with winning that they spend thousands of dollars entering contests. 
In a civil suit last month, Florida's attorney general accused American 
Family Publishers of preying on the elderly through deceptive solicitations 
and by selling their names and addresses to operators of other contests. 
The company said the suit was unfounded and that elderly consumers 
were not targeted. Collins emphasized that no purchase is necessary 
to enter any legitimate contest and that people should not send money 
in response to any mailing that asks for payment to win a prize.
