In search of some cultural explanation for Japan's wealth of gadgetry, 
I looked up Kanji Kawakami. He's the founder of something called The 
Useless Inventions Academy which, for the last 13 years, has publicized 
hundreds of weird and pointless products. The academy has unveiled 
such classics as the walking washing machine, plexiglass boxes that 
can be strapped to your legs and filled with suds and dirty laundry 
or the baby outfit with mop material sew on the front so that junior 
can swab the decks, as he crawls. OK. Here's a calculator and notebook? 
KANJI KAWAKAMI, founder, the useless Notebook. And paperclips and 
ball point pen. Ball point, yes. And marker. And what's this? Kawakami 
showed me one of his latest inventions, the businessmen's necktie, 
equipped with tiny compartments for paper clips, a pen, notebook and 
even a little razor. A former anti-war activist and college drop-out, 
Kawakami ended up editing Japanese mail-order catalogs. He started 
The Useless Inventions column as a vent for his feelings about Japanese 
materialism. Four books and many translations later, Kawakami has 
been hailed as a post-Cubist wizard by adoring fans across Europe. 
: I think Japanese are controlled by their possessions. Even people 
who live in tiny apartments have to have -- accessories and large-screen 
TVs. It's strange, Japanese, in a sense, are searching for their identify 
through their tools. And as long as the search continues, a flood 
of bizarre and crazy gadgets will, no doubt, keep on flowing. For 
"The World," this is Lucy Kraft in Tokyo.
