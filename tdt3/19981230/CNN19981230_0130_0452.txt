In a first of its kind case, pizza hut has settled a lawsuit filed 
by a Black family who says restaurant employees harassed and taunted 
them. The suit was filed on behalf of 16 family members who ate at 
an Illinois pizza hut in 1995. The settlement comes after a court 
ruling last summer that corporations can be held liable if their employees 
commit hate crimes. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed.
