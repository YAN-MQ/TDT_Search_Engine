Yasser Arafat and other Palestinian leaders won't vote in the upcoming 
israeli election. But as Jerrold Kessel reports, they certainly have 
a stake in its outcome. a personal prayer from Benjamin Netanyahu 
at Judaism's holiest site, the western wall. The Israeli prime minister 
declined the opportunity to talk about the upcoming election and which 
of the challengers for his job he most fears. In an increasingly crowded 
pack, the election wild card could be someone not running at all, 
Yasser Arafat. Even though the Palestinian leader is adamant, there's 
no Palestinian role in the Israeli contest. This is an internal issue 
we don't interfere in. But memories are still fresh about how the 
last Israeli election campaign was swayed by a series of devastating 
Palestinian suicide bombings, attacks which gave Mr. Netanyahu a critical 
lift to his upset victory. Now, Palestinian authorities insist they'll 
do everything they can to prevent a repeat of the violence from militant 
groups. We will start a dialogue with all Palestinians to control 
the behavior of all Palestinians. Over the weekend, a rally of Hamas, 
the biggest militant group, was addressed by its spiritual leader 
sheikh Ahmed Yassin -- just freed from Palestinian house arrest. I'm 
political, not military. This military, they have orders to resist 
and to fight the occupation. I don't think so they have any orders 
except this. As Israelis turn inward to their election concern, Palestinians 
are also faced with a critical choice of their own -- do they declare 
a State before the Israeli election and risk boosting those Israeli 
candidates who are most opposed to a Palestinian state? We are not 
going to take a unilateral decision. We will consult all our friends, 
United States, European countries, and then, we will take the right 
decision for the right direction to achieve real peace. Whether there 
will be a new drive towards peace will be affected in a major way 
by what happens on what are now two D-days in may. Jerrold Kessel, 
CNN, Gaza city.
