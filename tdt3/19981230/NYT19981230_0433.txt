Viola Farber, a founding member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, 
a choreographer and the director of the dance program at Sarah Lawrence 
College, died on Dec. 24 at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. 
She was 67 and lived in Bronxville. The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, 
Jeff Slayton, her former husband and longtime dance partner, said. 
A tall, long-bodied individualist with cropped hair long before that 
was fashionable, Ms. Farber was an unself-conscious study in quiet 
unpredictability. She moved with a fierce passion and intensity and 
a gentle lyricism. She could speak with the softness of a shy, reflective 
child or, in the studio, with the toughness of a drill sergeant. An 
edge of lazily subversive wit lay beneath her plain-spokenness in 
conversation and in her dancing. In the quintessentially Farberesque 
``Legacy,'' which she choreographed in 1968 to a Chopin etude, Ms. 
Farber moved like a dreaming, elegant giraffe, dressed in a flowing 
shift but wearing a baseball catcher's mitt on one hand. Poetic and 
mysterious, the solo was not at all Dadaist despite the incongruity 
and potential humor of the mitt. ``Her body often had the look of 
one part being in balance, and the rest extremely off,'' Cunningham 
wrote of her in David Vaughan's book ``Merce Cunningham: Fifty Years,'' 
in a description of Ms. Farber in his 1960 ``Crises,'' created in 
part for her odd talents. ``Now and again it was like two persons, 
another just ahead or behind the first. This was coupled with an acute 
rhythmic sense.'' Born in Heidelberg, Germany, Ms. Farber came to 
the United States with her family at the age of 7 and became a naturalized 
citizen six years later. She met Cunningham and his collaborator John 
Cage in 1952 at Black Mountain College, where she was studying dance 
with Katherine Litz and music with Lou Harrison. Ms. Farber joined 
the Cunningham company in 1953, dancing there through 1965. She created 
roles in some of Cunningham's major early works, among them ``Crises,'' 
``Rune'' and ``Nocturne.'' During her Cunningham years, she also performed 
with Litz, playing a vampire in her ``Dracula,'' and with Peter Saul 
and Paul Taylor. Her last performance was in a 1995 collaborative 
duet, ``Threestep (Shipwreck),'' which she created with the choreographer 
Ralph Lemon, a former student, for his company's season at the Joyce 
Theater. Ms. Farber formed the Viola Farber Dance Company in 1968, 
creating most of her choreography for the troupe, which disbanded 
in 1985. Writing in the International Encyclopedia of Dance, Christopher 
Caines describes her earliest dances as having a febrile atmosphere 
and ``a dark, violent intensity that some interpreted as sadomasochistic, 
despite moments of tenderness.'' By the 1970's, Ms. Farber had mellowed 
considerably. ``My dances report what I see,'' she told Jack Anderson 
in a 1978 interview in The New York Times. ``They are my response 
to the way everything is mixed up together in this world _ people 
and microbes and elephants and cassowary birds.'' In her 1973 ``Poor 
Eddie,'' Ms. Farber incorporated the gestures of flight attendants 
as they demonstrate the use of safety equipment in planes. Her own 
nervousness about driving in the middle, passing lane on a three-lane 
highway inspired the creation of another dance, ``Route 6.'' Like 
Cunningham, Ms. Farber favored the juxtaposition of disparate kinds 
of activity in dance, where formal patterns and the combinations of 
steps often mattered more than the steps themselves. Ms. Farber was 
especially popular in France, where she won a gold medal, with Slayton, 
in the Ninth International Dance Festival in Paris in 1971. From 1981 
to 1983 she was the artistic director of the Centre National de Danse 
Contemporaine in Angers, establishing, at the same time, an institute 
for the training of dance teachers in Paris. Ms. Farber returned to 
the United States in 1988 to take the Sarah Lawrence post, but continued 
to teach and choreograph in France into the 1990's. She also taught 
at the London Contemporary Dance School from 1984 to 1987 and, from 
early in her career, at universities and dance festivals throughout 
the United States. The French government recently named Ms. Farber 
an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France. She is survived 
by two sisters, Elisabeth Lanzl of Chicago and Irene Aikin of Parkdale, 
Ore.
