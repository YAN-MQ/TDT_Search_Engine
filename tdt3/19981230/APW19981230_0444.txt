Just when Greek soccer fans hoped the worst was over, they learned 
the new year will bring even more anguish: a soccer club strike in 
a sport reeling from fan violence and corruption allegations. All 
first, second and third division games planned for this weekend were 
called off Tuesday due to a strike called by the Association of Professional 
Soccer Clubs, or EPAE. The association, which organizes Greece's top 
three soccer leagues, is demanding 300 million drachmas (more than 
dlrs 1 million) that it says are owed by the state agency that organizes 
the weekly soccer pools. The association has also demanded an increase 
in the percentage of pool profits it receives. But the agency, known 
as OPAP, has refused to budge. Unless the agency pays the 300 million 
drachmas by Jan. 4, EPAE has threatened to extend its strike to cover 
the weekend of Jan. 9-11. This would force a second postponement of 
the matches. ``A hungry bear can't dance. We will play if OPAP gives 
us the money,'' said Petros Theodoridis, the owner of the first-division 
Iraklis team, according to the daily Sportime newspaper. EPAE's strike 
appears to be further reducing the public's interest in soccer _ which 
is losing ground in Greece to basketball. ``It will not be the end 
of the world if there is no soccer for a few weeks,'' the Athens daily 
Kathimerini quoted Sports Minister Andreas Fouras as saying. His comments 
seem to reflect the feelings of many soccer followers, who have shown 
no signs of being troubled by the prospect of two weekends without 
matches. The strike comes towards the end of the holiday season, with 
most people taking advantage of the long weekend to head to the countryside. 
But a recent series of violent fan clashes and allegations of bribery 
and corruption have already diminished the game's appeal to mainstream 
followers. Sparked by accusations of biased refereeing, a wave of 
vandalism and violence began in November. It led to harsh criticism 
of the sport in a parliamentary committee report. ``Our country is 
being internationally defamed at the time it is preparing to organize 
the Olympic Games,'' the report said. Rioting fans during a first 
division match on Dec. 8 between Olympiakos Piraeus and its main rival 
Panathinaikos left a stream of burnt cars, battered bystanders and 
damaged seats from the stadium set to host the 2004 Olympic Games. 
Last year, nearly half the country's 300 lawmakers issued a statement 
complaining soccer ``is being led to decline and extermination.''
