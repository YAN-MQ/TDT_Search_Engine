Peter Sinclair began writing and drawing his comic strip, ``Alex's 
Restaurant'' in 1990. The strip details the life of a restaurant run 
by Alex, a rat-race dropout, and peopled by a crew of holistically 
minded, slightly batty regulars. These include Cranbrook, a soup-dropping, 
wild-haired waiter who explains the more obscure items on the menu 
(like the three-day fast), and Dr. Andy Vial _ a respectful lampoon 
of Dr. Andrew Weil, the nationally known dispenser of medical advice 
_ who stops by the restaurant to promote books like ``Hooked on Colonics.'' 
Syndication once brought Sinclair's strip to about 50 papers in 1990. 
But the syndicate lost interest, and the strip was dropped. ``Many 
editors were nervous about its radical content,'' Sinclair wrote in 
a self-published collection of his strips that appeared in 1998. After 
stints as a nurse and a paramedic, Sinclair began drawing the strip 
again in 1995, after a friend convinced him that the Internet offered 
a good way to reach readers. He first launched the site that year. 
``The whole message that the Internet is giving people,'' Sinclair 
said, `is: `Here's the audience. It's there to be had. But you have 
to make it happen.''' The pioneering media Web site Nando Times (www.nando.net/nt/comics/alex/today) 
picked up Alex's Restaurant for publication over a year ago, and features 
a link to the strip on its home page. Sinclair's daily strip also 
runs on its own site (www.alexsrestaurant.com), which gets a few thousand 
visitors every day. Sinclair has garnered praise from sources as varied 
as Yahoo Internet Life magazine, and the Tel Aviv newspaper Ha'Aretz, 
which proclaimed him (in Hebrew) one of the top five Internet cartoonists. 
While that might not have quite the same ring to it as the Pulitzer 
Prize, the praise is evidence both of Sinclair's talent and of the 
growing phenomenon of cartoons on the Internet. Now some veteran cartoonists, 
with millions or even hundreds of millions of daily newspaper readers, 
also are turning to the Internet. Like other Web-based cartoonists, 
however, Sinclair wants to use his Internet popularity to gain a stronger 
foothold in newspapers. Web site revenue sharing is negligible for 
most cartoonists, but each additional newspaper that a cartoonist 
picks up can generate anything from an additional few hundred dollars 
a year to several thousand. So far, the comic strip has been providing 
Sinclair with only a modest income, which he supplements with illustration 
and Web design work. ``I'd like to say that tons of money are coming 
in, that I'm being inundated with awards and offers, but it's more 
intimate than that,'' Sinclair said. ``I'm gaining readers one by 
one.'' Another Web-based strip that has achieved some prominence is 
``Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet,'' by Peter Zale. ``Helen'' (www.peterzale.com) 
features a story line that follows Helen, a Greek-American geek with 
a greater love for computers than concern for her social life or her 
drop-dead gorgeous looks. Zale posts about six new strips every two 
weeks; the everyday grind didn't mesh well with his day job as an 
art director and computer system administrator at a Midwest ad agency. 
But he felt that a Web site was critical for the credibility of the 
strip _ and not just to boost it into newspaper synidcation. ``It 
was the topic of the strip, Helen being involved with the Internet, 
that made it necessary for the strip to have a Web site,'' he said. 
he first cartoonist to have put an e-mail address in a comic strip 
appears to have been Scott Adams, creator of the wildly successful 
``Dilbert.'' An extensive ``Dilbert'' Web site was built a few years 
after that (www.dilbert.com). ``There were a lot of decisions early 
on that seem trivial now, but were really kind of epic,'' said Adams, 
who credits ``Dilbert'' 's rapid spread in newspapers to the Web tie-in. 
Adams started with about 50 papers in 1989, and had grown to about 
150 when he added the e-mail address in 1993. By the time Adams launched 
the Dilbert Web site in 1995, Dilbert was reaching about 400 papers. 
Adams' reach now has extended to 1,900 papers. With a Dilbert television 
show in the works, books consistently on the bestseller list and the 
envy of his peers and aspiring new cartoonists, he finds himself at 
the center of a small industry. ``Somebody's going to be Walt Disney,'' 
Adams said, ``and it would be nice if it were me.'' Adams gets help 
from the syndicate to keep on top of his e-mail. But the demands of 
the peculiarly interactive environment that is the Internet, especially 
e-mail, have overwhelmed some cartoonists. Bob Thaves has been drawing 
``Frank and Ernest'' for more than 25 years. The strip, which appears 
in more than 1,200 newspapers, was one of the first widely distributed 
strips to include an e-mail address (www.comiczone.com/comics/franknernest/ab.html). 
Almost immediately, he began receiving thousands of e-mail messages. 
``We were totally unprepared for that,'' said Thaves, whose son and 
daughter help handle the strip's correspondence. Gary Delainey, who 
writes the daily strip ``Betty,'' distributed to over 600 newspapers, 
said, ``Cartooning, like writing, is very lonely. You sit isolated 
doing your stuff in a vacuum.'' Delainey sounds almost wistful about 
life before he was on the Net. ``I was free to do whatever the hell 
I wanted,'' he said. ``I had the feeling that nobody was reading it, 
anyway.'' The hundreds of e-mail messages that regularly come in to 
Delainey and the strip's illustrator, Gerry Rasmussen (www.comiczone.com/comics/betty/ab.html), 
have put the lie to that. ``We've had some interesting relationships 
develop with certain readers,'' he said. ``It opens up a sort of dialogue.'' 
Other cartoonists, like Bill Amend, creator of the popular ``Foxtrot,'' 
resist that kind of exchange. ``The problem with interacting in a 
daily way via e-mail with readers is the sheer imbalance in scale,'' 
he said. ``I've got a strip that may have 20 million readers, but 
there's one of me.'' Amend has made use of the lobbying power of his 
Net readers, which numbered 30,000 one recent month, to influence 
comic-page editors to run his strip. Still cartoonists are wondering 
whether they will be able to make a living from the Internet. ``There 
are very few realistic opportunities for the aspiring cartoonist,'' 
Amend said. The Internet, he said, has ``broken that model, given 
everybody their own printing press. Now, whether they're attracting 
audiences is a different question.''
