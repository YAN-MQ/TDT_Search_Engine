As Manhattan's real estate market burbles merrily along _ stock market 
turmoil or no _ the real estate market in the Hamptons has been more 
like a roller coaster. After the heart-stopping 512-point drop in 
the Dow on Aug. 31, would-be buyers of Manhattan apartments hesitated, 
and prices took a slight dip _ many brokers estimated between 5 percent 
and 10 percent. But since then, they report, Manhattan properties 
have recovered everything they lost _ and may even have gained some. 
In the Hamptons, it's been a wilder ride. In early and even late September 
_ while Manhattan apartment hunters stepped back and counted their 
fingers and toes and some talked to their lawyers about getting out 
of deals _ people kept buying and selling on the East End of Long 
Island, especially in towns with ``Hampton'' at the end of their names. 
And then, in October, just as agents were breathing a sigh of relief, 
kerplunk! ``The market just dried up _ nothing,'' said Diane Saatchi, 
the president of Dayton-Halstead in East Hampton. ``Usually, October 
is a good month, and people at least start thinking about rentals. 
Even that didn't happen.'' Frank Newbold, a Sotheby's vice president 
who manages the East Hampton office, agrees. ``Things were going great 
guns,'' he said. ``By September, we had three times the contracts 
we had at the same time the year before.'' Then the same thing happened 
at his office. ``Dead doggo in October,'' he said. His clients blamed 
the stock market's uncertainty, the impeachment, the problems in Russia 
and Asia. And there wasn't a lot to buy _ if you wanted an estate, 
that is. ``No new estate houses were listed because the owners told 
us the stock market was too shaky,'' Newbold said. ``They said, `We 
don't want to try our house in this tentative market.' They were afraid 
they would give a party and nobody would come.'' Then, in late November, 
he said, the real estate market started to raise its head. ``On Nov. 
23, somebody announced that the market had finally gained back those 
500 points.'' Now, at this impossible time of year (for buying real 
estate, anyway), customers are again rushing to buy in the Hamptons. 
``The pace is almost like early summer,'' Ms. Saatchi said. ``Good 
properties have multiple bids, and sellers are double-dealing like 
nuts.'' Part of the double-dealing, she explained, is a practice known 
as ``gazumping,'' in which a seller agrees to a price and then, while 
the contracts are being drawn up, agrees to sell to a second buyer 
for more money. First buyers, who thought they had a deal, have been 
_ alas _ gazumped. And it isn't only sales. ``All of a sudden, all 
of the good rentals are gone,'' Ms. Saatchi said. One four-bedroom 
house with a pool and tennis court in Sagaponack _ south of the highway, 
not on the water _ just rented for $130,000 for the season. The market 
is about the same as last year, she said, but some people are asking 
a little more _ and getting it. One tiny two-bedroom cottage in East 
Hampton Village, asking $12,000 for the season, was gone by the time 
the call was made to show it. Dickinson Baker, office manager for 
Amaden Realty, said, ``Let's face it _ what happens on Wall Street 
has a lot to do with real estate out here, and that seems to have 
settled down.'' But now, he said: ``It's crazy out here. People are 
buying Christmas and New Year's presents for each other. And mortgage 
money's really cheap right now. If the stock market takes another 
little tumble, they're figuring real estate might be OK.'' In a break 
with tradition, appointments were scheduled for the two days before 
Christmas and the weekend after it. ``And it's not just us,'' Baker 
said. ``None of the agents want to say no _ we want to make hay while 
the sun shines.'' And making hay they are. Last week, Baker's office 
put two large houses under contract, worth a total of $5 million. 
There are even bidding wars for so-called midrange houses, though 
less often. ``There was a $650,000 two-story farmhouse in Bridgehampton,'' 
said Doreen Niggles, an agent at Allan M. Schneider. ``My customer 
saw it. The same day, she said to me, `I want to make an offer _ should 
I make it full price?' The woman came in with $645,000. Within 10 
minutes, somebody else offered $650,000. The owner came back and asked 
who could do all cash. They both could. Then the seller asked for 
full financials. They both produced them, and they were both good. 
Then it went to sealed bids.'' Ms. Niggles, a veteran of 14 years, 
was astonished. ``A bidding war over a $650,000 house!'' she said. 
Her customer lost, she added. ``And the other one took it at a price 
I can't reveal, but it was $10,000 to $15,000 above the asking price.'' 
That is rare. While prices for the creme de la creme are reported 
to be at or, in rare cases, above the asking prices, most houses in 
the Hamptons are more negotiable than they were in the frenetic spring. 
The highest-priced houses are generally in East Hampton. But even 
there, the brokers say, some prices are negotiable. ``There was a 
feeding frenzy, and frankly, that has passed,'' Newbold said. ``Now, 
people are looking at more houses. They're asking to see what comparable 
properties sold for. They're taking their time.'' And often they're 
offering less. For the less expensive properties _ and there are hundreds 
of them for sale, like a five-room cedar bungalow on Meadowgrass Lane 
in Southampton, which just closed for $190,000 _ bargainers are making 
a lot of deals for about 10 percent off, the Sotheby's executive said. 
And maybe more. ``If it's cash and fast, some sellers are taking more 
off,'' he said. ``A 30-day closing is very tempting to a seller. After 
all, who knows what the stock market will do in the spring?''
