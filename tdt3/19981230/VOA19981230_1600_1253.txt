England's one day cricket team has defeated the Queensland country 
team by 53 runs in a match in Brisbane, Australia. The Holy Oak Brothers, 
Adam and Ben, provided most of the offense for the English. Adam scored 
81 runs from 78 balls, while younger brother Ben made 51 from 76 deliveries. 
The final score: England 281 for seven, and Queensland 228 all out 
in 49.5 overs. The match was the first warm up for the English one 
day specialists ahead of a triangular series featuring Australia and 
Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, New Zealand's critic team scored a four wicket 
win over India in the second test match in Wellington Wednesday. Chasing 
a victory target of 213 runs, the Kiwis scored 215 for six, just 23 
minutes after lunch on the fifth and final day. The victory gives 
New Zealand a one to nothing lead over India in the three-match series.
