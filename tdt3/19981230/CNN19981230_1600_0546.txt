Will January 1st, 2000 go down in history as the day the computers 
died? To help you understand what could happen that day, and how to 
prepare for it, we're starting a ten part series called, "Y2K, will 
the bug bite?" In part one, Kate snow explains why it's such a serious 
problem. Sometimes it's hard to tell who is in charge, people or computers. 
Computers bring electricity to our homes and deliver life-saving medicine. 
They control some of the most mundane systems on earth -- and some 
of the most deadly ones, too. We've become dependent on computers 
in a very short period of time. We don't realize how dependent we 
are. And we're about to realize just how dependent we are, if in fact 
we have some serious malfunctions. All this trouble because of one 
little glitch? The combination of these advances brought about a second 
generation of computers in 1960. The Y2K bug was born in the '60s 
as a programming trick. The years were stored as two digits. '63 meant 
1963, '74 meant 1974. In the days when computer memory was expensive, 
that made sense. But it doesn't make sense anymore. Unless they're 
fixed, many computers will confuse the year 2000 with the year 1900. 
Some could make mistakes and produce useless data. Others might simply 
crash. We don't know exactly what's going to happen. But when you 
have tens of thousands of problems, you can be guaranteed that a vast 
majority of those will be trivial. And that a handful of them will 
be severe. Catastrophic even. What's the chance your telephone won't 
work? Will it be safe to fly? Over the next several days, we'll help 
you separate the reality of the problem from the myths. I haven't 
done one thing in my personal life about it. I'm just hoping it all 
works out. We live with technology every day. The car doesn't start 
we get by, no problem. You'll hear from the experts who agree the 
Y2K bug is serious, but not the end of the world. Even the worst-case 
scenarios that are now shaping up in the United States, based on what 
we know, are not the end of civilization. Most important, we'll show 
you how to be prepared and not overreact. Take charge of your own 
preparedness. Don't panic. Don't let somebody on a web site tell you 
what to do. But do pay attention. With so many computers with our 
lives, you don't want the year 2000 to creep up on you. Kate snow, 
"Headline News."
