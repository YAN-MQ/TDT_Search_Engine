With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
High temperatures, going to be rather cold all the way from Hudson 
bay into the upper Mississippi river valley, the Ohio valley and the 
northeast with single digits and teens. May expect some 20s in sections 
of coastal northeast and New England, also through the Tennessee valley. 
40s and 50s will prevail through the interior west and the pacific 
northwest. Here's the way our weather picture is shaping up. More 
wet weather after a bit of a lull overnight on Wednesday for the pacific 
northwest. That rain moves on shore by Thursday. The central plains 
pick up some snow showers as well. Generally speaking, two to four 
inches will be some of the common amounts. And breezy weather conditions 
into the northeast. For Fairbanks, Alaska, look for minus 20 degrees 
for a high. The extended forecast is still calling for that wet, soggy 
weather for the pacific northwest. And those temperatures still going 
to be fairly cool, wrapped around the Great Lakes. On Friday, some 
thunderstorms could be rumbling along the lower Mississippi river 
valley, then into the mid-atlantic by Saturday. For more weather information,
