In U.S. news, President Clinton has announced a new initiative to 
stop violence against children. In a ceremony at the White House, 
the president said crime rates in the United States have gone down, 
but he added that more needs to be done to break the cycle of violence 
for children. The president noted children who experienced serious 
violence are 50 more likely to be arrested and are at increased risk 
of drug abuse, mental illness, and suicide. The president called on 
the Justice Department to propose laws that would define as murder 
the death of a child resulting from a pattern of abuse.
