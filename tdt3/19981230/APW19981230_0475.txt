An alliance of radical Kosovo Albanian parties expressed full support 
Wednesday for the pro-independence armed force, the Kosovo Liberation 
Army, and suggested that fighting may re-escalate. ``The Kosovo Liberation 
Army is the central national, political and moral force,'' said Rexhep 
Qosja, the leader of six parties and political groups of ethnic Albanians 
in the Serbian province. The alliance is a rival of the main ethnic 
Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, despite their common ultimate goal 
of an independent Kosovo. In turning to armed struggle, ``Albanians 
in Kosovo have decided to use their natural right for defense after 
many years of endurance'' of Serbian rule, Qosja said. Asked if the 
current, shaky truce in the province would hold, Qosja said that ``a 
lasting peace has not been secured, and therefore, I'm a pessimist.'' 
Also on Wednesday, a Rugova aide acknowledged that differences within 
the Kosovo Albanian camp should be resolved and that ``reality requires 
a consensus of all Kosovo Albanian factions.'' U.S. mediators in the 
conflict have been trying to unite Kosovo Albanian factions, a prerequisite 
for any fruitful direct peace talks with the Serbian government. Ajeti 
also said the ethnic Albanians still expect NATO intervention against 
the government troops fighting to prevent the secession.
