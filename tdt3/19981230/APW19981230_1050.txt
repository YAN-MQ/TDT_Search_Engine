International Olympic Committee vice president Richard Pound said 
he came to get a first-hand look at the evidence surrounding purported 
bribes of Salt Lake Olympic officials. ``I've seen summaries of what 
they had,'' Pound told the Deseret News on Wednesday. ``That's one 
thing, but it's not as useful as seeing what the actual records look 
like.'' Pound completed a two-day visit Wednesday and then left town 
without issuing a statement on information concerning the bid process 
that brought the 2002 Olympic Winter Games to Utah. He was looking 
for information to be included in an IOC report on the matter. The 
commission Pound heads was expected to submit a report to the IOC 
executive board on Jan. 24 at Lausanne, Switzerland. But IOC director 
general Francois Carrard, coordinator of the investigation, said Wednesday 
the Salt Lake inquiry may take more time. ``I don't know whether we 
will have a final report on Jan. 23,'' he said in a telephone interview 
from IOC headquarters. ``I'm sure there will be a progress report, 
but it may not be the final stage.'' Meanwhile, a former employee 
of the Salt Lake bid committee said Wednesday that members of the 
Olympic family openly accepted gifts for years. Salt Lake Olympic 
officials have admitted having a dlrs 400,000 scholarship fund that 
benefited 13 recipients, including six relatives of IOC members. IOC 
members also were given thousands of dollars worth of guns and skis 
and some received free medical treatments, including plastic surgery. 
Robert Hunter, who worked as the Salt Lake bid committee's head of 
communications for two years and with the Salt Lake Organizing Committee 
for another two before leaving last June, told the Standard-Examiner 
of Ogden that such gift-giving seemed to be common practice. ``Just 
about all IOC members came here and they've all benefited from gifts 
that exceeded whatever the rule was,'' said Hunter, who added that 
he saw nothing wrong with the practice. ``All of our guests were treated 
very, very well.'' ``You do it and it's fun and out of it you see 
people come together,'' he said. ``But there was never any clandestine 
plan and everybody saw what we were doing for years.'' Shelley Thomas, 
SLOC senior vice president of communications, said she wasn't part 
of Pound's information-gathering session and didn't know who was interviewed 
by the Canadian executive. She also said Pound, a lawyer from Montreal, 
would make no additional statements. In the interview with the Deseret 
News, Pound said he wanted to hear SLOC's side of the story and planned 
to conduct interviews before leaving Wednesday afternoon. ``One of 
the things we're going to have to do is get explanations for some 
of the things we've found,'' Pound said. ``We do have to be careful 
we don't `Ready, aim, fire.''' He said that while SLOC officials were 
being cooperative, some of the documents he wanted to review were 
not available. ``It was kind of a rush job for them,'' Pound said. 
``I haven't got it all. So far, what they've found seems to support 
their general recollections.'' Thomas said Pound spent most of the 
day on Wednesday in a conference room and did not break for lunch. 
She did not know what materials or documents Pound was reviewing, 
but noted that employees were asked to retrieve bid documents. ``All 
we're doing is answering requests and answering fully any questions,'' 
Thomas said Wednesday. ``He is keeping his own schedule.'' Frank Zang, 
SLOC director of communications, said a lawyer from the Los Angeles 
law firm of O'Melveny and Myers, which the IOC panel has hired to 
represent it in the investigation, also was present at Salt Lake Olympic 
offices on Wednesday. The IOC inquiry is one of four into the Salt 
Lake bid. Also investigating are the Justice Department, the U.S. 
Olympic Committee and the Salt Lake organizing committee's ethics 
board. A U.S. Olympic Committee panel headed by former Maine Sen. 
George Mitchell began its investigation on Tuesday in Washington, 
D.C., and is planning to issue its report to the USOC by Feb. 28.
