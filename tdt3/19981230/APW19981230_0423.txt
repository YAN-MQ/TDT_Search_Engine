Israel's parliament has passed legislation that bans the cloning of 
humans for the next five years and monitors genetic research, the 
sponsor of the bill said Wednesday. ``Human cloning endangers humanity 
as seriously as nuclear weapons,'' said Labor Party legislator Hagai 
Merom. ``That also began as an experiment but later became a weapon 
of mass destruction.'' The law which passed Tuesday allows genetic 
intervention for medical purposes, such as cloning a healthy organ 
for donation. Researchers wishing to conduct experiments in human 
genetics must show an advisory committee that their research does 
not violate the ban. Violation of the ban is punishable by two years 
in prison. The committee will report yearly to the science minister 
to reassess whether the outlawed research harms human dignity. Merom 
said that doctors, researchers, legislators, philosophers and religious 
leaders discussed the issue for 18 months before agreeing to the five-year 
moratorium. In 2003, parliament will decide whether to renew the ban. 
Merom said parliament was guided in its decision by other countries 
and several U.S. states that have also banned human cloning. Unlike 
Christian leaders who have called for a ban on human cloning, Israel's 
Chief Rabbinate has said Jewish law does not necessarily rule it out.
