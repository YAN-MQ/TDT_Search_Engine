The junior partner in the ruling coalition on Cypress says it will 
withdraw from the government to protest the failure to deploy Russian-made 
missiles on the divided land. The Socialist Party leader says the 
party's central committee will approve the decision Saturday. A government 
spokesman says the decision to place the anti-aircraft missiles on 
the Greek Island of Crete is a response to the international situation.
