A leader of the Caucasus republic of Ingushetia accused neighboring 
North Ossetia on Wednesday of preventing Ingush refugees from returning 
to their homes, a news agency said. ``The leadership of North Ossetia 
... is artificially creating obstacles to the return of Ingushis deported 
from North Ossetia,'' Ingush Vice Premier Akhmet Malsagov said, according 
to ITAR-Tass. The Ossetian-Ingush conflict goes back to a 1944 decision 
by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin to deport the entire Ingush nation 
for collaborating with the Nazis during World War II. When the Ingush 
were permitted to return to the Caucasus in 1957, they found their 
homes inhabited by Ossetians. Ever since, both groups have claimed 
territory that is now part of North Ossetia. Malsagov charged that 
only 835 families, or 3,353 people, had been allowed to return to 
their homes this year, and about 5,000 people over the last six years. 
The two Russian regions fought a brief territorial and ethnic war 
in 1992, and sporadic violence has continued. Russian Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov convened a meeting of the leaders of the two republics 
in September in an effort to calm tensions.
