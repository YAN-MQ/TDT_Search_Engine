A U.N. agency that delivers emergency food aid says that in 1999 more 
people around the world will probably need humanitarian assistance 
because of crises this year like Hurricane Mitch and economic collapses 
in Indonesia and Russia. ``We have to enter 1999 with the understanding 
that we may face an increased threat of famine, malnutrition and endemic 
hunger,'' Catherine Bertini, executive director of the World Food 
Program, said in a statement Wednesday. Other developments cited by 
the Rome-based agency as possible causes for driving up world hunger: 
flareups of civil warfare in Kosovo and Angola.
