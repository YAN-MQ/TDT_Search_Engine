Another group of international monitors is in Kosovo where a fragile 
truce has been shaken by recent violence between Serb forces and ethnic 
Albanian separatists. The new observers of the Kosovar verification 
mission arrived Tuesday. Their arrival coincided with warnings by 
NATO that it stands ready to intervene if the Serb forces and rebels 
of the KLA fail to respect the cease-fire.
