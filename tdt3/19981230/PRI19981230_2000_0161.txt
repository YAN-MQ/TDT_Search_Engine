Turkey is criticizing the purchase of Russian anti-aircraft missiles 
by Greek Cypriates. The Turkish government says putting the Russian 
missile system on the Greek Island of Crete will still increase tensions. 
Cypress has been divided since Turkey invaded the North in 1974. The 
BBC's Chris Morris reports from Anchora. Turkey still isn't satisfied, 
even though its territory is now beyond the range of the 300s. Anchora 
believes that their presence on Crete will destabilize the region. 
Officials here also argue that deploying a Russian weapon system in 
a NATO country is not a good precedent. Both Turkey and the Turkish 
Cypriates have also criticized recent United Nations resolutions which 
they believe favor the Greek Cypriates. Officials in Anchora say the 
international community is trying to compensate President Clarides 
for his decision to back down on the missile deployment. Chris Morris 
reporting from Anchora.
