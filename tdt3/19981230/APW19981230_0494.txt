With Russia effectively in default on a major foreign debt, Western 
creditors were trying to decide Wednesday how to deal with a country 
that's struggling to pay its bills. Russia failed Tuesday to make 
a dlrs 363 million cash payment on dlrs 26 billion worth of loans 
that Moscow must repay to the London Club of commercial creditors. 
Russian officials said that the country was technically not in default 
because more than 70 percent of the debt holders had agreed to accept 
new bonds instead of cash. Russia's Vneshekonombank, the state-owned 
bank responsible for repaying the debt, claimed it only needed the 
support of two-thirds of creditors to make the payment in bonds. But 
London Club members have indicated that 95 percent of debt holders 
will need to approve the plan. Bank of America, the payment agent 
for the London Club, was expected to make a statement on the issue 
Wednesday. If creditors want to formally declare Russia in default 
on the debts, it would require a majority vote of the London Club 
members. But such a move could only further complicate efforts to 
sort out Russia's mounting debt problems, analysts said. Russia now 
faces about dlrs 150 billion in foreign debts that it must repay in 
coming years. When the country's economic crisis hit in August, the 
government also effectively defaulted on dlrs 40 billion worth of 
domestic treasury bonds. Russia is seeking to work out restructuring 
agreements with its creditors, but the process has been moving slowly, 
while the economy continues to crumble. Most of Russia's foreign debt 
was inherited from the Soviet Union, and those are considered the 
riskiest debts. Moscow has tried to stay current on debt that was 
run up in the post-Soviet period, and the country has continued paying 
interest on Eurobonds issued after the Soviet breakup. But if Russia 
misses too many loan repayments, then it's unlikely to get new loans 
needed to help it through the current crisis, which hit this past 
summer. Without foreign aid, the government is likely to print a huge 
amount of new cash, leading to the kind of high inflation that has 
plagued Russia in the early 1990s. Since the crisis hit in August, 
the Russian ruble has fallen from 6 to U.S. dollar to 21. Inflation, 
which appeared under control until the crisis hit, is expected to 
top 70 percent for the year.
