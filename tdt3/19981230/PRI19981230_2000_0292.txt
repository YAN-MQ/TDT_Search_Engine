Five Thai elephants stranded in Indonesia are now back home after 
a long campaign by animals rights activists. The elephants were originally 
sent to Indonesia to work for a forestry company. They were left stranded 
when the company went bust. Sarita Salwalla of Friends of the Elephant 
explains why they had to be sent home to their handlers. Elephants 
without handlers are very dangerous, indeed. And they -- one of the 
elephants is 12 years old and he was raised with his handler for nine 
years. So they've been very attached to each other. Sarita Salwalla 
of Friends of the Elephant in Bangkok.
