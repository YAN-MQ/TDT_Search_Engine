One survivor tells of how his friend and skipper died in his arms 
from a heart attack in the flooded cabin of a stricken Sydney-to-Hobart 
race yacht. Another says he almost drowned as he struggled to free 
himself from the deadly trap of a safety harness, which drowned a 
crewmate, after a giant wave overturned their yacht. Sailors Steve 
Walker and Rob Matthews were giving the first accounts Wednesday of 
their nightmare hours on the Tasmanian 12-meter (40-foot) Business 
Post Naiad after it was disabled by huge seas on Sunday night in Bass 
Strait during the annual race. Four race sailors died and two are 
missing and presumed drowned. Business Post Naiad owner-skipper Bruce 
Guy, 51, and crew member Phil Skeggs, 35, who lived in the same street 
in the Launceston, Tasmania suburb of Riverside, died. An emotional 
Walker, who broke down several times, said the weather steadily worsened 
during Sunday afternoon and night. During the early evening, a massive 
breaking wave rolled their boat 360 degrees. The mast, windows and 
cabin were broken and four crew went over the side in their harnesses 
but were rescued. They sent out a mayday, which was acknowledged, 
cleared the shrouds from the propeller and started their engine intending 
to head for the closest land. ``It was very difficult to keep on course 
dodging the waves,'' Walker said. ``We had two on deck in one-hour 
shifts, one giving compass headings and the other steering.'' About 
11 p.m. that night, another wave rolled the boat, but this time it 
stayed upside down for four to five minutes. Matthews, who was on 
deck shift with Skeggs, said: ``I was trapped over the back of the 
boat in underneath the cockpit behind the aft lifelines. ``When the 
boat initially rolled I thought it would do like it did the first 
time and just pop back up again. So for the first 10 to 15 seconds 
I made no attempt to unhook my harness because I didn't want to leave 
the boat. ``Then when it stayed inverted I started to try to get my 
harness undone which I found really difficult even though I had the 
hooks on my chest because I was being pulled every which way and I 
was right at the end of the harness and I was using all my strength. 
``I had nearly run out of breath when the boat was lifted by another 
wave and I just sucked enough air to keep me going for another 10 
or 15 seconds, I don't know how long, and I forced the harness off. 
``Then the back of the boat was only two feet behind me and I popped 
to the surface and hung onto the ropes at the stern. I am the luckiest 
man alive.'' Skeggs, in a similar situation, could not free himself. 
Walker, Guy and the five other crew were below decks and upside down. 
``We heard Rob calling for Phil,'' Walker said. ``We didn't hear Phil 
answer and couldn't do anything. ``Then another huge wave righted 
the boat leaving about a meter of water below decks _ Bruce was beside 
the main hatchway,'' Walker said. ``As he tried to get up he had a 
(heart) seizure and died in my arms and I tried to keep him above 
the water.'' The shocked crew battened the boat down and rode the 
night out below decks. ``Below decks was horrendous,'' Walker said. 
``There was flotsam everywhere and the water was surging like being 
on a surf beach.'' About 3 am. more massive waves washed away the 
liferafts which had been lowered to one side of the boat. ``We were 
too exhausted to do anything about it,'' Walker said. ``Everyone was 
bashed and bruised.'' A search aircraft found them at 7.30 am. Monday 
and about half an hour later a helicopter winched the seven survivors 
to safety. The two bodies were secured on the boat and left. ``We 
didn't want to leave Phil and Bruce but we were glad to get off that 
boat,'' Walker said. The boat, with the two bodies aboard, was towed 
to shore on Wednesday. (djp)
