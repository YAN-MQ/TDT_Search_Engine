A county grand jury investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing produced 
one sealed indictment today. The jury rejected every conspiracy theory 
put before it, deciding the federal government had no prior knowledge 
of the bombing. The grand jury also found no credible evidence the 
attack was linked to white supremacists or foreign terrorists. 168 
people died in that bombing in April 1995.
