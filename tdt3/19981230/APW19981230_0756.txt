They have the same dynamic smile, the same knack for winning a major 
championship in unforgettable fashion. They both were trained in unorthodox 
manners by fathers obsessed with them becoming a champion. Se Ri Pak 
and Tiger Woods now share something else in common. Pak, the South 
Korean rookie who won two majors and took women's golf to its highest 
level of popularity in the United States in 20 years, on Tuesday was 
announced as The Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year in a 
poll of American sports writers and broadcasters in a close vote over 
Tennessee basketball star Chamique Holdsclaw. The award comes one 
year after Woods became the first golfer in 26 years to win the Male 
Athlete of the Year. ``Nineteen-ninety-eight is very special for me,'' 
Pak said. ``I cannot forget this season.'' Pak received 19 first-place 
votes and 156 points in voting by AP U.S. member newspaper and broadcast 
outlets. Holdsclaw, the top player on what many regard as the best 
American women's college basketball team ever, got 142 points. Tara 
Lipinski, who won the Olympic gold medal in figure skating, was third 
with 105 points. Sprinter and long jumper Marion Jones, undefeated 
in every event this year, was fourth with 101 points, followed by 
U.S. Open tennis champion Lindsay Davenport. Holdsclaw (27), Lipinksi 
(21) and Jones (24) all had more first-place votes than Pak, but Pak 
was named on 85 of the 147 ballots, far more than anyone else. Pak 
became the first golfer since Beth Daniel in 1990 to win Female Athlete 
of the Year, and the first rookie golfer since Nancy Lopez in 1978. 
Not since Lopez won five straight tournaments and nine events in her 
rookie season has women's golf exploded onto the front pages of American 
newspapers. ``What we could not have anticipated was the emergence 
of Se Ri Pak,'' said U.S. LPGA commissioner Jim Ritts. ``It was one 
of those stories that captured interest and imagination. It really 
elevated our visibility.'' Pak didn't pick up a club until she was 
14, but was trained like few others. While Earl Woods used to jingle 
coins in his pocket to teach his son focus, Jun-Chul Pak adopted more 
bizarre methods. He made Pak walk the stairs in their apartment forward 
and backward to build strength in her legs. He made her spend the 
night in a cemetery to help her conquer fear. And he took her to dog 
fights to make her mentally tough. ``People say I look focused,'' 
Pak said. ``Sometimes I don't have nice face. Sometimes poker face.''
