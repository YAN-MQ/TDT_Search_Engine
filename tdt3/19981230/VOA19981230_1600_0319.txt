U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is proposing that the Senate 
take its preliminary steps in the trial of President Clinton on January 
7th, one day after the new Senate convenes. The first day's proceedings 
will include a reading of the impeachment articles and adoption of 
a resolution on how to conduct the trial. The senators would be sworn 
in as jurors by Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
