While much of the world will ring in the new year tomorrow night, 
much of it won't. The Jewish new year happened back in September and 
the Chinese don't usher in a new year for another month or so. But 
some Chinese immigrants, including Stanley Whey say they can't wait 
to see the back of the year of the tiger. In Chinese, tiger, the word 
is phu, which is the same sound as bitterness. So we saw that the 
economy was collapsing or falling, especially in Far East and so forth. 
And next year will be a better year, the year of the rabbit. And we 
hope that, just like rabbits, people will be revitalized. And full 
of energy.
