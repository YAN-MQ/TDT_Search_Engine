The Indonesian military says 200 villagers in Western Akai province, 
some armed with machetes, have tortured and killed at least seven 
off-duty soldiers. Military officials said the assailants forced the 
victims to get off a bus on the northern tip of the Sumatra Island. 
Then they tortured and killed them. Some soldiers managed to escape 
and reported the incident. Hundreds of troops have been sent to the 
area to search for the killers and their victims' bodies. In Jakarta, 
the armed forces chief said 25 people who are suspected of provoking 
the mob attack have been arrested.
