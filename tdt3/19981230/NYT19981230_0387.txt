Harmer E. Davis, the founding director of the California Institute 
of Transportation Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, 
died on Dec. 24 at his home in Walnut Creek, Calif. He was 93. Davis 
spent 45 years on the Berkeley campus. He was born in Rochester, graduated 
from Berkeley in 1928, earned a master of science degree in civil 
engineering in 1930 and was appointed an assistant professor in that 
discipline the same year. Shortly after World War II, the state Legislature 
decreed the creation of the institute at Berkeley to train engineers 
needed to upgrade California's roads and airports. Davis was named 
as its director and led it until he retired in 1973. The program he 
developed combined research with teaching and left its mark on highway 
designs, traffic control, and airport layouts and lighting. His approach 
led other states to turn to academia for similar joint ventures. As 
director, he became involved in transportation issues around the country, 
especially in the areas of planning and financing highways and airports. 
His research focused on the engineering properties of concrete, asphalt 
and soils. Davis is survived by his wife, Phyllis E., a daughter and 
two sons from an earlier marriage, Lynn Davis of San Diego, Eugene 
of Union City, Calif., and Willard W. of Berkeley; a stepdaughter, 
Dr. Artha Shelley of Pretoria, South Africa; a stepson, Miguel Melbin 
of Calistoga, Calif.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
