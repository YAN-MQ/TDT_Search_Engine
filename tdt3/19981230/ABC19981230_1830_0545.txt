In California tonight, there is anger about a call for help that went 
badly wrong. It began with a young woman, stranded with a flat tire, 
and ended with her death at the hands of the police. ABC's Judy Muller 
is in Riverside, California, tonight. The shooting death of 19-year-old 
tyesha Miller has sparked outrage in river Riverside's African-American 
community. When you call for help, you're supposed to get 11 emergency, 
you're not supposed to call 911 and get shot up. Here's how it happened. 
Early Monday morning, tyesha called her cousins to come get her at 
a gas station where she was parked with a flat tire. They found her 
locked inside her car, apparently unconscious, with a Handgun on her 
lap. She was like shaking, it looked like something was wrong with 
her. She just didn't look normal to us. So the woman called 11 for 
an ambulance. Because of the presence of a gun the police responded 
first. A police car came, more came, they all got out and got their 
guns out. When the four officers failed to get a response from Miller, 
they decided to break the window. She awakened and went for her gun. 
At this point we haven't confirmed whether she fired a shot or not. 
But whatever she did, the officers responded with a volley of gunfire, 
at least 12 shots into the car. The four officers involved in the 
shooting have been placed on leave pending an investigation. This 
man is advising angry residents to stay calm until all the facts are 
known, including the officers' perspective. Someone has a gun, in 
a car, and it's dark, it's 2:00 in the morning. You're a police officer, 
and you break the window to open the car, someone reaches for the 
gun, you don't have a whole lot of time. Even so, says bardo, the 
police will have to explain to this a Ity why they responded with 
so much force to what was, initially, a call for help. Judy Muller,
