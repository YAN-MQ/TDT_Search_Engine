Well, in a lot of areas in the United States around this time of year, 
deer hunting season time, the conservation officials have to go through 
all kinds of peregrinations to try to track down people who are poaching 
or hunting illegally. Excuse me, Charlene. What was that pere what? 
Peregrinations, all kinds of who struck John, as my mother used to 
say, all kinds of activities to track down the poachers, yes. And 
in the state of New York, they come up - They've got this contraption 
called a Robo deer and what it is... I wasn't trying to make fun of 
you. That's all right, that's all right. Anything over three syllables, 
I have to get an explanation of. I know that. Sometimes my vocabulary 
just astounds you, doesn't it? yes. So let me tell you about this 
Robo deer, OK? First off, I like the whole idea of the thing, you 
know. It's this kind of mechanical robot deer that they put out there 
in the field, and what they're trying to do is get people to fire 
up on the thing in an illegal fashion and they nab them at it. And 
it's working. They've caught a number of people doing this. They use 
about 50 of them in various areas of the state. And of course the 
reason they're doing this is because property owners complain about 
the danger, the noise, the inconvenience posed by the illegal hunters 
in their neighborhoods. And so one hunter in Upstate New York was 
caught twice by taking a shot at the same Robo deer. He discharged 
his firearm across a public highway from his car, very illegal, and 
he was firing at the exact same decoy both times. He was arrested. 
I do like my peregrinations on ice, thank you.
