Good evening. Again tonight, depending on the location and final destination 
of millions of Americans this heavy travel holiday week. There's trouble 
in the air and on the roads. And even more of it, aloft and En route 
to causing trouble. The weather is a big story across the nation tonight. 
From west to east, region to region, there are power outages, roads 
and airports slowing down to a crawl and the threat of more on the 
way. We begin tonight with the very latest from NBC's Mike Boettcher. 
Carried by the jet stream, some unwelcome holiday travelers are moving 
east tonight across the U.S. -- snow, ice and cold. In Cleveland, 
traffic was an ice capade this morning. And I suddenly saw everybody 
braking away ahead. I said, I'd better slow down. I can't slow down. 
This is solid ice. oh, my god. Across the midwest, the last days of 
'98 turned bitter cold. Sub zero in Chicago. A white Christmas a few 
days late in Indianapolis. But we'll have a nice new year. Kansas 
road crews didn't stand by to admire the white blanket. They tore 
into it, hoping to prevent holiday traffic problems. The bone chilling 
sounds of winter -- -- echoed across Des Moines. New England is getting 
its first real snow of the year. And with Virginia expecting cold 
and flurries, its governor declared a State of emergency today. Power 
still hasn't been restored to 28,000 people after last week's major 
storm. In the place where bad weather first hit the U.S three days 
ago, the pacific northwest, the rain stopped. But flood waters lingered, 
posing a danger for man and a rescued pet Llama in Oregon. The Llama 
is okay, just cold and wet -- a feeling shared today from portland, 
Oregon, to Portland, Maine. Mike Boettcher, NBC news, Los Angeles.
