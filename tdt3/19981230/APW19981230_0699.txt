Four Germans taken captive by Yemeni tribesmen on Dec. 7 were set 
free on Wednesday, Yemeni security officials said. They said the four 
_ three women and a man _ were in good condition and were on their 
way to the Yemeni capital San`a. The officials spoke on customary 
condition of anonymity. There was no information on whether the government 
had agreed to the kidnappers' demands for better public services.
