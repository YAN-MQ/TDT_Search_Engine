The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec.31: ``Nobody 
wins in long, drawn-out divorce cases, not spouses and especially 
not the children who are caught in the middle,'' says New York State's 
Chief Judge, Judith Kaye. With that thought in mind, the judge has 
announced a series of practical changes intended to make the process 
of breaking up less adversarial. Of the approximately 60,000 divorces 
granted by New York courts each year, about 75 percent are uncontested. 
But the remaining ones that are contested can get messy. The new program 
builds on reforms Kaye introduced in 1993. Those reforms _ including 
the assignment of judges to concentrate on divorces _ have seen the 
average time it takes to process divorce cases in New York City drop 
from 854 days to 433, even as the annual number of divorce filings 
has increased by 12 percent. Now Kaye is focusing on the bitterest 
divorce cases and aiming for a more well-rounded approach. Adopting 
a practice already used successfully by most other states, the courts 
have begun offering classes to sensitize divorcing parents about the 
effect breakups can have on children. The idea is to provide a reality 
check that encourages early settlement of custody and visitation issues 
by warring parents. These classes, which are now offered on Long Island, 
in Westchester County and in two upstate cities, are to begin this 
month in New York City on a voluntary basis, with an eye to eventually 
making them mandatory statewide. In a similar vein, the court is expanding 
a promising pilot program that uses volunteer lawyers to provide the 
parties with a neutral evaluation of their disputes. This exercise, 
in which the risks and weaknesses of each side's case are exposed, 
injects a missing measure of legal reality that can help facilitate 
settlements. In another innovation, the court is hiring social workers 
with backgrounds in divorce and family law to help families settle 
disputes. Other sensible changes advocated by Kaye require the approval 
of the State Legislature. These include allowing a judge to freeze 
marital property to prevent parties from shifting or hiding assets, 
and mandatory disclosure of tax returns, bank statements and other 
key documents to expedite the discovery process and settlements. Good 
ideas frequently die in Albany's partisan atmosphere. But the chance 
to make divorces quicker and less traumatic for children should have 
appeal across party lines.
