You hear the term ringmaster thrown around a lot, but it only really 
describes one job. And while a lot of people have gone off to join 
the circus, few have ended up running the show, and making history 
in the process. Our report on the new man at the center of it all 
from NBC's Kerry Sanders. Ladies and gentlemen and children of all 
ages -- At ringling brothers and barnum & Bailey for the last 128 
years, the ringmasters who orchestrate all the acts and entertainment 
have always been white. Until now. The greatest show on earth -- Johnathan 
Lee Iverson, the 31st ringmaster in the circus' history, breaking 
all sorts of barriers. Well, I'm also the only ringmaster from New 
York City. Yeah! P.T. barnum learned long ago, to get crowds in the 
tent you've got to be spectacular . But ringling's chief executive 
says this is no act. Jonathan Lee Iverson is no stunt. You hear him 
speak, you hear him sing this guy is for real. Where everything is 
switched around Running away, and joining the circus. A little kid's 
dream. And for Johnathan Lee Iverson, this dream trip begins in the 
most unlikely of places. The boys choir of Harlem New York. At just 
11 years old, this son of a single mother joined the choir to stay 
out of trouble. When he was about 4 years old, he would put on his 
own shows, you know, it's always, "mama I've got to perform." And 
he would always say to me, "one day I'm going to be rich and famous. 
I'm going to travel all over the world." In the circus world, where 
hungarians perform next to Russians, who perform next to Chinese. 
The clowns say they think what makes Johnathan unique, his age. At 
just 22, he's the youngest ringmaster ever. He's black? I didn't even 
realize it. I though it was the lighting. I did too. I need to check 
on that. Just look at the show. It's the most diverse show in the 
world. That's what makes it the greatest show on earth. a $12 million 
extravaganza -- 132 performers, 217 animals, all of it directed by 
Johnathan Lee Iverson. In the center ring, on a tight rope of his 
own. Kerry Sanders, NBC news, Tampa.
