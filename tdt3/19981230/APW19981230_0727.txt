The Russian Interior Ministry logged more than 40,000 complaints of 
police brutality in 1998, and more than 5,000 led to disciplinary 
action against police, the government said Wednesday. Sergei Shadrin, 
deputy chief of the ministry's Internal Security Department, said 
2,800 cases of brutality were sent to prosecutors and criminal proceedings 
were instituted in 1,347 cases, ITAR-Tass reported. The report did 
not say how many led to convictions. Another top official, Vladimir 
Fyodorov of the road police, said corruption remained a serious problem 
among police who patrol Russia's roads. Most Russian motorists would 
agree. He said there were more than 7,300 anti-corruption operations 
launched against road police in 1998, leading to disciplinary action 
against 2,944 officers and criminal procedings against 53. Also, he 
said, 66 were punished for bribery and five for extortion. ``We realize 
this is only the tip of the iceberg,'' Fyodorov said, according to 
ITAR-Tass.
