An eye doctor has been executed for killing and dismembering a police 
official who had an affair with his wife in what newspapers called 
one of southern China's most gruesome murders. Yang Li was taken to 
the execution grounds in Zhenjiang city on Tuesday and shot, the state-run 
Yangcheng Evening News reported Tuesday. His wife, Gao Yuechun, was 
given a 15-year prison sentence for helping him, the newspaper said. 
The two were originally convicted a year ago, but the newspaper gave 
no reason for the delay in carrying out the sentence. Although appeals 
are automatic when death sentences are issued, they are usually quick 
and rarely change the lower court verdict. The couple were both eye 
doctors at a Zhenjiang hospital. Newspapers previously gave the following 
account of the crime: On New Year's Day of 1997, Yang learned from 
Gao that she was having an affair with He Long, deputy head of a branch 
of the city police department. Two days later, Yang had Gao lured 
He to their home. Yang then used a cleaver to kill He, and the couple 
butchered and cooked his remains.
