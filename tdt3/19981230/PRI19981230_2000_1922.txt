Italy has -- a controversial plan to protect Venice from winter floods. 
The so-called Moses Engineering Project would have cost $2.5 million. 
David Willey reports. This schemed involved a construction of huge 
mobile steel and rubber barriers which would have been lowered to 
block off the Venice lagoon in case of freak high tides. The government 
has now decided that a series of coordinated measures must first be 
taken to clean up the lagoon in which Venice is situated. The level 
of the pavements of walkways in the center of Venice is to be raised 
and the canals which form the city's streets are to be better dredged. 
The government also wants to have another look at the latest forecasts 
of the likely effects up on Venice of global warming. David Willey,
