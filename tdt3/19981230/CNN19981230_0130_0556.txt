The Kaiser foundation health plan says it will keep paying for the 
anti-impotence drug Viagra. This, after a settlement reached with 
California state regulators. Authorities began investigating Kaiser 
last summer after the HMO refused to cover Viagra, saying it was too 
expensive. The state says as long as a doctor prescribes the drug, 
the company must cover it. The settlement doesn't affect Kaiser's 
pending request for permission to drop coverage for all types of sexual 
dysfunction treatments.
