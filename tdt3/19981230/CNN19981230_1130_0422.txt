A published report says most states are meeting the work requirement 
of the 1996 welfare to work law. According to "the New York Times," 
28% of adults on welfare across the country also worked last year. 
Under the welfare law, states can be fined if 25% of their welfare 
families don't work or actively prepare themselves for work. By 2002, 
the requirement rises to 50%.
