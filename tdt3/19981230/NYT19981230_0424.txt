The New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square on Thursday night will 
be patrolled by the largest police detail in the city's history, as 
officials test crowd control efforts they expect to use next year 
on an unprecedented crush of revelers. The Police Department said 
on Wednesday that it would deploy 5,000 officers, a 25 percent increase 
over last year, to keep watch over the half-million people expected 
to squeeze behind barricades to watch the ball descend from One Times 
Square on Thursday night. Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the 
department would use ``some resources we haven't used in the past, 
just to see how they work. ``We know that next year we are going to 
have the largest crowd in history,'' he said. Safir would not discuss 
the crowd control measures in detail, but he said he believed that 
the bolstered police presence would be both a useful preparation and 
necessary precaution, because the Times Square crowd has grown in 
each of the last two years. This year, the throng may balloon even 
larger, because party planners have arranged to place three video 
screens _ two more than last year _ in and around Times Square so 
more people can watch the ball's descent. To make room for the revelers, 
the police said they planned to shut much of midtown to traffic, beginning 
at 6 p.m. in Times Square, and radiating out as the crowd builds. 
Judging from last year's experience, Safir said he anticipates that 
by midnight, the police might have to close the area from 34th Street 
to 60th Street between Fifth and Eighth Avenues. ``Public transportation 
is the best advice,'' he said, ``and don't bring alcohol, because 
it won't make it to Times Square.'' Police officials said officers 
stationed on the streets and at major bus and train stations would 
confiscate open containers of alcohol, plastic coolers and hip flasks. 
No alcohol, even unopened bottles or cans, will be allowed near Times 
Square, and those found drinking will be issued a summons and have 
the alcohol confiscated, said Lt. Sean Crowley, a department spokesman. 
The police also plan to set up checkpoints around the five boroughs 
to try to catch drunken drivers, Safir said.
