Miners from the Solidarity union on Wednesday further suspended their 
protest and gave the union-rooted government until the end of March 
to produce a bill guaranteeing them early retirement privileges. The 
protest that involved several hundred miners taking part in underground 
sit-ins at some 50 mines in southern Poland was originally suspended 
Dec. 23, after the government promised miners would retain early retirement 
schemes. Union leaders said the protest will continue under the form 
of meetings and rallies. The sit-in could be resumed ``as soon as 
the government tries to go back on its promises,'' said Henryk Nakonieczny, 
head of miner's Solidarity. Under an agreement reached last week, 
the government proposed miners would receive so-called ``bridge'' 
pensions of 70 percent of their monthly wages if they retire with 
25 years of service before the legal age. They would receive the regular 
full pension when they reach the legal retirement age. Miners want 
the provision guaranteed in a bill later next year that will spell 
out details of retirement rules for miners and workers employed in 
dangerous conditions. On Tuesday, President Aleksander Kwasniewski 
signed into law the new pension system, in line with Western standards, 
that sets retirement age at 65 for men and 60 for women, but Nakonieczny 
said it did not affect the miners, who trust the agreement with the 
government.
