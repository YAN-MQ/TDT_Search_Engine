When champagne flows New Year's Eve, those sparkling, heady bubbles 
may owe their origin as much to computer chips as to yeast and sugar. 
Don't worry _ winemakers will still taste at strategic points as grapes 
turn themselves into champagne or chardonnay or sauvignon blanc. There 
are still some things even the most talented circuit can't do. But 
microprocessors have definitely invaded the vineyard. Digital images 
taken from 15,000 feet above the vineyards of the Napa Valley in California 
help spot properly ripening grapes. Computer-controlled cages can 
rotate hundreds of bottles of sparkling wine far more efficiently 
than any human, neatly collecting sediment for removal while preserving 
all those tiny bubbles. Computers are now in the sky above California's 
vines and in the earth below, in the fermentation tanks and even on 
the presses that gently squeeze the grapes. Throughout California, 
computer technology is being adopted by wineries like Beringer Vineyards, 
a large winery in St. Helena, where Ed Sbragia, the winemaker, uses 
a laptop to check the temperature of the fermentation tanks, and Cakebread 
Cellars, a small family-owned winery in Rutherford, which is developing 
an online library. ``Winemakers like to preserve the image of handcrafted 
wine, where people hop into the barrels and crush the grapes with 
their feet,' said James Laube, the author of ``California Wine'' (Wine 
Spectator Press, 1995) and a senior editor at Wine Spectator magazine. 
``In fact, computers are absolutely involved in the producing of excellent 
wines, whether they are on the presses or monitoring the fermentation 
tanks.'' Larger companies like Beringer and Mondavi rely on technology 
in part because they are dealing with so many grapes. ``A mom-and-pop 
operation where the owners walk through their 10 acres of grapes has 
less need of computers,'' Laube said. Most of all, technology has 
helped eliminate flawed wines with less desirable characteristics. 
``The computer has helped people become better grape growers and better 
winemakers, and the result is better wine,'' Laube said. ``Ten to 
15 years ago, a much more variable quality of wine was being made. 
Today there are very few defective wines, a huge upside for consumers.'' 
Jack Cakebread and his sons Dennis and Bruce are using an online library 
so their growers, scattered up and down the valley, can check and 
compare moisture, pruning and tasting records, even if some of them 
have to borrow their children's computers to do it. ``Wine is about 
taste,'' Bruce Cake-bread said. ``Computer technology, particularly 
in irrigation management, can help make the wine taste better.'' Cakebread 
looks after the flavor of his wine in part with the help of a neutron 
probe, a hand-size device with a built-in radioactive source that 
measures soil moisture during the growing season. If a lot of water 
is percolating through the soil, neutrons will be slowed by collisions 
with the hydrogen atoms in the water. The device measures the number 
of slowed neutrons, a reliable indication of moisture. Of course, 
not every winemaker has a laptop in the tasting room. At Ridge Vineyards 
in the Santa Cruz Mountains above Cupertino, Calif., for instance, 
no computer is permitted to monitor the temperature of the winery's 
complex, highly regarded reds as they ferment in their stainless-steel 
tanks. ``We measure the temperature by hand,'' said Paul Draper, who 
has been the winemaker at Ridge for 29 years.
