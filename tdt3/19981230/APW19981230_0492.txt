Westerners freed after a shootout fatal to four foreign tourists said 
Wednesday that the battle started when Yemeni security forces attacked 
Islamic radicals holding the foreigners hostage. Their accounts appeared 
to contradict a Yemeni government statement, which said security forces 
only opened fire Tuesday after the kidnappers began killing some of 
their hostages at a camp in the country's south. But the hostages 
told The Associated Press that once their kidnappers were attacked, 
they tried to use their prisoners as shields and eventually shot two 
of the captives in ``revenge killings'' as they fled. ``The worst 
time for me was that time when a barrel was pointed at my chest. I 
said, `No, no, no,'' recounted Erik Firkin, who said a fellow captive, 
a woman, was shot dead in front of him by one of the kidnappers.
