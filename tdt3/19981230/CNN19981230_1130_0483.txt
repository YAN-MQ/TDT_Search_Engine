I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Bitterly cold Arctic air continues to funnel in through the midwest, 
dropping temperatures and will be moving into the east today behind 
the arctic front. By late tomorrow, we are looking for high pressure 
to be centered in the midwest. That will continue to bring the cold 
temperatures in, while the northwest has another storm system set 
to move inland. That will keep things stormy in much of the northwest. 
Forecast temperatures today are again below zero for highs in parts 
of northern Minnesota and into North Dakota. Single-digit readings 
cover the western Great Lakes, while we watch the colder air even 
funneling into the southeast. A look now at the extended forecast 
-- on Friday, we expect a storm to develop back through the plains. 
That will spread snow through the central and northern plains. Rain 
and thunderstorms further to the south. Temperatures will be on the 
cool side over much of the northern U.S. as we head into Saturday, 
could see significant snows over parts of the midwest, as low pressure 
moves up towards the Ohio river valley. Rain and thunderstorms along 
the gulf coast. Snow is expected through much of the Great Lakes during 
the day on Sunday. For more weather information, log into CNN.com.
