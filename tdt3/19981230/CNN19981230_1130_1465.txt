They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder and one web site lets 
you decide what is art and what is not. That's in this edition of 
"what's online." Preponderance there is plenty to see in this virtual 
gallery. But is it art? The curator says it is and appallingly bad 
art at that. Www.badart.com is the product of a nationwide search 
for great examples of "Gone awry." This one is a still life of bread, 
an ear of corn and an apple. How about this charmer? Here's something 
you won't see in every art gallery. Nuns on a carousel. This one doesn't 
seem so bad until you look at the eyes and realize they are black 
holes. The curator says this is the most hideous he's ever seen. There 
are dogs, cats, most domestic and wild and horses. Even Mickey mouse 
makes an appearanceance. Visit krn.com/online for links to this and 
other sites.
