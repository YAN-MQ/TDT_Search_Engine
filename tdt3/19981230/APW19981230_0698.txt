Ugandan rebels raided a town in the north of that country, killing 
three people, kidnapping up to 40 and stealing supplies, the Italian 
missionary news service said Wednesday. The news service, Misna, cited 
missionary sources in the central African country. The Lord's Resistance 
Army carried out the attack on the town of Morulem on Tuesday night, 
Misna said. It sacked missionaries' buildings and the clinic of a 
missionary-run lepers' hospital, the news service said. Women and 
children were among the residents abducted, the news service said. 
While the adults may have been taken simply to carry the loot, missionaries 
feared the young people had been taken to serve as slaves, it said. 
The Lord's Resistance Army is waging a 12-year-old insurgency in northwestern 
Uganda. Its fighters frequently abduct children and teen-agers to 
carry their goods, fight their skirmishes, and provide them with sex.
