Rebel forces Wednesday launched an hour-long artillery bombardment 
against Huambo, the country's second-largest city and a base for United 
Nations and aid agency staff, according to reports. Some shells landed 
in downtown areas of the central highland city which lies about 500 
kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda, state radio 
RNA reported from Huambo. The explosions reportedly began at noon 
and caused panic among local people in the government-held city which 
the army is using as a base to fly in reinforcements for fighting 
in surrounding areas. Before the civil war restarted Dec. 4 Huambo 
had a population of about 300,000, but tens of thousands of refugees 
fleeing fighting in the countryside have converged on the city in 
recent weeks. U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said from Luanda he had 
no reports of injuries to United Nations staff in Huambo. The World 
Food Program and International Red Cross also have staff in the city, 
but officials were not immediately available for comment. A cargo 
plane chartered by the United Nations crashed near Huambo on Saturday 
with 14 people on board. The cause of the crash, as the plane passed 
over the war zone, was not known. Artillery shells were also landing 
about every 15 minutes in Kuito, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the 
east of Huambo, which has been under a rebel siege for more than two 
weeks, according to RNA. The rebels apparently were targeting the 
airport, RNA said. The United Nations observer mission, which is monitoring 
a 1994 peace accord that halted a two-decade civil war between the 
rebels and the government, has been unable to stop the renewed fighting 
which so far been concentrated in the central highlands. The U.N. 
Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for the return to war. 
UNITA refused to yield control of areas under its control and maintained 
a hidden army, according to the United Nations. The country has been 
ravaged by conflict since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975.
