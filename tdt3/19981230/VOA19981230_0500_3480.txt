From time to time you'll hear us talking about auctions of famous 
things, famous celebrity clothes and what have you, like the slippers 
from "The Wizard of Oz." Remember that, Charlene? Oh, yeah. ... several 
months ago. Oh, yeah. What, $12,000 I think they bought - I don't 
know. Something like that. But at a recent auction in London, now 
get this, a postcard written by a 16-year-old passenger on the Titanic 
went for more than $24,000. The slightly water stained postcard was 
written by a passenger named Edith Brown and addressed to her stepsister 
in South Africa, but she never mailed it. Ms. Brown had it with her 
in 1912 when she jumped from the sinking ocean liner onto a lifeboat. 
She eventually hand delivered the postcard to her stepsister. Who 
bought it? Well, it was the owner of a shipping services company in 
Belfast, Northern Ireland. Belfast just happened to be where the Titanic 
was built.
