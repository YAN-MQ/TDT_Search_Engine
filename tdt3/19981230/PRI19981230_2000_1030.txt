But that's not the most peculiar thing going on this new year's. We 
felt we had to mention the colored underwear tradition that, quite 
literally, spans the globe. In Europe, Italians and Croatians have 
been rushing to stores to stock up on red underwear, trusting an old 
belief that wearing something red on December 31st ensures good luck 
for the coming year. Our source in Puerto Rico tells us that, there 
it's yellow underwear that's lucky, not red. We can't vouch for the 
other islanders' preferences.
