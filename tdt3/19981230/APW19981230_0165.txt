Of the top 20 players on the PGA Tour money list, no one played as 
many tournaments as Hal Sutton. He entered 30 events, and never took 
more than a two-week break. Even when he was home, his clubs were 
not far away. Why? Given the arduous climb from rock bottom of his 
career, Sutton is driven by fear of another slide, something he can't 
afford at age 40. ``When I have two or three days in a row that I 
don't have anything to do, that worries me,'' Sutton said recently 
during a telephone interview. ``When the weather gets bad and I don't 
play, I worry about that. I don't like taking golf for granted. I've 
worked too hard.'' And it has paid off. Sutton is coming off his best 
season since 1983, when he won The Players Championship and the PGA 
Championship, led the money list and was christened as the next Jack 
Nicklaus. After a slump so deep he had to use a one-time exemption 
to keep his card, he won the Texas Open and the Tour Championship 
and finished fifth on the money list with $1.8 million. ``It made 
me appreciate being able to get back,'' he said. Sutton compares his 
resurgence to someone who has lost a lot of weight. ``When you go 
to the trouble to do that, you're aware of what you've been doing,'' 
he said. ``You've paid the price, and you're not going to eat a piece 
of pie because it's there.'' Should there be another major in store 
for Sutton this year _ and his win at the Tour Championship certainly 
proved he's capable of that _ 11 career victories would include two 
majors, The Players Championship and the Tour Championship. ``I'm 
going to set lofty goals and do things I haven't done before,'' Sutton 
said. ``I haven't won a Ryder Cup, but I want to make another team. 
My game hasn't been such that I was a factor in any major championships, 
and I had some decent majors in the midst of all of this. So that's 
a focal point in my mind.'' Sutton has not played since the Shark 
Shootout. He made the Presidents Cup team, but withdrew when his father-in-law 
died of a heart attack. His next tournament will be the Mercedes Championships, 
but he's likely to throttle back on his schedule early next year. 
His wife Ashley, pregnant with twins, is due the first of the year. 
___ REVISIONIST MONTY: Even though he has won the European money title 
a record six straight years, the knock on Colin Montgomerie is that 
he has never won a major and never won on American soil. The Scotsman 
can't deny he is 0-for-30 in the majors, but he counts at least one 
victory in the United States _ his victory at the Andersen Consulting 
World Championship of Golf last January in Scottsdale, Ariz. He also 
won individual honors at the World Cup of Golf, a team event, at Kiawah 
Island, S.C. in November 1997. ``The win at the Andersen Consulting 
event was important to me because it represented my first big individual 
win in the States,'' Montgomerie wrote in a column for Golfweb. ``And 
it was all the more important because I was able to beat golfers like 
Ernie Els and Davis Love III in the process.'' Still, he advanced 
to the semifinals by winning three matches in the European division 
at Buckinghamshire Golf Club in England. Also, the Andersen field 
was 32 players, eight of those from Japan. But when Montgomerie looks 
back on 1998, his highlights include three wins in Europe, leading 
the Order of Merit and ``a season in which I won for the first time 
on American soil.'' ``While I didn't win a major, nothing happened 
which suggests that I can't go on to win one sometime in the future,'' 
he added. ___ MAJOR ODDS: According to a London bookmaker, Tiger Woods 
is the clear favorite to win the four major championships in 1999. 
Ladbrokes lists Woods' odds of winning the Masters at 5-1, the U.S. 
Open at 8-1 and both the British Open and the PGA Championship at 
9-1. No one else was listed at better than 14-1 in any of the majors. 
In fact, only David Duval, Lee Westwood and two-time U.S. Open champion 
Ernie Els had odds better than 20-1 in any major. Duval, the leading 
money-winner on the PGA Tour, is listed at 14-1 to win the Masters 
and 16-1 in the other three, while Els was 14-1 to win the British 
Open and 16-1 in the Masters, U.S. Open and PGA. Westwood's odds are 
14-1 in the U.S. Open, 16-1 in the Masters and PGA and 20-1 in the 
British Open. Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara is a 
25-1 favorite to win any of the American majors, and 33-1 to win the 
British Open. Greg Norman, who missed most of last year after shoulder 
surgery, is listed at 33-1 to win the Masters or U.S. Open and 40-1 
to win either the British Open or PGA. ___ DIVOTS: The next time Annika 
Sorenstam is featured in Sports Illustrated, it won't be in the Golf 
Plus section. The Swede will be in next year's swimsuit issue, in 
a section devoted to famous athletes modeling the latest swimming 
attire. ... Jim Furyk will also turn into a model, although not swimsuits. 
He has signed a three-year deal to represent the Johnnie Walker Collection, 
a casual menswear line introduced in October, and will appear in its 
advertising next year. ... Se Ri Pak donated $30,000 to the LPGA Foundation 
for its Urban Youth Golf Program. It was the largest single donation 
by an LPGA player to the program. ___ STAT OF THE WEEK: Allen Doyle 
won the medalist honors at Q-school for the PGA Tour and the Senior 
PGA Tour _ just two years apart. ___ FINAL WORD: ``He tried really 
hard and he was grinding to the end.'' _ Annika Sorenstam on her husband, 
David Esch, who turned pro to play the mixed-team JC Penney Classic. 
They finished 50th in a 52-team field.
