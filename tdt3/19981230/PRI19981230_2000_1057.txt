In the days of the Soviet Union, new year celebrations were a much 
more political affair. Christmas was banned and so New Year's came 
to be encouraged, in part, as a distraction from the Christian holiday, 
says Arena Schumavitz of the BBC's Russian Service. For nearly 20 
years, they were virtually no winter celebrations in the whole country 
and that was until 1935 when a Ukrainian Communist whose name was 
Peter Postishow criticized people who associated the tradition of 
a fir tree at Christmas as a bourgeois tradition and he called to 
organize a great Soviet New Year's tree as a waste of Christmas tree 
for Soviet children and also it citizens in collective farms. And 
so, it came to be, by order.
