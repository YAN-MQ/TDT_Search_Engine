Italian ski great Alberto Tomba kissed his fans goodbye in an emotional 
farewell race at his favorite course Wednesday night, showing he still 
had what it takes on the Alpine circuit. The 32-year-old Italian ace, 
who announced his retirement last October, finished ahead of world 
champion Michael Von Gruenigen and other World Cup stars in a short 
three-run giant slalom exhibition under floodlight, carrying away 
thousands of fans who dared a foggy and snowy night to attend Tomba's 
last race. Tomba joked about a possible comeback at the 1999 World 
Championships in Vail, Colorado, saying ``maybe.'' But he quickly 
added that he had plans other than skiing in his future. ``It's over 
for me, on skis,'' he said. ``I gave a lot, perhaps too much ... I 
no longer have motivations. I won everything .... After 15 years on 
the World Cup circuit I was really sick.'' The skier from Bologna, 
internationally known as ``La Bomba'' (the Bomb) because of his powerful 
style between the slalom gates, recently started an acting career 
playing the role of a special corps policeman nicknamed Alex the Ram. 
Tomba threw kisses to his supporters, shook hands and was carried 
shoulder-on by his past rivals after he placed third, behind Paul 
Accola and Patrick Holzer, in the exhibition through 20 gates. Tomba 
clocked the fastest time in the first run but finished third overall, 
0.12 behind the Swiss winner, who pocketed a first prize of dlrs 28,000. 
Von Gruenigen, who won the world giant slalom title at Sestriere in 
1997, finished behind Tomba by one hundredth of a second. Slovenian 
Jure Kosir placed fifth. Tomba, who won the first of 50 World Cup 
races in this Italian resort in 1987, had contested his last World 
Cup slalom in Crans Montana last March when he capped his sensational 
career with a victory. ``They let the granddad make the podium for 
the last time,'' Tomba said smiling at the finish line before being 
mobbed by fans who chanted his name and played horns. ``I made wonders 
in the first run, despite cramps and untested skis. I was tense because 
so many people had come here to celebrate me.'' Tomba said he only 
trained three days for his farewell race, at the site where he won 
six World Cup races between 1987 and 1995.
