Another nutty idea on the streets of Japan these days looks and feels 
like a beeper, but instead of reminding employees to call the office, 
the love getty sends out a digital mating call, alerting anyone nearby 
with a companion device of your availability. Spokesman Takia Takafujii 
explains that there are male and female versions of the beeper when, 
say, a woman activates her love getty and a love getty -bearing male 
wanders into her radius, their beepers literally go bizerk. Takafujii 
says he sold over 1 million love getty's, so far, not only to trendsetting 
teens, but also to businessmen, secretaries and even adventure-seeking 
housewives. He says the idea popped up over tea a few years ago. The 
idea came from a friend of mine. He said, wouldn't it be great if 
men and women could communicate their feelings electronically. We 
decided it was a hit and made it into a product. Picking up dates 
via beeper might seem a product limited to Japan where relations between 
the sexes are still tame, by Western standards. But the latent demand 
overseas for electronically assisted romance apparently is vast and 
waiting to be tapped, says love getty spokesman Takafujii. Since the 
wire services did a story on us, the reaction from around the world 
has been huge. We got tons of inquiries asking about exports, so I 
guessed it'll sell anywhere. I was very surprised. In case you're 
wondering, love getty is set to go on sale in the U.S. early next 
year.
