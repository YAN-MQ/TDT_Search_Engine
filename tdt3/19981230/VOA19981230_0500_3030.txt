The market is only one piece of good U.S. economic news. Despite a 
slight slip in November, consumer confidence remains high. Sales of 
existing homes are on course for a 13 percent increase this year over 
last. But 1999's economic growth rate is expected to be a bit different, 
so predicts Paul Taylor, senior economist at America's Community Bankers. 
We're expecting about two percent reel at America's Community Bankers. 
That's why we need to be strong enough to continue both refi activity 
and mortgage origination. But slower growth, particularly in our exporting 
sectors next year as the difficulties of Asia continue to erode market 
share of American producers. Mr. Taylor says inflation should remain 
relatively under control, around 1.8 percent.
