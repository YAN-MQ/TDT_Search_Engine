With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
More wet weather is expected on new year's eve for the pacific northwest, 
with considerable amounts of mountain snowfall. There will also be 
a developing storm system across the four corners as we head into 
January 1st, 1999. It also could be a day when we could see ferocious 
snow across the central section of the U.S. we'll have to wait and 
see how that develops. As far as temperatures are concerned, the coldest 
readings wrapped around the Great Lakes. Mildest -- south Florida, 
south Texas and into the desert southwest. Into Honolulu, look for 
expected high temperature under partly cloudy skies of 80 degrees. 
Look for around 85 in San Juan. The snow is going to fly on Friday. 
Through Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma, and across the northern great 
plains. And then by Saturday, heavy snow is forecast across the midwest 
and central Mississippi river valley. And then by Sunday, look for 
wind and rain in the northeast and more showers for the pacific northwest. 
Single digits across the great plains. For more weather information,
