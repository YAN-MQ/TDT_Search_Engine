President Clinton is getting an early start to the holiday weekend. 
He and wife Hillary and first dog buddy left Washington today for 
Hilton head, South Carolina. They'll attend the "renaissance weekend" 
in their annual new year's tradition. The closed-door invitation-only 
event is a gathering of movers and shakers in science, religion, politics 
and other fields. The first family has been attending the gatherings 
for more than a decade.
