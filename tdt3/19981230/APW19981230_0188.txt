Troops killed 10 Kurdish rebels in clashes in southeastern Turkey, 
authorities announced Wednesday. The clashes between the Turkish army 
and rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, took place in the 
provinces of Diyarbakir and Batman. Authorities did not say when the 
fighting took place. Despite pledges to end violence by PKK leader 
Abdullah Ocalan, fighting continues in the southeast, where the rebels 
have been waging a 14-year-old war for autonomy. Ocalan was detained 
in Rome last month. Turkey, which holds him responsible for the deaths 
of tens of thousands of people, wants him extradited for trial on 
terrorism charges, but Italy says it cannot extradite him because 
Turkey has the death penalty. On Tuesday, the National Security Council, 
which includes Turkey's top civilian and military leaders, reiterated 
its determination to fight the PKK.
