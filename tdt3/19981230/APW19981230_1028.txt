Authorities have arrested a man in connection with what they described 
as a ``psychotic, sexual maniac'' in connection with the murders of 
dozens of children whose remains were found last month. ``We may be 
looking at one of those responsible in the case of the disappearances 
and deaths of the children of Pereira,'' Pedro Gonzalez, chief investigator 
of the federal prosecutor's office told a news conference on Wednesday. 
The skeletons and decomposing corpses of 25 children were discovered 
in November at the bottom of a ravine and scattered about a city lot 
in the state capital, located 110 miles (175 kilometers) west of Bogota. 
Gonzalez identified the man captured Dec. 16, in Pereira by two names, 
Pedro Pablo Ramirez or Carlos Alberto Arboleda, and described him 
as a prior sexual offender. Investigators have linked the man to at 
least two killing of children in Pereira, and possibly those of three 
other children, Gonzalez said. ``We can't attribute all of the cases 
to this person, and we have to continue the investigation,'' he said. 
Investigators had ruled out early theories that the murders were the 
work of a satanic cult or linked to the sale of organs. ``It was a 
depraved, psychotic, sexual maniac who does these things because he 
has sexual abnormalities,'' said Gonzalez.
