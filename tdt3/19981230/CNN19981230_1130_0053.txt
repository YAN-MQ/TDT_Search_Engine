U.S. fighter pilots have responded again to what they call an "unprovoked 
attack" by the Iraqis. U.S. and British military officials tell CNN, 
Iraq fired at British planes patrolling the southern no-fly zone. 
A similar incident occurred in the northern no-fly zone Monday. U.S. 
aircraft reported no resistance during their patrol in that area this 
morning. A U.S. commander says retaliation for this morning's show 
of force was swift and damaging. We did have an incident early this 
morning. We had coalition aircraft flying, operation southern watch 
missions. They detected a launch of approximately six to eight surface-to-air 
missiles from an area southwest of talil, in Iraq. The aircraft took 
some evasive action and we responded to this unprovoked attack by 
firing harm missiles and several GBUs, 500-pound precision bombs or 
munitions. Radiation missiles fired from the air to those ground radar 
sites, dropped a number of 500-pound precision guided bombs. The U.S. 
and British aircraft returned to base safely. No injuries on the coalition 
side. They are currently doing a damage assessment. That's taken from 
a cockpit video that watches the missiles and bombs. The Pentagon 
is confident they hit at least some of the military targets in southern 
Iraq.
