Meanwhile, in Congo-Brazzaville, Army troops have clashed again with 
militia men loyal to the country's former prime minister. Reports 
from Brazzaville say the clashes occurred Monday and Tuesday in an 
area southwest of the capital. VOA's John Pittman has more from our 
West Africa bureau. The latest fighting between Army troops and the 
former militia men was centered around two towns about 20 kilometers 
southwest of the capital, Brazzaville. Reports from Brazzaville say 
militia men loyal to former Prime Minister Bernard Colelas clashed 
several times with the Army on Monday and Tuesday in the Gongalingolo 
and Linzolo districts. The violence reportedly included an ambush 
by the militia men who are known as the Ninjas on an Army convoy. 
According to unnamed government sources quoted by foreign news agencies 
in Brazzaville, the Army troops used mortars and armored vehicles 
against the Ninjas and eventually chased them into the nearby hills. 
The sources say the Ninjas may have taken a number of civilians hostage 
during their retreat. However, this claim has not been independently 
verified. John Pittman, VOA News, West Africa bureau.
