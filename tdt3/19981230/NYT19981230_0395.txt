The federal government took a big step toward redefining the Internet 
Wednesday when the Justice Department approved the proposed $31.8 
billion acquisition of the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. by 
AT&AMP;T. The deal, announced in June, still cannot be closed without 
the consent of the Federal Communications Commission, whose officials 
said Wednesday that the agency's staff was still more than a month 
away from finishing its review under different standards and laws 
from those considered by the Justice Department. After the staff review 
and recommendations, the five commissioners would have to decide whether 
the deal is in the public interest or, as critics have argued, it 
would give AT&AMP;T the power to sharply limit access to the Internet 
to other telephone companies and access providers. Nonetheless, Wednesday's 
decision by antitrust regulators removed a significant potential obstacle 
and moved the two companies closer to becoming a vast new telecommunications 
conglomerate. That conglomerate would offer a big new artery of higher-speed 
access to the Internet that the companies' executives say would enable 
computer users to transfer data more easily, hold clearer conversations 
and eventually receive TV-quality video. In a separate regulatory 
action, the Federal Trade Commission approved the $52.4 billion acquisition 
of Amoco by British Petroleum PLC. The agreement announced Wednesday 
with the Justice Department was not without conditions. Because both 
AT&AMP;T and TCI hold substantial interests in wireless telephone 
services, officials approved the deal only on the condition that TCI 
divest its interests in that business. The company will have five 
years to sell its 23.5 percent interest in Sprint PCS, one of the 
nation's leading providers of digital wireless telephone service. 
Antitrust officials had raised concerns that the proposed merger could 
affect the price of wireless service because AT&AMP;T, with about 
9 million customers, is the nation's largest provider. ``In the past 
few years, increased competition in mobile wireless services has produced 
lower prices, higher quality and millions of new subscribers,'' said 
Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice 
Department's antitrust division. ``The settlement reached today will 
insure that the merger will not blunt the move toward a more competitive 
market in wireless services and that customers continue to reap the 
benefits of that competition.'' Under the agreement with the Justice 
Department, if the deal closes before TCI divests its interest in 
Sprint, then the Sprint stock must be placed in a trust until it is 
sold. Executives at AT&AMP;T and TCI have said the merger will enable 
consumers to get one-stop shopping for their local and long-distance 
telephone service, cable TV, and access to the Internet and data services. 
TCI and its affiliated systems reach more than 14 million customers 
representing about one-third of the nation's homes. Since the breakup 
of the Bell telephone network in 1984, AT&AMP;T has not had direct 
access to most homes. But the proposed deal with TCI, made possible 
by the sweeping deregulation of the telecommunications industry two 
years ago, would change that. James Cicconi, AT&AMP;T's general counsel, 
said the decision was good news for consumers. ``We are now one step 
closer to finalizing a transaction that will ultimately give residential 
customers broader choices for local telephone service and other advanced 
services and products,'' Cicconi said. ``We think it is especially 
significant that the only subject of today's consent decree is the 
ownership interest TCI currently holds in the cellular business of 
Sprint.'' But other telephone companies have maintained that the deal 
is fundamentally anticompetitive. They have expressed fears that it 
will prevent them from using TCI's lines to offer access to the internet. 
That issue is now one of the central ones before the FCC. The AT&AMP;T-TCI 
deal is one of three large proposed mergers in the telecommunications 
industry that are awaiting approval from regulators in Washington 
and a variety of states. Officials are also considering SBC Communications' 
$56 billion purchase of Ameritech and Bell Atlantic's $52 billion 
purchase of GTE.
