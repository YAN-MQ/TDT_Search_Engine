North Korea warned Wednesday it may suspend South Korean tours to 
a scenic mountain on its east coast because of a delay in payment 
for the project. ``The Kumkang Mountain tour ... is now facing a grave 
obstacle,'' the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency said 
in a commentary, threatening a possible suspension of the project. 
About 10,000 South Koreans have visited Kumkang (Diamond) Mountain 
since Hyundai, South Korea's largest business conglomerate, launched 
the unprecedented sightseeing cruise tours Nov. 18. The tourism deal, 
the largest joint venture between the divided Koreas, called for Hyundai 
to pay dlrs 948 million to North Korea over the next six years in 
return for the rights to organize the tours and develop the mountain 
as a major resort park. The first batch of dlrs 25 million should 
be paid by Thursday, but so far Hyundai has paid only dlrs 5.8 million 
in cash and Hyundai cars. The Seoul government has blocked the remittance 
of the remaining dlrs 19.2 million, saying the Hyundai-North Korean 
contract failed to define how long Hyundai will be allowed to run 
the tourism project. Hyundai said it was asking North Korea to help 
put down the details. Hyundai wants to have a 30-year exclusive right 
to develop the mountain. But North Korea said it did not want such 
a clear-cut condition because it assumes that the two Koreas will 
remain divided for 30 more years, and disappoints people longing for 
an early reunification. South Korean officials feared that North Korea 
may be trying to create a loophole in the contract in order to suspend 
or rescind the project in case tension flares up between the two Koreas. 
The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and the 
capitalist South in 1945.
