The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 9274. That was down 46 
points. Standard & Poors 500 Index closing at 1231. That was down 
nine points. The NASDAQ was down 14. Now a decline brought an eight 
session winning streak for the industrial average to an end. Now that 
index would have to gain more than 100 points tomorrow to end the 
year at a record high, but some traders are still hopeful.
