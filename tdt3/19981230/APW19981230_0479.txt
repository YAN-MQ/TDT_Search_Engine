Turkey claimed as victory Wednesday a Greek Cypriot decision to cancel 
deployment of Russian-made missiles on Cyprus but warned it would 
use military force to prevent any installation on the Greek island 
of Crete. Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides announced the cancellation 
of the plans late Tuesday and said he would negotiate with Russian 
government officials for the deployment of the controversial S-300 
surface-to-air missiles on Crete. ``We would take all appropriate 
political and military means if they were to be deployed in Crete,'' 
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem told reporters. ``If there is a threat 
directed toward Turkey, then we will do the necessary analysis and 
respond accordingly.'' Turkey had threatened to use military strikes 
to block the missiles' deployment on Cyprus ever since plans were 
announced two years ago. The United States and NATO also criticized 
the decision as potentially leading to conflict between NATO members 
Turkey and Greece. Turkey rejected outright a Greek Cypriot proposal 
to cancel their deployment if Ankara accepted a plan for the demilitarization 
of the island. There is no firm decision on what would happen to the 
missiles. Some reports suggested the missiles would now be stored. 
Greece strongly urged Cyprus to shift the missiles to Crete as a way 
to avoid a possible military showdown with Turkey. Greek officials 
feared that a costly increase of its military presence in Cyprus _ 
under a defense pact _ could set back austerity measures aimed at 
qualifying Greece for the European Union's single currency group. 
Athens also worries that escalating tensions on the divided island 
could weaken Cyprus' bid to join the European Union. Cem said Crete 
was an unacceptable option because it would intensify tensions between 
Greece and Turkey and entail the presence of Russian military officials 
on NATO territory. ``We will watch the developments carefully and 
continue to take every kind of measure possible,'' Cem said. ``They 
should not think that Turkey will sit around with its arms crossed.'' 
Cyprus has been divided since since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops 
after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece. ``They 
cannot find a place for the missiles,'' Turkish daily Radikal quoted 
Turkey's defense minister Ismet Sezgin as saying. ``This is Turkey's 
victory.'' ``Turkey did not want the missiles in Cyprus, so it's an 
achievement that they are not going there,'' said Ilter Turan professor 
of political science at Istanbul's Bilgi University. ``It's a victory 
for common sense since it should reduce tensions in the region.''
