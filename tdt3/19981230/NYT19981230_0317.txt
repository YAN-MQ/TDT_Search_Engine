Why do some dances wear their age better than others? The program 
presented by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater on Tuesday night 
at City Center did not answer that question, but two pieces provided 
food for speculation. George Faison's ``Suite Otis,'' a 1971 tribute 
to the songwriter Otis Redding, will probably look young as long as 
lovers squabble and reconcile and as long as Redding's songs, so tantalizing 
in their slow building and sudden rhythmic shifts, remain popular. 
Set to six of the songs, ``Suite Otis'' is a series of sassily flirtatious 
encounters for 11 men and women dressed predominantly in hot pinks 
and reds and moving through a wash of warm pink light. The piece has 
grown more stylized and less earthy, particularly in the women's dances. 
Bahiyah Sayyed best captures the lowdown, sensual humor of Faison's 
choreography. Troy O'Neil Powell and Lisa Johnson successfully merge 
the elegance and soaring flight of 1990s dance with the funkiness 
of another era in fleeting, beautifully performed duets. And have 
there ever been six such sexy men (Powell, Bernard Gaddis, Jeffrey 
Gerodias, Glenn A. Sims, Kevin E. Boseman and Vernard J. Gilmore) 
on a dance stage? What, for that matter, has happened to playful sexiness 
in dance? The men's stage crosses, bodies taut but impelled by the 
music's sinuous syncopations, got the audience cheering on Tuesday 
as reliably as ever. This is the sort of flashy jazz dance for which 
the Ailey troupe has sometimes been criticized. But what a joy it 
is to see choreography and staging with Faison's shrewd sense of theatrical 
timing and to see performing of such infectious delight. The cast 
was completed by Renee Robinson, Krisha Marcano and Christina Angela 
Gonzales. ``The Time Before the Time After (After the Time Before),'' 
choreographed by Lar Lubovitch to music by Stravinsky, is only a year 
older than the Faison piece. But for all its seriousness, this duet 
for angry but clinging lovers looked like a dated exercise in angst 
despite the clarity and emotional truth of the performance by Linda-Denise 
Evans and Matthew Rushing. Yet this piece, too, was greeted with cheers. 
Everything old is new again. The program also included Geoffrey Holder's 
``Prodigal Prince'' and Hans van Manen's ``Polish Pieces,'' a group 
work in which Ms. Robinson stood out for the febrile physical intensity 
of her dancing.
