The 27-year-old woman who gave birth to octuplets this month said 
Wednesday that she was not the least bit upset when doctors told her 
she was to have so many babies. Quite the contrary. ``I was so thankful 
to God because it is what I had prayed for,'' the woman, Nkem Chukwu, 
said as she was about to be released from St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital. 
``I was so excited. I wanted to have as many babies as God would give 
me.'' The giving began on Dec. 8, when Ms. Chukwu, a Nigerian-born 
U.S. citizen, gave birth to her first daughter, Ebuku, and continued 
Dec. 20 with the births of two sons and five more daughters. The smallest 
of the babies, Odera, just 10.3 ounces at birth, died of heart and 
lung failure on Sunday. Shortly before she returned to her home in 
Houston, Ms. Chukwu had her first public appearance at the adjacent 
Texas Children's Hospital, where the surviving seven babies remain 
listed in critical, but stable, condition. At the same news conference, 
doctors said the babies continued to do well and were now expected 
not only to survive but also to be at home with their parents within 
three months, around the time of Ms. Chukwu's original due date. There 
were still dangers, the doctors warned, and reverses were possible. 
Three of the infants, Ebuku, Gorom and Ikem, remain on a ventilator, 
doctors said, but the remaining four, Echerem, Chidi, Chima and Jioke, 
are breathing on their own and two took their first feedings of their 
mother's breast milk on Wednesday morning. The most important issue 
over the coming weeks and months will be getting all the babies off 
the ventilator and taking their mother's milk, probably with the help 
of a breast pump, said Dr. Patti Savrick, the babies' chief pediatrician. 
An important milestone was reached on Tuesday, when pediatricians 
examined all seven infants and found that none were suffering from 
cranial bleeding, a common condition among premature infants. ``We're 
feeling better and better about the babies as time goes on,'' Savrick 
said. ``Right now, I think, we're going to discharge seven pretty 
good babies.'' Seated in a wheelchair between her husband, Iyke Louis 
Udobi, a respiratory therapist, and her mother, Janet Chukwu, a weary 
Ms. Chukwu insisted that everyone in the room stand for a prayer before 
the news conference could begin and repeatedly said that it was her 
faith in the Bible and her trust in God that brought her through the 
long, difficult pregnancy. ``It wasn't easy,'' she said. The birth 
of the Chukwu octuplets, as well as other recent multiple births, 
has revived ethical concerns among many doctors over the proper use 
of the advanced fertility drugs used by Ms. Chukwu and others, especially 
since so many of the offspring of multiple-births do not survive or 
suffer lifelong health problems. One technique promoted by many doctors 
is called ``selective reduction,'' in which some of the embryos in 
a mother's womb are injected to stop them from growing, allowing the 
remaining embryos a better chance of survival and good health. This 
option was offered to Ms. Chukwu, when doctors initially thought she 
was carrying six or perhaps seven embryos, but she rejected it and 
insisted on carrying all of her babies as long as she could. Wednesday, 
she said she did not regret that decision. ``I could not find such 
words in my Bible, so I rejected it,'' she said. ``I told them I wasn't 
going to do it. I wasn't even going to give it a thought, not a second 
thought.'' Dr. Brian Kirshon, her doctor, said that he had advised 
Ms. Chukwu to take it easy when she returned home. ``I have advised 
slow integration back into normal life,'' Kirshon said. ``She's going 
to have to slowly walk greater distances, obviously no heavy lifting, 
limited activity. Each day she will be able to do a little more.'' 
Louis said the family had been talking to several prospective agents 
since the births, but had not yet decided which to hire. Only then, 
though, will the family decide on whether the babies will take part 
in television programs or commercial ventures, he said. No photographs 
or videotapes of them have, as yet, been released by the family.
