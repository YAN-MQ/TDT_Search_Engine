Rebel Unita forces in Angola have shelled the country's second largest 
city, Huambo, a city overflowing with tens of thousands displaced 
by earlier fighting in the region. The Army reports five people were 
killed in the shelling. The central highland city is a base for international 
relief agencies. The attack on Huambo follows a speech by Angolan 
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, in which he called Unita's leaders 
liars for not living up to the 1994 peace accord.
