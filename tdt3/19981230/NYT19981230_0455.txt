Raemer E. Schreiber, an experimental physicist who helped develop 
the atom bomb and the hydrogen bomb, died on Dec. 24 at his home in 
Los Alamos, N.M. He was 88. Schreiber, who was born in Oregon, received 
his doctorate from Purdue University in 1941, not long after the discovery 
of nuclear fission made it evident to scientists that some radioactive 
substances might be employed to construct the most powerful bomb in 
history. He worked during World War II on the Manhattan Project, the 
secret program to design and make the world's first atomic bombs. 
In 1943, Schreiber, his wife and his 16-month-old baby went to Los 
Alamos, where a center for nuclear research had been set up to create 
the atom bomb. Secrecy was so heavy there that his driver's license 
listed a number, not a name. In an interview in 1975, Schreiber emphasized 
that he and other American atom-bomb scientists had had few misgivings 
during World War II about the destruction that their research would 
lead to. ``It was a survival war,'' he said. ``If there was anything 
to be done, we wanted to do it.'' By the summer of 1945, he was part 
of a group of Los Alamos scientists that has been called one of the 
greatest collections of scientific brainpower ever assembled in one 
place. In July 1945, he and his co-workers completed the final assembly 
of the world's first atomic bomb, ``The Gadget.'' It was set off on 
July 16, 1945, atop a tower roughly 120 miles south of Albuquerque. 
That explosion, at 5:29 a.m., raised the curtain on the nuclear era. 
It also created an enormous flash of light that made the desert brighter 
than at noon. ``You could almost see through your eyelids, it was 
so bright,'' Schreiber recalled to an interviewer in 1980 during a 
35th anniversary reunion at Los Alamos of 600 people who had helped 
construct the bomb. They met on the beautiful mesa where they had 
built it. Later he became part of the scientific team that was sent 
to Tinian in the western Pacific to put together the two nuclear bombs 
that were dropped on Japan. That island, which American forces had 
conquered in 1944, became the takeoff site for the aircraft that dropped 
the bomb called Little Boy on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and the bomb 
called Fat Man on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1995. ``He really was the key 
person involved for the assembly of the Nagasaki bomb,'' Jim Danneskiold, 
a Los Alamos National Laboratory spokesman, said. Afterward, Schreiber 
said that his work on Tinian had helped save the lives of American 
troops by making an invasion of Japan unnecessary. After World War 
II, he decided to continue working at Los Alamos because, he said 
in the 1975 interview, of the ``heady atmosphere'' there, and because 
he could not see himself tied to the routine of college teaching. 
In the book ``Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb'' by Richard 
Rhodes, (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1995) Schreiber is quoted with his 
recollections of the period after the atomic bombs were dropped: ``That 
was the time one realized that it would be impossible to simply say, 
those are fine gadgets, they ended the war and now let's just lock 
everything up and forget about it. Really one had to live with this 
situation from here on.'' In the war's aftermath, he was named a group 
leader in the weapons division of what is now Los Alamos National 
Laboratory. In 1946, he was observing some sensitive assembly work 
by a colleague, Louis Slotin, when they and others were accidentally 
exposed to radiation. Slotin died, but Schreiber and several others 
survived. In 1951, Schreiber was named the leader of the laboratory's 
weapons division, which went on to do important work on the development 
of the first hydrogen bomb. In 1951, a timetable was set for those 
who were, as Rhodes put it in his book, ``to design and deliver a 
first experimental H-bomb'' for a test in November 1952. He wrote, 
``it was clear from the beginning that the test device would be large.'' 
The device became known as Mike, and the forthcoming test, on Eniwetok, 
an uninhabited atoll in the central Pacific, was sometimes called 
``the Mike shot.'' The more exotic materials that Mike was to be made 
of, Rhodes wrote, included ``waxy polyethylene, purple-black uranium, 
gold leaf, a breath of tritium, silvery deuterium,'' but ``Mike was 
never put together in its entirety in the United States.'' Its steel 
casing and its other components were sent to Eniwetok by ship. On 
the atoll, during the ticklish final step in the process of assembling 
Mike, Rhodes wrote, ``Schreiber was in charge of the pit crew. `They 
knew what they were doing,' he says lightly; ```I provided moral support.''' 
In its final form, Mike was 6 feet 8 inches by 20 feet and weighed 
82 tons. The time of ``the Mike shot'' was set for 7:15 a.m. Nov. 
1, local time. A minute earlier, Rhodes wrote, loudspeakers warned 
military and civilian personnel on a task force of ships in the area 
to don high-density goggles or to turn their backs on the upcoming 
blast and to cover their eyes. A radio signal from one of the ships, 
the U.S.S. Estes, traveled 30 miles and triggered Mike, letting go 
a fireball that was more than 3 miles wide and became an immense mushroom 
cloud: The width of its stem grew to a maximum of 8 miles, its top, 
to 27 miles. ``It really filled up the sky,'' Schreiber recalled to 
Rhodes. ``It was awesome. It just went on and on.'' As Rhodes noted, 
Mike's blast, the first megaton-yield thermonuclear explosion on earth, 
``would have obliterated all New York City's five boroughs.'' The 
blast was nearly 1,000 times more powerful than the one at Hiroshima, 
In 1955, Schreiber became the leader of the laboratory's nuclear rocket 
development division. In 1959, he reached a milestone in a nuclear-powered 
rocket propulsion project, code-named Rover, with the first test of 
an experimental engine using the tremendous energy potential uranium 
235, the original basis of atomic bombs. The test, which was successful, 
was carried out at the Atomic Energy Commission's bomb-testing reservation 
100 miles north of Las Vegas, Nev. Schreiber went on to become deputy 
director of the laboratory from 1972 until he retired from that post 
in 1974. He was born in McMinnville, Ore., and received a bachelor's 
degree in 1931 from Linfield College in Oregon and a master's degree 
in 1932 from the University of Oregon. He taught at Purdue University 
from 1937 to 1942. He is survived by his wife of 65 years, the former 
Marguerite Elizabeth Doak; two daughters, Paula Dransfield of Santa 
Fe, N.M., and Sara Schreiber of Corvallis, Ore.; and a sister, Anna 
Bergstrom of McMinnville.
