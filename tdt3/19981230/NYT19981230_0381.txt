When the big ski conglomerates, such as American Skiing Co. and Intrawest, 
look to acquire properties, it is usually with an eye toward established 
resorts in popular destination areas _ places with a name value already 
attached, such as Sunday River in Maine, Stratton in Vermont or Copper 
in Colorado. But two of the more recent acquisitions by ASC and Intrawest 
were more ambitious in scope. In July 1997, ASC bought the area outside 
Park City, Utah, formerly known as Wolf Mountain (which itself was 
formerly known as Park West) and embarked on a multimillion-dollar 
transformation that included yet another name change _ this time, 
to the Canyons. ``I had been driving around the resort and as I looked 
out over the enormous landscape of skiable terrain that includes seven 
canyons and 14 mountain peaks, the Canyons seemed only appropriate,'' 
said chairman and chief executive Leslie Otten. After an $18.4 million 
infusion for new lifts and new trails, the Canyons opened on Christmas 
Eve 1997. By the time the Winter Olympics arrive in Park City in 2002, 
ASC will have spent several times that amount in its goal to create 
the largest resort in America in terms of skiable acres. The acreage 
currently stands at more than 2,700. ``Previous management had never 
utilized and developed what the area offered _ incredible snow in 
the higher elevation areas and some of the most diverse terrain in 
the Rocky Mountains,'' said a longtime resort employee, Dick Reynolds. 
``Each owner that came in never had the skills nor the resources to 
develop the resort to its potential.'' Similarly, when Intrawest acquired 
the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge area in New Jersey in February 1998, 
the overhaul it had in mind was so dramatic that it, too, needed a 
new name. On Christmas Eve, after a $20 million renovation that included 
seven new lifts and a rebuilt lodge, ``Mountain Creek'' opened for 
its first winter season with another $30 million in improvements scheduled 
over the next three to five years. ``The place totally reeked of opportunity,'' 
said Ingrid Campbell, director of marketing for Mountain Creek. ``There 
are 22 million people within a 90-minute drive, and there are four 
mountain peaks, a variety of terrain and over a 1,000-foot vertical 
drop. ``Hunter and Ski Windham have 1,600 vertical feet, so considering 
our location, that compares nicely. But everything here, the lifts, 
the lodges, was dysfunctional. Basically, all we bought was a mountain.'' 
After buildings were demolished and two new trails cut, 13 antiquated 
lifts were also removed and seven new lifts were installed to replace 
them, including two detachable quads and one detachable eight-person 
open-air gondola. ``People asked, `A gondola in New Jersey?' but its 
really amazing and very cool,'' Campbell said. Although the resort's 
proximity to the New York metropolitan area is a boon in terms of 
sheer numbers of skiers, the success of Mountain Creek will depend 
on the weather. Unlike the Canyons, which has virtually no snow-making 
thanks to 325 inches of the natural stuff a year, Mountain Creek has 
invested $8.5 million in new snow-making equipment, enough to cover 
the field at Giants Stadium with 2 feet of snow an hour. ``The system 
is calibrated to operate at top efficiency at 26 degrees instead of 
the standard 16 degrees, so we can make snow when other places are 
still waiting for the temperature to drop,'' Campbell said. Still, 
with perhaps only 90 days to work with this winter due to the unusually 
warm weather through the early part of December, Mountain Creek has 
to make the most of its short season to take its place in the Intrawest 
firmament. The company has also bought what was known as Action Park 
nearby and plans to expand the water park to include mountain biking 
and rock climbing and other outdoor adventure sports for the rest 
of the year. ``We are the first day-night operation in Intrawest, 
and the night-skiing experience is something that we hope is an opportunity 
to turn on a bunch of people to the sport,'' Campbell said. ``It's 
been an exciting year, trying to get everything done in time: We were 
putting the finishing touches on the lodge, decorating for Christmas 
and getting our certificate of occupancy at the same time _ it was 
crazy. But we're open, and that's a wonderful feeling.''
