France and Britain have joined international calls for two former 
Kamir Rouge leaders to be put on trial for crimes against humanity. 
Earlier, Cambodia's King Noradam Sianuk said he won't grant them an 
amnesty. But Prime Minister Hen San says the men are not likely to 
be tried. Former U.N. Secretary General Butros Butros Ghali is in 
Penam Penn as head of the Frankifone Organization. He says it's up 
to Cambodia to decide what to do. BUTROS BUTROS GHALI, FORMER U.N. 
SECRETARY Cambodia is a sovereign state. They have to decide at whatever 
they want to decide. Unless there is a decision which is adopted by 
the United Nation, it is -- internal affair of Cambodia. Butros Butros 
Ghali.
