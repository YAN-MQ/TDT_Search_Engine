NATIONAL FORECAST Very cold air will remain in place across much of 
the Upper Midwest and Northeast on Thursday. Temperatures will continue 
to be five to fifteen degrees below average, though the stiff winds 
of Wednesday in New England will slacken Thursday, lessening the chill 
a bit. Light snow and flurries will fall in the upper Ohio Valley 
and central Appalachians a weakening disturbance moves toward the 
area. Farther north, localized snow squalls will pound areas to the 
east of the Great Lakes, especially Erie and Ontario. Lighter snow 
showers will coat the mountains of northern New England. The Deep 
South will be partly to mostly sunny and seasonal with temperatures 
mainly in the 50s and 60s. The exception will be along the Texas coast, 
where an onshore flow of moist winds will lead to scattered showers, 
especially in the afternoon. Patches of snow will streak across eastern 
Montana and the Dakotas as winds from the east ascend the sloping 
terrain. Accumulations should be light, though some areas will pick 
up a few inches where the snow persists. Rain will drench the Pacific 
Northwest and northern California as the flow of subtropical moisture 
into the region continues. The rainfall, which will amount to an inch 
in some areas, will only aggravate the flooding on rivers in the area. 
Snow levels will fall as a pool of cold air aloft moves onshore. Much 
of California and the desert Southwest will be mainly sunny and dry 
with seasonal temperatures. However, some fog will shroud communities 
in the Central Valley. Focus: Feeling The Chill Strong winds and a 
cold December air mass drove wind chill values below zero in much 
of the Northeast Wednesday. Wind chill values were derived by Dr. 
Paul Siple in an Antarctic experiment in 1939. Measurements were made 
of the time required to freeze bags filled with warm water under various 
wind and temperature combinations. Wind chill is supposed to indicate 
how chilly the air feels to exposed skin, but human physiology is 
not part of the equation. How someone actually feels also depends 
upon factors such as humidity, sunshine and that person's general 
physical condition.
