The lobbying that shapes legislation or precedes the Academy Awards 
pales when compared to the anguished phone calls made by some of Wall 
Street's biggest firms this week as they battle for pre-eminence in 
the annual ranking of the most influential deal makers. The preliminary 
figures, expected to be released Thursday, are to investment bankers 
what Hollywood's gold statuettes are to actors: the basis for bragging 
rights to market their genius as well as command lucrative fees from 
clients. League tables, as they are called, are compiled by Securities 
Data Co. of Newark, N.J., and are little known beyond Wall Street. 
But the figures sway corporate executives to pick one rainmaker over 
another to advise on their next merger. ``The league tables are marketed 
as tangible evidence of power and stature,'' said Samuel Hayes, a 
finance professor at Harvard Business School. ``With job security 
reduced, some of these senior officers at investment banks constantly 
have to provide evidence that they are adding value.'' Jim Mallea 
huddled in his cubicle at Securities Data each day this week, fielding 
20 to 30 calls from bankers inquiring about their standing. One asked 
Mallea, the research manager, to increase the value of an earlier 
deal that could improve his firm's ranking. Mallea wouldn't do it. 
A lawyer called to make sure that they were publishing the same types 
of tables as last year. ``I'm not trying to influence you,'' Mallea 
said the lawyer told him, noting how well his firm ranked last year. 
The tables remain the same. Nothing seems off-limits; bankers even 
dispute whether a competitor was involved in a deal at all. ``It sounds 
silly,'' Mallea said. ``But for their pitch books to clients, it is 
important. They want a table that shows them in the best possible 
light.'' Bankers who advise companies on mergers and acquisitions 
are ranked, among other things, by the dollar value of all announced 
and completed deals they worked on. This year, Goldman, Sachs beat 
the competition, advising on $933 billion worth of announced deals 
and $578 billion of completed deals worldwide, according to Securities 
Data. That's ahead of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch, 
which round out the top three. But bankers are loath to publicly discuss 
how much sniping goes on. ``It's our little secret,'' said a banker 
who asked not to be identified. ``We all do it.'' Still, some contend 
that the competitive pressure to be No. 1 has gone too far. ``People 
have become so self-conscious about league tables that they will take 
any action to get credit for a deal,'' another banker said. ``It has 
become a game.'' And not necessarily a nice one. Consider the dispute 
after British Petroleum in August announced that it was acquiring 
Amoco Corp. People close to that deal said J.P. Morgan groused that 
Merrill Lynch did not deserve the credit it claimed for advising British 
Petroleum. Morgan insisted it had been the sole adviser and Merrill's 
role was limited: Merrill was not even named as an adviser in the 
press release. So Jack Levy, the global head of mergers and acquisitions 
at Merrill Lynch, personally called executives at Securities Data 
to provide evidence that it had been hired by British Petroleum, said 
these people. Securities Data contacted executives at British Petroleum 
to discuss Merrill's role and after a chat, concluded that while J.P. 
Morgan had indeed been the lead adviser, Merrill Lynch played a substantial 
enough role to share credit. ``It's always worth it for a bank which 
is No. 1 or No. 2 to spend time with us,'' said Jim Sussmann, a product 
manager at Securities Data. Morgan and Merrill Lynch declined to comment 
about their clients. Sussmann said bankers have questioned one aspect 
of almost all of the top 10 mergers announced this year. At least 
five times a quarter, he said, an investment banker will complain 
that a competitor does not deserve credit. And overanxious bankers, 
wanting to know how a potential deal will show up in the rankings, 
have called him before the announcement to see where a ``hypothetical'' 
deal will stack up. The fight for credit is fierce, in part, because 
bankers hired at the last minute get as much glory as those running 
the show. Executives close to the talks between AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications 
Inc., which announced a merger in June, said Merrill Lynch was not 
at the negotiations but still got full credit for a small role. A 
similar grumble was made about Morgan Stanley and its participation 
in the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger, which _ while all advisers had limited 
roles _ was less than other banks that shared the credit. ``People 
are happy to take a role, even if small,'' said an investment banker 
who also asked not to be named. ``But other bankers don't like that, 
and will complain.'' Investment bankers too are sometimes awarded 
a small part in a deal as a favor from one of the corporations' executives 
_ another reason bankers grouse. ``If a chief financial officer or 
a chief executive want to make a friend on Wall Street, they'll let 
a banker in a deal because it can help them,'' said the investment 
banker. ``You have to look at whether a banker is being paid back 
for other services, as well as the ability for an investment bank 
to barge their way in at the end.'' But being on the team of a blockbuster 
deal doesn't always add up to spectacular profits. ``If a banker is 
brought in later to rubber-stamp a deal, fees can be thin,'' said 
Guy Dawson, co-head of investment banking for Europe, the Middle East 
and Africa for Merrill Lynch in London. ``But if they are there from 
the inception, they will get paid a fee that reflects that.'' Despite 
that, Securities Data does not rank bankers by fees because it does 
not have enough data to do so, it said. The December announcement 
of Exxon Corp.'s acquisition of Mobil is hailed as the biggest merger 
ever, but people close to the deal said J.P. Morgan was paid about 
$10 million for its services and Goldman about $11 million. The reason 
is that the deal was negotiated mainly between the two chief executives, 
those people said. Those fees are a pittance compared with the $105 
million Goldman and Credit Suisse First Boston took in for advising 
on the more complex combination of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz AG completed 
this year, a deal valued at half that between Exxon and Mobil. Neither 
J.P. Morgan nor Goldman will comment on fees paid. The grab for market 
share is likely to continue. Some newer entrants into the European 
mergers-and-acquisitions market are trying to further their standings 
by selectively trimming fees as much as 30 percent on smaller deals 
to garner much-desired league table status, said several bankers there. 
But shopping for cheaper fees is not the smartest way to pick a banker, 
said Hayes of Harvard, who as a consultant has advised chief executives 
on what bankers to choose. He's heard an earful of pitches from bankers 
all professing to be No. 1. ``I'm polite,'' he said. ``But I don't 
take them all that seriously.''
