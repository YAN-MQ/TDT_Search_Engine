Keisuke Kinoshita, a prominent Japanese director noted for tackling 
contemporary social problems and depicting the beauty of human weakness 
in his films, died at his home in Tokyo on Wednesday, his family said. 
He was 86. The cause of death was a stroke, said a family member. 
Kinoshita, a native of Hamamatsu in central Japan, joined what is 
now Shochiku Co., one of Japan's major movie companies, in 1933. He 
made his directorial debut with ``Hanasaku Minato'' (The Port where 
Flowers Bloom) in 1943, the same year Akira Kurosawa directed his 
first film. Kurosawa, one of Japan's most famous filmmakers, died 
at the age of 88 on Sept. 6. Kinoshita's most successful and best 
known film was ``Nijushi No Hitomi'' (Twenty-four Eyes), which won 
the Kinema Jumpo Award, one of Japan's top cinema prizes, as the best 
movie of 1954. It depicts the warm relationship between a female teacher 
and 12 pupils over the course of three decades, including the devastation 
of World War II. ``Kinoshita depicted the feelings and beauty of human 
weakness, in contrast to Kurosawa, who depicted people's strength,'' 
said Taichi Yamada, a noted Japanese playwright. Kinoshita's other 
famous films include ``Karumen Kokyo Ni Kaeru'' (Carmen Comes Home) 
in 1951 and ``Narayama-Bushi Ko'' (The Ballad of Narayama) in 1958 
According to critics, a hallmark of Kinoshita's work was his fondness 
for long, panoramic shots that offer the viewer a feel for the setting 
of his films. For a time, Kinoshita directed dramas for television, 
but returned to making films in 1976 with ``Shodo Satsujin, Musukoyo'' 
(Impulse Murder, My Son). He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 
Gold Rays with Rosette from the Japanese government in 1984 for his 
contributions to the film industry. Kinoshita is survived by three 
adopted sons. A funeral service was planned for Jan. 8 at Tokyo's 
Tsukiji Honganji Buddhist Temple.
