Iraq and western war planes have fought another duel in the skies 
over Iraq with missiles, this time in Southern Iraq near Taliyo. Pentagon 
officials say no western planes were hit. VOA's Jim Randall reports 
from the Pentagon. A spokesman for the U.S. Central Command says a 
British pilot in a tornado jet saw six to eight surface-to-air missiles 
coming toward him. He dodged the threat and alerted nearby U.S. planes 
which fired at the radars guiding the attacking missiles. The American 
planes also dropped laser guided bombs. Pentagon officials say they 
are still assessing the damage to Iraqi missile sites. Officials say 
U.S. and British planes resumed patrols of Iraqi skies. This is the 
second missile exchange between Iraq and allied planes this week. 
The first Northern Iraq left four Iraqi soldiers dead. Jim Randall, 
VOA News at the Pentagon.
