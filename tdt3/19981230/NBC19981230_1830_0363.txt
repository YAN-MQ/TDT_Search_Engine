Still ahead tonight -- she gave birth to octuplets. Now, with seven 
still clinging to life, a young mother marvels at her new family. 
Even when I saw them for the first time, I was so amazed. I mean, 
what God bless immediate with. Facing the future -- what's ahead for 
one mother and her instant family of seven newborns. And stepping 
into the center ring and making history at the greatest show on earth. 
The remarkable journey of the new ringmaster. You know, the last I 
looked, the average workday lasts more than a few hours, right? Right. 
But average pain relievers may work for a few hours then quit. Well, 
now there's aleve. Aleve's the one with the strength... to work on 
arthritis pain all day long with just two pills. It would take eight 
Tylenol to do that. So, if your pain reliever isn't putting in a full 
day's work-- fire it. Fire it. And take aleve. Two pills, all day 
relief. Works for me.
