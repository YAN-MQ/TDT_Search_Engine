The cries of frustration and failure, of anger and helplessness, pour 
in from across North America _ 125,000 on the day after Christmas 
alone. Invariably, the pleas for help are from adults and, mostly, 
their lament is the same: ``I just can't get it to work.'' But there 
is hope this holiday season, because 16-year-old Aaron Barton, a high 
school junior from Kirkland, Wash., is on the other end of the line, 
armed with a technical-support manual as well as a set of suggested 
``empathy statements'' provided by his temporary employer, Nintendo 
of America. ``I can relate to how you're feeling,'' Aaron, reading 
from the company chart, tells a mother in Colorado. ``I can see that 
you're upset,'' he tells another caller. ``I would be feeling frustrated, 
too.'' Then Aaron gets down to business, and most of the time he comes 
up with an answer. ``Usually, it's got something to do with the input 
button on the remote,'' he explains, matter-of-factly. ``Sometimes 
they've got the line-in, line-out jacks mixed up. So I talk them through 
the setup.'' For 150 high school students who live here in Redmond, 
a suburb of Seattle and one of the capitals of the high-tech world, 
Christmas break this year means working as a Nintendo ``play counselor,'' 
manning the phone lines and helping customers to hook up the company's 
popular video game systems. In a novel approach to what the company 
calls its ``crunch week,'' the heaviest period of customer-service 
calls all year, Nintendo recently hired the Seattle-area teen-agers. 
What the young workers get is practical: $9 an hour and, provided 
they work the full week between Christmas and New Year's, a Nintendo 
64 game set, complete with a hand-held controller (retail value, $129.99). 
But what they give is more profound: help that reaches across the 
generational bridge, to the kind of people who could not program a 
VCR to save their lives. ``Maybe it's the way society brought us up,'' 
Daniel Wells, 18, a play counselor who is a senior at Interlake High 
School in Bellevue, Wash., said when asked to explain why he and most 
of his friends have never had difficulty hooking up either a VCR or 
a Nintendo game set. ``Or maybe we're just more, you know, advanced.'' 
The Nintendo set is described on its package as ``plug and play.'' 
But, judging from the calls that come into the company's main office 
here, a stone's throw from the world headquarters of Microsoft, a 
lot of adults clearly have trouble plugging before they ever start 
playing. ``I've pressed every button on my TV set and my cable converter 
trying to get this thing to work,'' one woman who called the Nintendo 
help line told Katie Shaughnessy, 16, a junior at Redmond High School. 
``I set it to Channel 3, then I set it to Channel 4 _ nothing,'' the 
woman said as two young children wailed in the background that they 
wanted to play the game _ now. ``Ma'am, I'd like you to try setting 
it to Channel 2,'' said Katie, speaking with the calm, impassive voice 
of an air traffic controller. ``Now do you see where it says `input' 
on your remote control? Press that. Anything? No? OK, press it again.'' 
A pause on the other line. ``Wait! Hey, there it is!'' said the woman. 
``Wow, it's on. Hey, kids, it's working! Hey, thanks!'' Disconnecting 
her headset, Katie reflected that this Christmas job was vastly preferable 
to one she held earlier in the year, bagging groceries for $6 an hour. 
``It's fun when you can help people,'' she said. ``It's like, `Cool! 
I can fix somebody's problem!''' The temporary force is serving to 
double the size of the regular play-counseling staff and is primarily 
charged with setup problems, thus freeing the staff to deal with questions 
about the games themselves. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE) The company 
is expecting about 500,000 ``customer contacts'' in the week that 
began the day after Christmas, five times the usual weekly volume, 
and the teen-agers are there to help insure that any calls to Nintendo's 
toll-free help lines will be answered, and quickly, by a real person. 
``Most of this is Zelda-related,'' said Graham Crow, a company spokesman, 
speaking of the company's new game, ``The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina 
of Time.'' Introduced last month, Nintendo has already sold 2.5 million 
copies, making it the fastest-selling video game in history, the company 
says. That is, of course, good news for Nintendo, as is the continued 
brisk sale of other favorites like ``Diddy Kong Racing,'' ``Banjo-Kazooie,'' 
and ``Mario Kart 64.'' But it also means that there are tens of thousands 
of parents out there who have bought new sets for their young children, 
and many of these parents need help. (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE) In about 
9 out of 10 cases, the setup problem can be quickly diagnosed and 
fixed over the phone, said Patti Kelly, a training supervisor. Alas, 
there are some cases where nothing seems to work. ``Man, this is killing 
me,'' a caller who gave his name as Dan confided to Daniel Wells, 
the play counselor from Bellevue. ``I've tried it on every channel, 
00 to 114, and nothing. Not even a bleep.'' The call stretched on 
for half an hour, but nothing seemed to work; Daniel finally diagnosed 
a fault in the external device known as an RF switch, which did not 
have an official Nintendo ``gold seal'' stamped on it. The caller 
conceded he had bought it on the cheap at a local appliance store. 
``I see my son only one day every month,'' the elder Dan confided 
to the younger Daniel. ``He's here right now and he can't play the 
game. It's just killing me.'' Following company protocol, Daniel simply 
listened and said he understood that Dan felt frustrated; it would 
have been a breach of guidelines to suggest, say, that the man go 
outside and toss a ball around with his son instead. Still, for every 
failure, there were many cries of success. ``Oh, thank you! Thank 
you!'' the Colorado mother, whose name was Karen, told Aaron Barton 
when he got the ``Twisted Edge'' virtual-snowboarding game to come 
to life on her new Nintendo set as her two sons, 11 and 13, clapped 
in the background. ``No problem,'' Aaron replied. ``Have a nice day 
and a happy New Year!'' After the call, Aaron pronounced his one-week 
assignment, the only job he has ever held besides a newspaper route, 
to be ``totally awesome.'' ``I can't believe I'm getting paid to do 
this,'' Aaron said. ``We get a free lunch, plus they have free arcade 
games whenever we go on break.'' But what he really liked, he said, 
was the feeling that all these people out there were turning to him 
for guidance. ``Here, I feel I'm really getting treated like an adult,'' 
Aaron said. ``It's totally different from high school.''
