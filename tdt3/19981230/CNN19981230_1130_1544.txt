The designer Christian dior is using a different approach to showcase 
his latest clothing collection. Elsa Klensch reports the new show 
emphasizes product over performance. For spring/summer, Paris designer 
John galliano stays home in the newly refurbished Christian dior atelier, 
and by staying at home, he signals a new era. It's the clothes that 
are important, not those extravagant backgrounds that galliano has 
staged for seasons. The models walk down the stately staircase, and 
are close enough for the audience to see the meticulous detailing 
of unexacted color combinations. For day, galliano curves the silhouette 
to define the waist. Evening, as usual, is high style, from knitted 
black dresses to the graphic red, white and black finale. Always the 
intellectual, galliano has several inspirations. I've really been 
concentrating on the product. That's to say not that I haven't before, 
but we're showing them this time. I think it's important for people 
to see the fantastic knitwear we work on, the smaller pieces as well. 
Sometimes the shows I do at dior are perceived in a certain way and 
we just wanted to maybe, gently, change people's perceptions and show 
them really how the collections do look in the showroom. There's a 
Russian constructivist inspiration in its bold use of graphic design 
and controlled color. Galliano tells me, while he does numerous suits 
and dresses, separates make a strong message, especially knits. We've 
used aron knits, which then have this fantastic year 2000 finish on 
them which is a lacquer. So they look like super, super shiny, almost 
like chrome, in blacks and olives and navies. And that's on a knit, 
so what at first might appear to be tailored jacket, it is, in fact, 
actually knitwear. So that gives the outfit a kind of chic informality, 
which I think is really new with the wider pants. That's John galliano 
with the Christian dior spring/summer 1999 collection. Elsa Klensch, 
CNN, Paris.
