China says its economy expanded 7.8 percent this year, shy of its 
eight percent target, but is there trouble ahead with the rest of 
Asia slowing or in recession? Peter Chen of Hong Kong-based Shin Yin 
Juang Gwo Research Limited says government officials have taken steps 
to try to insure growth next year. There's no reason for doubt that 
they can still grow quite well next year. I mean, official estimates, 
you know, that we've seen coming from government think tanks are anything 
between seven to nine percent next year. I think, you know, even if 
they come in at something like seven percent, which would be below 
what they've achieved this year, that's quite commendable, I think, 
in this kind of environment. By contrast, Indonesia's economy is expected 
to shrink nearly 15 percent in 1998, Hong Kong, by over five percent, 
Malaysia by over six percent. China says it is more than $140 billion 
U.S. dollars in foreign exchange reserves, a key source of support 
for the current, the yuan which has remained stable despite regional 
devaluations. Beijing also says foreign investment fell by about 11 
percent in 1998, which paralleled investment decline in South Korea. 
Consumer prices in South Korea fell 2/10ths of one percent in December, 
a sign inflation is easing.
