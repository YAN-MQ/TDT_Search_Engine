A common new year's resolution for many Americans is to lose weight. 
But Dr. Steve Salvatore cautions that trying to match recommended 
weight guidelines may not improve your health. Barbara mishara has 
been struggling with obesity all her life. I think I've always been 
aware of being overweight, even as a child, I was overweight. Recently, 
Barbara lost 60 pounds. She no longer considers herself obese and 
feels better about herself. I don't feel like a freak when I'm with 
other people. I take up a normal amount of space on a chair, rather 
than having to use, like, two chairs, it's a great feeling. But according 
to new guidelines unveiled by the national institute of health this 
summer, Barbara is still considered obese. Under the old definition, 
a person who is 5'4" and 155 pounds was overweight. Under the new 
definition, the weight for the average-height woman drops to 145 pounds 
-- 175 pounds is obese. Under these new guidelines, 25 million more 
Americans are considered overweight. So, what is the perfect weight? 
What's the perfect shape for your body? The answer is, we just don't 
know. And the guidelines may not offer any help. According to the 
guidelines, at 6'4", 220 pounds, I'm considered overweight. So, how 
can someone who's obviously healthy and in shape be considered overweight? 
The majority of people in the United States who are overweight are 
also overfat. Although you can have for instance an athlete who is 
overweight, but is actually overweight with muscle weight. In spite 
of the guidelines, doctors say thin is not necessarily in. There are 
many studies now that show that people who are moderate, slightly 
or moderately overweight who also exercise, remain in very good physical 
health. And health is the issue, not weight. The goal should be to 
be healthy, not to reach a number on a chart. Dr. Steve Salvatore, 
CNN, New York.
