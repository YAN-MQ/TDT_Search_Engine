Ten 49 universal time. Thank you, Brian. Here's the major news story 
we're following for you at this hour. The United States and Britain 
say the two no-fly zones in Iraq will be strictly enforced despite 
Baghdad's threat to fire at patrolling allied planes. We'll have an 
update on that story at the top of the hour in about 11 minutes. Stay 
tuned. Turning to financial times, we'll take a look at the markets 
on this Wednesday morning with Victor Beady.
