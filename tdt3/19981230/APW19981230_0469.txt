Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Wednesday suggested 
that many of Iraq's woes could have been avoided if Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein had apologized for his 1990 invasion of Kuwait. ``The recent 
ramifications of the Iraqi crisis represent a link in a long chain 
of events that started with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,'' Abdel-Meguid 
said. ``This crisis would have been resolved had the Iraqi regime 
officially apologized for its aggression on the state of Kuwait,'' 
he added. ``But that never happened.'' Abdel-Meguid did not elaborate, 
but he seemed to be suggesting that a formal apology might convince 
Kuwait and its Gulf allies to support the league's efforts to end 
Iraq's isolation. Abdel-Meguid made the remarks on an Egyptian television 
talk show to be aired later in the day. Excerpts were carried by Egypt's 
Middle East News Agency. In the interview, Abdel-Meguid expressed 
regret that an Arab League foreign ministers' meeting planned for 
this week to discuss a call for an Arab Summit had been put off. The 
postponement to Jan. 24 was requested by the Gulf states. Kuwait, 
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations have not forgiven Saddam for the 
1990 invasion. The league's ministers also were to discuss the U.S. 
and British airstrikes that ended Dec. 20 and the effects of eight 
years of U.N. sanctions on Iraq. Abdel-Meguid said he agreed to the 
postponement of the meeting to avoid a further split in Arab ranks, 
MENA said.
