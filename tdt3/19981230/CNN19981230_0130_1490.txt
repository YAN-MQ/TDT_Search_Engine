Minnesota's governor-elect says his home state needs to make itself 
more appealing to Hollywood. Jesse Ventura told the Minnesota film 
board today, bringing movies and commercials to the state would help 
boost its economy. Ventura has some experience in the movies, having 
appeared with Arnold schwarzenegger in "predator" and "the running 
man." But he says he's no longer focusing on acting, just on running 
the state.
