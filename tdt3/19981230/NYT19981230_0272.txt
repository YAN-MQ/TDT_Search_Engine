The words ``fresh start'' may be among the most delightful in the 
English language. And where furnishing a new home is concerned, it 
is a delight for which age is no barrier. Some residents of Logan 
Square East, a luxury retirement high-rise in Philadelphia, have exploded 
the myth that all older people who move into smaller quarters try 
to cram in as many old pieces of oversize furniture as possible. These 
people, all 75 or older and with the desire and budget to rethink 
their lives, approached the move with a pioneering spirit. Their new 
homes become opportunities to express new attitudes about life. ``I 
don't look back,'' said Barbara Rex Darsey, a 75-year-old silk-screen 
artist who moved to a two-bedroom apartment in Logan Square East from 
a large house in suburban Philadelphia six months ago. ``I got rid 
of most of my furnishings when I moved here, because I wanted to move 
on.'' She uses her second bedroom as a studio and the second bathroom 
as an inner sanctum _ where she meditates a half-hour a day in a specially 
padded bathtub. Standing in her school-bus-yellow living room, Ms. 
Darsey said, ``Now my walls throb.'' ``In my apartment, I can assert 
my aggressiveness,'' she continued. ``I can go against conventions.'' 
She was inspired by colors she saw on a trip to Rome just before she 
moved in. ``The green on my studio walls is singing _ it's an exciting 
color,'' she said. She brought with her only an Eames side chair, 
her cat and a family of doll puppets made from her own silk-screened 
fabric. ``The garden became a pain in the neck and I was too isolated,'' 
she said. ``I decided to make an `early' move at 75.'' Dr. Rose Dobrof, 
a professor at the Brookdale Center on Aging at Hunter College in 
Newe York, sees redecorating as an affirmation of the future. ``It's 
sort of like moving to Florida to stay active and involved,'' she 
said. ``It's a second chance. The kids are grown and now there's some 
money available. For some, it's a need to get away from the loss of 
a partner. And don't forget, the widows are often looking for some 
visitors.'' Dr. Robert Butler, the director of the International Longevity 
Center at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, is fond of quoting John 
Glenn's reminder that old people dream and have ambitions, too. Last 
year, Florence Fink moved from a 17th-century house in Sag Harbor, 
N.Y., to a one-bedroom apartment at Logan Square East. ``I moved with 
four Le Corbusier chairs and 12 white T-shirts,'' she said. ``I felt 
I was going on an adventure.'' Widowed many years ago, Mrs. Fink, 
80, said she wanted to be rid of the responsibility of a house. ``The 
one thing you can't take when you move are your friends,'' she said. 
``But then again, moving to a place where you don't know anyone gives 
you a tremendous amount of freedom, since friends are a big responsibility.'' 
When she sold her house, most of her books and even some paintings 
went, too. She headed to Ikea for small-scale, reasonably priced furniture. 
``Maybe the things were meant for young people living in small places,'' 
she said. ``But so what? I figured the furniture would be fine since 
my apartment is small, too.'' She ended up with two small red chaises 
for the living room to replace the built-in banquettes she was used 
to in her old house. She then had her red chaises slipcovered in beige 
linen to suit her sophisticated, minimalist taste. She also found 
two $15 floor lamps for the bedroom and an inexpensive bookcase for 
the 50 books she had kept. She admits now to suddenly feeling youthful. 
``In Sag Harbor I felt old,'' she said. ``My old things didn't mean 
much to me. I left the house, I left the fixtures, but I took my memories. 
Those you can put in your pocket.'' Dr. Murray Schane, a psychiatrist 
in New York, said he was not surprised that, as a group, these older 
redecorators seemed so positive about the future. ``Decorating is 
not only accumulating new things,'' he said. ``It's an active process 
that you engage in with other people, often younger people. It gives 
you a sense of renewal and makes the present feel more alive.'' The 
decorator Mario Buatta said, ``Eighty-year-olds are different than 
they used to be _ they just don't seem old nowadays.'' One older client 
in Atlanta has just moved into a smaller home. ``She's one of those 
women _ definitely over 80 _ who has totally redecorated,'' he said. 
``The living room is bright yellow.'' Admittedly, most older people 
prefer to stick with their old furniture. ``People like to keep their 
pleasant memories around,'' Buatta said. ``The most important thing 
is to make a new place look happy.'' Sara Pildes, who referred all 
questions about her age to Sherlock Holmes, wanted something light 
and airy at Logan Square East. She moved there six years ago from 
a nine-room Victorian house in Brooklyn. She happily gave her collection 
of antique furniture to her granddaughter and bought herself contemporary 
upholstered chairs and kidney-bean-shaped sofas, all covered in smooth 
black fabric. As an artist, Ms. Pildes said she chose white walls 
and black furniture as background for her hard-edge geometric paintings. 
``For me, the main thing was not to take too many of my old things 
when I moved,'' she said. ``I only brought one tiny chair for my bedroom 
and two folding tables for my studio.'' Often, it's not just the residents 
who find that a move in later years can give a new lease on life: 
Norman and Sylvia Gordin managed to lure their decorator, Donald Stanley, 
out of retirement when they sold their large house on the Main Line. 
Gordin, 84, a self-described eternal optimist, appealed to his wife's 
shopping instincts in proposing the move. ``I knew that if I promised 
she could buy all new furniture, it would be a done deal,'' he said. 
Mrs. Gordin, 75, recalled, ``The one thing I hated to give up was 
my bedroom set.'' Her husband jumped in: ``I said, `Unload it, Sylvia 
_ we're starting on a new adventure.' ''
