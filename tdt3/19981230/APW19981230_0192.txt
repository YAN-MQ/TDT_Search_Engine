President Boris Yeltsin called Wednesday for the government to combat 
political and religious extremism in the wake of several anti-Semitic 
outbursts by Russian politicians. Yeltsin issued instructions to Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and several other senior officials, calling 
on them to draw up a program to oppose extremism, presidential spokesman 
Dmitry Yakushkin told Russian news agencies. The brief reports did 
not specify what sorts of measures Yeltsin envisioned. Several Communist 
Party leaders have made anti-Semitic remarks in recent months, and 
a number of smaller political movements routinely preach anti-Semitism. 
Many mainstream politicians, as well as religious leaders and human 
rights activists, have denounced the remarks by the Communist Party 
officials. Several prominent Russian businessmen and politicians have 
even called for banning the Communist Party, saying it had evolved 
into fascism. Russian authorities have said they are investigating 
the anti-Semitic statements, but have not prosecuted any of the Communist 
officials. Meanwhile, Yeltsin also planned to meet Wednesday with 
his chief of staff Nikolai Bordyuzha at Gorky-9, the country residence 
outside Moscow where Yeltsin has spent much of his time in recent 
months.
