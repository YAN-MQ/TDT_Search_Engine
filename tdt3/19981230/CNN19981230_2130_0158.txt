A house investigation concludes U.S. national security has been harmed 
by technology deals with China. The house select committee on national 
security investigated two U.S. companies that used cheap Chinese Rockets 
to launch their satellites, Loral and Hughes electronics. It concluded 
China conspired to obtain U.S. missile technology and apply it for 
military purposes. The investigators say the companies helped the 
Chinese improve their rocket technology after several failed launches.
