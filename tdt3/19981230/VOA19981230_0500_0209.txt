Cypress says it is canceling plans to deploy Russian made surface-to-air 
missiles which Turkey threatened to destroy. President Glafkos Clerides 
issued a statement Tuesday saying he will now negotiate with Moscow 
to install the missile system on the Greek isle of Crete. The Greek 
prime minister says the missile deployment in Crete will still serve 
the defensive interests of Greece and Cypress. Turkey says Acara opposes 
the missiles even if they are installed in Greece.
