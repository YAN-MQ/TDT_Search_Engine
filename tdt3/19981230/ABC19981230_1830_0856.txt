In Houston, the mother of the octuplets went home today, telling the 
world she feels "blessed." Her seven surviving babies remain in the 
hospital in critical condition, but improving. Here's ABC's Erin Hayes. 
Nkem chukwu is still quiteeak but happy. The mom says she wanted to 
have as many babies as she could. I was so thankful to God. That is 
what I prayed for. I was so excited. Her doctors, unable to save one 
of the babies, now give the remaining seven, a 92% chance of survival. 
We had a quiet night with the babies. Early concerns there might be 
bleeding in the infants brains were ruled out Monday. We're feeling 
better about the babies as each day goes on. Her final days before 
delivery were painful. Doctors today praised her strength but nkem 
was reluctant to dwell on the difficulties. It wasn't easy, but I 
did it for the love I have for them. Absent from the press conferences 
though has been the fertility doctor who helped nkem conceive the 
eight babies. Many questions have been raised about the safety and 
ethics of that decision. Nkem and her husband have not identified 
that doctor and say that is past history. It doesn't come up for discussion. 
About the future, the deeply religious nkem says she is not worried. 
God has been migrateful provider and he will continue to provide for 
me and the baby is. Her husband is more pragmatic. We still need help. 
They'll know how much help they need in a couple of months, when, 
if all goes well, seven babies will go home with them. Erin Hayes, 
ABC News, Houston.
