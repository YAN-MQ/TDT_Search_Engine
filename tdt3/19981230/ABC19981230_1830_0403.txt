A report released today by a special congressional committee claims 
that technology deals over the past two decades with China have damaged 
U.S. national security, but a lot of the details were not made public. 
The investigation was begun after allegations that contributions to 
the democratic party influenced the illegal transfer of satellite 
technology to china, which China then used in weaponry.
