Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair appealed for donors to help renovate the sarcophagus covering 
a ruined reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, an official 
said Wednesday. Kuchma and Blair sent a joint letter asking for aid 
to the leaders of Argentina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Slovenia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, New Zealand, Brunei and Qatar, said 
the Ukrainian leader's foreign policy aide, Volodymyr Ohryzko. The 
sarcophagus was hastily built after the world's worst nuclear disaster 
in April 1986, when Chernobyl's reactor No. 4 exploded during a test 
and sent a radioactive cloud over much of Europe. The shaky structure 
has leaks and tons of nuclear fuel still might remain inside. Ukraine 
has appealed to world nations to help it make the concrete and steel 
sarcophagus environmentally safe. Since 1997, about 20 donor nations 
have pledged dlrs 390 million of the estimated dlrs 758 million in 
shelter repair costs.
