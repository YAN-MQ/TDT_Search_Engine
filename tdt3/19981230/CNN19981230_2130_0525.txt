A new study suggests when people get warnings about Tainted foods, 
they don't always pay attention. The study examined a salmonella outbreak 
in 1994 caused by bad ice cream. The researchers found more than 0% 
of the public heard the health warning. But in 31% of households, 
someone ate the ice cream anyway. In all, 225,000 people got sick. 
A researcher says the media needs to make it clearer that no one should 
eat recalled food.
