An Oklahoma grand jury will submit its report on the bombing of the 
Murrah federal building today. The grand jury has spent a year and 
a half interviewing witnesses about a Possible conspiracy and coverup. 
Three people have been sentenced in connection with the bombing. A 
former state lawmaker who is conducting his own investigation says 
the government knew about the attack beforehand. But Oklahoma's attorney 
general says that's unlikely and doubts the grand jury will report 
any new evidence.
