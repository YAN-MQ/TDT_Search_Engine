The obscure sport of fin swimming _ in which racers don a mermaid-like 
tail _ is being proposed to become part of the Olympics, the organizers 
for the 2004 Summer Games said Wednesday. The final decision on including 
any new sports rests with the International Olympic Committee. Fin 
swimmers stick both feet in a single rubber-and-fiberglass ``mono 
fin'' up to 80 centimeters (32 inches) wide. They clasp their hands 
together in front and propel through the water with undulating whale-like 
thrusts of the fin. World-class fin swimmers can move about 30 percent 
faster than their conventional counterparts. Some fin swimmers use 
a snorkel, but it was not clear if it would be used in possible Olympic 
competition. The sport is growing in nations such as Russia, China 
and Australia, organizers said. Athens already has proposed water 
skiing for 2004. A spokeswoman for the organizing committee, Julie 
Velisaratou, said billiards and karate also may be suggested. Other 
sports waiting for the Olympic limelight include surfing, ballroom 
dancing, acrobatics, roller skating and basque pelota, a fast squash-like 
game in which contestants hurl the ball with large curled scoops. 
At the 2000 games in Sydney, Australia, taekwondo and the grueling 
swim-cycling-running triathlon will be elevated to Olympic status 
for the first time. In Atlanta in 1996, softball and beach volleyball 
made their Olympic debut.
