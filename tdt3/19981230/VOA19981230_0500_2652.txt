Australian officials have announced two investigations into the tragic 
city to Hobart yacht race that was hit by a violent storm that killed 
six competitors. The inquiries by the cruising yacht club of Australia 
and the new South Wales state corridor are expected to focus on a 
warning given to race organizers and the captains of the 115 yachts 
in the race. Government and commercial forecasters say they did inform 
organizers of the potential dangers of the storm and almost half of 
the yachts eventually pulled out of the race.
