Fighting this week between leftist guerrillas and rival paramilitary 
groups in northern Colombia left at least nine people dead and prompted 
hundreds to flee their homes, authorities said Wednesday. Officials 
found a trail of burned and dismembered bodies in El Diamante, a village 
in Cordoba state 285 miles (460 kilometers) northwest of Bogota. Leftist 
rebels battled militia members there for two days beginning Monday. 
Health officials in the nearby town of Tierralta said the dead included 
a three-week-old baby hit in the head with a stray bullet, a seven 
year-old girl stabbed in the stomach with a machete, and an elderly 
woman. They also recovered the bodies of five men, many with burns 
or mutilated limbs, and a dismembered head believed to be that of 
a sixth man. ``One would rather not believe that men are capable of 
this. It was pure barbarity,'' Dr. Viviano Guerrero of the Tierralta 
Health Department told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. 
Guerrero said rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, 
or FARC, burned down houses and a health clinic. It was unclear whether 
the dead were victims of the rebels or the militias, he said. Two 
soldiers were killed trying to prevent the FARC attack on Tierralta, 
the army said Wednesday. Rebels and the landowner-backed militias 
have battled for years in the disputed region of Cordoba, a locus 
of rich farmland and a key corridor for illegal arms trafficking from 
Central America and the Caribbean. In parallel fighting Monday and 
Tuesday in Cordoba, FARC rebels reportedly attacked and overran a 
major paramilitary stronghold known as Nudo del Paramillo. The militia 
base was a rearguard retreat of top paramilitary leader Carlos Castano, 
whose death was widely rumored in the local media Tuesday. Castano's 
4,000-member organization has denied the report, and top FARC and 
army leaders said they had no information to believe the 34-year-old 
paramilitary leader was dead.
