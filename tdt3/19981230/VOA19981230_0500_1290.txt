Mark McGwire of Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals has been 
selected as the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year. McGwire 
set a new all-time Major League record for most home runs in a single 
season as he hit 70 this year. From his grand slam on opening day 
to number 70 in his last at bat of the year, McGwire put life back 
into a sport still recovering from a labor strike several seasons 
ago. Big Mac received 322 points in the annual voting by Associated 
Press member newspapers and broadcasters. Sammy Sosa of the Chicago 
Cubs, who dueled McGwire for the home run crown and finished the season 
with 66 was second in the voting with 177 points. Savree Pak the South 
Korean rookie golfer who won two major championships and took women's 
golf to its highest level of popularity in 20 years was named the 
Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year. That's sports. I'm Jim 
Stevenson.
