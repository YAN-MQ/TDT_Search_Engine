And when your watch strikes midnight tomorrow night, before you usher 
in 1999, just wait a second, really, wait one more second, because 
the final minute of 1998 has 61 seconds. The extra time, a leap second, 
is being added to keep time across the world in step with the Earth's 
rotation. The adjustments going to be made, using the atomic clock 
in Britain's National Physical Laboratory, just outside London. John 
Chambers is a research scientists there and he says it's not as unusual 
as it might sound. JOHN chambers, research scientist, national We're 
talking about the change of the length of the day of maybe one or 
two thousandths of second over 10 or 100 years. And since 1972, there 
have been 21 times when an extra second is being slipped and that 
the end of this month on New Year's Eve, there won't be the 20 second 
beep seconds.
