Every day except Sunday, when she goes to church, Mama Lola ambles 
down several flights of stairs to a tiny basement altar beside the 
washer-dryer in her three-story home in Brooklyn. She passes a sugar-cane 
stalk, symbol, she says, of ``sweet good luck,'' and a small statue 
of St. Lazarus, representing the Haitian divinity Legba, the gatekeeper 
between spirit and material worlds. ``There's Papa,'' she says. ``He's 
the one who opens the door.'' For Mama Lola, as for tens of thousands 
of other Haitian emigres who ``serve the spirits'' of voodoo in New 
York City, basements are sacred places. In this neglected space closest 
to the earth, the 62-year-old matriarch and fifth-generation mambo, 
or voodoo priestess, has created a one-stop-shopping center for the 
spirit, in which every square inch is packed with ritual objects used 
for healing work: sequined whisky bottles, wobbly candles, blinking 
lights, statuettes in the shape of gorillas, pink plastic necklaces, 
medicine bundles bound with satin, ribbon and feathers, shiny perfume 
bottles and a dusty blowfish skeleton hanging from a heating pipe. 
``You feel comfortable?'' she, this Julia Child of voodoo, asks, taking 
off her shoes before she enters the room. ``I have plenty of spirits 
in there.'' Home altars and basement temples with earthen floors are 
flourishing throughout East Flatbush, Crown Heights and Canarsie, 
Brooklyn, in eastern Queens and other neighborhoods where some 500,000 
Haitian people live, said Dr. Henry Frank, executive director of the 
Haitian Centers Council, a nonprofit social services organization 
in Brooklyn. In contrast to the freestanding temples of rural Haiti, 
temples in New York, where space is tight, are tucked into homes. 
Although the number is unknown because of the secretive nature of 
voodoo, some estimate there are thousands of altars and hundreds of 
basement temples, as the religion draws a new multicultural generation. 
Paul Dorsinville, the deacon of Sacred Heart of Jesus Roman Catholic 
Church in Cambria Heights, Queens, said that of 1,000 Haitian families 
in his parish, ``about half the people are practicing both voodoo 
and some form of Christianity, mixing them in some Edenic fashion, 
and more and more are willing to acknowledge that they are practitioners.'' 
Ceremonial spaces like Mama Lola's also have attracted scholarly attention, 
most notably in ``Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou,'' an exhibition at 
the American Museum of Natural History through Jan. 3, which has been 
embraced by the public, including Haitians. (Vodou is the Creole spelling 
of an African word for spirit.) It is one of the ``most misunderstood 
religions in the world,'' said Karen McCarthy Brown, an anthropologist 
at Drew University, the author of ``Mama Lola: A Vodou Priestess in 
Brooklyn'' (University of California Press, 1991). She called voodoo 
a healing-based religion, which emerged among African slaves working 
18th-century Haitian sugar plantations. In bondage, they assembled 
found objects to create spiritual and esthetic riches. ``Out of torn 
lace, sequins, feathers and empty whisky bottles,'' writes Donald 
J. Cosentino, co-curator of the exhibition, ``they made working models 
of heaven.'' Voodoo blended African religions, including those of 
the Yoruba and Fon, with French colonial Catholicism. Practitioners 
associate voodoo spirits with Catholic saints, but the church does 
not sanction voodoo. Voodoo's deep connection to its West African 
roots has contributed to suspicion and fear of it, said McCarthy Brown. 
The understanding most Americans have of voodoo is derived mainly 
from ``novels, films and television, where images of sorcerers, zombi, 
snakes, blood and violence abound,'' she wrote. ``Popular culture 
dwells on images of voodoo's malevolence, an attitude as nonsensical 
as equating Catholicism with satanism.'' Throughout voodoo's history 
it has had its dark side. ``Voodoo shouldn't be looked upon as some 
variant of a charming folk Catholicism,'' said Cosentino, the curator. 
``It is what it needs to be _ the religion of a creative and desperate 
people. Sometimes to heal you have to use desperate measures, like 
spells.'' Haitian politicians, especially Francois Duvalier, known 
as Papa Doc, manipulated voodoo's association with black magic as 
a means of political repression. As expressed in New York homes, voodoo 
is a vibrant but gentler faith _ ``to the extent that life in New 
York is not quite so desperate as it is in Haiti,'' said Cosentino. 
He calls it ``equal parts happening and psychoanalysis,'' with festive 
cakes to feed the spirits and drummers to lift the energy level. In 
Mama Lola's altar room in Brooklyn, where she works barefoot serving 
the ``loa'' (pronounced loo-WAH), or spirits, she ministers to clients 
seeking help _ among them Koreans, Japanese, Italian-Americans and 
African-Americans. The room is filled with ``demann,'' or prayer requests, 
which can include everything from help with the Immigration Service 
to the name of an errant husband written 21 times on a piece of paper. 
Through card divination and prayer, Mama Lola creates spiritual recipes. 
In the case of an angry husband, for example, she might make a charm 
(wanga) using sugar syrup to sweeten him up and ice to cool him down. 
Each shelf is dedicated to a particular spirit family: Rada, considered 
``cool'' and ``sweet'' spirits from West Africa; Petro, a hot-tempered 
family derived from slavery experience, and Gede, trickster spirits 
of sex, death and humor, headed by a deity Mama Lola calls Bone. Bone 
smokes filterless cigarettes, likes to talk dirty and is represented 
by flaking plaster skulls, cigarette packs and Barbancourt rum. (Voodoo 
spirits possess human foibles, adding to their appeal.) Mama Lola 
restyles the space periodically, recently with silver Con-Tact paper 
``for beautiness.'' The most sacred object in the room is the ``ason,'' 
a gourd rattle with a bell attached to summon the Rada spirits. It 
is encircled with rainbow-color beads and python vertebrae, alluding 
to Damballa, the serpent deity associated with wisdom. Mama Lola has 
had to adapt her religion to New York, with carpeting on the floor. 
In the voodoo tradition, libations poured from sequined bottles are 
soaked up by spirits who live beneath the earthen floor. Mama Lola 
makes do with an enamel basin. Mama Lola's is a private world, by 
appointment only. ``I've got to know who sent you,'' she said. (BEGIN 
OPTIONAL TRIM) In the last decade, voodoo chic has set in among Westerners 
seeking exotica, from an embrace of Haitian roots music through bands 
like Ram and Boukman Eksperyans, to SoHo gallery owners buying up 
sequined voodoo flags and marketing them as ``outsider art'' at white-wine-and-satay 
openings. ``Americans are spiritual questers,'' said Prof. McCarthy 
Brown, who compared voodoo's appeal to psychotherapy. ``Sometimes 
it works, sometimes it doesn't.'' A new generation of Haitians from 
Boston to Miami also has discovered voodoo, a religion many of their 
parents rejected. For instance, Dorothy Desir Davis, 39, a curator 
and scholar who lives in Harlem, was born in Haiti but moved to New 
York at 5, attending Barnard College and then graduate school at Bard 
College. As a middle-class Ivy Leaguer _ and the daughter-in-law of 
Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis _ she is, in her words, ``not a typical vodouissant.'' 
She was recently initiated as a voodoo priestess, a ritual that she 
said ``has to be juggled between vacation time and comp time.'' The 
altar she designed for her Victorian home, shared with her husband 
Guy Davis, a blues musician, and their son, Marcial, 8, is reminiscent 
of another priestess _ Martha Stewart. Ms. Desir Davis said she embraced 
the religion of her roots after troubling dreams of deceased members 
of her family. Her involvement in voodoo upsets her father, Dr. Wilfrid 
Desir, a physician. He fled Haiti in 1959, during the Duvalier regime, 
after numerous college-educated friends and relatives disappeared. 
His daughter says that voodoo has helped her ``to acknowledge the 
past,'' reconnecting her to Haitian history, religion and art. Her 
father sympathizes. ``I think she is searching for her Haitian identity. 
The young came here as babies.'' But he added, wistfully, ``She should 
have embraced it as a scholar and not as a believer.'' (END OPTIONAL 
TRIM) In Mama Lola's living room, hangs a photograph of President 
Clinton. Just as she prescribes a mixture of onion and brown sugar 
for her baby granddaughter's cough, so she sees the president in need 
of professional help. ``That man is going to have regret buried in 
his chest,'' she said, shaking her head. ``I would tell him to give 
us a call.''
