After a fierce lobbying effort by the food industry, the environmental 
protection agency has altered a new brochure about pesticides set 
to be distributed in grocery stores. The brochure detailing food safety 
was required after Congress passed the food safety law in 1996. The 
contention was the brochure's emphasis on the health risks of pesticides 
and its references to the health benefits of organic foods. The food 
industry called the original brochure "alarmist." It asked the EPA 
to Tone down the language.
