Arizona republican senator John McCain is set to file papers with 
the federal election commission today to form what's called a "presidential 
exploratory committee." It's a first step toward a formal campaign 
for the GOP nomination in the year 2000. McCain is not expected to 
make a formal announcement of his intention to run for several weeks.
