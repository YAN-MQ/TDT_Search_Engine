CBS is selling the remaining half of the CBS eye on people cable channel 
to discovery communication less than two years after launching the 
network. Discovery has been seeking sole control since buying a 50% 
stake in July. Financial terms were not disclosed. CBS would realize 
a gain after the sale. The network will be renamed discovery people.
