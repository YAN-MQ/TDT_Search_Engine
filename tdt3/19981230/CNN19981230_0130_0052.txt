The United States and Iraq are exchanging more fighting words over 
the situation in the no-fly zones over Iraq. The U.S. and Britain 
say their warplanes will continue to patrol the zones in northern 
and southern Iraq, despite a new threat from Baghdad to retaliate. 
Allied planes flew in the southern zone today, but bad weather kept 
them out of the northern air space. That's where Iraq fired missiles 
at U.S. fighter jets yesterday, prompting the United States to strike 
an Iraqi anti-aircraft site. Iraq's vice president said today Iraqi 
planes are clear to fly in the zones and pilots won't hesitate to 
fire again at any aircraft violating Iraqi airspace. He says "the 
war is still on." Iraq considers the continuation of violations as 
a continuation of aggression. And Iraq reserves the right to retaliate. 
We said that Iraq reserves the right to retaliate in the appropriate 
time, and now Iraq is retaliating in the way and the appropriate time. 
The Pentagon has released a video tape that it says disputes Iraq's 
claim that the United States started the latest conflict. The footage 
shows U.S. pilots spotting an Iraqi missile launch. The Pentagon claims 
the time displayed on the instruments in the plane proves Iraq fired 
first.
