These days many wines owe their savor to a circuit. Here are some 
examples, should you wish to raise your glass in a high-tech salute. 
SPARKLING WINE ``You can clarify sparkling wine by hand or by machine,'' 
said Teresa Bernards, associate winemaker at Domaine Carneros in Napa, 
Calif., ``but the computer is more efficient. It not only rotates 
the bottles, but it delivers a jolt to dislodge the sediment. You 
can get a better jolt from a large machine than from a person's hand.'' 
Domaine Carneros Brut 1993, about $15; Domaine Carneros Le Reve 1992, 
about $29. ``Technology is intrinsic to the production of quality 
wine,'' said David Stevens, associate winemaker at Domaine Chandon 
in Yountville, Calif. ``Basically our computers are everywhere _ on 
our presses and tanks, for example. Even the complexity of blending 
requires a pretty serious computer and software.'' Chandon Napa Valley 
Brut, about $15; Chandon Brut Reserve, $20; Chandon Etoile, $25. CHARDONNAY 
Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville, Calif., planted special blocks 
of grapes, then monitored their progress from the sky using digital 
imaging techniques developed by NASA. ``We were able to see the degree 
of ripeness with great precision, picking the same section four or 
five times as the vines ripened,'' said Mitchell Klug, the director 
of wine-growing operations. The results can be tasted in Robert Mondavi 
Winery Napa Valley Chardonnay 1997, about $20. WHITE ZINFANDEL Computer-monitored 
temperature control is crucial at every stage in the production of 
white zinfandel to insure its characteristic taste and color, said 
Laurie Hook, associate winemaker at Beringer Vineyards in St. Helena, 
Calif. Beringer White Zinfandel, about $6.
