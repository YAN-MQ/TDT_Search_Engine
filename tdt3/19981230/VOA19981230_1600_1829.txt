U.S. war planes have attacked an Iraqi air defense site in Southern 
Iraq after Iraqi forces fired missiles at British aircraft patrolling 
the southern no-fly zone. Iraq's military said it almost certainly 
shot down one of the planes. U.S. and British spokesmen say all planes 
returned safely. We get more from VOA's Scott Bob at our Middle East 
bureau. The officials say U.S. and British planes patrolling no-fly 
zones over northern and southern Iraq Wednesday came under fire from 
Iraqi defense forces and fired missiles in self-defense. A similar 
exchange occurred Monday over Northern Iraq. Iraqi Vice President, 
Tahayasin Ramadan, said Iraq intends to challenge the air patrols 
because he said they violate Iraqi sovereignty and are not sanctioned 
by the United Nations. Iraqi officials have adopted a defiant policy 
following the U.S. and British air strikes two weeks ago, and senior 
Iraqi officials have criticized some Arab leaders for failing to support 
Iraq in its confrontation with western governments. Scott Bob, VOA 
News, Middle East bureau.
