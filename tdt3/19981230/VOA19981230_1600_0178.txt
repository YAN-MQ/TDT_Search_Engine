Zimbabwe says allied soldiers in Congo-Kinshasa have captured two 
key towns from rebel forces in the east and north of the country. 
The statement says soldiers from Congo, Angola, Chad, Namibia, and 
Zimbabwe launched a major offensive against the rebels on Christmas 
day. They said they bombed rebel forces and the Ugandan and Rwandan 
allies and seized the towns of Feetsi in the east and Lucinga in the 
north. The claims could not be independently confirmed.
