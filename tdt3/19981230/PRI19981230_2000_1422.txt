In our mailbag this week, we've got some letters about our geography 
quiz -- some pro and some con. When we had to pre-empt the quiz for 
our coverage of the air strikes against Iraq, Susan Wilkerson of Redondo 
Beach, California was disappointed. She writes that, as a car-bound 
listener, she looks forward to the quiz. When she gets the answer, 
she says, she feels smugly superior, as well she should. Keep the 
quiz, Ms. Wilkerson concludes and keep the music. Meanwhile, listener 
Dean G. writes, I beg of you, change your geo quiz music. It plays 
over and over in my head and would be the perfect soundtrack for a 
slow and painful death in the desert. We took that as a negative. 
But after extensive meetings and consultations, we've decided to keep 
the music and the geo quiz. Please Dean, don't leave us. We've got 
so much to -- for. If you have some opinions to share, go right ahead. 
We enjoy hearing from you. You can call us at 617-868-5750. Once again, 
617-868-5750. You can also reach us in cyberspace. Our e-mail address 
is The World, that's one word, theworld@pri.org. Once again, theworld@pri.org. 
You can write to us at The World at 125 Western Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, 
02134. The address, once again, The World, 125 Western Avenue, Boston, 
Massachusetts, 02134.
