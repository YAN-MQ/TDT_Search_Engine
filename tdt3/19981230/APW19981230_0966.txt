Britain marked the new year by giving some of its highest honors to 
former Prime Minister John Major and the ``three wise men'' who led 
Northern Ireland's peace negotiations to settlement in April. American 
former Sen. George Mitchell, the chief negotiator, becomes an honorary 
Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire, one of the 
highest honors Britain can bestow. The honors were announced Thursday.
