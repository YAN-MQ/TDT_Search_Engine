Western tourists freed in a deadly rescue attempt in Yemen say Yemeni 
security forces started the battle that killed four hostages. Three 
British tourists and an Australian were killed during the rescue Tuesday 
near the town of Nallenda. Two were injured and the remaining ten 
were freed unharmed. Survivors say the battle started when Yemeni 
forces attacked the kidnappers. They said the kidnappers used some 
hostages as human shields when the troops stormed the hideout. There 
was no mention of executions before the attack. Their account appears 
to contradict that of the Yemen government which said the rescue operation 
was launched only after it was apparent some hostages were being executed.
