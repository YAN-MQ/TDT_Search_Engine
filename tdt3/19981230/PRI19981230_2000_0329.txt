And final preparations are underway for the launch of the European 
single currency the euro on Friday. Eleven European Union countries 
are taking part. The president of the European Central Bank Vandeusenberg 
has voiced a cautionary note. He says the euro itself will not help

across the participating countries is likely to slow next year.
