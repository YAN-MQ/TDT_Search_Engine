House Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde is expressing concern 
over how the Senate will handle President Clinton's upcoming impeachment 
trial -- specifically, reports that there may not be a trial. Today, 
Hyde wrote a letter to Senate majority leader Trent Lott, urging Lott 
not to go ahead with a proposed early Senate vote on the house-approved 
articles of impeachment. If the proposed vote failed to gain a two-thirds 
majority, the Senate could proceed without calling witnesses and could 
also consider a possible censure alternative. Hyde's letter warns 
Lott not to "unwisely short-circuit the process."
