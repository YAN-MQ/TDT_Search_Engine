I already know that on Feb. 18 my daughter Ella will wear her black 
flowered skirt and matching sweater to school. She will eat at least 
two slices of cake frosted with whipped cream and sliced strawberries. 
And she will be expecting phone calls from all six of her uncles. 
I know this because Feb. 18 is Ella's birthday, and Ella leaves no 
important detail to chance. It is fair to say she likes things done 
a certain way _ her way. With only seven weeks left until the eighth 
anniversary of the day that she surprised us all by emerging feet 
first in the delivery room, my opinionated middle daughter assures 
me daily that the following facts are publicly known: 1. Green is 
the best color for a new bike. 2. Friday the 19th would be an acceptable 
alternative date for a birthday party. 3. The heavily annotated guest 
list (``(three asterisks)B (plus sign) J (equal sign) my BEST friends, 
sit next to me'') cannot possibly be shortened to fewer than 13 names. 
4. It is unfair to make someone wait until her ninth birthday to have 
a slumber party. ``No slumber party,'' I insist. I know my rights, 
too. ``Not until you're 9.'' ``OK,'' she says. This cheerful response 
immediately raises my suspicions. Too cunning to wage a crude, direct 
assault, she must be plotting a sneak attack. Am I paranoid? No, just 
a long-suffering subject of the Ella regime. My only hope is to distract 
her with the aid of my computer from the forbidden world of slumber 
parties. I know that not just any software program will suffice. No, 
I will need a weapon that combines a simple, easy-to-use interface 
_ that the stubbiest of little fingers can navigate _ with a wide 
range of choices so Ella will be able to feel in control of her destiny. 
Sneakily, I have already conducted preliminary fieldwork on Knowledge 
Adventure's Print Artist Craft Factory, described by its creators 
as ``a whimsical craft factory'' that enables children to design items 
like party invitations and favors. Having installed it, read the instruction 
manual and clicked furtively for a while, I am hopeful that the program's 
gazillions of graphic images, type faces, background colors, borders 
and shapes will grab Ella's imagination. It takes only a few intuitive 
mouse clicks to superimpose text and images onto the templates. Another 
good feature: when a user logs out, the software automatically saves 
work in a file called My Stuff. As if the idea just occurred to me, 
I ask Ella in my best hey-kids-let's-put-on-a-show voice if she wants 
to play with the program, maybe use it to choose a party theme. I 
explain that she can pick and choose dinosaurs, flags of different 
nations, insects, reptiles _ or animals, weather, angels, bunnies. 
``A few days before your birthday, we'll print it all out,'' I say. 
``So your party favors won't get wrinkled, or torn, or lost, or scribbled 
on or accidentally tossed into the laundry.'' ``OK.'' She seems interested. 
I congratulate myself for being wilier than a 7-year-old. When the 
opening screen appears, I show Ella how to enter her name to create 
a personalized My Stuff file. Without having to ask, she knows to 
click on OK, pulling up the Main Page, on which are 22 icons for different 
categories of items to design. That will enable her to design things 
like personalized note paper, postcards, stickers, posters, frames 
and banners. She clicks on the Party Set icon, and a Workspace window 
fills the screen. It has a palette of party-related icons at the bottom. 
``See, Ella, you can design place cards, gift bags, party hats _ '' 
``Thanks, I'll call you if I need you,'' she says, firmly peeling 
the mouse from my hand. An hour later, she comes downstairs. ``Was 
it fun?'' I ask. ``Really fun,'' she says cheerfully. ``What did you 
design?'' ``Business cards.'' She then gathers up her dog-eared copy 
of ``Shoeshine Girl'' (the novel's stubborn 10-year-old heroine is 
determined to thwart her aunt by earning her own money and spending 
it however she wants!) and heads off in the direction of her lair, 
er, bedroom. As soon as she is out of sight, I run upstairs and turn 
on the computer. Am I spying? I prefer to consider my reconnaissance 
a necessary survival tactic. I open the program, log on as Ella and 
click on the Business Cards icons. It turns out that she has designed 
three _ two with her name and, shamelessly, one for her teacher. The 
main element on her own business cards is her name, written in extremely 
large type that fades out at the margin. No job description, curiously. 
Her teacher's card reads ``Mrs. Bauge, second grade,'' adorned by 
a tasteful image of a bookworm. I click on a few other categories, 
learning that Ella has also managed to design personalized note paper 
(with her trademark, a rainbow-colored garland of flowers, running 
down the left side of the paper), an Ella's Homework Schedule and 
an Ella's School Schedule (``today's activities: try to find library 
book I borrowed from school in October''), and a set of cocktail coasters 
emblazoned with images of angels in various poses (1. blowing a trumpet; 
2. flying; 3. flying with a billowy skirt, 4. flying under rainbows). 
I am pleased that the software helped me accomplish my real goal: 
giving Ella the illusion of power. Congratulating myself for holding 
firm on the sticky birthday party situation, I call up Ella's party 
designs. The screen fills with an invitation she designed for her 
forthcoming party. It shows a dozen sleepy bears, all wearing nightcaps 
and pajamas. Under each bear is typed the same phrase: ``Come to Ella's 
Slumber Party on Feb. 19 (not her real birthday).'' It is adorable. 
I wonder if 13 sleeping bags will fit in the den. e-mail address:
