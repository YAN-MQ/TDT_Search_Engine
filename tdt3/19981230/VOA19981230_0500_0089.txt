Four tourists - three British, one Australian - have been killed in 
Yemen where security forces carried out an operation Tuesday to free 
16 tourists kidnapped by Islamic militants. Two hostages, including 
an American woman, were injured. The Yemeni Interior Ministry said 
troops raided a mountain hideout after the kidnappers began killing 
the hostages. The kidnappers seized the tourists Monday to force the 
release of their leader who was arrested in a crackdown on Islamic 
militants.
