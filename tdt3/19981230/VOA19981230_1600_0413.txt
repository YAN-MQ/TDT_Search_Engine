Since the U.S. and British air strikes two weeks ago, Iraqi officials 
have increasingly sought to challenge international sanctions imposed 
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait eight years ago. And Iraqi officials 
have lashed out at Arab leaders who it feels are not fully supporting 
Iraq in its confrontation with western powers. Iraq's Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq Aziz Wednesday criticized Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan 
for a speech in which he said he wished Iraqis would enjoy democracy 
and freedom. The official called it interference in Iraq's internal 
affairs. Mr. Aziz Tuesday criticized Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 
for commenting that the Iraqi government was to blame for the suffering 
of its people.
