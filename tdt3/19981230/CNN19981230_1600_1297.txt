This is "CNN Headline Sports." After a 30-year affiliation with the 
Washington huskies, Jim lambright has been fired. He posted a 44-26, 
and 1 record. After finishing 6-6 this year, Washington failed to 
have a winning season for the first time in 22 years, losing four 
of their last five. I think if I had it to do over again right now, 
the only thing I might do is be more political in this position. The 
greatest sorrow I have right now is that this firing affects so many 
people on my staff.
