United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan is urging the sides in 
Serbia's Kosovo province to open talks on resolving the crisis before 
it's too late. In a report to the Security Council, Mr. Annan said 
the lack of such contacts has only added to the volatility of the 
situation that led to renewed fighting last week. Meanwhile, U.N. 
refugee officials say the latest fighting has sent up to 15,000 people, 
mostly ethnic Albanians, fleeing their homes.
