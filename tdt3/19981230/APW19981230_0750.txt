WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. warplanes fired missiles and laser-guided bombs 
on a defense site in southern Iraq early Wednesday after it launched 
six to eight missiles at a British aircraft, government officials 
said. The U.S. and British planes returned to their bases safely, 
Pentagon officials said, in what was the second American-Iraqi missile 
exchange in a no-fly zone since Monday. At the White House, a senior 
administration official said that Iraq fired the surface-to-air missiles 
at the British aircraft. U.S. aircraft responded by firing two missiles 
and several laser-guided munitions at the Iraqi air defense station. 
President Bill Clinton was briefed by his National Security Council 
advisers before flying to a South Carolina resort to begin a holiday 
vacation. His deputy national security team also was meeting to discuss 
the incidents over Iraq, the White House said. Before leaving, the 
president discussed Iraq with Russian President Boris Yeltsin during 
a previously scheduled telephone call and agreed not to allow their 
differences to disrupt U.S.-Russian relations, said David Leavy, a 
White House spokesman. The Russian government strongly criticized 
the U.S. and British bombing of Iraq in mid-December, insisting there 
was no justification for using force. Leavy said Yeltsin did not specifically 
mention the no-fly clashes. ``Our allied aircraft will continue to 
enforce the no-fly zones vigorously,'' said Leavy. ``As the president 
has said, they are a key element of our containment policy.'' Leavy 
said Wednesday's incident ``underscores the continued threat that 
Saddam (Hussein) poses to the region. We will take the necessary precautions 
to carry out our mission and to protect our air crews.'' At the Pentagon, 
spokesman Col. Richard Bridges said 20 U.S. fighter jets and electronic 
warfare planes and four British bombers were patrolling the Iraqi 
skies when the incident occured, a normal presence for a no-fly mission. 
Asked if any Iraqi missiles came close to any Western aircraft, Bridges 
said, ``I have no indication they were anywhere near successful.'' 
He said the Iraqis often don't turn on targeting radar until the last 
second _ making it almost impossible to score a hit _ because the 
anti-aircraft site doesn't want to draw a radar-seeking missile reponse. 
``I'm sure Saddam is hoping he's going to get lucky at some point,'' 
Bridges said. ``We have robust rules of engagement that allow us to 
defend ourselves adequately.'' For now, it appears that Iraq is simply 
taunting U.S. and British warplanes in the no-fly zone by throwing 
up missiles as part of a campaign to challenge the tight U.N. and 
American controls on the country, according to foreign policy experts. 
Although Iraq, which doesn't accept the legitimacy of the no-fly zones, 
has claimed it is now operating aircraft in the off-limits regions, 
Bridges said there have been no reported sightings of Iraqi planes 
in the region in the past few days. A British bomber first reported 
Iraqi missile launching at about 9:30 a.m. local time near Talil, 
Iraq. ``They visually detected firing. They took evasive action to 
avoid the missiles,'' said Maj. Joe LaMarca, a spokesman for the U.S. 
Central Command, responsible for American forces in the Persian Gulf, 
at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. ``I don't know for sure 
what they (the Iraqis) were firing at, but common sense would tell 
you that they were firing at the (British) aircraft.'' Two U.S. F-16 
bombers patrolling the area responded and fired two anti-radar missiles 
and a number of precision-guided bombs onto the site at 10:15 a.m., 
a Pentagon spokesman said. The aircraft safely departed the area about 
a half hour later. A spokesman for the British Defense Ministry said: 
``The firm response to the latest Iraqi provocation is ample evidence 
of our commitment'' to patrol the no-fly zone. No activity was reported 
in the northern no-fly zone. On Monday, U.S. warplanes exchanged missile 
fire with Iraqi air defenses when the planes were fired upon by Iraqi 
surface-to-air missiles. In Baghdad, the Iraqi military said Monday's 
U.S. attack killed four Iraqi soldiers and injured seven others.
