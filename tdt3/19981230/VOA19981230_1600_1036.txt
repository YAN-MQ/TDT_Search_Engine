This is VOA News Now. I'm Tony Riggs broadcasting from Washington. 
Have you talked about your child's health today? All parents want 
the best for their babies, and the best begins with good food. For 
young infants, breast milk alone is the best food until a baby is 
four, five months old. Then you can begin to add solid foods. As girls 
and boys grow, they need a diet filled with a variety of green and 
orange-colored vegetables, fruits, tubers, rice, bread, and beans, 
or other legumes. Find out from a health worker about the best foods 
to feed growing children. Your child's health is your family's future. 
It's time now for a look at sports. Here's VOA's Dave Byrd. OK, thanks 
a lot, Tony.
