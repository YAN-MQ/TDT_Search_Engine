A U.S. congressional panel has concluded that some American technology 
deals with China have jeopardized national security. A House committee 
investigating military and commercial deals with China issued a report 
Wednesday. Here is California Congressman Christopher Cox. Based on 
unclassified information, I can tell you today that we have found 
that national security harm did occur. The investigation was sparked 
by President Clinton's decision earlier this year to allow a U.S. 
company, Hughes Electronics Corporation, to launch satellites atop 
low-cost Chinese rockets. The company is run by a top contributor 
to Mr. Clinton's Democratic Party.
