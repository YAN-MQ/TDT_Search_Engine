The multi-billion dollar merger of two giant oil companies, Amoco 
and British Petroleum is closer today. The Federal Trade Commission 
approved the merger but, first, the two companies will have to sell 
off some of their assets. "The World's" David Levalley reports. The 
FTC voted unanimously to OK the $53 billion deal, saying the company's 
operations rarely overlap in a way that threatens competition. But 
the stamp of approval came with a few conditions attached. To appease 
antitrust concerns, London- based British Petroleum and Chicago-based 
Amoco must first sell off 134 gas stations and nine petroleum terminals. 
That's just a fraction of the more than 28,000 gas stations the companies 
now operate. The mega-business deal is among the largest ever, but 
is eclipsed by the pending $77 billion merger of oil giants Exxon 
and Mobil. For "The World," I'm David Levalley.
