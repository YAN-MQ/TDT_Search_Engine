Ukraine has raised less than half of its planned privatization revenues 
in 1998, partly because of problems caused by Russia's financial crisis, 
a news report said Wednesday. The State Property Fund had channeled 
422 million hryvna (dlrs 123 million) to the state budget as of Tuesday, 
far below the 1 billion hryvna (dlrs 292 million) the government originally 
planned for the year, according to the fund's acting chairman, Vadym 
Vasyliev. Vasyliev said privatization efforts this year were hindered 
by neighboring Russia's financial crisis, which sent aftershocks into 
Ukraine's economy and scared foreign investors away from its shaky 
financial markets. Still, privatization results were better than in 
previous years. The government received only 70 million hryvna (dlrs 
20 million) from state property sales in 1997, Vasyliev said, according 
to the Interfax news agency. He said the government hopes to draw 
investors back to Ukraine next year by offering them controlling stakes 
in several enterprises. Vasyliev did not name the companies, but was 
apparently referring to the former Soviet republic's energy giants, 
which the government was preparing to sell this year. The sale was 
delayed because of the financial crisis. Ukraine also wants to sell 
its telecommunications monopoly, but preparations for the auction 
are not expected to be complete until 2000. The government has set 
its privatization revenue target at 800 million hryvna (dlrs 233 million) 
for 1999.
