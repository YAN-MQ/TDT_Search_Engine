In the no-fly zone in southern Iraq. U.S. officials say American and 
British jets returned safely to their bases after a missile exchange 
with an Iraqi air defense battery. Iraq claims one of the allied jets 
was shot down. The Pentagon says the incident began when Iraq fired 
six to eight surface-to-air missiles at British tornado aircraft on 
routine patrol. American F-16 jets responded with missiles and laser-guided 
bombs. Iraq says a farmer was killed, two other people were injured. 
President Clinton was briefed on the incident before leaving the White 
House to spend the new year's holiday in South Carolina. The president 
also discussed the situation in Iraq with Russian president yeltsin.
