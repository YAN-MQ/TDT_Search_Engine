150,000 illegal immigrants will be allowed to stay in the United States 
temporarily while their home countries recover from hurricane Mitch. 
The immigration and naturalization service says it will give 18-month 
work authorizations to migrants from Nicaragua and Honduras. The INS 
commissioner says it's a humanitarian gesture that will help alleviate 
the pressure as those countries rebuild from their worst natural disaster 
this century. Guatemala and El Salvador were also hard hit by Mitch, 
but migrants from those countries are only getting a 60-day extension.
