Tomorrow night around the world, people will welcome in 1999. Eddie 
Mayer has written us another letter from London. I'll see a new year 
in Paris with some friends. In fact, every year, for the past 10 years 
or so, I've taken it upon myself to monitor how people from different 
countries and cultures mark the passing of another year. I do this 
purely in the interest of research. In Amsterdam, they explode fireworks 
in the streets. And they're some very narrow streets. It is unruly 
and crazy, as you'd expect from the Dutch. In Zurich, we stood around 
int he main square, holding our cans of beer at midnight, only to 
see the ultra efficient Swiss produce crystal glasses and bottles 
of champagne from beneath their heavy coats to celebrate a new year 
in style. And in Berlin, as in most European cities, the honking of 
car horns and the kissing of strangers is compulsive. Perhaps this 
desire to see how other people celebrate a new year comes from the 
strong Scottish traditions which were very much part of my childhood. 
In Scotland, until recently, the new year, it's never called new years, 
was a bigger holiday than Christmas. Indeed, it's only during the 
20th century that Christmas Day became an official holiday in Scotland 
at all. Even now, new year is still the big holiday highlight. The 
focus is on December 31st, New Year's Eve, to everyone else in the 
world. But to Scotts everywhere, it's known as Hogmanay. Traditionally, 
on the evening of Hogmanay, you might go out drinking or partying 
with friends, but you should be home in good time for midnight and 
the bells. Ideally, you'll be gathered with your family, glasses charged, 
so that on the stroke of midnight, a toast can be drunk. Then you 
wait. Hopefully, a few minutes after 12, the doorbell will ring and 
you'll have your chance to welcome in someone called, your first fruit. 
Traditionally, the first fruit to step over your doorway at the beginning 
of the new year will be tall, dark and handsome; this brings good 
luck. He'll bring with him a small gift and you will have ready for 
him either a glass of Scotch or savory Scottish treats like cluty 
dumpling or black bun. Why not try it out on your neighbors tomorrow 
night? Tell them there's some Scots in you and insist they put some 
Scotch in you. Till next time, happy new year. Eddie Mayer.
