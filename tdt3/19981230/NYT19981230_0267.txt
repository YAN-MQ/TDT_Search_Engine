Like a scene in a snow globe, the holiday season upends the typical 
household in a flurry of trash, drips and spills. Just as the house 
starts to settle from Hanukkah and Christmas, New Year's Eve hits. 
Like all hangovers, holiday cleaning headaches can be dealt with. 
Professional strategies, home remedies and common sense tackle most 
of the problems. There's a right way and a wrong way to get the Christmas 
tree back out of the house, for instance. The wrong way: dragging 
it out backwards by the boughs like a cat on its way to the vet. ``The 
best way to get a fresh tree out of the house is to make a sling for 
it with a sheet or a bedspread,'' said Mary Ellen Pinkham, the author, 
with Dale Berg, of ``Mary Ellen's Complete Home Reference Book (Crown, 
1994). ``Don't carry it out late at night,'' she added. Pine needles 
left behind should be vacuumed ``very, very slowly, to allow the machine 
to accommodate them without clogging the beater head,'' advised Jeff 
Campbell, the president of the Clean Team, a cleaning service in San 
Francisco. Pine sap should be softened _ not frozen _ with gum and 
tar removers available at auto-supply shops. Cooking oil will get 
it off your hands. Check with the local garbage-removal authority 
about the tree _ it may be recyclable. Rockefeller Center sends its 
tree, which comes down on Jan. 4, to a New Jersey nursery, where the 
trunk is cut into six sections, to be used as jumps for the United 
States Olympic equestrian team trials nearby. The branches are mulched 
into chips for trails at a neighboring Boy Scout camp. Stains in the 
carpet aren't going to be as easy to remove as the tree. Wine stains 
should be treated as fresh spills. ``Blot it up well,'' advised Dale 
Berg, Ms. Pinkham's collaborator. ``The carpet sucks the stain down.'' 
Ms. Berg recommended disposable diapers, salt or cat litter, ``for 
wicking the stain out,'' before deploying any cleaning agents. Heloise, 
the household-hints columnist, agreed. ``You'll get 90 percent of 
the stain out. Then, mix a mild dish-washing liquid solution _ a quarter 
teaspoon to a cup of warm water _ to dab on the stain, rubbing from 
the outside of the stain into the center. Then rinse it with fresh 
water.'' Before soaping any carpet or rug, test a hidden corner first 
for colorfastness _ a white cloth will pick up dye from the sudsed 
area if it isn't colorfast. Red wine on table linens is best attacked 
with a fight-fire-with-fire approach, Ms. Pinkham said. ``Pour white 
wine on it,'' she said. ``It changes the color. Now, you're not dealing 
with a dye problem _ you're dealing with a blotting problem.'' Grease 
stains like those from gravy should be sprinkled with salt, flour 
or artificial sweetener, patted lightly and left until nearly dry. 
Then, pour a liquid laundry detergent with enzyme agents in it _ they 
digest the food _ or a dish detergent for pots and pans, which has 
strong degreasing agents in it, onto the stain and ``let it sit for 
10 minutes,'' Heloise advised. ``Then, wash it in the hottest water 
safe for the fabric.'' Ms. Pinkham advised prevention over cure. ``If 
they're valuable linens, spray them with fabric protector or spray 
starch before you set the table,'' she said, ``as a stain barrier.'' 
For clothing, like a necktie, try spit. ``The enzyme in spittle that 
breaks down food breaks down food stains,'' Ms. Berg explained, recommending 
that you first excuse yourself from the table. Experts ran hot and 
cold on candle wax. The consensus: the ice treatment for linens and 
clothing that can be conveniently frozen for a good length of time. 
``Several days in the freezer will pull the moisture out of the wax, 
in addition to hardening it, so that it flicks right off,'' Heloise 
said. For tables and other wood furniture, Ms. Berg suggested softening 
candle wax with a hair dryer on a low setting, then scraping it up 
with a plastic spatula. White furniture rings caused by wet drinking 
glasses can be rubbed out with the oil of a broken walnut or almond, 
she added, or cigarette ash mixed in mayonnaise. For wax on fabrics 
or carpeting, Jim Ireland of White Glove Elite, a New York residential 
cleaning service, recommended lightly ironing a plain brown grocery 
bag over the candle drippings, which will warm the wax. The absorbent 
paper will pull it up. Don't use a printed bag. Anyone who hates children 
and dogs, to paraphrase W.C. Fields, may have had to clean up after 
them. In fairness, adults get excitable at parties, too. ``People 
getting sick on the carpet? Get new friends,'' said Ms. Pinkham, half-joking. 
``Vomit's really tough.'' She advised treating it like a food stain, 
with a thick paste of an enzyme-active laundry detergent and water. 
``Clean up as much as you can _ trash bags used as gloves are good 
for this _ then spread the solution on the stain, start blotting and 
rinse, and blot that. Then vinegar and water for the odor.'' The smell 
of the holiday season, from sweet to stale, is often the last guest 
to leave. ``Go to the supermarket and buy cheap coffee,'' said Barbara 
Roche Fierman, the owner of New York's Little Elves, a cleaning service 
that keeps the Kips Bay decorator show house clean through its annual 
run. ``Fresh, dry coffee, sprinkled on carpets or fabrics, then vacuumed 
up, absorbs smells better than anything on the market.'' Ms. Pinkham 
soaks a towel in a basin of water with a cup of vinegar, then spins 
it dry in the washing machine and runs through her house, looping 
it above her head like a helicopter blade to ring in the New Year. 
There's little, she explained, that doesn't exorcise.
