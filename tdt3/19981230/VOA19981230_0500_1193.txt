A special U.S. Olympic committee panel has held its first meeting 
in Washington about possible bribery in Salt Lake City, Utah's bid 
to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. As David Berg reports, the panel, 
headed by former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, is one of 
four investigations into whether Salt Lake City used illegal means 
to win the right to host the games. The U.S. Olympic Committee panel 
will be trying to find out if Salt Lake City used bribes and gifts 
to win the right to host the 2002 games. The International Olympic 
Committee has said that Salt Lake officials gave gifts, scholarships, 
and athletic training help to the families of IOC members in exchange 
for their votes. Senator George Mitchell says his panel will try to 
get at the truth and set new guidelines for other U.S. cities bidding 
to host the Olympic games. The very purpose of the commission is to 
try to get the facts and to put them in some context for the U.S. 
Olympic Committee to try to help make certain that if, in fact, there 
were practices in the past which were inappropriate, we do everything 
we can to prevent them from occurring in the future. The panel promised 
if it finds any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, the information would 
be given to the U.S. Justice Department, which is also investigating 
the Salt Lake City bid. Senator Mitchell's panel has to issue a report 
by February 28th. Regardless of what the panel finds, USOC head Bill 
Hibbell said Tuesday he does not believe there is any chance that 
Salt Lake City will lose the games. In Washington, I'm David Berg,
