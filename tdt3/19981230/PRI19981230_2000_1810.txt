For "The World," I'm Derrick Stoffel in the BBC Newsroom in London. 
American war planes using rockets and laser-guided bombs have, again, 
attacked an Iraqi missile site the second time in a week. The attack 
was in retaliation for an earlier incident when a British plane came 
under fire from Iraqi missiles. From Baghdad, here's the BBC's John 
McIntyre. Both America and Britain say the attack demonstrates President 
Saddam Hussein's attempt to shoot down an enemy aircraft for political 
aims. A pattern does, however, seem to be developing in which both 
sides are exercising what they see as their legal rights. The allies 
to police the no-fly zones protecting Kurdish people in the North 
and Shiite Muslims in the South. And Iraq, the depended sovereignty. 
Iraq says it does not recognize the no-fly zones as being legally 
sanctioned by the United Nations. More importantly, it's trying to 
portray itself as a victim of Western aggression in an attempt to 
win support for the lifting of sanctions which continue to cripple 
the Iraqi economy. John McIntyre reporting from Baghdad.
