Well, actor Jim Carey says he's feeling like himself again after the 
conclusion of his work on the film, "The Man on the Moon." Carey says 
it was an intense, emotional experience to star in that movie. It's 
about Andy Kaufman, an unconventional comedian and actor who died 
of cancer when he was in his 30s. Carey says he will devote 1999 to 
working in family movies that children can enjoy. First, he will star 
in "The Incredible Mr. Limpett." You might remember that film came 
out in the 1960s. Well, this will be a remake fantasy about a man 
who turns into a fish. Then Carey will star in "How the Grinch Stole 
Christmas."
