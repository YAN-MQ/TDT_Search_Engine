The United States and Britain say the two no-fly zones in Iraq will 
be strictly enforced in spite of Baghdad's threat to fire at patrolling 
allied planes. The comments came in Washington and London Tuesday 
after Iraq said its anti-aircraft batteries were ready to fire on 
allied planes, and that Iraqi aircraft were flying freely in the zones. 
U.S. and British military officials say they're not aware of any Iraqi 
flights inside the zones. Iraq's latest threats came a day after U.S. 
jets attacked an Iraqi air defense site in northern Iraq which had 
fired upon them.
