When we come back -- legacies and memories. Time is running out on 
Buick's swing into '99. And for a short time only, we've got numbers 
that'll make your head spin. And a new twist-- but these numbers won't 
be around much longer so better jump now. Swing into your Buick dealer 
today. Out here, I'm in command. So am I supposed to say, "slow down, 
guys. I'm constipated"? I don't think so. You try to eat right. Sometimes 
you can't. Harsh chemical laxatives-- they can kick in whenever and 
wherever. Not an option. So I rely on doctor-recommended metamucil. 
It's got 100% natural fiber-- works with my body, gently. Which is 
important to a sensitive guy like myself. Metamucil-- Finally tonight, 
before we turn our attention to the promise of the year to come, there 
is a moment to reflect. A chance to remember all that happened to 
us in 1998, and especially to salute those who are no longer here. 
We're going to have to fight the political bur of coursecy. We may 
even have to be pushy. I just like to be remembered as an honest person 
who tried. With George McGovern as president of the United States, 
we wouldn't have to have -- in the streets of Chicago. Liftoff and 
the clock is turning. I got you babe I got you babe Good night, everybody. 
Good night, everybody. Because I'm so hungry, I'm very so hungry. 
You can do anything stand by your man come and gone since I wandered 
from my home till we meet again What you see is what you get. Take 
my wife, please. I want to go home at the old ball game The public 
has a right to be informed. Let's take it nice and easy it's gonna 
be so easy that I get a kick out of you and did it my way my way Some 
of the people to remember. Tomorrow night, a review or what mattered 
most in 1998. That is our report on "World News Tonight." Don't forget 
"20/20" and "Nightline." I'm Kevin Newman. For all of us at ABC News, 
good night.
