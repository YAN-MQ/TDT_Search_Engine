A U.N. chartered plane that went down in rebel-held territory in Angola 
has been located. A U.N. spokesman says the plane, which had 14 people 
on board, was spotted eight kilometers from Villanova in Central Angola. 
He said U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is trying to contact Angola's 
president and rebel leader to arrange for a team to go to the site 
to seek possible survivors. Hopes were raised after an SOS signal 
was received from the plane and it was learned the plane did not disintegrate 
when it went down.
