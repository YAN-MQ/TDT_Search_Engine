The Oklahoma City bombing was not a conspiracy. That's the conclusion 
reached today by a 14-member grand jury after an 18-month investigation. 
The panel found no credible evidence anyone other than Timothy McVeigh 
and Terry Nichols were involved in carrying out the April 1995 attack, 
which killed 168 people. It also concluded the federal government 
had no prior knowledge of the bombing. What reasonable person could 
believe that there were those other than McVeigh, Nichols and fortier 
who knew about this and deliberately withheld the knowledge condemning 
168 people to die, or that such a conspiracy could possibly be kept 
a secret. Michael fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for 
failing to warn authorities about the attack. The grand jury did issue 
one sealed indictment, which was kept secret pending an arrest. The 
district attorney says he still plans to prosecute McVeigh and Nichols 
on state murder charges.
