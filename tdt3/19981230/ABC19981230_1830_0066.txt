Good evening. The U.S. and Iraq were engaged in another dangerous 
round of hide and seek today, trading fire for the second time this 
week. This is a game Saddam Hussein is very good at. And here's how 
it played out today. Iraq fired missiles at U.S. and British planes 
in the no-fly zone in the southern part of Iraq this time, near the 
city of talil. The U.S. retaliated by firing back. At the Pentagon 
tonight, there is a sense of unease. Because sooner or later, military 
planners say, Saddam Hussein could get lucky and hit a U.S. plane. 
ABC's Barry Serafin 24 coalition aircraft, including American F-16 
and British tornado fighters were patrolling northwest of talil, when 
the British planes reported that six to eight Iraqi surface-to-air 
missiles had been launched. U.S. jets responded by firing two H.A.R.M. 
missiles. A number of laser guided 500 pound bombs at the site. Those 
bombs appear to have hit their target, but there's been no official 
word on the damage. Iraq has its own version of what happened. ABC's 
Ron Claiborne is in Baghdad. The Iraqis admit to firing missiles at 
the British aircraft over southern iraq this morning. They say they 
probably shot down one of those aircraft and in the Iraqi version 
of events, the American planes which followed later, fired not at 
anti-aircraft defensive positions but into a civilian village, killing 
one farmer and injuring two people. U.S. and British officials said 
they only hit military targets and all of their aircraft returned 
safely to base. If Iraq continues to fire missiles at allied planes, 
some analysts say, the U.S. may have to go beyond its policy of retaliating 
only when fired upon. That would mean seeking out and destroying missile 
and radar sites and other targets. At some point, perhaps in a week 
or even days, if this becomes a Theater-wide campaign throughout Iraq, 
we're likely to see a much more serious allied response. But the missile 
batteries are mobile, easy to hide, and knocking them out can be difficult. 
In "operation desert fox" earlier this month, American forces attacked 
34 missile and air defense sites. Ten suffered no damage, six suffered 
only light damage. For now it appears the cat and mouse game will 
go on. With U.S. planes ready to respond if and when they are fired 
upon again. Barry Serafin, ABC News, Washington.
