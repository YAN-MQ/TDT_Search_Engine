Sri Lanka has yet to decide on international mediation offers to settle 
the 15-year-old ethnic conflict with Tamil Tiger rebels, President 
Chandrika Kumaratunga was quoted Wednesday as saying. But Sri Lanka 
will not again seek India's help, as it did in the 1980s when Indian 
troops became embroiled in the conflict and ultimately withdrew after 
heavy casualties, she said. Sri Lanka has received many offers from 
different countries and international organizations. ``We will decide 
when the time arises,'' Kumaratunga told a group of senior Indian 
journalists on Tuesday. She flew home Wednesday after three days in 
New Delhi during which she signed an agreement setting up a free trade 
area between the two countries. Kumaratunga said her peace plan offering 
autonomy to the country's nine provinces, including the Tamil-dominated 
north, was widely favored by the people. But she accused the main 
opposition party of blocking its adoption in Parliament, where she 
lacks the required two-thirds majority. Tamil rebels are fighting 
for a separate homeland for minority Tamils, accusing the majority 
Sinhalese of widespread discrimination in education and jobs. More 
than 50,000 people have been killed. India's previous involvement 
in the conflict stems from its geographic proximity and the fact that 
Sri Lankan Tamils share a common language and culture with those living 
on the southern India. Asked about the possibility of resumption of 
peace process with Tamil Tigers, Kumaratunga said the LTTE must agree 
to certain conditions if the dialogue were to be resumed. She didn't 
elaborate, but in a recent interview with Frontline magazine she said 
the Tigers must agree to a time frame so that negotiations will not 
drag on and allow the guerrilla army to regroup. An earlier demand 
for the rebels to surrender some arms has been dropped. The last round 
of peace talks broke down after three months in 1995. Tamils comprise 
18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.5 million people.
