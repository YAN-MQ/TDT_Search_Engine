This is music by Sean Davy from the Irish comedy "Waking Ned Divine." 
Davy is well known for his use of traditional keltic instruments and 
composes only the occasional film score. They typical marketing strategy 
for foreign films like Ireland's "Waking Ned Divine" is for the producers 
to release them first in their home country and then to bring them 
here to the United States. But Fox Searchlight, the company distributing 
"Waking Ned Divine," decided to do a switch-a-roo. "Ned Divine" opened 
last month in the United States, but it won't be until March when 
Irish audiences get to see it, under the shortened title of "Waking 
Ned." Trailors for "Waking Ned Divine" are featured Fishermen's Blues 
by the Waterboys. Unlike the movie, which hit American shores first 
before coming home to Ireland, Fishermen's Blues was a hit in Ireland 
nine years ago and is now getting enough exposure in the United States 
to perhaps climb the charts here.
