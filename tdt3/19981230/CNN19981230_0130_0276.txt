The pacific northwest is getting more rain. Driving rain and melting 
snow already have triggered floods and mudslides in Oregon and Washington. 
Scores of people have been evacuated from their homes, and parts of 
U.S. highway 101 are still closed. On the other side of the country, 
the effects of the Christmas eve ice storm are still being felt in 
the south. Thousands of people in Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama and 
Mississippi are still without power. Utility officials say everyone 
should have electricity by tomorrow.
