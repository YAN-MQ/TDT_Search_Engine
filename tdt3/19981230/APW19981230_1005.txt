Britain is giving some of its highest honors to former Prime Minister 
John Major and the ``three wise men'' who led Northern Ireland's peace 
negotiations to settlement in April. American former Sen. George Mitchell, 
the chief negotiator, becomes an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the 
Order of the British Empire, one of the highest honors Britain can 
bestow. The honors were announced Thursday. Finnish former Prime Minister 
Harri Holkeri becomes an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of 
British Empire _ one rank lower than Mitchell's. Because they are 
not British subjects, neither could be called Sir. Canadian Gen. John 
de Chastelain , who was co-chairman of the peace talks, is made a 
Companion of Honor, a very prestigious order limited to 65 people 
at any time. The same honor goes to Major, who laid the groundwork 
for the talks while he was in office and continued to work for peace 
after the 1997 elections in which he was ousted by Prime Minister 
Tony Blair's Labor Party. ``The prime minister has always acknowledged 
the work his predecessor did in Northern Ireland and in having the 
vision to start the peace process. It is entirely right that he should 
be honored for the very important role he played,'' said a spokesman 
for the vacationing Blair. Mitchell said he was glad the other peacemakers 
had been honored too. ``It's a great honor and I'm especially pleased 
that my friend and colleague Prime Mininster Harri Holkeri will be 
recognized as well. Both he and Gen. Chastelain deserve more credit 
than they've received for their effort on Northern Ireland.'' Holkeri 
said he considers the honor one for Finland, not him personally. ``When 
the honor is given to me, it is given to the Finnish attitude and 
the Finnish desire to work with the international community,'' he 
said. ``It is by chance that it was I who became involved in the peace 
process.'' Recipients of the annual New Year's Honors are selected 
by the government and Queen Elizabeth II bestows the honors. In the 
case of foreign recipients, like Mitchell, Holkeri and de Chastelain, 
the honorees are notified of their awards by the Foreign Office and 
the honors are usually bestowed by the British ambassador in their 
country. The New Year's Honors List of 1,000 names of the famous and 
the humble singles out for commendation many who played roles in the 
turning point in Northern Ireland's history. The government offered 
honors to individuals in Northern Ireland's ``nationalist'' community 
who seek to break ties with Britain, but the honors were declined, 
the government said. ``We completely understand that,'' a Downing 
Street spokesman said. He would not say who they were or to which 
parties they belonged, but added that ``the individuals concerned 
were those who worked hardest for the victory of peace over violence 
in Northern Ireland.'' ``We have drawn attention to the fact that 
some nationalists have turned down honors because we did not want 
the people of Northern Ireland to think that only one side had been 
honored for their role in the peace process.'' There were honors, 
too, for police, medical staff and local officials in Omagh, Northern 
Ireland, for their work after the Aug. 15 bomb that killed 29 people 
and wounded 370. There is also a knighthood for Ronnie Flanagan, the 
chief constable of Northern Ireland's Royal Ulster Constabulary. Gareth 
Peirce, a lawyer who helped win the release in 1989 of the Irish ``Guildford 
Four'' who were wrongly convicted of Irish Republican Army offenses, 
gets a CBE, of Commander of the Order of British Empire. Honors were 
distributed to people in all walks of life. Actor Nigel Hawthorne, 
who played the king in ``The Madness of King George,'' becomes a knight 
_ just like Sir Humphrey Appleby, the character he played in the popular 
television series ``Yes, Minister.'' Robert Carlyle, who has acieved 
recent fame in the movies ``Trainspotting'' and ``The Full Monty,'' 
is made an OBE, or Officer of the Order of British Empire _ one notch 
below the CBE award. Pop music veterans Tom Jones and Dusty Springfield 
also get OBEs, and actor Roger Moore gets a CBE for his work on behalf 
of UNICEF, the United Nations children's fund. Actress and comedian 
Maureen Lipmann, one of Britain's most popular television and stage 
performers, wins a CBE. Conductor Andrew Davis received a knighthood, 
and playwright Ronald Harwood _ author of ``The Dresser'' and ``Poison 
Pen,'' gets a CBE. Duncan Kenworthy, producer of the hit movie ``Four 
Weddings and a Funeral,'' also receives an OBE.
