In a symbolic _ if futile _ move, a Libyan prosecutor on Wednesday 
ordered the arrest of nine American officials allegedly behind the 
1986 bombing of two Libyan cities, Egypt's Middle East News Agency 
reported. Among those on the list is William Casey, the late director 
of the CIA. The announcement came as Libya is maneuvering over American 
and British demands that two Libyan suspects be turned over for trial 
in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet that killed 
270 people. MENA said that the prosecutor, Mohammed Abdel-Wahab, announced 
the arrest orders at a news conference at the People's Court in the 
Libyan capital Tripoli. In addition to Casey, Abdel-Wahab gave the 
names of a number of American pilots as well as former National Security 
Adviser John Poindexter and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North. The prosecutor 
said that if Libya failed to secure their arrest, ``it will resort 
to (U.N.) Security Council to get the accused,'' MENA said. Former 
U.S. President Ronald Reagan ordered an air attack on Libya in 1986 
in retaliation for the bombing of a Berlin discotheque in which two 
U.S. servicemen were killed. Libya said 37 people, including an adopted 
daughter of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, were killed in the attack 
on Tripoli and the port of Benghazi. Reagan's name was not on the 
list released by Libya, according to the MENA report. The United States 
and Britain have demanded that Libya turn over two suspects in the 
bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. They have said 
that if Libya does not do so, they will ask the Security Council to 
expand sanctions against Libya.
