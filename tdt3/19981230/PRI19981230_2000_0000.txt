From Public Radio International, this is "The World." A co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH Boston. It's Wednesday, December 
30th. I'm Lisa Mullens in Boston. Today Cambodia's King says he opposes 
amnesty for two Kamir Rouge leaders. Also, to understand what Europe 
has to do to convert to the euro by Monday, imagine you're a grocery 
store owner faced with overnight changes and food labeling laws. You 
would have to take every single -- and pack if off the shelf and take 
off the existing label and put a new one on and put it back on the 
shelf, ready for Monday morning customers. That's the sort of scale 
-- why we have such a big problem. First up, this news.
