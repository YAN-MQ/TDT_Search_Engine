The mother of the Houston octuplets is back home today after three 
months in the hospital. In her first public appearance, nkem chukwu 
says it wasn't easy to give birth to eight babies, but she did it 
for love. They are great boys and girls. Even when I saw them for 
the first time, I was so amazed what God blessed me with. I'm just 
like you. I wanted to go and be like you. The seven surviving babies 
remain in critical but stable condition at a Texas hospital. Four 
of them are breathing on their own. The others are on ventilators. 
Doctors say if all goes well, they could be sent home in a couple 
months. The smallest, a girl, died Sunday of lung and heart failure.
