A federal judge Wednesday denied an attempt to force the National 
Basketball Association to provide clearance for three players to join 
teams in Europe, instead sending them to an arbitrator to negotiate 
the matter. The players _ Nick Van Exel of the Denver Nuggets, Marcus 
Camby of the New York Knicks and Reggie Slater of the Toronto Raptors 
_ claim they are being prohibited from playing in Europe because the 
NBA, along with USA Basketball, will not give them unconditional releases 
to play overseas. While the NBA says players are free to play during 
the lockout, they will have to return to play for the NBA if the season 
begins. That means they fall short of the ``unconditional'' clearance 
required to play in Europe under an agreement between the FIBA, a 
governing body for European basketball, and the NBA. Judge Sim Lake 
boiled the matter down to one issue: whether the individual Uniform 
Player Contracts remain in force despite the 183-day lockout by owners. 
``That sole, precise legal issue,'' Lake said, ``the continued validity 
of the players' contracts with the teams _ is a matter required to 
be arbitrated by the plaintiff's Uniform Player Contract, the CBA 
and the March 14, 1997, agreement between the NBA and the FIBA.'' 
In deciding the case, Lake found no irreparable damage to the three 
players, who claimed they were being damaged as a result of wages 
lost because they were not allowed to play in Europe. According to 
sports agents who testified during the hearing, a team in Athens is 
willing to pay Van Exel as much as $2.5 million to play the last four 
months of the European Cup season, and other teams are waiting in 
the wings to make offers to Camby and Slater. James Bryant, a lawyer 
and representative for the three players, contacted the players association 
in an attempt to locate the arbitrator who handled grievances under 
the collective bargaining agreement that was terminated on June 30, 
1998. ``If someone can decide whether these contracts are ongoing 
_ yes or no _ we have a victory,'' Bryant said.
