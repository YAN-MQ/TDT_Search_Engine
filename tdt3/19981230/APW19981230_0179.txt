King Norodom Sihanouk refused Wednesday to approve amnesty for two 
leaders of the genocidal Khmer Rouge, setting up a collision course 
with his prime minister, who has pledged to shield them from trial. 
The refusal undermines a deal Prime Minister Hun Sen has struck with 
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea to allow them to defect and give up to 
his government with assurances they will not be tried for their roles 
in the deaths of as many as 2 million people. ``Taking into account 
the very wide and undeniable discontent of the majority of the Khmer 
people, I announce to this majority that I respect them and will not 
renew my power of amnesty for major Khmer Rouge criminals,'' the king 
said. Sihanouk, 76, receiving medical treatment for several ailments 
in Beijing, made the comments in his palace bulletin. However, Hun 
Sen is Cambodia's most powerful man and his will amounts to law. He 
controls the judiciary and security services and could simply accord 
the pair a de facto pardon, possibly through the pliant court system. 
The popular king's stance will make a pardon less legitimate in the 
eyes of the world and many Cambodians. But Sihanouk is largely a figurehead 
and has no way to enforce his will. The Khmer Rouge won a civil war 
in 1975 and turned the country into a huge slave labor camp. One person 
in five perished of overwork, starvation, disease and systematic executions. 
They were ousted by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979 but waged a long 
guerrilla war. Two years ago, the government pressured a reluctant 
Sihanouk to break the stalemate by granting amnesty to a Khmer Rouge 
chieftain, Ieng Sary, in exchange for making peace. Ieng Sary led 
thousands of guerrillas out of combat and the movement is now all 
but extinct. Many now question Hun Sen's assertion that amnesty is 
needed for Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea to prevent a slide back into 
civil war. Sihanouk said that an international tribunal would have 
``the perfect right to take up the case of genocide in Cambodia, because 
it concerns crimes against humanity.'' ``From now on, I leave all 
the responsibility to Hun Sen of handling this unfortunate and dramatic 
affair of pardons accorded to the Khmer Rouge,'' Sihanouk said. ``I 
will sign no more decrees concerning the Khmer Rouge.'' Khieu Samphan 
and Nuon Chea, both members of the inner circle of the late Khmer 
Rouge leader Pol Pot, have basked in VIP treatment at a luxury hotel 
since coming to Phnom Penh on Tuesday to cement their deal with Hun 
Sen. Ieng Sary is with them. Their families are touring the temples 
and palaces of a capital emptied at gunpoint in 1975, when the Khmer 
Rouge forced Cambodians into rural slave labor camps. Visits to the 
historic Angkor complex, their home provinces and a seaside resort 
are also planned. Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea told a news conference 
Tuesday they were ``very sorry'' for the Khmer Rouge terror but refused 
to accept personal responsibility. Khieu Samphan said: ``Let bygones 
be bygones.'' Eam Chan, 55, one of the handful of survivors from the 
infamous Tuol Sleng torture center where perhaps 20,000 people were 
brutalized before being executed, said the apology can't erase his 
suffering. Accused of being a U.S. spy, Eam Chan was subjected to 
daily torture by electroshock and asphyxiation. ``The Cambodian people 
cannot forget that so easily,'' Eam Chan said. ``As a victim, my mind 
cannot be at rest without seeing the prosecution of these people, 
because the suffering was indescribable.'' On Wednesday, Khieu Samphan 
met Boutros Boutros-Ghali, former United Nations secretary general, 
who is in Cambodia to promote the French language as head of the International 
Francophone Organization. The Cambodia Daily newspaper quoted Boutros-Ghali 
as saying Tuesday that he did not support the formation of an international 
tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge leaders. That clashes with the mission 
of a U.N. team dispatched by the present secretary-general, Kofi Annan, 
to Cambodia recently to assess the possibility of creating such a 
tribunal. ``My personal view is that this is a Cambodian problem,'' 
Boutros-Ghali was quoted as saying. ``The U.N. should not interfere 
in the affairs of member countries.''
