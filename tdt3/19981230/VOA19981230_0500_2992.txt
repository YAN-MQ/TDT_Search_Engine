The Bank of Japan says it hopes for a smooth takeoff for the launch 
of the euro on January 1. On December 31st, the European Union Council 
will adopt conversion rates set by the European commission for the 
euro. Once those rates are set, financial institutions will convert 
prices of European shares and bonds into the euro and reprogram computers 
to cope with the switch over. Currency dealers in Japan say they prepared 
for months for this moment and don't anticipate any problems.
