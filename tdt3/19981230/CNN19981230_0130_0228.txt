Tuesday Mr. Clinton announced an initiative designed to fight violence 
against children. He wants the definition of murder changed to include 
the death of a child following a pattern of abuse. Mr. Clinton says 
violence against children can create violent adults. Children's exposure 
to violence has tremendous Negative consequences for them and for 
all the rest of us. A child who experiences serious violence is 50% 
-- 50% more likely to be arrested as a juvenile, and nearly 40% more 
likely to be arrested as an adult. If you want to keep the crime rates 
going down, you have to do more to break the cycle of violence to 
which children are exposed. The president also announced plans for 
a justice department summit on children and violence next year.
