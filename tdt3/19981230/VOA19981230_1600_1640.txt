For many of our FM and medium wave listeners, your local stations 
will be taking a two-minute break at this time. This is VOA News Now. 
Today is Wednesday, December 30th, 1998. We're almost at the end of 
the year, aren't we? On this date in 1936, members of the United Automobile 
Workers Union began one of the first successful sit down strikes in 
United States labor history. Workers at the General Motors parts factory 
in Flint, Michigan struck to gain company recognition of their new 
union. Forty thousand workers stayed at their places in the factory 
but refused to work. The 44-day strike ended when General Motors agreed 
to recognize the United Automobile Workers Union as the sole representative 
of all employees in its factories. On this date in 1940, officials 
of the California Transportation Department and Los Angeles led the 
dedication ceremony for the completion of the city's first freeway, 
which is a limited access highway. About 1500 people attended the 
traditional ribbon-cutting for the seven kilometer extension of the 
A oyo Seco Parkway. The 15-1/2 kilometers of roadway connected the 
city of Pasadena with downtown Los Angeles. At 21 meters in width, 
it allowed for three lanes of traffic in each direction. The parkway 
got its name from the A oyo Seco, a dry riverbed that ran parallel 
to it. The famous Rose Bowl sports stadium in Pasadena was also built 
along the A oyo Seco. Today, Los Angeles is famous for its freeways 
with nearly 1,000 kilometers of limited access multi-lane highways.
