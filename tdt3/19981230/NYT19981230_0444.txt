Richard Fischbein, a self-styled high-powered Manhattan lawyer, and 
Angelo &AMP; Maxie's, a self-styled fashionable Manhattan restaurant, 
announced Wednesday the settlement of Fischbein's multimillion dollar 
lawsuit that arose out of the restaurant's attempt to make him pay 
a $353.79 tip. Fischbein had said the restaurant's service for a Nov. 
17 staff dinner _ totaling $2,481.44 _ was abysmal. He refused to 
pay the restaurant's mandatory 18 percent service charge for large 
parties, though he tipped one attentive waitress $100. The restaurant 
detained Fischbein and called police. On Dec. 2, Fischbein sued, alleging 
slander and false imprisonment. The case seemed to strike a sympathetic 
chord among people skeptical of the notion that tips are a birthright 
of restaurant workers, no matter the quality of the service. Fischbein 
said he had received dozens of letters of support from around the 
country. Under the settlement, the restaurant and the lawyer each 
agreed to pay $10,000 to the Children's Aid Society, one of Fischbein's 
favorite charities. The restaurant, a steakhouse and cigar bar at 
233 Park Ave. South, also issued an apology, of sorts, saying it was 
sorry ``for any misunderstanding.'' Richard Wolf, an owner of the 
restaurant, declined to comment, citing the terms of the agreement. 
Fischbein, 56, a veteran litigator, said he, too, could not talk about 
the lawsuit, except to say the nationwide response had been ``mind 
boggling.''
