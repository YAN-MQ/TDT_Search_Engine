Jordan's King Hussein has left the hospital in the U.S. state of Minnesota 
after successfully completing more than five months of treatment for 
cancer. The king's younger brother, Crown Prince Hassan, brought a 
letter from the king saying his treatment for lymphoma had gone much 
better than expected. He will have to return to the clinic in March 
for medical tests. Last month, King Hussein said doctors found no 
trace of cancer in his lymph nodes. The 63-year-old monarch plans 
to spend several days in Washington while he regains his strength. 
He will also get some R&R in London before returning to Amman.
