Why Screens Seem to `Roll' Q. Whenever a computer monitor is shown 
on television, why is there a line or streak that appears to roll 
down the monitor? A. The National Television System Committee standard 
for recording is about 30 frames per second, so videotape is recorded 
at that speed. Ordinary computer monitors, which contain internal 
electron guns that illuminate the phosphor-coated glass to create 
the image, refresh their screens at a different rate. Monitor refresh 
rates are measured in hertz, or cycles per second, and rates of 60, 
67 and 75 hertz are most common. If you have a 60-hertz computer monitor, 
that means it is redrawing the picture you see on the screen 60 times 
each second. When you see a computer monitor on television and you 
notice that rolling line or flickering, you are seeing the refresh 
rate for the monitor, which is out of synch by a fraction of a second 
with the frame rate for the video camera. Computer monitors refreshing 
at a rate of 75 hertz have the most noticeable streaking on the television 
screen. Displays running at 60 hertz (refreshing roughly twice for 
each video frame) look the best on television. ``On the 67-hertz machine, 
you can see the variation,'' said Amy Morang, a support technician 
at Radius, a maker of computer monitors and digital video products. 
``The gun position will be at a different place at each frame, so 
it `rolls.''' Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology,
