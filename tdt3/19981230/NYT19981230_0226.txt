There has been combat in the air during this holiday season and heightened 
tension at airport security check-ins. I refer not to the sorties 
against Iraq but to new airline carry-on baggage policies. United 
Airlines and Delta, especially, have been strictly limiting carry-ons 
to two _ and on busy flights, just one _ each item no larger than 
22 by 14 by 9 inches, or ``45 linear inches'' in airline lingo. The 
linear inch _ as opposed to the circular inch? _ is a measure unfamiliar 
to most travelers. Translated into three dimensions, the numbers represent 
a box of less than two cubic feet _ but with plenty of room for dogfights 
among airlines and luggage manufacturers. The day after the attack 
on Baghdad began, for instance, ``templates,'' or ``sizers'' went 
into place in front of X-ray machines at Denver International Airport, 
as at others across the country. Waiting lines quickly grew long _ 
up to 50 linear feet, I estimated at one point. The new standards 
require luggage designers to think inside the box _ and an oblong 
and somewhat awkward box it is. In any business, new standards can 
change designs radically. Consider the car companies, faced with safety 
and energy regulations, or camera makers, reinventing point-and-shoots 
to fit advanced photo system film cartridges. For baggage, the goal 
of the standards is admirable enough. By cutting down on carry-ons, 
especially bulky garment bags, the airlines aim to speed loading, 
so planes take off on schedule. The rules are also intended to reduce 
injuries caused by bags dropped from bins. These rules, however, are 
set not by the Federal Aviation Administration but by individual airlines. 
For years, there has been a rough correspondence among them, at least 
on paper. The difference was in the degree of enforcement. For years, 
laxity prevailed. Then last spring, United and Delta, both airlines 
working to improve on-time ratings, decided to get tough. In a local 
test, United found that stricter enforcement of carry-on limits increased 
on-time performance. But Continental, which had just added a new clutch 
of larger-bin 777 airliners to its fleet, wanted no part of efforts 
to curb ``bin hogs.'' It protested when United added templates at 
the airport in San Diego _ and benefited from the resulting publicity. 
The Flight Attendants Association, its members tired of dealing with 
passengers whose anger at carry-on policies is one element of the 
wider phenomenon known as ``air rage,'' has appealed to the government 
for an industrywide standard. Luggage designers agree. ``It's tough 
when one or two powerful airlines make a unilateral decision,'' said 
Chad Mellen, vice president for marketing at the luggage maker Tumi, 
based in Middlesex, N.J. ``It's like G.M. telling the tire companies 
all of a sudden that its tires will now be 10 feet tall.'' But Mellen 
said: ``The new standards have become our bible. Our three commandments 
are 22, 14 and 9.'' Myron Glaser of Glaser Designs, a custom designer 
and manufacturer of luggage in San Francisco, was able to respond 
more quickly than larger manufacturers. ``Beat the two-bag limit,'' 
his ads trumpet. His Litigation bag, at 22 inches, will hold a laptop, 
files, two shirts and a suit, Glaser says. It will also lighten your 
wallet by more than $1,000. Early in the summer, Tumi began a rush 
program to adapt its most popular styles. The first result, Tumi's 
model 22-65, went on sale in late October. It has been especially 
successful in Chicago, a United hub, and Atlanta, Delta's home. Four 
or five other models will be introduced in February. So far, as in 
Tumi's case, much of the adjustment has had to do with simply shrinking 
bags, but more radical changes in design lie ahead. The design firm 
Frogdesign is at work on luggage incorporating new shapes and features 
for high-tech travelers. Today's high-tech road warriors may travel 
with 20 or 30 pounds worth of laptop, cell phone, digital assistant 
and other equipment. The new policies also seem likely to strengthen 
the tendency to combine briefcase and overnight bag into one unit. 
Mellen also sees more casual luggage designs coming _ possibly even 
backpacks for executives on the road. And the effects may not be limited 
to luggage itself. Fashion could be changed: Glaser sees a need for 
clothing manufacturers to adapt microfibers for lighter, thinner packing. 
Eventually, road warriors are likely to be as carefully prepacked 
into their cube and two-thirds as members of the 82d Airborne, alert 
for rapid deployment.
