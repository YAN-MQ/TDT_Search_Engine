A gang of armed men killed three police officers in Uzbekistan and 
then tried to flee into neighboring Turkmenistan, killing three border 
officers who tried to stop them, a news agency reported Wednesday. 
One suspect was later arrested in Uzbekistan, and two other suspects 
were identified but not captured, Interfax said, quoting the Turkmen 
National Security Committee. The presidents of the two Central Asian 
countries ordered the creation of a joint police task force to investigate 
the crimes. According to authorities, the first shooting occurred 
Tuesday when Uzbek police stopped a group of armed men in the Khorezm 
region of Uzbekistan, which lies on the Turkmen border. After killing 
the three officers, the gunmen tried to enter Turkmenistan at the 
Gazodzhak checkpoint. In the resulting clash, two Turkmen border guards 
and one customs officer died, authorities said. It was not clear when 
the second shootout took place, or why the men had been stopped by 
police in the first place.
