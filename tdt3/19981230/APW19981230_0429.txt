A journalist's account and a statement by an Islamic group received 
Wednesday in Dubai challenge the Yemeni government's story of how 
four Western hostages were killed in the country's south. After the 
shootout Tuesday, a Yemeni Interior Ministry statement said troops 
opened fire after the kidnappers, who were members of a radical Islamic 
group, began killing some of the 16 Western hostages they were holding. 
But a Yemeni journalist who spoke to the Dubai bureau of The Associated 
Press and a statement from the group Aden's Islamic Army both suggest 
Yemeni soldiers opened fire without warning in an apparent attempt 
to rescue the hostages. ``The army and security forces started the 
indiscriminate attack on the area where the hostages were being held 
using all kinds of weapons, including heavy weapons, without any warning 
or notice,'' said the statement from the group, believed to be an 
offshoot of Islamic Jihad, which held the hostages. The journalist 
_ who spoke on condition of anonymity _ said he talked with some of 
the freed hostages who said they were taken by surprise when grenades 
suddenly were tossed at them and then their captors fired back. ``Some 
of us were injured by the grenades and others in the crossfire,'' 
the journalist quoted one of the freed Westerners as saying. A member 
of the al-Fadl tribe, to which the kidnappers belonged, also said 
Wednesday that after the shootout started, some of the kidnappers 
tried to escape using the hostages as human shields. Four hostages 
died and two were wounded during the siege near the southern town 
of Mawdiyah, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) south of the capital 
San`a. The remaining 10 hostages were freed unharmed, and three of 
the captors were killed.
