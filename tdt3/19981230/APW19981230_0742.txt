Four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni tribesmen were set free on Wednesday, 
three and a half weeks after they were taken into captivity, Yemeni 
security officials said. They said the four _ three women and a man 
_ were in good condition and were on their way to the Yemeni capital 
San`a. The officials spoke on customary condition of anonymity. There 
was no information on whether the government had agreed to the kidnappers' 
demands for better public services. The release of the Germans came 
a day after Yemeni security forces confronted Islamic militant tribesmen 
holding 16 Western hostages. Four of the captives _ three Britons 
and an Australian _ died in the melee. After the killings, German 
diplomats appealed to Yemeni authorities not to attempt to rescue 
the four Germans who were held by a different tribe in a different 
part of the country, Yemeni officials said Wednesday. Three Bani Dhabyan 
gunmen abducted the Germans on Dec. 7 in Marib province, which is 
170 kilometers (105 miles) southeast of San`a. The Germans were believed 
to be en route to San`a after a trip through central Yemen when they 
were taken. The Bani Dhabyan pressed the government to provide more 
schools, hospitals, telephone lines and roads for their region. German 
officials had expressed concern about the hostages, especially a woman 
who reportedly was ill. A Yemeni newspaper identified them as Norbert 
Degen, Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The embassy 
has not confirmed the names. They apparently were treated with care. 
They were allowed to walk for about 45 minutes a day, but only accompanied 
by armed men. And the tribesmen provided them at least once with a 
mobile phone so they could call the German Embassy in San`a. Tribal 
leaders said that the hostages received medicine for Brunner, who 
is 64 and apparently suffers from high blood pressure, along with 
Christmas gifts of chocolates and cigarettes from the embassy. Kidnappings 
occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are controlled by 
armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to take the law into their own 
hands to get their demands fulfilled. The hostages are usually treated 
well and released unhurt. In April, members of the same tribe freed 
British hostages after the government promised to build more roads 
in the area and return a four-wheel drive vehicle that was seized 
in March.
