That is "Nightly News" for this Wednesday. Don't forget "Dateline" 
NBC tonight at 8:00, 7:00 central. I hope to see you later tonight 
on the news on cable on MSNBC at 9:00 and again on CNBC at 10:00. 
Among our guests tonight, Norman Schwarzkopf and Jesse Jackson. I'm 
Brian Williams. Good night.
