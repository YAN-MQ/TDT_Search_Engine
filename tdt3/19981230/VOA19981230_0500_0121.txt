Cambodia's Norodom Sihanouk has refused to grant amnesty to former 
senior Khmer Rouge leaders who defected to the government last week. 
Reporter Hugh Watkins speculates on what happens next. Well, that's 
the big question, I suppose. I mean, this is not actually unprecedented. 
These guys are the most senior that have come across, but we have 
a rather large number of mass murderers living comfortable lives in 
Cambodia as we speak. One individual in particular, a guy by the name 
of Kapoch, he's implicated by vast volumes of evidence in what was 
called the purge of the East in 1978 in which literally hundreds of 
thousands of people were executed because of their perceived loyalty 
to Vietnam rather than Phnom Penh. And that is just one example. There's 
at least 15, 16 senior Khmer Rouge speakers who survived and who at 
this stage look no closer to being caught or accounted for the terrible 
things that they're responsible for during the 1970s. Reporter Hugh 
Watkin. The king's refusal to grant amnesty cast doubt on the legitimacy 
of assurances by Prime Minister Hun Sen that the two men will not 
be tried for crimes against humanity. At a news conference Tuesday 
in Phnom Penh, Ku Som Ponh and Huan Chia apologized for the atrocities 
of their brutal regime in the late 1970s.
