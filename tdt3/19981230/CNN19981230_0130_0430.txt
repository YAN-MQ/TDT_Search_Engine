An Oklahoma grand jury will submit its report on the bombing of the 
Murrah federal building Wednesday. The grand jury has spent a year 
and a half interviewing witnesses about a Possible conspiracy and 
cover-up. Three people have been sentenced in connection with the 
bombing. But a former state lawmaker says the government knew about 
the attack beforehand. Oklahoma's attorney general says that's unlikely 
and doubts the grand jury will report any new evidence.
