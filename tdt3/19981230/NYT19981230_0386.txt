The half-million revelers expected to gather in Times Square on Thursday 
night may not realize it, but they will really be attending a dress 
rehearsal. Yes, the brand-new music and sound effects, the 16-foot-tall 
puppet of Father Time, the three video screens, the 27 extra spotlights 
(including what is billed as the ``the most powerful searchlight in 
the world''), even the extra half ton of confetti, are all part of 
a dry run for New Year's Eve 1999. Or, as the event's promoters like 
to put it, ``Times Square 2000, the Global Celebration at the Crossroads 
of the World.'' With a name like that, next year's event had better 
be an extravaganza _ and no producers in their right minds would try 
to put on such a show without at least a trial run. Which is what 
Thursday night's festivities will be, said Brendan Sexton, president 
of the Times Square Business Improvement District, which is organizing 
the festivities along with Countdown Entertainment. ``We're going 
to use it to test some things,'' he said. Take, for example, that 
giant Father Time, which was designed by Michael Curry, who made the 
puppets used in ``The Lion King'' on Broadway. The puppet, which is 
24 feet long and requires eight handlers, is supposed to drift through 
the crowd carrying an illuminated hourglass. Basically, it will be 
taken through safety lanes that the police keep clear _ and it is 
the police who will determine, in large part, if the experiment is 
a success, Sexton said. ``If it works out, maybe we'll have more than 
one'' puppet next year, he added. The biggest innovation is probably 
the music and sound effects, which will be broadcast starting a little 
after 10:30 p.m. from speakers mounted on 10 buildings. The tunes 
on the play list remain a secret; ``I can't tell you everything,'' 
Sexton said, relenting only enough to describe the selections as international 
and instrumental. But don't wait to hear ``Auld Lang Syne'' at midnight; 
the music is to be turned off by 11:45 to focus attention on the roar 
of the crowd. In hopes that the throngs will be able to see more than 
the back of someone's head, the producers are setting up three huge 
video screens, two more than last year, on which they will broadcast 
the festivities. Next year, the producers promise, such screens will 
dot the entire neighborhood. Organizers hope next year to use the 
music and video screens to mark the turn of the century in each time 
zone around the world, with appropriate local selections, sights and 
sound effects. Manhattan, of course, will represent Eastern Standard 
Time; the party will not conclude until Hawaii enters the year 2000, 
five hours after New York. Some calendar sticklers, nit-pickers and 
party poopers may insist that 2001 is really the start of the millennium, 
but New York will not wait to hold what Sexton called ``the biggest 
party ever in recorded history ever.'' This year's crowd may be relatively 
small by comparison with the hordes expected next year, but nevertheless, 
100,000 more people are expected to attend Thursday night's festivities 
than showed up last year, according to the Times Square business group. 
In some ways, Thursday night's celebration will be much like those 
of years past, only more so. Much more so. Last year, volunteers dumped 
only three tons of special Times Square confetti _ it is bigger, of 
course _ out of windows; this year, they will hurl three and a half 
tons down on the crowd (among those credited with this production 
is a ``confetti master'' named Treb Heining). And while balloons have 
long been a feature of the party scene _ along with Mylar pom-poms 
and leis _ 15,000 of them will be distributed this year to the crowd, 
which is supposed to fling them into the air at midnight. Last year, 
a mere 16 spotlights lighted up the sky; this year, there will be 
42, Sexton said, plus the giant 50 kilowatt ``space cannon,'' which 
can apparently be seen from other galaxies (hint to little green guys: 
focus your telescopes on 42nd Street just south of One Times Square). 
And while pyrotechnic displays have added excitement to previous shows, 
this year they are to be longer (45 seconds, starting at the stroke 
of midnight) and bigger (atop three buildings _ One Times Square, 
1500 Broadway and 1501 Broadway). These are not real fireworks, but 
rather the theatrical explosions one might see at Beauty and the Beast, 
Sexton said, adding that though they are perfectly safe, ``The Fire 
Department does stand there while we do this.'' And why would New 
Yorkers want to spend hours jammed into a space with all the amenities 
of the Lexington Avenue subway at rush hour _ especially with below-freezing 
temperatures expected. They don't, for the most part. About 85 percent 
of the revelers are from out of town, according to a study done in 
1995 by the Times Square business district. And those tourists spend 
almost $24 million, which helps explain why (in addition to bragging 
rights) the city is willing to play host to such a gigantic bash. 
The property owners around Times Square have an economic incentive, 
too _ the more people who see their billboards, the more they can 
charge advertisers to use them. One Times Square, which is the chief 
sponsor of the event along with the BID, has pretty much evolved into 
a billboard in building form. It is also where the ball drops, and 
Sexton has reassuring words about that. When Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
and Sang Lan, the Chinese gymnast injured in the Goodwill Games last 
summer, push the button one minute before midnight, the ball will 
be the now-traditional one that looks like a huge disco light _ not 
a big apple. (Nor will a new ball that has been commissioned for the 
new century look like a piece of fruit.) ``In fact, that was only 
one year, in the 1980s,'' Sexton said of the apple experiment. ``And 
everyone agreed it was hokey and tacky. We immediately reverted to 
the ball.''
