The Chinese government is cracking down on foreign-based dissidents 
who sneak back into the country. The Hong Kong based human rights 
group says a long exiled Chinese dissident who slipped back into China 
through Macao will stand trial for endangering state security. The 
Information Center of Human Rights and Democracy in China says Wangs 
Sa sent a letter to his family asking them to hire a lawyer. The arrest 
of Mr. Wong follows the sentencing without trial on Tuesday of two 
U.S. based dissidents to three years in a labor camp. In his statement, 
China's foreign minister says Jiang Weng and Huay Kong Bo were detained 
last month in the southern city of Guang Jo after they admitted to 
entering the country hiding in trucks. The detentions are part of 
a crackdown on political dissent that have seen four other activists 
tried and sentenced in the past week.
