This is "The World." I'm Lisa Mullens. The lines have been as long 
as ever at stores this week, with folks returning their Chia pets, 
Tornado mixers, pocket fishermen and other Christmas presents that 
fell short of expectations. "The World" on the cutting edge, as ever, 
was curious to know what people will be bringing back to the stores 
next year around this time. So we asked corespondent Lucy Kraft who 
works in the gadget capital of the world, Tokyo, what the hot consumer 
products are these days in Japan. You're a major bicycle manufacturer, 
but the recession and cheap Chinese imports are killing your business. 
What do you do? Most companies are adding amenities, like double suspension 
and battery-powered pedals to take the effort out of cycling. But 
Owisaka -based National Cycle took a different approach. It decided 
to make its bikes harder to ride. Sales manager Osamo Yamakido offered 
a test drive of the new Rodeo. All right. Ready, set, go. With it's 
elongated handlebars, it looks a little like those banana bikes, popular 
a generation ago. But the resemblance ends there. The Rodeo's small 
wheels and sharply angled front fork defy easy balancing. All right. 
Ready, set, go. One more time. The Rodeo comes in easy, hard and super-hard 
models. And even on the trainer model, riding is impossible for novices. 
Sales manager, Yamakido explained what possessed the company's design 
department when it created a bicycle so dangerous the company received 
complaints from police. OSAMO YAMAKIDO, sales manager, national . 
Yes, regular bicycles are designed for comfort and easy of riding. 
But we like to think of this not so much as a bike, but actually a 
game inside a bicycle's body. So far, about 1,000 Rodeos have been 
sold, mostly to surfer and skateboard types who don't mind bikes that 
come with a warning label.
