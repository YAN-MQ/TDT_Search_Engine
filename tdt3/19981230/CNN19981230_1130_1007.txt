Wall Street nears the end of another robust year on an upswing. I'm 
Deborah Marchini. The Dow Jones industrial starts the day just 55 
points shy of their all-time high. The Dow has posted gains for eight 
straight sessions so far this year, the blue decks index is up more 
than 17%, nothing compared to the S&P 500. That index may be more 
important to the Dow to the growing number of investors who put their 
money into mutual funds.
