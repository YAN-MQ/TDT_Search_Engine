Russian President Boris Yeltsin has ordered his prime minister and 
other officials to prepare a program to combat political and religious 
extremism. The Kremlin says the two-year plan against extremism will 
go into effect March 1st. Russia currently has no law against inciting 
political or religious hatred. Several Communist lawmakers have been 
criticized for recent anti-Semitic statements.
