While a DNA expert said in court that seminal fluid stains on a mattress 
belonged to jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim, hundreds of people gathered 
outside to rally support for their fallen leader. Many waited in the 
compound of a neighboring mosque. Still others lined the opposite 
side of the riverbank flanking the red-bricked courthouse. Police 
holding 5-foot rattan canes cordoned off the back entrance of the 
courtroom where Anwar was expected to be brought out after the day's 
proceedings ended. They began waving and shouting ``Reformasi'' _ 
the rallying cry of Anwar's fledgling reform movement _ as the wife 
of Anwar's private secretary, Shamsidar Taharin, walked out of the 
courtroom and was driven away. Shamsidar is alleged to have been one 
of Anwar's sex partners. ``The police planted the DNA evidence,'' 
said a 26-year-old man who asked not to be named, as he waved to Shamsidar, 
who was accompanied by her husband. ``Anwar is innocent. Our spirits 
will never give up.'' He said he dashed to the courthouse that afternoon 
to show support for Anwar after hearing rumors that a state DNA expert 
testified that several of the mattress stains contained DNA from Anwar 
mixed with DNA from Shamsidar. Minutes later, the crowd's sporadic 
cries became loud chants of ``Long live Anwar!'' as police hustled 
Malaysia's former No. 2 out of the courtroom and bundled him into 
a blue jeep that whisked him back to a prison south the capital. The 
cheers continued as Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail and daughter came 
out and went near the river. Azizah held a thumbs up to the air, shook 
her fist and smiled. As they drove off, Nurul Izzah, Anwar's 18-year-old 
daughter, popped out from the family car's sun roof and joined in 
their cries of ``reformasi.'' Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamad on Sept. 2 after he was deemed morally unfit to lead the country. 
Police arrested Anwar eighteen days later after he organized a mammoth 
anti-government protest in the capital. He is currently facing trial 
for abuse of power and will be tried separately on charges of engaging 
in illegal sex acts, including sodomy. Anwar has denied all the accusations 
against him, saying they were trumped up to undermine his challenge 
to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
