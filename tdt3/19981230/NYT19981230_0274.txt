Carousing chilled and inebriated in Times Square is a popular option 
for many people who usher in the New Year on this side of the Atlantic 
Ocean. In Scotland, an equally enthusiastic celebration called Hogmanay 
is observed. Several Web sites are devoted to an explanation of the 
holiday's customs, and a page on the Essential Scotland site (www.caithness-mm.co.uk/discover/essential/esshogm.html) 
features personal observations about the celebration. The Hogmanay 
Web sites are just part of a growing number of sites devoted to Scotland 
and all things Scottish. Hogmanay is a traditional New Year's Eve 
celebration filled with dances, parties and plenty of alcohol. On 
the surface, it sounds like any other Dec. 31 party. But the history 
of the holiday, as explained on the Hogmanay page on the Helpful Brother's 
site (wkweb1.cableinet.co.uk/sbooth/index2.htm) is interesting. Because 
Scots often had to work on Christmas and right up to Jan. 1, New Year's 
Eve naturally became the big event of the season. The origin of the 
curious name is also discussed by the Helpful Brothers site. ``It 
could be from the Anglo-Saxon `haleg monath,' which means `holy month,''' 
the site says. ``It could be from the Gaelic `oge maidne,' which means 
`new morning.' Some people also think that it could be from an Old 
French word meaning `gift,' as it was customary to give gifts at this 
time.'' One of the things that makes Hogmanay different from an average 
American New Year's party is the practice of ``first footing.'' After 
midnight, it is customary to leave one's house and visit friends and 
neighbors, carrying gifts of food and drink (like a bottle of whisky 
and a plate of shortbread) to insure a prosperous new year. It is 
also the convention to offer a small lump of coal along with the food 
to symbolize the hope that your hosts' house will have fuel throughout 
the coming year. Travelers in Edinburgh around the time of the holiday 
will discover that the city uses the occasion to throw a grand party. 
It also provides all the details at its Hogmanay site (www.edinburghshogmanay.org). 
New Year's Eve wouldn't be complete without a few heartfelt renditions 
of ``Auld Lang Syne,'' and in Scotland it is no different. The country 
also holds the bragging rights to the song lyrics, as it was Robert 
Burns who wrote them. The birth of Burns, in January 1759, is also 
celebrated less than a month later, on Jan. 25, in an observance known 
as Burns Night. The Bard of Scotland is also on the Web; two particularly 
good sites are devoted to him: the Robert Burns Tribute (www.rabbie-burns.com) 
and the Official Robert Burns Site (www.robertburns.org). The Tribute 
page has an attractive explanation of a Burns Night dinner, including 
the proper traditional graces recited and the arrival of the haggis 
_ a Scottish national dish of sheep's stomach stuffed with oatmeal 
and spices. If the thought of haggis does not upset your stomach and 
you want to know more about Scottish culture, odds are you can get 
your fill at the Scotweb site (www.scotweb.co.uk), a thorough collection 
of links for things like bagpipes, tartans, crafts and literature.
