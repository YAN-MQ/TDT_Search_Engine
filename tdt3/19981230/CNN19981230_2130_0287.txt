Arizona republican senator John McCain is taking the first formal 
steps toward a possible run for president in 2000. He's filing papers 
today with the federal election commission to form a presidential 
exploratory committee. Advisers say he will not announce his candidacy 
for several weeks. The 62-year-old McCain has served in the Senate 
since 1986.
