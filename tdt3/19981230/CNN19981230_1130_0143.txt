The impeachment trial could begin January 7th. Majority leader Trent 
Lott has proposed a ceremonial start January 7th, with the actual 
proceeding to start four days later. The questions of a timetable 
and whether witnesses will be permitted are up to the Senate. Senators 
from both parties have said they want to avoid a trial longer than 
several weeks. What I found breath-taking about the decision of the 
house was whether or not even lying to a grand jury, if that's what 
happened, whether or not that constituted a through the to our freedom 
of liberty and if that's an impeachable offense. I think in the Senate, 
you're not going to have 67 votes to remove the president. And I think 
we'll start out with a trial, but I do believe there is going to be 
a strong consensus for a very strong censure resolution. It should 
be expeditious and I agree with our leader that it can be. I wouldn't 
think it would need to take more than a week or two. It could take 
longer if the president felt it necessary to call witnesses on his 
behalf. My guess is it will be fairly short. Mr. Clinton faces two 
charges of impeachment.
