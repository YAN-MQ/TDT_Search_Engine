President Rauf Denktash on Wednesday approved a coalition government 
that promises to seek international recognition for the breakaway 
Turkish Cypriot state and remain in close cooperation with Turkey. 
Dervis Eroglu remains premier under a coalition partnership with a 
center-left party, led by Mustafa Akinci. Eroglu has led goverments 
on the Turkish side of the divided island of Cyprus since 1996. ``Our 
foreign policy is based on the integration of Turkish Cypriots with 
Turkey through a special relationship,'' the Turkish Cypriot news 
agency TAK quoted Denktash as saying. ``It appears that the new government 
will remain loyal to these principles.'' Cyprus has been split in 
two since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops after a coup by Greek Cypriots 
seeking union with Greece. The Turkish Cypriots declared their own 
state in 1983, which is recognized only by Turkey. U.N. efforts to 
reunify the island have failed and the Turkish Cypriots now insist 
on international recognition before talks can resume. Eroglu's center-right 
National Unity Party won 24 seats in the Dec 6. elections. Akinci's 
Salvation party has seven seats in the 50-member Parliament. Akinci 
is to serve as deputy premier in the 11-member Cabinet. Eroglu received 
40 percent of the votes in the elections, seen as voter approval for 
his hard-line stance on the future of his republic.
