France and Britain have joined international calls for two former 
Kamir Rouge leaders to stand trial for crimes against humanity. The 
man have recently defected to the Cambodian government. Earlier the 
country's King Noradam Sianuk said he won't grant the men amnesty. 
But Prime Minister Han Sen says he does not want them brought to trial. 
From Penam Penn Caroline Gluck reports. King Sianuk said his decision 
not to grant an amnesty for men he termed "criminals" had taken into 
account the wide and understandable discontent felt by most Cambodians. 
He also repeated his deport for a genocide tribunal. Even if the U.N. 
backs the idea of a tribunal, the plan would need the full backing 
of the Cambodian authorities. The Prime Minister's comments makes 
that prospect increasingly unlikely, even though many in the country 
are clamoring for justice to be seen to be done. Caroline Gluck reporting.
