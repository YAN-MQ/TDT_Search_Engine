Germany's Martin Schmitt Wednesday reaffirmed his dominance this year 
in ski jumping, outleaping Austria's Andreas Goldberger to capture 
the first of the Four Hills tournaments. The 20-year-old Schmitt compiled 
244.8 points, edging Goldberger at 242.8, to win his fifth event in 
seven outings this season. The sudden popularity of Schmitt in Germany, 
who has emerged from nowhere this season, lured 25,000 spectators 
to see the first event of the 47-year-old tournament. ``The mood here 
was crazy, it was fun,'' said Schmitt. ``I'm sure the attention will 
get even worse, but I think I know when to turn off.'' Japan's Noriaki 
Kasai finished third at 241.7 points while Andreas Widhoelzl faded 
to fourth after soaring 124.0 meters on his first leap. Schmitt's 
second clean jump of 115.5 meters, as a backwind died and dropped 
distances, thrust him into the lead. His first attempt had been 120.0. 
Wildhoelzl, leaping afterwards, failed to keep pace and flew only 
109.5 meters. ``He knew he had to jump at least 111, 112 meters. He 
probably put himself under too much pressure,'' said Schmitt. The 
other three events will be held at Garmisch-Partenkirchen on New Year's 
Day, Innsbruck on Jan. 3 and Bischofshofen on Jan. 6. The Four Hills 
tournament is regarded as ski jumping's most prestigious prize outside 
of the Olympics and world championships.
