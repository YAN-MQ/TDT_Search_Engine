In Argentina, the head of operations of a torture center under the 
country's military dictatorship has surrendered to authorities after 
two weeks in hiding. Correspondent George Meek reports from VOA's 
South America bureau. The arrest is the latest in a case involving 
illegal adoption of babies born to political prisoners. Retired Navy 
Commander Jorge Acosta surrendered at Navy headquarters with his lawyer 
to learn that he was discharged from the service Monday because of 
his status as a fugitive. Commander Acosta was in charge of a notorious 
torture center of a Navy mechanics school in Buenos Aires from 1976 
to 1978. Commander Acosta will be questioned in connection with the 
alleged systematic practice of taking newborn infants from political 
prisoners for adoption by military officers and then killing their 
mothers. Human rights groups have reunited 50 children with their 
natural families but several hundred others have not been found. Commander 
Acosta's arrest comes one day after the detention of retired Admiral 
Rueben Franco, the last head of the Navy under military rule. Four 
other senior military officials are under arrest in the baby snatching 
probe, including former president Jorge Vidala. The courts are pursuing 
the case because kidnapping of minors is not covered under Argentina's 
broad amnesty laws for crimes committed during the so-called dirty 
war against opponents of the military government which ended 15 years 
ago. Human rights groups say security forces killed tens of thousands 
of suspected leftists during the period. George Meek, VOA News, Rio 
de Janeiro.
