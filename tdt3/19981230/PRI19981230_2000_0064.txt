For "The World," I'm Derrick Stoffel in the BBC Newsroom in London. 
Iraq has fired missiles at British aircraft patrolling the no-fly 
zone in Southern Iraq. American jets responded, firing bombs and rockets 
at an Iraqi missile site. The Pentagon says all allied planes returned 
safely to base, but Iraq says one of the aircraft was almost certainly 
shot down. Iraq also says the planes fired missiles at an Iraqi village, 
killing a farmer and wounding two others -- claims the U.S. denies. 
Major Joe Lamarca of the U.S. central command describes the incident. 
We had coalition aircraft flying, Operation Southern Watch missions, 
when they detected the launch of six to eight surface-to-air missiles 
from a site in Southwest Iraq and then we responded to these unprovoked 
attacks by firing -- missiles and dropping 500- pound precision-guided 
munitions. Major Joe Lamarca.
