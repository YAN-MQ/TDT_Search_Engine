U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is proposing the Senate take 
its preliminary steps in the trial of President Clinton on January 
7th, one day after the new Senate convenes. Senator Lott suggests 
the full trial could start as early as January 11th and finish by 
January 22nd. But with a two-thirds vote to convict looking unlikely, 
several lawmakers are calling for censure instead of a trial.
