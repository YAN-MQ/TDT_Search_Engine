An avalanche struck a party of seven hikers on a mountain in northwest 
Scotland, killing four, police said Wednesday. Rescuers saved three 
survivors trapped in tons of snow. The hikers had been participating 
in ``winter skills'' training course on Aonoch Mor near Ben Nevis 
in the Scottish Highlands on Tuesday when they were caught in the 
avalanche at about 3,500 feet (900 meters) on the mountainside, police 
said. ``Rescuers spotted one of the survivors whose top half was showing, 
but it took another two hours to dig everyone else out,'' said police 
inspector Charles Ross. ``It is amazing that anyone survived in the 
circumstances. They were all experienced climbers who were members 
of some kind of organization and had decided they wanted to get some 
winter conditions experience.'' The hikers were reported missing at 
2230 GMT Tuesday when they did not return from the day's climb. Royal 
Air Force mountain rescue teams immediately began a search. Gale force 
winds forced a helicopter to abandon rescue attempts, but ground crews 
found the group at 0120 GMT Wednesday, a police spokesman said. The 
three survivors were found Wednesday, buried under three feet of snow 
about 16 hours after the avalanche hit. Rescue leader Terry Confield 
said the instructor had left details of the group's route and itinerary. 
``Within about an hour we had located one of the survivors who was 
stuck in the snow with the upper part of their body exposed,'' Confield 
said. ``If he hadn't been so easily visible we would have had a massive 
job on our hands.'' Confield said said rescuers frantically dug down 
into the snow to recover the remaining members of the party. ``Sadly, 
four of them were already dead but we were all delighted that three 
had survived,'' he said. Steven Newton, 24; Sarah Finch, 25, and instructor 
Roger Wilde, were carried off the mountain one at a time, and taken 
to Belford Hospital in Fort William, where they were being treated 
for hypothermia. The bodies of Emma Ray, 29; Paul Hopkins, 28; Matthew 
Lewis, 28, and Ian Edwards, 30, were recovered Wednesday.
