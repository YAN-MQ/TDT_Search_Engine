The president of Intuit Inc. stated Wednesday that Microsoft Corp. 
could use its market power to gain control over ``major areas'' of 
Internet commerce and asked the courts to give Microsoft's rivals 
equal access to its Windows operating system and desktop screen. The 
47-page written testimony of William Harris of Intuit, maker of Quicken 
personal-finance software, brings two new issues into the Microsoft 
antitrust trial: Microsoft's potential impact on the fast-growing 
field of Internet commerce, and possible steps to curb Microsoft's 
power. Both issues have been much debated outside the courtroom. The 
government's case against Microsoft focuses mainly on its use and 
alleged abuse of the market power derived from its dominant position 
in the market for personal-computer operating system software. Microsoft, 
the Justice Department says, has used its Windows monopoly to try 
to thwart the challenge posed by software used to browse the World 
Wide Web, pioneered by Netscape Communications Corp., and by Java, 
an Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems Inc. 
Most of the computer industry witnesses for the government have testified 
on the tactics Microsoft used to undermine the Netscape-Sun challenge 
_ namely, that Internet software could weaken Microsoft's grip on 
personal-computer software. In his testimony, Harris, who is scheduled 
to take the stand on Monday, does deal with one such episode involving 
Intuit in 1997. To obtain prime placement on the Microsoft desktop, 
Harris said, Intuit had to agree to bundle Microsoft's browser with 
Intuit's online personal finance software and not bundle Netscape's 
browser. The arrangement was negotiated for placement on a feature 
of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser called Active desktop. Microsoft, 
Harris said, wanted Active desktop to be ``a new user interface for 
Windows'' that would ``provide a choice of Internet Web sites that 
could be directly accessed from the desktop.'' Intuit, he said, was 
prepared to pay ``a substantial fee'' for this prime desktop real 
estate. ``But,'' Harris added, ``Microsoft offered us this placement 
instead in return for our agreement to forego future business dealings 
with Netscape.'' The government points to such testimony as evidence 
that Microsoft has used its market power stemming from Windows, which 
runs on more than 90 percent of personal computers sold, to unfairly 
hamper Netscape. Microsoft replied in a statement that Intuit chose 
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser over Netscape's Navigator because 
by 1997 its software was superior. In fact, in his testimony Harris 
wrote, ``The recommendation of our technical team was to use the Internet 
Explorer.'' But he added that it was Intuit's judgment that Netscape 
could deliver the browser capability Microsoft had, though a bit later. 
And Harris said he preferred to work with Netscape because it was 
not an Intuit competitor _ Microsoft's Money competes with Quicken 
_ and at the time Netscape's browser was used by many more computer 
users than Microsoft's browser. Yet Harris goes beyond the Internet 
software market by arguing that Microsoft can use its operating system 
dominance to influence or control Internet commerce and programming. 
With Windows 98, the operating system upgrade introduced in June, 
Microsoft has closely integrated Internet Explorer with Windows. As 
a result, Harris said, Microsoft's start-up page _ an all-purpose 
Web site, or portal, with links to many other sites _ will ``become 
the default portal in the Windows operating system.'' A featured spot 
on that start-up site, now called MSN.com, is regarded as prime real 
estate by other Web sites offering everything from news to travel 
services to personal finance information, according to Harris. Based 
on his assumption about the importance of the operating system as 
a ``choke point,'' and its growing importance in the future, Harris 
called on the court to impose a sweeping sanction on Microsoft that 
he terms ``operating system neutrality'' _ essentially a guarantee 
that the company enjoy no advantages in new software or Internet commerce 
markets from its operating system monopoly. In the Microsoft case, 
the subject of remedies will be taken up only if Judge Thomas Penfield 
Jackson rules against Microsoft _ and then there will be a separate 
hearing. What weight, if any, the views of Harris would have is uncertain. 
Microsoft called the remedies section of his testimony ``an entirely 
new and irrelevant concept Harris cooked up on his own'' based on 
``speculation and half-baked analyses.'' Industry analysts have also 
noted that Microsoft's Active desktop initiative proved a failure 
because people did not use it that much. Its failure has led many 
analysts to suggest that placement on the Windows desktop, while useful, 
may not be as important for Internet commerce and programming sites 
as Microsoft had hoped or rivals like Intuit had feared.
