In the hotel world, where the interior designer's stylish solution 
is usually a sterile, Prozac look, Barbara Hulanicki at least seems 
to be having fun. For the past seven years she has been dazzling the 
locals in the South Beach area of Miami and in the Bahamas with her 
exuberant hotel work. For the remodeling of the Pink Sands Hotel, 
a hideaway on Harbour Island in the Bahamas, she whisked together 
17 colors for the hotel's main house. She painted a billiard table 
shocking pink and stained the patio at a guest bungalow hyacinth blue. 
No wonder she wears sunglasses indoors and out. Some see her work 
as desecration. ``The colors she uses might be legal but they are 
egregiously ugly,'' Steven Brooke, a Miami photographer, said. To 
other critics, like Michael D. Kinerk, the chairman of the Miami Design 
Preservation League, she is a threat. ``Barbara was at the forefront 
of changing the local colors from pastel to bright,'' he said. ``It 
is the position of the league that the Art Deco district's colors 
should now swing back to more historically appropriate ones.'' The 
league's idea of perfection: white with a tasteful pastel trim. Sitting 
in front of a huge lilac fireplace in her airy South Beach apartment, 
Ms. Hulanicki, 62, chortled at the accusations. ``I love it,'' she 
said. ``When I start doing white, they will be begging me for color.'' 
To Ms. Hulanicki (pronounced Hula-NI-ki), the joke is on the Miami 
Design Preservation League, which approved the exterior colors for 
her three Miami hotels and even presented her with an award for the 
lilac, peach and pale blue facade of the Marlin hotel. ``It was such 
a step forward at the time,'' Kinerk explained, with a squeeze of 
lemon in his voice. ``But now we have different standards.'' Perhaps. 
But fiercely bright color is about to crash back to the fore. Ian 
Schrager's first hotel in London, which opens in June, will be ``incredibly 
colorful _ quite a surprise,'' said Anda Andrei, Schrager's design 
director. And at the spring 1999 fashion shows, which are often a 
barometer of what's next, the look was positively psychedelic. Ms. 
Hulanicki is currently redecorating the rooms at the Leslie Hotel 
in South Beach _ a hotel whose lemon-fudge and canary-yellow facade 
must grate on the nerves of the authenticity league. The first cell-size 
room she has completed (it will be $160 a night when it becomes available 
next summer) has the punchy charm of a 13-year-old's fever dream. 
The bed is two-tone orange and purple _ and doubles as a giant couch. 
And the CD player looks like a yellow army-issue field radio. Defending 
his designer's Sesame Street colors, Chris Blackwell, the president 
of the Island Outpost hotel group, which owns the Leslie, said, ``It's 
absolutely fun and childlike, qualities that exist in everybody, or 
should.'' Ms. Hulanicki squired a visitor around the grounds of the 
Pink Sands hotel in the Bahamas, a project she is beginning to drench 
with color. ``It's about energy,'' she said. ``It has the same effect 
on babies and adults, it makes our minds tick.'' The souklike Moroccan-Indian 
interiors for the Pink Sands _ meant to look as if they were accumulated 
haphazardly _ attract clients like Calvin Klein, Harrison Ford, Tina 
Brown and Jill Sanders. Prices for bungalows range from $600 to $1,750 
a night. A warning here for civilians: You have to have an artist's 
eye to pull off the Barbara Hulanicki look. When Blackwell had a falling 
out with her and hired someone else to repaint one of his hotels, 
Compass Point in the Bahamas, the result was ``horrific,'' he said. 
She explained, ``You have to have a lot of colors so that people can 
move their eyes from one color to another.'' The wild combinations 
of colors do not have to be glaring and nerve-racking. ``It's restful 
when they all work together,'' she said. Some of this intense color, 
however, may not travel. ``When people come and see it and say, `I'm 
going to do my home like this,' I think, `Oh jeez, don't do it.' '' 
While bold colors work best in bright sunlight, Ms. Hulanicki said: 
``The colors would be a little scary in New York. You need big walls 
and lots of light. A pale gray blue works best in the city light.'' 
Amid the exotic undergrowth of multicolored bougainvillea, blue plumbago 
and red lilies, the famed pink sand and azure sea, Ms. Hulankicki 
is eccentrically dressed in her signature black. ``I work a lot with 
color,'' she said. ``So I can't wear color.'' She is used to being 
in the spotlight. In the early 1960s in London, when most respectable 
young ladies were wearing navy blue dresses and mother's pearls, she 
opened a business selling flirty pink gingham dresses and matching 
head scarves via mail order. Her clothing proved so successful she 
introduced a string of boutiques. By 1969, with her husband, Stephen 
Fitz-Simon, she was running a six-floor department store called Biba, 
full of her designs. Baby boomers still recall Biba's roof garden 
stocked with live pink flamingos where Mick Jagger, Julie Christie 
and Twiggy hung out. Biba had a 500-seat Art Deco restaurant called 
the Rainbow Room, a housewares section stocked with fringed lampshades, 
chocolate-and-silver wallpaper and plenty of ostrich plumes. ``I hated 
all the '60s blow-up furniture,'' Ms. Hulanicki said. ``We thought 
it was flash. Only sleazy advertising executives had it.'' Biba was 
more of a club than a store. ``There was no place for rebellious people 
to go then,'' she said, ``except pubs with smelly old men.'' Those 
who couldn't afford the satin frocks with droopy collars and pouf 
sleeves stopped by to use the blue, green, purple and black Biba lipsticks 
before heading off to work. ``We learned a lot from watching the customers,'' 
Ms. Hulanicki said. She still learns a lot from her clientele, only 
now it's about how people use their temporary homes in hotels. ``You 
need lots of shelves,'' she said. ``People put stuff everywhere.'' 
And mirrors, like the giant ones at the Marlin hotel in South Beach. 
``People don't mind waiting for hours for an elevator if there is 
a mirror,'' she said. Another lesson she discovered is that too much 
perfection makes people look, well, rather ordinary. At the immaculate 
Delano, a rival Miami hotel designed by Philippe Starck, she said: 
``People come down in the elevator in their horrible shorts, and they 
look twice as bad as they really are. It's oppressive because you 
always feel that you have the wrong clothes on.'' For the same reason, 
she prefers old objects to new. ``Most modern wooden furniture is 
so perfect it looks like plastic,'' she said. At Pink Sands, barge 
loads of Indonesian, Balinese and Indian furniture supply the 24 bungalows 
still undergoing renovation (only two are finished). Most of the furniture 
comes from New York and Miami stores like Soussan and World Resources 
_ here a swing, there an opium bed, sometimes a pair of pink flamingos. 
Ms. Hulanicki's background is as multicultural as her taste. She was 
born in Poland, the oldest of three girls. (Her London venture was 
named for her younger sister, Biba). After her father was shot to 
death in Jerusalem in 1939, while negotiating Arab-Israeli disputes, 
her family fled to England, where she studied illustration at art 
school and sketched couture collections for Women's Wear Daily. In 
her autobiography, ``From A to Biba,'' she said she developed Biba 
for the girl she wanted to be. She has always been nervous about her 
looks despite the bold statement she makes: her signature platinum 
helmut hairdo, she said mockingly, ``comes back into fashion every 
10 years.'' After she quit Biba in 1975, she and her husband and son, 
Witold, moved to Brazil and then Miami. When she arrived in 1987, 
the decaying beach resort was thronged with dilapidated homes. She 
fell in love with it anyhow, and began designing nightclubs. Blackwell 
commissioned her to renovate the Marlin and seven other projects. 
``What's so fantastic about her is she is so adaptive _ most designers 
have one thing,'' he said. She moved into a ballroom-size apartment 
in the lobby of a former Deco hotel in South Beach after her husband 
died two years ago. Now that it is so easy to pay a fortune for a 
stylish look, she remains committed to cheap chic. The bright orange 
vases on the mantel are, she says, '50s promotional pieces from Sears. 
On her fingers, she wears two orange plastic rings, which she found 
on a factory floor. Her humorous ideas are a challenge to the past 
decade of minimalist design, which preaches an aura of endless calm. 
Her South Beach apartment is temporarily decked out with boxes and, 
in case of a hurricane, sandbags. How will she decorate the rest? 
She replied: ``I think I'll try minimalism. I should be able to stand 
that for about a week or two.''
