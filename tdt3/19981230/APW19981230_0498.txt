WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl is promising 
``closer oversight'' of Olympic city selection by the USOC after a 
special commission investigates alleged bribes by Salt Lake City organizers 
to help win the 2002 Winter Games. Asked why the USOC wasn't providing 
closer scrutiny already, Hybl pointed to predecessor Robert Helmick, 
who quit in 1991, two years after Salt Lake City was awarded the 2002 
Winter Games by the International Olympic Committee. Hybl took the 
USOC president's job on an interim basis after Helmick resigned when 
it was found Helmick received approximately dlrs 300,000 in fees from 
federations and other business organizations connected with the Olympic 
community. Hybl was elected to a four-year term in 1996. When the 
Salt Lake controversy surfaced, Helmick said that certain IOC members 
are willing to exchange votes for gifts ranging from airline tickets 
to fur coats to shopping sprees for members' wives where thousands 
of dollars were spent on clothing. Earlier this month, Hybl appointed 
a special commission to look into the Salt Lake complaints and the 
overall selection process. Former U.S. Senate leader and Northern 
Ireland peace negotiator George Mitchell promised Tuesday that an 
investigation of alleged bribes by Salt Lake Olympic officials to 
help secure the Winter Games would be ``thorough and prompt.'' ``One 
of the most difficult parts is the judging of past actions by current 
standards,'' Mitchell said. ``How do you treat people fairly? We will 
do the best we can within the limits of time and scope.'' After his 
first meeting with members of a special commission investigating the 
allegations, Mitchell told reporters the five-member panel must file 
its report to the U.S. Olympic Committee by Feb. 28. He said there 
would be no public reports before then. Hybl said the USOC put in 
tough rules on gifts and gratuities in November 1997 and emphasized 
the investigation will look for ways to prevent the kinds of abuses 
alleged against Salt Lake. Past and present officials of the Salt 
Lake City Olympic Committee have acknowledged that they gave members 
of the IOC gifts and paid college tuition to some of the committee's 
relatives prior to the city being selected for the Winter Games. USOC 
officials said tougher guidelines and oversight will be in place for 
the site selection for the 2007 Pan Am Games and the 2012 Summer Olympics.
