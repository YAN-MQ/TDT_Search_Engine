Much more news still to come on "The World" on PRI, Public Radio International. 
I'm Lisa Mullens. Still ahead, when non-euro user Britain is gearing 
up for the single currency anyway and why so many Serbs resent their 
president's wife. To them, she symbolizes corruption, -- regime and

anger and the fact that they're living so miserably. First, this news.
