Turkey claimed victory Wednesday in Greek Cypriots' decision to cancel 
deployment of Russian-made missiles on the divided island of Cyprus. 
It warned it would use force to block an alternative proposal to put 
the missiles on the Greek island of Crete _ which drew new threats 
in response from Greece. Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides 
announced Tuesday that he was calling off the deployment of Russian-made 
S-300 surface-to-air missiles on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, 
which is divided between two hostile Greek and Turkish republics. 
Clerides said he would negotiate with Russian officials to put the 
missiles on the nearby island of Crete instead. ``We would take all 
appropriate political and military means if they were to be deployed 
in Crete,'' Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem told reporters Wednesday. 
``If there is a threat directed toward Turkey, then we will do the 
necessary analysis and respond accordingly.'' Greece's defense minister, 
Akis Tzochatzopoulos, said the Turkish reaction confirmed that ``Turkey 
is a menacing factor in our region.'' ``Turkey's threats will never 
create difficulties for Greece,'' Tzochatzopoulos told a news conference 
in Tirana, Albania on Tuesday. ``We will find the neccesary force 
for its threats.'' Tzochatzopoulos contended that the possible deployment 
of the missiles in Greece was nothing for Turkey and Turkish Cypriots 
to worry about. ``Even the deployment in Cyprus has not been a threat,'' 
he said. Turkey had threatened to use force to block the missiles' 
deployment on Cyprus ever since plans for them were announced two 
years ago. The United States and NATO also criticized the deployment, 
fearing new conflict between NATO members and rivals Turkey and Greece. 
On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was among world leaders 
welcoming Greek Cypriots' tension-easing decision. Annan called it 
a ``tangible, positive response'' to Security Council requests that 
all sides avoid building up military forces on the island, a spokesman 
said. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin indicated 
Wednesday that Moscow still expected to be paid for the missiles.
