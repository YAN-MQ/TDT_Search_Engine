As Cuba prepares to mark the 40th anniversary of its communist revolution 
Friday, some world leaders have sent messages of support and congratulations, 
including Pope John Paul. VOA's Bill Rodgers reports from Havana. 
Cuba's Communist Party newspaper "Grandma" published the messages 
in its front page Wednesday beginning with a letter by Pope John Paul 
addressed to Cuban President Fidel Castro. In his letter, the pope 
expressed his appreciation that Mr. Castro's Communist government 
has restored Christmas as a permanent holiday and went on to urge 
Cubans to work, as he put it, for a more prosperous, just, and fraternal 
society. Another letter came from Chinese letter Jiang Jai Min praising 
Mr. Castro for maintaining socialism and Cuba's sovereignty, a veiled 
reference to the often hostile relations between Washington and Havana. 
Other messages came from Russian leader, Boris Yeltsin, and French 
President Jacques Chirac. All this as Cuba prepares to mark the 40th 
anniversary of hits Communist evolution Friday which swept away right-wing 
dictatorship and ushered in a Marxist-Leninist System that had changed 
little despite the collapse of Communism almost everywhere else in 
the world. Mr. Castro will address the nation Friday in the eastern 
city of Santiago which is where he launched his revolt in the early 
1950s. Bill Rodgers, VOA News, Havana.
