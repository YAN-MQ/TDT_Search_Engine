President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday he would not grant a last-minute 
reprieve to a convicted rapist who is set to be executed by lethal 
injection next week. ``It's too late, it's too late,'' Estrada said 
when asked if there was still a possibility of stopping Monday's execution 
of Leo Echegaray, who has been convicted of repeatedly raping a 10-year-old 
stepdaughter. ``As I said, he committed this crime not because of 
poverty but because of his animal instinct, so that's unforgivable, 
especially to a little girl. I cannot forgive that,'' Estrada told 
reporters. Echegaray's execution, the first to be scheduled since 
capital punishment was restored in the Philippines in 1994, has triggered 
a debate among many Filipinos over the death penalty. Last Monday, 
Echegaray's lawyer petitioned the Supreme Court to defer the execution 
while lawmakers review the law that restored capital punishment. The 
court justices are on recess and it's not clear whether a decision 
could be expected before Monday's execution. In recent weeks, several 
senators and congressmen have expressed doubts about whether capital 
punishment will deter crimes and filed resolutions seeking a review 
of the law that reimposed the death penalty. The Vatican, the European 
Union and Canada also recently sent appeals to the Philippine government 
to abolish capital punishment, arguing that death penalty would not 
reduce widespread crime. Estrada has turned down the appeals. Authorities 
in the national penitentiary in suburban Muntinlupa, where Echegaray 
is detained with more than 800 other death row convicts, have been 
carrying out mock executions in recent days. They also have strengthened 
security around the prison and prepared barbed wire roadblocks to 
control expected protests by anti-death penalty groups. Prison chaplain 
Roberto Olaguer said an all-night prayer vigil will be held outside 
the penitentiary on the eve of the execution by groups opposing capital 
punishment. Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people. 
In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave Congress 
the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such as murder, 
kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking. Legislators, alarmed 
by a rise in crime, took that option, bringing back the death penalty 
in 1994. Many Filipinos say the death penalty will deter criminals, 
and that crime has become rampant because no one has been executed 
in recent years. Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed 
to the death penalty say there is no proof of the deterrent effect. 
They claim that poor people are more likely to be sentenced to death 
because they cannot afford good lawyers.
