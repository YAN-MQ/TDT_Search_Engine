One of the handful of survivors from a Khmer Rouge torture center 
where perhaps 20,000 people were brutalized said Wednesday that the 
``sorry'' offered by two rebel leaders trying to defect can't erase 
his suffering. Eam Chan, 55, was once an inmate at Tuol Sleng, the 
infamous high school that the Maoist revolutionaries turned into a 
crude prison and torture center after seizing power in Cambodia in 
1975. The crumbling buildings, still hung with rusted barbed wire 
and furnished with the iron beds victims were strapped to, stands 
as a museum commemorating the estimated 2 million Cambodians who died 
in the Khmer Rouge genocide. ``The Cambodian people cannot forget 
that so easily,'' said Eam Chan, a sculptor. ``As a victim, my mind 
cannot be at rest without seeing the prosecution of these people, 
because the suffering was indescribable.'' Khieu Samphan and Nuon 
Chea, members of the inner circle of notorious Khmer Rouge leader 
Pol Pot, are being received in Phnom Penh as VIPs by Prime Minister 
Hun Sen, who has vowed to shield them from prosecution from crimes 
against humanity. Hun Sen reasoned that absolving them is necessary 
to end the last vestiges of civil war the Khmer Rouge waged after 
being ousted in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion. Many Cambodians disagree 
and King Norodom Sihanouk said Wednesday he would not approve amnesty. 
Neither does Eam Chan, who lost eight family members. Eam Chan expressed 
anger at Khieu Samphan's remarks at a news conference Tuesday that 
he was ``very sorry'' and his urgings to ``let bygones be bygones.'' 
``So much blood was shed,'' Eam Chan said. ``One word `sorry' means 
nothing. I don't understand why these people are being given freedom 
so quickly.'' Eam Chan was arrested in 1976 and accused of being a 
U.S. spy. He spent more than two years in different prison camps before 
being sent to Tuol Sleng. Eam Chan said he was subjected to daily 
torture by electric shock or asphyxiation. If he blacked out, he was 
revived and tortured again. One technique was to tie him to a table 
and cover his face with a wet rag. Water was dripped on it, causing 
him to slowly suffocate. When an invading Vietnamese army reached 
Phnom Penh in January 1979, the Tuol Sleng wardens fled, leaving seven 
sickly prisoners still alive. Eam Chan was in one of the last groups 
sent to be executed at a killing field outside the capital. But the 
procession was shelled and Eam Chan was able to escape as his captors 
scrambled for safety. ``The Khmer Rouge will not be truly finished 
unless these people are tried,'' Eam Chan said. ``If they aren't, 
I'm afraid they will return to their past practices.''
