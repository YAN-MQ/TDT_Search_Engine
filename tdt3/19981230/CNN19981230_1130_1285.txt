Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports." It was a rough night for the Philadelphia 
Flyers. Eric Lindros left the game in the second period with a mild 
concussion. He's to be re-examined today. The league's leading scorer 
downplayed the injury calling the severity "Bottom-level stuff." Philly 
also lost Karl dykhuis with a broken cheekbone in a 4-3 overtime win 
in Calgary.
