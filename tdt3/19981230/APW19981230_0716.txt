Guinea has asked the World Court to condemn the Democratic Republic 
of Congo for grave breaches of international law for expelling a Guinean 
national from Congo, then Zaire, in 1996 and stripping him of his 
assets. The case concerns businessman Ahmadou Sadio Diallo who had 
lived in Congo for 32 years before being jailed for two and a half 
months and deported in February 1996, according to brief details of 
Guinea's application released by the court Wednesday. The application 
provided no details about why Diallo was deported, and Congolese officials 
did not immediately respond to the document. Diallo was ``divested 
from his important investments, companies, bank accounts, movable 
and immovable properties,'' Guinea claims. Among companies owing him 
an undisclosed amount of money are the Congolese branches of oil giants 
Mobil, Shell and Fina, according to the claim which was filed Dec. 
28. No further details were immediately available.
