With its customary horse-trading and dirty back-room deals, Israeli 
politics was never for the squeamish. But the new political style 
emerging in the campaign for the May 17 election is putting off even 
the most cynical voters. In a dizzying merry-go-round and with nary 
a word about substance, politicians are jumping from party to party 
in hopes of latching on to the candidate with the best chances of 
becoming prime minister. One party reportedly plans to rank its candidates 
based on who scores highest in the polls. Stories about politics read 
like gossip columns, with detailed accounts of secret assignations 
between party bosses and would-be defectors. ``There is no more ideology,'' 
complained Benny Piro, a 60-year-old Jerusalem building supervisor, 
as he and other voters wearily started the countdown to the end of 
the 138-day campaign. Israel's two living former prime ministers, 
Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir, became so dismayed this week that 
they set aside their lifelong rivalry to join forces in protest. The 
two elder statesmen and veteran wheeler-dealers blamed the party-hopping 
and apparent lack of convictions on changes in Israel's electoral 
system, first applied in 1996. Voters now cast two ballots, one for 
prime minister and a second for a party. In earlier Knessets, the 
party leader backed by a majority in parliament was tagged prime minister. 
Peres, an architect of the territories-for-peace Oslo accords, and 
Shamir, a lifelong opponent of territorial concessions to the Arabs, 
say the new method has led to a proliferation of small factions and 
emphasizes the candidates' style over their beliefs. Shamir told The 
Associated Press that ``if there is something I could do, it would 
be to change this trend so that people focus more on issues and less 
on egotism.'' The ideological gaps between Israel's two political 
camps have already narrowed and are now often indistinguishable. While 
the argument once raged over whether to strike a land-for-peace deal 
with the Palestinians, the debate now centers on how much West Bank 
land to hand over and who will get a better agreement on the borders 
of a future Palestinian state. The Likud party was forced to dismantle 
the main plank of its platform _ keeping all of the biblical Land 
of Israel _ when Benjamin Netanyahu, a Likud prime minister, agreed 
in October to give up a sizable chunk of the West Bank. ``Everybody 
is for peace, more or less,'' said political scientist Gideon Doron. 
``On the entire political map, there are not many differences.'' So 
when a weakened Netanyahu was forced to agree last week to early elections, 
politicians seeking a leader that will help them survive into the 
next Knesset were less concerned about ideology and more attentive 
to polls. Communications Minister Limor Livnat is said to be considering 
an alliance with the dark horse candidate, ex-army chief Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, 
who according to some polls is favored to become Israel's next leader. 
Lipkin-Shahak supports the Mideast peace agreements, while Livnat 
strongly opposed the Wye River accord, and abstained when it came 
to a Cabinet vote.
