Meanwhile, Argentina and Uruguay have expressed solidarity with Chile's 
effort to block extradition to the former dictator for trial in Spain. 
We have details now from correspondent George Meek in our South America 
bureau. Uruguay's foreign ministry has issued a formal communique 
supporting Chile. Uruguay says that regardless of the persons involved, 
it rejects any attempt by a country to assert jurisdiction over crimes 
committed in another country. Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguanettie 
reaffirmed the principal in a television interview. Argentine interior 
minister Carlos Corrage says the decision of the British House of 
Lords, denying General Pinochet's immunity is a serious mistake that 
does not respect international criminal law. Human rights groups in 
South American welcomed the decision of the House of Lords. The Quito-based 
Latin America Human Rights Association calls it a victory for a form 
of law that puts protection of human rights above any question of 
diplomatic immunity or third nation jurisdiction. George Meek, VOA 
News Rio de Janeiro.
