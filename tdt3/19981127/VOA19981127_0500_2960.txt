The Japanese Parliament begins a two-week debate on an economic recovery 
plan that has to be weighing on investor sentiment in Japan. It's 
a plan designed to pull the economy out of its recession. The $139 
billion plan, including corporate and personal income tax cuts, is 
considered a first step to boosting consumer spending, restoring Japanese 
companies to profitability. But as the debate begins, Finance Minister 
Kyishe Miyazawa told reporters, he will resign his post in the ruling 
Liberal Democratic Party and hence his Finance Minister's position. 
It comes as the party is trying to forge a political coalition with 
a small liberal party headed by Achiro Ozawa. The smaller party wants 
to cut the consumption tax, something the LDP has so far refused to 
do. Still the LDP has agreed to discuss the proposition, boosting 
consumer spending which accounts for about 65 percent of the Japanese 
economy. It is considered one of the keys to restoring the economy 
to health.
