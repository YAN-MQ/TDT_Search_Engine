Hong Kong has sunk even deeper into recession, the government said 
Friday in a report that cast a gloomy outlook on the territory's economic 
performance for the year. Gross domestic product fell by about 7 percent 
in the third quarter, prompting government economists to predict the 
economy will contract by 5 percent for all of 1998. The government 
had previously predicted the economy would shrink by 4 percent. Hong 
Kong's GDP had fallen by 5.2 percent in the second quarter and 2.7 
percent in the first quarter. Financial Secretary Donald Tsang warned 
there could be more tough times ahead, saying Hong Kong people would 
have to ``cross a psychological barrier'' as they prepare to ride 
things out. ``We may have to face a couple of more quarters of poor 
figures,'' Tsang told a press conference. Government economists blamed 
Hong Kong's troubles on volatile financial markets, tight credit and 
high interest rates _ all of which have aggravated its problems from 
Asia's downturn. The government added that Hong Kong's inflation rate 
would slow for the full year, with rises in consumer prices dropping 
to 3 percent from 3.5 percent. Hong Kong ``was spending less'' in 
the third quarter, amid uncertainty over a steep drop in stocks and 
property prices, said economist Anthony Xie of U.S. investment bank 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``That the contraction accelerated so 
much is kind of surprising,'' said Xie. But he predicted Hong Kong's 
economy would ``stabilize by the middle of 1999.'' Hong Kong trade 
suffered ``a significant setback'' in the third quarter and is expected 
to remain weak into the fourth quarter, due to the continued economic 
slump in Japan and the rest of Asia, the government said. For the 
full year, total exports of goods will drop by 4.5 percent, compared 
with the previous forecast of a 2.2 percent fall. Imports will drop 
6.4 percent, compared with the previous estimate of a 3.5 percent 
fall, the government said. Tsang said the big drop in Hong Kong's 
economic performance appeared somewhat exaggerated, because the third 
quarter figures had to be compared with numbers from the previous 
third quarter, when the territory had a ``brilliant performance.'' 
Tsang tried to stay as optimistic as possible under the circumstances, 
noting recent rises in stock and property prices and urging Hong Kong 
people to compare their current plight with the greater economic devastation 
being suffered by many of their Asian neighbors. Hong Kong has taken 
a battering of bad economic news in recent months. Early this month 
the government announced that unemployment hit a record 5.3 percent 
_ the highest since the territory began keeping unemployment statistics 
in 1981. In a random telephone survey conducted this month by Hong 
Kong University of more than 500 respondents, 58 percent said they 
had no confidence in the way the government was handling the recession. 
The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percent.
