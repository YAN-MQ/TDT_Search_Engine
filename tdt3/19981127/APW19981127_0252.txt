A 14-year-old boy who was attacked and almost beheaded as part of 
a failed ritual killing is struggling to survive despite several spinal 
cord wounds at the back of his neck, doctors said Friday. Charles 
Idem was attacked last weekend in what police say was a ritual attack 
adhering to local practices. Human body parts, including the head 
and heart, are sometimes used in cult ceremonies in tribal Nigeria. 
Idem was traveling from his village in southwestern Nigeria when he 
was abducted and taken to a forest. Four assailants pushed him into 
the edge of a fish pond and began hacking at his neck with knives, 
a police investigator said on condition of anonymity. The teen was 
admitted to the Lagos General Hospital and later transferred to the 
Lagos University Teaching Hospital under the supervision a neuro-surgeon. 
Doctors say Idem is losing spinal cord fluid, complicating his recover 
and potentially putting his life at risk. Over the course of the week, 
Idem has lost the use of his limbs and is having difficulty swallowing 
food.
