Russian officials say Michele Kondisue the head of the International 
Monetary Fund will visit Moscow next week. An IMF team was recently 
in Russia for meetings on the deep economic crisis there, and on Moscow's 
hope for the release of billions of dollars in frozen IMF aid. VOA's 
Gil Butler has more from Moscow. Russia' Government Information Department 
says Mr. Kondisue has agreed to visit Moscow next Tuesday and Wednesday. 
It says Prime Minister Yevgenie Primikov spoke by telephone with the 
IMF director Wednesday night. The visit will give Russian leaders 
another try at convincing the IMF to unfreeze over four billion dollars 
in aid. The money has been held up since August, when Russia devalued 
the ruble and defaulted on debts. An IMF team left Russia Wednesday, 
without agreement on a new Russian government plan for dealing with 
the economic emergency. The fund has insisted that Russia implement 
tough reforms. The government here, is trying to prepare a budget 
for 1999, and wants the international aid Russia says is crucial.
