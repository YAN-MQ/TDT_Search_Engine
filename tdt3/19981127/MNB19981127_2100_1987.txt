And for the millions of Americans streaming into the stores, on the 
Internet, and jamming the phone lines with catalog orders, who will 
help them? Is there anybody there? That's exactly what's being asked 
by store owners and managers who are desperately seeking sales help. 
Here's Mike Jensen. Nobody ever said holiday shopping was easy, but 
this year, $50 billion changing hands, the biggest crowds ever, the 
longest lines at the cash Register, and instead of clerks, help wanted 
signs everywhere you look. Seems like nobody has enough people in 
the stores. Have such a hard time getting someone to show me the items. 
I think the employees are sort of overwhelmed. Stephanie pasquarrella 
is overwhelmed. This season, we need help. She's offering 50% merchandise 
discounts to anyone who will work at her store in New Jersey. One 
reason it's tough, the economy is doing so well. Plenty of jobs, hardly 
anyone looking, and more than half a million positions to be filled 
at Christmas. Retailers are scrambling to find workers, even trying 
to sign up shoppers in malls. 1998 is by far the most challenging 
year retailers have faced in hiring the numbers they need for the 
holidays. John lutton needs to double his staff. Normally this time 
of year, I have about 22 people. We have 11 right now. At Macy's, 
a sign-up bonus. Linda Martin is in charge of hiring. We're offering 
a bonus of up to $300, depending on the market. Anna antunes is trying 
to Hang on to the employees she has. Other businesses are coming in 
here and trying to recute my people and take them. There's a bidding 
war, money, perks, even insurance. They offer me dental, medical, 
even life. Great for workers but not for shoppers and not for America's 
2 1/2 million store owners. For them, it's like a war zone. Going 
into the holiday season short-staff sd a truly frightening prospect. 
Especially frightening with more than 250 million Americans flocking 
to the stores in what's shaping up as the most frustrating Christmas 
shopping season in history. There are 27 days to go. Mike Jensen, 
NBC news, New York.
