In Seattle, a metro bus plummeted off a bridge this afternoon after 
the driver was apparently shot by a passenger. The vehicle fell 50 
feet hitting the roof of an apartment building. The driver was thrown 
from the bus and killed. Police say they'll treat the shooting as 
a homicide. A second person on the bus has also died. About 30 of 
the other passengers were critically injured. I was just standing 
outside 'cause it was a beautiful day, you know. And we were just 
standing outside and I was just drinking a beer, you know, and all 
I heard was -- we were just standing, I mean like right where the 
bus fell. It was just sheer terror. Everything was coming at us. We 
just looked up and we heard this bang. And we just looked up and there 
was this concrete flying everywhere and I just, you know, thought 
"I'm gonna die now. I'm gonna die. I'm only 20 years old and I'm gonna 
die." And something made me move. I totally froze and something just 
like a guardian Angel or something made me move. Well it wasn't too 
much to see, but it was everything that you heard, okay. And I actually 
heard a big bang, big crash and then that was like we got the word 
or whatever saying that the bus just ran off the -- off the bridge 
here. So I don't know, just like the normal person that I am, I mean, 
care for people and stuff. I ran on down and started helping people 
off the bus. The bus landed in Seattle's Fremont district which is 
a densely populated area of homes, shops and restaurants.
