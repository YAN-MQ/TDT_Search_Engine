President Clinton's responses to the 81 questions posed by the house 
Judiciary committee have been sent to Capitol Hill. And they were 
made public a short time ago. As expected, no real bombshells. For 
some key questions, Mr. Clinton referred the committee back to the 
general statement he made in his federal grand jury testimony. Several 
times throughout the 34-page, signed response, Mr. Clinton repeated 
the sentence -- "that testimony was not false and misleading." Our 
own John king has been pouring over the responses. The White House. 
Another question did committee wants the answer to, obviously, this 
one has been coming up these past ten months, do you admit or deny 
that on or about December 28th, 1997, you discussed with Betty Currie, 
the president's oval office secretary, gifts previously given to you 
by Monica Lewinsky? The next question was, do you admit or deny that 
in that conversation, you requested instructed, suggested to or otherwise 
discussed with Betty Currie, that she take possession of the gifts 
Monica Lewinsky had given to you? The president's response to that 
question is, that I do not recall any conversations with miss Currie 
on or about December 28th about gifts I had previously given to miss 
Lewinsky. I never told miss Currie to take possession of gifts I had 
given to miss Lewinsky. John king reading from the transcript. Judiciary 
chairman Henry Hyde had threatened to subpoena the president if he 
didn't submit the answers by Monday. As for Mr. Clinton, he plans 
to return to the White House from camp David later today. If indeed 
he isn't already there.
