An ultra-Orthodox rabbi working in a provincial town in Russia to 
bring Jews closer to their heritage was severely beaten up by skinheads, 
the daily Haaretz said Friday. Rabbi Zalman Yaffo was attacked last 
month by three skinheads as he was leaving his home in Nizhniy Novgorod, 
about 250 miles (400 km) east of Moscow, the paper said. Yaffo, the 
representative of the ultra-Orthodox movement Habad in the area, was 
hospitalized for a day because of the beating, Haaretz said. Habad 
officials and Israeli and other Jewish representatives kept the incident 
quiet for over a month, the paper said. Rabbi Berl Lazar, a Habad 
representative in Russia, told the paper that the beating was an isolated 
incident and that ``media hype about anti-Semitic utterances only 
heightens the danger.''
