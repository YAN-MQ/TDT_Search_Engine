The president returned from his camp David Thanksgiving with a few 
rounds of golf under his belt and another legal hurdle behind him 
-- his answers to the 81 questions demanded of him by the house Judiciary 
committee, 81 questions that cover virtually every aspect of the Lewinsky 
scandal. NBC's Claire Shipman is with us from the White House with 
a look at the president's responses. Brian, a contrite letter from 
the president to house Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde admits his conduct 
was wrong, and that he regrets it. But if republicans were hoping 
for proof of criminal wrongdoing, they're bound to be disappointed. 
After a day of golf and handshaking, the president sent his response 
to Capitol Hill. Nowhere in the 26 pages did he admit to perjury or 
obstruction of justice. His carefully worded answers, prepared by 
his legal team, stuck closely to previous testimony. He insisted he 
did not mislead anyone under oath. He repeatedly could not recall 
or remember details, especially when asked whether he'd coached his 
secretary, Betty Currie, to lie. But he flatly denied asking Ms. Currie 
to retrieve and conceal his gifts to Ms. Lewinsky. Even the most basic 
questions were met with classic Clinton-style answers. Asked if he 
is the country's chief law enforcement officer, he said -- Republicans 
say the White House is again splitting legal hairs. The fact of the 
matter is, very clearly, he lied before the grand jury. He lied before 
a federal judge and there's really no real dispute about that. Others 
say the president's caution is appropriate. There have been suggestions 
that there could be a prosection even after the president leaves office 
We're told if an impeachment vote fails, many would still like to 
see censure and they will push democrats to vote for it. If thinking 
is there could be a backlash. Claire Shipman on the north lawn of 
the White House today.
