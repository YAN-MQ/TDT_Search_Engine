CERKLJE, Slovenia (AP) _ NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, 
Gen. Wesley Clark, thanked Slovenia on Friday for hosting a military 
maneuver that the alliance held for the first time in this former 
Yugoslav country. Clark arrived Friday for a one-day visit to observe 
the operation, code-named Exercise Cooperative Adventure Exchange 
1998. The exercise closed later in the day. More than 5,500 troops 
from the eight member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
and 10 nations of the Alliance's Partnership for Peace program were 
participating in the operation. Slovenia became a member of the Partnership 
for Peace soon after it proclaimed independence from the former Yugoslav 
federation in 1991. It hopes to be invited to join the Alliance in 
the next round of expansion. In summer of 1997 Hungary, Poland and 
the Czech Republic were invited to join NATO. Up to 1,200 Slovene 
soldiers participated in the exercise, which was aimed as a rehearse 
for peace support operation. Clark said the exercise was productive 
and conducted well. Slovenes now expect traffic jams as more than 
3,500 NATO vehicles and thousands of troops from across Europe pull 
out from its territory.
