The weather in the pacific northwest is easing up after the region 
was pummeled by its second storm in less than a week. Heavy rain and 
strong winds set off mudslides, toppled trees, blew over mobile homes

drivers. And rising rivers in Washington state flooded a highway and 
forced families to evacuate their homes.
