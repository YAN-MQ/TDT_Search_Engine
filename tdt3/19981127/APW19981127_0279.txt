Doctors have diagnosed more than 1,500 ill people, most suffering 
respiratory illnesses, during health checkups the past two days in 
a flood-stricken region of western Ukraine, officials said Friday. 
This month, more than 32,000 people have fallen ill, some with infectious 
diseases that still might be spreading, the Emergency Situations Ministry 
said Friday. Health officials are still worried about the spread of 
illnesses, saying much of the region's drinking water was polluted 
by the flooding. The floods hit more than 100 settlements, mostly 
in the Zakarpattia region, and claimed at least 17 lives, emergency 
officials said Thursday. More than 2,000 houses were fully destroyed 
in the flooding and thousands of people were evacuated from the area. 
Ukraine's government has allocated 10 million hryvna (dlrs 2.9 million) 
for the relief effort. International organizations including the Red 
Cross and United Nations have sent aid. Aid also came from the governments 
and non-government groups in Poland, Switzerland, Britain, the United 
States, Austria, Germany, Slovenia, France, the Czech Republic, Holland 
and China. Hungary has provided about dlrs 500,000 in aid and more 
than dlrs 200,000 came from Japan, according to the Ukrainian government.
