Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed down 36 points today on news that 
Hong Kong's economy shrank by seven percent during the third quarter. 
It's a sign that Asia's economic powerhouse is still reeling from 
the effects of the economic crisis. "The World's" Michael Swayto reports 
from Hong Kong. Asia's economic crisis is far from over. And one need 
only look at the latest figures out of Hong Kong. For the third straight 
quarter, this city's economy has contracted. Exports are down sharply 
and consumers here aren't spending much, either. They're too worried 
about pay cuts or losing their jobs to do much shopping. The whole 
community is facing hardship. There is no doubt about it. Donald Jong 
is Hong Kong's financial secretary. We have to go through what I call 
a psychological barrier in that we have -- must have confidence in 
ourselves that we might have to face with a couple of quarters more 
poor figures, but the internal strengths of Hong Kong remain. The 
financial markets are already looking beyond the current problems, 
though, and institutional investors from around the world are starting 
to put their money back into Asia. Howard Gorge is a South China brokerage, 
says that's because there's a general sense the worst is over. They're 
beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel. And that's largely 
due to the recent cuts in American interest rates by the U.S. Federal 
Reserve. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's decision to lower rates has 
taken a lot of pressure off of Asia's economies. I think that Mr. 
Greenspan's interest rate cuts are going to have a very big bearing 
on the world economy and in restoring a measure of confidence to Asia, 
the financial markets have already seen this and are largely discounting 
it. Hong Kong's stock market has gotten support from the government, 
which spent some $15 billion on shares in August. But it wasn't until 
the U.S. started cutting rates some two months ago that Hong Kong's 
market really took off. Since then, the benchmark Hang Seng Index 
has shot up 36 percent. Other Asian bourses are doing even better. 
Now some analysts believe the higher share prices could start translating 
into real economic growth. It's not that people don't have the money 
to spend, it's just that they're scared. And with companies laying 
off more workers all the time, individuals don't yet have the confidence 
of the financial markets. For "The World," I'm Michael Swayto in Hong 
Kong.
