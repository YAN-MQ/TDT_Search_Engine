As part of his preparation, Jim Fassel, like any other coach in the 
National Football League, peruses the newspapers from the city of 
his upcoming opponent. When he thumbed through this week's stories 
from San Francisco, it stopped his leisurely breakfast. Looking for 
a weakness in the 49ers, he found stories deriding the team's inconsistencies, 
and a questioning tone, even from within the team, that it is the 
same offensive power it has been for years. Jerry Rice was voicing 
dissatisfaction with the number of times he gets the ball, even though 
he has 61 catches. Fassel did not have to compare the stories to his 
own notes that show the 49ers (8-3) with the leading offense in the 
NFL to know that it could be a long Monday night at 3Com Park for 
the New York Giants. ``It's amazing,'' he said. ``You get the clips 
and they're talking about their offense and inconsistencies. I'm going, 
`You guys are No. 1 in the NFL. Where does that put everybody else?' 
People are talking about their offense and can they do it. Are they 
still the same? Yeah, they're pretty good. They're real good.'' This 
season's model of the 49ers has differed little from 49ers teams of 
the past, averaging a league-best 422.2 yards per game. The 49ers 
are on pace to finish the season with 6,754 yards, just 182 shy of 
the NFL record. Steve Young has guided the offense with 27 touchdown 
passes and Garrison Hearst needs just 61 yards to record his second 
straight 1,000-yard rushing season. For their part, the Giants (4-7) 
bring an offense that went 11 quarters without a touchdown before 
finally breaking through in the second half against the Philadelphia 
Eagles last week. And the Giants have not scored a touchdown in their 
last four games in San Francisco. The last time the Giants reached 
the end zone in San Francisco was Nov. 27, 1989. ``We need to offensively 
score more points than we have been lately,'' Fassel said. ``Part 
of the process is having more consistency on offense, which is going 
to mean moving the football on the ground, converting third downs, 
the turnover ratio good, and we're going to need to win some field 
position on special teams. Don't ever give them the short field because 
they can score quick enough on the long field. Also, that has to result 
in some points, then our defense has to play well.'' Short of controlling 
the ball from the opening kickoff right through the end of the game, 
the Giants may have trouble keeping up offensively with the 49ers. 
While Kent Graham is still finding his way in his new role as the 
starting quarterback for the Giants, the 49ers are in a comfort zone. 
``They can read each others' thoughts,'' Giants safety Percy Ellsworth 
said. ``You watch them play on film and you know half the things that 
happen weren't even designed. It's not luck. It's years of working 
together.'' Phillippi Sparks said: ``They have their own plays that 
have nothing to do with the game plan. I'll give you one. If Rice 
gets behind the guy on him _ regardless of the route called _ he throws 
his arm up over his head and regardless of the route called, Young 
throws the ball to him immediately. That's their signal. Jerry says, 
`I'm open.' Steve says, `Here's the ball.''' Asked if he had experienced 
that queasy feeling of seeing the hand go up and the ball soar over 
his head, Sparks said that it had never happened to him. But good 
or bad, he does not want to dwell on the Giants' history of troubles 
in San Francisco. He is focused on trying to contain Rice and the 
49ers' other receivers, J.J. Stokes and Terrell Owens. ``I don't like 
going back to the past,'' Sparks said. ``That doesn't matter to me. 
What actually matters is your next game, your next play. That's the 
only thing I can think of. I was there when they beat us bad there, 
but I also remember when we beat them bad here. ``They are powerful. 
I'm not going to be up here being silly. They are very powerful offensively. 
We're going to have to play a great game defensively and make sure, 
no big plays.'' The Giants have faced other versions of the West Coast 
offense this season with varying success. Against the Green Bay Packers, 
the Giants were roughed up for 37 points. Against the Eagles, the 
Giants posted their first shutout in eight years. ``You have teams 
in the league that run the exact same offense,'' Sparks said. ``I 
just think the personnel make the offense. You can put different players 
in, but when you have a Stokes, Owens, Rice, all three can start for 
any team in the league and they run the same exact stuff that everybody 
else does, but they do it a little bit quicker.'' EXTRA POINTS _ The 
Giants' MICHAEL STRAHAN sat out for the second consecutive day with 
stiffness in his back, but Coach JIM FASSEL said it was cautionary 
and he expected Strahan to play Monday. _ CARLTON GRAY, who signed 
with the Giants after being waived by the Colts, said that he was 
not frustrated with his role, despite being removed from his spot 
in the nickel defense. ``I want to contribute,'' said Gray, who injured 
his right ankle slightly late in practice Friday when he caught a 
cleat in the grass. ``Everybody wants to play. But I understand it. 
I understood it when I came here. Even though JASON SEHORN is hurt, 
CONRAD HAMILTON has played well.''
