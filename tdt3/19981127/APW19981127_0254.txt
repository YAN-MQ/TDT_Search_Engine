Miss Seychelles, in a contest held in her homeland, won the Miss Personality 
title at the 1998 Miss World contest. Alvina Grandcourt won the title 
Thursday night, judges announced Friday. Miss Israel, an 18-year-old 
student who is expected to report for military duty in her country 
early next year, was crowned Miss World Thursday night. Linor Abargil 
is due to begin 20 months of Israeli military service in April 1999. 
But her father, Jackie Abargil, said he hopes the army will postpone 
her induction so she can fulfill her yearlong duties as Miss World. 
In other titles announced Friday, Miss World runner-up, France's Veronique 
Caloc won for Europe. South Africa's Kerishnie Naicker claimed the 
crown for Africa. Chile's Daniella Lathrop won for the Americas, and 
Malaysia's Pick Lin Lina Teoh, who was second runner-up in the Miss 
World pageant, took home the Asian crown. Jamaica's Christine Straw 
won the Oceania crown. Brazil's Adriana Reis gained the Miss Photogenic 
title. After 48 years, the beauty contest created by former British 
serviceman Eric Morley to liven up drab, postwar England, underwent 
a facelift for this year's contest, televised in 130 countries. A 
British production company did away with the high heels and swimsuit 
parade before the judges. Instead, the women paraded in different 
sets of clothes, from a casual look to smart party dresses. Rather 
than talking about themselves, they talked about friends and future 
careers.
