Another great moment in US College football history is expected to 
take place later today in a game between Texas and sixth ranked Texas 
Tech. While the contest has no title implications of any kind, Texas 
Running Back Ricky Williams is expected to become the new all-time 
Division One rushing leader. He needs 61 yards to break the current 
mark of 6,082 yards set by Tony Dorsett 22 years ago. Longhorns' Coach 
Mac Brown says the achievement will cap a great year for Williams. 
What Ricky Williams has been able to accomplice this year has just 
been phenomenal. And I know there is a lot of pressure on him with 
this game coming up, but needing 63 yards to break Tony's all-time 
record. But, as people have said, whether Ricky breaks that record 
or not, A&M's got a great defense. He's had a tremendous year.
