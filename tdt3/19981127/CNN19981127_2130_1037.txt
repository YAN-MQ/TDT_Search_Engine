As Americans hit the malls for those after-Thanksgiving-day sales, 
many travelers are hitting the duty-free shops. Kalin Thomas-Samuel 
has more in this edition of "working ahead." The world of duty-free 
shopping recently celebrated its golden anniversary. The concept started 
in Ireland back in 1947. Because airplanes didn't have enough fuel 
to get from Paris and London all the way to New York, so they would 
stop in Ireland. Basically, the Irish government decided to capitalize 
on that and open duty-free shopping. The word duty and the word tax 
are interchangeable. And so when you shop duty-free, you're not paying 
a tax. And though travelers may be saving money, duty-free shops are 
making money, nearly $33 billion worldwide. One of the most popular 
places to find a duty-free shop is at an airport. It's a convenient 
stop for travelers getting those last-minute gifts and souvenirs. 
The biggest-selling duty-free items are perfumes, tobacco and alcohol. 
But duty-free shopping isn't cheaper for all travelers. If you're 
from a country with high taxation on consumer or luxury goods, like 
Japan or some European countries, a duty-free store is really a good 
deal. If you're from the United States, you'll probably find a better 
deal at an outlet store or even a neighborhood mall. Duty-free shopping 
in Europe may be abolished in 1999. In the future, borders between 
European countries are not going to be much different than borders 
between U.S. states, therefore, there will be no need to have a duty-free 
shop on intraeuropean borders. Still, many travelers like the convenience 
of duty-free shopping, especially during the holidays. Kalin Thomas-Samuel,
