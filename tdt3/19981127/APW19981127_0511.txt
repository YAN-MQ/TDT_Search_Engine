Tadeusz Syryjczyk, Poland's first post-communist economic minister, 
was nominated Friday to become the new transport minister after the 
previous one resigned over labor influence on plans to restructure 
the state railway company. Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said he asked 
President Aleksander Kwasniewski to approve the nomination. An adviser 
to Kwasniewski, who is visiting Morocco until Dec. 3, said he expected 
the president to approve the appointment upon his return. Syryjczyk, 
50, is a leader of the Freedom Union, a junior partner in the Solidarity-led 
governing coalition. A specialist in industry and computers, he was 
the economic minister in Poland's first democratic government in 1989 
and now heads the Freedom Union parliamentary caucus. Syryjczyk would 
succeed Eugeniusz Morawski, also of the Freedom Union, who resigned 
Monday in a dispute over the influence of organized labor in government 
plans to reform the heavily indebted, inefficient state railway system. 
The government is negotiating terms of restructuring the railway, 
Polskie Koleje Panstwowe, with labor unions that oppose job losses, 
a significant element of the reform plan. In recent years, the railway 
company inherited from the communist era has been cutting train connections 
and increasing ticket prices to prevent further losses.
