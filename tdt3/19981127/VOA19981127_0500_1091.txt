The National Football League's Minnesota Vikings have spoiled the 
traditional US Thanksgiving celebration in Dallas with a 46 to 36 
pounding of the Cowboys. Rookie receiver Randy Moss helped keep the 
Vikings in firm control of the game, catching three touchdown passes, 
each of which were longer than 50 yards. The last meeting between 
the two teams on Thanksgiving Day was also a high scoring contest, 
as Minnesota Coach, Dan Green remembers. It was really a hard fought 
game. You know everybody gets one day. The last time we played on 
Thursday was a high scoring game, because offensively you can get 
a game plan together a lot quicker than you can defensively. And I 
think our defense suffered as a result of that. The Vikings are heading 
for their first NFC Central title since 1994. Despite the loss, the 
Cowboys are still fighting for their 6th NFC East Title in seven years. 
During the game, Running Back Emmett Smith tied Marcus Allen for the 
all-time career touchdown mark of 123.
