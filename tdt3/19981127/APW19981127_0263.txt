The former head of a state-owned Chinese automaker has been sentenced 
to death for embezzling more than 55 million yuan (dlrs 7 million), 
the company said Friday. Huang Peiyu, former chairman of Xiamen Motor 
Co., was convicted of selling part of the government's stake in his 
company and diverting the money to a foreign bank account. Huang's 
sentence was suspended for two years, and his life might be spared 
if no other irregularities are found, said a spokeswoman for the company. 
She said Huang may appeal. The sentence comes just a week after another 
major stock-market fraud case. Senior managers of Chengdu Hongguang 
Industrial Co. were charged with reporting false profits and misappropriating 
more than 165 million yuan (dlrs 20 million). The prosecutions highlight 
Chinese efforts to root out corruption that threatens to damage the 
economy and hurt small investors. Xiamen Motor said that from 1993 
to 1996, Huang used a Hong Kong subsidiary to sell part of the company 
to a foreign buyer, diverting the proceeds to a personal bank account 
in the Cayman Islands, a banking center in the Caribbean. Those transactions 
put 25 percent of the government-owned company into the hands of a 
Hong Kong investor. Huang returned some of the money after he was 
arrested in 1997.
