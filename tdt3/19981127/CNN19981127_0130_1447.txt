Some turkeys were lucky enough to escape from being a Thanksgiving 
meal this year. Families across the country adopted turkeys instead 
of eating them, through the "adopt-A-Turkey" project. If you're interested, 
you can call the program's toll-free hot line at 1-888-sponsor. For 
$15 organizers will send you a picture and an adoption certificate 
of the spared bird. Or you can have your Turkey delivered.
