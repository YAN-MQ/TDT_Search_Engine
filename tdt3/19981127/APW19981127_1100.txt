What would you call a 16-nation, dlrs 40 billion international space 
station? Orchestra? Mommy? Armageddon? Those were just a few of the 
suggestions gathered so far by a Russian television network holding 
a contest to name the new space creature. Perhaps not surprisingly, 
plenty of the ideas reflected the country's current turmoil _ and 
Russians' often cynical sense of humor. Individual modules of the 
international space station have names. Russia kicked off the project 
with last week's launch of the Zarya, or Sunrise, module. NASA will 
be following with the Unity module on Dec. 3. But putting a tag on 
the whole thing has proved a thorny issue, as the nations involved 
have different ideas of what would be appropriate. For now, the station 
is stuck with the inelegant acronym ISS. The contest run by the TV-6 
television station has given ordinary Russians a chance to have a 
say in the matter, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday. The 
station received several thousand suggestions within the first day 
of the contest. The most popular has been ``Starovoitova'' _ after 
Galina Starovoitova, a liberal lawmaker and one of the few prominent 
women in Russian politics, whose slaying last week shocked and galvanized 
the nation. Many callers suggested names highlighting the U.S.-Russian 
partnership in the project, such as Duet or Tandem _ apparently oblivious 
to the other participants in the space station _ or the more pertinent 
Orchestra, Constellation or Accord. Other ideas: Galileo, Columbus, 
Adam or Eve, or Yuri Gagarin, after the first man in space, a Russian 
cosmonaut. But Russian space officials object to any name that suggests 
a beginning or a first, pointing out that their country has been flying 
space stations since Salyut 1 in 1971. And naming the station after 
a person goes against the Japanese tradition, which objects to giving 
human names to inanimate objects. Other names proposed in television 
contest included Mommy and the House of Good, ITAR-Tass said. Pessimists 
piped in with Armageddon, Babylon, and even Ivan Susanin _ after a 
17th century Russian who offered to show foreign invaders the way 
to the czar's camp, but instead led them to drown in a swamp and died 
together with them. TV-6 plans to send the proposals to Russia's space 
agency, which will offer its picks to international agencies, which 
still hope to come up with a livelier name than ISS.
