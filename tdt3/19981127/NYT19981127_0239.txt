Sticking to Britain's official hands-off policy in the Augusto Pinochet 
case, Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday that he did not even expect 
to be consulted about it, and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook assured 
his Chilean counterpart that any decisions would be made free of political 
considerations. Home Secretary Jack Straw, the British law enforcement 
minister responsible for deciding whether or not to go forward with 
a Spanish petition seeking the former Chilean dictator's extradition, 
obtained the extra time Friday that he had sought to make his decision. 
Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson postponed 
the hearing nine days until Dec. 11 and said he expected Pinochet 
to appear in court then. Spanish courts are seeking the extradition 
of the 83-year-old general to Madrid to stand trial on charges of 
genocide, terrorism and torture in the murders and ``disappearances'' 
of 3,178 people. He was arrested in London on Oct. 16 and later lost 
a legal effort in the House of Lords, England's highest court, to 
be declared immune to arrest because of his status as a former head 
of state. Cook said Jose Miguel Insulza, Chile's foreign minister, 
had communicated his government's ``strong view'' that Pinochet should 
be permitted to return home immediately. Cook said he had replied 
that the British government could not possibly interfere in what was 
a purely judicial matter. ``I explained that the next stage of the 
extradition process involved a decision by the home secretary acting 
independently and that this was not a matter for collective ministerial 
decision,'' Cook said in a statement. He said the one-hour meeting 
had been friendly and that he assured the Chilean that ``neither the 
original arrest nor subsequent steps had been politically motivated.'' 
Later Insulza visited 10 Downing Street where he met officials, but 
not the prime minister, and left a letter that a spokesman said would 
be passed on to the Home Office. Straw has said he would not be seeing 
any national delegations or representatives of interest groups in 
deciding whether or not to issue the so-called authority to proceed, 
but that he would consider arguments in writing. He has made no comment 
on the matter. Earlier Friday, 10 Downing Street confirmed that neither 
Blair nor other Cabinet colleagues would be involved in the decision 
by Straw, who is acting in a ``quasijudicial'' capacity. The spokesman 
for Blair said Straw ``will not be seeking the views of Cabinet colleagues,'' 
and added, ``The prime minister does not expect to be consulted on 
this at all.'' Pinochet is at Grovelands Priory Hospital in North 
London recovering from spinal surgery seven weeks ago. His doctors 
have said he is able to leave the hospital and he is expected to be 
moved into a house being rented by friends in days. Insulza flew here 
Friday amid growing expressions of concern from public figures and 
businessmen that the Pinochet case could damage British-Chilean relations 
and trade and destabilize democracy in Chile. The vice chairman of 
the British-Chilean Chamber of Commerce in Santiago wrote a letter 
to The Times of London, published Friday, that said the British government 
should be ``pragmatic in its relationships with its trading partners.'' 
He concluded, ``The government does not have a mandate to play Robin 
Hood to the world.'' Figures issued by the British-Chilean Chamber 
of Commerce based here show that Chile earns nearly twice as much 
as Britain _ $656 million compared with $351 million _ from trade 
between the two countries. Fears have been expressed about consumer 
boycotts of British goods in Chile, and there has already been one 
snub in the area of military purchases, which often brought Pinochet 
to Britain in recent years. After his arrest, two Chilean admirals 
canceled their procurement visit connected to a multimillion dollar 
deal involving the purchase of three navy frigates. Greater possibilities 
for business reprisals exist between Chile and Spain, which invested 
$1.8 billion in Chile last year in power sector takeovers, bank acquisitions 
and large construction projects. There is anger among Pinochet supporters 
in Chile against Spain because it was a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, 
who started the extradition case against the ex-dictator. Garzon has 
been conducting an inquiry into atrocities committed in the so-called 
``dirty wars'' of the 1970s and 1980s in Latin America.
