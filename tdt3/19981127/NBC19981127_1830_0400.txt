How one world war II veteran is making sure no one ever forgets. Dog, 
thinking: T-bone! T-bone! Looking for a T-bone! Chewy, meaty T-bone! 
At the big T-bone store! There's one! No, that's not one. Over there! 
no! no! On that shelf! ahh! Too green! Wait a minute! There! A whole 
package of little chewy, meaty T-bone steaks! Ya-hoo! I'm waking up! 
Mama brought you some T bonz dog snacks. Made with real meat, so dogs

It's a T-bone! Mornings seem so much brighter after a good night's

soothing, lemony hot liquid he feels comfort instantly. Soon, his 
throat feels calmed his cough quieted. Maximum strength theraflu. 
Now in new cherry sore throat and cough. Instant comfort. Powerful 
relief.
