On that note, when we come back after a break, this Friday after Thanksgiving, 
the tragedy uncovered by "dateline NBC" when well-intentioned charity 
dollars get hijacked and no one gets the help they need. Plorer. me? 
I like to stand out a bit. That's why I drive a Subaru outback. With 
a big cargo bay and all-wheel drive, you get all the sport-utility 
you need. With a smooth ride and better gas mileage, the outback is 
far from ordinary. Like me, really. What a weird looking bunch that 
was. It was one of those moments in life you want to keep. My husband 
thought he was getting dinner. My daughter...A new friend. Time to 
cook the lobster! When the moment came, I didn't have to worry about 
the light being low hey! That's my lobster! Or them turning out blurry 
because they were moving. With Kodak Max, I knew I'd get my picture. 
Low light, sunlight, action or still Kodak Max is all you need to 
know about film.
