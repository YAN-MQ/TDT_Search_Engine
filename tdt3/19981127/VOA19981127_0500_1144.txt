action as the Detroit Lions beat the Pittsburgh Steelers, 19-16 in 
overtime. Jason Hanson booted the winning field goal with 12 minutes 
and 8 seconds left in the extra period. The contest ended regulation 
tied at 16-16. During the overtime-coin toss, the referee had said 
Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis had called heads, when he called tails.
