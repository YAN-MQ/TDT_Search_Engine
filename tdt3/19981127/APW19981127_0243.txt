More U.N. inspectors have arrived in Baghdad to carry out searches 
of Iraq's suspected weapons sites and some teams went out on a field 
trip Friday, usually the weekly holiday for the inspectors. Reporters 
saw at least six more inspectors arriving Thursday at the Canal House, 
the U.N. headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad. They came on a 
U.N. flight from the Gulf state of Bahrain. U.N. teams have gone out 
daily since inspections resumed last week after Iraq canceled its 
ban on their work Nov. 14 under the threat of a U.S. and British attack. 
Caroline Cross, the spokeswoman for U.N. inspectors in Baghdad, said 
teams went out again Friday, the Muslim sabbath and a day that inspectors 
normally used to take off. ``We have a lot to do,'' Cross told The 
Associated Press. She did not elaborate. The United Nations has brought 
more inspectors to rebuild the full contingent present in Baghdad 
before the crisis, she said. The inspectors must certify that Iraq 
has destroyed its long-range missiles, chemical, nuclear and biological 
weapons and programs before an oil embargo and other U.N. sanctions 
can be lifted. The sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded 
Kuwait, starting the 1991 Gulf War. On Thursday, inspectors checked 
nine sites, including two not equipped with surveillance cameras or 
monitors, the Iraqi News Agency quoted Iraq's National Monitoring 
Directorate as saying. It said a team specializing in chemical searches 
checked two sites Thursday, but Cross refused to confirm that. Nuclear 
inspectors took samples from six sites in Baghdad, INA said. A Chicago-based 
aid group, Voices in the Wilderness, ended their weeklong trip to 
Baghdad on Friday. It donated medicine worth several thousand dollars 
to hospitals in Baghdad and Basra. The group has visited Iraq 18 times 
since the Gulf War.
