The Clinton administration has presented NATO with a far-reaching 
program seeking to define what the alliance has become since the Cold 
War ended and setting out its goals for the next century. But European 
opposition to American proposals on a number of issues threatens to 
undermine a 50th-anniversary NATO summit meeting planned in Washington 
next year. NATO diplomats said the agenda for the April meeting is 
designed partly to convince Congress that NATO is still central to 
American security, but that agenda has raised European concerns that 
the United States is trying to turn NATO into a freewheeling global 
vehicle for its own interests. At the root of the differences lies 
the American conviction that NATO should now be seen as ``an alliance 
of interests'' as much as one dedicated to the defense of a specific 
territory. Washington believes that those interests may in some instances 
push NATO into far-flung activities, including, for example, working 
to counter chemical and biological weapons, to stem the spread of 
nuclear weapons or to fight terrorism. ``Of course when America talks 
of the defense of interests, and not just territories, it leads to 
continued suspicions that the United States is seeking to globalize 
NATO,'' said a senior official who asked not to be identified. ``NATO 
is still Euro-Atlantic, but we should not artificially exclude what 
we might use NATO for.'' The Washington meeting amounts to a critical 
moment for NATO. It is intended to define NATO's new ``strategic concept'' 
after almost a decade of largely improvised adaptations to the post-Cold-War 
world. It will also set out a doctrine that takes the allies a very 
long way beyond the commitment to mutual self-defense that lay at 
the core of the Washington Treaty of 1949 that set up NATO. But after 
a summer and fall largely consumed by the crisis in Kosovo, and in 
the light of a bold American agenda clearly designed to represent 
President Clinton's legacy for the alliance, there is widespread concern 
at NATO headquarters that agreement is far from assured before the 
Washington meeting is held. A European official said the need to adapt 
NATO and formalize the changes that have taken place since 1989 was 
not in dispute. But he said several European countries were concerned 
that Washington wanted to push the alliance too far beyond its core 
European commitments and might be exaggerating threats to justify 
this. ``The Americans have put a program on the table that calls for 
NATO to play a major role in controlling and countering weapons of 
mass destruction _ nuclear, biological and chemical,'' he said. ``But 
we worry that America may be creating a new threat perception that 
will scare our populations with visions of anthrax and gangrene while 
allowing NATO to become a global organization.'' France, always concerned 
with what it sometimes calls ``American hegemony'' and keen to develop 
Europe's own defense abilities, and Germany, whose new coalition of 
Social Democrats and environmentalist Greens has a broadly anti-militarist 
bent, are among the countries wary of giving NATO too sweeping a mission, 
officials said. Russia, of course, is also deeply concerned. In particular, 
officials said, a sharp conflict exists over America's determination 
to include in NATO's new ``mission'' or ``vision'' statement (the 
precise term is under discussion) a stipulation that the alliance 
may, in exceptional circumstances, act without a specific mandate 
from the U.N. Security Council. In the absence of this margin for 
maneuver, American officials contend, NATO would effectively be placing 
itself at the mercy of a Russian or Chinese veto in the Security Council 
for any mission it wished to undertake, even in the event of an overwhelming 
humanitarian crisis. ``The lesson of Kosovo is that we need a modicum 
of flexibility,'' said a NATO diplomat. ``A Security Council mandate 
is highly desirable, but we should not tie our hands in advance.'' 
During the Kosovo crisis, despite Russian opposition and the absence 
of a specific Security Council mandate, NATO authorized possible military 
action against Yugoslavia. American officials, including the special 
envoy to the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke, said this decision amounted 
to an important precedent, but European officials generally argued 
that none had been set.
