Tiger Woods, in his first Japan PGA Tour tournament, shot a 2-over-par 
74 Friday to stand six shots behind second-round leader Hidemichi 
Tanaka in the Casio World Open. Woods, top-ranked in the world, chipped 
in from 40 yards for birdie on the first but bogeyed four straight 
holes from No. 6. He birdied the final hole en route to a 1-under 
143 total. Despite his lackluster round, Woods drew the biggest crowds 
and biggest cheers from the more than 5,000 spectators. Japan Open 
champion Tanaka fired a 69 with four birdies and a bogey for 7-under 
137 at the 7,105-yard (6,467-meter), par-72 Ibusuki Golf Club course. 
Overnight leader Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki, the youngest of three Ozaki 
brothers on the Japan tour, shot a 71 to share second place at 138 
with Toshimitsu Izawa, who turned in a 69. American Brian Watts, runner-up 
at the British Open, went around in 70 to stand tied for fourth at 
139 with compatriot Paul Stankowski and Nobumitsu Yuhara. The 150 
million yen (dlrs 1.25 million) event offers a top prize of 27 million 
yen (dlrs 225,000).
