Chile's Foreign Minister Miguel Insulsa is in London today to ask 
for the release of former military leader Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Insulsa 
is to meet with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook who has said 
many times that the Pinochet matter is up to the courts. The 83 year-old 
former dictator is under police guard in a London clinic since his 
arrest last month. He could be extradited to Spain to face charges 
of genocide and torture for actions committed during his 17 year-rule 
in Chile. Britain's highest court ruled this week that Mr. Pinochet 
does not have diplomatic immunity. The final decision about whether 
to extradite Mr. Pinochet is up to British Secretary Jack Straw. He 
was to have decided by Wednesday, but asked the courts for an additional 
week to further consider the matter.
