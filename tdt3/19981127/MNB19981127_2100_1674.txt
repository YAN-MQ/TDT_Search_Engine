On Wall Street, we should update you on the numbers. The trading day 
was short. The market got a jump on the holiday weekend, shutting 
down early. But the Dow ending about 19 points up. For the week, the 
Dow jumped more than 173 points. NASDAQ rose over 31 today to a record 
high of 2016. For the week, it was up more than 88 points. Perhaps 
that's why all the buying optimism out there.
