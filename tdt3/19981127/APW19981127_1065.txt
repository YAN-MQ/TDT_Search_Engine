All eight kangaroos at a zoo in southern Russia _ including six expectant 
mothers _ were found mauled to death in their pen Friday, zookeepers 
said. Officials at the Rostov-on-Don Zoo suspect the animals were 
killed by attack dogs incited by their trainers, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency and Russia's NTV television network reported. Bloody adult 
kangaroo carcasses lay in the snow of the pen in footage showed on 
NTV. A teary-eyed zoo worker, Marina Kilovatova, held frozen kangaroos 
fetuses in her hand. ``For someone who works in a zoo, their animals 
are like their children,'' she said. Two male adults and six female 
adults were killed, ITAR-Tass said. The zoo in Rostov, about 1,000 
kilometers (600 miles) south of Moscow, was closed while police investigate 
the attack. Zoo officials said it would cost dlrs 50,000 to replace 
each of the kangaroos, NTV reported.
