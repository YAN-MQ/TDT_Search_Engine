If visiting Chinese President Jhang Zhe Minh was looking for a straight 
forward written apology for Japanese wartime behavior in China, he 
didn't get it. VOA's Roger Wilkerson reports, that and differences 
over Taiwan marred an otherwise reasonable successful summit. Mr. 
Obuchi issued a verbal apology for Japan's wartime atrocities in China. 
But that is not what Mr. Jhang wanted from the summit. He was looking 
for a written statement, apologizing to the Chinese people for Japan's 
war crimes. That is what Tokyo gave South Korea earlier this month, 
and China expected nothing less. The joint statement issued at the 
end of the meeting contains Mr. Obuchi's expression of deep remorse 
for the harm Japan caused China before and during World War II. But 
that falls short of an apology. So, Mr. Jhang decided not to sign 
the statement. The two leaders expressed their desire to build a strong 
partnership in the next century. The Japanese news media reports that 
Mr. Jhang told Mr. Obuchi the relationship cannot reach its full potential 
until Japan acknowledges its wartime past. Spokesmen for both sides 
downplay the non-signing of the joint statement. A Japanese foreign 
ministry official said, no signing ceremony was scheduled anyway. 
Chinese spokesman, Dru Banzou told reporters that Mr. Jhang and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin did not sign the joint statements that were 
issued following their meeting earlier this week. Mr. Dru says that 
what is important is the substance of the statement, not the fact 
that it was not signed. China also failed to get what it wanted from 
Japan on the Taiwan issue. It was looking for a clear statement from 
Tokyo similar to the pledge it got from President Clinton earlier 
this year. Mr. Clinton says the United States does not support Taiwan's 
independence or its membership in international organizations requiring 
statehood. Japan would offer nothing more than a reiteration of its 
past statements, that it recognizes only one China, that it understands 
China's claim to Taiwan, and that its own relationships with Taiwan 
are not official. China is concerned that newly revised US/Japan Defense 
Guidelines could be applied to Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a 
wayward province, and therefore an internal Chinese affair. Roger 
Wilkerson, VOA News, Tokyo.
