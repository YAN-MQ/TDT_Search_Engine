Rob Ticktin, "CNN Headline Sports." Ricky Williams became the leading 
rusher in division I history, as his longhorns edged sixth-ranked 
Texas A&M 26-24. The senior tailback broke Tony dorsett's 22-year-old 
Mark. He finished the day with 259 yards off 44 carries. Where does 
this moment rank with Williams? It has got to be number one. Because 
my last game at home, and running out in front of all the fans and 
the fans going crazy. And "run Ricky run" everywhere was just a great 
feeling.
