By sunrise on this day after Thanksgiving, a lot of people were already 
hot on the trail of bargains. Across the country, retailers were opening 
in the wee hours of the morning, slashing prices and doing whatever 
else it took to attract customers on the traditional opening day of 
the holiday shopping season. Merchants and retail analysts have been 
voicing quiet optimism about this year's prospects. Shoppers appeared 
to be in a spending mood. The economy looks good. The stock market 
is back up, and it's time to buy for Christmas. I feel the same way. 
We don't dip into savings. We budget what we're going to buy and spend 
within our means. It's a very competitive industry and a very competitive 
time so, and the consumers are very value conscious. So retailers 
all over the country are pricing their goods as low as they can in 
order to make that sale.
