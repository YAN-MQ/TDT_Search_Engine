Giant cranes untangled piled up train carriages Friday to uncover 
more victims _ many of the mangled beyond recognition _ from the wreckage 
of a two-train collision, bringing the number of bodies recovered 
to 148. Officials said 260 people were injured and about 30 were in 
critical condition in hospitals across the northern state of Punjab. 
Teams of doctors operated all night, amputating the legs or hands 
of some of the victims of Thursday's accident. Rescue workers, fighting 
the stench of rotting flesh, tore apart the wreckage to dig out the 
victims. No survivors have been found since midday Thursday. ``Many 
of the bodies are badly mutilated. We may never be able to identify 
them,'' said A. K. Kapoor, a top official of the government-owned 
railroad company who was supervising the rescue operations. Work speeded 
up after the arrival of the huge crane that could lift an entire train 
car. Some 5,000 workers supported the wobbly wreckage with planks 
of wood and steel beams. Others used acetylene torches or crowbars. 
``We're hoping to clear the tracks tonight,'' Kapoor told reporters 
in this northern wheat-trading town, 250 kilometers (150 miles) northwest 
of New Delhi. The Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express collided with cars 
that had uncoupled from the Frontier Mail en route from New Delhi 
and had toppled into the path of the oncoming train on parallel tracks 
in pre-dawn mist. A day after the accident, relatives of the victims 
began arriving in Khanna to identify their kin. The injured were scattered 
in hospitals and medical colleges, depending on their injuries. For 
Ram Pravesh the search ended Friday noon. After endless visits hospitals 
with local volunteers, he found the body of his father, Ram Nageena. 
The 10-year-old boy fainted at the sight of the body on a block of 
ice at the local college playground that had been turned into a makeshift 
mortuary. Ram Pravesh, a native of Bharukpur village in Uttar Pradesh 
was traveling to Punjab to work with his father on a farm. Authorities 
sent messengers to his village to inform his mother and sister. India 
records around 300 accidents a year on its railways, the largest rail 
network under one management in the world. Most are blamed on human 
error or outdated equipment. Friday's newspapers said safety recommendations 
are often ignored in the rush to expand the network, often to please 
voters.The government-owned railroad company added 500 trains in the 
last four years. The worst accident was three years ago when two trains 
collided near New Delhi, killing 358 people. The Indian Express newspaper 
said a flashing light on the engine and last coach of the train _ 
a recommendation of numerous safety committees _ might have prevented 
the accident. The government has said it has little money for better 
equipment. More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India 
every day on 67,000 kilometers (41,875 miles) of track.
