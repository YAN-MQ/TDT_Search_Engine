Also in the gridiron, Number 17, Nebraska hosts Colorado. First year 
Nebraska Coach, Frank Sollifz say it will be a tough test for the 
Cornhuskers. It should be a good matchup in a lot of ways. You know 
I think both teams are wanting to finish this thing off right, finishing 
it off well. It's important to, certainly both programs, both teams. 
And so it will be a hard-fought contest. In other actions, seventh-ranked 
Arizona hosts Arizona State in the resumption of a heated in-state 
rivalry. LSU plays on the road against 13th ranked Arkansas.
