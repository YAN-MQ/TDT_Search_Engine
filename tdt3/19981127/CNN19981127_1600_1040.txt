Get ready to find more burgers in your bugs. McDonald's is expanding 
the markets blitz tied to the Walt Disney film, "A bug's life." Now 
McDonald's will go beyond its usual happy meal promotions and begin 
advertising directly at movie theaters. The move marks a shift in 
marketing strategy for the burger behemoth. Disney has already featured 
McDonald's in a number of recent movies and TV shows on its ABC network. 
Analysts expect the expanded relationship will be worth millions for 
both companies.
