Back on their home ice, Russians swept the podium Friday in the women's 
event at the Cup of Russia. Yelena Sokolova secured her lead after 
the short program to win her second event this year. Two weeks earlier 
she won the Nations Cup in Germany. The 18-year-old Sokolova, a rising 
star in Russian skating ranks, performed to a blues number and nailed 
her triple lutz-double toe loop combination and triple loop jumps. 
Sokolova is the only Russian skater to fulfill a triple-triple combination 
this year. Julia Soldatova was in second after Friday's skating at 
the Cup of Russia, the fifth event in the International Skating Union's 
Grand Prix, which features Olympic-eligible skaters and is being held 
in Moscow for the first time. Irina Slutskaya, 19, the 1995 world 
junior champion and second to Michelle Kwan in the 1998 World Championship, 
dropped to third. Japan's Yuka Kanazawa placed fourth, Laetitia Hubert 
of France was fifth and Anna Rechnio of Poland was sixth. ``We have 
achieved a new level of women skating in Russia now,'' renowned Russian 
coach Yelena Chaikovskaya. ``There are new Olympic champions sitting 
here in front of you.'' Russians were the first in pairs as well. 
World champions Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze secured their 
success in the short program to win the event. Tamara Moskvina, their 
coach, is also coaching American pair Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman, 
who held third in the competition. ``Yes, I'm coaching Russians and 
Americans, but it's like an adopted child: Do you make a distinction 
between your own and a new one?'' she asked reporters. ``Definitely 
there's a competition between them, but on the ice ... they are alone. 
It's up to them.'' Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao of China moved from the 
fifth place to the second. Russian World ice dance champions Angelika 
Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov are leading in the ice dances after the 
original dance, the waltz. They made their season debut two weeks 
ago to win the Nations Cup in Germany. The Cup concludes Saturday 
with free skating in the men's competition, as well as the free dance. 
Winners receive dlrs 30,000. Skaters can accumulate points from two 
of the meets to qualify for the series final in St. Petersburg, Russia, 
in March. The next event is NHK Trophy in Sapporo, Japan, in December.
