Hundreds of trucks and heavy equipment blocked traffic in smaller 
towns and villages Friday across the Czech Republic in a protest against 
imports of cheap pork from European Union countries. The protest, 
scheduled to last two hours, was aimed at ``forcing the government 
to better protect its farmers,'' Drahomir Tobias of the Czech Agriculture 
Chamber told the public Czech Radio. ``Prices of a number of commodities 
have already dropped sharply due to the subsidized imports from abroad,'' 
Tobias said. Farmers claim the Czech market has been flooded with 
cheap pork products from abroad and most Czech pork producers will 
go bankrupt if the state doesn't intervene. The government Wednesday 
raised duties on certain pork products from 15 percent to 40 percent, 
but farmers said it isn't enough. ``The protests are aimed against 
the methods of the EU and against importers of cheap pork,'' the chairman 
of the Agriculture Chamber, Vaclav Hlavacek, said. The Czech Republic 
has witnessed a sharp increase in pork imports in the past two months 
as EU countries have lost their Russian markets.
