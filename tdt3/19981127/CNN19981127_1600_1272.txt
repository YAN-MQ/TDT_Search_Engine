Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." Longhorn Ricky Williams 
ripped off a long one and plenty more in becoming the leading rusher 
in division I history, breaking the record set by 1976 heisman trophy 
winner Tony dorsett 22 years ago. Williams finished with 259 yards 
on the day, giving him 6,279 in his career. But he fumbled twice to 
help Texas blow a 15-point lead, only to rally and then top Texas 
A&M on Chris Stockton's fourth field goal of the game in the final 
seconds, 26-24. Arizona goes after win number 11 on the season a bit 
later. 13th-ranked Arkansas is squaring off with LSU, while Colorado 
is at Nebraska, both teams looking to avoid a four-lossson.
