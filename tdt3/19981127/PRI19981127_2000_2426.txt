OK, get ready, it's time, once again, for today's geography puzzler. 
The residents of today's mystery location speak Japanese, but they 
do it in a way that anyone can tell exactly where they're from. In 
fact, Japanese comedians use the accent to get laughs. Our destination 
is said to be a great place to refresh yourself after an overdose 
of Tokyo's high-stressed day life and very active night life. Located 
in Central Japan on Honshu Island, this city was Japan's first capital 
and there have been suggestions to make it the capital again. Now, 
just up the road, are the cities of Itama and Ikada, which became 
well-known as major brewing centers for rice wine or sake. We'll have 
the answer to today's quiz in a few minutes and we'll down it with 
some delicious unrefined cloudy sake from today's sake festival in 
Tokyo.
