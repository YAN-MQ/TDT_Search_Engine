The unsolved murder of a Michigan family three decades ago has left 
townspeople in good Hart emotionally ruined. Now, one man wants to 
get to the bottom of the case. Ed Garsten has the story. Along a two-Lane 
road basking in the beauty of a perfect fall palette is a place called 
good Hart. But behind the rustic beauty of this northern Michigan 
burg, is a very grisly past that the folks here can't forget, but 
would rather not talk about. It's one of the secrets of the community. 
Everyone thinks they know who did it. And everyone's got a different 
opinion on it. "it" happened 30 years ago in a rough hewn cabin in 
a section called blisswood. On June 24th, 1968, Richard and Shirley 
robison and their four children were shot to death. 8-year-old Susan 
was also bludgeoned with a hammer. The bodies weren't discovered for 
27 days. The man who was the prosecutor at the time will never forget 
the scene. The scene was bad, I mean really bad. And to this day, 
the crime has never been solved. Police were ready to charge Joseph 
scolaro, robison's partner at this suburban Detroit advertising business. 
But he committed suicide. After that, the investigation remained inert. 
Then Tom Mair came along. He made the lucky decision to turn down 
an invitation from his friend Randy robison to spend the summer of 
'68 at the cabin. Now Mair is devoting most of his waking hours to 
cracking the case. It stayed with me to different degrees throughout 
my entire childhood and adult life. Mair says he believes he knows 
who did it, but admits, there is no physical evidence and no known 
motive. Other than the fact that he knew the family and he's probably 
the only person that we know of, or that I know of, who knew the family 
who was later found out to be a violent criminal. Former prosecutor 
Smith is sure the murders were a botched contract killing paid for 
by scolaro. That he hired somebody and showed them the way and perhaps 
even accompanied them. And then it got out of control. The only intention 
was to kill the father and they killed the whole family. a nonprofit 
agency is now offering a $2,500 reward for tips that lead to the arrest 
and conviction of whoever may have killed the robison family. But 
curiously, the folks here, like general store owner Carolyn sutherland, 
would just as soon leave things be, keeping their theories to themselves 
and the secret never revealed. This is good Hart's own little mystery.
