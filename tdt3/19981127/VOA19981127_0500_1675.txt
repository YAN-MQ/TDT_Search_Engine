Police in Natick, Massachusetts have reported a near escape from a 
jail cell at the local police station. It not only violates the usual 
laws, but it might almost appear to violate the laws of physics. Police 
say an 18 year-old larceny suspect disappeared from the small cinder 
block cell. What is particularly remarkable is that there was no way 
out of the room except a small slot in the door that was there for 
a food tray. That slot had been left open for the suspect, Joetan 
Cooper, to take his breakfast. The slot measures just 18 centimeters 
by 43 centimeters. Police say it was just wide enough though for Mr. 
Cooper to wriggle through to a hallway. You see he is about 1.7 meters 
tall, and weighs about 58 kilograms. After a 20-minute search, though, 
Nadick police found Joetan Cooper inside the same building. Actually 
he was in a nearby room, and apparently looking for an even smaller 
opening to get out.
