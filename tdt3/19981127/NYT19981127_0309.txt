Finally, the Big East has a football game the nation can sink its 
teeth into: Miami at Syracuse in the Carrier Dome on Saturday afternoon 
for the Big East Conference Championship. I'm not sure if this is 
your experience, but whenever I mention the Big East in a discussion 
of big-time college football, faces go blank, eyes glaze over. Big 
East football doesn't ignite passion. But Saturday afternoon's game 
is different. Each program has a lot to gain and a lot to lose, in 
both the long term and the short term. The winner captures the Big 
East championship outright. The winner then will play in either the 
Sugar or the Orange Bowl, and the loser will play in a lesser bowl. 
Miami (ranked No. 19 by The Associated Press and No. 12 by The New 
York Times) has won the conference championship five times. Syracuse 
(No. 21 AP, No. 16 The Times) has never won it outright. Syracuse 
(7-3), which has aspired but failed to leap into the elite level of 
college football, has a rich tradition, though a tradition on which 
it has lived for the last three decades. ``We have destiny in our 
hands now,'' said Syracuse fullback Rob Konrad. ``This is one of the 
biggest games ever in the dome.'' Ever since the Big East committed 
geographic fraud and pulled Miami into the conference in 1991, the 
idea was to have Miami put Big East football on the map. Miami was 
the Big Show in college football. Under coach Jimmy Johnson and then 
coach Dennis Erickson in the 1980s and early 1990s, the Hurricanes 
talked trash, they taunted and they won. Those Hurricanes took a certain 
joy in coming into the Carrier Dome and crushing Syracuse's dreams 
of regaining the glory of yesteryear; when Ben Schwartzwalder coached 
the Orangemen from 1949-1973; when Jim Brown wore No. 44 in the 1950s; 
when Ernie Davis wore No. 44 and won the Heisman trophy in 1961. But 
Miami, 6-1 against Syracuse, never let the Orangemen get back on top. 
Butch Davis took over as coach of Miami in 1995. Last season Miami, 
humbled by two years of probation and the loss of scholarships, was 
humiliated by Syracuse in Miami, 33-13. It was Miami's first losing 
season in 18 years (5-6). ``We're writing a new chapter in Miami football,'' 
said Scott Covington, Miami's fifth-year senior quarterback. ``This 
game is another milestone for us.'' Covington is one of three fifth-year 
seniors on the team. He remembers the Miami of old. And cherishes 
the tradition. ``What rubbed people the wrong way about the old Miami 
is that we were successful,'' Covington said. ``They took their helmets 
off, they talked trash. Not that we don't want to do that now; we 
can't.'' The `old' Hurricanes helped inspire a wave of puritan-based 
celebration reforms that incarcerated fun and put players in straitjackets. 
The folks who run college football enforce rules and lose track of 
the natural exuberance of play. Miami, more than any other team, exuded 
fun in the late '80s and early '90s. The new Hurricanes (7-2) have 
an eye for fun, but Covington and his fellow fifth-year seniors have 
preached the importance of a process. ``To be able to do those things 
you need to win big games, win at other people's stadium,'' he said. 
`You need to justify what you do.'' This game flows into a larger 
ocean. Next week Miami plays third-ranked UCLA in a game that was 
scheduled to be played weeks ago but was postponed because of a hurricane. 
Back then, Miami was just beginning to come together. Now, in a span 
of eight days, Miami has an opportunity to play for the Big East championship 
and take on a Goliath of college football. ``Our goal at the beginning 
of the season was to win the conference and go to a major bowl game,'' 
Covington said. ``So in that respect the Syracuse game is more important. 
But to be one of the few games on television, to be able to spoil 
someone's bid for a national championship _ that's the biggest game. 
Either way we can't lose.'' Michael Lawson, a fifth-year defensive 
lineman at Miami, loves it. A bridge between the old Hurricanes and 
the new, Lawson said the Miami legacy is back, simply repackaged to 
meet the new rules. ``We still gesture, we still talk, but it's not 
as magnified as it was,'' Lawson said, adding that all trash talking 
has to be more subtle now. ``But if you listen real close, you'll 
still hear the taunting and talking.` Passions are flowing on each 
side. When he was asked how he would control the Hurricanes, Syracuse 
defensive back Phil Nash said: ``Just hit 'em in the mouth. That's 
all we're going to do. That's what we want to do. If we hit 'em in 
the mouth as soon as they get out there, letting them know that we 
come to play, they won't have a chance.'' Finally the Big East has 
its game of the century.
