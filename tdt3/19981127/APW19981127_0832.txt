A magistrate on Friday gave the government more time to decide whether 
to go ahead with extradition proceedings for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, 
or let the former Chilean leader go home. Home Secretary Jack Straw 
won an extra week, until Dec. 11, to reach a decision. Chief Metropolitan 
Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson said he would expect Pinochet 
to appear in court on that date, ``subject to any medical reports.'' 
``Obviously this is a decision which must be made and there must be 
time given for proper consideration of all the representations. It 
is in some respects quite a historic decision to make,'' Parkinson 
told attorneys representing Britain, Spain and Pinochet. Pinochet, 
who is sought by Spanish authorities on charges of genocide, torture 
and terrorism committed during his 17-year regime, remains under police 
guard at a London hospital, where he is recovering from back surgery 
earlier this month. Britain's highest court of appeal ruled on Wednesday 
that Pinochet could not claim immunity as a former head of state. 
Chile's Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, whose government has 
pressed for Pinochet's freedom, flew to London Friday to meet Foreign 
Secretary Robin Cook. ``I have explained to him and he understands 
this, that this is a matter for the due legal process _ it's not a 
matter for diplomatic negotiations,'' Cook told reporters before meeting 
his Chilean counterpart. Following an hour-long meeting, Cook issued 
a statement saying he had assured Insulza ``neither the original arrest 
nor subsequent steps had been politically motivated.'' ``We both expressed 
our shared commitment to maintaining good relations between our two 
countries,'' Cook added. Prime Minister, graf 9
