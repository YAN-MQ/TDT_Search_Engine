Although Bill Bradley has said he will decide in December whether 
to run for president, several of his former longtime aides and close 
advisers say they believe that he has already made up his mind to 
seek the Democratic nomination. The associates say that they have 
watched Bradley _ who served three terms as a U.S. senator from New 
Jersey before retiring in 1996 _ wrestle with this decision in 1988, 
and again in 1992, and that all signs point this time to a Bradley 
for president campaign in 2000. ``He looks more like he is going to 
do it than I have ever seen him,'' said Marcia Aronoff, who was Bradley's 
chief of staff for 13 years. ``I think his feeling is that this is 
a time when he can make a major contribution. And if he does it, I 
don't think he is doing it quixotically. He would be running to win.'' 
New Jersey state Senate Democratic leader Richard Codey said he also 
believed that Bradley had decided to run. ``If I were a betting man, 
I would bet that he goes,'' said Codey, who has already begun lining 
up Democratic county leaders in New Jersey behind a Bradley presidential 
campaign. Although Bradley has not raised any money to mount a campaign, 
some of his advisers say he has been quietly talking to potential 
donors for support that he can begin tapping in January. He has also 
asked some leading Democrats in New Jersey and around the country 
to consider withholding support and endorsements for other presidential 
contenders until he makes his decision. Then there are the dozen states, 
including Iowa and California, he has visited in recent months to 
campaign for fellow Democrats. In an interview, Bradley said he was 
not plotting his next political move based on who is running and who 
is not. He said he was not paying attention to the political analysts 
who say that Vice President Al Gore has the Democratic nomination 
already locked up because of the power of incumbency, the outcome 
of the midterm elections and the lack of an independent counsel investigation 
into campaign fund-raising. In keeping with his reputation for introspection, 
Bradley said he was once again relying on his inner voice to guide 
his decision. ``In 1988, I looked at myself in the mirror and I said, 
`I am not ready,' '' he recalled. ``In 1992, I said, `You are ready, 
but don't do it.' I honored that inner voice and didn't do it. And 
I'm back with this question again.'' ``I am not on the phone calling 
50 friends, asking them what I should do,'' he continued. ``Basically, 
there are only two threshold questions. One is where I think that 
whatever experience or ability or talents that I have can be used 
to improve the quality of life for millions of Americans, at this 
particular moment in time. The second question is whether I want to 
put my wife and family through what one seems to have to go through.'' 
Although Bradley's advisers say they believe he has decided to run 
this time, they are not quitting their jobs or printing placards yet. 
``Veteran Bradley watchers know that until he tells you what he is 
going to do, all of the speculation and predictions are precisely 
that,'' said Anita Dunn, a former aide who is now a partner at Squier, 
Knapp, Ochs &AMP; Dunn, a political consulting firm in Washington. 
``But I do think this time is different. He is seriously considering 
it.'' Some of his advisers say that this is perhaps his last shot. 
After publicly flirting with the idea for a decade now, he risks being 
placed next to former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo in the pantheon of 
modern-day Hamlets. They also point out that he has the support of 
his family and that his wife, Ernestine, is in good health after battling 
breast cancer six years ago. Since 1993, the Bradleys have lived in 
Montclair, a suburb of older, gracious homes, and Mrs. Bradley has 
been a professor of German and comparative literature at Montclair 
State University. Mrs. Bradley accompanied her husband to a recent 
speech he delivered before 400 people at Montclair High School, and 
when asked by a reporter whether she would support his political aspirations, 
she said, ``Whatever Bill wants to do, I will support him.'' It has 
been two years since Bradley _ who is 55, a former Rhodes Scholar, 
a 1964 Olympic Gold Medalist in basketball, a member of the New York 
Knicks for their championships in 1970 and 1973 and now a best-selling 
author with ``Values of the Game'' _ left the U.S. Senate, saying 
he was weary of the partisan bickering. He left open the possibility 
of a presidential bid in 2000 and dismissed those who said that giving 
up his Senate seat would make running for the presidency more difficult, 
if not impossible. ``I think sometimes giving up power is a form of 
power,'' he said at the time. ``To some people, that is self-evident. 
Other people have to work at that thought a little bit.'' He has tested 
some of his ideas in the last two years, with teaching stints at Notre 
Dame, Stanford and the University of Maryland. He was also an essayist 
on the weekend edition of ``The CBS Evening News'' and worked with 
various groups, including a project to promote changes in campaign 
finance laws and another that trains college students to work in political 
campaigns. If he does decide to run, he faces considerable hurdles 
from the well-financed and well-organized political machine of Gore, 
and from other possible Democratic contenders. The list includes House 
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri; Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts; 
Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. 
``I think that there is going to be a heavy burden to make a case 
that outlines any real substantive differences with Al Gore,'' said 
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who won Bradley's old seat. ``The 
Democratic Party does not suffer from real ideological differences 
at the moment. To challenge an incumbent vice president, there is 
a burden to make some real contrasts on policy.'' To distinguish himself 
from Gore, Bradley would mount an insurgent, ``out-of-the-Beltway'' 
type of campaign that would try to appeal directly to voters, one 
of his advisers said. Bradley might also rely on expertise he has 
developed during his 18 years in the Senate on issues from Third World 
debt to race relations. He would also begin immediately to try to 
raise about $25 million so that he could aggressively compete in the 
presidential primaries now bunched in March. (New Jersey is considering 
legislation to move its primary to March from June.) Bradley has not 
run a campaign since he nearly lost to Christie Whitman in his 1990 
Senate re-election race. But recent public polls show that he looks 
good to his former constituents for a White House bid. But first, 
he has to decide to run and then announce it. ``He knows where he 
is going,'' Codey said. ``He is in no rush to get there, at times. 
It is as if he is not making a political decision when, in fact, it 
is all about politics.''
