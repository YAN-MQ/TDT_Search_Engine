Jonathan Kwitny, a journalist and author whose subjects varied from 
Mafia forays into board rooms to papal biography, died Nov. 26 at 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 57 and lived in Cuddebackville, 
N.Y., and Manhattan. The cause was stomach cancer diagnosed in July, 
said a friend, Anthony Scaduto, a writer. Kwitny's latest book was 
``Man of the Century: The Life and Times of Pope John Paul II'' (Holt, 
1997). In it, Kwitny melded journalism and history to chronicle not 
merely a life but also the world events that surrounded the pope's 
tenure. A decade ago, Kwitny and a producer, Tom Naughton, created 
``The Kwitny Report'' for the Public Broadcasting System. Backed by 
a team of staff and free-lance reporters, Kwitny wrote and narrated 
the weekly national half-hour news program, which won a George Polk 
Award for investigative reporting in 1990. Another of his books, ``Endless 
Enemies: The Making of an Unfriendly World'' (Congdon &AMP; Weed, 
1984) was a critique of U.S. foreign policy. It got considerable critical 
attention and was a runner-up for the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction. 
Jonathan Kwitny was born in Indianapolis, graduated from the University 
of Missouri in 1962 with a journalism degree and received a master's 
degree at New York University in 1964. He started a newspaper career 
working as a reporter for The Evening News of Perth Amboy, N.J., from 
1963 to 1969, with two years out as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nigeria. 
In 1971, he joined The Wall Street Journal as staff writer producing 
front-page columns and articles about national and international topics. 
He stayed with The Journal until his move to PBS in 1988. Most recently, 
he worked for the Gannett newspaper group guiding Trenton coverage 
for its New Jersey papers. He also served as a consultant on Pope 
John Paul for ``NBC Nightly News.'' The first of his eight books was 
``The Fountain Pen Conspiracy'' (Knopf, 1973), which told how investment 
swindlers work. His other titles included ``Vicious Circles: The Mafia 
in the Marketplace'' (Norton, 1979), and ``The Crimes of Patriots: 
A True Tale of Dope, Dirty Money and the CIA.'' (Norton, 1987). Kwitny 
is survived by his wife of five years, Wendy Wood Kwitny; two sons, 
James W., 22 months, and Peter B., 5 months old; two daughters by 
a previous marriage, Susanna Lynn Kwitny of Norwalk, Conn., and Carolyn 
Romasz of Saratoga, N.Y.; his mother, Julia Goldberger Kwitny of Indianapolis, 
and one grandson. His first wife, Martha Kaplan Kwitny, died in 1978.
