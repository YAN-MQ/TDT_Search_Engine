Carlos Moya, who had not won an indoor match all year until this week, 
reached the semifinals of the ATP Tour World Championship when he 
beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov 7-5, 7-5 on Friday. Moya is usually not much 
of a threat on indoor courts and prefers clay, the surface on which 
he won the French Open, and hard courts. Although indoors, the ATP 
championship is played on a hard court and Moya has done well at this 
elite season-ending event, reaching the semifinals for the second 
consecutive year. By avenging his semifinal loss to Kafelnikov last 
year, he ousted the Russian from the dlrs 3.5 million tournament that 
nominally brings the top eight players of the year. ``I was perhaps 
luckier in important moments,'' Moya said. ``I had to be like a wall, 
put back every ball. I was mentally stronger than last year.'' Moya, 
No. 4 in the world, joined top-ranked Pete Sampras and Tim Henman 
in the last four and will face Henman on Saturday. Moya's first indoor 
victory of the season after five defeats came at the start of the 
round-robin portion, when he beat Karol Kucera. He lost to Sampras 
and finished behind him in one of the four-man groups. In later matches, 
Henman played Greg Rusedski and Alex Corretja battled Albert Costa. 
Corretja can clinch the last semifinal spot if he beats Costa. Sampras 
had a day off and an opportunity to savor his historic achievement 
_ holding to the No. 1 ranking for the sixth consecutive year. ``I'll 
try to stay on top for as long as possible,'' Sampras said after breaking 
the record he held jointly with Jimmy Connors. There are new milestones 
to achieve as well: Sampras is one title short of the 12 Grand Slam 
tournaments won by Roy Emerson. And there is the French Open on clay, 
the only one Sampras hasn't won. ``That's the biggest challenge,'' 
he said. Staying No. 1 for six consecutive years, Sampras said, required 
a lot of hard work. ``It was well worth the sacrifice,'' he said just 
before champagne was poured over his head at a little ceremony. He 
returned the favor, showering ATP Tour chief Mark Miles and promoter 
Ion Tiriac. There was also a cake representing the figure six, with 
a chocolate tennis ball inside the circle. ``It's an ultimate achievement, 
it will probably never be broken,'' he said. ``I'm trying to stay 
humble through all this, but the record speaks for itself. It's a 
little overwhelming.'' Sampras was assured of the record when Marcelo 
Rios of Chile, the only player with a chance to overtake him, pulled 
out of the ATP championship because of a back injury. Rios trailed 
Sampras 33 points on the computer rankings. Having won his first two 
round-robin matches, Sampras was already assured a semifinal berth 
before he played Karol Kucera on Thursday. A relaxed Sampras then 
demonstrated why he is No. 1, crushing Kucera 6-2, 6-1 in 45 minutes. 
Kucera is No. 7 and beat Sampras once in their three previous matches 
this year. If Sampras wins this tournament for the fifth time, he 
will pull even with Ivan Lendl on the career list. Sampras won the 
event in 1991, 1994 and the last two years. After Andre Agassi, Rios 
was the second player to pull out of the tournament that nominally 
brings together the top eight players of the year.
