Nick Price and two South Africans shared the lead at the half-way 
mark of the Zimbabwe Open golf championship Friday. Price is joined 
by Tjaart van der Walt and Warren Abery on 137, seven under par, after 
he shot a bogey free 68 over the Royal Harare course that he redesigned 
two years ago. ``After some serious practice, was driving well today 
and only missed one fairway _ and that by just a yard,'' Price said. 
``I actually played better than my 68 and if I could have read the 
breaks on the greens I would have had a lower score.'' Price has won 
his own country's open title twice and he is the current champion. 
Previous winner and fellow Zimbabwean Tony Johnstone is on 140 and 
well in contention. Compatriot Mark McNulty, a double winner, is on 
144 and he might now have too much to do. Best round of the day was 
by Adilson da Silva, a Brazilian. His 67 put him on 141 among a group 
of nine players. In fourth place behind the leading trio is Mark Wiltshire, 
one shot further back. Fifth is Darren Fitchardt on 140 after an adventurous 
68 which included an eagle, six birdies and four dropped shots. Van 
der Walt, who finished third in the Zimbabwe Open last year is seen 
as the most likely of Price's main rivals to mount a serious challenge 
to the world number eight over the weekend.
