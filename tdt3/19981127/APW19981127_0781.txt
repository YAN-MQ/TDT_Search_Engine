South Africa on Friday began compiling its first all-race voter list, 
but confusion marred the day and even President Nelson Mandela registered 
at the wrong site. South Africans lined up at schools, churches and 
other sites to register for the 1999 election, the first since the 
1994's all-race balloting which marked the end of apartheid. In Soweto, 
a sprawling black township and the scene of frequent uprisings against 
white rule, about 50 men and women sat quietly in a classroom at a 
run-down school with broken windows, awaiting their turn to register. 
Some waited as long as six hours. As a woman with a baby bound to 
her back by a blanket stood up to register, one man murmured: ``We 
don't mind waiting. For us, it is important to vote.'' There was less 
patience in a community center in the integrated, run-down Johannesburg 
neighborhood of Yeoville, where dozens of people were turned away 
after being told they were in the wrong place. It was only on Friday 
that many of the 12.7 million potential voters in the northern section 
of the country learned which registration site they should go to. 
Instructions were often vague and many sites didn't open because civil 
servants who were supposed to staff them failed to appear. The southern 
half of the country registers on Dec. 4-6. Opposition parties blasted 
the government. ``The chaotic start of the registration process poses 
a serious threat to a free and fair election,'' said the National 
Party, which ruled during apartheid. Mandela went to an elementary 
school in Johannesburg and duly registered in front of photographers, 
but later was told the Independent Electoral Commission had directed 
him to the wrong place, said Thabo Masebe, spokesman for the ruling 
African National Congress. Masebe said Mandela would probably have 
to reregister. ``I'm so sick of the muddle and disorganization of 
the bloody ANC government,'' complained Barbara Durlacher, a 65-year-old 
white who was told she was at the wrong site. Mandela, however, beckoned 
whites to join the ANC and abandon the National Party that ruled during 
apartheid and turned South Africa into ``the world's polecat.'' He 
told a Foreign Correspondents Association dinner Thursday night that 
the ANC needed a two-thirds majority in parliament ``to ensure that 
we are not interfered with by Mickey Mouse parties who have no commitment 
to democracy.'' The majority would allow the party to independently 
pass legislation. Election officials, soldiers and civil servants 
including teachers and secretaries helped people register. Among problems 
Friday: _The IEC failed to set up registration stations for nearly 
10,000 potential voters in areas of North West Province, the ANC charged. 
_The school where Mandela was supposed to have registered was one 
of about 50 registration points in eastern Johannesburg which did 
not open because personnel failed to arrive. IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler 
acknowledged the problems. ``It's an immensely complicated exercise,'' 
he said. ``We'll patch it up. We'll make it good before we're finished 
with it.'' Elections are likely to take place next May. No date has 
been set.
