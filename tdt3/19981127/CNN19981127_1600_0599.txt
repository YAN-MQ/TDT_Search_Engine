Many holiday shoppers will buy books for the people on their gift 
lists. And many of those will be books dealing with health and self 
improvement. Louise Schiavone reports. It's that time of year, when 
we're either grateful for good health or seeking it -- a quest which 
frequently leads to the book store and a confounding array of choices. 
Everybody has their own different way of doing it. It's which one 
do you pick? Last year, consumers in the United States bought about 
67 million books covering all aspects of health and fitness. Nutrition, 
everybody needs nutrition. I mean, it's just tons of books. I'm going 
to sit down here and go through a few that catches my eye and I'm 
going to pick one of these. The chasm between what is and what could 
be possesses this shopper. Maybe you see a little bit of yourself 
in her. Doctors say many of us do. When books offer quick and easy 
solutions, again that plays into really the psyche of so many overweight 
people who think, "well, if I just try this one last thing, this will 
work for me." Health books don't stop at diet and nutrition, and become 
a much more serious proposition when life-threatening ailments like 
heart disease and cancer are involved. The old saying goes, you know, 
"you can't judge a book by the cover." So, other things being equal, 
I think the best thing that you can do is just to look at the credentials 
of the author. This cancer specialist has joined the fray with his 
own book and, like other doctors, suggests that consumers -- Oh, I'd 
go to my doctor -- absolutely. Books are good, but I don't think there's 
any substitute. But who knows? One day someone might actually determine, 
once and for all, how to be fat-free and disease-free. That person 
will need this book. Louise Schiavone, for CNN, Washington. If they 
can afford it.
