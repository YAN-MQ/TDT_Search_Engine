Iran said Friday that a group of Americans were attacked by Islamic 
militants last week were members of a business delegation exploring 
investment opportunities. The acknowledgement by Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi constituted the first official description 
of the 13 Americans, who left the country a day after the attack Saturday. 
They were traveling in a bus in Tehran when radicals chanting ``Death 
to America'' and wielding iron bars hurled stones at the vehicle, 
smashing windows and injuring some of the occupants. Until now, Iranian 
officials had maintained that the Americans were tourists. The attack 
is believed to have been triggered by reports in hard-line newspapers 
accusing the visitors of being members of the Central Intelligence 
Agency posing as tourists. U.S. officials in Washington denied that 
any of the Americans were government officials or had links to the 
CIA. The Americans were allowed into Iran to increase pressure against 
U.S. sanctions that ban American companies from investing in Iran, 
the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Asefi as saying. 
Asefi said the Foreign Ministry initially denied the presence of the 
U.S. delegation because the visit had not been coordinated with it. 
He did not identify the businessmen further. The Fedayeen Islam, a 
radical Muslim group that was dormant for many years, claimed responsibility 
for the attack. The United States severed diplomatic ties with Iran 
after Islamic militants took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran shortly 
after the 1979 revolution.
