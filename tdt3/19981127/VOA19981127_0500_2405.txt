In Europe, the death rate of people with the HIV virus that causes 
AIDS has fallen at least 80 percent in just three years. Researchers 
said the European decline is the steepest reported so far. AIDS deaths 
are also decreasing in the United States and other developed countries. 
Scientists say new drugs and new treatment combinations are probably 
responsible for the decline. It also coincided with the introduction 
of drugs called protease inhibitors which can prolong the lives of 
patients with AIDS. Scientists say they did not know whether the downward 
trend will continue or if patients will eventually develop resistance 
to the new drugs. The results of the study are published in this weeks 
addition of the British medical journal, "The Lancet ".
