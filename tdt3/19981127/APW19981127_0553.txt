Swedish Defense Minister Bjoern von Sydov on Friday offered Poland 
a few options for using or leasing Sweden's Viggen and Gripen fighter 
planes to help Poland adjust to NATO standards. Sydov said Poland 
could lease the planes or only use them for training pilots in Sweden 
and Poland. He gave no cost of the offer, which also included training 
flight controllers, technicians and mechanics. Poland, one of three 
former Warsaw Pact countries scheduled to join NATO in April, needs 
Western planes to replace the Soviet-made MIG fighters it has been 
using. In addition to upgrading equipment and weapons, Poland is training 
its troops to meet NATO standards. Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz 
said using the Swedish planes for training carried no obligation to 
purchase the aircraft. He said the training would allow Polish pilots 
to get acquainted with NATO flight procedures.
