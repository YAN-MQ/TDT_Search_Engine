Jack Straw, the Cabinet member who will decide whether former Chilean 
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet must face extradition proceedings, 
is known as a rigorous defender of the law. Just ask his son. When 
a newspaper in January claimed that William Straw, then 17, had sold 
marijuana to a reporter, his father marched him to the nearest police 
station. The boy received an official warning. Straw's aplomb will 
be sorely tested as he faces the most difficult decision of his political 
career. He has until Dec. 11 to decide whether Spanish magistrates 
will be allowed to seek Pinochet's extradition on charges of genocide, 
terrorism and torture during his 17-year rule in Chile. Pinochet was 
arrested Oct. 16 while staying in a London hospital. If Straw blocks 
extradition hearings, it's likely to damage his popularity amongst 
the Labor Party's rank-and-file leftists. If he permits it to go ahead, 
he will face criticism for damaging Britain's trade and political 
ties with Chile. British law gives Straw some leeway to consider compassionate 
issues _ in Pinochet's case, whether he is now too frail to stand 
trial. Earlier this year, Straw decided to free Roisin McAliskey, 
a Northern Ireland woman who was wanted in Germany in connection with 
an IRA bombing. Her supporters had said McAliskey's physical and mental 
health had declined while she was in prison _ where she gave birth 
to a daughter. Straw, a 52-year-old barrister, became Home Secretary 
in Labor's 1997 national election victory. With a strong line on law 
and order, he was a key figure in promoting ``new Labor'' as a safe, 
middle-of-the-road party. And in office, he has championed curfews 
for unruly youngsters and laws clamping down on football hooligans. 
Straw was born into a what he has called an ``economically working 
class, culturally middle class'' home in Essex, a county east of London. 
His father was a nonconformist conscientious objector, his mother 
a teacher. He cultivated the nickname Jack at school after one of 
the leaders of England's 1381 peasants' revolt. Straw reached national 
prominence when he became the first left-wing president of the National 
Union of Students in 1969, riding the wave of anti-Vietnam protests 
of the 1960s which saw the organization move sharply to the left. 
After university Straw became a lawyer by profession, but worked for 
only two years as an attorney before immersing himself full-time in 
politics. He won his Parliamentary seat representing the northwest 
city of Blackburn in 1979, an otherwise disastrous election for Labor 
and the beginning of 18 years of Conservative government. In his early 
career, Straw has spent much of his energy fighting against the far 
left. As a student leader he campaigned against the Communist Party, 
and while in parliament in the early 1980 he helped Labor defeat extreme 
left-wing factions then infiltrating the party.
