The leader of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo said Friday that talks on 
the province might start soon, as top international envoys pressed 
ahead with Western diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis. Christopher 
Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the U.S. and European envoys for Kosovo, 
planned to meet in the capital Pristina to discuss the international 
initiative in Kosovo and meet foreign observers based in the province. 
Hill has been trying to hammer out a peace deal acceptable to both 
Serbs and Albanians, but so far his ideas have been rejected by Serbia 
and only cautiously supported by ethnic Albanian politicians. The 
two sides' positions over Kosovo are still far apart. Serbia wants 
to keep the province, which it considers the cradle of its statehood, 
firmly under its control. The majority ethnic Albanians want independence. 
But Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of the Albanians' independence movement, 
said at a news conference in Pristina, that ``we are not far from 
political negotiations.'' Rugova's comments indicate that there has 
been some progress in U.S.-led efforts to bring the two sides closer 
together. There are fears that Kosovo will explode in fresh fighting 
by spring if those efforts fail. Rugova said talks ``should be well-prepared.'' 
He dismissed attempts by Serbia to organize talks without international 
involvement as ``a well-known show.'' Rugova said Hill supported his 
stand. Serbian officials earlier this week tried to push forward their 
own peace plan which envisages Kosovo remaining in Serbia with a form 
of self-rule. Hill has discussed his plan with ethnic Albanian rebels, 
whose support is crucial. Ethnic Albanian sources have said that Kosovo 
Liberation Army representatives would present Hill soon with their 
written remarks on the draft. Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs 
launched a crackdown last February to crush an armed rebellion by 
separatist rebels. The clashes left some 300,000 people homeless and 
claimed the lives of hundreds of others. A shaky truce mediated by 
U.S. envoys last month is generally holding, but sporadic violence 
continues. Petritsch, who is Austria's ambassador to Yugoslavia, on 
Thursday visited a suspected mass grave site in central Kosovo, accompanied 
by the leader of an EU team of forensic experts that intends to examine 
six such sites around the province.
