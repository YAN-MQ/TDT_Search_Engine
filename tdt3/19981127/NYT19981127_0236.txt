You can call him director, writer, actor, filmmaker, photographer, 
professor or doctor. But call Jonathan Miller polymath or Renaissance 
man and he will gag. Ask him for the common thread running through 
his varied interests, and he will reply that if he knew, he would 
be in desperate trouble. Miller is directing the Metropolitan Opera's 
current production of Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro.'' He paused during 
a recent rehearsal to assess New York City's opera fans and opera 
critics: The fans are ``obsessed with celebrity.'' They ``like to 
applaud Pavarotti.'' The critics are provincial pedants. But in mid-rant, 
Miller could not resist calling on Darwin, one of his many intellectual 
heroes, for backup. ``I'm an evolutionist,'' he said. Despite what 
fans and critics believe, there is no one, true version of an opera. 
Every opera evolves. ``And it's not evolving toward a terminus; it's 
just that at a certain point you frame the thing.'' That's the performance. 
(This is not to say that one framing is as good as another. Witness 
Miller's disgust over Cecilia Bartoli's insistence on singing two 
alternative showy arias during a few taped performances of ``Figaro.'') 
If you were to frame Miller now, you would see a 64-year-old, 6-foot-3-inch, 
gray-haired, frisky, irascible Englishman. In addition to directing 
``Figaro,'' he is the curator of an exhibition titled ``On Reflection'' 
at the National Gallery in London, the author of a book of the same 
title and a photographer of what he calls ``neglected things'': torn 
posters, garbage, castoffs. In December he will direct a reading of 
Robert Lowell's poem ``Benito Cereno'' at the 92nd Street Y. And these 
are just his recent doings. Jonathan Wolfe Miller, the son of Emmanuel, 
a psychiatrist, and Betty Bergson, a writer, was going to be just 
one thing, a doctor. But in 1960, after studying natural science and 
linguistic philosophy at Cambridge and getting his medical degree, 
he was knocked off course by comedy. He calls it his ``fall from grace.'' 
He teamed up with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett in ``Beyond 
the Fringe,'' a satiric review that started a comedic revolution. 
When the show went from Edinburgh to London to Broadway, the unsolicited 
invitations poured in _ to direct, to write, to narrate, to produce. 
And Miller was unable to resist any of them, much to his regret. (He 
thinks he could have been a great neurologist.) In 1965, he became 
the editor of a BBC arts program. He made films of Plato's ``Symposium'' 
and Lewis Carroll's ``Alice in Wonderland.'' He went back to medicine 
briefly in the early 1970s as a research fellow at University College, 
London, but soon returned to the theater. In 1973, he began directing 
opera, even though he does not read music. In 1978, he wrote and narrated 
``The Body in Question,'' a medical series for PBS, then directed 
a Shakespeare series for the BBC. He was the artistic director of 
the Old Vic Theater in London in the late 1980s, then a research fellow 
in neuropsychology at the University of Sussex. Oh yes, and in his 
spare time, he wrote books: ``Darwin for Beginners,'' ``Subsequent 
Performances'' and biographies of Freud and Marshall McLuhan. Miller 
applies everything he knows to everything he does. His book and show 
``On Reflection'' is a mix of cognitive science, perceptual theory 
and art history. For the opera at hand, he consults Noam Chomsky's 
linguistics for dramatic coaching, Erving Goffman's sociological theories 
for plotting, Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin's paintings for staging 
and neuropsychology for comic technique. At a recent rehearsal Miller 
was in a curatorial state of mind, busy describing his ``Figaro'' 
as a series of frames. He beamed at the set, a simple white room with 
shelves full of tools for wig-making, boot-cleaning, cooking, washing. 
``I like the details of domestic reality _ I pored over pictures for 
days,'' and read Fernand Braudel, the French historian of everyday 
life, he said. And this, he declared, is what life looked like in 
18th-century France just before the revolution. ``When did people 
work? And how often? What was it like getting up in the morning? How 
often did they bathe?'' Miller stopped once more to admire the set. 
``Isn't that great looking? It's a real house!'' During the first 
act Miller pointed out a clever allusion in his staging: Figaro's 
Susanna, played by Ms. Bartoli, was about to strike a pose straight 
out of a painting by Chardin. Bartoli leaned on a table. Then she 
approached a copper cistern to get a drink. Miller was bursting. ``Here's 
the Chardin moment,'' he said. ``Chardin has what I want. The details 
of 18th-century life. ``It is the small details, the most imperceptible 
things that matter most,'' he continued. Then he paraphrased one of 
his favorite philosophers, J.L. Austin: ``We don't want to talk about 
the good and the beautiful. We must consider first the dainty and 
the dumpy.'' Soon, he promised, there would be another quotation from 
art history onstage: Susanna would look like the Virgin Mary fainting 
at the foot of the cross with St. John the Evangelist holding her 
up and Mary Magdalene looking on. He explained that countless 15th-century 
Flemish paintings had this arrangement of bodies. ``But wait till 
she faints,'' he commands. ``I like a vast plenitude of microscopic 
comic detail,'' Miller said approvingly. ``When you get that right, 
opera looks right.'' James Levine, the artistic director of the Met, 
chimed in: ``He does great detail work. He suits it to the specifics. 
One Miller opera doesn't look like another.'' But how does Miller 
square his desire to catch the details of 18th-century life with his 
efforts to get Susanna to faint like a 15th-century Virgin? To explain, 
he cited Erving Goffman, a sociologist who analyzed human behavior 
as play-acting. People are constantly imitating things they have seen 
before. For example, the hysterics in 19th-century France treated 
by Jean-Martin Charcot, Miller said, conformed their hysteria to the 
standards of theater. So isn't it possible that Susanna would have 
``deliberately fainted based on what she had seen in paintings''? 
``In the arts,'' he said, ``people are constantly looting the rubbish 
heaps of history. The more educated you are, the more you get.'' During 
a break someone walked by Miller's seat, coughed theatrically and 
dropped something at his feet. It was a bag of caramel apple pops, 
which he sucked throughout the rehearsal. As the next act began, Miller 
was tickled that the second Levine said ``Shhh!'' the theater went 
quiet. ``Look at the speed with which everyone shut up.'' The set 
was the Countess' sunny white room. Outside, you could see a woman 
sweeping. ``There's always a world outside,'' said Miller. Opera, 
Miller suggested, can be seen as a series of frames. First there are 
the frames within the plot. In Figaro, Susanna is between two frames, 
betrothal and marriage. ``The Count hopes he can exert the right of 
the feudal baron to have access to her on her wedding night.'' He 
wants to catch her between frames. Then there is the fictional frame 
around every piece of theater. Renee Fleming and Bryn Terfel are singing. 
That's a fact. But from the audience's point of view, it is the Countess 
and Figaro and they are talking, not singing. That's the fictional 
frame, and everyone understands the difference. For example, he said, 
if Othello throttles Desdemona in the play, that's fine; if the actor 
throttles the actress in actuality, he has clearly made ``a category 
mistake.'' Miller kept taking different seats in the theater, slouching 
and smiling. He watched as the Countess tied a blindfold around the 
eyes of Cherubino, played by Susanne Mentzer, then he identified the 
reference: Titian's painting ``Venus Blinding Cupid.'' He watched 
Susanna and the Countess do a late-20th-century high-five when they 
deceived the Count. He walked up to the stage to scrutinize the drunk 
gardener, Antonio. ``He's got it!'' Miller crowed: ``That thing that 
drunks do _ intensely, seriously addressing an audience that is not 
in front of him.'' Miller ticked off the three traits of a drunk: 
``You walk like you're on a cross-channel steamer and attribute your 
movement to the steamer rather than to yourself.'' He demonstrated 
in the aisle. ``You have an inability to distinguish the animate from 
the inanimate,'' he said, touching the chair and the reporter with 
equal pressure, ``and you talk to the knot of the other person's tie.'' 
There was no tie to talk to. ``I have a passion for minute behaviors. 
There is a whole fluster of stuff, subintentional behavior, which 
lies between the things people claim as their own (like bringing a 
glass to their lips) and the things they don't (like gastrointestinal 
movements).'' For example, he said, ``I move my tongue around the 
bottom of my mouth.'' And Rachel, he said, pointing toward his wife 
of 42 years, who was a doctor herself, ``twists her ear lobe when 
she's talking.'' He patted her head affectionately. ``Half of the 
job of a director is reminding people of things they've known all 
along and getting them to forget the things they should never have 
known _ namely operatic kitsch,'' he said. ``Too many opera directors 
are like puppet masters.'' They try to govern the actors' every move. 
He referred to Noam Chomsky's generative grammar for help. ``A child 
has the innate ability to detect which sounds are linguistic.'' It's 
the same with acting. ``I give some suggestions, but it should be 
filled with spontaneity.'' During the third act, Miller watched from 
the sixth row, mimicking Susanna's hand gestures and trying, as if 
he were a puppeteer after all, to make her move the way he wanted. 
And when the Count, played by Dwayne Croft, kneeled by Susanna's chair, 
Miller got down on his knees and whispered, ``Get your hand up there. 
Get your hand up there,'' meaning up her dress. At last, the Count 
complied. That taken care of, Miller glanced at the edge of the stage. 
He was watching a neglected servant eavesdropping outside the door, 
beyond the main action. ``I love the edges of things. I love frames, 
doorways, apertures,'' he said, finally pinpointing something that 
linked his off-center humor, his attraction to mirrors and reflections, 
his fascination with minute movements, and his interest in a minor 
character no one else was watching: ``There's no real center to life. 
It's all where you see it from.''
