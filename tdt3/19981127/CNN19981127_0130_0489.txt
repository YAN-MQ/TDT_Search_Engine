With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
Coming up for our big shopping day on Friday, temperatures very mild 
and quite pleasant across the central plains, the southern plains, 
the gulf coast and the southeastern U.S., 60s and 70s, where at this 
time of year in the central plains at least, 30s and 40s would be 
more common temperatures we would expect. 40s mostly along the Canadian 
border. In our forecast weather picture, continued mild through the 
central plains. High pressure dominates the eastern seaboard, but 
it looks like another round of wet weather for the pacific northwest 
and eventually into southern california. So get the shopping done 
early part of the day. If you are traveling into the midwestern United 
States, there is an approaching frontal system that will increase 
the likelihood of a little bit of moisture there. For Alaska, Hawaii 
and the Caribbean, look for 81 in Hilo, and about 20 in anchorage. 
Our extended forecast calls for the unsettled weather to continue 
for the west. On Sunday, a little bit more moisture through the Great 
Lakes. And finally, those temperatures become a little bit more chipped 
away in the central plains. Log on to CNN.com for more weather information.
