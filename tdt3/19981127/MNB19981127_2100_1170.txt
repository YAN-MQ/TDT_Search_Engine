We have a late update now from the pacific northwest on a developing 
story we told you about at the top of the broadcast. The scene is 
Seattle this Friday night after Thanksgiving. About 30 passengers 
on board a city bus when apparently a gun is fired. The driver lost 
control of the bus. The bus falls about 50 feet into an apartment 
building. Emergency crews arrive to find wounded. Much more is now 
known about this story. We go to NBC news Dan Lothian. Hello, Brian. 
The latest information is that a second man who also suffered gunshot 
wounds has died at the hospital. Another bizarre twist to this story. 
This happened after shortly after 3:00 pacific time. Investigators 
are still on the scene. Initially what they responded to as an accident 
has now turned in to a criminal investigation. A frantic scene as 
people tend to the injured. A routine evening commute on a city bus 
shattered after the driver was shot in the arm by a passenger, lost 
control, and crashed through a bridge railing. It looks like the driver 
has been pronounced dead by the Seattle fire department, and all of 
the passengers on the bus have been transported to a number of different 
hospitals. One of those passengers we believe is the person who shot 
the driver. The bus plunged off a bridge down 30 or 40 feet, smashing 
onto an apartment building and splitting in two. It was like the sky 
was falling. We were standing under the bus. Then we were running 
for our lives. We heard this banging. We looked up, and saw concrete 
flying everywhere: and I thought, I'm only 20 years old. I'm going 
to die. There was only one lady I did see who had her head leaning 
over on the very back of the bus who wasn't saying anything. The injured 
were rushed to several hospitals, some in critical condition. Fortunately, 
no one inside the apartment building was seriously injured. I just 
heard a big crash. I didn't have no clothes on. I ran back in because 
my door was open and there was glass in my apartment that had fallen. 
A weapon was recovered at the scene, but it has not yet been confirmed 
that handgun belonged to the suspect. No one knows why the suspect 
started firing. He's in his 40's. Investigators are trying to sort 
it all out. Two people dead, seven in critical condition, three in 
serious. A sad story. Dan Lothian, thank you.
