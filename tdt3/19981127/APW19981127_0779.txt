Police recovered a painting by abstract pioneer Piet Mondrian and 
arrested three people suspected of snatching it from a museum, officials 
said Friday. The oil painting titled ``The Tree'' was stolen from 
the Zeeuws Museum in this southwestern Dutch town on Sept. 25. It 
was found unharmed in a house in the Belgian city of Antwerp on Thursday, 
a day after police arrested two men and a woman suspected of the theft. 
The suspects, whose identities and nationalities were not released, 
are accused of stealing the painting and demanding a ransom for its 
return. They told detectives where to find the Mondrian following 
their arrest in the southern Dutch city of Heerlen. In a press release 
issued Friday, police did not say how much money the thieves had demanded 
or whether any cash had changed hands. The museum bought the painting 
in 1994 for 260,000 guilders (dlrs 138,300). The 27-by-38-centimeter 
(11-by-15 inch) painting, created by the Dutch master between 1908 
and 1909, shows a black apple tree against a dark blue background. 
The oil-on-paper attached to cloth was neither signed nor dated.
