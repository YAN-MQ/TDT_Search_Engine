Laser pointers have become an annoyance for some movie and concert 
audiences in the United States. That's right, they cast a small, powerful, 
distracting, and potentially dangerous beam of light. Recently a laser 
pointer disrupted a concert by the group Kiss - it's a rock group 
- and it happened in East Rutherford, New Jersey, not that it matters. 
But drummer Peter Chris nearly stormed off the stage in protest after 
someone temporarily blinded him with a laser pointer while he was 
singing a ballad. Chris then grabbed a microphone and cursed whoever 
had aimed the laser pointer at him. Then another member of the Kiss 
band, Paul Stanley joined in. He challenged who ever had the laser 
pointer in the audience to come up there on the stage and let's fight 
about it. No one volunteered.
