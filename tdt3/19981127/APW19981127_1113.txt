He was a gifted computer whiz _ one of the best, one who'd made the 
jump from illegal tinkering to the legitimate, potentially lucrative 
business of making codes crack-proof from hackers like himself. But 
when Boris Floriciz was found hanging from a tree in a Berlin park 
on Oct. 22, his belt around his neck and his feet dragging the ground, 
it drew attention even outside the tight-knit world of hackers. His 
friends wonder whether he was caught up in the murkier side of the 
trade _ one of spies, espionage and black-market criminals. Was it 
suicide, as police suspect? Or homicide? At 26, Floriciz seemed headed 
for a great future. He'd just finished his computer science degree. 
International firms sought him as a consultant. He was happy, say 
his friends, who cannot believe he would take his own life. Floriciz's 
friends wonder if he had become a threat to someone on the wrong side 
of the business, leading to his death. ``That was not a personal decision,'' 
Andy Mueller-Maguhn, a friend and fellow member of the Chaos Computer 
Club said. ``For sure not. That was murder.'' From childhood, Floriciz 
looked destined to be an engineer. He was always taking things apart 
to see how they worked. ``Radios, television, clocks, the lawn mower 
_ nothing was safe from him,'' his father told Stern magazine. He 
disassembled a telephone booth to get at computer data inside. He 
was the first hacker to crack the microchips on Deutsche Telekom telephone 
cards, used at pay phones in Germany. His homemade card reloaded as 
the credit ran out. After getting caught in 1995 and sentenced to 
probation, Floriciz ``felt the need to draw the line,'' said Mueller-Maguhn. 
He joined Chaos, a 10-year-old group of computer devotees, and he 
went back to college, earning his diploma in September by developing 
a scrambler to encode telephone calls on high-speed, digital lines. 
German media reports say Floriciz also was working on cracking decoders 
for pay television _ a booming business spreading across Europe. One 
of the key players is Robert Murdoch, whose digital broadcasting research 
firm NDS Ltd. contacted Floriciz two years ago about being a code-design 
consultant. ``He was an exceptionally talented engineer,'' said Margot 
Field, spokeswoman at the firm's London headquarters. NDS wanted to 
hire him but couldn't move forward because Floriciz hadn't yet graduated 
or completed his compulsory military service. The firm's last contact 
with him was in June. NDS apparently wasn't the only one interested 
in Floriciz. His father says Floriciz talked several times about being 
approached by people he suspected worked for spy agencies, which are 
believed to have mined the hacker world for talent in the past. Just 
a few months ago, Germany's spy agency tried to hire a hacker to get 
secrets out of Iran's military computers, the Chaos club said. But 
the contact vanished when the hacker got Chaos involved. Floriciz 
may also have attracted black marketeers of counterfeit chips for 
telephone cards and mobile phones. Deutsche Telekom estimates it loses 
millions of dollars each year from counterfeit cards. And industry 
officials worry that TV decoder chips offer gangsters even bigger 
profits on the black market. Money wasn't a lure for Floriciz, his 
friends say. He preferred to post his research on the Internet for 
all to see _ and use. ``It was all the same to him if others raked 
in the bucks from what he developed,'' one friend, Daniel, told Stern. 
``The main thing for him was that he had proven what he was great 
at.'' Mueller-Maguhn says Floriciz's open attitude about his work 
might have threatened those who didn't want competitors horning in 
on their business. ``He had lots of jobs, but he didn't want to become 
a slave of one company,'' he said. ``Maybe that was a problem.'' Floriciz 
left his mother's apartment on Oct. 17 at about 2 p.m. She didn't 
think he'd be gone long, because he didn't take his laptop computer. 
He never came back. Calls to his mobile phone went unanswered. A passerby 
found his body five days later. His phone, keys, ID card and money 
were with him, evidence police say points to suicide. No sign of a 
struggle. Nothing stolen. No drugs. Detectives are waiting for test 
results _ fingerprint fragments or chemical traces _ before making 
a final determination. The Chaos Computer Club is putting together 
its own report, which it plans to release at its annual convention 
Dec. 27-29 in Berlin. Already, the death notice on the club's Web 
site states what Floriciz's friends believe happened: ``The circumstances 
under which he disappeared and his extraordinary capabilities lead 
us to the conclusion that he became a homicide victim.''
