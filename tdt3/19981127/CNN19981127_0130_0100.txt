With you, hello Detroit 77 Sunny skies and unseasonably warm temperatures 
greeted the tens of thousands of people who watched the annual Thanksgiving 
day parade in detroit. It was quite a different picture in New York 
City, where blustery weather caused some problems at the 72nd annual 
Macy's Thanksgiving day parade. Deborah feyerick has the story. For 
Maurice sendak's character "the wild thing," the parade was over before 
it began. Just as it was about to step into the parade, a sudden gust 
of wind forced macy's showcase balloon into a lamp post, puncturing 
a gash in the fierce-looking beast. Garfield and wild thing got hurt, 
so they couldn't come. Helium gushed from the 10-foot side wound, 
though its head suffered no apparent injuries. The balloon was balled 
up and removed from the scene, leaving behind some disappointed balloon 
handlers. We came down and an unexpected wind came up and we lost 
control and just got caught up. "the wild thing" was not the parade's 
first casualty. Garfield was pumped-up, ready to go, 61-feet long. 
But he ended up missing the parade because of what balloon handlers 
described as a leak. And another favorite who never made it -- Spiderman's 
not in the parade anymore. Spiderman, wounded in action last year, 
was an unexpected no-show this year. One balloon is down, but of natural 
causes. And that's spiderman who had a bladder problem. And though 
Dexter finished the parade, his jet pack did not. Last year's walking 
wounded included the pink panther and the cat in the hat, which crashed 
into a lamppost, seriously injuring a woman. Other balloon mishaps 
in years past involved kermit the frog, sonic the hedgehog and Betty 
boop. This year, parade organizers hope to avoid all that, taking 
extra precautions with wind monitors to gauge the flying conditions 
and keep the balloons low away from trees and lampposts. So did the 
absence of some of these popular characters affect the parade viewers 
sense of wonder? I would have liked to see garfield. Spiderman. I 
can't believe garfield deflated. That's all right, it's okay. We got 
to see some of them, right? I got to see Santa. And that usually means 
presents are just a few weeks away. Deborah feyerick, for CNN, New 
York.
