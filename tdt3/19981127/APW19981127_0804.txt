Greece and Cyprus refused Friday to rule out the possibility that 
missiles destined for the divided island may instead be sent to Greece. 
But Greece's premier said it was the Cypriots' ultimate decision on 
whether the Russian-made S-300 missiles will be sent to the Greek 
island of Crete. ``There is one principle: Cyprus decides,'' Costas 
Simitis said after meeting Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides. ``In 
this case and any other case, the Cyprus government will decide and 
there will be consultations with Greece beforehand.'' Cyprus may be 
seeking a way around its pledge to deploy the surface-to-air missiles 
and avoid a direct confrontation with Turkey, which has suggested 
it could strike back with its powerful military. Greece, which has 
a defense pledge with Cyprus, could be drawn into a conflict. Tension 
on Cyprus also could harm its bid for European Union membership. Some 
EU nations have strong reservations about bringing the Cyprus dispute 
into their fold. U.S. special Cyprus envoy Richard Holbrooke is to 
visit Cyprus, Greece and Turkey next week to discuss efforts to restart 
talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot. According to officials in 
Athens, speaking on condition of anonymity, Greece has discussed the 
possibility of a Crete deployment with the United States. Cyprus has 
been divided since Turkish forces invaded its northern third to protect 
the Turkish minority following a short-lived coup by supporters of 
union with Greece in 1974. Turkey maintains about 30,000 troops in 
a northern break-away state, which is only recognized by Ankara. Greece 
has built a military air base on Cyprus. Clerides, who was elected 
promising to bring the missiles to the island, has avoided saying 
anything about the missiles. Purchased earlier this year, he has twice 
postponed their deployment. ``As far as the defense of Cyprus is concerned, 
both countries have supported and expressed the view that Greece and 
Cyprus have no interest in creating tensions. Turkey has an interest 
in creating tensions,'' Simitis said. But it was a decision by the 
Greek Cypriots to play a game of high-stakes brinkmanship with the 
missiles that backfired when Turkey called their bluff. Turkey just 
last week warned Greece that war will break out if the missiles are 
deployed on the island. ``Our effort is the peaceful solution. Naturally, 
if Turkey carries out any threats there can be no doubt that we are 
ready and will defend ourselves,'' Clerides said in his only statement 
after the meeting.
