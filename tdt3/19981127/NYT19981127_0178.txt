Last year, when Greta Carl, a 55-year-old lawyer in Chicago, was told 
by her doctor that she was nearly 100 percent clean from her bout 
with ovarian cancer, she grew her hair to her shoulders for the first 
time in her life, and dyed her gray hair Goldilocks blond. ``I love 
it,'' she said. ``It's flattering. It's sexier. It's a way of shouting, 
`Hey, I'm alive!''' For Ms. Carl, releasing her inner blonde was an 
act of fearlessness. ``I've always been the kind of person who wouldn't 
want to be noticed,'' she said. Chemotherapy had left her bald. ``I 
had a bloated, fat face, no eyebrows and eyelashes, and people would 
not recognize me,'' she recalled. ``So, I bought my Shirley MacLaine 
wig, short and red. That way I had an excuse for how my appearance 
had changed.'' When she got better, the hair grew back. Having tried 
red, she had the courage to go blond. Men notice her more now than 
in her gray days; her boyfriend, she said, ``loves to see me playing 
with my hair in the mirror.'' She added, ``Confronting a life-threatening 
illness forces you to use parts of your spirit and your brain that 
you've never used before.'' Cancer survivors often go through radical 
life changes. They switch jobs, spouses and friends. And for many 
women, radical changes in their appearance _ a new hair color, figure 
or wardrobe _ can also mark the transition. After radiation, chemotherapy 
or surgery, beauty makeovers are often a form of therapy. ``Vanity 
becomes a statement of survival, of living one's life in the moment,'' 
said Michael States, the clinical program director at the Santa Monica, 
Calif., chapter of the Wellness Community, a national support group 
for cancer patients and their families. ``It's regaining control.'' 
Dr. Eugene Thiessen, an oncologist who in 1976 founded Share: Self-Help 
for Women With Breast or Ovarian Cancer, an organization in Manhattan, 
said he found that women who survive cancer often have a new sense 
of urgency to look their best. ``Women come to grips with the fact 
they are living one day at a time,'' he said. ``And they don't put 
off doing things that might enhance them _ a makeover, hair, makeup, 
clothing. Whatever they feel is necessary.'' That was certainly true 
for Peri Wolfman, an owner of the Wolfman-Gold and Good Company home-furnishings 
store in SoHo. Ten years ago, she had double mastectomies (and breast 
reconstruction), about the same time that her youngest son left home 
for college. Her hair, rapidly turning white, was cut short and severe. 
She wanted to remake her image from head to toe. Before her illness, 
Ms. Wolfman had exercised only occasionally. ``I hate flab,'' she 
said, ``and I wanted to make myself toned.'' She started going to 
the gym and, with a personal trainer, lost 10 pounds. She let her 
hair grow so that it tumbled in wavy tendrils. ``It's tousled, messier 
hair,'' said Ms. Wolfman, who also dyed it with black streaks, inspired 
by her new black-and-white Tibetan terrier puppies. Just as Ms. Wolfman 
got in touch with a softer (although trimmer) side, Ann Fonfa went 
in the opposite direction. After breast cancer, Ms. Fonfa, the outreach 
coordinator at Share, forged a look to match a tougher new self-image. 
Every inch of her _ short hair, bare tank top, tattoos _ tells the 
story. For Ms. Fonfa, 50, fashion is a form of autobiography. The 
tank top doesn't hide her two mastectomies. (Her size 34D breasts 
are gone.) Before she got sick, she had shielded her chest demurely 
in tailored suits and blouses buttoned to her throat. She had long, 
full, wavy hair. After chemotherapy, she kept her hair in a crew cut, 
giving her the look of a middle-aged punk rocker. The effect is that 
of a militant survivor. ``I didn't feel comfortable being around women 
with no hair, if I had a full head of hair,'' said Ms. Fonfa, who 
on her left arm wears a black elastic pressure sleeve, used by cancer 
patients to prevent swelling after their lymph nodes have been removed. 
A tattoo of a coral snake slithers down her shoulder. Beneath the 
scar on her right breast, she has five more tattoos _ of a gold ring 
and four pink rings _ emblems of each cancer-free year. ``A lot of 
survivors have tattoos,'' Ms. Fonfa said, ``because they tattoo you 
when they radiate you. They're measuring where the radiation will 
be. I wanted to reclaim that.'' At first, Ms. Fonfa's look was an 
act of defiance, a way of expressing her outrage about what she saw 
as a ``mutilated body.'' But her outlook changed one day last March 
when she was walking down University Place, on her way back from the 
Union Square Greenmarket. ``I was wearing a leather jacket, a white 
spandex tank top,'' she recalled, ``and a gay guy came by and said, 
`Great bod!' _ and that did it.'' She began to like her new look. 
Kathy Rich, a senior editor at Allure magazine in Manhattan, had a 
bone marrow transplant to treat her breast cancer. Afterward she went 
to spas to ``thank my body for taking me through all that,'' she said. 
She went on a shopping spree for celebratory clothes. ``I'd been wearing 
really baggy clothes, loose overblouses and leggings,'' said Ms. Rich, 
who is at work on a memoir, which includes her battle with cancer, 
to be published next year by Crown. ``After the transplant, I started 
wearing more tailored and tighter-fitting clothes _ body-hugging sweaters, 
shorter skirts,'' she said. ``There's a sense when you go through 
this that you're so sexless, and in every way, cancer takes away your 
gender.'' But the new look was short-lived. ``I've returned to my 
original style,'' she said. ``There's a reason your original style 
is your style. It's because it looks good on you.'' Some makeovers 
are health-related, said Dr. Deborah Axelrod, a surgical oncologist 
who specializes in breast cancer at Beth Israel Medical Center. ``You 
don't want to be heavy, because obesity plays some role in post-menopausal 
breast cancer,'' Dr. Axelrod said. She encourages her patients to 
practice yoga and to stretch and run, and she tells them, ``You're 
not a pariah, you're not an outcast.'' As for men, they seem to go 
in for far fewer post-cancer makeovers than women; men change things 
like unsatisfying jobs more readily than their looks. ``Women have 
a sense that style reflects their lives, but men don't have that,'' 
said Nick Ullett, 57, a survivor of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, an actor 
and an occasional commentator on National Public Radio's ``All Things 
Considered.'' He identified one external change that some men do make 
after cancer. ``Men who go through radiation or chemotherapy lose 
their hair, and go around with semishaven hair,'' he said. ``It's 
the remission crew cut.'' He sports one, himself. Whether by men or 
women, a makeover doesn't have to be an overhaul. For some cancer 
survivors, even the smallest change in a beauty ritual can be liberating. 
Joan Douglass, 70, of Marina Del Rey, Calif., said, ``I was a dedicated 
smoker'' _ one and a half to two packs a day since she was a teen-ager. 
In 1997, lung cancer was diagnosed. After her operation, her granddaughter 
suggested that she paint her fingernails blue. To celebrate the simple 
pleasure of being able to walk (slowly) and breathe (slowly), she 
lacquered her nails lavender to go with her favorite lavender clothes, 
as well as silver, pale green and navy blue. ``Who on earth had to 
decree that nail polish had to be pink or red?'' Ms. Douglass said. 
``It's a trivial thing, but it pleases me. It's pretty. It makes me 
happy to look at it, and I think people who have had cancer want to 
have fun.''
