For a long time, Keith Van Horn would not allow himself to think that 
the National Basketball Association season was in jeopardy. While 
the first seven weeks of what was to be his second NBA season were 
being canceled, the New Jersey Nets' rising star was steadfast in 
his belief that eventually the games would begin. But that was before 
Tuesday's feuding between the league's owners and players led to the 
cancellation of Friday's scheduled labor negotiations and the Christmas 
Day matchup between the Knicks and the Chicago Bulls. Because that 
game was to be the first televised on NBC this season, many observers 
and players viewed it as too lucrative for the league to jettison, 
especially with the possibility that Michael Jordan might play. Now 
even Van Horn, who as recently as Monday ``guaranteed'' that there 
would be a season, is beginning to waver. The assuredness he spoke 
with less than a week ago now sounds more like hope. ``I still think 
there's going to be a season,'' Van Horn said cautiously over the 
telephone Friday from Salt Lake City. ``But I'm not as optimistic 
as I was before all of this new stuff hit.'' With more than a third 
of the Nets' 82 regular-season games having been lost to the labor 
impasse, Van Horn's dwindling faith is well-warranted. The window 
for the league to settle its differences with the players and salvage 
the season is closing quickly. But while Van Horn said he ``gets sick'' 
when thinking about the nearly $1 million he has already lost in salary, 
he is far from cracking under the pressure from the owners. ``The 
sad thing is that the owners didn't want the season to start on time 
because they thought the players would fold after missing a few paychecks,'' 
he said. ``But that's not going to happen. The players have managed 
their money better than the owners thought.'' As a client of the power 
agent David Falk and as a staunch supporter of the players union, 
Van Horn has followed the labor developments closely enough to state 
that salaries of the league's coaches, presidents and general managers 
have increased 40 percent in the last two to three years, as well 
as put forth an eloquent argument on how the owners are attempting 
to make the players pay for their mismanagement. And as a decidedly 
pro-union player, Van Horn is willing to go the distance for what 
the players consider to be a good deal. Even so, in his eagerness 
to play, he refuses to think of that distance as the loss of the entire 
season. ``I haven't thought far ahead enough to think about not having 
a season,'' he said. Van Horn will not stop following negotiations 
when and if the lockout is settled. He will simply turn his attention 
to the free-agent market, where the Nets will deal with the center 
Jayson Williams, one of the league's most-coveted free agents. How 
well the Nets handle their situation with Williams, whose market value 
appears to be about $12 million a season, will go a long way in determining 
Van Horn's future with the team when he becomes a free agent in two 
years. ``I'm going to look closely at how they deal with Jayson _ 
what they offer him and how they go about the process of trying to 
re-sign him,'' Van Horn had said earlier in the week, before joining 
Williams in some bench pressing at a gym in Paramus, N.J. ``Because 
if they're unfair to him _ a person who's transformed himself into 
an All-Star, one of the most popular players ever to play in this 
metropolitan area _ if they treat him unfairly, how are they going 
to treat Kerry or myself?'' He was referring to the third-year guard 
Kerry Kittles. ``I'm not going to say, `If they don't take care of 
Jayson and Kerry I'm not going to be here,' because that's not the 
case,'' the 6-foot-10-inch player said. ``But I am going to look at 
it and judge how well they deal with them.'' While the business side 
of basketball consumes his mind, Van Horn continues to work hard on 
his game, hoping that he will soon get the chance to erase the memory 
of last season. Erase? After averaging 19.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and 
helping the rejuvenated Nets make the playoffs as a rookie, what's 
to erase? Plenty, according to Van Horn. His first NBA season was 
all right, he says, but this year he intends to be much better than 
the rookie who used a unique combination of flair, finesse and fundamentals 
to steal some of the Knicks' thunder in the metropolitan area. ``I 
understand the game a lot better now than I did a year ago,'' said 
Van Horn, sporting a new beard and goatee that gives him a more menacing 
look. ``I know how I want to play now whereas last year, I hadn't 
found my niche yet. I'm definitely going to be a different, more effective 
player this year.'' Through film study and a keen sense of recall 
_ ``I can tell you what happened 16 minutes into our third game with 
the Knicks'' _ Van Horn has dissected his game, discovering that he 
hovered too much around the 3-point line, hoisting 25-foot jumpers, 
didn't fill the lanes on the fast break as much as he would have liked, 
and did not draw enough fouls. And he says his field-goal percentage 
(.426) was sickening. ``A funny thing happens once you step past 23 
feet,'' Van Horn, a 52 percent career shooter at the University of 
Utah, said with a laugh. ``It drove me nuts for a while.'' While his 
outside shooting ability is a plus, Van admits to taking it to the 
extreme last year. He launched 3.6 3-pointers a game (more than any 
other power forward in the league) and made just 30 percent of them. 
This year, he plans to shoot ``one, maybe two 3-pointers'' a game 
and rely more on drives to the basket and 17- to 20-footers. Van Horn 
has honed his perimeter skills by working extensively with Kittles, 
the Nets' 6-5 shooting guard. The two of them ran full-court games 
over the summer with college players at Fairleigh Dickinson, shot 
thousands of jump shots and concentrated on improving their ball handling. 
Van Horn said that one month they spent 30 minutes every day working 
solely on dribbling, especially on the cross-over move. He also said 
he had fully recovered from the sprained right ankle injury that kept 
him out of the first 17 games and hindered his mobility throughout 
last season. While the much quicker Kittles has helped Van Horn sharpen 
his finesse game, the burly Williams has helped him add 20 pounds 
of muscle to his once-thin frame. Van Horn, now a solid 250 pounds, 
lifts five days a week, including at least two days with Williams. 
The Nets center pushes him through two hours of weight work, then 
bangs with him in full-court games of one-on-one. ``I think he's about 
25 percent better than he was last year and that's going to be scary,'' 
Williams said. ``He's gotten a lot stronger, a lot quicker and a lot 
more aggressive. Last year, I could foul Keith and he'd be flying 
all over the place, but now he's going up strong and coming back at 
me.'' The question is, will he get the chance this season to come 
back at opponents in real, live NBA games.
