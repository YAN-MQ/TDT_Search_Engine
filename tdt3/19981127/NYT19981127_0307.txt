the television series ``Cagney and Lacey,'' died on Nov. 17 at St. 
John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 70 and lived in Los

``Room Service'' at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 
Washington and ``The Front Page'' at the Long Wharf Theater in New 
Haven, Conn. He was also a member of Arena Stage in Washington in 
the early 1950s. In addition to playing the father of Chris Cagney 
in the CBS series ``Cagney and Lacey,'' which starred Tyne Daly and 
Sharon Gless as undercover police officers in New York, O'Neill had 
recurring roles on ``Home Improvement,'' ``Family Matters'' and ``Cybill.'' 
He also appeared on ``MASH,'' ``Cheers'' and scores of other shows. 
O'Neill's films included ``The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,'' ``The 
Jerk'' and ``Prizzi's Honor.'' Born in New York, O'Neill attended
