Now to the reason why the U.S. hasn't put away those plans for a military 
strike against Iraq. The ongoing and intensifying fight over documents. 
The U.N. wants them. Iraq doesn't want to give them up. U.N. weapons 
inspectors say they know there are hidden documents on Iraq's entire 
program for weapons of mass destruction. Iraqi military commanders 
were told last week, this report goes, to destroy critical records 
of chemical and biological weapons stockpiles. Next week U.N. inspectors 
will begin a series of surprise inspections, unannounced.
