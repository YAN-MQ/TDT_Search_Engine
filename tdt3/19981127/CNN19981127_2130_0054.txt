"CNN Headline News." I'm Lori Geary, sitting in for Lynne Russell. 
The cache of material relating to President Clinton's impeachment 
inquiry now includes a report of 81 questions and answers but no revelations. 
Mr. Clinton is standing by his testimony before the federal grand 
jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter. He again admits misleading 
the public about his affair with Lewinsky. But he denies giving false 
or misleading answers under oath. Today, the White House sent his 
responses to the questions to Capitol Hill. One of the questions asked 
-- "do you admit or deny that you had knowledge that any facts or 
assertions contained in the affidavit executed by Monica lewinsky 
on January 7th, 1998, in the case of Jones versus Clinton, were not 
true? John king has the president's response. I stated in my deposition 
that it was true. In my August 17th grand jury testimony, I sought 
to explain the basis for that deposition answer. I believe at the 
time, that she filled out this affidavit, if she believed that the 
definition of sexual relationship was two people having intercourse, 
then this is accurate. House Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde 
says the committee will now carefully review the president's responses. 
Hyde sent the questions more than three weeks ago and threatened to 
subpoena the president if he didn't answer by Monday.
