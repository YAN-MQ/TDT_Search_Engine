``Curious George'' is a best-selling children's book series. Furious 
George is a struggling punk rock band. You wouldn't necessarily confuse 
the two. George in the books is a monkey. George in the band is a 
person. But then again, maybe you might. The ``Curious George'' books 
have bright yellow covers with red lettering and pictures of George 
the monkey. The Furious George albums are bright yellow with red lettering 
and also likenesses of George the monkey _ in leather and sunglasses. 
To the band, it's a parody. To Houghton Mifflin Co., publishers of 
``Curious George'' since 1941, it's trademark infringement. The civil 
contest is being waged before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 
Trial and Appeal Board in Washington. But it is also being discussed 
on the Internet and in the pages of New York Press, a free weekly 
newspaper, where George Tabb, the George of Furious George, writes 
about himself and popular culture. ``My name is George and I'm furious,'' 
said the 36-year-old Tabb, a guitarist and composer whose first full-length 
CD, called ``Furious George Gets a Record,'' depicts a George-like 
monkey in mug shot front and side views with a police arrest number. 
The monkey also adorned the band's three early vinyl releases, including 
one called ``Furious George Goes Ape!'' ``They say we can't sing songs 
like `Monkey in a Man Suit,' `Prozac Defense' and `I Gotta Gun' because 
it might confuse the little kids who like Curious George,'' Tabb wrote 
on a fan's Furious George web page. ``Everyone who is not blind knows 
the difference and everyone knows that if it came down to it, our 
monkey could kick that monkey's butt, any day.'' He said that went, 
too, for George's handler, the Man in the Yellow Hat, who in the book 
captures George in Africa to bring him back to a zoo and becomes his 
best friend. ``A dead man,'' warned Tabb, whose earlier punk rock 
bands include ``Roach Motel,'' ``False Prophets,'' ``Iron Prostate'' 
and ``The Gynecologists.'' He also plays a punk rocker in a forthcoming 
Spike Lee movie, ``Summer of Sam,'' in which he performs a song partly 
composed by the jailed murderer David Berkowitz, ``Hello From the 
Gutters of New York City.'' Houghton Mifflin's trademark lawyer, Mary 
Donovan, dismissed Tabb's cry of censorship as absurd. ``Obviously, 
nobody is trying to stop the man from performing,'' she said in an 
interview. Rather, she said in her filings for Houghton Mifflin, Tabb's 
use of the publisher's characters and design was ``a blatant theft'' 
going far beyond the purposes of parody and likely to confuse the 
public. Although trademark disputes are common, the outlaw ethos of 
punk rock, which cherishes provocation, all but insures that the cultural 
clash will not be limited to legalism. To the company, its winsome 
little troublemaker is an asset well worth protecting. Created in 
Paris more than 60 years ago by the husband and wife team of Margaret 
Rey and Hans Alfonso Rey, Germans who fled the Nazis, ``Curious George'' 
has since become a mini-industry, with six more titles by the Reys 
and 28 others by subsequent licensees. The books have sold more than 
20 million copies in 12 languages worldwide and have spawned a variety 
of licensed products, including CD-ROMS, compact disks, key chains 
and T-shirts, which brought in more than $5 million in sales last 
year alone. In addition, a new ``Curious George'' movie, directed 
by Ron Howard and blending animated characters and live actors, is 
scheduled for release next year, Ms. Donovan said. The dispute was 
set off by Tabb's filing of a trademark for his year-old band, Furious 
George, in early 1996. He had heard, he said, that other bands were 
using the name and he wanted to secure its exclusivity. ``Of course 
it's irony,'' he said. ``Punk rock is full of irony.'' But, he added, 
``I registered the name not the monkey.'' He also said he was not 
behind any sales or licensing of Furious George memorabilia. After 
the filing was routinely published in the trademark office's weekly 
gazette, Houghton Mifflin filed as an ``opposer'' to the application, 
seeking summary judgment to have Tabb's application rejected. Tabb, 
through his lawyer, Andrew Krents, filed in opposition to the opposer 
and the fight was on. A decision may come by the end of the year. 
Houghton Mifflin argued that the similarity of names invited confusion: 
``Both marks employ the word `George' and, with the exception of the 
first letter of the first word of both marks, the words `Curious' 
and `Furious' sound virtually the same. Indeed, the aural similarity 
is reinforced by the similar arrangement of the words.'' As Tabb translated 
it, ``They want to own the letter `F.''' He vowed to fight the case 
to the Supreme Court if necessary. ``This is a battle between two 
monkeys, for God's sake,'' he said.
