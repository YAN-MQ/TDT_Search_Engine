New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has taken a tough stance on crime, 
locking up more and more criminals. But you might wonder why the city 
is getting "cagey" with its fire trucks. Jeanne Moos "unlocks" the 
mystery. It's normal to see a caged bird -- or a caged ape, or a caged 
pig -- but what got us nosing around was the sight of caged fire trucks 
popping up in front of fire stations around New York City. They caught 
a fire engine. There are cages for one firetruck -- and cages for 
two. Okay, so New York's mayor has cracked down on crime, but is that 
any reason to imprison fire trucks? Why is it locked up? Was it uncivil? 
Is it on display? You tell me. Not quite yet. True, anything worth 
anything is locked down in New York, but this looks ridiculous. Instead 
of sliding down a pole and leaping onto a truck, firemen have to unlock 
the cage before they go anywhere. Ah, free at last. But when the run 
is over, it's back to the cage with a Sigh -- -- of resignation. This 
is the truck that bites. In a manner of speaking, the fire trucks 
are in the dog house -- not allowed to come inside. One by one, the 
city is renovating the floors of firehouses city-wide. When they were 
originally built, there were horses and steamers. They weren't designed 
to carry the weight of modern apparatus. So much for this guy's theory. 
My next guess was that it's a pet firetruck, like my kid's hamster. 
And while no one's mistaking a firetruck for a rabbit, firemen tell 
us passersby are confused. Sometimes they think it's for wrestling 
matches and stuff. World championship wrestling lowers a cage and 
lets guys go at it like beasts. Oh, planted him with a belly-to-belly. 
Look at him, he's getting out. Why, they even feature smoke. Now, 
that would make a caged firetruck feel at home. Think of it from the 
engine's point of view. Perhaps dreaming of escape -- not a fire escape, 
but escape to a real fire. The cage may be a necessary, temporary 
solution, but to the truck, it must feel like a firetrap. Jeanne Moos, 
CNN, New York.
