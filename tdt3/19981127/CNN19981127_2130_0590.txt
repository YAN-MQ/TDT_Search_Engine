Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is promising a thorough 
review of his country's military occupation of southern Lebanon. Pressure 
is growing in Israel for a withdrawal of troops after bomb attacks 
in the occupied zone have killed seven Israeli soldiers in the past 
11 days. Netanyahu will meet with his cabinet Sunday to discuss the 
issue. In April, the Israeli cabinet adopted a 1978 U.N. resolution 
that called for its troops to withdraw immediately from southern Lebanon, 
but said it would do so only with security guarantees from Lebanon.
