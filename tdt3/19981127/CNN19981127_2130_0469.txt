The federal government wants drugmakers to spell out the dosages for 
medications given to children. The food and drug administration set 
new guidelines today. They are intended to give doctors and other 
health care givers more information about drugs prescribed to children. 
The FDA also wants drugmakers to test drugs on children if they will 
be the primary users of the medications. Currently, drugs are tested 
mostly on adults.
