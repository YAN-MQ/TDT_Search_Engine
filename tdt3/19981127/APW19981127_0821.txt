The message to Olympic sports is clear: get tough on drugs or you're 
out. Soccer, cycling and tennis were warned Friday that they risk 
being dropped from the Olympics unless they comply with uniform anti-doping 
rules and sanctions. Those three sports expressed reservations to 
the package of anti-doping measures adopted at a meeting of the International 
Olympic Committee and 35 international sports federations. The agreement 
binds federations to abide by a unified medical code that includes 
a minimum two-year suspension for athletes using steroids or other 
major performance-enhancing drugs. Athletes caught a second time would 
be banned for life. On top of suspensions, federations can also impose 
fines or other financial penalties and require athletes to submit 
to unannounced followup testing. Previous IOC guidelines recommended 
a two-year ban as a maximum punishment. In some cases, different federations 
have applied different sanctions for the same offense. The IOC wants 
the 28 summer and seven winter federations to apply common rules, 
procedures and penalties. Olympic leaders were intent on getting all 
sports to fall in line before the Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping summit 
in Lausanne. All federations agreed, except for objections raised 
by the governing bodies of soccer (FIFA), tennis (ITF) and cycling 
(UCI). These were the same three sports which failed to comply fully 
with previous IOC attempts to harmonize doping policy. IOC president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch said he was confident the three dissenting 
federations would sign up to the agreement before the Febuary conference. 
``These three federations have reservations, but after consulting 
with their governing bodies, I'm sure they will agree,'' Samaranch 
said. Despite the warning that federations must comply or risk their 
Olympic status, Samaranch carefully avoided making any ultimatums. 
``I think all federations will remain on the Olympic program,'' he 
said. ``The policy of the IOC is not to threaten the federations.'' 
FIFA's acting general secretary, Michael Zen-Ruffinen, objected to 
the two-year sanction on grounds that the penalty might not stand 
up in court and because certain prohibited drugs have no performance-enhancing 
benefits in sports like soccer. ``We agree that there should be a 
common position,'' he said. ``But we want to make an exception in 
certain cases. We need to clarify things and find a compromise solution.'' 
Significantly, FIFA president Sepp Blatter skipped Friday's meeting, 
traveling to South Africa instead to receive an award from Nelson 
Mandela. ``It's getting to be ridiculous,'' softball federation president 
Don Porter said. ``They (FIFA chiefs) never come to these meetings. 
They're not part of the team.'' Samaranch said he planned to meet 
with Blatter on Jan. 6 to try to find an accord. The cycling federation, 
whose sport was damaged by revelations of systematic doping during 
the Tour de France, went along with the two-year sanction. But UCI 
president Hein Verbruggen said the penalty won't serve much use because 
it won't be accepted by the legal system. ``The rules have to be in 
line with what is acceptable to the courts,'' he said. ``If we go 
to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, they will never give two years.'' 
Soccer, tennis and cycling all objected when track and field chief 
Primo Nebiolo pushed through a last-minute rule specifying that sports 
which don't comply with the accord should be dropped from the Olympics. 
``That was as strong a message as they could have received,'' said 
John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee and a leading 
advocate for hardline doping policy. ``The ultimate sanction is participation 
in the Olympic Games.'' On another key issue, the federations expressed 
support for the establishment of an independent agency to coordinate 
anti-doping efforts around the world. IOC vice president Dick Pound, 
who heads the project, said the agency could be up and running early 
next year with initial funding of dlrs 25 million from Olympic television 
revenues. On other points, the federations: _ called for cooperation 
on doping issues between sports bodies and government authorities 
_ pledged to intensify doping prevention policies through educational 
and promotional campaigns _ agreed to refer doping disputes to the 
Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport once internal appeals 
procedures had been exhausted.
