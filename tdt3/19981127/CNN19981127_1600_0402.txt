Bnlt bnt is promising review of the country's policy and Lebanon. 
He cut short a European trip. The Shiite Muslim group, Hezbollah, 
is claiming responsibility. Netanyahu says he'll pull the troops only

We're there for a purpose, to protect the north of our country. If 
we find a way to protect the north of our country, and our allies 
in south Lebanon and reduce the presence in Lebanon, we'll consider 
that. But all these things will be considered in the cabinet meetings

itself, its people and soldiers. 20 Israeli soldiers have been killed 
in fighting in southern Lebanon.
