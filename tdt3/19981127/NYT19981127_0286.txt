Kristin Marting probably won't care for this analogy, but ``The Women 
of Orleans'' made me think of ``Ally McBeal.'' Ms. Marting's play, 
set in New Orleans in the first half of the 19th century, is far more 
elegant than the Fox television series about an anxiety-plagued Boston 
lawyer in short skirts, but both works take unorthodox approaches 
to conveying their characters' emotions physically. When Ally finds 
herself enamored, a big cartoonish heart appears and beats loudly 
outside her chest. When characters in ``The Women of Orleans'' feel 
a little off balance, they literally tip over. When one is trying 
to control another, the man brings out an actual chain and ties it 
around the woman's waist. One character, Micaela Pontalba (Gretchen 
Lee Krich), spends much of this odd but enchanting one-act play with 
her hands at her neck, demonstrating the sensation of being choked. 
The real Micaela, the future Baroness de Pontalba, had good reason 
to feel that way. Her marriage turned into nothing more than decades 
of legal battles over dowries and inheritance. Her father-in-law, 
here called Agricola Pontalba (Richard Toth), finally took matters 
into his own hands and shot her several times with his dueling pistols. 
But she was 40 and tough by then, and she survived. In the theatrical 
version, which Ms. Marting directed, choreographed and adapted (with 
Celise Kalke) from Kate Chopin's novel ``The Awakening'' and George 
Washington Cable's ``Grandissimes,'' as well as newspaper accounts 
and a biography of the baroness, this scandalous event takes place 
amid a swirl of love affairs, voodoo spells and racial-cultural conflict 
inside and outside the family. Some might consider ``The Women of 
Orleans'' a dance work rather than theater. At times the vocabulary 
of gestures does look like interpretive dance. But it's the combination 
of those gestures (which don't always involve the feet), the pronouncements 
that act as dialogue (``Fortunately, most of us do not love hard enough 
to be killed by it''; ``I have never known a Negro I hated'') and 
Matthew Pierce's haunting music, performed by a five-piece orchestra, 
that adds up to a memorable reverie. And there is not a weak link 
in the cast. ``The Women of Orleans'' continues through Dec. 20 at 
Here, whose theater is a little too small for this production. It's 
difficult to keep an eye on all eight characters at the same time. 
Certainly, the choreography can be appreciated one character at a 
time, but it's clear that there's an overall pattern onstage that 
needs to be appreciated from farther back than the third or fourth 
row. PRODUCTION NOTES: `THE WOMEN OF ORLEANS' Adapted by Kristin Marting
