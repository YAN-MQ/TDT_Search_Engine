That is "Nightly News" on this Friday after Thanksgiving. Don't forget 
"Dateline" NBC tonight at 10:00, 9:00 central time. I hope you'll 
join me tonight and each evening for the news on MSNBC on cable at 
9:00 and again on CNBC at 10:00. I'm Brian Williams, reporting tonight 
from New York. Good night.
