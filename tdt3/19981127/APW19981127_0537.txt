Shaun Pollock took two more wickets for only three more runs and South 
Africa bolwed out the West Indies for 261 before lunch Friday, the 
second day of their first test. Pollock, whose morning spill destroyed 
the top order of West Indies on Thursday, finished with five for 54 
to clean up the tailend as well, and South Africa replied with 53 
for one before the first break at Wanderers Stadium. Allan Donald 
took the remaining West Indies wicket and with Pollock dismissed the 
Caribbean tourists for only 12 more runs, as they tried to build on 
their overnight score of 249 for seven. The day had its high moment 
for the West Indians as well. Courtney Walsh equalled Malcolm Marshall's 
team record with his 376th test wicket, getting Adam Bacher caught 
behind for one. Bacher fell after South Africa had put up only 10, 
another disappointing opening partnership for the host. The last reasonable 
start to an innings for South Africa came in March this year, against 
Sri Lanka, when Gary Kirsten and Gerhardus Liebenberg put on 89. Kirsten 
was on 22 and Jacques Kallis 26 when the lunch break was called.
