Singapore on Friday denied a report it was involved in an initiative 
by the World Bank and United Nations to offer dlrs 1 billion in aid 
to Myanmar if its military regime begins talks with the opposition. 
A Singapore foreign ministry spokesman said that ``neither the World 
Bank nor the United Nations has approached Singapore regarding the 
proposal to offer development assistance to Myanmar.'' A report Thursday 
in the International Herald Tribune said Singapore would provide some 
of the funds for Myanmar, though the bulk of the money would come 
from Japan. Singapore is ``puzzled by reports that (it) is expected 
to contribute to funds that would be funneled to Myanmar through the 
World Bank,'' said the spokesman. The U.N.-World Bank initiative comes 
amid a deepening standoff between pro-democracy activists and the 
government. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled since 1962 
by the military.
