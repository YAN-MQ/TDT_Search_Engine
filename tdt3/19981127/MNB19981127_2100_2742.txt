Now, when we come back, we will have part two of our report, including 
where the rubber meets the road. Some revealing answers about how 
much money the foundation for abused children as actually raised. 
I don't want to buy a new PC every year till commencement. I needed 
one that would keep up with them. Got to save something for college. 
Call 1-800-gateway and we'll custom-build your kids a PC with an Intel 
processor and CD-rom now for only $999 or with the your:)ware program 
it's just $28 a month. And in two years you could trade it in toward 
the purchase of a new one. You guys make sneakers? Call us now and 
let's talk about your:)ware from gateway. There are certain things... 
your body is going through-- that the chemo is doing to you. I was 
tired. Very, very tired. One time, my grandchildren were all over, 
and they all went out and got ice cream. And they're all lined up 
on the Porch-- all with ice cream. They start from the age of three... 
all the way up to 18 years of age. What a photograph that had to be. 
I did not have the energy... to go upstairs to grab the camera. I 
missed the photograph-- to me, a once in a lifetime opportunity. Go 
out. Live your life. That's what I'm doing now.
