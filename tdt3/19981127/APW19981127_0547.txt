Galatasaray's Romanian strikers on Friday assured Juventus players 
of their safety during next week's Champions League match, while police 
prevented anti-Italian protests to ease down tensions. ``Don't be 
afraid, come Zidane,'' said two Romanian strikers of Galatasaray, 
Gheorghe Popescu and Gheorge Hagi, in a joint statement published 
by the daily sports newspaper, Fanatik. ``We are your guarantee.'' 
Zidane and several other Juventus players have refused to play the 
match in Turkey because of anti-Italian sentiment running high in 
Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah 
Ocalan. ``We won't go to Istanbul. It's too risky,'' Zidane said. 
``I speak only for myself, but all of my teammates think the same 
way. Galatasaray-Juventus should be played in a country other than 
Turkey.'' UEFA already has moved the game originally slated for Wednesday, 
to Dec. 2. Reportedly Juventus was still seeking a neutral venue but 
Turkish police seem determined to reduce the tension and blocked a 
group of demonstrators from reaching the Italian consulate on Thursday. 
On Friday, Turkey's sports ministry announced that Lennart Johansson, 
president of UEFA, assured Turkish officials that the game would be 
played in Istanbul next Wednesday. Police had tolerated violent protests 
over the past week around the country, where demonstrators set fire 
to a Fiat car, a motorbike and numerous Italian flags and silk, Italian-made 
ties. Sports minister Yucel Seckiner has also invited his Italian 
counterpart Giovanna Melandri to attend the match. It was not clear 
if she would accept the invitation. ``We will play at home,'' said 
Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim. ``But if this not happens, we will 
topple them anywhere.'' Galatasaray has charged that the UEFA decision 
favored the Italian team. Reports suggested that the decision by soccer's 
European governing body allowed injured Juventus players time to get 
back into shape. Galatasaray has seven points in Group B, one behind 
Norway's Rosenborg. Juventus has four, but both teams have played 
one fewer game than the Norwegians. Meantime Terim is expected to 
fly to Italy to watch Juventus, which has reached the European Champions 
Cup final three straight times and won once, against Bologna over 
the weekend. Galatasaray's league match against Besiktas on Sunday 
has been postponed by the soccer federation. Italy objects to Ocalan's 
extradition as he faces death penalty in Turkey for capital crimes. 
Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12, is the leader of the 
Kurdistan Workers Party which has been waging a guerrilla war for 
autonomy in Turkey's southeast for 14 years. The conflict has claimed 
nearly 37,000 lives.
