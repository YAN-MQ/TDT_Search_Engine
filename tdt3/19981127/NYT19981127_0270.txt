By midmorning Friday, Steven Tamasy had found the perfect Christmas 
gift. Of course, it was for himself. Tamasy, 32, a travel agent from 
Brookline, Mass., went in for the kill at Filene's Basement in Boston, 
an off-price store. His find was a velvet shirt-style jacket, listed 
originally at $500, marked down to $81. ``I suppose it's kind of like 
a hunter when he bags a deer,'' he said, reflecting on his prize. 
``I mean, I would have strapped that thing to the hood of my car if 
I could have.'' It was not so long ago that the day after Thanksgiving 
was when American shoppers raced to the stores to beat each other 
out of the most popular items, willingly paying full price and rarely 
expecting to unearth a bargain. But the 1990s have transformed the 
holiday shopping experience into one giant national hunt for deals, 
with retailers forced to court shoppers with promises of low prices 
rather than rare goods. What's behind the change? A tough economy 
in the early part of the decade impelled retailers to slash prices. 
From then on, consumers resisted any effort on the part of retailers 
to return to full-price, even in more prosperous years. Meanwhile, 
pretty much the same merchandise was readily available in a variety 
of stores across the country, forcing merchants to differentiate themselves 
with price tags. And do not forget the mood of plain old thriftiness 
that has become a badge of honor even among affluent shoppers who 
love to say they got their Donna Karan cashmere jacket at a sample 
sale for half price. The kick off to the 1998 holiday season was much 
the same last year, only more so, as dozens of chains opened their 
doors at the crack of the dawn, some as early as 5 a.m., offering 
heavily promoted early-bird specials. Shoppers formed lines outside 
discount stores, and retailers like Bloomingdale's used giant, red 
sale signs as their principal form of holiday decoration. While there 
will be some exceptions _ the apparently irresistible Furby dolls, 
for instance _ that will sell out early and at full price, plenty 
of merchandise could already be had for at least 10 percent off Friday. 
And many shoppers, spooked by the inexplicable movements of the stock 
market, said they would watch their pennies this year a little more 
carefully. ``I'm cautious about the economy,'' said Carol Cooper, 
61, who was shopping in Manhattan's Soho district Friday with her 
daughter, Sandy. ``It's a little too good to be true, I'm waiting 
for the other shoe to drop.'' In Santa Monica, Calif., Cherie Hankal, 
a 38-year-old assistant television director, sat sipping coffee Friday 
at the Third Street Promenade, a pedestrian mall. She had no plans 
to shop. ``I lost my job this year, so I'm not doing a lot of shopping,'' 
she said. ``I'm going to bake. That's the nice thing to do for people.'' 
But low prices could be the lure for others. Still, while all the 
sales come-ons _ some department stores even had them in their trim-a-tree 
departments _ might be great for shoppers, it can be risky business 
for retailers looking to turn a profit in the busy season. ``I'm worried 
about my companies,'' said Susan Silverstein, an analyst at Nationsbanc 
Montgomery Securities. ``In the last months, the level of ads and 
coupons has been pretty aggressive. It seems to be getting earlier 
and earlier.'' Black Friday, as the day after Thanksgiving has been 
known _ retailers have counted on the day to turn red ink into black 
for the year _ has become less popular in recent years. Although it 
is still a frenetic day, people tend to buy even more in the final 
few days leading up to Christmas and in the super-bargain days after. 
Last year, for instance, retailers had a mediocre holiday selling 
season, but ended the year on an upbeat note with sales made from 
Dec. 24 through the New Year. To entice shoppers to buy more now, 
merchants have combined price slashing with early hours, offering 
special deals for those who are willing to come out at dawn for sweaters 
and coffee makers. Stores from Best Buy to Zale jewelers to Macy's 
_ like Bloomingdale's a unit of Federated Department Stores _ offered 
lower prices for those willing to shop roughly between 7 a.m. and 
11 a.m. In Denver, the strategy appeared to pay off. By 7:30 a.m., 
there was a line of several hundred people outside a Best Buy store 
in Westminster, one of the city's western suburbs. ``To save $20 I 
waited in line for two hours,'' said Nancy McCarthy, 45, an insurance 
company employee. ``No sale is worth it or that good.'' By 5:30 a.m. 
at the Newport Mall in Jersey City, N.J., dozens of shoppers were 
outside the Kay-Bee Toy store, a unit of Consolidated Stores ``One 
guy lined up at 2 a.m.,'' said John Konarski, vice president of the 
International Council of Shopping Centers. ``Who does that?'' A Christmas 
theme for several years had been the Phoenix-like rise of the discount 
stores, once left for dead because of a reputation for tackiness but 
currently attracting shoppers from all walks of life. In Boise, Idaho, 
for instance, shoppers waited at 7 a.m. Friday for the doors to open 
at the Target store, a unit of Dayton Hudson. By 7:30 a.m., the parking 
lot was jammed. Lynn Jones, 41, of Boise woke up a 3 a.m., finished 
her job of delivering 300 newspapers and then picked up her friend, 
Shelly Draper, to hit the discount stores. They bought several Raggedy 
Ann dolls, Hot Wheels cars and children's clothes. They were the 700th 
and 701st people to arrive at the store, so they got their Hot Wheels 
cars free. Retail analysts and economists will probably keep a sharp 
eye on the luxury shops for insights into the well-being of the normally 
free-spending wealthy. In recent months, business has been a little 
shaky, with women's high-end clothes and men's expensive suits selling 
poorly. Wall Streeters, despite the big rebound in the market, appear 
cautious. ``I've survived so far, but this Christmas, I think I will 
take it easy,'' said Alex Ryshawuy, who works for an investment bank, 
as he looked over some ties at Barneys New York. ``I feel a little 
bit nervous. I'll still buy luxury items this year, just probably 
fewer, select items.'' And many shoppers around the country are thinking 
similar thoughts. ``This is the first year we've created a budget,'' 
said Beth Knight, 33, of Jacksonville, Fla. After her family's stock 
portfolio took a heavy blow this summer, she and her husband sold 
some stocks before they rebounded. ``We acted a little prematurely, 
we panicked,'' she said. ``Maybe next year will be better.'' Very 
few red-hot items stood out Friday, and it was too early to tell whether 
digital video disks _ DVD _ will bail out electronic retailers, who 
have been waiting in vain for another breakthrough product like the 
VCR. But as usual, at least one toy managed to create some hysteria 
and resentment among adults who were going crazy to get their hands 
on it. It was Furby, the doll manufactured by the Tiger Electronics 
unit of Hasbro.It speaks an imaginary language called ``Furbish.'' 
Karen Jenkins, a cashier who also lives in Jacksonville, said she 
arrived at a Wal-Mart Stores outlet at 6 a.m. because the store advertised 
a stock of Furby that would be sold on a first-come basis. She found 
70 people in line already, most of them holding tickets to purchase 
Furby. ``I was disgusted,'' she said, before trooping off to Target. 
In recent years, retailers have also been forced to compete for holiday 
spending dollars. Some of the diverted cash is easily traced. The 
travel industry is booming, for example, as many people choose to 
take trips rather than buy gifts. ``We're not really shopping,'' said 
Kurt Hotto, 41, a software designer from Denver even though he was 
sitting in the middle of a mall. ``We're taking the kids to Mexico, 
and it's a surprise.'' Other things are harder to trace, like $150 
a man might spend to give his wife an English gardening magazine, 
or the $500 tennis lessons a woman may chose to give her boyfriend 
rather than a new suit. Stephanie Gray, who was browsing Bloomingdale's 
in Manhattan on Friday, said she was giving her husband's car a spiffy 
detail job as one gift. She also said she liked to take her daughters 
for a ``spa day.'' ``We do more things like that than we used to,'' 
said Ms. Gray, 50. ``Sometimes it is neat to give things that are 
not from stores.'' But retailers profess not to be worried. ``Everybody 
is really up this year,'' said Konarski, the shopping centers' executive. 
``Our sales-for-the- year index is up 3.1 percent. In 1997, at this 
time, it was up only 0.9 percent. People just feel like they have 
more money. Inflation is flat, and job growth is strong. The fact 
that things aren't getting worse may be good enough.''
