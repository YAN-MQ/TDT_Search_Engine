Germany prefers a three-way merger of the European aerospace industry, 
including France and Britain, and will advise French officials during 
a summit next week, a source said Friday. However, the source said 
if Britain and Germany come to an agreement before France is ready, 
Germany would insist that the ``door be held open'' for French participation 
later. The big European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace, 
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March 
to seek a merger to compete with the Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Daimler-Benz 
Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advance talks on a two-way 
alliance. One stumbling block to Aerospatiale's early participation 
is that the aircraft maker is still partly government-owned and progress 
toward full privatization has been slow. Germany's assurance that 
the French can join in at a later date should bolster France's efforts 
to be included in the joint European industry. The two sides will 
discuss the issue at a German-French summit to be held Nov. 30 and 
Dec. 1 in Potsdam. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French President 
Jacques Chirac, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, as well as finance 
ministers and economics ministers will attend the summit. The French 
government earlier this year announced it would merge Aerospatiale 
with Matra Hautes Technologies and float a portion of the merged company 
on the stock market. That would bring the government's stake in the 
merged company to below 50 percent, although that figure could be 
reduced.
