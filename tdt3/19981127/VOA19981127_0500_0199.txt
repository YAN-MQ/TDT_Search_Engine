Former US President George Bush is on a private visit to the Middle 
East. In Cairo today, Mr. Bush said the United States must encourage 
the international community to stay together regarding Iraq. He says 
all countries must insist that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein keep 
his promise to cooperate with the United Nations. What worries me 
is the shattering of the coalition, and his ability to shift world 
opinion off his own brutality and what he's doing to the children. 
And shift it to make all of us feel guilty, that we are the ones that 
are doing it. Mr. Bush said President Saddam survived the aftermath 
of the 1991 Gulf War only by the brutality he is expressed over his 
own people.
