The agency responsible for managing the nation's stockpile of nuclear 
weapons told the Pentagon last summer that it had no year 2000 bugs 
in three of its most important computer systems, but auditors say 
those systems were never independently tested. The agency, the Defense 
Special Weapons Agency, defended its actions by saying in a letter 
dated Sept. 30 that it was not required to test the systems under 
Pentagon rules in force this summer when it made the report. The Pentagon 
inspector general's office, in an audit released on Oct. 30, reported 
that the agency had listed three computer systems in the category 
of ``mission-critical'' as ready for the year 2000 even without independent 
testing. The auditors said that unless the agency made further progress, 
it ``may be unable to execute its mission without undue disruptions.'' 
The audit was first reported Friday in USA Today. A malfunction of 
the computer systems would cause problems, Pentagon officials said, 
but the computers are not involved in controlling nuclear-weapons 
use. The Defense Special Weapons Agency, absorbed last month into 
the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, manages nuclear-weapons stockpiles 
and helps cope with nuclear-weapons accidents. The agency is also 
charged with maintaining the scientific expertise to ensure that advanced 
conventional systems, nuclear systems, and command and control systems 
will continue to operate if nuclear war is threatened or occurs, the 
auditors said. Jay Davis, the head of the Defense Threat Reduction 
Agency, said the Defense Department's initial plan for year 2000 issues 
``did not require testing'' and left the job to the people who ran 
the computers. The computer problem, known in shorthand as Y2K, involves 
computer systems that store the date as a two-digit number and might 
be unable to distinguish 2000 from 1900. Some of those systems, some 
computer experts warn, might stop working, stop communicating with 
other systems or deliver bad data when 1999 rolls over to 2000. The 
Pentagon set a deadline of this Dec. 31 to analyze, fix and test its 
computer systems, and will conduct large-scale tests involving multiple 
computer systems in the first quarter of 1999. Robert Lieberman, assistant 
inspector general of the Department of Defense, said in a telephone 
interview Friday that the Defense Special Weapons Agency was ``by 
no means alone'' in failing to bring in outsiders for an independent 
test, or to maintain adequate records of testing. Auditors have ordered 
several agencies to retest equipment under a revised policy that was 
issued as a draft last June but, with 13 months to go, is not yet 
adopted in final form. ``By waiting so long to really get into high 
gear, we have made this a much higher-risk proposition than it would 
have been had we really gotten serious two years earlier and approached 
this in a much more systematic fashion,'' Lieberman said. ``Right 
now it's difficult to say whether we have managed to make the problem 
unmanageable or not.'' ``A lot initially was left up to the discretion 
of whoever owned and understood each system,'' Lieberman said. ``It 
was felt that, given the sheer magnitude of systems, it was necessary 
to decentralize the whole operation, to give people a lot of latitude 
as to what they did. In retrospect, everybody agrees that that approach 
was a mistake.'' The programs needed for targeting and launching nuclear 
weapons, as well as other major operational systems, have been reviewed 
for year 2000 compliance already, military officials said. Lieberman 
said, ``I think that when push comes to shove, the military operators 
are probably the most capable group in the government for handling 
contingencies; they are used to doing without systems for whatever 
reason. Davis said finishing testing in the spring ``gives plenty 
of time for tests of the systems in full-up, integrated mode before 
the year clocks out.'' He said that the early certification, with 
which the auditors had found fault, included his agency's acceptance 
of assurances from software vendors about their products, rather than 
direct tests. He added, ``The principal failure is in documentation 
and planning, the particular details that the devil lies in.''
