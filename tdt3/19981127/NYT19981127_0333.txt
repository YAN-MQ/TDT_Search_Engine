On Tuesday, an advocacy group will march down Broadway to commemorate 
World AIDS Day, having successfully argued in court that the Giuliani 
administration showed more concern for a Yankees ticker-tape parade 
than about AIDS. In Co-op City, a middle-class housing development 
in the Bronx, residents will be invited to gather in prayer and song 
for the first time. The World AIDS Day organizer there, Crystal Dove-Paris, 
acknowledges it will be an uphill battle to ``lift the veil of silence'' 
about AIDS in her community of 55,000 residents. From the simple grass 
roots of a Co-op City courtyard to organized rallies in lower Manhattan 
and throughout the nation, Tuesday will be a time marked by silent 
vigils and solemn readings of the names of the dead. But now in its 
11th year, the global day of remembrance is taking on a renewed burst 
of activism, according to many advocates for people with AIDS. Advocates 
say the needs of people with HIV feel more pressing, even desperate, 
as public perception grows that the AIDS crisis is a thing of the 
past. ``There is an increasing frustration and a realization that 
people are going to have to take some matters into their own hands,'' 
said Catherine Hanssens, the director of the AIDS Project at Lambda 
Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York. ``AIDS has become the 
invisible elephant in the living room that people pretend does not 
exist.'' A number of factors have contributed to the increased activity, 
including a greater emphasis on reminding the public that people are 
still dying, even as powerful new drugs have improved the health of 
many others, advocates say. There also is a growing willingness to 
confront politicians and government officials who are viewed as hostile 
to people with AIDS, according to advocates. Charles E. King, co-executive 
director of Housing Works, whose group will march and hold a vigil 
outside city hall, said many more people want to participate in the 
World AIDS Day events than in the past. He believes anger has outweighed 
fear of recrimination from the Giuliani administration. ``We've had 
calls from dozens of organizations from around the city wanting to 
participate,'' King said. ``In the past, the march was Housing Works 
and Act Up, and now we have all these other groups saying we really 
want to be a part,'' he said. ``It's very clear that people want to 
make a statement to the mayor.''
