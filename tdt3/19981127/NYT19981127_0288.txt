On one level, Livent's filing for bankruptcy protection last week 
seemed to resolve many questions that had been swirling in the theater 
world about the financial condition of Broadway's public production 
company. But over the last few days, additional grim developments 
suggest how severe bankruptcy will be for the Canada-based company. 
Productions have been canceled in theaters Livent owns or manages 
in Toronto, and the Ford Center there has urged patrons to stop buying 
tickets because of concerns about refunds; the ``Showboat'' tour is 
expected to close on Dec. 6 in Providence, R.I., instead of continuing 
to New Orleans and Baltimore; the ``Ragtime'' tour hangs in the balance; 
creditors are wondering whether their bills will ever be paid. John 
Breglio, an entertainment lawyer who represents several artists and 
licensers who are owed money by Livent, said he had been besieged 
with calls from nonclients seeking advice. ``Never has this industry 
faced anything of this magnitude,'' Breglio said. ``There is no frame 
of reference for the people who deal in the theatrical industry. These 
are small businesses. They worked on trust with one another.'' Meanwhile, 
Livent is desperately trying to find long-term financing by the end 
of the month to cover the costs of reorganization. The company got 
a temporary reprieve on Nov. 19, one day after filing for bankruptcy 
protection, when some of the company's wealthy board members came 
to the rescue with a $5 million loan to cover operating expenses for 
10 days. Livent says that its outlook is optimistic and insists that 
its productions of ``Ragtime'' in New York and Chicago are not in 
jeopardy. Indeed, in New York it is playing to virtually full houses, 
and its grosses are second only to those of ``The Lion King.'' And 
Livent's new projects are so far proceeding as planned. They are ``Parade,'' 
which the company produced with Lincoln Center and which is in previews, 
and ``Fosse: A Celebration of Song and Dance,'' which is to open on 
Broadway in January. But judging from the events of this week, the 
ripple effect of its financial difficulties has continued. On Tuesday, 
performances at several of Livent's Toronto venues were canceled, 
including ``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk'' and ``Peter Pan'' 
at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, which Livent manages, 
and concerts of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis 
at the Pantages Theater, which the company owns. But the North York 
Performing Arts Center, the corporate arm that oversees the Ford Center, 
has reinstated 22 of 67 canceled concerts. In lieu of refunds, Livent 
is offering tickets to ``Phantom of the Opera'' in Toronto in exchange 
for tickets to canceled events. Pace Theatrical Group Inc., the nation's 
biggest tour organizer, has petitioned the bankruptcy court for the 
right to produce the Seattle engagement of ``Ragtime,'' which Livent 
canceled last week, taking over the costs and liabilities of the production. 
Pace had already been scheduled to present the Seattle engagement. 
Pace may also try to revive the Boston production of ``Ragtime,'' 
which it was scheduled to present as the final stop on Livent's tour 
after Seattle. In an affidavit filed in federal Bankruptcy Court on 
Monday in support of Pace's petition, Daniel Brambilla, Livent's executive 
vice president, said: ``In light of the critical timing issues, Pace 
has already undertaken significant expense by beginning to take over 
responsibility for the Seattle production of `Ragtime' (including, 
for example, paying moving expenses).'' According to Brambilla's affidavit, 
Livent's touring company of ``Ragtime'' was unprofitable in Washington 
and Denver and broke even in Minneapolis, where it was canceled last 
week. Livent ``could lose as much as nearly $1 million if it were 
to take `Ragtime' to its next scheduled stop in Seattle,'' Brambilla 
said in his court papers. ``The debtors are now facing a critical 
liquidity crisis which renders them unable to sustain the losses consequent 
to taking `Ragtime' to Seattle.'' Given that national road companies 
now account for two-thirds of attendance and grosses for Broadway 
shows, the plight of the ``Ragtime'' company points up the potential 
pitfalls of mounting multiple lavish productions. Because of elaborate 
scenery, large casts and long engagements, the expense of moving, 
installing and running Livent productions was unusually high for the 
road, theater veterans say. Indeed, sources at Livent who refused 
to be identified said the company had been planning to scale down 
its touring productions before the bankruptcy filing. Indeed, according 
to court documents, the weekly payroll of Livent's ``Ragtime'' and 
``Showboat'' tours _ $240,000 and $230,000, respectively _ was higher 
than that of the New York production, $219,000. Usually, road companies 
cost considerably less than Broadway productions. Extravagant productions 
and costly promotions are also usually cited when explaining Livent's 
financial plight. But it also tried to redefine itself as a corporate 
impresario by containing all producing functions, including raising 
capital, within the company. The effort greatly increased the risks 
of an already risky business. When the company's new managers, Michael 
Ovitz and Roy Furman, took over last spring and discovered financial 
irregularities, they suspended Garth Drabinsky, the company's former 
creative director, and his co-founder, Myron Gottlieb. Last week, 
both officers were dismissed, and they have filed a countersuit against 
Livent. At this point, it appears that people who have done business 
with Livent still don't know quite how to react. According to court 
papers, Livent's top 30 unsecured creditors include everything from 
law firms to set-building companies. The Toronto office of Skadden, 
Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, for example, is owed $704,000 (all 
figures in U.S. dollars); Echo Advertising and Marketing in Toronto 
is owed $1.6 million; Lincoln Center Theater, which is jointly producing 
``Parade'' with Livent, is owed $248,000; the Rodgers and Hammerstein 
Organization is owed $132,000. Livent owes its own public relations 
firm, Robinson, Lerer &AMP; Montgomery, $151,000, according to court 
papers. F&AMP;D Scene Changes Ltd. in Calgary, which said it is owed 
$104,000 _ mostly for sets for ``Parade'' _ said it was supposed to 
start building a new ``Ragtime'' tour and a new ``Phantom of the Opera'' 
_ both of which have been canceled. ``Once the dust settles from all 
of this, we'll see whether those are going ahead or whether there's 
a Livent left,'' said Leyton Morris, president of F&AMP;D. To some 
extent, Morris said, he saw it coming. Usually F&AMP;D insists on 
payment within 30 days; Livent often took 60 to 90 days. But Livent 
was also a prized client and the company took its chances. ``We gave 
them a pretty long leash,'' Morris said. ``They were our biggest customer.'' 
Livent, meanwhile, continues to try to sell tickets. As a result, 
the board of the Ford Center in Toronto, which was managed and operated 
by Livent, has urged patrons to hold off buying tickets and threatened 
legal action if Ticketmaster continues to sell them. Last week, the 
city of Toronto _ which owns the Ford Center there _ canceled its 
management contract with Livent, and Toronto's mayor, Mel Lastman, 
told The Toronto Star that he was looking for someone to take over. 
Complicating matters, under an unusual arrangement with Livent, the 
money Ticketmaster collects from credit card orders is immediately 
put into Livent accounts. Those accounts have been frozen by Livent's 
major Canadian creditor, CIBC, meaning refunds cannot be made. As 
to what will happen to Livent's theaters, the possible buyers include 
the Shubert Organization, the Nederlander Organization, Jujamcyn Theaters, 
Walt Disney Co. and Cablevision Systems. ``We have an interest,'' 
said Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, ``but 
beyond that, we have nothing to evaluate.''
