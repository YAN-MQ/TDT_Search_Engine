Back in 1968, L. Dennis Kozlowski walked out of Seton Hall University 
with a bachelor's degree in finance and a certainty that numbers were 
the game to play and conglomerates the place to play them. So, he 
joined the ill-starred SCM Corp. as a financial analyst. ``I quickly 
learned two things,'' Kozlowski recalled. ``First, a conglomerate 
can become a real mess if it's just a bureaucratic holding company, 
and second, operations are a lot more fun than accounting.'' Now, 
Kozlowski is busily building a conglomerate that he thinks will be 
fun to run. Last week Tyco International, the company he has headed 
since 1992, crowned an 18-month, $11 billion buying spree by agreeing 
to acquire AMP, a maker of electronic connectors. The deal will rescue 
AMP from a hostile takeover attempt by Allied Signal. His is a process 
fraught with do's and don'ts _ mostly don'ts. ``We don't do hostile 
takeovers, we don't overpay, we don't buy anything that doesn't add 
to earnings right away, we don't buy anything that doesn't add value 
to the businesses we already have,'' he said. ``And we don't buy anything 
that isn't worth at least twice what we could get by buying back our 
stock.'' It's a pretty stringent list of criteria, but apparently, 
lots of companies meet it. Tyco, primarily through acquisitions, has 
grown into a highly profitable company comprising four different businesses: 
fire and security services, disposable medical products, valves and 
pipes, and electrical parts. Counting AMP, Tyco's revenues will be 
more than $22 billion in the coming year. But the acquisitive Kozlowski 
says he is far from satisfied. He expects Tyco to grow 10 percent 
a year without further acquisitions _ and even he laughs at the idea 
that Tyco will stop buying companies. After all, its fire protection 
business is still thinly represented in some countries, and its medical 
business needs to round out its product line. ``We're not negotiating 
with anyone yet,'' he said, ``but we've always got an active list 
of companies to look at.'' It sounds like the kind of company that 
investors, who have long preferred pure-play stocks to conglomerates, 
would hate. But Tyco stock, which closed at $68.00 on Friday, consistently 
sells for about 24 times earnings, a multiple nearly as high as that 
of General Electric, a conglomerate investors love. ``The truth is, 
a diversified company that understands its own core strengths really 
can be successful,'' said Brian K. Langenberg, a conglomerate analyst 
at Credit Suisse First Boston. Tyco has structured itself to run the 
acquisition marathon. Its headquarters are in Exeter, N.H., but it 
switched its legal home to Bermuda when it merged with ADT, the security 
alarm company it bought in July 1997. The move cut its tax rate to 
25 percent from 34 percent. Each of Tyco's four businesses is a separate 
fief, which means the company need not fully digest every acquisition 
before swallowing the next. So what if the medical devices segment 
is still incorporating United States Surgical, the medical-supply 
maker Tyco bought in May? That won't hinder the electrical division 
from absorbing AMP. And, because it does stick to just four businesses 
_ ``we will not add a fifth leg to this mix,'' Kozlowski said emphatically 
_ Tyco can easily spot where potential acquisitions might fit. For 
example, AMP makes connectors that other Tyco divisions have been 
spending $500 million a year to buy. Tyco also expects to save $45 
million a year through combined buying power. But perhaps most important, 
Kozlowski and his team have proved to be adept cost-cutters. Each 
of the four business chiefs came up through operations and knows how 
to sharpen a cost-cutting knife. That's one reason Wall Street assumes 
they can make the numbers work on AMP. Tyco is paying $11.3 billion, 
or $51 a share, for AMP, considerably more than the $44.50 a share 
Allied Signal was offering in its hostile bid. It's a pretty big premium, 
and Lawrence A. Bossidy, Allied's chief, has publicly hinted that 
he thinks Tyco overpaid. But Kozlowski has promised that he can cut 
enough costs, and find enough synergies, to justify the price, and 
analysts are ready to take his word on faith. ``You see a company 
beat its own goals again and again, and you learn to believe it can 
do anything it says,'' said Michael Jaffe, an equity analyst at Standard 
&AMP; Poor's. Even Tyco skeptics wax eloquent about Kozlowski. ``This 
guy is Babe Ruth,'' said John A. Modzelewski, a conglomerate analyst 
at Paine Webber. Though he does not suspect the kinds of accounting 
shenanigans that sidelined Cendant, another rapid acquirer with a 
celebrated chief executive, Modzelewski wonders whether clever (although 
legal) ways of accounting for reserves and post-acquisition cash flows 
might be behind some of Tyco's consistently high earnings. So he has 
given Tyco's stock a relatively tepid ``attractive'' rating. Still, 
he knows his is the minority view. ``Dennis is the stuff that legends 
are made of,'' he said, ``And Tyco has a cult following.''
