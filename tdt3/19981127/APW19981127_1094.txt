He was a gifted computer whiz _ one of the best, one who'd made the 
jump from illegal tinkering to the legitimate, potentially lucrative 
business of making codes crack-proof from hackers like himself. At 
26, Boris Floriciz seemed headed for a great future. He'd just finished 
his computer science degree. International firms sought him as a consultant. 
He was happy, say his friends, who cannot believe he would take his 
own life. Boris was found hanging from a tree in a Berlin park on 
Oct. 22, his belt around his neck and his feet dragging the ground. 
Was it suicide, as police suspect? Or homicide? The mystery of his 
death has drawn attention even outside the tight-knit world of hackers, 
largely because it touches the techno-wizardry of beating encryption 
codes and offers a glimpse into the murkier side of the trade. Spies 
and criminals need talented hackers, too, as espionage and black market 
goods become increasingly high tech. Boris' friends wonder if he had 
become a threat to someone on the wrong side of the business, leading 
to his death. ``That was not a personal decision,'' Andy Mueller-Maguhn, 
a friend and fellow member of the Chaos Computer Club said. ``For 
sure not. That was murder.'' From childhood, Boris looked destined 
to be an engineer. He was always taking things apart to see how they 
worked. ``Radios, television, clocks, the lawn mower _ nothing was 
safe from him,'' his father told Stern magazine. He disassembled a 
telephone booth to get at computer data inside. He was the first hacker 
to crack the microchips on Deutsche Telekom telephone cards, used 
at pay phones in Germany. His homemade card reloaded as the credit 
ran out.
