This is "CNN Headline News." I'm David Goodnow in Atlanta this Thanksgiving 
day. With Thanksgiving celebrations all but complete, many Americans 
are relaxing, recovering and thinking about days of leftovers. Many 
eyes are also focusing on the next big date on the calendar -- december 
25th. The official start of the holiday shopping season kicks off 
Friday morning. Some stores are opening their doors at dawn for those 
who are really ambitious to get presents and stocking stuffers. Meantime, 
signs of Christmas have already sprung up nationwide. In Atlanta on 
Thursday, the annual lighting of the rich's Christmas tree was held 
downtown. The scene was even brighter in Kansas city, Missouri. 200,000 
lights, covering 75 miles, were switched on. The event is a 69-year-old 
holiday tradition.
