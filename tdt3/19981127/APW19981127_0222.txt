Train service slowed to a crawl on Friday during the second national 
rail strike in a week in France. A poll showed that support for train 
workers' grievances remains strong but is waning. About one in three 
long-distance trains was running Friday and one in four regional trains, 
the state-run train authority, the SNCF, said. Suburban lines used 
heavily to get people to work were hobbled. Eurostar trains to London 
were not effected by the strike. Early Friday morning at the Gare 
de l'Est, travelers crowded around revised timetables that were often 
incorrect. ``It's going to be really difficult today,'' SNCF employee 
Said Skender told a group of some 20 people gathered around an information 
booth at the Gare de l''Est. ``Even if the timetable says 1:00 p.m., 
you never know when the train will actually leave.'' A few people 
were visibly irate, shouting at employees. ``There's supposed to be 
minimum service,'' called out one person waiting for a train. ``This 
isn't minimum service. I'm not going to get there at all.'' But many 
travelers said they sympathized with strikers. ``They know what they 
have to do to get people to listen to their problems,'' said Parisian 
Pulal Ardobah, 35. ``It's annoying, but I understand.'' A poll by 
the CSA firm, published in Friday's edition of the daily Le Parisien 
showed that 56 percent of those sampled support or have sympathy for 
strikers, compared to 25 percent who are opposed or hostile. But that 
is a drop from the 70 percent sympathy rating registered during Monday's 
strike by rail workers in six European countries, including France, 
to protest plans to open state-owned railways to private operators 
in the European Union. The EU said the proposed changes, which are 
not set to go into effect immediately, would be limited to the freight 
sector. The margin of error for the poll, which sampled 1,001 adults, 
was not available, but with such a sampling is usually plus or minus 
three percent. Rail workers are protesting what they see as insufficient 
staff, and are concerned about how the government will implement a 
plan to cut the workweek from 39 to 35 hours. Unions were to meet 
later Friday to decide whether to continue the walkout, which started 
Thursday at 8 p.m., beyond Saturday morning.
