A British newspaper is reporting lawyers for former Chilean leader 
augusto pinochet plan to argue he is not mentally fit to stand trial. 
They hope that argument might persuade British authorities to stop 
pinochet's extradition to Spain. Spanish authorities are preparing 
to charge Pinochet with genocide, terrorism and torture for incidents 
that took place during his 17-year regime. In Chile, Pinochet supporters 
have been clashing with police. Wednesday, they blocked traffic near 
the Spanish ambassador's residence. Police made 112 arrests in Santiago.
