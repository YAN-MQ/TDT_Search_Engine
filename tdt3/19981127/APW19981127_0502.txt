China's defense minister sought on Friday to soothe fears in Asia 
over his country's military might by describing its substantial armed 
forces as a relatively small, non-threatening power undergoing important 
reforms. ``China will never seek to be a superpower,'' said Minister 
of National Defense Chi Haotian in a speech in Singapore on China's 
military policy. ``China will never pose a threat to other countries.'' 
Speaking in Mandarin, Chi said Asia's largest nation will continue 
to focus on boosting its economy, and military expenditure will be 
subordinated to national development. ``Compared to the United States 
and Japan, China's defense budget is very small indeed,'' he said. 
In 1998, the country spent about dlrs 11 billion on defense, compared 
to about dlrs 42 billion by Japan and dlrs 255 billion by the United 
States, according to Chi. And unlike other military world powers, 
China lacks the ability to mount a long-range attack and maintains 
no troops or facilities overseas, he said. Despite this, the country 
has a huge army, with about 1.2 million people in uniform. Recently-implemented 
reforms that remove the People's Liberation Army's extensive commercial 
enterprises were extremely important, Chi said. ``These commercial 
activities brought some very negative influences and effects into 
the PLA,'' he said. The army ventured into commerce in the 1980s to 
supplement declining government outlays as China concentrated on modernizing 
its backward economy. By the early 1990s, revenues from such enterprises 
_ in everything from hotels to discos and mobile phone networks _ 
supplied a third of the PLA's operating expenses, and had raised the 
specter of growing corruption in the military. To sustain regional 
stability, Chi reiterated China's long-held belief that countries 
should refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of other nations. 
Asia's security remains ``relatively stable'' even though the region 
is struggling through its worst economic crisis in decades, he added. 
On the dispute over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea _ claimed 
by China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam _ Chi said, 
``Common development (of the islands) is the most realistic way to 
deal with the problem.'' Chi is on a four-day trip to the Southeast 
Asian city-state, and has met his Singapore counterpart Tony Tan in 
addition to Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister Lee Kuan 
Yew.
