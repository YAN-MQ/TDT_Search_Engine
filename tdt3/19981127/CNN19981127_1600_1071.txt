And one product you might not think needs any advertising -- Viagra. 
But Pfizer, the maker of the hit anti-impotence drug, is planning 
a national television advertising campaign for Viagra. Viagra is the 
most successful launch of a new prescription drug ever, but sales 
have been slowing in recent months -- Pfizer selling over $400 million 
of the anti-impotence drug in the second quarter, but sales dropped 
to $141 million in the third quarter. And new warnings on Viagra labels 
required by the food and drug administration is expected to further 
cut into sales.
