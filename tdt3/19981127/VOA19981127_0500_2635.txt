Voter registration has begun in South Africa for next year's general 
election, but the opposition's National Party is challenging the process. 
Registration stations opened in five of the country's nine provinces, 
Friday. Registration will be held in the other provinces early next 
month. South Africa has an estimated 25 million people eligible to 
take part in the nation's second democratic ballot since the end of 
apartite in 1994. But the white-dominated National Party said Thursday, 
it is going to court to block the registration process. The party 
says it plans to contest a rule that only people in possession of 
bar-coded identity books will be allowed to register.
