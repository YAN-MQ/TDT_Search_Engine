Singapore suffered an unexpected bout of haze on Friday when winds 
swept smoke from forest fires in neighboring Indonesia over the city-state 
for the first time in months. The pollution standards index _ which 
measures smoke haze and other air pollutants _ climbed into the ``moderate'' 
range in the morning. By 2 p.m., the index had risen to 69. Any reading 
above 100 is considered unhealthy, and health officials recommend 
curtailed outdoor activity for school children and asthmatics. Wong 
Teo Suan, deputy director of Singapore's Meteorological Service, said 
the haze was from fires _ probably due to land-clearing _ on the nearby 
Indonesian island of Sumatra, which is experiencing drier weather. 
``There are a few isolated hot spots in central Sumatra and some them 
are quite near Singapore,'' said Singapore's Environment Ministry 
in a later statement. A change in wind direction was sending ``smoke 
haze from the forest fires to be blown over Singapore,'' explained 
Wong. Visibility had dropped to about 5 kilometers (3 miles) around 
Changi Airport at noon, he added. ``But the fires are actually fairly 
isolated and we don't expect them to spread further,'' Wong said. 
``Prevailing winds are likely to change course in the next few days 
too.'' By late afternoon, some of the haze had already begun to dissipate, 
and the pollution index had started to drop. The regional haze problem 
had subsided since April as the El Nino weather pattern _ which caused 
unusually dry conditions that exacerbated the spread of annual forest 
fires _ eased and was replaced by wetter weather.
