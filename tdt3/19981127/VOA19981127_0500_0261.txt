More than 100 people feared dead now, from Thursday's train collision 
in Northern India. VOA New Delhi correspondent Douglas Backshon reports, 
recovery efforts are continuing. Rescue workers cleared away more 
wreckage from the scene Friday, as railway officials conducted their 
probe. The collision occurred in the early morning darkness, Thursday 
near Kana town. Several cars from a passenger train to Amritzer derailed 
and shortly afterwards, another train bound for Calcutta hit the derailed 
cars. A government statement quotes the railway minister as saying 
the accident could have been caused by a broken coupler that links 
the train cars together, or by a fractured rail. But nothing is official. 
According to some accounts, a railway gateman at the crash site tried 
to telephone a warning about the derailment, but by the time he got 
through to the neighboring station, the second train had already left. 
Railway officials say the collision occurred just minutes after the 
derailment. These are details the investigation will have to sort 
out. Douglas Bacshon, VOA NEWS, New Delhi.
