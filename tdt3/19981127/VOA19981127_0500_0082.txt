Chile's foreign minister Jose Miguel Insulsa is in London to day, 
to ask for the release of former military leader Augusto Pinochet. 
Mr. Insulsa is to meet with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook who 
has said many times that the Pinochet matter is up to the courts. 
The former dictator is under police guard in a London clinic, since 
the arrest last month. He could be extradited to Spain to face charges 
of genocide and torture.
