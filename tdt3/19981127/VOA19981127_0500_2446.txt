An international non-profit group has launched two research and development 
partnerships with links to Africa, aimed at speeding up the research, 
or search for an effective AIDS vaccine. The New York-based International 
Aids Vaccine Initiative is providing $9 million to two research enterprises. 
The projects will use African strains of the HIV virus in their experimental 
vaccines. This will increase the chance that any vaccine showing promise 
will be specifically useful in Africa. Also both partnership agreements 
involve provisions to insure that the benefits of the research are 
available in the developing world.
