For Roman Catholics, the year 2000 offers early salvation. Pope John 
Paul II announced Friday that in celebration of entering the third 
millennium of Christianity, penitents who do a charitable deed or 
give up cigarettes or alcohol for a day can earn an ``indulgence'' 
to eliminate punishment on earth or in purgatory. Church officials 
emphasize that indulgences are linked to a sincere repentance and 
are not a one-day expedient. Still, some liberal Catholics are embarrassed 
by a practice that seems to offer a simplistic shortcut to salvation. 
Indulgences are an ancient form of church-granted amnesty that release 
penitents from certain forms of punishment for past sins. The medieval 
church sold indulgences, a practice that drove Martin Luther to rebel, 
leading to the Reformation. They remain a source of theological debate 
between Protestants and Catholics, and since Vatican II, the Roman 
Catholic Church had played down their importance. By restoring indulgences 
to so prominent a position, John Paul II is making penitence a theme 
of the church's observance of the millennium. He is also reassuring 
conservatives in the church. But by broadening the ways believers 
can earn an indulgence, he is also trying to imbue indulgences with 
some of the ecumenical spirit he wants to give the celebrations. In 
a papal bull titled ``Incarnationis Mysterium'' (The Mystery of the 
Incarnation) to be formally issued on Sunday, the pope proclaimed 
2000 a Holy Year, and put forth edicts that in many ways serve as 
a practical guide for spiritual good works during the Jubilee, or 
church anniversary. He decreed that the Jubilee would begin on Christmas 
Day 1999 and end on the Feast of the Epiphany, Jan. 6, 2001. Parts 
of the papal document dealt with collective penitence. Pope John Paul 
II asked Catholics to seek forgiveness for past historical errors 
during the Jubilee. He also asked rich nations to ease or substantially 
eliminate Third World debt. The pope said individual sinners would 
be granted ``plenary indulgences,'' which cancel the punishment for 
repented sins. In Catholic theology, souls in purgatory are purifying 
themselves before their entry into heaven. The indulgences are not 
meant to save people from eternal punishment if they commit grave 
sins and do not repent, the church teaches. The pope included personal 
acts of penitence or charity work as a way of earning an indulgence. 
Throughout the millennial celebration, believers will be offered a 
wider selection of ways to receive a plenary indulgence. They can 
follow tradition and attend a Mass in one of several designated churches 
and perform such devotions as the rosary or the stations of the cross. 
Or, an appendix to the pope's letter says, they can visit the sick, 
the imprisoned or the handicapped, or give to the poor. Or they can 
choose an act of private sacrifice. The appendix, signed by Cardinal 
William Baum, an American who is a top Vatican official, explained: 
``This would include abstaining for at least one whole day from unnecessary 
consumption (e.g. from smoking, or alcohol, or fasting.)'' The text 
points out that sinners must also fulfill the ``usual spiritual and 
sacramental conditions'' and say the ``usual prayers.'' Archbishop 
Crescenzio Sepe, a top official in the Vatican's Committee for the 
Great Jubilee of the Year 2000, said, ``One could be tempted to think: 
`Today I won't smoke or I won't drink wine. I'll get a plenary indulgence 
and go to paradise.' '' That, he said, would be wrong. ``That would 
not be the spirit of an indulgence,'' he said. ``That would be off-beam, 
like returning to the thinking of the Middle Ages.'' Indulgences are 
not one-day expedients, Sepe said, but he did not make light of brief 
sacrifices. ``Its not so easy for some to give up smoking for a day,'' 
he said. ``It might be easier to visit a prison inmate.'' The pope's 
decision to expand the use of indulgences during the millennium celebration 
is not entirely surprising. In 1985, the pope indicated his respect 
for the practice by allowing Catholics to receive indulgences by television. 
Believers who followed on television or radio a church service where 
an indulgence was granted could be included, as long as they fulfilled 
the same conditions as those physically present, including confession, 
communion and prayer. But indulgences, which began in early Christian 
times, have not always been viewed favorably. In the 16th century, 
Pope Julius II offered indulgences in exchange for contributions to 
build St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Luther protested, and as his theological 
criticisms mounted, he was excommunicated in 1521. The church later 
banned the sale of indulgences, but the Vatican reaffirmed their religious 
importance at the Council of Trent in 1563. In 1968, Pope Paul VI 
also elaborated on the subject. Including indulgences in the 2000 
Jubilee ``could not be avoided,'' said the Rev. Jared Wicks, a theologian 
at Gregorian University in Rome. ``Conservative Catholics would find 
it intolerable that, for ecumenical considerations, the church put 
into the closet a practice affirmed by the Council of Trent,'' Wicks 
said, adding with a laugh, ``And John Paul II is not one to do anything 
like that.''
