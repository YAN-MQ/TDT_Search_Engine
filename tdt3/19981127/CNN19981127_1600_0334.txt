City officials hope $433,000 will transform the Los Angeles police 
department's crime laboratory into a credible operation. That's how 
much money they're allocating to improve the facility lawyer Johnnie 
Cochran once called a cesspool of contamination. During O.J. Simpson's 
criminal trial, Cochran and the rest of the defense team argued sloppy 
handling made the evidence unreliable. Even a department report criticized 
the lab's antiquated equipment and inadequate facilities, much of 
which will be replaced by the new funding.
