The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 28: The 
global financial market can move trillions of dollars around the world 
within minutes, but the major players are usually viewed as being 
from one country or another. Even those companies that operate in 
many countries, such as Citigroup or Merrill Lynch, are still seen 
as basically American. Now Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank and 
the second-biggest in Europe, proposes to buy Bankers Trust, the seventh-largest 
American bank, for $9.7 billion in cash. If approved by regulators 
and shareholders, the merger would create the world's largest financial 
institution and, perhaps, the first multinational financial juggernaut. 
Whether it would create the world's most powerful financial institution 
is another matter. Both Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust have had problems 
in recent years and have seen their stocks perform worse than shares 
of competitors. Deutsche Bank, like other big German banks, engages 
in both commercial and investment banking. But its efforts to establish 
an international presence in investment banking have been largely 
frustrated. It bought Morgan Grenfell, the British investment bank 
founded by the father of J.P. Morgan that played a major role in financing 
France in the Franco-Prussian war, but eventually killed the brand 
name after a reorganization sent many bankers fleeing. It has found 
it difficult to merge the cultures of commercial and investment banking. 
Bankers Trust, which decided to get out of retail banking _ that is, 
banking aimed at individuals as opposed to large corporations _ about 
two decades ago, seems to have done a better job of moving into investment 
banking through its acquisitions of Alex Brown in the United States 
and of Natwest Markets in Britain. But there have been grumblings 
of discontent at Alex Brown, and Bankers Trust's image has not completely 
recovered from its derivatives debacle of a few years ago, when it 
was fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for deceiving 
a corporate customer. Deutsche Bank will have to scramble to raise 
the money needed to close this deal, and regulators should watch closely 
to be sure that it maintains adequate capital for the far-flung operations 
it is taking on. Assuming that is done and the deal is completed, 
Deutsche Bank will face the daunting task of operating what will be 
the closest thing yet to a genuinely multinational financial giant.
