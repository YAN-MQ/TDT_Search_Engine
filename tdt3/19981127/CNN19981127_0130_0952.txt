There's no sign oil-producing countries are going to push oil prices 
up anytime soon. OPEC ministers ended their meeting in Vienna without 
an agreement to extend cuts in oil production. Some delegates had 
voiced hope an earlier production cut would be extended until the 
end of next year. But they left disappointed. Ministers agreed to 
meet again in March. Meanwhile, Exxon, the world's largest oil company, 
reportedly is in talks to buy mobil, the second largest oil company 
in the United States. If completed, the deal would be the largest 
industrial merger ever. No price has been set.
