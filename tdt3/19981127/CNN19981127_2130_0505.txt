This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Saturday morning. More rain in the west. Rainfall 
in southern California during the day on Saturday. Los Angeles will 
probably see rainfall. As the day goes along, the rainfall moves to 
the east through Arizona. Eventually precipitation will move into 
the southern Rockies, where, some of it could turn to snow. However, 
it is going to be quite warm throughout much of the nation -- daytime 
highs in the 60s and 70s in a large area of the United States. It 
is cooler in the west, with the storms moving through. Here is our 
extended forecast. It remains relatively warm throughout the U.S. 
going on into Sunday. But still, precipitation scattered about in 
the west with snowfall in the higher elevations of the Rockies. On 
Monday, you can see some of that rain begins to move on into the east. 
A few thunderstorms are possible in the southern plains states. And 
as we head on into Tuesday, you can see rainfall still in the northwestern 
corner of the United States. For more weather information, log on
