Time now for a look at the weather across the country on this chilly 
New York night. For that we go to WNBC-TV in New York. Janice, good 
evening. Welcome to our neighborhoods. It looks like the major problem 
tonight and today has been on the west coast with a storm system that's 
been bringing rain to most of California, mainly around the San Francisco 
bay area and across central California. Now southern California getting 
precipitation from the storm. Thick clouds over the west coast. Still 
cloudiness across parts of the pacific northwest, although most of 
that has started to shift east. Snow in the higher elevations. Quiet 
in the east. Temperatures are chilly, though. It's 44 in New York. 
It's been a windy day. Look at the mild air that's over the central 
portion of the cundri. Right now we've got temperatures in the 60's 
and 50's as far north as Nebraska. All that warm air is going to start 
to go to the east. Tonight rather chilly, though. 50's around St. 
Louis tonight. 70's there tomorrow. 60's as far north as Iowa and 
across southern South Dakota. Highs in the 50's and 60's in the northeast 
tomorrow. Very rainy over the southwest and southern California. Seattle, 
43, 67 in Denver tomorrow. Dallas we'll see a high of 74. Now, as 
we check out the jet stream tomorrow, there's the storm over the west 
coast. Showers and precipitation continuing there. That low will shift 
into the central plains by Monday and bring thunderstorms and showers 
into Texas and OK OK. As we go into the northeast, it's going to be 
mild by Monday with temperatures near record levels. It may be close 
to 70 degrees. That's the weather around the nation. Janice, thank 
you.
