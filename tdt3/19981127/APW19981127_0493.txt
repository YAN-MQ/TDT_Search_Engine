The premier of Montenegro, the smaller republic of present-day Yugoslavia, 
arrived Friday in Slovenia on the first official visit by a government 
leader of the federation Slovenia seceded from in 1991. Filip Vujanovic 
was invited to visit by his Slovene counterpart Boris Frlec. He also 
met President Milan Kucan and Premier Janez Drnovsek. Both Vujanovic 
and Frlec said they regretted the failure of Slovenia and Yugoslavia 
to establish diplomatic relations seven years after Slovenia proclaimed 
independence from the old federation. Relations have remained strained 
because of Yugoslavia's insistence that it is the only heir to the 
former federation. That has prevented the two countries from being 
able to agree on how to divide the assets former Yugoslavia held abroad. 
The absence of diplomatic relations hurts both countries' citizens, 
the two said in a joint statement carried by the news agency STA. 
Slovenia and neighboring Croatia simultaneously proclaimed independence 
from Yugoslavia, which led to a 10-day war in Slovenia, and a much 
longer and bloodier war in Croatia, as Yugoslav authorities sought 
to prevent the republics' secession. Pressed by the West, Yugoslavia 
and Croatia established diplomatic relations in August 1996. Vujanovic 
said Montenegro, whose reformist leaders have been at odds with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic, ``has an open foreign policy. It wants 
to be integrated into the European and world's organizations.'' In 
an interview with the Slovene daily Delo, Vujanovic blamed the Belgrade 
government for carrying out ``autarkic policy which led Yugoslavia 
to isolation, economic stagnation and a decrease of people's living 
standards.'' Vujanovic did not speak about Kosovo, Yugoslavia's southern 
province, where international officials have been trying to reconcile 
ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
