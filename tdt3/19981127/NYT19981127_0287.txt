One is old and one is young. One has a reputation as the most flamboyant 
pass rusher in pro football, and one is ... well, an offensive lineman. 
One is an elite player who does celebrity cameos in the ring; the 
other is ... well, a rookie. All week, Kevin Greene of the Carolina 
Panthers and Jason Fabini of the New York Jets have been circling 
each other from different cities, different perspectives, different 
sides. Fabini said of Greene: ``He rushes the passer _ that's his 
thing.'' Greene said of Fabini: ``I understand he's a good player.'' 
Fabini and Greene square off Sunday when the teams meet at the New 
Jersey Meadowlands in the start of a season-ending five-game stretch 
for the Jets. If the Jets sweep, they will capture the the team's 
first division title since 1969. First up is the Carolina game, where 
Fabini's assignment is to stop Greene. ``I've watched him wrestle 
a few times,'' Fabini said Friday. Hulk Hogan is a good friend of 
Greene's, and Greene has been seen on television throwing people around 
the arena. But until this week, Fabini had never focused on Greene 
in a football way. He got an eyeful: Greene's 14 sacks are unsurpassed 
in the National Football League this year, equaled only by the Packers' 
Reggie White. Greene's 147 career sacks lead all linebackers in league 
history. ``I've never studied the guy in depth,'' Fabini said, ``but 
obviously, he leads the NFL in sacks. He's a very smart guy. Very 
strong, very smart.'' The matchup is intriguing. The 36-year-old Greene, 
in his 14th year, is the Panthers' designated pass rusher from his 
left outside linebacker position. More than almost any other linebacker 
in the league, Greene tussles with offensive tackles. His is a dual 
role, however, because Carolina has problems defending against the 
pass. Thus he will drop back into coverage as well. Fabini, meanwhile, 
has been such a quick study at right tackle that coach Bill Parcells 
comes close to gushing over him. The coach talks of Fabini's intelligence, 
his understanding of the game. Now the club's only rookie starter, 
Fabini caught the eye of the Jets' management early on. When Jets 
player personnel director Dick Haley watched Fabini play for the University 
of Cincinnati last year, Haley came back the next morning and said: 
``I finally saw a football player Friday. Forget all the talk about 
athleticism.'' Over the summer, the Jets' coaches were calling him 
a throwback who plays simply for the love of the game. At the time, 
Fabini was merely a fourth-round pick. Early in the season, Fabini 
was penalized for false starts in five straight games. And he recalls 
giving up a few sacks, but his transition to the pro trenches has 
been remarkably smooth. ``He hasn't really struggled as a rookie,'' 
said Kevin Mawae, the Jets' veteran center. ``And if he did, Bill 
Parcells would let him know it. He makes his blocks, and that's the 
hardest thing to remember.'' Fabini, who is 6 feet 7 inches and weighs 
310 pounds, will have a size advantage against Greene, who is 6-3 
and weighs 245. But the rookie will need speed as well as strength. 
``Fabini's going to have his hands full,'' Parcells said. ``He has 
to make sure Greene doesn't cut around the corner.'' Greene has a 
history of interesting moves off the field, too. Back in 1996, on 
the Tuesday before his Steelers were to face the 49ers in the Super 
Bowl in Phoenix, Greene flew to Las Vegas for a ringside appointment 
with the dirty-dealing Ric Flair. Greene did not actually wrestle, 
but he did engage in a pre-match tussle with Flair. Since then, Greene 
went to Carolina as a free agent, spent one season there, got into 
a salary dispute with general manager Bill Polian and left as a free 
agent for the 49ers. That lasted a year, too, and this season Greene 
returned to Carolina, while Polian has moved on to become the president 
of the Colts. But Greene might be streamlining his act. Three weeks 
ago, he cut his shoulder-length hair. ``My 1-year-old was calling 
me Mommy,'' he said. ``I knew it was time to cut it.'' Until this 
year, Greene was a captain and tank commander in the Army Reserves. 
He boasts a pin with paratrooper's wings. But with a young family, 
Greene decided he wanted to spend more time at home, or at least close 
to football. He says he is in bed by 8:30 p.m. and is in the weight 
room by 8 a.m. five days a week. EXTRA POINTS _ Quarterback GLENN 
FOLEY saw Thursday's controversial overtime coin flip in the Steelers-Lions 
game and described it as deja vu. Foley described the situation against 
New England on Oct. 19 this way: ``I said tails, the ref said the 
call is heads. It wasn't as big a deal because it was the beginning 
of the game.'' The Patriots did not score on their opening drive. 
Foley said he was on the sideline ``telling people I called tails, 
but nobody believed me.'' _ CURTIS MARTIN needs 71 yards to became 
the fourth Jet to gain 1,000 rushing yards in a season. JOHN RIGGINS 
was the first, followed by FREEMAN McNEIL and ADRIAN MURRELL.
