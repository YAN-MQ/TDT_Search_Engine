The oil patch is still reeling from the announcement earlier this 
week, that Exxon, the second largest oil company in the world behind 
Royal Dutch Shell, and Mobile Oil are in merger talks, a mega deal 
said to be worth somewhere near $69 billion. If it is going to go 
through, it will likely come under intense scrutiny from US regulators. 
Because, the new company would reassemble parts of the Standard Oil 
Trust that was broken up 80 years ago. Fergus McCloud, an oil analyst, 
says the combination though, might turn out to be a good one for consumers. 
It means that the organizations that provide you with gasoline at 
service stations should have lower costs, and they should be able 
to pass on some of the benefits of lower costs in resale prices that 
are lower than they would otherwise be. If Exxon and Mobile do combine, 
the new company would be by far the largest in the world.
