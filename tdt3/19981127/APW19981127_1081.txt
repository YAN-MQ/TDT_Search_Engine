PARIS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday called on 
African leaders - especially those at war in Congo - to renounce violence 
and accept compromise in the quest for peace on the strife-torn continent. 
Speaking at a summit of African leaders in Paris, Annan said many 
African conflicts are ``rooted in a culture of intolerance'' and that 
war in Congo poses the greatest challenge for the continent. ``In 
the Congo, as everywhere, what is needed is for all parties irrevocably 
to choose peace and compromise, turning their backs on violence and 
conflict,'' Annan said. French President Jacques Chirac, for his part, 
urged African nations to do their own peacekeeping - a departure from 
past practices that put the burden on France and other Western nations. 
Chirac also renewed France's call for a regional peace conference 
in central Africa's Great Lakes region. Annan and Chirac spoke at 
the opening ceremony of the 20th French-African summit, where 34 African 
leaders are focusing on security issues. But as the summit got underway, 
all eyes were on Congolese President Laurent-Desire Kabila, who crosses 
paths here with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, 
Rwanda's leader. Both Rwanda and Uganda support rebels waging an insurgency 
in the Congo. Kabila's presence in France has been the focus of attention 
in the wake of the decision by Britain's House of Lords rejecting 
immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. But French 
Prosecutors, responding to complaints by the French Human Rights League 
and the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues, ruled Friday 
that Kabila cannot be pursued for human rights violations because 
he benefits from the customary immunity accorded to exercising heads 
of state. Though concrete solutions to the Congo crisis were unlikely 
to emerge from the summit, participants said they hoped for progress. 
Charles Josselin, France's cooperation minister in Africa, said Friday 
he hoped for a resolution to the conflict in Congo ``during the month 
of December.'' And the Rwandan leader said Wednesday he is prepared 
to meet with Kabila in Paris. But Kabila has not been optimistic, 
saying a pullout of Rwandan and Ugandan-backed forces from the Congo 
was a precondition for substantive talks on a peace settlement. In 
an interview broadcast Thursday on Radio France Internationale, Kabila 
added that his allies, Angola and Zimbabwe, ``were not pushing (him) 
to negotiate.'' Kabila and the Ugandan president are scheduled to 
hold separate talks with French President Jacques Chirac on Saturday. 
Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said there had been some 
progress toward a dialogue between Kabila and his adversaries, with 
each of the parties presenting their views. ``That at least allows 
one to look directly at the problems, which is a beginning,'' Colonna 
said. The French, 16th graf pvs
