Singapore's cost-cutting package introduced this week may boost Japanese 
investments in the city-state, a Japanese business official said Friday. 
Takashi Imai, head of the influential Keidanren, Japan Federation 
of Economic Organizations, told reporters the measures will attract 
interest from the business community in Japan. Singapore has begun 
a wide-reaching program to cut business costs by about 10.5 billion 
Singapore dollars (dlrs 6.3 billion), which should make the city-state 
more competitive and interesting to investors. Imai, chairman of Nippon 
Steel Corp., said the rebate on capital goods investments for hi-tech 
industries was especially attractive. Direct investments from Japan 
and the rest of east Asia last year increased by an 150 billion yen 
(dlrs 1.2 billion) to 750 billion yen (dlrs 6.1 billion), with most 
of it engaged in Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong met earlier Friday with Imai 
and other Japanese businessmen. Goh called for more Japanese investments 
in those Southeast Asian nations that have responded well to economic 
restructuring and reform, Singapore TV reported.
