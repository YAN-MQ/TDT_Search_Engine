It's a truism that trends don't seem to exist until they're given 
a label that gains wide acceptance. Think of Seattle grunge, New York 
minimalism or winter white. So it is that the biggest obstacle to 
American men's adopting the European tradition of carrying a small 
shoulder, underarm or hand-held bag _ perfect for housing all of one's 
microscopic communications hardware, from cell phones to CD players 
_ is that there's nothing appropriate to call these accessories. The 
bags don't lack for style, their sleek, sporty look bringing to mind 
Roger Vadim, circa 1966, en route to meet a curvaceous blonde starlet. 
Maybe the Etienne Aigner bag found at a flea market for $10 once even 
graced the wrist of the French director, or at least one of his fans. 
But still, what to call the darn thing? The resistance to this accessory 
in the United States may well have been sealed by one of the more 
common terms for it in the early '70s: the ``manbag.'' I don't think 
so. But other names are not much better: Man-purse, wrist purse, wrist 
bag, clutch case, shoulder bag. It's enough to make you reach for 
a nice, simple briefcase. The prickly nomenclature issue is somewhat 
helped by the fact that there are so many shapes and sizes of small, 
oh, let's just call them carry-cases, on the market today. An equally 
formidable source of resistance is that many men are convinced that 
carrying such a bag isn't masculine. But in this era of '70s-influenced, 
unisex clothing, the time is right for a reappraisal. The Florentine 
company Il Bisonte, which has been making leather goods with a Continental 
flair since 1968, offers a cornucopia of the bags at its SoHo boutique, 
as well as at Bloomingdale's. There are small and large shoulder satchels 
($198 and $315) reminiscent of a manly conductor's bag, and snap-closure 
leather envelopes ($148), one of which is toted by Bill Cosby. Anyone 
want to call Cos a wimp? Prada has taken a page from the Il Bisonte 
book lately, offering a variety of unisex-style shoulder bags. The 
most discreet, a small nylon bag, $220, just big enough for a cell 
phone or other hand-held hardware, could even be worn underneath a 
blazer, the shoulder strap making for that always chic crossing-guard 
look. More rugged is a bag that is in essence half a backpack. Made 
of nylon, costing $420, it gets slung over the shoulder like a mountaineer's 
coil of rope but is perhaps better suited to scaling the social heights. 
For those who want the designer initial of the minute, Fendi has a 
small unisex shoulder bag with two pockets adorned with an ``F,'' 
for $529. Leave it to Gucci to get the Vadimesque wrist case down 
pat. At $340, Gucci's case comes in black polished calf with the initial 
``G'' stitched into the side. Bergdorf Goodman offers a simple small 
travel case by Tanner Krolle, for $525, for the man who really wants 
to invest in the look. Louis Vuitton offers hand-held cases in leather 
or monogrammed canvas, ranging in price from $355 to $615. Unfortunately, 
the powers that be at Louis Vuitton have dubbed this model the frilly-sounding 
``pochette.'' But you can ignore the name and think of it as, say, 
a megawallet, a grenade case or something similarly imposing. For 
those shopping for the man who already has everything that the Sharper 
Image offers, a small place to put his stuff might make a good gift. 
Just don't call the bag a purse. Or if you do, be sure to have the 
receipt handy.
