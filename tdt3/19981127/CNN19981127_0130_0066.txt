Many Americans took note of their own blessings on Thanksgiving by 
helping others less fortunate. In Harlem, New York, musical artists, 
including Sean "puffy" combs and sister souljah took part in the fourth 
annual Thanksgiving feast for the homeless. And in Atlanta, the 30th 
annual "feed the hungry" effort gave meals to as many as 20,000 people 
at Turner field. The event is organized by veteran civil rights activist 
hosea Williams. We do more than just feed on Thanksgiving day. We 
feed minds and uplift downtrodden spirits.
