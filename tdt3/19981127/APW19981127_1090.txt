Authorities tightened security around the country Friday for fear 
of attacks timed to the 20th anniversary of a Kurdish rebel organization, 
despite the rebel leader's declaration that the group had given up 
armed struggle. Investigators examined the wreckage left by a bomb 
that blew up a bus on a road about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of 
Ankara, killing four and injuring 17 early Friday. Suspicion fell 
on the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, blamed for similar bombings 
in its war for Kurdish autonomy. PKK responsibility would discredit 
Abdullah Ocalan's announcement this month that the rebels would now 
use only peaceful means to advance the cause of Turkey's Kurds. On 
Friday, authorities posted extra police and military at airports, 
military posts and ammunition depots. Ocalan founded the PKK in 1978 
to seek greater cultural rights for Kurds, who sought official recognition 
as a distinct minority and freedom to use their own language in schools 
and broadcasting. The movement turned into a guerrilla army in 1984, 
launching 14 years of attacks on civilians and clashes with Turkey's 
army. Ocalan announced a PKK change of policy shortly after his Nov. 
12 arrest in Rome, where he is now awaiting a decision on his request 
for political asylum. ``We want to do things like the Basques in Spain 
and the IRA in Northern Ireland,'' Ocalan said Wednesday in Rome. 
It was not clear if Ocalan's attempts at transforming the PKK into 
a political movement will be successful _ or if his guerrillas would 
heed his orders from Europe. Turkish intelligence has reported that 
Ocalan's move away from the region has badly hurt the PKK in terms 
of logistics and in the command line, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem 
said Friday. Ocalan left Syria, where he had been in hiding for years, 
after Turkey threatened military action against Damascus if it did 
not end its support to the rebels. In Rome, Kurds marked Friday's 
anniversary by erecting a marble plaque outside the military hospital 
where Ocalan had been detained after his arrest. The plaque proclaimed 
the piazza's new name to be ``Piazza Kurdistan.'' The international 
attention to Ocalan's case could push Turkey to review its Kurdish 
policy, which does not grant minority rights to some 12 million Kurds. 
Some non-Kurdish Turks believe the time has come to lift a ban on 
the use of the Kurdish language, at least. ``Let them have schools, 
let them have television,'' Hikmet Cetinkaya, a columnist for daily 
Cumhuriyet daily. ``These are basic human rights.'' The fighting has 
claimed some 37,000 lives and stained Turkey's human rights record, 
often cited by European Union countries as an obstacle to Turkey's 
full membership in the 15-nation bloc. The conflict also blocked the 
economic development of the poor, Kurdish-dominated southeast. Even 
if the rebels have changed tactics, Turkey's influential military 
seems determined to keep fighting. ``This struggle will be maintained 
in every condition,'' Gen. Erol Tutal declared Thursday.
