American Tennis star, Pete Sampras has made history thanks to a little 
help from the man who tried to take the world number one ranking from 
him. John Meyers reports that Sampras keeps the world number one spot 
after Marcello Rios pulled out of the season-ending ATP Championships 
in Germany. Day three produced some more thrilling tennis, and another 
sharp withdrawal as Pete Sampras was crowned World Number One for 
a record breaking six consecutive years. Following the decision by 
number two Marcello Rios to pull out minutes before his clash with 
Greg Rosetsky, the British number two standing in for Andre Aggassi 
had no problems in beating second reserve Albert Costa in straight 
sets. Whilst earlier his fellow countryman Tim Henmon booked a semi-final 
place with a two sets to one big three over Alex Carrachi. A full 
house of around 14,000 people enjoyed the final match of the day, 
which turned into an exhibition as Pete Sampras celebrated retaining 
the top spot with a 6-2, 6-1, crushing of Slovak Carol Cacharro. John 
Meyers for VOA Sports in Hanover Germany.
