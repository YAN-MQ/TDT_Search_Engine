The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 28: For 
nearly two decades, Raymond Horton has served as an indispensable 
nuisance for successive mayors, governors, lawmakers and labor leaders 
in New York state. That was not his official title, of course. Horton's 
job has been president of the Citizens Budget Commission and author 
of countless critiques of New York City and state budget practices. 
He retires Monday after a career of angering more people for more 
of the right reasons for longer than almost anyone else in the city. 
Only this year, New York City officials attempted to get corporate 
donors to withdraw support from the Budget Commission, which under 
Horton had the audacity to question the city's fiscal practices and 
labor agreements. The commission then held one of its most successful 
fund-raisers ever. That is because outsiders have come to depend on 
its analyses, and elected officials, whether they realize it or not, 
have been able to use Horton's suggestions to push for better policies. 
Horton has been more than a number cruncher. He rejects the idea that 
budget gaps need to be closed by cuts in welfare, aid to the poor 
or vital city services. Instead he and the commission have shown how 
savings can be made by improving productivity, work rules and sloppy 
management practices. Above all, Horton and the commission have played 
a major role in making the city's budget practices more open than 
those of most governments. Horton returns to writing and teaching 
at the Columbia School of Business. New Yorkers will miss him.
