There's been a sharp drop in the number of Europeans dying of AIDS. 
But the study carried out during a four-year period indicates the 
rate of infection continues to rise. Toby Murcott has the details. 
The number of AIDS- related deaths in Europe has dropped by 80 percent 
over the last four years. This dramatic reduction corresponds with 
the introduction of multi-drug cocktails of anti-viral drugs that 
slow the spread of the AIDS virus, HIV, in the body. A four-year study 
across 17 countries concludes that these drug cocktails have been 
very effective. Similarly encouraging results were found in the United 
States. But the anti-viral agents are toxic. They have major side 
effects and they're extremely expensive. Toby Murcott.
