Chilean Foreign Minister Hosea Mique Ensusa has urged the British 
government to allow his country's former military leader General Augusto 
Pinochet to return to Chile. He made the request at a meeting in London 
with his British counterpart Robin Cook. Here's the BBC's diplomatic 
correspondent Barnaby Mason. Mr. Cook explained that the next stage 
of the extradition process involved a decision by another minister, 
the home secretary Jack Straw, acting independently and without discussion 
with his colleagues. According to British law, Mr. Straw has the power 
to block extradition, but only on certain specific grounds. If he 
weren't to follow the rules, his decision might itself be challenged 
in the courts. Both the British and Chilean governments seem anxious 
to keep the emotional temperature down. Mr. Cook said they'd committed 
themselves to maintaining good relations. Barnaby Mason reporting.
