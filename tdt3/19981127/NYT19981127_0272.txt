The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency order on Friday 
requiring eight cargo airlines to change the way cargo doors are attached 
to old Boeing 727s that had been converted to freighter use. The aviation 
agency originally ordered the changes in 1991 after discovering that 
the 727 aircraft skin could develop hidden cracks at the point of 
attachment, but the FAA says the airlines ignored the request. It 
had given the airlines six years to do the work. Now the FAA has demanded 
that the cargo planes be inspected within the next 60 flights, and 
that repairs be done within 120 days or 250 flights. Most cargo jets 
make only one or two flights a day. Cracks in the skin can make a 
plane depressurize at high altitudes or even break up in flight, and 
aging aircraft bodies have become a growing concern as the jet era 
advances into its fifth decade, with many of the original planes still 
flying. The emergency order applies to 160 of the Boeing 727s, which 
began flying commercially in 1963. The repairs are expected to cost 
about $78,000 per plane and include replacing the rivets with stronger 
ones. Some passenger planes have suffered damage in flight because 
of cracks, but no cargo-plane accidents have been linked to the problem. 
The cargo doors swing up like the back gate on a minivan. The FAA 
found in 1991 that airlines were installing them by fastening a metal 
plate in the area as a reinforcement, a procedure that sometimes hid 
cracks and allowed them to grow. Some airlines put fabric between 
the plate and the skin, thus allowing moisture to collect and encouraging 
corrosion, the FAA said. But its inspectors only recently discovered 
that cargo airlines did not make the repairs on passenger 727s that 
were converted to cargo use. ``This is an odd one,'' said Diane Spitalieri, 
an agency spokeswoman. ``We're still investigating to see why everybody 
seemed to be noncompliant.'' Darlene Faquin, a spokeswoman for one 
of the cargo airlines, Fedex, said it had not ignored the 1991 order 
but had sought and received permission for a repair that did not include 
removing the metal plate. Now, Ms. Faquin said, it appeared that the 
permission was being rescinded. She said Fedex ``has the utmost confidence 
in the safety of our 727 fleet of cargo aircraft.'' She said the FAA 
would meet with Fedex and other cargo airlines next week to discuss 
the issue. Phone messages left at several other cargo airlines went 
unanswered Friday. But an official at one airline, speaking on the 
condition of anonymity, said the airlines had recently been meeting 
with the FAA and discussing what steps would constitute compliance 
with the 1991 order. The FAA said its order applied to Fedex, a unit 
of FDX Corp.; American International Airways; DHL Airways, a unit 
of DHL Worldwide Express; Evergreen International Aviation; Express 
One International; Kitty Hawk Air Cargo; Northern Air Cargo, and Ryan 
International Airlines.
