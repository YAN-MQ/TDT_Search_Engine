Some residents in chattanooga, Tennessee, are hoping the revival of 
an old shopping mall will rejuvenate their community's spirit. Natalie 
pawelski has the story. There's one like it in most American cities. 
A mall, once the hot place to shop, now half empty and struggling, 
unable to compete with the shiny new stores in the next ring of suburbia. 
Eastgate mall in chattanooga, Tennessee, is an unlikely place for 
a Renaissance. But that's what the neighbors have talked the mall's 
new owners into planning. There was a lot of affection for an area 
in this community that was, you know, it was a thriving area years 
ago, and they'd fallen on some tough times. So everybody wanted to 
see it come back to life. In addition to stores, plans include offices 
where 6,000 people would work, a day care center, a health club and 
a hiking trail to a nearby wetland. Inside, they're making way for 
an ice-skating rink. Outside, blank concrete walls are getting a warm 
brick facade. There are plans to run a sort of main street right through 
the middle of the mall, to take off part of the roof and create an 
open-air walkway lined with shops, offices and cafes. Then there is 
the spiritual side of resurrecting this old, dead mall. A nearby church, 
with roots here, in what used to be a Cherokee Indian mission, is 
planning to move back home to what is now the mall parking lot. We 
are an urban church involved in urban ministry, and that setting puts 
us right in the middle, literally, of the parking lot, yes, but also 
of the marketplace. What a wonderful place to engage in urban ministry 
from. Right where the action is. So it's past, future, tied together. 
Chattanooga is a city built on comebacks, from cleaning its air, once 
the worst in the nation, to bringing life back to a once-dead downtown. 
Now the city will see if that kind of renaissance spirit can fix a 
broken icon of suburbia. Natalie pawelski, CNN, chattanooga, Tennessee.
