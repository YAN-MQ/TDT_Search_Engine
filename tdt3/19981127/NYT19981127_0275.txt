As the German banking giant Deutsche Bank AG prepared to announce 
its $9.67 billion acquisition of the Bankers Trust Corp. on Monday 
in Frankfurt, employees and investors awaited word on several important 
issues. Chief among these issues is how many employees will be laid 
off as part of the transaction. Executives involved in the merger 
negotiations said administrative staff would be cut back to reduce 
overlapping back office functions. At the managerial and executive 
level, there are expected to be layoffs among Bankers Trust employees 
in Europe and Deutsche employees in the United States. Financing also 
remains unclear. In a statement earlier in the week, Deutsche and 
Bankers said the purchase would be in cash, but it was not clear whether 
Deutsche would dip into its own ample reserves to buy Bankers or seek 
other ways of raising the money. Deutsche Bank said Wednesday that 
it was not planning to sell its 12 percent ownership stake in DaimlerChrysler, 
the new company created by the merger of Daimler-Benz AG and the Chrysler 
Corp., to raise cash. Lawyers in the United States who are experts 
in American banking law said that the DaimlerChrysler holding would 
not pose regulatory problems for Deutsche in this country. While it 
is also known that a Deutsche executive, Josef Ackermann, and Bankers 
Trust's chairman, Frank Newman, will jointly oversee the new investment 
banking unit created by the merger, the structure and locations of 
the rest of the business are not yet clear. Both companies' boards 
have given preliminary approval to the merger. On Sunday the boards 
are expected to sign off on tax and legal issues that were resolved 
during the week. After the Bankers board votes on Sunday, Newman will 
fly to Frankfurt for the Deutsche board's vote. The transaction is 
the largest acquisition of an American financial institution by a 
foreign bank.
