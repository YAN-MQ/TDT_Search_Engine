Microsoft Corp. and China's Founder Group plan to cooperate to promote 
authorized software sales and fight the spread of copyright piracy 
in China, the companies announced Friday. Under the terms of a five-year 
agreement, Founder will develop an electronic publishing system and 
other applications based on Microsoft's Windows NT Server and BackOffice 
Server programs. Microsoft will offer marketing and technical support 
for these applications and supervise authenticity tests. Executives 
from both companies said stamping out software piracy is a prerequisite 
for the development of China's software industry. Executives from 
Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, did not provide specific 
figures on how much is lost each year from software piracy in China. 
``There is piracy in the U.S., but not as severe as China,'' said 
Pieter Knook, vice president of Microsoft's Far East region. ``It 
is clear that software piracy in China is damaging.'' Founder, one 
of China's leading software companies, said the company suffers anywhere 
from 40 million to 80 million yuan (dlrs 5 million to dlrs 10 million) 
each year in lost sales due to piracy. ``We want to build an environment 
where conditions are sustainable for software development and companies 
like Founder can get a return on their investment,'' Knook added. 
Business Software Alliance, a group that combats piracy, estimates 
that unlicensed software costs makers dlrs 1.5 billion in China each 
year. According to the alliance, almost 98 percent of all software 
installed in China is pirated. Founder Group has a Hong Kong-listed 
unit Founder (Hong Kong) Ltd. The group is primarily involved in creating 
publishing software for Chinese newspapers and magazines.
