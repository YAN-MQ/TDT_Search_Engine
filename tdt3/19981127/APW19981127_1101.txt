The heads of eight of Europe's most powerful stock exchanges expressed 
support Friday for creating a pan-European market, the company that 
runs France's stock market said. The Societe des Bourses Francaises, 
the SBF, which hosted a meeting of European stock exchange leaders 
in Paris, also said a stock alliance committee had been formed to 
advance the process of creating a single European stock market. ``The 
heads of the exchanges agreed on an agenda of further meetings and 
expressed their strong commitment for the continuation of the collective 
progress through the creation of an exchange alliance committee,'' 
a statement by the SBF said. The issues to be discussed at future 
meetings are expected to include the days on which a united exchange 
would operate, technology, harmonization of rules, the ways that stocks 
would be listed and valued. The Paris meeting came four months after 
the Frankfurt and London exchanges had announced plans for the creation 
of an Anglo-German market. The French criticized the Anglo-German 
plan at the time, but since then Paris has been seeking a way to get 
in on the proposed alliance between Frankfurt and London. At Friday's 
meeting, only the Stockholm exchange declined to join the stock alliance 
committee, a decision that was not a surprise. Even before the Paris 
gathering, OM Gruppen AB, which owns the Stockholm exchange had expressed 
skepticism about the new pan-European exchange, saying its profit-based 
corporate structure would not be compatible with the proposed European 
trading floor. ``The first meeting was very constructive and sets 
a good basis for further progress toward the common objective of creating 
an efficient and accessible pan-European market,'' the SBF statement 
said. In recent months, Paris and the smaller European exchanges have 
realized that they will be left out if they don't join the movement 
toward one big European market. The new European currency, the euro, 
which begins Jan. 1, 1999, has also been a major impetus toward the 
creation of a pan-European market. The talks Friday were attended 
by the heads of the exchanges of Paris, London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, 
Brussels, Milan, Madrid, Stockholm and Zurich. French Finance Minister 
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, at a briefing on Thursday, told reporters 
that the Paris Bourse, as the stock exchange here is known, will be 
joining the London-Frankfurt alliance that had been a thorn in France's 
side. A new European stock-market company could emerge as early as 
January, he said - a surprise announcement that left Paris Bourse 
officials, clearly not consulted, trying to water down the minister's 
remarks. The reaction reflected skepticism about cobbling together 
a pan-European stock exchange any time soon.
