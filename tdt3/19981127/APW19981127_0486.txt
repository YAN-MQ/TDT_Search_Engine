Italy's justice minister on Friday suggested resolving a diplomatic 
dispute over the fate of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan by setting 
up an international tribunal in Italy to try Ocalan. Both Germany 
and Turkey have issued arrest warrants for Ocalan, who is charged 
with terrorism. But Germany doesn't want him and Italy's laws prohibit 
it from extraditing someone to a country where they face the death 
penalty, as is the case with Ocalan in Turkey. This means Italy is 
stuck with the rebel leader and must decide whether to accept his 
request for political asylum. On Thursday, Italy's foreign minister 
contended Italy couldn't grant Ocalan asylum because he cannot be 
considered a victim of persecution. Premier Massimo D'Alema is still 
hopeful that Germany will ask for his extradition and says Italy won't 
make a decision on the asylum request until Dec. 22, when Germany's 
warrant expires. Germany has repeatedly said it won't seek extradition 
because the move is likely to spark violence between its 2 million 
Turks and 400,000 Kurds. Ocalan was arrested upon his arrival in Rome 
two weeks ago on a flight from Moscow. He was detained in a military 
hospital for a week and then transferred to a Rome villa where he 
is under police surveillance while he awaits a decision from the Interior 
Ministry on his asylum request. Turkey is furious over Italy's refusal 
to extradite Ocalan, its No. 1 fugitive, and has launched demonstrations 
and boycotts of Italian goods. On Thursday Turkey's caretaker government 
tuned down its tone and invited Italy's premier to attend a Champions 
League soccer game in Istanbul Wednesday. Justice Minister Oliviero 
Diliberto, member of a Communist party that wants to grant Ocalan 
asylum, was quoted in the Repubblica daily as saying an international 
tribunal ``would be an opportunity for Ocalan to explain his position 
to the entire international community.'' Diliberto said the European 
Union would oversee the tribunal to ``guarantee impartiality.'' Ocalan 
leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a 14-year-old 
war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey. The conflict has 
killed 37,000 people.
