JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Economic turmoil isn't just hard on the 
living in Indonesia. Two-thirds of the refrigeration units at the 
only Jakarta morgue that conducts autopsies have broken down, a newspaper 
reported Friday. And the cash-strapped government has no money to 
replace them. Only 10 of 28 units used to preserve corpses before 
post-mortem examinations are working, The Jakarta Post quoted morgue 
chief Mardiyono as saying Thursday. Even the working units at state 
Cipto Mangunkusomo General Hospital don't have enough power to bring 
the temperature down to freezing. Thermometers registered temperatures 
between 10 and 20 degrees Celsius, the Post said. Mardiyono urged 
the public to help buy new equipment for the morgue because the government 
was unable to set aside funds to replace the old units. ``Please help 
us,'' he said. ``The refrigeration system is badly needed here.'' 
He said the current refrigeration units had been installed between 
1978 and 1992. Autopsies are not common in the capital of 11 million 
people or in the rest of the country. The cost of an autopsy is beyond 
the means of most Indonesian families and there is little public awareness 
about the procedure. Many people in overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia 
also believe autopsies are disrespectful toward the dead. Indonesia 
is battling its worst economic crisis in decades. Many hospitals have 
been unable to buy expensive imported equipment, although international 
aid has partly alleviated the crisis.
