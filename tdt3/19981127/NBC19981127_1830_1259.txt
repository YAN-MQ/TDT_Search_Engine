And now, an update on a few of the "fleecing of America" stories we've 
reported on lately. Believe it or not, some of these situations do 
change for the better. NBC's Pat Dawson explains. Through flood after 
flood after flood -- See this mess. The federal government's disaster 
insurance program has been paying for people to rebuild in low-lying 
areas. We first told you about this $200 million a year "fleecing" 
back in january, about how some flood victims have filed more than 
a dozen claims, repeatedly rebuilding in the same flood-prone areas. 
Now, federal disaster relief officials say they will stem the tide 
of easy money. It's time to quit wasting money and rebuilding in high-risk 
areas. Now they'll impose a limit. After the second flood claim, the 
flow of federal dollars will be cut off in most cases. It's Nigerian 
mail that's been flooding the American postal system in a scam we 
told you about almost two years ago. And the letters keep coming from 
Nigeria, offering millions of dollars to americans for simply opening 
bank accounts and depositing money. About $100 million is what American 
citizens have invested in this type of scheme. Since our report aired, 
postal inspectors reached an agreement with the Nigerian government, 
allowing them to screen all mail that comes from that country. In 
the last six months, we've confiscated $2.3 million letters which 
were this fraud-type solicitation. But the scammers may still have 
the last word. Letters offering the same Nigerian business deal have 
started showing up here with postmarks from Ghana and Brazil. In September, 
we brought you the story of William McCorkle's TV infomercial promises. 
I want you too to discover the joys of having money. I mean this from 
all my heart. I can change your life. Federal prosecutors had charged 
him with mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. They said he 
made $28 million in five years selling videos and pamphlets on real 
estate deals that rarely paid off. Almost every representation in 
the infomercial turns out to be untrue. When a Florida jury convicted 
him November 5th on more than 80 counts, McCorkle collapsed in court. 
Now McCorkle and his wife each face a 20-year prison sentence for 
peddling a shortcut to riches that turned out to be a "fleecing of 
America." Pat Dawson, NBC news, New York.
