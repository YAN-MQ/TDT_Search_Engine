Cake, it's something good to eat, and its also - by chance - the name 
of an American Rock Band. Cake mixes - let me rephrase that - Cake, 
the rock band, mixes strange lyrics with trumpets and guitars. It's 
an acquired tastes, I suppose. But as VOA's Catherine Cole reports, 
you may want to hear their latest album if you are already a fan of 
the band's talking heads -- or bare-naked ladies? The new Cake album, 
"Prolonging the Magic" stays true to the formula that has made this 
band popular. The strong base lines, great trumpet solos, and quirky 
lyrics that you would expect are all here. "Satan is My Motor" is 
the first track on the CD. It is a scary title for a song that is 
full of good vibes. That is new from the band, Cake. It is called, 
"Satan is My Motor" off the album "Prolonging the Magic." And while 
it's true that the group hasn't changed sounds much since its first 
album a couple of years ago, they have evolved a bit with the departure 
of founding guitarist Greg Brown. On this CD, Cake has added some 
old-style country music to its long list of sounds. On the tunes, 
"When You Sleep" and "Mexico" the sound of a pedal steel guitar adds 
a new twist to the bands otherwise established sound. That's Cake 
with "Mexico" one of the cuts off of the new "Prolonging the Magic" 
CD. That tune features a pedal steel guitar which is a bit of a departure 
for the group. But this is a rock band that has always featured an 
unusual instrument or two. Check out the trumpet on "Sheep Go To Heaven" 
a song as silly as it is danceable. "Sheep Go To Heaven" is new for 
the band Cake. On this CD the band balances its many sounds with inventive 
and often crazy lyrics. Given the predictability of so many rock banks 
these days, this new Cake CD, "Prolonging the Magic" really stands 
out. I'm Catherine Cole .
