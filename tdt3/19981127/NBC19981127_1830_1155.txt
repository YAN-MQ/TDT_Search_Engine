Now to the reason why the U.S. hasn't put away those plans for a military 
strike against Iraq -- the ongoing and intensifying fight over documents 
the U.N. wants and Iraq doesn't want to give up. In fact, NBC news 
has new information tonight on Iraq's latest attempt to make sure 
those documents never get into the hands of the inspectors. NBC's 
Fred Francis joins us now from our Washington bureau. No one expects 
Iraq to come clean and hand over incriminating documents. In fact, 
NBC news has learned that Iraqi military commanders were told last 
week to destroy all records of chemical and biological weapons stockpiles. 
U.N. inspectors say they know there are hidden documents on -- Iraq 
says it never had the records but no knowledgeable source believes 
that. There are times the Iraqis give excuses that are so farceal 
they're wondering if they aren't sticking us in the eye. The U.N. 
inspectors have their own sharp stick. Next week, they will begin 
a series of intrusive, no-notice inspections, the kind of surprise 
visits to sensitive Iraqi sites that, in the past, have boiled over 
into military confrontation. Every time we close in on where Iraq 
is hiding these weapons or hiding evidence of these weapons, we get 
physically stopped, blocked by the iraqis. U.S. officials tell NBC 
news that if the inspectors and again leading to a showdown. So, this 
time next week, we should have compliance or another crisis.
