After a seven-year absence, Diego Maradona returned Friday to Italy 
_ and to the drug scandals that drove him from the country. Maradona 
stepped off the plane at Milan's airport wearing a scarf with the 
colors of Napoli, the team for which he was playing when he tested 
positive for cocaine in 1991. Dozens of fans waving the Napoli flag 
were there to greet him. Maradona is expected to talk in coming days 
with investigators examining possible doping in Italian soccer. Maradona 
also will demand financial compensation for an allegedly botched drug 
test taken during his playing days in Italy, his personal manager 
Guillermo Coppola says. The Italian lab that performed the test closed 
last month after accusations that it mishandled drug tests and their 
documentation. The closing came during a series of investigations 
into drug use in Italian soccer. Findings announced so far have cited 
only use of legal performance-enhancing supplements. It's not known 
how much money Maradona, 38, is seeking. A confessed cocaine addict, 
Maradona has always maintained his innocence in the 1991 suspension, 
saying he often took his own private tests before matches. He charged 
the suspension was revenge for Argentina's victory over Italy in the 
1990 World Cup semifinals. Maradona twice was suspended for 15 months 
for doping violations. The first for the positive cocaine test in 
April 1991, which was followed later that month by an arrest on cocaine 
charges in Buenos Aires. When the suspension expired, he refused to 
return to Napoli and was transfered, with heavy FIFA prodding, to 
Sevilla in the Spanish first division. He played less than a full 
season there before he returned the Argentine first division and Newell's 
Old Boys. At the 1994 World Cup, he was hit with his second doping 
suspension, this time for test positive to what FIFA called a ``cocktail'' 
of stimulants. When that suspension expired he attempted several comebacks 
with his old club, Boca Juniors _ and even coaching stints with Argentine 
clubs Deportivo Mandiyu and Racing, but never played more than occasionally.
