At least three people have been arrested in Cuba, following scuffles 
between dissidents and supporters of President Castro. The incidents 
occurred outside Havana courthouse, as the trial for independent journalist 
Mario Vierra was about to begin. July 18, 1999. He's accused of insulting 
a foreign ministry official in an article. Tom Gibb reports from Havana. 
A few dozen supports of the opposition journalist Mario Vierra shouted 
slogans and waved a Cuban flag as he prepared to go into the court. 
But the trouble quickly escalated when pro-government militants shouted 
insults back. Black-buried special police turned up with sirens wailing 
and hustled at least three anti-government protestors away, including 
a blind woman and a doctor. But the police ignored the government 
supporters who threw punches at their opponents and ripped the Cuban 
flag from them. Tom Gibb in Havana.
