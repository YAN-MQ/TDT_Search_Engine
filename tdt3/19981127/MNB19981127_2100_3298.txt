If there's a follow-up, we'll have it for you. That report from correspondent 
Steve Daniels and "dateline NBC." When we come back, a look at tomorrow 
morning's newspaper headlines. Nobody loves cars more than I do. Each 
one is a work of art. So when the maker of all of these chose a new 
antifreeze, it got my attention. General Motors now uses the dex-cool 
technology of havoline extended life antifreeze in virtually all its 
new vehicles. The same patented formula you can use in your car, for 
5 years or 150,000 miles. So do what GM did, switch to havoline. I 
use it in my car. I only wish this were it. Some Saturday morning 
papers around the country. In the "Washington times," this could be 
an enormous merger, the biggest of all time, mobil and E on are talking. 
Tough time for the oil business. Prices are falling. There could be 
some worry after Christmas spending the over in places like northern 
Virginia, Louisiana, where some of the employment centers are. "Miami 
Herald" an odd story out of the Vatican. The papal bull. The Pope 
is offering forgiveness for certain acts of penance as simple for 
individuals as giving up smoking or drinking for a day. Superfluous 
consumption, as he calls it, can lead to the forgiveness of minor 
sins. And dalings morning news, Ricky don't lose that number, Rick 
ki beats the record. He could make any professional team a pranchies. 
That was the run that put him over. He broke Tony dorsett's 20-year 
Mark. He finished 6,279 yards for his career as a college football 
player. Before we go here tonight, a program note from "dateline NBC," 
anchor stone Phillips. Thanks, Brian. One of the stories we're working 
on qur "weekend magazine." Picture yourself falling off a ship 200 
miles out to sea, no life vest, and no one knows you're missing. I 
found myself in the water twirling, twirling in the water, and I'd 
Bob up. Brian, that's coming up next. And that is our broadcast for 
this Friday evening. We hope to see you at this same time on Monday. 
I'm Brian Williams reporting tonight from NBC news headquarters in 
New York. o
