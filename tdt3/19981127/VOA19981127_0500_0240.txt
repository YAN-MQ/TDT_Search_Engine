Japanese Prime Minister Kasuo Obuchi has staked his political future 
on reviving Japan's economy. And in a speech to Parliament today, 
Mr. Obuchi said he would stake the fate of his cabinet on breaking 
the cycle of recession, and receiving clear economic growth in the 
next fiscal year. Parliament began today a special session to deliberate 
a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1998.
