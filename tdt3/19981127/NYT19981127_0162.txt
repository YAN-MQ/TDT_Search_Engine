MADISON, Wis. _ ``Wa-SKAHN-sin,'' Lorrie Moore said, articulating 
the syllables carefully, a lesson in local linguistics. ``What you 
do, instead of breaking the syllables between the S and the C, you 
break between the A _ not usually in Wisconsin, of course _ and the 
S. So it's W-A, then there's a break, and there's S-K-A, with a nasal 
A.'' She was entertaining herself, much the way the characters in 
her stories and novels often do, playing with words, turning them 
this way and that, being impossibly clever. In the stories, it's usually 
a sign of a character's nervousness or discomfort or sense of crisis. 
``An attempt to amuse in times of deep unamusement,'' is the author's 
description of the impulse. But Ms. Moore herself, a reluctantly transplanted 
New Yorker walking the campus of the University of Wisconsin here, 
where she has taught in the English department for 14 years, seemed 
genuinely amused: Look how well I've assimilated! ``I came here in 
the fall of 1984, and really, I thought `Uh-uh,''' she said. ``I was 
27, by far the youngest person in the department. Everybody then was 
living the life that I'm living now, where you go to bed at 9:30 because 
your kids get you up at 6:30. I actually like Madison now. It's hard 
for visitors, and it's hard for single people in their 20s. But it's 
a wonderful place to have a kid. When you start to have a little arthritis 
in the knees, it's easy to get around.'' Readers of Ms. Moore's books 
might recognize the good-humored resignation, the melancholic wit 
of such a speech. Her recently published collection, ``Birds of America'' 
(Alfred A. Knopf), which spent several surprising weeks on The New 
York Times best-seller list (surprising because literary short stories 
rarely attract sufficient numbers of readers), is full of passages 
like it. The Times' critic, Michiko Kakutani, among many who praised 
the book, called it ``at once sad and funny, lyrical and prickly,'' 
reaffirming not only ``Ms. Moore's virtuosic skills as a writer,'' 
but also attesting to ``the deepening emotional chiaroscuro of her 
wise and beguiling work.'' Ms. Moore's characters _ most, though not 
all, women _ share a sense that they have little control over life's 
circumstances; rather, they have arrived at a place they never expected 
to be and are engaged in making the best of it. They seem to be standing 
outside themselves, watching, in some disbelief, as their lives unfold. 
This often involves ironic observation, wordplay, ruefulness delivered 
with an arched eyebrow. And though the stories rarely involve the 
outdoors, and only occasionally make use of landscape, they are frequently 
set in the Midwest, or else concern people who live there. It's unintended, 
perhaps, but in Ms. Moore's stories, it's almost as if the middle 
of the country is where people go to be nonplussed. For example, in 
``Community Life,'' there is a Vermont librarian transplanted to the 
Midwest, who calms her unease about the strangeness of her surroundings 
and betrayals of her boyfriend, a local politician, by making up uninspired 
Tom Swifties (``This hotdog's awful,'' she said frankly.) In ``What 
You Want to Do Fine'', there are two men engaged in a love affair, 
one of them blind, the other divorced, who escape their odd home life 
by going on a meandering automobile journey. In ``Real Estate,'' the 
most intricately plotted story in the collection, there is Ruth, whose 
marriage is foundering, but who, scrabbling about for a clean start, 
goes house shopping with her husband, only to have her new home and 
yard invaded by bugs, crows, raccoons _ symbolic disturbances heralding 
tragedy. Even so, Ruth manages a quirky, sharp self-scrutiny. ``To 
avoid the chaos of the house entirely, Ruth took to going to matinees,'' 
Ms. Moore wrote. ``First-run movies, second-run _ she didn't care. 
Movies were the ultimate real estate; you stepped in and looked around 
and almost always bought. She was especially stirred by a movie she 
saw about a beautiful widow who fell in love with a space alien who 
had assumed human form -- the form of the woman's long lost husband! 
Eventually, however, the man had to go back to his real home, and 
an immense and amazing spaceship came to get him, landing in a nearby 
field. To Ruth, it seemed so sad and true, just like life; someone 
assumed the form of the great love of your life, only to reveal himself 
later as an alien who had to get on a spaceship and go back to his 
planet.'' Overall, the stories are sad, not depressing, and they make 
an implicit distinction: Life is grim; people don't have to be. Dark-haired 
and dark-eyed, with a thoughtful expression but a ready giggle, Ms. 
Moore, who is 41, has the look and demeanor of a pretty college girl 
grown up _ or maybe, in jeans and a pea-coat, a soccer mom, though 
her son is only 4, a little young for soccer. Her husband is a lawyer. 
They live in a house on Lake Wingra, ``the most feted'' of Madison's 
three lakes, she said, though that doesn't sound right. Lakes Monona 
and Mendota are larger, more central and better known. Feted? ``With 
an i,'' she said. Does she feel at home here? ``I feel like it's a 
luxury to think, `Where should I live?''' she said. ``It's such a 
luxurious thought. At some point you should just be occupied with 
the traumas and what's occurred; it's not so important where it's 
occurred.'' Indeed, she doesn't look out of place; she just sounds 
it. The repartee _ instinctive, clever, word-oriented _ is identifiably 
East Coast, maybe identifiably New York City, though she didn't live 
there until after college. She grew up in upstate New York, just north 
of Saratoga Springs, in Glens Falls, a town she used as the setting 
for her 1996 novel about a recollected girlhood, ``Who Will Run the 
Frog Hospital?'' Still, when she speaks of the differences between 
East and Midwest, it's with New York City in mind. ``Obviously New 
York is a very verbal culture, a culture of talking that has turned 
talking into an art form,'' she said. ``To speak in gross general 
terms, that's not really what's going on here. There's a sense of 
emotional theatricality in New York. Everything gets vented; your 
basic hostile encounter with a street vendor. That's threatening, 
alien to the Midwest.'' Of the general impression that people are 
just plain nicer here, she remarked: ``Well, there's a way in which 
niceness is a kind of hopelessness, too. It's not necessarily an expression 
of optimism.'' She paused. ``I get hate mail, you know?'' she said. 
``No one in New York would ever send me hate mail. It's not a lot, 
and I get some nice letters too, but I get hate mail here. They don't 
sign the letters. But I have a bad attitude about the Midwest, supposedly. 
There's a feeling running through their reading of my work that I'm 
insufficiently appreciative of the Midwest. ``Of course that's not 
a writer's task, to be appreciative. I wasn't commissioned by the 
Chamber of Commerce. And if you look at every single setting in every 
story, no place is particularly celebrated. But it's the Midwesterners 
who are upset by it.'' She laughed. ``It's all postmarked from Wisconsin,'' 
she said. Her father was an insurance executive, her mother was the 
school nurse. She was the second of four children. ``It was a very 
ordinary middle class household,'' she said, though she said her father 
wrote occasional short stories and composed music for the church choir. 
Both her parents write great letters, she said. ``Both my parents 
have a little of the writing gene in them,'' she said. ``The writing 
gene is just, like, dreaminess, isn't it?'' Ms. Moore graduated from 
St. Lawrence College, then moved to New York City, where she worked 
for two years as a paralegal. Then she went to graduate school at 
Cornell, where she studied with the novelist Alison Lurie and wrote 
a master's thesis that became her first book, the short story collection 
``Self Help.'' That was followed by a novel, ``Anagrams,'' and a tenure-track 
job offer in Madison. The first year, she was lonesome, overworked, 
miserable. ``They were kind and let me take a leave my second year,'' 
she said. ``I got a moving van and cleared out. I moved back to New 
York, and I had no foot left here at all, except that technically 
I had this job.'' That she floated back to Madison, drawn in a way 
that was almost beyond her control, is the kind of tale she tells 
on the page. In New York, she lived in an apartment on Ninth Avenue, 
across the street from the Port Authority. Buses lined up at night 
and spewed exhaust into her living room. The painfully funny existence 
of a struggling writer in Hell's Kitchen _ the protagonist, a male 
playwright, was tormented by the noise and stink of trucks _ showed 
up in a story, ``Vissi d'Arte,'' in her next collection, ``Like Life.'' 
In the meantime, she had begun returning to Madison one semester a 
year; it was during one such sojourn that she met her future husband, 
Mark Borns. ``What brought me back for good? I don't know,'' she said. 
``I guess at some point, there I was in New York, and the apartment 
was getting impossible. I was getting ill breathing these bus fumes. 
And I thought, `What am I doing? I have a boyfriend in Madison! And 
I can live so much better there.' So I came back here, in the summer 
of 1988. ``It was all, like, not knowing why you're doing anything 
except it doesn't make any sense what you're doing right now.'' She 
laughed out loud. ``It's a terrible story,'' she said.
