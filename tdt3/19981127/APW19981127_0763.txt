Prime Minister Radu Vasile fired Agriculture Minister Dinu Gavrilescu 
on Friday and said Gavrilescu would be replaced by the reform minister. 
``The premier decided to fire Gavrilescu because of continuous delays 
in agriculture reforms,'' said government spokesman Rasvan Popescu. 
Gavrilescu was appointed minister after reformists won elections in 
November 1996. He was one of the most controversial figures in the 
government, accused by media of mismanagement of state-owned farms, 
where tens of thousands of animals starved to death in 1997. He also 
failed to implement reforms that would have brought Romania badly 
needed loans for agriculture. Gavrilescu failed to speed up the modernization 
and privatization of state-owned farms. He also was accused of not 
supporting small- and medium-size entrepreneurs in the agriculture 
sector. And he failed to implement several programs supported by the 
World Bank. Romania was once the breadbasket of the region, but agriculture 
is vastly underfinanced. Farming is still done using animals instead 
of tractors. Vasile said he would replace Gavrilescu with Reform Minister 
Ioan Muresan. Muresan, 39, is an engineer who became reform minister 
in April. The Reform Ministry is responsible for coordinating privatization. 
The government recently announced it planned to reduce the number 
of ministries in a move to speed up privatization. There currently 
are 22 ministries, and several duplicate efforts, particularly in 
privatization. The government plans to eliminate five ministries. 
Among those to be abolished is the Reform Ministry, with responsibilities 
shifted to the prime minister. The reshuffle needs to be approved 
by President Emil Constantinescu. Over the past two years, the government 
has been divided by political feuds between the four political groupings. 
There have been numerous government reshuffles, which culminated with 
former Premier Victor Ciorbea resigning earlier this year.
