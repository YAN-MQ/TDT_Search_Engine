Prospects for quick construction of an American-backed oil pipeline 
from the Caspian Sea were set back further this week when a senior 
oil executive said the countries supporting it do not seem willing 
to help pay for it. ``We understand the political importance of this 
route,'' said the executive, John Leggate, who heads the consortium 
of oil companies that is considering pipeline routes. ``Nevertheless, 
not a single country supporting it has suggested it would participate 
in financing the project.'' Leggate did not name any countries, but 
the three through which the pipeline would pass are Azerbaijan, Georgia 
and Turkey. Clinton administration officials are lobbying hard for 
the route because it would favor American interests, but have concluded 
that it is politically impossible for them to subsidize it. They want 
Turkey to do so, and in recent weeks Turkey has offered concessions 
on taxes and transit fees. But Leggate's comments suggested that these 
concessions are far from enough. ``The difference between the cheaper 
and the most expensive options could be $500 million a year,'' he 
said Thursday at a news conference in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, 
where the Caspian Sea oil boom is centered. ``We will seek a route 
that will be profitable even at very low oil prices.'' The route favored 
by the United States would run from Baku to Ceyhan, Turkey, on the 
Mediterranean. Leggate said a pipeline along this route would cost 
$3.7 billion, compared with $1.8 billion for a shorter route to Georgia. 
He said the companies are also considering rebuilding an old but functioning 
pipeline to the Russian port at Novorossisk, which he estimated would 
cost $2.5 billion. Reports last month that oil companies were unwilling 
to recommend the Baku-Ceyhan route provoked a flurry of statements 
and trips to the Caspian region by Clinton administration officials. 
They insisted that the Baku-Ceyhan line is the best choice despite 
its cost. The United States favors this route because it passes through 
pro-American countries and would bind them closer to Western interests. 
It would also avoid Russia and Iran, which are promoting routes of 
their own. But oil companies say they cannot build such an expensive 
pipeline with their own resources. Leggate said the consortium would 
meet to consider various routes on Dec. 4 but probably would not make 
a final choice. He also said low oil prices had led the companies 
to delay at least six months a project to develop a new Caspian field 
known as Azeri-Chyrag-Guneshli. When asked if he was among executives 
who long for an end to American sanctions on Iran so they can build 
their main export pipeline there, Leggate said it was ``not appropriate'' 
for him to reply. The consortium includes American companies, and 
therefore cannot choose the Iran route as long as sanctions remain 
in place. It was probably Leggate's last public appearance for the 
consortium, the Azerbaijan International Operating Co. The consortium 
announced on Friday that he will be replaced on Jan. 1 by David Woodward, 
an engineer with British Petroleum, who is currently stationed in 
Moscow. The Clinton administration has staked much prestige on the 
Baku-Ceyhan project, but Leggate's statements were only the latest 
in a stream of warnings from executives and others that it does not 
yet make financial sense. Leaders of countries in the region signed 
a declaration last month pledging support for the project, but their 
pledge included no financial commitments and has evidently not altered 
the equation. ``In spite of their backing, the project does seem rather 
ill-starred,'' Jan R. Prins, a banker involved in financing large 
energy projects, told oil executives this month in London. ``Additional 
capital contributions or price guarantees are needed from those countries 
that attach such great political importance to this particular export 
route.''
