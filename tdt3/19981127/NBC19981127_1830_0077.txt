Good Friday to you. All across America tonight the retail Warriors 
are starting to arrive back home after a day of crowded malls, sale 
prices and remote parking spaces. While there's been a lot of talk 
about Internet shopping this year, from the looks of things, stores 
don't seem to be in immediate dangerer. All indications are, it is 
a blockbuster buying season now under way. This was the scene in Columbus, 
Ohio, Wal-Mart. Business is up 40% at this one store over last year. 
And let's check in Los Angeles where 100,000 shoppers were expected 
to arrive before the close of business today. NBC's Anne Thompson 
has an early look at today's take. In Columbus, Ohio, more than 300 
people wait outside Wal-Mart -- a record crowd. To start the holiday 
rush, in Dallas, they Sprint to toy stores in search of the elusive 
furby. In suburban Chicago, they crowd an outlet mall. Families like 
the douglases increasingly turn to discounters to stretch holiday 
budgets, a growing national trend. You can save a lot of money if 
you shop carefully. Despite a turbulent year on Wall Street, retailers 
on America's shopping streets are optimistic about this season. Experts 
predict sales will jump 5% to 8%, pushed by confident but cost-conscious 
consumers. Expectations show that people plan to spend even more this 
year than in the past. According to American express, southerners 
will spend the most, averaging a little over $1,000 per person. Midwesterners 
the least, just under $700. In the northeast, lifestyle gifts such 
as theater tickets and spa visits will be popular. Westerners won't 
spend the most on gifts, but will spend the most on travel -- $229 
on average. One of the hottest trends this season will be on-line 
shopping. Should we get that? One in four retailers now have sites 
on the Internet, about three times as many as two years ago. Baby 
gap and gap kids went on line this year. We are seeing consumers come 
on in fairly large numbers. And it really is probably driven more 
than anything by convenience. It's just a fast, efficient way to shop. 
And the old standby, the gift certificate, gets a '90s update from 
two Chicago-area women. They've created the swift gift card, to be 
used wherever Mastercard is accepted, sold in amounts from $25 to 
$100. We call ourselves a "global gift card," and, in essence, we 
really are. But even with all the new trends, it is still this old-fashioned 
word "sale" that consumers and retailers are counting on. And so far, 
it's working. Consumer confidence appears to be high, the economy 
is good. We're optistic. So much so, that this day that dra decisionally 
puts retailers in the black has a green glow as we head towards a 
white Christmas. Anne Thompson, NBC news, Chicago.
