Time now for the answer to our geography quiz. We are looking for 
a city in Central Japan on Honshu Island and the answer is Osaka. 
Now, as we said, just up the road from Osaka are the cities of Itama 
and Ikada, well-known major brewing centers for rice wine or sake. 
Today, 250 miles from Osaka in Tokyo, a festival is underway in which 
unrefined cloudy sake is offered to the Shinto gods. The history of 
this fine libation is similar in some ways to the history of deer. 
Back in the 16th century, sake was brewed at home. And as time passed, 
large companies developed, which have massed produced the wine. Today, 
though, Japanese are turning more frequently to micro-brewed sakes. 
Hiromi Yuchi of the Sake Service Institute, a New York distributor 
of sakes, says these sakes have an extraordinary variety of flavors. 
The higher class of sake, which is, um, polished rice, that creates 
the aroma. It may be melon or banana or apple. There is kind of like 
flavor, aroma. Mmm. Now if you think melon and banana are odd flavors 
for rice-based sake, consider this, you don't have to drink it warm, 
either. Though it's a habit, but it may be hard for Americans to break. 
Heating up the sake is very popular in the United States. That the 
reason why is that they started bringing the sake in, like, 25 years 
ago to the United States. And at that time, that quality of sake wasn't 
good. So by heating it up, they could cover the harshness. But the 
highly polished sake, which is like, bagging by of class, there is 
sake that you shouldn't heat it up. And it's not just drunk with sushi 
anymore. Grand-class sake is now appearing on wine lists right next 
to Poulinimon Frachet. Some of the, uh, the big famous French restaurants 
started carrying the sake in their menu. Sake could go with, uh, food 
very easily. Can it go with a good left-over turkey sandwich? yes. 
All right. Like, a white meat. It's really delicate. So, like, anything 
that's a delicate taste, like, um, tuna, pau-pau or any kind of raw 
fish, any kind of seafood. It's better than the white wine. Hirami 
Yuchi, uh, you do a very good job promoting your product and I have 
a feeling that you are doing it very sincerely. Thank you very much. 
Hirami Yuchi is with the Sake Service Institute, Incorporated in New 
York, a distributor of Japanese sake. Thanks again. Thank you very 
much.
