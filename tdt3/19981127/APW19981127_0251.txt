Oleg Blochin, once the star of Dynamo Kiev and the former Soviet national 
team, has taken over Greece's first-division soccer club AEK Athens, 
the club said Friday. Blochin, a Ukrainian, will be at AEK's helm 
until June 2000. The announcement did not disclose the financial terms 
of the contract. Blochin replaced Dragoslav Stepanovic, who was dismissed 
after coaching AEK for just four months. A series of bad performances 
led AEK's administration to fire the Serbian coach, but they may be 
forced to pay him a generous buy-out. The 46-year-old Blochin has 
coached other Greek teams such as Olympiakos Piraeus, PAOK Salonica 
and Ionikos Nikea. ``Time has come for AEK to gain a league title,'' 
Blochin told his players in his first meeting Thursday. The last time 
AEK won the title was 1994. It is presently in second place behind 
Panathinaikos Athens. Blochin, who was selected as Europe's top player 
in 1975, is the 21st coach for AEK since 1980.
