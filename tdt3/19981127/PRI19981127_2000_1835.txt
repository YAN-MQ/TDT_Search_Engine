Two of the world's-largest oil companies Exxon and Mobil have confirmed 
they are negotiating a merger. If the deal goes ahead, it would be 
the biggest ever merger of industrial companies. Here's "The World's 
David LeValley. No definitive agreement has yet been reached, but 
industry analysts say a merger of Exxon and Mobil would create the 
world's-largest petroleum giant, with a stock market value of about 
$237 billion. Such an enterprise would dwarf competitors like British 
Petroleum and Shell and could maneuver aggressively to capture key 
oil markets around the world. The merger talk comes at a time when 
crude oil prices are at their lowest in 25 years. Analysts say that 
could be driving Exxon and Mobil to try to create a super league of 
companies -- able to withstand lower earnings and higher operating 
costs. For "The World," I'm David LeValley.
