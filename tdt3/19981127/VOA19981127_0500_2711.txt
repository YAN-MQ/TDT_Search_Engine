Hello everyone and welcome to Science World. I'm Brian Sizlack. DNA 
analysis, the gene-screen that helps cops catch the bad guys is helping 
doctors predict which cancer patients will do best on chemotherapy. 
The case in question is a brain cancer called Anapestic Oligodendroglioma. 
This malignant tumor looks pretty much alike in all patients, but 
depending on its genome, one patients tumor might be much more vulnerable 
to chemotherapy drugs, then another patients. Researchers at Harvard 
Medical School, and Canada's London Regional Cancer in London, Ontario 
correlated genetic changes found in these tumors with their sensitivity 
to chemotherapy. Writing in the Journal of the US National Cancer 
Institute, the team reported that tumors with delicians, a certain 
genes on the short arm of chromosome number one, shrunk rapidly under 
chemotherapy. These patients also lived longer than patients whose 
tumors did not have the gene delicians. In the United States about 
1500 new cases of this particular brain cancer arise each year. The 
same gene analysis technique has also been applied to other cancers. 
And can help physicians and their patients determine whether chemotherapy 
is potentially beneficial and worth putting up with.
