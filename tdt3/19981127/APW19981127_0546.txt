A speeding motor boat with smugglers at the helm crashed into a dinghy 
filled with would-be immigrants Friday, killing at least three people, 
including a baby. Another four would-be immigrants were missing and 
feared dead. Ten others managed to swim to a nearby oil platform and 
were later taken ashore by the coast guard. Three of them were hospitalized, 
with one reportedly in serious condition. News reports said the immigrants 
were Albanians fleeing Kosovo, and had left from the Albanian port 
of Durres during the night. The accident occurred about 35 kilometers 
(22 miles) east of Brindisi, on Italy's southern coast. The smugglers, 
who were unhurt, sped away from the scene immediately after the collision, 
the reports said. Authorities also detained six men after finding 
some 250 kilograms (550 pounds) of marijuana and 30 kilograms (66 
pounds) of hashish aboard two dinghies abandoned by the group after 
a police chase. Also Friday, police blocked some 240 would-be immigrants 
who arrived on dinghies along the coastline of the Puglia region, 
at the heel of the Italian peninsula. Three smugglers caught driving 
immigrants to railway stations were arrested. Thousands of would-be 
immigrants fleeing persecution or war at home have reached Italy's 
shores in recent years. The immigrants, most of them Kurds, Northern 
Africans or Kosovo refugees, usually pay smugglers huge fees for the 
trip.
