Despite pressure from Italy, Germany will not extradite rebel Kurdish 
leader Abdullah Ocalan on terror charges for fear of sparking unrest 
among Germany's 2 million Turks _ about one-quarter of them Kurds, 
a government spokesman said Friday. Ocalan's fate was to be discussed 
at a meeting Friday between Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and the Italian 
Premier Massimo D'Alema. While Schroeder said Thursday he would not 
take a position on Ocalan until after the meeting, the spokesman said 
Germany remained opposed to the extradition. As the politicians spoke 
in Bonn, thousands of Turkish Kurds began gathering there for a rally 
supporting Ocalan, the leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, 
or PKK, which has fought a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey. 
The conflict has killed 37,000 people. Police expected 30,000 protesters 
on Friday, and Kurdish groups have announced protests for Sunday in 
several cities around Germany. Ocalan _ a fugitive from terror and 
murder charges in Turkey, where he faces the death penalty _ was arrested 
Nov. 12 when he arrived at the Rome airport aboard a flight from Moscow. 
A Rome court freed him last Friday, rejecting a Turkish warrant because 
Italian law forbids the extradition of suspects to countries where 
they face the death penalty. The decision enraged many in Turkey who 
consider Ocalan their most-wanted criminal. Protesters have burned 
Italian clothes and cars and launched boycotts against Italian products. 
For now, Ocalan is under police surveillance at a Rome villa. Judges 
have ordered him to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give Germany time 
to mull over extradition. Germany, as well as the other countries 
in the European Union, does not have the death penalty. Germany has 
two arrest warrants for the Kurdish rebel chief, one for a single 
murder charged in 1990 and another issued last weekend. German media 
reports say the new, broader charges include ``liquidation of a string 
of dissidents'' in Germany in the 1980s and a string of arson attacks 
in 1993. The attacks led Germany to ban the PKK as a terrorist group 
the same year. The head of the Kurdish Communities in Germany, Mehmet 
Tanriverdi, has asked the German government to help reach a political 
settlement in Turkey on the question of Kurdish autonomy. He also 
says Ocalan should be given asylum in Italy and be free to travel 
in Europe.
