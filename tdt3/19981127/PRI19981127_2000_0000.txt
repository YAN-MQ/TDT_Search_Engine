From Public Radio International, this is "The World," a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI, and WGBH Boston. It's Friday, November, 
27th. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, the deaths of two more Israeli soldiers 
in Southern Lebanon have politicians and their constituents in the 
Jewish state wondering how to get out of the Lebanese mud. Also, Indian 
drivers trade in their beloved tin boxes for some spiffy new foreign 
cars and we dial up the language of Quebec. First, this news.
