Pete Williams from the Washington bureau tonight with a thorough reading 
of what is more than 20 questions, four times that, 81. Lot more to 
tell you about as we continue this Friday night. After the break, 
our discussion with two members of the house Judiciary committee now 
that the president has answered the questions. Is anybody satisfied? 
Then the hand-to-hand combat that went on and is still going on in 
stores across the country. You don't want to get in their way. Is 
there anything that is going to stop a robust holiday retail season? 
And new information that may make for the next tense time between 
Iraq and the western world.
