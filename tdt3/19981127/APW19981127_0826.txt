Galatasaray's Romanian strikers on Friday assured Juventus players 
of their safety during next week's Champions League match, while police 
prevented anti-Italian protests to ease down tensions. ``Don't be 
afraid, come Zidane,'' said two Romanian strikers of Galatasaray, 
Gheorghe Popescu and Gheorge Hagi, in a joint statement published 
by the daily sports newspaper, Fanatik. ``We are your guarantee.'' 
Zidane and several other Juventus players have refused to play the 
match in Turkey because of anti-Italian sentiment running high in 
Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah 
Ocalan. ``We won't go to Istanbul. It's too risky,'' Zidane said. 
``I speak only for myself, but all of my teammates think the same 
way. Galatasaray-Juventus should be played in a country other than 
Turkey.'' UEFA already has moved the game originally slated for Wednesday, 
to Dec. 2. Reportedly Juventus was still seeking a neutral venue but 
Turkish police seem determined to reduce the tension and blocked a 
group of demonstrators from reaching the Italian consulate on Thursday. 
UEFA General-Secretary Gerhard Aigner said on Friday that UEFA stood 
by its decision that the match should take place in Turkey Dec. 2. 
After a meeting with Turkish soccer federation president Haluk Ulusoy, 
Aigner said the Turkish side had given all the guarantees necessary 
for the match to go ahead. He said UEFA would await final reports 
from Turkish security and police, but that the situation at the moment 
seemed satisfactory. ``We don't mix sport and politics,'' said Ulusoy. 
``We like soccer and we guarantee the match will be held in fair play. 
As president I will personally go to airport to welcome Juventus players 
and spectators. On the ground we need sports and nothing else but 
sports,'' he said. Police had tolerated violent protests over the 
past week around the country, where demonstrators set fire to a Fiat 
car, a motorbike and numerous Italian flags and silk, Italian-made 
ties. Sports Minister Yucel Seckiner has also invited his Italian 
counterpart Giovanna Melandri to attend the match. It was not clear 
if she would accept the invitation. ``We two sports people should 
not allow terrorism, the common enemy of our nations, to affect and 
tarnish the atmosphere of this match,'' Seckiner said. Galatasaray 
coach Fatih Terim challenged Juventus. ``We will play at home,'' said 
Terim. ``But if this not happens, we will topple them anywhere.'' 
Galatasaray has charged that the UEFA decision favored the Italian 
team. Reports suggested that the decision by soccer's European governing 
body allowed injured Juventus players time to get back into shape. 
Galatasaray has seven points in Group B, one behind Norway's Rosenborg. 
Juventus has four, but both teams have played one fewer game than 
the Norwegians. Meantime Terim is expected to fly to Italy to watch 
Juventus, which has reached the European Champions Cup final three 
straight times and won once, against Bologna over the weekend. Galatasaray's 
league match against Besiktas on Sunday has been postponed by the 
soccer federation. Italy objects to Ocalan's extradition as he faces 
death penalty in Turkey for capital crimes. Ocalan, who was arrested 
in Rome on Nov. 12, is the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party which 
has been waging a guerrilla war for autonomy in Turkey's southeast 
for 14 years. The conflict has claimed nearly 37,000 lives.
