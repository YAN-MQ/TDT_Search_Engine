President Boris Yeltsin dismissed Russia's top arms-trading official 
Friday and appointed a former KGB intelligence officer as its new 
chief, the Kremlin said. Yevgeny Ananyev, chief of the Rosvooruzheniye 
state arms-trading monopoly since August 1997, had long been rumored 
to be on his way out, blamed for a slump in Russia's weapons exports. 
Yeltsin fired Ananyev and replaced him with Georgy Rapota, a long-time 
aide to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, presidential press secretary 
Dmitry Yakushkin told a news conference Friday. According to the business 
daily Kommersant, Rapota, 54, graduated from Moscow Bauman Technical 
University and in 1966 joined the KGB. During Soviet times, he worked 
as a KGB spy in the United States and Finland, the newspaper said. 
Primakov, who in 1991-1996 headed Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, 
a KGB successor agency, appointed Rapota his deputy in 1993. Earlier 
this year, Rapota was appointed deputy secretary of the presidential 
security council, where he was in charge of monitoring nuclear and 
missile non-proliferation. Kommersant said Rapota's former colleagues 
extolled him as an ``intellectual who isn't afraid of making decisions.'' 
Rapota said Friday he would ensure the continuity of Rosvooruzheniye's 
work and observe all its obligations. He said he wasn't surprised 
by his appointment, because he had been approached about the job some 
time ago, the Interfax news agency reported.
