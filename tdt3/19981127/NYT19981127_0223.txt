NATIONAL FORECAST On Friday, a swath of energetic jet-stream winds, 
with speeds up to 195 mph, merged with the western flank of an upper-level 
low-pressure system off the California coast. As a result, the strengthened 
low will be a formidable system on Saturday as it moves into the southwest 
states. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will move across southern 
California early in the day as the cold core of the upper-level low 
moves overhead. Heavy snow is possible in the mountains east of Los 
Angeles. Showers and thunderstorms, a few with small hail, will spread 
east into Arizona as the upper-level low advances. Rain could be moderate 
to heavy in some places as tropical moisture carried by a jet stream 
originating east of Hawaii is drawn into the low's circulation. Rain 
will likely be heaviest on mountains, where lifting of moist air is 
amplified by the sloping terrain. Snow will fall at elevations above 
6,000 feet. Mountain snows and valley showers and thunderstorms will 
also develop in parts of southern Nevada and Utah. Unseasonable warmth 
will continue to build from the Front Range of the Rockies to the 
Plains, except for North Dakota and northern Minnesota, where chilly 
Canadian air makes inroads. Warm weather will also cover almost the 
entire eastern third of the nation. Vestiges of cold weather will 
be found in western Maine, where 3 to 5 inches of snow fell in the 
mountains late Thursday. Winds from the west-northwest averaging 15 
to 25 mph will detract from the mildness of the air across southern 
New England. Focus: Foggy Name Very dense fog shrouded the Texas coast 
early Friday. Meteorologists, who name fogs by the process by which 
they form, call such a mist an ``advection-radiation fog.'' Initially, 
moist air flows gently onshore from the Gulf of Mexico. In technical 
terms, moisture is ``advected'' or carried inland by weak onshore 
winds. Once inland, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico cools after 
sunset while in contact with cooling ground, setting the stage for 
water vapor to condense into fog. The ground cools because it loses 
more infrared radiation than it receives from a cloudless, nighttime 
atmosphere.
