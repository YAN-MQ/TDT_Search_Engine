A rebellion in northern Tajikistan earlier this month left 334 government 
troops and rebels dead and many more wounded _ including 170 civilians, 
officials said Friday. Immediately after the Nov. 4-9 fighting, led 
by a former army commander in the central Asian nation, the government 
said about 200 people were killed. On Friday, government officials 
in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital, told the Interfax news agency that 
114 government troops and 220 rebels were killed. They said 431 troops 
and 215 rebels were wounded, and 75 rebels were taken prisoner. At 
least 170 civilians were also wounded. The fighting cost Tajikistan's 
government 5.2 billion Tajik rubles (dlrs 5.2 million), the report 
said. Government troops crushed the rebellion after a few days of 
fierce fighting in the mountainous former Soviet republic, but the 
rebel leader, former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, and several of 
his fighters remain at large. They had demanded that President Emomali 
Rakhmonov free all political prisoners and bring his supporters into 
the government.
