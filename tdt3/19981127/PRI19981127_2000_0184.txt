Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cut short a European 
tour to deal with mounting concern at home over Lebanon. It follows 
the death of a number of Israeli soldiers in Israeli-occupied South 
Lebanon. Calls have been growing for Israel to pull out of the area 
and, in response, Mr. Netanyahu has indicated he'll consider the option. 
We've suffered the Lebanon. If we find a way to protect the north 
of our country and our allies in South Lebanon and, at the same time, 
reduce our presence in Lebanon, we'll consider that.
