Residents of towns near the Popocatepetl volcano on the outskirts 
of Mexico City were roused from their beds by an explosive emission 
of red-hot rock, civil defense officials reported. The brief eruption 
late Thursday tossed glowing rock as far as 2 miles (3 kilometers) 
from the crater and sent out a shock wave felt in towns 10 miles (15 
kms) or more from the peak, whose name means ``Smoking Mountain'' 
in the Aztec Indian language. ``It caused a lot of concern, since 
the blast was felt in towns and villages relatively far from the crater,'' 
Mexico state Civil Defense director Pedro Sesin said Friday. Television 
footage showed families sitting outside their homes shivering in the 
night air Thursday, nervously watching the volcano. ``The explosion 
was very intense but brief. It threw incandescent rock from two to 
three kilometers (one to two miles) from the crater,'' said Roberto 
Meli, director of the National Center for the Prevention of Disasters. 
``It illuminated the peak for several moments in a red glow.'' Several 
villages near the crater got a light dusting of volcanic ash, Sesin 
said. While a new plume of ash, gases and water vapor rose from the 
volcano Friday, experts said it had a relatively low ash content. 
Experts are worried about the apparently large column of lava building 
inside the 18,000-foot (5,490-meter) volcano only 50 miles (80 kms) 
southeast of Mexico City. ``We can't say whether the volcano has released 
its pressure, since there is apparently a very large amount of magma'' 
inside, Meli said. While the most likely outcome is another series 
of gas emissions or explosions, Meli estimates there is a 1-in-10 
chance that the volcano could erupt in lava flows. There is also a 
remote possibility _ about one chance in 100 _ that a much larger 
explosion could destroy part of the peak, Meli said. About 300,000 
people live on the mountain's slope and another 15 million live within 
50 miles (80 kms) of it. The volcano has been active since 1994, regularly 
emitting gas and steam. Meanwhile, the Colima volcano about 300 miles 
(480 kms) southwest of Mexico City showered ash on communities as 
far away as 13 miles (20 kms) from the peak, local media reported. 
That volcano, one of Mexico's most active, began erupting again earlier 
this month, forcing the evacuation of two nearby villages. The Colima 
Volcano or Volcan de Fuego _ ``The Volcano of Fire'' _ continues to 
emit a slow, semi-molten stream of lava that now reaches about a quarter 
of a mile (one-half kilometer) from the crater.
