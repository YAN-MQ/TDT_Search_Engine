A motor boat apparently driven by smugglers crashed into a dinghy 
filled with would-be immigrants Friday, killing at least two people. 
Another five would-be immigrants, including a small child, were missing 
and feared dead. Ten others managed to swim to a nearby oil platform 
and were later taken ashore by the coast guard. Three of them were 
hospitalized for exposure. Initial reports said the immigrants were 
Albanian, and had crossed the Mediterranean on their dinghy during 
the night. The accident occurred about 35 kilometers (22 miles) east 
of the southern port of Brindisi. The smugglers, who were unhurt, 
sped away from the scene immediately after the collision, the reports 
said. Also Friday, police blocked some 240 would-be immigrants who 
arrived on dinghies along the coastline of the Puglia region, at the 
heel of the Italian peninsula. Thousands of would-be immigrants fleeing 
persecution or war at home have reached Italy's shores in recent years. 
The immigrants, most of them Kurds, Northern Africans or Kosovo refugees, 
usually pay smugglers huge fees for the trip.
