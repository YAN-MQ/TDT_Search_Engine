Finally, you probably know that slipping some aspirin into water in 
a vase of cut flowers keeps the blooms fresher longer. Researchers 
at Arizona State University, in Tempe, have discovered the biology 
behind that old florist's trick. When plants are injured, like when 
their stems are cut, they make something-called jesmonic acid, which 
helps drive off predators. It also promotes aging of plant tissues. 
Aspirin inhibits jesmonic acid production, slowing down aging and 
keeping the flowers fresh long enough for you to bring them to your 
true love. Well, that's it for today. I'm Brian Sizlack inviting you 
to join me next time for another addition of Science World.
