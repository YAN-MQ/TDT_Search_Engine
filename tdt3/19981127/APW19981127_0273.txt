Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. on Friday reported higher net earnings 
for the first six months of the fiscal year, but predicted a fall 
in profit for the second half of the year. The group's net earnings 
in the first half of the fiscal year 1999, ending Sept. 30, rose to 
997.6 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 604 million), a 3.4 percent 
increase over the same period a year earlier. The telecommunications 
group said a worse outcome is expected in the second half of the year, 
ending with March 1999. ``The results of the group for the second 
half year are ... expected to be weaker. However, improved contributions 
are expected from overseas investments,'' it said. The group said 
its pretax profit dropped 6.6 percent to 1.24 billion Singapore dollars 
(dlrs 751 million) for the first half of fiscal 1999, while revenue 
was up 4.6 percent to 2.49 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.5 billion). 
SingTel added that a 10.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 6.3 billion) 
package of corporate cost cuts approved by the government this week 
will bring net savings and rebates of 65 million Singapore dollars 
(dlrs 39 million).
