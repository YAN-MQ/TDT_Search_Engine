The National Football League announced Friday that it would review 
one of the most bizarre incidents in pro football history, a coin 
flip apparently botched by game officials that led to the Detroit 
Lions' victory over the visiting Pittsburgh Steelers, 19-16, in overtime, 
before a national television audience on Thanksgiving Day. An NFL 
spokesman said the league was examining tapes of what happened before 
the overtime in what Steelers fullback Jerome Bettis called ``the 
weirdest game I have ever been involved with.'' Any review by the 
NFL would almost certainly include listening to tapes of the coin 
toss before overtime, an audio replay of sorts. Pittsburgh had a 13-3 
halftime lead, but the Lions tied the score at 16-16 late in the game, 
and that is where the game stood at the end of regulation. Steelers 
captain Bettis and safety Carnell Lake lined up for the coin toss 
and referee Phil Luckett asked who would make the call. Bettis said 
he would. As the coin was flipped Bettis distinctly said, ``Tails.'' 
That is what came up, but Luckett turned to the Lion captains and 
then, stunning the Steelers as well as millions watching the game 
on television, asked the Detroit players if they wished to kick off 
or receive. Even the Lions players appeared shocked; nevertheless, 
they elected to receive. They moved downfield and won the game on 
a 42-yard field goal by Jason Hanson 2 minutes 52 seconds into overtime. 
Pittsburgh never had the ball in the overtime. But the Steelers had 
a good deal to gripe about after the game. As he walked off the field, 
coach Bill Cowher hollered at the officials, blaming them for the 
loss. ``How can you blow the coin toss?'' linebacker Earl Holmes asked.
