Iraq says it will turn down any request by chief U.N. weapons inspector 
Richard Butler that is unrelated to disarmament or that jeopardizes 
the country's security. In a television interview broadcast late Thursday, 
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Baghdad also rejects 
the five conditions set by U.S. President Bill Clinton after calling 
off the Nov. 14 military strikes on Iraq. Sahhaf said the government 
is committed only to a U.N. resolution that links the removal of sanctions 
to a certification by U.N. weapons inspectors that Iraq is free of 
weapons of mass destruction. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq 
invaded Kuwait in 1990. ``This wretched person (Butler) now thinks 
he has the backing of the United States of America in accordance with 
the points raised by its president,'' Sahhaf said. Iraq evaded the 
military strikes by allowing the resumption of inspections by the 
United Nations Special Commission after a two-week hiatus. Sahhaf 
said Butler and the United States are mistaken if they believe Iraq's 
decision to cooperate s gives them the right to obtain ``a yes'' answer 
from Iraq to every demand. But Sahhaf was quick to add that Iraq is 
committed to cooperating with UNSCOM. Cooperation with the inspectors 
was one of the five conditions that Clinton laid out in calling off 
the strikes. Clinton also demanded that Iraq should provide UNSCOM 
all documents it needs. Soon after UNSCOM resumed its work in Iraq, 
Butler asked for papers that he says are related to Iraq's biological 
and chemical weapons programs. Iraq says most of the documents in 
question do not exist and those in its possession will not be handed 
over because they are part of its national security. ``Butler has 
resorted to a new ploy: that is the implementation of the points made 
by Clinton,'' Sahhaf said. He said a deal his government signed with 
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in February compels Butler and his 
inspectors to respect ``all of Iraq's national security concerns'' 
in addition to matters related to its sovereignty. The Feb. 23 pact 
opened presidential sites to the inspectors and had also averted U.S. 
and British air strikes. On Friday, more U.N. inspectors arrived in 
Baghdad as others went out on field trips to ensure that no illegal 
activities are taking place at suspected Iraqi weapons sites.
