A crazy ending in Detroit -- Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis called "tails" 
during the overtime coin toss, but referee Phil luckett insisted that 
bettis said "heads," and gave the ball to the lions, who won 19-16 
on a 42-yard Jason Hanson field goal. And what makes me mad is when 
you have and you fight and you scratch for 60 minutes out there, and 
then it's decided by people that wear striped shirts. Something wrong 
about that.
