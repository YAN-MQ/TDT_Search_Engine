The government announced plans Friday to cut taxes, part of its overall 
strategy of improving tax collections and pumping some life into the 
country's moribund economy. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told government 
officials that the value-added tax would be cut from 20 percent to 
14 percent in 1999, and the tax on profits would be cut from 35 percent 
to 30 percent. ``These measures help expand the base for taxation,'' 
the premier said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. He added 
that the VAT cut should be especially popular, since it will lower 
the cost of electricity and other consumer expenses. The tax cuts 
will serve as a foundation for the government's proposed 1999 budget, 
Primakov said. He said the government plans to cut the VAT further 
to 10 percent in 2000. Tax collection has been a major problem for 
the Russian government, and critics have long said the government 
encouraged tax cheating by setting its rates too high. As a result, 
the government has lacked money to pay wages, provide services and 
repay its debts. Some economists have said Russia's short-sighted 
tax policy helped set in motion the cash crunch that led the government 
to devalue the ruble and default on its foreign loans in August. Those 
actions set off a banking crisis that plunged the country into economic 
turmoil. ITAR-Tass reported Friday that Central Bank Chairman Viktor 
Gerashchenko will head a recently unveiled agency for restructuring 
the country's ailing banks. The state-controlled Agency for Restructuring 
Credit Organizations will issue stabilization credits and take over 
stakes in viable commercial banks that are scheduled for restructuring. 
It will also oversee liquidation of troubled banks that won't qualify 
for restructuring. Most Russian banks have been on the brink of bankruptcy 
or faced severe liquidity problems since the government defaulted 
on its treasury debt in August.
