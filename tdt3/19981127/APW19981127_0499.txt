All Olympic sports _ except for soccer, tennis and cycling _ agreed 
Friday to a package of measures aimed at unifying the fight against 
banned drugs. International sports federations endorsed a single Olympic 
medical code that calls for a minimum two-year suspension for athletes 
found guilty of taking steroids and other serious performance-enhancing 
drugs. The sanction for a second offense would be a life ban. In a 
significant move, the resolution adopted Friday said any federations 
which don't comply with the agreement could be dropped from the Olympics. 
FIFA, the governing body of soccer, expressed reservations about the 
two-year penalty on grounds that certain banned drugs have no performance-boosting 
benefits for soccer players. FIFA's acting secretary general, Michael 
Zen-Ruffinen, said he would refer the issue for consideration by the 
federation's governing board. FIFA, the International Tennis Federation 
and the International Cycling Union all objected to the resolution 
which threatens sports with expulsion from the Olympics if they don't 
comply. Soccer, cycling and tennis were the same three sports which 
failed to comply fully with previous IOC accords on harmonization 
of doping rules and sanctions. But IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
said he was confident the three federations would sign up to the agreement 
before the world anti-doping conference in Lausanne on Feb. 2-4. ``These 
three federations have reservations, but after consulting with their 
governing bodies, I'm sure they will agree,'' Samaranch said. ``I 
think all federations will remain on the Olympic program. The policy 
of the IOC is not to threaten the federations.'' Primo Nebiolo, president 
of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, proposed the last-minute 
addition of a clause requiring all federations to comply with the 
terms of the accord or else risk their Olympic status. The provision 
reads: ``The sports included on the program of the Olympic Games must 
be governed by international federations which agree to comply'' with 
the agreement. On othher key points, the federations: _ endorsed the 
creation of an independent anti-doping agency to coordinate the fight 
against drugs around the world _ called for cooperation on doping 
issues between sports bodies and government authorities _ pledged 
to intensify doping prevention policies through educational and promotional 
campaigns _ agreed to refer doping disputes to the Lausanne-based 
Court of Arbitration for Sport once internal appeals procedures had 
been exhausted The IOC called the meeting of 28 summer and seven winter 
federations to garner endorsement of common rules, procedures and 
sanctions. The IOC was intent on getting the federations to fall into 
line before the February doping summit. Previous IOC guidelines recommended 
a two-year ban as a maximum punishment. In some cases, different federations 
have applied different sanctions for the same offense. The international 
cycling union, whose sport was damaged by revelations of systematic 
doping during the Tour de France, voiced no objections to the two-year 
penalty during Friday's debate. But UCI president Hein Verbruggen 
said the penalty won't serve much use because it won't be accepted 
by the legal system. ``The rules have to be in line with what is acceptable 
to the courts,'' he said. ``If we go to the Court of Arbitration for 
Sport, they will never give two years. It's the priority of law. You 
have to look at the consequences.'' John Coates, president of the 
Australian Olympic Committee, said sports should be kicked out of 
the Olympics if they can't accept the common rules. ``I think athletes 
in each sport should get the same sanction for the same offense,'' 
he said. ``There should not be any flexibiliy in the two years, except 
for the possibility of additional penalties. If sports can't accept 
this, they don't deserve to be in the Olympic movement.'' On another 
key issue, the federations expressed support for establishment of 
a world anti-doping agency to spearhead out-of-competition controls 
and coordinate drug-testing research. IOC vice president Dick Pound, 
who heads the project, said the agency could be up and running early 
next year with initial funding of dlrs 25 million from Olympic television 
revenues.
