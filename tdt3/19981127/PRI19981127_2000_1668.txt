You're listening to "The World," and you can join us anytime on line 
at www.theworld.org. This is PRI, Public Radio International. I'm 
Tony Kahn. Ahead on "The World," Quebec's spirit of independence, 
it's a manner of speaking. The Friends of the Earth who refused to 
get into the holiday shopping spirit, foreign cars on Indian roads, 
and "Show Us the Way," a reggae hit in Jamaica that's a real sizzler. 
First, this news.
