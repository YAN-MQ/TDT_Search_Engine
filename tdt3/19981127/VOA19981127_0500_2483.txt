Recovery efforts are continuing at the sight of Thursday's devastating 
train wreck in northern India. VOA's New Delhi correspondent Douglas 
Backshun has an update. Two passenger trains were involved in the 
accident near Kana in the darkness of early morning, Thursday. A railway 
spokesman says the Golden Temple express heading for Amritzer derailed, 
and shortly afterwards the Calcutta-bound Sealda Express collided 
with the derailed cars. Police say the engine and several cars of 
one of the train crumpled on impact. Rescue workers cut through the 
wreckage with blowtorches to remove the bodies and survivors. Hundreds 
of local villagers helped police with rescue efforts. And shops and 
schools in Kana closed to mourn the dead. Traffic along northern train 
routes in Punjab was suspended to allow workers to clear the crash 
site. Railway officials have ordered an investigation into the tragedy. 
Analysts say accidents are common on India's massive rail network 
which spreads over 62,000 kilometers. Government figures show that 
hundreds of people have been killed in train accidents in the past 
few years. Railway spokesman Anno Saksanna says trains, which are 
the cheapest form of transportation in the country, carry millions 
of passengers a day.'' Indian railway is the second largest railway 
network in the world. And we are employing about 1.6 million people, 
and we carry over 11 million passengers and 1 million tons of freight 
every day. And we are running about 12,000 trains daily covering around 
7000 railway stations. One of India's worst train crashes ever occurred 
in August of 1995 when at least 350 people were killed as two trains 
collided in Otar Predesh, 200 kilometers from New Delhi. The accident 
was blamed on human error. Douglas Backshun, VOA News, New Delhi.
