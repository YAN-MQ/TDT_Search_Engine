Turkey's acting Prime Minister Mesad Mad has said Italy must hand 
over the Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan to the Turkish 
authorities. The move comes after German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder 
said his country will not seek Mr. Ocalan's extradition. Janet Barry 
reports from Berlin. Mr. Schroeder said it was a difficult decision, 
but added Germany had the largest Kurdish population in Europe and 
he said he was interested in protecting the peace. Mr. Schroeder said 
both he and the Italian Prime Minister would work to bring Mr. Ocalan 
to a European court. Around half a million Kurds and over two million 
Turks live in Germany and the German government is anxious to avoid 
the violence that erupted in 1993 when PKK members attacked Turkish 
targets. The BBC's Janet Barry in Berlin.
