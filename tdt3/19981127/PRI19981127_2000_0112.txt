German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder says Germany won't ask for the 
extradition of the Kurdish separatist leader Abdulla Ocalan who is 
being held in Italy. Mr. Schroeder said Germany had the largest Kurdish 
population in Europe and he wanted to protect the peace. An Italian 
court has already refused Turkish requests to extradite Mr. Ocalan, 
leading to tensions between the two countries.
