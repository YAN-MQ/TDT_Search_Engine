Daddy and the pet bunny rabbit had to stay home, but the rest of the 
Kissel family was waiting patiently Friday morning to see the new 
movie about Babe the talking pig, on one of the biggest family filmgoing 
days of the year. ``It's the biggest everything day,'' said Elena 
Kissel, who was holding Rosalie, 3, and standing with Siena, 10, and 
Lucy, 7, outside a theater on the Upper East Side, near their home. 
``We're avoiding shopping and Rockefeller Center, and went to the 
early show because we thought it wouldn't be as crowded,'' she added 
with a small sigh, looking at the already sizable line ahead of her, 
15 minutes before the 11 a.m. showing. Similar sighs echoed across 
the city and in malls all over the suburbs, as parents and their offspring 
mobbed theaters showing one or more of the three new must-see movies 
for munchkins. In addition to the porcine sequel ``Babe: Pig in the 
City,'' the current juvenile blockbusters include ``The Rugrats Movie'' 
and ``A Bug's Life.'' In Manhattan, many families avoided waiting 
in line by buying their tickets in advance through Moviefone, which 
estimates that by the end of the weekend it will have received 30 
percent more requests for information and tickets than it did for 
the same period last year, said Matt Blumberg, a vice president of 
the company. Going to the movies over this long weekend has become 
a holiday rite that ranks right up there with turkey leftovers for 
many families. ``Basically, all of these children want to see all 
of these big movies as soon as possible _ like the day after Thanksgiving,'' 
said Trish Lepre, the lone adult escorting six youngsters to ``Rugrats'' 
in Rye Brook, in Westchester. ``It's a ritual with them.'' This year, 
the unusual number of children's cinematic offerings is frustrating 
some parents, who are faced with either a moviegoing marathon or moping 
moppets. Doug Johnson, who was taking his two children and three of 
their small friends to see ``A Bug's Life'' in Park Slope, Brooklyn, 
said he wished all these movies hadn't opened at once. ``They should 
spread them out,'' he said. ``There's a market for more kids' movies, 
but up to a week ago there was nothing to see. Now there's too much 
and no time.'' But other parents seemed perfectly happy to sit through 
not just one, but two, or all three of these movies, even in a single 
day. ``This is so relaxing for me,'' said Gerri McKay-Kellett of Rumson, 
N.J., who was taking her 4-year-old daughter, Adele, first to see 
``Rugrats,'' then straight to ``Babe.'' (Adele is a Rugrats fan because, 
she explained, ``They play in the mud and get all gooey _ that's what 
I want to do.'') Robin Spalin limited her two children to just one 
movie on Friday, the newly restored version of the 1939 classic ``The 
Wizard of Oz.'' But Erika, 7, and Lars, 5, didn't seem to mind _ they 
were on their first visit from New Rochelle to Manhattan, including 
the next best thing to the Emerald City: the Empire State Building. 
``We'll see `Rugrats' over Christmas,'' Mom said. Peer pressure at 
school is part of the reason children insist they absolutely must 
spend a perfectly sunny day at the movies. ``Kids talk about movies 
at school,'' said Glenn Moody, 13, who was watching ``A Bug's Life'' 
with his sister Christine, 9, in Rye Brook. ``If you haven't seen 
it, you're out of the loop.'' Then there is the not-so-subtle pressure 
from advertising, tie-ins at fast-food restaurants and toy promotions. 
The longest lines in all Manhattan Friday were not at the movies, 
but at FAO Schwarz on Fifth Avenue, where a giant effigy of Babe and 
his friend Ferdinand the duck loomed over the entrance. Janet Gordon 
took her grandchildren Jordan and Lili Dworkin there first thing, 
before heading to the East Side to see the pig on screen. That way, 
Jordan (``I'm 5 and three-quarters'') could take his new stuffed Babe 
out of the box and hold it on his lap during the show. Eric Blohm, 
3, acquired his wind-up blue plastic bug in the course of a baby bacchanal: 
lunch at McDonald's with his mama, Anne Bellec, followed by a trip 
to the movies. Like many small children these days, Eric is something 
of a cineaste, having already seen Disney's ``Mulan'' last summer 
at a theater, along with countless videos at home. But the wide screen 
still has the power to impress even the most jaded small children, 
or at least those who attended a Friday afternoon showing of ``Rugrats 
'' in Manhattan. Though getting an exact count of an audience is difficult 
when many members are so small their heads do not clear the backs 
of their seats, it looked as if about 100 children sat through the 
screening with a minimum of squirming. Not that they were transfixed, 
exactly. The youngest members of the audience kept up the toddler's 
running interrogatory: ``Where are they going? What are they doing? 
Is that a monster, Mommy?'' Older children howled with the wolf, squawked 
with the monkeys and sang along with the babies. Adults were mostly 
quiet, except when asking, ``Does anybody have to blow their nose?'' 
in response to particularly loud sneezes. After the movie was over, 
David Cooper, 5, allowed that he had found some parts of the movie 
``a little scary,'' but his brother Jeremy and his friend Sammy Chipkin, 
both sophisticates of 9, said they thought it was funny. ``I liked 
the adventure,'' one said. ``I like the songs,'' the other said. All 
three called the movie ``really good.'' Naomi Cooper, the adult they 
had in tow, translated their comments into adult terms. ``Two thumbs 
up,'' she said. Later that day, the report from the Kissel household 
was that ``Babe'' had been a hit, at least with the two youngest viewers. 
But Siena, who once went to the same movie three times in two days, 
wants to see two more films this weekend, two that might be a bit 
over the heads of her siblings: ``The Waterboy'' and ``Pleasantville.''
