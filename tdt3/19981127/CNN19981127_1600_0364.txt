The Hunt is on for a death row inmate who escaped from a Texas prison 
this morning. One of the most secure prisons anywhere. Prison officials 
say convicted murderer Martin gurule and six other prisoners made 
dummies so it looked like they were asleep in their beds. Then they 
cut through a fence and hid on the roof. The six other men surrendered 
when a guard fired 18 to 20 shots. But gurule dodged the gunfire and 
jumped another fence. This is the first person that's ever breached 
the exterior wall of death row at Ellis. The last escape we had off 
of death row, I think, was back in the 1930s, and that involved somebody 
in the Bonnie and Clyde gang. The prison is outside Huntsville, Texas, 
65 miles north of Houston.
