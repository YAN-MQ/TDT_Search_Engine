One of the toughest things about holiday shopping can be finding something 
unique for those hard-to-please people on your list. In this edition 
of "tech trends," Rick Lockridge previews some of the year's hottest 
gadgets. With bright lights and jostling crowds, the holiday shopping 
season is upon us. And where better to find the latest high-tech toy 
for that gadget lover on your list than amid the bright lights and 
jostling crowds of the recent comdex computer convention in Las Vegas? 
My biggest "Gee whiz" is what I'm wearing. And this is the brand-new 
cellular phone from Motorola. And, oh, by the way, if you don't want 
to use it as a standard phone, it comes with a Jack so you can talk 
on the phone like this. And look like secret service -- And look like 
secret service or very ridiculous. This sharp mobilon tripad, one 
of the new ultraportable notebook devices, runs a slimmed-down version 
of windows. As you can see, you can use it in tablet mode, it can 
also be used in a Kind of a clamshell mode, as well as in an easel 
mode for presentations. And how about E-mail in your Christmas stocking? 
This is a great stocking stuffer because now you can have portable, 
affordable E-mail in a small, hand-held device that you use without 
any connectors. With sharp's telmail device, you don't need a computer 
to send and receive E-mail, just a phone. There's the confirmation 
Tone, and I've sent the message that I've prepared, and you can see 
now I have E-mail waiting to be read. This year's number one gadget 
gift for the family? I think if I were a family, the first purchase 
I would make would be for a Fairly good digital camera. There's no 
better way to capture the moment than to capture it in a camera, offload 
it to a PC, save it forever. With quality now rivaling .35 millimeter 
film and camera prices dropping dramatically, you can now create photo 
quality prints at home. Prices for these gadgets range from about 
$150 to $1,000. Rick Lockridge, CNN.
