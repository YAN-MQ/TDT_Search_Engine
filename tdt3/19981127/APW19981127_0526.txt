Inflation in Hungary will drop to single digits next year for the 
first time since 1987 unless Western European economic growth slows 
sharply, the chief central banker said Friday. ``This can come about 
if economic growth is 4 percent to 5 percent, and the current account 
deficit does not exceed 2 billion dollars,'' Gyoergy Suranyi said. 
Inflation for 1998 is predicted at around 15 percent. Suranyi said 
it's too early to consider phasing out the crawling-peg devaluation 
system for the Hungarian forint. Under the system, the central bank 
devalues the forint by 0.7 percent monthly, against currencies including 
the dollar and the German mark. Suranyi emphasized that Hungary needs 
to maintain strict monetary policy to encourage sustainable economic 
growth.
