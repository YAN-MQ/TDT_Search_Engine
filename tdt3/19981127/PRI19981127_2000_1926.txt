Olympic sporting federations have agreed on rules to curb the use 
of the drugs in sports. Under the proposal, a signal agency will test 
random drug samples. The BBC's Claire Dual reports from the conference 
in Switzerland. At the meeting, the International Olympic Committee 
almost managed to get total agreement from the Sporting Federation 
on a common plan to stamp out drugs in sport. The 35 winter and summer 
federations endorsed proposals for a world anti-doping agency to conduct 
random tests out of competition, as well as for a common medical code, 
clarifying which substances are banned. Most of them backed a minimum 
two-year suspension for athletes who take drugs, rising to a maximum 
life ban for a second offense. Claire Dual.
