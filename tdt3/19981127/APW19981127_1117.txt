A Puerto Rican was elected Friday as co-president of the Socialist 
International for Latin America and the Caribbean, in a vote that 
independence advocates hailed as a show of support for their cause. 
At a meeting in Geneva of the global organization representing 160 
social democratic parties, Sen. Ruben Berrios was chosen to replace 
former Dominican leader Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, said Fernando Martin, 
vice president of the Puerto Rican Independence Party that Berrios 
leads. Pena Gomez died of cancer in May. Martin said the election 
of Berrios ``constitutes a way of honoring and supporting the cause 
of our independence.'' He said it came at an important time, when 
the United States is reconsidering its relationship with the Caribbean 
island it conquered 100 years ago in the Spanish-American War. Puerto 
Ricans vote Dec. 13 on a referendum on whether they want to join the 
U.S. union, become independent or retain the commonwealth status that 
makes them a kind of colony of the United States. Though the vote 
is not binding, President Bill Clinton has asked the U.S. Congress 
to give the results serious consideration. In the last referendum 
in 1994, commonwealth narrowly beat out statehood and fewer than 5 
percent of votes went to independence. The Socialist International 
currently includes 13 of the 15 governing parties in Western Europe 
and those governing leading Latin America countries such as Mexico 
and Brazil.
