A surprising report on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's health shows 
moscow has been less than honest about his condition. More on that 
from Steve harrigan. In 1996, the official line from the Kremlin was 
that Boris yeltsin had a sore throat on the eve of the election. A 
few months later, the Kremlin admitted he'd had a heart attack. Now 
comes the admission he had several attacks during his election campaign. 
Boris Yeltsin went through a lot of pressure in 1996 when he suffered 
from several heart attacks. Naturally, all of that takes its toll. 
Yakushkin told CNN the heart attacks were minor. The official admission 
comes as no surprise to most Russians, who heard much the same thing 
on a television special weeks ago, which claimed yeltsin suffered 
five heart attacks during 1996. But the news comes at a time when 
Yeltsin is once again in the hospital, this time with pneumonia. And 
the presidential press service is struggling for credibility. They 
have undermined and, I think, destroyed their credibility to a large 
extent. So whatever they say may be true, but a lot of people will 
not believe it. With Yeltsin sidelined, his prime minister Yevgeny 
Primakov is handling most of the day-to-day running of the country. 
Kremlin officials insist the president is healthy enough to stay in 
office until his term ends in the year 2000. But there are signs some 
insiders are hedging their bets. Lately, because of the president's 
worsening health, Primakov replaced him at international meetings. 
And we know that. Our constitution provides for this. The president's 
spokesman told reporters, Yeltsin's temperature was normal and his 
condition satisfactory. There is no word yet on when Mr. Yeltsin is 
expected to be out of the hospital. But with the country in an economic 
crisis, patience is growing short with a part-time president. Steve 
harrigan, CNN, Moscow.
