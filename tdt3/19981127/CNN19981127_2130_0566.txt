Texas police are using tracking dogs and helicopters in their search 
for a Death row escapee outside of Huntsville. Martin gurule and six 
other convicts broke out of a prison there early this morning. The 
others have surrendered. Gurule is awaiting execution for killing 
two people during a robbery in 1992. Police say he's the first prisoner 
to escape Texas' death row since the days of Bonnie and Clyde.
