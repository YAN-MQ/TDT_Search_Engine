Shopping habits are changing. An Internet research firm finds consumers 
will spend twice as much money online this holiday season as compared 
to last year. Sean carr visits a mail order company that's gone into 
the computer age. The success of the clothing retailer J. crew was 
built on mail-order sales. Hi, this is Jenny with J. crew customer 
service. But mail order is labor intensive. During the holiday season, 
J. crew employs over 3,000 people to take orders and answer questions. 
Now, J. crew has a new way to peddle its barn jackets and khaki pants 
-- through the Internet. Instead of thousands of Ringing phones, they 
need only this. It literally goes from the customer's computer into 
our computer and into our distribution center. For well-established 
retailers like J. crew, having an Internet site can be an easy and 
cost-effective way to sell products and to advertise its brand name. 
But electronic commerce is not without its pitfalls or its critics. 
It's easy to sell some things, like CDs, books or Flowers. I think 
it gets more difficult when you start talking about things that have 
a tangible sensory quality. J. crew has an advantage in this new marketplace 
because they already have an identifiable brand name. It's kind of 
like, "build a field and they will come." Some say that works, even 
for small companies. The small businessman who's maybe a specialist 
in fly tying or makes some particular kind of very specialized fly 
Rod could actually be a player along with some of those better-known 
brand names. That's fine, experts say, until you can't find that small 
business and go with a name brand. States are balking at Internet 
commerce because they have no mechanism to enforce the collection 
of state sales taxes. Now with ordering over E-commerce, most of the 
forecasts indicate that that's going to reach around $300 billion 
in about four to five years. So the revenue loss to states at that 
particular point in time will be $15 billion to $20 billion. There 
are mixed reviews on exactly how lucrative Internet commerce is or 
will be. And most say the market has to be around a while longer before 
anyone will really know. Sean carr, CNN, lynchburg, Virginia.
