Certain diseases, tuberculosis for example are caused by bacteria 
that can hide out for long periods of time inside infected cells, 
evading the body's immune defenses. Now, researchers have discovered 
a one-two punch that can knock out these bacteria no matter where 
they are hiding. Writing in the Journal Science, a team from Boston's 
Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard University has highlighted 
the role of granuliasson a chemical warfare agent produced by killer-T 
cells, a type of white blood cell. But before granuliasson can do 
its lethal deed, the way must be prepared by another protein, perferon. 
Perforun, as the name implies, perforates the membranes of those cells 
that are providing sanctuary to the disease causing bacteria. Then 
the granuliasson released by the killer-T cell leaps through the cell 
membrane holes and zaps the bacteria where they are hiding. The researchers 
say that before they started studying grannuliasson, its function 
in fighting infection was unknown. Now they think their discovery 
could lead to new more effective treatments for diseases like TB, 
that are becoming increasingly resistant to conventional antibiotics.
