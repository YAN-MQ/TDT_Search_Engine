For Roman Catholics, the year 2000 offers early salvation. Pope John 
Paul II announced Friday that throughout the millennium celebration, 
penitents who do a charitable deed or give up cigarettes or alcohol 
for a day can earn an ``indulgence'' that will eliminate time in purgatory. 
Indulgences are an ancient form of church-granted amnesty that releases 
penitents from certain forms of punishment in this life or the next. 
The medieval church sold indulgences, a practice that drove Martin 
Luther to rebel, leading to the Reformation. They remain a source 
of theological debate between Protestants and Catholics, and since 
Vatican II, the Roman Catholic Church has played down their importance. 
Some liberal Catholics are embarrassed by a practice that seems to 
offer such a simplistic shortcut to salvation. But church officials 
emphasize that indulgences are linked to a sincere repentance and 
are not a one-day expedient. By restoring indulgences to so prominent 
a position, the pope is making penitence a theme of the millennium 
celebration. He is also reassuring conservatives in the church. But 
by broadening the ways believers can earn an indulgence, the pope 
is also trying to imbue indulgences with some of the ecumenical spirit 
he wants to give the celebrations. In a papal bull titled ``Incarnationis 
Mysterium'' (The Mystery of the Incarnation) that will be formally 
issued on Sunday, John Paul formally proclaimed the year 2000 a Holy 
Year, and issued edicts that in many ways serve as a practical guide 
to spiritual salvation during the period. He decreed that the jubilee 
would begin on Christmas Day 1999 and end on the Feast of the Epiphany, 
Jan. 6, 2001. Parts of the papal document dealt with collective penitence. 
The pope asked Catholics to seek forgiveness for past historical errors 
during the Jubilee. He also asked rich nations to ease or substantially 
eliminate Third World debt. The pope said individual sinners would 
be granted ``plenary indulgences,'' a full pardon for sins as opposed 
to a shortening of the time spent in purgatory. In Catholic theology, 
souls in purgatory are purifying themselves before their entry into 
heaven. He included personal acts of penitence or local charity work 
as a way of earning an indulgence. Throughout the period, believers 
will be offered a wider selection of ways to receive a plenary indulgence. 
They may follow tradition and attend a mass in one of several designated 
churches and perform such devotions as the rosary or the stations 
of the cross. Or, an appendix to the pope's letter explains, they 
may visit the sick, the imprisoned or the handicapped, or give to 
the poor. Or they may choose an act of private sacrifice. As the appendix, 
signed by Cardinal William Baum, a top Vatican official, explained, 
``This would include abstaining for at least one whole day from unnecessary 
consumption (e.g from smoking, or alcohol, or fasting). The text points 
out that sinners must also fulfill the ``usual spiritual and sacramental 
conditions'' and say the ``usual prayers.'' Archbishop Crescenzio 
Sepe, a top official in the Vatican's committee of the Great Jubilee 
of the year 2000, said, ``One could be tempted to think `today I won't 
smoke or I won't drink wine. I'll get a plenary indulgence and go 
to paradise.' '' That, he said would be wrong. ``That would not be 
the spirit of an indulgence, that would be off-beam, like returning 
to the thinking of the Middle Ages.'' Indulgences are not one-day 
expedients, Sepe said, but he did not make light of brief sacrifices. 
``It's not so easy for some to give up smoking for a day,'' he said 
pensively. ``It might be easier to visit a prison inmate.'' The pope's 
decision to expand the use of indulgences during the millennium celebration 
is not entirely surprising. In 1985, the pope revealed his respect 
for the practice by allowing Catholics to receive indulgences via 
television. Believers who followed a church service where an indulgence 
was granted on television or radio could be included _ as long as 
they fulfilled the same conditions as those physically present for 
the service, including confession, communion and prayer. But indulgences, 
which began in early Christian times, have not always been viewed 
favorably. In the 16th century, Pope Julius II offered indulgences 
in exchange for contributions to build St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. 
Martin Luther protested, and was excommunicated in 1521. The Church 
later banned the sale of indulgences, but the Vatican reaffirmed their 
religious importance at the Council of Trent in 1563. In 1968, Pope 
Paul VI also elaborated on the subject. Including indulgences in the 
2000 Jubilee ``could not be avoided,'' said the Rev. Jared Wicks, 
a theologian at the Gregorian University in Rome. ``Conservative Catholics 
would find it intolerable that, for ecumenical considerations, the 
Church put into the closet a practice affirmed by the Council of Trent.'' 
Wicks added with a laugh, ``And John Paul II is not one to do anything 
like that.''
