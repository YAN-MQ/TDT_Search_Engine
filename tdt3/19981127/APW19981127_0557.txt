More than a dozen supporters of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan 
ended a nearly two-week hunger strike Friday, a Kurdish spokesman 
said. The hunger strike was called off to coincide with the 20th anniversary 
of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a battle 
for autonomy in southeastern Turkey, said Rojhat Laser, a representative 
of the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan, the PKK's political 
wing. The protesters gathered in a central Athens square after Ocalan's 
Nov. 12 arrest in Rome. Turkey is demanding Ocalan's extradition from 
Italy, where he is seeking political asylum. The PKK supporters began 
the hunger strike Nov. 14 to oppose the extradition request. Nearly 
37,000 people have been killed in fighting between Turkish forces 
and Kurdish rebels since 1984.
