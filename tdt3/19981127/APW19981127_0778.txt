Galatasaray's Romanian strikers on Friday assured Juventus players 
of their safety during next week's Champions League match, while police 
prevented anti-Italian protests to ease down tensions. ``Don't be 
afraid, come Zidane,'' said two Romanian strikers of Galatasaray, 
Gheorghe Popescu and Gheorge Hagi, in a joint statement published 
by the daily sports newspaper, Fanatik. ``We are your guarantee.'' 
Zidane and several other Juventus players have refused to play the 
match in Turkey because of anti-Italian sentiment running high in 
Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah 
Ocalan. ``We won't go to Istanbul. It's too risky,'' Zidane said. 
``I speak only for myself, but all of my teammates think the same 
way. Galatasaray-Juventus should be played in a country other than 
Turkey.'' UEFA already has moved the game originally slated for Wednesday, 
to Dec. 2. Reportedly Juventus was still seeking a neutral venue but 
Turkish police seem determined to reduce the tension and blocked a 
group of demonstrators from reaching the Italian consulate on Thursday. 
On Friday, Turkey's sports minister Yucel Seckiner said that Lennart 
Johansson, president of UEFA, assured Turkish officials that the game 
would be played in Istanbul next Wednesday. ``I invite our people 
to behave with a common sense,'' the Anatolia news agency quoted Seckiner 
as saying. Police had tolerated violent protests over the past week 
around the country, where demonstrators set fire to a Fiat car, a 
motorbike and numerous Italian flags and silk, Italian-made ties. 
Seckiner has also invited his Italian counterpart Giovanna Melandri 
to attend the match. It was not clear if she would accept the invitation. 
``We two sports people should not allow terrorism, the common enemy 
of our nations, to affect and tarnish the atmosphere of this match,'' 
Seckiner said. Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim challenged Juventus. 
``We will play at home,'' said Terim. ``But if this not happens, we 
will topple them anywhere.'' Galatasaray has, 11th graf pvs
