Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish 
Republican Army, will be allowed to visit Australia in January. Australian 
Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock refused Adams a visa in 1996 
citing his association with the Irish Republican Army. The IRA had 
resumed its terror campaign in Britain at the time. Ruddock said Friday 
his department has now granted Adams a visa, following the significant 
advances toward achieving peace in the troubled British province. 
``Australia looks to Mr. Adams and to Sinn Fein to shoulder their 
full responsibility with all other parties to ensure rapid progress 
in the peace process,'' Ruddock said. In a statement, Adams welcomed 
the decision and said he would visit in the new year,'' Adams. The 
statement said Adams planned ``to promote internationally and to the 
substantial Irish community in Australia the need for the speedy and 
full implementation of the Good Friday peace agreement.'' It said 
Adams would likely stay in Australia for at least a week. Irish community 
leader Dennis O'Flynn welcomed the decision, noting that Adams had 
already been received in the White House and is also accepted in Britain.
