When we come back, the situation on the ground in Seattle, Washington, 
tonight after a loaded city bus has pludged off a bridge and into 
an apartment building there. We'll have a late report coming up. Mud 
holes. Dirt roads. Most people wouldn't think of driving through stuff 
like that. But then, that's the beauty of Subaru all-wheel drive. 
It automatically transfers power from the wheels that slip to the 
wheels that grip. Which means it does the thinking for you. Sorry 
mate... guess I wasn't Thinkin'.
