It's a somber Thanksgiving weekend for some American families who 
lost loved ones when Swissair flight 111 crashed off Nova Scotia. 
They will return to the crash scene Friday to remember those who died. 
Search operations are also resuming in the waters off Peggy's cove. 
Searchers began dragging the bottom again this week in hopes of recovering 
more pieces of the downed MD-11 jetliner. All 229 people aboard the 
aircraft were killed when it plunged into the sea in September.
