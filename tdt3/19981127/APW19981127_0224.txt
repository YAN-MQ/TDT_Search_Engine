An ultra-Orthodox rabbi working in a provincial town in Russia to 
bring Jews closer to their heritage was severely beaten up by skin 
heads, the daily Haaretz said Friday. Rabbi Zalman Yaffo was attacked 
last month by three skin heads as he was leaving his home in Nizhniy 
Novgorod, about 250 miles (400 km) east of Moscow, the paper said. 
Yaffo, the representative of the ultra-Orthodox movement Habad in 
the area, was hospitalized for a day because of the beating, Haaretz 
said. Habad officials and Israeli and other Jewish representatives 
kept the incident quiet for over a month, the paper said. Rabbi Berl 
Lazar, a Habad representative in Russia, told the paper that the beating 
was an isolated incident and that ``media hype about anti-Semitic 
utterances only heightens the danger.'' Lazar also told Haaretz that 
the 100 Habad representatives in the former Soviet Union had been 
told to exercise caution after the May bombing of a Moscow Habad synagogue. 
``We are being more careful than ever not to stand out and not to 
attract attention,'' Lazar told Haaretz. Habad has a successful program 
of bringing non-observant Jews back to religious practice. The police 
investigation of the attack is continuing, but the assailants have 
not been apprehended, Haaretz said. The report followed other incidents 
of anti-Semitism in Russia. Parliament member General Albert Makashov 
last month blamed Russia's troubles on ``zhidy,'' a derogatory term 
for Jews. Duma member Galina Starovoitova, who led a campaign to censure 
him for remarks, was killed last Friday by unknown assailants.
