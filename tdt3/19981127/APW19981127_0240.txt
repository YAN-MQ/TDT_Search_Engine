Myanmar officials have confirmed that an American is one of three 
foreigners detained after illegally crossing into the country from 
Thailand, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said Friday. A Myanmar government 
official told The Associated Press on Thursday that the trio were 
found inside Myanmar's territory last week without legal permission 
and had been brought to Taunggyi, about 175 kilometers (110 miles) 
from where they were detained. The three were identified by a Thai 
military intelligence officer who monitors the border as U.S. citizen 
Michael John Raedeke, 40; a Canadian resident of Hong Kong, Joseph 
Frank, 34; and Dirk Rommeswinkel of Germany. The spokesman for the 
U.S. Embassy here, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said 
the embassy had made inquiries with Myanmar's foreign ministry after 
hearing reports about the foreigners from another embassy. ``We have 
been officially informed that an American was among the three picked 
up and they are now in Taunggyi,'' she said. ``We will continue to 
work to get consular access.'' The German Embassy and the Australian 
embassy, which looks after Canadian affairs in Myanmar, were unavailable 
for comment. The three foreigners were seen riding rented motorcycles 
in the rugged border region around Thailand's western Mae Hong Son 
province last week. Thai troops saw them drive across the frontier 
at Ban Mai Kai On Pass but were unable to get their attention. Myanmar, 
also known as Burma, is governed by the military and has strict security 
measures in the border regions. Armed rebel groups have been active 
in some areas.
