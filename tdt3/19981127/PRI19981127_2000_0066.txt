For "The World," this is Alan Dow in the BBC Newsroom in London. President 
Clinton has responded in writing to questions from the House Judiciary 
Committee, which is considering impeaching him over the Monica Lewinsky 
Affair. With the details, here's the BBC's Nick Bryant in Washington. 
President Clinton spent much of his two-day break at Camp David, considering 
his response to these 81 questions. Republicans on the House Judiciary 
Committee had asked him to clarify certain aspects of his testimony 
before a grand jury in August and his public denials of wrongdoing 
over the Monica Lewinsky affair. But the president has reasserted 
that his testimony was neither false nor misleading. Nonetheless, 
articles of impeachment are now being drafted. A committee vote on 
these charges is expected within the next three weeks. Nick Bryant 
reporting from Washington.
