An Iraqi dissident denied Friday that he has been singled out by America 
as a potential leader of a campaign to oust Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein. Adnan Al-Pachachi said the claim, made by Iraqi exiles earlier 
this week, was ``an outrageous lie'' designed to embarrass him and 
weaken his standing among the Iraqi people. Iraqi exiles had said 
that, in a meeting with representatives of 16 Iraqi opposition groups 
in London on Tuesday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk 
had proposed that Al-Pachachi lead the initiative to oust Saddam. 
``Nothing of the kind has happened. Mr. Indyk has never said anything 
of the kind,'' Al-Pachachi said. A State department official said 
Friday that it was up to the Iraqis to organize themselves and that 
it was not for the United States to decide who should lead them. ``That 
is not what the role of the United States is in this process,'' said 
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We can neither 
appoint nor anoint.'' In a telephone interview with The Associated 
Press bureau in Cairo on Wednesday, Al-Pachachi did not deny that 
Indyk had proposed him to reconstruct the fragmented Iraqi opposition 
in exile. He told the AP: ``I think this is our last chance and we 
should not lose it.'' Al-Pachachi said Friday that he had acted as 
informal chair of discussions among the Iraqis when Indyk had left 
the room to permit a free discussion. The claim that Indyk proposed 
him as leader of a new opposition platform was ``malicious,'' he said. 
``It seems to me the object of which was to embarrass me and perhaps 
to weaken my standing among the Iraqi people _ and perhaps to weaken 
any claim I may have, which I don't have at all,'' Al-Pachachi said. 
He said he has no ambition to lead the Iraqi opposition, would not 
accept any nomination and that he is working to secure a change of 
regime in Iraq out a sense of ``duty.'' U.S. President Bill Clinton 
has proclaimed that Saddam's ouster is a major U.S. goal in efforts 
to protect U.S. interests in the region. The U.S. Congress has allocated 
dlrs 97 million aid for Iraqi dissidents. ``My own impression was 
that the United States was not thinking in terms of military operations 
conducted by Iraqis in Iraq,'' he said. ``But rather that, in the 
foreseeable future, the emphasis would be on political, diplomatic 
and public relations efforts to undermine the regime of Iraq and bring 
about change.'' Al-Pachachi said such an approach would demand a ``unified 
and coherent Iraqi opposition'' and that the groups assured Indyk 
they would find ways to unify what is now a fragmented and divided 
opposition that lacks credibility. Al-Pachachi was the foreign minister 
in the government that was toppled in the 1968 military coup that 
brought Saddam's Baath party to power. He later became a political 
adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates. He has been 
involved in opposition efforts to topple Saddam since the end of the 
1991 Gulf War and is widely respected among Iraq exiles.
