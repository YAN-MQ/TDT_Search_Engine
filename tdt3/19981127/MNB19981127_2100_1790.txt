You've heard of miracle on 34th street. How about escalator lock on 
34th street? That is the world's largest department story, Macy's 
in New York. They were wearing out the carpet and the cash registers 
today as New Yorkers and visit to bes to the city flocked to the big 
apple. Here in New York, west to L.A., daybreak saw people standing 
in line outside stores that were yet to open, signaling the buying 
season is under way, fueled by a robust economy, at least so far. 
Retailers are watching this one closely. Rick Davis with us from the 
Newport centre mall in Jersey city, New Jersey. Rick, good evening. 
Good evening, Brian. This was never a day of great expectations, just 
a day of good expectations. One of the store managers here told me 
that things were looking good. Indeed, they are. Some stores, very 
good, others, just so-so. They were milling around all three floors 
of Newport center from the early hours of the morning. Some were here 
long before the stores opened. They lined up outside the toy store 
searching for furbies, the hot item of the year. They sold out an 
hour after the mall opened. Very disappointed. Did you show up too 
late? no. I showed up at 5:30. And they were all sold out? All sold 
out. From the way the money was changing hands and the weight of the 
shopping bags going out, it was a good day to be in the toy business. 
We're here. Economic analysts say many stores do 50% to 60% of their 
business for the year during the three months around the Christmas 
season. So, this can be a make or break time in the selling game. 
And at Sears, the game was going well. Business today was fantastic 
for the season. The watch phrase is cautious optimism. For the first 
four hours this morning we had one of the best turnouts from customers 
we've ever seen. We tracked the traffic, and it was up 42% over last 
year. But the buying pattern is a little different this year. It's 
things the whole family can enjoy -- computers, computer games, home 
entertainment centers. Those are the high-priced items selling big 
this year. But not all the stores are doing well, hurt by catalog 
sales, buying on the Internet, and ht badly by discount stores and 
outlet malls. The prices are better, less expensive, and you're receiving 
more of a discount than in a large shopping mall. Luckily, not everyone 
feels that way. Overall, it was a pretty good day here at the Newport 
center, business up about 3% over the last year. And that's just about 
what most business analysts thought it would be, up about 3%. Some 
optimists said maybe 6% of an increase. It means Americans will be 
spending about $170 to $174 billion this year over the holidays. Rick 
Davis, where they're still arriving at this late hour.
