While Pete Sampras savored his historic achievement, Carlos Moya and 
Alex Corretja joined Sampras and Tim Henman Friday in the semifinals 
of the ATP Tour World Championship. Moya, The French Open champion 
who had not won an indoor match all year until this week, reached 
the semifinals by beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov 7-5, 7-5. Corretja reached 
the last four by beating fellow Spaniard Albert Costa 6-2, 6-4. Sampras 
was not scheduled to play Friday and had the opportunity to celebrate 
his unique accomplishment _ holding the No. 1 ranking for the sixth 
consecutive year. Moya is usually not much of a threat on indoor courts 
and prefers clay, the surface on which he won the French Open, and 
hard courts. Although indoors, the ATP championship is played on a 
hard court and Moya has done well at this elite season-ending event, 
reaching the semifinals for the second consecutive year. By avenging 
his semifinal loss to Kafelnikov last year, he ousted the Russian 
from the dlrs 3.5 million tournament that nominally brings the top 
eight players of the year. ``I was perhaps luckier in important moments,'' 
Moya said. ``I had to be like a wall, put back every ball. I was mentally 
stronger than last year.'' Moya, No. 4 in the world, will face Henman 
on Saturday. Henman is the first Briton to reach the semifinals in 
this event. Sampras plays Corretja. Moya's first indoor victory of 
the season after five defeats came at the start of the round-robin 
portion, when he beat Karol Kucera. He lost to Sampras and finished 
behind him in one of the four-man groups. Greg Rusedski, an alternate 
who came in when Andre Agassi pulled out with a back injury, crushed 
his fellow British teammate Henman 6-2, 6-4. Rusedski's hopes of making 
the semis vanished when Corretja cruised past Costa. The two are friends 
and spent some time together in the past couple of weeks playing golf 
and skiing. ``I just wanted to put the ball in the court because he 
was playing so badly,'' Corretja said. ``The good thing for me was 
that he hasn't played in 25 days. Sampras was assured finishing 1998 
as No. 1 and breaking the record he shared with Jimmy Connors when 
Marcelo Rios pulled out of the event with a back injury. Rios was 
replaced by Costa. ``I'll try to stay on top for as long as possible,'' 
Sampras said after crushing Karol Kucera 6-2, 6-1 late Thursday. Sampras 
feels the record may never be broken again. Other players paid tribute 
to Sampras. ``It's amazing to be up there six years in a row,'' Moya 
said. ``The way he's been playing here, he's just unbeatable.'' ``He's 
proved he is the best player ever and he is playing amazingly,'' the 
Spaniard said. The said the record will certainly not be broken in 
this generation of players. ``I don't see anyone right now who can 
be No. 1 six years in a row,'' he said. Rusedski said Sampras has 
been playing ``fabulous tennis'' here. ``He looked like the No. 1 
for the past 25 years easily,'' Rusedski said. ``It's great to see 
him in the sixth year. It's going to be more interesting if he can 
keep on going with that streak because he is a great a player,'' Rusedski 
said. ``You have to give credit to him for the way he's handled all 
the pressure. he's not had the best year but he still managed to finish 
No. 1, which is a tremendous result,'' he said. If Sampras wins this 
tournament for the fifth time, he will pull even with Ivan Lendl on 
the career list. Sampras won the event in 1991, 1994 and the last 
two years.
