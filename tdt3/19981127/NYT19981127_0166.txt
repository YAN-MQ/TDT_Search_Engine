Finding the right present for your fussy Aunt Agatha may seem a lot 
easier this Christmas than finding the right retailer in which to 
invest. First, the good news: This holiday season is expected to be 
the best in four years for retailers. An annual survey by Deloitte 
&AMP; Touche and the National Retail Federation said shoppers were 
expected to spend $173 billion, about 5.5 percent more than in the 
1997 holiday season. And the Conference Board reported last week that 
consumer confidence rose in October for the first time in four months. 
Moreover, while Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Stores and a few other retail 
stocks are trading near record highs, most have not recovered from 
the summer selloff, when investors thought shoppers might react negatively 
to world problems like Russia's default or Japan's banking crisis. 
``Everybody was worried about Asia,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst 
at Paine Webber. Everybody but the consumer. ``Main Street is quite 
far removed from Wall Street,'' he said. But there are still concerns. 
People have not shaken off recent news of corporate layoffs. Consumers 
polled in the Deloitte survey said ``everyday low prices'' were the 
first thing that would lure them to a store; last year, that bait 
placed third. Even if the economic expansion continues next year, 
it is risky to buy cyclical stocks, like those of many retailers, 
long into a period of extended economic growth. The trick, analysts 
say, is to find retailers likely to post good holiday sales. Then, 
an investor should look for the stocks that are cheap relative to 
their rivals. Finally, one should make sure the company has cash to 
weather a slowdown and management that knows the meaning of shareholder 
value. Among the top picks of several analysts and money managers 
is the Dayton Hudson Corp., the Minneapolis-based parent of Target 
discount stores and Hudson's and Marshall Field's department stores. 
It is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 23 and is cheaper than 
rivals like Wal-Mart and Costco, which have ratios of 41 and 31, respectively. 
Dayton Hudson's stock hit a one-yearlow of $26.13 in October, but 
closed at $44.25 on Friday. ``The Target division is doing beautifully,'' 
said George A. Mairs, manager of the Mairs &AMP; Power Growth fund, 
which owns some shares. ``They have clearly tried to differentiate 
themselves from Kmart and Wal-Mart by having lines that are more upscale, 
and I think this has worked well.'' He said Dayton Hudson stock could 
hit $60 within a year. Also expected to sparkle this season is the 
Zale Corp., the big jewelry chain. Watches and earrings are always 
popular gifts, and Zale has a wide selection of inexpensive items. 
The company, based in Irving, Texas, has a P/E of 15. Its luxury competitor, 
Tiffany &AMP; Co., has a ratio of 20. Zale's shares have risen almost 
50 percent from a low of $19.50 in October and are now at $28.75. 
``They're very professionally run in a business not traditionally 
known for it,'' said Michael Exstein, an analyst at Credit Suisse 
First Boston, who said he expects Zale to hit $35 within 12 months. 
Investors worried about an economic slowdown might be happy to see 
that retail stock buybacks have become as fashionable this season 
as the color gray. Such a program is one reason Alan Snyder, head 
of Snyder Capital Management, owns Pier 1 Imports. The retailer, based 
in Fort Worth, sells more than 5,000 imported items, including candles, 
furniture and tableware. In September it announced a plan to repurchase 
five million shares, its second buyback program this year. Pier 1's 
stock, now at $10.50, is way up from its low in October, but is still 
far below the $20.625 it reached on March 13. The stock has a P/E 
of 14, and Snyder expects the shares to hit $15 within a year. ``The 
companies we're buying can create their own upward momentum if the 
market doesn't recognize their value,'' he said.
