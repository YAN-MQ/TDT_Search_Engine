Wages and salaries may not be rising much at many companies, but severance 
pay has grown so generous that even temporary employees are sometimes 
paid to leave, according to a new survey of personnel managers at 
more than 1,800 companies. Temporary workers were eligible for severance 
pay at 7 percent of the companies; 20 percent reported helping temporary 
workers find jobs elsewhere. The survey, conducted by Lee Hecht Harrison, 
an outplacement firm based in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., also found that 
severance packages among all employees were more abundant than three 
years ago, when the previous survey was done. Bernadette Kenny, chief 
operating officer of Lee Hecht Harrison, said that the tight job market 
was encouraging more companies to offer additional money and services 
to departing employees. ``Retaining employees is more important now 
than ever before,'' she said. ``By providing these services, the remaining 
employees say, `This company treats employees well.' It makes the 
company an employer of choice.'' The survey found the most munificent 
severance packages in the food, beverage and tobacco industries, followed 
by transportation and travel. The areas with the stingiest packages 
were professional and business services as well as computer software 
and hardware manufacturing. Among the other findings: _ Nearly all 
the companies surveyed extend medical insurance for a time after severance; 
about half continue life insurance. Both figures are up sharply from 
1995. _ About 3 companies in 10 said they now offered job placement 
services to a wider range of employees than they did in 1995. _ Many 
companies can be talked into increasing severance benefits in some 
circumstances. Just over half said they might be willing to pay more 
cash, up from 40 percent three years ago; about a third said they 
might leave insurance coverage in effect longer, up from 25 percent 
in 1995. _ The average range of severance for top-level employees 
was 11 to 39 weeks' pay; the average range for workers at the bottom 
of the ladder was 5 to 27 weeks' pay. _ Companies have become a bit 
less indulgent of employees dismissed for poor performance: 26 percent 
offered them severance pay, down from one-third in 1995.
