And for the millions of Americans streaming into stores, onto the 
Internet and jamming the phones, the question becomes -- who will 
help them? The same question is being asked by store owners and managers 
who are desperately seeking sales help. Here's NBC's chief financial 
correspondent Mike Jensen. Nobody ever said holiday shopping was easy. 
But this year, $50 billion changing hands, the biggest crowds ever, 
the longest lines at the cash Register. And instead of clerks, help 
wanted signs everywhere you look. It seems like nobody has enough 
people in the stores. I've had such a hard time getting someone just 
to show me the items that they have. I think that the employees are 
sort of overwhelmed. Stephanie pasquarella is overwhelmed. This season 
we need help! She's offering 50% merchandise discounts to anyone who 
will work at her store in New Jersey. One reason it's tough -- the 
economy is doing so well, plenty of jobs, hardly anyone looking and 
more than 500,000 positions to fill at Christmas. Retailers are scrambling 
to find workers. Even trying to sign up shoppers in malls. 1998 is 
by far the most challenging year retailers have faced in hiring the 
numbers they need for the holidays. John lutton needs to double his 
staff. Normally, this time of year, we'd have about 22 people. We're 
sitting at about 11 people right now. At Macy's, a sign-up bonus. 
Linda Martin is in charge of hiring. We're offering a bonus of up 
to $300, depending on the market. And we have to hire 11,000 employees. 
Anna antunes is just trying to Hang onto the employees she has. Other 
businesses are coming in here and trying to recruit my people and 
take them. There's a bidding war. Money, perks, even insurance. They 
offered me like dental, medical, even life. Great for workers but 
not for shoppers, and not for America's 2 1/2 million store owners. 
For them, it's like a war zone. Going into the holiday season, short 
staffed, is a truly frightening prospect. Especially frightening with 
more than 250 million Americans flocking to the stores in what's shaping 
up as the most frustrating christmas shopping season in history, with 
27 days to go. Mike Jensen, NBC news, New York.
