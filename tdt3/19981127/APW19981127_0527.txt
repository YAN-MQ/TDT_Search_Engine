The Nigerian government is establishing a high-level monitoring team 
to track the illegal sale of gasoline and other petrol byproducts. 
The Federal Petroleum Monitoring Unit, under the direct supervision 
of the military, will soon be in operation, the government announced 
Friday. The new body will replace an earlier task force which had 
proved ineffective in curbing the profiteering black market sale of 
fuel, said Maj. Gen. Yunana Nom, the chief of training services at 
the defense ministry. Although Nigeria is one of the world's largest 
oil producing states, it is faced with chronic fuel shortages due 
to a mix of corruption, theft, neglect and mismanagement. To fill 
the gap, profiteers sell smuggled fuel at vastly inflated prices. 
The monitoring team will oversee all aspects of petroleum marketing 
and sales in Nigeria and will have the power to investigate related 
crimes, Nom said. ``We wish to appeal to all Nigerians to bear with 
the government as we seek some effective solutions to the current 
crisis,'' Nom said. Nigeria's four oil refineries are all idle due 
to disrepair, while the country is forced to import processed fuel. 
Throughout the country, petrol stations are running dry and motorists 
are desperately searching for alternative sources of gasoline. Many 
people have resorted to buying fuel on the black market, sold in glass 
bottles at up to a thousand times the regular price of 12 cents a 
liter. Nigeria's endemic poverty further exacerbates the problem, 
with people living in the oil-rich Niger River delta stealing oil 
from pipeline facilities. An estimated 700 people died last month 
when oil from a leaking pipeline erupted into flames. The victims 
were scavenging for spilled oil. The current fuel crisis has become 
politically charged with the opposition Nigeria Labor Congress warning 
the ruling military government not to hike petrol prices. ``We call 
on the federal government to drop the idea forthwith,'' said Congress 
Chairman Godwin Workeh. Hints about a possible fuel price hike came 
from new military leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who recently said 
the increases were necessary and could be introduced as early as next 
year. One of the reasons for the proposed increase is the cheap price 
of Nigerian gasoline compared to its neighbor countries. Inexpensive 
Nigeria fuel is often smuggled across land borders, depriving Nigeria 
of the gasoline and worsening the shortage.
