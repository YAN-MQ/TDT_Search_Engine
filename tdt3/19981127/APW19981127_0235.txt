Palestinians stoned Jewish settlers and Israeli soldiers Friday after 
settlers blocked Palestinian motorists from using a road near their 
enclave and then marched into the Palestinian-run sector of this divided 
city. Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets to disperse the stone-throwers 
and eventually escorted the group of about 20 settlers, most of them 
women, back into the Israeli-controlled downtown area. The clashes 
were triggered by the Israeli army's decision to open a road near 
the Jewish enclave of Avraham Avinu. The road had been closed to Palestinian 
motorists after hand grenades were thrown from there at a group of 
Israeli soldiers in September. On Friday, a bulldozer cleared cement 
blocks from the road. Jewish settlers responded angrily, saying they 
were being endangered by Palestinian traffic passing close by their 
homes.
