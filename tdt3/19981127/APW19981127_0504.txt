The ex-chief of Russia's Federal Security Service has filed a libel 
suit against a controversial business mogul for alleging that secret 
agents were plotting to kill him, the former spy said Friday. Boris 
Berezovsky, a billionaire with close Kremlin ties, made the accusations 
earlier this month in an open letter to Vladimir Putin, the current 
head of the security service, known by its Russian acronym as the 
FSB. The service is the main successor of the Soviet KGB and employs 
many of its former agents. In the open letter, published by the daily 
Kommersant, Berezovsky claimed that many top FSB officers share a 
communist ideology and dream of undoing democratic reforms and restoring 
the repressive security system employed during Soviet times. Former 
FSB chief Nikolai Kovalyov _ one of the people Berezovsky has mentioned 
in the alleged plot _ adamantly denied the allegations Friday, and 
said he had sued for libel, the Interfax news agency reported. ``An 
unabashed mud-slinging campaign is being waged against law enforcement 
bodies,'' Kovalyov told a news conference. ``The professional reputation 
of Russia's FSB has been roiled, (the service) has been unfairly portrayed 
in black.'' Kovalyov said he may also request that a criminal case 
be opened against Berezovsky, Interfax reported. The scandal began 
when FSB Lt. Col. Alexander Litvinenko reported to President Boris 
Yeltsin's office this spring that his commanding officer had ordered 
him to kill Berezovsky. The chief prosecutor's office started an investigation, 
then suspended it for lack of evidence. The officer who allegedly 
gave the order to kill Berezovsky, Alexander Kamyshnikov, deputy head 
of the FSB's department for organized crime, has denied the claims. 
But Litvinenko again went public with the allegations, calling a news 
conference last week to accuse his bosses of ordering kidnappings, 
extortion and contract murders, including a plot to kill Berezovsky. 
Several other officers _ one of them wearing ski mask to the news 
conference _ supported Litvinenko's account. Following the allegations, 
Yeltsin ordered Putin, the FSB chief, to look into reports illegal 
FSB activities, including alleged plots to kill Berezovsky. Berezovsky 
was injured in 1994 when a bomb destroyed his armored Mercedes sedan 
and killed his driver. The case has never been solved. Berezovsky, 
whose business interests range from oil to cars to media holdings, 
is also executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States, 
a loose alliance of 12 ex-Soviet republics.
