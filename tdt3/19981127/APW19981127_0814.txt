Despite pressure from Italy, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Friday 
that Germany will not seek to extradite rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah 
Ocalan on murder and terror charges. Instead, Italy and Germany immediately 
will push for the formation of an international court where Ocalan 
could be tried, Schroeder announced after meeting with Italian Premier 
Massimo D'Alema. While Italy arrested the Kurdish leader on a German 
warrant, Germany is reluctant to bring him here for trial, fearing 
unrest among Germany's 2 million Turks _ about one-quarter of them 
Kurds. Schroeder pointed out that Germany has more Turkish Kurds than 
any other European nation _ 400,000 _ and that he ruled out seeking 
extradition to ``protect the peace.'' D'Alema said he took Schroeder's 
concerns seriously and that he could not judge questions of German 
internal security. Even as the politicians met in Bonn, thousands 
of Turkish Kurds rallied nearby to support Ocalan, the leader of the 
outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a 14-year 
war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey. The conflict has killed 37,000 
people. Police said 11,000 protesters gathered on Friday, and Kurdish 
groups have announced protests for Saturday in several cities around 
Germany. After the meeting, Schroeder said Germany and Italy will 
work with Turkey to help it resolve the question of Kurdish autonomy 
at home. ``We want a friendly, normal relations with Turkey,'' the 
chancellor said. Ocalan _ a fugitive from terror and murder charges 
in Turkey, where he faces the death penalty _ was arrested Nov. 12 
when he arrived at the Rome airport aboard a flight from Moscow. A 
Rome court freed him last Friday, rejecting a Turkish warrant because 
Italian law forbids the extradition of suspects to countries where 
they face the death penalty. The decision enraged many in Turkey who 
consider Ocalan their most-wanted criminal. Protesters have burned 
Italian clothes and cars and launched boycotts against Italian products. 
For now, Ocalan is under police surveillance at a Rome villa. Judges 
have ordered him to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give Germany time 
to mull over extradition. Germany, as well as the other countries 
in the European Union, does not have the death penalty. Germany has 
two arrest warrants for the Kurdish rebel chief, one for a single 
murder charged in 1990 and another issued last weekend. German media 
reports say the new, broader charges include ``liquidation of a string 
of dissidents'' in Germany in the 1980s and a string of arson attacks 
in 1993. The attacks led Germany to ban the PKK as a terrorist group 
the same year. The Justice Ministry suggested it feared similar unrest 
if Ocalan were brought here for trial. ``Included in the political 
questions are domestic issues, and question of how and if we deal 
with the Kurdish question,'' Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin 
was quoted as saying in the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper said 
Friday. The head of the Kurdish Communities in Germany, Mehmet Tanriverdi, 
has asked the German government to help reach a political settlement 
in Turkey on the question of Kurdish autonomy. He also says Ocalan 
should be given asylum in Italy and be free to travel in Europe.
