They're working out there in orbit and they're nearly 400 kilometers 
above the earth in a rather hostile environment of space, but U.S. 
astronauts still have managed to successfully hook up 40 electrical 
cables linking the first two pieces of the international space station. 
The two astronauts completed their six-hour job two hours ahead of 
schedule, working nonstop from the end of the shuttle endeavor's 15 
meter robotic arm. NASA says it will take two more space walks this 
week to complete the hook up between the Russian and the American 
modules. On Sunday, the Endeavor crew used the arm and a computerized 
vision system to link the Russian module launched last month with 
the U.S. section aboard the shuttle. The two sections are now mated 
in the shuttle's cargo bay where they will stay for about a week while 
the shuttle crew adds equipment.
