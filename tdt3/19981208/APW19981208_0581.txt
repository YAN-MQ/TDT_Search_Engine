Prime Minister Tony Blair called Tuesday for a close trading alliance 
between Britain and China, and said that Britain should aim to become 
the country's major business partner in Europe. ``I believe China 
is ripe for British investment,'' Blair said, addressing the China-Britain 
Business Council. ``Our aim is very clear. It is nothing less than 
to make Britain China's number one business partner in Europe for 
both trade and investment.'' Blair, who visited China in October, 
also promised he would personally help businessmen win contracts in 
China _ contradicting his International Development Secretary, Clare 
Short, who on Sunday said that she had refused to promote British 
export deals. Brushing aside criticism from businessmen and the opposition 
Conservative Party, Short, who oversees Britain's international aid 
program, said Monday that she was right not to use her office to promote 
trade during an October visit to China, instead raising human rights 
issues. Blair said Britain's 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China enabled 
the two countries to ``build a new relationship unhindered by the 
legacy of history.'' Throughout the 1990s, Britain's relationship 
with China was damaged by wrangling over the future of the British 
colony. Blair said he would continue to press Chinese leaders about 
human rights, adding that criticisms would be more productive if delivered 
``in the context of a warm relationship.'' ``We can be constructive 
as well as fully engage in dialogue at all levels while maintaining 
an atmosphere of mutual respect,'' Blair said.
