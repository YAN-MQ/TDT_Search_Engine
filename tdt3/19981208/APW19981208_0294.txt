India's main opposition leader Sonia Gandhi accused Prime Minister 
Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government of mishandling India's economy, 
but appeared to be in no hurry to try to topple the right-wing coalition. 
The current political and economic situation continued to cause extreme 
worry, local news agencies quoted Congress party leader Gandhi as 
saying Tuesday in a speech to members of her party who are in parliament. 
Congress's strong showing in recent state elections _ which did not 
directly affect the federal government _ led to speculation Gandhi 
would call a vote of confidence to topple Vajpayee, and then put together 
a new coalition to replace his government. Signaling that the party 
would wait for the 19-party Vajpayee government to fall on its own, 
Gandhi said: ``We stand prepared to discharge our constitutional obligations 
as and when the situation requires us to do so.'' Vajpayee's coalition 
suffered a setback Monday when a southern alliance of four parties 
broke up and the main group decided to support a general strike called 
next week by unions and other parties to protest the government policies, 
including its decision to allow 40 percent foreign equity in the insurance 
sector. The four parties all continued to support Vajpayee, but his 
coalition will be all the shakier with the southerners fighting among 
themselves.
