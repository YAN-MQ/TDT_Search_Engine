As the White House set out President Clinton's final defense before 
the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, the audience that mattered 
most was not the one in the cavernous hearing room. Nor was it the 
nation's television viewers. It was the 20 to 30 moderate Republicans 
who could swing a House impeachment vote one way or the other and 
who urgently need a compelling rationale if they are to oppose impeaching 
Clinton. ``I'm desperately looking for a reason that it can be explained 
away,'' said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif. Of Clinton, he said, ``I 
just wish he'd spent more time explaining himself than having attack 
dogs go after these issues.'' So in the now-critical, down-to-the 
wire White House quest to win over such Republicans, Gregory Craig, 
the White House special counsel, on Tuesday tried to challenge the 
facts of the case built by Kenneth Starr. He showcased figures like 
Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, attorney general under President Johnson, 
to remind Congress it is considering removing an elected president 
against the popular will. And perhaps most important of all, Craig 
re-emphasized the contrition that had seemed to fade from White House 
statements in recent weeks. ``In truth, I would not be fairly representing 
President Clinton if I did not convey to you his profound and powerful 
regret for what he has done,'' he said. ``He has insisted and personally 
instructed his lawyers that no legalities and technicalities should 
be allowed to obscure the simple moral truth that his behavior in 
this matter was wrong.'' It was left to Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., 
to wonder aloud how impeachment could now be riding on whether or 
not Clinton is perceived to be truly remorseful. ``You may judge the 
president as what kind of man he is by the level of contrition,'' 
he said, ``but not whether he should be impeached.'' Still, it has 
always been the case that impeachment is as much a political process 
as a quasi-legal one. And members of Congress say President Clinton 
and his aides made a series of costly political missteps after the 
mid-term elections, unable to believe that the Republicans' surprising 
election losses would not stop them dead in their tracks. ``There's 
no question that the euphoria from the November election clouded their 
expectation about what would happen in the Congress,'' said Leon Panetta, 
a former White House chief of staff who has been participating in 
White House conference calls on impeachment strategy. In fact, Democrats 
say, the White House, using its own internal polling, began arguing 
that the force of public opinion was running so strongly with Clinton 
that the Republicans would never proceed with impeachment. ``The White 
House is so obsessed with polling that it can't imagine anyone else 
would ignore it,'' said one Democratic strategist. So when Republicans 
called Starr before the Judiciary Committee, the White House played 
for public opinion and sought to heap more discredit on a prosecutor 
already low in public standing. David Kendall, Clinton's private attorney 
who has jousted with Starr in legal proceedings for four years, shook 
him by aggressively questioning the conduct of his office. But he 
did nothing to contest the facts that have left many Republicans believe 
the president has committed impeachable offenses. And when Clinton 
did answer 81 questions put to him by the committee, his answers seemed 
so evasive and legalistic that Republicans say that was a turning 
point. Many of the same moderates Clinton needs to woo saw White House 
response as arrogant and were alienated by it. White House officials 
argue that they have had to conduct a difficult balancing act, aware 
of a political need for the president to show he erred but unwilling 
to do anything that could open Clinton to prosecution for perjury 
after he leaves office. ``Certainly, there's concern that there could 
be legal action,'' said a senior White House official. But even on 
Tuesday the president's side at times seemed tone deaf, with some 
witnesses condescending to or on the offensive against the Republicans. 
Sean Wilentz, a Princeton professor, told the panel's members that 
they risk ``going down in history with the zealots and the fanatics.'' 
And he said, ``if you are at all unsure, and yet you vote in favor 
of impeachment anyway for some other reason, history will track you 
down and condemn you for your cravenness.''
