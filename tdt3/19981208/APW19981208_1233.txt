BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
blasted both Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, saying Tuesday 
their inflammatory public statements hindered peace efforts in the 
Serb province. Albright also warned Serb authorities at a news conference 
that NATO ``remains ready to act if necessary'' in Kosovo to stop 
continuing violence. Earlier, NATO's 16 foreign ministers issued a 
statement deploring the continuing violence and also blamed both sides. 
``The security situation in Kosovo remains of great concern to us,'' 
the ministers said. ``Since the beginning of November, violent incidents 
provoked in some cases by Serbian security forces and in others by 
armed Kosovar elements have increased tension. These incidents show 
that both the Belgrade authorities and the armed Kosovar elements 
have failed to comply fully with the requirements set on in U.N. Security 
Council resolutions.'' Hundreds of people, mostly civilians, have 
died and hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes in seven 
months of fighting between the Serb police and armed forces and the 
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Serbia, the dominant republic in what 
is left of the Yugoslav federation, withdrew Kosovo's autonomy in 
1989. The ethnic Albanian majority is now demanding independence, 
something the Belgrade authorities have rejected. The fighting was 
halted and a shaky cease-fire installed only after NATO threatened 
to conduct air strikes. ``Both Serb and Albanian leaders have made 
public statements that do not help the cause of peace,'' Albright 
said. ``Serb threats to launch a renewed offensive in Kosovo are dangerous 
and we view them with extreme seriousness. ``I want to remind the 
Serb leadership that NATO remains ready to act if necessary. On the 
other hand, Kosovo Albanian insistence on rhetoric of independence 
and rejection of the Contact Group's draft agreement do have help 
us to move forward.'' The ministers insisted in their joint declaration 
that both sides stick to the cease-fire. ``We also expect them to 
facilitate the war crimes investigations by the International Tribunal 
for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In this connection, we deplore the 
denial of visas to ICTY investigators.'' The ministers urged all parties 
``to move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and accommodation to conclude 
the negotiating process.'' The ministers also condemned recent actions 
by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to suppress the independent 
media in Serbia. The alliance said it would continue its air verification 
mission, flying surveillance missions over the province, and pledged 
its full cooperation to the civilian cease-fire ``verifiers'' under 
the direction of the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe.
