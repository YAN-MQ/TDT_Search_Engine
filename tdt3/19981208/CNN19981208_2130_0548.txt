Light duty today for the shuttle "endeavour" crew. Astronauts boosted 
the attached components of the international space station into a 
higher orbit in preparation of a second space walk tomorrow. NASA 
has declared the first one a success. Yesterday, two astronauts connected 
40 cables linking Russian and American components of the international 
space station. Tomorrow and Friday, the astronauts plan to install 
communications antennae and move some supplies.
