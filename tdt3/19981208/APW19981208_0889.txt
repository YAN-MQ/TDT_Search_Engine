Paris is entering the crowded race for the 2008 Olympics. President 
Jacques Chirac phoned IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch to confirm 
the city's bid to stage the games, the French Olympic Committee said 
Tuesday. Paris is the latest in a long list of cities announcing their 
candidacy for the games. Other candidates so far include Beijing; 
Toronto; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Istanbul, 
Turkey; Osaka, Japan, and Seville, Spain. Cairo is also weighing a 
possible bid. China is considered the early strong favorite. Beijing, 
which lost narrowly to Sydney in the race for the 2000 games, announced 
a bid last week. There had been speculation that Paris would not submit 
a bid if China entered the race. But there is a strong body of opinion 
that cities rarely win an Olympic bid at the first attempt and it's 
advisable to get into position for a successful run four years later. 
With Athens hosting the 2004 Olympics, the International Olympic Committee 
is likely to choose a non-European city in 2008. Paris could be in 
a strong position for 2012. The IOC will open the bidding next year 
and select the 2008 host city in Moscow in 2001.
