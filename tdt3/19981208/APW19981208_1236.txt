A corruption investigation was launched Tuesday against the chief 
of Russia's missile fuel agency and some of his colleagues, military 
prosecutors said. Criminal probes against several Defense Ministry 
officials were opened Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted the 
central military prosecutor's office as saying. Among targets of the 
investigations are Lt. Gen. Pavel Goropai, head of the missile fuel 
agency, his first deputy Maj. Gen. Konstantin Kulagin and other agency 
officials, the report said. It gave no details of their reported offenses. 
Also Tuesday, Russian Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov said corruption 
in Russia had reached the ``top echelons of power ... all the ministries, 
institutions and law enforcement agencies.'' ``It is necessary to 
put things in order at the top level. If the system itself, the Finance 
Ministry, for example, keeps under control the actions of its staff 
members, then the needed results will be achieved,'' Skuratov was 
quoted by ITAR-Tass as saying. He gave no examples of specific instances 
of corruption.
