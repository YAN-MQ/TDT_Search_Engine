Twenty-four victims of an orphanage fire, including 19 unidentified 
children, were buried Tuesday in rows of concrete tombs at Manila's 
public cemetery. Hundreds of people watched, some weeping, as the 
small coffins were carried to the burial site. A Christmas package 
with a toy inside was placed on top of each child's coffin before 
the simple tombs were sealed. Only eight of the 30 people who died 
in the predawn fire last Thursday in the orphanage in a Manila slum 
neighborhood have been identified because of their severe burns. The 
private orphanage also housed children of unwed mothers and of working 
parents. Some relatives resisted Tuesday's burial, hoping that the 
badly charred bodies could be identified first. ``They have to be 
laid to rest,'' said Marisa Balasabas, the mother of a 1-year-old 
boy who remains unidentified. ``With a heavy heart, I have to accept 
what happened.'' Balasabas said the children's names will be listed 
on a common marker next to the rows of concrete tombs. ``Seeing the 
proper name on each tomb would have made it easier for us to pray,'' 
she added with regret. The bodies of other victims have been taken 
to their home provinces by relatives. Hours before the burial, hundreds 
of people, including survivors of a disco fire in 1995 that killed 
162 people, lit candles in front of the ruins of the orphanage and 
called for tighter fire inspections and punishment of those responsible. 
Many carried placards reading, ``Give justice to the dead.'' The orphanage's 
staff said 30 people died in the blaze _ 25 children and five adults 
_ although fire investigators have found only 28 bodies in the ruble 
of the 85-year-old building. Investigators said it may take up to 
15 days before they can conclude what caused the fire in Manila's 
Paco district. On Friday, fire officer Romeo Almero was removed as 
Paco fire station chief. No reason was given for his suspension, but 
local news reports said firefighters arrived late at the scene. Fire 
officials said the fire was not immediately reported, apparently because 
of the absence of telephones in the slum neighborhood. The first call 
came from someone several blocks away, they said. The tragedy revived 
concerns about the government's fire-fighting ability. In Manila, 
only 15 of about 40 city fire trucks are in operating condition. About 
100 more are run by volunteer fire brigades funded by ethnic Chinese-Filipino 
business groups.
