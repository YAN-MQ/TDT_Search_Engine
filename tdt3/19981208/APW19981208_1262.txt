Italian side Bologna moved into the quarterfinals of the UEFA Cup 
on a 4-2 aggregate despite losing to Spain's Betis 1-0 Tuesday in 
the third round, second leg of the UEFA Cup. Oliverio Alvarez scored 
for Betis in the fourth minute for the only goal of the match after 
the Spaniards were hammered 4-1 in the first leg two weeks ago in 
Italy. The Seville side led by former Spanish national coach Javier 
Clemente was facing an uphill battle all the way, as Bologna's defense 
is ranked second in the Italian Serie A. Things started off just as 
Clemente wanted, as Alvarez slammed in a ball that had initially been 
deflected by Bologna goal keeper Francesco Antonioli. Seville kept 
pressing and Ivan Perez had a chance to make it 2-0 in the 30th minute 
but his shot hit an upright. In the second half Bologna held on as 
the Betis simply wore itself out physically. As the clock ticked off 
the final minutes Bologna went on the counter-attack and had a couple 
of chances to tie the game but failed. Some 20,000 people watched 
the game at Benito Villamarin Stadium.
