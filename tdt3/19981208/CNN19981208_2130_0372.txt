Later, the president and the first lady flew to Nashville, Tennessee, 
for a Memorial service for Albert Gore Sr., the former U.S. senator 
and father of the vice president. Gore died Saturday at his Tennessee 
farm. He was 90. As most of you know, there was a time when some people

extremely attractive." Now that's humanity. Mr. Clinton says the Elder 
Gore was the embodiment of everything public service ought to be.
