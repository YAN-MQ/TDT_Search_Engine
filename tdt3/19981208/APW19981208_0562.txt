A leading National Front member called on Tuesday for a meeting of 
the far-right party in order to iron out differences between Jean-Marie 
Le Pen and Bruno Megret, the party's two battling leaders. ``Party 
members, elected officials and activists want to be heard and they 
very much want to see a Le Pen-Megret ticket,'' said Jean-Yves Le 
Gallou, a regional National Front leader in the Paris area who is 
close to Megret. Meanwhile, conservative politicians from the traditional 
right expressed satisfaction with the crisis that is pitting Le Pen 
against Megret, his longtime lieutenant. Gilles de Robien, a conservative 
member of parliament, told LCI television he applauded the ``weakening 
of an extremist party that has no business in a democracy.'' ``What 
is happening at the National Front is the destiny of all authoritarian 
parties, where there is no internal democracy,'' said de Robien, a 
member of the the Union for French Democracy party. The brewing rivalry 
between Le Pen and Megret burst onto the surface this weekend. In 
the clearest sign of serious trouble in the party, one of Le Pen's 
loyalists openly defied him on Monday _ and was immediately fired. 
Three other firings followed, in what amounted to a purge of party 
members close to Megret. Serge Martinez, a longtime Le Pen loyalist 
who was one of those dismissed Monday from his functions, said Tuesday 
he wanted to remain a member of the far-right party. ``It is clear 
that a number of National Front members have lost their reason,'' 
Martinez said. ``We don't want to be pushed out without being able 
to react,'' he told France Inter radio. Meanwhile, Philippe Seguin, 
the head of French President Jacques Chirac's Rally for the Republic 
party, said he sees no difference between Le Pen and Megret. ``Le 
Pen et Megret share the same ideology,'' Seguin was quoted as saying 
in the daily Le Parisien. ``For my part, I cannot tell the difference 
between the two.'' Megret has called a news conference for Wednesday 
to respond to the growing controversy. The anti-immigrant party has 
been widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
