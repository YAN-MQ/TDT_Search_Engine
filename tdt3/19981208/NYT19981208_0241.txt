In a duet that makes oil and water seem like a friendlier mix, Luciano 
Pavarotti, stiff in white tie and tails, looks straight ahead at the 
audience, oblivious to Celine Dion right next to him onstage. As they 
perform ``I Hate You, Then I Love You'' (a duet they also did last 
year on one of Ms. Dion's albums), he stares in the direction of the 
teleprompter while singing, ``I could never live without you.'' Meanwhile, 
she faces him, waving her arms wildly, closing her eyes melodramatically, 
generally behaving like a lunatic. His hauteur and her overacting 
have nothing to do with dramatizing the lyrics, but are symptomatic 
of two singers who probably should not appear on the same continent, 
never mind the same stage. That sort of high camp is what you might 
expect from ``Pavarotti and Friends,'' a concert in which the tenor's 
new pals range from the silly to the creative, from the Spice Girls 
to Stevie Wonder. Most fit into a mushy middle ground of pop singers, 
including Jon Bon Jovi, Natalie Cole, Trisha Yearwood and Vanessa 
Williams. But that kitschy moment is the exception in this disappointingly 
low-energy concert, the centerpiece of the current membership drive 
by Channel 13 in New York. This ``Great Performances'' episode was 
taped in June before a huge outdoor crowd in Modena, Italy, Pavarotti's 
hometown. At least it was staged for a charitable cause, to benefit 
children orphaned by the civil war in Liberia. It was directed by 
Spike Lee, who is seen offstage with Pavarotti at the start of the 
special discussing the chorus of Liberian and Italian children put 
together for the event. The concert is a nice idea that quickly turns 
flat. Purists might see this as Pavarotti's latest tumble down the 
cultural ladder, but that is not a problem. The difficulty is that 
this meeting of high art and pop is not informed by any grace or wit. 
Pavarotti exudes an atypical noblesse oblige toward his guests. And 
as they move through familiar solos and awkward duets with the star, 
the concert seems tossed together, with styles crashing into one another. 
Standing before the full orchestra, Ms. Dion offers a stately version 
of her inescapable ``My Heart Will Go On,'' complete with her signature 
chest-thumping gesture (which always seems reminiscent of Tarzan). 
The low point may be Ms. Cole and Pavarotti's duet on ``Tonight,'' 
which makes both seem ill at ease. When the four Spice Girls sing 
the vapid ``Viva Forever'' with Pavarotti, the linguistic mishmash 
of the song's title might stand for this entire enterprise. The highlight 
comes at the end, when Wonder sings ``Peace Wanted Just to Be Free,'' 
a swooping, lyrical song written for this concert. When Pavarotti 
joins him, it is the only time he seems to connect with one of his 
guests. Part of Pavarotti's discomfort might have been physical; he 
had hip-replacement surgery six weeks after this concert. Whatever 
the cause, the disappointing outcome stands. Coming during PBS' membership 
drive, the concert throws an unattractive light on what happens when 
a supposedly upscale institution decides to go slumming for an audience. 
Previous pledge drives have done well with even more horrendous musical 
specials featuring John Tesh and Yanni. If this is PBS' idea of pop 
culture at its best, no wonder the network so often seems culturally 
out of touch. Bobby Darin: Beyond the Song PBS usually understands 
pop music better when it's safely locked in the past. ``Bobby Darin,'' 
another pledge program, is an uneven, reverent, sometimes entertaining 
biography. In its many pedestrian scenes, it includes interviews with 
friends and colleagues who cast an expected golden glow on the life 
of a man who had a string of hits in the late '50s and early '60s 
and died at 37. Yet he comes across as more of a Rat Pack wannabe 
than a true original. At its best, the program includes juicy clips 
of Darin onstage and in what now seem antique television appearances. 
The songs include ``Beyond the Sea'' and ``Mack the Knife,'' as well 
as one bizarrely irresistible duet (the kind the Pavarotti special 
might have delivered): ``Splish Splash (I Was Taking a Bath)'' sung 
with Jimmy Durante. PRODUCTION NOTES: `PAVAROTTI AND FRIENDS' 8 p.m. 
ET Wednesday on PBS `BOBBY DARIN' 10 p.m. ET Wednesday on PBS
