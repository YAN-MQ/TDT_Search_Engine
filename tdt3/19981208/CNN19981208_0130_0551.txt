A new study finds the use of heroin among American teenagers is increasing. 
It also concludes many middle-class teens have the mistaken belief 
that snorting the drug makes it less addictive than shooting up. According 
to the study, the percentage of American 12th-graders who used heroin 
doubled between 1990 and 1996, from just under 1% to 1.8%. the rate 
increased last year to 2.1%. the study is published in this month's 
issue of the journal, "pediatrics."
