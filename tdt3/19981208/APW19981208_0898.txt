In yet another sign that the American pro season may never begin, 
the National Basketball Asscoation on Tuesday canceled its annual 
exhibition All-Star game. Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell said that 
commissioner David Stern telephoned him with the news and was to make 
the announcement later Tuesday at a news conference in New York. The 
game had been scheduled for Feb. 14 in Philadelphia. ``That's the 
only landmark left,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik told USA 
Today. ``I hope the players haven't been convinced that the owners 
would never cancel the whole season.'' The league was negotiating 
with Philadelphia, through the mayor's office, to find ways of softening 
the impact on hotels, which reserved large blocks of rooms for the 
weekend, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The league booked dlrs 
3 million worth of rooms. The hotels could have earned that much in 
food and beverage sales. Meanwhile, agents David Falk and Arn Tellem 
announced Monday that an exhibition game involving locked out NBA 
players is set for Dec. 19 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, with the 
proceeds going to charity and to players in financial need. But Falk's 
most famous client, Michael Jordan, won't be playing. ``Michael has 
said he won't make a decision about returning to professional basketball 
or retiring until the lockout is over,'' said Curtis Polk, president 
of Falk's sports management company. ``We did talk to Michael about 
the game, obviously, and Michael feels he needs to stand by his earlier 
statement that he'll wait for a resolution of the lockout before he 
makes that decision. He wouldn't want to send the fans a sort of mixed 
message by his participation in this game.'' Jordan's absence didn't 
stop the Atlantic City organizers from pricing their game extravagantly. 
Tickets will cost from dlrs 25 to dlrs 1,000 for courtside seats, 
and organizers hope to raise at least dlrs 1 million. None of the 
players will be paid, and no criteria have been established for determining 
which players will share in the proceeds. ``If you look at people 
who play professional sports, not a lot of them are financially secure,'' 
union president Patrick Ewing said. ``They make a lot of money, and 
they also spend a lot of money. ``Me, I'm financially secure, but 
there a lot of others who aren't. Our objective is to help these people. 
No matter how much money they've made throughout their careers, if 
they're in need now, then it's up to us to try and help them,'' Ewing 
said. Thirteen players are committed to play, and organizers hope 
to have a total of 16 players who were members of the four Dream teams 
_ the 1992 and 1996 Olympic teams and the 1994 and 1998 World Championship 
teams. Ewing, Karl Malone, Penny Hardaway, Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston, 
Reggie Miller, Alonzo Mourning, Tom Gugliotta, Gary Payton, Dominique 
Wilkins, Vin Baker, Glen Rice and Mitch Richmond have committed.
