The owner of South Korea's Hyundai business group will visit North 
Korea again next week to discuss tourism and other business deals 
in the communist country, Hyundai officials said Tuesday. Chung Ju-yung, 
84, will cross the heavily armed border at the truce village of Panmunjom 
next Tuesday for his third visit to the North this year, they said. 
Chung visited his native North Korea with a gift of 1001 cattle in 
June and October and returned home with approval for several business 
deals, including a sightseeing tour of scenic Diamond Mountain on 
the North's east coast. About 4,400 South Koreans have been allowed 
to visit Diamond Mountain by cruise ship since the tour began on Nov. 
18. In return for the right to organize the tours, Hyundai must pay 
North Korea dlrs 906 million over the next six years. Hyundai officials 
said Chung will be visiting North Korea next week with a gift of 50 
passenger cars. On his two previous visits, he donated 100 trucks 
and 20 Hyundai cars worth dlrs 2.5 million. During next week's visit, 
Chung will follow up other joint venture projects agreed on earlier, 
including a thermal power plant, a car assembly plant and an industrial 
park, Hyundai officials said. The sightseeing project is the largest 
inter-Korea joint venture since the Korean peninsula was divided into 
the communist North and capitalist South in 1945.
