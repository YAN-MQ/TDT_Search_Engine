ten hours, 39 right now on VOA News now. President Clinton has removed 
Iran and Malaysia from the official U.S. list of major narcotics producing 
nations. Mr. Clinton stopped short of certifying that both nations 
are fully cooperating in the fight against illegal drugs. VOA's Nick 
Simio reports. In the case of Iran, the president sites a U.S. government 
review which he says suggests no evidence of significant poppy cultivation 
in usual growing areas. In a letter to Congress, Mr. Clinton says 
it's possible poppies for opium production are still being cultivated 
in remote areas, although unlikely at levels that would meet the definition 
of a major drug producing country. The president offers no details 
about how the United States obtained evidence to reach these conclusions, 
although his letter to lawmakers says the Iranian government has reported 
its own success in eradicating poppy growth. One U.S. official said 
he presumes the evidence was gleaned from satellite photos. The president's 
decision to upgrade Iran's performance in the fight against illegal 
drugs occurs at a time when Washington and Tehran have been trying 
to encourage increased contacts after nearly two decades of no official 
diplomatic relations. But one White House aide said that desire had 
no bearing on the U.S. findings regarding drugs. The Clinton administration 
has been advocating a direct government dialogue with Iran's leadership 
with Iran favoring increased cultural or people to people contacts 
instead. In the case of Malaysia, that country has been identified 
as a key transit route for heroin reaching the United States. But 
President Clinton says the U.S. government now has no indication that 
drugs significantly effecting the United States have transited the 
country during the past few years. Nick Simio, VOA News at the White 
House.
