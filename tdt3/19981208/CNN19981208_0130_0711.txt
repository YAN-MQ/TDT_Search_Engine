Where's the bacon? I smell bacon! Bacon! Bacon! Gotta be bacon! Only 
one thing smells like bacon! That's bacon! Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon! 
There! In that bag! What's it say? I can't read! Please, please give 
me what's in the bag! Chewy, yummy, smoky bacon! Here you go! Oh boy, 
oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! It's bacon! No, it's beggin' strips brand 
dog snack from Purina! Beggin strips... it's bacon!
