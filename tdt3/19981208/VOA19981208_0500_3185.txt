It takes a lot of talent to stay ahead of the greats of the blues 
like BB King and John Lee Hooker. But a 17-year-old singer and guitarist 
named Johnny Lang has found just the way to do it. For the past month, 
Lang's new album has held onto the number one spot on Billboard's 
blues chart and he's gaining audiences young and old alike. VOA's 
Doug Levine tells us more about this unlikely new trailblazer. Without 
knowing his real age, most would have guessed that the singer is much 
older, someone who has been through it all. And most are amazed when 
they learn that he's still just a teenager. At 17, Johnny Lang is 
causing a major stir in the blues world. His fiery guitar is reminiscent 
of the late Albert Collins. And his vocals are being compared to rock 
star Eric Clapton in his younger days. Lang's music has not only impressed 
record buyers, but also his heros, Buddy Guy and BB King, who have 
each invited Lang to perform with them on stage. Johnny Lang exploded 
onto the scene in 1997 with his previous album "Lie to Me." "Lie to 
Me" sold more than a million copies and made Lang an instant sensation 
with both younger and older audiences. The album is still on Billboard's 
top 10. Upon hearing a raw tape of "Lie to Me" before its release, 
guitarist Jimmy Thackery jokingly remarked, he plays so good, I want 
to break his fingers. On the new cut, Cherry Red Wine, the notes fly 
by so fast it's a wonder Johnny Lang has any fingers left to play 
the guitar. Johnny Lang hails from Minneapolis, Minnesota. He got 
the guitar bug after seeing a concert with the Bad Medicine Blues 
Band, a local group from Fargo, North Dakota, whose lead guitarist 
offered to teach Lang a few chords. Lang, only 12 at the time, joined 
the band which was renamed Kid Johnny Lang and the Big Bang. Sales 
of their first album sold in excess of 25,000 copies. Last year, following 
the release of "Lie to Me," Lang swept the best new guitarist category 
in Guitar Magazine's readers poll. Today, he's busier than ever. In 
between tour dates, he made a cameo appearance in the film "Blues 
Brothers 2000." Johnny Lang's new CD, "Wander This World," has topped 
Billboard's blues album's chart for more than five weeks. I'm Doug 
Levine.
