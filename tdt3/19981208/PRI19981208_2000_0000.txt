This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. It is Tuesday, December 8, I am Tony Kahn. Today, 
UN weapons monitors step up the pressure on Iraq as they launch a 
week of intensive inspections. And Chileans step up the pressure on 
Britain even those not yet born when Augusto Pinochet rose to power 
have strong opinions about the former dictator. I think no matter 
how young you are, I mean you could be a child and still feel affected 
by what is happened in this country. Also the Australian One Nation 
Party's one candidate is in one heap of trouble. First, this news. 
From National Public Radio News in Washington, I am Kory Flintoff.
