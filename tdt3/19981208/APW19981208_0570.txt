NEW YORK (AP) _ AT and T Corp. is buying IBM's data networking business 
for dlrs 5 billion cash, filling an important gap in AT and T's ability 
to supply business customers with high-speed data services and Internet 
access. International Business Machines Corp.'s Global Network Business, 
with dlrs 2.5 billion in revenue, has 1 million Internet users as 
well as tens of thousand of business customers in the U.S. and abroad. 
Companies use the network to link computers that are far apart, to 
accept orders from customers and to connect to the Internet. Under 
the deal announced Tuesday, 5,000 IBM employees from the global network 
division will go to work for AT and T when the deal closes. The deal 
is expected to be concluded within six months or so. In a related 
move, IBM agreed to manage AT and T's computers that support its long-distance 
services for business customers for dlrs 4 billion over 10 years. 
As a result, more than 2,000 AT and T employees will be offered jobs 
at IBM. In addition, AT and T will manage the communications needed 
by IBM for its business customers for dlrs 5 billion over five years. 
Tuesday's deal, which has been rumored for months, aids AT and T's 
goal to become a dominant provider of communications that use Internet 
technology to transmit data. In addition to giving AT and T a strong 
presence in the United States, the deal bolsters AT and T's joint 
venture with British Telecom, announced earlier this year, which aims 
to supply communications services to business customers across different 
nations. For IBM, the sale enables it to focus on its strengths in 
selling computers and computer services. IBM's network grew from a 
phone system linking its outposts into one of the world's largest 
communications systems. It transmits corporate data for about 30,000 
customers in 50 countries.
