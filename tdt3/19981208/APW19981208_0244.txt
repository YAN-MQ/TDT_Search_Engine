Rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army abducted 18 people in an attack 
against a camp for displaced people in northern Uganda, a private 
radio station reported Tuesday. The raid occurred Sunday at Anaka 
camp, about 260 kilometers (160 miles) north of the Ugandan capital, 
Kampala, said the Central Broadcasting Service. It said about 20 heavily 
armed rebels forced the abductees to carry food stolen from stocks 
provided by aid agencies to the people displaced by the 11-year-war 
against President Yoweri Museveni's government by the LRA. More than 
250,000 displaced Ugandans are camped in various parts of the country's 
north and are supposed to be protected by the army. However, the military 
says it is impossible to adequately protect the camps because the 
rebels move in small groups that are not always easy to detect. The 
army says large numbers of rebels have infiltrated the country from 
bases in southern Sudan in recent weeks. Uganda is fighting two other 
rebel groups in western and northwestern regions and has sent troops 
in eastern Congo in an attempt to destroy camps where Allied Democratic 
Forces rebels operate from.
