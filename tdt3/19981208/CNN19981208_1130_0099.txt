Jeanne Meserve has more on what to expect from the hearings over the 
next couple days. After volumes of evidence, hours of testimony and 
almost a year of speculation, opinion and off-color jokes, it is now 
Bill Clinton's turn -- a chance for the White House to formally refute 
Ken Starr and his case for impeachment. Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde 
characterizes the president's defense thus far as Shakespearean -- 
full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. The void is the failure 
of the democrats to call a single solitary witness to repudiate, to 
gainsay, to reject, to disprove any of the facts that have been adduced 
so far. It will fall to White House counsel Charles ruff to do that 
in his summarizing arguments. We will discuss what our view of both 
the facts and the law are in length, in great length, in Mr. ruff's 
presentation. To make its case, the White House has been given two 
days. They could be long, possibly running to midnight. At least 14 
witnesses will be called. None have direct knowledge of the case. 
Three former members of the 1974 Watergate committee, lawyers and 
law professors will discuss the historical precedents and constitutional 
standards for impeachment. I think the essential thing they have to 
show is two things. One, to show that the evidence is not conclusive 
or anywhere near conclusive that the president committed these alleged 
crimes. And two, to remind them that we're talking about impeachment, 
not a Criminal trial. If the White House wants to present its best 
defense, it needs to tell the truth. It needs to cooperate with the 
Judiciary committee. It needs to help the Judiciary committee get 
at the truth. It needs to express remorse after it has told the truth. 
Although it is a foregone conclusion that the committee will vote 
along party lines, there is plenty of drama here, and history. This 
is only the third time Congress has voted on articles of impeachment. 
The fate of a man, and the future of a country, are in play. Jeanne 
Meserve, CNN, Washington.
