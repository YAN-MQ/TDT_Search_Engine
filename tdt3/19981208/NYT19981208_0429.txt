WASHINGTON _ ``Something is actually happening here,'' Rep. Zoe Lofgren 
announced in a tone of quiet amazement, interrupting the nation's 
mood of holiday bustle to voice the growing fears of House Democrats 
that President Clinton could be impeached by Christmas. ``Many in 
the country are not aware of that,'' the California Democrat continued 
wide-eyed before the House impeachment hearing, as if offering disturbing 
news just now dawning. ``They thought it was over.'' That it is far 
from over was made clear as Tuesday's marathon impeachment hearing 
before the House Judiciary Committee ground long and angry without 
a break for 11 hours. Presidential defenders, finally having two days 
to make their case, sent in waves of panelists and stung majority 
Republicans with some rough-edged denunciations of them as cowardly 
partisans and ``vindictive'' lame ducks. The Republicans, in turn, 
accused the witnesses of defending the indefensible in Clinton's sex-and-mendacity 
scandal and rationalizing his evasions. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the 
committee's chairman, announced a tight gavel at the outset and made 
a smiling departure for a long break at the height of the first panel's 
testimony. His vice chairman, Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisc., cut 
off witness answers in enforcing a five-minute limit that angry Republicans 
often consumed in rhetorical questions with no time left for a reply. 
Clearly, not a committee vote shifted either way and, if anything, 
the combative edge of some of the president's defenders only spiked 
the mood of entrenched partisanship as the issue moved toward an expected 
party-line impeachment vote by the committee this weekend. Republicans 
bristled when one of Clinton's most ardent defenders, Princeton University 
historian Sean Wilentz, unapologetically pronounced judgment on members 
who would vote for impeachment despite being unsure of how serious 
the accusations were: ``History will track you down and condemn you 
for your cravenness.'' They sat unmoved by various concessions from 
the president's defenders that Clinton had been ``sinful,'' misleading, 
narrowly accurate at best, blameworthy and ``maddening'' throughout 
the Lewinsky scandal _ all manner of words but ``perjurious,'' the 
key allegation Republicans are honing for the House floor. But they 
were viscerally moved to anger when their motives were described as 
rooted in vindictiveness and ``vengeance'' by the Rev. Robert J. Drinan 
of Georgetown University, a Catholic priest and former congressman 
who voted as a member of the same committee 24 years ago for the impeachment 
of Richard M. Nixon. Drinan predicted ``an explosion of public anger'' 
if Clinton is impeached that would rival the furor over the ``Saturday 
Night Massacre,'' when Nixon purged Justice Department officials trying 
to investigate his misbehavior. ``Did you use the word `vengeance'?'' 
Rep. George Gekas, R-Penn., furiously demanded of the priest. Drinan 
did not retreat and said of his characterization, ``I'll leave God 
to judge that.'' Gekas shot back, ``Then maybe God's messenger should 
not prejudge.'' Most eager in their nostalgia, the Democrats spent 
much of the day reviewing the Watergate crimes and Nixon impeachment, 
arguing that by misleading the nation in his sexual indiscretion, 
Clinton in no way merited impeachment. After months of steeping in 
the furtive tape recordings of the Clinton scandal, the nation was 
treated by the Democrats to a few minutes of selected readings from 
the Oval Office self-recordings of Nixon. (``Damn it, blow the safe 
and get those files!'') ``This panel seems to be saying unless you've 
got the Richard Nixon case you can't impeach anybody,'' Rep. Ed Bryant, 
R-Tenn., complained. Another Republican, Rep. Steve Buyer of Indiana, 
added, ``We don't have a John Dean, someone on the inside to come 
forward.'' Former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, a New York Democrat and 
Watergate impeachment veteran, warned the committee of ``government 
shutdown No. 2'' if impeachment is approved and the Senate has to 
spend months putting the president on trial. ``We never intended to 
create a Grand Inquisitor,'' she said of the independent counsel law 
she helped write for investigating presidents and cabinet officials. 
For all the fresh partisan wrangling, the long day's journey was most 
notable, perhaps, for the pessimistic concessions from various committee 
Democrats that impeachment is certain to be voted swiftly by the committee, 
with the president's survival in a full House floor vote far from 
certain next week. ``The will of the American people is about to be 
ignored,'' declared Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., as Clinton's defenders 
denied they were stepping around the facts of his misbehavior in citing 
opinion polls registering opposition to impeachment. Another Democrat, 
Rep. Tom Barrett of Wisconsin, argued for the path of presidential 
censure but did not sound too encouraged. ``I long ago gave up any 
hope that this chapter of our history would have a happy ending for 
the country,'' he said. The Clinton defense argument was two pronged 
with warnings of the judgment of future historians and current constituents. 
``Your reputations will be darkened,'' insisted Wilentz, the historian, 
to the angry Republicans, while former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach 
testified that impeachment could never succeed without public support. 
``It's a vital fact,'' he told one Republican doubter, ``Those who 
wish to ignore this might remember a quote from Bertolt Brecht, which 
I'll paraphrase: `Maybe we should elect a new public.'''
