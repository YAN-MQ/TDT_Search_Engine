India's homemade Light Combat Aircraft will begin flight trials next 
year and production would begin by 2003, a top defense official said 
Tuesday. Two aircraft _ TD1 and TD2 _ will take to the skies in mid-1999, 
A.P.J.Abdul Kalam, head of the Defense Research and Development Organization, 
was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India at an aerospace conference 
in the southern city of Bangalore. The Light Combat Aircraft, powered 
by the Indian-built Kaveri engine, would be low on cost and high on 
performance, Kalam said. The light fighter project has experienced 
massive technical problems and delays. India is also developing an 
advanced version of the Light Combat Aircraft, a stealthy fighter 
which would be the first multi-role aircraft of its kind in the region. 
The twin-engine, long-range fighter is needed to replace India's Jaguar 
and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft.
