Two top marine generals were called in to testify at Camp Lejune during 
a pretrial hearing today for two aviators. Captains Richard Ashby 
and Joseph Schweitzer are charged in the deaths of 20 cable car passengers 
in Italy. Eileen LeBlanc of member station WHQR reports. The pilot 
and the navigator of the jet, which knocked down a cable car full 
of skiers in the Italian Alps last February 3 are charged with negligent 
homicide and involuntary manslaughter. But their attorneys will ask 
that the charges be dismissed. Lieutenant General Peter Pace and his 
former deputy, Major General Michael DeLong, will appear in court 
next week. Pace was the commander of Marine forces in the Atlantic 
is the convening authority for the court marshal proceedings against 
the two flyers. But lawyers say that he became an accuser instead 
of staying impartial. The judge said that there was political pressure 
after the accident. An earlier testimony revealed concern that the 
Italians might revoke landing rights at the Aviano Air Force base 
where the Marines were stationed. For NPR News, I am Eileen LeBlanc 
in Wilmington, North Carolina.
