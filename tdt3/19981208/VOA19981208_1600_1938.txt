Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister says Iraq will again suspend cooperation 
with the U.N. weapons inspectors. If new inspections, which began 
Tuesday, do not lead to the lifting of sanctions. Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq Aziz told a news conference in Moscow. That Iraq is prepared 
to cooperate with the current round of inspections. But he said they 
must lead to a review of the sanctions next week. He says if the United 
States and Britain insist on keeping the sanctions in place, Iraq 
will ban the inspectors. Iraq halted inspections October 31. And narrowly 
avoided military strikes by reversing the decision two weeks later.
