Germany's Martin Schmitt beat double Olympic champion Kazuyoshi Funaki 
in Tuesday's ski jumping event at Predazzo to clinch his fourth season 
victory and hold a commanding lead in the overall World Cup standings. 
Schmitt, with jumps of 128.5 and 125 meters from the 120-meter hill, 
totaled 253.7 points to edge Funaki by 3.7 points. Funaki, who jumped 
121.5 and 126 meters, led teammates Noriaki Kasai and Kazuya Yoshioka 
who placed third and fourth respectively in an impressive showing 
by the Japanese team. Norway's Lasse Ottesen edged another Japanese 
jumper, Masahiko Harada, for fifth place. Schmitt, who placed third 
to Finland's Janne Ahonen and Funaki at Chamonix in the only World 
Cup event he did not win so far this season, piled up 460 points overall, 
compared with Ahonen's 372 and Funaki's 330. Funaki extended his winless 
streak to five events as he finished second for the second time in 
three days. Other top finishers included Norway's Morten Aagheim (7th), 
Ahonen (8th) and Germany's Sven Hannawald (9th). Austrian great Andreas 
Goldberger ended tenth. The event was held in the north Italian resort 
which will host the world nordic events championships in 2003. The 
next World Cup round is scheduled at Oberhof, Germany, this weekend.
