A day after reshuffling his top staff, President Boris Yeltsin remained 
hospitalized and out of sight Tuesday. The often ailing president, 
apparently tired of being seen as little more than a figurehead, roused 
himself from his sickbed for three hours Monday and dismissed several 
aides, included some who had commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened 
health. But he continued to keep his distance from Russia's pressing 
economic problems. The Russian economy slumped earlier this year, 
partly in response to Asia's economic travails, and plummeted after 
Aug. 17, when the government devalued the ruble and temporarily froze 
foreign debt payments. Yeltsin fired almost his entire cabinet as 
a result of that decision. Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin 
said doctors allowed the president to take brief walks around the 
hospital grounds Tuesday for the first time since he was hospitalized 
with pneumonia on Nov. 22. ``That means he is on the way to recovery,'' 
Yakushkin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. Yakushkin 
said Yeltsin was working on documents, but had no meetings planned 
and would remain hospitalized as long as necessary to recuperate. 
``Pneumonia is an illness that requires a serious treatment and a 
certain regime,'' he said. Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov 
said Yeltsin's reshuffle made no real difference for the running of 
the country. ``He is not governing anything any longer,'' Zyuganov 
said of Yeltsin. ``This is simply an agony.'' Yeltsin sacked his presidential 
chief of staff Valentin Yumashev, and three of Yumashev's deputies. 
A former journalist who was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, 
Yumashev had served as chief of staff for nearly two years _ a lengthy 
stay in Yeltsin's Kremlin. Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary 
of the presidential security council, was appointed the new chief 
of staff. Bordyuzha, who will serve in both posts, immediately called 
for tackling corruption. The Kremlin shakeup dominated Tuesday's headlines 
in all major Russian newspapers, many of whom said the move would 
energize the presidential staff. ``Yeltsin has broken away from the 
doctors' watch and again shown he won't let anyone bury him,'' the 
liberal daily Segodnya said. Yakushkin, the president's spokesman, 
said Yeltsin dismissed the aides because of their failure to stem 
crime and respond to several incidents of political extremism, including 
anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament deputy. However, the 
aides were primarily responsible for organizing Yeltsin's work and 
handling administrative affairs inside the Kremlin, not with issues 
such as fighting crime. The ousters were thought to reflect Yeltsin's 
unhappiness over the aides' candid remarks about the president's health. 
Yumashev and others in the Kremlin have openly said that Yeltsin's 
ailments left him too weak to handle day-to-day affairs. ``In a situation 
when the presidential inner circle starts speaking about the boss 
as if he were a political outsider, you have to replace either the 
president, or his aides,'' the business daily Kommersant said Tuesday. 
``Yeltsin has chosen the second.'' Yeltsin has said and done little 
since the economy went into a tailspin in August, leaving Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov to tackle the crisis. But the president insists he 
will carry out his term until it ends in 2000.
