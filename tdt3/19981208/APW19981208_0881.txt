BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO foreign ministers began the process 
Tuesday of revising the 16-nation alliance's strategic concept, the 
military and political principles that guide the NATO mission. The 
ministers are laying the groundwork for the 50th anniversary NATO 
summit in Washington April 24-25, where leaders are expected to approve 
the alliance's strategy for the 21st century and welcome three new 
members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, into the fold. ``One 
of the special qualities of the alliance has always been its ability 
to react flexibly to new situations,'' German Foreign Minister Joschka 
Fischer told fellow ministers. ``On the eve of the 21st century we 
should ask ourselves if our instruments still match the changed security 
environment.'' Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault 
across the plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional 
conflicts like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons 
of mass destruction. When these threats originate from outside NATO's 
traditional territory of operations, the alliance must be prepared 
to deal with them. In practice, NATO has already adjusted to these 
new realities, intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster 
in Kosovo with the threat of airstrikes, sending soldiers just across 
the Kosovo border in Macedonia to rescue civilian cease-fire monitors 
if needed. ``NATO is already acting out of area, so let's not dramatize 
that,'' said NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana. Added British Foreign 
Secretary Robin Cook: ``I think we have to be pragmatic and grown 
up about this. That will require making a judgment on a case-by-case 
basis.'' Cook stressed the increased role that the Europeans want 
to play in continental security, particularly in cases where the United 
States is less interested in participating. NATO is developing a policy 
it calls the European Security and Defense Identity to deal with that, 
but France and Britain are pressing for the European Union to play 
a role too. ``The focus must be strengthening and improving the European 
security identity,'' Cook said, stressing nonetheless that ``NATO 
will remain the basis for territorial defense for the EU.'' Solana 
said the European Union economic alliance is changing and NATO's plans 
must be adapted to the changes. ``We are trying to reconcile these 
things.'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, writing in the 
British newspaper The Financial Times, said: ``NATO's primary mission 
will always remain defense against aggression. But the founders of 
the alliance also distinguished between what the treaty commits us 
to do and what it permits us to do.'' She said Bosnia and Kosovo are 
recent examples ``that demonstrate NATO must act when conflicts beyond 
its immediate borders affect alliance interests. NATO must find the 
right balance between the centrality of NATO's collective defense 
missions and responding to such crises.'' NATO's central mission will 
always be collective defense and the concept that an attack against 
one member is an aggression against all. But attacks against members 
now take different forms and often originate far away. Albright planned 
to propose at the ministerial meeting here setting up a Center for 
Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially on how to best share and 
use intelligence, officials said. The Germans plan to bring up the 
nuclear first-strike question later in the meeting. Fischer made waves 
when he called on NATO last month to consider dropping its doctrine 
allowing a nuclear first-strike. This doctrine, reaffirmed as recently 
as last year, has always been a part of NATO's nuclear strategy and 
is considered an important aspect of deterrence. ``The minister will 
certainly raise the issue,'' a German diplomatic source said. ``We 
have to see that in the context of arms control, arms reduction and 
nonproliferation.'' The Germans don't have much backing on the issue, 
however. The allies assessed the situation in Kosovo, where Serb security 
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven months. The 
threat of a NATO airstrike stopped the fighting in October and the 
cease-fire is generally holding, while U.S.mediator Christopher Hill 
attempts to firm the peace with political agreement. The ministers 
also made their six-monthly review of the situation in Bosnia. No 
major reduction in the 32,000-troop level in the NATO-led peacekeeping 
force is expected soon.
