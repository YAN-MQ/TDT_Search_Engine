The moment, brief but breathtaking, takes place about two-thirds of 
the way through Jon Alpert's ``Life of Crime 2.'' A 4-year-old, left 
alone by his heroin-dazed mother, balances on the sill of an open 
window. Three stories below looms an asphalt parking lot. In some 
ways the scene defines good documentary filmmaking. Painfully raw, 
it underscores what Alpert, a modern master of cinema verite, has 
spent much of his life chronicling: the lives of three drug-addicted 
petty criminals. Moreover, the unvarnished peril slaps the viewer 
with a moral question about the very nature of the documentary: should 
the filmmaker pull the child back? On the surface, such challenges 
would seem to be the stuff of which award-winning documentaries are 
made. But in fact, the film, which will have its premiere on HBO on 
Tuesday at 10 p.m., is considered unlikely to even be considered for 
an Emmy, a Peabody or any of the dozens of other awards given each 
year for documentary excellence. ``Life of Crime 2's'' subject matter 
_street violence, explicit drug use, raunchy sex _ simply isn't Oscar 
material. ``There is no sense of redemption in this film,'' said Sheila 
Nevins, who for 20 years has run HBO's documentary division, which 
finances a majority of the documentaries made in America. ``That violates 
an unspoken tenet of the traditional documentary world. No matter 
how brilliant you are, no matter how deeply important the film may 
be or how well it reflects contemporary reality, there are some things 
that simply will never be honored. Period.'' The sorts of films that 
win awards, she complains, as do many of the filmmakers she champions, 
are those that present ``uplifting messages on earnest topics.'' Meema 
Spadola, 29, whose film ``Breasts'' was shown on HBO's Cinemax channel 
last year, agrees. ``It's not that there aren't wonderful documentaries 
made about AIDS babies,'' she said. ``It's that the films that are 
more controversial, that don't have the right sort of reverent tone, 
are dismissed.'' Such comments reflect an increasingly loud clash 
in the documentary world between a safe, perhaps middlebrow culture 
and an edgier, more irreverent approach, a discord that often seems 
to underscore generational conflicts as well as commercial and esthetic 
ones. The tension has grown in recent years because the stakes have 
risen. Unexpectedly, documentaries are booming. Not as theatrical 
releases, which still face distribution problems in this era of suburban 
megaplexes, but on television and as video rentals. The explosion 
of cable programming over the last decade has helped create a huge 
market for documentaries and in the process blurred the very definition 
of what makes a documentary, or at least what makes a good one. Today, 
entire channels, like the History Channel and the Discovery Channel, 
are virtually devoted to documentaries. General interest channels 
have also beefed up their documentary offerings. TNT and TBS expect 
to nearly double their documentary production over the next couple 
of years. Perhaps most notable is the success of Ken Burns, whose 
lavish documentaries of the Civil War and baseball defied expectations 
by scoring competitive ratings. ``This is a golden era for documentaries,'' 
said Michael Cascio, a senior programming executive at A&AMP;E. But 
many young documentary makers fret that the burnished glow extends 
only to the safest films. Influenced more by the edginess of independent 
feature films, they say that their work is marginalized because it 
does not fit the conventional mold. The implication, some filmmakers 
say, is that the younger generation of viewers will be turned off 
to documentaries. Many in the documentary world consider it ``a sort 
of disgrace'' for a documentary to be popular, Ms. Nevins said. ``Either 
you are making historical work or you are making inspirational stories. 
There is no room, either in most commercial venues or on the awards 
circuit, for more challenging subject matter.'' Even the International 
Documentary Association, which holds itself up as the arbiter of the 
art of the documentary, has an ``underlying agenda of nobility,'' 
she contends. The result, Ms. Nevins said, is that the IDA Awards 
favor films like HBO's ``I Am a Promise: The Children of Stanton Elementary 
School'' over more controversial fare. Betsy McLane, the IDA's executive 
director, disputes the notion that her organization shies away from 
controversy. ``The only thing I worry about is whether we are doing 
a good enough job recognizing international filmmakers,'' she said. 
Awards hold outsize sway in the life of a documentary maker, not only 
because they are often the only public acknowledgment of a film but 
because awards can directly affect future financing. For many filmmakers, 
however, awards are a double-edged sword. ``Considering the films 
that get honored, I'm not sure it's the kind of recognition you want,'' 
said Nick Broomfield, a maker of controversial documentaries on the 
life of Heidi Fleiss and the death of Kurt Cobain. His most recent 
film, ``Fetishes,'' was shown on HBO. ``There is a disturbing sense 
that the old guard cling to the idea that documentaries should somehow 
be medicinal,'' Broomfield said, ``that they have to be edifying to 
be worthwhile. Ironically, that really violates the very nature of 
documentary.'' The only award Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini 
got for ``Off the Menu: The Last Days of Chasen's,'' a well-received 
but unfashionably piquant film about the closing of the landmark Hollywood 
restaurant, came from the Hamptons Film Festival. ``But even they 
were really nervous about the subject matter,'' Ms. Berman said. ``It 
wasn't enough that it was about some really interesting themes, like 
the obsession with celebrity and the change in the Hollywood old guard. 
It wasn't on the list of pre-approved, really serious subjects.'' 
When it became apparent that their less-than-grave subject matter 
would never cut it with awards judges, one of Ms. Berman's backers 
suggested, only half-jokingly, that they rename the film ``Survivors 
Who Ate at Chasen's.'' To many young documentary makers, there is 
no more trenchant symbol of the clash between the two filmmaking styles 
than the Academy Award for best documentary. The winners have long 
limned _ though often brilliantly _ predictably poignant subjects. 
Last year, ``The Long Way Home,'' a Holocaust documentary, got the 
nod. Other recent winners include ``Maya Lin: A Strong, Clear Vision'' 
and ``Anne Frank Remembered.'' But ``Hoop Dreams,'' the downbeat saga 
of two inner-city basketball players, was never nominated. ``Crumb,'' 
a riveting but scatological look at the art and family life of the 
underground comic book creator Robert Crumb, received the 1995 IDA 
Award, and was named best film of the year by many critics, but it 
didn't crack the Oscar committee's top 15 choices. Even Entertainment 
Weekly, the most mainstream magazine imaginable, loved it,'' said 
Terry Zwigoff, the director of ``Crumb.'' ``So you can imagine I thought 
it was pretty weird that it didn't even get a nomination.'' Frank 
Marshall, a feature-film producer who is on the Oscar documentary 
committee, acknowledges that the academy members who judge the documentaries 
are largely older and tradition-bound. ``They're pretty horrified 
at some of the subjects the younger documentarians choose to work 
on,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter that the way in which those subjects 
is handled is sometimes truly masterful. They can't get past it.'' 
Marshall has been working to change the process, to recruit younger, 
more progressive academy members to judge the documentaries. ``It's 
a cycle that needs to be broken,'' he said. ``Those more open-minded 
members have to find out that there are really incredible films to 
look at it, that some of the best work in film today is being done 
in documentaries.'' There are signs that the documentary old guard 
is opening itself to a more progressive strain. Last month, the IDA 
gave its career achievement award to Ms. Nevins. And while HBO has 
produced more than its share of earnest, heartwarming documentaries 
_ it has received six Oscars for films like ``One Survivor Remembers'' 
and ``Common Thread: Stories From the Quilt'' _ it is also financing 
Ms. Spadola's new film about how men feel about their penises. ``Just 
a few years ago, I never would have gotten an IDA award,'' Ms. Nevins 
said. ``I was scary and bad. I'm still scary and bad, but maybe this 
means not as many people are running away from what I'm trying to 
say.''
