Power has been restored to most of the San Francisco Bay area. Human 
error was behind the black out during the morning commute. From San 
Francisco, The World's Scott Schafer. The black out affected most 
of San Francisco and several suburbs to the south, disrupting trains, 
planes, and cars traveling into the city. The power outage is being 
blamed on a mistake by an electrical construction crew, according 
to Gordon Smith, president and CEO of Pacific Gas and Electric. It 
appears, at this time, that simple human error may have been involved 
in the outage and then triggered a series of events that led to the 
transmission outage. By mid-afternoon, power was restored to much 
of the Bay Area. San Francisco mayor, Willie Brown, said citizens 
responded politely to the disruption. There were no reports of looting 
or other civic disturbance during the blackout. For The World, I am 
Scott Schafer, reporting from San Francisco.
