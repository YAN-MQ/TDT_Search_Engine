Batard-Montrachet 1994, Louis Jadot. About $100. The recent auction 
of 1998 Burgundies in Beaune, France, made it clear that prices for 
these wines were not going to drop in the foreseeable future. Which 
means that if you like great white Burgundy, you are going to have 
to pay dearly to get it. Batard-Montrachet is a great white Burgundy. 
About half of the vineyard is in the town of Puligny-Montrachet and 
half in Chevalier-Montrachet, and it all lies just to the east of 
the Montrachet vineyard, which is generally considered the finest 
white wine vineyard in France. Maison Jadot owns no vines in Batard-Montrachet 
but purchases grapes or wine from others who do. Jadot's wine maker, 
Jacques Lardiere, blends them into a white wine with exceptional concentration 
and elegance. It is equal to and occasionally surpasses the Batards 
of some smaller producers who are known particularly for their white 
Burgundies. Expensive? Yes, but no more than many first-growth Bordeaux 
produced in much larger quantities. This is a wine for very special 
occasions.
