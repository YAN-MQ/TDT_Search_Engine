Before his surrogates began their defense against his impeachment, 
President Clinton began Tuesday determined to avoid any public acknowledgment 
of the principle topic on everybody's mind in Washington. Clinton 
opened the first of two days of seminars on the future of Social Security, 
declaring that there was ``no more important challenge'' facing America. 
Then the president, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton and a large 
group of congressmen, senators and Cabinet members, flew to Tennessee 
late Tuesday morning to attend a memorial service for Albert Gore 
Sr., the former senator and father of the vice president, who died 
on Saturday. The trip forced Clinton to appear earlier than scheduled 
at the conference on Social Security, and forced the Clintons to cancel 
plans to moderate panel discussions on the issue. It also meant the 
president was out of Washington during the bulk of Tuesday's testimony. 
Clinton, smiling and gesturing, boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air 
Force Base just as his special counsel, Gregory B. Craig, wrapped 
up his opening statement before the House Judiciary Committee. Clinton 
made no public remarks on the defense being mounted for him. Nor did 
Mrs. Clinton. But in contrast to other pivotal moments through this 
long year of scandal, when the White House portrayed him as singularly 
focused on the nation's business, the president's aides said Clinton 
clearly felt the seriousness of Tuesday's hearings. ``All of us are 
aware of what's going on with that, including the president,'' one 
aide said of the hearings, where even Craig, his chief defender, repeatedly 
referred to the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky as sinful, 
though not impeachable. Clinton did not watch any of the hearings, 
but a senior adviser, Douglas Sosnik, briefed him on how the testimony 
was going. Inevitably, the hearings overshadowed the debate on Social 
Security, which the White House broadcast via satellite to meeting 
sites in all 50 states. In his opening remarks, Clinton made an appeal 
for bipartisanship in saving the system from insolvency next century. 
``There is in this process no room for rancor,'' he said. ``The stakes 
are too high, the issues far too important.'' After his remarks, Clinton 
appeared distracted, scribbling something into a folder, as congressional 
leaders followed him to the podium. The hearings continued as the 
Clintons returned to Washington from Tennessee early Tuesday evening. 
Together they attended two awards dinners, one by Peace Links, an 
arms control advocacy group, and the other by the National Democratic 
Institute for International Affairs, a nonprofit organization affiliated 
with the Democratic Party that promotes democracy. The institute awarded 
its W. Averell Harriman Democracy Award to Clinton and the leaders 
of the peace process in Northern Ireland.
