The White House opened its formal defense of President Clinton Tuesday, 
addressing in detail for the first time the facts and issues of the 
impeachment case against Clinton and adopting a more conciliatory 
tone in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee. Clinton's 
lawyers and three panels of anti-impeachment witnesses conducted a 
grueling day-into-night tutorial for the 37-member committee on why 
Clinton should not be removed from office for his admitted misconduct 
in the Monica Lewinsky affair. ``Just as no fancy language can obscure 
the simple fact that what the president did was morally wrong,'' said 
Gregory Craig, the White House special counsel who led the defense 
effort Tuesday, ``no amount of rhetoric can change the legal reality 
that there are no grounds for impeachment.'' The president's lawyers 
assembled a battery of witnesses who virtually conceded that Clinton's 
behavior was reprehensible, but said his private misconduct was a 
less grave threat to the nation than preventing the president from 
serving his tarnished final two years in office. The president's defenders 
tried to blur the hard edges of Clinton's fundamental point of defense 
_ that he misbehaved and misled, but did not obstruct justice or commit 
perjury. His conduct was surely sinful, said Craig, but just as certainly 
not impeachable. White House aides said Tuesday night that Clinton 
is likely to make some public comment on the committee's deliberations, 
perhaps offering an additional statement of remorse to temper lingering 
concerns among wavering Republicans. Officials did not say when or 
in what form the president's remarks might come. But even as Craig 
and his swarm of nine friendly witnesses was trying to put a gentler 
face on the president's defense, White House lawyers released a 182-page 
rebuttal that once again harshly attacked Kenneth Starr, accusing 
him of slanting the case against the president by excluding exculpatory 
evidence in his impeachment referral to Congress. The presentation 
from the president's men did not appear to sway any minds on the bitterly 
divided Judiciary Committee. But the debate, which was by turns tedious, 
riveting and mildly salacious, was aimed more at a body of moderate 
Republicans outside the committee who hold in their hands the president's 
fate.
