I'm Bill Hazard, VOA news. U.S. mediator Dennis Ross is beginning 
a mission to the mideast aimed at diffusing tensions between Israel 
and the Palestinians ahead of President Clinton's trip to the region. 
Israel has suspended its promised troop withdrawal from the west bank, 
saying Palestinians must stop their anti-Israel violence and renounce 
plans to declare an independent state. Assistant Secretary of State 
Martin Indek indicates that Mr. Clinton's trip may help resolve some 
of the problems. We are hopeful that we expect that by the time President 
Clinton comes to the region, some of these problems will be resolved 
and his visit will help to resolve the rest of them. U.S. Secretary 
of State Madelaine Albright says Israel must keep to the agreed timetable 
for turning over west bank land.
