The Indiana judge who could return Mike Tyson to prison will await 
the former heavyweight champion's February sentencing on Maryland 
assault charges before making her decision. Judge Patricia Gifford 
followed a recommendation from probation officer George Walker, who 
said in a probation report it ``may be desirable to await the outcome'' 
of misdemeanor assault charges against Tyson in Maryland. Tyson pleaded 
no contest there last week. On Tuesday, the Montgomery County District 
Court in Maryland set Feb. 5 for sentencing, said James Voyles, Tyson's 
Indianapolis lawyer. Walker sent official notice of the Maryland charges 
to Gifford on Tuesday, noting Tyson had completed more than 3 1/2 
years of his four years of probation ``with no criminal arrests, and 
he has been otherwise compliant and cooperative with this officer.'' 
Walker also noted to Gifford that Tyson has completed more than the 
required community service, completed a special counseling program 
for sex offenders and continues weekly counseling. His probation is 
scheduled to expire in March. Tyson served three years for rape in 
Indiana, and Gifford will decide whether he violated terms of his 
1995 parole. Two motorists said he kicked and punched them after an 
automobile accident in Maryland in August. Gifford, who did not return 
a phone call on Tuesday, could have issued a warrant for Tyson's arrest 
or scheduled a hearing on the report from Walker, the chief probation 
officer for Marion Superior Court. Voyles, who represented Tyson at 
his rape trial seven years ago, said he would assist Maryland lawyer 
Paul Kemp at the Feb. 5 sentencing hearing. ``Our position, clearly, 
would be that he's almost at the end of his probationary period, he's 
complied with all terms and conditions of probation up to this point. 
You can anticipate my argument,'' Voyles said. But what happens in 
Maryland could affect Gifford's decision later, Voyles said. ``A probation 
violation can occur by merely having an arrest,'' he said. ``So the 
court has a number of options, and the probation officer has a number 
of options, and so they'll look at it very carefully and make whatever 
decision they think is appropriate.'' Indiana authorities also reviewed 
the probation _ but took no action _ after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's 
ears during a title bout in June 1997. The Nevada Athletic Commission 
stripped Tyson of his boxing license but reinstated him in October. 
Tyson plans to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16. A news conference 
was scheduled for Tuesday in Los Angeles to announce the bout. Walker 
had said last week Gifford will have great latitude in responding 
to his report. ``The judge can do everything from nothing all the 
way to imposing the originally suspended sentence, and anything in 
between,'' he said. Tyson's no-contest plea was not an admission of 
guilt. However, Tyson could face up to 20 years in prison _ 10 years 
on each count _ and be fined up to dlrs 5,000. The two men he scuffled 
with already have agreed to a settlement to avoid a civil suit. Tyson 
is training in the Phoenix area and intends to live there. He already 
has registered as a sex offender in Arizona as part of his planned 
move. Tyson was convicted Feb. 10, 1992, of one count of rape and 
two counts of deviate sexual conduct. Gifford sentenced Tyson to 10 
years in prison and suspended four. He was released from the Indiana 
Youth Center on March 25, 1995, and put on probation for four years.
