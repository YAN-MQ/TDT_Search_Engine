Mayor Richard M. Daley was minutes away from giving a speech last 
weekend when Gina Nikolayerich approached him with an unrelated question. 
She and some neighbors wanted to turn a scrap of land into a tiny 
park. Could he help? Eagerly, Daley pressed for details _ what neighborhood? 
which block? how big? _ and then quickly summoned an aide to take 
down Ms. Nikolayerich's address and telephone number. After the speech, 
Joe Rucci, making a plea for a recreation program for his neighborhood 
school, got the same treatment. ``I'm going to talk to the principal,'' 
Daley replied easily, ``and work something out for you.'' It would 
be easy to suspect that the mayor was merely throwing bones to likely 
voters. Especially since Tuesday, Daley, who has run this rough-edged, 
electric city for nearly a decade, declared that in 1999 he would 
try to win election as mayor for the fourth time. But critics and 
close aides alike say Richard Michael Daley loves this kind of thing, 
listening to the narrow problems of his people and trying to fix them. 
``You kind of keep your ear to the ground,'' Daley said in an interview 
this week. ``And people are very accessible to me. They come up and 
talk to me and tell me some things that sometimes I don't like to 
hear, but they're going to tell me. I say, `Well what's on your mind?', 
take their name and telephone number and get somebody back to call 
them.'' As the son of Richard J. Daley, the legendary Chicago political 
boss and jowly, iron-fisted mayor, young Richard _ nicknamed Rich 
or Little Richie or sometimes R2D2 _ faces repeated comparison with 
his father. Even before his re-election announcement Tuesday, there 
were those who called him Mayor for Life. And there are clearly a 
few echoes of the father in the son, especially the apparently genetic 
propensity to mangle the English language. (``I'm pro-death,'' Richard 
M. once said, referring to his support of the death penalty. And ``What 
do you want me to do? Take my pants off?'' he asked another time, 
after complaints that he had not worked hard enough to get a candidate 
elected.) But this Richard Daley, 56, is different. And not only because 
he is trimmer and moved out of his family's old neighborhood, the 
white ethnic stronghold of Bridgeport. Daley has one reputation his 
father never had. After inheriting a bitterly polarized city, Daley 
has managed to make many of the city's minorities, including black, 
Hispanic and gay people, feel acknowledged and included _ and by extension 
neutralize much of their potential political opposition. Coming into 
office after winning a 1989 special election to serve out the term 
of Harold Washington, Chicago's first and only black mayor, who died 
in office, Daley ultimately won the support of most of the city's 
black aldermen by doling out city services and contracts. He also 
made overtures to Chicago's fast-growing Hispanic population, with 
economic development projects and political posts. ``He has certainly 
reached out _ you see him frequenting the black community, the Latino 
community,'' observed the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said the mayor had 
a ``quilt, coalition-building style.'' He added: ``He's responsive 
when he's called. We have disagreements about things structural, not 
things personal or petty. He's a problem solver as opposed to an antagonistic 
fighter.'' That is significant coming from Jackson, who has decided 
to support the only other candidate who has so far announced his intention 
to seek the mayor's job: Rep. Bobby Rush, the former Black Panther. 
Rush, 52, a Democrat like the mayor, accuses Daley of ``pinstriped 
patronage,'' giving contracts and tax incentives to ``a small group 
of cronies'' and campaign contributors. In his election announcement, 
last month, Rush complained that the Daley administration had ``mishandled 
economic development'' and that ``downtown grows, the Loop flourishes, 
while the city's neighborhoods and communities are neglected.'' The 
election, to be held on Feb. 23, is the city's first attempt at eliminating 
party primaries in the mayor's race. People will be able to vote for 
any candidate they want. If no candidate wins more than 50 percent 
of the votes, the top two voter-getters will have a runoff in April. 
Rush promises to be an energetic campaigner, but most political experts 
give him little chance against Daley, who showed his strength on Monday 
when he filed his election petition with 207,000 signatures on it 
_ eight times as many as required. ``The level of opposition is simply 
not there,'' said Don Rose, a longtime liberal political consultant 
in Chicago who has been critical of some of Daley's policies. ``He 
makes a move and the move is generally popular, and even the jagged 
edges of the opposition are trimmed by it. He has smoothed it off. 
He's defanged the critics.'' Take, for example, those who criticize 
the mayor's well-publicized infatuation for beautifying the city, 
with flowers, street lights, sidewalks and an affection for imitation 
wrought iron. ``There's an increasing preoccupation with the cosmetic,'' 
said Jacqueline Leavy, executive director of the Neighborhood Capital 
Budget Group, a consortium of 200 community organizations. ``Neighborhood 
areas continue to struggle, industry continues to leave for the suburbs 
and our public transportation continues to decline.'' But, Ms. Leavy 
added, ``You cannot look at this mayor without giving him credit for 
things that have been done, especially the schools.'' The schools 
have been a centerpiece of Daley's tenure, and, with unprecedented 
power to appoint the school board and the school system's chief executive 
officer, he has gradually helped raise test scores and improve failing 
schools. ``That's the only way you're going to keep any families in 
cities is basically to improve public schools,'' Daley said. While 
politically astute like his father, Daley is more of a manager, chewing 
on an unlighted cigar while wrestling with nuts-and-bolts problems. 
He has not built major structures, like the new airport he spoke of 
early on, but in this flush economy he has encouraged developers to 
gentrify parts of neighborhoods, including the poor black Lawndale 
section, where he made Tuesday's announcement in a brand new movie 
theater. There are still plenty of problems in Chicago. The city's 
murder rate is likely to be the highest of any major city this year. 
Not enough has been done to address the brutal poverty in the housing 
projects (which were started under his father's watch). And Chicago 
remains one of the most segregated cities in the country. Asked about 
that in the interview, Daley said: ``No you have ethnic communities. 
This idea that Chicago's any different from any other city _ cities 
are all the same.'' But opponents seem relatively isolated, like the 
handful of protesters in a Mexican-American neighborhood who on Saturday 
booed the visiting mayor and his plans to give developers tax incentives 
there. ``Those are some of my admirers,'' Daley mused, unruffled. 
In most of his public appearances, Daley tries to strike a populist 
note. ``I don't think he feels compelled to speak the King's English,'' 
said David Axelrod, the mayor's political consultant. ``He speaks 
the language of the man on the street.''
