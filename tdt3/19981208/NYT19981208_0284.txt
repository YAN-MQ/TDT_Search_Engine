A new guide ranking the 50 top colleges and universities where African 
Americans are most likely to succeed will be published next month 
as a 10-page feature in the monthly business magazine, Black Enterprise. 
Joining a host of national magazines that publish annual college guides, 
including Time, Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report, Black Enterprise 
has ranked colleges based on responses from 1,077 African-American 
professionals in higher education at 987 colleges and universities. 
They assessed things like academic strengths and social environment. 
The study also factored in measurements like graduation rates. Leading 
the list are nine historically black colleges and universities, beginning 
with Spelman College in Atlanta, Morehouse College in Atlanta and 
Florida A&AMP;M University in Tallahassee. After the top nine come 
Stanford University, Georgetown University, Oberlin College and Swarthmore 
College. ``In making our rankings, we separated out the historically 
black schools because they have the overwhelming advantage of having 
the greatest number of black students,'' said Marjorie Whigham-Desir, 
a senior editor who worked on the project. ``That way, they became 
their own category, and so we wound up with what's called a weighed 
model.'' The list and rankings were developed by Thomas LaVeist, a 
professor of health and public policy at Johns Hopkins University 
and CEO of DayStar, the research company that conducted the study. 
The primary criterion, LaVeist said, was that the college or university 
had to be an accredited four-year institution that has an African-American 
enrollment of at least 1.5 percent. If an institution did not meet 
those criteria but was well-known and would be of significant interest 
to black students, it was added to the survey. The educational professionals 
graded the institutions on a scale of 1 to 5 from strongly recommended 
to strongly not recommended. Alfred Edmond, executive editor of Black 
Enterprise magazine, said he hoped that the rankings would stimulate 
the dialogue on how to achieve greater diversity on college campuses. 
Asked if there were any surprises in the rankings, Ms. Whigham-Desir 
laughed and said LaVeist was surprised. ``He went to the University 
of Maryland's Eastern Shore campus, and then got his master's and 
Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, and neither of them showed up 
in the top 50.''
