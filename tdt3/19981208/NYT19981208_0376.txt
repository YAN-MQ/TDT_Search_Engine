Mike Tyson, the former two-time heavyweight champion whose legal status 
is again tangled, Tuesday officially announced his return to the boxing 
ring. Looking physically fit and relaxed, Tyson appeared at a news 
conference to promote a Jan. 16 fight against Francois Botha at the 
MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nev. While Botha was also on the dais at the 
ballroom in the Hollywood Athletic Club, the 20-minute news conference 
was all about Tyson. The Botha fight would end Tyson's 18-month exile 
from boxing, which began after the Nevada State Athletic Commission 
suspended him for biting Evander Holyfield's ears in a June 1997 championship 
fight. Tyson's boxing license was reinstated in October. Tyson's life 
outside the ring became snarled last week in Maryland, when he pleaded 
no contest to misdemeanor assault charges stemming from a traffic 
accident in August. Earlier Tuesday, Marion County Superior Court 
Judge Patricia Gifford in Indiana decided she would wait to rule on 
whether Tyson violated his parole from a 1992 rape conviction until 
he was sentenced in the Gaithersburg, Md., court. Tyson served half 
of his six-year sentence after being convicted of raping a woman in 
Indianapolis in 1991. His probation is set to expire in March. The 
sentencing is expected to take place in February. With his no-contest 
plea, Tyson, 32, could face up to 20 years in prison and be fined 
$5,000. He reached out-of-court settlements with the two men who accused 
him of assault. Tuesday, Tyson refused to answer questions about his 
court case, but said he was pleased to be back. ``I'm not much for 
talking,'' he said. ``You know what I do. I put guys in body bags, 
when I'm right.'' Joined at the news conference by his new management 
team, which included the former basketball star Magic Johnson in an 
as-yet-undefined role, Tyson did not work up a sweat as he evaded 
pointed questions ranging from a possible return to prison to a change 
in boxing style from his unbeaten early years. ``Everybody knows I'm 
on parole and trying to be very nice up here,'' he said with a smile. 
``If I appear to be something you're not acquainted with, understand 
my situation.'' A day earlier, in an interview with The New York Times, 
Tyson briefly addressed the prospects of more prison time. ``If I 
went back to prison, it wouldn't be because I violated anyone,'' he 
said. ``I didn't do anything to go back. If they send me back to prison, 
I can handle it. I'm not a wimp. I'm no chump. I'm not afraid of anything, 
except God. ``As far as going back, they can send me back for 50 or 
60 years; I can deal with that. As long as I can get this fight over 
with and get some security for my family, I can handle that.'' Although 
his handlers insisted this fight was about Tyson's legacy and not 
money, Tyson left no doubt about his motivation when asked at the 
news conference if he would be interested in taking on 48-year-old 
Joe Bugner after Botha, 30. ``If the price is right, I'll fight a 
lion,'' said Tyson, who owes millions to the Internal Revenue Service 
but will earn a reported $30 million for the pay-per-view fight against 
Botha. The South African defeated Axel Schulz in 1995 for the International 
Boxing Federation heavyweight title but had the fight declared a no 
contest when he tested positive for steroids. As the questions continued, 
Tyson appeared to lose interest in answering. ``I'm being a very good 
boy,'' he said when asked about past problems. Asked to explain his 
looser attitude, he said: ``Probation officer. Yeah, I'm having a 
ball.''
