The United States agreed to key symbolic concessions Tuesday on U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas, 
extending a helping hand to an Israeli prime minister under political 
siege. New clashes erupted in the West Bank as domestic pressure mounted 
on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to abandon the Wye River land-for-security 
agreement with the Palestinians. The violence and Israel's political 
turmoil came just five days before the start of Clinton's visit to 
Israel and the Palestinian areas. The trip had been intended to shore 
up the latest Mideast peace agreement. In one of several bouquets 
to Netanyahu, Clinton's top envoy to the region reversed earlier claims 
and said the president had initiated the upcoming visit. ``It was 
frankly an idea that came up from us,'' Dennis Ross said after an 
hourlong meeting in Netanyahu's office. Clinton's visit to Palestinian 
areas is seen by both sides as a state visit to an entity Israel insists 
should not achieve statehood. Earlier U.S. claims that Netanyahu had 
suggested the visit at October's Wye talks angered right-wingers in 
Netanyahu's Cabinet and helped lead to a vote Monday in parliament 
for a no-confidence motion, to take place in two weeks. Netanyahu 
has spent much of this week scrambling for support from both his coalition 
and from opposition parties _ offering apparently contradictory commitments. 
Moshe Peled, a legislator in Netanyahu's coalition who opposes further 
concessions to the Palestinians, told Channel 2 TV he now ``understood 
that the government is determined to stop the (peace) process.'' By 
contrast, a legislator with the Arab Democratic Party said he was 
given assurances that Israel would go ahead with a planned troop withdrawal 
from the West Bank. ``They will implement it, they will overcome the 
problems,'' Abdel Wahab Daroushe told Channel 2. In another symbolic 
concession to Israel, Clinton also decided to land at the newly opened 
Gaza airport in a helicopter instead of in Air Force One. The originally-planned 
Air Force One landing would have been seen by both the Palestinians 
and the Israelis as emphasizing U.S. support for Palestinian statehood. 
Ross also appeared to side with Netanyahu's contention that a recent 
surge in violence in the West Bank was backed by the Palestinian Authority. 
``If you have differences, the place to deal with differences is ... 
at the table,'' Ross said. ``Not on the street, there is no place 
for violence in this process.'' Ross was schedule to dine with Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat later Tuesday. The Palestinian Authority has 
accused Netanyahu of sparking the increased violence by reneging on 
an agreement to release Palestinians jailed on terror charges. Netanyahu, 
who released 250 prisoners last month _ mostly common criminals _ 
says he never agreed to release killers. He said that a promised transfer 
of five percent of the land from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction 
next week would be delayed if the Palestinians did not contain the 
violence. ``If there will not be fulfillment of obligations, there 
will be no withdrawal,'' he said after meeting Ross. Four Palestinian 
students, an Israeli soldier and a Jewish settler girl were injured 
Tuesday in three separate incidents in the West Bank. In the Kalandiya 
refugee camp for Palestinians, hooded high school students ripped 
piping off the rooftop of an abandoned building and tossed it at passing 
jeeps. Israeli troops fired rubber bullets in response.
