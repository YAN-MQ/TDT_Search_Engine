Palestinian hard-liners are to meet in Syria this weekend to affirm 
their allegiance to a charter that calls for Israel's destruction 
_ and to reject Yasser Arafat's move to amend the document. ``The 
meeting will express our rejection of peace agreements with Israel, 
counter Arafat's plan to give legitimacy to Israel's occupation of 
our lands, and reiterate our support for the Palestinian charter,'' 
hard-liner Bahjat Abu Gharbiyeh told The Associated Press in Amman. 
Gharbiyeh, a former member of the Palestine National Council, effectively 
the Palestinians' parliament, is leading a group of 67 Jordanian-based 
delegates to the Dec. 12 conference. More than 300 delegates are expected 
to attend the meeting called by 10 Damascus-based groups at Youth 
City, Damascus. Other delegates are expected from Egypt, Lebanon, 
Europe and North America. The meeting will be chaired by Khaled al-Fahoum, 
a former chairman of the Palestine National Council, said Ali Badwan, 
the spokesman of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 
The hard-liners are urging a boycott of the Dec. 14 meeting of the 
Palestinian National Council in Gaza City, where mainstream Palestinians 
are expected to nullify those parts of the Palestinian National Charter 
that call for Israel's destruction. The hard-liners in Damascus will 
``map out a plan for continued struggle against the Israeli occupation 
(of Palestinian lands) and the rejection of any peace agreement with 
the Zionists,'' Gharbiyeh said. He did not elaborate. Badwan told 
The Associated Press in Damascus that Palestinian leader Arafat should 
not amend the charter while Israel is building settlements on Palestinian. 
The amendment is required by the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords 
of Oslo and Wye River, which was signed by Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. These agreements call upon the Palestinians 
to purge their charter of words that deny Israel's right to exist. 
U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled to attend the Gaza assembly 
in a sign of America's commitment to the peace process. Among the 
participants at the Damascus meeting are leaders who figure high on 
Israel's list of persons wanted for violence. They include Ahmed Jibril 
of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, 
George Habash of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, 
Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, 
and Ramadan Abdullah Shallah of Islamic Jihad. Among the other militant 
groups expected at the conference are Fateh Uprising and Hamas, which 
has carried out a series of suicide bombings in Israel.
