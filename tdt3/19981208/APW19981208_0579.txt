BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
said Tuesday that updating NATO's strategic concept, the alliance's 
guiding military and political principles, is not as critics contend 
an attempt to create a new ``global NATO'' far beyond the intent of 
the original treaty. Foreign ministers from the 16-nation alliance 
met here to lay the groundwork for the 50th anniversary NATO summit 
in April in Washington, where leaders are expected to approve the 
alliance's strategy for the 21st century. Today's threat is no longer 
a Russian tank assault across the plains of Central Europe, but challenges 
from regional conflicts like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the 
spread of weapons of mass destruction. When these threats originate 
from outside NATO's traditional territory of operations, the alliance 
must be prepared to deal with them. In practice, NATO has already 
adjusted to these new realities, intervening in Bosnia, halting the 
humanitarian disaster in Kosovo with the threat of air strikes, sending 
soldiers just across the Kosovo border in Macedonia to rescue civilian 
cease-fire monitors if needed. ``We must be prepared because we know 
that events beyond NATO's immediate borders can affect vital alliance 
interests,'' Albright said. ``Common sense tells us that it is sometimes 
better to deal with instability when it is still at arms length than 
to wait until it is at our doorstep.'' NATO Secretary-General Javier 
Solana said thinking beyond NATO's traditional territory is nothing 
new. ``NATO is already acting out of area, so let's not dramatize 
that,'' he said. Albright responded to suggestions that assuming new 
missions beyond collective European defense is tinkering with the 
original North Atlantic Treaty: ``I've said it before; I will repeat 
it again today: This is hogwash.'' ``I often remind people that a 
ballistic missile attack using a weapon of mass destruction from a 
rogue state is every bit as much a ... threat to our borders now as 
a Warsaw Pact tank was two decades ago,'' she said. German Foreign 
Minister Joschka Fischer said adapting to change has always been one 
of NATO's strong points. ``One of the special qualities of the alliance 
has always been its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' 
he said. ``On the eve of the 21st century we should ask ourselves 
if our instruments still match the changed security environment.'' 
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook stressed the increased role Europeans 
want to play in continental security, particularly in cases where 
the United States is less interested in participating. NATO is developing 
a policy it calls the European Security and Defense Identity to deal 
with that, but France and Britain are pressing for the European Union 
to play a role too. ``The focus must be strengthening and improving 
the European security identity,'' Cook said, stressing nonetheless 
that ``NATO will remain the basis for territorial defense for the 
EU.'' Solana said the EU, Europe's economic alliance, is changing 
and NATO's plans must be adapted to the changes in the EU. ``We are 
trying to reconcile these things.'' Albright proposed setting up a 
Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially on how to best 
share and use intelligence. The plan would use existing NATO headquarters 
staff under one director, with perhaps a few extra experts. The Germans 
planned to bring up the nuclear first-strike question later in the 
meeting. Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider 
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This doctrine, 
reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a part of NATO's 
nuclear strategy and is considered an important aspect of deterrence. 
``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German diplomatic 
source said. ``We have to see that in the context of arms control, 
arms reduction and nonproliferation.'' The Germans don't have much 
backing on the issue, however. The allies assessed the situation in 
Kosovo, where Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas 
clashed for seven months. The threat of a NATO air strike stopped 
the fighting in October and the cease-fire is generally holding, while 
American mediator Christopher Hill attempts to firm the peace with 
political agreement. ``Kosovo is a critical test not only for NATO, 
but for Europe's larger security structure,'' Albright said. The ministers 
also made their six-monthly review of the situation in Bosnia. No 
major reduction in the 32,000-troop level in the NATO-led peacekeeping 
force is expected soon.
