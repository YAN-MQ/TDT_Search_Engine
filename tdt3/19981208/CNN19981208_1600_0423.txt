This is a light duty day for the crew aboard shuttle "endeavour" following 
yesterday's space walk. NASA has confirmed that the Russian and U.S.-built 
parts of the international space station have been successfully linked. 
Yesterday, two astronauts connected 40 cables between the two modules 
during a 7 1/2-hour space walk. In tests, ground controllers in Moscow 
and Houston were able to send data and power through the cables. The 
astronauts also had time to attach hand and foothold sockets that 
will be used by future spacewalkers. When complete, the space station 
will be bigger than two football fields.
