NFL team owners are expected to vote this week or next on the question 
of instant replay. The owners decided not to bring back the video 
review of controversial plays before the season started. But a series 
of poor calls by referees in recent weeks have owners and the league 
reconsidering. The latest bad call came on Sunday during a game between 
the New York Jets and the Seattle Seahawks. A line judge indicated 
that Jets quarterback Vinnie Testaverde broke the goal playing with 
a football to score the winning touchdown. But television replays 
clearly showed he did not score. Testaverde says the referee's call 
was now irrelevant. The angle from the replay was a tough angle for 
viewers to swallow it as a touchdown. But you know, they called it 
a touchdown. Whether you call it a break for the Jets or not is irrelevant. 
We're 9 and 4 and we move forward. If a majority of owners vote yes, 
a limited form of instant replay could be reinstated for the upcoming 
NFL playoffs.
