Belgrade has rejected a peace plan for the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. 
It was presented by American envoy, Christopher Hill, last week. A 
senior Serb official said the American plan amounts to the total reconstruction 
of Yugoslavia. And paves the way for the independence of Kosovo. Ethnic 
Albanians have already rejected the hill plan. They say it makes too 
many concessions to the Serbs.
