Cambridge University won the Bowring Bowl for a record-tying fifth 
time in a row on Tuesday by beating favored Oxford 16-12 in the annual 
Varsity match at Twickenham. Fielding four New Zealanders and three 
Australians, including brothers Hamish and Angus Innes at lock forward, 
the Light Blues of Cambridge tied the record they set twice between 
1972-76 and 1980-84 to maintain their domination over the Dark Blues 
of Oxford. Cambridge now has 56 wins to Oxford's 48, with 13 matches 
tied, in a confrontation first played in 1872. Oxford's 15 included 
center Kurt Shuman, who has won 10 international caps for the United 
States, five Australians and a South African. Oxford had been expected 
to end the Cambridge streak before 60,000 fans at the home of English 
rugby union. The Dark Blues went ahead with a try by winger Nick Booth 
but Cambridge hit back with Mark Denny's score and the two teams went 
into half time tied at 5-5. Cambridge hooker Stefan Rodgers, whose 
father coaches the team, went over for a try five minutes into the 
second half and two penalties from New Zealand fly half Paul Moran 
opened up a 16-5 lead for the Light Blues. In a late rally, Oxford 
winger Nick Humphries scored a try which Booth converted to cut the 
lead to four points but the Cambridge pack kept Oxford pinned back 
to prevent another score.
