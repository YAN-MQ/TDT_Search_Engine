Swiss vintners have been making white wine in this ancient village 
for centuries, and though it doesn't bubble, they call it champagne. 
That pits this hamlet against the makers of French champagne, who 
are renowned for their vigor in preventing anybody else from using 
their name on sparkling wine. The fight is also part of a continuing 
debate among the Swiss about how much they should have to do with 
the European Union, where the French writ on champagne is law. The 
village's 650 residents, a number of whom are employed in activities 
involving the champagne name, are not too happy at the thought of 
being rolled over by the French juggernaut. It is not just a matter 
of brute commercialism, they say; the spat also strikes at their local 
pride and identity. ``We are being told what to do by France,'' protested 
Champagne's mayor, Albert Banderet, gesturing to some of the village's 
65 acres of vineyards, which yield 50,000 bottles of white wine a 
year. ``It's the monarchy all over again.'' There is no chance, as 
the French insist, that consumers will be tricked into buying the 
wrong thing simply because of the champagne label, argues Martial 
Girod, director of the nearby Bonvillars winery, which produces the 
Swiss version. ``It can't be confused with the other champagne because 
it's not bubbly, and it has a screw top, not a cork,'' he explained. 
And Swiss champagne costs only $5 a bottle, around one-sixth the cost 
of a medium-priced bottle of the French stuff. For its part, the French 
champagne makers' association is not swayed by accusations that it 
is heartlessly attacking rural Swiss villagers. ``We also have little 
grape growers in Champagne, which is a mosaic of tiny family plots,'' 
said Daniel Lorson, spokesman for the French producers, who turned 
out 245 million bottles of champagne last year. ``It's our patrimony 
and our collective trademark,'' he continued. ``If we don't defend 
it, in a few years the word `champagne' won't mean anything.'' In 
the Swiss case, champagne makers enlisted the help of the French government. 
Regulations stripping Switzerland of its right to use the name are 
tucked away in the voluminous accords, under negotiation for nearly 
four years, between the Swiss Confederation and the European Union. 
``It's not a big issue, commercially speaking,'' said David Best, 
spokesman for the Swiss Office for European Integration. ``Of course, 
Champagne is seen here as `the little village that resists,' and gains 
sympathy.'' It is more than sympathy that Banderet, who is also a 
grape grower and whose family has been in Champagne for more than 
400 years, wants for his village. ``I don't want to lose our identity,'' 
the portly, gray-bearded mayor said. ``Our village dates from the 
10th century, and we want that respected.'' Little Champagne first 
learned it had an identity problem two years ago when an anonymous 
fax arrived from Bern, said Girod, the Bonvillars wine-maker. ``We 
began to realize we were being sacrificed to other interests,'' he 
said. But the problem actually began in 1974, when Switzerland signed 
a treaty with France covering commercial protection of wine appellations, 
and ``champagne'' did not appear on the list. ``No one cared in 1974, 
no one thought of it,'' Best said. Still unaware or unmindful of the 
village's stake, Swiss officials agreed 20 years later to a bilateral 
accord banning Switzerland's use of the name. The town's only hope 
now is that an exception can be negotiated to allow use of the name 
in smaller letters, with the name Bonvillars in the largest lettering, 
a federal official suggested. Girod said removing the champagne label 
would require finding a new name for the wine, and a marketing campaign 
to advertise it. ``That costs money,'' he noted. Promises that the 
dispute might be solved diplomatically do not sit well with the disenchanted 
villagers. ``This kind of example,'' Girod said, ``does not encourage 
us to belong to Europe.''
