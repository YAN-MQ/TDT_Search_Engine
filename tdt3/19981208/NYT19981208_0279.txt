Video boxed sets materialize at the drop of an anniversary, or given 
almost any excuse, as long as the topic coalesces and the story unfolds 
on two or more cassettes. Major directors, British comedy and theater, 
American retro television, a momentous era, master artists and masters 
of silent film: all make notable boxes this year. In one of them, 
Anchor Bay has put together four Hitchcocks: ``Notorious'' (1946), 
with Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant and Claude Rains; ``The Paradine Case'' 
(1948), with Gregory Peck and Charles Laughton; ``Rebecca'' (1940) 
with Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson, and ``Spellbound'' 
(1945) with Bergman and Peck. For a Preston Sturges centennial, Universal 
has assembled a small festival: ``Easy Living'' (1937), with Jean 
Arthur; ``If I Were King'' (1938), with Ronald Coleman; ``Imitation 
of Life,'' with Claudette Colbert, and ``Never Say Die,'' with Bob 
Hope and Martha Raye. The French director Bertrand Tavernier also 
has a retrospective, including his first film, ``The Clockmaker'' 
(1973), ``L.267'' (1992) and the acclaimed ``A Sunday in the Country'' 
(1984), about a disappointed French painter and the family who never 
quite met his expectations. Neither the Sturges films nor the Tavernier 
titles are in a box per se, but gather them anyway. Already in a slipcase 
are three noir films by Akira Kurosawa, who died in September. ``High 
and Low'' (1962) about a business man (Toshiro Mifune) who raises 
ransom money to rescue the kidnapped son of his chauffeur, is back 
on video after being long out of distribution. ``The Bad Sleep Well'' 
(1960) also stars Mifune, confronting corruption as he swings on the 
corporate ladder. The third film of the set, ``Stray Dog'' (1949), 
about a detective (Mifune again) tracking his stolen gun and a killer 
through post-war Tokyo, is classic noir. Then there are the British 
boxes. As usual, these are filled with first-rate political satire 
and social comedy. Spoofing Victorian society in the guise of Japanese 
musical drama, a tailor rises to the post of Lord High Executioner 
in ``The Mikado,'' one of three operettas by Gilbert and Sullivan 
produced by the Stratford Festival and available in a three-tape set 
from Acorn Media. On the two other cassettes, grand opera takes a 
beating in ``The Pirates of Penzance,'' with rogues and bobbies over-emoting 
on the Cornish coast, and a band of fairies tangles with the House 
of Lords in ``Iolanthe.'' Out in the countryside, a retired English 
army officer administrates the west of Ireland before independence 
in ``The Irish R.M'' (for Resident Magistrate). A PBS Masterpiece 
Theater production, the film comes in a six-cassette box from Acorn. 
Acorn also distributes two boxed sets of ``Mapp &AMP; Lucia,'' about 
two genteel adversaries in the 1920s who, through scheme and social 
con game, vye for social supremacy in the English village of Tilling. 
The scale is intimate in ``Woven by the Grandmothers: 19th-Century 
Navajo Textiles'' and ``Legacy of Generations: Pottery by Indian American 
Women,'' a pair of PBS broadcasts joined in a two-casette box from 
Home Vision. But the view broadens considerably in ``Making Masterpieces'' 
from the National Gallery in London, a three-tape set, also from Home 
Vision. Using the paintings of Rembrandt, Renoir, Holbein and others, 
the series makes fascinating work of such subjects as how an artist's 
materials influence his work and how paintings change over time. One 
could spend at least eight cassettes on topics like that, which is 
what CNN needs for ``The Cold War,'' a superb recent reconstruction 
of the postwar period: Truman's plans and Stalin's demands, MAD (for 
mutual assured destruction), Johnson, Westmoreland and the war we 
can't win, and the Berlin wall, both going up and coming down. The 
events have been covered before, but here, wrote Walter Goodman in 
The New York Times, ``they are infused with fresh drama by newly unearthed 
and reconstructed newsreeels, demonstrating once again the ingenuity 
of enterprising researchers.'' At 19 hours, the set is video's longest. 
Late-night television came of age early in the Cold War era. In ``Jack 
Paar: As I Was Saying ... and More!'', perhaps the consummate talk-show 
host visits with John F. Kennedy, Judy Garland, Bill Cosby, Woody 
Allen and many others on three cassettes drawn from his career in 
the 50s and 60s. The set is distributed by White Star. Other good 
retro television boxes include ``The Very Best of the Mary Tyler Moore 
Show: Party Girl,'' focusing on Mary's disasters while entertaining, 
and ``The Bob Newhart Show: Hi Bob!'' Each has two cassettes of episodes 
and is released by New Video. Those shows have been around in other 
boxes, but ``The Avengers,'' with Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee as 
the quick-tongued private eyes Emma Peel and John Steed, is available 
on video for the first time in a three-cassette box fom A&AMP;E. Less 
talky, is Kino's ``Slapstick Encyclopedia,'' two sets of four cassettes 
each, with Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and dozens 
of lesser-known silent figures. In fact, no one says a word.
