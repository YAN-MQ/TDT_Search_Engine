UN weapons inspectors and Iraq are about to carry out their first 
intrusive checks of sites since the Baghdad government promised cooperation 
last month. The chief UN inspector Richard Butler announced the move 
late Monday, saying the new inspection should take about a week to 
complete. Eventually this could open the way for a comprehensive review 
of Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions and whether to lift economic 
sanctions.
