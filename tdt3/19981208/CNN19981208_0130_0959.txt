Many analysts are speculating the impeachment proceedings against 
president clinton will have a minimal impact on Wall Street. Terry 
Keenan has the story. An impeachment vote may be just a week away, 
but on Wall Street, they're trading sighs of indifference as the interest 
rate on the Clinton scandals has dropped to an all-time low. No surprises, 
no new news. So everybody has probably already priced it in, so it 
won't have an effect on the market now. I would think there'd have 
to be some unexpected news for it to have an impact on the market. 
Everybody's pretty much sick of it and have concluded that he will 
not be impeached. It's a big change from this summer when the specter 
of impeachment, combined with the Russian debt default sent stocks 
plunging and overseas investors running for cover. In the four weeks 
between the president's nationally televised confession on August 
17th and the release of the Starr report, the Dow plunged nearly 800 
points. Today, record highs are back on the Wall Street radar screen. 
Talk of impeachment is not. I honestly don't think that Wall Street 
is focused on this, because they are so convinced it is not going 
to get through the Senate. If that were to change, there might be 
a period of disruption. But for the market to retreat significantly 
from these levels, it would be something other than the impeachment 
hearings. The surprisingly strong economy has also served to inoculate 
the White House from the wrath of the markets. Since mid-September, 
the president has put the economy front and center on his agenda -- 
a move that placed him in a strong position to benefit as the federal 
reserve launched a series of interest rate cuts and the Dow rebounded 
1500 points in the ensuing months. Terry Keenan, "CNN Financial News,"
