This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for tomorrow morning. You can see a cold front across 
the midsection of the nation but not much precipitation at all associated 
with this frontal boundary. Meanwhile, the cold front that moved through 
the east and brought to an end the record-setting warm temperatures, 
continues to push out into the atlantic, carrying the rainfall with 
it. In the west, there's a large area of high pressure in place across 
much of the west. And this means clear skies for many places, but 
temperatures will be quite chilly. Take a look at your forecast for 
high temperatures. In the central Rockies highs only in the 20s. The 
east, warmer than the west, but much cooler than it has been. We look 
now to our extended forecast -- on Thursday, we're looking at a mix 
of showers and thunderstorm along the gulf coast, Louisiana and Texas. 
Temperatures in the west moderate somewhat. As we move on into Friday, 
snow showers are expected in the upper Great Lakes area and thunderstorms 
are possible in parts of the southeast. Again, the west continues 
to warm just a bit. And as we move on into Saturday, you can see snow 
showers again possible in the Great Lakes area. For more weather information,
