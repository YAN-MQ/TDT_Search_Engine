And doctors in Florida say there's cautious optimism about the health 
of New York Yankee's Hall of Famer, Joe DiMaggio. Dr. Earl Bearing 
says the former Yankees outfielder is making progress. After being 
treated for an infection in the past few days. Dr. Bearing said at 
no time was the man known as the Yankee Clipper in a coma. Yesterday, 
he was sedated for purposes of letting him rest. During this difficult 
time when he had fever and some congestion in his lungs. He was at 
no time comatose. He was always arousable. DiMaggio has been in a 
Florida hospital since October. He underwent surgery to remove a cancerous 
tumor from his right lung. And that's a look at sports this hour.
