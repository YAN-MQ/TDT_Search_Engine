There was chaos in San Francisco today. A massive power failure at 
the height of the morning rush hour. Planes, trains and automobiles 
were affected. People were trapped in elevators. There wasn't even 
any coffee to be found. NBC's Kelly O'Donnell has the story of the 
cause, and the effects. Black Tuesday in San Francisco, where daylight 
turned to darkness. Morning commuters, trapped in a tunnel on a city 
train led to safety by flashlight. At 8:15 this morning, the clocks 
freeze, the lights go out. A "major outage," the blackout shuts down 
power for 375,000 customers of pacific gas and electric, countless 
more affected over 49 square miles. I work on the 20th floor. I had 
to walk down 20 plus flights of stairs. Terrible. Chaos in the morning 
commute. With all downtown traffic lights dark, the Snar lh@E xhRHLH@Z 
; yhRH leads to a serious accident. One woman, struck and critically 
injured by a big rig. This morning, buses and trolley cars stopped 
in their tracks. The commuter train system, known as B.A.R.T., ground 
to a halt. With as many as 40,000 passengers on board, some trapped 
for up to 40 minutes. No easy way out, even at the airport, where 
passengers wait for flights delayed up to four hours. We diverted 
18 aircraft during the hour to salt lake to San Jose to Phoenix to 
Seattle. What caused this mess? Human error. Construction at a power 
substation in San Mateo, power company officials blame their own workers, 
saying they didn't follow procedures and caused the system to blow. 
The blackout jolted business around the city. The pacific exchange 
took an unexpected holiday too. For the cash-strapped, no help from 
unhundreds of automatic teller machines out of order. San Francisco 
mayor Willie brown. We are doing what we can to make life as normal 
as can be humanly possible. Getting back to normal is just a matter 
of time. Officials predict power will be back this evening. Kelly 
O'Donnell, NBC news, San Francisco.
