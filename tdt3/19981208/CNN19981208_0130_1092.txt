The Buccaneers try to keep their playoff hopes alive. Monday night 
football highlights, next. Later -- an old movie house, restored to 
its former glory. I work out to keep my body in shape. To help keep 
my mind sharp I take new quanterra ginkgo biloba. It helps me concentrate, 
MAINTAIN focus. Why quanterra? All ginkgos aren't the same. The patented 
quanterra extract was proven safe and effective by doctors in extensive 
clinical trials. And it increases oxygen supply to the brain. With 
new quanterra mental sharpness I feel my best, naturally.
