European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Tuesday he saw 
no risk of deflation for the European economy despite the expected 
slowdown of growth next year. Duisenberg gave a generally sober assessment 
of the economic situation in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as 
their common currency on Jan. 1. ``The risks are on the downside. 
Every single figure that becomes available confirms that more and 
more,'' Duisenberg told a European Parliament committee. He said inflation 
was under control in the euro-zone. Although the bank projected a 
rise from 1.2 percent to 1.6 percent next year, he saw no danger of 
price increases exceeding the ECB's upper limit of 2 percent. Duisenberg 
said the threat of deflation, or falling prices, brought about by 
an economic slump, was ``as much as an evil as inflation,'' but he 
added ``at this time, there is no danger of deflation.'' He forecast 
growth across the 11-nation bloc would slip to 2.4 percent next year, 
compared to 2.8 in 1998. Although a recovery is predicted in 2000, 
Duisenberg said ``the uncertainties are too great and the risks too 
large to attach too much importance to that.'' Sluggish growth means, 
the euro-zone's persistently high unemployment will dip only ``marginally'' 
from 11.8 percent to 11.2 in 1999, he said. Duisenberg chastised euro-zone 
nations for not loosening rigid labor market rules to help create 
jobs. ``If governments really want to bring down their unemployment 
rate, they must be willing to contribute to reform ... of markets, 
particularly labor markets.'' He also expressed concern that euro-zone 
governments for not striving hard enough to balance budgets. Duisenberg 
reiterated the ECB plan to keep the key euro-zone interest rate at 
the current 3 percent level for ``the foreseeable future.'' He said 
sticking to the rate set last week by all the euro-zone nations, expect 
Italy, will reduce market uncertainty. ``We intend to keep them there 
for the foreseeable future ... to give markets a sense of continuity 
and stability,'' he said. However he added, ``how far we can foresee, 
I cannot tell you.'' On relations between the euro and the dollar, 
Duisenberg said he was pleased with the recent lack of major exchange-rate 
swings and expressed hope stability would continue after the euro's 
launch. ``Volatility has been rather subdued, which I think is good 
for the European and the U.S. economies.''
