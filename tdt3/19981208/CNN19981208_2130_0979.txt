If you're struggling to find the perfect present for someone on your 
holiday shopping list, consider travel. Stephanie Oswald has some 
suggestions in this edition of "working ahead." It's an exciting gift 
to get because it means an adventure, it means a Trip. The American 
society of travel agents says travel gifts top most people's wish 
lists. You can do something in just about any price range. I mean, 
you can buy a $10,000 cruise all the way down to a $10 gadget in a 
Travel store. You don't have to worry that they're already going to 
have it. Everybody has a trip they have yet to take. Asta says most 
people want cruises, followed by gift certificates, trips to Las Vegas 
and Disney, then weekend getaways, airline tickets and hotel packages. 
Online travel sites such as msn expedia offer a wealth of travel experiences, 
from golf trips to ski adventures. An all-in-one inclusive vacation 
-- something where they can take their family or take friends, take 
loved ones along with them. But a gift certificate may be the best 
present. People can then use it at their convenience, ultimately, 
and to go where they want to go. Many airlines, hotels and cruise 
lines offer gift certificates or buy one from a travel agent for a 
complete vacation package. Keep in mind, most certificates expire 
within a year, blackout dates may apply and trips taken with certificates 
won't earn the recipient frequent-flier miles. But you might earn 
airline miles or hotel points buying the certificate, giving yourself 
a little gift. Stephanie Oswald, CNN, reporting.
