1998 spelled the demise of a downsizer. We put the spotlight on rambo 
in pinstripes, Al dunlap. If one man sim localized the down sizing 
trend, it was Al donelap. He was known as a pit bull who would attack 
any cause to protect shareholder value. His biggest stage was sunbeam, 
an appliancemaker, badly in need of a Makeover. I've taken on jobs 
that no one else wanted. And I think my basic skill has to do with 
turning around failing companies. At first, dunlap's strong medicine 
appeared to work. He cut sunbeam's workforce in half and drove its 
stock from $12 to $50 a Share. But 21 months into the job, the trouble 
started. A stunning first-quarter loss. Then, allegations that previous 
profits had been inflated. And, fijly, the board fired Al dunlap's. 
It's a sad ending to what at times have definitely been an illustrious 
career as a turn-around artist. It's not the first time he did near-term 
shoring up of a company to see it crumble later. He insisted he had 
not cooked the books. I am outraged that people say they can't believe 
the numbers. As I sit here tonight, Lou, I absolutely believe those 
numbers. But in fact, the numbers were a myth. When sunbeam restated 
its earnings, more than half of its 1997 profits had disappeared.
