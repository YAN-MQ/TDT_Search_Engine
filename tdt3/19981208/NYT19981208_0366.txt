Joe DiMaggio's condition was so bleak on Monday that his doctor advised 
that family and close friends be called to his side for his possible 
death. Tuesday, with the 84-year-old former Yankee center fielder 
having rallied overnight, Dr. Earl Barron apologized to those same 
people. ``There's a whole load of family here,'' Barron said. ``I 
told them this morning, `Look, I could no way have anticipated how 
this was going to go. I just have to call it the way I see it.' That's 
why I had these people come in. Because yesterday it really looked 
dire. But if it were today, I would not have said that.'' DiMaggio, 
who has been in Memorial Regional Hospital here since Oct. 12 while 
battling pneumonia and the effects of lung cancer surgery, still is 
in critical condition, Barron said. But his condition has stabilized. 
``Joe had a terrific night,'' Barron said. He said the doctors were 
cutting back on DiMaggio's sedation and some medication, and ``he's 
a little bit more alert.''
