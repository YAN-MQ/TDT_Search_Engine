Days before a house committee votes on Articles of Impeachment against 
President Clinton, his lawyers continue their defense. NPR's Steve 
Insky reports. His lawyers insist the president made evasive, misleading, 
maddening statements under oath and that he is really sorry, but that 
he did not commit perjury. As White House lawyer, Greg Craig, spoke 
to a house committee, republican Howard Coble asked why the president's 
testimony contradicts that of his former intern, Monica Lewinski. 
Do you have any opinion, Mr. Craig, as to who is lying? It is an oath 
on oath, he says, she says, situation. This is hardly, I think, the 
kind of issue that the House of Representatives should send to the 
Senate for a trial before the American people to determine whether 
or not the President of the United States should be removed from office. 
The White House has delivered a legal defense of the president about 
as thick as a novel. Presidential supporters hope to persuade moderate 
republicans to vote against impeachment, if the issue reaches the 
house floor. Steve Insky, NPR News, Washington.
