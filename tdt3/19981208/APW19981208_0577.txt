Mathias Fredriksson knocked out his brother Thobias in the semifinal 
round on his way to victory in a ski cross country sprint event Tuesday 
which vaulted him atop the World Cup standings. The first ever victory 
in the yearly competition gave the 25-year-old Swede 150 points and 
the overall lead after two races. Fredriksson had placed fourth in 
the season opener at Muonio, Finland, a 10-kilometer freestyle race 
won by his teammate Per Olofsson last month. Olofsson was eliminated 
in the very first round at the Milan meet. Fredriksson won the two-way 
sprint final against Peter Schlickenrieder when his German opponent 
took the wrong way in the next-to-last of four laps while surprisingly 
leading the favored Swede. Also the women's final, won by Norway's 
Anita Moen-Guidon, was decided by a mishap. Slovenian Andreja Mali 
fell a few meters from the finish line, while trying to fight off 
the strong comeback of the Norwegian skier. Italian favorite Stefania 
Belmondo fell and was eliminated in the first round of sprints. Thobias 
Fredriksson, who lost the semifinal following a shoulder-to-shoulder 
duel with his brother, still earned the podium by beating Norway's 
Odd-Bjorn Hjelmeset for third place. Another Norwegian, Tor Arne Hetland, 
placed fifth ahead of Ari Pololahti, the Finnish winner of the Milan 
sprint race last year. Pololahti was also victim of a mistake when 
he headed toward the finish line one lap too soon. The sprint races 
were held at an indoor area usually hosting the Milan ready-to-wear 
fashion shows in spring and autumn. Skiers competed on artificial 
snow over four laps, for a distance of one kilometer. Mathias Fredriksson 
said he was surprised with his victory and with his semifinal success 
against his brother. ``Normally Thobias is faster in sprints ... In 
this kind of race you must be lucky to start in front and take good 
turns,'' he said. The Swedish skier added things may change quickly 
atop the World Cup standings, beginning with the next races scheduled 
at Toblach (Dobbiaco), Italy, this weekend. Tuesday's victory, also 
a first for Moen-Guidon, gave the Norwegian skier second place in 
the women's overall standings at 114 points, behind Katerina Neumannova. 
Neumannova, a Czech, piled up 140 points from a victory in Muonio 
and fourth place in Tuesday's sprint. Moen-Guidon said she was lucky 
to win. ``When I saw her falling I was happy to be first ... I always 
thought it was not finished before the line,'' Moen-Guidon said. Tuesday's 
sprints were deserted by Russian athletes and by Norwegian great Bjorn 
Dahlie.
