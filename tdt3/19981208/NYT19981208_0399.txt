Officials of the Nasdaq stock market and Broadcast.com plan to test 
a program they hope will encourage publicly traded companies to make 
quarterly earnings conference calls accessible over the Internet. 
Nasdaq president Alfred Berkeley III described Internet broadcasting 
as a way to level the playing field for individual investors who do 
not have access to the same company data as institutional investors. 
With Internet broadcasting, anyone with a computer and an Internet 
connection could participate in an earnings call with executives. 
Many public companies already broadcast their quarterly earnings conference 
calls over the Internet. For the pilot program, Nasdaq will offer 
its top 100 companies four live audio broadcasts of quarterly earnings 
calls each year. Eventually, Nasdaq and Broadcast.com hope to make 
the service available to all Nasdaq companies. To take part in an 
Internet call, investors will sign on to the Web site of either Broadcast.com 
or Nasdaq, where they can listen and ask questions, much as they would 
during a telephone conference call. Neither company would disclose 
specific terms of the deal, but Broadcast.com is charging Nasdaq a 
licensing fee for its services, which Nasdaq will offer free to participating 
companies.
