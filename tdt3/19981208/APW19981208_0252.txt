A day after reshuffling his top staff, President Boris Yeltsin remained 
hospitalized and out of sight on Tuesday. The often ailing president, 
apparently tired of being seen as little more than a figurehead, roused 
himself from his sickbed for three hours Monday and dismissed several 
aides, included some who had commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened 
health. ``The president wanted to show who's the boss,'' said Alexander 
Shokhin, leader of a pro-government faction in parliament and, until 
recently, a steady Yeltsin ally. ``He's like a lion who licked his 
wounds and now roared at those who thought he was already out of the 
game.'' Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said doctors allowed the 
president to take brief walks around the hospital grounds Tuesday 
for the first time since he was hospitalized with pneumonia on Nov. 
22. ``That means he is on the way to recovery,'' Yakushkin was quoted 
as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. Yakushkin said Yeltsin was 
working on documents, but had no meetings planned and would remain 
hospitalized as long as necessary to recuperate. ``Pneumonia is an 
illness that requires a serious treatment and a certain regime,'' 
he said. Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Yeltsin's reshuffle 
made no real difference for the running of the country. ``He is not 
governing anything any longer,'' Zyuganov said of Yeltsin. ``This 
is simply an agony.'' Shown on television Monday evening, Yeltsin 
appeared energized as he scowled and delivered one of his patented 
tirades. ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin 
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of 
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling notes. 
``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin said, according to Yakushkin. 
Yeltsin sacked his presidential chief of staff Valentin Yumashev, 
and three of Yumashev's deputies. A former journalist who was the 
ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev had served as chief of 
staff for nearly two years _ a lengthy stay in Yeltsin's Kremlin. 
Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential security 
council, was appointed the new chief of staff. Bordyuzha, who will 
serve in both posts, immediately called for tackling corruption. The 
Kremlin shakeup dominated Tuesday's headlines in all major Russian 
newspapers, many of whom said the move would energize the presidential 
staff. ``Yeltsin has broken away from the doctors' watch and again 
shown he won't let anyone bury him,'' the liberal daily Segodnya said. 
Yakushkin, the president's spokesman, said Yeltsin dismissed the aides 
because of their failure to stem crime and respond to several incidents 
of political extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist 
parliament deputy. However, the aides were primarily responsible for 
organizing Yeltsin's work and handling administrative affairs inside 
the Kremlin, not with issues such as fighting crime. The ousters were 
thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness over the aides' candid remarks 
about the president's health. Yumashev and others in the Kremlin have 
openly said that Yeltsin's ailments left him too weak to handle day-to-day 
affairs. ``In a situation when the presidential inner circle starts 
speaking about the boss as if he were a political outsider, you have 
to replace either the president, or his aides,'' the business daily 
Kommersant said Tuesday. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.'' Yeltsin 
has said and done little since the economy went into a tailspin in 
August, leaving Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to tackle the crisis. 
But the president insists he will carry out his term until it ends 
in 2000.
