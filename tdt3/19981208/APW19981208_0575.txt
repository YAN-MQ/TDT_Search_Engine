Somersaulting, jumping and vaulting in a league of their own, China's 
teen-age women gymnasts captured team gold Tuesday at the Asian Games, 
giving China its seventh consecutive sweep of both the men and women's 
team events. Japan captured silver, bettering the bronze clinched 
by the men's team in its close battle with South Korea on Monday. 
Kazakstan won bronze, edging out Uzbekistan by less than half a point. 
But it was the Chinese in their bright yellow and red outfits who 
stole the evening. After just two of the four disciplines, the Chinese 
had opened a four-point gap over the Japanese and were already giving 
each other high fives. By the end of the competition, the gap was 
more than seven points. Four members of China's squad had captured 
team bronze at last year's World Championships, but the newcomers 
were impressive too. Xu Jing, a shy 16-year-old who has been with 
the team just six months, scored 9.8 with a nearly flawless display 
of soaring somersaults and grace on the floor. Ling Jie, another 16-year-old 
in just her second major competition, broke into a beaming smile after 
an excellent uneven bars routine that scored 9.825. She was also the 
night's leading scorer, heading a Chinese 1-2-3 at the top of the 
individual standings. Veteran Liu Xuan, the team's oldest member at 
19, also was delighted after an almost flawless routine on the balance 
beam that finished with a soaring double somersault and scored 9.85. 
``No problem there,'' said Qian Kui, the head coach. ``She didn't 
wobble.'' The team's strong performance cleared the way for the possibility 
of more medals for China in the individual competitions. The top 24 
gymnasts qualify for Wednesday's contest to find the best all-around 
gymnast, and the top eight in each discipline also qualify for apparatus 
finals Thursday. China's women won all six gymnastics gold medals 
at the last Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. The men and 
women have also won every team event since 1974. North Korea, back 
in the Asian Games after skipping 1994, fielded a team including some 
members who looked underage. Coaches, doctors and officials questioned 
whether some of the tiny North Korean girls, who urged each other 
on with high-pitched squeals, had reached the regulation age of 16. 
``They look noticeably young,'' said Jackie Fie, an official from 
the sport's governing body, the FIG. ``They look 11.'' ``Not yet,'' 
she replied when asked whether any of the other teams had complained. 
North Korea was once banned from a World Championships after officials 
discovered age discrepancies with some its gymnasts, she said. A North 
Korean coach and gymnasts refused to answer reporters' questions. 
The team finished fifth, ahead of last-place Thailand. South Korea's 
women won team bronze in 1994, but they did not field a full squad 
at these games because four gymnasts tested positive for banned substances 
ahead of the competition, a South Korean coach said.
