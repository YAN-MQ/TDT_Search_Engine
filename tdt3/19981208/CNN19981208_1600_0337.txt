It appears human error caused the power failure that is disrupting 
the daily routine in San Francisco. Pacific gas and electric says 
a construction crew made a mistake while working at a substation. 
It shut down and triggered a chain reaction that knocked out power 
to nearly 400,000 customers during the morning rush. 50 high-rise 
buildings have elevators stuck, with an unknown number of people trapped 
inside. Firefighters are working with elevator companies to get them 
out. Traffic lights went dark during rush hour, snarling traffic across 
the city. The blackout also knocked out the subway system and virtually 
shut down San francisco international airport.
