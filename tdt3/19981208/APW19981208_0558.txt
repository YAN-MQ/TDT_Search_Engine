Russian oil companies bought more than one-third of the oil that Iraq 
sold over the past six months under its oil-for-food program with 
the United Nations, a news report said Tuesday. The purchases by the 
13 Russian oil companies, including powerhouses Sidanko and Lukoil, 
totaled 107 million barrels worth dlrs 1.25 billion, or 35 percent 
of all Iraqi oil sold abroad, the Interfax news agency said. Iraq 
is under comprehensive U.N. sanctions, but is allowed to export limited 
quantities of oil to buy food and medicine. Russia is one of the world's 
largest oil producers and exporters. But its oil companies have been 
buying Iraqi oil because they want to maintain close ties and hope 
to rebuilding Iraq's oil industry when United Nations sanctions are 
lifted. However, the United States continues to support sanctions 
against Iraq and says the Arab nations continues to conceal its weapons 
program from U.N. inspectors. The sanctions, imposed in response to 
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, are to remain until the inspectors 
certify that Iraq has dismantled its program for making weapons of 
mass destruction. Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is currently 
visiting Russia. Moscow has called for a ``comprehensive review'' 
of Iraq's compliance with United Nations resolutions, saying this 
should help wrap up seven years of U.N. weapons inspections. Aziz, 
meeting with teachers and students at Moscow's Institute of International 
Relations on Tuesday, stressed the two countries have strong economic, 
political and cultural ties. ``We have common objectives and common 
interests,'' Aziz said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``Let 
us preserve, expand, and strengthen them.'' Iraq agreed to resume 
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors last month after a confrontation 
that nearly led to military strikes by the United States.
