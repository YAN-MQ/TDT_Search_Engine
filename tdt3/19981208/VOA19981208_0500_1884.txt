The Israeli parliament has postponed a decision to force early national 
elections, giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu two more weeks 
to shore up his shaky coalition government. A majority in parliament 
was preparing to vote for early election legislation Monday, when 
a small religious party in the Netanyahu coalition called for a no-confidence 
vote. The parliamentary maneuver postponed for a week the vote on 
the election bill. Parliament then agreed to delay voting for another 
week until after President Clinton's visit. Mr. Netanyahu faces mounting 
anger from right wing parties and members of his own cabinet who oppose 
the latest peace deal with the Palestinians. Political analysts say 
the prime minister now is likely to adopt a tougher stance toward 
the Palestinians to maintain right wing support for his government.
