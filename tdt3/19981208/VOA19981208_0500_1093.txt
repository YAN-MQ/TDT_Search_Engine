Quarterback Trent Gilforth through a pair of touchdowns and ran for 
one himself to lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers past the Green Bay Packers 
24-22 in Monday night National Football League action. Green Bay quarterback 
Brett Farr also passed for two touchdowns, but he had trouble, fumbled 
six times, one short of the NFL record. The victory improves Tampa 
Bay to 6 and 7 and keeps their slim playoff hopes alive. Green Bay 
falls to 8 and 5 and missed a chance to clinch a wild card berth in 
the playoffs, but they'll get another chance next week.
