Call it focusing by spreading out. Tuesday's multibillion-dollar pact 
between AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest communications carrier, and 
IBM, the No. 1 computer company, was AT&AMP;T's fourth major deal 
this year. In each, C. Michael Armstrong, who signed on as chairman 
just 13 months ago, has moved his company into a new area of communications. 
Since January, AT&AMP;T Corp. has agreed to spend more than $43 billion 
in cash and stock to acquire a big local communications carrier and 
the nation's No. 2 cable television operation. It also forged a $10 
billion international joint venture with British Telecommunications 
PLC. And now, in a deal that was hammered out under the code name 
Project Double Helix, AT&AMP;T is set to spend $5 billion in cash 
for one of the best global data-communications systems. While all 
the deals might seem to be pulling AT&AMP;T in haphazard new directions, 
the company has actually narrowed its business sharply in the last 
few years. As recently as the early 1990s, AT&AMP;T was far more than 
a communications company. It made telephones. It ran satellites. It 
made computers. It sold credit cards. All those operations are now 
gone _ and prospering after the spinoffs. Stock of NCR Corp., once 
AT&AMP;T's computer arm, has vastly outperformed AT&AMP;T's shares 
this year, and Lucent Technologies Inc., once AT&AMP;T's communications-equipment 
unit, now has a market value larger than AT&AMP;T's. In their place, 
the company has added units selected to advance a single mission: 
providing communications services, though in a broader fashion than 
at any time in AT&AMP;T's history. It is all part of a paradox of 
the information age. Even as all sorts of high-technology products 
seem set to converge into one digital service and one digital economy, 
many of the companies that actually provide ``this stuff,'' as Unisys 
Corp. has taken to calling it, are actually de-converging themselves, 
zooming in on what they do best and shedding the rest. The market 
certainly endorsed that concept Tuesday, and on a generally pessimistic 
day for stocks. On the New York Stock Exchange, AT&AMP;T's shares, 
the most widely owned in the nation, rose $2.25, to $67. Shares of 
IBM, which hopes to sharpen its own focus by shedding its network, 
rose $1, to $168.18. To people outside the technology world, the difference 
between designing and running big communications systems (like AT&AMP;T) 
on the one hand and making computers and running big data warehouses 
(like IBM) on the other might not seem much of a difference at all. 
But they are essentially separate industries. ``I very much believe 
that technology is promoting the convergence of communications, of 
computing, information, of entertainment, of data,'' Armstrong said 
Tuesday in a telephone interview. But in the next breath, he added: 
``It's a matter of being able to deploy resources. The growth of the 
industry is so great that no company could encompass all the elements.'' 
That realization had dawned on both parties to the sale. By selling 
its communications grid, IBM will get out of a business that just 
a few years ago it saw as vital. Instead, Big Blue will concentrate 
on consulting and making and managing big computers. AT&AMP;T will 
serve not only IBM's existing communications customers but IBM's corporate 
communications needs as well. Likewise, while AT&AMP;T agreed to acquire 
IBM's network for $5 billion, it also agreed to turn over to IBM more 
than 2,000 of its own employees and to hire IBM to handle its software 
operations and to run its massive computer centers, which handle millions 
of customer records. Those are corporate functions that for decades 
AT&AMP;T insisted on performing in-house. People involved in the deal 
said that the code name Project Double Helix was meant to convey a 
perfect fit. But it could also convey an unraveling and recombination 
of the companies' basic blueprints. Armstrong said Tuesday that AT&AMP;T 
had been planning for several years to outsource its computer operations, 
but the prospect of winning the auction for IBM's network accelerated 
those plans, at least partially. ``We've come full circle,'' said 
Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a technology 
consulting firm in Boston. ``It was only four years ago that AT&AMP;T 
was offering to manage your data center and IBM was offering to manage 
your network. Now it's stick to your knitting. Both companies have 
pretty much grown out of the idea that they can be in the other guy's 
business and be all things to all people. IBM knows more about running 
computers, and no one knows more about running networks than AT&AMP;T.'' 
IBM also faced the prospect of spending millions, perhaps billions, 
to keep its network current with the latest advances in Internet-based 
data communications. At one time making big bets like that made sense 
for IBM. When the computer giant began assembling its network in the 
late 1970s, there was no such thing as a global data communications 
network. National phone monopolies prevented companies from moving 
into each other's territory. IBM, however, had deployed mainframe 
computers all over the world for big corporations, and those corporations 
wanted those computers to communicate with one another. So IBM patched 
together a network of its own, relying on as many as 1,000 phone companies 
around the world for the transmission of information from one point 
to another. Philip Carden, a consultant for Renaissance Worldwide, 
a consulting firm based in Boston, said that IBM served an essential 
function (and could charge for it) in getting all of the world's different 
network languages to work together. But now, as deregulation frees 
big phone companies to expand around the globe and as the world moves 
toward relatively simple data communications standards based on the 
Internet, it makes less sense for IBM to invest in upgrading its systems 
At a news conference Tuesday, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner Jr., said: 
``We decided, in a sense, we don't want to compete with our customers, 
and it doesn't make sense for us to make that investment when the 
telecommunications companies whose core competencies it is are going 
to make it. Building networks and managing networks are not our core 
competency.'' John McKinley, chief technology officer for Merrill 
Lynch &AMP; Co., can certainly understand that reasoning. Merrill 
Lynch is just the sort of big corporate customer that every high-technology 
company wants for a client _ and it uses IBM to manage its computer 
centers and AT&AMP;T to manage its communications network. ``When 
you think about succeeding today in the service economy, you need 
scale and you need specialization,'' McKinley said. ``I think this 
latest transaction lets both IBM and AT&AMP;T enhance their core competencies. 
I think it gives them more focus.''
