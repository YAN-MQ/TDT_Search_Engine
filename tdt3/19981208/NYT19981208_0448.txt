Jim McMahon, the able quarterback for Brigham Young University and 
six professional teams, including the Chicago Bears, blended his famous 
irreverence with maturing humility and candor Tuesday as he addressed 
the topic, ``What Has Football Meant to Me?'' The occasion was a luncheon 
of the National Football Foundation at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel preceding 
the 41st annual awards dinner. McMahon was one of 13 inductees to 
the College Football Hall of Fame. Also present were the 17 senior 
football players who have won $18,000 post-graduate fellowships given 
by the foundation. ``I went to school to play ball,'' McMahon, wearing 
a black sweater jacket and a gold ring in his left ear, told a rapt 
audience. ``I never really liked school. I was not a guy who could 
sit all day in a classroom and keep interested.'' McMahon, now 39 
and the father of four in Northbrook, Ill., outside Chicago, grew 
up in San Jose, Calif. He soon learned, he said, that he had to do 
some studying, ``to get the grades to play.'' ``I went to college 
for five years, and I never got a degree,'' McMahon said. ``I always 
figured work was overrated. I'm lazy.'' After Brigham Young, where 
he was another in a long line of outstanding passers, McMahon played 
for 15 years in the National Football League, leading the Bears to 
a Super Bowl victory in 1986. There were many injuries along the way 
but no lingering debility. ``My knees are fine,'' he said. ``No arthritis.'' 
His vocation now is that of a tournament golfer. ``I play on the celebrity 
circuit,'' he said. ``We'll have 13 tournaments next year, from April 
to December. That'll keep me busy.'' He is also busy being a father 
of three boys. ``They're like me,'' he said. ``They want to play sports. 
They don't want to go to school.'' McMahon said he found himself explaining 
recently that schoolwork was required to be eligible for sports. ``You'd 
have to be brain dead not to get to be eligible,'' he said. The days 
he enjoyed most in his playing years were game days, not practice 
days. ``I played to win,'' he said. ``I gave it my all. I played for 
some good coaches and a few bad coaches _ some who had no business 
being there. I always called it like I saw it. And that got me in 
trouble.'' Once Pete Rozelle, the National Football League's commissioner 
at the time, fined McMahon for making critical comments. McMahon responded 
by wearing a headband on game day with Rozelle's name on it, and that 
caused a furor. Another headband once read Pluto. Few knew what that 
meant, but Pluto was the nickname of McMahon's college teammate, Dan 
Plater, whose brief professional career ended when it was discovered 
he had a brain tumor. Plater had surgery and occasionally serves as 
McMahon's caddie in golf tournaments. McMahon, whose career ended 
in 1996, is not a big fan of contemporary pro football. ``The games 
are terrible,'' he said. ``I'd like to go out there and play. But 
my wife won't let me.'' Paul Tagliabue, the present commissioner, 
has ``taken the fun out of the game,'' McMahon said. ``Too many rules, 
regulations for the players. They don't even let the veterans haze 
the rookies anymore. So they don't learn respect.'' McMahon said he 
respects football. ``I love the game,'' he said. ``Football has given 
me everything. I met my wife in college. Her dad hoped she'd bring 
home a good Mormon boy. And they got me. But we've been married 20 
years. ``It's great to be here. I've had a great ride.'' Then the 
brash old quarterback went off to meet his wife. ``Going shopping,'' 
he said.
