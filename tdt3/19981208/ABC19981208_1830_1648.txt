A "last word" about basketball and charity. There was no surprise 
around here today when the NBA canceled this year's all-star game. 
The commissioner, David Stern, said it's because the whole season 
is still in jeopardy. We also heard today that some NBA stars want 
to play in a charity game this month to raise money for UNICEF, the 
U.N. agency that needs so much help in order to help the world's children. 
If only that were the whole story. It's also to raise money for players 
in financial need and show that the players have the political clout 
to put on a game. "The players make a lot," said Patrick Ewing, "but 
they also spend a lot." We're sure that UNICEF will be grateful with 
whatever it gets.
