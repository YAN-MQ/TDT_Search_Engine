A commentary on Iranian radio Tuesday said U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
decision to remove Iran from its list of main drug-producing countries 
was meaningless. It was Tehran's first response to Clinton's announcement 
on Monday that he was removing Iran from a list of drug-problem countries. 
``Whether the name of Iran is included or not included in the annual 
list of the American government will not remove anything or add anything 
to the reality of Iran's campaign against international drug smuggling,'' 
said the commentary on state-run Tehran Radio. After Clinton's announcement, 
officials in Washington said the decision was not political but reflected 
actual changes in Iran. Still, the radio commentary questioned the 
Americans' motives. ``Is the decision by the U.S. government a political 
measure to reduce tension between the two countries?'' the commentator 
asked. ``Or is it that the White House has simply succumbed to ... 
Iran's successful campaign to curb the production and transfer of 
narcotics?'' Clinton said in a letter to Congress that Iran is no 
longer a significant producer of opium poppy and has ceased to be 
a major transit point for U.S.-bound illicit drugs. Malaysia also 
was removed from the list based on findings that only a negligible 
amount of U.S.-bound drugs was coming from that country. Clinton has 
been attempting to reach out to Iran, hoping to establish a government-to-government 
dialogue for the first time in two decades. But Iran has shown little 
interest. Iran's Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said a month 
ago that the United States is intent on ``total domination'' of Iran 
and that keeping relations severed was in Iran's interest. The United 
States broke relations with Iran after Muslim militants seized the 
U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran has 
been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988. Hundreds of traffickers 
have been hanged under a law that mandates the death penalty for anyone 
caught with more than a small quantity of narcotics. Large drug hauls 
are common in Iran, which lies on a route used by smugglers to get 
drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe and the oil-rich Gulf. 
Tehran also ran an energetic campaign to rid the country of opium 
poppy, the raw material for heroin.
