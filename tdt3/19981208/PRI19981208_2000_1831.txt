President Clinton's lawyers are mounting their defense against his 
possible impeachment over his affair with Monica Lewinski. The World's 
Owen Faye in Washington reports on the final defense case. Lawyers 
for President Clinton spent much of the afternoon arguing that, while 
the President mislead the American people, he shouldn't be impeached. 
One of the President's personal attorneys, Gregory Craig, led a team 
of legal scholars in arguing, despite his wrongdoing, the President 
should not be removed from office on the basis of a sexual affair. 
Until Wednesday at midnight, the President's lawyers will continue 
the assault on the impeachment charges with a battery of witnesses. 
This strategy is designed as much to appeal to the American people 
as to convince wavering republican legislators to vote against impeachment. 
And as such, the most compelling testimony is being reserved for Tuesday 
evening to coincide with prime time television. For The World, I am 
Owen Faye in Washington.
