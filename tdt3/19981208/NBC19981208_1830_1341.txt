This is Andrea Mitchell in Washington where senior administration 
officials tell NBC news concern about the president's security is 
at "the highest level ever" for a presidential trip. In Israel today, 
extraordinary precautions as U.S. military helicopters ran through 
the president's routes. Palestinian police are practicing riot control 
and making arrests in simulated demonstrations today. Bill Clinton 
will be the first U.S. president to go to the Gaza strip and bethlehem. 
It is a tremendous security risk. Experts also worry about outside 
threats. NBC news has learned in recent months, there has been a big 
rise in terrorist threats against the U.S around the world. 128 threats 
against U.S. targets overseas in the month of September alone. But 
the real fear on this trip, the terror network of the accused mastermind 
of the African bombings last August, osama bin laden. U.S. investigators 
say bin laden has been targeting Bill Clinton for years when he travels 
overseas. In fact, NBC news has learned on this 1994 trip to Manila, 
bin laden's operatives videotaped the president and his security detail 
to plan an assassination attempt for another summit trip, a plan foiled 
by a bin laden defector. We are, in effect, at war with the bin laden 
terrorist network. And now new concerns. A foreign intelligence service 
has told the U.S. bin laden is seriously ill, may be dying, could 
feel he has very little time to achieve his goals. If true, making 
this trip even more dangerous. Andrea Mitchell, NBC news, Washington.
