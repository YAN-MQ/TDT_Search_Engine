The chief spokesman for Kosovo Albanian rebels rejected the latest 
peace plan for the troubled province Tuesday, and called for the removal 
of its American architect for alleged pro-Serb bias. Adem Demaci also 
acknowledged that the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army was using lull 
in the Kosovo fighting to arm itself and prepare for more battles 
with government troops. ``The KLA has no illusion that the (Serb) 
regime will overnight democratize and that it will give up trying 
to find a solution of the Kosovo crisis with force,'' Demaci told 
reporters. ``It would be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue 
arming themselves and preparing for resistance.'' Demaci said that 
the latest peace plan drafted by the U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher 
Hill, is ``fully unacceptable'' primarily because it doesn't envisage 
what will happen to the KLA if it was adopted. ``Mr. Hill either doesn't 
understand the Albanian problems, or he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' 
Demaci said, adding: ``The State Department should reconsider the 
results of his work'' and ``send us more qualified people.'' On Monday, 
the chief negotiator of the more moderate Albanian faction in Kosovo 
also rejected the draft, but the United States pledged to keep working 
on a formula for a political solution in Kosovo. The negotiator, Fehmi 
Agani said the draft was ``unacceptable'' because it was too close 
to the views of Serbia. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic 
of Yugoslavia. Serbia refuses to consider any Kosovo plan that would 
substantially reduce its control over the ethnic Albanian-majority 
province. Hundreds were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic Albanians 
displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces against Kosovo's 
separatists, before an October peace agreement brought about a tentative 
truce. More than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are believed to be in Serbian 
prisons and police stations, and at least five have died from beatings 
and torture, the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said Tuesday. ``Five 
individuals are known to have died in detention since July 1998 from 
the violence inflicted on them by the police prison guards,'' said 
a Human Rights Watch statement. The statement, faxed to The Associated 
Press bureau in Belgrade, said hundreds of others have been injured 
from beatings and torture, often used to extract confessions. Most 
ethnic Albanians want independence or substantial self-rule, whereas 
Serbia, in its proposal for Kosovo released last month, has offered 
only a degree of autonomy while keeping the province firmly under 
Serbian control. Washington, however, opposes full independence, fearing 
that would lead to similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities 
elsewhere in the southern Balkans. That in turn could destabilize 
what has historically been one of Europe's most unstable regions. 
Although fighting has all but ceased since the October accord, there 
are fears that Kosovo will again explode unless a political solution 
is found by spring. Ivan Sedlak, an official on the Serbian negotiating 
team, said the latest version of Hill's plan has not been studied 
by the Serbian government. He said the previous U.S. version was unacceptable 
because it defined Kosovo virtually as a separate state.
