The president does not plan to appear before the committee, personally, 
but his team has been listening to complaints the White House is arrogant. 
As David Bloom reports from the White House tonight, the message was, 
I am sorry. David? Tom, the president needs only eight more republicans 
to vote against impeachment in order to spare Mr. Clinton a trial 
in the Senate. So his lawyers are offering a mixture of contrition 
and in these 184 pages, an aggressive defense. The president's 184-page 
defense begins with a quote, personal note, saying that Mr. Clinton 
"wants everyone to know that he is profoundly sorry for the wrongs 
he has committed and for the pain he has caused his family, his friends, 
and our nation." But the president's defense especially to the charge 
of perjury may not win over many converts. At one point in his grand 
jury testimony, for example, Mr. Clinton continued to insist he was 
never alone with Monica Lewinsky. You were alone with Monica Lewinsky, 
weren't you? Well, again, it depends on how you define alone. The 
president's lawyers, in their written defense, argue today the term 
"alone" is vague unless a particular geographic space is identified. 
But even the president's own witnesses weren't buying it. This president 
should be condemned for his actions. He did lie to a grand jury. But 
perjury or no perjury, the White House argues Mr. Clinton should not 
be impeached and has found an unlikely Ally in Alfonse D'Amato. NBC 
news has learned that the New York senator defeated in November is 
now lobbying, wavering house republicans especially from the northeast, 
to vote against impeachment. We ought to take serious steps as it 
relates to the president. But I really doubt impeachment is the best 
way to go. The White House strategy, use moderate republicans to try 
to win over moderate republicans. The White House has added a new 
witness for tomorrow, William weld, who will also argue against impeachment. 
tom? Thanks very much, David Bloom.
