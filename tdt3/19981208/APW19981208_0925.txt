Ukraine's Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk will pay an official visit 
to China on Dec. 10-15 to discuss the broadening of bilateral economic 
ties, the ministry said Tuesday. Tarasyuk will meet with his Chinese 
counterpart Tang Jiaxuan and other senior Chinese officials. Tarasyuk 
plans to offer new cooperation projects, such as supplying turbines 
produced by Ukraine's Turboatom plant and other energy equipment, 
the ministry said. A delegation of Ukrainian businessmen would accompany 
Tarasyuk. China is the former Soviet nation's largest trade partner, 
after Russia. The sides also plan to discuss political developments 
in Europe and the former Soviet Union and Ukraine's stance on its 
ties with NATO, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Tarasyuk is 
expected to reiterate Ukraine's adherence to the principle of ``one 
China,'' which recognizes Taiwan as a province of China. In 1996, 
Taiwanese Premier Lien Chan unexpectedly visited Ukraine, drawing 
protests from China. Beijing claims the island as a rebel province 
and demands eventual reunification.
