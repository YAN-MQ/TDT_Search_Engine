Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter says he expects the U.S. government 
to grant a visit, a visa rather, to Venezuelan president-elect Hugo 
Chavez, a former coup plotter who was previously barred from visiting 
the United States. VOA's George Meek in Caracas reports Mr. Carter 
made the comment Monday while assessing the impact of the Venezuela 
election. Mr. Carter, who led one of the international observer delegations 
to Sunday's election in Venezuela says the U.S. government will reverse 
its policy of denying entry to Mr. Chavez because he led an unsuccessful 
coup in 1992. I have no doubt that the visas will be approved in the 
future. The Venezuelan people have spoken. He's their chosen leader. 
I have no doubt that my government will honor that decision. Mr. Carter 
says he is impressed with the commitment of Mr. Chavez to change Venezuela's 
government by democratic means. The president-elect plans to call 
a referendum for convening a constitutional assembly. We hope and 
expect obviously that there will be now a move toward an orderly transfer 
of authority from President Cardetta to President Chavez and that 
the people of Venezuela will have their hopes and dreams realized 
for a continuation of democracy and freedom but with substantial changes 
being made in the political structure of this country. Mr. Carter 
says the overwhelming vote for Mr. Chavez in a free and fair election 
gives him a mandate to bring about the changes.
