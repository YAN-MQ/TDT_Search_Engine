Hundreds of delegates from Europe and the Middle East gathered Tuesday 
for what was billed as an international symposium on human rights 
in a very unlikely place _ Baghdad. But at this conference, the issue 
was not charges by Iraqi dissidents and Western human rights groups 
that Iraq's government has detained thousands of political prisoners 
and tortured and executed many. The issue was the U.N. sanctions and 
the very visible damage they have wrought in Iraq over the past eight 
years. ``We hope the symposium will be able to shed more light on 
the hideous crimes committed every day of the embargo that is imposed 
upon our people and their human rights,'' Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed 
Saeed al-Sahhaf said in opening the conference. The sanctions, including 
an oil embargo, were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The 
U.N. Security Council will only lift them once U.N. inspectors certify 
that Iraq has dismantled its weapons of mass destruction, long-range 
missiles and programs to build them. Iraq says 5,000 to 6,000 children 
die every month from hunger and a shortage of medicines blamed on 
the sanctions. U.N. figures suggest malnutrition is rampant, affecting 
as many as a third of all Iraqi children. Throughout the country, 
infrastructure is crumbling, sometimes sending sewage into drinking 
water. The severity of the Iraqis' plight was echoed by some in the 
largely sympathetic audience, which applauded twice at the mention 
of President Saddam Hussein. His picture sat next to the podium. ``The 
first right is the right to eat,'' Gilles Muniar, general secretary 
of the France-Iraq Friendship Society, said in an interview. ``After 
that, it is time to admit sin.'' Not all the delegates avoided the 
irony of holding a human rights conference in a country like Iraq, 
where a U.N. report this year suggested that 1,500 people were executed 
in 1997. George Galloway, a British parliament member and critic of 
the sanctions, acknowledged that widespread abuses occurred in Iraq. 
But, he said, the impact of the sanctions overshadowed them. ``Compared 
to that, all other infringements of liberties are almost by definition 
smaller,'' he said in an interview. Al-Sahhaf himself skirted the 
question of abuses. But he argued that human rights were used as ``a 
means of blackmail and political pressure.'' ``Human rights have become 
a political weapon in the hands of some states,'' the foreign minister 
said.
