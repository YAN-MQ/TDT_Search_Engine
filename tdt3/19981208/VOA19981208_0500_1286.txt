Two-time U.S. open tennis champion Patrick Rafter of Australia says 
he's recovered from a knee injury, but he plans to take more breaks 
from the court next year. The world number four-ranked player missed 
the lucrative ATP tour world championships in Hanover, Germany last 
month because of the injury. He told reporters in Brisbane Monday 
he was frustrated in missing the season-ending tournament but feels 
like his injured knee has mended. The Australian says he plans to 
play an in Sydney next month as warm-ups for the Australian Open tournament 
which begins in Melbourne January 18th. That's sports. I'm Ray Kugel.
