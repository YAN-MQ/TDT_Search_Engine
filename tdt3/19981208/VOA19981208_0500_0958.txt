And U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno says she will seek an independent 
probe of alleged fundraising abuses by President Clinton during the 
1996 election campaign. Ms. Reno says available evidence does not 
warrant the appointment of a special prosecutor to conduct further 
investigations. A White House spokeswoman said the president is gratified 
by Ms. Reno's decision. Mr. Clinton and his Democratic party aides 
were accused of breaking the rules on use of political advertisements. 
The allegations prompted Ms. Reno to launch a 90-day preliminary probe 
of the matter, but Justice officials were quoted as saying they found 
no wrongdoing on the part of the president or his associates.
