THE BAT WHISPERS Milestone Film and Video. 85 minutes. Letter-boxed. 
$29.95. Information: (800) 603-1104 The action may be antiquated, 
but its legacy is hard to match. Along with the radio show ``The Shadow'' 
and Leonardo da Vinci's flying machines, Roland West's 1930 thriller 
``The Bat Whispers'' was a source for the late cartoonist Bob Kane, 
who in 1939 created Batman the Caped Crusader and Robin the Boy Wonder. 
West's bat, however, was in the business of fomenting crime, not preventing 
it. At the beginning of the film, an entire city, cast in an ominous 
gloom reminiscent of later Batman films, has come to a standstill 
as it awaits ``the Bat.'' At exactly midnight or so, he announces, 
he will steal a necklace from an apartment belonging to a Mr. Bell. 
Pistol at the ready, Bell stands guard inside the apartment while 
outside teams of police brace for the worst. The appointed hour arrives 
but no bat. Bell starts to breathe easier, and the police turn self-congratulatory. 
On the radio an announcer rattles on about what's possible when an 
aroused citizenry rallies against crime. But then a shade rustles 
in the apartment. Bell goes to investigate. Seconds later he's dead, 
and the necklace is being lifted. The clock on his desk reads five 
past midnight. Before swiftly ascending to the rooftops, the Bat insolently 
flips his calling card on the carpet with a message for the police. 
``Bell's clock was fast and you boys were slow,'' it reads. Pretty 
slick. Pieced together from its surviving elements, the restored film 
is in its original widescreen format. Made at a time when movies were 
adjusting to the talkies, it has many of the characteristics of silent 
film. As much a fey comedy as it is a thriller, it moves in large 
and exaggerated gestures, has some laughs at the expense of its characters 
and is never above breaking off for a slapstick routine or two. For 
all the shenanigans, though, there are flashes of impressionistic 
high style. A bat of the human variety, his cape spread at night to 
resemble wings and his image flashed against walls and across lightning-streaked 
skies, cuts an arresting figure in black and white. After the jewel 
heist, the story repairs to a dark and sprawling mansion for a tug 
of war over money stolen from a bank. Contestants include the feisty 
matron who has rented the place; a damsel (Una Merkel, best remembered 
for her hair-pulling brawl with Marlene Dietrich in ``Destry Rides 
Again'') trying to protect her boyfriend the bank clerk, who is accused 
of the crime; a police detective (the jut-jawed Chester Morris), and, 
of course, the Bat, who appears apparition-like from time to time 
to waylay somebody or otherwise wreak havoc. Everybody chases one 
another round and round the heavy furnishings, up and down sweeping 
staircases and in and out of secret rooms behind massive fireplaces. 
At the end, the identity of the Bat is revealed. He even takes a curtain 
call and has a private word with the viewers. He's not such a bad 
guy, really, he says.
