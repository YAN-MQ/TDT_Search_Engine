Catchy, that. Many of our local FM and medium-wave affiliates are 
about to take a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. Well, we're 
approaching the middle of the workweek. And let's take a look at some 
weather forecast for the Middle East. On Wednesday, sunny and breezy. 
A warm 31 degrees in Abu Dhabi. Oman, Jordan mostly cloudy. A high 
of 22. Baghdad, your high temperature on Wednesday. It will be 27 
and partly sunny. Beirut, 22 degrees for your high. And rain in your 
forecast. You'll be cloudy and breezy in Cairo, Egypt. With a high 
of 21. Damasca, Syria, 22. And you can expect rain. Jerusalem, it'll 
be showery and a high of 20 degrees. Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 32 on Wednesday. 
It will be sunny. And sunny as well in Kuwait City. A high of 29. 
We're coming up now on 22 hours, Universal time. And it means we're 
closing down all frequencies to the Middle East, North Africa, and 
Europe. Except for 1548 kHz medium-wave to the Persian Gulf region. 
In Europe during the next hour, VOA News Now can be heard on WRN1, 
Via Astra channel 22. Audio subcarrier 7.38 MHz. VOA News Now continues 
to East Asia on 7.215, 9.77, 9.89, 11.76, 15.185, 15.29, 15.305, 17.735, 
and 17.82 MHz short-wave. In Africa, you can tune to 6.035, 7.415, 
11.975, 12.08, and 13.71 MHz short-wave. As VOA News Now continues. 
It's, Universal time. And this is VOA News Now. A White House Lawyer 
and a panel of experts testify against the impeachment of President 
Clinton. Israel says it will probably not carry out its next West 
Bank withdrawal as scheduled by Friday. And on today's Dateline, the 
second report on discrimination and hate crimes based on race. All 
that and more in this half hour of VOA News Now.
