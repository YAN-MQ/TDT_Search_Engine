The White House opened its formal defense of President Clinton on 
Tuesday, addressing in greater detail than before the facts and issues 
of the impeachment case against Clinton and adopting a more conciliatory 
tone in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee. Clinton's 
lawyers and three panels of anti-impeachment witnesses conducted a 
grueling day-into-night tutorial for the 37-member committee on why 
Clinton should not be removed from office for his admitted misconduct 
in the Monica Lewinsky affair. ``Just as no fancy language can obscure 
the simple fact that what the president did was morally wrong,'' said 
Gregory Craig, the White House special counsel who led the defense 
effort Tuesday, ``no amount of rhetoric can change the legal reality 
that there are no grounds for impeachment.'' The president's lawyers 
assembled a battery of witnesses who virtually conceded that his behavior 
was reprehensible, but said impeachment was graver threat to the nation 
than allowing the president to serve out his tarnished final two years 
in office. The president's defenders tried to blur the hard edges 
of his fundamental point of defense _ that he misbehaved and misled, 
but did not obstruct justice or commit perjury. His conduct was surely 
sinful, said Craig, but just as certainly not impeachable. White House 
aides said Tuesday night that Clinton was likely to make some public 
comment on the committee's deliberations, perhaps offering another 
statement of remorse to temper lingering concerns among wavering Republicans. 
But even as Craig and his nine friendly witnesses was trying to put 
a gentler face on the president's defense, White House lawyers released 
a 184-page rebuttal that once again harshly attacked Kenneth Starr, 
accusing him of slanting the case against the president by excluding 
exculpatory evidence in his impeachment referral to Congress. The 
presentation from the president's men did not appear to sway any minds 
on the bitterly divided Judiciary Committee. But the debate, which 
was by turns tedious, riveting and mildly salacious, was aimed more 
at a body of moderate Republicans outside the committee who hold in 
their hands the president's fate.
