Deputies in France's National Assembly on Tuesday again took up a 
controversial bill to give legal status to unmarried couples, aiming 
this time to finish the debate quickly. The deputies in the lower 
house were expected to finally vote on the measure on Wednesday. Then 
it would go to the Senate _ probably in March. The so-called Civil 
Solidarity Pact has been hotly contested by the conservative opposition, 
which fears it could lead to gay marriages, and to adoptions by gay 
couples. This is the bill's second attempt at passage in the lower 
house of parliament. Rightist politicians finally stopped their delaying 
tactics on Tuesday. The bill, which has been laden with hundreds of 
ammendments, would allow two unrelated people to form a union that 
would, among other things, allow them to file joint tax returns, gain 
inheritance benefits, and share social security coverage.
