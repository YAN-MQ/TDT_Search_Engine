Have you talked about your child's health today? My baby eats well, 
but how do I know if she's getting the proper nutrition? The growth 
of your child is a good way to tell if she's getting all the nutrients 
she needs. What's the best way to measure my baby's growth? By getting 
your baby's weight checked regularly. A health worker can then compare 
your baby's weight to the ideal weight of children the same age and 
height. So if there's a problem, it can be detected early? That's 
right. Give you baby a healthy start. Find out from a health worker 
about the best foods to feed growing children. Your child's health 
is your family's future. Coming up now on 10 hours 18 universal time, 
the top story of the hour for us. U.S. mideast expert Dennis Ross 
is in Israel preparing for meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. 
He's working to reinvigorate the peace process before President Clinton 
arrives in the region this weekend. We'll have further details on 
that story about 12 minutes from now. What we're going to tell you 
now is all the sports that fits, that's fit to air. Here's VOA's Ray 
Kugel.
