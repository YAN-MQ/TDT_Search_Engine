Russia's parliament on Tuesday again postponed discussions on the 
START II treaty after failing to meet a deadline for sending a related 
measure on nuclear weapons to President Boris Yeltsin, a news report 
said. The parliament's agenda setting body, the Duma Council, had 
planned to review a bill outlining Russia's nuclear weapons program 
on Tuesday. But it delayed debate because no parliamentary factions 
except the liberal Yabloko party submitted proposals or suggestions 
for the measure, the Interfax news agency said. Russia's Communist-led 
parliament has repeatedly delayed action on the START II treaty, signed 
by the United States and Russia in 1993. The lawmakers want an additional 
measure outlining the country's nuclear weapons program before they 
act on the treaty. One positive note was sounded Tuesday when Nikolai 
Kharitonov, a leader of the Communist-allied Agrarian Party, said 
he had changed his mind about the treaty after a meeting with Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, and now supported it. ``As things stand 
now, ratification is in Russia's interest,'' Kharitonov said, according 
to the Interfax news agency. He suggested that Russia could enhance 
its prospects for Western financial aid by ratifying the accord. The 
START II treaty would halve the Russian and American nuclear arsenals 
to about 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each. Yabloko leaders accused Communists 
in the parliament of once again stalling on the treaty, which the 
United States Senate ratified in 1996. Yeltsin and other proponents 
of ratification say the missiles that would be destroyed under START-II 
will soon be out of date anyway.
