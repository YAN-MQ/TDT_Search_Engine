Joe DiMaggio's doctor says the baseball legend is doing better, but 
he is not out of the Woods yet. He says DiMaggio is more alert and 
his temperature is down, and he denies reports the hall-of-famer slipped 
into a coma. DiMaggio is still in critical condition, sedated and 
breathing with the help of a ventilator. The 84-year-old New York 
Yankees hall-of-famer has been in the hospital for weeks. DiMaggio 
had a cancerous tumor removed from his right lung in October. Since 
then, he's had a persistent lung infection and fever.
