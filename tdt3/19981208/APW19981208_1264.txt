The top official of a Gulf Arab group on Tuesday cautioned oil rich 
nations against over-production, saying it is the root cause of falling 
world prices. The plea was made by Jamil al-Hojeilan, the secretary-general 
of the Gulf Cooperation Council, in a television interview on the 
second day of an annual summit of GCC leaders. This year, the meeting 
focused on the calamitous effects of low oil prices on the GCC economies. 
Al-Hojeilan told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arabic TV 
network, that ``the whole problem'' is caused by countries not sticking 
to their production quotas. Analysts say Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia 
and Qatar are the main over-producers. ``The strategic view of oil 
policy in the GCC countries is to keep a balance between supply and 
demand. We hope that pledges of abiding by quotas agreed upon are 
respected,'' al-Hojeilan said. He denied that GCC oil ministers have 
agreed to reduce production. Officials attending the summit made such 
a claim earlier to The Associated Press and added that the GCC ministers 
also agreed to ask other producers in the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries to join them in the cuts starting March. ``It 
is unfounded. It is wrong,'' al-Hojeilan, a Saudi, told the MBC interviewer. 
The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the 
Emirates. All except Oman and Bahrain are members of OPEC. The Gulf 
countries, which together sit on half the world's proven oil reserves 
and depend on exports for 75 percent of their revenues, have been 
hard hit by oil prices that plummeted because of the recession in 
Asia and warmer-than-usual winters. On Monday, the opening day of 
the three-day GCC summit, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah said 
that ``the main source of our income has been greatly shaken by the 
imbalance of the oil market.'' ``The boom days are gone and will never 
come back to the region,'' he said. ``Such an imbalance requires us 
to exert our utmost efforts inside and outside OPEC,'' said Abdullah, 
who is leading the Saudi delegation in place of his ailing half-brother, 
King Fahd. The GCC meeting comes less than two weeks after OPEC ministers 
adjourned a year-end meeting in the Austrian capital Vienna without 
agreeing on measures to halt the slide in oil prices. Instead, the 
11-nation cartel decided to review the situation in March, sending 
markets into gyrations. Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January 
futures contracts for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell 
to a record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum 
Exchange in London. The contracts closed at dlrs 10.26. Gulf oil generally 
sells at a dollar or two less than the North Sea's Brent, which itself 
was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel as recently as 1997. The Gulf 
producers have been grappling with widening budget deficits and problems 
paying foreign debts. Saudi Arabia, for example, had projected a dlrs 
4.8 billion budget deficit for 1998, but analysts predict it will 
reach dlrs 15 billion. ``The projected increases in the GCC budget 
deficits are expected to leave a negative impact on their economic 
development,'' said Mohammad Khalfan Khirbash, the Emirates minister 
of finance. GCC countries were expected to invest up to dlrs 90 billion 
in major projects in the next five years, of which dlrs 25 billion 
was to go for the oil and gas sectors. Those plans may have to be 
scaled down or shelved altogether. In the defense sector alone, the 
Gulf Arab countries have bought tens of billions of dollars in arms 
over the past decade. They were expected to spend another dlrs 80 
billion more over the next four years.
