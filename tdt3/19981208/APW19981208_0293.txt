Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma vetoed Tuesday a bill that would 
have raised the country's minimum wage, arguing the hike would force 
the government to make massive layoffs and print more money, a news 
report said Monday. The legislature voted last month to nearly triple 
the monthly minimum wage from 55 hryvna (dlrs 16) to 148 hryvna (dlrs 
43), and also set the official poverty level at 118.6 hryvna (dlrs 
35) a month. Kuchma said the government can't afford the new minimum 
wage, and would have to fire 60 percent of state employees and sharply 
raise taxes to balance its books, the Interfax news agency reported. 
Implementation of the law through a different option _ by printing 
more money _ would increase quadruple inflation by the end of 1998 
and boost it by more than 100 times next year, Kuchma said. Nearly 
all Ukrainians earn more than the minimum wage, and the average monthly 
salary was about 170 hryvna (dlrs 50) in the first half of 1998. The 
minimum wage and poverty level figures, though, are used to calculate 
various payments throughout the country. Ukraine's leftist-dominated 
parliament has long favored extra spending for social needs and has 
regularly made attempts to increase the minimum wage despite government 
objections.
