The governing party Tuesday resolved differences among its members 
over allowing foreign investment in Indian insurance companies and 
plans to introduce a bill in Parliament later this week, a party spokesman 
said. Madan Lal Khurana, the parliamentary affairs minister, told 
reporters that the Bharatiya Janata Party lawmakers at a meeting unanimously 
decided to support the government on the issue, Dow Jones News Wires 
reported. The main opposition Congress party supports the bill, greatly 
increasing its chances of becoming law. The bill, which proposes to 
allow up to 40 percent foreign investment in Indian insurance companies, 
was delayed because of opposition within the Bharatiya Janata Party 
even after the federal Cabinet had cleared the proposal. Several senior 
BJP leaders look with suspicion on outside influence on the Indian 
economy and are opposed to opening up the insurance business to the 
private companies. Several workers' unions and political parties have 
announced a nationwide strike Dec. 11 against the government's decision 
to open up . The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, a southern 
regional ally of the governing 19-party coalition, said it also would 
join the strike against the economic policies of Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vaypayee's government. But the party continues to be part of 
the coalition. Last month, a cabinet committee decided to allow foreigners 
to own up to 26 percent of private Indian insurance companies, and 
said an additional 14 percent could be held by Indians based overseas.
