We're paying quite a lot of attention to the incestestable in America. 
Retired people have more than social security on their minds. Retirement 
can be a time of enormous freedom, enormous opportunity. There are 
lots of decisions to be made, where to live, what to do, how to enjoy 
life. Deborah Amos reports on how many older Americans are finding 
what they want by going back to school. For many, this is the picture 
of the perfect retirement. But thousands of older Americans are now 
trading their place in the sun for this -- and this -- and this -- 
and especially this. In the past few years, some 30 retirement communities 
have opened in college towns. People, as they are more vigorous when 
they get older, seek to keep a Purpose in life. And that purpose is 
sometimes hard to find on a beach or a golf course. Carol zingg and 
her husband left sunny California for retirement in ames, Iowa. They 
have family nearby, but that's not the only reason. Probably we wouldn't 
be here if it wasn't for the University. The University offers college 
courses for seniors who live here, plus there's a chance to mingle 
with students. It's fun to have the student around, because it makes 
you think yuck. There's a two-year waiting list to get into greenhills 
retirement community. Most of these projects are partnerships between 
a University and a Developer. They're designed to make money, as universities 
recognize the benefits of the retirement market. Universities have 
discovered that seniors are willing to pay a premium to live in a 
stimulating environment. Universities hope to be remembered in a will. 
Another benefit -- here in Ithaca, New York, both Cornell and Ithaca 
college are using the community as a way to study aging, a living 
laboratory for students in gerontology courses. The attitudes about 
aging changed. Their attitudes about their own selves as older people 
have changed. And their attitudes about what they want to do in life 
has changed. Also changing, what it means to retire in America. You 
see my bookbag here, yes. The hair is Gray, yes. This group is re-inventing 
the way we grow old, and the baby boomers are only going to build 
on that. You have a sense of life and you're not here to just put 
your feet up and do nothing. Not with classes in the morning and hockey 
at night. Deborah Amos, ABC News, Ithaca, New York.
