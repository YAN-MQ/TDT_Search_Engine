Good evening. Bill Clinton sent an all-star line up to Capitol Hill 
today to save his presidency from impeachment. But tonight the jury 
still is out in a manner of speaking, and it will be for several more 
days. It now appears the Judiciary committee won't vote before the 
weekend on whether to recommend impeachment. But as NBC's Gwen Ifill 
tells us tonight, that vote seems to be a foregone conclusion. White 
House lawyers arrived on Capitol Hill today in a Conciliatory mood. 
There was an apologetic Tone. The president's testimony was evasive, 
incomplete, misleading, even maddening. But it was not perjury. And 
not deserving, the White House insists, of a punishment as severe 
as impeachment. There can be no more solemn or awesome moment in the 
history of this republic than when the members of the House of Representatives 
contemplate returning an article of impeachment against the president 
of the United States. Key to the democrats' defense, the country, 
they say, doesn't want this. The American people may wake up next 
week and find out that the Congress impeached the president for not 
being contrite enough to certain members of congress. But republicans 
were not persuaded. It will be inconvenient to have an impeachment. 
But how much less convenient will it be to have the rule of law eroded, 
corroded, cheapened? Did he lie to the American people when he said, 
"I never had sex with that woman"? Did he lie? He certainly misled 
and deceived. Wait a minute now, did he lie? Democrats predict the 
committee has already reached its foregone conclusion. There is nothing 
that any of the witnesses here today could say to this committee that 
would prevent the majority of this committee from voting to impeach 
the president of the United States on Saturday afternoon. Democrats 
are focusing on an audience outside the hearing room, moderate republicans, 
who will announce support for the president. Other republicans the 
White House hopes to persuade -- Jay Dickey of arkansas, Nancy Johnson 
of Connecticut, Connie Morella of Maryland, clay shaw of Florida and 
Robert Ney of Ohio. The White House scaled back its attacks. But democrats 
were attacking each other with new vigor, tension building as they 
draw closer to a historic vote. Gwen Ifill, NBC news, the capitol.
