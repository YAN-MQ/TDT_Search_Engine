Five afternoons a week, for four years in the 1950s and in countless 
re-runs since, Darlene Gillespie and her fellow Mousketeers came bouncing 
out of television sets all over the country, inviting baby boomers 
to ``come along and sing our song and join our family,'' as members 
of Walt Disney's original ``Mickey Mouse Club.'' Tuesday, Ms. Gillespie, 
57, sat alone and sober at the defense table in a federal courtroom 
here, listening to closing arguments in her trial on charges of securities 
fraud, conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from 
what prosecutors say was a scheme to buy stock without paying for 
it. And when she took a deep breath and let out a wistful sigh, that 
old pledge of ``Forever let us hold our banner high!'' seemed a long 
time ago indeed. ``At its core,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Weiss 
told the jury in his summation, ``this case comes down to a series 
of lies,'' adding, ``Your job is to sort through the thicket of her 
lies.'' The government contends that in 1992 and 1993, Ms. Gillespie 
and her longtime fiance, Jerry Fraschilla, devised a scheme to ``free-ride'' 
by buying stock in a high-tech motor-making company called Unique 
Mobility using bad checks and a made-up identity, in the hope that 
run-ups in the stock price would let them profit before their brokers 
caught on, while the brokers would be stuck with any losses. Last 
month, Fraschilla, 61, was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered 
to pay $65,000 in restitution after pleading guilty to 21 counts in 
the case. But Ms. Gillespie's lawyer, Charles Rondeau, told the jury 
Tuesday that his client was the innocent victim of misleading brokers 
and an unscrupulous boyfriend, as he declared, ``It is not a crime 
to love the wrong people. The fact that she still lives with Mr. Fraschilla 
is proof of the power he has over her.'' Outside the courtroom, Ms. 
Gillespie declined to be interviewed, but this case is neither her 
first brush with the law nor the first bump on the long road from 
her days with Bobby, Annette, Tommy, Cubby and the rest, to a failed 
attempt as a country-western performer, two decades as a surgical 
nurse, a fruitless, years-long campaign to win residual payments from 
Disney and finally conviction with Fraschilla last year on unrelated 
shoplifting charges for stealing four women's shirts from a Macy's 
in Ventura, Calif. Bobby Burgess, one of the original Mousketeers, 
who went on to star as a dancer on ``The Lawrence Welk Show,'' and 
still performs with other Welk veterans in Branson, Mo., told the 
Associated Press that Ms. Gillespie had talent but bad luck. ``It 
made me want to reach out and give her a big hug,'' he said. ``Maybe 
she fell in with the wrong company.'' Clearly, life has not been all 
milk and cookies for Ms. Gillespie since her original run on the Mouse 
Club, broadcast weekday afternoons on ABC from 1955 to 1959. Things 
began promisingly enough: In the 1955-56 season, Ms. Gillespie was 
featured in one of the program's regular serialized stories within 
the show, ``Corky and White Shadow,'' about a sheriff's daughter and 
her German shepherd and co-starring Buddy Ebsen. But in a suit she 
filed in 1990 against Disney and later settled out of court, Ms. Gillespie 
contended that the studio failed to promote her career as promised, 
and that as a result she never became as famous as Annette Funicello, 
the beach-blanket sweetheart who was the only Mousketeer kept on contract 
after the show ended and who now suffers from multiple sclerosis. 
In ``The Official Mickey Mouse Club Book,'' by Lorraine Santoli, Ms. 
Gillespie discussed her ambivalence about the Mouse Club. ``When the 
show was syndicated on television, I never told my children that the 
pigtailed girl named Darlene was their mom,'' she said. ``I thought 
perhaps it would embarrass them, or that they would think the show 
silly.'' But she added that her children liked the show and were proud 
when they eventually learned her secret, ``and that made it all worthwhile.'' 
The original episodes remain in circulation today on the ``Vault Disney'' 
feature on the Disney Channel, but as a contract player, like most 
others in television from those days, Ms. Gillespie earns no payments 
from the reruns, and she is currently suing both Disney and the Screen 
Actors Guild in federal court in an effort to force an arbitration. 
``They simply haven't paid her her due,'' Rondeau said in an interview. 
But in his closing argument Tuesday, the government prosecutor, Weiss, 
said Ms. Gillespie took more than her due, or as he put it, ``Defendant 
Darlene Gillespie got greedy.'' Together with Fraschilla, he said, 
Ms. Gillespie bought stock with defaced checks they knew would eventually 
bounce, and conspired to create a fictitious person to buy shares 
as well, a Michael Andrews, named for a real Arkansas man who was 
the ex-husband of a woman Fraschilla once tried to date, and then 
gave their creation the Social Security number of the real Andrews' 
ex-wife. In a deposition to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
in 1993, when it began investigating the suspected trades, Ms. Gillespie 
swore she had met Andrews at Fraschilla's office. But in the trial 
last week, the real Andrews testified that he had never met Ms. Gillespie 
or even been to California, or ever owned a share of stock in his 
life. Ms. Gillespie's lawyer insisted Tuesday that Fraschilla's late 
secretary, Ann Preble, had indeed introduced Ms. Gillespie to a man 
named Michael Andrews, and that his client knew nothing about any 
such deception. And he repeated Ms. Gillespie's assertion that she 
wrote checks on a bank account with insufficient funds to buy stocks 
on credit from one broker only on assurances from that broker that 
the checks would not be deposited right away, and with the understanding 
that they were effectively backed by her holdings at another brokerage 
house. ''The government's case is all about what they argue are similar 
circumstances,'' to their case against Fraschilla, Rondeau said. ``When 
you look at all the facts, you will see that they simply do not support 
an intent to defraud.''
