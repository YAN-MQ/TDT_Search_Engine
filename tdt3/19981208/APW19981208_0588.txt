Most of the cash aboard Swissair Flight 111 has been found, but the 
plane's stash of diamonds has still not been retrieved from the ocean 
floor. As of last week, the scallop dragger dredging the crash site 
was still finding a substantial amount of debris and currency, RCMP 
spokesman Sgt. Bill Price said Monday. He said the cash, most of it 
American, is being found in bits and pieces. Swissair has said 50 
kilograms (110 pounds) of cash was on board when the MD-11, headed 
from New York to Geneva, crashed off Peggy's Cove on Sept. 2. All 
229 people aboard were killed. ``Whether it was hundreds of thousands 
(of dollars) or whether it was millions, I don't really know,'' said 
Price, adding the recovered money is being dried in a special building 
at Canadian Forces Base Shearwater before being turned over to Swissair. 
The kilogram (2 pounds) of diamonds _ the weight includes packaging 
_ has been more elusive. ``Heavens knows where they are,'' said Price. 
``We may never see it again, it's hard to say.'' The precious gems 
investigators said they found earlier this fall were personal effects, 
he said. Swissair has said the container holding the cash and jewels 
was not shockproof and may have been damaged by the crash impact. 
About 85 per cent of the plane has been recovered. Half of the cockpit 
has been hauled up. By Monday, the remains of at least 223 victims 
had been identified.
