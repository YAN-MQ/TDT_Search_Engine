Saying Israel failed to fulfill agreements, Poland on Tuesday rejected 
a deal to arm its Huzar helicopter with Israeli-made missiles, Prime 
Minister Jerzy Buzek said. Making the announcement after a weekly 
Cabinet meeting, Buzek said the deal announced last year was rejected 
because ``Israel has failed to hold tests in Poland of the missile 
that we were to buy.'' He also cited objections raised by the government 
auditing agency over the handling of a tender for a separate deal 
involving integrating systems for the Huzar helicopter. An Israeli 
company also won that contract. Buzek called the missile deal that 
Poland's previous leftist government signed with Israel a preliminary 
agreement and said scrapping it will have no legal or financial consequences, 
the state news agency PAP reported. The decision by Poland adds to 
a list of disputes with Israel. Earlier this year, the Israeli government-run 
Yad Vashem Holocaust museum formally complained to Poland's government 
about crosses erected on a property adjoining the Auschwitz Nazi death 
camp, now a museum. On Monday, Poland announced that Israel refused 
to extradite a Polish Jew who allegedly committed atrocities against 
German prisoners in 1945. Poland's pending membership in NATO, the 
Western military alliance, may have influenced its decision to reject 
the Israeli missile deal. The former Polish government, which lost 
power in elections last year, chose the Israeli company Rafael over 
the U.S. company Boeing for the missile deal. Buzek, however, said 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to terms for testing 
the missiles during a visit to Poland in April. Poland wanted to test 
the missiles in Polish weather and terrain by the end of November, 
but Buzek said Israel asked to postpone the tests for eight months, 
which he called ``unacceptable.'' Following five years of negotiating 
with several potential partners, Poland last year awarded the dlrs 
800 million contract to Israel's Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd. companies 
to equip the Huzar helicopters in line with NATO requirements. Under 
the deal, which required approval from both governments, Rafael was 
to supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD missiles and Elbit was to provide 
electronic integrating systems. But Poland's Solidarity-led government, 
which took office shortly after the agreement was signed, criticized 
the handling of the tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded 
missile tests. It also decided to seek another tender for the integrating 
systems, but has set no date for it. Buzek said the government will 
continue its plan to arm the Polish-made Huzar.
