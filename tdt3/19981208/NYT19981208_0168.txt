If ever there was a map of a collective human heart, of where a generation 
found its emotional epicenter, it was laid out on a set on the Paramount 
lot here on a chilly day recently. It was a gritty urban street corner 
where the men wore black turtlenecks and corduroy coats, while the 
long-haired women, many of them smoking, wore boots and beads. A young 
man strummed a guitar in front of the Kettle of Fish restaurant (with 
lox and cream cheese listed on the menu at 75 cents). Nearby were 
the Cafe Figaro, the Bitter End and posters for concerts by the Lovin' 
Spoonful and Buffy Sainte-Marie. Yes, it was Bleecker and MacDougal, 
Greenwich Village, 1964. This was the last day of filming on the NBC 
mini-series ``The '60s,'' which is scheduled to be broadcast Feb. 
7 and 8, and it was fitting somehow that the people behind the project 
_ baby boomers _ had chosen to close the production of this paean 
to their ambiguous youth in an unambiguous flight of happy nostalgia. 
That note of hope is, in fact, central not just to their own mythology 
but also to this unusually personal bit of television. Jordana Brewster 
and Josh Hamilton, two of the lead actors in the four-hour mini-series, 
were strolling down the street, with Ms. Brewster's character, Sarah 
Weinstock, lamenting that she had yet to go to the South and march 
in civil rights protests. She could if she wanted, replied Hamilton, 
playing the good-hearted Michael Herlihy, suggesting a world in which 
anything was possible if it sprang from passion and idealism. Then 
the pair stopped to sing some lines from ``Mr. Tambourine Man,'' a 
hint of their real mission, which was to catch a glimpse of Bob Dylan 
_ to worship, in other words, at the altar of youth, an act as seductive 
for those creating the mini-series today as it was for them 34 years 
ago. ``The '60s'' tries to chart the course of that decade by following 
a family, the Herlihys, from 1960 through 1969. The dreams that motivate 
the children into the thick of the troubled era end up taking an enormous 
toll on the family. One son veers into self-destruction, while another 
finds hope in his painful coming of age, and on the way they experience 
everything from Black Panther meetings to Woodstock and the 1968 Democratic 
National Convention. NBC promises some great '60s music _ it plans 
to release a CD _ as part of its overall effort to use the mini-series 
to attract the young, affluent audience that advertisers so desire. 
``I just thought it would dramatize all that passion,'' said Lindy 
De Koven, NBC's executive vice president in charge of mini-series 
and movies. ``And, let's be honest, a lot of what is going to drive 
this is the music.'' But the mini-series is more than an attempt to 
win high ratings, according to the people behind the project. They 
want it both to recall their history and, in effect, to perform reconstructive 
surgery on it. That is because the years have not been all that good 
to the 1960s. The entertainment industry, mirroring public attitudes, 
has frequently depicted the decade as a time of misadventures, irresponsibility 
and illusions, whether in the form of Vietnam War movies or paranoid 
visions like Oliver Stone's ``JFK'' Another picture, ``The Ice Storm,'' 
conveyed a popular image of the era's residue (the early '70s) as 
soulless hedonism and moral breakdown. But some baby boomers are fighting 
back, trying to reclaim that terrain as perhaps excessive and tumultuous 
but, at least in part, noble _ maybe even a model for their children 
rather than a cautionary tale. The question is whether young people 
will find such nostalgia appealing or out of touch with today, when 
free sex conjures up images of AIDS, drug use suggests rehab and Colombian 
cartels, and the struggle for racial equality often means divisive 
court battles over reverse discrimination. ``It's about what our children 
will think of us and what we went through,'' said Lynda Obst, the 
executive producer of the mini-series. ``About why it was good.'' 
For Ms. Obst, a producer of movies like ``The Siege'' and ``Sleepless 
in Seattle,'' and the editor of ``Sixties: The Decade Remembered Now, 
by the People Who Lived It Then,'' the excitement in the Village scene 
was enormous, and she insisted on pointing out to a visitor the wealth 
of details she had recreated, including menus, posters, pleated skirts 
_ and telling stories about how each one had been part of her real 
life. As she spoke, Ms. Obst, 48, checked out the curly hair of an 
actor to see if it looked enough like Bob Dylan's to fill the part 
of the bard, who would be glimpsed briefly from behind in this scene. 
She recalled skipping school as a girl growing up in Westchester County, 
N.Y., and rushing to this exact spot in the hope of seeing Dylan. 
(The best she could manage, she said, was a peek at Buffy Sainte-Marie 
and snaring a button that read, ``Hands Off Lenny Bruce.'') ``This 
is a `Roots' for boomers,'' Ms. Obst said. ``We want to reinspire 
that sense of passion.'' Jeffrey Fiskin, one of the screenwriters, 
added: ``We were shameless grave robbers of our own lives for this. 
But I know what I hope. I hope young people will say, `I wish I lived 
then,' or that they say, `I can make the times what I want.''' ``The 
'60s are not the villain,'' Fiskin said. ``They're the good guy.'' 
Ms. Brewster, who is 18, said she was not so sure. She described the 
kind of rebellion she was re-enacting as ``a phase every kid goes 
through.'' ``I can't explain it,'' she said. ``Kids want to relive 
sort of the hippie experience, wear Birkenstocks, you know.'' Ms. 
Brewster has special reason to feel a sympathetic interest in those 
times; her grandfather was Kingman Brewster, who, as the president 
of Yale University during the 1960s, was accused of tolerating draft 
evaders and defending indirectly the Black Panthers. Still, Ms. Brewster 
remarked: ``It's kind of ridiculous to be envious of the '60s. I'm 
not envious. I'm glad I'm living it vicariously. I don't think we 
can afford that innocence anymore. We don't have the repression to 
rebel against. No kid my age is allowed to be that free, that promiscuous, 
to experience that much, because of the consequences of everything 
now.'' She added, ``I think kids will be a little depressed watching 
this, that there's not something now to rebel against.'' Hamilton 
expressed similar sentiments. ``When I was younger, I was depressed 
that I'd been born in the wrong era,'' he said. ``I'd missed my time 
to be alive. But we don't have the war to galvanize us all.'' He added: 
``There's been almost a campaign waged against the '60s to make it 
into a failure, to make political activism unhip. This age of irony 
we're in now, it disturbs me. But it is such a different time. It 
can't be helped.'' Ms. Obst and her team are not the only boomers 
in Hollywood eager to portray those times more positively. Brian Grazer, 
for example, was the producer of Oliver Stone's tumultuous 1991 movie 
``The Doors.'' The film showed rock-and-roll icon Jim Morrison as 
perhaps brilliant but certainly out of control as he flung himself 
into a cycle of self-absorption and destruction that snuffed out his 
life at the age of 27, in 1971. ``At that time, that was seen as the 
symbol for the '60s,'' Grazer said. Four years later, however, he 
produced ``Apollo 13,'' which found real heroes from the '60s and 
put the era in a very different light. The film received a far more 
enthusiastic response at the box office than he had ever imagined. 
So Grazer helped produce the huge HBO mini-series ``From the Earth 
to the Moon,'' which was broadcast earlier this year. ( Fiskin wrote 
one of the episodes.) ``We're trying to use the space program to say 
there was something good at that time,'' Grazer said. ``Subconsciously, 
I admit it: we were mythologizing the space program. We were very 
excited about the idea.'' Ms. Obst said she had her sights clearly 
fixed on posterity. ``I'm concerned that my kids learn about what 
we did, that they not forget the struggle,'' she said. ``I guess their 
not caring is the worst thing, just after their thinking it was a 
waste. ``I jumped at the chance of doing this because young people 
have been discouraged from taking the '60s seriously, or as something 
positive. This is when everything happened. This is when it all started. 
Good and bad, but definitely good.''
