It's a bad time for soccer in Greece. ``Our country is being internationally 
defamed at the time it is preparing to organize the Olympic Games,'' 
said a recent report issued by a parliamentary committee on soccer. 
But most Greeks don't need a document to tell them something is rotten 
with their country's most popular sport. All they have to do is follow 
the 18-team first division league, where the coverage lately is as 
much about clashes as goals. The latest wave of vandalism and violence 
began with allegations of biased referees. The suspicions are fed 
by fans and team owners and probed by sports newspapers, which have 
reported accusations that some referees have been bribed. ``Something 
stinks and the politicians have an obligation to do something about 
it,'' Panathinaikos club president Giorgos Vardinoyiannis was quoted 
as saying in newspapers Tuesday. Now, every questionable call or close 
game is scrutinized with the loser blaming it on corruption. This 
growing belief in conspiracies and game fixing has stoked tempers 
to unprecedented levels. During Sunday's first-division match between 
Olympiakos and longtime rival Panathinaikos, fans burned cars, threw 
stones at police, attacked bystanders and tore seats from the stadium 
that will host the 2004 Olympic Games. Olympiakos won 4-2. One year 
ago, both teams were ordered to pay more than dlrs 1 million in fines 
after their fans tried to set the Olympic stadium on fire during another 
derby. The Athens daily Ta Nea declared that sportsmanship ``has been 
buried.'' But the game is ``like a vampire (and) insists on walking 
around.'' Worries about mayhem have been hurting attendance steadily. 
Only 30,000 die-hard fans or members of organized clubs went to the 
80,000-seat Olympic stadium on Saturday. Police also are tired. For 
months, their unions have been agitating to be relieved of security 
and riot control duty at stadiums. They argue that clubs _ which are 
privately owned corporations _ receive dlrs millions in subsidies 
from state soccer gambling pools and should pay for their own security. 
A law passed 12 years ago barring rowdy fans from stadiums never has 
been implemented fully. According to the parliamentary report, the 
core problem is that ``there is a general lack of credibility that 
creates a climate of doubt and suspicion'' that results in violence. 
Last year, nearly half the country's 300 lawmakers issued a statement 
complaining that soccer ``is being led to decline and extermination.'' 
But instead of working to calm fears, some government officials only 
reinforce that belief of behind-the-scene meddling in the sport. When 
PAOK supporters took to the streets to protest a league decision that 
penalized their team for a riot and the beating of a referee by the 
club's fans, they found a supporter in Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos. 
``Look there is a great outcry in Salonica, and I think it's justified,'' 
Tsochadzopoulos said of his home town. ``Once more it was proven that 
the well-known 'godfathers' of soccer struck.'' But Tsochadzopoulos 
refused to name the alleged culprits _ bolstering the idea among some 
fans, and club owners, that the fix is in. Some irate PAOK fans even 
saw a broader conspiracy. On Sunday, they burned more than 1,000 cable 
decoders because the pay-TV station that broadcasts league games only 
showed nine minutes of the PAOK match. Whatever the causes, the results 
have driven away many Greeks from what was once a national pastime. 
Some commentators say that may not be a bad idea. ``Maybe we should 
just take the decision that the sickness of which we all speak is 
incurable, that's it and whoever likes it,'' wrote columnist Errikos 
Bartzinopoulos in the Athens daily Ethnos.
