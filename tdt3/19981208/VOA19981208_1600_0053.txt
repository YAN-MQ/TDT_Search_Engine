White House lawyer Gregory Craig and a panel of scholars and experts 
are testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. In an effort 
to dissuade lawmakers from voting for articles of impeachment against 
President Clinton. Mr. Craig told the committee, President Clinton 
is genuinely sorry for his behavior. Regarding his relationship with 
former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. But he said the behavior 
does not warrant impeachment. Here's an exchange between Mr. Craig 
and North Carolina Congressman Elton Gallegly. You believe that the 
President has told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the 
truth. So help him God? To the American people? I do not think he 
violated the oath knowingly. When he testified in front of the Jones 
deposition. The first panel of witnesses for the President included 
a former attorney general. And three scholars who argued that the 
vote for impeachment would set a dangerous precedent.
