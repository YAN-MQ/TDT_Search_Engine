Reorganization is under way for the great atlantic and pacific tea 
company, the owner of a & P supermarket chain. It will open between 
175 and 200 super stores and sell or close over 100 unprofitable locations. 
A modernization plan is also in the company's agenda. There's no word 
on whether the changes will mean job cuts.
