Ed McCaffrey heard the question and smiled. He knew it was coming. 
McCaffrey, one of the top five wide receivers in the National Football 
League, was asked about the day five years ago when he got a phone 
call from then New York Giants Coach Dan Reeves. The team was going 
in another direction _ code for ``sorry, Ed, we're cutting you. Have 
a nice life.'' ``There is no bitterness,'' McCaffrey said as the Broncos 
prepared for Sunday's game against the Giants. ``They made a mistake, 
that's all you can say. I still have a lot of friends in that organization. 
We'll be friendly when I see them, but once the game starts, it's 
all football. But I would be lying if I said there was no extra motivation 
for me.'' Then, almost in midsentence, McCaffrey (55 receptions for 
951 yards and 10 touchdowns this season) switched to his favorite 
subject. The same topic his teammates, the coaching staff and the 
owner Pat Bowlen are not shy to talk about. ``What is more important 
than anything I want to do is keeping this streak going,'' McCaffrey 
said. ``We have a goal, and we think we can accomplish it. That's 
what I'm focusing on.'' That goal is to go 19-0, a record no team 
has attained in NFL history. As each victory becomes more impressive, 
as each opposing player treats a game with Denver (13-0) as if it 
is the most important of his life, the pressure grows. Most teams 
in this situation would go into hiding, fearing that talking about 
an undefeated season would distract them. That would be the normal 
NFL way _ run and hide in the training room during the week when the 
media enters the room. Can you imagine if the Jets were in this position? 
Coach Bill Parcells would fine any player who publicly used the word 
``unbeaten'' or any variation thereof. This isn't what is happening 
with the Broncos. Want to chat about 19-0 with them? Pull up a chair. 
``Why not talk about it?'' tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``We may 
be able to do something special. I'm proud of that. I want to talk 
about it.'' Of course, Sharpe has never met a subject he didn't like 
to talk about, including time travel, the War of 1812 and ``Ally McBeal.'' 
``We're never cocky,'' he said. ``We never go into a game thinking, 
`We're great, we can just show up.' But this is a very confident team. 
We feel good about every game we go into. Of course we're always going 
to be asked about going undefeated. I get asked when I'm out walking 
somewhere. I can't go to the store without being asked and it doesn't 
bother me a bit.'' One of the reasons is Coach Mike Shanahan, who 
had told his team during a meeting several weeks ago not to be scared 
of chasing the record because they had a chance to make history. It 
was a smart move by a smart coach _ once the players saw how their 
leader wasn't intimidated by the chase, they took the same position. 
``We've got a lot to lose,'' defensive end Harald Hasselbach said. 
``I think we've got more to lose than any other team. I know what 
we expect of ourselves, anything short of that would just be a failure, 
so we're going to do everything in our power to ensure that doesn't 
happen.'' What makes these Broncos so dangerous _ besides great talent 
and coaching _ is the belief that destiny is in their hands. They 
trailed the Kansas City Chiefs by 10 points on Sunday going into the 
fourth quarter, had three turnovers, a botched punt, a blocked field 
goal and two key penalties in the second half _ but still won, 35-31. 
The Broncos have not played as efficiently the past two weeks _ seven 
turnovers after committing only nine in the first 11 games _ but one 
never gets a feeling that Denver is in danger of losing a game. Are 
the turnovers a result of the pressure of perfection? Probably not. 
They have more to do with every team playing its best as the Broncos 
get closer to 19 victories. ``You play the Denver Broncos and you 
can have it any way you want it,'' Sharpe said. ``We can stab you 
in the heart. Or we can shoot you in the head. You pick. Either way, 
it's a death.'' One more victory and the Broncos will earn the record 
for consecutive victories at 19. Also, only the Broncos, the 1934 
Chicago Bears and 1972 Miami Dolphins opened the season 13-0. And 
like the Broncos, those two teams probably also felt their stomachs 
tighten late in the season. More microphones from around the country 
are being stuck in the faces of the defending Super Bowl champions 
with each passing week. But don't expect to see irritation or empty 
locker rooms. Ask the Broncos about their season, then clear your 
afternoon calendar. Be prepared to listen. And listen some more.
