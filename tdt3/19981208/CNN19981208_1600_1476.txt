Some of the most talented percussionists in pop music are joining 
together to focus attention on how rhythm can help people with disabling 
injuries. Paul Vercammen has the story. Members of this drum circle 
of friends have played with elite music acts. Luis Conte, Madonna, 
James Taylor. Walfredo Reyes Jr., Santana, Steve Winwood, tris embodan. 
They showed unity unique to percussionists. Maybe because there are 
so many drummers jokes. They're all taking shots at us. These all-stars 
rallied around a cause -- a belief that drumming can help sufferers 
of debilitating injuries. It's just a beautiful thing the sound of 
it -- it's good for your brain, it helps you relax. And they rallied 
around a colleague, drummer and organizer Eddie tuduri. I've been 
on some benefits where some musicians are trying to get it off the 
ground. And as soon as Eddie tuduri stepped in, it happened in a big 
way. Tuduri cheated death and paralysis after breaking his neck while 
body surfing more than a year ago in these waters. I love the ocean. 
I've always loved the ocean. And I'm not angry because the ocean has 
maybe taken something from me. But what's its given me in return is 
a hundred fold. The accident gave tuduri an idea that he and other 
patients at santa Barbara's rehabilitation institute could improve 
their fates through drumming. So he put together a rhythm therapy 
program and this fundraiser. For the clinic. So how does rhythm therapy 
work? Mainly, because it's a distraction from the grueling process 
of rehabilitation. Some of the therapy is very needed, very necessary. 
But it's tedious, it's painful. This isn't painful. It awakens something 
in there. Em kull suffered a stroke. It gives you a shot in the arm 
that you don't get at other times. Tuduri himself exemplifies this 
power of positive thumping. Paul Vercammen, "CNN Entertainment News," 
Santa Barbara.
