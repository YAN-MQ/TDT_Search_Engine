Well, I don't know what kind of message is going to be spread when 
they catch this criminal up in Buffalo, New York. They're trying to 
catch a door knob bandit. For the last three months, somebody in Buffalo 
has been entering older homes, stealing antique brass door knobs, 
door plates, knockers. Now many of these fixtures are really worth 
hundreds of dollars. Police say the thief must be selling them to 
antique dealers. There's also a big market for them on the west coast 
of the United States, far from the east coast city of Buffalo where 
out on the west coast they don't have as many old homes of the vintage 
that they may in Buffalo. Detectives have confiscated some of the 
stolen items from antique shops and they've been working with a collector 
in Buffalo to try to match them to the homes from which they were 
taken. Beware the door knob thief.
