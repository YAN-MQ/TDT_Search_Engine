China, responding to a news report that it sent missile technology 
to Iran, denied Tuesday aiding weapons proliferation and said it has 
honored its arms-control commitments. But Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Zhu Bangzao did not confirm or deny the report by the Washington Times 
newspaper that China sent Iran equipment in November that could be 
used to test medium-range missiles. China agreed in 1994 not to sell 
surface-to-surface missiles, but U.S. officials suspect they may be 
supplying technologies used to develop missiles. Chinese and U.S. 
officials met in November to discuss China's joining the 32-nation 
Missile Technology Control Regime, which President Jiang Zemin promised 
to consider in June. ``China's position on the export of missiles 
has proceeded always from being responsible for security in the region 
and has honored its commitment by adopting effective and strict controls, 
and there is no such issue of proliferation,'' Zhu said at a briefing. 
The Washington Times said China had supplied Iran with telemetry equipment 
that could be used in testing missiles such as its new Shahab-3, which 
was tested for the first time this year.
