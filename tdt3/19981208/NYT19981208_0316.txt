Republican moderates, the largest bloc of undecided votes on impeachment 
in the House, said that President Clinton's first day of defense on 
Tuesday may have slowed what had seemed to be growing momentum behind 
a vote to impeach him. But many of those moderates said that Tuesday's 
testimony left unanswered many of their most pressing questions about 
the president's behavior and his fitness to govern, and they urged 
Clinton or his allies to provide a sharper, less evasive explanation 
of his actions in the Monica Lewinsky affair. ``Has he eroded his 
credibility to the point where he can't govern?'' asked Rep. Rick 
Lazio, R-N.Y. ``There is nothing that addressed that today. For the 
core issues that are at the heart of this for me, today's hearing 
wasn't on point.'' Despite such concerns, a leading moderate Republican, 
Rep. Amo Houghton from Corning, N.Y., decided that he would vote against 
impeachment on the House floor. Houghton would become the sixth House 
Republican to say publicly that he opposed impeachment. ``The main 
issue is how to heal, rather than further divide, the nation,'' Houghton 
said in an op-ed article to be published in the New York Times on 
Wednesday. ``Of course morals and decency and the laws we live by 
are all important. But can anyone argue that these threads are made 
stronger if we dismiss someone from office instead of issuing a strong 
rebuke?'' A centrist Democrat who had voted in favoring of opening 
an impeachment inquiry into the president also said on Tuesday that 
he was leaning against impeachment. The Democrat, Rep. Jim Maloney 
of Connecticut, said that Republicans who have been demanding that 
Clinton admit that he lied before a grand jury were asking for the 
impossible: that the president admit to a crime. ``It's in effect 
a trick question,'' Maloney said. ``They want him to admit to something 
on the basis that that will solve all of our little problems. But 
they are asking him to step into a criminal prosecution two years 
hence. That's the kind of partisan posturing that is counter-productive.'' 
In many ways, the White House's two-day presentation before the Judiciary 
Committee is aimed mainly at winning over the three dozen or so moderate 
Republicans who remain undecided about impeachment. Many of those 
moderates come from districts where Clinton did well in the 1996 election 
and where sentiment for impeaching him is weak. Many of those moderates 
have said that they consider the president's behavior abhorrent, but 
that they would prefer a less severe punishment than impeachment. 
So they have been waiting for the president's team to present a vigorous 
defense before the Judiciary Committee that could provide arguments, 
facts or shreds of new evidence that could justify bucking their leadership 
and voting against impeachment. It is not clear they got what they 
were looking for on Tuesday. ``I am desperately looking for a reason 
that it can be explained away,'' said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., 
referring to Clinton's misleading statements about the Lewinsky affair. 
``I just wish the president had gone before the committee. No one 
speaks better for Bill Clinton than himself. I just wish he'd spent 
more time explaining himself than having his attack dogs go after 
these issues.''
