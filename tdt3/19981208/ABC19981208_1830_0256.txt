As Linda Douglass points out the White House will need to win over 
several republicans. There are varying estimates about how many republicans 
still have to make up their minds, how might they be influenced? ABC's 
Sam Donaldson is with us at the White House. What does the president 
have in mind. You ask what the president can do to help himself now. 
The most-often-heard suggestion is that he addresses the nation with 
a Combination of new confession and renewed contrition, but some of 
the president's advisers say that's a risky approach. Today, before 
the house Judiciary committee, former committee members who voted 
for Richard Nixon's impeachment back in 1974 said they thought Mr. 
nixon could have saved himself by confessing. Had he gone public and 
said, "I apologize," my sense is the public would have forgiven him. 
But when it comes to contrition from President Clinton, he has already 
gone down that road. In Moscow -- I have acknowledged that I made 
a mistake. In Dublin -- It was indefensible and I am sorry about it. 
At a White House prayer breakfast -- I don't think there is a fancy 
way to say I have sinned. Now, some of his advisers fear, for the 
president to say it all again would be seen as a cynical ploy rather 
than a sincere act. And when it comes to further confession -- In 
regard to the perjury allegations -- Perjury, lying under oath. That 
would be lying under oath or perjury, won the it? Perjury is a criminal 
offense, whether impeachable or not, and ever since his first public 
admission in August Mr. Clinton has refused to admit he lied under 
oath. But some moderate republicans, including Rick Lazio says the 
point is not to subject Mr. Clinton to criminal prosecution but to 
hear him say he lied. I don't think anyone is trying to set him up. 
What we're trying to say here is that the president has got to admit 
to his wrongdoing. Even without doing anything more, the president 
picked up support from another New York republican congressman who 
will announce in tomorrow morning's "New York Times" that he will 
vote no. That doesn't end the anxiety here and despite the risk of 
going public once again, one of the president's top aides thinks Mr. 
Clinton will do that. Peter? Thank you, Sam. Sam Donaldson at the 
White House.
