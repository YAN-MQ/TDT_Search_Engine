Shunning a reprise of the lavish, three-day inauguration gala in 1995 
that shadowed his first term in office, Gov. George Pataki announced 
Tuesday that he would celebrate his second swearing-in with a decidedly 
more modest affair: an $80-a-head reception in a hotel ballroom in 
Albany on New Year's Day. Pataki's aides explained the scaled-down 
celebration by saying that the Republican governor's re-election in 
November was less momentous than his 1994 defeat of Gov. Mario Cuomo, 
the three-term Democrat. Accordingly, Pataki has decided to forgo 
laser lights, 19-gun salutes, orchestral tributes and a black-tie 
gala, which entertained the 13,000 people who heralded his arrival 
in Albany in 1995. That inauguration, combined with the transition, 
cost $2.5 million. By rough estimates, the 1999 inaugural (there obviously 
will be no transition costs) will be closer to $25,000. ``This is 
a second inaugural,'' said Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha. ``And 
therefore, it will be significantly smaller in scale.'' Ms. Mucha 
said Pataki's decision did not reflect discomfort with the political 
and legal hangover that was created by the way his aides organized 
and financed the first inaugural. The first time, Pataki's advisers 
created private committees to finance the inaugural and the transition, 
and declined to disclose a list of the donors or spending. Assembly 
Democrats sued to force Pataki's committees to release some of the 
details of the operation. Those records, released under court order, 
revealed that much of the money had come from corporations doing business 
with the state. The battle continues to this day. The Court of Appeals, 
the state's highest court, is expected to rule later this month on 
a continuing attempt by Assembly Democrats to force Pataki to divulge 
even more detailed information about his committee's fund-raising 
and spending. No such committee will be formed this time, Ms. Mucha 
said. The guests at Pataki's 1999 reception _ estimated at 300 people 
_ will write their $80 checks directly to the Omni Hotel in Albany. 
Ms. Mucha said the checks would cover the costs of renting the space 
and a lunch. Ms. Mucha said she knew no details of the entertainment 
or menu. A spokesman for Assembly Democrats, Pat Lynch, declined comment 
on the planned celebrations. Pataki's event comes at a time when he 
has suggested he might be considering running for national office, 
and thus he would presumably not want to stage the kind of lavish 
celebration that would allow Assembly Democrats to create the problems 
for him this time that they did the last time around. Ms. Mucha insisted, 
though, that that factor had not entered into this decision. ``It's 
traditional to have second and third inaugurals be a lot more low-key,'' 
she said.
