It was a dark day in San Francisco and the rest of the bay area as 
well. A blackout cut off power to nearly 1 million people. There No 
major accidents. There was some chaos and it was certainly a major 
disruption. Here's ABC's Brian Rooney. The antique cable cars stopped 
rolling and so did the modern trains which that shrugged off the 1989 
earthquake. The airport was closed for an hour. And flights were delayed 
for four. Traffic was backed up and commuters packed the ferries to 
avoid the road. Like this, trust us. The computers are gone and the 
-- and in one of those only-in-San Francisco moments, a homeless man 
directed traffic. Most of San Francisco was blacked out in broad daylight, 
after a Construction crew interrupted a main line at a switching station 
south of the city. I don't have the details, but that set off a series 
of events, which set off the loss of power to a large portion of San 
Francisco. Firefighters spent the morning rescuing people stranded 
in elevators and stopped subway cars. It was hard to get money, ATM 
machines didn't work, and it was no better going in the bank. If you 
had money, you couldn't spend it. Businesses closed for lack of power 
to run the cash Register, although the ones that had power were ready 
to cash in. We got food. Come on in. By early afternoon, the Christmas 
tree in union square was once again sparkling with lights, and the 
power company was assuring everyone things would return to normal 
by tonight. But to paraphrase Mark Twain, the darkest winter night 
was a day in San francisco. Brian Rooney, ABC News, San Francisco.
