In Asia, Japanese stocks closed up, despite trimming earlier gains. 
The benchmark NIKKEI stock index up nearly 6/10 of 1 percent. A key 
Japanese economic planner warns the economy remains in "a very severe 
situation" but there are signs of improvement. In a report to Japan's 
prime minister, the economic planning agency acknowledged the slump 
in economic activities prolonged. But the agency says it can say there 
are emerging indications the economy has hit or is close to hitting 
bottom. Ken Ocamura is an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in 
Tokyo. It's quite clear for example, if you look at things like industrial 
production that adjustment is quite far advanced in Japan and the 
rate of deterioration is no longer getting any worse. And so it's 
probably right to say that we may have a cyclical bottom as far as 
the economy is concerned. The report cites firm sales in home appliances, 
food and small cars. Mr. Ocamura expects that positive Japanese economic 
growth will be clearly seen by the middle of next year.
