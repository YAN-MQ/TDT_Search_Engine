The chairman of bank of America says he's offended by questions about 
his company's commitment to promoting women. He released a statement 
that says the bank is firmly committed to advancing the most qualified 
people. His letter comes in response to a newspaper report that says 
since the merger of BankAmerica and Nationsbank, BankAmerica's top 
ten female executives either have left the company or have less authority.
