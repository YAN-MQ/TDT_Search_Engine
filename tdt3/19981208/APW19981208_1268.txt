A high school vice principal and gym teacher have been ordered to 
stay away from students after they conducted a mass strip search of 
ninth-grade boys in quest of some stolen money. The strip search, 
carried out last week at Kingsville District High School in southwestern 
Ontario, prompted a walkout by about 200 students Monday. On Tuesday, 
Ontario Premier Mike Harris joined in the widespread condemnation 
of the search, calling it repulsive. On Friday, gym teacher Dan Bondy 
summoned vice principal John MacDonald to help him search students 
after none of the 20 boys in a gym class would admit to having stolen 
dlrs 90 from a fellow student. The two staff members ordered the boys 
to come one by one into an office, where they were subjected to a 
strip search. The stolen money was not found. After complaints from 
parents and students, education officials opened an investigation 
of the incident and ordered MacDonald and Bondy to stay away from 
students for the time being. Neither man could be reached for comment 
Tuesday. They were not at school, and their telephones went unanswered. 
``In my 33 years in education I've never heard anything like this,'' 
said Val Pistor, director of education for the regional school board. 
He called the search a ``violation of the rights, dignity and respect 
of children.'' Harris, a conservative who favors back-to-basics reforms 
in the public school system, had no sympathy for the two staff members. 
``I personally think back to teenage years and Grade 9 and the challenges 
of puberty and of a very sensitive age and I can't imagine that there 
is a teacher or vice principal anywhere in Ontario that would have 
been party to anything like this,'' he said. ``I find it abhorrent.'' 
Canada's Supreme Court has ruled teachers and principals have the 
right to search students on school premises if they believe school 
rules are being broken. But the court set guidelines on when searches 
are reasonable and how they should be conducted. Ontario's education 
minister, Dave Johnson, said searches are supposed to be limited to 
a search for weapons and drugs, not money. He said strip searches 
at schools are never acceptable. Kingsville is about 25 miles (40 
kilometers) southeast of Windsor, Ontario.
