The White House has been transformed into a winter wonderland for 
the holidays. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton chose this year's 
decorative theme. It includes frosted Birch trees in the grand Foyer 
and sugar-coated likenesses of first pets buddy and socks in an elaborate 
gingerbread castle. The centerpiece of the White House winter wonderland 
is an 18 1/2-foot balsam fir chrismas tree that stands in the center 
of the blue room, sparking with 2,700 lights.
