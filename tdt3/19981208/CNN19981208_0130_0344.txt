Secretary of state Madeleine Albright says the United States believes 
the mideast peace agreement requires equal participation by the Israelis 
and palestinians to work. She met with Israeli foreign minister ariel 
Sharon Monday to discuss ways for the peace process to move forward. 
The Palestinians say Israel has violated the accord by not releasing 
political prisoners. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has 
stopped troop withdrawals from the West Bank. He says the Palestinian 
authority is behind recent anti-Israeli riots. Palestinian police 
fired from rooftops onto a crowd of 3,000 people Monday in the West 
Bank city of Nablus, injuring at least five people. Many were bystanders 
who had gathered to watch rioters protest Israel's refusal to release 
Palestinian prisoners.
