With "CNN Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven. Well, it's pretty simple 
-- if you run on the field in Tampa, you get hammered. Monday, the 
Bucs snapped a six-game losing streak to the Packers with a 24-22 
victory. Trent Dilfer threw for two scores and ran for another. Tampa 
bay is right back in the playoff Hunt. Green bay failed to Clinch 
a wild card berth. We still can get in the playoffs with a win. Hopefully 
get guys back well. We probably won't have a bye. Who cares? I mean, 
we got to play 'em all. Meanwhile, green bay lost key offensive lineman 
Frank winters for the season with a broken leg.
