National Football League team owners will vote by conference call 
this week. On the question of instant replay. The owners decided not 
to bring back the video review of controversial plays before the season 
started. But a series of poor calls by referees in recent weeks and 
the infamous coin toss incident have owners and the League reconsidering. 
The latest bad call came Sunday during a game between the New York 
Jets and Seattle Seahawks. A line judge indicated Jets quarterback 
Vinnie Testeverde broke the goal plane with a football to score the 
winning touchdown. Television replays clearly showed he did not score. 
Testeverde says the referee's call is now irrelevant. The angle from 
the replay was a tough angle for viewers to swallow it as a touchdown. 
But they called it a touchdown. Whether you call it a break for the 
Jets or not is irrelevant. We're nine in four, and we move forward. 
If the majority of owners vote yes for the replay. A limited form 
of it could be reinstated for the upcoming NFL Playoffs. Getting underway 
later this month.
