Italian side Bologna moved into the quarterfinals of the UEFA Cup 
on a 4-2 aggregate despite losing to Spain's Betis 1-0 Tuesday in 
the third round, second leg of the UEFA Cup. Oliverio Alvarez scored 
for Betis in the fourth minute for the only goal of the match after 
the Spaniards were hammered 4-1 in the first leg two weeks ago in 
Italy.
