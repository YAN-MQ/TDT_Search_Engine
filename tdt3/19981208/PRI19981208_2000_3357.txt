She has sold more than 10 million albums worldwide, has enough gold 
discs to make Fort Knox look a little bit like a piggy bank. She is 
Italy's 24 year-old pop diva, Lauda Palcini. Her fame began just five 
years ago when she took the stage in Europe's prestigious Salramos 
Song Festival. If you are listening closely, you will notice that 
the words to this track are not in Italian, but in Spanish. Palcini 
has recorded her latest CD, La Miearisposta, that is Italian, My answer, 
in both Italian and Spanish. Even her official web site is in three 
languages. Palcini is holding off courting American audiences for 
the time being, but her label is pushing her Spanish recordings in 
Latin America and other Spanish speaking markets. Here is the title 
track from the Spanish version of La Miearisposta, called Mierestposta. 
Music from Italy's Lauda Palcini, brings this edition of The World 
to a close. We are on line 24 hours a day at www.theworld.org. In 
Boston, I am Tony Kahn, please join us again tomorrow. For another 
spin of The World.
