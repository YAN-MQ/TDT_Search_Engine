At least 18 people were killed and another 30 wounded in clashes between 
two rival clans in a busy marketplace in the central Somali town of 
Baidoa, witnesses said Tuesday. Witnesses in the town, contacted by 
VHF radio, said fighting broke out Monday between the Rahanwein Resistance 
Army and forces loyal to faction leader Hussein Aidid for control 
of Baidoa, 150 kilometers (95 miles) northwest of the capital Mogadishu. 
Most of the dead and wounded were civilians, the reports said. Mohamed 
Ali Aden Qaline, a spokesman for the RRA in the Mogadishu, told reporters 
his forces launched the attack to capture the town from Aidid's militiamen. 
He said RRA fighters killed 10 of Aidid's men and destroyed five of 
their machine gun-mounted battle trucks. Three of his own fighters 
were killed, six more were wounded, and one RRA gun-mounted vehicle 
was lost, he said. A militiaman loyal to Aidid, a powerful faction 
leader who recently joined forces with another former rival to set 
up a municipal administration in the formerly divided Mogadishu, said 
six of Aidid's men were killed in the Baidoa fighting and 14 were 
wounded. He said his faction captured two armed vehicles and forced 
the RRA to retreat. Aidid late Monday sent more than 100 heavily armed 
men in 15 battle trucks to reinforce his fighters in Baidoa. The town 
was quiet Tuesday under Aidid's control, the witnesses said.
