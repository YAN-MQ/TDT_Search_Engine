For the first time since 1951, there will be no National Basketball 
Association All-Star game. It's Day 162 of the lockout. No new bargaining 
talks are scheduled. Do you think the season is in peril? Canceling 
the All-Star game, the league's signature regular-season event, had 
been expected for a week, but Commissioner David Stern's announcement 
on Tuesday revealed the dire straits the season is in. ``This is just 
a result of the inexorable march of the calendar,'' Stern said. ``There 
just isn't enough time left to have a season and an All-Star game.'' 
The game had been scheduled for Feb. 14 in Philadelphia. Stern spoke 
to Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell on Tuesday morning, and it is 
possible that Philadelphia would be awarded the game in 2002. The 
Golden State Warriors, who play in San Francisco, will host next season's 
game, and the 2001 game is likely to go to the Washington Wizards. 
Billy Hunter, the union executive director, said Tuesday in a statement: 
``Sadly, the owners have elected to cheat millions of fans and the 
city of Philadelphia out of a wonderful spectacle. Unfortunately for 
the owners, their effort to further intimidate the players will not 
succeed. We have already offered unprecedented concessions and are 
willing to negotiate even further but we will only accept a deal that 
is fair to both sides. ``The owners should either come to the table 
now and negotiate in good faith to end the lockout or take us up on 
our offer to bring in a mediator who will examine the issues from 
a neutral perspective and help settle the differences. There is still 
enough time to limit the damage caused to our sport but only if the 
owners turn constructive rather than destructive.'' Hunter last week 
deemed Jan. 1 as a date in which a deal must be imminent to salvage 
the season. ``He might be right. I don't know,'' NBA deputy commissioner 
Russ Granik said. Said Stern: ``If we and our players, who are ultimately 
going to have to work together to rebuild this sport, can't make this 
deal, I don't think there is that much hope for the sport itself.'' 
Philadelphia officials estimated that the city and its business will 
lose out on about $40 million because of the All-Star game's cancellation. 
Eighteen hotels, which had set aside more than 5,000 rooms for the 
league, had expected to make more than $6 million. Two weeks ago, 
the league canceled Jam Session, a four-day event of displays and 
interactive events linked to the game that had been expected to draw 
as many as 100,000 people to the Philadelphia Convention Center. The 
cancellation also will mean a substantial loss in advertising revenue 
for NBC and Turner Broadcasting. Last year the game drew a 10.6 rating, 
meaning 10.6 million households with televisions were tuned into the 
game at New York's Madison Square Garden. Only the Christmas Day game 
draws a similar regular-season rating. Turner Sports drew a 2.7 rating 
for its All-Star Saturday show last season, a rating 1 point higher 
than its regular season average of 1.7. ``Like all other NBA fans, 
we are disappointed by the cancellation of the All-Star game,'' said 
Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports. ``But we continue to be hopeful 
that an agreement can be reached and the season will resume next month.'' 
But both networks have clauses in their contracts with the NBA to 
recoup the losses through added games or reduced rights fees in subsequent 
seasons. The league did shed some light Tuesday on what kind of season 
might be salvaged if an agreement is reached. Granik said the NBA 
is willing to extend the playoffs until the end of June, which is 
about 10 days later than usual. But they would not go into July. ``The 
households using television drops off so dramatically as you approach 
July 4 weekend that I don't think that's a realistic possibility,'' 
he said. What's more, if a season is held, some of the younger, running 
teams in the league may reap immediate benefits. To hold a representative 
season, teams may be required to play three nights in a row. Also, 
cross-country travel will be significantly cut down. ``I would expect, 
that whatever number of games is agreed upon, you're going to see 
a conference-type schedule with perhaps some mix of inter-conference 
games,'' Granik said. ``But not every team is going to see every other 
team at home. I think that's going to be virtually impossible.''
