At a farewell party given by his staff, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., 
said Tuesday night that it would be ``a grave mistake'' for the Republican 
Party and the nation if the House impeached President Clinton. D'Amato, 
who after 18 years in the Senate was defeated last month by Democratic 
Rep. Charles Schumer, led Whitewater hearings in the Senate two years 
ago that were sharply critical of the president, Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
and many of their top aides. During the Senate race, D'Amato refused 
to state his views about the impeachment referral. Polls show New 
Yorkers overwhelmingly oppose the removal of Clinton, and on Tuesday 
D'Amato said for the first time that he agreed. ``I'm not suggesting 
that we ignore the misdeeds of the president,'' D'Amato said. ``But 
I am suggesting that we look to what the people are saying. I'm not 
saying we give the president a gold star. But for the Senate to spend 
weeks and weeks mired in this doesn't make sense. If we want to be 
a unified national party and have a country that is unified, we have 
to get this behind us.'' He also said House approval of any articles 
of impeachment ``would result in great and unnecessary discord.''
