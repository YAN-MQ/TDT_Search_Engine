United Nations weapons monitors carried out a series of surprise inspections 
of Iraqi sites today. As part of what they say will be a week of intensive 
inspection. Iraq's main liaison officer with the inspectors said they 
carried out about two dozen inspections, including unannounced visits 
to seven locations that are not part of the team's routine monitoring 
program. Chief Arms Inspector, Richard Butler is expected to report 
next week to the UN Secretary General on whether Iraq has kept its 
promise to cooperate fully with the inspections.
