New pictures from the galileo spacecraft are showing a fault line 
on the surface of europa, one of Jupiter's moons. Scientists are comparing 
it to the San Andreas fault on earth. They say the fault doesn't appear 
to be active but studying it may teach them about the earth's movement. 
Europa is covered by an icy crust. Because water may be under the 
crust, scientists speculate europa may support some life forms.
