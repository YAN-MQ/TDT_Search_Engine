President Clinton's lawyers make their case against impeachment today 
before the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. Clinton is only the third 
president ever to face impeachment proceedings. VOA's Paula Wolfson 
reports committee members will vote later this week on a recommendation 
to the full House of Representatives. Today's hearing will mark the 
beginning of the end of the committee's work. Mr. Clinton's legal 
team will spend two days trying to convince lawmakers the evidence 
does not warrant his removal from office. Committee Chairman Henry 
Hyde says he hopes to hear a detailed rebuttal of the report sent 
to Congress by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. I will listen most 
intently to see if anybody, anybody repudiates, rejects, rebuts the 
facts. His committee has already started work on articles of impeachment, 
legislation that will formally charge the president with impeachable 
offenses. But Mr. Hyde says the drafting process will be put on hold 
until the president's lawyers complete their presentation. There is 
no doubt the legislation will clear the committee easily either Friday 
or Saturday on a strict party line vote. The real drama will come 
when the articles of impeachment hit the full House, sometime next 
week. Paula Wolfson, VOA news, Capitol Hill.
