South African President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday met with Saudi King 
Fahd and discussed a deal to sell arms worth dlrs 1.5 billion to this 
oil-rich state, diplomats said. The two countries have been negotiating 
the agreement to sell motorized artillery pieces and anti-aircraft 
weapons for more than a year, diplomats who attended the meeting said. 
They spoke on condition of anonymity. No other details of the talks 
were available. Mandela arrived here earlier Tuesday from the United 
Arab Emirates where he attended on Monday the opening of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council summit. Mandela and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan were the first leaders outside the group to attend the annual 
GCC summit, which first met in 1981. GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, 
UAE, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain. The official Saudi Press Agency said 
Mandela and Fahd ``discussed bilateral relations and ways of strengthening 
them.'' The meeting was attended by Saudi ambassador to the United 
States, Bandar bin Sultan, who is considered the architect of Saudi-South 
African relations. Mandela was accompanied by South African Foreign 
Minister Alfred Nzo, Saudi officials said. Economic relations between 
the two nations have been growing in recent years. South Africa hopes 
the increasing ties will lessen its reliance on Iran for oil, from 
which it imports more than two-thirds of its crude oil needs, according 
to South African press reports. During a visit to Saudi Arabia last 
year, Mandela signed a tentative agreement on importing 15,000 barrels 
a day from Saudi Arabia. Bilateral trade has risen dramatically since 
the two countries restored relations in 1994. South Africa's exports 
to Saudi Arabia more than doubled from dlrs 47 million in 1994 to 
dlrs 95 million in 1996. Saudi Arabia's exports, mainly oil, jumped 
from dlrs 8 million in 1994 to dlrs 207 million in 1996. Last year, 
their total trade was dlrs 450 million.
