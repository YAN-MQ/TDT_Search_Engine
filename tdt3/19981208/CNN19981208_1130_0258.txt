It's business as usual for the president today, as he opened a White 
House conference on social security. While the president did not offer 
any solutions, he did encourage bipartisan cooperation on the issue. 
While republicans and democrats say they will work together on the 
future of social security, some republicans have objected to the president's 
lack of a plan. The two-day event includes 250 people from all walks 
of life, including lawmakers and policy advocates.
