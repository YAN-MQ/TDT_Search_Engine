Despite a crippling pay dispute with team owners, National Basketball 
Association players are getting ready to return to the courts in Atlantic 
City, New Jersey. The idled NBA stars will play December 19th in a 
charity game. Portions of the proceeds will be donated to UNICEF. 
The rest of the money will be distributed among the lowest paid players 
in the NBA who are being hardest hit by the current work stoppage. 
The idea of underprivileged players is difficult for many to accept. 
Miami Heat center Alonzo Morning, a multimillionaire, is concerned 
about his fellow players. I realize there's a lot of people out there, 
especially during this day and time that are struggling tremendously 
and we're not asking for any sympathy at all. You know, what we're 
asking is that you all understand our situation. Ticket prices for 
the game range from $25 to $1,000 for court side seats. Superstar 
Michael Jordan will not be in the game December 19th. Jordan's agents 
say he's not decided if he'll continue his NBA career when the lockout 
is over. He doesn't want to give fans any mixed messages by playing. 
Meanwhile, no discussions are on the horizon to try to end the lingering 
NBA lockout. Players and team owners remain at odds over the split 
of about $2 billion in annual revenues.
