With the death toll from more than three weeks of freezing weather 
at 91 on Tuesday, the government has given 5 million zlotys (dlrs 
1.5 million) to groups that help the homeless. Government spokesman 
Jaroslaw Sellin said the money from Treasury reserves went to non-government 
organizations and shelters for the homeless. Most of the dead from 
the cold front that arrived Nov. 16 were drunken men who passed out 
in the frigid conditions, police say. Many of the victims were homeless. 
Shelters for the homeless have been overcrowded and running low on 
money. Due to the numbers seeking shelter, welfare groups have changed 
their policy and taken in drunken people. The lowest temperature recorded 
during the cold spell was minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). Temperatures 
have risen this week, hovering around minus 5 Celsius (23 Fahrenheit) 
with steady snowfall in several areas. Police say the death toll from 
the cold front already far exceeds the 54 deaths attributed to the 
cold last winter.
