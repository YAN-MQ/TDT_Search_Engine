What a difference one day makes. Doctors say Joe DiMaggio's health 
improved dramatically overnight after suffering a serious turn for 
the worse Monday. The hall-of-famer remains hospitalized in Hollywood, 
Florida, as he tries to recover from lung cancer surgery. We'd like 
him to rest quite a bit. We don't want him to waste effort in some 
of the anxieties that he gets from his clinical situation. So we sedate 
him. He is clearly not comatose. Now that was a rumor circulating 
this morning. And one of the reasons I'm talking to you is to dispel 
that rumor. He is not definitely not comatose.
