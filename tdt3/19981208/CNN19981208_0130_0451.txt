Winter officially begins in a few weeks, but fall and even spring-like 
temperatures are still prevalent in the eastern United States. Monday, 
some parts of Massachusetts received the warmest temperatures ever 
recorded for the month of December. Anyone wondering where the cold 
air is should look west. Children in Las Vegas are getting a rare 
chance to horse around in about an inch of snow. It also snowed in 
the Phoenix area over the weekend.
