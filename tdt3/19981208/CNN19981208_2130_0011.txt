From CNN center, Atlanta, good evening. Lynne Russell with your "Headline 
News." Republicans on the house Judiciary committee have complained 
there hasn't been a single fact-based rebuttal of the allegations 
against president clinton. Now, the White House is offering one. It 
has given the committee a 184-page, point-by-point rebuttal of charges 
against him. The rebuttal addresses the allegation Mr. Clinton tried 
to buy Monica lewinsky's silence by finding her a job. It contends 
-- the White House also drew contrast to the Watergate scandal. It 
wrote -- today was the first of two full days of testimony by witnesses 
for the defense. Gina London joins us from Washington with an update. 
Gina? Hi, good evening, Lynne. Three sets of panelists spent more 
than 11 hours today trying to plead the president's case. It was a 
case made in front of the members of the house Judiciary committee 
who most agree here on Capitol Hill have already made up their minds. 
White House lawyers armed with 14 scheduled panelists. The president's 
misconduct doesn't rise to the standard of impeachment. Do we really 
intend for the second time in our history to impeach a President over 
a case that holds out these weak, puny perjury charges? But committee 
republicans appear unswayed. The president of the United States has 
committed multiple acts of making false statements under oath. And 
that's a serious marry. At least two of the panelists today urged 
the committee to come up with a bipartisan solution to punishing the 
president, like censure. I want to urge what my colleague Wayne Owen 
said, which is to find an alternative that can bring republicans and 
democrats together. Alternatives may be raised on the floor of the 
full house, but as for the committee, most agree the die is cast along 
party lines to approving at least one article of impeachment. if it's 
2116, so be it. Tomorrow morning, as you mentioned, Charles ruff, 
White House counsel will be given the chance to take a crack at changing 
more minds. In Washington, I'm Gina London. Now back to you, Lynne. 
Thank you, Gina.
