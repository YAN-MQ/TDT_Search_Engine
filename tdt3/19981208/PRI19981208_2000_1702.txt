We love hearing from you so call us with your feedback, if you would, 
about The World. Our listener line at WGBH is 868-5750. Or you can 
send us e-mail at The World, that is one word, theworld@pri.org. Again 
that e-mail address: theworld@pri.org. This is Public Radio International, 
PRI. Wouldn't it be great if you knew who was going to be on Fresh 
Air tomorrow, not to mention Radio Times, Talk of the Nation, Morning 
Edition, and more. Well, your wishes have been answered, because now 
91 FM will send you that information automatically, every day, by 
electronic mail. To subscribe, visit the 91 FM section of the WHYY 
web site and follow the simple instructions. The web site is located 
at WHYY.org. Once again, that is WHYY.org. I am Tony Kahn, ahead on 
The World, going underground under North Korea, as questions linger 
over a subterranean complex that may be a nuclear weapons development 
site. Also, going back to the future as young Chileans talk about 
Augusto Pinochet. Going to mass with Brazil's hippest priest. And 
going to the birds, a puffin with stuffin'. First, this news. For 
The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom in London.
