While the committee discussed his future, it was business as usual 
today for President Clinton. He opened a special conference at the 
White House on the future of social security. He urged republicans 
and democrats to begin reforming the retirement program to keep it 
solvent. Although Mr. Clinton didn't present any specific proposals, 
he did assert that social security should remain a guarantee for Americans.
