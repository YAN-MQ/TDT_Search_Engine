The FBI has opened its files on Frank Sinatra. In addition to facts, 
the almost 1,300 pages include a number of unproven allegations about 
the singer. Among them, that he had ties to organized crime and that 
he dodged the draft during world war II. The file also includes Sinatra's 
mug shot from his arrest in 1938 on seduction charges. And there's 
information on a death threat Sinatra received in 1969.
