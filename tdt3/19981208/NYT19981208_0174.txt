In Jim Carrey's hit movie ``The Truman Show,'' a young man named Truman 
Burbank discovers that his entire life has been grist for a hit television 
show, that he was brought up by actors playing his parents, married 
to a woman cast as his wife and sent out to live and work on a huge 
stage set. His life is, literally, an ongoing mini-series, the most 
watched home video ever made. In his new book, ``Life the Movie,'' 
the cultural historian Neal Gabler suggests that Americans are all 
becoming Truman Burbank, that life has become ``the biggest, most 
entertaining, most realistic movie of all, one that played 24 hours 
a day, 365 days a year, and featured a cast of billions.'' Even as 
the stratagems of show business are infecting real life, turning journalism, 
politics and religion into forms of entertainment, Gabler argues, 
reality is challenging fiction in strangeness and surreality, creating 
ongoing soap operas starring the likes of O.J. Simpson, Bill Clinton 
and Diana, Princess of Wales. This thesis, it's clear, grows out of 
Gabler's two impressive earlier books: ``An Empire of Their Own: How 
the Jews Invented Hollywood'' (1988), which examined how Hollywood's 
Jewish moguls reinvented themselves as Americans while producing movies 
that created a fantasy version of the United States, and ``Winchell: 
Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity'' (1994), which portrayed 
the gossip columnist Walter Winchell as the avatar of ``the tabloid 
revolution'' that brought us the contemporary concepts of celebrity 
and ``infotainment.'' But while Gabler reprises many of the ideas 
from those earlier volumes in ``Life the Movie,'' he also remains 
heavily indebted, as he acknowledges, to the pioneering work of other 
thinkers like Daniel Boorstin, Dwight Macdonald and Marshall McLuhan. 
The result is an intermittently provocative but highly derivative 
book, a book that tends to read like a discursive magazine article 
padded out to hardcover length. Indeed, a large part of ``Life the 
Movie'' consists of other writers' quotations, embroidered with Gabler's 
observations, rebuttals and addendums. What Gabler calls the ``Zsa 
Zsa Factor'' _ a reference to Zsa Zsa Gabor, meaning, he says, ``fame 
that required having to do no work to get it, save gaining media exposure'' 
_ is really little more than a rephrasing of Boorstin's definition 
of a celebrity as ``a person who is known for his well-knownness.'' 
Gabler's arguments about fame and celebrity are similarly indebted 
to Leo Braudy's ``Frenzy of Renown,'' just as his arguments about 
television and show business owe a debt to Neil Postman's ``Amusing 
Ourselves to Death.'' Since the mid-19th century, Gabler argues, popular 
culture has been a more potent force in America than in Europe: for 
Americans, he writes, entertainment was ``the cultural equivalent'' 
of Andrew Jackson's political egalitarianism. Movies and television 
galvanized the victory of popular entertainment over both high culture 
and its middlebrow cousin, midcult, and promoted what Gabler calls 
``an epistemology in which all information, whatever the source, was 
forced to become entertainment'' in order to capture and hold the 
public's attention. Gabler argues that ``the first portal through 
which entertainment slithered into life and then conquered it was 
journalism'': with the appearance of the penny press of the 1830s, 
more and more newspapers began focusing on sensational stories of 
murder and sex _ a development taken to new heights by William Randolph 
Hearst, who in Gabler's words, ``shifted the newspaper decisively 
from its information function to its story function.'' Nearly a century 
later, television would appease the public's ever growing hunger for 
entertainment by treating news events as disparate as the O.J. Simpson 
case and the Persian Gulf war as real-life prime-time dramas, complete 
with stars, supporting casts and unfurling, serial plots. While television 
was discovering that politics could make good entertainment, politicians 
were discovering that stagecraft could help them shape public perception. 
Staged press conferences, creative campaign ads, cynical photo-ops 
and marathon spin sessions all became de rigueur, as Ronald Reagan 
and Bill Clinton effectively turned politics into another branch of 
show business. Nor was politics the only arena of contemporary life 
to become a thrall of entertainment. Gabler points out that television 
evangelists like Oral Roberts and Jimmy Swaggart ``recast the old 
revival meeting as a television variety show,'' that more and more 
sporting events have ``evolved from competitions to exhibitions'' 
and that contemporary intellectual debate often devolves into the 
sort of ``staged fights'' featured on television shows like ``Crossfire'' 
and ``The McLaughlin Group.'' Though many of Gabler's observations 
_ or his citation of other people's observations _ are interesting, 
he has an annoying tendency to push his thesis so hard that he fails 
to make important distinctions among the examples he cites. In writing 
about the importance of artists' public personas, for instance, he 
lumps together serious figures like Hemingway and Picasso with calculating 
wannabes like Jeff Koons and Julian Schnabel. He suggests that without 
Hemingway's theatrics, only ``litterateurs were likely to pay'' his 
actual books any heed, and asserts that Picasso ``used the very oddness 
of his work'' to market himself to the public ``as an artistic caricature, 
a sort of rarefied bird who painted paintings for rich idiots.'' ) 
In his acknowledgments, Gabler notes that ``Life the Movie'' was intended 
as ``an interstitial book between doorstop-sized biographies of Walter 
Winchell and Walt Disney'' but found that the project grew ``from 
interstitial to interminable.'' Unfortunately for the reader, the 
book too often feels like both: interstitial and interminable, as 
well as secondhand. PUBLICATION NOTES LIFE THE MOVIE How Entertainment
