While the committee discusses his future, it's business as usual for 
President Clinton today. He opened a special conference at the White 
House on social security's future. He urged republicans and democrats 
to begin the process of reforming the cash-strapped system by finding 
common ground and proceeding from there. In this time, America faces 
no more important challenge than the need to save social security 
for the 21st century. Social security is and must remain a rock solid 
guarantee. It is a sacred trust among the generations, between parents 
and children, grandparents and grandchildren, between those in retirement 
and those at work, between the able bodied and the disabled. It embodies 
our obligations to one another and our deepest values as americans. 
Later, the president and first lady flew to Nashville, Tennessee, 
for a Memorial service for Albert Gore Sr. the former U.S. senator 
and father of vice President Al Gore died Saturday at his Tennessee 
farm. He was 90 years old. Mr. Clinton says the Elder Gore was "the 
embodiment of everything public service ought to be."
