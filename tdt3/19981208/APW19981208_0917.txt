Designer Valentino and thousands of strollers joined Pope John Paul 
II Tuesday in a traditional pre-Christmas appointment near the Spanish 
Steps. Romans, Rome's mayor and tourists marking Italy's national 
holiday honoring Mary on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception crowded 
around a column in the middle of the square. The pope brought a basket 
of pink roses to join the other flowers placed earlier in the day 
around the column. John Paul, 78, seemed in form on the chilly but 
crisp day. In last year's ceremony, the pope, whose hip surgery a 
few years ago makes it often hard for him to bend, didn't kneel, but 
this year he did. After the ceremony the pope greeted Valentino, whose 
boutique and headquarters are just off the square. The designer pointed 
out the Valentino Christmas tree nearby, where coins placed into a 
box to turn on the tree lights are donated to help children with AIDS. 
```Bravo,''' the designer said the pope told him. The narrow streets, 
lined with designer boutiques, which lead to the Spanish Steps, were 
packed with tens of thousands of strollers hoping to get a glimpse 
of the pope. One of them, Maria Preti, 71, said she has been coming 
since she was a child to the Dec. 8 ceremony. For Romans like her, 
the annual appointment ``is the beginning of the Christmas season.'' 
The feast day, a national holiday in several other European countries, 
marks the Catholic teaching that Mary was conceived without original 
sin.
