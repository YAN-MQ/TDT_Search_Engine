The Philippine government will allow duty-free imports of most farm 
and fishing equipment for five years to boost agriculture and fishing 
in the country, officials said Tuesday. Government officials signed 
an order Monday authorizing the duty-free imports, to begin this year. 
Agriculture Secretary William Dar said the removal of tariffs will 
allow small farmers to buy equipment they need to modernize farms. 
Small fishermen will also be able to buy cheaper equipment to increase 
their catch. Among the items covered by the order are most types of 
farm tractors and spare parts, irrigation equipment, packaging machines, 
farm chemicals, scales, harvesting equipment and farm vans and trailers, 
the agriculture department said. Also included are plant seedlings, 
semen of selected of animals for breeding, poultry feed and fishing 
nets, the department said. The Philippines is principally an agricultural 
country, and many farms are still tilled by water buffaloes and lack 
irrigation. A prolonged drought last year and a recent series of strong 
typhoons struck agricultural lands in the central and northern Philippines, 
causing sharp drops in production.
