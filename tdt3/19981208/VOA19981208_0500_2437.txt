Lawyers for President Clinton will begin a two-day effort today to 
ward off his impeachment by the House of Representatives over the 
Monica Lewinsky scandal. The lawyers will appear before the House 
Judiciary Committee along with 14 witnesses who will try to convince 
law makers that Mr. Clinton's behavior was not an impeachable offense. 
The president is accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in 
trying to conceal his affair with Ms. Lewinsky who was a former White 
House intern. White House officials are quoted as saying the witnesses 
will focus on constitutional standards for impeachment and historical 
precedents. But Republican committee chairman Henry Hyde criticized 
the White House Monday for failing to call a single witness to repudiate 
or disprove the evidence against Mr. Clinton.
