The archbishop of the southern Russian region of Tatarstan was stabbed 
in the face by a burglar after trying to chase him down, a news report 
said Tuesday. Archbishop Anastasy and his assistant, who was stabbed 
in the arm, were hospitalized in Kazan, Tatarstan's capital. The two 
priests heard someone fiddling with the lock on their house late Monday. 
They opened the door and confronted the burglar, and he ran off, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency said. Anastasy and his assistant tried to chase 
him, but he turned around and stabbed them with a knife, the report 
said. The suspect has been detained. He told police he had lost his 
way and knocked at the archbishop's door to ask directions.
