Aziz told a news conference in Moscow, Iraq is prepared to cooperate 
with the current round of inspections. But he says, they must lead 
to a review of the sanctions next week. U.N. weapons inspectors in 
Iraq continued their work Tuesday. But refused to comment on a statement 
by their chief, Richard Butler. That they would undertake surprise 
inspections of suspected weapons sites. VOA Correspondent Scott Bob 
reports from our Middle East Bureau. The inspectors are undertaking 
what Mr. Butler says is the final test. Of whether Iraq is cooperating 
fully with the disarmament program. The chief weapons inspector says 
after the surprise inspections are completed next week, he will prepare 
a report. The U.N. Security Council says if Iraq is cooperating fully. 
It will undertake a comprehensive review of the inspections program. 
U.N. officials say the review could lead to the lifting of economic 
sanctions against Iraq. However, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Monday, 
called the new inspections team provocative. And said it has lost 
hope of ending the sanctions. Scott Bob, VOA News, Middle East Bureau.
