At least 16 people were injured when a homemade bomb suspected to 
have been planted by Muslim extremists exploded inside a bus in the 
southern Philippines, police said Tuesday. Police said the 11-kilogram 
(24-pound) bomb, made from gunpowder, was near the driver's seat when 
it exploded Monday on the outskirts of Aurora in Zamboanga del Sur 
province. Investigators said they suspect the extremist Abu Sayyaf 
group bombed the bus in retaliation for the bus company's failure 
to pay ``revolutionary taxes.'' Police and the military stepped up 
security at several bus terminals in Zamboanga del Sur following the 
attack. The Abu Sayyaf is believed to have been responsible for the 
kidnapping of Italian priest Luciano Benedetti, who was abducted in 
September and freed last month. They also are believed to be still 
holding an 80-year-old Taiwanese woman and her maid, kidnapped a day 
after Benedetti's abduction. Talks for the release of the two are 
continuing.
