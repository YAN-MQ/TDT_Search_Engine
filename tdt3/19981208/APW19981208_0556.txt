Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday fired coach Horst Ehrmantraut, who 
had guided the Bundesliga club back to the first division. The firing 
came after three consecutive defeats, but Ehrmantraut was also involved 
in a well-publicized feud with sports director Gernot Rohr and other 
club managers. Ehrmantraut was told of his firing by club officials 
when he showed up for the morning practice session and left the field 
in tears. ``The precarious situation in the standings and my criticism 
of the board were the grounds for my firing,'' Ehrmantraut said. Ehrmantraut 
became the sixth Bundesliga coach to be sacked or to resign this season, 
and the third within a week. The 42-year-old coach, who has a reputation 
for stubbornness and modesty, took over at Eintracht two years ago, 
when the club was languishing at the bottom of the second division. 
Without hiring any stars, he built a compact squad of relatively unknown 
players that played unspectacular but modestly successful soccer. 
Eintracht was the first Bundesliga team to defeat Bayern Munich this 
season, but Ehrmantraut had been under fire for his defense-first 
attitude. Eintracht is currently 14th in the 18-team league. Assistant 
coach Berhard Lippert will guide the club in the final two games before 
the winter break, during which Eintracht will appoint a new head coach,
