Parma qualified for the UEFA Cup quarterfinals Tuesday rallying to 
a 3-1 victory, from a 0-1 first-half deficit, against Glasgow Rangers 
in their third-round second-leg match. The Italian team preserved 
a four-year unbeaten home streak in European games on second-half 
goals by Abel Balbo, Stefano Fiore and Enrico Chiesa. Parma advanced 
on a 4-2 aggregate score following a 1-1 draw in the first leg at 
Glasgow. Rangers was eliminated on its first season defeat in the 
European competition that it had started from pre-qualifying rounds. 
German midfielder Jorg Albertz put the Scottish team ahead in the 
28th minute with a powerful diagonal drive from the penalty area edge. 
The Rangers player intercepted an erratic pass by Argentine defender 
Nestor Sensini, rushed through the wide-open Parma defense and sent 
the ball past national team keeper Gianluigi Buffon. Parma's second-half 
rally was made easier by the expulsion of Rangers' Italian defender 
Sergio Porrini in the 45th minute, which forced the visitors one player 
down for the entire second half. Porrini received his second caution 
in the match when he fouled Chiesa who had outpaced him. Rangers immediately 
paid for its reshuffled defense in the 47th when Argentine veteran 
forward Balbo, left unmarked close to the net, kicked in Parma's equalizer. 
Balbo was fed by Chiesa who headed toward the teammate, from an angled 
position, a perfect cross by Argentine Juan Sebastian Veron. Midfielder 
Stefano Fiore put Parma in front in the 62nd with a powerful long-distance 
shot, minutes after entering the field as substitute for Alain Boghossian. 
Another Italian defender of Rangers, Lorenzo Amoruso, definitely sank 
his team when he handed the ball in the penalty area to stop a pass 
to Chiesa. Chiesa, who had tallied Parma's both goals in last Saturday's 
2-0 win against Sampdoria of Genoa, converted the penalty kick in 
the 68th for the final 3-1 score. Parma, which is tied in second place 
with AS Roma in the Italian league standings, kept cool despite the 
first-half deficite and took advantage of playing 11 against 10 as 
Rangers gradually faded out.
