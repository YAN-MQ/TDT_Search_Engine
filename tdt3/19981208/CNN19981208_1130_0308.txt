Astronauts aboard the space shuttle "endeavour" have a pretty light 
schedule today. Yesterday, two astronauts went on a spacewalk to wire 
the international space station. Today, the crew will get ready for 
tomorrow's spacewalk and make a slight orbit change to move the space 
station up three miles. Yesterday, astronauts connected 40 cables 
on the space station, which now has power. The job was expected to 
take five or six hours, but they finished in just four. In all, it 
will take about 75 spacewalks totalling more than 1,100 hours to complete 
the space station.
