The maker of prozac says it will pay a small company $90 million plus 
royalties for a modified version of its drug. Bill Delaney has more. 
In the clean, well-lighted labs of sepracor incorporated, a 200-employee 
company in Marlboro, Massachusetts, business as usual Monday -- On 
a most unusual day for this business, with the announcement of a $90 
million deal with Eli Lilly & company to develop sepracor's new -- 
maybe improved version of prozac. It's huge. We will be able to compete 
even more effectively against other anti-depressants. So we're really 
talking about a $6.5 billion market today, growing to a $10 billion 
market by 2002. An anti-depressant market dominated by Eli Lilly's 
prozac since the drug's introduction in 1987. In 2001, though, Eli 
Lilly's patent on the compound expires, opening the door to less expensive, 
generic versions. What sepracor's done is create a simpler, so-called 
"purified prozac" by removing one of two isomers which are molecular 
mirror images many man-made compounds contain. Sepracor is not the 
first company to investigate single isomer pharmaceuticals. Researchers 
at other companies have studied such applications for decades. The 
difference here that may now pay untold dividends was deciding to 
win patents to make single isomers of already-existing, already enormously 
popular drugs like prozac. Among the potential benefits of purified 
prozac -- fewer side-effects, like sexual dysfunction, in some. And 
it may act as an appetite inhibitor for the obese. Critics say Eli 
Lilly's just minimally retooling its product to get a new patent and 
the exclusivity that keeps prices high. It sounds, in this case, as 
though much more of interest is how much money lilly or sepracor or 
whoever else can make off of it. And it's not clear that patients' 
interests are being put in the forefront. Human testing of the new 
prozac is just beginning. It's expected to be ready no sooner than 
early in the next millennium. Bill Delaney, CNN, Marlboro, Massachusetts.
