Electricity has been restored in the San Francisco Bay Area, after 
a massive power failure left nearly a million people in the dark for 
much of the day. Utility officials were hoping to have virtually all 
the service restored before the afternoon rush hour. Officials say 
the outage began during the morning commute when a construction crew 
accidentally knocked out a power substation. The outage shut down 
public transportation, forced businesses to close, and left it up 
to motorists to figure out what to do at intersections with darkened 
traffic lights.
