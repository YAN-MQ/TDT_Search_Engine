Another leader who observed the Venezuelan election, former Bolivian 
president, Consalo Sanchez de los Ada says the victory of Mr. Chavez 
has sent shock waves through traditional political parties around 
Latin America. We're running scared. We have sweating palms to see 
what happens to parties if they don't adapt to what the people need. 
The former Bolivian president says Latin American parties need to 
come with new leaders who relate to the people and mean something 
to them. One of the things that will be an argument is whether free 
markets and constitutional democracies really are functional entities. 
But I'm sure Venezuela will give us the lead and this will turn out 
successful. Mr. Sanchez de los Ada says he hopes dissenting opinions 
in Venezuela's political reform will not only be tolerated but respected.
