Israel says it will probably not carry out its next West Bank withdrawal. 
As scheduled by Friday. Two days before President Clinton visits the 
region. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Palestinians 
are not fulfilling their obligations under the Wye River Agreement. 
So why should he? The Palestinians reject that charge. Meanwhile, 
U.S. Middle East Envoy, Dennis Ross, is holding talks with Israeli 
and Palestinian leaders. In an effort to resolve the latest crisis 
in the Peace Process. VOA's David Gullis reports from Jerusalem. Mr. 
Ross met separately late Tuesday, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu in Jerusalem. And with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
in Romala. To lay groundwork for the Clinton visit. The President's 
three day stay beginning late Saturday, was to have been a celebration 
of compliance with the Wye River Agreement. But now with implementation 
stalled and tensions high. Chief Palestinian negotiator, Sarab Arakat 
says it is shaping up more like a rescue mission for the Peace Process. 
I would not be surprised to see President Clinton calling for trilateral 
meetings. Between and Arafat. And Prime Minister Netanyahu. I think 
that Clinton's visit now projects a source of hope. Clashes between 
Israeli security forces and Palestinians in the West Bank subsided 
Tuesday. While each side continued to blame the other for the crisis.
