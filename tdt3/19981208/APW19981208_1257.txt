Bordeaux played out a 0-0 draw against Grasshoppers on Tuesday, a 
result that sends the French league leader through to the last eight 
on away goals. The first leg in Zurich ended 3-3. Bordeaux, which 
reached the UEFA Cup final 1996 with a team inspired by Zinedine Zidane, 
controlled most of the match but failed to break down a Swiss team 
content to play on the break. Without the injured Kubilay Turkyilmaz, 
its key striker, Grasshoppers looked impotent in attack, and had midfielder 
Mihai Tararache sent off late in the game for a dangerous tackle. 
Bordeaux coach Elie Baup, without injured central defender Herve Alicarte 
and suspended midfielder Ali Benarbia, stuck to his pre-match promise 
to attack, even though his team only needed a goalless draw to advance. 
In the 15th minute, Sylvain Wiltord - who scored twice in the first 
leg in Zurich and is top scorer in the French league this season - 
made a brilliant run down the right wing, but Michel Pavon's acrobatic 
header from the resulting cross didn't have enough power to trouble 
visiting goalkeeper Pascal Zuberbuehler. Minutes later, Pavon surged 
forward from midfield but saw his dangerous cross-shot cleared by 
the Swiss defense. Grasshoppers had its best chance in the 30th minute, 
when Avraham Tikva, not known for his aerial prowess, headed wide 
when unmarked eight meters (yards) from goal. Grasshoppers advanced 
to the third round by default after Fiorentina, its second round opponent, 
was expelled from the competition after an Italian spectator hurled 
an explosive device on to the pitch.
