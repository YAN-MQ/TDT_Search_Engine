With the lessons of Bosnia and Kosovo as a backdrop, NATO begins forging 
a new strategic concept Tuesday, moving beyond the traditional tasks 
of collective defense to focus on weapons of mass destruction, terrorism 
and regional conflicts. NATO foreign minsters will meet to update 
the strategic concept, which lays out the alliance's mission, to reflect 
what NATO already has been doing in practice since the fall of the 
Berlin wall a decade ago. The concept was last revised in 1991. ``NATO's 
primary mission will always remain defense against aggression,'' Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright wrote Monday in Britain's Financial Times. 
``But the founders of the alliance also distinguished between what 
the treaty commits us to do and what it permits us to do.'' Today's 
threat is not a Russian tank assault across the plains of central 
Europe, but regional and ethnic violence like in Bosnia and Kosovo, 
terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. When these 
threats originate from outside NATO's traditional territory of operations, 
the alliance must be prepared to deal with them. ``The challenge is 
to bring the strategy into line with the changing reality,'' said 
a senior NATO diplomat briefing reporters before the foreign ministers' 
meeting here Tuesday and Wednesday. The ministers will draw up the 
concept for approval at the NATO summit on April 24-25. That summit, 
marking the alliance's 50th anniversary, will also welcome three new 
members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Albright will table 
a proposal at the ministerial meeting here to set up a Center for 
Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially an intelligence-sharing center, 
officials said. Germany, meanwhile, is expected to bring up the nuclear 
first-strike question. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made 
waves when he called on NATO last month to consider dropping its doctrine 
allowing a nuclear first-strike. This doctrine, reaffirmed as recently 
as last year, has always been a part of NATO's nuclear strategy and 
is considered an important aspect of deterrence. ``The minister will 
certainly raise the issue,'' a German diplomatic source said. ``We 
have to see that in the context of arms control, arms reduction and 
nonproliferation.'' The Germans don't have much backing on the issue 
and no one at NATO sees it as more than a speed bump on the road to 
the new strategic concept. The allies will assess the situation in 
Kosovo, the south Serbian province where Serb security forces and 
ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven months. The threat of 
NATO air strikes stopped the fighting in October and the cease-fire 
is generally holding, despite sporadic outbursts. The ministers also 
will make a regular six-month review of the situation in Bosnia. While 
there may be some cosmetic changes in the 32,000-member NATO-led force 
in Bosnia, no major reduction in the troop level is seen any time 
soon. ``Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples that demonstrate NATO 
must act when conflicts beyond its immediate borders affect alliance 
interests,'' Albright wrote in her Financial Times article. ``NATO 
must find the right balance between the centrality of NATO's collective 
defense missions and responding to such crises.''
