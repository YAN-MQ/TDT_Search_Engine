In religion, there are prophets. And there are profits. Now seven 
monasteries in Austria have decided there is strength and profit in 
numbers. The result, a merger of monks with one eye on heaven and 
the other on the bottom line, called cloisterite, a pun blending the 
German words for cloister and Austria. Cloisterite's manager, Gabrielle 
Lucash, says that the marketing plan involves combining earthly goods 
with heavenly good. The monasteries are selling different products, 
especially wine and beer and cheese. They offer eating and drinking, 
they offer hospitality, and certainly a Christian message. What makes 
the cloisterite idea new is not the products, of course. Beer, wine 
and cheese, but the production, says Gabrielle Lucash. It is new because 
all the monasteries will come together to an association. And they 
will work together to concentrate power, to concentrate their efforts, 
to be better on the market and in this association, it is easier to 
reduce costs for each member and they will be more stronger. And they 
have more benefits because you work together. To which we say, Amen.
