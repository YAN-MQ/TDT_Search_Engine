Cambodian officials have welcomed a UN decision to reseat the Phenom 
Phen government after a 15-month absence from the world body. National 
assembly president Prince Noradem Ranoritz says he warmly welcomes 
the UN move, adding it will help Cambodia regain much needed foreign 
assistance. Cambodia's UN seat had been vacant since last year after 
Prime Minister Hansen staged a bloody coup to oust Prince Ronarit 
who had been serving as co-prime minister. While the two rivals agreed 
last month to form a new coalition government, Cambodian King Sianouk 
last week sent a letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan naming 
a new delegation to the world body.
