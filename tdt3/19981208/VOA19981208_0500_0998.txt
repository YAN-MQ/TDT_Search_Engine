Working 400 kilometers above the earth, two U.S. astronauts have successfully 
hooked up 40 electrical connections between the first two pieces of 
the international space station. Astronauts Jerry Ross and James Newman 
completed their six-hour job two hours ahead of schedule. NASA says 
it will take two more space walks this week to complete the hookup 
between the Russian and the American modules. You're tuned to VOA 
news now, coming to you from Washington.
