If you're thinking about picking up tickets to the all-star game, 
forget it. The league canceled the game for that was to be in Philadelphia 
for first time in 23 years. It was canceled because we don't think 
it's fair to ask our business partners to make the expenty duers that 
will be in vain. We can't guarantee a season and we can't guarantee 
an all-star weekend. This is the first time the league has canceled 
an all-star game, held every year since 1951. The labor dispute is 
in its 161st day. No new negotiations are scheduled.
