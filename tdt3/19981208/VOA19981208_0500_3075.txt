Americans increased their borrowing in October at the fastest pace 
in more than two years. Credit outstanding grew at a 9 percent annual 
rate to $1.3 trillion. The New York Conference Board's chief economist 
Delow Smith says spending still remains moderate. The consumer is 
still being moderate. You don't have it really racing ahead and that's 
the key point because you want this economy to keep sustainable. You 
want it to keep on growing and you have all of a sudden this incredible 
surge in consumer credit. It will slow it down at some time because 
people will just max themselves out. But in this case, it's still 
going at a relatively moderate pace. The borrowing also accounts for 
the second straight month of negative savings.
