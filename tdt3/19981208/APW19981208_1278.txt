Murder, corruption and power struggles have dogged Russian soccer 
lately, almost as badly as ridicule and lament prompted by a string 
of embarrassing defeats for the Russian national team. The country's 
soccer officials resolved to change that Tuesday _ by electing as 
their leader the same person who has held the post for nearly 20 years. 
At a conference of the Russian Soccer Union in Moscow, Vyacheslav 
Koloskov received the votes of more than half of the nearly 100 leaders 
of local soccer clubs. Koloskov has promised to revive Russian soccer, 
offering to expand the powers of local clubs, giving them more control 
over their own budgets. Soccer in Russia, once flaunted by the Soviets 
as a realm of pure athletic intentions and clean competition, has 
been making headlines in newspaper's crime sections in the past few 
years. Larisa Nechayeva, director general of the Spartak soccer club, 
widely considered the country's most popular team, was fatally shot 
last year at her home in an apparent contract hit. Koloskov has recently 
hired bodyguards, saying he has received threats pressuring him to 
step down before it's ``too late.'' The soccer union leaders feud 
bitterly and accuse each other of corruption. Meanwhile, the Russian 
team has not qualified for the World Cup since 1990 or any major tournament 
since the 1992 European Championship, and it suffered an embarrassing 
and demoralizing loss to Iceland this fall in a qualifier for the 
2000 European Championship. ``The situation that has developed in 
our soccer has the nature of a real crisis,'' said Anatoly Byshovets, 
who coached the Soviet soccer team to a gold medal in the 1988 Olympics, 
and who was recently appointed head coach of the Russian Soccer Union. 
The daily Vremya speculated Tuesday that the soccer chiefs backed 
Koloskov's re-election because of his promises to devolve power to 
local clubs. ``The liberties that Koloskov intends to give to the 
regions turn the seat of a functionary from a local federation into 
a very lucrative place,'' Vremya wrote. ``Keeping this kind of concrete 
profit in mind, it is easy to part with abstract thoughts about the 
desirability of reshuffles in the nation's top soccer leadership.'' 
Koloskov easily defeated his chief opponent, president of the Dinamo 
Moscow club, Nikolai Tolstykh. Some were skeptical about whether anything 
can raise Russia's soccer from its sad state. ``This is a power struggle 
going on. Nothing more nor less,'' said Vladimir Alyoshin, general 
director of Moscow's Luzhniki sports stadium.
