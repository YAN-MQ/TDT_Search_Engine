They're coming from all over the world to take advantage of what many 
people say is the best higher education system in the world. This 
is the issue of students from all over the world, coming to the United 
States to get their college degrees and masters degrees and Ph.Ds. 
A new government study says the number of foreign students in the 
United States this year increased 5 percent. Students from Asia made 
up more than half the total. 481,000 foreign students were studying 
in American colleges and universities in 1998. Almost 278,000 of them 
were Asians. Japan was the leading place of origin for foreign students 
in the United States. After that, China, South Korea and India were 
the top nations.
