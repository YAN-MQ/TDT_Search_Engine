And I'm Tony Riggs. Along with Victor Murales. This is VOA News Now. 
Racism, discrimination, and hate crimes know no borders. In this post-Cold 
War world, new enemies are perceived in immigrant communities. And 
among groups perceived as "different." The Council of Europe and other 
institutions are concerned about the rise of Neo-fascism in Europe. 
Immigrants of color, Muslims, and gypsies are increasingly the targets 
of hate crimes. Racism: A Global Curse, is second in Dateline's two-part 
series on this topic. Here's Pamela Taylor. At the end of the week, 
Britain hosts and Anglo-U.S. conference on race hate crimes. The Society 
of Black Lawyers in England and Wales invited U.S. legal and civil 
liberties experts to share their experiences dealing with racism in 
the United States. The British society was formed in 1973. In response 
to a steady rise in racist attacks against immigrants from Pakistan, 
India, and the former colonies of the British West Indies. The chairman 
of the Society, Peter Herbert, says Britain is beginning to have many 
of the problems seen in the United States. From segregated communities 
to racial violence and even racism in the police force. Mr. Herbert 
spoke with VOA's Christine Fernell in our London Bureau. There are 
areas of the United Kingdom, such as Southeast London. Where there 
were four racial murders in the space of two years. Between 1992 and 
1994. Which has quite an appalling history of right-wing fascist activity. 
Which we think was a breeding ground to the type of race hate attacks 
that led to these murders. Do you think racially motivated crimes 
are increasing or diminishing as a problem in Britain? I think they're 
certainly increasing in the terms of the numbers being reported. The 
numbers being reported over the last six years has trebled. To at 
least to well over thirteen and a half thousand. With the estimated 
total being between, by the home office, has been between 130 to 150 
thousand per year. Plus the rise in racism and fascism in Central 
Europe has had its effects on asylum seekers and people targeted for 
the ills of all society. And that has obviously impacted upon the 
minority communities in the U.K. Peter Herbert, Chairman of the Society 
of Black Lawyers of England and Wales. Speaking with VOA's Christine 
Fernell, in London.
