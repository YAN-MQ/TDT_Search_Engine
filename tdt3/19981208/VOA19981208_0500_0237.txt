U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno says she will not seek an independent 
probe of alleged fundraising abuses by President Clinton during the 
1996 election campaign. Ms. Reno announced her decision Monday, saying 
evidence does not warrant the appointment of a special prosecutor 
to conduct further investigation. A White House spokeswoman said the 
president is gratified by Ms. Reno's decision. Mr. Clinton was accused 
of breaking the rules on use of political advertisements.
