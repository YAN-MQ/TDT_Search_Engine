Drinking alcoholic beverages and driving is not really a good idea 
anywhere in the world. But in one suburb of Detroit, Michigan, in 
one courtroom, drunk drivers are finding out just how difficult it 
can be if you get caught. Drunk drivers sentenced to probation will 
carry a sobering message to other drivers there. The district judge, 
Michael Martone is ordering drunk driving offenders to attach bumper 
stickers to their cars that read: drunk driving. You can't afford 
it. The judge says every time you get into your car, you see this 
bumper sticker, you're going to think, I better not do it again. Well, 
Judge Martone says the bumper stickers also spread the don't drink 
and drive message to others. He had two different batches of the stickers 
printed. One includes tiny text saying that the bumper sticker is 
in place because of a court order. Another one consists only of the 
drunk driving, you can't afford it message. That batch is for people 
who've not been convicted of drunk driving, but who just want to spread 
the safety message anyway.
