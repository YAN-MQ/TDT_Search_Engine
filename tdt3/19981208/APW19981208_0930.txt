They're back. Freddy Shepherd and Douglas Hall were reappointed to 
Newcastle's controlling board Tuesday _ seven months after resigning 
in disgrace for insulting the club's fans, the city's women and star 
striker Alan Shearer. Shepherd and Hall won back their places on the 
Newcastle plc board at the end of the company's stormy annual general 
meeting. The company chairman, Denis Cassidy, and non-executive directors 
Tom Fenton and John Josephs resigned in protest at the return of Shepherd 
and Hall. Newcastle's stockbrokers, BT Alex Brown, also quit. The 
company said chief executive Freddie Fletcher will take over as acting 
chairman until the position is filled permanently, and another independent 
director will also be appointed. Hall and Shepherd left both the soccer 
board and company board last season after being caught on film mocking 
Newcastle fans for paying high prices for club merchandise, describing 
Newcastle women as ``dogs'' and calling Shearer ``Mary Poppins.'' 
The pair returned to their positions as chairman and deputy chairman 
of the soccer board in July. But their return to the main company 
board was not foreseen. But with a shareholding in excess of 60 percent 
between their companies, Shepherd and Hall were able to force their 
way back onto the board. ``The 65 percent shareholders said they wanted 
to come back to the main Plc Board,'' Fletcher said. ``There was a 
view that you are better inviting them back and working with them 
to develop a long-term strategy and there was another view that they 
shouldn't come back.'' Fletcher said the return of the pair would 
result in no change on the soccer front. ``The football club hasn't 
changed, all that's altered is the Plc board,'' he said. ``The football 
club will still be given the greatest priority, which means being 
successful on the park.'' Newcastle shares on the London stock market 
fell by more than 3 percent at the news of the two directors' return. 
Fletcher dismissed speculation that the club would have to be taken 
off the stock market and into the private hands of Hall and Shepherd. 
He also denied reports of possible takeover bids from U.S. media giant 
Time Warner and Japanese electronics firm Sony. ``We are not in any 
talks about a takeover,'' Fletcher said. ``If you enter any talks, 
then you have to inform the Stock Exchange. We have not been involved 
in any talks, and if we were, it wouldn't be a secret.'' The move 
to welcome back Shepherd and Hall was met with caution by members 
of the Independent Newcastle United Supporters' Association. ``I don't 
think anything that's happened today will impress anybody,'' chairman 
Kevin Miles said. ``I think most fans are more concerned about (Duncan) 
Ferguson and Shearer than Hall and Shepherd.''
