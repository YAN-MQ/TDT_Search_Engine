The number of Americans opposed to any congressional action to impeach 
President Clinton is increasing slightly. That's based on a new CNN/"USA 
today" Gallup poll in which nearly 1,100 americans were questioned. 
When asked whether their congressional representative should not vote 
for impeachment, 66% agreed they shouldn't. That's a 2% increase from 
last month and a 4% increase from October. The survey also finds 66% 
approve of the way the president is handling his job. 30% disapprove.
