Attorney general Janet Reno has decided against seeking another independent 
counsel investigation of President Clinton. It would have focused 
on so-called "issue ads" from the 1996 election which were paid for 
by the democratic party, not the president's re-election campaign. 
Auditors for the federal election commission have concluded both the 
president and republican candidate Bob Dole exceeded campaign spending 
limits by using such ads. Top justice department officials recommended 
against seeking an independent counsel.
