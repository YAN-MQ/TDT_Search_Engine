That wraps up this edition of "Dollars & Sense." For all the latest 
money news, click on to CNN.com. The NBA lockout claims another casualty. 
Details next in "CNN Headline Sports." Let me tell you about the BEST 
traffic report in town... brought to you by qxrt's barb and Bill it's 
a scorcher out there, and I hope none of you are trying to get anywhere 
soon. From up here, it looks like a little backup heading downtown... 
these guys have the ultimate view. ...this is barb and Bill, the qxrt 
traffic team, signing out. Once again, our explorer saves the day. 
Yeah, glad we're not down in that mess. And just think of the money 
they saved on a helicopter. The new Ford explorer.
