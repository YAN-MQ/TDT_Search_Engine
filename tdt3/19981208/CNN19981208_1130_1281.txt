Tampa bay holds onto playoff hopes, while green bay couldn't hold 
onto the ball. Eight fumbles committed by the pack in Monday night's 
24-22 loss to the bucs. Trent Dilfer tossed two TDs and ran for another. 
So Tampa's tied for the final NFC playoff spot, while green bay failed 
to nail down a postseason berth. To add injury to insult, starting 
center Frank winters left the game with a Broken leg. Our back has 
been against the wall before, but this is as bad as it's been. But 
the good thing is that guys who are playing are excited about it. 
They're getting a chance to play, and I'm still having fun.
