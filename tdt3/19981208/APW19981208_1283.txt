Ukrainian customs officials intercepted a container with an unidentified 
radioactive material that a man from neighboring Moldova tried to 
take out of Ukraine, a newspaper said Tuesday. The container was seized 
at the Ukrainian-Moldovan border during a search of the Moldovan man's 
car, whose passengers included three women and a child, the daily 
Dyen said. Customs officials searched the car after receiving a warning 
from Ukraine's Security Service. The sealed, 42-kilogram (92-pound) 
container was emitting radiation at a level 12 times the maximum allowed 
by Ukrainian health authorities, the newspaper said. No further details 
were released. Meanwhile, in a village in southern Ukraine, Malomykhailyvka, 
police recently discovered a 100-kilogram (220-pound) lead box with 
a metal-working device containing radioactive cesium, which had been 
kept in storage by a 74-year-old villager. The man said the box was 
brought to him four years ago by his grandson and that he had no idea 
about its dangerous contents, regional civil defense chief Oleksandr 
Sydoruk told Dyen. Many containers of radioactive isotopes have disappeared 
from metallurgy plants, hospitals and other facilities in the former 
Soviet Union in recent years. Police say they attract thieves who 
mistakenly think the material can be sold as nuclear technology.
