Concerned that some auditors may no longer be independent from clients, 
securities regulators are questioning whether accountants can police 
themselves and have asked the nation's five largest accounting firms 
to strengthen internal controls. Independence from the companies they 
audit is considered crucial for auditors, whose job is to protect 
investors by making sure that the financial statements prepared by 
a company's management are correct. In a letter sent last week to 
the Big Five accounting firms, Lynn Turner, the chief accountant at 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, asked the firms to look at 
whether their internal controls and training programs were adequate. 
``We are seeing instances where people in these large firms are not 
complying with the independence standards,'' Turner said Tuesday. 
``We've got a real issue here.'' He said that SEC Chairman Arthur 
Levitt had asked the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, 
the largest organization of accountants, to strengthen and accelerate 
the process for disciplining members who violate the profession's 
rules. In the last year, securities regulators have become increasingly 
concerned about auditing quality because of the growing number of 
accounting frauds at public companies audited by the big firms. At 
a conference attended by hundreds of accountants in Washington Tuesday, 
Richard Walker, the SEC's director of enforcement, said accounting 
fraud had become his staff's top priority. Barry Melancon, the institute's 
president, said the number of accounting fraud cases was minimal compared 
with the thousands of audits done every year. ``We don't condone fraud 
or inappropriate behavior,'' he said. ``But no one has zero defects.'' 
The commission's top regulators also said they were concerned that 
the accounting firms had reduced the amount of testing they do during 
their audits and could be missing some errors. ``It's quite clear 
that there has been such a substantial reduction in auditing work 
that things are getting by that should not,'' said Walter Schuetze, 
chief accountant in the SEC's enforcement division. ``Sometimes it's 
impossible to believe that an audit was really done.''
