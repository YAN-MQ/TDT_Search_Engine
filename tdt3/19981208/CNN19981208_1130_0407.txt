The Supreme Court has ruled today that police do not have blanket 
authority to search any car stopped for traffic infractions. The case 
involved an Iowa man stopped for speeding. Police searched the man's 
car without probable cause or his consent. They discovered a pipe 
and marijuana. Today, the court unanimously ruled the search was unlawful 
under the fourth amendment, which guarantees protection against illegal 
searches and seizures.
