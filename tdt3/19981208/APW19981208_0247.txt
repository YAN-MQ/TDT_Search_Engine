BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO foreign ministers deplored the continued 
violence in Kosovo and said in a statement Tuesday that both Serbs 
and ethnic Albanians in the province were to blame. ``The security 
situation in Kosovo remains of great concern to us,'' the ministers 
said. ``Since the beginning of November, violent incidents provoked 
in some cases by Serbian security forces and in others by armed Kosovar 
elements have increased tension. These incidents show that both the 
Belgrade authorities and the armed Kosovar elements have failed to 
comply fully with the requirements set on in U.N. Security Council 
resolutions.'' Hundreds of people, mostly civilians, died and hundreds 
of thousands were driven from their homes in seven months of fighting 
between the Serb police and armed forces and the rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army. Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left of the Yugoslav 
federation, withdrew Kosovo's autonomy in 1989. The ethnic Albanian 
majority is now demanding independence, something the Belgrade authorities 
have rejected. The fighting was halted and a shaky cease-fire installed 
only after NATO threatened to conduct air strikes. ``We insist that 
both sides maintain scrupulously the cease-fire and comply fully with 
the U.N. Security Council resolutions,'' the ministers said in their 
declaration. ``We also expect them to facilitate the war crimes investigations 
by the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. In this connection, 
we deplore the denial of visas to ICTY investigators.''
