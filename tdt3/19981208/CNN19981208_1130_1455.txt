Folksy pop singer jewel is expanding her Horizons. She's dabbling 
in acting, writing poetry, and devoting time to charity, all that, 
and a new album too. Mark Scheerer reports. I get down on my knees 
and I will pray Positive change, making a difference, human compassion 
-- some of the themes running through "hands," jewel's new single, 
and her album, "Spirit," and her life. One person does make a difference. 
That's not a hard concept. I mean, people's lives are changed by a 
common kindness, as well as my one life has affected millions. Millions 
have been moved by 24-year-old jewel kilcher, at least moved enough 
to buy over 8 million copies of her first album. Proceeds from her 
book of poetry published earlier this year and money from her virtually 
nonstop touring are now going toward her new charitable organization 
called higher ground for humanity. It wasn't long ago, after all, 
that she was living hand to mouth. One of my goals when I was living 
in my car -- I think one of my main goals, was that I was excruciatingly 
aware at a young age that people went without things that they shouldn't 
have to go without, that I was denied medical aid, that I was dependent 
on people every night for food and that I wasn't unique at all. And 
I was better off than a lot of people. And it influenced a lot of 
those first songs I wrote, like "who will save your soul?" Who will 
save your soul Jewel is managed by her mother, nedra Carroll, who 
joined her on wNBC's Christmas tree lighting ceremony. I wonder as 
I wander Mother and daughter have just been sued for $10 million by 
jewel's former manager, claiming breach of contract. You know, I haven't 
actually seen this yet. And so, I've had a few people talk to me about 
it, but I can't really comment on it. Jewel has put these hands and 
feet and face to work on the set of "Ride with the Devil," the next 
film by the director of "the ice storm," ang Lee. I've always wanted 
to get into acting, and I finally got done with touring and was able 
to do it. And thank my lucky stars that ang and a really brilliant 
script happened to come along. Performing at an AIDS residence is 
another way jewel puts her spirituality to work in the service of 
compassion. To me, being spiritual isn't hard. You don't have to do 
anything. You don't have to meditate. You don't have to lick your 
finger and hold it in the air and hope to be struck by spirituality, 
like lightning. In the end only kindness matters Mark Scheerer, "CNN 
Entertainment News," New York.
