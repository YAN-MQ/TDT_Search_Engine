NATIONAL FORECAST Gusty winds from the north and northeast will buffet 
southern California Wednesday as a strong high pressure system intensifies 
over the Great Basin of the interior West. Local gusts could exceed 
70 miles an hour in some of the canyons and passes east of Los Angeles 
and San Diego. The windy conditions will persist into Thursday. As 
the air descends toward the Pacific Ocean, it will warm, boosting 
temperatures to near 70 degrees at the coast Wednesday afternoon. 
Meanwhile, despite mainly sunny skies, unusually chilly air will cover 
interior sections of the Southwest with record chill possible over 
Nevada and Utah Wednesday night. Areas of snow will whiten the ground 
of eastern Colorado and New Mexico Wednesday as breezes from the east 
carry moist air toward the Front Range of the Rockies. An approaching 
jet stream disturbance may cause the snow to turn heavy for a time 
later Wednesday afternoon and evening. Elsewhere in the West, a few 
light rain and mountain snow showers will precede the return to milder 
conditions in the Northwest. Generally dry weather will cover an expansive 
area from the Plains to the East Coast Wednesday. A few showers, however, 
could affect the eastern Carolinas as a cold front presses off the 
Atlantic coast. Although the record setting heat in Northeast is over, 
abundant sunshine will still keep daytime readings several degrees 
above seasonal levels Wednesday. Meanwhile, warm and humid air will 
be confined to the southern half of the Florida peninsula Wednesday 
with temperatures well into the 80s amid ample sunshine. Focus: Flood 
Without Rain As the sun broke through the low overcast over western 
Washington Tuesday, a flood watch was issued for the coast. Warnings 
were based on offshore buoys detecting large ocean swells up to 28 
feet high. With large waves crashing Washington shores, dry beaches 
might suddenly be awash with water. Giant logs tossed like tiny sticks 
by breaking waves also posed a danger. Farther south, heavy surf advisories 
were posted for Oregon shores as offshore buoys detected swells as 
high as 31 feet. Large swells were generated a few days ago by a large 
storm over the Gulf of Alaska.
