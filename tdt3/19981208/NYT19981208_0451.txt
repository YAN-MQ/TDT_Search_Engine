Michael Zaslow, an actor who played a victim of Lou Gehrig's disease 
on the soap opera ``One Life to Live'' and who struggled with the 
illness in real life, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He 
was 54. The cause was a heart attack, said Brynn Thayer, who played 
his wife on the show in the 1980s. Zaslow won a daytime Emmy Award 
as best actor in 1994 for his role as the villainous Roger Thorpe 
on CBS' ``Guiding Light,'' a role he played at various times for 25 
years. He was dismissed from the show in April 1997, some eight months 
after the early symptoms of his illness caused his speech to slur. 
In May, Zaslow appeared on ABC's ``One Life to Live,'' reprising his 
role as the pianist David Renaldi, which he had played from 1983 to 
1986. When Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
was diagnosed in late 1997, he incorporated the degenerative nervous-system 
disorder into the life of his character to raise awareness about it. 
With his wife, Susan Hufford, Ms. Thayer and other friends, he founded 
Zaz-angels, an organization under the umbrella of the Greater New 
York Chapter of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association, which 
works for a cure. Zaslow's last appearance on ``One Life to Live,'' 
a Thanksgiving segment, was broadcast on Dec. 1. Zaslow also appeared 
in the 1977 movie ``You Light Up My Life'' and the television series 
``Law and Order.'' He appeared in the Broadway productions of ``Cat 
on a Hot Tin Roof,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof'' and ``Boccaccio,'' as 
well as in off-Broadway and regional productions. In addition to his 
wife, he is survived by two daughters, Marika Hufford-Zaslow and Helena 
Hufford-Zaslow, both of Manhattan.
