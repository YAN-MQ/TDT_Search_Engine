The U.S. government senior diplomat for the middle east is in Egypt 
for a series of meetings with senior Egyptian officials on regional 
and bilateral issues. Correspondent Scott Bopp reports from Cairo 
that high on the list of concerns is the lack of progress by the Israeli 
government and the Palestinian authority in implementing the land 
for security agreements, known as the Wye accord. The U.S. assistant 
secretary of state for the near east, Martin Indick says it is inevitable 
that implementation of the Wye accord would experience problems. Mr. 
Indick told reporters Monday in Cairo that after a prolonged period 
in which there was no progress in the peace process, a lack of trust 
built up which she said will take time to dispel. He said, however, 
that the upcoming visit to the region by President Bill Clinton is 
aimed at underscoring that the U.S. government is committed to seeing 
that both sides uphold their commitments in the Wye agreement. Ambassador 
Dennis Ross is arriving in Israel today and he will be discussing 
with both sides some of the problems that have arisen and we are hopeful, 
indeed we expect that by the time President Clinton comes to the region, 
some of these problems will be resolved and his visit will help to 
resolve the rest of them. The U.S. secretary spoke to reporters after 
a day of meetings with Egyptian officials as part of a strategic dialogue 
between the two governments launched six months ago. The Egyptian 
foreign ministry's chief of cabinet, Acmed Abdul Kait explained the 
meetings covered a broad range of issues. Today's activities were 
relate to meetings within the two teams, the team headed by Secretary 
Indick and the Egyptian team headed by me. We had two sessions extending 
for the duration of the day. We covered a number of regional as well 
as African issues. The bilateral talks are due to last for another 
two days and are to include topics that extend beyond the region, 
in particular ways to strengthen international cooperation in the 
fight against terrorism. Scott Bopp, VOA news, Cairo.
