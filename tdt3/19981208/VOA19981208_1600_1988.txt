VOA's Ron Penstein reports that the foreign ministers are also making 
preparations for next April's summit meeting here in Washington. At 
lunch following their morning meeting. German Foreign Minister Yoska 
Fischer is proposing that NATO pledge to make no first use of nuclear 
weapons in the Alliance's new mission statement for the Washington 
summit. The German position has been criticized by NATO's nuclear 
powers. The United States, Britain, and France. British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cooke says Britain has already made nuclear reductions. And 
will not agree to change nuclear policy. We affirmed in this defensive 
view our commitment to the present nuclear posture of NATO. And we 
see no need for a change in that posture. The NATO ministers are also 
discussing how to keep NATO's door open to new members. Even though 
the Alliance is not likely to invite any more countries to join. When 
their leaders meet in Washington next April. Ron Penstein, VOA News, 
NATO.
