One day after the National Football League called for a vote by its 
owners on whether to use instant replay during the playoffs, it became 
clear that the short time frame involved could hinder its passage. 
``We're not going to cure anything by going into it half-cocked,'' 
Wellington Mara, the Giants' co-owner, said in a statement. An opponent 
of replay in the past, he added, ``We're absolutely opposed to rushing 
into replay.'' But even an advocate of replay like Dennis Green, the 
Minnesota Vikings' coach, said he wondered if the league wasn't moving 
too quickly, reacting too fast to criticism of calls that might have 
been reversed if replay were in place. ``There are some people who 
are for it but won't vote for it because they don't want to rush something 
in,'' he said. ``I've looked at the lay of the land, and it does not 
look good.'' The NFL knows that its quick and unexpected decision 
to seek a vote on post-season replay may not succeed. The league announced 
its intentions Monday, a day after a head linesman at the Jets-Seahawks 
game incorrectly ruled a touchdown for the Jets' Vinny Testaverde 
on a 5-yard quarterback sneak. ``Having replay in the playoffs remains 
a possibility, not a probability,'' said Joe Browne, the league's 
senior vice president of communications. So far, teams have not received 
the league's proposal, because it is not complete, but a detailed 
plan was expected to be ready for an anticipated vote next week. But 
a vote may not occur if Commissioner Paul Tagliabue cannot change 
enough votes to get the 24 needed for passage. And it is by no means 
clear that those votes would be there, despite a series of high-profile 
officiating errors in recent weeks. ``I'd say anybody who wants to 
change the system in the middle of the season is not thinking in an 
orderly process about how the game should be run,'' said Lamar Hunt, 
the owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, a longtime replay opponent. He 
added, ``To jam something through in so short a time is wrong.'' The 
opposition appears to center on the short time left to implement an 
effective system before the first playoff game on Jan. 2. Some opponents 
said they might reconsider their stance when the league next votes 
on full-season replay. ``We will have a completely open mind when 
the subject comes up at our annual league meetings in March,'' Mara 
said in his statement. The basic outline of the plan being tweaked 
by league officials would let each coach challenge two plays a game. 
If a coach has used up his challenges, the referee can review a disputed 
play in the last two minutes of the game. The league must decide whether 
a coach would be penalized with a timeout if his challenge fails to 
result in a reversal. The referee would view replays from a television 
monitor on the sidelines, watching the same network videotape seen 
by viewers to make the decision. In replay's earlier incarnation from 
1986 to 1991, replay judges sitting in stadium booths reviewed the 
replays before ruling to affirm or reverse the on-field call. The 
league needs three more team votes, from the 21 that failed to pass 
the most recent replay proposal in March. Ralph Wilson, the Buffalo 
Bills' owner, has changed his previous opposition to replay because 
of two key calls that went against his team in a Nov. 29 game against 
New England. Rich McKay, Tampa Bay's general manager, was quoted by 
The Associated Press as saying that the Buccaneers may change to a 
yes vote, but Tony Dungy, the team's coach, told ESPN that he opposed 
the rush to replay. Even a consistent backer of replay like Ron Wolf, 
the general manager of the Green Bay Packers, withheld his complete 
endorsement of a playoff version. ``I don't know what it is,'' he 
said. ``We haven't gotten anything from the league. So until it crosses 
my desk, I don't know what we're talking about.'' The Packers' position 
was clouded when it was reported during the Packers-Buccaneers game 
on ``Monday Night Football'' that Mike Holmgren, the Green Bay coach 
and a replay proponent on the league's competition committee, said 
he did not advocate the rapid imposition of replay for the playoffs 
and Super Bowl. There is no such ambiguity for William Bidwill, owner 
of the Arizona Cardinals. ``We remain a no,'' said Paul Jensen, a 
Cardinals spokesman. `` B. feels the game should be played on the 
field.'' Besides the Giants, Buffalo, Kansas City, Tampa Bay and Arizona, 
the other replay naysayers last March were Chicago, Cincinnati, Oakland 
and San Diego. Bill Johnston, a Chargers spokesman, said that the 
team's president, Dean Spanos, would change votes for playoff replay 
but would not vote for the challenge system for the regular season. 
The technical logistics of reviving replay may be easier than the 
politics. An on-field monitor would be connected to the network transmission 
of the game, as it was during preseason replay experiments last summer 
and in 1996. Playoff replay would create a more extensive array of 
camera angles than during the regular season to assess disputed plays. 
``But you just can't have enough cameras,'' Hunt said, ``to catch 
every key play at every position.''
