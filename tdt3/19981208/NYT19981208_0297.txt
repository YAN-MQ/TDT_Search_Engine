Under chilly, slate-gray skies, Vice President Al Gore buried his 
father Tuesday, paying tribute to former Sen. Albert Gore Sr. as a 
political force who helped transform the Old South into the New South 
and as a father who bred in his son an abiding sense of security and 
confidence. ``Children with strong fathers learn trust early on that 
their needs will be met, that they're wanted, that they have value,'' 
the vice president said in a eulogy at a service at the War Memorial 
here attended by more than 1,000 people, including President Clinton. 
``They can afford to be secure and confident.'' Albert Gore Sr., a 
former Democratic congressman and senator for more than three decades, 
died Saturday at the age of 90 in Carthage. The service here coincided 
with the impeachment inquiry under way in Washington, and Clinton 
sat silently next to his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. And Gore, who 
has all but officially announced his candidacy for president, paid 
tribute to his father for instilling in him values that may serve 
as a subtext for the next presidential campaign as candidates affirm 
their steadfastness in reaction to Clinton's sex scandal. ``Of all 
the lessons he taught me as a father, perhaps the most powerful was 
the way he loved my mother,'' the vice president said. ``When I was 
growing up, it never once occurred to me that the foundation upon 
which my security depended would ever shake.'' In the audience sat 
several of the vice president's former and possibly future rivals 
_ Democrats including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rep. Dick Gephardt 
of Missouri, and Republicans including Sen. Fred Thompson and former 
Gov. Lamar Alexander, both of Tennessee. Gore is about to embark on 
the final leg of a political journey for which his father set the 
course decades ago. The elder Gore was, inescapably, his son's earliest 
political mentor, taking him as a toddler to the Senate, where Vice 
President Richard Nixon called the boy to the rostrum, bounced him 
on his knee and let him play with the gavel. The elder Gore also forthrightly 
stood up for what he believed, a trait noted by many of the politicians 
of both parties who mingled before the service. Thompson said: ``He 
was a person who was willing to walk into the teeth of enemy fire. 
It's a good example, not just for his son but for all of us in public 
office.'' Benjamin Hooks, the former president of the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored People, lauded this trait from the 
podium. ``He was not a politician driven by polls, but one who was 
driven by principle,'' Hooks said, noting Gore's refusal to sign the 
Southern Manifesto, which condemned the U.S. Supreme Court's school 
desegregation order, and his fierce opposition to the Vietnam War. 
``He was not one who said what he thought his audience wanted to hear, 
but he told them what he needed to know.'' Al Gore learned crucial 
political lessons by watching his father in victory as well as in 
defeat, and shaped his own career accordingly. One brutal experience 
was watching his father lose his final, bruising Senate campaign in 
1970. The elder Gore's unabashed liberalism _ against the war, against 
school prayer, in favor of civil rights, busing and gun control _ 
had put him at odds with many in Tennessee, and he was perceived as 
having lost touch with his constituents. Once the son entered politics, 
he relentlessly cultivated his roots as a home-grown Tennessean despite 
his upbringing in Washington. As for issues, the vice president is 
not associated with emotionally charged or ideologically polarizing 
topics, steeping himself instead in high technology and reinventing 
government. He has called himself ``a raging moderate.'' Gore's mother, 
Pauline, said in a 1988 interview that he had probably learned lessons 
her husband had not. ``Al by nature is more of a pragmatist than his 
father,'' she said. ``If there's no chance of victory, there's no 
sense in bloodying yourself.'' The vice president lauded his father 
Tuesday for fighting those battles. ``He helped to establish the terms 
of a new politics for Tennessee and the entire South, a progressive 
politics that rejected race-baiting and connected our region to the 
rest of America,'' he said. ``My father was brave. I mean, really 
brave. He opposed the poll tax in the '40s and supported civil rights 
in the '50s. By the time he was in his final Senate term, I was old 
enough to understand clearly the implications of the choices he made 
when he repeatedly rejected the advice of many fearful political allies 
who had urged him to trim his sails.'' Gore said some people hated 
his father because of his principles, but the vice president suggested 
that this was a fair price to pay for authenticity. ``It is better 
to be hated for what you are,'' he said, ``than to be loved for what 
you are not.''
