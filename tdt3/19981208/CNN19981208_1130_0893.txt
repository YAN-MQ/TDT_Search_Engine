Checking this hour's top stories -- President Clinton's defenders 
have the floor this morning before the house Judiciary committee, 
as the White House tries to change some minds on impeachment. The 
president's attorney testified his client's behavior was morally wrong 
but not illegal. Whatever there is in the record, that shows that 
what the president did was wrong, and blameworthy, there is nothing 
in the record in either the law or the facts that would justify his 
impeachment and removal from office.
