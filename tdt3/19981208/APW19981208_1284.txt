A military court in Ukraine has dismissed an appeal from a soldier 
sentenced to a prison term and a large fine for beating to death a 
fellow serviceman, a newspaper reported Tuesday. Valeriy Nykonenko 
was found guilty of killing a new recruit, Oleksandr Troianovsky, 
during a hazing session in June 1996, when Mykonenko and other drunken 
soldiers attacked 18 younger comrades. The practice of hazing of young 
recruits by elder soldiers is widespread in the armies of the former 
Soviet republics. Mykonenko was sentenced to eight years in prison 
and a fine of 10,000 hryvna (dlrs 2,920 at the current rate) to compensate 
the killed soldier's relatives, Kievskiye Vedomosti reported. But 
he refused to pay the fine and appealed to a military court, which 
has dismissed the appeal. Mykonenko is considering an appeal to the 
Supreme Court, the newspaper said.
