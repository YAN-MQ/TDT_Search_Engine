When the freshman college football player was caught robbing a gas 
station near campus, his mother was irate with the coach. ``I send 
my boy to you,'' she told the coach by telephone, ``and in three months' 
time look what happens to him.'' The coach listened. ``I had him for 
three months,'' he replied. ``You had him for 17 years.'' Mack Brown, 
the football coach of the University of Texas, recalled this incident, 
which happened in 1975 when he was a 23-year-old assistant coach at 
Southern Mississippi. The head coach there, who spoke with the mother, 
was Bobby Collins. He was talking about the perils of being responsible 
for 125 young men _ especially in light of the indictments last week 
of four Northwestern University football players on perjury charges 
related to point-shaving in games in 1994 _ and what he learned from 
that experience which he observed. ``I learned that you had to do 
all you can to prevent such an occurrence, and even then it's not 
always in your control,'' he said. ``It's like being a parent. I have 
four kids myself. You talk, you counsel, you try to get a network 
to know what's going on, where they are, who they're with and then 
you hope they listen, and you hope for the best. Sometimes the best 
doesn't work out.'' Mack Brown and Phillip Fulmer, head coach of Tennessee, 
the No. 1 ranked team in the nation, were in town to attend Tuesday 
night's College Football Hall of Fame dinner, but Tuesday morning 
they were together in a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to help 
promote a book they both believe is important. The ``Coach's Communication 
Playbook,'' by Kathleen Hessert, deals with problems that arise for 
coaches. When the Northwestern scandal broke, the impact on both coaches 
_ as it was, surely, in the entire coaching community _ was immediate 
and profound. ``It scares you to death,'' Fulmer said. ``I came in 
the morning after the news of the Northwestern situation with the 
newspaper headlines,'' Fulmer said. ``I pinned them on the board, 
and discussed it with my players. I have no doubt coaches all over 
the country were doing the same thing.'' Fulmer said that before every 
season he talks to his players about gambling _ how it can ruin their 
lives. The FBI comes in to talk to the players. This happens on most 
campuses around the country. It took place at Northwestern, which 
also recently endured a basketball point-shaving scandal. ``I know 
Gary Barnett,'' Fulmer said, referring to the Northwestern coach. 
``I know he is bright, and he is able. But as hard as you might try, 
the coach can't know everything. You try to establish a network, a 
support system, so that information will be filtered to you. ``You 
try to know the kind of person you recruited, and be aware of patterns 
that might develop. I had one player show up in the parking lot with 
a brand-new Mustang. I took him aside and questioned him about it. 
He took offense. Turned out that his uncle had bought it for him. 
He had the title to the car. The player was just waiting for me to 
ask him about it.'' One of the former Northwestern players indicted 
_ the star running back Dennis Lundy _ was accused of fumbling in 
a crucial situation in trying to win a bet. When Barnett learned that 
Lundy was gambling on college sports _ Lundy protested that it wasn't 
on Northwestern football _ the senior was suspended for the last game 
of the season and was prevented from having a chance to break the 
school rushing record. Barnett told the news media that Lundy had 
broken a team rule. He didn't specify. Should he have? ``Families 
have lawyers,'' Brown said, ``and the best thing you can do in such 
situations is immediately refer the problem to the authorities, the 
athletic director, the president of the school, the legal authorities.'' 
That is what Gary Barnett did. ``But you see how difficult the problem 
is when it took four years for the investigation to end and to have 
federal authorities issue an indictment,'' Brown said. It is true, 
as Rick Taylor, Northwestern's athletic director said that, ``Gambling 
is so pervasive in our society that we're kidding ourselves if we 
feel we can control it totally.'' But who must take responsibility 
in such an alleged scandal? The player, certainly _ even if only a 
teen-ager _ because he knows right from wrong, or ought to. But also 
the university and the coaching staff. Northwestern, for one, may 
have had enough coaches, but not enough ears. Northwestern contends 
it did not know the gun was loaded. Nonetheless, in such cases, it 
must stand guilty at least of sublime ignorance.
