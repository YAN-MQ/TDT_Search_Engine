Researchers say bartenders in California are breathing a little easier 
since a law went into effect last January that prohibits smoking in 
bars. A study of 53 bartenders in San Francisco indicates the reduction 
in their exposure to secondhand smoke has led to improved lung function 
and overall respiratory health. The study is published in "the journal 
of the American medical association."
