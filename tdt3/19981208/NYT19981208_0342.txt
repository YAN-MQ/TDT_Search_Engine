AT&AMP;T Corp. said Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire the global 
data network of IBM Corp. for $5 billion in cash. The two companies 
also said they had agreed to provide each other $9 billion in outsourcing 
business. More than 7,000 people, many of them in the Northeast, would 
change employers under the agreement, with 5,000 people transferring 
from IBM to AT&AMP;T and at least 2,000 going from AT&AMP;T to IBM. 
Most of those workers would, however, stay in substantially the same 
jobs and would probably not have to move. For AT&AMP;T, Tuesday's 
agreement seemed to be the fourth corner piece of the puzzle that 
Michael Armstrong has been trying to put together to make sense of 
the company's future since he took over as chairman last fall. Shortly 
after he arrived at AT&AMP;T, the No. 1 long-distance company, Armstrong 
said the company needed to strengthen its strategies for breaking 
into the local communications market, for expanding its international 
presence and for beefing up its advanced data services, especially 
those based on Internet technologies. Already this year, AT&AMP;T 
has agreed to acquire Teleport Communications Group Inc., a local 
phone company for businesses, and Tele-Communications Inc., which 
as the No. 2 cable television company has links into millions of homes. 
The company also formed a $10 billion joint venture for the international 
market with British Telecommunications, Britain's biggest phone company. 
With the IBM deal, AT&AMP;T is now set to make a serious splash in 
the data market. IBM's Internet service, which is a major part of 
its data network, has more than a million individual users in 59 countries. 
More important, it has local dial-up ports into its network all over 
the world. That is a big plus in attracting the large corporate customers 
that are the grand prize for communications companies. For IBM, the 
No. 1 computer company, Tuesday's agreement ended an auction process 
that publicly began in September, when the company said it had hired 
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. to vet bids for its network. As the pace of 
technological change continued to accelerate in both the communications 
and the computer industries, IBM decided that it no longer made sense 
to run a communications system of its own. ``With this agreement, 
the network will receive the management focus and resources necessary 
to maintain its standing as a world-class provider of connectivity 
to IBM and millions of customers,'' Louis Gerstner, IBM's chairman, 
said in a statement. The 5,000 employees of the IBM network business 
that will switch to AT&AMP;T are equally distributed, according to 
an IBM spokesman, among Somers, N.Y.; Schaumburg, Ill., and Tampa, 
Fla. According to AT&AMP;T, the IBM network will generate about $1.2 
billion in revenue from IBM's existing customers in the first year 
after the deal is completed. The companies expect to finish the deal 
around the middle of next year. Because the IBM system also handles 
a large amount of IBM's internal corporate communications, IBM also 
awarded AT&AMP;T an outsourcing contract for its communications, worth 
$5 billion over five years. Altogether, AT&AMP;T, which was advised 
in the transaction by Salomon Smith Barney, said it expected a revenue 
increase of $2.5 billion in the first 12 months after taking ownership 
of the network. The company said the deal would not significantly 
dilute its earnings. IBM said the sale would not have a significant 
impact on its operating results, but at least one analyst expected 
that the deal could result in a huge tax bill for IBM. Steven Milunovich, 
an analyst with Merrill Lynch, estimated that IBM would report a capital 
gain of $4 billion on the network sale, for a tax bill totaling more 
than $1 billion. The $5 billion price was near the high end of the 
range that analysts had expected the network to bring. But the strategic 
elements of the deal hit a nerve in the market Tuesday, and shares 
of both companies rose. ``This is a sweetheart deal for IBM,'' said 
Stephen Dube, an analyst who follows IBM for Wasserstein Perella. 
The price, he said, is more than four times the unit's $1.2 billion 
annual revenue, a greater multiple than IBM is worth in the market 
overall. ``AT&AMP;T had to do the deal and paid up for it.'' But to 
win IBM's auction, AT&AMP;T had to come to the table with more than 
money for the network. It also agreed to outsource to IBM much of 
its own software and computer-center operations, to the tune of $4 
billion over 10 years. Under that part of the agreement, more than 
2,000 AT&AMP;T management employees would go to work for IBM. Most 
are in Lake Mary, Fla., and Middletown and Piscataway, N.J., an AT&AMP;T 
spokesman said. Another 1,000 unionized AT&AMP;T employees would essentially 
work for IBM, but would continue to be paid by AT&AMP;T. Armstrong 
said: ``I think we had to do all these things. I believe we had to 
give them top dollar. We did that. We had to put some outsourcing 
contracts on the table that were durable and meaningful, and we did, 
and we had to do some other things in terms of working together in 
approaching small businesses.'' Berge Ayvazian, an executive vice 
president for the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm in Boston, 
said, ``What this says is that AT&AMP;T recognizes that it is not 
best of breed on application development and data-center operations, 
and IBM is not best of breed in network services.'' The wild card 
in the deal appears to be Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., the 
Japanese giant that is the world's largest telephone company. The 
telecommunications industry has been waiting for years to see what 
NTT might do to expand overseas in a big way. NTT is one of the largest 
subcontractors in putting together the IBM network, so it will have 
increased ties with AT&AMP;T after the deal is completed. Armstrong 
refused to tip his hand but said, ``There is no question that the 
relationship of the network to NTT will strengthen the relationship 
between AT&AMP;T and NTT.''
