Some news organizations say their web sites have become just as important 
as their publications or broadcasts. Rick Lockridge looks at the changing 
face of the way news is covered in this edition of "tech trends." 
Mr. president, the house Judiciary committee -- News watching on the 
web. It's become a habit for millions. And three years after the earliest 
Internet news sites went online, web publishers and broadcasters came 
to Atlanta to talk about what they've learned. The first thing they've 
learned is that the early profits they all thought they were going 
to make are nowhere to be found. They're not too happy about the fact 
that a lot of these ventures are kind of bleeding money. But analyst 
Mark maradian says newspapers and broadcasters can't afford not to 
be online because of the potential payoff later on. They understand 
very well that that's where the future of advertising is. Advertising 
is already becoming more aggressive on the web. For example, if you 
order up a video clip on this particular web site, you have to watch 
a commercial first. Apply now by clicking on the first USA button. 
What are we looking for online? Surveys show most Internet news watchers 
click on national and international stories first. After that, business 
stories are the most popular, then sports and entertainment news. 
But news alone isn't enough. Web publishers say Internet customers 
want more -- more than newspapers or tV can give them. I think that 
what will win out in the end is good, quality, credible content combined 
with great services and commerce opportunities. But even though the 
Internet continues to grow at a phenomenal rate and could reach 100 
million users worldwide by the end of this year, rosenswag says there's 
little danger that online web sites will kill off their TV and newspaper 
counterparts. I think history has shown that one medium doesn't necessarily 
replace another medium. It actually expands the number that come in 
and use information. That growth in users and revenue is what the 
new media moguls are banking on. Rick Lockridge, CNN, Atlanta.
