A lawyer for Microsoft Corp. failed Tuesday to shake a computer-science 
expert from his argument that Internet software should not be included 
as part of Microsoft's Windows operating system. Central to the government's 
antitrust suit against Microsoft is the charge that the company bundled 
Internet browser software with Windows largely as a tactic to put 
competitors at a disadvantage. ``In general, designers have a huge 
amount of flexibility in how to package these files, the same way 
you have a large amount of flexibility in how you put things in a 
grocery bag, as long as you don't crush stuff,'' said David Farber, 
a senior computer-science professor at the University of Pennsylvania 
who is a government witness. ``Software is infinitely malleable.'' 
Steven Holley, a lawyer for Microsoft, contended that _ no matter 
how all those files got into Windows _ outside software developers 
now depend on them when they write programs for Windows. To that, 
Farber countered that ``there is no absolute efficiency given just 
because this is the way Microsoft has chosen to put all of this together.'' 
Toward the end of the day, Holley got down to the level of individual 
program files. He displayed a large poster listing 13 major files 
that testimony had shown are invoked when a computer user seeks an 
Internet address using Internet Explorer, Microsoft's browser. Then 
he asked Farber if each file could be deleted without damaging Windows. 
When the witness answered no to the first two, Holley pasted large 
red ``no'' stickers to the board, to reinforce Microsoft's argument 
that Explorer is an inseparable, integrated element of Windows. The 
theatrics fizzled, though, when Farber told him that the questions 
made no sense. Several files in question, he said, were key parts 
of the operating system invoked by all sorts of programs, not just 
Explorer. By asking those questions, the professor told Holley: ``You're 
asking me if I've stopped beating my wife.'' A moment later, U.S. 
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the case, asked 
Holley, ``Can we move on to another subject?'' Jackson showed interest 
in the discussion of individual computer files. He heard similar testimony 
last year, when he was deciding on the government's request for an 
order barring Microsoft from bundling Internet Explorer with Windows 
95. Early this year, Jackson ordered Microsoft to offer Windows 95 
in a form that hides access to Explorer. But a Court of Appeals panel 
overturned his ruling last summer. When the discussion Tuesday turned 
to one file used by Windows and Explorer, the judge interrupted Holley 
to ask the witness, ``If that code were part of Windows, is there 
any reason that Internet Explorer, as an application, could not invoke 
it?'' No, there was no reason, Farber answered. The very question 
troubled Microsoft executives, who have labored since the trial began 
to convince Jackson that Internet Explorer is not a stand-alone application 
and never has been. Holley later asked Farber about a section from 
the appellate court ruling, which is central to Microsoft's defense. 
The panel ruled that it would be ``absurdly inefficient'' to require 
consumers to stitch computer code together, a possible result if Explorer 
were removed from Windows. Farber mumbled for a moment, suggesting 
that he had trouble with the appellate court's language, but then 
explained, ``I don't want to criticize the court.'' To that, Jackson 
smiled and said, ``Oh, go ahead.''
