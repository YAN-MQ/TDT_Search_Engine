A power failure struck San Francisco at the height of the rush hour 
Tuesday morning, cutting service to more than a million people, leaving 
train commuters stranded under San Francisco Bay, stalling trolleys 
and electric buses in the streets and forcing businesses, some schools 
and the stock exchange to shut down. The power went out about 8:15 
a.m. PST, when a construction crew at a transmission station in San 
Mateo County, south of San Francisco, failed to remove a pipe at the 
right time, said Gordon Smith, president and chief executive officer 
of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a subsidiary of PG&AMP;E Corp. That 
``simple, human error'' tripped a protective device that shut down 
an entire system _ three major power lines _ for more than six hours. 
A 75-year-old woman crossing a city street was struck and killed by 
a tractor-trailer in a hit-and-run accident that occurred shortly 
after the power failure began. But Dewayne Tully, a Police Department 
spokesman, said the police could not say whether the lack of street 
lights caused the accident. ``It's very hard to say whether this was 
caused by the power outage,'' Tully said. ``Traffic was moving very 
slowly. But drivers were probably watching each other more than pedestrians. 
And with all the confusion, it's likely that the power outage was 
a contributing factor.'' The power failure trapped hundreds of people 
in elevators, stranded subway and train passengers for more than an 
hour and slowed downtown traffic to a crawl. Most hospitals canceled 
elective surgeries, and many banks, automated teller machines and 
major department stores were closed. No looting or other major accidents 
were reported. But the power failure, which affected most of San Francisco 
and parts of San Mateo County, caused massive confusion for hundreds 
of thousands of people, forcing drivers back to the polite days of 
the four-way stop, shutting down much of the commuter transit system 
and diverting planes headed to San Francisco in the first hour of 
the emergency to San Jose, Oakland, St. Louis, Seattle and Phoenix. 
By noon, power in San Francisco was slowly being restored, police 
officers were stationed at major traffic stops and Mayor Willie Brown 
had announced that ``people should just carry on life as they did 
before.'' But many people decided not to wait until the power was 
restored, and turned around and went home. By midday, when electricity 
had been restored to about two-thirds of San Francisco, traffic heading 
out of the city was as heavy as it is in the 5 o'clock rush hour. 
Those who did not go home simply stood around outside despite the 
50-degree weather. Downtown office workers lined the streets, smoking, 
drinking coffee and talking on cellular phones. Long lines formed 
at every ATM machine that turned on, and stores where power had been 
restored had lines out the door. ``Our building is mostly out, and 
the day is shot,'' said Reed Jones, an independent financial analyst 
who works on Market Street, the main street of the financial district, 
as he waited in line. ``We could use the phones, but not the computers. 
We're worried that when the power comes back on, if the computers 
are on, they'll fry.'' PG&AMP;E officials announced that power was 
restored at 2:05 p.m., but radio news stations later reported receiving 
complaints from people who said they still had no electricity. Maria 
and Peter Krauss, tourists on their second honeymoon, waited in a 
big crowd in front of Macy's in Union Square for the store to open 
Tuesday afternoon. ``We're from Germany,'' Mrs. Krauss said. ``We 
think this is so funny. Everybody is very polite and orderly.'' ``We 
were in Nordstrom's and the clerks were ringing up purchases with 
calculators,'' Kraus said. ``I think that's a very sophisticated approach 
to a crisis.''
