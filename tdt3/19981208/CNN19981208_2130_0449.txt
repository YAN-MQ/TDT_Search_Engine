This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for tomorrow morning. And you can see the cold front in 
the east carrying the rainfall with it as it continues its trek out 
into the atlantic. And colder air moves into the eastern half of the 
nation, bringing to an end the record-setting warm temperatures we've 
been seeing over the last several days. Another cold front pushes 
through the plains states. No significant precipitation in association 
with it. Large area of high pressure in the west, but temperatures 
throughout the west are still quite chilly, with daytime highs only 
in the 20s in the central Rockies. Much of the east cooler than it 
has been, but still warmer than the temperatures we are seeing in 
the west. Your extended forecast calls for a mix of rain and thunderstorms 
along the gulf coast area. We'll see a few snow flurries in the Great 
Lakes region, too. As we head on into Friday, things warm a bit in 
the west. But showers and thunderstorms are possible in the east. 
And on Saturday, snow showers are possible in the Great Lakes area.
