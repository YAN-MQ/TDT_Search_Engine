President Clinton's fate, if and when the issue reaches the house 
floor, would depend on moderate republicans, some of whom representing 
districts that voted for the president. They're struggling with their 
decision personally and politically. Tonight, NBC's Lisa Myers on 
one such republican, a californian. Republican Brian Bilbray says 
he's in political trouble no matter how he votes on impeachment. His 
San Diego district, evenly split between democrats and republicans, 
voted for Bill Clinton twice, and is now deeply divided over whether 
to impeach him. Today, after reading his latest E-mail from home, 
Bilbray listens carefully to the president's defense. They have to 
wake up to the fact that this is not just a public relations war. 
This is a constitutional crisis. Like many moderates, Bilbray believes 
the president has seriously hurt his own cause. What's frustrated 
me is the president of the United States using the O.J. defense, that 
"I am a victim of a huge conspiracy, and everybody else is at fault, 
not me." Do you believe that he's shown contempt for the process? 
I think that he has shown a total disrespect for the process. Bilbray 
has problems with hard liners in his own party, too. He says voters 
punished them in November because of the talk of impeachment. And 
that impeachment may further damage the party. But Bilbray also feels 
the weight of history and says he'll vote based on the evidence. Do 
you think the president lied under oath? I think the president lied 
under oath. I know, in my heart, that the president lied, knew he 
was lying, consciously lied. Do you believe lying under oath is an 
impeachable offense? I think perjury is an impeachable offense. He 
says the ultimate test of his decision will be his children. I've 
got to be able to go home and look my children in the eye and explain 
to them why their father voted one way or the other on impeachment. 
Tonight his children are split on what their father should do. The 
fate of a president, at least party, in his hands. Lisa Myers, NBC 
news, Washington.
