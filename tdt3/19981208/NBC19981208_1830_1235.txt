President Clinton still is scheduled to leave for the Middle East 
this weekend despite growing concerns about security and the prospects 
the recent peace deal could collapse at any moment. So is this trip 
really a good idea? We have two reports tonight beginning with NBC's 
Martin Fletcher. The West Bank today looks more like it's heading 
for war than peace. In towns Palestinians, fighting with Israeli troops, 
demanding the release of political prisoners from Israeli jails. In 
the last two days alone, more than 70 people wounded. The Palestinian 
demonstrators want Clinton to pressure Israel to free the prisoners. 
Israeli prime minister Netanyahu vowed he will never free them. He 
says they are terrorists and have "blood on their hands." Clinton's 
visit has also divided the Israeli government. Some cabinet members 
want the president to cancel his visit. They don't want him to come 
because they fear that Israel will have to pay a very heavy price. 
The price, they say, a Clinton visit amounts to an endorsement of 
palestinian state and that would encourage more violence by Palestinians. 
For Netanyahu, this is tricky. How to hold his government together 
while not insulting America? The president of the United States is 
welcome in Israel. Nothing else could be possible. For Palestinian 
President Yasser Arafat, a visit from an American president to impoverished 
Gaza is historic. Only two months ago, the three leaders thought this 
visit would be a Turning point. But once again, old hatreds could 
stop anything from change changing. Martin Fletcher, NBC news, Tel 
Aviv.
