The radiation belts surrounding earth may be more dangerous for spacewalking 
astronauts than previously believed. Scientists say the phenomena 
known as the Van Allen belts can spawn "killer electrons" when the 
earth's magnetic field changes. We think that these electrons that 
we're studying could have an important effect not only on satellites, 
which we know has happened in the past, but could also effect the 
astronauts by creating large doses of radiation that could influence 
their health. The electrons can penetrate through lots of material, 
including spacesuits and can pass through, in fact, the walls of the 
space station and can create high charges deep inside of these objects. 
Fluctuations in the Van Allen belt contributed to the failure of a 
Canadian satellite in 1996.
