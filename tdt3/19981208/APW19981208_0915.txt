The discovery of the Rosetta Stone, which gave the clue to deciphering 
ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, will be celebrated with a six-month 
exhibition next year, the British Museum said Tuesday. The slab of 
black granite, found by French troops near Rosetta on the banks of 
the Nile in 1799, is the museum's most popular treasure and always 
attracts crowds, said director Robert Anderson. The stone is inscribed 
with a royal decree of Ptolemy V in 196 B.C. in three scripts: hieroglyphic, 
a popular written form of ancient Egyptian and ancient Greek. British 
troops at war with Napoleon Bonaparte seized the stone from the French 
and it entered the museum in 1802. Twenty years later it was deciphered 
by the French archaeologist Francois Champollion. The exhibition, 
``Cracking Codes: The Rosetta Stone and Decipherment,'' opens in June 
1999. It will illustrate the role and effects of writing in a single 
culture which lasted for 3,000 years, hieroglyphs and scripts in other 
countries and current work on decipherment.
