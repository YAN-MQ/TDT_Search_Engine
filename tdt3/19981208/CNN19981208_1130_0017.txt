Impeachment hearings on Capitol Hill have reached a critical point. 
What happens this week could have a profound impact on Mr. Clinton's 
presidency and legacy. White House lawyers and a panel of experts 
are appearing before the house judiciary committee to make their case 
against impeaching president clinton. White House special counsel 
Gregory Craig says he plans to present a Powerful case based on the 
facts. He says while the president's behavior was wrong and misleading, 
it does not warrant removing him from office. When it comes to constitutional 
standards for impeachment as conceived by the founding fathers, we 
will show that the constitution requires proof of official misconduct, 
and abuse of high public office. For the drastic remedy of impeachment 
to be appropriate. When it comes to standards of proof that should 
apply to the evidence that is brought before this commit, we will 
argue that this president should be considered innocent until proven 
guilty, and that he should be informed with particularity as to the 
facts and specifics of the misconduct that he is accused of. Especially 
when it comes to the allegations of perjury. On those allegations, 
we will show that neither the law of perjury nor the facts of this 
case could sustain a criminal prosecution, much less impeachment.
