Astronauts labored 240 miles above earth Monday, hooking up electrical 
connections in the core of the new space station. They had 135 tools 
at their disposal and completed the job in four hours -- less time 
than expected. Two more space walks are scheduled during "endeavour's" 
12-day mission. On Thursday, the astronauts are scheduled to enter 
the station for the first time and leave behind supplies for future 
crews.
