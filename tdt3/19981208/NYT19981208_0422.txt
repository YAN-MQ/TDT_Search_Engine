Christmas is in the air, even if the air has been springtime warm. 
Maybe it was nature's way of getting even with all those stores that 
hasten the holiday mood ever earlier each year with their displays 
of Santa dolls shaking their moneymakers among the plastic fir trees 
and Mylar garlands. If things keep up like this, don't be surprised 
if they start piping in the Christmas carols in June. Come to think 
of it, last June was when Gene Gramm started thinking about holiday 
music, and since then he has longed to hear carols echoing through 
the hills. Forest Hills in Queens, that is. He was rooting through 
an old suitcase one day in his apartment when he unearthed a folded 
sheet of paper that contained lyrics he had written years ago, ``Good 
Night, Sweet Prince _ A Christmas Night Carol.'' The words first floated 
into his mind on Christmas Day in 1957, after he answered the phone 
while at home reading ``Hamlet,'' only to be told that his mother 
had died. Since rediscovering the song, Gramm has searched without 
luck for a composer who will set to music the words that have stayed 
with him ever since. ``Am I being presumptuous in deciding that I 
am going to join the pantheon of carol writers?'' asked Gramm, 79, 
a poet and retired advertising copywriter. ``This is just something 
that is unresolved and must be done. It is an unfulfilled mission 
to get this thing written and make it actual. It's a carol. It's not 
a poem. It goes beyond.'' He was sick at home during the holidays 
in 1957 and deep into a fat volume of Shakespeare's collected works, 
when his brother called to tell him that their mother had died in 
California. Because he had a bad infection, he checked with his doctor 
to see if he could get on a plane and attend the funeral, but his 
doctor advised against it. He stayed in New York. ``The rest of the 
day was a dazed blank to me,'' he said. ``I don't remember much, except 
that the beginnings of the carol came to me. I kept saying over and 
over again, `Good night, sweet prince.' I even changed the gender 
to `Good night, sweet princess.' That's all I remember.'' He thought 
every now and then about fleshing out the lyrics, but he never did 
it. It wasn't until he was teaching a copywriting course in the mid-1980s 
that inspiration kicked in. He was telling his students about how 
poetic metaphors come from life, and he shared with them the few lines 
of the carol he had written. As his students left the classroom, he 
sat down at a desk and started scribbling. Good night, Sweet Prince, 
good night, Sweet Prince ... that star now has softened its light; 
and all other babes have been sleeping long since for this glorious 
day is now night. He wrote three more stanzas that also stayed pretty 
much in darkness, stashed in a suitcase until last June. After he 
stumbled across the lyrics, he set out to find a composer. A jingle 
writer he knew from his advertising days was out of commission with 
a bum hand. Another musician he met was intrigued but begged off because 
he was facing eviction from his apartment. He sent a copy of the lyrics 
to Cardinal John O'Connor. ``I thought if I was seriously going to 
pursue all this, I got to get an authentic kosher seal of approval, 
and who's better than the archbishop of New York?'' he said. ``He 
didn't say it was the greatest carol to come down the pike since `O 
Holy Night,' but he was encouraging.'' This is all somewhat of a surprising 
mission for Gramm, since he is Jewish, which is something he regards 
more as a cultural identity than a religious one. But he said he grew 
up in Brooklyn admiring Gandhi, Lincoln and Jesus. ``I'll throw in 
St. Francis, too, because he was a poet,'' Gramm said. ``Jesus and 
I did have something in common, though. We both had Jewish mothers.'' 
So did Irving Berlin, and he wrote the most popular holiday tune of 
all, ``White Christmas.'' Perhaps Gramm's memory of his mother keeps 
him searching for the right notes. Setting his words to music may 
set him at ease about that Christmas Day when he missed his flight. 
So although flights of angels inspired him to lyricism, he'll be restless 
until the once-buried words ring in the season. ``Maybe hearing people 
singing it will bring me full closure,'' he said. ``Maybe that's the 
truth in this. Infection or not, maybe I should have gotten on that 
plane.''
