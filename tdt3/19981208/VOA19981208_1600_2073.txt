Who were kidnapped two months ago. VOA correspondent Peter Heinlein 
has this story in Moscow. The four men: three Britons and a New Zealander. 
Were working for a British firm installing a mobile phone system. 
When they were abducted October 3 in the Chechen capitol, Grozny. 
Police say the heads of the victims were discovered Tuesday. By the 
side of a road by a village about 40 kilometers west of the capitol. 
The remains were identified by a man who worked for the men as a bodyguard. 
Chechan President Aslan Maskhadov issued a statement blaming what 
he called "foreign special forces" for the killings. He described 
the incident as an attempt to hinder Chechnya's attempts to build 
relations abroad. Hostage takings have become commonplace in the breakaway 
region. Since Russian forces withdrew in 1996. Following a 21 month
