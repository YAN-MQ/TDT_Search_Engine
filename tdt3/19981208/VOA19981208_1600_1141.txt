The city of Philadelphia has become the latest victim. Of the National 
Basketball Association's labor dispute. As the league canceled the 
1999 All-Star game. The game, which was scheduled to be played February 
14 in Philadelphia's First Union Center. Was canceled Tuesday afternoon. 
The 160th day of the player lockout. League commissioner David Stern 
said in light of the continuing labor dispute. He had no choice but 
to cancel the All-Star weekend. But Stern said he still hopes a partial 
season can be played. If somebody says they don't think I want to 
cancel the season. I certainly would hope that that's true. And I 
plead guilty to that. That doesn't mean that at a certain time, when 
we look at all of the factors of the ongoing bases. That the season 
won't cancel itself. Some 250 games have already been lost due to 
the lockout.
