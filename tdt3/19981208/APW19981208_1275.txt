The United Nations on Tuesday launched an intensive search for Iraq's 
illegal weapons amid Iraqi charges that its arms inspectors are again 
trying to harass Baghdad. ``We are undertaking a very intensive schedule,'' 
Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman in Baghdad, told The Associated 
Press. ``We have several teams in town. We need to test Iraq's pledge 
to comply.'' The official Iraqi News Agency said the inspectors made 
32 surprise visits, the highest since they returned to Baghdad last 
month. Iraq did not hide its anger as the weapons inspectors speeded 
up their probe. State-run newspapers quoted Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq Aziz, currently on a visit to Moscow, as saying that there is 
a limit to Iraqi compliance. They quoted him as saying that Iraq has 
been cooperating with the U.N. inspectors for more than seven years 
but is yet to see an end to economic sanctions. ``This situation is 
no longer acceptable,'' Aziz was quoted as saying. The sanctions, 
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, cannot be lifted until 
the weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is free of weapons of chemical 
and biological weapons and long-range missiles. Late Monday, Foreign 
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said a team of 39 inspectors has 
arrived in Iraq, and branded them ``commandos'' trying to create problems. 
But Ms. Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman, denied a new team had 
come. ``There is no reason for the Iraqis to worry if they are going 
to comply,'' she said. There are now about 140 weapons experts in 
Iraq in addition ``to several visiting teams,'' she said. On Tuesday, 
nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare teams and a missile 
unit conducted the 32 searches, using helicopters and vehicles, the 
Iraqi News Agency said. The inspectors resumed their work last month 
after a nearly three-month hiatus during which Iraq had banned them 
from visiting any new suspected weapons sites. Iraq allowed them back 
and pledged full cooperation as the United States and Britain were 
preparing to launch military strikes on Nov. 14. Ms. Cross refused 
to characterize Tuesday's inspections as ``surprise'' but called them 
the ``usual hard work.'' However, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard 
Butler had earlier said that a series of surprise visits would begin 
Tuesday in a final test of Baghdad's pledge of cooperation. He said 
the unannounced checks will finish late this week or early next week. 
After that he would report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan whether 
Iraq is making good on its promise to cooperate. Annan then will report 
to the U.N. Security Council, which must decide whether there is room 
for starting a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. 
resolutions. Iraq hopes that the review will lead to lifting the sanctions 
_ a move that the United States and Britain have not been willing 
to guarantee.
