Two spacewalking astronauts faced the hardest and most important job 
of their careers Monday: hooking up 40 electrical connections between 
the first two pieces of the international space station. The work 
called for Jerry Ross, NASA's most experienced spacewalker, and James 
Newman to clamp together the connectors for power and data flow. The 
spacewalk, the first of three scheduled for this week, was expected 
to last 6{ hours. On Sunday, Endeavour's crew used the shuttle's robot 
arm and thruster rockets to snap together the Russian-made piece, 
Zarya, and the American-built component, Unity, forming a seven-story, 
35-ton tower in Endeavour's cargo bay. Construction of the space station 
hinges on making the hookups, warned NASA's lead flight director, 
Bob Castle. Unity, a connecting passageway, needs the solar power 
generated by the Zarya control module to survive. Working 240 miles 
above Earth, Ross and Newman had 135 tools at their disposal and a 
horde of engineers standing by in two countries to offer advice. Once 
all the connectors were joined, flight controllers planned to turn 
on the power inside the fledgling station. Newman had the more unwieldy 
job, Ross the more hand-intensive. The plan called for Newman to unclamp 
each jumper cable and hand it to Ross to link to its mate on the other 
side. With each electrical connector attached to 20- to 30-foot cables, 
it was going to be like handling ``an octopus and depending upon how 
cold those cables are going to be it could be a relatively stiff octopus,'' 
Ross predicted before the flight. Before locking the connectors together, 
Ross had to inspect each end to make sure the tiny pins inside were 
not bent or caked with debris. Each man's spacesuit was equipped with 
a mini jetpack in case their safety lines to the shuttle broke. Endeavour 
is so loaded that it would be difficult for it to dash after a runaway 
spacewalker. NASA deliberately picked two pros for the job and, even 
then, had both men go through 200 hours of training underwater, the 
closest approximation to weightlessness on Earth. Ross, 50, a husky 
Air Force colonel, has made four previous spacewalks, not to mention 
real construction experience. He worked in a steel mill and did highway 
construction work back in his college days. The taller, thinner Newman, 
a 42-year-old physicist, conducted a station-practice spacewalk in 
1993.
