Coming up, lights out all over San Francisco, hundreds of thousands 
without power. All of a sudden the lights went out. And it was the 
first time I'd ever experienced it in San Francisco. Chaos on the 
streets of San Francisco, how could it happen? And the FBI opens its 
secret files on Frank Sinatra. What do these documents reveal about 
the mob and the chairman of the board? I'm so clogged up. I just can't 
focus. You okay? No...if this meeting doesn't go well... it's all 
that work wasted. You've gotta stay focused. I'll find a way. Clear 
the congestion with tavist-D. Prescription strength. just one gives 
you 12 hours of uninterrupted relief. To get that, you'd need four 
Tylenol cold pills. Tavist-D clears your congestion so you're clear-headed 
again. Why be congested? Be clear-headed, clear through your day with 
tavist-D.
