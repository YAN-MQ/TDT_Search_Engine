I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
It's turned much colder in the northeast after record high temperatures 
yesterday in a number of locations, including into the mid-70s in 
central park in New York. Highs there today back into the low 40s. 
Some 30s in through northern New England, where highs yesterday were 
as warm as the lower 70s. It remains cool, too, in much of the western 
U.S. here's the forecast showing more of the same. Wet weather in 
the northeast, associated with that front which brought the colder 
temperatures. We'll see that move off towards the east by late tomorrow. 
High pressure's building into the west, and that is going to continue 
to bring the cool temperatures down and mean, again, the threat for 
more windy conditions in sections of the southwest. Extended forecast, 
on Thursday, we'll look for thunderstorms along the gulf coast. Some 
rain in the pacific northwest and flurries back through the Great 
Lakes as temperatures remain cold through much of the midwest. On 
Friday, showers and storms will be likely in the southeast. We'll 
find some more showers in the pacific northwest. And as we head on 
into Saturday, again, snow showers through the lakes and a few showers 
likely in Florida. For even more weather information, log into CNN.com.
