Gulf Arab oil ministers agreed Tuesday to cut oil production to shore 
up depressed world prices, officials close to the talks said. They 
said that oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council 
have agreed to reduce production starting in March and to ask other 
producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to 
join them in the cuts.
