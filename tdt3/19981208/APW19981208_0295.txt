The United States is urging Australia to accept a proposal by an American 
company to establish a dump for the world's nuclear waste. Seattle-based 
company Pangea has been quietly promoting the concept for two years. 
It was forced to go public with its plans last week when green groups 
uncovered a promotional video extolling Australia's qualities as a 
dump site. U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy on weapons 
of mass destruction, Robert Gallucci, said Tuesday that the proposal 
would not only be profitable for Australia but would also be a service 
to the international community. ``Australia could play a role in that, 
I think it would make a tremendous contribution to international security,'' 
he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. Australia had a history 
of being active in promoting the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons 
of mass destruction, he said. ``I can't help but think that the economics 
would be very favorable for a commercial arrangement that involved 
addressing the needs of so many countries who do not have the geology 
for the long term storage of spent nuclear fuel or radioactive waste,'' 
he said. A spokeswoman for Industry and Resources Minister Nick Minchin 
said Australia had no plans to become an international nuclear waste 
dump. ``Government policy is not to accept waste from other countries 
and there is no intention to change that,'' she said, speaking on 
the customary condition of anonymity.
