An Egyptian man who is bitterly fighting his deportation has been 
charged with making false statements in a decade-old immigration matter, 
leading to sharp criticism from his lawyers about the government's 
tactics. The case of Nasser Ahmed has received national attention 
because, until Friday, he had been held for more than two and a half 
years in solitary confinement without being charged with a crime, 
based on assertions that Ahmed is a member of an Islamic terrorist 
group in Egypt. Citing national security concerns, the government 
has refused to make public most of its evidence about Ahmed's suspected 
terrorist connections, making his case one of about two dozen in the 
country in which the authorities have moved to deport or exclude an 
immigrant on the basis of secret evidence. On Tuesday, Defense lawyers 
for Ahmed denounced the new charge against their client, contending 
that prosecutors had singled him out in retaliation for his stand 
in the immigration dispute. ``We have a name for that,'' said one 
of his lawyers, Abdeen Jabara. ``It's called selective prosecution. 
And it's also called prosecutorial misconduct.'' A spokesman for the 
U.S. Attorney in Manhattan said there would be no comment on the new 
indictment or on why Ahmed has not been charged with terrorism. But 
prosecutors have already asserted in legal papers that Ahmed, 38, 
is a member of an Egyptian-based extremist organization, the Islamic 
Group, which has claimed responsibility for several acts of terrorism. 
They have also described Ahmed as ``a loyal supporter'' of the group's 
spiritual leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who is serving a life prison 
term for his conviction in 1995 in a conspiracy to blow up the United 
Nations and other New York City landmarks. Ahmed, who acted as the 
sheik's legal assistant during the 1995 trial, has denied any role 
in terrorism or membership in the extremist group, his lawyers said. 
Ahmed, speaking by phone from the Federal Correctional Center at Otisville, 
N.Y., said of the new charge: ``It really shows they have nothing 
at all.'' ``They've been raising national security concerns for almost 
three years now,'' he added, ``and it's boiled down'' to the false 
statement charge. Ahmed was charged with making a series of false 
statements from 1987 to 1990 in connection with his application for 
temporary residence status. David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown 
University who represents Ahmed, said he believed the criminal charge 
was an attempt to buttress the case the government is to make next 
week when Ahmed appears for a hearing before an immigration judge 
in Manhattan. For that hearing, Cole said, the government has already 
submitted more secret evidence to support deportation. Some legal 
scholars and other critics have attacked the use of secret evidence 
on due process grounds, contending that it makes it impossible for 
immigrants and their lawyers to mount an adequate defense. The government 
defends the practice as justified to protect sensitive counterterrorism 
intelligence sources and law enforcement efforts. Ahmed was arrested 
in 1995 on a charge that he had overstayed his visa, and was released 
on a $15,000 bond. He was arrested again in April 1996, and the government 
cited classified evidence in later hearings to support his continued 
detention. At first, Ahmed and his lawyers were told only that the 
information concerned his ``association with a known terrorist organization,'' 
Cole said. Later, the government declassified what he described as 
``dribs and drabs'' of evidence, including more than 100 pages of 
heavily blacked-out transcripts of immigration proceedings. Charging 
that the government is using ``guilt by association'' to attack his 
client, he added: ``They are throwing around words like `terrorist,''' 
but they indict him on a document fraud from 10 years ago.''
