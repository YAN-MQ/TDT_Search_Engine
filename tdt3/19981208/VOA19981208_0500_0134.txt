UN arms inspectors in Iraq are beginning what is seen as a crucial 
phase of their investigation of banned weapons sites. Vans were seen 
leaving the UN compound in Baghdad today but UN officials said nothing 
about their destinations. Chief inspector Richard Butler announced 
on Monday that beginning today, his teams would carry out challenge 
inspections of sites with no advance warning. This could lead to a 
review of Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions.
