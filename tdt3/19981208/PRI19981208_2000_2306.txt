Better unpark your parka because we are headed due north in today's 
geography quiz. We are just south of the Arctic circle in search of 
the hottest city in Iceland and we are not talking about the temperature. 
This city is a hub of culture. With more than 50 museums and galleries, 
two theater companies, a symphony and an orchestra. All enjoyed by 
more than 100,000 residents. Heat is at the heart of our mystery location. 
In fact, this site means bay of smokes because of the steam that billows 
up from the thermal springs that supply the city's heating system. 
Our mystery metropolis is nestled on the edge of Fauxa Bay, and it 
is surrounded by mountains. It is also known as the most northern 
capital in the world and the residents claim they live in the cleanest 
city on earth. One final clue, this city serves up a rather odd dish, 
puffin. Well, my name is Anthony, and I will be serving you up a plate 
of that and the answer to today's geography quiz in just a few minutes.
