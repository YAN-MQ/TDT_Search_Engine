First, the latest world news. I'm Robert Burns, VOA News. A White 
House lawyer and a panel of experts are testifying before the House 
Judiciary Committee. In an effort to dissuade lawmakers from voting 
for articles of impeachment against President Clinton. Lawyer Gregory 
Craig told the 37 members of the committee that President Clinton 
is genuinely sorry for his behavior. Regarding his relationship with 
former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. But he said this behavior 
does not warrant impeachment. And he promised to wage a powerful case 
against such action. Mr. Craig said nothing in the record or the facts 
deserves overturning a national election and removing the President 
from office. There are two things that I think are very important 
to get straight. One is that the characterization of the President's 
testimony. In each one of those incidents is inaccurate. And the second 
thing is that you've mixed up grand jury testimony with civil deposition 
testimony. In very dangerous and misleading ways. Independent counsel 
Kenneth Starr has accused the President of perjury, obstruction of 
justice, and abuse of power. In trying to conceal his relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky. Actions, Mr. Starr says, are impeachable offenses. 
At one point in the proceedings, committee chairman Henry Hyde said 
the facts in the case are hard to ignore. I will listen most intently 
to see if anybody - anybody repudiates, rejects, rebuts the facts. 
House Judiciary Chairman, Henry Hyde.
