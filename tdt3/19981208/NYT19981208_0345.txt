Gregory Bestor Craig, the newly hired special White House counsel, 
brought a fresh and open face, an eager-to-please earnestness, and 
a sackful of secondhand contrition to the House Judiciary Committee 
Tuesday. His political skills were evident as he took a novel tack 
for a presidential lawyer and spoke in familiar, even friendly terms 
about what was ``very important to get straight.'' His legal skills 
were evident as he politely challenged subtle assumptions in Republican 
questions and gingerly disposed of inquiries about ``intimate touching.'' 
``I will now push the button of my mike,'' Craig said with a disarming 
grin, after nervously beginning his defense only to discover that 
he was performing unplugged. ``That would help,'' replied a suddenly 
indulgent Henry Hyde, the committee's chairman. But despite his unslicked 
silver thatch and unusual willingness to address details of accusations 
against Clinton, when Craig came up against the walls of the president's 
legal and political box, he would go no further _ just like any other 
Clinton defender. Did Clinton ``lie to the American people people 
when he said, `I never had sex with that woman?''' asked Rep. Bob 
Inglis of South Carolina, and a pained expression darted across Craig's 
face. ``You know, he doesn't believe he did,'' Craig said, embarking 
on an explication of dictionary definitions of sex. Inglis was not 
impressed. ``You're taking back all of his apologies,'' he snapped. 
On display Tuesday were all the attributes with which Craig, who was 
hired in September, has won over once-skeptical White House aides. 
But those qualities may not have worked as well on the audience that 
the White House is most concerned about, the Republican moderates 
who will decide the president's fate. It was an indication of Craig's 
ingenuous charm that he could, with a straight face and no whiff of 
irony, appeal to the hardened members of the House's most ideologically 
riven committee to ``open your heart.'' And it was an indication of 
Craig's pedigree and connections that, according to a White House 
official, one of the witnesses, Samuel Beers, taught him at Harvard 
College, while another, Bruce Ackerman, taught him at Yale Law School. 
Connections brought Craig to the White House. He knew President Clinton 
from his days at Yale, and was close to Hillary Rodham Clinton. She 
turned over space in her suite of offices to him when he agreed to 
join the defense team. A criminal lawyer and onetime Capitol Hill 
staff member who was most recently a senior State Department official, 
Craig bargained hard for authority before he accepted the White House 
job, insisting that he would report directly to the president, White 
House officials said. After Clinton announced that Craig would ``quarterback'' 
his defense, his new colleagues began referring rather derisively 
to him as ``The QB,'' a nickname that has stuck. In this Arkansas-inflected 
White House, it did not help Craig that he is resolutely preppy, with 
a fondness for sweaters and expressions like ``varsity effort.'' ``He 
could have been toast,'' one of his White House peers reflected Tuesday. 
Instead, for the most part, he has fit in. ``It's a real tribute to 
his temperament and his talent that he has gotten such universal acceptance,'' 
said Paul Begala, a White House counselor. There is still some tension, 
White House aides said, between Craig and Charles Ruff, the White 
House counsel. But for the most part Craig, Ruff and David Kendall, 
the president's private lawyer, have managed to divide responsibility 
among themselves. Any disputes are refereed by John Podesta, the chief 
of staff. Further, the monthslong divide between the political and 
legal sides of Clinton's defense has been sealed up, partly because 
of Craig's ability to mediate between them. ``Greg comes pretty close 
to being fluent in both languages,'' said another senior White House 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He's got a good political 
sense.'' And his preppiness has begun to seem endearing, this aide 
said. ``I think that while some people in conversations with Greg 
might think they'd been a member of a different fraternity than him 
in college,'' he said, ``they basically like him.'' That appeal was 
one reason that Craig was selected to open the president's two-day 
defense before the committee. ``He makes a good first impression,'' 
one White House adviser said Tuesday night. After congressional criticism 
that Clinton has not seemed contrite enough lately, Craig went out 
of his way to deplore Clinton's behavior as ``sinful'' and his testimony 
as ``maddening.'' Several congressmen seemed to warm to this approach, 
at least at first. ``Mr. Craig, I'm glad we're getting into facts,'' 
said Bill McCollum of Florida, one of the president's most dogged 
critics. He and other congressmen seized on Craig's seeming openness 
to debating specifics, peppering him with questions about the president's 
discussions with Betty Currie, his personal secretary, and reading 
him quotations from Clinton's testimony. ``They tried to drag Greg 
further into it than we anticipated,'' said one senior White House 
official. The White House had expected that the actual line-by-line 
defense of the president would be left on Wednesday to Ruff, who is 
more steeped in the details of the case. ``Mr. Ruff is coming,'' Craig 
said at one point, trying to divert his questioners. The congressmen 
bridled as it became clear that, for all his approachable manner, 
Craig would not back away from the president's contention that he 
did not commit perjury or obstruct justice when he concealed his relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton's defenders believe that he would face 
prosecution after leaving office if he made such an acknowledgment. 
The argument over perjury _ which turns less on facts than on interpretation 
_ inevitably sounds like hairsplitting, White House officials said, 
since perjury has a precise legal definition. Hence, when the White 
House tries to debate perjury, it inevitably irritates the moderates. 
It was a bind Craig could not avoid. As he battled accusations of 
perjury, he slid toward the legal language he mostly avoided, arguing 
that it was important to ``particularize'' such matters. In carving 
out space between Ruff and Kendall, Craig has focused on relations 
with Congress, White House officials said. The White House is relying 
on a loose network of aides, Cabinet secretaries and former officials 
to gather intelligence from Capitol Hill and relay White House arguments 
against impeachment. Many in this network are encouraged to refer 
their congressional contacts to Craig, one official said. One Clinton 
loyalist said that, in the end, the president would have to contact 
wavering House members himself. ``He is still trying to dodge and 
bob and weave,'' this person said. ``At some point, the president 
is going to have to engage those people.'' Craig kept his cool throughout 
the day. At one point he moved toward the microphone and opened his 
mouth to answer a congressman's accusation, then smiled wryly as it 
became clear the man would not pause for a response. But occasionally 
he showed a flash of impatience, as when Bob Barr of Georgia pressed 
him on why Clinton had not fired a senior aide, Sidney Blumenthal. 
Even then, his manner and grammar were dignified. ``I'd like to finish,'' 
Craig said, as Barr talked over him. ``May I?''
