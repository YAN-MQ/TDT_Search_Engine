United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan says all military action 
by the international community must be approved by the Security Council. 
Mr. Annan told the French National Assembly Tuesday, that intervention 
without Security Council approval violates the U.N. charter. He said 
it would also lead to military intervention based on national need. 
Instead of a shared responsibility. Mr. Annan is in Paris for the 
50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
