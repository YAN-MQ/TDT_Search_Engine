Environmentalists say one of Cambodia's most sacred and historic temples 
could be threatened by a military development project, a local newspaper 
reported Tuesday. A 2,400-hectare (5,900-acre) forest near Phnom Kulen 
temple in northern Cambodia has been approved ``for agriculture, exploitation 
and services to support the needs'' of the Cambodian army, The Cambodia 
Daily reported, citing a copy of the contract. The contract is an 
apparent violation of Cambodian law, as the dense forests surrounding 
Phnom Kulen, just east of the famed Angkor Wat temple, were declared 
a protected area by King Norodom Sihanouk in 1993. Chay Samith, acting 
director of conservation at the Environment Ministry, confirmed the 
project will encroach on protected land. He said the ministry would 
urge Hun Sen's Cabinet to reconsider the deal, the paper reported. 
``It is a historic site for eco-tourism and cultural tourism,'' Chay 
Samith told the newspaper. He said that if the trees are cleared the 
temples will be exposed to strong winds and erosion. The contract 
to develop Phnom Kulen was approved by the government in June and 
bears the signatures of Prime Minister Hun Sen and army Chief of Staff 
Gen. Ke Kim Yan, according to The Cambodia Daily. The development 
reportedly include construction of a hotel, casino and hydroelectric 
power station, the paper said. Phnom Kulen is considered the birthplace 
of the Angkor Empire and the Cambodian monarchy. King Jayavarman II 
declared independence in a ceremony at the temple in the year 802. 
As the kingdom expanded to include much of present-day Thailand, Jayavarman's 
successors built Angkor Wat and the surrounding temples that have 
been described as some of the world's greatest architectural wonders. 
They are now Cambodia's most popular tourist attractions. Until recently, 
Phnom Kulen was considered too dangerous for tourists because of Khmer 
Rouge guerrillas in the northern jungles. The guerrilla group weakened 
and collapsed over the past two years, allowing the government to 
reopen Phnom Kulen to visitors.
