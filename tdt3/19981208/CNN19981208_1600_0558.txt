In the Philippine capital, hundreds of mourners gathered today as 
24 victims of an orphanage fire were buried. Mike Cohen has details. 
There were tears. There was anger at the loss of so many so young 
at Manila's north cemetery tuesday. Many stopped to remember the victims 
of the latest tragedy where young children trapped in an aging orphanage 
perished in a fatal blaze. Investigators say it will take weeks to 
determine the cause of the fire. But officials of the Philippine bureau 
of fire protection announced Tuesday that the chief of the fire station 
near the orphanage was suspended along with 18 other firemen. No reason 
was given, but news reports said the firefighters arrived late at 
the scene. As the Philippine government rushes to assign the blame 
for last week's fire, firemen are saying that the bureau itself is 
in need of change. The union representing firemen is saying that lives 
would have been saved had funding allocated for rescue equipment been 
properly spent, and they want those in charge of these funds to be 
held accountable. Philippine President Joseph Estrada has said that 
those responsible in the fire department will face charges in court. 
The presidential palace is not too far away from where the orphanage 
stood, and Mr. Estrada has long been a champion of the poor. In this 
fire, many of the victims were not orphans, but children left in a 
Night care Shelter these parents had thought safe. But the 83-year-old 
building was no match for the hungry flames that took their lives. 
One by one, the coffins were along with a Christmas gift for each 
of the victims. In a plot donated by the city of Manila, 19 of them 
will stay as a memorial to a tragic fire that is hoped will be the 
last to take so many from those who loved them. Mike Cohen, Manila,
