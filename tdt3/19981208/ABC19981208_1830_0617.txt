Elsewhere in the world today the north Korean military establishment 
said it was determined to anile ate what it calls U.S. impeeralists, 
Japanese reactionaries and south Korean puppets. If the U.S. were 
not also worried about a north Korean nuclear program they cannot 
get a good look at. Here's ABC's John McWethy. Satellite images of 
the northern part of north Korea, intelligence sources say, leave 
little doubt that a massive underground nuclear project is now under 
construction. That would be a Gross violation of the promise north 
Korea made four years ago, to shut down its nuclear program in exchange 
for billions of dollars in aid from the U.S., Japan and south Korea. 
It sounds a lot like Iraq. The U.S. is demanding that international 
inspectors be given access to the underground construction site. North 
Korea says only for a price, $300 million to take a look. And, as 
is the case with Iraq, the U.S. views north Korea as a potential threat 
to its neighbors and the world. But in many ways, north Korea, with 
its fanatical, unpredictable leadership, may be even more dangerous. 
I think that you simply have to take absolutely every precaution. 
They could do something absolutely nuts. And if a regime like north 
Korea adds a missile that can hit the U.S., which it is working on, 
and nuclear weapons, the implications are terrifying. John McWethy, 
ABC News, the Pentagon.
