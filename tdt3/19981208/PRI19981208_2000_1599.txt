The market seemed to approve the sale announced today of IBM's Internet 
and data processing divisions to AT&T. Liz George of our business 
unit in New York, has the details. The announcement made today adds 
a million new Internet customers to AT&T's already large user base, 
as well as thousands of companies, which are linked by data processing 
systems around the world. In return, IBM will handle jobs such as 
billing and installation for AT&T long distance phone users. In one 
of the biggest outsourcing deals ever. Speaking at a press conference 
in New York, AT&T's chairman and chief executive, Mike Armstrong, 
said the acquisition secures his company's position as a world leader. 
This transaction will add $2.5 billion to AT&T's revenue in the first 
full year of operation. The two companies say that no job losses are 
anticipated as a result of the deal. But employees will be swapped. 
Five thousand IBM employees will move to AT&T and 2,000 AT&T staff 
will go to IBM. The chairman and chief executive of IBM, Lewis Gersner, 
says the sale will enable this company to concentrate on what it does 
best. Almost every major telecommunications company is building IP-based 
digital networks. We do not want to compete with our customers. And 
it does not make sense for us to make that kind of investment when 
the telecommunications companies, whose core competency it is, are 
going to make that investment. And so we decided to sell our network. 
The sale is expected to be completed by mid-1999. If approved by U.S. 
and foreign regulators. For The World, I am Liz George in New York.
