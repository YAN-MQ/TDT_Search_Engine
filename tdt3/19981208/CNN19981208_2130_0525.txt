Your cable Bill probably will go up again next year. The head of the 
national cable television association says rates could rise 4% to 
5% when they're deregulated at the end of March. Cable prices have 
gone up an average of 7% over the past year. The industry attributes 
the coming price hike to rising costs for labor, programming and upgrading 
cable systems.
