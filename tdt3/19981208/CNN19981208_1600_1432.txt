The FBI has opened its files on Frank Sinatra. In addition to facts, 
the nearly 1,300 pages include a number of unproven allegations about 
the singer. Among them, that he had ties to the communist party and 
that he dodged the draft during world war II. The file also includes 
Sinatra's mug shot from his arrest in 1938 on seduction charges. And 
there's information on a death threat Sinatra received in 1969.
