In a moment, the charity ball. It's no mystery why millions of people 
have moved... to the digital home entertainment of directv. - Ha-ha! 
- because directv gives them more movies, sports... and a variety 
of programming they just can't get from cable. So what are you looking 
at? If it's not directv, see your retailer for a demo today. I work 
out to keep my body in shape. To help keep my mind sharp I take NEWr 
uanterra ginkgo biloba. It helps me concentrate, maintain focus. Why 
quanterra? All ginkgos aren't the same. The patented quanterra extract 
was proven safe and effective by doctors in extensive clinical trials. 
And it increases oxygen supply to the brain. With new quanterra mental 
sharpness I feel my best, naturally.
