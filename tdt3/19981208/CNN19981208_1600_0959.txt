Two of the nation's best known companies are forming an alliance. 
I'm Jan Hopkins with this edition of "Dollars & Sense." AT&T is buying 
IBM's global networking business for $5 billion in cash. As part of 
the deal, IBM is also granting AT&T a five-year $5 billion contract 
to handle most of IBM's networking needs. In exchange, AT&T will outsource 
some data management work to IBM. Some 5,000 IBM employees are expected 
to join AT&T to help run it.
