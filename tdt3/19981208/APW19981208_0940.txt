Teachers dart uneasy glances out windows of the bullet-pocked school, 
scanning the road for the feared police. Camouflage-clad rebels hunch 
behind nearby bushes. Schoolbooks have been destroyed. Tense Kosovo, 
where a precarious truce feels like intermission in a horror movie, 
is hardly a suitable environment for education. But numerous villages 
are marking small triumphs across the devastated province, reopening 
war-damaged schools as they move to restore some normalcy to shattered 
lives. ``It's the first good event in our lives in several months,'' 
says Avni Hoxha, a 33-year-old ethnic Albanian arriving to pick up 
his two children from the battered school building where classes resumed 
in the southwestern Kosovo village of Blace last week. ``Children 
must go to school. They need an education.'' The ethnic Albanians 
say 56 schools were ruined, many others damaged and still others abandoned 
in the panic to flee Serbian forces during this year's punishing campaign 
against Kosovo Albanian separatists. Serb children, too, have suffered 
from safety fears and relocation during the conflict in the Serbian 
province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber them by roughly 10 to 1. 
But the overwhelming majority of the hundreds of people killed, and 
schools wrecked, were ethnic Albanian. As tens of thousands of refugees 
cautiously return home in the wake of an October peace agreement, 
getting schools back in operation has become a top priority. Decani, 
Rastane and Blace are among those that have reopened theirs in the 
past few days, with safety assurances from international peace verifiers. 
``It's a heartening thing,'' said American Brett Mattei, standing 
alongside one of the monitors' Day-Glo orange Humvees after consulting 
with local leaders on reopening a school in central Kosovo. ``It shows 
villagers are feeling more confident, more secure.'' Blace (pronounced 
BLAHT-say), located just off the Pristina-Prizren highway that police 
and rebels battled over so fiercely, stood empty for four months until 
residents who had fled to forests or other homes began trickling back 
in late October. More than 100 houses were deemed wrecked beyond repair. 
Hasty repairs were made to get the school up and running despite a 
bashed-in roof and no electricity in the village of 6,000. Rain leaks 
into unusable classrooms, loose wires hang down, and wooden beams 
and tree limbs are used to prop up the jerry-rigged roof. With only 
four rooms in use, the 600 children attend class in three shifts, 
from 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. Emotional scars reflect those left by 
machine-gun bullets on the faded green outer walls. In Shqipe Bllaca's 
second-grade class, where war trauma is etched in the children's drawn 
faces, pupils and teacher shared painful war experiences on the first 
day back in school. One girl wept as she talked about all the burned 
houses, Bllaca recalled. Others have 15 or 20 people living in their 
homes. Eight-year-old Albina Kroni, gazing with big brown eyes, struggles 
for words when asked to recount her family's situation for visitors. 
``I was three months out of my home and my village, and I moved to 
three other villages,'' she says solemnly. ``I missed my home.'' The 
village already was poor before the conflict began. The schoolroom 
walls are bare and dirty, and there are no books. The children's homework 
assignment won't be easy: Find a notebook and a pen. Teachers haven't 
been paid their monthly salary of 100 German marks (dlrs 60) in five 
months. Two are in jail, suspected by Serb police of ties to the Kosovo 
Liberation Army. And there's only enough wood on hand to keep the 
school stoves burning for two weeks. But Bllaca, who wears a parka 
to ward off the classroom chill, says the children and teachers are 
still glad to be back. ``I don't worry about our difficult conditions 
in school,'' the 32-year-old teacher says. ``I worry about our difficult 
conditions in general.'' ``I worry about peace for our children.'' 
There's no sense that peace is at hand just yet. On the school playground, 
boys sing songs about the KLA and play war games. They dream of becoming 
rebel fighters, and sometimes flash victory signs as armored Serb 
police cars rumble past on patrol. For now, parents and teachers take 
satisfaction in the achievement of having started classes again. They 
know there's no way to keep the war atmosphere outside school walls. 
``It's our reality,'' says Muhamet Bajraktari, the school's principal. 
``They can't escape it.''
