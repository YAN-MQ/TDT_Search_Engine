Finally tonight -- a lesson in leadership. In most cities, no one 
knows the school superintendent -- unless something goes wrong. That's 
not true in Seattle. Things have been going right, and the superintendent, 
John Stanford has received much of the credit. But now, things have 
gone wrong for him. He has leukemia. Here's ABC's Judy Muller. Wherever 
John Stanford goes, he is treated like a hero. The retired army general, 
hired just three years ago, is credited with taking an ailing school 
system and, against overwhelming odds, making it well again. Now, 
Stanford is the one who is ailing. After two rounds of chemotherapy 
and a bone marrow transplant, he, too, faces overwhelming odds. Never 
give up. Never give up! Never give up! Superintendents are usually 
distant bureaucrats, as far as kids are concerned. Not here. How many 
people here know who John Stanford is? Let me see your hands. By now, 
they all know the story, how the general with no educational background 
was hired to shake things up. I will fight for these children till 
hell freezes over. And when hell freezes over, I will fight on the 
ice. Students must now pass exit exams to be promoted. Test scores 
are up, violence down. And private corporations are now donating millions 
of dollars to the public schools. I never in my life met anyone who 
can galvanize a city the way he has. And now the city is trying to 
give something back. Citizens have raised more than $500,000 for a 
book fund in Stanford's name. One group of students raised money with 
a 2,000-mile bike trip. It's, man, like, if he's struggling, why do 
I make excuses for myself? He doesn't just sit behind his desk and 
tell other people to do stuff. He goes out and actually does it. And 
he's still doing his job, even if not at full speed. He's aware that 
the kids are watching. If I gave up, if I didn't use every option 
available to me, they would know it. And there it is. Their leader 
gave up. Why should we try? Not to worry. "Surrender" is not in the 
man's vocabulary. I am not going to let cancer control my life. I 
mean, it's not something I'm going to sit around and think about every 
day. After all, says Stanford, he still has all those kids to think 
about. Judy Muller, ABC News, Seattle.
