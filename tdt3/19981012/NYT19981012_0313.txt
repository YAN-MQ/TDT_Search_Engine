The opening of the film ``Beloved'' this week has drawn extraordinary 
attention in Hollywood _ and not just because the movie was adapted 
from a Pulitzer-Prize winning novel by Toni Morrison, was directed 
by an Academy Award-winning director, Jonathan Demme, and stars the 
queen of daytime television, Oprah Winfrey, who also produced it. 
What rivets Hollywood is whether the most expensive film yet to deal 
with the black experience will appeal broadly to white as well as 
black moviegoers. Without quite admitting it, virtually every studio 
in town has been increasingly reluctant in recent years to bankroll 
serious films about racial issues, because audiences _ white and, 
in many cases, black as well _ have often not shown up at theaters. 
The result is that ``Beloved,'' a drama of nearly three hours about 
the horrific legacy of slavery, is viewed in Hollywood as almost a 
test case of whether studios will continue to finance the handful 
of serious films each year on black themes. The thinking is that if 
this film, given its pedigree, blanket marketing campaign and potential 
attraction to women, can't make it, how many can? The film, underwritten 
by Walt Disney Co., cost at least $53 million, with an estimated $30 
million more budgeted to promote it. Ms. Winfrey, who is using her 
considerable influence among women to sell the film, has called it 
``my `Schindler's List.''' Asked if she was worried about the box 
office for ``Beloved,'' she responded: ``I'm not as concerned as probably 
a lot of marketers would be. I work every day in a business where 
I'm able to cross over.'' As to why white audiences are simply not 
showing up at so-called serious black films, Ms. Winfrey echoed the 
views of many Hollywood executives. ``I don't think they want to feel 
they're going to be blamed'' for the characters' predicaments, she 
said, which are often the product of racist behavior by whites. In 
the eyes of many in the film industry, it is hard to attract large 
audiences to serious films of any sort. The big studios' record of 
producing such fare has not been overwhelming, particularly in the 
face of pressure to churn out movies that open strongly, rather than 
build slowly on word of mouth, and that appeal to teen-agers. The 
travails of black films with significant budgets and subject matter 
hardly stand out from those of serious films in general, some longtime 
Hollywood executives said, and a few serious black films _ those geared 
particularly to women _ have performed solidly. ``I don't think it's 
about black films or audiences,'' said Mike De Luca, president of 
production at New Line Cinema, which has been successful in backing 
films dealing with black issues. ``It's true for audiences in general. 
You go to the movies to be entertained. It's hard to market a so-called 
serious film that looks like you might not have such a great time 
sitting through it.'' Privately, though, some top Hollywood producers 
and executives said studios were particularly wary of backing serious 
movies on black themes, particularly those films with significant 
budgets geared to a broadly based adult audience. One reason is that 
these films, even successful releases like ``Waiting to Exhale,'' 
often fail to make money abroad. ``They're like baseball films,'' 
said one successful producer who has worked in Hollywood for years. 
Many movies may earn at least 60 percent of their box office abroad. 
(Films with black themes, however, often have strong video sales.) 
Another reason for the lack of support _ one that executives and exhibitors 
are uncomfortable discussing _ is that violent episodes at a handful 
of theaters showing hard-edged films about urban gangs have apparently 
made some whites reluctant to attend such movies. Compounding the 
problem is the resistance among some white moviegoers to any film 
with a black theme. Because of the sporadic violence, said one top 
executive with a studio that has produced films on black themes, ``it's 
much harder now to get a white audience to see a black movie than 
it was 10 years ago.'' Speaking on the condition of anonymity, he 
added, ``I'm not endorsing it, I'm not enjoying it, it's not right, 
but that's the fact.'' The filmmaker Spike Lee put it another way. 
Lee said he was surprised recently to read about the baseball team 
from Toms River, N.J., that won the Little League World Series. ``Every 
one of these middle-class suburban white kids said their favorite 
music was Snoop Dogg, Wu-Tang Clan and Puff Daddy _ music has been 
able to do the crossover thing and not films,'' he said. ``It's easier 
for a large part of the white audience to listen than to watch black 
faces in movies, particularly when it's not comedic.'' Without white 
audiences, many films dealing with African-American issues cannot 
survive at the box office. But Lee observed that black audiences often 
do not show up for serious black films either. ``It's been very rare 
where African-American films that aren't comedies draw an audience 
_ even an African-American audience,'' he said. The audience has to 
be educated about serious fare, he said. ``I cannot tell you why a 
large segment of African-Americans would rather see `Booty Call' than 
`Rosewood' or `He Got Game,''' he added. ``I don't know.'' Another 
black director, Carl Franklin, said African-Americans were hardly 
alone in avoiding films that touch on their history or their lives. 
``Unfortunately there seems to be among the American public a disinterest, 
an apathy, about almost anything that has a serious subject matter,'' 
said Franklin, who recently directed ``One True Thing,'' the mother-daughter 
drama starring Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger. Despite strong reviews, 
it has been a box-office disappointment. Several of Lee's critically 
respected films, like ``He Got Game'' ``Clockers,'' and ``Get on the 
Bus,'' stumbled at the box office. The same was true of Franklin's 
``Devil in a Blue Dress,'' as well as John Singleton's ``Rosewood'' 
(about the destruction of a black community in Florida in the 1920s 
by white marauders) and Steven Spielberg's ``Amistad.'' And the recent 
failure of the film ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' the story of Frankie 
Lymon, a black singer of the doo-wop era, led Warner Bros. to shelve 
``Dreamgirls,'' the film adaptation of the Broadway show based loosely 
on the rise of the Supremes.) One of the biggest disappointments was 
the lack of drawing power of ``Amistad,'' the much heralded drama 
about a real-life slave uprising. It grossed only $44 million, according 
to Exhibitor Relations Co. Several black filmmakers said bluntly that 
the subject matter did not appeal to white audiences and that black 
audiences were not intrigued by a story in which two white stars, 
Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams and Matthew McConaughey as the 
lawyer Roger Baldwin, save and emancipate the slaves. Not every serious 
film fails. Movies as varied as ``The Color Purple,'' ``Waiting to 
Exhale'' and ``Soul Food,'' all aimed at black women, have been highly 
successful, partly because audiences have returned a second time to 
see them. John Singleton's ``Boyz N the Hood,'' the 1991 drama about 
life in a South-Central Los Angeles neighborhood, was arguably the 
best, and most highly imitated, movie about urban violence in recent 
years. The film cost only $7 million and grossed $56 million. (Characterizing 
the success or failure of a film hinges, of course, on its cost and 
studio expectations for it.) In some ways, ``Beloved'' is an atypical 
film about the black experience because of its pedigree _ its adaptation 
from the Pulitzer Prize novel by Ms. Morrison, a Nobel laureate; its 
direction by Demme, who won an Oscar for his 1991 film, ``The Silence 
of the Lambs,'' and, most important, its personal promotion by Ms. 
Winfrey. Without her involvement, ``Beloved'' probably would not have 
been produced. As Terry Curtin, the publicity chief at Walt Disney, 
said: ``We have the Oprah Winfrey show; a `20-20' segment; we have 
11 magazine covers, all Oprah except for two; we have Oprah and Danny 
Glover and the cast doing a full press junket; we have multiple segments 
on the `Today' show and `Good Morning, America''; we have `Regis and 
Kathie Lee'; we have Leno; we have an A&AMP;E biography on Oprah; 
we have two major premieres in New York and L.A.'' Ms. Curtin added, 
``Oprah is the key.'' Ms. Winfrey said she was overwhelmed after reading 
the poetic and sorrowful 1987 Morrison novel about a mysterious former 
slave named Sethe struggling to shape her life in Ohio in 1873, eight 
years after the end of the Civil War. ``I never experienced a book 
like that,'' said Ms. Winfrey, who plays Sethe in the film. ``I felt 
a rumbling inside myself. I looked at the book jacket, and there was 
Toni Morrison's face and I called her up and said, `What was that?''' 
Like the book, the movie is undeniably bleak and has several horrific 
images of brutality toward slaves. Ms. Winfrey had some disagreements 
with Disney about the marketing campaign. ``I felt strongly that people 
needed to be prepared for the kind of movie they were about to see,'' 
she said. Early trailers showed ``beautiful images with the musical 
score underneath,'' Ms. Winfrey said, adding: ``That was not enough. 
You needed some dialogue to explain what it is you're going to see.'' 
While Disney is hardly seeking to mute the slavery theme, the studio 
is also hoping to lure white audiences, especially women, by focusing 
on the movie's Oscar potential as well as its story of a mother's 
desperate love for her children. ``It's a movie about slavery but 
also about women, and to what end a woman will go to protect her children 
from being enslaved,'' said Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. 
``It's an anthem movie for women.'' For decades studios often struggled 
with the promotion of films about race by separately focusing on white 
and black audiences. Thomas Cripps, who has written several influential 
books about the depiction of blacks in films, including ``Slow Fade 
to Black'' and ``Making Movies Black,'' said that studios through 
the 1950s had separate advertising campaigns for films for the black 
press and the general circulation press. For the classic 1950 film 
``No Way Out,'' directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a violent tale of 
racial hatred that marked the debut of Sidney Poitier, advertisements 
in predominantly black newspapers played up scenes dealing with ominous 
race confrontation, Cripps said. ``In white newspapers,'' he said, 
``that was never mentioned _ what was played up was introducing Poitier 
and upbeat images and the challenge of integration.'' De Luca of New 
Line Films, which made the current hit ``Rush Hour'' and such gritty 
movies as ``Menace II Society,'' which cost $3 million and grossed 
$28 million, said he was often content to back films intended to appeal 
overwhelmingly to a black audience. ``We don't necessarily design 
films to cross over, if they're made by black filmmakers for black 
audiences,'' he said. ``Our films are designed to survive in a marketplace 
even if there's no crossover.'' But several producers and studios 
have recently sought to expand their audience by blurring the racial 
line in films. Doug McHenry, who produced such films as the financially 
successful urban drama ``New Jack City'' and who directed ``Jason's 
Lyric,'' about two black brothers at war with each other, said it 
was crucial that the promotion and music for films with black themes 
embrace a wide audience. ``I'm a black filmmaker, but I'm making Chinese 
food,'' he said. ``I want everyone to eat it. You've got to design 
a product that says you're invited as opposed to one that says you're 
excluded.'' In the advertising material for ``New Jack City,'' for 
example, the main black actors in the film _ Wesley Snipes, Ice T 
and Chris Rock _ were joined by, among others, Judd Nelson, a white 
actor. The modestly budgeted movie grossed $47.6 million. ``We were 
also sure that we had pop music as well as music that was on the charts 
of black stations,'' McHenry said. ``It was a predominantly African-American 
cast, but the appeal was to young males, white and black, and what 
we said, in effect, was this was an action crime drama on the streets 
of Harlem and we're going to let you in on a fascinating subculture.'' 
For ``Beloved,'' Disney is hoping for as broadly based an audience 
as possible. ``I don't believe it will be divided along race lines,'' 
said Roth, the studio's chairman. ``But is that a challenge? Sure 
it is.''
