NATIONAL FORECAST A cold front will move through the East on Tuesday. 
Although initially rather dry, the front will quickly moisten, spreading 
a band of clouds and broken showers eastward from the eastern Great 
Lakes. A few rumbles of thunder are also possible, as a potent jet 
stream disturbance pivots across the Northeast. While rain may fall 
hard for a time, amounts will generally be below one-half inch Tuesday. 
Isolated showers will precede the front in the Middle Atlantic states. 
However, the front's passage will be marked by little more than a 
shift in the wind direction in the Tennessee Valley and Deep South. 
Across Florida, seasonable warmth and humidity will continue, with 
widely separated thundershowers developing, mostly over the south. 
Gusty, chilly breezes from the northwest will prevail over the upper 
Middle West. A conveyor belt of moist air will cause clouds and pockets 
of showers to persist near the northern Great Lakes, where temperatures 
will average more than 8 degrees below normal. Farther west, readings 
will hold in the 40s over the Northern Plains despite intervals of 
sunshine. A complex frontal system will cross the Rockies. Given that 
moisture is lacking, most places will be dry with only patchy clouds. 
But the atmosphere will gradually moisten over the western Plains, 
as winds from the east ascend the sloping terrain. The Pacific Northwest 
will be unsettled, as winds blow onshore. Showers will fall along 
the coast as well as along west-facing mountain slopes. Initially 
high snow levels will fall below 6,000 feet later Tuesday night. Focus: 
Wet Siege Over 10 inches of rain doused Portland, Maine, from Thursday 
to Sunday, with 5.61 inches falling just on Saturday. The latter total 
made October 10, 1998, the fifth wettest day in Portland since records 
began in 1871. The deluge in eastern New England was caused by a slow-moving 
low-pressure system, which continually drew Atlantic moisture inland, 
thus fueling protracted rains. October is, on average, one of the 
driest months. But growing temperature contrasts between the Arctic 
and Tropics can energize potent low pressure systems, which, when 
stalled, can produce very heavy rains.
