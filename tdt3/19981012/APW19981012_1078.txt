As NATO stood ready to approve airstrikes, a top U.S. envoy left marathon 
talks with Slobodan Milosevic on Monday to brief the alliance amid 
reports a breakthrough was near that would avert airstrikes over Kosovo. 
Richard Holbrooke's mission to Brussels, Belgium, came with Western 
nations evacuating diplomats from Yugoslavia _ adding to a sense that 
a last-minute deal was necessary to avoid intervention. Russian Defense 
Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in Moscow that the Yugoslav 
president had agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to monitor 
compliance with U.N. demands to halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo. 
If true, that would represent a key last-minute concession by Milosevic 
that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the attack against 
Milosevic's forces. There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic's 
reported concession. But a statement from Milosevic's office said 
Holbrooke would return and hold more talks Tuesday. It said Milosevic 
``has concluded that undoubtedly, necessary conditions exist for a 
peaceful political solution to the Kosovo problem'' _ a position that 
Western officials previously have disputed. In the Kosovo capital 
Pristina, a senior ethnic Albanian leader said that if Milosevic agrees 
to such a force, it could ``provide a way out of the Kosovo crisis 
without further war. ``If Milosevic really accepts an international 
monitoring force, it would create a position of equilibrium in which 
the two sides can then negotiate,'' said Fehmi Agani, head of the 
ethnic Albanian team set up to negotiate with Belgrade authorities.
