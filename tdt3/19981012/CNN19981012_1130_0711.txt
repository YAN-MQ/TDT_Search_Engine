Reading, writing and a bowl of cereal. Educators and researchers say 
students starting the school day with breakfast get better grades 
and are better behaved. A recent study of public school children revealed 
those who ate breakfast generally had higher grades in math, were 
less depressed, anxious and hyperactive and were more likely to attend 
class and show up on time. Oftentimes, you see it evidenced, not just 
in morning illnesses and headaches, but in temper tantrums, in disrupting 
the class. The survey seems to support what teachers have been saying 
for years, that students who come to school hungry suffer, which can 
affect others.
