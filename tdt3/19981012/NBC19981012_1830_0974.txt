The most recent FBI figures show about 8,800 hate crimes are committed 
each year. What causes someone to turn on another human being with 
such anger and hate? We continue our "in depth" reporting with NBC's 
Pete Williams. Hate crime incidents -- Scott britt was a member of 
a Aaron nation group for seven years. He knows people who beat up 
gays for bragging rights. Some do it to earn red laces, which is a 
symbol of them shedding blod for their race. But surprisingly, experts 
say, nearly all hate crimes, about nine out of ten, are not committed 
by members of organized hate groups. They're young people, often acting 
spontaneously. Most hate crime offenders, about 80%, are white men. 
In more than half the cases, they're young, less than 23 years old. 
And the majority of crimes are committed by youthful thrill seekers, 
not hardcore haters. Researchers say anti-gay attackers are especially 
brutal, like these Texas men convicted in the killing of a gay man 
a year and a half ago, who was stabbed 30 times. A hate crime scholar 
says when young people attack in groups, they can be savage, acting 
like a mob, fueled by hate and unable to stop. There's no end to the 
violence. With other crimes, you get someone's wallet or chain or 
their car, and they leave. With hate crimes, the violence just escalates, 
without end. And some offenders attack for a different reason, in 
response to what they view as a threat, like racial integration of 
the neighborhood or, in the case of anti-gay violence, a perceived 
sexual advance. There's even a name for it, homosexual panic defense, 
arguing that an unwanted advance triggers uncontrollable rage. But 
it doesn't often work in court. Pete Williams, NBC news, Washington.
