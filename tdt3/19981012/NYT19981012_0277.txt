How well do doctors follow directions? Not very well, apparently, 
when it comes to a standard practice followed by medical journals. 
Traditionally, editors of scientific publications have called on experts, 
or peers, to review the findings submitted for publication to check 
on the methods that researchers used to justify their conclusions. 
Each publication has its own set of directions for reviewers. But 
it seems that many reviewers rely on their own criteria without reading 
what editors ask them to. Dr. Roy M. Pitkin, the editor of Obstetrics 
and Gynecology, in Los Angeles, long suspected that reviewers ignored 
the editors' instructions. So he inserted this sentence in the letter 
his journal sent to 122 reviewers: ``If you have read this, call or 
fax our office, we will give you a gift worth $20.'' Only 21 reviewers, 
or 17 percent, claimed the gift, a long-distance phone card, said 
Pitkin, who published his findings in The New England Journal of Medicine, 
which also uses peer review. Among the first-time reviewers, the rate 
was even lower, at 10 percent, Pitkin said. Does it mean scientists 
are not paying attention? Some aren't so sure, suggesting instead 
that it is all in the incentives. Perhaps, among eminent obstetricians, 
$20 just isn't worth the effort. One respondent thought that claiming 
the reward would be worthwhile and gave the phone card to his daughter 
at college. But Pitkin laughed and said the obstetrician later told 
him that the daughter ``still hasn't called home.''
