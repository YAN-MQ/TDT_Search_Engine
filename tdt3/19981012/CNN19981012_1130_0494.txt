This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News" weather 
forecast. A cold front moving into the northwest will keep some rain 
in that area. A cold front will also drop into the southeast, but 
there won't be much rain involved, although we'll see showers moving 
from the northern plains across the Great Lakes with perhaps some 
snow mixed in. Some showers will also occur across Florida today. 
High temperatures will range from 40s and 50s through the north-central 
United States to 80s and 90s across the south. Looking ahead to Wednesday 
-- look for some rain across the north-central part of the country 
with rain in the northeast and northwest as well. On Thursday, most 
of the rain will be from the northwest into the northern Rockies with 
some thunderstorms in Florida. Highs will range from the 40s and 50s 
in the north to mostly 80s across the south. Then on Friday, most 
of the wet weather moves to the north-central United States. We'll 
see 40s and 50s in the northern Rockies again to some 80s across the 
south.
