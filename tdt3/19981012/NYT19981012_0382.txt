David Wells' idol, the esteemed George Herman Ruth, once tried to 
fight a couple of opposing players. Asked about it later, the Babe 
said he didn't mind being called a blankety-blank or a bleepety-bleep; 
he just didn't like it when they got personal. So you see, there have 
always been standards in baseball. It just happens that the standards 
keep getting lower. Wells said he heard adults and children in Cleveland 
making remarks about his late mother on Sunday evening, and that made 
him so angry, he beat the Indians without his good stuff. ``Any fan 
who reads the papers,'' Wells said, perhaps referring to an enlightened 
minority, ``knows I buried my mother.'' The fans who read, or absorb 
the information flying through the airwaves, may also know that Wells 
has great devotion for the way his mother raised him in a Hell's Angels 
milieu. Very little is sacred these days. (``Life in the 90s,'' said 
Chili Davis of the Yankees. ``I hear words on television I never used 
to hear.'') As the Yankees and the Indians go into the sixth game 
Tuesday night, it would be nice if Yankee fans showed a little couth 
and just called the Indians the usual scatological mix without, as 
the Babe put it, getting personal. But I wouldn't expect it, not in 
Yankee Stadium, not Tuesday night. ``I go way back with David, all 
the way to Venezuela on the same winter ball team,'' David Justice 
of the Indians said at a news conference Monday. ``When he said it, 
it hurt me, too, because the loss of a mother will hurt everybody 
in this room deeply when it happens to you.'' Justice added: ``I hated 
that he had to go through that. But I mean, come on now. We are talking 
about the Yankee fans. I have heard everything about my mother, everything 
about my history, too.'' His ``history'' includes a stormy divorce 
from the actress Halle Berry, now memorialized in the chant, ``Hal-le, 
Ber-ry,'' that wafts from the Yankee Stadium stands, almost as good 
as the classic Potvin Chant in Madison Square Garden. Come to think 
of it, the Yankees are not necessarily immune from Bronx viciousness, 
either. The players have legitimate concerns about whether the fans 
will still remember Chuck Knoblauch's mental freeze last Wednesday 
that allowed a vital run to score. The fans were booing Knoblauch 
when he batted in the bottom of that 12th inning, and that was before 
they were primed by all-screech radio and tabloid headlines that called 
him a ``Blauch Head.'' Now that the Yankees are back in command, the 
fans may be forgiving, but Tino Martinez raised the issue Monday: 
``The guy's played his butt off and he made one mistake, although 
granted it came at a bad time. He showed great character in dealing 
with it. They should get behind him, and give him more confidence.'' 
Knoblauch wouldn't bite Monday when a troublemaker asked if his old 
fans in Minnesota would have given him a warm reception in a similar 
situation. He didn't want to inflame the locals, and who can blame 
him? ``But Yankee fans, everybody in this room knows how rough they 
can be,'' Justice said Monday. ``So they can't get any rougher on 
us unless they show up with Uzis.'' New Yorkers' vocal cords could 
be legally categorized as lethal weapons. Wells, who grew up a Yankee 
fan out of sheer perversity in San Diego, recalls his first trip to 
the Stadium as a member of the Blue Jays. ``Greatest feeling walking 
into the ball park,'' Wells recalled Monday. ``Then I started pitching, 
and they really got bad. Abusive. I said, `Who needs this stuff?' 
Then I said, `Hey, that's cool.''' Wells understands that the fans 
just want to help. He said the Justice chant is ``a different situation. 
Dave understands. She's a celebrity.'' Justice came close to agreeing 
with that assessment. ``I'm an eye-for-an-eye guy,'' Wells continued. 
``The fans should try to ride the stuffing out of the Indians. But 
they shouldn't throw things, or yell things at players' wives, which 
some people did in Cleveland.'' David Cone, who pitches Tuesday night, 
said: ``It is kind of ironic to hear Yankee players talking about 
opposing fans. I don't know what was said on a personal note, and 
there is no place for that in any ball park, but they have an incredible 
run going on there with all the sellouts, and the way they support 
their team.'' Yankee fans make up in detail and volume what they lack 
in numbers. They will surely be prodding the Indians for any weaknesses, 
which is fine, as long as they don't get personal.
