The World Trade Organization has ruled that steps taken by the United 
States to protect endangered turtles, countervenes global rules on 
free trade. But in an unprecedented decision, the WTO endorsed the 
country's right to adapt laws to protect endangered species, and preserve 
the environment. The WTO's appeal body said, a US ban on shrimp imports 
from India, Pakistan, Thailand and Malaysia were unjustifiable and 
arbitrary.
