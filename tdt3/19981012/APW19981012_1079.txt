Israel will early Tuesday ease the blockade of the Palestinian areas 
which it imposed October 2, the army spokesman announced Monday. As 
from 2 a.m. (midnight gmt) Tuesday, 21,000 Palestinian workers from 
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will be allowed to go to their jobs 
in Israel, the spokesman said. The total closure has been in force 
with brief respites for 22 days, since the beginning of the Jewish 
holiday period. It was imposed after Israeli security services warned 
that the Islamic Hamas group planned to carry out a major suicide 
bomb attack or kidnap an Israeli soldier in retaliation for the killing 
of two of its leaders by Israeli special forces. Hamas has carried 
out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel since 1994, killing 
scores of Israelis. The Israeli closures cause extensive economic 
hardship in the Palestinian areas where unemployment is high. Before 
it was imposed on Sept. 20, about 60,000 Palestinians had permits 
to work in Israel. Palestinian leaders have condemned the closures 
as collective punishment.
