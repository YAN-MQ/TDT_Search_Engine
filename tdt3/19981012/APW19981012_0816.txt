In launching an air attack on Yugoslavia, NATO would face an armed 
force that is still the largest in the region despite the crippling 
effects of years of embargo. The chief threat likely would come from 
mobile air defense systems, some of which reportedly have been upgraded 
recently. Yugoslav fighter planes, while formidable, likely would 
be outmatched by the superior radar and missile systems of Western, 
especially American, air craft, analysts say. ``NATO would prevail 
in an air battle. But the question is, at what cost?'' said Clifford 
Beal, editor of Jane's Defense Weekly in London. Defense analysts 
predicted that NATO likely would first use Tomahawk cruise missiles 
against fixed Yugoslavian air defense systems, and then might send 
B-2 Stealth bombers and F-117 Stealth fighters against mobile air 
defense systems, with subsequent attacks on air bases, command and 
communications systems, tank depots and other military targets. Serb 
forces have a history of fierce resistance to outside attack. In response 
to NATO strikes in 1995, Bosnian Serbs shot down one French Mirage 
2000 with a single SA-7 missile and an American F-16 with a direct 
hit by SA-6. ``The Yugoslavs have formidable air defenses and are 
not going to be a pushover,'' said Dana Alenn of the International 
Institute for Strategic Studies in London. A serious threat to NATO 
warplanes would come from 60 self-propelled surface-to-air SA-12b 
missile systems, along with SA-6 missiles upgraded with new warheads, 
seeking devices and proximity fuses. At airfields and other strategic 
points, Yugoslav air defense deploys large numbers of SA-2, 3, 9, 
10, 11 and 13 missile systems. They also field man-portable, shoulder 
launched SA-7, 14 and 16 missiles. Additionally, the Serbs are reported 
to have acquired a Russian-designed SA-10 anti-aircraft missile, code-named 
Grumble ``that would pose some problems to a coalition air forces,'' 
Beal said. Years after the disintegration of former socialist Yugoslavia, 
Serbia and Montenegro still have a sizable air force, consisting of 
260 aircraft, divided into five fixed-wing brigades and three helicopter 
regiments. The fixed wing element include 16 MiG-29 fighters, of which 
two are MiG-29 UTI training two-seaters unsuitable for combat. These 
planes, purchased from the former Soviet Union in the early 1980s, 
are based at Batajnica Airfield near Belgrade. The Yugoslav version 
of the MiG-29 carries aging electronics and radar, but their superb 
maneuverability and APHID and ACRID air-to-air missiles could threaten 
incoming aircraft. Although the MiG-29s are good in dog fights, their 
radar does not have the range of the U.S. version, and they could 
be sitting ducks. ``U.S. air force would see the Serbs at a far greater 
distance than the Serbs,'' Beal said. ``The pilot could be shot out 
of the sky before he knew he had been seen.'' In addition, there are 
about 60 aging MiG-21 FT and BIS interceptors that also can be thrown 
into the fray. This model dates from the Vietnam and the Mideastern 
conflicts, and likely would not mount serious opposition to NATO warplanes. 
The Yugoslav air force also has about 65 close-support ORAO and 80 
GALEB G4 and G2 aircraft, and other utility planes of various kinds.
