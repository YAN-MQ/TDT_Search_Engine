Police in Jamaica were searching Monday for four Cuban refugees who 
were part of a group of 14 who set out in a boat for Puerto Rico but 
ended up on the north coast of Jamaica instead. Ten of the refugees 
_ three women and seven men _ were apprehended Sunday evening after 
they landed near Hope Bay on the north coast of the island after seven 
days at sea. The other four remain at large. Police said the refugees 
set out from Santiago de Cuba in a 14-foot fishing boat but drifted 
helplessly after their outboard motor failed. The 10 Cubans in custody 
were examined by medical personnel and were in good health, according 
to police. Local and international officials will consider their cases 
and they will be returned to Cuba if they are not granted asylum in 
another country.
