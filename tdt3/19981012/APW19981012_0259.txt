A search team on Russia's Sakhalin Island found a helicopter Monday 
that had caught fire and gone down the day before, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency said. The Mi-2 helicopter was spotted from the air on Sakhalin, 
located off Russia's Pacific coast, after a search team of more than 
130 soldiers, border guards, police and forest rangers began hunting 
for it Monday morning. The helicopter had been inspecting forest fires 
Sunday in a northern part of the island when it caught fire and went 
down, ITAR-Tass said. When the search team arrived they found a note 
from the two crew members saying they had headed to the nearest settlement. 
The crew members were later found, uninjured, ITAR-Tass said. The 
search for the helicopter, which belonged to the Vostok airline, took 
longer than expected because of smoke from forest fires still burning 
out of control in the region, ITAR-Tass said.
