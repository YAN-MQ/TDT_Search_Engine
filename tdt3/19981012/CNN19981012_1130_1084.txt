Meanwhile, Tokyo Disneyland will soon have some competition. Universal's 
first theme park outside of the United States is scheduled to open 
in Osaka, Japan, in the year 2001. The company says it's taking advantage 
of good deals and cheap materials that have resulted from Japan's 
economic slump. The park will feature attractions such as "jurassic 
park: the ride" and "E.T. adventure." Universal expects the park to 
draw 8 million visitors in its first year.
