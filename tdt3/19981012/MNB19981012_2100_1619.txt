Meanwhile, let's get back to today's weather situation. In the current 
situation we find ourselves with a lot of clear sunny skies all the 
way from the carolinas through the west. Texas looking pretty good. 
A little shower activity way down by the Brownsville area. In the 
northwest a touch of rain moving on shore. Rain all the way from Seattle, 
Portland, down through the Portland area. Just starting to move into 
northern California. Temperatures rather seasonal. We have temperatures 
in the upper 30's in north Minnesota. But other than that, we're pretty 
seasonal. Here comes that rain trying to move through southern Texas. 
The east coast was wet in Maine. Southern Florida having a little 
shower activity. E big question is -- the game weather tomorrow for 
the Yankees. Looks like a chance of rain showers. Winds out of the 
southeast about 10 to 15 miles an hour. We find temperatures at this 
hour, would you believe, 94 degrees at the present time in Phoenix. 
The cold 30's in Minnesota. Atlanta not bad now with clear skies and 
66 degrees. New York City at 61. The northwest we've got rain showers 
moving this way.
