In another sign that even cyberspace may not be big enough for all 
of the companies that have sprouted up hoping to profit from the Internet, 
the two largest companies that measure the audience size of World 
Wide Web sites have agreed to merge. Media Metrix, based in New York, 
will take over Relevant Knowledge, its Atlanta-based archrival. Both 
companies are privately held, and the financial terms of the all-stock 
deal were not disclosed. Each company publishes a list of the 25 most 
heavily trafficked Web sites and sells detailed information to advertisers 
and Internet publishers for $50,000 a year and up. But the services 
created as much confusion as insight, because their ratings were often 
vastly different from each other and from the internal measurements 
taken by the Web sites themselves. And with both companies spending 
heavily to install their measurement software on the computers of 
thousands of Internet users, neither has been profitable. ``The more 
we have gotten into this business, the more we understood that neither 
company was going to beat the other into submission,'' said Jeff Levy, 
the chief executive of Relevant Knowledge, who had been steering his 
company toward a public stock offering. ``This would have been a long 
and bloody battle that would not be good for either company or the 
industry.'' The deal comes as other recent mergers suggest that a 
falling market for technology stocks is making success on the Internet 
harder than it once seemed. Last week, Bertelsmann AG agreed to buy 
half of Barnes &AMP; Noble's Internet book store rather than start 
its own. N2K and CDNow, the two largest online music stores, are expected 
to announce a merger soon. As smaller Internet firms merge to remain 
viable and to eliminate competition, a few of the largest online companies 
are using acquisitions to extend their dominance. Monday, for example, 
Yahoo agreed to exchange $29.6 million in stock for Yoyodyne, an Irvington 
company that specializes in e-mail contests and other promotions. 
Jeffery Mallett, Yahoo's chief operating officer, said that the fall 
of tech stocks has created a buyer's market. ``It has brought a lot 
of things to our front door,'' he said. Advertisers and publishers 
alike praised the rating-services merger, saying it would help reduce 
the confusion. ``It was very hard to understand why 10 of the top 
25 sites rated by Media Metrix weren't on Relevant Knowledge's Top 
25 list,'' said Rich Lefurgy, the chairman of Internet Advertising 
Bureau, a trade group. ``By bringing together the two companies we 
will have more credible information.''
