Ask people if they have negative attitudes toward blacks, women or 
the elderly, and you are likely to hear a chorus of denials. But give 
those same individuals a simple test to tap unconscious beliefs, two 
psychologists say, and the results often tell a different story. Prejudice 
can be so pervasive and so deeply rooted that many people are not 
consciously aware of their biases, say Dr. Anthony Greenwald of the 
University of Washington and Dr. Mahzarin Banaji of Yale University, 
developers of the Implicit Associations Test. The test, a series of 
word-pairing tasks, is intended to measure implicit or automatic associations 
to social groups. In one version, subjects are asked to pair random 
combinations of pleasant and unpleasant words _ ``peace'' and ``paradise'' 
versus ``hatred'' and ``violence'' _ with combinations of proper names 
common among white or black Americans _ Brad and Peggy versus Jamal 
and Latisha. Other versions of the test address unconscious assumptions 
about women and older people. Still others focus on self-esteem and 
sex differences in preferences for math or art. Greenwald and Banaji 
and their colleagues have given the test to hundreds of undergraduates, 
including more than 1,000 Yale freshmen this fall. Thousands of other 
people are taking the test on line, by visiting a Web site (www.yale.edu/implicit) 
for the researchers. The site received 50,000 hits in its first week, 
the researchers said. In studies using the race-based version of the 
test, 90 percent of white subjects took longer to pair pleasant words 
with black names and unpleasant words with white names than the other 
way around, a delay the psychologists interpret as an automatic or 
implicit preference for white names. This discrepancy remained significant 
even when the researchers took into account the familiarity of the 
proper names, the order in which the words were presented, whether 
the pleasant words appeared on the right or left side, and other factors 
that might influence the results. Data from black subjects are still 
being collected, but Greenwald says many black people taking the test 
also show a preference for white names, though to a weaker degree. 
While the test may reveal unconscious prejudice, the researchers note 
that no evidence links a person's performance on the test with attitudes 
or behavior in the outside world. ``We like to think of it as an unconsciousness-raising 
tool,'' Banaji said, a tool ``for increasing awareness or self-analysis. 
It should not be used to select individuals for jobs or to select 
a jury.''
