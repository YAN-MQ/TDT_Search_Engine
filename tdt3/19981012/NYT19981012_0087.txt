When Monica Lewinsky poured her heart out to Linda Tripp, she was 
clearly looking for girl talk. Girl talk runs deep. It begins in the 
sandbox, when girls are asked which boy they want to select and boys 
are asked which insect they want to dissect. Encouraged to dissect 
romantic possibilities, women soon find themselves analyzing relationships 
to whomever will listen. They will confide in a pet, a plant, a passing 
mirror, an embittered Pentagon bureaucrat. Men are less inclined toward 
such revelations and also more likely to be congratulated for making 
them. Compare the political sensation of the year, with its miles 
of tape, to the year's literary sensation, ``Birthday Letters,'' a 
slim volume written by Ted Hughes about his dead wife, Sylvia Plath. 
The man kept quiet about his feelings for 35 years, then published 
88 poems _ that's an average of 2.51 poems per year _ and the collection 
was hailed as an eloquent emotional outpouring. Of course, a depressed 
obsessive poet laureate is more likely to get good reviews than a 
depressed obsessive intern, but the double standards here go beyond 
career choice. In 1989 Hughes wrote to Plath's biographer that he 
preferred the rumors fueled by his silence to being ``goaded into 
vomiting up every detail of my life with Sylvia.'' Indeed, men are 
taught at a young age that talking about emotional life is akin to 
vomiting, as Ms. Lewinsky learned when she sought to confide in a 
male friend, Dennis Lytton. He changed the subject and later said: 
``It was kind of shocking. I didn't want to get into it further.'' 
Britain's other publishing sensation of the year, ``Bridget Jones' 
Diary'' by Helen Fielding, gives us a woman who spends five times 
as much time analyzing relationships as having them. The novel's structure 
mirrors that of ``Pride and Prejudice,'' in which Darcy disappears 
for chapters on end while the women discuss him. The ratio of relationship 
analysis to time spent with actual guy, just in terms of pure pages, 
may not approach Ms. Lewinsky's but is heartbreaking still. It's just 
not macho to yammer on about matters of love, unless of course you're 
yammering about your sexual prowess. Booklist praised Dennis Rodman 
for his ``unabashed honesty'' in describing his exploits in ``Bad 
As I Wanna Be.'' But chatting about a woman's sexual escapades, a 
woman's romantic feelings or even their own feelings can make men 
squeamish. Within their own friendships too, men may have a threshold 
for just how many feelings they can stand, as Paul Theroux learned 
when he kept telling his mentor V.S. Naipaul his most honest thoughts 
and Naipaul stopped speaking to him. Since he could not destroy a 
friendship that was already destroyed, Theroux felt liberated to write 
``Sir Vidia's Shadow.'' Worse than talking about feelings is writing 
them down. Claire Bloom did, and her ex-husband, Philip Roth, retaliated 
by turning her into a vindictive fictional character in his next novel. 
Joyce Maynard did too, and her book shows that her relationship with 
J.D. Salinger was obviously doomed. If you're as major a fan of girl 
talk as Ms. Maynard is, it's not a good idea to fall in love with 
a hermit. But girl talk is usually more private than a tell-all book. 
It has secretly taken place for centuries. Shakespeare knew about 
girl talk, and used female collusion as a plot device in ``All's Well 
That Ends Well.'' These days the chatter continues on the phone, at 
the Ritz-Carlton or over martinis in best-sellers like ``Divine Secrets 
of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.'' Girl talk has guidelines. You don't steal 
a man you hear about during girl talk. You don't repeat secrets told 
during girl talk. And you definitely don't tape it. Violating the 
code of women can have disastrous results, as when Scarlett O'Hara 
throws herself at her friend Melanie's husband in ``Gone With the 
Wind.'' Just at the moment you realize who your real friends are, 
the woman who trusted you may die a saintly death and leave behind 
a dull guy and a lifetime of guilt. In modern times, the cynical sacrifice 
of girl talk to scandal politics was first perpetrated by Lynn Armandt, 
who snapped a picture of her friend Donna Rice sitting on Gary Hart's 
lap. She later sold her confidences and photos to People magazine. 
Ms. Rice got to ruin a political career and then was offered modeling 
contracts. Linda Tripp's tapings constitute the ultimate betrayal 
of the code of women. She was supposed to provide compassion, empathy 
and dieting tips; she provided grand jury testimony. You simply don't 
want to be on your deathbed or even on a runway in Milan, modeling 
the latest ``Roma Outsize'' stylings, wondering if you should have 
confided in a more reliable girlfriend. Immunity is nice, but it's 
not friendship.
