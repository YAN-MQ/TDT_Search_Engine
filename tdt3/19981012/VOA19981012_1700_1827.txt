I'm Dave DeForest, VOA News. A top U.S. Balkan envoy is briefing NATO 
officials in Brussels on his talks with Yugoslav president as the 
alliance prepares for air strikes to halt violence in Serbia's Kosovo 
province. Envoy Richard Holbrooke returned to Brussels after a marathon 
series of talks in Belgrade with President Slobodan Milosevic. The 
VOA correspondent in Brussels reports indications are that Mr. Holbrooke 
will present elements of a possible settlement for the conflict. The 
Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug, says the U.S. official will return to 
Belgrade Tuesday for further talks.
