Developing countries are being hampered by tight safeguards from building 
nuclear power plants, nuclear scientists complained Monday, but the 
International Atomic Energy Agency promised to help them build safe 
reactors. Agency representatives at an international conference on 
nuclear power said the IAEA was prepared to play an active role in 
the safe use of nuclear plants to generate electricity in poor countries. 
``Developing countries trying to start nuclear power programs feel 
frightened by safety and threatened by safeguards,'' R. Chidambaram, 
chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission. ``It is the responsibility 
of IAEA that this does not come in the way of the growth of nuclear 
power in developing countries.'' Victor Mourogov, deputy director 
general of IAEA, said nuclear power appealed to countries with large 
populations and fast-growing economies. ``Whether these countries 
will be able to make use of nuclear power ... will depend heavily 
on the extent of international cooperation in financing and technology 
sharing by the industrialized countries,'' Mourogov said. About 65 
scientists were meeting to explore the role of nuclear power in meeting 
the growing electricity demands in developing countries. Among the 
31 countries represented were China, France, Russia, Austria, Indonesia 
and Iran. Mourogov said the demand for nuclear power had stagnated 
in North America and Western Europe after contributing to electricity 
supplies there for the past 40 years. But developing countries in 
Asia find nuclear power an attractive option. Stanley Hatcher, former 
president of the American Nuclear Society, said hurdles must be overcome, 
``because I fervently believe that developing countries are going 
to need nuclear power as part of their energy mix to improve standards 
of living and meet environmental needs.'' Hatcher said the initial 
cost of building a nuclear power plant was the biggest barrier. If 
the cost was prohibitive, not enough nuclear power plants would be 
built to help meet poor nations' energy needs, he said. The conference 
was focusing on regulatory requirements, ways to pay for nuclear power 
programs and technology transfer, organizers said.
