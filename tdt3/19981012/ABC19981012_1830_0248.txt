It is worth noting that these budget debates are about how the government 
spends "your money," which sometimes is in short supply. But somehow 
there always seems to be enough for the pet projects of powerful politicians, 
especially military projects. Here's ABC's John Martin. The yeas are 
369, the nays 43. When Congress passed the defense budget, speaker 
Newt Gingrich blamed President Clinton for failing to ask for enough 
money to keep the military strong. The president can talk about Kosovo 
or Bosnia or Iraq or Korea, but the fact is, we have to pay, pay for 
and strengthen a military force capable of backing up those speeches. 
Gingrich was so concerned he decided to give the bt gone things it 
didn't want. This Bill he is signing contains $464 million to build 
seven C-130 cargo planes. They just happen to be built in his hometown 
of Marietta, Georgia, and that's six more than the Pentagon asked 
for. Gingrich would not talk to us about the planes, but this isn't 
the first time the Pentagon has been ordered to take things. In fact, 
there's even money in the budget this year for a helicopter carrier 
it didn't ask for. But getting back to those planes -- Not only are 
the aircraft added, but the support equipment, the spares, the initial 
spares packages are not. And then we cannot P we are told where to 
put them. One place they are being told to put one new plane is Mississippi, 
the home of Senate majority leader, Trent Lott. The Pentagon has been 
complaining that you and Mr. Gingrich have loaded up the budget with 
C-130s. They've already got 50 more than they need. They're having 
readiness problems and they think you're putting the money in the 
wrong place. We don't build, they don't build C-130s in my district, 
so -- They're gonna give you one. Well, some of them -- one, one, 
one airplane. You know, give me a break. The senator says his state's 
one new plane will track hurricanes. In fact, there are ten new planes 
due for delivery here. The air force did not ask for them either, 
but the money was put in the budgetng replace ten planes which the 
air force says still have five to ten years flying time left. I don't 
think we ought to be spending $400 million for what is essentially 
a pork project for the speaker and for the people who get the airplanes. 
Since 1994, Congress has ordered 20 C-130s the Pentagon did not ask 
for, at a cost of $1 billion. "It's your money." John Martin, ABC 
News, Washington.
