Stocks are posting impressive gains on Wall Street. Investors are 
snapping up blue chips and technology stocks, and that's sending the 
Dow back above the 8000 Mark. With advancing issues outnumbering decliners 
by a better than 3-1 margin. The broader markets are also all in the 
plus column. The NASDAQ composite soaring 62 points. Adding fuel to 
the NASDAQ's fire -- shares of Intel up 1 1/4. No action in the bond 
market today. It's closed for the Columbus day holiday.
