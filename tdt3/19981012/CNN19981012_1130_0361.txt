A Kremlin spokesman says, Russian President Boris Yeltsin is cutting 
short his visit to central Asia because of bronchitis. He is returning 
to Moscow later today from Kazakhstan. Doctors say they're treating 
Yeltsin with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Yesterday, the 
Russian president stumbled at an arrival ceremony in Uzbekistan. Yeltsin 
has had a history of health problems, including a multiple heart bypass 
surgery two years ago.
