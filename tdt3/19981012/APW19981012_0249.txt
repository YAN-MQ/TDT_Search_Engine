Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan 
on Monday to brief him on talks with U.S. officials on breaking the 
deadlock in negotiations with Israel. Arafat was expected to return 
home later Monday after the meeting with Hassan, who is acting as 
regent while King Hussein is receiving cancer treatment in the United 
States. Arafat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are to meet in 
a summit Thursday in Washington hosted by U.S. President Clinton.
