An American alpinist died on the slopes of Mt. Baruntse, the Nepalese 
tourism ministry said Monday. Raoul Willie, a 45-year-old businessman 
from Aspen, Colorado, died on Sunday after suffering from acute high 
altitude pulmonary and cerebral edema near the base camp at 4,300 
meters (14,200 feet). Willie was part of a 12-member group led by 
Richard Jackson, 48, of Basalt, Colorado, that was attempting to climb 
the 7,129 meters high (23,525 feet) Mt. Baruntse. Last week, a Greek 
mountaineer was reported missing on Mt. Dhaulagiri. The autumn mountaineering 
season on the Himalayas began Sept. 1.
