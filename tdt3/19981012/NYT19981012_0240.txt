On a recent Monday night at the New York Sports Club on Wall Street, 
a woman was turned around on the stair climber and stepping backward. 
Nearby, several exercisers were striding on elliptical motion trainers, 
switching the direction of their leg movements from forward to reverse 
and back again every couple of minutes. Both activities are common 
in gyms across the country and evidence of a growing trend: backward 
exercising. Though backward running here and abroad has always attracted 
a fun-loving but small following, including participants in an annual 
backward mile run in New York's Central Park on April Fool's Day, 
exercising in reverse has now shifted into high gear because of the 
popularity of machines like elliptical trainers, stair climbers and 
Spinning bikes that allow exercisers to move backward and forward. 
Despite the increased popularity of the reverse workout, fitness experts 
question whether exercising backward is safe and effective or just 
another fitness fad. Many suspect that it is the latter. ``Ask someone 
why they're exercising backwards and they'll usually tell you they're 
trying to tone their butt and the backs of their legs,'' said Ben 
Gelfand, a physical therapist and author of ``Return to Glory Days'' 
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1997), a primer on athletic injuries. But computer 
analysis indicates that the quadriceps, muscles in the front of the 
thigh, are doing most of the work during backward stair climbing, 
walking and running, while the buttocks and the hamstrings in back 
of the thigh muscles are virtually idle. ``It's also not great for 
the lower back because your posture and body alignment are thrown 
out of whack,'' Gelfand said. He said a better, safer way to tone 
the buttocks would be to go to the weight room and do strengthening 
exercises like lunges and leg presses, which target that area. And, 
while a 1995 Texas Tech University study found that walking backward 
at a 16-minute-a-mile pace elicited higher heart rates and burned 
more calories than regular jogging at a faster pace, Edmund Burke, 
director of the exercise science program of the University of Colorado 
in Colorado Springs, warns that it is not a practical way to get in 
shape or lose weight. ``Since you don't have eyes in back of your 
head it's an awkward way to move,'' Burke said. As for elliptical 
motion trainers, which require the legs to move in an elongated circle, 
the manufacturers do not push the backward motion feature. ``Though 
they probably won't cause any more injuries than forward movement, 
there's also no proof that it's beneficial,'' said Graham Melstrand, 
a sales representative for the Reebok CCS Body Trek and Body Peak 
elliptical motion trainers. Melstrand explained that the option to 
stride backward on the Reebok machines is a byproduct of the belt 
drive mechanism design rather than something engineered intentionally. 
Retro-cycling, pedaling backward on an exercise bicycle, may even 
be dangerous. ``We don't recommend it because of the injury potential,'' 
said John Baudhuin, president and chief executive of Mad Dogg Athletics, 
the company that trains and certifies aerobic instructors to teach 
the popular indoor cycling program, Spinning. Baudhuin said Spinning 
bikes have toe clips that act like ski bindings to keep the feet firmly 
anchored in the pedals, but they only work when pedaling forward. 
Backpedaling increases the risk of the feet disengaging and the pedal 
crank hitting the shins. Mad Dogg was so alarmed by the number of 
bloodied and bruised ankles caused in this manner that they released 
statements warning instructors to stop the practice. ``We told them 
that backward pedaling was unsafe and should not be included as part 
of the Spinning curriculum,'' Baudhuin said.
