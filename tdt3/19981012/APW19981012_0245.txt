Shares prices in Hong Kong surged for the second consecutive session 
Monday on expectations of cuts in both local and U.S. interest rates. 
The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 483.48 points, or 5.6 percent, 
to close at 8,990.27, its highest close since July 2. On Friday, the 
index had soared 567.28 points. Turnover also rose to 12.807 billion 
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.64 billion), up from Friday's 9.126 
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.17 billion). Dealers say investors 
are piling into the market on expectation that the territory's banks 
will cut interest rates as early as this week. Such hopes have set 
off a 12-percent rally in the index for the past three sessions. Hopes 
of yet another rate cut in the United States at the next meeting of 
the Federal Open Market Committee in mid-November are also bringing 
institutional investors back, traders add. ``There's more fear of 
being left out than buying high,'' said Kent Rossiter, head of institutional 
sales at Nikko Securities Co. Asia. Monday's gains on the Tokyo stock 
market and on Wall Street Friday also buoyed sentiments, traders said. 
Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 4.60 Hong Kong dollars to 45.90, 
and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 2.20 dollars to 37.50. In the banking 
sector, HSBC Holdings rose 9.00 dollars to 155.50, and Hang Seng Bank 
rose 2.25 dollars to 59.00. Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 4.00 
dollars 49.80, and Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 45 cents to 27.80.
