American tennis player Michael Chang has come back from a one set 
deficit to defeat Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia in the rain-delayed 
final of the Shanghai Open in China. Chang apparently recovered from 
a string of injuries and, urged on by the crowd, defeated Ivanisevic 
4-6, 6-1, 6-2 on Monday. The final match was delayed from Sunday because 
of rain. The victory was the second in six weeks for Chang, who is 
now ranked 33rd in the world after dropping from number three at the 
beginning of the year. That's sports. I'm Jim Stevenson.
