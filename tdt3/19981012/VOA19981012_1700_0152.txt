UN special envoy Laktar Brachemi is preparing to enter Afghanistan 
to meet with Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar in a bid to diffuse 
Taliban-Iran crisis talks. UN officials say despite the danger, Mr. 
Brachemi was given permission to go the Mullah's headquarters in Kandahar. 
Some 50 Iranians are believed to be held captive there. Iran is demanding 
their freedom and has massed troops near the Afghan border. Mr. Brachemi 
was already meeting with the Iranian leaders in Teheran and Taliban 
officials in Islamabad, Pakistan.
