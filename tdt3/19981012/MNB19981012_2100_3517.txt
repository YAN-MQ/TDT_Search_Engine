Certainly we're doing our part to bring an end to the English language 
here tonight. Before we go, Jane pauley haze quick program note. Tonight 
on "time and again," the Clinton everybody likes. First daughter chelsey 
Clinton, she's grown up before our eyes and during the controversy 
surrounding her father with uncommon dignity. In raising chelsey, 
Bill and Hillary got it right with a little advice from Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis. Chelsey Clinton, coming of age in the White House. 
Next on "time and again." Again, that is next here on MSNBC. "Time 
and again" hosted by Jane pauley. That's going to do it. We hope to 
see you back here tomorrow night. I'm Brian Williams. And for all 
of us who work the night shift here in an area where we don't trust 
air, we can't see. Good night. Have to show up in to buy a hat? What 
about Michael Jordan he needs an answer from the league? What about 
Shaquille O'Neal? He's supposed to live off his rap royaltyities? 
And Charles Barkley, become a politician, where the real money is? 
They've canceled the early part of the season. Lunacy because everybody 
is in love with baseball now. Football is so popular they might even 
bring a team back to llywood. Little kids are actually name a hockey 
player other than Gretzky. And soccer -- we do not need the richest 
sport with the highest paid players tells us they had no choice. We're 
here twice a night. Good night. "The news with Brian Williams" is 
next.
