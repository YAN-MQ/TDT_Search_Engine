Now we're going to take a look at the family and another scientific 
advance that might not be as big as viagara, but for women having 
trouble getting pregnant, it may be a big step forward for the step 
called in vitro fertilization. It looks like Kool-aid, but could it 
be the next magic potion -- -- for women who can't get pregnant? Fertility 
doctor, Bill schoolcraft, thinks so. Our process mimics nature. The 
doctor calls it a new baby food for the last five days in the life 
of a human embryo, when cells divide and multiply, critical steps 
for development. In the past, pregnancy rates have averaged about 
20%. And with this new technique, we're seeing pregnancy rates between 
60% and 70%. In the past, the poor success rate with in vitro was 
caused by fluid the embryos grew in. It never matched the quality 
of the mother's own reproductive system. For ten years, researcher 
David Gardner tried to match that natural process. We took what we 
knew about the changes in the embryo requirements and we took what 
we knew about the mother and formed these solutions. This is the new 
baby food? Yes, exactly. With the new formula, embryos grow much larger 
and stronger, greatly improving the chances of surviving and becoming 
a baby. The new process also sharply reduces the chances of multiple 
births, because with healthier embryos, fewer have to be implanted. 
Peek-A-Boo. That was a big plus for 8-month-old Ryan's mom, Susan 
oakes. Not only did you have a high degree of success, but you also 
had a high degree of success with fewer children. Doctors here are 
already working on the next advancement, to find that one embryo that 
is healthier and stronger than all the others. Then, women can get 
pregnant with only one embryo being implanted. But already, the advancement 
at the Colorado center for reproductive medicine has doubled the waiting 
list from three to six months for women desperate to get pregnant 
any way they can. Roger O'Neil, NBC news, Denver.
