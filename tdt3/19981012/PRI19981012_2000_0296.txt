An Iranian foundation has raised the bounty on the head of British 
author Salmon Rushdie. The Cordad Foundation was already offering 
a 2.5 million-dollar reward to who ever kills Rushdie, in obedience 
to a religious decree issued by the late Ayatollah Khomenie. The head 
of the Cordad Foundation said today, that the reward is being raised 
to 2.8 million dollars, an apparent challenge to efforts by Iran's 
new president to distance himself and his government from the order 
to kill. Khomenie ordered Rushdie's death for allegedly blaspheming 
Islam in his novel, "The Satanic Verses". On Saturday, an Iranian 
student group offered $333,000 to anyone who kills Rushdie.
