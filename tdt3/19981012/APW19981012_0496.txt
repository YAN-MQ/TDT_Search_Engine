Thirty Muslim leaders from around the world have appealed to Islamic 
insurgents in Algeria to join a truce called a year ago, saying blind 
violence by fighters was helping to pervert Islam. ``We bless this 
noble, patriotic initiative,'' said a statement obtained Monday. A 
copy of the statement, dated Sunday, was obtained by The Associated 
Press. The truce by the Islamic Salvation Army went into effect on 
Oct. 1, 1997. The statement called on Algerian authorities to use 
the truce to ``strengthen the bases for national global reconciliation.'' 
The statement was signed by Muslim leaders from Malaysia to Morocco, 
and included diverse names on the list of 30 that included activists 
like the head of Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood, university professors 
and thinkers. The signatories ``consider the truce ... a good work 
and a bold patriotic position that has contributed in an appreciable 
manner to diminishing the level of killings, destruction and attacks 
on sacred laws,'' the statement said. It added that the signatories 
agree that accusations of apostasy by armed groups concerning fellow 
Muslims are an ``ignomy,'' leading to ``great evil.'' Blind killings, 
likewise, give ``the enemies of Islam the occasion to deform (the 
religion) ....'' ``Islam always insists, even in cases of war ..., 
on preserving the blood of non-combatants, particularly women, children 
and the elderly,'' the statement said. In Algeria, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Abdelaziz Sbaa said Monday that authorities ``have long 
waited for a denunciation from these personalities of terrorist acts 
committed in the name of Islam.'' There was no indication the government 
was prepared to take up the suggestion of transforming a military 
truce into a political tool to resolve the crisis. There was no immediate 
reaction from the Armed Islamic Group, the radical insurgency movement 
held responsible for numerous massacres. The Islamic Salvation Army,
