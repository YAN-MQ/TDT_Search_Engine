The chief antidoping prosecutor of Italy's Olympic Committee resigned 
Monday, the latest victim of a doping scandal that has shaken Italian 
soccer. But professional soccer players dropped the threat of a strike, 
agreeing instead to measures designed to safeguard their health. The 
players' association had threatened a six-month walkout to protest 
the handling of the inquiries, which it claims violate players' privacy. 
Ugo Longo, the antidoping prosecutor, said ``difficult work conditions'' 
motivated his decision. Since the summer, Longo had been conducting 
one of four inquiries into the use of banned substances by Italy's 
first division soccer players. Investigators have reportedly discovered 
that some tests were not complete and results of others might have 
been hidden. The doping debacle has already seen CONI president Mario 
Pescante resign and the chief of CONI's Acqua Acetosa laboratory, 
Emilio Gasbarrone, fired. The Acqua Acetosa lab was shut down after 
an International Olympic Committee (IOC) official deemed the facility 
unsatisfactory. AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman sparked the investigations 
in July when he raised questions about the sudden muscular development 
of certain players.
