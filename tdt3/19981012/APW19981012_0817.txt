BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was to brief 
NATO late Monday on his talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
before the alliance will decide whether to take the last military 
step needed to launch airstrikes against the Serbs. ``Apparently he 
got enough concessions from Milosevic to brief the (NATO) ambassadors,'' 
said a NATO official, who demanded anonymity. NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana talked ``at length'' over the phone with Holbrooke about 
his latest attempts to persuade Serb leader Milosevic to abide by 
U.N. Security Council demands in Kosovo, the official said. Holbrooke 
left Belgrade and was to meet Solana around 8 p.m. (1800GMT), the 
official said. If the Holbrooke talks fail, NATO was expected to approve 
an activation order later on Monday, a vital step before airstrikes 
can be launched.
