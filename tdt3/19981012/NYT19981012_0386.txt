Julian H. Robertson Jr., who runs Tiger Management LLC, one of the 
largest hedge funds in the world, said Monday that the global financial 
markets remained precarious and that he did not expect things to get 
much better anytime soon. ``We're going through a rough spot now,'' 
Robertson told a meeting here, where hundreds of professionals are 
gathered for the largest hedge fund conference of its kind. ``I kind 
of feel like a batter who hasn't had a hit in 15 at bats. It's not 
a good period.'' With global markets facing one of the most turbulent 
periods in a decade, global investors everywhere have been hurt, many 
because of ill-fated bets in Russia and other emerging markets. Hedge 
funds, which manage money for wealthy individuals and institutions, 
have been known to make the riskiest of bets, and lately those bets, 
many here acknowledge, have turned calamitous. ``I think the liquidity 
in the global markets has deteriorated markedly,'' Robertson said 
Monday in a televised linkup from New York to a packed auditorium 
of hedge fund aficionados and others who manage investments for the 
affluent. ``I do not see a clear indication it is turning the other 
way.'' Robertson's comments are particularly noteworthy because he 
manages one of the largest hedge funds in the world, and hedge funds 
have come under increasing public scrutiny in the last month because 
of huge losses among a fabled few, including Long-Term Capital Management, 
which narrowly escaped bankruptcy last month when the Federal Reserve 
orchestrated a rescue backed by Wall Street's leading investment banks. 
In August, hedge funds suffered their sharpest losses in more than 
a decade, and Robertson's own fund, Tiger Management, which has about 
$20 billion under management, said it had lost about $600 million 
because of investments in Russian debt. ``We really thought the Russian 
bet was one of the better ones we made this year,'' he said. ``I guess 
I've learned that the best laid plans of mice and men can go wrong.'' 
In a question and answer format, conference attendants lined up here 
at the Southampton Princess Hotel to ask Robertson his thoughts on 
the market and the future of hedge funds. Robertson's answer? In the 
short run, he said, things do not look good. ``Only a wild optimist 
could not expect more redemptions,'' he said. More than 900 people 
are attending the conference, which is sponsored by Hedge/MAR, a New 
York publishing concern that tracks the hedge fund industry. The conference 
comes at a time when hedge funds are front and center, and the tone 
reflects how much the industry has been altered in recent months. 
For example, the topics include ``Crisis and Corrections: Implications 
for Hedge Funds.'' Although few attendants appear to favor government 
regulation of hedge funds, which they say would be costly and cumbersome, 
Robertson said that some regulation, particularly of leveraging, would 
not be all bad. ``I think there will be some regulations and some 
regulation would be good; too much would be really bad,'' he said. 
Several participants, however, insist that the rescue of Long-Term 
Capital, based in Greenwich, Conn., has cast a pall over the industry, 
one that is largely unjustified, they argue, particularly in light 
of the strong performance of most hedge funds in recent years. While 
the average hedge fund was down 5 percent in the third quarter, the 
average stock fund was down 13 percent, the hedge fund faithful point 
out. The greatest fear here appears to be that the wealthy will pull 
out of hedge funds and redeem their money, causing greater trading 
havoc. And like Wall Street, the latest bets here, or at least hopes, 
is that the industry will ride out the storm and then resume its growth. 
Many here say Robertson struck the right tone when he was asked for 
a forecast of the hedge fund industry. ``What has happened here will 
cause some fallout in the industry, and will cause some regulation 
in the industry,'' he said. ``But 10, 20 years later, the industry 
will be even stronger.''
