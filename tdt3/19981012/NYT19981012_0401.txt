In a move that surprised many on Wall Street, two top executives of 
Triarc Cos., which owns Snapple and Mistic beverage lines as well 
as several restaurant franchises, have made a bid to take Triarc private. 
The company announced Monday that it had formed a committee to evaluate 
the proposal. It will consist of three outside directors, who had 
not been chosen late Monday. The two executives, Nelson Peltz and 
Peter W. May, who together control about six million Triarc shares, 
or 26 percent of the total, offered $18 for each outstanding share. 
Triarc's stock closed at $13.1875 on Friday, and the news Monday pushed 
the price up $3, to $16.1875. Several analysts said they thought that 
Peltz, Triarc's chairman and chief executive, regarded the stock as 
undervalued, and because of that, decided to take it private with 
a new share offering likely several years from now. May is the president 
and chief financial officer. ``There has to be enormous frustration,'' 
said Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 
who has recommended Triarc to clients. ``Nelson and Peter bought into 
this company five years ago at about $12 a share, and the stock on 
Friday was a dollar above what it was when they bought it.'' All that 
was despite significant changes at Triarc in the last couple of years. 
In May 1997, Triarc acquired Snapple for $300 million from the Quaker 
Oats Co. Quaker had paid $1.7 billion for the brand in 1994, which 
had a wide following among young people in particular. The momentum 
reversed under the new management, and Quaker put it up for sale. 
``They made a very astute purchase with Snapple, and they have halted 
the decline there and are repositioning Snapple to grow,'' said Martin 
Romm, a beverage analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. Triarc also 
disposed of certain assets to clean up its balance sheet. Among those 
were 355 Arby's restaurants, sold to a unit of RTM of Atlanta for 
$73 million last year. Triarc then became strictly a franchiser of 
restaurants, collecting $39 million in operating income this year 
from royalties on meals sold, Conway estimated. Triarc issued an earnings 
warning last month saying its third-quarter income would be lower 
because of higher taxes and other unusual factors. Its stock price 
soared to $27 in May and fell back to $21 in July. But it was the 
most recent drubbing that led to the announcement Monday. ``You've 
got very low interest rates, you've got an environment which is not 
fully reflecting the value of Triarc, and they are entrepreneurs,'' 
Romm said. ``They are trying to drive value.''
