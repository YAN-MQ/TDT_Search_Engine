An agitated David Justice popped into the interview room at Yankee 
Stadium Monday as an unexpected arrival on the Cleveland Indians' 
day off. Almost instantly, he created a scene that had all the feel 
and flavor of open-mike night at group therapy. Justice had something 
to say. And neither the Bronx-bound traffic nor the gloom of his team's 
position in the American League Championship Series was going to stop 
him from pouring out his feelings. Wearing a black leather jacket 
and black knit cap from the French Connection collection, Justice 
took a seat and railed against a report he saw Sunday night that had 
questioned his desire to be a team player. The report mentioned that 
Justice took himself out of the Indians' lineup before Sunday's crucial 
Game 5, a game Cleveland lost to go down to the Yankees by three games 
to two in this four-of-seven-game series. Justice had been hit in 
the right arm by a pitch in Game 4. ``I was hurt to my heart when 
I was watching ESPN `Baseball Tonight' and Peter Gammons said I asked 
out of the lineup,'' Justice said without being prompted by a question. 
``I never asked out of the lineup. ``You've got little kids out there 
that look up to me. All I've ever preached to kids is don't ever give 
up, give your best. And then for that to be displayed _ that I asked 
out of the lineup _ I didn't appreciate that.'' In an attempt to repair 
his image, Justice explained why his name was scratched from the lineup. 
He said Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove approached him during the 
pregame warm-ups and asked about his right arm. Justice, listed third 
in the batting order at the time, said he told Hargrove that his arm 
was a little sore. He also suggested to Hargrove that he move him 
down in the order to bat seventh ``because if David Wells makes tough 
pitches, it's going to be hard on me.'' Perhaps Hargrove, who did 
not join Justice at Yankee Stadium on Monday, was not thrilled to 
hear his star hitter's aches or suggestions. Sometimes a manager just 
wants to hear ``I'm fine.'' Within an hour of the game, Hargrove inserted 
Richie Sexson into the lineup despite the fact that he had only one 
hit in his last 22 at bats. Sexson over Justice? Justice took it like 
a lamb. And perhaps this is where Justice loses some people. To many, 
it did not matter if Justice was struggling at the plate _ hitting 
.250 in the postseason _ because he has always been an impact player 
and this was a team that needed his bat and experience considering 
the crucial nature of Game 5. But unlike other stars, Justice did 
not argue with Hargrove or demand to be in the lineup. He was inserted 
as a pinch-hitter in the ninth inning against Mariano Rivera, but 
did not get a hit. ``I was raised that you are a player,'' said Justice, 
who expects to be in the lineup when the Indians face the Yankees 
Tuesday night in Game 6. ``You don't demand nothing. I don't run the 
team. My job is to be ready when called upon.'' Justice went on to 
say that his teammates know his reputation as a big-game player. But 
in the Indians' clubhouse after Game 5, a couple of his teammates 
just shrugged their shoulders when Justice's name was mentioned. Apparently, 
they did not understand why he was out of the lineup either. In the 
end, Hargrove may bear some of the burden for the Justice situation. 
After the Indians lost Game 5, Hargrove said Justice could have played, 
but did little to clarify the reason Justice was replaced in the lineup. 
Meanwhile, Justice was nowhere to be found after the game, a fact 
that he apologized for Monday. Whatever the reason for his absence, 
this off-day cameo by Justice was not about the 3-2 hole the Indians 
have found themselves in as they face possible elimination at Yankee 
Stadium Tuesday night. This was about Justice's image. ``This is my 
ninth year in the big leagues,'' Justice said. ``Seven of those nine 
years, I have been in the postseason. I think of those nine years. 
I have built a reputation as being a good person, a good teammate, 
as well as a good player _ a player who always shows up to play in 
the big games all the time.'' The thought that this reputation was 
being tainted by Gammons _ who was among others reporting on the curious 
nature of Justice's absence in Game 5 _ left Justice sleepless. That 
is why he used Monday's interview session, usually reserved for pitchers 
only, as a vehicle to unleash his feelings. ``This won't be a distraction,'' 
Justice said. ``Tell you the truth, once I leave from here, I have 
gotten it off my chest.'' And one more thing. Just before Justice 
ended his cathartic session, he added, ``Thank you for listening.''
