SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs said Monday that China 
should devalue its currency next year and criticized other Asia exchange 
rates as unrealistic. Beijing's rate was ``fraught with future trouble,'' 
Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute of Development, told reporters 
at the World Economic Forum's seventh annual East Asia Economic Summit. 
China's huge economy has become less competitive than many of its 
Asian neighbors, where currencies have depreciated significantly since 
the start of the regional crisis in the summer of 1997. Sachs said 
the Hong Kong dollar, pegged at 7.80 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar, 
has also reduced the territory's competitiveness against its Southeast 
Asian counterparts. Keeping the Chinese and Hong Kong currencies at 
their rates has been considered crucial to preventing a repeated outbreak 
of Asian currency devaluations, like those that set off the regional 
crisis. Western and regional leaders have urged Beijing to keep its 
exchange rate, despite falling growth in its giant economy. The Chinese 
currency has been kept at 8.27 yuan to the dollar. Other Asian currencies 
have received some respite from falling values recently, with the 
greenback weakening significantly against most regional denominations. 
Sachs said the current dollar-yen exchange rate was unjustified since 
economic fundamentals in both the United States and Japan had deteriorated 
in the last few months. ``The dollar shouldn't be weakening against 
the yen,'' he said, arguing that a depreciation against European currencies 
was more appropriate. He said the yen's rapid appreciation against 
the U.S. currency could have been caused by hedge funds _ squeezed 
by their creditors _ unwinding their positions. ``That suggests that 
the yen will depreciate again,'' he said, adding that a U.S dollar 
valued at 115 yen ``is too strong.'' The dollar, which fell to as 
low as 111.45 last week, cost 116.72 yen late Monday in Tokyo. Sachs 
argued that a strong yen, although seen boosting regional currencies, 
would be counterproductive to Asia's recovery if Japan's economy remained 
weak. ``The bigger problem is a Japanese economy in recession,'' he 
said.
