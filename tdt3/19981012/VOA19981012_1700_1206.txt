Week six of the National Football League season comes to an end in 
just a few hours with a first-ever meeting between two Florida teams 
- the Miami Dolphins and Jacksonville Jaguars. The weekly Monday night 
game will be played in Jacksonville, where the Jaguars have won 17 
of their last 19 home games. Along with the Denver Broncos and Minnesota 
Vikings, Jacksonville is one of three undefeated teams remaining in 
the league. The Dolphins were undefeated until last week, winning 
their first three games before falling to the New York Jets. Dolphins 
linebacker Derrick Rogers says his team will have to stop the run 
and contain Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell. Start with the 
running game. We want to make sure that we, you know, make sure we 
keep them in check in their running game. We don't want them to break 
out in long runs. Want to make sure we - also we keep Brunell in the 
pocket. Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson has placed a greater emphasis 
on running this season. But the Jaguar defense has allowed an average 
of just 91 yards per game on the ground this year. Jacksonville linebacker 
Bryce Pop says Miami quarterback Dan Marino will be tough to stop. 
You just never know with Marino. Marino will, you know, thread it 
in there, even if you're draped all over him, and you know, he's got 
that mac. He's still got the, you know, the great precision passing 
and, you know, makes it tough on you. Marino will likely try to exploit 
a Jacksonville defense that ranks 19th against the pass.
