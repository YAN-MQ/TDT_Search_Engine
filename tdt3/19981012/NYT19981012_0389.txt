The State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn 
has always been a bit of an underdog among the city's medically elite 
institutions. In spite of its groundbreaking work in the study of 
AIDS, alcoholism and other illnesses, kudos most often went to hospitals 
and research centers on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge, like 
Mount Sinai and New York University. But on Monday, SUNY Downstate, 
as the science center is known, earned its boasting rights over Manhattan 
when Dr. Robert Furchgott, a distinguished professor of pharmacology 
there, received a Nobel Prize in Medicine, the highest recognition 
possible for a body of work that most Americans would recognize only 
in the form of Viagra. Furchgott, 82, is in many ways a quintessential 
representative of Downstate, which had never received a Nobel Prize 
in Medicine and is better known to most New Yorkers as the college 
that provides doctors to Kings County Hospital Center, one of the 
city's busiest and perhaps most embattled hospitals. Several colleagues 
described Furchgott as modest, spending nearly every day nibbling 
sandwiches and eating yogurt in his office while poring over scientific 
journals, or toiling in his laboratory, pondering the mysteries of 
nitric oxide. ``His personal modesty stands in marked contrast to 
his magnificent achievement,'' said Dr. Eugene Feigelson, the college's 
dean of medicine. ``It is a source of pride for the entire institution 
and to Brooklyn and is a further distinction for us and for the State 
University of New York.'' When asked to reflect on his honor, Furchgott 
seemed almost dismissive. ``I was kind of surprised,'' he said in 
a telephone interview from his home in Hewlett, N.Y. ``My work is 
sort of old-fashioned pharmacology. ``Is it the highlight of my career?. 
I guess in a way, though you don't do research to win prizes. You 
do it because you're curious about what makes things tick.'' Sure, 
international attention, television cameras planted on the front lawn, 
phone ringing off the hook with calls from reporters struggling mightily 
to understand the subtleties of his work _ these things have tickled 
him. But his favorite moment in his entire career, he said, ``was 
when we discovered that endothelial cells were necessary for relaxation 
of arteries.'' ``Then,'' he said, ``it was finding that the endothelium-derived 
relaxing factor was nitric oxide. There have been lots of fun things.'' 
He is, by admission of his admirers, a serious man of research. ``His 
lectures were dull, onerous and droning on,'' said Eli Friedman, a 
distinguished professor of medicine at SUNY Downstate and a former 
student of Furchgott. ``But the content of his work was profound and 
inspiring. So if one could get past the fact that he was less than 
electric competition for Jackie Gleason on television, he was very 
exciting and moving.'' Furchgott, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry 
and is a professor emeritus at Downstate, won his prize for discoveries 
of new properties of nitric oxide. With colleagues, he was able to 
demonstrate that the gas nitric oxide can act as a messenger molecule 
that tells blood vessels to relax and dilate, which lowers blood pressure. 
The discovery was vital to developing the anti-impotence drug Viagra. 
In 1996, he won an Albert Lasker Award in basic medical research, 
which is often a precursor award to the Nobel Prize. ``Everyone here 
will walk a little straighter and hold their head a little higher 
because he is here,'' Friedman said. Students also said Furchgott 
brought more credibility to their institution. ``This will really 
put us on the map,'' said Matt Kelly, 23, a Ph.D. student. Furchgott 
was born in Charleston, S.C., and received a bachelor's degree in 
chemistry from the University of North Carolina in 1937 and a doctorate 
in biochemistry from Northwestern University in 1940. He plays golf 
(``not well,'' he said) and likes to bird-watch in his spare time. 
When asked what else he would like known about his career, Furchgott 
said: ``Nothing really. I would like to get myself some lunch now.''
