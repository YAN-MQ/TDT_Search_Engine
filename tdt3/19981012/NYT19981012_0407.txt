The pitcher who will try to guide the Yankees into the World Series 
on Tuesday night sat in an empty clubhouse with a cup of coffee Monday 
afternoon and basically invited a mass of reporters over for a baseball 
discussion. He was determined, nostalgic and relaxed. David Cone sounded 
ready. From the moment 11 months ago when Cone tossed his first rehabilitation 
pitches on the deck of a cruise ship, the thought of pitching on a 
night such as Tuesday night, in Game 6 of the American League Championship 
Series, has propelled him. Now Cone and the Yankees are on the precipice 
of continuing this marvelous ride because they will soar into the 
World Series if they conquer the Indians on Tuesday night. ``I feel 
lucky to be in this position,'' Cone said. ``This could be the last 
one. Every year I say it, but it's true. This is something that could 
be the last run. Who knows what this team is going to look like next 
year? What kind of year we're going to have? Whose going to be back? 
Right here, right now is what it's all about.'' Especially for these 
Yankees, who lead the ALCS, three games to two, who are trying to 
erase the Indians before an always tense Game 7, and who are chasing 
baseball history. The Yankees won 114 games during the regular season, 
more than every club in history except the 1906 Cubs. Obviously, the 
Yanks are favored to win a World Series title, and they do not want 
to wait until Wednesday to try to get there. ``We want to win,'' Derek 
Jeter said. ``We never want to go into a situation where we think 
we can win one of two. We'll treat tomorrow like it's Game 7.'' Speaking 
evenly and purposefully, Cone said: ``We know in the back of our minds, 
we don't want it to go to a Game 7. We also know in the back of our 
minds, we're onto a special season, and we want to close this thing 
out.'' That is up to Cone. Manager Joe Torre aligned his rotation 
around Cone, allowing the 35-year-old to start Games 2 and 6 so that 
he could have five days of rest, or one extra day, before Tuesday 
night's contest. It could be a serious advantage, considering Cone 
has a 1.57 earned run average in starts in which he has had five or 
more days of rest since May. Tuesday night, he works with more rest 
and with a self-imposed sense of purpose about his status as a Yankee. 
``Tomorrow night,'' Cone said, ``is going to be a defining moment 
in my career as a Yankee.'' Cone offered this line as a climax to 
an affirmative answer about whether he wants to be remembered as a 
Yankee. If Cone wins Tuesday night's rematch against Charles Nagy, 
who held New York to one run in Game 2, it will enhance his legacy. 
It would also allow Cone to eliminate some of the sting he felt after 
being pounded in Game 1 of the division series against the Indians 
last season and then not pitching in Game 5 because of his aching 
right shoulder. ``I think I've probably put more trust in David in 
the three years I have been here than in any other pitcher,'' Torre 
said of the right-hander, who is 1-0 with an 0.66 ERA in the post-season. 
Stroll the Yankees clubhouse, stop the first player you see and ask 
him who he would want pitching a possible clinching game, and the 
answer would usually be Cone. Even David Wells, who could be a better 
choice this season, picked Cone. ``I wouldn't want it any other way,'' 
Wells said. ``I think he deserves the situation he's put in. It's 
for a reason. He's meant for this kind of stuff. It's up to him to 
do the job.'' Cone called Tuesday night's start a reward for rebounding 
from shoulder surgery 361 days ago. No one knew how much Cone would 
boost the Yankees this season, but he won 20 games in the regular 
season, he has won one more in the post-season, and he is trying to 
win the most important game of the season Tuesday night. ``Everybody 
is aware that we've got a chance to carve out our own little piece 
of history here, to carve our own little niche,'' Cone said. ``Not 
only in Yankee history, but in baseball history. But we don't dwell 
on it. We don't talk about it very much. But everybody knows about 
it.''
