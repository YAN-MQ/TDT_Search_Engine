BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke wrapped up 
marathon talks Monday with President Slobodan Milosevic and left for 
Brussels to brief NATO officials amid indications of progress toward 
a deal aimed at evading airstrikes. Russian Defense Minister Igor 
Sergeyev told journalists in Moscow that Milosevic has agreed to allow 
1,500 international observers in Kosovo _ a move that would be a key 
concession by the Yugoslav leader. Sergeyev expressed optimism that 
a political settlement could be reached on the crisis, even as NATO 
was positioning itself for airstrikes, preparing to authorize an attack 
should the Milosevic-Holbrooke talks fail. There was no immediate 
confirmation of Milosevic's reported concession. But a statement from 
Milosevic's office said Holbrooke would return and hold more talks 
Tuesday. It said Milosevic ``has concluded that undoubtedly, necessary 
conditions exists for peaceful, political solution to the Kosovo problem.''
