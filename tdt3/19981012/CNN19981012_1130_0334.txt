President Clinton is cutting short a scheduled fund-raising trip because 
of the impasse in Congress over the federal budget. He's making himself 
available for negotiations with republican congressional leaders. 
Mr. Clinton will travel to New York this afternoon to attend receptions 
for democratic senatorial candidate Charles Schumer, who's trying 
to unseat republican Alfonse D'Amato. Mr. Clinton delayed his departure 
after republican lawmakers criticized him for leaving town in the 
middle of the negotiations.
