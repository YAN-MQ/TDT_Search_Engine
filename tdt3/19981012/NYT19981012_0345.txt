Emboldened by recent polls that suggest a backlash against Republicans 
for initiating impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, 
Vice President Al Gore on Monday made his strongest comments to date 
on the subject in speeches criticizing Congress for not passing significant 
legislation. At two fund-raisers here for Democratic candidates, Gore 
lashed out at what he called a ``do-nothing Congress'' that has focused 
on the president's problems at the expense of issues more important 
to the American people. The remarks were the most extensive the vice 
president has publicly made about the president's predicament. ``What 
the president did was wrong,'' Gore said at a lunch for Hubert Humphrey 
and Roger Moe, who are running for governor and lieutenant governor 
of Minnesota. ``He has acknowledged that and asked for forgiveness. 
The American people have also concluded that the proposed process 
called impeachment is not a punishment that fits the crime.'' He added: 
``They want to move on. They are tired of all these people on television 
talking endlessly about something that everybody knows more about 
than they ever wanted to know about.'' Earlier, Gore made virtually 
the same points in a speech for Rep. David Minge and Rep. Bruce Vento, 
Minnesota Democrats who are expected to be re-elected without much 
trouble. Humphrey, the state attorney general and son of the former 
vice president and senator, and Moe, a former state legislator, are 
in tougher races against their Republican opponents: Norm Coleman, 
the mayor of St. Paul, and Gen Olson, a state lawmaker and former 
mayor of Minnetrista. Gore's decision to turn up the heat on the Republicans 
was influenced by a number of political developments, aides said, 
among them new polls on the Monica Lewinsky matter and the lack of 
agreement on a federal budget almost two weeks into the 1999 fiscal 
year. ``The Republicans are dragging it out in hopes they will gain 
some partisan advantage for it, even if it ends up hurting this country 
by dragging it on indefinitely,'' Gore said of the impeachment proceedings. 
``And that's why I say again to the Republican majority in the Congress: 
Get on with it. Pass a budget. Pass the appropriations bills. Fund 
education. Save Social Security first. Pass a patients' bill of rights. 
And do the will of the American people.'' Much of the impetus for 
the vice president's attack, aides said, came from internal White 
House polls showing that Republican gains in congressional races had 
peaked in late September, about a week after the videotape of Clinton's 
grand jury testimony was broadcast to the nation. Those findings appeared 
supported by a survey last week by The Washington Post, which found 
that public support for Congress, and for Republican congressional 
candidates, had slipped in the aftermath of the vote to begin impeachment 
proceedings. The House vote was largely along partisan lines. In addition 
to finding that Clinton's approval ratings had increased, the Post 
reported, the poll found that support for Democratic candidates had 
increased, while support for Republican candidates had fallen. This 
reversed a trend of several months during which Republican candidates 
had been increasing their leads over Democrats, the newspaper said.
