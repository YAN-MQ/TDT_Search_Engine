This look at your "Headline News weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Tuesday morning. Cold front moving through the east 
carrying no precipitation at all with it. There is some much cooler 
air rolling in behind this front however. And another cold front is 
rolling into the northwestern corner of the United States with rainfall 
in Washington and Oregon. All in all, through much of the U.S. we're 
going to see nice autumn weather. But it will be chilly. As a matter 
of fact, there is the threat of frost in the overnight hours in the 
upper midwest. And daytime highs may only be in the 40s. Still warm 
across the south. As you can see, 80s from Florida to Texas, and in 
the desert areas, a few 90 degree readings are expected. Here is a 
look at your extended forecast. On Wednesday, rainfall possible in 
the New England states and in the northwest. As we move ahead into 
Thursday, you can see rainfall in the northwest as yet another cold 
front moves in through that area. And in the northern Rockies, there 
is even a threat of a little bit of snowfall with the cold weather 
moving in behind that same frontal boundary. By Friday, a rain/snow 
mix is possible in the upper midwest.
