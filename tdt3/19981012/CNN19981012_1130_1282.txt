The Braves are still alive as they head for five. I'm Anthony Keith 
James with "Headline Sports." The Braves and padres play game five 
of the national league series this evening. It's a matchup of 17-game 
winners John smoltz and Andy Ashby. Sunday, Atlanta forced a 5th game 
by exploding for six runs in the seventh for an 8-3 win. Andres Galarraga 
belted a grand slam. Padres lead the best of seven at three games 
to one.
