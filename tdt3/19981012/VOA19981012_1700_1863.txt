Britain has closed its embassy in Belgrade, and other foreign nationals 
are leaving Yugoslavia amid the growing threat of air strikes. Correspondent 
Laurie Kassman reports from London. Britain is taking no chances. 
The foreign office announced it has closed its embassy in Belgrade 
as a precautionary measure. Several other embassies also have sent 
nonessential staff and dependents out of the country. International 
aid organizations like Save The Children are also evacuating staff 
from Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro. Here in London, defense officials 
are briefing Prime Minister Blair on the military options in Kosovo. 
U.S. B-52 bombers arrived this past weekend at several British airfields 
to wait for the go-ahead from NATO commanders for air strikes against 
Serb forces in Kosovo. But U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is still in 
Belgrade trying to broker a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Laurie 
Kassman, VOA News, London.
