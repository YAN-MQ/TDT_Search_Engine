two td passes. Denver handed Seattle its third straight loss, 21-16. 
Chris Chandler tossed a pair of td passes and ran for another. The 
falcons go to 4-1 with a 34-20 Rout over the giants. Three drew Bledsoe 
td passes helped the Patriots roll over the chiefs 40-10. Robert Edwards 
is the first player since 1970 to score TDs in his first five pro 
games. Tonight Jacksonville plays the 3-$1.00 15s.
