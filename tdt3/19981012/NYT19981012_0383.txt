Six people believed to be illegal immigrants from Mexico were hit 
and killed early Monday by a freight train as they slept on a desolate 
stretch of tracks in southern Texas. Officials said they believed 
the immigrants may have been victims of a superstition that the rails 
would keep them safe from snakes. ``There's a myth that if you sleep 
between the rails that snakes will not get you,'' said Mark Davis, 
a spokesman for Union Pacific. ``You go down the railroad tracks, 
you'll see snakes cut in half.'' Davis said the driver of the train 
blew the whistle repeatedly when he noticed the people on the tracks. 
Although a couple of the victims raised their heads, no one got off 
the tracks. Davis said he was uncertain how far the train was from 
the victims when the driver saw them. But, he added, it would have 
taken a mile to stop the 105-car train, which was traveling between 
45 and 49 miles an hour. The vast ranchlands of South Texas that stretch 
between the Rio Grande and San Antonio are among the most remote in 
the state, mile after mile of mesquite, prickly pear, citrus farms 
and grazing lands that are a prime avenue for illegal immigrants trying 
to make their way from the Mexican border to San Antonio or Houston. 
While illegal immigrants have been killed while sleeping on railroad 
tracks before, Fred Borrego, patrol agent in charge of the U.S. Border 
Patrol in Kingsville, said never had so many been killed in one accident. 
Between 2,000 and 3,000 illegal immigrants pass through his 2,600-square-mile 
patrol area each month, he said. The most recent victims, who were 
badly mutilated, have not been identified. They were taken to Corpus 
Christi where authorities will try to use fingerprints to determine 
their identity. Borrego had another possible explanation for the accident. 
``Another theory I've been told is that in Mexico the trains don't 
run at night,'' Borrego said. ``They say they sleep up there because 
they feel a lot safer.'' Although it seems implausible that people 
could sleep with the noise of a train running toward them, Davis said, 
``a train operating when you're in front of it is very, very quiet.'' 
The engine noise is primarily to the side, he said, and there is very 
little friction on the rail itself. ``I know its hard to believe,'' 
Borrego said. ``I've experienced this myself. If it's coming toward 
you it's as quiet as a cat.'' But officials in the Kenedy County sheriff's 
office speculated that the hard traveling conditions confronted by 
the immigrants could also have played a role. The terrain in the area 
is very rugged, with most of it being brush covered. ``You think, 
`I'd never fall asleep there' or `Why wouldn't they wake up?''' said 
Hopy Alines, a secretary in the sheriff's office. ``But it just doesn't 
happen. These people travel three, four and five days without eating, 
without sleeping. They're just completely exhausted and they don't 
wake up.'' Generally the illegal immigrants traveling through the 
county go unnoticed aside from the trail of odds and ends they leave 
behind, Ms. Alines said. ``You'll see empty bottles, sometimes bags 
of clothes,'' she said. ``We get a lot of calls where they break in 
and all they ever take is food and water.'' It is generally when people 
get sick or have problems that officials hear stories like the ones 
about people sleeping on the tracks. Davis estimated that four to 
six people a year are injured or killed while sleeping on railroad 
tracks. In fact, he said, there have been cases where people sleeping 
on tracks have been run over and survived. ``Unfortunately, or fortunately, 
they're intoxicated,'' he said. The train, which was carrying a variety 
of freight like scrap paper and metal automobile parts, was traveling 
from Houston to Brownsville, Texas, when the accident occurred about 
3:15 a.m. near the tiny town of Norias, which is 60 miles north of 
Brownsville. Last year in Texas there were 38 fatalities and 80 injuries 
involving what railroad officials call ``trespass accidents,'' Davis 
said, cases where people were struck on or near tracks or trying to 
get on a railroad car. Borrego said the last time he could remember 
a large group of illegal immigrants being killed on train tracks was 
in 1983 or 1984 when 14 people were killed trying to cross a railroad 
trestle. Border Patrol officials along with Union Pacific officials 
caution illegal immigrants about sleeping on railroad tracks as part 
of general information they provide on the dangers of crossing the 
border. ``Sometimes they don't get the word,'' Borrego said. ``The 
conditions out here are rigid. You've got cactus, mesquite. It's no 
fun walking through the territory. They run out of water, they get 
bit by snakes.''
