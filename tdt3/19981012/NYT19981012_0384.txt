President Clinton flew into New York on Monday night to raise $1 million 
for one of the most fiercely contested Senate races in the nation 
_ Charles Schumer's challenge to Alfonse D'Amato _ and to draw emotional 
sustenance from a place where Clinton has been admired, even during 
his worst of times. Only one thing was missing: Schumer. Even as Clinton 
was preparing to head to Air Force One from the White House, Schumer, 
a Democratic congressman from Brooklyn, was boarding the 2:30 p.m. 
Delta Shuttle for Washington for a series of session-ending votes 
on the budget. The result was an odd scene in which Clinton spoke 
to a hotel ballroom filled with Schumer signs, Schumer supporters, 
and Schumer's wife, Iris _ but no Schumer, aside from three minutes 
of videotaped remarks that the congressman had prepared Monday morning. 
Schumer's absence from his own blue-chip fund-raiser was due to a 
tangle of governmental and political obligations _ and suggested that 
D'Amato had captured Schumer's attention with his latest line of attack 
in the campaign. D'Amato's escalating criticism of Schumer for missing 
votes this year left the congressman with a choice between staying 
in New York with Clinton and risking new criticism from D'Amato, or 
going to Washington and leaving Clinton alone to do his financial 
favor. Schumer chose the latter. ``I told Chuck Schumer when he decided 
to take on this herculean task that if he ever needed anyone to fill 
in for him, just to call me,'' Clinton said after being swept with 
applause that lasted two minutes and was quieted only when the congressman's 
wife raised her hand. ``So here I am.'' And then, for 21 minutes, 
the president, standing alone on a stage at the New York Hilton, laid 
out a case for Schumer that went notably beyond the president's usual 
generic case for Democratic candidates in his frequent trips across 
the nation. Clinton assailed Republicans for questioning Schumer's 
attendance record in a congressional session that he said was notable 
for its lack of accomplishment. In the Senate, he said, Schumer could 
at once fill the constituent-service role that D'Amato has traditionally 
played in New York _ which has earned him the nickname ``Senator Pothole'' 
_ and perform the grander policy duties normally associated with senators. 
``New York deserves a senator who is both tied to the specific, concrete 
needs of individuals and their communities, and a senator who will 
vote in the interests of this state and the nation over the long run, 
and finally give voice to what makes America a great nation,'' Clinton 
said. ``This is a time when we need people who are both practical 
and visionary.''
