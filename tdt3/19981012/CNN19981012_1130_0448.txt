An Iranian Shiite Muslim group is raising its bounty on author salman 
Rushdie. It has added $300,000 to the $2.5 million reward for killing 
him. Rushdie has been in hiding since 1989. That's when Iran declared 
his book, "the satanic verses," blasphemous to Islam and the late 
Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or religious edict for death. Last 
month, Iran's government lifted the death warrant. But hardline Muslims 
are ignoring the move. Last week, another group offered another $333,000 
for Rushdie's death.
