U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke is in Belgrade trying to negotiate 
a settlement to the Kosovo crisis. Brent Sadler has the latest. In 
Belgrade's predawn hours, United States envoy Richard Holbrooke emerges 
from another grueling session of crisis talks with the Yugoslav leader. 
We remain on an intense effort to find a peaceful and satisfactory 
outcome to what can only be called an emergency, while in another 
part of Europe, in Brussels, NAto continues to move towards a very 
different form of outcome. Three hours of sleep, a daylight reappearance, 
the diplomatic pace quickening and no time to spare. Mr. Holbrooke, 
good morning. hi. I am sorry. We don't have time. Traveling back and 
forth to the presidential palace, Mr. Holbrooke has held nine meetings 
in eight days. But his 'round-the-clock exchanges with President Slobodan 
Milosevic are showing signs of strain, described as intense and, at 
times, very heated. Western nations anticipating the possibility of 
air strikes are scaling down their diplomatic presence still further. 
The U.S. ambassador and the skeleton staff of 12 will remain in the 
Serbian capital for now at least. Most NAto countries are responding 
to the looming threat of force. The German embassy evacuated all its 
diplomats and closed down. It's becoming more difficult to travel 
to and from Yugoslavia by air. International airlines have begun suspending 
some flights into Belgrade. But there has been no reported rush of 
passengers trying to leave the country. There are new signs, however, 
pointing to air-raid shelters. While NATO gathers a strike force involving 
more than 400 planes, including B-52 bombers with cruise missiles, 
there is no real sign of panic here, no run on the gas stations as 
might be expected. And no widespread reports of people stocking up 
with food. There's a good reason for that -- say Serbs, whose economy 
lies in ruins. I'm afraid, he says, but I have no spare money to buy 
extra supplies. What does it matter if they're going to bomb us? A 
decision to launch NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia may not be 
imminent, but it appears close. Knife-edged diplomacy continues. And 
while there are talks, there remains hope for a peaceful solution. 
Brent Sadler, for CNN, Belgrade.
