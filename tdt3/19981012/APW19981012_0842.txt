BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO nations began assessing a U.S. envoy's 
report on Kosovo talks Monday in Belgrade before deciding whether 
to take the last military step needed to launch airstrikes against 
the Serbs. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana talked ``at length'' 
over the phone with U.S. evoy Richard Holbrooke about his latest attempts 
to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to abide by U.N. 
Security Council demands in Kosovo, a NATO official, who demanded 
anonymity, said. No details of the discussions were available. If 
the Holbrooke talks fail, NATO is expected to approve an activation 
order later on Monday, a vital step before airstrikes can be launched. 
A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an activation 
order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in Kosovo, where 
hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 275,000 uprooted 
since February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels. The order would 
transfer the command over the airplanes and military equipment necessary 
for an airstrike to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize 
its deployment over Yugoslavia. From then on, Gen. Clark would no 
longer need any approval from the 16 member nations and proceed only 
in consultation with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, NATO officials 
said on condition of anonymity. ``We are heading toward decision time 
now,'' said the NATO official. Solana and Holbrooke have been in close 
touch over the past week. The few days between any activation order 
and actual airstrikes allow Milosevic more time to consider the consequences. 
NATO authorities also met with Russian representatives at NATO headquarters 
Monday in an ongoing attempt to keep Moscow informed on the military 
preparations. Russia opposes airstrikes against Yugoslavia and has 
long been lobbying for a negotiated solution. Moscow has threatened 
to veto any U.N. resolution calling for airstrikes. Almost all NATO 
members have cleared barriers to participating in airstrikes. On Monday, 
the outgoing German government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl was also 
expected to back potential NATO airstrikes. Prior to the activation 
order, NATO officials agreed on rules of engagement, targeting, liaison 
with humanitarian organizations in Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops 
in Bosnia. The NATO alliance also reached common ground on a legal 
basis for airstrikes over the weekend, removing uncertainty whether 
an additional U.N. resolution was necessary. The Americans, and Europeans 
are demanding that Milosevic halt the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 
against the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent 
ethnic Albanian province of Serbia, a part of the Yugoslav republic. 
On Monday, the alliance ambassadors were still hoping for a change 
of mind on the part of Milosevic, but ``the latest impression is that 
all is the same,'' said the NATO official.
