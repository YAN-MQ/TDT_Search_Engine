This is Jim Miklaszewski at the Pentagon, where despite progress on 
the diplomatic front, military planning continues tonight for NAto 
air strikes to keep up the pressure on Milosevic. Port visits are 
now canceled for the aircraft carrier "Eisenhower" and her battle 
group awaiting orders to move into the adriatic within striking distance 
of Kosovo. American B-52 bombers, armed with deadly, accurate cruise 
missiles, are positioned in Great Britain, while an array of NAto 
fighters and bombers are staged, ready to launch attacks at air bases 
throughout Europe. Once NATO gives the okay, air strikes could begin 
within 24 hours. And if we're called to use force, that means diplomacy 
has failed. We'd be ready to go. And even as Milosevic negotiates, 
there are ominous signs he's preparing to fight. Serbian anti-aircraft 
missile batteries, some with the latest Russian technology, are in 
position and on alert. There has also been threats of possible retaliation 
against NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia, including 7,500 American GIs. 
The U.S. army's chief of staff said all precautions are being taken. 
Any increase in threat that goes on anywhere in the world, particularly 
in the Balkans, they'll adjust to it, they'll take whatever measures 
are necessary. The threat of NATO airstrikes will Hang over Milosevic 
as long as negotiations continue. Given NAto's superiority, U.S. officials 
are comfort -- that this is one fight Milosevic will not want to take 
this fight on, Tom?
