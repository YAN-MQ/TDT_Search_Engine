NAto is taking a firm stand in the Kosovo crisis despite an agreement 
from Slobodan Milosevic to end attacks on Albanians. Today in Brussels, 
am Bass dorz gave the green light for military strikes on Serbia. 
They made their decision after Richard Holbrooke briefed allies about 
his talks with the Serb leader. Holbrooke will return to Yugoslavia 
tomorrow to continue negotiations. Strikes will be delayed for 96 
hours to see what Milosevic will do. Even at this last hour, I still 
believe diplomacy can succeed and the use of military force can be 
avoided. But the responsibility lies on the shoulders of President 
Milosevic. He knows what he has to do. Once again, today has been 
an important day in which we have been able to see some progress we 
have made and we hope very much that the progress will move forward 
in the coming hours.
