President Clinton says Milosevic has committed to removing his troops 
but that doesn't mean he's going to follow through with that. Commitments 
are not compliance. Balance can graveyards are filled with President 
Milosevic's broken promises. In the days ahead we will focus not only 
on what President Milosevic says but on what we see he does through 
a robust, on the ground and in the air verification system. I hope 
that the commitments President Milosevic has made can create a peaceful 
way forward. That has been our preference all along. President Clinton 
says Milosevic has committed to removing the troops. The genocide 
in Kosovo has been continuing for seven months.
