"Headline News." I'm Chuck Roberts. Thaption for looking in this holiday 
Monday. As the international community is focused on whether progress 
is being made to ease the conflict in Kosovo. U.S. special envoy Richard 
Holbrooke is briefing ambassadors at NATO headquarters in Brussels 
about the 50 hours of negotiations that have taken place over the 
last week with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Holbrooke has 
been trying to convince Milosevic to comply with U.N. resolutions. 
Russian diplomats say Milosevic has agreed to allow 1,500 observers 
in the embattled Kosovo province. The U.N. wants NAto forces to be 
part of the observers. There has been no confirmation from Holbrooke 
on any concessions from bell braid. NATO forces continue preparing 
for air strikes against Yugoslavia. With the threat of military involvement, 
the United States and other western allies are asking their citizens 
to evacuate Yugoslavia and Bosnia. CNN's Brent Sadler reports staff 
members are also leaving. Meanwhile, western nations anticipating 
the possibility of air strikes have scaled down their diplomatic presence 
still further. The U.S. ambassador and a skeleton staff of 12 will 
remain in the Serbian capital for now at least. Most NAto countries 
are responding to a looming threat of military action. The German 
embassy evacuated all its diplomats and closed down. Meanwhile it's 
becoming more and more difficult to travel to and from bell braid 
-- Belgrade by airline. International airlines have begun suspending 
some flights. But there's been no reported rush of people trying to 
leave the country. There are new signs, however, pointing to air raid 
shelters at the airport. While NATO gathers a strike force involving 
more than 400 planes, including B-52 bombers with cruise missiles, 
there is no real sign of panic here on the streets of Belgrade.
