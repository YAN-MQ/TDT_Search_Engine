A funeral service in California is raising new questions about abortion 
and the separation of church and state. Jim hill has details. One 
by one, 54 small caskets were carried to a grave in Riverside, California, 
for a controversial service. Each casket held fetal remains from an 
abortion. The bodies of these 54 innocent victims welcome them into 
your presence. a group of 50 Christian Churches had arranged the funeral 
some 18 months after the fetuses were found, discarded near a southern 
California freeway. I believe that all children have a special place, 
and I don't think they should be discarded as trash. The fetuses had 
been held by the San Bernardino county coroner's office, while authorities 
investigated how the remains were illegally discarded. Now the American 
civil liberties union has threatened legal action against the coroner 
for releasing the remains to the church group. By the coroner giving 
up the fetuses for delivery for burial in a Christian ceremony, he 
has clearly violated the first amendment guarantee of separation of 
church and state. The ACLU cites a 1984 state court of appeal ruling. 
It blocked the Los Angeles district attorney from releasing unclaimed 
fetal remains for religious services, rather than for non-sectarian 
burial. At that time, the court said that proposed burial represented 
what it called political entanglement with religion. The San Bernardino 
coroner's office has not publicly commented on the issue. Since the 
funeral has already taken place, the ACLU is seeking a judgment that 
affirms the coroner acted wrongly and should not do so again. Jim
