Russian president Boris Yeltsin has cut short a visit to Kazakhstan 
after coming down with a reported respiratory infection that has again 
raised questions about his overall health. Russian news agencies quote 
the president's doctor as saying Mr. Yeltsin is suffering from bronchitis 
and has a slight fever. He arrived in Kazakhstan Monday after a visit 
to Uzbekistan, where he canceled a public appearance Sunday after 
he was seen stumbling and looked pale. The president has a history 
of health problems.
