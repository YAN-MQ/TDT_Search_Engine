High anxiety tonight as ericans who have today off return to the workplace. 
The market is highly volatile. So is the future. The global fears 
have hit home. Is the party over for the U.S. economy? It appears 
there's been a last-minute deal that may keep American bombers from 
going into action over Kosovo. The latest on the situation overseas. 
The president turns to the businesses of campaigning tonight. This 
evening our conversation with the two party chiefs on why impeachment 
might be riding on election. Good Monday evening.
