British Aerospace PLC is in merger talks with Daimler-Benz Aerospace 
of Germany and other European airplane makers, angling for a marriage 
that would create a giant European defense contractor to compete with 
leading U.S. firms, the two companies said Monday. In terms of size 
and ability to compete, the merger would put the companies ``in the 
same ballpark'' with U.S. giants Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Co., 
said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst for brokers Salomon Smith 
Barney in London. ``It's a very attractive outcome. It solves the 
scale problem, really,'' Cunningham said. The announcement after a 
year of negotiations involving the big airplane makers and governments 
in Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and Spain means a ``big bang'' 
merger of the British and German companies with the French firm Aerospatiale/Matra 
now seems unlikely, the Financial Times newspaper reported Monday. 
The main stumbling block, the newspaper said, was that Aerospatiale/Matra 
is still partly government-owned and progress toward full privatization 
has been slow. The British and German companies oppose having a government 
as a stakeholder in the new giant company, the paper said. Daimler-Benz 
Aerospace spokesman Rainer Ohler said that while no deadline has been 
set, the merger talks, which also involve the French, are now ``under 
great pressure.'' ``It is possible we would merge with one partner,'' 
Ohler added, in an apparent reference to the problem with the French 
company. In a more cautiously worded statement, British Aerospace 
said it ``has for some years been engaged in discussions about the 
possible restructuring of the European aerospace and defense industry.'' 
``These discussions naturally include talks with Dasa (Daimler-Benz 
Aerospace), but it is too early to say whether any of these discussions 
will result in definitive proposals,'' the statement added. The big 
European aircraft makers agreed in principle in March to seek a merger 
to compete with the Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The Financial Times 
said British Aerospace and Daimler-Benz Aerospace would merge initially, 
setting up a holding company probably registered as a Dutch company 
for tax reasons. ``However, there would be an invitation to Aerospatiale 
to be represented on its board, as a signal of its intent to be part 
of the group eventually,'' the newspaper said. Other European defense 
firms, including Saab AB in Sweden and Finmeccanica in Italy, could 
also join the merger when they are ready, the newspaper quoted an 
unidentified businessman involved in the negotiations as saying. The 
proposed merger between Lockheed Martin and Northrop Gumman and last 
year's merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp. has spurred 
the Europeans. ``The aim is to create one of the world's biggest aerospace/defense 
companies, so that in a few years' time we could buy one of the U.S. 
giants,'' the Financial Times quoted an unidentified negotiator as 
saying.
