In New York, a new play that depicts life in northern Ireland, has 
a special cast. It includes people who lived in the province through 
decades of violence. Cynthia Tornquist reports. Don't shoot! It's 
father fitzpatrick! A young boy has been -- "bin lids" chronicles 
the lives of people in west Belfast and the turmoil of the past 30 
years. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams attended the play's New York opening. 
Well I was moved by parts of it because it was part of what I had 
lived through, and it brought back memories. The play begins with 
internment in 1971 when the British army started arresting citizens 
involved in civil disobedience or who were believed to be tied to 
the Irish republican army. The play is written and performed by those 
who lived it. I know nothing about politics. I joined the I.R.A. to 
stop them beating and murdering my friends. I went to jail when I 
was 17. And I was charged with carrying weapons for the I.R.A. and 
I done five years in jail. The British army is on our streets, stopping 
and searching our sons and daughters. All I knew at 17 that my people 
were being oppressed. I didn't know anything else. I didn't know anything 
about politics. "bin lids" refers to the trash can tops that women 
of west Belfast would bang on the sidewalks to signal trouble. There's 
so much pain in this play. This is not play-acting for us. This is 
our lives. This is our lives. It's a snapshot -- a slice of 30 years 
of our lives. I don't know how we survived it. Anne Marie Adams is 
the sister-in-law of Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and a member of 
the cast. She says life has improved since Catholics and Protestants 
voted for a peace accord. Well we are gettin' a wee bit more of peace. 
It's a lot easier. The soldiers has been took off the street just 
recently. The ruc are still there, obviously. The peace process has 
brought a tentative hope to areas like west Belfast, and with it perhaps 
a need for plays like "bin lids." Gerry Adams believes there can be 
a brighter future for people in west Belfast than the one depicted 
in the play. The young people don't have to go through what their 
parents and grandparents went through. I think we have the potential 
to do that. Cynthia Tornquist, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
