Now, every American female long distance runner can circle a date 
on their Olympic calenders _ Feb. 26, 2000. That's when the U.S. Women's 
Olympic Marathon Trials returns here, the same city where the race 
was held before the Atlanta Games two years ago. Organizers announced 
the date Monday, about five months after the city was picked as the 
first to hold consecutive marathon trials. The three qualifiers will 
have about seven months to get ready for the Sydney Games, where the 
women's Olympic marathon will be run the final week of September. 
``We like to keep it far away from the Olympics,'' said Carol McLatchie, 
who headed the women's site selection committee for USA Track and 
Field. ``I've always been a big proponent of giving the athletes time 
to rest, and then come back and have a little bit of extra time to 
get over the cold or the flu or something like that.'' That may have 
been part of the problem in 1996, when Jenny Spangler _ a surprise 
champ after qualifying 61st coming into the trials _ couldn't finish 
the Atlanta marathon because of an achilles' injury. While the date 
is in place, the course is not. The traditional layout in South Carolina's 
capitol region has included long stretches of grueling hills and a 
steady elevation onto the city's main roads. McLatchie said she heard 
from competitors and officials that the city may be too hilly for 
Olympic preparation. ``We're trying to listen to them,'' McLatchie 
said. ``But if you're training to come to the Olympic trials and run 
in the Olympic marathon, you need as tough a course as you can get. 
Strength is an important factor.'' Russ Pate, the trials' race director, 
said his group might soften some rises. But no drastic changes will 
be made when the final plan comes out in several months, he said. 
Pate said the Carolina Marathon Association, overseeing the trials, 
has raised about 80 percent of the dlrs 800,000 in sponsorship money 
it bid for the event. In 1996, sponsor money flowed freely as Columbia 
was a key location in the Olympic trek. The women's marathon trials 
was the first competitive U.S. qualifying race run that year. The 
Olympic torch snaked through the state and several foreign teams finished 
pre-Olympic training in the Palmetto State. Pate and others weren't 
sure how fund raising would go this time. ``This was a different sell, 
but in some ways it was easier,'' Pate says, ``One reason may be that 
the last event was so successful.'' About 50,000 people turned out 
for the trials two years ago. A study from the University of South 
Carolina said the race had an economic impact of dlrs 2 million to 
the Midlands region. Pate said 84 runners have met the qualifying 
mark of 2 hours, 50 minutes. He said 20 runners, including Linda Somers-Smith 
and Gwyn Coogan _ the third- and fourth-place finishers from the 1996 
trials _ have surpassed the ``A'' standard of 2:42:00. Kristy Johnson's 
time of 2:32:37 in Sunday's Chicago Marathon left her the top qualifier 
so far. McLatchie says qualifying ends about a month before the trials. 
``We keep returning here and I keep thinking, the road to Sydney is 
running through Columbia,'' McLatchie said.
