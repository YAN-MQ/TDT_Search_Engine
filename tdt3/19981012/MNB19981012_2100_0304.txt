now to the land where money and politics merge. The White House and 
republicans spent most of their day today haggling over the federal 
budget already long overdue. The day's only croncreet action was another 
of those continuing resolutions, that short-term money keeps the government 
operating in this case just rough Wednesday. A deal doesn't seem certain. 
It's being blocked by everything from the defense budget, a mlt billion 
dollar affair to a one-Lane road in the alaskan wilderness. Gwen Ifill 
has the latest from the hill. The budget fight is about hool teachers 
and shaky global economies and 30 miles of Alaska Ian wilderness. 
Issues big and small at the standoff between Congress and the White 
House. Democrats using the extended gotiations as a platform for politically 
popular issues like education. We can reach across the political divisions 
here in Washington. To take the steps we must to reduce class size 
to hire more teachers, to modernize our classrooms. Republicans say 
they've already agreed to White House requests for school spending 
but disagree on where the money should go. They dismissed white plaints 
with one word -- politics. It's time for to us put progress ahead 
of polling. But republicans are trying to force action on legislation 
they couldn't get passed either. Like nearly $30 million for a one-Lane 
road connecting to remote alaskaan towns. The chairman of the prorkses 
committee, over the objections of environmentalists who say the road 
will hurt wildlife. That is a backdoor attack. And an attack on our 
democratic process. Anti--- vironmental issues should be debated in 
the light of day. But Don young says the road will save lives. If 
the administration wants to shut down the government over a little 
road 22 miles long, seven miles in the refuge, they ought to do it. 
As meetings with senior White House staff continued throughout the 
day, lawmakers wrestled with $500 billion in other details, including 
$18 billion for the international monetary fund. One thing became 
clear today, appearances do matter. En the president called in a do-nothing 
Congress, lawmakers began working overtime. When republicans complained 
that the president was flying off in the middle of a budget crisis 
to campaign, he cut the trip in half. Gwen Ifill, NBC news, the capitol.
