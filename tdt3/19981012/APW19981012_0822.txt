BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke will leave 
Belgrade on Monday for Brussels to brief NATO envoys on the results 
of his talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, a U.S. source 
said. In Moscow, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told Russia's 
Interfax news agency said Milosevic agreed to allow a 1,500-member 
international observer force in Kosovo to verify compliance with U.N. 
Security Council demands to end the crackdown in the majority Albanian 
province. Interfax said Russia was prepared to provide aircraft to 
the force. The verification force was believed to have been the major 
obstacle to a deal to prevent NATO airstrikes. The U.S. source, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said Holbrooke wanted to brief NATO ambassadors 
on the results of his talks with Milosevic aimed at persuading him 
to accept U.N. demands for ending the crackdown in Kosovo. Ambassadors 
from the 16 NATO members were meeting Monday at headquarters in Brussels, 
Belgium, to consider whether to approve an activation order, the last 
military step before airstrikes can be launched. The source indicated 
Holbrooke had made enough progress that he needed to update NATO personally. 
A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an activation 
order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in Kosovo, where 
hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 275,000 uprooted 
since February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels. The order would 
transfer the command over the airplanes and military equipment necessary 
for an airstrike to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize 
its deployment over Yugoslavia.
