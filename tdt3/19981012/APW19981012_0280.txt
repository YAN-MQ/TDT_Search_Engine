Philippine President Joseph Estrada, on his first overseas trip, met 
Monday with Singapore's leaders and called for more cooperation between 
the once-estranged countries. ``My decision to visit Singapore first 
was right ... as our relations are very important,'' Estrada said. 
He said he and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong shared ``a strong 
commitment'' to strengthening cooperation between the two countries. 
Goh also urged Estrada to attend a meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders 
in Malaysia despite the arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister 
Anwar Ibrahim, a Philippine official said. Estrada, who considers 
Anwar a friend, said in a radio interview Saturday that we was still 
deciding whether to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum 
meeting in November because of the treatment Anwar has received. Goh 
``said he understood the president's feeling, but urged him to attend, 
saying it was important for the region,'' said the Philippine official, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. Estrada is to meet Tuesday afternoon 
with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, who has also expressed concern 
over Anwar's arrest. Estrada, on his first trip abroad since assuming 
the presidency in June, was also scheduled to deliver a keynote address 
Tuesday at the East Asia Economic Summit sponsored by the World Economic 
Forum. Singapore is the Philippines' third-largest trading partner, 
with total trade reaching dlrs 3.8 billion last year. Singapore also 
is the fourth-largest importer of Philippine products and an important 
investor. Estrada said the two countries enjoy a balanced trade relationship, 
adding that Philippine businessmen are now investing in Singapore 
in larger numbers to take advantage of Singapore's ``dynamic competitiveness.'' 
In a meeting Monday with Singaporean and Philippine businessmen, Estrada, 
who won the presidency by appealing to the poor and the disenchanted, 
reiterated his promise to transform the country economically without 
neglecting the poor. ``We are pro-market, pro-investment, pro-competition,'' 
he said, ``but we will not forget safety nets for the marginalized 
sectors of the society.'' Estrada on Sunday met with some of about 
100,000 Filipino women who work as domestic helpers in Singapore and 
praised them as saviors of the Philippine economy. Overseas Filipino 
workers are expected to send home more than dlrs 6 billion this year 
through official channels, and much more through other means. Relations 
between the two countries were hurt in 1995, when Singapore convicted 
Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino maid, of killing another Filipino maid 
and a young Singaporean boy she cared for. Singapore insists Contemplacion 
confessed, but many Filipinos believe she was a victim of injustice. 
Mass protests forced the Philippine government to withdraw its ambassador, 
and Singapore responded by doing the same. Relations were normalized 
in 1996 with the exchange of new ambassadors.
