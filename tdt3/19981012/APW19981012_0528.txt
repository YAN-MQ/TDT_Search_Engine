All U.S. officials were ordered out of the Serb-held half of Bosnia 
on Monday, ahead of possible NATO military intervention in neighboring 
Yugoslavia. The precautions were prompted by the worsening crisis 
in Yugoslavia, which faces NATO airstrikes if it continues its military 
crackdown in the embattled province of Kosovo. A decision on airstrikes 
is expected in the next few days. ``All official Americans have been 
ordered to withdraw from the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and to remain outside the Republika Srpska until further notice,'' 
said a travel warning issued by the U.S. Embassy here. ``The U.S. 
Embassy strongly advises non-official U.S. citizens to leave the Republika 
Srpska now,'' the advisory added. It said the U.S. State Department 
is expected to issue a revised travel warning for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
later Monday. It would warn U.S. citizens of ``increased danger'' 
in the Serb-held half of Bosnia due to potential ``retaliation against 
U.S. citizens and interests as members of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) are considering military action against neighboring 
Serbia and Montenegro.'' Due to the American holiday Columbus Day, 
no one was available for comment at the U.S. Embassy or the biggest 
U.S. reconstruction agency in Bosnia, the U.S. Agency for International 
Development. Yugoslav officials have vowed their military will retaliate 
in case of any NATO actions. Serb hard-liners in Yugoslavia and Bosnia 
are united by the goal of creating a greater Serbia, and Western officials 
fear retaliation could spread into Bosnia. There are hundreds, if 
not thousands, of American civilians working in Bosnia for different 
agencies, humanitarian organizations and reconstruction companies, 
and they would be easy prey for retaliation. A less likely target 
would be NATO-led peacekeepers, due to their strength and higher security 
standards. There are some 8,500 American soldiers in the 36,000-strong 
multinational peace force in Bosnia.
