The FBI opens its national DNA database tomorrow. The system unites 
the DNA databases of the 50 states. It will enable police to compare 
genetic material from suspects and crime scenes across the country. 
Advocates say the system could significantly reduce rape and other 
crimes by helping to catch repeat offenders. Critics say it unfairly 
targets people based on past criminal acts. By law, only the DNA of 
convicted criminals can be included in the database. Access will be 
restricted to law enforcement organizations.
