NBC news "in depth." Tonight, an apparent hate crime that has shocked 
the nation. Tonight President Clinton spoke out about the brutal crime 
that claimed the life of a young gay man in Wyoming. Crimes of hate 
and crimes of violence cannot be tolerated in our country. In our 
shock and grief, one thing must remain clear, hate and prejudice are 
not American values. Tonight, in laramie, Wyoming, NBC's George Lewis 
begins our "in depth" reporting. With the death this morning of Matthew 
shepard, his two suspected assailants will now be charged with murder 
in the first degree. It was last Wednesday when a passerby found shepard 
tied to this fence near laramie, Wyoming, badly beaten, left for dead. 
Last night, at a candlelight vigil, shepard, who was openly gay, was 
remembered as a victim of a hate crime. And what about the suspects? 
22-year-old Aaron James McKinney and 21-year-old Russell Arthur Henderson 
are two troubled high school dropouts from broken homes. Their police 
records show a long list of minor offenses and one burglary for Henderson. 
McKinney and his girlfriend, Kristin price, lived in this mobile home 
on the outskirts of laramie with their young child. Henderson and 
his girlfriend, chastity pasley, lived in this laramie apartment house. 
Both women have been charged as accessories to the crime. Shaundra 
arcuby, a former girlfriend of Henderson, says she is shocked that 
the gentle young man she knew now faces charges of murder. We dated 
for about a year. Never once was there any violence. Even recently 
that we've become friends, better friends again, never any violence 
towards me or anyone that I was with. And she said Henderson never 
showed any signs of homophobia, that someone told her he even had 
a few friends who were gay. I talked to another friend of ours, who 
said he had gay friends and it wasn't ever a thing of, "I'm not going 
to be their friend," or, "I want to beat them up," or anything like 
that. Henderson and McKinney will be arraigned on the murder charges 
tomorrow. If convicted of the brutal slaying, they could face the 
death penalty. George Lewis, NBC news, laramie, Wyoming.
