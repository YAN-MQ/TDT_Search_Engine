With Germany's newly elected government not yet in charge, Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's outgoing Cabinet was expected Monday to back possible 
NATO airstrikes in Kosovo. Germany's role in any attack has been in 
question since the left's election victory last month. To avoid leaving 
a political vacuum, Outgoing Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said last 
week that the Cabinet session will approve a NATO order authorizing 
alliance military commanders to launch airstrikes. Kohl's government 
has also offered NATO 14 Tornado warplanes, but their deployment _ 
a divisive issue for the incoming government _ remains uncertain. 
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder met Kohl at the chancellery Monday 
before the Cabinet session to coordinate policy. Kohl formally remains 
in power until Schroeder takes office Oct. 27. U.S. President Bill 
Clinton held talks with Schroeder in Washington on Friday and said 
afterwards that the chancellor-elect had signaled Germany's support 
for the so-called activation order. But sending German warplanes into 
combat requires a vote of parliament, and the newly elected lower 
house won't convene until Oct. 26. The old parliament could be called 
into session, but that is seen as politically awkward. The Greens 
party, Schroeder's future coalition partner, approves NATO airstrikes 
but has rejected German participation in airstrikes without a clear 
United Nations mandate. Angelika Beer, the party's defense expert, 
warned the old government in a newspaper interview published Monday 
against pre-empting a decision on German participation in airstrikes. 
Leaders of the Social Democrats and Greens were meeting later Monday 
to hash out common foreign policy goals, one of the toughest topics 
in forming a new center-left government.
