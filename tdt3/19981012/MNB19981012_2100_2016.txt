We are about to show why you there are new concerns about the leader 
of Russia tonight. Boris Yeltsin in a series of public appearances 
appeared to be in very ill health, at times very frail, unstable. 
And because of his condition he has cut short a trip to central Asia 
today. Here it is, one point Russian president actually lost his balance 
while standing up. Aides rushed to his side before he steadied himself. 
Another appearance he seemed more than slightly disoriented. He struggled 
with health problems, of course, since his heart by-pass surgery. 
He continues to deny any alcohol overconsumption rumors or health 
mors. Aides say he's merely suffering om a bad case of bronchitis, 
coming at a time when his full attention is needed on things like 
the situation in Kosovo.
