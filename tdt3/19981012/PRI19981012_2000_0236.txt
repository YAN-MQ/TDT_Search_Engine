Representatives of the Colombian government have met with the high 
command of the country's second largest guerrilla group. The aim is 
to set up formal peace talks to end 34 years of civil war. From Bogota, 
Quill Lawrence reports. The meeting took place in the mountains of 
northwestern Colombia. Two captured rebel leaders were allowed to 
temporarily leave a maximum-security prison to attend the meeting. 
Members of the Colombian government and Congress, as well as important 
civil groups attended the talks. The National Liberation Army or ELN 
is a Marxist guerrilla group, which numbers over 2000. It was founded 
by a radical Spanish priest in the 1960's with the stated aim of directing 
social justice and land reform. In recent years the ELN has relied 
on kidnapping and extortion to fund its war effort. The rebels have 
also targeted the oil industry, blowing up Colombia's oil pipeline 
about once a week. Preliminary talks began earlier this year in Spain 
and Germany. But Colombia's war continues to claim about 6000 casualties 
annually. For NPR News, this is Quill Lawrence in Bogota.
