The Clinton administration is asking a full appeals court to overturn 
an August ruling that gave new rights and consumer protections to 
six million Medicare beneficiaries in health maintenance organizations. 
Advocates for the elderly had hailed the earlier ruling, by a three-judge 
panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, 
as an important victory. The panel said that decisions by Medicare 
HMOs amounted to government actions, so that patients denied specific 
services were entitled to ``due process of law,'' including hearings 
and other protections. But in seeking to overturn the ruling, the 
Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday that the government 
should not be held accountable for the actions of HMOs that sign contracts 
with Medicare. ``These are predominantly medical decisions that turn 
on independent professional judgment,'' the Clinton administration 
said. ``They are not in any way dictated by the federal government.'' 
For the last two years, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore 
have been waging a campaign to promote ``patients' rights.'' In challenging 
the appeals court decision, the Administration invoked many of the 
arguments made by HMOs and health insurance companies that oppose 
new Federal laws, rules and standards. Just as HMOs argue that patients 
should not be able to sue them for the actions of their doctors, so 
the administration argues that the government should not be held accountable 
for the decisions of Medicare HMOs to deny care to the elderly. Just 
as HMOs try to fend off new Federal regulations as onerous and costly, 
so the administration opposes court-imposed standards for patients' 
rights. In its legal brief, the administration complains that the 
appeals court imposed ``highly detailed, burdensome and, in many instances, 
wholly unnecessary procedural requirements on HMO decision-making.'' 
The dispute arises from a class action lawsuit filed in Arizona on 
behalf of the six million Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs around the 
country. Judge Alfredo Marquez of the U.S. District Court in Tucson 
ruled for the patients in October 1996. Health Secretary Donna Shalala, 
then filed an appeal, saying the judge had usurped her authority and 
gone further than necessary in protecting patients' rights. In August, 
a three-judge panel of the appeals court issued a unanimous ruling 
for the patients and against Shalala. The panel said the decisions 
of a Medicare HMO amounted to ``government action'' because the HMO 
was operating as ``a governmental proxy.'' Moreover, it said, Medicare 
officials have not lived up to their duty to guarantee due process 
of law, as required by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Shalala 
said the panel's decision was ``patently incorrect,'' because ``Medicare 
does not superintend medical decisions concerning the appropriate 
treatment of a beneficiary.'' She asked the full appeals court to 
overturn the panel's decision. Shalala complained that the ruling 
by Judge Marquez would provide Medicare patients with ``the full panoply 
of hearing and appeal rights for even minor disagreements over reductions 
or changes in medical treatment.'' In the last year, Clinton has repeatedly 
urged Congress to pass legislation setting detailed standards for 
HMOs and other health plans. But in contending that the government 
should not be held responsible for the performance of Medicare HMOs, 
the administration said, ``Great care must be taken to avoid inappropriately 
extending the reach of federal law and judicial power.''
