Congressional leaders are trying to reach agreement on spending measures 
in the federal budget, but a chief negotiator says a deal might not 
be reached until midweek. They have more to iron out than just money. 
White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles is meeting with republican 
leaders to discuss policy issues, like the 2000 census, abortion and 
new rules on organ transplants. To avoid a shutdown, the house is

48 hours and President Clinton says he'll sign it.
