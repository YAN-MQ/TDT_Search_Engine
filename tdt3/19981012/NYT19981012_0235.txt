The most surprising accessory seen so far on the spring runways is 
the reinvented fanny pack. The trend started in New York with Helmut 
Lang, who slung a holster-style bag around models' waists and attached 
it to the thigh. A raft of variations have been seen here. In Dolce 
&AMP; Gabbana's D&AMP;G show, the models wore zippered pockets in 
clear plastic on their belts. At Prada, bags rode in back on a belt 
around the waist or hips while a tiny purse was strapped around one 
model's arm. Missoni showed bags on belts around the hips, and Trussardi 
had double bags on the back of belts. Tiny purses circled the wrist 
at Versace. Bottega Veneta had several versions, including a fold-over 
bag on a belt that can be converted to a shoulder bag, a holster that 
goes around the shoulder and across the body, and a sizable flat bag 
to wear around the hips like an apron.
