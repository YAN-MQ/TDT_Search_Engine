New York Yankees slugger Darryl Strawberry will have to watch Game 
6 of the American League Championship from his hospital room as he 
recovers from colon cancer surgery. ``His spirits are good, he's gaining 
strength, he has no fever, and his blood counts are normal,'' a statement 
from Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center said Monday. ``He is not 
yet able to eat normally and therefore will remain in the hospital 
for several more days.'' The hospital declined further comment. A 
16-inch portion of the outfielder's large intestine was removed during 
a three-hour operation Oct. 3 to get rid of a 2 1/2-inch (6.35-cm) 
cancerous tumor that nearly obstructed his intestine. The Yankees, 
leading the best-of-7 series 3-2, play the Cleveland Indians in Game 
6 of the American League Championship Series Tuesday night. His teammates 
have stitched Strawberry's No. 39 on the back of their baseball caps.
