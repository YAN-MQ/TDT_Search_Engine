When fighting started eight months ago, she stopped going to the cafes. 
Stayed home every night with her parents. Too sad, too depressed. 
Now, with NATO threatening airstrikes against the Serbs, Jehona is 
out every night. Drinking with her friends. Nervous but excited, too. 
At last: It might be the end. Cafes form the social heart of Pristina, 
the capital of Kosovo province. Like everything else, they are segregated: 
Serbs have their cafes, Albanians have theirs. And these days, the 
Albanian cafes are packed with young people like Jehona, not celebrating 
exactly but more blowing off steam, soothing their nerves and waiting 
for something to happen. ``Everyone is going out,'' says Jehona, 25, 
her brown eyes shining as she lights a cigarette and waits for her 
beer. ``It's crazy! Maybe they're drinking to forget, or going out 
to see friends. Everyone is waiting for D-Day. Maybe tonight is the 
last night.'' ``If I die, so what? I had a beautiful 22 years living 
in this repression,'' says her friend Ilir, laughing. They hope NATO 
will pressure President Slobodan Milosevic into giving independence 
to Kosovo, a southern province in the Serbian republic that dominates 
Yugoslavia. They also hope that if NATO drops bombs, Serbs won't attack 
them in the streets as they say they will. ___ Serb cafe owner Predrag 
Ilic unfolds a large black leather wallet, takes out a pistol and 
lays it on the glossy, chrome-rimmed bar. Next, he reaches behind 
the bar and pulls out a grenade, lays it next to the gun. Sure, he 
has Albanian neighbors. Plenty of Serbs in Pristina do. They can't 
help it. More Serbs live here than anywhere else in Kosovo, 60,000 
out of the population of 200,000. The two groups exist on top of each 
other in the congested, hilly streets. But the mingling stops there. 
Separate bars. Separate stores. Separate schools. Albanians and Serbs 
even have separate taxi services. What would happen if an Albanian, 
even one of his neighbors, stepped into Ilic's cafe? He draws a finger 
across his neck. ``Albanians like me,'' he says. ``But I want to kill 
them all.'' While ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, 
many of the Serbs are armed to the teeth, in keeping with Balkans 
tradition. And they are not shy about using those guns. Weddings, 
elections, even basketball and soccer victories are celebrated with 
volleys of gunfire out of apartment and car windows. And those are 
happy occasions. If the Serbs are bombed, they make no secret they 
will go into the streets to seek revenge the instant NATO acts. Serb 
accountant Miso Perovic, wearing jeans, was relaxing at a Serb cafe 
Sunday when a question about NATO arose. His answer was matter-of-fact. 
``I have four rifles,'' he said. ``Whatever happens, I'll go straight 
to kill the first Albanian I find.'' The 30-year-old Serb cop sitting 
next to him was no less sure what he'll do when the first bombs fall. 
``My grandfather rescued American pilots in 1944,'' said the policeman, 
who gave his name as Stevo. ``I'm going to kill the first American 
pilot I can lay my hands on.'' ___ Albanians aren't the only ones 
worried. Foreigners are also a target, their situation worsening by 
the day. Diplomats and humanitarian organizations have been packed 
and ready to go for days, and many are already leaving. On Monday, 
American, Russian and European observers monitoring Kosovo over the 
last few months pulled out for neighboring Macedonia. One coming flashpoint 
of Serb anger is the Grand Hotel, where journalists from several NATO 
countries are staying: Italians, Britons, Americans and others. Every 
night, a crowd of drunks gathers outside. They scream obscentities 
at the journalists inside, threatening to kill them and smash their 
cars. Eventually they are chased away by official and secret Serb 
police, stationed at the hotel to keep an eye on the foreigners. One 
blond Dutch journalist even went so far as to buy a bottle of black 
hair dye so he could attract less attention on the street. ___ There 
was a sense of hostility in Kosovo even before 1989, when Milosevic 
revoked Kosovo's autonomy and ethnic Albanians started talking about 
independence. The separate Serb and Albanian societies moved apart, 
and the anger between the two sides grew hotter and hotter until it 
exploded into war this year. Now NATO threats, designed to force Milosevic 
to give the Albanians back their autonomy, have strained this divided 
society to the breaking point. ``We were mixed before,'' says a 46-year-old 
Serb schoolteacher who asks to remain anonymous, shaking her head. 
``But after all this, I don't know if we could be together again.''
