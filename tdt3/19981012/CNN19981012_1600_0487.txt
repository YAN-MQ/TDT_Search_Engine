Documents recently made public show that for decades the FBI had concerns 
about a thinker named Marx. Not Karl, but Groucho. The agency kept 
detailed files on the wise-cracking comedian from the liberal causes 
he supported to his jokes. An informant for the FBI alleged he was 
a communist. A California professor of history who acquired the papers 
through the freedom of information act says the FBI found no evidence 
Marx ever belonged to the communist party.
