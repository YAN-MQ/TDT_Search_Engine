When fighting started in Kosovo eight months ago, Jehona stopped going 
out to the cafes at night. She was too sad, too depressed. Now, with 
NATO threatening airstrikes against the Serbs for their crackdown 
in Kosovo, the 25-year-old Jehona goes out drinking with her friends 
every night. She is nervous but excited: At last, it might be the 
end. Cafes form the social heart of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo 
province. Like everything else, they are segregated: Serbs have their 
cafes, ethnic Albanians have theirs. And these days, the ethnic Albanian 
cafes are packed with young people like Jehona who are blowing off 
steam, soothing their nerves and waiting for something to happen. 
``Everyone is going out,'' says Jehona, her brown eyes shining as 
she lights her cigarette. ``It's crazy! Maybe they're drinking to 
forget, or going out to see friends. Everyone is waiting for D-Day. 
Maybe tonight is the last night.'' ``If I die, so what? I had a beautiful 
22 years living in this repression,'' says her friend Ilir, laughing. 
Neither would give their full name. They hope NATO will pressure President 
Slobodan Milosevic into giving independence to Kosovo, a southern 
province in Serbia, the republic that dominates Yugoslavia. They also 
hope that if NATO drops bombs, Serbs won't attack them in the streets. 
The talk around town is that Serbs will seek revenge on ethnic Albanians 
the instant NATO acts. ___ Serb cafe owner Predrag Ilic takes out 
a pistol and lays it on the glossy, chrome-rimmed bar. Next, he reaches 
behind the bar, pulls out a grenade and lays it next to the gun. Sure, 
he has ethnic Albanian neighbors. Plenty of Serbs in Pristina do. 
More Serbs live here than anywhere else in Kosovo, 60,000 out of the 
city population of 200,000. The two groups exist on top of each other 
in the congested, hilly streets. But the mingling stops there. Separate 
bars. Separate stores. Separate schools. Ethnic Albanians and Serbs 
even have separate taxi services. What would happen if an ethnic Albanian, 
even one of his neighbors, stepped into Ilic's cafe? He draws a finger 
across his neck. ``Albanians like me,'' he says. ``But I want to kill 
them all.'' ___ Ethnic Albanians aren't the only ones worried. Foreigners 
are also a target, their situation worsening by the day. Diplomats 
and humanitarian organizations have been packed and ready to go for 
days, and many are leaving. On Monday, American, Russian and European 
observers who have been monitoring Kosovo over the last few months 
pulled out for neighboring Macedonia. A flashpoint for Serb anger 
is the Grand Hotel, where journalists from several NATO countries 
are staying: Italians, Britons, Americans and others. Every night, 
a crowd of drunks gathers outside. They scream obscenities at the 
journalists inside, threatening to kill them and smash their cars. 
Eventually they are chased away by official and secret Serb police, 
who are stationed at the hotel to watch the foreigners. One blond 
Dutch journalist even went so far as to buy a bottle of black hair 
dye so he could attract less attention on the street. ____ There was 
a sense of hostility in Kosovo even before 1989, when Milosevic revoked 
the province's autonomy and ethnic Albanians started talking about 
independence. The separate Serb and ethnic Albanian societies moved 
apart, and the anger between the two sides grew hotter and hotter 
until it exploded into war this year. Now NATO threats, designed to 
force Milosevic to give the ethnic Albanians back their autonomy, 
have strained this divided society to the breaking point. ``We were 
mixed before,'' says a 46-year-old Serb teacher who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. ``But I don't know if we could be together again.''
