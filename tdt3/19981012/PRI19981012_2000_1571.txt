Global markets bounce back. I'm Richard Griffith at the Business Desk 
in New York. There has been something of a recovery in markets worldwide 
today. As fears recede about a downturn in the economy here in the 
US. Nonetheless, as Liz George reports, the underlying nerves remain. 
It's been a day of stockmarket confidence. In Hong Kong and Japan, 
shares climbed more than 5%, amid signs of continued progress towards 
banking reforms in Tokyo. And this, together with a steadier dollar 
has helped ease concerns over the economy. In New York, while the 
Columbus Day holiday meant subdued trading, the Dow Jones followed 
the upward trend. But some say, we're not out of the woods yet. The 
global crisis looks likely to claim another victim. The investment 
bank, Merrill Lynch is reported to be preparing to announce 3000-job 
losses world wide, because of the current market turmoil. And the 
newly formed financial services giant, Citigroup is subject to intense 
speculation over possible cuts too. Both are expected to give traders 
another bout of the jitters. The World, I'm Liz George, in New York.
