Egypt's foreign minister has completed a lightning round of shuttle 
diplomacy between Turkey and Syria and says he now has hopes their 
dispute will not erupt into open conflict. Amre Moussa met early Monday 
with Turkish leaders to relay a Syrian message, then flew to Syria 
with Turkey's response. In Turkey, foreign minister Ismail Cem says 
it appears that Syria may be moving toward meeting Turkish demands 
that it stop supporting Turkish Kurd rebels. But Mr. Cem said Syrian 
action is more important than words. Syria has denied supporting the 
rebels, but Turkey rejects the denial.
