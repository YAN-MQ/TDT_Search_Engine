U.S. special envoy Laktar Brachemi is preparing to enter Afghanistan 
to meet Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar in a bid to diffuse the 
Taliban-Iran crisis. UN officials say despite the danger, Mr. Brachemi 
has given permission to go Mullah Omar's headquarters in Kandahar. 
Some 50 Iranians are believed to be held captive there. Iran is demanding 
their freedom and has massed troops near the Afghan border. Mr. Brachemi 
has already met with the Iranian leaders in Teheran and Taliban officials 
in Islamabad, Pakistan.
