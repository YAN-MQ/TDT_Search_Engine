In South Texas, six people were killed today when they were run over 
by a freight train. Investigators are trying to learn why they were 
on the tracks. Jim Bell reports from member station KUHF in Houston. 
This tragedy happened in the Rio Grande river valley, about 60 miles 
north of Brownsville, Texas. State police and Union Pacific Railroad 
officials' say the six people were lying between the tracks and may 
have been sleeping, when the freight train pulling 105 cars passed 
over them. Officials are still trying to determine who the victims 
were and how they came to be on the tracks. A spokesman for the railroad 
says, "by the time the train crew saw them, it was too late. Because 
a train that long takes several miles to stop." The spokesman also 
says counselors are spending time with the crewmembers today. For 
NPR News, I'm Jim Bell in Houston.
