South African stocks were mostly higher Monday, amid gains in global 
markets and expectations that interest rates could decline further. 
The benchmark Johannesburg All Share Index rose 151 points to close 
at 5213, its biggest gain in two weeks. The industrial index rose 
207 points at 5755. The All Gold Index fell sharply, however, losing 
71 points to close at 1192.
