The Indians have their backs to the wall as the alcs resumes tomorrow 
in New York. Cleveland looks to Charles nagy to keep their season 
alive. I know it's a big game. You gotta go out and just do your job.

He mixes his pitches well. He's got good movement on his fastball. 
I think above anything else, he's just a competitor.
