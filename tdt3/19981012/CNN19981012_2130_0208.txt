Three U.S. researchers are the latest recipients of one of the most 
prestigious awards in science -- the nobel prize for medicine. Robert 
furchgott, Louis ignarro, and ferid murad are all professors of pharmacology. 
Furchgott says he's surprised by the honor. He and his colleagues 
won the award for their discovery that the body uses nitric oxide 
to regulate blood vessels. Their work has implications in the treatment 
of heart disease, shock, and possibly cancer. It also helped lead 
to the development of Viagra.
