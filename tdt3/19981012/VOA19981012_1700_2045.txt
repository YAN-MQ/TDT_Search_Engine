President Clinton has spoken by telephone with the Israeli and Palestinian 
leaders as he prepares to host them at a peace-making summit in the 
United States this week. The White House says the president tried 
to identify the areas of agreement and disagreement in his separate 
talks with Yasser Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Clinton's spokesman 
says the real question is whether the leaders are ready to make the 
hard decisions to make peace a reality.
