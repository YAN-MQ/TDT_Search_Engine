I'm Anthony Keith James and this is "Headline Sports." First up, the 
NFL -- where week six comes to a close tonight, when the jaguars put 
their undefeated record on the line against the 3-1 dolphins. Jacksonville 
has won 17 of 19 at home. Jacksonville has got one of the best teams 
in the league, and a team that a lot of people predict to go to the 
Super Bowl. They're undefeated, playing at home on Monday night, two 
weeks to prepare, so they got a lot of these things going for them. 
They are very quick. We've played quick teams before and have had 
success against them, so hopefully this will be the same type of thing. 
You know, we respect their defense, no question, they're a very good 
football team.
