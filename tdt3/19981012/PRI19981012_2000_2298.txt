Get your I M Bic pentameter right here ladies and gentleman. Today's 
Geography Quiz takes you to a Scandinavian capitol for the world's 
first Poetry Olympics. This city is no stranger to the regular Olympics. 
It hosted the summer games in 1912, and recently made a bid to host 
the games in 2004. Although it lost that bid, it did manage to land 
the Inaugural Poetry Olympics. That's not surprising for a city that 
is also no stranger to diversification. Some poetic names from our 
mystery location are Olaf Van Dallen, Nobel Prize winner Ferner Nofhidenstan 
and Dan Andersson. Here's another clue, the city which is more than 
seven centuries old is the home of the Nobel Institute, which will 
announce the winners of the Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics 
tomorrow. Well, we'll have the answer to today's Geography Quiz, and 
we'll also meet one of the competitors in the Poetry Olympics in our 
mystery city in just a few minutes.
