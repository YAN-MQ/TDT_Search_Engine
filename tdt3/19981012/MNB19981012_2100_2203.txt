And another note on this the most recent F.B.I. figures show hate 
crimes rising and fast. Now at a rate of 8800 hate crime incidents 
per year. Most are racially motivated. The rest are targeted because 
of their religion, sexual orientation or ethnic or gin. With more 
on this story, here is justice correspondent Pete Williams. The usual 
image of organized hate. Neo-Nazi skinheads who target, blacks, gays 
and Jews. Scott brith was group for seven years. He knows people who 
beat up gays for the bragging rights. Some do it to earn their red 
laces a symbol of them sheding blood for their race. Surprisingly 
experts say nearly hall hate crimes about not committed by members 
of organized hate groups. They're young people often acting spontaneously. 
Most hate crime offenders, about 80% are white men in more than half 
the cases, they're less than 23 years old. Mat jort of crimes are 
committed by youthful thrill seekers, not hard core haters. Researchers 
say anti-gay attackers are scomperblely brutal like these Texas men 
convicted of killing a gayman stabbed 30 times in this Van. A hate 
crime explore says when young peam tack in groups, they can be savage, 
act being like a mob fueled by hate. There's no end to the violence. 
With other crimes you get someone's wallet or chain, they leave. With 
hate crimes the violence just escalates without end. Some offenders 
attack for a different reason in response to what they view as a threat, 
like racial integration of the neighborhood or in the case of anti-gay 
violee aper seefed sexual advance. There's even a name for it. Homosexual 
panic defense, arguing an unwanted advance triggered uncontrollable 
rage. It doesn't often work in court.
