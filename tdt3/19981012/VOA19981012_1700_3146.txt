Negotiations between Australia's Quantas Airways and its pilots broke 
down Monday over new roster changes which would give pilots less rest 
time between flights. Quantas is proposing a new roster on its Perth 
to South Africa route which would cut pilots' rest time from 34 to 
21 hours. The pilots say the new schedule would be very tiring and 
result in reduced safety for planes flying that route.
