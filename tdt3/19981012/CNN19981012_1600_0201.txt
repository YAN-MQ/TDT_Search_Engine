A gay University of Wyoming student brutally beaten last week died 
this morning from his injuries. Matthew shepard was pistol-whipped 
and tied to a fence post in laramie in freezing conditions. He was 
discovered 12 hours later. Shepard's attack was denounced by gay rights 
group as a hate crime. The 21-year-old student had severe head injuries 
and remained in critical condition on life support until his death. 
President Clinton is among those expressing outrage over the attack. 
He's urging Congress to pass tougher hate crime legislation. Crimes 
of hate and crimes of violence cannot be tolerated in our country. 
And our shock and grief, one thing must remain clear. Hate and prejudice 
are not American values. The public outrage in laramie and all across 
America today echoes what we heard at the White House conference on 
hate crimes last year. There is something we can do about this. Congress 
needs to pass our tough hate crimes legislation. Before shepard's 
death two suspects -- Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney -- faced 
charges of attempted murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery. Authorities 
plan to upgrade the charges to first-degree murder. The girlfriends 
of the suspects have been charged with being accessories after the 
fact.
