The commandant himself summoned them, so the inmates walked briskly 
across the dusty prison yard, these 75 men jailed here because they 
had illegally trimmed their beards. Grooming can be a man's undoing 
in Afghanistan. As the ruling Taliban interpret the Koran, an adult 
male is obliged not only to grow a beard but also to leave the hairy 
underbrush unmolested by scissors. Scruffiness is required by law. 
Fidel Castro would be considered appropriately whiskered; Pavarotti 
would not. Two months ago the Taliban began getting tough on trimmed 
beards in Kabul, the capital. Patrols from the General Department 
for the Preservation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice now snatch violators 
from the bazaars and bring them six miles to Pul-i-Charki, a notorious 
prison where earlier governments made sadistic use of electrodes and 
hot stoves. The commandant, Ghiasuddin Mazhari, 30, a well-muscled 
man wearing a white long-tailed turban, took a seat on a rock near 
a tomato patch. The prisoners, like children at story hour, sat cross-legged 
before him in the dirt. An aggressive sun basted everyone with sweat. 
``These men are brought here for 10 days, given religious instruction 
and then released,'' Mazhari said with a sweep of his hand. ``We do 
not treat them harshly. As you can see, in this area there are no 
locks on the gates, and men can move freely about.'' The 22-year-old 
prison has fallen into disrepair, with many of its iron doors torn 
from their hinges. Nothing prevented these men from escape except 
the automatic weapons and grenade launchers of the guards. A prisoner 
named Mohammed Arif, 34, volunteered to speak first. The owner of 
a small pharmacy, he had a thick, raven beard, and his guilt was as 
plain as this hair on his face, all of it barbered to an incriminating 
evenness. ``We have been brought here to be informed that the Prophet 
Mohammed, peace be upon him, had a beard and that as proud Muslims 
we also should have them,'' Arif said, as if reciting some memorized 
oratory. ``We are treated here as guests and brothers,'' he said, 
``and we are all under the guidance of our teachers, who instruct 
us in the ways of Islam. The beard is a necessary part of every man, 
and we display it as a way to propagate our faith.'' The commandant 
nodded his approval, as did several prisoners. A second inmate then 
used this opportunity to describe the spirituality of the prison's 
daily routine. ``We get up for prayers at 4:30 a.m., perform our ablutions 
together and recite the Koran,'' said Samin Jan, also a shopkeeper. 
``Then we sit like brothers and have proper tea and breakfast before 
spending the rest of the day in learning and prayers.'' Jan had a 
shamefully modest amount of facial hair for a man of 34. His excuse, 
like that offered by many of the beard-deficient, was recent travel 
out of the country. Afghanistan's Islamic neighbors Iran and Pakistan 
have a more relaxed attitude about whiskers. To many there, a clean 
shave is a mark of prosperity and sophistication. ``I didn't want 
people to think I was a refugee,'' Jan said. As others spoke up apologetically, 
it was impossible to know how much of what they said was cautious 
performance and how much genuine penitence. Faiz Mohammed, 45, the 
owner of a general store and a father of six, seemed to be a dignified 
man with wire-rimmed glasses and a salt-and-pepper beard. ``I have 
learned more in the past few days than in my entire life before,'' 
he said enthusiastically. Prisoners sleep on the concrete floors in 
Pul-i-Charki's large vaults. Blankets are lined up neatly against 
the walls. Some men are permitted two of these covers, so one can 
be rolled into a pillow or used as a thin mattress. A single bulb 
provides weak light. ``I am happy to be here,'' said Mohammed Faisel, 
only 18. ``This is better even than home.'' As the proud commandant 
and his heavily armed entourage finished giving the tour, there was 
sudden activity outside. Mullah Gul Mohammed, a military chief of 
the virtue and vice patrols, had arrived with 15 new prisoners and 
decided to pause for tea. An imposing man with long crow's feet beside 
his eyes, Mohammed, 45, has a congenitally deformed foot and uses 
an old walking stick. He acted sternly at first, concerned that photos 
might have been taken. Many of the Taliban believe that Islamic teachings 
proscribe any images of the human figure. ``Please do not think us 
brutal,'' the mullah said, finally turning genial after his tea had 
been poured. ``We bring these men here only to educate them in Islam. 
We are good to them. We have just sent a man home after only five 
days because he was old and sick.'' Mohammed's vigilantes are feared 
in Kabul. Cruising in pickup trucks and flying white flags of purity, 
they thrash women caught outside without a burka, an all-enveloping 
garment that hides even their eyes. They also confiscate music cassettes 
and televisions. For them beard enforcement has become a challenge 
that requires an experienced hand. ``The trimmed beard is hard to 
the touch,'' the mullah said. ``A proper beard is soft.'' He beckoned 
for more tea and joked about the beard lengths of the dozen men seated 
near him. These days it is easy for him to be lighthearted. By his 
judgment the beard campaign has been a success. He credits much of 
this to the rigorous religious tutoring at Pul-i-Charki. ``We have 
yet to have a case where a man has been caught twice,'' he said, smiling 
triumphantly. ``One time seems to be enough.''
