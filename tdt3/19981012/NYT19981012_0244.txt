Does walking during labor's early stages ease pain and hasten delivery? 
It's not for all women. Some do not want to walk. But the majority, 
if encouraged, will get up and then say, ``Oh, that feels much better.'' 
It keeps them moving around and there's less chance of the baby's 
being stuck in an unfavorable position. You let gravity work. You're 
standing up and you want baby to come down and out. It's just my opinion. 
The mother can always get back in bed if she doesn't like it. But 
the help makes a big difference. You show them what they can do, how 
not just to walk, but to sway back and forth, leaning on the bed, 
or on their husband; things you might do if you were having a lot 
of abdominal or back pain and were left to your own devices. _MARION 
McCARTNEY, Director of professional services for the American College 
of Nurse-Midwives. I don't believe that medically it hastens the labor, 
or that the contractions are better. But I think it is a very good 
thing to tell patients they have the option. If that's what the patient 
really wishes to do, walking will allow her to feel more in control, 
not just tied to a hospital bed attached to a scary machine. The thing 
that makes me angry is when patients are huddled over with pain but 
say I must get up and walk. Patients begin to believe they must do 
this because they've been told so, by a friend or a relative or in 
a book. But do you really need to be out there throwing up? Would 
you normally get out of bed if you're sick or lightheaded? They're 
making themselves do something they wouldn't otherwise do, and blame 
themselves if they can't. _DR. IFFATH ABBASI HOSKINS, Chief of obstetrics 
and gynecology, New York University Downtown Hospital.
