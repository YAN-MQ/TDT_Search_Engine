A new survey points to more hard times for Hong Kong's economy. As 
Amy Bickers reports from the Chinese territory, most companies surveyed 
expect the recession to continue for at least six months. Hong Kong's 
economy is likely to sink deeper into recession during the next half 
year, according to a survey of leading companies. In a poll conducted 
by the South China Morning Post newspaper and banking giant Nomura 
International, half the 150 firms queried expect a further contraction 
in business, which will lead to declining profits and lower prices. 
One-third of those surveyed expect the economy to remain sluggish 
but do not foresee a steeper drop-off in economic growth. The survey 
generally supports the view of many local economists who say Hong 
Kong will enter a deflationary phase. More than half of the companies 
said Hong Kong's property market would continue to suffer, with rents 
falling further in the next six months. They're already down some 
40 percent from their 1997 peak. One upbeat conclusion to the survey 
-- growth in the unemployment figures might ease. More than two-thirds 
of the respondents said they would not layoff workers in the next 
six months. Unemployment in Hong Kong is currently hovering around 
5 percent, the highest level in 15 years. Amy Bickers for VOA News, 
Hong Kong.
