Russian president Boris Yeltsin has cut short a trip to central Asia 
because of health problems. VOA's Andre Deneshira has this report 
from Moscow. Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman told reporters the decision to 
cut short by 24 hours a visit to Kazakhstan was made by the president's 
doctors and against Mr. Yeltsin's wishes. Russian news agencies quote 
the president's senior doctor as saying he is suffering from bronchitis 
and has a slight fever. The announcement came shortly after Mr. Yeltsin 
arrived in Kazakhstan's main city, Amati for a two-day visit. The 
Russian president flew from Tashkent, where he held talks with Uzbekistan's 
leader, Islam Karimov. At a welcoming ceremony, Mr. Yeltsin looked 
stiff, stumbled and had to be supported by the Uzbek leader. The Russian 
president then canceled several appearances. Mr. Yeltsin has had a 
long history of health problems. And for the past several months, 
the Russian president has been seen very rarely in public, fueling 
more speculation about the state of his health. Andre Deneshira, VOA 
News, Moscow.
