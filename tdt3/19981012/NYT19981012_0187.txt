Q. (italics)What is a stitch in your side? What can you do to relieve 
the pain?(end italics) A. Many of the explanations offered for the 
sharp pain runners feel during hard breathing, usually on the right 
side, involve muscle stress or spasms in or near the diaphragm. ``We 
are probably doing something in a rhythmic, repetitive fashion that 
is stressing one or more muscles,'' said Dr. Everett Murdock of California 
State University at Long Beach. ``The solution is to develop techniques 
to break up that stressful rhythm,'' he wrote in ``Be Your Own Running 
Coach,'' a book in preparation with Susan Sudbury. He urges runners 
to try several techniques including changing breathing patterns by 
breathing slower and deeper and forcefully exhaling through pursed 
lips. Other suggestions involve changing running position by leaning 
forward, backward or sideways, stretching before running, having the 
stomach as empty as possible before running and changing the foot 
they land on when exhaling. A more direct explanation and remedy come 
from South African sports scientist and running expert, Dr. Tim Noakes 
of the University of Cape Town. His idea, presented in ``Running Injuries'' 
(Oxford University Press), is that the rhythm of running causes bouncing 
of the liver, stretching the ligaments that link liver and diaphragm. 
His suggestion is to stop running and use a hand to press the liver 
up against the diaphragm until the pain ends. Readers are invited
