Democrats and republicans are still at odds over a comprehensive budget 
agreement, but will have more time to reach a deal. Congress has agreed 
to a stop-gap measure that will keep the government running through 
midnight Wednesday. Congressional and White House negotiators will 
meet again tomorrow. Republicans are calling for a tax cut. The president 
is insisting they add more money to education reform instead.
