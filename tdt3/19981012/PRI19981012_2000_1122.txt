Also from our back pages comes this story from Japan, where a nearly 
decade long slump in the economy is beginning to hit that bastion 
of conspicuous consumption, weddings. According to a survey by the 
Japanese bridal magazine "Zexy", the average cost of a wedding in 
the Tokyo area fell nearly 11% between '96 and '97. Gone are some 
frills that became de-riguer in the '80s like filling a banquet hall 
with fog from dry ice machines. Even the banquet hall itself is being 
forsaken for a simple hotel. But, even with these kinds of sacrifices, 
weddings are still far from cheap there. In 1997, according to the 
survey, the average Japanese wedding costs about $45,000.
