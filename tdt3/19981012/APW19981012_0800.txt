An exhibit on the fate Jehova Witness followers in Germany opened 
in Dresden Monday, showing that some 2,000 of the religious group's 
members lost their lives under the Nazis. About 300 Jehova's Witness 
believers were executed by the Nazis, while 1,700 died in concentration 
camps, said Martin Jahn, an exhibit organizer for the group. A total 
of 6,000 were jailed, he said. The Christian group was persecuted 
by the Nazis because they followed the the biblical motto, ``Thou 
shalt not kill,'' said Jahn. At least some were condemned for refusing 
to fight in Hitler's army. The persecution continued after the war, 
with communist authorities in East Germany jailing about 5,000 members 
of the group, Jahn said. East Germany banned the group after the communist-ruled 
nation's highest court ruled in October 1950 that Jehova Witness teachings 
incited boycotts of the military, the exhibit shows. The exhibit, 
titled ``Steadfast despite Persecution,'' is to run to the end of 
the month.
