Good evening. It appears tonight the threat of force and some tireless 
'round-the-clock diplomacy is paying off in Kosovo. There now seems 
to be a tentative agreement from Yugoslavia's President Milosevic 
to pull his troops out of Kosovo and to allow a large force of international 
monitors in to assure he's keeping his word. It's not yet a done deal, 
and in these two reports tonight, you'll see the difficulty of the 
process. We begin with NBC's Andrea Mitchell. Tom, the possible deal, 
brokered by special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, could avert NAto 
air strikes if -- and that's a big if -- Yugoslavia's president lives 
up to it. In Brussels tonight, an emergency meeting of the 16-member 
NAto council, the group that can authorize NAto's generals TO order 
air strikes. In New York, the president talks to U.S. negotiator Richard 
Holbrooke in Brussels. The decision -- even if there is an agreement, 
the United States still wants NAto to authorize military strikes just 
in case the deal falls apart. The council is meeting to discuss what 
it does next in a situation of extreme seriousness, one might say 
an emergency. During a week of nonstop diplomacy, Holbrooke has gotten 
Yugoslav President Milosevic to agree to a cease-fire, no more attacks 
on ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo. He will also withdraw 
the Serb army and police from Kosovo, permit relief to get to 250,000 
refugees forced to flee from the Serb forces, and most important, 
allow NAto to monitor from the air and 2,000 civilian observers on 
the ground. That civilian force would include some Americans. In Prague 
today, Henry Kissinger, on the importance of a verifiable diplomatic 
solution -- I have no refute for the Serbian conduct. But we have 
to understand it is a problem that we're trying to solve, not a individual 
qaurl. The agreement could still blow up if Milosevic is angry about 
the threat of force. But U.S. officials say that is the only way to 
get him to obey. Andrea Mitchell, NBC news, Washington.
