Amid international calls for clemency, a military court condemned 
34 officers Monday to death by firing squad for crimes linked to the 
bloody coup that toppled Sierra Leone's president last year. The 34 
were found guilty of treason, murder and other crimes committed by 
the junta, which held sway for 10 months until President Ahmed Tejan 
Kabbah was restored to power by a Nigerian-led West African intervention 
force in March. Three other officers were acquitted while another 
died in custody during the court martial, which lasted more than two 
months. Addressing a hushed courtroom, military court president Col. 
Tom Carew ruled that the convicts will not be given a chance to appeal 
and can only be given mercy from Kabbah himself. Outside, throngs 
of silent passerbys strained to glimpse the condemned officers being 
whisked away to prison in armored vehicles. Carew said those found 
guilty were among the chief architects of the May 25, 1997 coup. Although 
it was not clear when the executions would take place, human rights 
watchdog Amnesty International said they could be imminent and appealed 
to Sierra Leone's president to overturn the ruling. Several ``friendly'' 
governments had also called on Sierra Leone to show mercy to all those 
accused of treason, Information Minister Julius Spencer said without 
giving details. ``The use of the death penalty will not contribute 
to the process of reconciliation in Sierra Leone,'' Amnesty said in 
a statement released in London. ``Everyone convicted of a crime shall 
have the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed.'' The 
Information Minister said the court martial had been conducted fairly 
by international standards. ``The public clamor has been for retribution,'' 
said Spencer. ``There is no international convention prohibiting the 
execution of the death sentence.'' Among the convicts is Col. F.Y. 
Koroma, the brother of former junta leader Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, 
who has gone into hiding in the eastern interior with the remnants 
of his ousted forces. Last month, 16 civilians were convicted of treason 
for collaborating with the junta. Another 38 civilians are on trial 
in separate cases for treason connected with junta rule, while former 
rebel leader Foday Sankoh is standing trial on various charges, including 
crimes against humanity. Although Kabbah's return was hailed as a 
victory for democracy in West Africa, fighting between Kabbah's loyalist 
forces and ousted junta soldiers and their rebel allies has continued 
in the country's east. Hundreds of alleged opponents of Kabbah have 
been rounded up and detained without charge on suspicion of aiding 
the rebellion.
