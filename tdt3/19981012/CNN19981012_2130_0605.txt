Pretty soon people will be able to page you anywhere in the world. 
Rick Lockridge explains in this edition of "tech trends." Pagers! 
They're everywhere. 55 million of them beeping and chirping in the 
U.S. alone -- fully 20% of Americans now carry one -- on hip, or handbag. 
I wear it almost 24 hours a day. It is bound to me, So, this is your 
little lifeline? Basically, yeah. How important is it to you? It's 
not that important to me, but my boss thinks it is. Now, for everyone 
with a boss like that, there is the global satellite beeper from iridium. 
A palm-sized pager with a worldwide reach and a multilingual display. 
It's able to support 20 languages so you can have it in everything 
from Chinese to Arabic to Russian to English to just about everything 
you can think of. Iridium says its satellite pagers will always be 
within reach of at least one of its 66 low-earth-orbit satellites. 
The pager and these much-publicized new satellite phones go on sale 
November 1st. But while the phones will cost $3,000 and won't complete 
calls to some countries, the $500 to $700 pagers are supposed to work 
anywhere and everywhere. Is it possible that you would have to be 
paged at the South Pole? Well, hopefully not. Hopefully I won't have 
to go there. Iridium spent 11 years and $5 billion launching a global 
phone and pager network. The company has bet all that money on the 
premise that busy travelers will pay a premium to stay in touch. But 
with all those satellites following us around, some may find themselves 
yearning for the days when belts were just for buckles. I relish the 
few moments on the plane where they say turn everything off. Is there 
ever a time when you wish you didn't have it? Absolutely. Late nights 
and sundays during football. With the advent of the global pager there's 
only one good excuse left for missing pages from your boss and that 
one will disappear when somebody invents a battery that never goes 
dead. Rick Lockridge, CNN, Atlanta.
