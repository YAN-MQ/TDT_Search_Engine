People scared of the dentist could soon have a new option for dealing 
with cavities: a machine that uses water particles to cut into teeth 
without as much pain and noise as the dreaded drill. Biolase Technology 
Inc. announced Food and Drug Administration approval of its Millennium 
device Monday. Laser energy bombards water droplets until they move 
at such high speed that they become a ``hydrokinetic'' drill. Despite 
a faint burning smell, the tooth remains cool to touch because only 
cool water, not the laser's heat energy, actually reaches it. Biolase 
said the water drills would sell for dlrs 39,000 to dlrs 45,000, somewhat 
higher than a regular dental drill and about the same as a heat laser 
the FDA approved for cavity drilling last year. Dr. Lewis Eversole 
of the University of the Pacific studied 66 people who had two teeth 
with cavities the same size. One tooth got regular drilling, the other 
was drilled with Millennium. Both systems were comparable, he concluded 
after seeing the fillings were equally intact six months later. But 
the Millennium didn't cause the high-pitched grinding that makes ``a 
lot of people want to jump out of the chair,'' he said. In 20 people 
who opted not to receive anesthesia for either filling, patients reported 
significantly less discomfort on the Millennium-drilled tooth, he 
said. But the Millennium is only for certain kinds of cavities, so 
it's uncertain how often dentists would be able to use it, cautioned 
Dr. Wayne Wozniak of the American Dental Association. For example, 
it can't treat a cavity that forms behind an existing filling, he 
said. It's also for adults only. ``It's something that still needs 
further research to decide just how useful such a device would be 
in the dental office,'' he said.
