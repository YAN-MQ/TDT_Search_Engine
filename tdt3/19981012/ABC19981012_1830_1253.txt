There is one group of people that is particularly satisfied with managed 
care, more than satisfied, actually. We're talking about people on 
Medicaid, the government program to provide health insurance for people 
on welfare. About 20 million Americans on Medicaid now receive their 
health care through managed care. Here's ABC's George strait. It is 
difficult to find critics of managed care at this clinic. I take care 
of the needs of my children right here. Surveys show people who have 
the least, the poor, like managed care the most. Here is an example. 
In the Bronx, immunizations are up 20% since 1994, and the number 
of low-birth-weight babies has fallen below the state average. In 
middle class America, the move to managed care was driven mainly by 
cost. It's different when we talk about serving poor people. We saw 
managed care as the way to improve care. Across the country, there 
are 349 companies managing the care of about half of the people on 
Medicaid, the government's health program for welfare recipients. 
Managed care has given millions of people more access and more choice 
than they have ever had. Anna Rios and her daughters suffer from chronic 
asthma and migraines. Before joining an HMO they were constantly in 
a hospital emergency room for medical care. Take a deep breath. Anna 
says HMOs opened her eyes to what good medical care could be, particularly 
for her children. They looked over this child with a fine tooth comb. 
As a mother I said this doctor cares. It like blew my mind because 
nobody had ever given any of my children that kind of physical. Providing 
quality care fre system takes extra effort. For instance, visiting 
nurses have to go to homes to teach preventive care. So maybe we're 
doing what is right. But all of this is very expensive. Many states, 
who pay most of the bills, have begun cutting back on what they will 
spend to treat the poor. That has prompted dozens of managed care 
companies to pull out. This HMO alone said half of its losses were 
attributable to only 5% of its clients, those on Medicaid. If this 
trend continues, the gains in health care achieved by Anna, her family 
and millions of other poor Americans will now be at serious risk.
