Benetton's Turkish licensee said Monday it was suspending all dealings 
with an Istanbul factory accused of employing children as young as 
9 years old, Italy's ANSA news service reported. Bogazici Ready Wear 
said it had begun an investigation into the allegations, raised by 
a Turkish textile workers group. The factory employs children between 
the ages of 9 and 13 and pays them less than $90 a month, making clothing 
under the name of the Italian-based clothing manufacturer and retailer, 
alleged Dervis Kaplan, leader of the textile workers group. ``This 
scandal should cease,'' Italy's Corriere della Sera daily quoted Kaplan 
as saying. Benetton's offices in Turkey did not immediately return 
calls for comment late Monday. According to Corriere della Sera, Benetton 
responded, ``If it's true, we will intervene. Our Turkish partner, 
in fact, guaranteed us in writing it would respect the laws on labor.'' 
Bogazici Ready Wear said it had suspended dealings with the factory 
at the request of an Italian textile group.
