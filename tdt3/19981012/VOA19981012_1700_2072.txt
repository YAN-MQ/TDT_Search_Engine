Aid agencies operating in war-stricken southern Sudan say the Sudanese 
government has joined rebels in extending a cease-fire to facilitate 
delivering humanitarian aid. Last week, the rebel Sudan People's Liberation 
Army said it would extend the cease-fire for three months when it 
expires on October 14. In a statement issued to the aid group Operation 
Lifeline Sudan, the Khartoum government said it, too, will observe 
a three-month extension Wednesday.
