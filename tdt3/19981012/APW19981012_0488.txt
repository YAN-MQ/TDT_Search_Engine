A power outage blacked out wide areas of the main Luzon island for 
several hours Monday, disrupting operations at Manila's international 
airport and at the presidential palace. A breakdown in two power plants 
and a major power transmission line south of Manila caused the outage, 
the state-run National Power Corporation said. A Napocor official 
said they were investigating the cause of the breakdown in the plants 
but said they did not suspect any sabotage. It took at least five 
hours to restore power in Manila and most other areas, officials said. 
At the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, emergency power 
generators failed to activate for at least 15 minutes, halting cargo 
conveyor belts and preventing movable passageways to be connected 
to planes at the passenger terminal. Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora 
said generators provided power at the Malacanang presidential palace 
but many offices were without power for hours. President Joseph Estrada 
is on a four-day state visit in Singapore. A power crisis in 1992 
during the term of President Corazon Aquino caused up to 12 hours 
of outages in most of Luzon daily, seriously hurting Manila's economy.
