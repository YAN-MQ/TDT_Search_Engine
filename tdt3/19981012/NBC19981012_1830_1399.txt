I'll be right back with the "fleecing of America." But first -- it 
is, of course, Columbus day, a day set aside to honor the man who 
discovered America. Or did he? In fact, there were other explorers 
who showed up in the new world, even before Columbus. How many and 
who were they? The "nightly numbers," next. These days, everything's 
faster. Everything. So how come pain relief isn't faster? Introducing 
Advil liqui-gels-- on tough pain, they're stronger and faster than 
extra strength Tylenol. New Advil liqui-gels. Stronger and faster. 
Pain keeping you awake? Now the effeescent power of new alka-seltzer 
P.M. gives you complete relief. Alka-seltzer speed, plus a gentle 
sleep aid. The 100% solution to nighttime pain. New alka-seltzer P.M. 
sleep well. i'm 64. Is there anything I can do to stop bone loss? 
Absolutely. Here's proof. In a landmark clinical study, caltrate actually 
stopped bone loss... in women at risk for osteoporosis. Whatever your 
age: Fibercon or metamucil? Both have fiber for regularity. But I 
like Fibercon better. Same natural action of fiber, but only Fibercon 
contains calcium. And with Fibercon, I get my fiber in two caplets.
