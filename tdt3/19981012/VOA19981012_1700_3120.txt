South Korea's state air carrier, Korean Airlines, says it will spend 
about $13 million on much-needed safety improvements. The airline 
said Monday it will strengthen pilot training, buy new high-tech safety 
equipment and ground some planes for inspection. The construction 
and transportation ministry ordered KAL Friday to cut its domestic 
operations by about 15 percent and suspend some of its Seoul to Tokyo 
flights after seven accidents in two months.
