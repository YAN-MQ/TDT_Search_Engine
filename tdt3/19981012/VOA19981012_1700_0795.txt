And President Clinton is leading this nation in outrage over the death 
of a homosexual college student in the western state of Wyoming. Speaking 
just a short while ago, Mr. Clinton renewed his call for a law setting 
a national standard on dealing with hate crimes. Crimes of hate and 
crimes of violence cannot be tolerated in our country. In our shock 
and grief, one thing must remain clear. Hate and prejudice are not 
American values. The public outrage in Laramie and all across America 
today echoes what we heard at the White House conference on hate crimes 
last year. There is something we can do about this. Congress needs 
to pass our tough hate crimes legislation. It can do so even before 
it adjourns, and it should do so. I hope that in the grief of this 
moment for Matthew Shepard's family and in the shared outrage across 
America, Americans will once again search their hearts and do what 
they can to reduce their own fear and anxiety and anger at people 
who are different. And I hope that Congress will pass the hate crimes 
legislation. President Clinton.
