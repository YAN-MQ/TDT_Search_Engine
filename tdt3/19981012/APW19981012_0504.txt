Hungary's foreign minister said Monday that the weakness of Ukrainian 
companies was the main obstacle to strengthening economic ties between 
the two countries. On the second day of his two-day visit to Ukraine, 
Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi said Hungary was nonetheless interested 
in expanding economic ties. ``Therefore, we have to resolve the issue 
of government guarantees for our investments,'' Martonyi said. Trade 
turnover between the two neighbors stands at a low dlrs 500 million 
to dlrs 530 million a year, Martonyi noted at a meeting with Ukraine's 
deputy parliament speaker Adam Martyniuk, according to the Interfax 
news agency. Martyniuk said parliament supported an expansion of ties 
with Hungary and pledged speedy ratification of bilateral agreements 
that Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma plans to sign during his Oct. 
27-28 visit to Budapest. The Hungarian minister also met Monday with 
Kuchma, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and Foreign Minister Borys 
Tarasiuk. Tarasiuk said the two sides had discussed travel and trade 
regulations that might be toughened if Hungary is accepted into the 
European Union. Kiev is concerned about the possible consequences 
of its East European neighbors' membership in the EU and has been 
holding talks with Poland, Hungary and EU member nations in an attempt 
to minimize the impact.
