The United States on Monday lost an appeal over a World Trade Organization 
ruling that U.S. import restrictions on shrimp were inconsistent with 
its obligations. The panel of the WTO's Appellate Body, which functions 
as an appeals court, said the U.S. restrictions amounted to arbitrary 
and unjustifiable discrimination. The United States should determine 
how to bring its implementation of the law in line with its trading 
obligations, it said. In April, a WTO panel decided that a U.S. embargo 
on shrimp imports from India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand is 
an illegal attempt to impose U.S. standards on other countries. The 
United States has blocked shrimp imports from the four under a law 
restricting the import of shrimp caught with trawling nets and equipment 
that harm endangered species of sea turtles. The countries have declined 
to adopt measures to ensure trawling nets won't ensnare and kill the 
turtles. Environmentalists say failure to equip shrimp nets with turtle-excluder 
devices costing dlrs 75 each causes the death of 150,000 turtles a 
year worldwide. Although faulting the United States for the way its 
rules were carried out, the panel upheld WTO members' right to adopt 
laws for the purpose of conserving exhaustible natural resources. 
``The Appellate Body has rightly recognized that our shrimp-turtle 
law is an important and legitimate conservation measure, and not protectionist,'' 
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement. 
``But we disagree with (its) assessment that we have not implemented 
the law in an even-handed manner.'' Barshefsky said the ruling won't 
affect U.S. efforts to promote sea turtle conservation. ``We will 
evaluate our options in the light of what best achieves our firm objective 
of protecting endangered sea turtles,'' she said. She welcomed a ruling 
by the body that submissions by non-governmental organizations can 
be considered by WTO panels. In San Francisco, the environmental group 
Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund expressed concern the ruling would 
discourage the United States from using import restrictions to protect 
other imperiled species. ``Much as we would encourage the United States 
to stand by its law, I don't really expect that to happen,'' said 
Martin Wagner, the fund's director of international programs. The 
decision was also deplored by the Sierra Club and the Earth Island 
Institute.
