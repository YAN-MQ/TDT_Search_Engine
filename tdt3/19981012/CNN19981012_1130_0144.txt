Time is running out for Yugoslavia's leaders to heed the U.N.'s order 
to withdraw from Kosovo. NatO officials are meeting at this hour in 
Brussels, Belgium, to prepare for possible air strikes. They're waiting 
for word from U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, regarding the 
outcome of his talks with Yugoslavia's leadership before approving 
an attack. The Italian government today approved the launching of 
NATO air strikes from Italian territory. The German government gave 
similar approval. American B-52s on the ground in England are preparing 
to take part in any NATO military action, along with as many as 260 
other U.S. warplanes.
