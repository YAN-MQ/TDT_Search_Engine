The turmoil on world markets, a battle over the European Union's budget 
and the economic impact of Italy's government crisis dominated Monday's 
meeting of EU finance ministers. The meeting came as slower growth 
rates and fears of more gloom spreading from Asia, Russia and South 
America take some of the shine off preparations for the launch of 
the euro as the common currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1. So far, 
the Europe has avoided the worst of the global crisis, and EU's Finance 
Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy predicted at the start of the 
meeting ``in 1999 Europe will have the best growth among the industrial 
powers.'' However, ministers face mounting pressure for action to 
halt any further decline in growth, including calls for interest rate 
cuts to help business. Last week, the Spanish, Irish, Portuguese and 
British central banks eased rates, but EU central bankers and a number 
of ministers believe rates are low enough in core European economies 
such as Germany and France. ``The problem of bringing down rates is 
not one for Europe,'' said Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy. 
Apart from interest rates, ministers were expected to discuss the 
impact for Europe of the dollar's recent tumble and proposals for 
strengthening international financial institutions to prevent future 
outbreaks of global turbulence. ``We've got to contribute to maintaining 
the conditions for growth and stability round the world,'' Britain's 
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown told BBC television Sunday. 
``My European colleagues ... must share responsibility for creating 
these conditions.'' The ministers were likely to reject a proposal 
for the EU to back loans to Russia by the Union's lending arm, the 
European Investment Bank. ``In the present situation in Russia ... 
it would not be serious to give the EU budget guarantee to an EIB 
intervention in Russia,'' De Silguy told reporters. The one-day EU 
meeting should be the last for German Finance Minister Theo Waigel. 
Defeat in last month's elections means the Bavarian conservative is 
stepping down after almost 10 years at the helm of the EU's biggest 
economy. As a parting shot, Waigel is likely to knock home Germany's 
tough line over plans to overhaul the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget 
from 2000 so the Union can pay for it's planned expansion into eastern 
Europe. Germany, along with Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, says 
it pays too much into EU coffers and gets too little back in return. 
They insist any reform correct the imbalance. Since the incoming center-left 
government of chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder is expected to continue 
to defend Germany's stance, the budget wrangling is expected to drag 
on for months. Italy's Carlo Azeglio Ciampi may also be making his 
last appearance at a gathering of EU finance ministers, following 
the fall of the center-left government in Rome Friday. Other ministers 
looked for assurances that whoever leads the next government _ perhaps 
Ciampi himself as caretaker prime minister _ will continue Italy's 
efforts to cut debt and budget deficit. ``I have no reason to believe 
that Italy won't continue to honor its pledges,'' De Silguy said.
