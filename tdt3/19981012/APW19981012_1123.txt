Despite diplomatic progess, NATO was still expected to approve on 
Monday the last military step needed to launch airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia in an effort to force President Slobodan Milosevic to comply 
with international demands on Kosovo. ``There is no reason not to 
sustain the military pressure,'' said a NATO official, who demanded 
anonymity. U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived here to brief the 
ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations meeting in emergency session on 
his Kosovo peace efforts. He came here from marathon talks with Milosevic 
in Belgrade amid indications a breakthrough was near in talks about 
ending the violence in the secessionist Serbian province and thus 
avert allied airstrikes. Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said 
in Moscow Milosevic has agreed to allow 1,500 international observers 
to monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the crackdown in Kosovo. 
The NATO official said the alliance would proceed with plans for airstrikes 
to keep the pressure on Milosevic. ``The military preparations are 
going ahead,'' the official said. That would likely include the issuance 
later Monday of an ``activation order'' to put planes and other hardware 
to be used in airstrikes under joint NATO command. Officials said 
that would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in Kosovo, where 
hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 275,000 uprooted 
since February's crackdown by Serb forces on ethnic Albanian rebels. 
The ``activation order'' would transfer the command over airplanes 
and military equipment necessary for an airstrike from national governments 
to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize deployment 
over Yugoslavia. From then on, Gen. Clark would no longer need any 
approval from the 16 member nations but would need to consult with 
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana before proceeding with airstrikes, 
NATO officials said on condition of anonymity. ``We are heading toward 
decision time now,'' said the NATO official. Solana and Holbrooke 
have been in close touch over the past week. The few days between 
an activation order and actual airstrikes allow Milosevic more time 
to consider the consequences. NATO authorities also met with Russian 
representatives at NATO headquarters Monday to keep Moscow informed 
on the military preparations. Russia opposes airstrikes against Yugoslavia, 
a traditional ally. Moscow has long been lobbying for a negotiated 
solution and has threatened to veto any U.N. resolution calling for 
airstrikes. Almost all NATO members have cleared barriers to participating 
in airstrikes. On Monday, the outgoing German government of Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl was also expected to back potential NATO airstrikes. Prior 
to the activation order, NATO officials agreed on rules of engagement, 
targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations in Kosovo and the 
safety of NATO troops in Bosnia. The NATO alliance also reached common 
ground on a legal basis for airstrikes over the weekend, removing 
uncertainty whether an additional U.N. resolution was necessary. The 
Americans, and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt the crackdown 
he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. 
Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of Serbia, a part 
of the Yugoslav republic.
