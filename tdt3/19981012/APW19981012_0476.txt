Scotty Bowman said he will decide by the end of October whether he 
will return as coach of the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion 
Detroit Red Wings. ``I don't think it will linger past that,'' the 
65-year-old Hall of Fame coach told Booth Newspapers on Sunday from 
Buffalo, New York. ``While (Red Wings officials) have been patient, 
I know it's important for them to have someone in place. Once the 
season starts, it goes up and down in a hurry.'' Since leading the 
Red Wings to the Stanley Cup title in June, Bowman has had doctors 
clear a partly blocked artery and replace his left knee. With one 
year left on his contract, Bowman has said his health would dictate 
whether he returns to pursue an National Hockey League-record ninth 
Stanley Cup. On Sunday, Bowman said much of his decision about his 
coaching career could rest in results of a physical he will undergo 
Friday at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, a Detroit Hospital. 
A stress test will reveal Bowman's progress since he underwent the 
heart procedure in July. Bowman is to attend Friday night's championship 
banner-raising at Joe Louis Arena, then decide whether to retire soon 
thereafter. ``I'll either be back right away or be gone right away,'' 
he said. In July, Bowman said, he offered to step aside and told Red 
Wings general manager Ken Holland to consider hiring a replacement. 
The response: ``He said, `No, take all the time you need to make the 
decision,''' Bowman said.
