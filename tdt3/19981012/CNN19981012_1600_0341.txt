As if Russians didn't face enough uncertainty about their country's 
economic crisis, there are new questions about their leader's health. 
Betsy Aaron reports. Hesitant, unsteady, Boris Yeltsin attempts a 
long-postponed two-day trip to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the trip 
cut short by a day. The official explanation, the president has a 
cold, had a difficult week and a tiring trip. Then a cough was added, 
then bronchitis and a fever. Also, he's returning early to Moscow 
because of his "great responsibility for the solution of the Kosovo 
problem." So what is wrong with Russia's 67-year-old president, Boris 
Yeltsin? Speculation about Boris Yeltsin's health is nothing new. 
What is new are newspaper reports naming possible diseases the president 
may be suffering from, specifically Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. One 
paper states the president is drinking again, there are problems with 
blood flow to the brain, and he needs another heart operation. One 
report quotes an unnamed doctor in Moscow's central clinic, another 
a psychiatrist. They describe symptoms -- inadequate control of facial 
muscles, inadequate answers to simple questions, forgetfulness. During 
the presidential campaign in 1996, a dancing Boris Yeltsin belied 
rumors about heart problems. But at his inauguration, Boris Yeltsin 
looked anything but healthy. Then the news, announced personally by 
the president -- he would have to have heart bypass surgery in November. 
His recuperation was slow. Rumors about his health never stopped. 
Every cold increased speculation. A pattern to his schedule developed. 
He wasn't seen for days, and sometimes weeks. Then he surfaced to 
fire his government. According to Russian television, only 2% of those 
recently polled now trust Boris Yeltsin. No surprise, after nationwide 
demonstrations last week were calling for his resignation, impeachment, 
calling for him to go. Russia's constitution calls for removal of 
a president if he is incapacitated. But who is to decide? For that, 
there is no answer. Boris Yeltsin once said that no one should serve 
in Russia's government past the age of 65. Many in Moscow are now 
saying those words may become prophetic. Betsy Aaron, CNN, Moscow.
