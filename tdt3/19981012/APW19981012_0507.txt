Richard Clarke is not a household name. And the United States' new 
anti-terrorism czar hopes it stays that way. Clarke assumed his new 
job earlier this year after spending the last quarter-century battling 
terrorism on the international stage. If he becomes recognizable, 
it probably means something went very wrong. Clarke, 47, welcomes 
the challenge. ``I don't think I could get out of bed in the morning 
if I was not motivated by something more than money,'' says the Boston-bred, 
University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T.-educated statesman who's made 
anti-terrorism his career. Clarke's official title is national coordinator 
for security, infrastructure protection and counter-terrorism, a newly 
created federal position. He already is working on a proposed dlrs 
2 billion domestic defense plan, prepping 120 cities to fight terrorism. 
``I have a tough challenge,'' he acknowledged in an interview with 
The Associated Press during a recent visit to New York. It was a rare 
step into the public spotlight for a man who prefers the shadows that 
often provide grist for fiction writers. Clarke had been a Pentagon 
analyst and a key intelligence player at the State Department and 
the White House. Watching the rise and fall of Libyan and Palestinian 
groups convinced him, he says, that terrorists never achieve their 
ultimate goals. ``I think the groups after us now would be very wise 
to take the path other terrorist groups have taken: Get out of the 
business, get out of town,'' he says. ``Stop coming after us, because 
you cannot win. We are a big country. We can take a lot of hits. We 
can give back a hell of a lot more than they can send our way.'' After 
the 1996 midair explosion of TWA Flight 800 _ investigated as a possible 
terrorist act _ the White House, law enforcement and the military 
realized the need for a federal coordinator to respond to a domestic 
terrorist attack. Clarke, then special assistant to the president 
on terrorism, was selected. His job: to coordinate the federal agencies 
responsible for defending against chemical or biological attack, mounting 
counter-terrorist maneuvers, and warding off possible computer assaults. 
The need for such planning appears to have grown. The FBI opened 68 
investigations into the threatened or actual use of chemical, biological, 
radiological or nuclear materials last year, said a senior FBI official, 
Robert Blitzer, at a conference in Washington last week. This year, 
more than 86 such FBI probes had been opened as of last month. Clarke 
told the conference that Attorney General Janet Reno would unveil 
the new terrorism response plan this week and that it includes state 
and local officials. Clarke is known among colleagues for his powers 
of persuasion. He ``has a talent for overcoming interagency problems 
and making sure everyone is on board,'' said the deputy assistant 
director for counter-terrorism for the FBI in Washington, Dale Watson. 
Says Clarke: ``The front lines of defense are the FBI on the streets, 
the CIA meeting sources in godforsaken countries, and the Delta Force 
guys training for raids. I am back from the front line, trying to 
make it possible for them to do what they do.'' When he entered government 
out of college, he worked to control the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. That ended when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, 
touching off fears in Washington that the Soviets might want to march 
through to the Middle East. Clarke soon found himself an expert on 
the region, with his expertise spreading quickly to include the Persian 
Gulf. In the 1980s, he and colleagues crafted a campaign designed 
to stop Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's suspected sponsorship of terrorism. 
The campaign included flying airplanes over Libya to create sonic 
booms and floating rafts onto its beaches to fake landings by commandos. 
``It seemed to me at the time that booms were better than bombs,'' 
Clarke said when asked about the campaign during a Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee hearing. At the start of the Gulf War, in 1991, 
Clarke headed the State Department's political military bureau. He 
accompanied Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf 
to meet the king of Saudi Arabia and ask for permission to station 
troops there. After the war, a bomb that killed six people and injured 
more than 1,000 at New York's World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993, 
brought a new urgency to U.S. efforts to combat terrorism. President 
Bill Clinton now wants Clarke to try new tactics, such as developing 
germ-warfare vaccines and battling terrorists in cyberspace. Clarke 
has already begun identifying where the United States is vulnerable. 
He helped devise a plan earlier this year to have a small team of 
hackers infiltrate the Pentagon's computers, just to prove it could 
be done. It worked _ too well. In three days, the team had gained 
control of the national military command center computers. ``If that 
can happen in the Pentagon, it can happen in power grids and communications, 
markets and banks,'' he said. ``We are in a new era. Warfare techniques 
have changed. The nation that invests the money will win the next 
war.'' Protecting cities against terrorism, Clarke said, is attracting 
some of the brightest minds in government _ much the way that efforts 
to control nuclear weapons once did. ``Some people say you can't fight 
City Hall. That is nonsense. You can change things. You can make a 
difference,'' he says. ``In my own little way I try to make that difference. 
And if you do the right thing, an embassy won't blow up. People won't 
get killed. The good guys will win occasionally.''
