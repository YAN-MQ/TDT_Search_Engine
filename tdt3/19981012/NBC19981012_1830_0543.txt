In Washington tonight, the president's men and republicans in Congress 
are still trying to hammer out a 1999 budget. They did manage to pass 
a continuing resolution that will keep the government operating through 
Wednesday. But still standing in the way, everything from complex 
issues to a one-Lane road in the alaskan wilderness. Here's NBC's 
Gwen Ifill. The budget fight is about schoolteachers and shaky global 
economies and 30 miles of alaskan wilderness. Dozens of issues, big 
and small, at the heart of a stubborn standoff between Congress and 
the White House. Democrats, using the extended negotiations as a platform 
for politically popular issues like education. We can reach across 
the political divisions here in Washington to take the steps we must 
to reduce class size, to hire more teachers, to modernize our classrooms. 
Republicans they say they've agreed on school spending but disagree 
on where the money should go. It's time to put progress ahead of polling. 
But republicans are trying to force action on legislation they couldn't 
get passed, too. Like nearly $30 million for a one-Lane gravel road 
connecting two remote Alaska towns. Its champion? Alaska senator Ted 
Stevens, the powerful chairman of the appropriations committee, over 
the objections of environmentalists who say the road will hurt wildlife. 
This is a backdoor attack and an attack on our democratic process. 
Anti-environmental issues should be debated in the light of day. But 
Don young, Alaska's sole representative in the house, says the road 
will save lives. If the administration wants to shut down the government 
over a little road 22 miles long and only 7 miles have in the refuge, 
may ought to go ahead and do it. As closed-door meetings with senior 
White House staff continued throughout the day, lawmakers wrestled 
with $500 billion in other details, including $18 billion for the 
international monetary fund to rescue faltering economies. One thing 
was clear, appearances do matter. When the president called this a 
do-nothing Congress, lawmakers began working overtime. And when republicans 
said the president was flig off to campaign, he cut the trip in half. 
Gwen Ifill, NBC news, the capital.
