Leaders of Mexico's ruling party say they need to prepare better for 
the future if they want to retain their seven-decade hold on power. 
Some southern governors say what they really need is to return to 
the past. Party reforms in recent years have led to cleaner elections, 
opposition gains and more openness within the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI. But old guard party members claim what's really needed 
are traditional politicians more in touch with their people. The debate 
marks the latest shots in a war for the soul of the party _ one that 
will determine whether it will extend its 70-year rule beyond the 
2000 elections. The most recent battle occurred last week when Mario 
Villanueva, governor of Quintana Roo state, broke off relations with 
his own party. He was back on speaking terms Monday, but he still 
told The Associated Press he would continue his battle against PRI 
``bureaucrats.'' Villanueva has built an old-style fiefdom in his 
southern state, and he thinks the rest of the country should do the 
same. He has allied with two other old-guard PRI governors in an attempt 
to get one of them nominated as the PRI presidential candidate for 
2000. On Monday, Villanueva accused national party leader Carlos Rojas 
of funding opposition groups and trying to dissolve caucuses in the 
state and party where the PRI's old guard is based. ``Rojas has financed 
groups that oppose the PRI, and is trying to create opposition in 
outlying states,'' Villanueva said in a telephone interview, referring 
to Rojas and others as ``bureaucrats with no political sense.'' Rojas 
responded in a statement accusing the governor of ``old-style authoritarianism 
that we are determined to get rid of.'' Being called old-style doesn't 
bother Villanueva. In an interview shortly before he broke contact 
with the national leadership Thursday, Villanueva said his party ``has 
to return to its origins,'' a reference to the regional political 
bosses who submitted to an all-powerful presidency in 1929. Villanueva 
dropped his demand for Rojas' resignation Saturday and pledged to 
obey party orders, but his short-lived rebellion was the second by 
a state governor this year in response to reforms within the PRI and 
Mexican politics. Villanueva and two other governors _ all of whom 
say they have been accused of illegal activities for political reasons 
_ say the so-called ``technocrats,'' reformers who have dominated 
the government this decade, are out of touch with the Mexican people. 
``Society is demanding flesh-and-blood people ... who they can believe 
in because of their profile, because of their personality,'' Villanueva 
said. The PRI has become much more open in recent years due to reforms 
supported by President Ernesto Zedillo. Paradoxically, that new openness 
has helped those who want to revert to the past. Villanueva conceded 
that a confrontation with the PRI leadership, like the one he started 
Thursday, would have been unthinkable years ago. Villanueva's brief 
rebellion follows a similar attack in February by Gov. Manuel Bartlett 
of Puebla, who predicted ``a war, a terrible fight'' against national 
leaders who he said wanted to turn over power to the opposition. Villanueva 
said he has joined with Bartlett and a third southern governor, Roberto 
Madrazo Pintado of Tabasco, in a bid to get one of the latter two 
nominated as the PRI's presidential candidate in the 2000 elections.
