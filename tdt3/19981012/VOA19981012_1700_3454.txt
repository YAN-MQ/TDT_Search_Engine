Many of our local FM and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. We're coming up on 2200 
Universal Time, and that means we're saying good night to most of 
our listeners in the Middle East and North Africa. Thanks for being 
with us, and tune in again tomorrow, beginning at 0400 Universal Time, 
when VOA News Now resumes on 7.17, 11.965 and 15.250 MHz short wave. 
If you happen to be listening in the Persian Gulf area right now, 
we invite you to stay with us for another couple of hours on medium 
wave at 1548 KHz. And if you are listening in the Eastern Mediterranean, 
we'll be back on the air with VOA News Now 30 minutes from now on 
1260 Kilohertz medium wave. Here's a frequency change. If you're listening 
in Africa, we're now going off 15.41, 15.445, 15.58 and 17.725 MHz 
short wave. We invite you to retune to 7.34 MHz or any of our other 
remaining frequencies. For listeners in Europe, we're now going off 
WRN-1 via Astra. We'll resume broadcasting via WRN at 0500 Universal 
Time.
