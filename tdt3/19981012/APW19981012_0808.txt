Forest fires raged for the second consecutive day Monday in northern 
and central Israel. Some houses were burned and people were evacuated 
from two villages, but no fatalities or serious injury were reported. 
The biggest fire was on the slopes of the Carmel range south of Haifa. 
With hot weather and high winds, the blaze spread to the picturesque 
artists village of Ein Hod and the communal village of Nir Etzion 
in the Carmel forest. Both villages were evacuated. Fourteen houses 
in Ein Hod were destroyed or damaged. Some historic homes were damaged 
in Zichron Yaacov. Air force helicopters and civilian crop-spraying 
light aircraft were brought in to help the fire-fighters. Smaller 
fires broke out again in the Carmel Forest below the Haifa neighborhood 
of Deniya, where thousands of residents were evacuated Sunday during 
what was described as the country's biggest forest fire ever. Firefighters 
said Monday's fire in the Carmel range was even bigger, but was not 
close to any large town or neighborhood. Forest fires also broke out 
in the Jerusalem area, Western Galilee and around the Arab towns and 
villages of central Israel. Four Israeli Arabs were arrested on suspicion 
of starting fires in the past two weeks in the Wadi Ara area, Israel 
radio reported. Police and Arab residents recently clashed in Wadi 
Ara over a land dispute. However Fire-Fighting Commissioner Moshe 
Vardi said investigations so far showed that Monday's fires were caused 
by picnickers leaving embers smoldering from their barbecues.
