Darryl Strawberry, once projected to released from New York's Columbia-Presbyterian 
Medical Center as early as Sunday, is expected to remain hospitalized 
for at least two more days. ``He probably will be discharged in the 
next couple of days,'' said Jaime Gill, the administrator on duty 
Sunday at Columbia-Presbyterian. She said the cancer-stricken New 
York Yankees slugger remained in stable condition. A 16-inch (40-centimeter) 
portion of 36-year-old outfielder's large intestine was removed during 
a three-hour operation Oct. 3 to get rid of a 2 1/2-inch (6.5-centimeter) 
cancerous tumor that nearly obstructed his intestine. Dr. Stuart Hershon, 
the Yankees' team physician, told The New York Times that Strawberry 
was ``still weak'' and ``needs to get his strength.'' ``He'll go home 
when he's ready,'' Hershon said.
