BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO positioned itself Monday for airstrikes 
on Yugoslavia, preparing to authorize an attack should talks on Kosovo 
fail between the chief U.S. troubleshooter and President Slobodan 
Milosevic. Ambassadors of the 16-member alliance were meeting informally 
pending the results of talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke 
and Milosevic. If the talks produce no agreement, the officials in 
Brussels were expected to vote on an ``activation order'' _ an essential 
step setting into motion the airstrike machinery. NATO still may not 
use force immediately, but a flurry of diplomatic evacuations by Western 
nations from Yugoslavia added to a sense that intervention is imminent 
barring a breakthrough in negotiations. Milosevic summoned a crew 
from state television to the White Palace where talks with Holbrooke 
were being held, indicating he was preparing a public statement. But 
it was not clear whether he was ready to compromise in order to evade 
airstrikes. The NATO order would transfer the command over the airplanes 
and other military hardware needed for an airstrike from member countries 
to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment 
over Yugoslavia. Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO 
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering planes 
and missiles launched. As NATO met in Brussels, Holbrooke resumed 
talks with Milosevic on defusing the Kosovo crisis and avoiding the 
threatened strikes. That meeting recessed by early afternoon and was 
to resume before evening. Holbrooke described his earlier overnight 
meeting with Milosevic as ``intense, indeed, and at times very heated.'' 
He said the standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can 
only be called an emergency.'' Italy on Monday authorized the use 
of its military bases for any NATO raid, while the outgoing German 
government said it intends to allow German warplanes to participate 
in any attack. In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said 
his country would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, 
which could last ``several days.'' Foreign presence was being reduced 
in anticipation of NATO action. Most of an international diplomats' 
mission observing events in Kosovo left for neighboring Macedonia 
before midday. Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all 
but 12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest, and an embassy 
statement said personal in ``non-emergency situations'' had left. 
A State Department advisory urged all U.S. citizens to leave Yugoslavia, 
and Americans in the Serb part of neighboring Bosnia also were advised 
to leave. The German and British embassy were closed down on Monday.
