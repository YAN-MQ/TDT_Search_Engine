An extradition case was adjourned Monday against an accused St. Kitts 
drug trafficker who allegedly threatened to kill U.S. students if 
the extradition went through. The United States has been attempting 
to extradite Charles ``Little Nut'' Miller since 1996 to try him in 
Florida on charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine. The case took 
on a high profile in August when the U.S. State Department told students 
at the Ross University veterinary school that Miller had threatened 
to kill Americans if he were extradited. Miller denied making the 
threat, and most of the 250 U.S. students stayed on the island. Described 
in published reports as a millionaire who drives a bulletproof BMW, 
Miller has eluded St. Kitts authorities for years. On Monday, Magistrate 
Haynes Blackman adjourned a hearing on Miller's extradition to consider 
defense motions to quash the proceedings. Blackman did not say when 
he would issue a ruling. The first attempt by the United States to 
extradite Miller was denied by the magistrate's court in St. Kitts, 
but a higher court sent the case back to be reconsidered. A recent 
Newsweek article said Miller testified in a U.S. court against a murderous 
Jamaican drug gang in 1989, was given immunity and enrolled in the 
U.S. witness protection program. A U.S. Justice Department spokesman 
declined comment. Miller also reportedly helped finance the campaign 
of St. Kitts Prime Minister Denzil Douglas, but Douglas denies any 
links to Miller.
