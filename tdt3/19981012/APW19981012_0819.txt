Governing party town councilors are still being provided with bodyguards 
and told to check under their cars for bombs despite the truce declared 
by the armed separatist group ETA, a newspaper reported Monday. Nearly 
four weeks since the cease-fire was announced security measures remain 
tight because the government believes the separatists are still monitoring 
the movements of governing party town councilors as potential targets, 
leading daily El Pais reported. Prior to the cease-fire local-level 
representatives of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular Party 
had become ETA's main targets. Five of the seven people killed over 
the last year by ETA _ an acronym standing for Basque Homeland and 
Freedom in the Basque language _ were Popular Party councilors. Interior 
Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja refused to confirm or deny the El Pais 
report that ETA was still monitoring councilors as possible victims. 
But Mayor Oreja, the minister responsible for security in Spain, did 
affirm that security measures for these politicians had not been relaxed, 
national Spanish radio reported. ETA has killed nearly 800 people 
in its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque homeland covering 
a small part of northern Spain and southern France. On Sept. 18 the 
group called its first ever indefinite cease-fire, seeking to set 
in motion a peace process that would produce a negotiated end the 
conflict. The Spanish government reacted suspiciously to the truce, 
rejecting the idea of political negotiations on the issue of Basque 
self-determination and demanding that ETA prove it intended to lay 
down its arms forever. All political parties in the northern Basque 
County _ from Aznar's Popular Party to the ETA-linked political coalition 
Herri Batasuna _ are currently immersed in campaigning for regional 
elections set for Oct 25.
