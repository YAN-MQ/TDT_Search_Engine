I'm Robert Burns, VOA News. A top U.S. envoy is briefing NATO officials 
in Brussels on his talks in Belgrade as the alliance prepares for 
air strikes to halt violence in Serbia's Kosovo province. Envoy Richard 
Holbrooke returned to Brussels Monday after a marathon series of talks 
in Belgrade with Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic. VOA correspondent 
Ron Pimstein reports from Brussels. There are indications that Balkan 
envoy Richard Holbrooke is reporting to the NATO ambassadors on the 
elements of a peaceful settlement he has reached with Yugoslav president 
Slobodan Milosevic. The ambassadors have been meeting to consider 
the last step before launching an air strike on Yugoslavia. A military 
activation order would put all NATO aircraft under General Wesley 
Clark, NATO supreme commander. General Clark would need only the word 
from NATO Secretary General Javier Solana to order a first-phase bombing 
campaign. If Ambassador Holbrooke has a settlement to report, the 
activation order could still be approved as a way to ensure that President 
Milosevic complies with any commitments he has made. NATO officials 
say they have no indication of what Ambassador Holbrooke is telling 
the NATO council. Ron Pimstein, VOA News, Brussels.
