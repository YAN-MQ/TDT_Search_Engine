Tonight, "the fleecing of America" and a dangerous come-on that is 
very tempting to a lot of Americans who own their home and need cash 
fast. They're bombarded with offers to re-finance their home, get 
some quick cash and relax, right? Well, not always. It works when 
interest rates are going down and the market is going up. But what 
happens if they start the other way? NBC's Jim Avila. By design, it's 
the kind of mail that grabs attention. Government-style brown Manila, 
an American eagle prominently displayed, and inside the address panel, 
just a hint of a check with big numbers. That looked official to me. 
80-year-old Francis flori got one at his home outside Detroit. Junk 
mail from first plus, offering a loan against the value of his home, 
$42,800. Instant money. Never heard of these people. But the Michigan 
attorney general has. He says these kinds of loans, second mortgages, 
for too many Americans are a "fleecing of America." The "Fleece" works 
two ways. First, as the state of Michigan charges in its suit against 
first plus, there's the advertising. It's just salacious and misleading 
and deceptive advertising, and it's wrong. The company voluntarily 
has suspended business in Michigan during proceedings, telling NBC 
news in a written statement the company -- critics say there's another 
problem, the second phase the plees. The second phase of the home 
equity "Fleece," say the experts, is who gets targeted by the loan 
companies. Entire neighborhoods are blanketed by direct mail lenders 
looking for what is called "subprime" customers -- homeowners who 
have trouble getting bank credit because of recent divorces, they're 
self-employed or have less-than-perfect credit. We are concerned about 
consumers who sign up for these loans not really understanding just 
how they put their house at risk. I shouldn't be given credit. Fred 
wood is a short order cook. Never made more than $10,000 a year. Kmart 
turned him down for a credit card, but a loan company specializing 
in subprime debtors offered him $40,000, and he accepted. It's a payment 
he now says he cannot afford. Wood is afraid he'll lose his house. 
I could be out on the street. Just how random is this "fleecing of 
America"? First plus says it's only supposed to go to home owners. 
$40,000 if he signed for a loan against the property address on the 
solicitation. But that's not his home, it's his office, which just 
happens to be owned by the people of Michigan. Jim Avila, NBC news, 
Chicago.
