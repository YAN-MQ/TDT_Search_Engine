Matt shepard, the gay college student savagely beaten last week in 
Wyoming, died this morning. He has been tied to a fence, pistol whipped 
and left to die. Two suspects will be charged with the murder. President 
Clinton today condemned the attack and said Congress should pass hate-crime 
legislation. But as ABC's Lisa Salters reports, in Wyoming there are 
questions about what should be done. On the University of Wyoming 
campus, where Matthew shepard was a freshman, students are wearing 
yellow ribbons today. In remembrance of Matthew. This guy sat next 
to some of you in class last week, and this morning he died. In shepard's 
Monday morning political science class, his classmates spoke about 
what happened. Whether or not he was, whatever, he got killed. Some 
fought back tears. He pleaded for his life and that in itself tells 
you that he was a human being and not just a gay person that deserved 
to die. Others said they know hate exists because they've heard it. 
People saying that if he was gay it should have happened, because 
they shouldn't "allow" gays in Wyoming. Matthew shepard's death has 
ignited nationwide debate on the issue of hate-crime legislation. 
Wyoming is one of ten states that does not have a hate-crime Bill. 
The governor says he's still not convinced that his state needs one. 
We shouldn't be rushing off like a Lynch mob might be, trying to look 
for vigilante justice. That would be just as wrong as the acts we 
deplore already. Two of the suspects arrested will now be charged 
with first-degree murder. Their girlfriends charged as accessories. 
Shepard remained connected to a ventilator from the time he was hospitalized 
until he died. His parents were spared the painful decision of removing 
him from life-support. They said like the good and caring son that 
he was, he was able to remove from them the guilt and stress from 
making that decision. a decision no parent should ever have to make.
