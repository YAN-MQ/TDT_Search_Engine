U.S. Balkan envoy briefs NATO officials in Brussels on his talks with 
the Yugoslav president as the alliance prepares for air strikes in 
Serbia's Kosovo province. Balkan leaders meet to discuss the situation 
in Kosovo. Amid the strife in Kosovo, a new daily newspaper is hitting 
the streets. Our correspondent in the troubled province will fill 
us in on this new venture in journalism. And President Clinton renews 
his call for federal standards regarding hate crimes after the death 
Monday of a homosexual college student after a violent attack last 
week. I'm Tom Crosby. And I'm Susan Yackee. Those stories and more 
are just ahead, along with the latest sports and business news and 
a new U.S. strategy for reducing air pollution -- all in this hour 
of VOA News Now. First, an update on world news.
