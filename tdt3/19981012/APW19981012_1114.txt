President Suleyman Demirel insisted Monday that Caspian Sea oil will 
be transported through Turkey, despite a report claiming that companies 
favored a cheaper and shorter route. ``Baku-Ceyhan will definitely 
be constructed,,'' Demirel told an oil conference in reference to 
a pipeline project running from the Azeri capital of Baku to Turkey's 
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. ``It is the safest route and has the 
backing of the United States.'' Demirel's optimism conflicted with 
Sunday's report in The New York Times that U.S. efforts for the Turkish 
project appeared to be failing. Azerbaijan's oil reserves in the Caspian 
Sea, which started flowing through a preliminary Russian pipeline 
last fall, are considered to be the world's richest after the Middle 
East. According to the newspaper, companies from the United States 
and seven other nations are expected to announce Oct. 29 that they 
will rely on a much shorter and cheaper pipeline already being built 
from Azerbaijan to the port of Supsa, on Georgia's Black Sea coast, 
or an enlarged pipeline along the same route. From Georgia, the oil 
would be loaded into tankers and shipped through Turkey's narrow Bosporus 
Strait, a proposal strongly opposed by Turkey as it would increase 
the risk of oil tanker accidents in the strait dividing Istanbul. 
Energy Minister Cumhur Ersumer said the report was baseless, private 
NTV television said. Ersumer said Turkey will sign an agreement with 
Georgia and Azerbaijan this month to allow the Turkish pipeline to 
cut through their territories. Ersumer also indicated that Turkey 
would help financing the project by constructing its part of the pipeline 
on its own. ``Turkey has the power to build its part of the pipeline 
if all three countries (Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan) agree on constructing 
the pipeline within their borders,'' Ersumer said. The Turkish proposal 
foresees the construction of a 1,730-kilometer (1,081-mile) pipeline, 
via Georgia, capable of carrying 50 million metric tons (7.1 million 
barrels) of oil a year. It is expected to cost dlrs 2.5 billion. It 
was unclear whether Ersumer's proposal would be officially relayed 
to the companies that will decide on the main route. According to 
some analysts, the proposal could tip the balance in Turkey's favor 
as the companies appear to base their decision on economic concerns. 
Washington has favored the Baku-Ceyhan route because it would avoid 
crossing Iran, which has also proposed an alternative route.
