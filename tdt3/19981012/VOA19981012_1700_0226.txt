Here in Washington, the White House and majority Republicans in Congress 
are making another effort to finish up work on a federal budget that 
is now almost two weeks overdue. VOA's David Gollust reports from 
the White House. Relations between the White House and Republican 
leaders are difficult given the impeachment move against the president, 
but both sides are at work on the Columbus Day holiday to try to break 
the deadlock over budget priorities that has left most of the government 
running on interim spending measures since September 30. President 
Clinton cut back what was to have been a day of political fund-raising 
in New York and canceled a Florida trip for Tuesday to remain here 
to monitor negotiations with Congress being led by his chief of staff 
Erskine Bowles. The main battle is over how federal aid to education 
will be administered, but there are disputes over other issues, including 
conditions that would be attached to money to replenish the International 
Monetary Fund. Neither side wants the crisis to force a repeat of 
the government shutdown of 1995. The White House says Mr. Clinton 
is willing, if necessary, to sign another temporary budget extension. 
David Gollust, VOA News, the White House.
