Many of our local FM and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. And today is Monday, October 
12, 1998. It was 25 years ago today in 1973 that President Richard 
Nixon nominated Gerald Ford to be vice president of the United States. 
Mr. Ford was to replace Vice President Spiro Agnew, who resigned after 
admitting he accepted bribes and failed to pay certain income taxes. 
Mr. Ford was the veteran Republican minority leader in the House of 
Representatives. President Nixon listed the assets he considered when 
he chose to nominate Gerald Ford. First, the vice president must be 
qualified to become president. Second, the individual must share the 
views of the president on foreign and domestic policies. President 
Nixon included Mr. Ford's popularity in Congress as yet another reason. 
Congress approved the nomination, and Mr. Ford became vice president 
of the United States. And on August 8, 1974, he was sworn in as president 
after Mr. Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment on charges of 
abuse of power and leading a criminal cover-up in the so-called Watergate 
scandal. Time now to talk about frequencies. If you're listening to 
us in Oceani or the Pacific, you can consider switching over right 
now to 9.705 MHz short wave, which we're now broadcasting on from 
2100 hours to 0000 Universal Time. We'd be happy to mail you a frequency 
schedule. Just send us your name and address, printed or typed, on 
a letter or postcard. Mail it to VOA News Now, Voice of America, Washington, 
D.C. 20547 USA. Or you can e-mail us that information. Our e-mail 
address is newsnow@voa.gov. And in this case, "newsnow" is one word. 
It's 2130 Universal Time, and this is VOA News Now. NATO officials 
have been hearing from a top U.S. envoy on his latest talks with the 
Yugoslav president about halting violence in Kosovo. A homosexual 
student dies from injuries suffered in an attack denounced across 
the United States as a hate crime. On "Dateline," Pam Taylor asks 
whether the American public will support removing President Clinton 
from office. All that and more in our next half hour of VOA News Now. 
First, the latest world news.
