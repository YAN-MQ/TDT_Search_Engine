Ghosts and goblins have something in common with Santa claus, at least 
in the time-warped world of the local mall. Cynthia Tornquist explains. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go. Across 
the United States, many stores have decked their halls with Christmas 
displays and merchandise. I think we have continued to be a little 
bit earlier each year, and one of the reasons being is that this is 
what the customer is telling us in terms of what she's looking for. 
In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Carson pirie Scott department store already 
has put up its window display and stocked its shelves full of holiday 
items. In paramus, New Jersey, the gift gallery has constructed a 
miniature village. In New York, the racks at Pier one imports are 
filled with tree ornaments and other decorations. Now it's just too 
much. You lose something with shoving it down your throat. It's good, 
because that way you don't rush, you know, at the En. At Nordstrom's, 
shoppers can buy Christmas gifts, but company policy keeps Christmas 
displays out of the stores until after Thanksgiving. In Atlanta, 'tis 
the season has opened a dozen temporary stores aimed at the serious 
Christmas shopper. They want to start shopping early, before Thanksgiving, 
because people do their homes now with themes. Why are retailers stocking 
up for Christmas so early? Economics. Department stores make nearly 
half their profits in the last three months of the year. But what 
kind of season can retailers expect this year? They plan to cater 
to customers with the Christmas spirit. Cynthia Tornquist, CNN, New 
York.
