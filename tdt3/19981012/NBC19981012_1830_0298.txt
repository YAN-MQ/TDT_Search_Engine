That part of the world, the Balkans, always seems to be an explosion 
waiting to occur, and Yugoslavia, under the hard-liner Slobodan Milosevic, 
is the burning fuse. As NBC's Ron Allen reports tonight, once again 
it has been touch-and-go on the ground. Today, the great escape from 
the capital, Belgrade. U.S. embassy staff sharing emotional farewells 
with a dozen or so colleagues who'll stay behind. European embassies 
completely shut down, the British flag lowered, convoys heading for 
the borders, foreigners afraid of retaliation if NATO strikes. In 
Kosovo, international teams monitoring the conflict, including the 
Russians, now getting out. Today, mixed signals from the Yugoslav 
government. Security forces ap- pulling back from Kosovo to comply 
with U.N. demands. But on Yugoslav TV, the government launches a new 
recruitment campaign for soldiers to defend the nation. People digging 
in for the worst, with lines forming for gas, and many stocking up 
on supplies. I believe it has to end in peace, but I don't know how. 
Daily newspapers publish maps listing dozens of bomb shelters. Jonathan 
rider, a principal of an international school, is one of the few Americans 
still here. He wouldn't let NBC take pictures of his school, because 
some of the students are children of western diplomats. He's afraid 
they'll be targeted for reprisals. I think it is a horrifying prospect 
to think that Belgrade could be bombed, any part of it. If it's terrifying 
for adults, imagine what it's like for children. And tonight, it got 
a little more difficult to leave the country. Several airlines have 
now stopped flying in and out of here until NAto decides whether to 
attack. Ron Allen, NBC news, Belgrade.
