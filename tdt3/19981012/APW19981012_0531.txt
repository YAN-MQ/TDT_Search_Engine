Egypt pursued its efforts Monday to cool off a crisis between Syria 
and Turkey over Kurdish rebels, as Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa 
held talks with Turkish officials. Moussa will relay a message from 
Syrian President Hafez Assad to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, 
Turkish officials said. The daily Sabah claimed Monday that Syria 
had given in to Turkish demands and agreed in the message to end its 
alleged support of Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Turkey's 
southeast. But Foreign Minister Ismail Cem insisted that Turkey was 
awaiting concrete steps from the Syrians rather than promises, independent 
NTV television reported. Iran is also trying to mediate in the crisis. 
Ankara stepped up its rhetoric against Syria two weeks ago, accusing 
Damascus of harboring Kurdish rebels and providing them with financial 
and logistics support. It has demanded that Damascus end its support 
and extradite their leaders. Syria has denied the accusations. Some 
37,000 people have died in the Kurdish rebel war against Ankara since 
1984. Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz raised the stakes in Ankara's face-off 
with its southern neighbor on Sunday, saying: ``If Syria does not 
come to its senses, it is our incumbent duty to bring the world down 
on them ... It is our incumbent duty to poke out the eyes of those 
who have eyes on our territory.'' Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said 
Sunday that Turkish forces would conduct maneuvers along the Turkish-Syrian 
border in November. There have been unconfirmed reports of a Turkish 
troop buildup along the Syrian border. Meanwhile, Tunisian Foreign 
Minister Said Bin Mustafa is expected to hold talks with Assad in 
Damascus Monday.
