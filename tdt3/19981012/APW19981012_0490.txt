Prince Charles has donated one of his own artworks to benefit the 
hospital that treated most of the victims of Northern Ireland's worst-ever 
terrorist attack. A signed and dated lithograph of one of the heir 
to the British throne's watercolors of Windsor Castle will be auctioned 
Wednesday in support of County Tyrone Hospital in Omagh, where an 
Aug. 15 car bomb planted by IRA dissidents killed 29 people and wounded 
370. ``This is the first time a piece of art by Prince Charles has 
been auctioned anywhere in the world, so we have not placed a reserve 
price on it,'' said John de Vere White, Dublin's premier auctioneer 
of fine art. He said Christie's London office had previously valued 
the lithograph at between 2,000 and 3,000 British pounds (dlrs 3,400 
to dlrs 5,100), though he said its rarity combined with the special 
occasion was likely to attract a higher price. Charles visited the 
hospital and the bomb-ravaged town of Omagh three days after the attack. 
At the time, he noted that he understood what its residents were going 
through, since his own great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, was assassinated 
by Irish Republican Army bombers in 1979. Charles' artwork will be 
sold alongside some 200 other donated works. Organizers expect the 
auction to raise at least 50,000 pounds (dlrs 85,000) for the hospital, 
which is facing likely cutbacks by the British government.
