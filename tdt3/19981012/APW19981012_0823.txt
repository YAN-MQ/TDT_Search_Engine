BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke wrapped up 
marathon talks with President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday and left 
for Brussels to brief NATO officials amid indications of progress 
toward a deal aimed at evading airstrikes. Russian Defense Minister 
Igor Sergeyev told journalists in Moscow that Milosevic has agreed 
to allow the deployment of 1,500 observers in Kosovo _ a move that 
would be a key concession by the Yugoslav leader. Sergeyev expressed 
optimism that a political settlement could be reached on the crisis, 
even as NATO was positioning itself for airstrikes, preparing to authorize 
an attack should the Milosevic-Holbrooke talks fail. There was no 
immediate confirmation of Milosevic's reported concession. But a statement 
from Milosevic's office said Holbrooke would return and hold more 
talks Tuesday. It said Milosevic ``has concluded that undoubtably, 
necessary conditions exists for peaceful, political solution to the 
Kosovo problem.'' MORE
