A military court in Sierra Leone has handed down death sentences to 
35 soldiers found guilty for treason for collaborating with the now-deposed 
military junta. Among the condemned soldiers are former army chiefs 
of staff Hassan Kantef and Samuel Coroma, the brother of fugitive 
junta leader Jonny Paul Coroma. Three defendants were acquitted of 
the treason charge.
