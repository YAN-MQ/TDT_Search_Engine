We begin the award of this year's coveted Bloopie Awards _ for outstandingly 
sloppy solecisms in advertising copy _ by holding our noses. ``Don't 
let snoring come between you and a good night's sleep,'' says an ad 
for Breathe Right Nasal Strips in Smart Source. (That Sunday supplement 
styles itself SmartSource, but I like to put a space between whole 
words, especially when the second word is capitalized. The name of 
this column will never be OnLanguage.) ``Try them for a week,'' urges 
the snoring copywriter, ``so your bed partner can learn to breathe 
through their nose, instead of their mouth.'' The personal pronoun 
their, like them, is plural, referring to more than one person. In 
this case, the writer wanted to refer to either one or the other of 
the bed partners, not both. That meant choosing the singular his or 
her. But the writer was in a bind: he or she could not choose either 
his or her because he or she could not specify whether the male or 
the female was doing the snoring; the product is designed for either 
one. Solution: Drop the your and make it all plural _ ``so bed partners 
can learn to breathe through their noses, instead of their mouths.'' 
This is an improvement but not a perfect way out because the sales 
pitch is aimed at only one of the bed mates: the bleary-eyed partner 
kept awake by the other's nasal vibrations. (I will now leave this 
award because I can hear the reader falling asleep, noisily.) Runner-up 
in the ``their's no their their'' category is IBM, among whose solutions 
for a small planet is this headline: ``You can't begin to help a client 
until you've walked a mile in their shoes.'' The writer did not want 
to say his shoes, which would infuriate female customers, or to stretch 
his copy to his or her shoes. The fix: Make client plural. The ad 
continues: ``Improving the quality of education in our schools is 
the most important challenge IBM has ever tackled.'' Yeah, right. 
Not content with that entry, IBM took a full page to ask, ``Can You 
Really Buy a Computer That Makes Someone Feel Differently About Their 
Job?'' Howard Pelzner of Miami notes IBM's their problem (a virus 
loose, perhaps) and adds, ``It should be different, the adjective, 
not differently, the adverb.'' This suggests the bad/badly differentiation: 
``To feel bad'' is to be depressed, while ``to feel badly'' means 
to have a numbness in the fingers. A purist would extend that feeling 
to different/differently: To feel different is to be a stranger in 
a strange land, while to feel differently is to receive sensation 
from antennae rather than fingers. But you won't find that fine distinction 
made by most, and certainly not on a computer's grammar checker. The 
Spelling Bloopie goes to the Orvis catalog for inadvertently restraining 
newly married women who tend to take the bits in their mouths. ``Beautifully 
made bridal leathers'' are advertised as going into its brown ``Bridal 
trim belt'' for waist sizes 30 to 44. Sorry, but Flirtation Walk is 
no bridle path. Bridal, an adjective, refers to a woman being married, 
who gets a bridal shower and gets to throw the bridal bouquet and 
spend a night in the bridal suite. Bridle, a noun derived from the 
Old English bregden, ``to move quickly,'' has to do with the leather 
headgear used to control a horse. When the bridle is yanked, it causes 
the animal to bridle _ the verb's meaning has been extended to ``to 
show hostility at an affront.'' When a newly married woman takes offense 
and rips off her veil to holler at the groom, we can witness a scene 
of bridal bridling. ``World Mastercard _ more living, less limits'' 
is the slogan of the bankers' credit combine, and it is more or less 
bankrupt grammar. ``Shouldn't this read fewer limits?'' writes Andrew 
Goldberg, a shoofly copywriter in New York. ``The less/fewer problem 
is getting worse by the hour!'' Less describes quantity; fewer deals 
with number. Years ago, Safeway was given a Bloopie for its sign at 
a checkout counter that read ``Ten Items or Less,'' and lo! Ever since, 
I've gone zinging through with my nine items past a sign that correctly 
says ``Ten Items or Fewer.'' The elitist media strike again. Here 
comes a picture of the actress Susan Sarandon, in an ad for the American 
Museum of Natural History, asking, ``What part do each of us play?'' 
Writes the Bloopie nominator Maxine Skopov of Orangeburg, N.Y.: ``Shouldn't 
that read `What part does each of us play?' Could so many proofreaders, 
editors, printers have missed what virtually leaped out at me?'' The 
part played by each of that phalanx of editors does not guarantee 
correct usage. Remember the famous 1940s radio line ``the Shadow knows''? 
A black comedian liked to use Black English in spoofing it: ``Who 
knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow do.'' And what 
of the literary set? The Ivy League Bloopie goes to Princeton University 
Press for advertising ``Disarming Strangers,'' by Leon V. Sigal, as 
``an inside look at how the Korean nuclear crisis originated, escalated 
and was ultimately diffused.'' Mark Thompson of Time magazine notes, 
``If they can't tell the difference between diffuse and defuse at 
Princeton, what's the hope for the rest of us?'' Charles Krauthammer, 
the only pundit trained as a psychiatrist, wrote an article in The 
Weekly Standard about President Clinton's self-absorption aptly headlined 
``The Solipsist-in-Chief.'' That reminded me that I had, in a recent 
polemical harangue, knocked some politicians who made merely grammatical 
mistakes as solipsistic solons. Richard Wardlow of Cornelius, N.C., 
led the charge of the Gotcha! Gang: ``Solipsism is the theory that 
the self is the only thing really existent while solecism is a violation 
of grammatical rules. It seems to me that your mistaken solons are 
solecistic rather than solipsistic.'' O Solecism Mio. I earned a Bloopie 
of my own.
