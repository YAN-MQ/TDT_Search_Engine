This is the world. A co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. It's Monday, October 12th. I'm Tony Conn. A US envoy 
presses Serbia's leader to stop the crackdown in Kosovo, while NATO 
clears the way for air strikes. Also two of NATO's members, Turkey 
and Greece, agree on Kosovo but little else. And Turkey knows how 
to play the America card. One thing that really seems to annoy the 
Europeans is the impression of Turkey running off to big brother in 
Washington. All that plus lounge music from Dmitri. First, this news.
