From National Public Radio New in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff. 
nato Secretary General Javier Solana says the alliance has approved 
an order to activate air forces against Yugoslavia if Serbia refuses 
to comply with UN demands to end it's offensive against ethnic Albanians 
in Kosovo. The report has a 96-hour delay to give time to work out 
an agreement. Earlier today US envoy Richard Holbrooke briefed NATO 
officials in Brussels about his talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. At that time Holbrooke denied reports that he has reached 
a deal with Milosevic. That is not the case. We are discussing the 
situation in Kosovo in intense detail. Czech President Vosovo - that 
was US Envoy Richard Holbrooke. Czech President Vasilov Haval is criticizing 
world leaders for delaying action on Kosovo. Haval meeting with six 
Central European presidents in Vienna says, "NATO should carry out 
military strikes, since a diplomatic solution hasn't been reached 
with Yugoslavia on the troubled province." Edward Liffson reports 
from Berlin. Haval berated the international community for waiting, 
until it was past midnight, to possibly intervene in Kosovo. He said 
it should now be a duty of the European Union to supervise peace talks. 
Along with Haval the presidents of Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungary 
and Slovenia met. They issued a statement calling for a decisive and 
coherent action to end the fighting in Kosovo between the Serbs and 
the ethnic Albanians. The statement urged Belgrade to pull Serb troops 
out of the province. The Czech Republic is not yet a NATO member. 
But Haval gave his tacit approval to NATO's possible use of force. 
Although Haval also said that in the long term only dialogue could 
fully solve the problem. The Czech president told reporters that the 
West did not do all it could to prevent the human suffering and the 
killing. He said it's been clear for years that Kosovo was going to 
explode in violence. Edward Liffson NPR News, Berlin.
