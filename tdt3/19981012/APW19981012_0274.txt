MOSCOW (AP) _ NATO airstrikes against Serbia could encourage countries 
elsewhere to use force to solve disputes, Russia's foreign minister 
said in pressing his country's opposition to military action by the 
Western alliance. ``That is very dangerous because we can enter a 
phase of international chaos when states solve differences on borders 
with their methods, the use of force,'' Igor Ivanov said. He spoke 
Sunday on the Russian television program ``Zerkalo'' (Mirror). Russia 
opposes possible NATO airstrikes a Serbia, a traditional ally with 
which it shares a Slavic heritage and Orthodox religion. It has recalled 
its representative to NATO and its ambassador to Belgium, where NATO 
has its headquarters, for consultations. Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Vladimir Chizov said their return will depend on developments, the 
Interfax news agency reported Monday. Chizov, director of the Foreign 
Ministry's Third European Department, said Russia is staying in touch 
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and members of the Contact 
Group on Yugoslavia. The fact that U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is 
still holding talks in Belgrade suggests that an agreement is still 
possible, Chizov said. ``If Holbrooke reaches a political settlement 
acceptable to Belgrade, we will most probably support it,'' he said. 
Ivanov said Russia was still considering how it would respond if NATO 
went ahead with the airstrikes to force Serbia to end its violent 
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province. Ivanov said Sunday 
in Uzbekistan, where he is accompanying President Boris Yeltsin on 
an official visit, that a Russian military response was ``out of the 
question.'' ``We continue to believe and not only to believe but also 
to do everything to prevent the worst,'' he said on TV.
