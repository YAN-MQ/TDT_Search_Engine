A town in southern Russia has been sealed off after 70 residents were 
diagnosed with dysentery over the weekend, a news agency reported 
Monday. Health care workers in Verkhny Balyklei, about 900 kilometers 
(550 miles) southeast of Moscow, are still trying to figure out the 
cause of the outbreak, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Dysentery is 
an intestinal infection, whose symptoms include abdominal pain and 
severe diarrhea. Severe cases can prove fatal, particularly in unhealthy 
people, children or the elderly.
