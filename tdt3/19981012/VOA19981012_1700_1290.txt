American Lindsay Davenport is now officially the number-one women's 
player in the world. Davenport replaces Martina Hingis of Switzerland 
at the top of the weekly rankings that were issued Monday. The 22-year-old 
Davenport has dominated the WTA tour for much of the year, winning 
five titles and her first Grand Slam singles crown at the U.S. Open 
last month. Davenport has earned enough points in the past 12 months 
to overtake Hingis, despite losing Sunday in the final of the Porsche 
Grand Prix in Germany.
