This week, we're going to take "A closer look" at managed health care. 
150 million Americans are in managed care. We are now the HMO nation. 
But are we better off? Has managed care delivered the promise of improving 
health care while driving the costs down? Just look at how managed 
health care has grown since the mid-'80s, compared with the old system 
where you could go to any doctor and then submit the Bill to your 
insurance company. Along the way, the nation has been terrified by 
the change. We've all heard the HMO horror stories, we in the media 
tell them all the time. Yet, according to the most recent polls, 80% 
of us are satisfied with the care we are receiving today. I've not 
had a problem seeing a doctor when I needed to see a doctor. I feel 
the quality of care is very good. If there has been a physician that 
I have not liked, they have been very helpful in letting me switch 
to someone else. 600,000 doctors work in 6,000 hospitals in America, 
and the simplest explanation of managed care is that it links many 
of those doctors and hospitals into a more efficient system. The patient 
is a cost unit. Cost and care are administered by insurance companies. 
It's made us better because we have recognized now the value of standardizing 
our care, measuring outcomes and being responsible for our outcomes. 
Still, there are sacrifices. As managed care has occupied a higher 
percentage of my time, the amount of time I spend with patients has 
probably decreased proportionately. As one is coming in and one is 
going out, sometimes you feel you are working on an assembly line. 
As America has become an HMO nation, there have been significant savings. 
Insurance companies have cut premium costs for corporations to win 
new customers, to get market share in a competitive environment. But 
that can't obscure the fact that the cost of medical care itself continues 
to rise. America's annual health Bill in ten years will be $2 trillion. 
Twice what it is now. Raising the question, when costs and premiums 
do go up, will America be so satisfied with managed care?
