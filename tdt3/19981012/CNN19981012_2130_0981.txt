Chartering a plane for a business trip may sound extravagant. In some 
cases, it can be the best deal. Dan Ronan explains in this edition 
of "working ahead." Microtel chairman Mike leven is going to work. 
Today he's headed to Georgetown, Kentucky, to oversee the grand opening 
of the franchise company's 100th hotel. Okay. All right. Yeah. Leven 
is based in Atlanta. Georgetown has an airport. But there's no scheduled 
commercial jet service. The solution, charter a plane to fly him and 
his staff in for the day. Commercial doesn't go to some of the places 
we have to go. If it -- if commercial does go, sometimes the schedule 
doesn't work. Often times now it's very close to the same price if 
you're taking a lot of people because commercial fares have gone up 
for business travelers so much. The cost of flying this charter plane 
is about $3,000 a day. If you were to fly all of the passengers on 
a commercial jet in first class, it would be a little less. Still, 
if you pay for the charter with a charge card, you'd accumulate frequent-flier 
miles. There are nearly 700 airports in the U.S. that can handle commercial 
jets. But there are nearly 5,500 smaller facilities for general aviation. 
More companies are finding that, with crowded airports and tight schedules, 
flying on a charter makes economic sense and improves morale. It's 
not an extravagance, it's as a necessity of business today. And in 
fact, 84% of the people who fly on corporate jets are not the top 
management. They're engineering teams, they're people who are traveling 
in order to get to a factory or something like that. Leven and his 
team would spend about two hours in Kentucky, meeting with hotel investors, 
employees and residents. The time in the air makes them more efficient. 
Generally, I will take two, three or four people with me on one of 
these trips. We usually hold a meeting on the plane. It's a casual, 
more relaxed atmosphere. You certainly can't do that on a commercial 
airline. So you are using the time that you're in the air to conduct 
business. But this CEO flies regular commercial flights when that 
is more cost-effective, as he did this day, catching a flight from 
Cincinnati to Boston. Dan Ronan, CNN, Cincinnati, Ohio.
