Discontent with Prime Minister Mahathir's 17-year-rule is swelling 
the ranks of an Islamic group that is leading the anti-government 
campaign and triggering defections from the ruling party, a party 
official said Monday. In the last month, the Parti Islamic SeMalaysia 
or PAS, a conservative group, had enrolled 5,000 new members, said 
Subky Latif, a spokesman. He said PAS was running out of application 
forms. The party's president, Fadzil Mohamad Nor said Sunday he had 
received 500 applications from members of the ruling United Malays 
National Organization. An UMNO official Monday confirmed the defections. 
``It is good riddance, the party will become stronger after their 
departure,'' said Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar, who is in UMNO's 
managing committee. ``More people are supporting us now than ever 
before,'' said Salahuddin Ayub, a PAS youth wing official. Mahathir's 
party depends on the majority Malay Muslims for its support, a constituency 
that PAS is now encroaching on. More than half the country's 22 million 
people are Malay Muslims who have traditionally voted UMNO to power 
since Malaysia became independent in 1957. PAS recently alarmed the 
government by winning a by-election in the northern Perlis state in 
July. That victory gave the party a total of 8 seats of 192 in parliament. 
UMNO has always controlled more than two-thirds of the seats. Mahathir 
has denied that UMNO's strength is being corroded by the campaign 
set off by the firing and later arrest of his deputy prime minister, 
Anwar Ibrahim. Malaysians were shocked when Anwar was arrested under 
the harsh Internal Security Act and stunned weeks later when he appeared 
in court with a black eye and body bruises, alleging police brutality. 
Anwar, who faces trial on corruption and sexual misconduct charges, 
has denied any wrongdoing. He says the charges are politically motivated 
to silence him, at a time when he is emerging as the biggest challenge 
against Mahathir. Many Malaysians are angry. On city streets and rural 
roads around the country, they have rallied by the thousands, shouting 
``Mahathir resign!'' and demanding justice for Anwar. Anwar's arrest 
has also been a catalyst for opposition unity. PAS and other Muslim 
groups have for the first time allied with the opposition Democratic 
Action Party, which is dominated by ethnic Chinese. ``Anwar held the 
promise of a new political tomorrow,'' said Lim Kit Siang, the head 
of the DAP and Anwar's one time political foe. ``Now Anwar has become 
a symbol.'' The People's Justice Movement, with PAS and DAP as the 
major components, has successfully organized rallies in defiance of 
police bans. Crowds of more than 10,000 have turned out to its rallies 
in several parts of the country, where the group has demanded justice 
for Anwar and an end to the Internal Security Act.
