In other news, an Islamic group in Iran, has increased the bounty 
being offered, to anyone who kills the British author Salman Rushdie. 
The reward now amounts to almost 3 million dollars. Last month the 
Iranian government distanced itself from any orders to kill Rushdie. 
And full diplomatic relations were restored with Britain. Jim Eure 
reports from Cairo. Britain accepted along that the death ruling or 
Fatuah issued against Salmon Rushdie by the late Ayatollah Khomeinie 
couldn't be repealed. Because only its author could rescind it. But 
they also turned a blind eye to the huge reward offered for Mr. Rushdie's 
death by an Iranian foundations. The foundation has now signaled that 
both it and the fatuah are very much alive and kicking. Jim Eure BBC 
News, Cairo.
