French authorities on Monday announced the discovery of another cow 
infected with mad cow disease _ the 12th case in France this year. 
The Agriculture Ministry said the infected animal was a milk cow born 
in 1994 at a farm in the Orne region, west of Paris. Conforming to 
French regulation, the farm's 137 other cows were slaughtered as well. 
Since 1990, 43 cases of mad cow disease have been reported in France, 
the ministry said. The disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, 
was first detected in 1985. The ailment eats holes in the brain, causing 
cattle to stagger and drool. There is no cure. Scientists believe 
the mad cow disease may be linked to an equally fatal human brain 
ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
