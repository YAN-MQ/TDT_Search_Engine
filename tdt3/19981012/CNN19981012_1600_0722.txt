What would you do for a million dollar Bill? A woman in Sri Lanka 
is doing jail time after she tried to peddle a fake one. The woman 
was arrested when authorities realized there's no such thing as a 
million dollar Bill. Investigators say she was trying to sell it for 
$690,000. Too good to be true. The fake Bill had a picture of the 
statue of liberty and it was signed by the "international association 
of millionaires." Yeah, right.
