Monica Lewinsky is not in the running for any Nobel prizes, but she 
has earned international recognition. In Kenya she has been spotted 
on the back of a bus. Kenya's bus drivers often paint slogans on their 
vehicles reflecting popular news events. And on the back of one bus 
that runs between Nairobi and a town in the Rift Valley, are the words, 
"Monica Lewinsky". On the mudflaps is an even bigger sign saying, 
"Bill's Gal". The bus also sports a painting of a bikini-clad Monica 
pouting provocatively.
