A U.S.-based human rights group has called for a full investigation 
into the murder of an Indonesian woman who had been counseling rape 
victims. Jenny Grant reports from Jakarta, Human Rights Watch Asia 
appealed Monday for better protection for those working with those 
targeted during the May riots. The New York-based Human Rights Watch 
says it wants an independent investigation into the murder of Martadinata 
Ita Haryono, an ethnic Chinese Indonesian. The 18-year-old's body 
was found stabbed in her parents' central Jakarta home last Friday. 
Ms. Martadinata and her mother had been counseling rape victims from 
the May riots. The organization she was involved with, Volunteers 
For Humanity, says 168 mainly ethnic Chinese women were raped during 
the three days of unrest. Police say the murder is purely a criminal 
case. They've arrested one suspect whom they say broke into Ms. Martadinata's 
house to steal goods and killed her when she surprised him. Some human 
rights activists here allege police have framed the young man who 
lived next door to the high school student. Jakarta police chief, 
Major General Nugroho Jiusman, said Monday police have found no connection 
between Ms. Martadinata's volunteer work and her death. But in a one-page 
statement, Human Rights Watch says Martadinata's murder has escalated 
a campaign to terrorize the people investigating the rapes. At least 
four other volunteers working with rape survivors have received threatening 
calls since the issue of the rapes first arose. There is widespread 
speculation that members of paramilitary organizations helped to orchestrate 
the riots last May, which left more than 1,000 people dead. A government-backed 
joint fact-finding team is still investigating the riots and reported 
rapes. The team is due to report at the end of October. This is Jenny 
Grant, reporting for VOA News, Jakarta.
