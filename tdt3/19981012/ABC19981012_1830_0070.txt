Good evening. The question tonight, are you U.S. warplanes about to 
strike in Europe? In Brussels today, the United States and it's allies 
have been preparing for a vote on whether to authorize military strikes 
against the Serbs. Over the last several months, -- former Yugoslavia, 
hundreds have been killed, more than 250,000 forced to flee their 
homes. But so far, diplomacy has not detered the Serbs. Will it now? 
ABC's John McWethy. Tonight U.S. officials say a deal to end this 
crisis may be in reach. NAto is expected to take a step closer to 
air strikes anyway, trying to reassure themselves, that Slobodan Milosevic, 
the loader of Serbia, will not reverse himself. It's a negotiating 
tactic that gives Richard Holbrooke, who arrived in before us lz tonight, 
maximum leverage as he pushes Milosevic on the final details. He has 
had 50 hours of tough negotiations with Milosevic who only began to 
bend when the threats by NAto began to look real. Across Europe today, 
combat aircraft continued to move into position, F-18s from Canada 
and Spain, F-15s from the U.S. We are ready right now if called upon, 
if the political authorities said it is necessary to do this. In Belgrade, 
with tension mounting, western diplomats and their families rushed 
to get out of the country. In Kosovo, many relief workers that had 
been helping to feed the 250,000 refugees were abandoning their positions 
and heading for safer territory. One positive sign -- more Serb police 
were leaving Kosovo as demanded by the west. But to avoid air strikes, 
many other conditions must also be met -- and U.S. sources say Milosevic 
has now agreed to most of them. Immediate peace talks between the 
Serbs and the ethnic Albanians they rule, a force of 2,000 international 
monitors in Kosovo, to make sure all sides are living up to the agreement, 
cooperation with the U.N. war crimes tribunal in investigate massacres. 
Full access by relief workers. The U.S. is also insisting on overflights 
of Kosovo by NATO spy planes. They are making the Serbs promise not 
to turn on the radar of their missile batteries. It is one of many 
conditions, if violated, could still cause an immediate military response 
by NATO. Charlie. All right. John McWethy at the Pentagon.
