Pakistan's stock market tumbled 9.45 percent Monday as the Karachi 
Stock Exchange reacted violently to the cancellation of a contract 
with the country's largest private power company, dealers said. The 
government also initiated criminal investigations against senior officials 
of the Hub Power Company, which has denied the corruption charges 
and said it will respond through its lawyers once it receives formal 
notices from the authorities. Late Monday the Hubco office in southern 
Karachi's posh Clifton district was raided by federal officials who 
confiscated company files, said company officials, who didn't want 
to be identified. So far no one has been arrested, despite charges 
filed by the government. It's not clear whether the office was sealed 
or whether business would continue to operate. The premier Karachi 
Stock Exchange 100-share index slumped 89.07 points, or 9.45 percent, 
to 852.75 points by Monday's close. The KSE index shed 159 points 
during the past week, the biggest fall this year. ``The Karachi index 
could hit an all time low owing to this news,'' said Shakil Anwar, 
a dealer at Prudential Securities. Hub Power 10-rupee shares fell 
4.55 rupees to 9.50. ``We should now forget about new fresh foreign 
investment in the market for a long time to come. The individual investors 
and institutions all have taken a severe beating,'' Anwar said. Hub 
Power _ the second largest company listed on the exchange _ is considered 
a bellwether. Pakistan's government also has warned that it is looking 
to cancel or renegotiate contracts with other power companies. The 
cancellation of the contract follows months of wrangling between the 
government and Hub Power, in which Sharif accused the largely British-owned 
company of charging inflated tariffs for electricity it sell to the 
cash-strapped state utility. The contract was signed by former prime 
minister Benazir Bhutto's government. The government lodged two criminal 
cases of fraud, commissions and electricity theft against senior company 
officials. Several key officials of Ms. Bhutto former government also 
have been charged, he said. Sentiment is weak due to the country's 
crumbling economy, political instability and government's dispute 
with the private power companies, the said. Cash-strapped Pakistan 
is scrambling for loans from internationpromised foreign loan and 
aid are not restored.
