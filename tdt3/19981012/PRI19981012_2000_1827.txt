For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom in London. 
nato has given the go-ahead for military action against Serbian forces 
in Yugoslavia. Air strikes can now be mounted if necessary, to persuade 
President Slobodan Milosevic to abide by United Nation's resolutions 
on Kosovo. But any operation has been postponed for four days, to 
allow for more negotiations. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana 
announced their decision. The North Atlantic Council decided to issue 
Activation Orders for both limited air strikes in a phased air campaign 
in Yugoslavia. Execution of which will begin no earlier than 96 hours 
from today. NATO Secretary Javier Solana. The decision came after 
NATO ambassadors in Brussels heard a briefing from American Envoy 
Richard Holbrooke, from his talks in Belgrade. Mr. Holbrooke, himself, 
has now gone back to Serbia for more talks with President Milosevic. 
The people of Yugoslavia are facing up to the possibility that threat 
of air strikes could become a reality. From Belgrade, Jackie Roland 
reports. For more than a week, people have been living with the threat 
of bombardment by NATO, maybe sooner, maybe later. Most of the practical 
preparations have already been made. Town and city authorities have 
been testing air raid sirens and drawing up lists of air raid shelters. 
They have been stockpiling basic foods: flour, sugar, oil, and tin 
goods, as if in preparation for a siege. People are afraid, but above 
all the mood is one of incomprehension and resignation. Jackie Roland 
reporting.
