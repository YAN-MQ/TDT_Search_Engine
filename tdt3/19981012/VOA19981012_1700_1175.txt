New York Yankees outfielder Daryl Strawberry is expected to remain 
hospitalized for at least two more days as he recovers from colon 
cancer surgery earlier this month. Strawberry, who was originally 
expected to be released from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New 
York as early as Sunday, remains in stable condition. The Yankees 
team physician says Strawberry is still weak and needs to regain his 
strength. The 36-year-old outfielder had a 40-centimeter portion of 
his large intestine removed during a three-hour operation to rid him 
of a 7-centimeter malignant tumor.
