Texas authorities are using fingerprints to identify six people who 
were killed this morning when they were struck by a union pacific 
freight train. Investigators say they may have been sleeping on the 
tracks. The accident happened before dawn, near the town of norias, 
about 60-miles north of Brownsville. A union pacific spokesman says 
the crew saw people lying between the tracks, but couldn't stop in 
time. Authorities say illegal immigrants entering the United States 
sometimes sleep between tracks because they erroneously believe it 
will protect them from snakes.
