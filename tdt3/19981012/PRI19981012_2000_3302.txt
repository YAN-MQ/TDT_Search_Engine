Welcome to the exciting world of hip. This is a new departure in language 
instruction. For English speaking who want to talk to and be understood 
by Jazz musicians, hipsters, beatniks and juvenile delinquents and 
the criminal fringe. Oh welcome to the strange world, the French world 
of Dmitri. Sit back, relax, close your lives. For years Dmitri From 
Paris - that is his whole name and, yes, he is from Paris - has been 
a dominant figure on the European club scene. But it wasn't until 
this year that the mercurial Frenchman showed he is more than just 
a disc spinner. Dmitri did it with this album of lounge music. Ladies 
and gentlemen, madam and herron, mademoiselle and mister . Nothing 
to lose if we are wise. We're not expecting April not by the way. 
One wonders if Dmitri plotted with Burt Bacharach on this track, "Nothing 
To Lose". But if Dmitri seems to be overly derivative of American 
lounge music, just check, "In Very Stylish Fee". I am a very stylish 
girl. How do I look? Very good. How do I look? How do I look? Pretty 
good. I must say I'm amazed. Post-modern lounge music, courtesy of 
Dmitri, brings this edition of the program to a close.
