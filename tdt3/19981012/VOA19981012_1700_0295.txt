Three American pharmacologists, whose discoveries led to the use of 
the anti-impotence drug, Viagra, have won the 1998 Nobel Prize for 
medicine. Robert Furchgott, Lewis Ignarro and Ferid Murad were named 
the winners Monday in Stockholm for their discoveries about the role 
of nitric oxide in the body. Mr. Muraud said he's surprising, excited 
and very happy about the award, while Mr. Purchcott says he's pleased 
but not sure that he deserved the honor. DR. ROBERT FURCHGOTT, 1998 
NOBEL PRIZE FOR MEDICINE WINNER: I know what I have done is considered 
important, and I consider it important. But I just don't know that 
I'm up to a Nobel standard. The Swedish Academy, which awards the 
Nobel Prize, praised the researchers for discovering how molecules 
of nitric oxide transmit signals to blood vessels. Well, that's the 
latest. I'm Robert Burns, VOA News.
