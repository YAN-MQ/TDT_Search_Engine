Two people died at a hospital here to raise the death toll to three 
from violence at a ruling-party rally, officials said Monday. The 
victims had been beaten Sunday by supporters of the ruling Lesotho 
Congress for Democracy after a shot was fired by an unidentified person. 
The crowd believed the victims were opposition party supporters who 
had infiltrated the rally and allegedly were trying to plant a bomb, 
the South African Press Association reported. Dr. Thabo McPherson, 
superintendent at Queen Elizabeth II Hospital, said the two people 
died on Sunday night from severe head injuries, SAPA reported. A fourth 
person was in critical condition, also with serious head injuries. 
Another person died at the scene. The violence has raised tensions 
in the mountain kingdom of 2 million people within South Africa's 
borders. After an army revolt and crippling strikes, South Africa 
and nearby Botswana last month sent about 1,000 troops into the country 
to restore calm, but scores were killed and the downtown destroyed 
by looters.
