Pieces of coal fell in a deep mine shaft in eastern Ukraine on Monday, 
killing a miner, officials said. The accident occurred at the depth 
of 540 meters (1,782 feet) at the Olkhovatska mine in the coal-rich 
Donetsk region, the Emergency Situations Ministry reported. At least 
302 people have died in coal mine accidents in Ukraine so far this 
year, about 100 more than the same period last year, according to 
government statistics. Ukraine's cash-strapped mines lack the funds 
needed to improve safety conditions and modernize equipment, which 
has led to a steady increase in work-related fatalities in recent 
years. The worst single accident this year was in April, when a methane 
gas blast killed 63 workers at a mine in Donetsk.
