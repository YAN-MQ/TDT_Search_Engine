This look at your "Headline News weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Tuesday morning. It's been quite dry through much 
of the nation, and dry weather generally will continue. Although, 
some rainfall -- significant rainfall -- will accompany a cold front 
moving in through the northwestern corner of the United States. Look 
for some rainfall in the northern Great Lakes area and perhaps a bit 
of snowfall, too. Now, as we put this map in motion, you can see the 
cold front in the east moving rather slowly, but the cold front coming 
in through the northwest moves rapidly down through the far west and 
into the Rockies, yet much of the rainfall associated with it remains 
in the northwestern corner of the United States. Some places in the 
southwest could see a shower or two. We do have some cool weather 
on the map. As you can see, daytime highs only in the 40s in the upper 
midwest and Great Lakes area for Tuesday. Meanwhile, for the south, 
temperatures are still quite warm. In your extended forecast on Wednesday, 
rain showers cover parts of the north, cool temperatures still in 
place. We jump ahead to Thursday, and you can see rainfall still in 
the northwest and still quite cool in that part of the country. And 
by week's end, we're looking at rainfall covering much of the plains 
states, northern plains states might see some snowfall mixed in with 
it. For more weather information, log on to CNN.com, four-day forecasts
