New Yorkers turned out in droves today for the 54th annual Columbus 
day parade. 33 floats and an estimated 60,000 marchers made their 
way up fifth avenue past central park. In keeping with the theme, 
an 18-foot replica of one of Christopher Columbus's ships, the Santa 
Maria, set her sails for the 35-block voyage. And in the city named 
after Columbus, protesters marked "indigenous people's day." They 
are against Columbus day, saying Columbus did not actually discover 
America.
