Thailand loses about 20 billion baht (dlrs 500 million) annually in 
potential export earnings from livestock because of diseases brought 
in by smuggled animals, a Bangkok newspaper said Monday. As many as 
1 million heads of cattle have been smuggled from Myanmar, Laos and 
Cambodia _ Thailand's neighboring countries _ into 26 provinces, and 
some have brought in such diseases as hoof and mouth disease and anthrax, 
a bacterial infection, the Bangkok Post reported. The spread of such 
diseases among livestock in Thailand has caused importing countries 
to look elsewhere for their supplies, the report quoted Deputy Agriculture 
Minister Somchai Sunthornwat as saying. The agriculture ministry's 
livestock development department hopes to be able to stop the import 
of all diseased animals and eliminate hoof and mouth diseases by 2005, 
the newspaper said. More than 1 billion baht (dlrs 25 million) have 
been spent already over 10 years to combat the problem. The Japan 
International Cooperation Agency and the United Nations' Food and 
Agriculture Organization are now considering making Thailand the center 
for animal disease control for the region, the Post said. Japanese 
officials will be visiting Thailand next month for assessment before 
offering financial aid, it reported.
