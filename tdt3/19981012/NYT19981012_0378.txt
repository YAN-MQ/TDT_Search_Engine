The White House and Republican congressional leaders are close to 
an agreement to provide $18 billion to the International Monetary 
Fund in exchange for new conditions on the fund's loans to foreign 
governments, Clinton administration and congressional officials said 
on Monday. The officials said the deal, which they expect to be announced 
this week as part of an overall budget settlement, would require that 
the IMF raise the interest rates on most loans and shorten the repayment 
periods. Congressional officials said that although some details of 
the legislation were under negotiation, the package would probably 
require loans to be repaid in two and a half years. The lending conditions 
had been sought by House Republicans, who opposed the full $18 billion 
in financing that the administration had requested to help the fund 
as it tries to avert a global economic crisis. The money would go 
to replenish accounts that were depleted by efforts to bail out the 
economies of Russia and three Asian nations. Prominent Republican 
lawmakers have contended that billions of dollars that went to the 
bailouts were squandered and that liberal lending had encouraged some 
nations to pursue reckless policies. The legislation is widely expected 
to single out South Korea, one of the three Asian nations that received 
a bailout, and to demand that the IMF bar further loans to South Korea 
if the government tries to use any of the money to underwrite specific 
domestic industries that have been especially hard hit. The Clinton 
administration has begun to consult other nations that are large shareholders 
in the IMF about what lending conditions to impose.
