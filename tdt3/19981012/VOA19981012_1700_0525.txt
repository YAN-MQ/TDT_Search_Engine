Amid all the uncertainties in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province, 
life continues for some two million residents. The cafes, as always, 
are full of people chatting, drinking coffee and reading newspapers. 
And as we hear from correspondent Art Chimes in the provincial capital, 
Pristina, some of them are reading a new daily paper. Interpress Company 
is a leading publisher in Kosovo, and it puts out four out of five 
textbooks used in the classrooms of the province's separate Albanian 
language school system. The company's month-old newspaper, Kosovosat, 
sees itself as a centrist alternative to Pristina's two existing Albanian 
language newspapers. Publisher Ruse DeCadre who says the competing 
papers each have their own political agenda. He simply wants his paper 
to convey the truth. Mr. DeCadre, who says his first aim is to be 
objective. But he says the newspaper also wants to educate Kosovo's 
students and young people to think constructively about the issues 
in their lives. Kosovosat is organizing roundtable gatherings of students, 
educators, intellectuals and others to discuss some of these issues, 
and it prints summaries of those meetings in the paper. That focus 
on education is not too surprising, since the paper's parent company 
is Kosovo's largest textbook publisher. The paper's 63 staff members 
are themselves mostly young, giving them a special affinity for younger 
readers. The newspaper's managing editor, Marguerita Cadriou, is only 
24 and finished her management studies in Vienna just two years ago. 
Education is the most important thing, because if the young people, 
you know, students, pupils, they have good entire education, then 
we have better future, a better society, healthy society. Kosovosat 
is launching a full-color international edition this week to be printed 
in Germany with sales in several European countries where ethnic Albanians 
live. Conspicuously absent from the distribution list is Albania itself, 
where Mr. DeCadre, the publisher, says authorities in Belgrade will 
not allow him to sell the paper. The paper is especially proud of 
the daily half-page news digest in English. Despite sales of 12,000 
to 14,000 copies a day, Kosovosat is losing money and, for now, is 
effectively being subsidized by Interpress Company's other publications.
