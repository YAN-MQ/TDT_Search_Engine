Prime Minister Antonio Guterres announced Monday tough new measures 
against graft in an effort to defuse pressure on his government over 
a high-level kickback scandal. The measures included the creation 
of a powerful anti-corruption unit that will immediately probe recent 
allegations that political parties for the past six years received 
kickbacks for awarding public roadbuilding contracts, Guterres said. 
In a televised address to the nation, Guterres said new staff will 
be recruited and trained to detect white-collar crimes, especially 
corruption in state-owned companies. He also unveiled a witness protection 
program, access to suspects' bank accounts, and tighter controls on 
public works contracts. ``I don't want a Portugal where crimes are 
committed with impunity,'' Guterres said. Guterres put the final touches 
to the anti-corruption package during a two-hour meeting earlier in 
the day with Justice Minister Jose Vera Jardim and Attorney-General 
Jose Cunha Rodrigues. The illegal party financing scandal erupted 
when Garcia dos Santos, the former head of the state-run national 
roadbuilder JAE, alleged that officials and parties had received payoffs 
to grant public works contracts to some construction companies. The 
Attorney-General launched an investigation into graft at the JAE four 
years ago, after businessmen made similar allegations. He dropped 
the case a year later because of a lack of evidence and complained 
of a lack of manpower to deepen the probe. Garcia dos Santos, who 
quit as JAE President in June, was quoted in the weekly Expresso newspaper 
claiming that members of the current Socialist government knew about 
the corruption. The allegations rocked Guterres's minority Socialist 
government after Garcia dos Santos received a personal letter from 
Finance Minister Antonio Sousa Franco saying he knew of government 
members who allegedly connived in the scam. Sousa Franco said he had 
also informed the Attorney-General of his suspicions. Meanwhile, Infrastructure 
and Transport Minister Joao Cravinho insisted that internal inquiries 
had found no evidence of corruption in his ministry. Sousa Franco 
and Cravinho had previously clashed over funding for local authorities. 
Relations between the two ministers reportedly are tense. The current 
Socialist government, in office in 1995, and the previous Social Democrat 
government have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on roadbuilding 
programs since Portugal joined the European Union in 1986.
