Leading economists and businessmen disagreed Monday on solutions for 
Asia's financial turmoil but warned that a mishandling of the situation 
could lead to the world's worst economic crisis in more than 50 years. 
``Asia is facing its most severe economic crisis,'' Singapore Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong said in his keynote address at an East Asia 
Economic Summit. ``And the global outlook for 1999 does not look promising.'' 
Noting that the ``Asian contagion'' has spread and that investors 
are retreating from all emerging markets, Goh said that globalization 
is not the cause of the financial crisis. ``Retreat from globalization 
is not the solution. If the region had not been plugged into the global 
economy in the first place, there would have been no Asian miracle 
to begin with,'' Goh said. Goh urged the international community, 
especially the United States, to play a more vital role in Asia's 
recovery and release more funds to the International Monetary Fund, 
which is overseeing bailouts in the region. Goh is one of only two 
leaders to participate in the seventh annual East Asian summit organized 
by the World Economic Forum, a private agency based in Switzerland 
that brings political and business leaders together. Philippine president 
Joseph Estrada is scheduled to address the gathering Tuesday. Other 
participants warned that lack of leadership could worsen the economic 
troubles. They agreed that the rapid spread of economic turmoil to 
Russia, South America and the U.S. stock market showed that global 
solutions will be needed. ``We have to see this as a global issue, 
as a global challenge, and the solution should be at the global level,'' 
said Jusuf Wanandi, chairman of Indonesia's Center for Strategic International 
Studies. But they differed on whether the solutions should focus on 
the internal policies and plights of affected countries, or on the 
growing uncertain impact of globalization on the world economy. Clyde 
Prestowitz, president of the U.S.-based Economic Strategy Institute, 
said the worsening of the crisis over the past year shows that Asian 
countries should reconsider their most basic economic fundamentals 
_ even traditional values such as high personal savings rates that 
have been credited with the region's previous economic success. Unless 
they increase domestic spending, there will not be enough demand for 
the region's products because of weakening consumption around the 
world, he said. Kenneth Courtis, chief economist for Deutsche Bank 
Group Asia Pacific, said the drive toward globalization is going to 
increase, and countries will not be able to sidestep it. He said the 
Asian crisis has intensified in recent months because of a credit 
crunch and lower demand caused by slowing economic growth around the 
world. ``We are today at a critical juncture,'' Courtis said. ``If 
we don't reverse course we face the biggest crisis since the 1930s.'' 
He called a recent offer by Japan to provide dlrs 30 billion in loans 
to help Asian nations out of the crisis ``very positive,'' but said 
that would only partly offset the credit squeeze caused by cutbacks 
in loans by troubled Japanese banks in the region. To escape the crisis, 
Japan will need to spend about dlrs 1 trillion to solve its banking 
problems and stimulate its economy, he said. ``Japan can be a locomotive 
pulling the region out of its crisis. If not, it becomes a Titanic 
pulling the region under,'' Courtis said.
