Cleaning up Japan's banking system is critical to turning around the 
global economic slowdown. ABC's Mark Litke has been to the northernmost 
island of haikido, where it's possible to see what could happen all 
over Japan if the banks aren't fixed soon. With its beautiful countryside 
and comfortable lifestyle, the island of hokkaido was often rated 
the best place to live in Japan. Then came the banking crisis. One 
year ago, this bank, the hokkaido takushoku bank, the biggest in the 
region, collapsed under a mountain of debt. From loan defaults, risky 
investments, mismanagement. The failure set off a financial chain 
reaction that has now turned hokkaido into an economic basket case. 
Local journalist shigehiro saito gave us a tour of the carnage. First, 
hundreds of small businesses that depended on the takushoku bank for 
loans were forced into bankruptcy. Others fear they'll be next. There 
are few customers and no other banks willing to support them through 
the hard times. Construction, once the biggest employer in the region, 
has almost ground to a halt. Banks had fueled a decade of real estate 
speculation here. But massive overbuilding left banks holding billions 
of dollars in unrecoverable loans. Takushoku bank held half of them. 
Next to go, the key tourism industry. The countryside is dotted with 
empty hotels and failed luxury resorts. Rurt communities that counseledded 
on tourists are now ghost towns. In the past year, tens of thousands 
have lost their jobs in hokkaido. And shell-shocked government officials 
say it will get worse before it gets better. Journalist saito says 
everyone here knows there's no more time to waste in fixing Japan's 
troubled banks. The longer it takes, he says, the more the rest of 
Japan will look and feel like hokkaido. And he should know. Saito's 
own newspaper just went belly up, and he has joined the ranks of the 
unemployed. Mark Litke, ABC News, hokkaido, Japan.
