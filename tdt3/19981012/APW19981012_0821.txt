European Union finance ministers dug in Monday for what is expected 
to be a long battle over how to share out the EU's dlrs 100 million 
annual budget. Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden say they 
pay too much into the EU's coffers compared with what they get back 
in benefits, and demand the money be divvied up more fairly. ``There 
is a lack of burden-sharing in the budget,'' German Finance Minister 
Theo Waigel told a news conference. ``This is something that cannot 
be continued under the new system.'' Monday's day-long meeting of 
the 15 EU finance ministers, was Waigel's last after almost 10 year's. 
He is stepping down following the center-right government's defeat 
in last month's elections. However, the incoming Social Democrat-led 
administration is not expected to relax Germany's stance. ``Any German 
government that abandoned that line would be doing itself a disservice,'' 
Waigel claimed. Resistance from other nations, notably France and 
Spain, seems sure to ensure that the budget wrangle will drag on until 
the deadline of June 1999. French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn 
said any budget reform should also look at the special deal won for 
Britain in 1984 by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when she 
famously told other EU leaders ``we want our money back.'' ``Either 
we open the whole contributions file or we keep in closed,'' Strauss-Kahn 
told reporters. ``We cannot have half measures.'' Britain's Chancellor 
of the Exchequer Gordon Brown insisted there can be no tampering with 
the payback deal which is estimated to save Britain about 2 billion 
pounds (dlrs 3.4 billion) a year. Aside from who pays what, the budget 
reforms will seek to completely overhaul EU spending for the six year's 
starting in 2000, a period when Cyprus and five eastern European nations 
are expected to join the Union. A key to success will be a reform 
of the EU's farm subsidy program which currently eats up half of the 
overall budget.
