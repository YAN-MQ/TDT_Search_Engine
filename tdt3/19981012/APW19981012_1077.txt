Forest fires raced through more than a dozen homes in northern and 
central Israel for a third day Monday, forcing officials to evacuate 
three villages in what has been described as the biggest series of 
fires in the country's history. No fatalities or serious injuries 
were reported. At least 10 fires were reported, though no exact count 
on the number of blazes was available. The biggest fire was on the 
slopes of the Carmel range south of Haifa, Israel's third-biggest 
city. Firefighters said it was even bigger than Sunday's blaze in 
the Carmel Forest on the outskirts of Haifa, which claimed 1,250 acres 
(500 hectares). It was unclear, however, how many acres were burned 
Monday. With temperatures hovering at 90 degrees (32 C) accompanied 
by high winds, the blaze spread to the picturesque artist's village 
of Ein Hod, the nearby Arab village of Ein Chud and the communal village 
of Nir Etzion in the Carmel forest. All three villages were evacuated. 
Fourteen houses in Ein Hod were destroyed or damaged. Some historic 
homes were damaged in nearby Zichron Yaacov. Air force helicopters 
and civilian crop-spraying light aircraft were brought in to help 
the firefighters. Smaller fires broke out again Monday in the Carmel 
Forest below the Haifa neighborhood of Deniya, where thousands of 
residents were evacuated Sunday. Forest fires also broke out near 
Jerusalem and in Western Galilee. Near Jerusalem, a fire set off mines 
in an old minefield, though no one was hurt. Authorities suspect that 
a fire in the Jerusalem hills was started deliberately, Police Commissioner 
Yehuda Wilk said. Most of the other fires are believed to be the result 
of negligence, coupled with recent hot dry weather. In central Israel 
four Israeli Arabs were arrested on suspicion of starting fires over 
the past two weeks in the Wadi Ara area, Wilk said. Police and Arab 
residents recently clashed in the area over a land dispute.
