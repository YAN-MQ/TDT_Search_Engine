Defense Minister Andrija Hebrang resigned unexpectedly Monday, signifying 
a rift within President Franjo Tudjman's ruling party. Hebrang, who 
has been a devoted Tudjman supporter, also said he would no longer 
head the medical team taking care of the 76-year-old Tudjman. In addition, 
he resigned the position of the vice president of Tudjman's Croatian 
Democratic Union. In his letter to Tudjman, released by the state-run 
news agency HINA, Hebrang made it clear that Tudjman's failure to 
uphold his attempts to replace two of his associates prompted him 
to resign. Hebrang did not name the two, although it has long been 
known that Hebrang wanted to get rid of Markica Rebic, head of military 
counter-intelligence, and Vlado Zagorac, who leads the ministry's 
firm for arms purchases.
