Four people are in the hospital after a fire broke out at the top 
of a St. Louis high-rise. Police say it began as a report that a mattress 
caught fire on the 21st floor and the flames spread quickly above. 
The building is a home for older and disabled people. Hospital officials 
say a firefighter is in critical but stable condition. An older resident 
also is in stable condition. Two other firefighters are being treated 
for smoke inhalation.
