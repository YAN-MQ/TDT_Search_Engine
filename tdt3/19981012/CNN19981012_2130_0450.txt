The FBI will open its national DNA database tomorrow. It unites the 
DNA databases of the 50 states. The system will enable police to compare 
genetic material from suspects and crime scenes across the country. 
Advocates say it could significantly reduce rape and other crimes 
by helping to catch repeat offenders. Critics say it could unfairly 
target people based on past criminal acts. By law, only the DNA of 
convicted criminals can be included in the database. It can be used 
only for law enforcement.
