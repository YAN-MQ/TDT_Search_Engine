Congolese rebels have found the wreckage of a Congolese airliner they 
shot down two weeks ago, Radio Rwanda said Saturday. A journalist 
from the Rwandan state radio, who went to the crash site about 15 
kilometers (9 miles) southwest of the eastern town of Kindu with soldiers, 
said he saw bodies wearing military uniforms scattered around the 
wreckage. The plane caught on fire when it was downed by a rebel missle 
Oct. 10, the radio said. Rebels who were attacking Kindu, 380 kilometers 
(235 miles) southwest of the Rwandan border, said they shot the plane 
down because it was a military target. The rebels said the plane was 
carrying government troops, and they knew of its flight details in 
advance by monitoring communications of government troops defending 
Kindu. The rebels and their Rwandan allies captured Kindu and its 
strategic air base Oct. 13. No indepedent confirmation of the find 
was possible. Last week in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, the private 
Congo Airlines, which owned the aircraft, claimed searchers had located 
the wreckage and bodies of the 40 civilian passengers who had been 
fleeing Kindu. President Laurent Kabila accuses Rwanda and neighboring 
Uganda of supporting the rebels with troops, arms and money. The rebels 
launched rebellion on Aug. 2, accusing Kabila of mismanagement, corruption 
and tribalism. They now face the threat of an offensive against their 
eastern strongholds, including Kindu, by Kabila's allies from Zimbabwe, 
Angola and Namibia. Chad has also sent troops to Congo to back Kabila. 
Sudan denies claims its troops are in Congo fighting on the government 
side.
