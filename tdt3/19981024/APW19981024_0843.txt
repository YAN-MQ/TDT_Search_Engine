They've argued, traded insults and questioned each other's reasoning 
for years. On Sunday, pals Bruce Arena and Bob Bradley can scowl at 
each other across the field at the Rose Bowl while their opposing 
teams try to win the Major League Soccer championship. Arena, whose 
D.C. United will be going for a third MLS Cup victory in three years, 
and Bradley, who guided the expansion Chicago Fire into the title 
game, have a long and successful history together. Included are championships 
in both previous MLS Cup games played by the 3-year-old league; Bradley 
was Arena's assistant before leaving for Chicago. United midfielder 
John Harkes smiled as he recalled practices while Bradley was working 
under Arena. ``I think they tried to keep it down to about three arguments 
a day,'' he said. Arena, considered the leading candidate to become 
the next coach of the U.S. national team coach, described the relationship 
between him and Bradley as ``like being married.'' ``We've always 
gone through that kind of thing,'' he said. ``We disagree, and then 
I'm right.'' At least on that score, Bradley agreed. ``I challenge 
him and he doesn't budge an inch,'' he said. ``He thinks he's always 
right.'' Bradley was an assistant for two years at the University 
of Virginia, where Arena's teams won five U.S. college titles, then 
Bradley left to become head coach at Princeton University. When Arena 
was chosen the U.S. coach for the 1996 Olympics, he again turned to 
Bradley to be his assistant. The MLS title match won't be the first 
high-stakes meeting between them _ in 1993, when Bradley was voted 
college coach of the year, his Princeton Tigers lost the college semifinals 
to Virginia and his former and future boss. ``Bruce is very gracious 
with his comments about me,'' Bradley said, tongue-in-cheek, remembering 
1993. ``He was very big in saying I should be coach of the year. ``If 
you know Bruce and read between the lines, what he's really saying 
when he says that stuff is, `We're much better that their team and 
we're going to kick their butts. Bob's a nice guy, so he should at 
least have something to go home with.' Our friendship survived that 
day.'' D.C. United also beat Chicago in both regular-season meetings 
this year, leaving Bradley wondering how he might react if he ever 
beats an Arena-coached team. ``Somewhere along the line, I'm hoping 
to see if I can handle it when our team wins,'' he said. On a more 
serious note, Bradley said, ``D.C. United has set the standard in 
our league over the first few years. I know anytime you play against 
a team that he (Arena) is involved with, you know that the team will 
be very good.'' Arena returned the compliment, saying, ``I think he's 
done an absolutely tremendous job with Chicago.'' United, which had 
a 24-8 regular-season record and was extended to three games by Columbus 
in the playoffs, indeed has been the class of the fledgling league, 
particularly in the postseason. D.C. beat the favored Los Angeles 
Galaxy in the first MLS Cup, then defeated Colorado for the title 
a year ago. Playmaker Marco Etcheverry, the league MVP, directs a 
potent D.C. attack. He had 10 goals and a league-best 19 assists during 
the regular season. Early season addition Roy Lassiter (18 goals, 
8 assists) and Jaime Moreno (16, 11) provide striking power up front 
for a team stronger on the attack than on defense. The Fire, by contrast, 
has been led by goalkeeper Zach Thornton, who had a 1.17 goals-against 
average this year, and a smothering defense. Chris Armas is a talented 
stopper in the midfield and will attempt to keep Etcheverry from controlling 
the tempo of the game. Peter Nowak orchestrates the Chicago attack 
and had 12 assists and six regular-season goals this year for the 
Fire, who finished second in their division with a 20-12 record behind 
Los Angeles, then came back to sweep the Galaxy in the playoffs.
