He may not be picasso or rembrandt, but a curator at a south African 
zoo says one of his animals has potential. Oliver, the otter, recently 
painted three originals on canvas as part of an annual fund-raiser 
for the Pretoria zoo. Full of color, grass and fur imprints, art critics 
may not consider oliver's work masterpieces. And Oliver might agree 
with that, he dragged one of his paintings into the water. One of 
his better works will be auctioned next Saturday.
