Federal investigators have joined in the search for the killer of 
a New York doctor who performed abortions. Police say doctor Barnett 
slepian was shot through a kitchen window in his home in Amherst, 
a town near Buffalo. His killer apparently fired from behind a swimming 
pool in the backyard. The doctor had been the target of anti-abortion 
protests. Activists claimed a victory when he temporarily closed his 
office in 1992. He continued to perform abortions at a clinic in Buffalo. 
I'm not afraid of them. I'm not afraid of the violence, but I fear 
for my family, my children. I think of -- if I wasn't around what 
they would go through, but personally, I'm not afraid of them. The 
FBI and Canadian police warned Tuesday of possible sniper attacks 
against doctors who performed abortions in the Rochester area and 
in canada.
