Former teacher Mary Kay LeTourneau won't face any more rape charges 
in connection with her relationship with a former student. A Seattle 
prosecutor says the seven year prison sentence Letourneau is serving 
for child rape is punishment enough. LeTourneau gave birth last week 
to a second child fathered by the 15-year-old boy. The relationship 
started when he was 13. Prosecutors had considered filing a third-degree 
child rape charge against leTourneau after she gave birth to the second 
child. That could have meant an additional five years in prison if 
she were convicted.
