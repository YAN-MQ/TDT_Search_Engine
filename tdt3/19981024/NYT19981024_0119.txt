Tommy Tolles has learned a lot about pressure, frustration and adversity 
this year. Tolles was one of the PGA Tour's rising players, a contender 
to make the Ryder Cup team, a player who had nine top-10 finishes 
in 1997. But this year, Tolles started slowly, his problems snowballed, 
and his confidence melted. He arrived at the National Car Rental Golf 
Classic at Walt Disney World clinging to his tour card, holding the 
124th position on the money list. Only the top 125 on the money list 
after this weekend will secure automatic playing privileges for next 
year. Tolles has no interest in returning to qualifying school, but 
he said he would if he must. So far last week, during which Tolles 
turned 32, has responded with one of his best performances of the 
year. Standing at three-under par for the tournament after rounds 
of 71 and 70, Tolles entered Saturday's third round tied for 29th, 
just four strokes off the lead. And Tolles knew that if he avoided 
a weekend collapse, he stood an excellent chance of securing his tour 
card for next year. ``The last couple of years at this point, I was 
trying to get into the top 30 on the money list, which I thought was 
a lot of pressure,'' Tolles said. ``This year all of a sudden, I'm 
trying to fight for job security, and the pressure is even greater. 
At least so far this week, things have gone pretty well. But I still 
have to finish it off.'' The year has been a humbling experience for 
Tolles, but it has happened to others. Knowing that has given Tolles 
some consolation. ``I remember seeing guys who had finished really 
high on the money list one year end up in qualifying school the next,'' 
said Tolles, a former star at the University of Georgia. ``That's 
just the way it is. When you have your opportunities, you have to 
make the most of them. If you don't, you end up in situations like 
this.'' There are so many things that Tolles misses about being one 
of the better players on tour _ the respect from his peers, the notoriety. 
Now, instead of being congratulated at his locker for having a strong 
tournament, people stop by to offer encouragement, or simply keep 
walking, not knowing exactly what to say. ``Last year was so much 
fun, just having the thrill of the hunt, being competitive,'' Tolles 
said. ``I have really missed that. I've learned a lot about myself. 
That's a place where everybody needs to be, near the center of attention. 
You learn so much about yourself and life in general.'' Things started 
to go downhill for Tolles during the summer of 1997, when he was fighting 
to stay in the top 10 on the Ryder Cup points list. It was a huge 
letdown when he failed to make the United States team that went to 
Spain, and he has never played as well since finishing third at the 
1997 Masters. ``I was fighting so hard, and instead of fighting the 
course, I was fighting myself,'' Tolles said of his attempt to make 
the Ryder team. ``I had all these emotions running through my head. 
I thought it was going to be the greatest thing that ever happened 
to me, something I could tell my kids and grandkids about. When it 
didn't happen, I kind of hid under a rock for a couple of weeks. ``Finally, 
I realized it wasn't the end of the world. It wasn't the last Ryder 
Cup ever. There'll be other opportunities.'' Stewart Cink, who begins 
the third round just three strokes off the lead, will also need a 
strong finish this weekend. But he needs it to qualify for this week's 
Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta. East Lake is 
Cink's home course, and he badly wants to play this week. But the 
Tour Championship is for the top 30 on the money list, and Cink is 
currently 31st. ``I haven't been outside of the top 30 until the last 
month,'' said Cink, last year's PGA Tour rookie of the year. ``I don't 
consider the top 30 to be gravy. I think I should be there. I'm almost 
embarrassed not to get in.'' Andrew Magee, who is 30th on the money 
list, missed the cut Friday. He leads Cink by nearly $78,000.
