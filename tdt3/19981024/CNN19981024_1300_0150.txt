President Clinton is basking in the glow of the latest mideast peace 
agreement. He began his weekly radio address today by touching on 
the land-for-peace deal. Yesterday, after nine days of difficult negotiations, 
Israelis and palestinians signed a agreement that restores hope to 
peace in the Middle East. It strengthens security and opposition to 
terrorism, and brings both sides closer to the day where they can 
live together as free people. Keeping the peace process on track will 
require continued courage by israelis and Palestinian in the months 
ahead. But this agreement shows what is possible when the will for 
peace is strong and I'm proud that together we were able to make real 
progress.
