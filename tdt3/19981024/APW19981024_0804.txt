Hoping to ease concerns about the security of international monitors 
in Kosovo, the Security Council demanded Saturday that Yugoslavia 
implement an accord to end fighting in the Yugoslav province and said 
action may be needed to enforce it. After nearly eight hours of rare 
Saturday consultations and informal discussions, a divided council 
adopted a resolution 13-0 to endorse the agreement to allow unarmed 
monitors to patrol Kosovo and NATO to verify from the air that fighting 
has stopped. China and Russia abstained from the vote. China argued 
the resolution went beyond what was agreed to between Yugoslavia and 
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. Russia said details of the resolution 
_ particularly an expression of deep concern about recent closure 
of independent media in Yugoslavia _ had no place in the resolution 
endorsing the accord.
