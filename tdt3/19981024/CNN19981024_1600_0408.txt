President Clinton used part of his radio address to discuss the importance 
of saving social security and the republicans did the same. New Mexico 
congresswoman Heather Wilson said the retirement program is a Top 
priority for her party in the next session of Congress. She also praised 
the republican majority in Congress for the balanced budget and cuts 
in taxes. The new majority in Congress has kept its promise. This 
year, we have the first balanced budget in 30 years. That means you 
and your family won't have to compete with the federal government 
when you want to borrow money to buy a home or buy a car. Interest 
rates are coming down. Wilson says much more remains to be done to 
save social security and provide tax relief for families.
