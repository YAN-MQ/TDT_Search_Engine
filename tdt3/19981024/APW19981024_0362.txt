Palestinian journalists on Saturday sharply protested restrictions 
on coverage of the radical Islamic group Hamas and theatened to strike 
in response. A day earlier, Palestinian police detained a dozen journalists 
who were waiting to interview Sheik Ahmed Yassin, Hamas' spiritual 
leader, about the signing of a new Mideast peace deal. The journalists 
were told that effective immediately, they needed permission from 
the Palestinian Authority to cover any events dealing with politics 
or security, in effect restricting access to both Palestinian officials 
and opposition figures like Yassin. The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate 
said Saturday that if its members were not allowed to cover Hamas, 
they would also stop covering the activities of the Palestinian Authority 
in the Gaza Strip. The group planned to issue a formal statement of 
protest later. Among those held for more than an hour by the Palestinian 
security forces on Friday were reporter Ibrahim Barzak and photographer 
Adel Hanna, both on assignment for The Associated Press. All the detained 
journalists were forced to hand over their equipment, including mobile 
phones, tape recorders and cameras. They were also asked to appear 
at police headquarters on Saturday, but a representative of the Gaza-based 
journalists' syndicate went instead. Yassin himself denounced the 
restrictions, saying the Palestinian Authority ``will have prevented 
the media from transmitting the voice of opposition.'' In a statement 
faxed to news organizations, Yassin called that a violation of free 
speech and of what he called ``the banner of democracy'' brandished 
by Yasser Arafat's government. The head of the syndicate, Zakaria 
Talmas, sought a meeting with Ghazi Jebali, who heads the security 
apparatus in the Palestinian-run areas. However, he was told Jebali 
was busy in meetings and did not have time to see him.
