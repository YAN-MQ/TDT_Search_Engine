Three, two, one. Main engines start. Lift jaust lof the Delta rocket 
with deep space walk. Testing the space -- A successful takeoff for 
NASA's deep space one rocket about two hours ago. The unmanned spacecraft 
is designed to test new technology for space missions in the 21st 
century. Allard beutel reports. You're looking at a spacecraft NASA 
says will revolutionize the way space exploration is carried out in 
the next century. It's called deep space one. The main goal of this 
$150 million mission is to test and validate 12 new technologies considered 
too risky to try on other flights. It's important to keep in mind 
that a failure of a technology on deep space one, if we can diagnose 
what that failure is, is actually a success, because we've succeeded 
in protecting the future missions from taking risks. The most highly 
anticipated technology on deep space one is something its chief engineer 
acknowledges he first heard about on star trek -- An ion propulsion 
engine. The craft moves by electrically charging the gas xenon and 
spitting out the ionized particles. That constant thrust will add 
as much as 20 miles an hour every day to deep space one's speed. And 
it's 10 times more efficient than conventional spacecraft engines. 
Deep space one's navigation system is just as innovative. By taking 
pictures of stars and asteroids the craft is designed to know precisely 
where it's going and how to get there, all without getting instructions 
from NASA. And if it's not going to the target that we set for it, 
it will change the direction that it uses for the ion propulsion system 
or the duration of the thrusting and allow it to return to its target. 
If all goes as planned deep space one is expected to rendezvous with 
an asteroid next July and swoop down as close as three miles from 
its surface. Then it's off to take the first-ever close-up images 
of comets in the year 2001. But NASA won't have to wait that long 
to find out whether deep space one is a success. Mission controllers 
say most of its technologies will get a pass or fail grade within 
a few months. Allard beutel, "Headline News."
