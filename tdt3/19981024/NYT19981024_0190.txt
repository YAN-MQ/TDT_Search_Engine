The police said Saturday that they saw no connection between an armed 
robbery on Friday night in Central Park and other robberies at knifepoint 
that have occurred in the same general area over the last month. But 
detectives had developed evidence, they said, that some of the other 
attacks may be the work of one or two prolific assailants. ``This 
is a robbery, but it isn't connected to any of the other incidents 
that have occurred in the park recently,'' said Sgt. Nick Vreeland, 
a department spokesman. ``The similarities just aren't there.'' Deputy 
Commissioner Marilyn Mode, a Police Department spokeswoman, said that 
detectives had some evidence that pointed to a single assailant in 
two attacks on children in the park and that they had linked another 
suspect to two recent knifepoint robberies there. ``It is not conclusive 
but we do think that these incidents may be related,'' she said, noting 
that the victims in these crimes gave similar descriptions of the 
suspects and that the men followed a certain pattern when committing 
the robberies. Friday's robbery occurred shortly after 6:30 p.m., 
when a 33-year-old man was accosted as he strolled through an isolated 
part of the park known as the Ramble, near the Boathouse at 77th Street 
and East Drive. The victim, who has not been identified by the police, 
said that a black man, 5-feet-9 inches tall and weighing around 200 
pounds, jumped from some brush with a knife and took his wallet before 
fleeing. Speaking about the assault at a news conference in the park 
Saturday Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that crime there was still significantly 
lower this year compared with the assaults and robberies that occurred 
in the past. He also said that no amount of police work would rid 
the city of all crime, which is at historic lows. ``Well, if all men 
and women were angels, you wouldn't need police,'' he said. ``The 
police in this city are doing a terrific job. They're doing everything 
to catch the people involved in this to make not only the park but 
the entire city very safe,'' he said. ``But there will always be crime. 
No matter where you live in America and no matter where you go, there 
always should be some concern about safety.'' So far this year, there 
have been 70 robberies and 20 felony assaults in the park, compared 
with 81 robberies and 25 felony assaults during the same time in 1997, 
according to Police Department crime statistics. The Central Park 
Precinct has increased patrols in the area, and officers have been 
making a more concerted effort to clear the park when it is closed 
at 1 a.m. every morning since the rash of attacks, Ms. Mode said.
