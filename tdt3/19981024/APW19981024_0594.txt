Berti Vogts struck back at foes who forced his resignation six weeks 
ago as Germany's national team coach in a newspaper interview, parts 
of which were released Saturday. In the weekly Welt am Sonntag to 
be published Sunday, Vogts slammed the media and players like AC Milan 
striker Oliver Bierhoff and Schalke's Olaf Thon, who had criticized 
some of his coaching after the recent World Cup. Vogts also accused 
the German Soccer Organization (DFB) of talking to potential successors 
for his job while the world championships in France were still underway. 
Germany, playing dismally, was ousted in the quarterfinals. ``I'd 
rather have real enemies than false friends,'' he said. ``Even during 
the world championships, I asked myself if they're still completely 
behind Berti Vogts as head coach. I had a funny feeling on some decisions.'' 
Vogts, in his first interview since public and media pressure forced 
him to resign Sept. 7, said he plans to take a coaching job sometime 
during the year, probably with a foreign team. ``I'm sounding out 
several interesting offers,'' he said. Vogts also levelled with Bierhoff 
and Olaf Thon. The Schalke libero quit the national team after being 
benched at the World Cup and vowed he wouldn't return with Vogts as 
coach. ``Many players are making it very, very easy for themselves,'' 
Vogts said. ``When I hear Bierhoff was supposed to be blocked under 
me, then I ask myself where was this block during Euro 96?'' Bierhoff 
came off the bench at the 1996 European Championships in England to 
score the golden goal in the final against the Czech Republic. It 
was Vogts's only major title in his eight-year stint as national coach. 
``Thon should be more critical with himself and ask himself why he 
never showed in France what he's capable of,'' Vogts added. The 3-0 
loss to Croatia in France by the three-time world champions drew a 
storm of criticism levelled at both Vogts and his players. An exodus 
of veterans followed, but some have returned under new coach Erich 
Ribbeck. Vogts also blasted the media, saying they beseiged his private 
residence for days after news of his resignation broke. ``Twelve to 
15 cameras had their lens directed at our front door. Day and night. 
We were trapped in there like animals,'' he said. Vogts, a defender 
on Germany's legendary 1974 World Cup champions led by Franz Beckenbauer, 
said the first month after leaving his post was tough. ``I slept very 
poorly. You wake up nights and asks yourself what mistakes did you 
make,'' said Vogts.
