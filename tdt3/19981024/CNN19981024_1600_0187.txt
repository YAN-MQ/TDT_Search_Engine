Jewish settlers plan to block roads all over the West Bank tomorrow 
to protest the interim peace agreement reached yesterday between Israel 
and the Palestinians. The settlers say Israeli prime minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu caved in to palestinian demands, and they will probably 
try to bring down his government. Not surprisingly, the event dominated 
headlines. Jordan hailed the agreement while Egypt gave its cautious 
approval. However, one Syrian paper called the deal a trap for the 
Palestinians. It was signed yesterday in a White House ceremony by 
prime minister netanyahu and Palestinian authority President Yasser 
Arafat. The agreement was hammered out in nine days of talks, with 
considerable pressure from President Clinton and Jordan's king Hussein. 
It contains a plan aimed at ending violence between Israelis and palestinians, 
a plan for Israeli troop redeployment, a Palestinian promise to revoke 
clauses in their charter that are hostile to Israel and a Transfer 
of 14.2% of West Bank land to the Palestinians. Prime minister Netanyahu 
is sure to face pressure from hard-liners in his likud party. But 
members of the opposition labor party have promised to support him. 
I'm very glad that Netanyahu is being considered now by Mr. Arafat 
as his business partner. It means something about the fact that Netanyahu 
does not suggest any alternative to Rabin's way of thinking, to the 
Oslo process and actually followed our footsteps, although he agreed 
to sign the agreement yesterday.
