20th century fox's new movie is facing a problem of royal proportions. 
A newspaper reports that Thailand plans to block filming of "Anna 
and the king," starring Jodie Foster and Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-fat. 
The movie will be a remake of "the king and I." The paper says Thai 
officials feel the film would violate a law against insulting the 
royal family. The 1956 movie with yul brynner was banned in Thailand 
for the same reason.
