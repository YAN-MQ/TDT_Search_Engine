It's another sign winter is just around the corner. Daylight saving 
time ends at 2:00 A.M. tomorrow in most of the United States. You 
should turn back your clocks one hour before going to bed tonight. 
Some parts of the U.S. are exempt from the change. They include Arizona, 
Hawaii, and part of Indiana.
