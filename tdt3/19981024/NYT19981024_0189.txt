Attorneys for the three Mets minor-league players convicted last week 
for the April gang-rape of a 17-year-old woman have filed separate 
motions for the verdict to be overturned, and for a new trial, if 
necessary. Michael Kessler, a state-appointed private attorney representing 
Natividad Tavarez, was the first to file this week. ``From what I 
understand, and we talked to just everybody in the courtroom while 
the jury was deliberating, the only six people who thought the state 
proved its case were the six jurors,'' Kessler said. ``Every reporter, 
the cops, the prosecutor _ they all thought the verdict was going 
to be not guilty.'' John Bruhn, another state-appointed private attorney, 
filed on behalf of Jose Brea Tucent. Assistant Public Defender Peter 
Kenny filed for Milton Gonzalez. The three convicted players face 
8 to 12 years in prison, according to the prosecutor Steve Levin, 
at their Dec. 28 sentencing. The attacks on the Buffalo, N.Y., high 
school senior, who was in Florida for spring break, took place on 
April 14 in Port St. Lucie, Fla., where the Mets minor leaguers were 
participating in extended spring training. In the trial, Levin said 
the men targeted the woman because she was naive and scared. According 
to police authorities, the woman, whose identity is being withheld, 
reported that she was cornered in a room rented by Rosario and forced 
to have sexual intercourse with the four players before being allowed 
to leave. Two other players charged in the case, Vicente Rosario and 
Ruddi De La Cruz, are scheduled to be tried next month. All the players 
are 18 years old, except Rosario, 20, and all are from the Dominican 
Republic. Rosario, who attended George Washington High School in Washington 
Heights, N.Y., is a legal alien, while the others have visas that 
have expired. Kessler and Kenny think it is significant that the circuit 
court judge who oversaw last week's trial, C. Pfieffer Trowbridge, 
has asked that the victim's entire testimony be transcribed for him. 
This came in response to Kessler's motions. ``This suggests he is 
going to read all of her testimony, to make sure he's clear on what 
she said,'' Kessler said. Added Kenny, who has been practicing law 
since 1973: ``This is the first time I've ever heard of that being 
done. I take it as a good sign.'' Kenny said the victim acknowledged 
during the trial that she had intimate contact with another Mets minor 
leaguer who was not charged, Yorki Guzman, on her second day of visiting 
Port St. Lucie. Yet when she saw Guzman by the hotel pool on her last 
day in town, he ignored her, Kenny said, and she admitted going upstairs 
shortly thereafter with Rosario. ``I think we showed pretty clearly 
that she was consenting when she went up to the room,'' Kenny said. 
``She admitted that she at least wanted to kiss the guy she came up 
with, that he took off her clothes all voluntarily. And she couldn't 
say with specificity that she ever said no to anybody in particular 
or while anybody was present.'' Kessler said there is no question 
the state failed to prove Tavarez's guilt. ``The girl testified on 
the stand that she's not sure she ever said no to my client,'' Kessler 
said. ``She did testify that she got undressed in front of my client 
in my client's hotel room, after she had been having sex with my client's 
roommate for a week, and was about to have sex with someone else on 
the team.'' Orlando-based Tony Suarez, who represents Rosario, said 
he intended to request a change of venue for his trial, but he must 
wait for jury selection to do so. ``I may even challenge the way they 
pick juries down there,'' he said. ``I mean, how is it that there 
are no blacks or Hispanics on the jury?'' Of the six jurors in last 
week's trial, four were women; none of the jurors was black or Hispanic.
