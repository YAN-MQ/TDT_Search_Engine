Police detained 30 people during a political rally organized by a 
small left-wing party in Istanbul, the Anatolia news agency reported 
Saturday. Supporters of the Liberties and Solidarity Party, which 
has no deputies in parliament, were carrying a banner that read, ``The 
country is seeking justice,'' the report said. Police warned party 
leaders against making speeches to the crowd gathered on a street. 
The authorities charged when the leaders refused to comply, the report 
said. Some supporters smashed shop windows during the clashes, it 
added. Turkey is frequently criticized for human rights abuses including 
imprisonment for political offenses.
