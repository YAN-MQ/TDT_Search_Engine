In baseball news, davey Johnson was introduced as the new manager 
of the los Angeles Dodgers. He previously managed the Mets reds and 
Orioles, and led them all to postseason play. I've always looked on 
the dodger organization as the epitome of a great organization from 
the scouting system to the minor leagues. They always seem to breed 
championships. They always bring great young players to the big leagues. 
To be named the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers is a very emotional 
-- it's a humbling thing for me. I don't see anything but good things 
in the future.
