Showers and thunderstorms will develop across Arizona Sunday as a 
core of very fast jet stream winds associated with a potent low-pressure 
system over the southern Great Basin lifts moderately moist air. Farther 
west, building westerly winds will gust to 40 mph or more across the 
deserts of southern California, setting the stage for blowing dust 
and sand. Snow will fall at high elevations in the mountains of southeast 
Idaho, Utah, southwest Wyoming and western Colorado as the potent 
low churns eastward. Saturday morning, Hurricane Mitch strengthened 
over the western Caribbean Sea, with maximum sustained winds of 100 
mph. On Sunday, Hurricane Mitch may take a westward jog before approaching 
Jamaica. If, however, Hurricane Mitch continues to forge northward, 
the risk that the Caribbean island will be lashed with hurricane or 
tropical storm-force winds by the end of the day will rise. Clouds 
and spotty showers will affect the northern Great Lakes region Sunday 
as an upper-level low pressure system, which tracked from California 
to Montana and then the northern Plains over the past several days, 
finally arrives. Showers could reach southwestward of the low across 
parts of the upper Mississippi Valley as moist winds from the southwest 
converge near the low. A sharp cold front will forge into northern 
New England Sunday, escorted by a few widely separated showers. Farther 
south, high clouds streaming east from the low over the Great Lakes 
will dim the sun over parts of northern Pennsylvania and western New 
York. Focus: Destiny of Water Some of the tropical moisture that swirled 
around the eye of Supertyphoon Zeb over the western Pacific Ocean 
nearly two weeks ago fell as snowflakes over the northern Sierra Nevada 
Saturday. Next spring, this melting snow linked to the tropics will 
trickle down from the high Sierra into reservoirs. Some of it will 
evaporate quickly, only to eventually condense into cloud droplets 
elsewhere. Some of it will stay in reservoirs for years. The possible 
destinies of water are endless. The labyrinth of paths of water molecules 
between the tropics and poles is called the hydrologic cycle.
