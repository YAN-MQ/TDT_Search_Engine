Japan's Daiwa Bank will close most of its international operations 
and focus on its domestic business as part of a restructuring plan, 
the bank president said Saturday. Daiwa Bank President Takashi Kaiho 
told a hastily called evening news conference that it will close all 
of its six remaining overseas branches by next March, leaving only 
nine small offices. The move by Daiwa is the latest example of a retreat 
from foreign markets by Japanese financial institutions. Daiwa was 
barred from operating in the United States two years ago after it 
pleaded guilty to hiding dlrs 1.1 billion in bond trading losses. 
Kaiho told reporters that the bank has decided to give up licenses 
allowing it to engage in overseas banking and cut the number of branch 
offices to nine by early 2000. Three years ago, Daiwa had 58 overseas 
offices, including 25 banking outlets. Daiwa will now concentrate 
on strengthening its domestic retail and asset management businesses 
to cope with increased competition as Japan deregulates the financial 
industry, it said. ``In order to survive in the increased competition, 
we must improve our cost efficiency,'' the bank said in a news release. 
To cut its personnel costs, Daiwa employees will face a 10 percent 
cut in their annual salary, it said. Earlier this week, Japan's Nikko 
Securities Co. announced plans to close offices in Malaysia and Thailand. 
Sumitomo Bank Ltd. withdrew from retail banking in the United States 
in March by selling its American subsidiary, Sumitomo Bank of California.
