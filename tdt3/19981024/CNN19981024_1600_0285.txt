President Clinton today opened his weekly radio address by praising 
the new mideast peace accord. Mr. Clinton helped broker the land-for-peace 
agreement. He says, although a lot still must be done, the pact is 
a victory for both israelis and Palestinians. Yesterday, after nine 
days of difficult negotiations, Israelis and palestinians signed a 
agreement that restores hope to peace in the Middle East. It strengthens 
security and opposition to terrorism and brings both sides closer 
to the day where they can live together as free people. Keeping the 
peace process on track will require continued courage by israelis 
and Palestinians in the months ahead. But this agreement shows what 
is possible when the will for peace is strong. And I'm proud that 
together we were able to make real progress.
