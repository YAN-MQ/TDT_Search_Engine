I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"Headline News" forecast. A beautiful Saturday morning for the central 
and eastern sections of the country as well as for the central Rockies. 
As we work our way into Saturday afternoon, rain and snow move into 
the rockies and we'll see rain move into the extreme southern portions 
of Texas by Sunday morning. But the central and eastern sections of 
the country continue looking beautiful with fall-like weather. And 
temperatures feeling very fall-like -- highs in the 60s and 70s. 50s 
in the northeast and northwest. Your extended forecast shows rain 
and windy conditions out west on Sunday with thunderstorms throughout 
the extended forecast period in southern texas. On Monday, the rain 
diminishes over the Rockies. We'll still see some scattered showers. 
And then on Tuesday, scattered showers still in the southern Rockies 
and showers moving into the northwest with a warm-up throughout the 
extended period over the U.S. and remember, you can get your four-day 
forecast for more than 7200 cities at CNN.com.
