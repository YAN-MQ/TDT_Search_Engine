Deep space one is cruising through space. The satellite blasted into 
orbit today from Florida. It's beginning an 11-month mission that 
could help lead to spacecraft that are smaller and less expensive. 
It's also designed to validate 12 new technologies for scientific 
space missions for the next century. It will rendezvous in July and 
get a close-up look at a Comet in 2001.
