A Turkish oil tanker collided with a water tanker in Istanbul's narrow 
Bosporus strait, a port official said Saturday. No oil spill occurred. 
The Osman Bahri, carrying 23 tons (25 short tons) of oil, reported 
a problem in its steering mechanism and collided late Friday into 
an anchored water tanker. Activists regularly stage protests pointing 
out the dangers of heavy tanker traffic in strait, which cuts through 
this city of about 10 million people, while the Turkish government 
is lobbying to limit oil tanker traffic. Next week, oil companies 
are to decide which route will see the transfer of Caspian oil to 
Europe. They are said to prefer a route, linking the Azeri capital 
of Baku to a Georgian Black Sea port that would increase traffic in 
the straits. On Saturday, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Turkey 
would not allow the strait ``to become an (oil) pipeline.'' Turkey 
backs a route, from Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, 
that would bypass the Bosporus.
