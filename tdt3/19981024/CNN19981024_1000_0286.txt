The U.N. security council is expected to vote today on a resolution 
endorsing the Kosovo peace accord. Yesterday, Russia voted to block 
the resolution because it would allow NATO to intervene in the Yugoslav 
province if monitors come into danger. The motion is supported by 
the United States and other countries. But Russia claims it violates 
the U.N. charter. China also opposes the threat of force. NAto is 
sending its supreme commander to Yugoslavia. He will warn President 
Slobodan Milosevic to comply with an agreement to remove his troops 
from Kosovo by Tuesday. U.N. officials indicate Yugoslavia's compliance 
has been spotty at best.
