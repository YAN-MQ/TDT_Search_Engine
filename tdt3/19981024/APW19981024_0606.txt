Student dissatisfaction with new government measures widened Saturday 
when two Socialist-leaning groups joined a call another nationwide 
day of protest Nov. 5 after the Toussaint vacation. Nearly 300,000 
students protested this week and 500,000 the week before, demanding 
the government of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin do more to 
revamp aging and overcrowded classrooms. The Independent and Democratic 
Student Federation (FIDL) and the National Student Union (UNL), two 
groups considered close to the Socialists, called the latest measures 
``very insufficient.'' Education Minister Claude Allegre had announced 
he will hire thousands more personnel, cut class sizes to 35 by next 
fall, boost security and make 4 billion francs (dlrs 730 million) 
in no-interest loans for regions to rebuild their schools. The measures 
were not enough for the student groups, who demanded another meeting 
with Allegre and vowed to join the Nov. 5 protest call made Thursday 
by the Interacademic High School Coordination (CIL). ``Allegre doesn't 
give any figures on how many teachers, nurses or technical personnel'' 
he will hire, said Lea Filoche, a student from Seine-Saint-Denis, 
a working-class suburb north of Paris. Lucas Vaillant, from the Marseille 
area, said students were ``malcontent with what was given to us. We 
are ready to continue (the protest) when we return from vacation if 
thing stay the same.'' School officials face tough spending choices 
with the government trying to keep the deficit within 3 percent of 
the gross domestic product, as required by the euro single currency 
that takes effect at the end of the year.
