"lately" three teenagers are making waves in the music industry. mark 
scheerer takes a look at the trio. meet tonia, kia and nikki. alone, 
talented singers. together, they are divine, the teen trio whose debut 
album, "fairy tales," is making waves. we were all individually doing 
our own things, working with different producers and things, and through 
word of mouth, the producers that we were working with told us about 
our managers having auditions for a girl group named divine. they 
just basically needed three girls to fill the slots. the three filled 
more slots when their single "lately" hit the billboard charts. just 
sitting watching the days go by watching the days go by "lately" sets 
the tone for the album, which is our present single. it is about a 
couple, when they were young. the guy is moving away, and she is remembering 
everything. how about remembering the first time they saw their music 
video? when i first saw the video, i was talking on the phone, and 
i heard, "hmm." and i said, "wait a minute." 'cause i saw the video 
before it aired on tv. but it is different, you see it on television, 
because you know millions of people are watching it everywhere. and 
that is such a good feeling i cried. i aim to say you what we had 
is through catching an impromptu performance isn't hard. we got this 
one in our studio. sometimes the stage is simply the city streets. 
i mean, we walk through subways singing, and people are looking at 
us like we are crazy, but we are having fun. and fun is exactly what 
these ladies want to continue having. we all come from totally different 
backgrounds, three different areas, but surprisingly, when we got 
together, we just clicked. i know a lot of people say girl groups 
break up, they have their catfights and all that stuff. we are like 
sisters. alike, but different. we are like baskin and robbins, except 
we have 12 flavors. yes, something for everyone. we are funky and 
wild, sexy, simple, sweet -- you know, all the elements of divine. 
thinkin' about you baby mark scheerer, "cnn entertainment news," new 
york.
