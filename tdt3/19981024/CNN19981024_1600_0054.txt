"Headline News," I'm Kate snow. President Clinton is joining the voices 
that are expressing outrage over the murder of a suburban Buffalo 
doctor who performed abortions. Dr. Barnett slepian was killed after 
someone fired a rifle shot through his kitchen window last night. 
In a statement issued by the White House today, the president said 
-- "this nation cannot tolerate violence directed at those providing 
a Constitutionally protected medical service." Anti-abortion forces 
also are condemning the killing, calling it nothing but sheer evil. 
Denise Dillon has more. Dr. Barnett slepian once said he's responsible 
for his female patients' total medical needs, including an abortion, 
if that is her choice. Because of his views and his practices, the 
physician from western New York had been the target of anti-abortion 
protesters over the years. I mean, certainly I have regrets because 
I went through a lot of -- quite a Difficult time at that point. Adversity 
has never bothered me. And the more that they come after me, the more 
I'll dig in. Friday night, Dr. slepian lost that battle. Police say 
he was shot by a sniper with a high-powered rifle hiding outside his 
home. It appears that he was shot by a rifle. And he was in the rear 
of the house, in the kitchen area with his family. And as he was either 
sitting or gettin up, he was shot. Early this week, the FBI and Canadian 
authorities warned of possible attacks against doctors who perform 
abortions in the area. They were concerned because in the past four 
years there have been four attacks on doctors who perform abortions 
within a few weeks of November 11th. In each of the attacks, a doctor 
was injured by a shot from a high-powered rifle through the window 
of their homes, just like this attack on Dr. slepian. But this time, 
the shot was fatal. In interviews, Dr. slepian repeatedly said he 
would rather a woman continue her pregnancy, but the final decision 
is up to her. Denise Dillon, "Headline News."
