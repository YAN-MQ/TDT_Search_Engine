Kings, queens and heads of state from across Europe celebrated on 
Saturday the 350th anniversary of the Treaty of Westphalia, which 
ended the Thirty Years War and marked the beginning of modern Europe. 
Royalty including Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and King Juan Carlos 
of Spain walked up a red carpet to the Muenster city hall, where the 
treaty was settled on Oct. 24, 1648. One by one, representatives from 
20 European nations signed a guest book before eating lunch and hearing 
speeches. Outside, the ``common folk'' paraded in the streets in celebration. 
Horse-drawn carriages rolled over cobblestone streets. Children dressed 
as gnomes pulled a wagon carrying a garden gnome _ the kind that decorate 
many German gardens. One parade group dressed as cows in black-and-white 
spotted suits with pink rubber gloves as udders. The Treaty of Westphalia 
ended an era of religious war between Roman Catholics and Protestants, 
fought mostly in Germany. It also recognized for the first time the 
sovereignty of the German states, the Netherlands and the Swiss confederation. 
Hailing the treaty as a milestone of modern diplomacy, German President 
Roman Herzog called it ``the start of a new European epoch'' and ``the 
first example of cooperation including nearly all European states.'' 
But even now, he said, the celebrations were dampened by the war in 
Kosovo, the Yugoslav province where Serb forces have been fighting 
a secessionist ethnic Albanian majority. ``Practically in front of 
our door, in former Yugoslavia, brutality is happening that recalls 
the atrocities of the Thirty Years War,'' Herzog said. ``We must not 
accept death and expulsions in Kosovo as something normal for Europe.'' 
He urged Europeans to work toward a common understanding of history, 
culture and foreign policy. Also attending the ceremony were representatives 
from Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, 
France, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, 
Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the Vatican.
