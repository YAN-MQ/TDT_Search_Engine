Security Council members were convening Saturday to negotiate a draft 
resolution that endorses the Kosovo accord and allows NATO to take 
action to protect unarmed monitors who will ensure Yugoslavia and 
ethnic Albanians are complying with it. Permanent council members 
Russia and China are opposed to any language threatening Serbs and 
ethnic Albanians with force if they don't comply with the Oct. 12 
agreement, which averted NATO strikes on Serb targets. They could 
veto the resolution or abstain from it. In Saturday's consultations, 
China would suggest amendments that would remove the threat of force, 
said Chen Ranfeng, a secretary in the Chinese mission. The Yugoslav 
government has already pledged to ensure the safety of the unarmed 
verification team, he noted before consultations began. ``It's a legitimate 
government. We have to believe,'' he said, adding that the safety 
of the international personnel could be ensured ``by peaceful means.'' 
Despite the stated opposition from Russia and China, a U.S. official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said council members were close 
to fine-tuning the text. Ambassadors were waiting for Russian ambassador 
Sergey Lavrov to get final direction from Moscow. A vote could come 
later Saturday. The Security Council is under pressure to adopt a 
resolution enshrining the accord and protecting the verification team. 
Potential troop-contributing nations are concerned about safety of 
their forces and want the council to endorse the plan first, with 
provisions for enforcement. Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic 
Albanians _ who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed 
hundreds of people and forced around 300,000 from their homes since 
a Serb crackdown began in February. Under the deal brokered by U.S. 
envoy Richard Holbrooke, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed 
to a cease-fire, to withdraw his special police forces from the province 
and to allow a 2,000-strong team to verify the agreement. The latest 
draft resolution allows NATO to take ``appropriate steps'' to ensure 
the agreement is enforced. It notes that in the event of an emergency, 
``action may be needed'' to ensure the safety of unarmed monitors. 
It also demands that both sides in the Kosovo dispute cooperate with 
verifiers and start talks on a political solution. Russia has religious 
and cultural ties to Serbia, the dominate republic in Yugoslavia. 
Russian lawmakers warned NATO Friday that airstrikes on Yugoslavia 
would prompt Moscow to offer weapons to Serbs. China is traditionally 
opposed to any military intervention into what it considers an internal 
matter, fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with 
Taiwan and Tibet. Russia has said that it would not go along with 
any resolution that was tougher than a Sept. 23 resolution that helped 
form the basis of the Holbrooke deal. That resolution said the council 
would consider unspecified measures if both sides didn't comply but 
didn't give any explicit threats of force. The draft welcomes Yugoslavia's 
commitment to protect the OSCE monitors and decides that an arms embargo 
imposed in a March resolution won't apply for weapons and equipment 
destined for the OSCE or NATO or their member states.
