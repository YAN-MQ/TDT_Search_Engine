At one point during Saturday's round, when the humidity was rising, 
Davis Love III turned to someone in the gallery and said, ``It's getting 
pretty warm out here.'' Love, however, was cool under pressure, shooting 
a seven-under-par 65. He took sole possession of the lead with an 
eagle on the fourth hole, and his three-round total of 14-under 202 
gave him a three-stroke lead heading into Sunday's final round of 
the National Car Rental Golf Classic. Glen Day and Doug Martin, who 
both shot 68 Saturday, were tied for second place at 11 under par, 
while several prominent names lurked in contention, including Tiger 
Woods and Jesper Parnevik at nine under and David Duval at eight under. 
But Love was clearly the man to beat at Walt Disney World, playing 
another superb round Saturday after shooting a 64 on Friday. Starting 
the day in a six-way tie for first place, Love emerged from the pack 
in familiar fashion, taking advantage of the Magnolia Course's par-5 
holes with booming drives, and hitting accurate approach shots that 
led to numerous birdie opportunities. It was a solid performance from 
tee to green by a proven winner who was playing with confidence. Love 
did not guarantee victory on Sunday, but he liked his position. ``I've 
been in this situation a bunch,'' said Love, the 1997 PGA champion 
who won most recently in April at the MCI Classic. ``You're going 
to be nervous, but I know what it's going to take. Guys are going 
to try and knock me off. But I know they'll be thinking, `Well, if 
he gets a little bit ahead, I'm not going to be able to catch him.''' 
Nobody caught Love Saturday once he took sole possession of the lead. 
After making his first birdie at No. 3 with a five-foot putt, Love 
eagled the par-5, 552-yard No. 4, reaching the green in two shots 
with a drive and a 1-iron, then making a 40-foot putt. That gave him 
a two-stroke lead at 10 under par, and he remained in command. He 
stretched his lead with a birdie at the par-3 No. 6, hitting a brilliant 
5-iron tee shot that landed two feet from the cup for an easy tap-in. 
Then on the back nine, Love birdied the par-5 10th hole, hitting his 
second shot just short of the green and chipping to within two feet. 
He followed that by making a 20-foot birdie putt at No. 12, and Love 
ended the day on a high by making a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 18. 
Love, Day and Martin will play in Sunday's final threesome, and the 
players chasing Love hoped that he would falter early. But they weren't 
counting on it. ``If the wind is calm, Davis can make some birdies, 
and if he does that, he'll be hard to catch,'' Woods said. Woods, 
who shot a 68 Saturday, could have scored even better but barely missed 
several putts. ``I had six lip-outs,'' he said. ``That's a lot of 
lip-outs for birdies. It's just one of those days where the putts 
just didn't quite go in.'' Love felt the same way Thursday after he 
opened the tournament with a 73. But he has been superb since. And 
he hoped that he was just 18 holes from victory. ``I could have just 
thrown in the towel for the year and had a heck of a lot of fun,'' 
said Love, who is 10th on this year's PGA Tour money list. ``All I 
can do is win more money or win another tournament. It's not going 
to get me player of the year. It's not going to get me the money title. 
But I've got a lot of pride. If I can look back on this year and say 
I finished second or third on the money list, finished strong, and 
didn't throw in the towel, that will mean something to me.''
