Political prisoners, holding prison officials hostage in five prisons 
throughout Turkey in a bid to improve jail conditions, put an end 
to their nationwide protest, Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said 
Saturday. Prisoners had held some 50 officials hostage Friday in what 
appeared to be a concerted protest. Human rights activists who took 
part in negotiating the release of prison officers confirmed that 
all had been released. Five security officers were injured during 
the hostage- takings, reports said. None was reported in life-threatening 
conditions. The most important action came in Istanbul's Umraniye 
prison. Throughout the night, lawyers, human rights activists and 
paramilitary police negotiated with the hostage takers, Anatolia said. 
Lawyers told Anatolia that the prisoners demanded a general improvement 
of jail conditions, an end to prison transfers, and that convicts 
held in isolated cells be allowed to return to their wards. Prisoners 
also demanded an end to attacks by prison officials on inmates, and 
that all prisoners allegedly injured in recent prison riots be given 
medical treatment, Ibis Varol of the Human Rights Association said. 
The justice ministry accepted all the demands, Varol said. But a justice 
ministry official differed with Varol's assessment. Catay Kayiran, 
the general director of penitentiaries, contended that officials do 
not attack inmates, that prisoners were always given medical treatment 
and that isolated cells were only used in disciplinary cases. Kayiran 
said that soldiers, currently dealing with the hostage taking, would 
leave the prisons. Turkey's prisons, 9th graf pvs
