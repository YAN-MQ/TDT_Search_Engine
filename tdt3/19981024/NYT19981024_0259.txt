Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato and Rep. Charles E. Schumer met Saturday night 
in their first debate, a tense and uneasy stand-off in which D'Amato 
hammered Schumer for his attendance record in Congress, while Schumer 
portrayed D'Amato as an untrustworthy legislator who had embarrassed 
New York and repeatedly voted with Republicans against the state's 
interests. For 59 minutes, standing behind lecterns in a television 
studio in Schenectady, N.Y., the Republican senator and his Democratic 
challenger used the first of what will be only two debates to present 
to a statewide audience the cases that have, until now, been made 
in the form of 30-second commercials. ``Chuck Schumer sadly has put 
his political ambitions over the people's needs,'' D'Amato said grimly, 
peering over the top of his glasses. ``There's one fundamental fact 
in this election, and that is that he's missed more votes in 12 months 
than I've missed in 12 years.'' Schumer said the election came down 
to one word: ``The word that will make the difference is trust. New 
Yorkers want to know who to believe.'' The debate came just over a 
week before the conclusion of what has become one of the most closely 
watched contests in the nation, and most public polls show it to be 
a dead heat. D'Amato agreed to only two debates; the second will be 
broadcast live at 1 p.m. on Sunday on WNBC, Channel 4. With the race 
so close _ and Schumer, a Brooklyn congressman, still not well known 
in many parts of the state _ the meeting between the two men was tensely 
anticipated by aides to both candidates. And from the start, neither 
candidate left any doubt about what he hoped to accomplish. D'Amato 
turned to Schumer's attendance record within 20 seconds of starting 
his opening statement. And he stuck to that one topic ferociously, 
turning almost every question _ from his opinion on whether President 
Clinton should be impeached to government support for breast cancer 
research _ into another attack on the votes Schumer has missed this 
year. Again and again, he listed the number of committee and floor 
votes Schumer missed while campaigning, asserting that Schumer had 
put his political advancement ahead of his Congressional obligations. 
D'Amato _ who referred to Schumer as ``Chuck,'' while the congressman 
called him ``Senator D'Amato'' _ tried to goad Schumer into discussing 
the one issue that the senator's advisers have concluded could help 
him survive one of the most difficult challenges of his life in public 
office. ``Did you miss 110 votes in Congress?'' D'Amato demanded. 
``Yes or no? Have I misstated the record? I'd like to know.'' But 
D'Amato's efforts to engage Schumer on the subject for the most part 
failed. Schumer did not dispute D'Amato's argument that he missed 
many votes this year while campaigning, but said that his lifetime 
voting record was 92 percent. And he rebutted D'Amato by reading from 
endorsements from Newsday _ ``Your own hometown newspaper,'' Schumer 
noted with more than a little glee, glancing up from the clipping 
_ and The Buffalo News that described D'Amato's attacks on Schumer's 
voting record as unrevealing of Schumer's record of accomplishment 
in Congress. Schumer largely stuck to the themes that his advisers 
believe could turn the election: That D'Amato was a senator who did 
not keep his word and who was more conservative than the electorate 
of the state. Schumer criticized D'Amato for supporting the Contract 
with America, which called for deep cuts in federal aid that would 
have to New York social programs, and for opposing abortion rights. 
And Schumer took note of an incident that occurred last week that 
caused D'Amato some embarrassment and that was the subject of the 
first question of the night: D'Amato's use of a Yiddish slur to belittle 
Schumer and his description of Rep. Jerrold L. Nadler, a Manhattan 
Democrat who is overweight, as ``Jerry Waddler.'' D'Amato first denied 
having used the slur, but later acknowledged he had, after friends 
of his who had been in the room confirmed the account. ``This is one 
of a series of embarrassing incidents that we have had from the senator 
through his 18 years and of not owning up to the truth,'' Schumer 
said. The two men shook hands as they entered the WRGB studios, but 
not at the end. And their demeanors were markedly different throughout. 
D'Amato, who can be humorous and charming, was scolding and unsmiling 
Saturday night as he attacked Schumer unceasingly and at a rapid-fire 
pace. Schumer, who is making his first run for statewide office, was 
awkward at first, but by the end became relaxed and expansive, smiling 
frequently.
