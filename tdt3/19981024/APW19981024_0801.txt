Polish midfielder and league MVP candidate Peter Nowak led a four-man 
contingent from the expansion Chicago Fire that was named Saturday 
to Major League Soccer's ``Best 11''. Nowak was joined by a somewhat 
surprising choice of fellow midfielder Chris Armas, Goalkeeper of 
the Year award winner Zach Thornton and Defender of the Year winner 
Lubos Kubik of the Czech Republic. The honorary team contained members 
from only four of MLS' 12 clubs, the four playoff semifinalists. Forward 
Cobi Jones, midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos of El Salvador and defender 
Robin Fraser were selected from the Los Angeles Galaxy. Most Valuable 
Player Award winner Marco Etcheverry of Bolivia was named to the midfield 
and was joined by defender Eddie Pope from two-time defending champion 
D.C. United. League scoring leader Stern John was joined by U.S. national 
team captain Thomas Dooley from the Columbus Crew. Nowak finished 
just behind in the MVP voting to Etcheverry, who was the only player 
to be named to the squad all three years of MLS' existence. It was 
a second-time selection for Pope, Dooley, Fraser and Cienfuegos. Seven 
of the players, selected by MLS coaches and general managers, will 
be featured on Sunday when the Fire faces D.C. United in MLS Cup '98 
for the league title in the Rose Bowl.
