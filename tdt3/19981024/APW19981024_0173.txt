European Union leaders welcome two new kids on the block Saturday 
_ German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister 
Massimo D'Alema _ at a summit devoted to brainstorming about where 
the EU is going. The debuts of Schroeder, a social democrat who takes 
office next week, and D'Alema, an ex-communist sworn in this week, 
gives the line-up of the West European leaders a stronger leftist 
tint. Eleven of the 15 EU governments are headed by left-wing or center-left 
leaders, two others are coalitions with socialists and only in Ireland 
and Spain are conservatives in power. In a last-minute change to the 
agenda, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was to brief the Europeans 
on a West Bank land-for-peace accord during a stopover here on his 
way back from talks in the United States. Arafat arrived in Vienna 
to meet with EU Middle East envoy, Miguel Martinos, and Austrian Foreign 
Minister Wolfgang Schuessel. He was to fly to this alpine resort in 
southern Austria to meet with the EU leaders at around 1300GMT.
