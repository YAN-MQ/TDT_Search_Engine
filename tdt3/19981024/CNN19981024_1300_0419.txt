This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather 
forecast" for today and into tomorrow. There will be rain and mountain 
snow across the western U.S., a little cool and blustery with several 
inches of snow in the forecast for the northern mountains of California. 
A few thundershowers will occur over south Texas. We'll see some showers 
as well through a trough of low pressure from the plains states, into 
the upper midwest. Otherwise, rather quiet weather around the country. 
Today's highs in the 50s and 60s for the northern half of the nation. 
We'll see 70s in the south and just a few 80s. Looking ahead to Monday, 
rain and thunderstorms will push into the southwest. We'll see warmer 
weather across the southeastern part of the country. For Tuesday, 
no change in our showers and storms through the southwest. Things 
are still pretty warm across the gulf coast. Wednesday, rain moves 
across the northern half of the country. We'll see 50s and 60s north, 
70s and 80s south.
