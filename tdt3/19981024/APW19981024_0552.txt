A Belgrade court imposed heavy fines on the editors and publishers 
of an independent newspaper, ruling criticism of Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic in their weekly constituted anti-state activity. 
Under a harsh media law passed by Serbia's parliament last week, a 
Belgrade district court judge ruled the four were guilty of ``trying 
to undermine the constitutional order'' of Yugoslavia by criticizing 
Milosevic and his rule. The editors, Slavko Curuvija and Dragan Bujosevic, 
and publisher Ivan Tadic, along with the publishing house of the independent 
weekly, Evropljanin, are to pay a total of 2.4 million dinars (dlrs 
260,000) within 24 hours, Curuvija told the Associated Press Saturday. 
``The court made the draconic decision in a staged, Stalinist process,'' 
Curuvija said. He vowed to fight back. The new, harsh media law was 
passed last Thursday, amid growing anti-Western sentiments about possible 
NATO intervention in Serbia's Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanian 
rebels are fighting for independence. It bans broadcasts of Serbo-Croatian 
language programs by foreign media, further restricts working permits 
for news organizations and empowers authorities to determine which 
reports break the law and are against the constitution. Independent 
legal experts and journalists say the law reimposes censorship, which 
Serbia formally abandoned in the late 1980s, and drags the country 
back toward single-party dictatorship. The trial against Evropljanin 
was initiated by Patriotic Union, believed to be run by supporters 
of Milosevic's neo-communist wife Mirjana Markovic. The Union said 
pictures of an ethnic Albanian soldier that appeared in the weekly 
showed him in a ``hero position.'' The heated proceedings on Friday 
started with about 100 independent journalists following the three 
to the downtown court building in a show of support. At a news conference 
Saturday, lawyers representing the accused appealed to major opposition 
leaders and urged them to take action because ``they also have the 
responsibility for freedom of press.'' Representatives of the main 
opposition parties attended the press conference, in an outward display 
of support. ``The astronomic fines ... open a clash between the regime 
and common sense, which will soon result in huge changes we have all 
been waiting for,'' said Slobodan Vuksanovic, vice-president the leading 
opposition party, the Democrats.
