A newly elected government and a new capital have promoted much talk 
of ``a new Germany,'' and here, in a very old German town, may be 
found the newest face of all. It is that of Carsten Schneider: bright-eyed, 
frank beneath exuberant spikes of blond hair, seemingly unburdened 
by its imminent passage into the history books. At 22, Schneider, 
a Social Democrat like Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, is about 
to become the youngest politician ever to sit in the German Parliament. 
At first glance, this young man seems to incarnate the more forward-looking 
Germany that Schroeder says he will seek after being sworn in on Tuesday. 
But the difficulties that crowd in on Schneider bear the weight of 
the past, particularly the disappointed hopes of German unification 
and the distress of a strained economic model. Unemployment in Erfurt, 
once home to Martin Luther and now home to the wrecked remnants of 
a textile factory of the former East German state, has reached 17 
percent. Resentment toward what is still called ``the West'' runs 
high. Beyond money and jobs, many people talk of a kind of moral void, 
a bleak ``elbow society'' where elbows thrust as advancement is restlessly 
sought but values of community have been lost. ``When I get to the 
Bundestag, one of my aims will be strengthen the confidence of Germans 
from the East,'' said Schneider, who will attend the inaugural session 
of the newly elected Parliament in Bonn on Monday. ``I want to get 
East German deputies to form a bloc of their own, so we are no longer 
overrun. For real unification to happen, the two sides must be at 
the same eye level.'' In a sense, Schneider's concerns are extraordinary. 
He was just 13 when the Berlin wall fell in 1989; he would appear 
to belong to a generation more touched by German unity than German 
division. But it is a measure of the task facing the 54-year-old Schroeder, 
who will head an untried coalition of Social Democrats and Greens, 
that Germany has not yet defined itself in a way that reaches across 
its former chasms. ``This is simply not a finished country,'' one 
Western diplomat said. Erfurt's problems, common to many towns in 
the former East, reflect the way Germany has been caught in a vicious 
circle that has perpetuated, and often accentuated, divisions. The 
colossal transfers of funds from a prosperous West to a formerly dilapidated 
East _ more than $625 billion since 1990 _ have been financed in part 
by increased social security charges that now represent about 42.3 
percent of wages compared with 35.5 percent in 1991. These increased 
wage costs have in turn made businessmen reluctant to hire and have 
led to the elimination of more than 2.5 million jobs since 1991. Higher 
unemployment _ about 4 million people are out of work _ has in turn 
put new pressure on a social security system that was generously extended 
to the 15.5 million people of the former East. In this way, under 
the strain of the exorbitant cost of unification and faced by a more 
competitive global economy, the social-market economic model that 
propelled Germany to post-World War II prosperity has begun to buckle 
without anyone's being able to agree on how to modernize it. In the 
place of cohesion has come recrimination and resentment. Since winning 
the election on Sept. 27, Schroeder has been grappling with this central 
problem, one made more acute by Germany's rapidly aging population 
and the consequent pressure on pensions. Schneider, who was working 
as a trainee in a bank before he decided to go into politics, said 
he was a little disappointed with the result. ``I like Tony Blair, 
I like New Labor,'' Schneider said. ``The problem here is that our 
Social Democratic party is still very traditionalist. We have not 
yet shown enough courage for a really new beginning. We need more 
private pension schemes, more venture capital for new technologies 
in the East, a more customer-friendly civil service, and banks more 
ready to back risk-takers.'' Certainly, Schroeder's program smacks 
of difficult compromise. Only in the area of immigration law _ where 
a change allowing many of Germany's 7 million foreigners to gain citizenship 
has been written into the coalition's program _ does a shift look 
really decisive. Another bold measure _ the elimination of nuclear 
power _ has been left for the fairly distant, nebulous future. In 
the central area of economic reform, steps look timid. Unlike Blair, 
Schroeder has had no Margaret Thatcher to precede him; the entire 
onus of any change thus lies on him. Although clearly tempted by aspects 
of the American model _ Schroeder often talks of his fascination with 
New York _ it is still unclear how, if at all, he will adapt the German 
system. Already, there have been casualties. Schroeder's first choice 
for economics minister, the bustling self-made computer-industry millionaire 
Jost Stollman, often portrayed here as about the nearest thing Germany 
has to a Bill Gates, stormed out last week, complaining that his powers 
were being usurped by the finance ministry and that ``the loss of 
jobs is being programmed in.'' His anger was evidently leveled principally 
at Oskar Lafontaine, the powerful Social Democratic party chairman 
and finance minister in the new government. Stollman's sweeping talk 
of deregulation had tried the patience of Lafontaine, who runs the 
party machine and knows that speeches about the need to curb ``the 
global casino of world financial markets'' _ a constant Lafontaine 
theme of late _ play better than pension reform on the factory floor. 
``Mr. Stollman's departure is a bad sign for me,'' Schneider said. 
``We'll have to see if the forces of reform can still prevail.'' For 
now, the government's program of tax reform _ including a so-called 
ecology tax on energy designed to permit a slight reduction in social 
security charges to encourage hiring _ appears too modest to have 
any immediate effect on unemployment. Germany's six leading economic 
research institutes have all dismissed it as inadequate. Here in Erfurt, 
a city of 205,000 people, Kurt Keiner, the director of the Thuringia 
state labor office, said that he thought it impossible that unemployment 
would come down over the next year. Indeed, without state-supported 
``make work'' programs, he said, unemployment would be as high as 
25 percent _ ``an intolerable level.'' ``At this point, it could even 
take another generation to solve these problems,'' Keiner said. ``The 
walls in heads and hearts have been growing in both parts of Germany, 
and we have divided more than we have come together. This makes any 
coherent attack on unemployment difficult.'' Downstairs from his office, 
two young men who had come to collect unemployment benefits got into 
a brawl, punching and head-butting each other as onlookers called 
for the police. Meanwhile, a 47-year-old man, Roland Berard, perused 
job offerings on a computer, but having been out of work for 18 months, 
he said he held out little hope. ``I am too old for the job market,'' 
he said. Schneider may seem too young for the political market. But 
he has already made plans to join the parliamentary budget committee 
and has evidently thought deeply about his new responsibilities. ``Even 
if we cannot quickly solve economic problems, I think we can write 
a new chapter in Germany history,'' he said. ``Bonn was always a transitional 
phase. With the move to Berlin, I think we have a unique opportunity 
to help unite East and West by really talking openly of our communist 
and fascist demons. My dream is a tolerant and truly united Germany.'' 
As if surprised by his weighty words, Schneider added, ``And besides, 
the night life in Berlin is a lot better than in Bonn.'' It was a 
flippant remark. But it may indeed be that Schroeder, as chancellor, 
will need to resort to style as much as substance _ the new, racy 
Berlin Republic over the old Rhineland conservatism of sleepy Bonn 
_ in attempting to galvanize and bring together the Germany that he 
seems destined to guide into the next century.
