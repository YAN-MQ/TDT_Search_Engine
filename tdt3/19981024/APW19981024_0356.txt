Nobel Peace Prize winner David Trimble, under pressure from hard-line 
Protestants opposed to Northern Ireland's peace agreement, assured 
his Ulster Unionist Party Saturday he won't share power with Sinn 
Fein until the IRA starts disarming. Trimble emphasized that April's 
multi-party agreement required Sinn Fein and its Irish Republican 
Army allies to support ``only democratic, nonviolent means'' or be 
``excluded or removed from office.'' Referring to the IRA's favorite 
plastic explosive, he told the Ulster Unionists' annual conference: 
``There is only one thing you can do with Semtex. There is only one 
reason for holding onto it. And that's to destroy people or places. 
''Retention of guns and explosives is a clear threat of force.'' Trimble 
drew standing ovations at the start and finish of his speech from 
all but a handful of the 500 Ulster Unionist activists packed into 
a hotel ballroom outside Londonderry, the British-ruled province's 
second-largest city. John Hume, who leads Northern Ireland's major 
Catholic party and shared Nobel honors last week with Trimble, agrees 
with Sinn Fein that all major parties should be entitled now to seats 
in a new multi-party government, the intended centerpiece of April's 
agreement. But more than a dozen Ulster Unionist speakers _ strikingly, 
from both the pragmatic and stubborn wings of Northern Ireland's largest 
party _ emphasized how little room for maneuver Trimble has on the 
matter. They voiced near-unanimous opposition to forming a government 
that includes Sinn Fein figures without IRA disarmament, which the 
agreement states should happen by mid-2000. ``We have done our bit. 
We're doing no more,'' declared Reg Empey, one of most strongly pro-agreement 
voices in the party. If British Prime Minister Tony Blair and others 
try to pressure Trimble into moving forward without IRA disarmament, 
Empey said, ``they'll be wasting their time.'' William Ross _ who 
like most of his nine Ulster Unionist colleagues in Britain's Parliament 
has defied Trimble by opposing the agreement _ drew some applause 
when he chided party ``liberals'' for having ``trampled over common 
sense'' by even negotiating when the IRA refused to disarm. ``Ladies 
and gentlemen, we're one-quarter into this agreement _ and still not 
one gun, not one bomb!'' said David Brewster, a former Trimble ally 
who defected to Ross' camp on the eve of the agreement. Rejecting 
the idea that Sinn Fein's 17 percent share of Northern Ireland votes 
made the party ``normal,'' Brewster retorted to cheers: ``Well you 
are not. You are the tapeworm in the body politic, and you must be 
flushed out!'' David Burnside, a public-relations consultant, warned 
that the Ulster Unionists cannot rest on the Nobel honor accorded 
to Trimble. The party, he argued, must fight a more effective propaganda 
war internationally. Sinn Fein, he argued, ``would love to be seen'' 
to be barred from any new government. ``The republicans want us to 
make a mistake. Don't play their game.''
