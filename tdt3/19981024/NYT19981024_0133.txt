When a little-known agent named Stephen Woods complained recently 
that the National Basketball Players Association was derelict in its 
duties, the fears began to surface. Woods called union officers overmatched 
in their bargaining talks with the league's owners and said he did 
not want to be on the bus that union president Patrick Ewing and vice 
president Alonzo Mourning were driving off a cliff. More fears arose 
last Monday when the players association lost a decision in which 
an arbitrator ruled that owners could continue withholding pay from 
players during the management lockout. A half-dozen agents on the 
union's advisory council talked openly about decertifying immediately 
and fighting the NBA in court rather than negotiating a new labor 
agreement. Some players were not sounding like pillars of unity either. 
``We're not panicking but everyone has their own agenda,'' the veteran 
guard Muggsy Bogues said Tuesday. ``I'm losing part of the biggest 
payday of my career.'' But by last Thursday afternoon, the voices 
of discord were gone. Woods was escorted out of a meeting of 240 players 
in Las Vegas by two security guards, the proponents of decertification 
called the process a last resort and Bogues became yet another convert, 
proclaiming, ``We have to stick together.'' How did a group of athletes 
with widely disparate incomes and interests hang together after having 
lost nearly $100 million in salaries since the lockout began July 
1? ``We found a common enemy,'' said Buck Williams, the former players 
association president. ``Once guys saw the proposals the league was 
offering, had them broken down into simple terms, nobody was worried 
about their own situation anymore.'' The NBA can blame union executive 
director Billy Hunter, who has made a point to include his constituency 
in the negotiations and give the floor to anyone who wants it. On 
Thursday, after Woods withdrew the complaint he had filed with the 
National Labor Relations Board, he said: ``Billy and I got together 
and talked. He explained his position. I still have concerns, but 
the masses have spoken and they seem to mean business. What else can 
you do but get on board?'' Indeed, the players meeting had a profound 
effect of solidarity on many concerned players who came to hear the 
union's message. Besides informational material on the proposals, 
they heard from Gene Upshaw and Donald Fehr, the union chiefs for 
the National Football League and Major League Baseball, respectively. 
Karl Malone, who has taken verbal shots at the union in the past went 
from a dove to a hawk overnight. ``I just started realizing what this 
was all about and why we need to stay strong,'' he said. The fight 
they are waging may not resonate with a public tired of paying exorbitant 
ticket prices. The players essentially want to retain their right 
to earn as much as possible while the owners are determined to bring 
soaring salaries in line with revenue. But Hunter and Ewing have managed 
to convince the masses that NBA commissioner David Stern is intent 
on forcing major compromises, an image that seems to have permeated 
the lockout. ``The league has done what they considered impossible: 
they've brought all the players together,'' said the agent Mark Bartlestein. 
``The major mistake the league has made is that it has tried so hard 
to jam this down the players' throat, this idea of a hard salary cap 
without any exceptions. ``For these guys, that's like being down 45 
points and you feel like someone is trying to embarrass you or disrespect 
you. These are people who usually didn't back down from bullies when 
they were growing up.'' For a union known for its disorganization 
and the controversial exits of its former executive directors, Hunter's 
orchestration has been nothing short of masterful. He has tried to 
go toe-to-toe with the league's propaganda machine, spewing out his 
own spin as fast and voluminous as he can. ``He has reached out to 
players across the spectrum, but he hasn't tried to stifle ideas,'' 
said the agent Bill Strickland, the runner-up to Hunter for the job. 
``Before, if someone had something different to say, the head was 
cut off.'' Strickland added: ``In the old days, when Stern said jump, 
the players jumped. He dictated everything. Now you have Billy setting 
times for meetings and telling them he's out of town for a personal 
matter. Depending on your side, he has rightly or wrongly changed 
the pace of negotiations a bit. But so what? Stern has got under a 
lot of people's skin over the years.''
