Patients sometimes switch health plans. But what happens if your doctor 
does? Elizabeth Cohen reports your health care may suffer. It's a 
labor dispute. About 450 doctors in Dallas have dropped out of the 
Aetna/U.S. healthcare hmo. And Carolyn Schaefer, along with tens of 
thousands of other patients, is caught in the middle. Her doctor is 
one of those who left the HMO, which leaves her in a bind. She's out 
of work because scoliosis has taken its toll on her back and arm. 
It's extremely swollen. I have no feeling in it. It's at the point 
where I can't get my ring off. But as you can tell, it's all swollen, 
there's no feeling in it. There is a treatment to ease her pain, and 
she now has two choices. She can keep seeing her own doctor -- she's 
been seeing him for three years, she can get an appointment immediately. 
And she likes him. But since he's no longer in the HMO, she would 
have to pay out of her own pocket -- Schaefer says at least $4,000. 
Or she could switch to a new doctor who is in the HMO and wait two 
weeks for an appointment while she's in pain and earning only half 
her salary. So how did this dispute between the doctors and the HMO 
begin? It's tough to decipher what's at the heart of it because both 
sides see things so differently. We broke off our contract with Aetna/U.S. 
healthcare's HMO because of a Breach in the contract on their part. 
The business model didn't work, the doctors ended up in a deficit. 
So you have to say that it is about money and it is about finances. 
But the bottom line is that many patients say they're not getting 
the care they need, and now doctors and patients across the country 
are watching. I think there'll be more instances like Dallas. And 
part of it will depend on how the Dallas incident works out. Ginsburg 
explains that this dispute is happening now because doctors have figured 
out that if they organize into groups, they can have clout against 
the HMOs. So now, there's tension between doctors' groups and HMOs 
in other cities, too. In Dallas, negotiations between the two sides 
continue. And in the meantime, it's the patients who are the losers.
