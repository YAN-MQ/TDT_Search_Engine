In their first TV debate Saturday, the two main candidates running 
in Taipei's mayoral election tried to mend the ethnic rift they have 
stirred up in their campaigns. ``I would rather lose the race than 
stir up ethnic confrontation,'' incumbent mayor Chen Shui-bian of 
the opposition Democratic Progressive party said at the public debate, 
the first ahead of the Dec. 5 election. In his campaign, Chen said, 
he only stressed his identify as a native-born Taiwanese rather than 
challenging that of his main opponent, Ma Ying-jeou of the ruling 
Nationalist Party. Ma, a former justice minister, was born in Taiwan 
but his father emigrated from mainland China when the Nationalists 
lost a civil war to the Communist forces in 1949. Among Taipei's 2.6 
million people, 25 percent are Chinese immigrants and the rest are 
native-born Taiwanese. Ma is known to be among those Nationalists 
who adamantly support eventual reunification with China. But to appeal 
to the ordinary Taiwanese who is wary of China's attempt to force 
unification on the island, Ma has adopted a campaign slogan of ``Taiwan 
First.' During the two-hour debate, Ma urged Chen not to ``stir up 
the most fragile nerve of Taiwanese'' by labeling him as one who might 
sell out Taiwan to China. He denounced Chen's campaign aides for telling 
voters earlier that electing Ma could turn Taiwan into another Hong 
Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule last year. ``One out of four 
families here has a mixed marriage between a native born and one whose 
parents came from China,'' Ma said. ``We must not widen a wound that 
has taken us decades to heal.'' Chen was elected in 1994 as the first 
opposition mayor of Taipei, and the Nationalists named the popular 
Ma in hope of recovering the capital. But the ethnic question lingers. 
Even the New Party candidate Wang Chien-hsien said in the debate that 
he would offer his sympathy to Ma for the lack of personal support 
from President Lee Teng-hui, the island's first native-born leader. 
Wang cited opinion polls as saying most Taipei voters believe Lee 
personally cared for Chen more than Ma. The small New Party also favors 
reunification with China. Ma objected. ``As head of the Nationalist 
Party, President Lee certainly supports his party's own candidate,'' 
he said.
