Mitch is now a hurricane. Forecasters upgraded it from a tropical 
storm, after its winds strengthened by 30 miles per hour early today. 
Mitch's sustained winds are now at 90 miles per hour. As of 5:00 A.M. 
eastern time, Mitch was centered about 255 miles south-southwest of 
Kingston, Jamaica, moving north at six miles per hour. If it continues 
on that track, hurricane watches could be posted for jamaica today. 
But forecasters expect Mitch to eventually turn to the west.
