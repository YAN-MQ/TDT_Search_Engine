Rutgers, which had been taking baby steps toward improving its program, 
looked across the field Saturday at a team making giant steps. Tulane, 
a perennial loser that only two seasons ago was 2-9, has become a 
fleet-footed winner. The Green Wave (6-0, 3-0 Conference U.S.A.) entered 
the game as one of the nation's eight undefeated teams in Division 
I-A and was ranked 22nd by The Associated Press poll. Its 52-24 drilling 
of Rutgers (3-4, 1-3 Big East) before a disappointing crowd of 20,714 
at Rutgers Stadium showed why. Coach Tommy Bowden has constructed 
a relentless offense run by greyhounds in green pants. Quarterback 
Shaun King and receiver P.J. Franklin made the most of a gorgeous 
afternoon. King completed 23 for 27 passes for 320 yards and four 
touchdowns and rushed for 31 yards and two touchdowns. He completed 
18 of 20 passes for 265 yards and four touchdowns before halftime, 
tying his career high for a game. Franklin hauled in 12 receptions 
for 159 yards and two touchdowns. King moved Tulane's spread-out, 
no-huddle offense up and down the field with dump-off passes and the 
occasional medium-range toss that his fleet receivers would turn into 
a long gain. King threw mostly from a shotgun formation. The Green 
Wave had not experienced a winning season since 1981 until Bowden 
came aboard last season and led the team to a 7-4 record. On Saturday 
the second-year coach worked with a heavy heart, knowing that his 
brother, Terry, had quit as the coach of Auburn the day before because 
he had been under increasing pressure for a losing season. What used 
to be the city of New Orleans' running joke is now just running. Tulane 
is off to its best start in 24 years. The Green Wave rolled up 586 
yards of offense to Rutgers' 343 _ 161 from quarterback Mike McMahon, 
who completed 14 of 27 attempts resulting in a touchdown and an interception. 
The teams traded turnovers in the third quarter before Tulane applied 
the knockout blow. King scrambled 7 yards for a touchdown to give 
the Green Wave a 45-17 lead with 4 minutes 41 seconds left in the 
third quarter, capping an 11-play, 77-yard drive. With both defenses 
ranked near the bottom nationally, the first half was predictably 
offensive. The Scarlet Knights were able to score, but the Green Wave 
was able to score a lot more. Tulane broke on top when tailback Jamaican 
Dartez went over from the 1-yard line. Rutgers stayed with Tulane 
briefly. Running backs Gary Fauntleroy and Jacki Crooks punctured 
the Green Wave for double-digit gains to lead an 8-play, 70-yard drive 
to tie the score at 10-10 as time expired in the first quarter. Tulane 
tacked on King's 1-yard touchdown pass off a play-action fake to tight 
end Joseph Aikin to creep ahead, 17-10. Then Tulane's Michael Jordan, 
knocked so woozy on a previous play that he began walking toward Rutgers' 
huddle, intercepted a McMahon pass to set up King's 71-yard touchdown 
bomb to Adrian Burnette, increasing Tulane's margin to 24-10. King's 
10-yard touchdown pass to Franklin gave the Green Wave a 31-10 lead 
late in the second quarter. But McMahon responded by firing a 49-yard 
dart to wide receiver Bill Powell to make the score 31-17 with 2 minutes 
35 seconds left. That could be a lifetime in this type of game. On 
the next possession, Toney Converse's tackle-breaking 37-yard run 
gave Tulane a first down at the Rutgers 34. A few plays later, King 
hit Franklin with a 7-yard pass to make it 38-17 at the half.
