President Nelson Mandela on Saturday kicked off a voter registration 
drive aimed at winning two-thirds majority for his party in the 1999 
elections. ``If we get another 62 percent, we will have failed,'' 
said Mandela. The ANC needs two thirds _ or 66.66 percent _ in Parliament 
to change the country's first democratic constitution, a prospect 
that has provoked the country's half dozen minority parties to seek 
coalitions with one other. Mandela's party won 1994's first all-race 
elections after decades of struggle to unseat apartheid rule. Speaking 
to about 2,000 party faithful, Mandela said the 1999 vote would represent 
an effort to deepen democracy. The president has not yet set the election 
date. Briefing notes handed to reporters on Saturday said the ANC 
is ``working on a likely election date of early May 1999.'' The ANC 
provincial secretary for Gauteng, the home province of Johannesburg, 
said local officials are lobbying for early May because seasonal rains 
would have stopped and the weather would still be warm. ``If you open 
up early and are still standing at 9 at night in June and July, it's 
too cold,'' the official, Obed Bapela, told The Associated Press. 
The Independent Electoral Commission hopes to register most voters 
between Nov. 27 to 29 as it tackles another milestone for the new 
democracy _ that of creating a national voters' roll. In 1994, anyone 
with an identification document could vote anywhere without registering 
beforehand. The lack of red tape helped ease tensions that preceded 
the country's first democratic vote. Under the new system, voters 
must apply for a bar-coded ID document from government, take a temporary 
receipt to an assigned voting station, and return for the permanent 
ID document in time for election day. Gauteng, the home province for 
Johannesburg, has 5 million eligible voters. Mandela echoed his party's 
increasingly strident reaction to criticism over continuing high employment 
of 34 percent and soaring crime. ``Not a single government in 346 
years has done a tenth of what the ANC has done'' in delivering housing, 
water and electricity to millions of poor blacks, Mandela said. But 
he chastised officials in the post-1994 government who stole public 
funds. ``When we took over in 1994, little did we know that some of 
our own people would be as corrupt as the apartheid government,'' 
he said.
