A bomb exploded at an office of the far-right National Front overnight, 
shattering windows and damaging furniture but causing no injuries, 
police said Saturday. A group calling itself ``Partisan Sharpshooters'' 
claimed responsibility for the attack. It was the same group that 
bombed two other National Front offices in France's biggest port since 
a young Comorian was killed here by Front members in 1995. The office 
staff includes Jean-Pierre Bauman, the Front's finance director and 
a former training instructor for members in the working-class district 
of northern Marseille. Bauman had that training position when Comorian 
Ibrahim Ali was killed in February 1995 by three Front members who 
were putting up the party's posters in the neighborhood. Bauman and 
party No. 2 Bruno Megret testified in the case, in which the three 
men were convicted in the murder the young man.
