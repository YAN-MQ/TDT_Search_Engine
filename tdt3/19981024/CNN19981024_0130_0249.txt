This latest Middle East peace deal may be historic, but many in the 
Arab world, think it's no reason to celebrate. Ben Wedeman tells us 
why. The people who live and work in Cairo's babaluke neighborhood 
say they've seen it all before. Another peace agreement, another round 
of upbeat rhetoric that this time the Middle East is on its way to 
lasting peace. From a pizzamaker -- "there's been no progress," he 
says, "no progress at all. But we hope that now they will be able 
to move ahead." From an elementary school teacher -- "the late President 
Sadat said reaching an agreement with Israel was extremely difficult. 
The camp David agreement took a lot of work. It's not easy dealing 
with the Israelis." Others brushed the agreement and the Israeli leader 
aside, echoing widespread Arab frustration with the Middle East peace 
process. "Netanyahu and his government should be thrown on the garbage 
heap of history," says this man. Elsewhere, in the Arab world, protests 
against the wye summit. In Lebanon, Palestinian refugees demonstrated 
against the deal before it was even signed. "Stha mossad leader, the 
traitor Yasser Arafat, has capitulated to the continuous demands of 
the Zionist enemy." The wye plantation agreement could help reverse 
growing Arab disappointment with the peace process, but the success 
of that agreement lies in its implementation. And that implementation 
will be watched by the Arab world very closely. Ben Wedeman, CNN, 
Cairo.
