Uzbekistan's Artur Grigorian stopped Italy's Giorgio Campanella with 
a barrage of punches in the 10th round Saturday to retain his WBO 
lightweight title. Grigorian, making the sixth defense of his belt, 
ran his record to 25-0 with 16 knockouts against Campanella, who failed 
for the third time to capture a title. Grigorian battered his foe 
with right hooks and left uppercuts before the referee stopped the 
bout with 1:36 remaining in the round. Campanella, 26-5 with one draw, 
knocked down Oscar de la Hoya in his first try at a belt in 1994, 
but was later knocked out in the WBO junior lightweight title fight. 
The corners of both Grigorian and Campanella had to contend with cuts 
above the left eyes of their fighters during the bout. Grigorian, 
after a slow start, was cut in the second, but he began to take control 
of the fight during the round by hammering Campanella with combinations. 
Campanella, a righthander, briefly switched to lead with his left 
in the seventh round to protect the wound above the eye. The fight 
was held on the undercard of the European heavyweight title fight 
between the Ukraine's Vitali Klitschko and Germany's Mario Schiesser. 
The unbeaten Klitschko won the the vacant title, stopping Schiesser 
in the second round after flooring the German twice. It was his 23rd 
knockout in as many fights. Grigorian weighed 61 kilos (134 pounds) 
and Campanella was at 60.8 (134 pounds).
