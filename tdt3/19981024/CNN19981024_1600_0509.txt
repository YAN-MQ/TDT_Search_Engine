This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather 
forecast" for Sunday. We're looking for a rather pleasant day across 
a lot of the country. There could be a few rain showers across the 
upper midwest and thunderstorms in southern Texas, and it will still 
be wet and windy with mountain snow across the western part of the 
country. An area of low pressure will drop southward across Nevada 
and Utah, spreading rain showers into the great basin region with 
snow in the higher elevations. Forecast highs on Sunday just 40s and 
50s from the Great Lakes into New England. We'll see 70s and a few 
80s down across the south. Looking ahead to Monday, rain and thunderstorms 
with mountain snow pushed southeastward. The coolest air, once again, 
New England, 40s and 50s. On Tuesday, we'll see showers and storms 
spreading eastward. Highs just in the 40s and 50s over New England 
again. For Wednesday, look for rain showers from the northwest into 
the northern Great Lakes. 50s and 60s north, 70s and 80s south. Don't 
forget, you can find four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 cities 
at cNN.com.
