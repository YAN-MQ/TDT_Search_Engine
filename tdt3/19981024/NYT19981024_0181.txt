The Mets continued to zero in on their prime target Saturday, moving 
closer to a deal with catcher Mike Piazza. Although both the Mets 
and a friend of Piazza said they had not reached agreement on a new 
contract, they seemed virtually certain to do that before long. The 
friend of Piazza said a deal was ``not completely done,'' leaving 
the impression that only some details needed to be worked out. He 
acknowledged that the catcher's agent, Dan Lozano, and Steve Phillips, 
the Mets' general manager, were very close to completing a deal. Jay 
Horwitz, the Mets' spokesman, said that Phillips spoke to Lozano Friday 
night and ``they're optimistic they can get something done, but we 
do not have an announcement at this time.'' Neither side has discussed 
details of a possible deal, but others have said they are talking 
seven years for a total in the low $90 million range. The Mets also 
are close to reaching agreement with pitcher Al Leiter, who like Piazza 
is eligible for free agency. ``We are extremely close, but we're not 
quite there yet,'' Leiter said by telephone from his Florida home. 
``If two sides want to get something done, it can get done and that's 
what it's been like since Day 1.'' Leiter has sought a four-year, 
$32 million deal, and he indicated that the Mets aren't quite there.
