Sudanese rebels claimed Saturday that they have shot down a MiG-23 
jet fighter and fended off a government attack in the south. The Sudan 
People's Liberation Army said their forces shot down the Russian-built 
fighter of the Sudanese Air Force at 8:30 a.m. near al-Jabalain, 64 
Kilometers (40 miles) east of Juba, Egypt's Middle East News Agency 
reported from Asmara, the Eritrean capital. Sudanese government forces 
and the SPLA rebels have been fighting for more than a month in East 
Equatoria province. Juba, which lies 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) 
south of Khartoum, is the capital of the province and the biggest 
town in southern Sudan. The rebel statement said government forces 
suffered heavy losses in men and equipment in an attack to recapture 
al-Jabalain. ``Al-Jabalain garrison has become a graveyard for the 
forces of the ruling regime in Sudan,'' the statement said. A reporter 
at the official Sudanese News Agency in Khartoum told The Associated 
Press that the government had not issued any statement Saturday on 
military action in the country. The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 
to win autonomy for the south's Christians and adherents of tribal 
faiths from the north's Muslim and Arab population. More than 1.5 
million people have died in the fighting and accompanying famines.
