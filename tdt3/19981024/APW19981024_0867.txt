A new book accuses Princess Diana of making death threats against 
Camilla Parker Bowles and suggests it was Diana, not Prince Charles, 
who first committed adultery, a Sunday tabloid reported. Excerpts 
from ``Prince Charles, Villain or Victim,'' by journalist Penny Junor, 
are being published in The Mail on Sunday and described as a defense 
of Prince Charles by friends who spoke to the author. The newspaper's 
tabloid rivals on Sunday characterized the book as a ``smearing'' 
of Diana and a ``vile attack'' that will backfire on the prince. The 
first installment did not appear in early editions of The Mail on 
Sunday, but a front page article described the book as a challenge 
to ``some of the inaccuracies and injustices'' of Diana's version 
of events in Andrew Morton's now-famous 1992 book ``Diana, Her True 
Story'' and in her television interview. ``Junor suggests'' that James 
Hewitt, the lover Diana acknowledged, was not her first during the 
marriage ``and that she had already had a relationship with Barry 
Mannakee,'' her personal detective, the newspaper said. The newspaper 
alleges that was before Prince Charles resumed his relationship with 
Mrs. Parker Bowles in 1985. Mannakee's transfer from his post as Diana's 
guard, and his subsequent death in a motorcycle accident have already 
been widely reported. Diana is also reported to have telephoned Mrs. 
Parker Bowles late at night and said, ``I've sent someone to kill 
you. They're outside in the garden. Look out of the window; can you 
see them?'' On the night of Diana's death Aug. 31, 1997, the report 
says Charles had to argue with Queen Elizabeth II about going to Paris 
to bring the princess' body home. The queen reportedly allowed the 
use of one of her aircraft after an aide said: ``Would you rather, 
Ma'am, that she come back in a Harrods van?'' A separate article by 
Junor said that Charles had never spoken ill of Diana ``in all their 
years together and apart, and despite the provocation... ``Now that 
she is dead Charles is even more determined that he will not defend 
himself and that history alone shall be his judge,'' Junor wrote. 
But she said ``a number of his family and friends'' believed some 
attempt should be made now to correct some misconceptions. A Buckingham 
Palace spokesman said Saturday night that ``the book was neither official 
nor authorized. ``We would like to remind people that Prince William 
and Prince Harry expressed the hope in September that their mother 
and her memory should finally be allowed to rest in peace,'' he said 
on customary condition of anonymity.
