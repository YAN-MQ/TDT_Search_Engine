Tuesday is the deadline for Yugoslavia to meet all its promises on 
the kosovo province or risk NATO air strikes. Based on what it's seen, 
the western alliance thinks it's time for a Stern warning. NAto's 
top two generals are heading to Belgrade to tell the Serbs they must 
step up troop withdrawals from Kosovo. NAto officials say there's 
been "progress" but nothing close to "adequate compliance." Scattered 
trouble continues in Kosovo, but the Serbs insist it's not their fault. 
They say they've fully complied with their end of the bargain, and 
blame ethnic Albanian rebels for the latest violence. Later today, 
the U.N. security council should vote on a resolution to endorse the 
Kosovo peace accord and NATO's enforcement of it. China and Russia 
oppose the use of force and could veto it.
