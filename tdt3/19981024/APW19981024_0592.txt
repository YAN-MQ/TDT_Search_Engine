Switzerland's national air carrier Swissair said Saturday it has struck 
an accord for closer cooperation with South African Airways. Under 
the agreement, Swissair will code-share with SAA on flights between 
Zurich and Johannesburg, a Swissair press release said. Code sharing 
allows the two airlines to book seats on each other's flights and 
to honor each other's frequent flier programs. The two airlines will 
introduce a daily flight southbound from Zurich within the next few 
months, the release said. The companies say the agreement will result 
in better and faster connections on the African and European continents 
and improved check-in arrangements. Swissair is developing a wide 
network of alliances with other airlines across the globe. Earlier 
this year, the firm announced partnerships with Japan Airlines and 
Hong Kong based carrier Cathay Pacific. They complement alliances 
with Delta Airlines in the United States, Austrian Airlines, Belgium's 
Sabena, Air Portugal, Turkish Airlines and AOM of France.
