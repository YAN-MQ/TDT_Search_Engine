Finally, healing the wounds from Germany's Nazi past. It's a priority 
for the new German government dealing with the debt of dishonor, compensating 
Holocaust survivors who performed slave labor. This reunion brought 
Ernst Michel back to hell. Now an American citizen, he and dozens 
of others, returned to Germany for the first time in decades to jog 
their memories and recall the past for a New generation. They had 
been forced, by the Nazis, to work unpaid and barely fed in germany's 
wartime factories doomed, themselves, to the gas Chambers, if they 
weakened. There were millions of slave laborers, all over Europe. 
Not just Jews. Poles, French, Italians, Dutch, norwegians. They came 
from all over. And, today, survivors are seeking justice, a barrage 
of class-action suits with the help of U.S. lawyers against Germany's 
biggest brand names -- Volkswagen, siemens, BMW and other companies. 
They claim made millions, during world war II, off of their backs. 
This is not a moral level, this is a legal level. We worked for you 
and never got money for our work. For over 50 years, companies like 
Volkswagen have denied responsibility, saying the Nazis forced them 
to take on slave workers. While previous German governments paid billions 
of dollars in war reparations to Jews, saying that was enough. But 
new chancellor Gerhard Schroder wants to remove the stain. Meeting 
this week with leaders of companies under attack, he promised a Quick 
solution. The offensive seems to be paying off. The more publicity 
and world opinion you get into the situation, the more likelihood 
something will be done. Already, Volkswagen has set up a $12 million 
compensation fund. Others are expected to follow suit. But survivors 
say there's more than money at stake. A chance to right the wrong, 
before time runs out. Jim Maceda, NBC news, Frankfurt.
