More than 150 protesters gathered Saturday at the London hospital 
where former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is under arrest to 
demand that he be tried for genocide. A visiting Chilean senator said 
Pinochet's health is deteriorating. In driving wind and rain, protesters 
beat drums and tamborines and chanted, ''We want justice'' outside 
the private London Clinic, where Pinochet, 82, is recovering from 
back surgery while his lawyers fight a Spanish extradition warrant. 
Protesters included 35 Chilean exiles who traveled from France. Others 
came from Switzerland, Sweden and Spain. Pinochet was arrested Oct. 
16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite 
him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. The Spanish warrant 
cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to include some 3,000 people 
who were killed or disappeared during his 17-year-rule. Pinochet, 
whose rule was marked by human rights abuses and a climate of fear, 
had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a painful spinal disorder 
which had hindered his movement and the Chilean government has urged 
Britain to release him on humanitarian grounds. Chilean senator Ignacio 
Perez-Walker told reporters outside the clinic after visiting Pinochet 
Saturday that the former leader ''is a very strong man.'' ''However, 
his health appears very, very detiorated,'' said Perez-Walker. ''We 
spoke very briefly and he was very calm,'' he said, adding that Pinochet 
was only informed 48 hours ago that he was under arrest. Chile has 
also argued that Pinochet, as a senator, is entitled to diplomatic 
immunity. On Friday night, Pinochet's wife appealed for his release, 
saying he is too sick to be stand trial. ``This is very painful for 
our family,'' a tearful Lucia Pinochet told reporters outside the 
private London Clinic. ''I would like to ask for compassion for a 
person who is very, very, very, ill.'' Unconfirmed media reports in 
Chile this week indicated that Pinochet, who has worn a pacemaker 
for years and is diabetic, also has a urinary tract infection. There 
have also been reports that he is suffering from depression. Lawyers 
for the former strongman went to court Friday to argue that British 
police acted illegally in accepting the Spanish warrant. The case 
resumes Monday. Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 but remained army 
commander until last March. Then, he moved to congress as a senator 
for life, as permitted by the constitution his regime drafted.
