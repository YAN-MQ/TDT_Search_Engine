The bomb went off about 7:30 in the morning, just as Emily Lyons was 
heading into work. The damage was devastating. ``I lost my left eye 
and it damaged my right eye,'' Ms. Lyons said in a telephone interview 
on Thursday. ``Just today I got a contact lens. It's a big deal for 
me. It's the first time I'm able to see in nine months.'' Ms. Lyons, 
a registered nurse, was walking into the New Woman, All Women Health 
Care Clinic in Birmingham, Ala., last Jan. 29 when the homemade bomb 
exploded. It killed an off-duty policeman, Robert Sanderson, who worked 
as a security guard at the clinic. Ms. Lyons was almost killed. ``It 
pretty much mangled my right hand,'' she said. ``And my little finger 
was broken and didn't heal right, so I've got a permanently polite 
little pinky, like when you drink tea. The lower right side of my 
abdomen had a hole the size of your fist in it. They had to repair 
that. They had to remove part of my large and small intestine. ``Both 
of my kneecaps were full of nails. They had to open those up. Remove 
the nails so the joints would move again. My left leg was broken. 
They had to repair that. And my body is covered with dark spots. Long 
dark spots. That's where all the nails went in.'' Abortions were performed 
at the clinic and it had been a target of protesters for years. The 
bomb exploded a week after the 25th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the 
landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. The person 
who planted the bomb has not been caught. Ms. Lyons is married and 
the mother of two teen-age daughters. Her job at the clinic was to 
counsel women who were considering an abortion. For that she almost 
paid with her life. This week Ms. Lyons will take a small political 
step that she hopes will help the many men and women who face similar 
dangers. She will appear in a television ad in New York criticizing 
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., for voting against a bill designed to 
protect doctors and other health care workers and their clients from 
violent acts by anti-abortion extremists. The ad is sponsored by the 
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. The bill, 
which passed and was signed into law by President Clinton in 1994, 
made it a federal crime to attack or blockade an abortion clinic. 
It was sponsored by Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who is running against 
D'Amato for the Senate. D'Amato's office did not respond to questions 
last week about why he had opposed the bill, which was known as the 
Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Kate Michelman, the league's 
president, said, ``It took several deaths to finally have Congress 
take a serious look at the fact that in some communities across the 
country law enforcement officials either were not able to address 
the problem or they, frankly, were not willing to take action because 
some of them agreed with the protesters.'' A vote for the bill was 
not a vote in favor of abortion. It was a vote against the use of 
violence and murder to achieve a political end. As Ms. Michelman said, 
``It was about enforcing the rule of law in a civilized society.'' 
The law has helped reduce violence at abortion clinics, but the problem, 
as the attack in Birmingham showed, is still a serious one. A survey 
by the Feminist Majority Foundation found that nearly 25 percent of 
abortion clinics were targets of violence or threats of violence in 
1997. The survey said the clinics were plagued by ``blockades, invasions, 
bomb threats and bombings, arson threats and arsons, chemical attacks, 
death threats and stalking.'' Ms. Lyons said that as she began the 
long, slow recovery from her wounds she felt compelled ``to do whatever 
it takes in the future to make sure this doesn't happen to someone 
else.'' She taped the ad on Friday. In it she says, ``When a bomb 
ripped through my clinic I almost lost my life, and it will never 
be the same. When Al D'Amato had a chance, he voted against protecting 
women's health clinics from anti-abortion terrorists. I am determined 
to stop this violence against women, so I'm speaking out.'' I asked 
Ms. Lyons how she and her family were doing emotionally in the aftermath 
of the attack. ``Pretty well,'' she said. ``It's what life has dealt 
us this year. You take it and go with it.''
