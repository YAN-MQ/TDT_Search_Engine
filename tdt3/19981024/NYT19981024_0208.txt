Yale helped create a logjam atop the Ivy League Saturday, routing 
Columbia by 37-14 and moving into a four-way tie for first place. 
The Bulldogs (3-3), who finished last in 1996 and 1997, are now tied 
with Harvard, Penn and Princeton at 2-1 in the league. It was only 
the fourth victory in two seasons for Yale Coach Jack Siedlecki, who 
arrived last year from Amherst. Now, Siedlecki said: ``Anything can 
happen. We're a good football team.'' Columbia, which began this season 
with an astounding 24-0 upset of the defending Ivy League champion, 
Harvard, is in trouble. The Lions (2-4, 1-2), who lost for the fourth 
time in their last five games, once again failed to protect their 
quarterback, Ted Schroeder. He was sacked seven times, and has been 
sacked 17 times in three games. On defense the Lions felt the loss 
of their co-captain and middle linebacker, Jeremy Taylor, who tore 
a knee ligament in a loss to Penn last Saturday; he will not play 
again this year. ``The best linebacker in the league,'' Columbia Coach 
Ray Tellier said of Taylor. ``We just didn't have it today.'' Yale's 
37 points were the most a Bulldog team had scored since a40-38 victory 
over Brown in 1995, 36 games ago. The Bulldogs rushed for 342 yards, 
which surprised Siedlecki, whose game plan called for more passing. 
``But,'' he said, ``the right things all happened and that gave us 
confidence.'' Rashad Bartholomew, a transfer from the Air Force Academy, 
rushed for 194 yards, a career high, and scored Yale's last touchdown 
on a 70-yard run midway through the fourth quarter. Yale outgained 
Columbia, 452 yards to 210. The best effort for the Lions came from 
the freshman tailback Johnathan Reese, who had 48 yards rushing and 
104 yards returning kickoffs. Reese is ``as good a running back as 
I've ever recruited,'' Tellier said. Yale's quarterback, the left-handed 
Joe Walland, completed 12 of 21 passes for 110 yards and 2 touchdowns, 
both to tight end Brian Scharf, and rushed for 44 yards, including 
a 29-yard touchdown dash. Siedlecki, a college coach for 22 seasons, 
said of Walland, ``I've never had a quarterback like Joe, who can 
do everything.'' Siedlecki has added the option to his offense this 
year because Walland can run it so well, as he showed Saturday in 
key situations. Columbia scored first on an opening 65-yard drive, 
and Yale then scored 27 consecutive points. Its defense held the Lions 
to a net of 26 yards for the rest of the first half.
