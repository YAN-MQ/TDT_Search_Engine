Israeli warplanes fired at least two air-to-surface missiles at suspected 
guerrilla infiltration trails in occupied southeastern Lebanon on 
Saturday, security officials said. Two fighter jets targeted an area 
in a valley near the village of Qillaya, said the Lebanese officials, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. There was no immediate word on 
casualties from the 10:20 a.m. (0720 GMT) attack on the area, about 
20 kilometers (13 miles) southwest of Rashaya in the southern Bekaa 
Valley and about the same distance from the Israeli border. Rashaya 
is seven kilometers (four miles) north of the border enclave Israel 
has occupied in the south since 1985. In Jerusalem, the Israeli army 
confirmed the air raid. An army statement said Israeli warplanes returned 
safely to their bases after hitting their targets. Israeli jets often 
strike at guerrilla bases and infiltration trails in south and southeast 
Lebanon. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting 
to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen 
from the occupied zone.
