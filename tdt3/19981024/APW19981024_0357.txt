Hindus in the tourist island of Bali have threatened to stage a strike 
unless President B.J. Habibie fires a cabinet minister accused of 
insulting the minority religion. Indonesian media reports have quoted 
Food Minister A.M. Saefuddin as saying that opposition faction leader 
Megawati Sukarnoputri does not deserve Indonesian presidency because 
she is a Hindu. ``We give a longest deadline of one-month,'' protest 
coordinator I Nyoman Japa was quoted as saying Saturday by the official 
Antara news agency. ``If our demands are not fulfilled, then Hindus 
all over Indonesia are ready to joint in the mass strike,'' said Japa, 
who leads the People's Complaint Action, a movement set up to protest 
the remark. The group demanded Saefuddin, a Muslim party leader, to 
withdraw his remarks, apologize to Hindus and to resign. It also demanded 
that he be questioned and put on trial. Also Saturday, a group representing 
hotel employees, staged a protest at the offices of the Bali governor 
and the local council in Denpasar, denouncing Saefuddin. Saefuddin 
was reported to have asked: ``Are the Indonesian people willing to 
have a Hindu president?'' He has apologized, saying he had no intention 
of insulting any religion. Megawati's paternal grandmother came from 
the predominantly Hindu island of Bali. Her father, the late President 
Sukarno, and her mother were Islam. About 90 percent of Indonesia's 
202 million people are Muslim, making it the world most populous Islamic 
nation. Religious tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy 
and constitution. Indonesia plans to stage parliamentary elections 
next May under promised democratic reforms. Legislators will then 
select a new president. Saefuddin has expressed his intention to challenge 
the enormously popular Megawati, a candidate from the Indonesian Democratic 
Party.
