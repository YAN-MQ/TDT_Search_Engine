Annika Sorenstam shot a course-record 6-under 66 Saturday and took 
a one-stroke lead after three rounds of the Samsung World Championship 
of Women's Golf. The Swede will head into Sunday's final round with 
an 8-under 208, one stroke ahead of defending champion Juli Inkster, 
who matched Sorenstam's 66 at the 6,326-yard (5,693-meter) Tierra 
Del Sol course. Dottie Pepper carried a three-stroke lead into the 
third round but shot a 71 and fell into third place, two strokes behind 
Sorenstam. Sorenstam is the U.S. women's tour's leading money winner, 
the frontrunner in the points battle for Player of the Year and leading 
the race for the Vare Trophy _ given to the player with the lowest 
scoring average. With two official events remaining after this, Sorenstam 
is in good position to sweep the awards, just as she did in 1995, 
her second year on the tour. ``That's what I dream about, is having 
a chance to win a tournament on Sunday,'' Sorenstam said. ``Especially 
with it coming down to the end of the season, with the money list, 
Player of the Year and Vare Trophy. That would mean so much to me. 
I just have to go out and give it all tomorrow.'' She shot a 5-under 
31 on the back nine, looking every bit like the world's best player. 
South Korean rookie Se Ri Pak, Sorenstam's closest competitor on the 
money list and in the Player-of-the-Year chase, shot 73 for a 219 
total. Brandie Burton fired a 71 for 213. No one else in the 16-player 
field finished below par after three rounds, although decreased winds 
helped 10 players break par for the day. Inkster, who won this tournament 
last year when it was played in South Korea, hit 16 greens in regulation 
and converted eight for birdies. She said she didn't feel much difference 
from Friday, when she shot 73. ``I was frustrated yesterday, I was 
mad,'' she said. ``I played just as good yesterday as today, but today 
I made putts. That's where the difference is.'' Despite falling behind, 
Pepper felt she played some of her best golf of the year. She just 
couldn't catch a break, watching birdie putts lip out at Nos. 1, 2, 
6 and 7 and finishing her round with only two birdies, one bogey and 
15 pars. ``I parred it to death,'' she said. ``I felt I played a good 
round, but I haven't had my best one yet. I never got the momentum 
going to take it deep. If one or two had gone in, I'd have been off 
to the races.'' Pepper, the hero in the United States' victory over 
Europe in the Solheim Cup, is seeking her first tour victory since 
September 1996.
