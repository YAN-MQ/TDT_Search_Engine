Federal investigators have joined in the search for the killer of 
a New York doctor who performed abortions. Police say Dr. Barnett 
slepian was shot through a kitchen window in his home in Amherst, 
a town near Buffalo. Authorities believe his killer fired from behind 
a swimming pool in the back yard. The doctor had been the target of 
anti-abortion protests. Activists claimed a victory when he temporarily 
closed his office in 1992. But he continued to perform abortions at 
a clinic in Buffalo. I'm not afraid of them and I'm not afraid of 
the violence. But I fear for my family, my children. I think of if 
I wasn't around, what they would go through. But personally, I'm not 
afraid of them. The FBI and Canadian police had warned Tuesday of 
possible sniper attacks against doctors who performed abortions in 
the Rochester area and in canada.
