The Rangers aren't a great team. They probably won't be a good team 
for a while. Possibly, they might not even be a mediocre team in what 
is obviously a rebuilding season. But they do seem to be a competitive 
bunch that plays interesting games, at least after eight performances 
of the 1998-99 season. ``There just seems to be a better atmosphere 
in our locker room and throughout the organization,'' goalie Mike 
Richter said Saturday after making 35 saves in a 2-2 tie with the 
Flyers that extended the Rangers unbeaten streak to four games (2-0-2). 
It is a significant turnaround for the Rangers, who began the season 
with four consecutive defeats. Saturday's tie could have seemed like 
a defeat for the Rangers, who squandered a 2-0 lead in the third period, 
and they managed only one shot on goal in the period before putting 
two on Flyers goalie John Vanbiesbrouck in overtime. Over all, they 
were out-shot by 37-13. And the power play that led to Philadelphia's 
tying goal was created when Rangers defenseman Ulf Samuelsson was 
penalized for playing with a broken stick. Still, the Rangers seemed 
to hold their heads high as they left this big, loud, intimidating 
building. Samuelsson, playing with a fractured cheekbone protected 
by a face shield, absorbed many thundering checks, several from Eric 
Lindros. Samuelsson and Peter Popovic led a gritty effort by the Rangers' 
defense. ``They took hits to make plays,'' Wayne Gretzky said. John 
MacLean scored at even strength in the first period and Adam Graves 
had a power-play goal in the second for the Rangers. Philadelphia 
countered with John LeClair's goal at even strength and Rod Brind'Amour's 
power-play goal. The Rangers might have unraveled after the tying 
goal by Brind'Amour, which came at at 9 minutes 3 seconds of the third 
period. Samuelsson said he did not realize his stick was broken. The 
crowd roared in anticipation of the next face-off when Rangers Coach 
John Muckler called a timeout and began speaking with great emotion 
to his players huddled around him at the bench. ``I said, `There's 
10 minutes and 58 seconds to go and you're playing maybe the best 
team in the National Hockey League and you don't have to play 60 minutes 
to beat them,''' Muckler said. ```We're sitting in a good position. 
Why's everybody so concerned?''' Kevin Stevens, who assisted on MacLean's 
goal, said it was ``a good time for a timeout'' because the Flyers 
were ``coming at us hard and the fans were getting loud.'' Muckler, 
Stevens said, reminded them ``that it's 2-2, not 8-2.'' Samuelsson 
said his extra head and face gear prevented him from comprehending 
the speech. ``I've got the bubble on, I can't hear a thing, and the 
fans were so loud,'' he said. ``But I saw he was upset.'' The coach 
also had much to be pleased about. ``This hockey club battled,'' Muckler 
said. ``We deserved a point. We could have got 2.'' They certainly 
paid the price. Richter, in addition to a dozen fine saves, absorbed 
collisions with Philadelphia's Shjon Podein. Gretzky, for the second 
consecutive game, took a hard hit, this time from Valery Zelepukin. 
Center Todd Harvey put forth another energetic effort. On one shift, 
Harvey jousted with a Flyer. Then he blocked a Brind'Amour shot. Then 
he rammed himself into the boards trying to throw a check. Late in 
the third period, he got into a high-sticking exchange with Lindros, 
and their coinciding minor penalties favored the Rangers because Lindros 
was the better scoring threat. Popovic, coming back after missing 
two games with a severe cut near his right eye, was credited with 
nine hits and five blocked shots, best on the team in both categories. 
``This is the one we prize the most,'' he said of the point in the 
standings. ``We got out-shot, but we didn't get out worked.'' By adding 
Popovic, Mathieu Schneider and Jan Mertzig to their blue line, the 
Rangers have upgraded this core corps around the centerpiece, the 
captain Brian Leetch. Certainly the Rangers' flaws are as apparent 
as ever, particularly at forward. On the top line, Gretzky had two 
shots on goal, Aleksei Kovalev only one and Niklas Sundstrom none. 
General Manager Neil Smith returned from a scouting trip to Chicago, 
where he watched the Blackhawks play San Jose. Trade rumors are rampant 
around the Rangers, who need a second-line center and at least one 
more scoring wing. The Rangers had to be encouraged by the line of 
MacLean, Stevens and Tikkanen, all 33, which was assigned to check 
Lindros, LeClair and Mike Maneluk as Muckler did more matching on 
the fly than usual. MacLean now has two goals this season and gives 
the Rangers something they have lacked since losing Mark Messier: 
a sniper who can pick a spot and hit it, on the rush, on the first 
try. MacLean led the team with three shots on goal. That is good for 
him, but not so good for the Rangers. Their next target: Buffalo's 
Dominik Hasek on Tuesday night.
