Five ethnic Albanians were found seriously wounded Saturday, after 
crossing into Albanian from Kosovo, Albanian officials said. Two old 
men, two children and a woman _ all believed to be refugees from the 
Prizren region in Kosovo _ were found near the border village of Pogaj 
inside Albanian territory, said Aratan Bizhga, a spokesman for the 
Interior Ministry. Albanian authorities sent two helicopters to rescue 
the five and bring them to a hospital in the capital Tirana, Bizhga 
said. It was unclear what had caused their injuries. On Friday, four 
other Kosovo refugees were found wounded in the same region.
