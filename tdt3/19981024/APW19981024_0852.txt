Militant Jewish settlers threatened Saturday to keep the new Middle 
East peace accord from taking effect, vowing to try to topple the 
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for signing it. Extremist 
right-wing settlers believe Israel's agreement to cede 13 percent 
of West Bank land to the Palestinians threatens their very existence. 
Initial settler response to Friday's accord was muted by the Jewish 
Sabbath, which began at sundown. But settlers said street protests 
were planned for Sunday. Police said they beefed up security in preparation 
for angry Israeli outbursts against the peace accord and for possible 
attacks by anti-Israeli militants wishing to derail its implementation. 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton joined 
Netanyahu in signing the agreement reached during a marathon nine-day 
summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland. Most settlers who are observant 
Jews did not watch the White House ceremony on television Friday night 
because they refrain from using appliances or machines on the Sabbath. 
On the Palestinian side, reaction to the agreement was cautious but 
upbeat. The three Palestinian dailies splashed the signing on their 
front pages Saturday with headlines in large, bold type. Editorials 
said that although many Palestinian goals remain unfulfilled, the 
agreement is a step toward peace. The leading daily Al-Quds, which 
generally reflects the thinking of Arafat's government, said the accord 
suggested that Netanyahu and his right-wing allies are finally accepting 
the reality of Palestinian aspirations. Some ordinary Palestinians, 
though, were more pessimistic. ``What is an agreement _ does it mean 
the settlement at the top of the mountain will go away? Or that the 
checkpoint will go away? I don't think so,'' said a 25-year-old worker 
named Mohammed as he walked down a street in the West Bank town of 
Nablus carrying loaves of bread. Israel captured the West Bank after 
capturing it from Jordan in 1967. The 2,300 square-mile (6,000-square-kilometer) 
area is home to an estimated 1.6 million Palestinians and about 155,000 
Israelis. In an, 13th graf
