Top seed John McEnroe overcame a let-down after playing old rival 
Bjorn Borg to beat Henri Leconte in the semifinals of the Champions 
seniors tennis tournament Saturday. McEnroe scored his 16th-straight 
victory, including six on the senior tour, over the Frenchman with 
a 7-6 (12-10), 6-7 (5-7), 10-5 win. It followed McEnroe's victory 
over Borg on Friday night in front of what local promoters called 
a record crowd for seniors tennis of 11,200. ``Something about (Friday) 
night just felt magical,'' McEnroe said. ``It was a bit of a predicament 
today because it was hard to top yesterday.'' The triple Wimbledon 
champion faces the winner of the other semi-final between Borg and 
Johan Kriek in the final.
