An American woman serving a life sentence for terrorism complained 
Saturday of the isolation she suffers in her new prison, her mother 
said. Lori Berenson said she preferred the frigid conditions of her 
old prison, where she spent the past three years, to ``being isolated 
from the world and on a regime that is different from all of the other 
prisoners who are not even permitted to look at me,'' she said, according 
to her mother, Rhoda. Lori Berenson was transferred two weeks ago 
to Socabaya prison near the city of Arequipa, 465 miles (750 kilometers) 
southeast of Lima to undergo medical tests. She had been at Yanamayo 
prison, 12,700 feet (3,870 meters) high in the Andes. Doctors say 
Berenson, 28, suffers from swollen arthritic hands and respiratory 
problems caused by the cold and high altitude at Yanamayo. Her hands 
are still ``purple and distorted,'' her parents said. Lori Berenson's 
medical exams have not been completed. Lori Berenson was convicted 
by a hooded military judge in 1996 of helping leftist rebels of the 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan a thwarted assault on Peru's 
Congress. Her parents, who have appealed to human rights groups and 
the Costa Rican-based International Human Rights Court, maintain their 
daughter is innocent and that her secret trial by a military court 
didn't allow her a fair defense. U.S. officials have asked Peru to 
give hear an open, civilian trial. But Peru's President Alberto Fujimori 
said she is a terrorist and will receive no special treatment. While 
she suffered from cold and altitude at Yanamayo, Lori Berenson says 
she is now suffering from isolation. Her mother quoted her as saying, 
``They have thrown me in a cage and isolated me from the world.'' 
Nonetheless, she added that her daughter will not request to be returned 
to Yanamayo. When Lori Berenson was taken by helicopter from the old 
prison, she was blindfolded, which prevented her from seeing the outside 
world for the first time in three years, her parents said. She was 
hooded with a bed sheet when she was transferred from her cell at 
Socabaya to the prison infirmary so that no other prisoners could 
see her.
