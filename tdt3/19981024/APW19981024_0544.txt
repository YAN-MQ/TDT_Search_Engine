Guinea-Bissau's rebels have announced a 48-hour cease-fire in the 
tiny west African country, demanding that President Joao Bernardo 
Vieira present a negotiating agenda, news reports said Saturday. The 
rebels gave Vieira until Sunday afternoon to present an agenda for

the rebels lay their weapons down. Vieira announced a unilateral government 
cease-fire Wednesday, but the rebels want guarantees before entering

conflict began June 7 following Brig. Ansumane Mane's dismissal as 
army chief for allegedly running guns to separatist fighters in Senegal's 
southern Casamance province. Portugal's Foreign Minister traveled 
Saturday to Guinea-Bissau aiming to halt a slide back to civil war,

said. Jaime Gama was to fly into the capital Bissau's airport, which 
rebels have held for almost five months, a spokesman for the Portuguese 
Foreign Ministry said. ``Guinea-Bissau's authorities expressed interest

rebel cease-fire announcement late Friday. Fighting restarted, graf
