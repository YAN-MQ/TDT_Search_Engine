This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News" weather 
forecast from today into Sunday. A pretty quiet weekend around the 
country, although not in the west. An area of low pressure will produce 
some widespread rain and mountain snow. Snow levels in the northern 
mountains of California will come down to about 5,000 feet today. 
Look for a few thunderstorms over south Texas, a shower or two across 
the upper midwest. High temperatures today will be mostly in the 60s 
and 70s, just 50s northwest and northern New England. We'll see a 
few 80s in the extreme south, southwest and over southern florida. 
Looking ahead to Monday, we'll see some rain and thunderstorms dropping 
southward as that low pressure center moves that way. 70s and 80s 
as things warm up again in the southeastern part of the country. On 
Tuesday, though, showers and storms continue through the central and 
southern Rockies with temperatures still in the 40s and 50s through 
New England. For Wednesday, the rain switches to the northern part 
of the country. Most of the north will see 50s and 60s. Don't forget, 
you can find four-day forecasts now for 7,200 cities on CNN interactive 
at CNN.com.
