you're significantly overweight your doctor has a way to help you. 
It's called meridia, and it can help you lose weight and keep it off. 
You've got to do your part. You've got to do your part with diet and 
exercise, but meridia can help. Meridia is a prescription medicine 
and it's not for everyone. It can substantially raise blood pressure 
and it's not for people who are pregnant or nursing, under 16, or 
taking anything else for weight loss depression, Parkinson's disease, 
migraines, or for people with glaucoma, anorexia, seizures, or serious 
heart, liver or kidney problems. It's a controlled substance, so some 
patients may experience limited dependence. Side effects may include 
headache, constipation, insomnia and dry mouth. For more information, 
ask your doctor or call I'm ready. Meridia. you do your part ...we'll
