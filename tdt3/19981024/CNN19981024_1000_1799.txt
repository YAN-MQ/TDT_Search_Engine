"Headline News." I'm Sachi Koto. Governments around the world are 
praising an interim peace agreement signed in Maryland yesterday by 
Israeli and Palestinian leaders. But many issues still must be resolved, 
and some are urging caution. In the West Bank, Palestinian residents 
are receiving the deal with a mix of skepticism and indifference. 
The main Palestinian newspaper says the deal shows Israeli prime minister 
benjamin Netanyahu is finally accepting Palestinian political aspirations. 
Other Arab newspapers say the pact is unfair to Palestinians, or might 
not be implemented. Some Israelis say they're concerned opposition 
to the deal from hard-line settlers could bring down Netanyahu's government.
