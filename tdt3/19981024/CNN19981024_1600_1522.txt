More and more male models are strutting the fashion runways in China. 
And they are slowly gaining respect in a profession dominated by women. 
World report contributor China central TV has more. Smiling. Turning 
on the catwalk. Being surrounded by some of the world's most beautiful 
women. This is the glamorous world in which male models live and work. 
Underneath the polished veneer, models work under constant pressure 
in the hectic backstage world of fashion. But in China, where modeling 
careers for men are only beginning to gain respectability, men who 
choose the profession sometimes face the added concern of acceptance. 
Most of us still believe that this job is not a proper occupation 
for a man. The first generation of Chinese male models appeared in 
the early '80s. Some of the models from this era are still working 
today. 35-year-old John way reports that he was given 20 to 30 yen 
a show in 1985, about three U.S. dollars. But now he earns several 
thousand yen per show. Presently, there are about 200 male models 
in China who work regularly. And of these, 20 are full-time professionals. 
The rest part-time players who also hold other jobs. There are no 
agencies in China that manage the careers of male models. Most models 
must serve as their own agent and teach the modeling craft to themselves. 
For those who juggle several jobs, time must be found to keep their 
bodies fit and in shape. But there is a more fundamental problem that 
confronts male models, a Problem that is inherent to the male fashion 
industry in China. The industry which has been developing rapidly 
over the past years can still boast of very few domestic name brands 
for men. Male fashion lags far behind female fashion. This translates 
into a sluggish job market for male models. This man is considered 
to be the top male model in China. He shares the same feeling about 
the absence of strong domestic name brands and respected designers. 
If domestic men's fashion was internationally known, Chinese male 
models would then be world class models. He says that the potential 
market for men's fashion in China is huge. That's why he says he doesn't 
plan to quit the profession, at least not for the time being. This 
is Hong bin of China central television for "CNN world report."
