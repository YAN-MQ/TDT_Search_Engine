reaction in the middle east to the interim peace agreement twin israel 
and the palestinians ranges from cautious optimism to fierce opposition. 
some jewish settlers in the west bank are threatening widespread protests 
against the deal. those protests will likely wait until tomorrow. 
orthodox jews are observing the sabbath today. newspapers are lambasting 
the accord. one paper says the accord swallowed or deleted palestinian 
rights. others called it a dreadful deal for palestinians. the agreement 
contains a plan to end violence between israelis and palestinians, 
a plan for israeli troop redeployment. the egyptian government, no 
stranger to peace deals with israel, calls the agreement a step in 
the right direction. but many egyptian residents are taking news of 
the deal with a pinch of salt, ben weedman explains. the people who 
live and work in cairo's babaluke neighborhood say they've seen it 
all before. another peace agreement, another round of upbeat rhetoric 
that this time the middle east is on its way to lasting peace. from 
a pizzamaker -- "there's been no progress," he says, "no progress 
at all. but we hope that now they will be able to move ahead." from 
an elementary school teacher -- "the late president sadat said reaching 
an agreement with israel was extremely difficult. the camp david agreement 
took a lot of work. it's not easy dealing with the israelis." others 
brushed the agreement and the israeli leader aside, echoing widespread 
arab frustration with the middle east peace process. "netanyahu and 
his government should be thrown on the garbage heap of history," says 
this man. elsewhere, in the arab world, protests against the wye summit. 
in lebanon, palestinian refugees demonstrated against the deal before 
it was even signed. "that leader, the trader, yasser arafat, has capitulated 
to the continuous demands of the zionist enemy." the wye plantation 
agreement could help reverse growing arab disappointment with the 
peace process, but the success of that agreement lies in its implementation. 
and that implementation will be watched by the arab world very closely.
