Sometime soon the Jets are going to have to beat a nondivision opponent 
to keep alive their playoff dreams. ``It may have been my fault,'' 
coach Bill Parcells said Friday, noting that the Jets are 3-3, with 
all the victories coming against American Football Conference East 
teams. ``I put a tremendous emphasis on division games.'' Why not? 
Last season, the Jets' record was marred by a 2-6 mark against other 
teams in their division. So, what will happen against Sunday's nondivision 
opponent, the 5-1 Atlanta Falcons? Atlanta has captured three straight 
games, and Jamal Anderson's rushing average puts him at a 1,700-yard 
pace for the season. Anderson will be the Jets' major obstacle, especially 
if Falcon quarterback Chris Chandler does not play. Chandler's sore 
left (nonthrowing) shoulder makes his appearance unlikely. His absence 
would be a big loss for the Falcons, who are 13-3 in the last 16 games 
Chandler has played. If Chandler cannot go, the 44-year-old Steve 
DeBerg will start. DeBerg, an assistant coach under Coach Dan Reeves 
with the Giants, came out of retirement to hook up with Reeves again 
in Atlanta. He has not started since 1993, for Miami. DeBerg would 
be 2 years older than any other player who has ever started in the 
National Football League. The primary responsibility for halting Anderson 
will go to the Jets' middle linebacker, which is now a two-headed 
position. Pepper Johnson starts, plays a quarter and then is replaced 
by Dwayne Gordon. And what does Johnson, who hates not being in on 
every defensive play, say about splitting time? ``I don't have a comment 
on that,'' he said. Why does Parcells alternate Johnson, 34, who shares 
Parcells' Super Bowl history with the Giants? ``I don't want to get 
him killed,'' Parcells said. Another veteran linebacker, Bryan Cox, 
is thriving in the Jets' defensive system. Cox, 30, was signed to 
a one-year contract as an emergency replacement after training-camp 
injuries to Marvin Jones and Casey Dailey. Cox has become an important 
player in third-down schemes. He had four solo tackles last Monday 
against the Patriots. He said he had one problem, and it might also 
affect his future: his wife and four children are back in Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla. He said family considerations could have an impact on any decision 
to remain a Jet. EXTRA POINTS Season statistics have a way of being 
skewed by big victories and big losses. So, it is not surprising that 
the Jets (3-3) do not necessarily have middle-of-the-pack numbers. 
_ Takeaway-giveaway: Minus-3. Conference rank: 13th. Largely because 
of the error-filled game against the Rams _ five turnovers, no takeaways 
_ the Jets are near the bottom. _ First downs: 132. Conference rank: 
first. KEYSHAWN JOHNSON and WAYNE CHREBET repeatedly make big receiving 
plays. Johnson is averaging more than 15 yards a catch on third-down 
receptions. _ Total offense: 2,104 yards. Conference rank: second. 
CURTIS MARTIN and VINNY TESTAVERDE have helped to improve the offense 
significantly. _ Total defense: 1,961 yards. Conference rank: 13th. 
Again, one game skewed the results _ the 49ers amassed 557 yards in 
the opener, an overtime victory for the Niners. _ Curtis Martin: Averaging 
126.4 yards a game, including rushing and receiving. That is the sixth-best 
average in the league. Atlanta's JAMAL ANDERSON is fourth at 133.7. 
But with Testaverde at quarterback in three starts, Martin is at 168.3.
