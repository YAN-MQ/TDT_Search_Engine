Helmut Zilk, a former mayor of Vienna, was rejected for a Czech Republic 
medal of honor because of suspicions that he was a communist spy, 
a German newspaper reported Saturday. Zilk, 71, allegedly spied for 
the communist government of the former Czechoslovakia during the 1960s 
and `70s. He denied the accusation, which the Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
newspaper quoted him as calling ``complete nonsense.'' The suspicion 
surfaced after Zilk, 71, was nominated for the order of the White 
Lion because of serious injuries he received from a letter bomb. Zilk 
lost part of his hand in the December 1993 explosion, which happened 
during one of his terms as mayor of the Austrian capital. Czech President 
Vaclav Havel withdrew the honor after a source claimed that Zilk spied 
for the Czech communist secret service and provided information that 
led to several convictions. Zilk also signed a declaration of loyalty 
to the Czech communist government, the source claimed. Ivan Medek, 
a Czech government official, did not identify the source but told 
the newspaper that the information on Zilk was ``absolutely reliable.'' 
Zilk would have received the Czech medal next Wednesday.
