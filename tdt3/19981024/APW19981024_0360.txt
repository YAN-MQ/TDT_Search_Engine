Putting the clamor of campaigning behind them, voters in Spain's Basque 
region spent an official ``day of reflection'' Saturday ahead of a 
regional election seen as crucial for starting a peace process to 
end 30 years of separatist strife. The armed separatist group ETA, 
which set the tone for the campaign five weeks ago by declaring a 
cease-fire in its drive for an independent homeland, was set to grab 
the limelight again on the eve of the voting. Several of its members 
were expected to appear in a taped program broadcast by Britain's 
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to discuss the ceasefire. Spanish 
newspapers said one of the members was also to discuss a ``political 
scenario'' in which the group might consider laying down its arms 
for good. The papers said the interview was taped a month ago, shortly 
after the cease-fire took effect on Sept. 18. ETA has called cease-fires 
before but they were all of limited duration. This is the first open-ended 
one and many Spaniards see it as the best opportunity in years to 
end one of Western Europe's last regional conflicts. Prime Minister 
Jose Maria Aznar traveled to the Basque country Friday night with 
a delegation of six Cabinet ministers in a last-minute push for candidates 
of his center-right Popular Party seeking seats in the 75-member Basque 
parliament here in Vitoria. Speaking at a rally in Vitoria, Aznar 
warned against what he called the ``adventures'' of some Basque nationalists 
seeking independence from Spain. ``No adventures in the Basque country,'' 
he said. ``There will be none. This land will not see adventures that 
take it nowhere.'' Aznar also repeated his call for ETA to publicly 
accept the results of the elections and lay down its arms. The premier 
has said ETA must meet these conditions for a peace process to begin 
in earnest. ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque 
Homeland and Freedom, is blamed for killing nearly 800 people since 
1968. So far the government has shied from reacting generously to 
the cease-fire. It has moved four of the some 500 ETA prisoners to 
jails in the Basque country in a token gesture to a long-standing 
demand of the separatist group. Aznar hopes a strong showing by the 
Popular Party and other non-nationalist groups, like the opposition 
Socialists, will give him greater leverage against nationalists in 
the Basque region as he seeks a lasting settlement to the separatist 
problem. The region's biggest party is the mainstream Basque Nationalist 
Party, which is expected to again finish first in the voting but fall 
short of a majority and thus have to seek coalition allies. The big 
question mark is whether the ETA ceasefire will translate into greater 
support for the Basque Nationalist Party and ETA's political wing, 
Herri Batasuna. The two held months of talks this year that led to 
the truce, and they are hoping to reap dividends at the polls. ``We 
will be the big surprise on election day,'' said one of Herri Batasuna's 
candidates, Jone Goirizelaia. The Basque Nationalist Party says it 
shares ETA's goal of independence but opposes violence as the way 
to achieve it. Instead, it wants to work through Spain's existing 
institutions to secede gently.
