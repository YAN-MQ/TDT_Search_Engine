A fresh proposal by France's Canal Plus SA has reopened dialogue with 
RAI, Italian state TV, over how to share a digital TV platform, the 
Italian news agency ANSA reported Saturday. Efforts have been going 
on for some time to reach an accord among parties vying for a stake 
in Telecom Italia SpA's digital platform Stream. Earlier this month, 
the Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported that agreement 
had come on the size of the stakes. It said Rupert Murdoch's British 
Sky Broadcasting Group PLC would accept a 20 percent stake in Stream, 
considerably lower than his first request for a 40 percent stake and 
that Canal Plus, which controls existing Italian digital provider 
Telepiu, would get a 15 percent stake which may later be turned over 
to Murdoch. RAI was expected to get a 14 percent stake, with Telecom 
retaining a 51 percent of pay-TV unit Stream. Telecom now owns 100 
percent. It was not clear if a power shuffle Friday at Telecom would 
affect the digital platform proposals, and there was no immediate 
reaction from RAI over the latest move by Canal Plus. Details of the 
reported fresh proposal were not immediately given.
