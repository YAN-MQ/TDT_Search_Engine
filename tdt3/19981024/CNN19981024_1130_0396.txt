tuesday's the deadline for yugoslavia to meet all its promises on 
kosovo or risk nato air strikes. based on what it's seen, the western 
alliance thinks it's time for a stern warning. nato's top two generals 
are heading to belgrade to deliver the message that the serbs had 
better step up troop withdrawals from kosovo. nato official says there's 
been progress but nothing close to adequate compliance. scattered 
trouble continues in kosovo, but the serbs insist it's not their fault. 
they say they've fully complied with their end of the bargain, and 
blame ethnic albanian rebels for the latest violence. later today, 
the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution endorsing 
the kosovo peace accord and nato's enforcement of it. china and russia 
oppose the use of force and could veto it.
