Among the heroes Friday, Cuban born Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez. 
It's a road-to-success story worthy of Hollywood. Susan Candiotti 
reports. Perched on a float with some of his teammates, Orlando El 
duque hernandez is riding high, professionally and personally. It's 
like a dream come true. This is an American story. And what a story 
it is. In Cuba, he was a star, idolized, where he earned his nickname 
"the Duke." Then, the fall from grace. After his younger half-brother 
Livan made it off the island and signed with the Florida Marlins, 
El duque was banned from baseball. Earning less than $9 a month as 
a physical therapist, El duque watched his brother named MVP in last 
years world series. I love you Miami. Then, it was El duque's turn 
at the big leagues. Ten months ago, he defected, leaving behind his 
home, his mother, his two daughters. After signing a four-year, $6.6 
million contract, he won over Yankee fans with a 12-4 record in the 
regular season and two post season wins, including game two of the 
series. Hours before the victory parade, the icing on the cake, Cuba 
and the U.S. cleared the way for a tearful reunion with his mother, 
two daughters and ex-wife -- a six-month visa that might wind up keeping 
them here for good. I -- I no speak English. Maybe not yet. But he 
told fans in Spanish that he's proud to be a Yankee. They're just 
as proud. I came on around four-year ago. I came on raft, on boat, 
like him, like he did. But we made it you know. I'm here, I'm free, 
and El duque is free, too, you know? There's talk of a Hollywood movie 
about El duque's life, possibly starring Cuba Gooding Jr. you've got 
to admit, pitching his way to a world series ring in his first try 
out, it could make one heck of a happy ending. Susan Candiotti, CNN, 
New York.
