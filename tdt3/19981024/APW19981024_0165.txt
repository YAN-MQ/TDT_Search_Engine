After signing the West Bank land-for-peace deal, Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat arrived in the Austrian capital on Saturday to brief 
European Union leaders on the historic agreement. Arafat met Austrian 
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel at a downtown hotel and travels 
later to the Alpine resort of Poertschach to brief European Union 
leaders, gathered for an informal summit. Arafat and Schuessel are 
expected to arrive in Poertschach in the middle of the afternoon. 
Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency. EU members have 
supported the Palestinians during many of their disputes with the 
Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, including 
Israel's decision to build Jewish housing in areas of Jerusalem which 
the Palestinians want as a future capital. The United States vetoed 
two of European-backed resolutions in the U.N. Security Council which 
would have called on Israel to abandon the housing project. Quoting 
Austrian foreign ministry officials, the Austria Press Agency said 
Schuessel and Arafat would also discuss increased EU financial help 
for the Palestinian Authority. The EU accounts for about 60 percent 
of the financial assistance which the Palestinians receive. The Europeans 
are also anxious to play a role in the protracted Middle East peace 
process, which has been long dominated by the United States. Joining 
in the talks between Schuessel and Arafat were the EU's special Middle 
East envoy, EU, Miguel Angel Moratinos, and Austrian foreign ministry 
state secretary, Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
