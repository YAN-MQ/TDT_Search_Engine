Paramilitary police arrested a suspected Italian mobster Saturday 
in his mountain hideout for the 1993 slaying in Belgium of his former 
wife, her companion and parents. Belgium police had been seeking Rocco 
Chindamo, 39, for allegedly killing the four in Arlon because he was 
jealous of his ex-wife's new companion, the Italian news agency ANSA 
quoted investigators in the southern region of Calabria as saying. 
The four victims were identified as Martine Heitz, 30; her parents 
Achille, 61, and Germaine Heitz, 53, and companion Christian Mauguit, 
39, the AGI news agency reported. When carabinieri officers closed 
in on Chindamo and another alleged mobster of the 'ndrangheta crime 
syndicate, Luciano Ferrentino, Chindamo's 23-year-old nephew, Chindamo 
tried to fly, but stopped when police pointed a gun at him, ANSA reported. 
Confiscated in the hidout in the remote Aspromonte mountains in the 
``toe'' of the Italian boot-shaped peninsula were a rifle, two pistols 
and a hand grenade, news reports said. The 'ndrangheta, Calabria's 
approximate cousin to the Sicilian Mafia, makes it money in drug and 
arms trafficking, extortion and kidnapping victims who are sometimes 
held for ransom in the mountain hideouts.
