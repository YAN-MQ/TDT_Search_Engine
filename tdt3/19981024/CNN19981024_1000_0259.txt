About 250 people gathered across from the White House last night to 
call for the payment of back dues the United States owes the United 
Nations. President Clinton last week vetoed legislation that would 
have provided nearly $1 billion for the back payments. He said he 
killed the Bill because it included an unrelated anti-abortion measure. 
The administration has plans to make dues payments necessary to maintain 
general assembly voting rights.
