All right, baseball fans, get used to Sai seeing this -- Mike Piazza 
agreed to a seven-year, $91 million deal, the richest deal in baseball 
history. The megacontract is expected to be announced by the Mets 
Monday. This past season, Piazza hit 329 with 32 long balls and 111 
RBIs with the dodgers, Marlins and Mets. The signing most likely means 
Todd hundley's days with the Mets are numbered.
