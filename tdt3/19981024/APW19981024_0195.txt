China on Saturday called on Israel and the Palestinians to implement 
faithfully the agreement they reached with U.S. help so as to push 
forward the Mideast peace process. Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang 
Guoqiang welcomed Israel's decision to withdraw from more of the West 
Bank and praised the U.S. role in securing the agreement. ``We appreciate 
efforts made to this end by the United States and other parties concerned,'' 
Tang said in a statement carried by the official Xinhua News Agency. 
Tang urged Israel to sit down with Syria and Lebanon as soon as possible 
to achieve a comprehensive, regionwide peace. A champion of the Palestinian 
cause for since its more radical policies of the 1950s, China has 
also developed strong business ties and warming diplomatic ones with 
Israel over the past decade.
