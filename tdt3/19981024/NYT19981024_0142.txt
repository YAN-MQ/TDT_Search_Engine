Things _ little things like life in general, his job and his mental 
health _ are going much better for Chris Horner, thank you. He was 
down a lot last year in his first season as an American bicycle racer 
trying to succeed in Europe, and he has been down a lot this year 
too, but now it's a laughing matter. Last year, the problem was emotional: 
the loneliness of being a rider far from home in a country where he 
had few friends and didn't speak the language. He was often distraught. 
``Can't get much lower,'' he said at one point, telling friends in 
the United States that he sometimes felt on the verge of a collapse. 
This year the problem was physical: When Horner says with a smile 
that he has been down, he means it literally. ``I've been crashing 
a lot,'' he said before he finished his season with the final World 
Cup race, the Tour of Lombardy, on Oct. 11 and headed home to California. 
``Got a few results here and there, but I've mainly been on the tarmac.'' 
``It's not my fault,'' he protested with a laugh. ``Just bad luck. 
I had only one crash where I had any control over it, on a descent 
where I was alone. I went too fast and went off the road. All the 
other crashes have been in the field; 20 guys go down and if you're 
in it, you go down. ``Too bad about those crashes. This year I'd train 
really good, then crash and lose everything, start from zero, come 
back up again, crash, lose it again, bring it back up, crash, lose 
it again. You feel terrible. I was hoping to make our Tour de France 
team, but when I crashed in the Midi Libre I broke my right wrist.'' 
In most of the crashes, he added, he had been at or near the front 
of the race. That is a sign of how far Horner, who turned 28 on Friday, 
has come since he left the Nutra Fig team in the United States and 
joined La Francaise des Jeux, a French team with big riders and a 
big $5 million budget, in 1997. During his first season, Horner was 
rarely at the front, where aggressive riders are found. He seemed 
overwhelmed, perhaps intimidated. Unlike most Americans who ride in 
Europe, he was not on a team like 7-Eleven, Motorola or U.S. Postal 
Service, surrounded by a culture he had grown up in. Nor had his team 
signed another American to room with him, as happened with Cofidis 
and Mapei. Horner was alone, and it was small comfort to know that 
when Greg LeMond started his career in France in the early 1980s, 
he nearly cracked too. ``It's been a hard year in Europe,'' Horner 
said when the 1997 season had still not reached its midpoint. ``Being 
an American going to Europe, there's nothing you can really do to 
make it easy. You just have to adapt. It just takes time. You've got 
to adapt, got to.'' So this year he adapted. First, he moved from 
an apartment near Paris next door to an assistant directeur sportif, 
choosing instead the sunnier climes of Nice. That sun makes people 
much friendlier, he reported. Then he brought over his companion and 
their year-old daughter for the year. ``It was necessary to live with 
my directeur and his family last year,'' Horner said. ``There was 
no way I could have moved down to Nice and got the electricity turned 
on and the phone going. Now my French is better and I can handle things. 
My French is definitely not spectacular, but it's doable now. And 
having the family here has been great.'' ``Last year was really hard,'' 
Horner said, ``but this year it's much better.'' So much better, in 
fact, that La Francaise des Jeux has signed him to a new contract 
for next year. His teammates and officials consider him a strong team 
rider and a generous worker. ``I've picked up some more about bike 
racing,'' Horner said, ``some more about courses and just about the 
team in general, how the team's working and the riders. ``Bike racing 
is hard. The important thing is to learn the courses, how much energy 
to use and when to use it, which riders are the ones to watch. ``When 
you first come over here, you look at all the riders as being top 
riders. A lot of riders, you know their names, but you don't actually 
know by sight. As the years go by, you learn what they look like, 
which is a big help when somebody is going up the road or you wonder 
who's with you in a break and decide tactics accordingly.'' By now, 
Horner said, he has pretty much learned how to ride and live in Europe. 
After time off in southern California, he will start training for 
the new season. Next year, he predicted, no crashes. Next year, smooth 
sailing.
