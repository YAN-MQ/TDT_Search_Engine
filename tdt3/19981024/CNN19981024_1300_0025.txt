Governments around the world are praising an interim peace agreement 
signed in Maryland yesterday by Israeli and Palestinian leaders. But 
many issues still must be resolved, and some are urging caution. In 
the West Bank, Palestinian residents are receiving the deal with a 
mix of skepticism and indifference. The main Palestinian newspaper 
says the deal shows Israeli prime minister benjamin Netanyahu is finally 
accepting Palestinian political aspirations. Other Arab newspapers 
say the pact is unfair to Palestinians, or might not be implemented. 
Some Israelis say they're concerned opposition to the deal from hard-line 
settlers could bring down Netanyahu's government. Many Arab diplomats 
say U.S. support is essential to the success of the peace process. 
But some Israelis say too much meddling could ruin negotiations. The 
American involvement, as a result of this agreement, is very, maybe 
the deepest since the beginning of the peace process. You know we 
did not want to involve the Americans so much is the bilateral relations 
between us and the Palestinians because we believed very much in the 
bilateral relations between us and them. And the trust which might 
be there as a result of these intimate relations. When the Americans 
are involved, it creates a potential problem for them and for us.
