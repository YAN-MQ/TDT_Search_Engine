For the second straight game, late in the third period, the Islanders' 
fate lay on the stick of Claude Lapointe. This time, he came through. 
With 40 seconds left in Saturday night's game against the Buffalo 
Sabres, Lapointe picked off a clearing pass, skated in alone on Dominik 
Hasek and scored his second goal of the game to give the Islanders 
a 5-4 victory before 11,081 fans at Nassau Coliseum. Lapointe had 
used the same backhand move on a penalty shot against Rangers goalie 
Mike Richter last Thursday, but was thwarted in the Islanders' 3-2 
loss. ``Against Hasek, you don't think, you just react,'' Lapointe 
said. ``I beat Hasek on a breakaway before.'' Lapointe did more than 
win the game for the Islanders Saturday night; he saved them from 
further embarrassment. The Islanders had taken a 4-0 lead early in 
the second period, but they relaxed, their tempo slowed, and their 
defense got lazy. An opportunistic Buffalo team took full advantage, 
scoring four straight goals to tie the game at 4-4. ``It couldn't 
have happened to a better guy,'' Coach Mike Milbury said of Lapointe. 
``He seems to be in on a half-dozen scoring chances every night.'' 
The Islanders, notorious for their slow starts, wasted no time Saturday 
night in taking a 2-0 first-period lead on goals by Gino Odjick and 
Lapointe. Odjick's goal came on the power play at 2 minutes 54 seconds. 
Odjick, who left the game later in the period with a groin strain, 
hit the puck off of Hasek's stick and through the goalie's leg pads. 
Lapointe scored at 14:31 on a rebound. One Islander did not need a 
packed Coliseum to get ready to play Saturday night. Jason Dawe, who 
scored the Islanders' third goal, circled this date several months 
ago. He was traded to the Islanders by the Sabres last March for Paul 
Kruse and a minor league defenseman. Dawe demanded a trade when his 
playing time diminished. ``I'm pumped,'' he said before the game. 
``I've been waiting since last season to play them.'' Dawe, who went 
back to Buffalo during the off season to sell his home there, is still 
close friends with Michael Peca, the Sabres' captain, and Brian Holzinger. 
Before Saturday night's game, Dawe said several teammates asked for 
advice on how to score on Hasek, who is widely regarded as the world's 
best goalie. ``I can't even tell the guys where to shoot on him,'' 
he said. ``Nothing works on him.'' But Dawe beat Hasek with a slap 
shot from the top of the left circle when Hasek was caught leaning 
the wrong way on the 2-on-1 break with Dawe and Mariusz Czerkawski. 
Bryan Smolinski scored the Islanders' fourth goal on a breakaway at 
14:28 of the second period. It was Smolinski's first goal since April 
6. But soon after Smolinski's goal, things began unraveling for the 
Islanders. Curtis Brown scored on a Sabres power play, cutting the 
deficit to 4-1 at 18:27 of the second period. Then, with less with 
17 seconds left in the period, Wayne Primeau scored Buffalo's second 
goal. Dixon Ward knocked in a rebound at 5:57 of the third period, 
and Holzinger capped the comeback at 6:33. ``There are some things 
to be learned,'' said Milbury, who told the team before the game that 
a victory meant a day off on Monday. ``We won the game despite some 
egregious errors.''
