The gridlock reports on the car radio sounded dire Friday morning 
as the city prepared to heap praise and confetti on the Yankees. The 
Brooklyn Bridge was closed down for a while; the Manhattan Bridge 
was clogged, and traffic was backed up. Forget about the sidewalks 
along the Canyon of Heroes where fans were packed in, including children 
whose hooky party was winked at by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani when he 
said he learned as much playing baseball as he did in school. In contrast, 
it was an easy ride to points north. It took 20 traffic-free minutes 
to drive from midtown to the Bronx home of Ramon and Iris Baez. Sports 
taught them a lot about life, too. Their son, Anthony, was tossing 
a football outside their house in December 1994 when it struck the 
patrol car of Police Officer Francis Livoti. In the ensuing dispute, 
Livoti used an illegal choke hold that killed Anthony. After a state 
trial that found him not guilty, ex-Officer Livoti was convicted of 
civil rights violations in a federal court and sentenced to seven 
and a half years in prison. The city also settled the Baez family's 
wrongful-death lawsuit for nearly $3 million. The whole ordeal was 
enough to make the Baezes advocates for other families like themselves. 
That's why they helped the October 22 Coalition organize Thursday 
night's march and rally against police brutality that went from Union 
Square Park to City Hall. They are still learning about life through 
sports. While the mayor had no problem with Yankee gridlock, city 
officials cited traffic concerns when they denied the coalition a 
permit to march down one lane of Broadway. A federal court ruled for 
the rally's organizers. As usual, the city appealed. As is quite usual, 
the city lost. In the end, 1,000 people went to the rally, which was 
peaceful, with limited traffic delays. Want a Yankee parade? No problem. 
Want to put signs outside courthouses to mark legal victories for 
the poor and dispossessed? Problem. Considering how police shut down 
Amsterdam Avenue to let hundreds of Yankee fans spontaneously celebrate 
Wednesday night, one wonders if what's really being blocked are the 
First Amendment rights of the mayor's critics. ``Anything against 
the mayor, he says no,'' Mrs. Baez said. ``He has gotten to the point 
where he thinks he can rule everybody. Even some people in City Hall 
complain it's being run like the military. There's no freedom of speech 
and everybody is walking around on eggshells. Don't crack the eggs 
and everything goes smooth.'' Mrs. Baez has copies of Parks Department 
permits that allowed the coalition to use city parks for the rally. 
She thought the police permit to march in the street would be a cinch. 
It was not. In fact, city officials waited weeks before informing 
the group that their request was denied and that marchers would have 
to stay on the sidewalks. A federal judge called that delay ``unconscionable,'' 
and suggested that the city's only motive was to squelch unpopular 
speech. Without any apparent irony, the mayor lambasted the ``imperial 
federal court'' and judges who ``think they were put here by God.'' 
Don't the commoners know that only mayors rule by divine right? ``When 
he wants something, that's what he wants,'' Mrs. Baez said. ``It's 
disturbing. `Something I don't want can't go forward. Something I 
didn't set up can't proceed.' It's always `I,' and the `I' is what's 
going to bring him down.'' Not that she's against lauding the Yankees. 
She only wants to put it all in perspective. ``The Yankees are good 
for the city,'' she said. ``They erase the bad. But tomorrow, we have 
to come back to reality.'' The Baezes have established a foundation 
to help other families. They make speeches and hand out fliers encouraging 
others to come forward and report any complaints they have about police 
abuses. They get about a call a day from people seeking advice. They 
say they'll continue to take to the street, peacefully. ``We have 
to be the voice of the dead,'' Mrs. Baez said. ``All we can do is 
march and raise our voices.'' But there is one street they go to just 
for fun and without a permit. It's the one outside their house. ``The 
kids love to play football,'' Baez said. ``They love the game. They're 
never going to stop playing. Our street. And if we have to block it, 
we'll block it.''
