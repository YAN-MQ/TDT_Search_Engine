Rush Holt, the Democratic challenger in central New Jersey's 12th 
Congressional District, was at a union dinner here when Beverly Dey, 
a Ewing Township secretary, asked why the age when she would be eligible 
for Social Security had risen to 66 from 65. She thought that was 
unfair. After Holt replied that he would protect Social Security, 
Ms. Dey was asked whether his answer had won her over. ``He answered 
part of my question,'' she said, ``but I want to hear his opponent 
first before I make up my mind.'' His opponent is the incumbent, Michael 
Pappas, a Republican from Rocky Hill, and that Ms. Dey did not say 
``Mike'' or ``Mr. Pappas'' to refer to the first-term congressman 
_ the way New Jerseyans say ``Christie'' when they mean their governor, 
Christie Todd Whitman _ could be taken to support the Democrat's hope 
that Pappas is not yet known so well that he is unbeatable. The district 
was drawn up to be a Republican stronghold, and even Holt concedes 
that he has an uphill fight. Without a strong turnout he will lose, 
the Democrat from Pennington tells his audiences. The 12th District 
stretches from the Delaware River at the west to the Raritan Bay at 
the east, takes in nearly 60 towns and boroughs in five counties but 
no cities, and includes the university town of Princeton, the older 
Trenton suburbs of Lawrence and Ewing, the sheltered farms and villages 
of Hunterdon County and the retirement communities that are springing 
up out of the flat coastal plain toward the shore. ``It's a terrible 
district in which to campaign in,'' said Thomas Hartmann, a retired 
Rutgers University political science professor. ``It's just spread 
all over the place.'' The 12th is also New Jersey's most populous 
and fastest-growing district, and ranks first in proportion of residents 
with college degrees, first in high school standardized test scores 
and second in per-capita income. More than 60 percent of its voters 
are registered as independent, and the two major parties split the 
remainder. In 1996, 75 percent of the district's registered voters 
went to the polls. Pappas, 38, carried the 12th in 1996 when the seat 
was vacant by 10,000 votes, less than 1 percent of the total, and 
he did it in part by turning out his core supporters in the segments 
of the party opposed to abortion rights and gun control. The Democrats 
went into this year's campaign hoping that Pappas would be vulnerable 
to being painted as too conservative for the district. But the congressman 
has spent this campaign focusing on his arguments for lower and fairer 
taxes and avoiding the more hard-edged social issues that helped him 
win the first time. At the annual dinner of the Delaware Township 
Republican Club in Hunterdon County on Thursday evening, for example, 
Pappas was asked whether his stands on abortion or gun control ever 
came up during this campaign. ``Only when someone from the media asks 
about them,'' he said. ``The central issue of my campaign two years 
ago was and continues to be balancing the federal budget and reducing 
the tax burden on people such as yourselves,'' Pappas told his friendly 
audience of Republicans. ``Now we're on the right track toward reforming 
the tax code, and making it simpler as well.'' Where Pappas focuses 
on only a few issues _ he also backs preserving open space, a goal 
that also protects property values _ Holt offers his audiences a menu 
of ideas, including gun control, preserving Social Security and the 
environment, and abortion rights. But in the last few weeks he has 
particularly emphasized improving education and defending patients' 
rights against health maintenance organizations; the latter point 
brought a murmur of approval from residents of a retirement village 
in Monroe Township last week. Holt, 50, often closes with an unusual 
concession in his appeal for supporters to turn out on Nov. 3. ``With 
all this effort, with all the campaigning and the media, we are poised 
to have a narrow loss _ a narrow loss,'' he said. ``The difference 
between a narrow loss and a narrow win is you.'' Pappas, who first 
ran for elective office when he was in his early 20s, delivers his 
speeches with a matter-of-fact routine, while Holt, a former assistant 
director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and a former physics 
professor, still tends to pause and hunt for thoughts before crowds. 
``He's good,'' said Jim Schroeder, a Holt supporter and a lobbyist 
for the New Jersey Education Association, the teachers' union. ``If 
anything, he's a little green, but people like that _ it's fresh.'' 
David Rebovich, a political scientist at Rider University, sees it 
a little differently: ``I think Holt is trying hard to translate his 
academic, professorial self into a more populist candidate, but he 
needs a little more time on the campaign trail to hone his arguments 
and to generate more enthusiasm as a plausible political leader.'' 
In one regard Holt is entirely a professional at politics: he has 
raised about $600,000, nearly as much as Pappas, by tirelessly calling 
supporters and urging them to be willing to spend as much to support 
their values as Republicans. Much of Holt's money has now, in the 
last two weeks of the campaign, gone into a sardonic radio and television 
campaign in which Pappas himself is a star: they include a memorable 
moment when the congressman took the floor of the House last summer 
to deliver a ditty of praise for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, 
to the tune of ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.'' ``Twinkle, twinkle, 
Kenneth Starr,'' Pappas recites, ``now we see how brave you are.'' 
The congressman has called the Holt commercials negative. ``It's good 
_ it definitely throws Pappas on the defensive in the sense of asking 
him what he does with his time down there,'' said Ross K. Baker, a 
political scientist at Rutgers. But since Pappas is running on noncontroversial 
themes and no overarching issue is stirring the voters, who are increasingly 
concerned about economic instability, Baker thinks Pappas has the 
edge. ``Mr. Holt has put up a very spirited and aggressive campaign,'' 
he said, ``but the fact is that Mr. Pappas was elected in 1996 and 
not much has changed since then to make people throw him out. And 
with the economic problems, the electorate seems to be as nervous 
as a Christmas goose, so I think this is a good year to bet on the 
incumbent.''
