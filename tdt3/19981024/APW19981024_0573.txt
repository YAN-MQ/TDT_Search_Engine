Three days ahead of its deadline for Slobodan Milosevic to comply 
with Western demands, NATO was sending two top generals to Belgrade 
on Saturday to demand more Kosovo withdrawals by the Yugoslav president. 
The Serbian-led Yugoslav government insists that it is abiding by 
terms of the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis and blames continued, 
scattered clashes on ethnic Albanian rebels. In a statement published 
Saturday in Kosovo's Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore, the rebels 
said they would take no ``offensive action'' against government forces 
which are leaving the province under terms of the agreement. ``But 
any movement towards (Albanian-populated) villages or our positions 
will force us to self-defend ourselves,'' the rebels said. Gen. Wesley 
Clark, the alliance's supreme military commander, and German Gen. 
Klaus Naumann were expected in Belgrade on Saturday afternoon to seek 
more pullbacks of police units and equipment from the separatist province. 
NATO has given Milosevic until Tuesday to remove the special police 
and military units he sent to Kosovo during his crackdown on ethnic 
Albanian militants, who demand independence for the majority Albanian 
province. NATO likely will set up a base for its air surveillance 
mission over Kosovo near the Macedonian capital of Skopje, Macedonian 
defense minister Lazar Kitanoski said Friday. With Western nations 
only beginning to organize a 2,000-strong group of unarmed monitors 
to verify Yugoslavia's actions in Kosovo, the deadline is widely expected 
to be pushed back for a second time. But no official action by NATO 
is expected until Monday. A NATO official, briefing reporters in Brussels, 
Belgium, on condition of anonymity, said Friday that ``we have seen 
great progress but we are far from adequate compliance.'' Serbian 
Premier Mirko Marjanovic said it was time the West realized that the 
crisis in Kosovo was caused by ``terrorism of Albanian separatists.'' 
While fighting in Kosovo effectively halted in late September, there 
is sporadic gunfire and almost nightly shelling in different locations 
_ evidence the conflict has not ended. Under the agreement, Milosevic 
pledged to withdraw special police and army units sent to the province 
after he launched his crackdown on the KLA Feb. 28. Hundreds of people 
have been killed and an estimated 300,000 driven from their homes. 
Milosevic also agreed to let refugees return home safely and enable 
international relief agencies to bring them aid. He also pledged to 
negotiate with ethnic Albanian leaders on the future of Kosovo, a 
province of the main Yugoslav republic Serbia. Early Saturday, five 
refugees from Prizren in southern Kosovo were seriously wounded when 
Yugoslav border guards opened fire on them while they were crossing 
into neighboring Albania, the Albanian Interior Ministry reported. 
The five _ two old men, two children and a woman _ were airlifted 
from the Albanian border village of Pogaj to Tirana Military Hospital, 
said Aratan Bizhga, Interior Ministry spokesman. Ethnic Albanians,
