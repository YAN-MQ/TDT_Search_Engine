New information has been released on the death of princess Diana. 
Sources say tests on the Mercedes that the princess was riding in 
show the car wasn't going as fast as first thought. Investigators 
say driver Henri Paul was only going about 62 miles per hour. They 
say contrary to reported testimony, the car had no problems with its 
brakes and it did brush against a Fiat uno before the wreck. Princess 
Diana, Dodi Fayed and Henri Paul all died in the crash last year.
