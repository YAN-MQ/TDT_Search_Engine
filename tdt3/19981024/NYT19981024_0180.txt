During a pro-am regatta last year in the British Virgin Islands, Russell 
Coutts pulled up to the dock in his 30-foot race boat and waved everybody 
on board. Ten guests clambered onto the sloop, much to the chagrin 
of the regatta chairman, who was organizing crews of five. ``I don't 
care,'' Coutts, the New Zealand America's Cup skipper, said at the 
time. ``This is what I want to do.'' The carefree attitude about racing 
contrasted sharply with the intensity that precedes most professional 
races. But each year at this time, the Bitter End Yacht Club of Virgin 
Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, tweaks the fun side of the sport 
by inviting elite skippers to sail with amateurs. ``These pro skippers 
really don't get to see their adoring public,'' John Glynn, the race 
chairman, said in a telephone interview last week. ``I never realized 
before that there are sailing groupies out there who never get to 
see the experts except on shore during an America's Cup campaign. 
In the pro-am, they're on the same boat together.'' The event this 
year, the seven-day Iridium Pro-Am Regatta, is scheduled to begin 
Saturday with eight world-class skippers expected. They include Coutts; 
Harold Cudmore of England; Paul Cayard, J.J. and Peter Isler, Morgan 
Larson and Ken Read of the United States; and Paula Lewin of Bermuda. 
The Islers, accomplished America's Cup sailors in their own right, 
like the interaction. ``It's like a Magic Johnson dream camp, except 
that it's a dream camp for sailors,'' Peter Isler said recently. The 
amateurs are in heaven. ``It's racing with the stars,'' Linda Coleman, 
a small-boat sailor from St. Louis, said enthusiastically. ``We're 
always changing boats when we race, and the skipper tells us what 
to do. People try their best, and if they can't do it, they usually 
get off the boat.'' The Islers have competed in the series about nine 
times in its 11-year history. The Bitter End, which is more of a hotel 
than a traditional yacht club, offers its celebrity skippers free 
accommodations. Guests pay as much as $3,710 for a seven-night stay 
with food and access to 100 yacht-club watercraft. ``We all eat breakfast, 
lunch and dinner together,'' Peter Isler said, ``spend afternoons 
on the water racing, have unlimited use of sailboards and catamarans, 
then have drinks on the beach at night.'' While it may sound idyllic, 
each skipper must bring along a measure of patience. There have been 
times when a guest just plain got tired in the middle of a sailboat 
tacking maneuver. It doesn't happen often, but it's quite a sight 
for a professional skipper to watch a crew member decide to plunk 
down in the center of the boat during the heat of racing. Isler said 
he doesn't really mind. ``It's their event,'' he added. ``If things 
get too windy or intense, you have to make sure your crew doesn't 
get hurt. They can get more than their share of bumped noggins, rope 
burns on their hands from not having enough wraps on the winch, or 
even a black eye.'' More times than not, guests who sign up for the 
pro-am regatta have sailing experience, Glynn said. Chuck McNeil, 
a retired commercial airline pilot from Palm Desert, Calif., figures 
he has sailed in the event about seven times. He and his wife, Janet, 
see the trip as a vacation, but one with lasting benefits. The couple 
has made friends over the years with Coutts, and with Ed Baird, skipper 
for the New York Yacht Club's 1999-2000 America's Cup campaign. When 
Baird and Coutts were in San Diego for cup racing in 1995, Chuck McNeil 
played golf with the two helmsmen. But he has also picked up a racing 
tip or two for the sailing he does on his own Morgan 45 yacht. ``Ed 
usually says East Coast sailors are smart sailors, but West Coast 
sailors are fast sailors,'' McNeil said last week. ``But I've learned 
from both of them how to watch out for a breeze, and how to stay on 
the right side of the course. Most people don't get that from regular 
racing.'' Laura and John Wells, of Aliso Viejo, Calif., may not be 
able to make it to the pro-am event this year, for the first time 
in 11 years. The couple owns an airplane fire-fighting business in 
Southern California, and can't get away this season. ``It's intense 
racing,'' Linda Wells said wistfully. ``You don't just sit there and 
watch. You handle the jib sheets, the main sheet, and you are absolutely 
sailing.''
