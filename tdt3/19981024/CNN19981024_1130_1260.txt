well, terry bowden's official announcement came on friday. he resigned 
as the team struggled with a 1-5 record. it didn't seem to be anything 
more than -- than a point in time which i could do nothing, but continue 
to make it difficult for these young men to have the type of positive 
experience they came to auburn for, and so that's disappointing, and 
a little shocking, but, again, it's the nature of this business. bill 
oliver takes over today as they play louisiana tech. this morning, 
the ath let ek director says that bowden will be a positive part of 
the athletic program. this is a sad, shocking day. something none 
of us anticipated expected, or desired to see happen. this was coach 
bowden's decision. it was his decision to take this step. and the 
timing of it. was his decision.
