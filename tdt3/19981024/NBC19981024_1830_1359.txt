And Buoyed by America's mood, President Clinton is on the campaign 
trail in california tonight. NBC's John Palmer is traveling with him. 
This is Mr. Clinton's 42nd visit to California since taking office 
-- a state he won easily in both of his presidential races. Now he 
hopes his continued high job approval rating in the state can boost 
fellow democrats. Lieutenant governor Gray Davis, struggling in the 
race for governor against california attorney general Dan Lungren 
and incumbent senator Barbara boxer, trying to hold off a challenge 
from republican state treasurer Matt fong. Vice President Gore was 
also in California this week his ninth visit to the state since January, 
campaigning not only for local democrats but for himself in the presidential 
primary less than two years away. And California, the most populous 
state will have a bigger role than usual in choosing national leaders. 
Last month, governor Pete Wilson signed legislation moving the California 
primary election from June to early March. It means California joins 
New York and at least four other states with presidential primaries 
on the same early date. But there's a hitch -- the California presidential 
primary is an open primary where voters are free to cross party lines 
and choose delegates to the other party's convention. To deal with 
that problem, proposition 3 was put on the November ballot. It would 
close the primaries making them strictly partisan again. Leaders of 
both major parties endorse prop 3. People of their own party ought 
to vote within their own primaries to select their leaders and their 
candidates. The presidential primary for both republicans and democrats 
will become a Beauty contest. There is opposition but most voters 
don't know what prop 3 is. I have no clue at all whatsoever. I know 
there is something about Indian tribes. I know there something about 
tobacco. Party leaders concede with most of their effort and money 
directed at electing candidates little attention has been given to 
rallying support for prop 3. John Palmer, NBC news, traveling with 
the president in california.
