Animal rights activists in south Africa are coming to the rescue of 
30 young elephants who were captured in Botswana last year. They say 
the animals have been mistreated and abused. Mike Hanna reports. a 
few months ago, these young elephants were roaming with their mothers 
in the wild. Now, they are the subjects of a court action brought 
by a south African animal welfare group, alleging they are being treated 
with cruelty. These elephants have not only been brutally beaten, 
but they've been psychologically traumatized as well. The court action 
is against a south African game dealer named ricardo giazza, who bought 
the elephants. He declines to comment. The issue here goes beyond 
the immediate fate of these animals. The case raises as yet unanswered 
questions about the international trade in wildlife. Should it be 
allowed? And if so, how can it be controlled? The elephants were captured 
in the wilds of Botswana, with the permission of a government deeply 
concerned about a swelling population of the animals. The cost to 
the present owner $2,000 a head. Randall Moore, who himself runs an 
elephant safari operation in that country, says after being trained, 
each will be sold for as much as $30,000. This is all about profit. 
And it's all about getting these animals in and out as quickly as 
they can, and then going back and getting some more. Wildlife experts 
from around the world have come to this small farm, seeing in the 
court action a test case that will help focus attention on the loopholes 
in the convention for trade in endangered species, or c.T.I.E.S., 
drawn up to protect animals like the elephant. And it's unfortunate 
that only when this kind of situation erupts that people focus on 
these loopholes and start to think what can we do to avoid these kinds 
of situations in the future. You know, the people that draw up these 
conventions don't always know a lot about animals. This is a slave 
trade with animals. We were doing this to humans 100 years ago, thank 
God that stopped. And this needs to be stopped, too. If I was a baby 
elephant and I had to go here, I would say, "shoot me with my family, 
because I don't want this type of life." a decision in this case is 
expected within the next few days. Mike Hanna, CNN, brits, south Africa.
