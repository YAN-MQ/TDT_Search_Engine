Keith Byars, who has been there with the Eagles, the Dolphins and 
the Patriots, was trying to explain to the Jets what this winning 
thing is all about. Welcome to the club, Keith. Even Byars' coach, 
Bill Parcells, does not know what he has with this team. The Jets 
are 3-3, they face a strong Atlanta Falcons team Sunday at the Meadowlands 
_ and no one knows what to expect. After all, the Jets have defeated 
the Patriots and the Dolphins, who at 4-2 are tied for first place 
in the American Football Conference East, but lost to the Rams and 
the Ravens, two teams at, or near, the bottom of their divisions. 
So, the question remains: What kind of team is this? ``You have to 
set the trend sometime,'' said Byars, the heady fullback who has been 
in the National Football League for 13 seasons. ``I've been telling 
some of the guys I had the same thing at New England. Three-and-three. 
Then we won eight of the next 10 games and go 11-5 and wind up in 
the Super Bowl. And which way do we go now? We didn't win eight of 
10 games by talking about it.'' That was two seasons ago, when Parcells 
led the Patriots to the Super Bowl. Now it is six games into the 1998 
season, 22 games into Parcells' Jets rule, and maybe some things are 
starting to sink in. Maybe. Then again, that is what Parcells hoped 
after the Jets toppled the Dolphins three games ago. Afterward, he 
warned his team that the Rams were sitting in St. Louis on a bye week, 
soaking up all the extra information they could to use against the 
Jets. Parcells feared the Jets would not listen to him, and he was 
right. They committed five turnovers, all leading to Ram scores, and 
Glenn Foley was replaced at quarterback by Vinny Testaverde. Now, 
the Jets are in a similar situation, and once more their coach is 
wary. ``I told them after Monday night that the Falcons' players were 
watching you, and they're getting ready to play you,'' Parcells said. 
``This game,'' he said about Sunday's meeting, ``could get us going 
a little bit. Our team has to understand how it's being viewed.'' 
So, did Parcells think the Jets learned something by losing to the 
Rams just when they were feeling good about themselves? ``It's like 
getting a second chance to understand,'' Parcells said. ``It's like 
getting hit in the face four times by a skunk before you smell it.'' 
Could he tell if the Jets smelled it yet? ``No,'' he replied. ``I 
can't.'' The Jets should not be caught off guard by the Falcons, who 
will enter the Meadowlands with a 5-1 record after their most productive 
three-game scoring splurge in team history, 116 points. This is, quite 
simply, a game the Jets have to take seriously on its merits. Yet, 
does anyone really know which version of the Jets will show up Sunday? 
Give them credit for an opening-game performance that pushed the 49ers 
into overtime. But a week later, against the Ravens, the Jets yielded 
a 69-yard punt return for a touchdown and an interception for a touchdown. 
All of last season the Jets did not give up even one return for a 
score. There was also a 99-yard scoring march by the Ravens. In Week 
3, the Jets clobbered the Colts, and the following week they stopped 
the Dolphins. But then turnovers, Foley's poor performance and Curtis 
Martin's absence because of a thigh injury did them in at St. Louis. 
Martin was back on Monday at Foxboro, the Jets had no turnovers and, 
in general, looked good. So here they are, a team whose offense is 
more powerful than it was last season, a team with a new quarterback, 
an effective running game when Martin is healthy, a collection of 
quality receivers, a well-drilled defense led by a resurgent Mo Lewis, 
and an erratic group of special-teamers. ``If we can get through this 
game,'' Parcells said, ``we'll be back to being pretty healthy.'' 
He was referring to the likely return of key special-team players 
like Fred Baxter and Chad Cascadden (who is also a valuable backup 
linebacker). In the meantime, though, Parcells hopes this game will 
provoke a collective consciousness among the Jets that they are good 
enough to win on a regular basis. Parcells said that he thought that 
would happen in last season's finale, when the Jets lost to the Lions 
and blew a playoff chance. ``What I'm trying to do is get them to 
see it the way I see it,'' he said.
