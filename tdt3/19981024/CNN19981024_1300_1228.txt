The Dodgers shelled out some dough to bring davey Johnson out of retirement. 
He will manage the troubled team, as it tries to regroup in 1999. 
Johnson has had tremendous success in preforming turnarounds in New 
York, cincinnati and Baltimore. I've always looked on the dodger organization 
as the epitome of a great organization, from the scouting system to 
the minor leagues, they always seem to breed championships. They bring 
great young players to the big leagues. To be named the manager of 
the Los Angeles Dodgers is a very emotional, humbling thing to me.
