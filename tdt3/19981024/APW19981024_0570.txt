A Brazilian pop singer was reported missing Saturday hours before 
a scheduled concert, police said. The jeep of Roberto Souza Rocha, 
25, known as Latino, was found abandoned with its engine running and 
his documents and cellular telephone inside, said police investigator 
Jorge da Silva. ``There is no clear indication as to what has happened 
to Latino but the case will shortly be handed over to this city's 
anti-kidnap police squad,'' Silva said. The singer's vehicle was found 
close to Rio's airport. He had been driving there to catch a flight 
to northeastern Brazil for a nighttime concert, said Silva. Rocha 
has made three records since 1994. His most popular record, ``Me Leva'' 
(``Carry Me''), has sold 500,000 copies.
