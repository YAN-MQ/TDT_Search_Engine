Craig Parry owed his caddie after a third-round 67 took him to the 
lead of the Australian dlrs 500,000 (U.S. dlrs 316,000) Ford South 
Australian Open golf tournament at the Kooyonga Golf Club course Saturday. 
Australian Parry, who will feature in the International team in December's 
Presidents Cup against the United States, missed some short putts 
early on before handing over responsibility to his caddie for the 
final 12 holes. ``I had a 15-foot putt on the 7th and that's when 
I asked my caddie to read the greens, I was looking at them from one 
side and they looked right to left, the other side they looked left 
to right, I just got so confused out there,'' Parry said. Parry's 
round included six birdies and a bogey and followed consecutive rounds 
of 71 on the first two days to take him to 7-under 209. Three players, 
all Australians, were two shots back on five-under _ Rodney Pampling, 
Stephen Leaney and Robert Stephens. There were only two players left 
in the draw from outside Australia and New Zealand. Robin Byrd of 
the United States was five off the pace after a 73 while Jean-Louis 
Guepy of France was three further back after a 73.
