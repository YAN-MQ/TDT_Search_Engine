Bruce Arena and Bob Bradley have been friends since 1982 and have 
coached together at the University of Virginia and D.C. United in 
major-league soccer. They also joined forces on the U.S. Olympic team. 
But they will be rivals Sunday afternoon, coaching against each other, 
when Washington and Chicago clash for this year's MLS championship 
at the Rose Bowl. Bradley was Arena's top assistant the first two 
years United captured the MLS title and was Arena's assistant with 
the Olympic team in Atlanta as well. The two also share northeastern 
roots; Arena was born in New York City, Bradley in Montclair, N.J. 
But Bradley left Arena and United to become the head coach of the 
expansion Chicago Fire this season. Joining an established league 
and taking a newly formed expansion team to the championship game 
in its first season was an accomplishment never before achieved in 
major professional sports in the United States. After leading the 
Fire to a record of 20-12 in the regular season, Bradley led the Fire 
to a sweep of Colorado and Los Angeles in the playoffs and he was 
named coach of the year. ``It's personally thrilling to see Bob have 
so much success and be recognized for it,'' Arena said after Bradley 
was presented with the award on Friday. ``I'm sure his team will be 
the most difficult opponent for us in the championship game.'' ``What 
makes our friendship so good,'' Bradley said, ``is that it has been 
based on the fact that we challenge each other. For me, it means extra 
to play United in the championship game because they have set the 
standards in this league.'' Arena and Bradley have set the standards 
for American coaches. They recruited well for their collegiate teams 
and for D.C. United in the league's initial season. Bradley did it 
alone with Chicago this season. While all MLS teams put emphasis on 
Latin players, Bradley got Europeans from Poland and the Czech Republic 
to go with his Americans. He built a team that drew 32,744 in Chicago 
for their last playoff game, a shootout victory over Los Angeles. 
Arena's gifts in evaluating talent, getting the most out of his players 
and knowing the mentality of the American player _ pro and college 
_ have made him the premier candidate for the job as coach of the 
national team. In the minds of many, Arena's appointment is imminent. 
After winning a fifth national collegiate title with Virginia, Arena 
lured Bradley away from Princeton to be his assistant at D.C. United. 
Bradley said Arena taught him that soccer was, foremost, a players' 
game and it was the players _ not the coaches _ who decide the outcome 
of a game. Both Arena and Bradley have players good enough to decide 
the outcome of Sunday's game, especially Marco Etcheverry, Washington's 
Bolivian midfielder, and Peter Novak, Chicago's Polish midfielder. 
Bradley will try to neutralize Etcheverry by assigning Chris Armas 
to shadow him, but no one can shadow him during free kicks and corner 
kicks, and that is when Etcheverry is most dangerous. Novak is not 
as creative as Etcheverry, but he gets more involved than Etcheverry 
in all parts of the field. Arena will assign Richie Williams to track 
him down in midfield.
