Many people don't know it, but saliva can contain enough DNA to positively 
identify a person. A suspected rapist now under arrest in St. Petersburg, 
Florida, found out the hard way. Police had the man under surveillance, 
but didn't have enough evidence to arrest him, until he spit out of 
his car window. A quick-thinking officer mopped up the saliva with 
a towel, and took in a Sample for testing. DNA in the saliva matched 
DNA in semen collected at the rape scenes. The suspect now faces a 
variety of charges.
