From Atlanta, this is "Headline News." I'm David Goodnow. Friday marked 
the beginning of a new commitment to peace in the Middle East. After 
nine days of grueling negotiations at the wye river plantation in 
maryland, President Clinton, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
and palestinian authority leader Yasser Arafat signed an interim peace 
agreement in the east room of the White House. President Clinton calls 
the agreement a stepping stone toward a broader Middle East peace. 
The agreement includes a working plan aimed at ending violence on 
both sides and redeployment of 13.1% of Israeli troops from the West 
Bank. Also, the Palestinians pledged to revoke clauses in their charter 
calling for the destruction of Israel and Israel will transfer 14.2% 
of West Bank land to Palestinian control. Secretary of state Madeleine 
Albright says permanent status talks could begin as early as ten days 
from now. After the historic signing, the three leaders expressed 
their heartfelt gratification. This is an important moment to give 
a secure and peaceful future for our children and the children of 
our neighbors, the Palestinians. We have seized this moment. I'm asking 
all people of good will, of honesty and Candor -- I'm asking all of 
them to join us in support for this important step for a secure future, 
a future of peace. Our agreement in the wye river underscores that 
the peace process is going ahead and that whatever we agreed upon 
in Madrid/Oslo and in Washington and Cairo is being implemented on 
the same bases that have been agreed to. And that will never go back. 
We will never leave the peace process, and we will never go back to 
violence and confrontation. No return to confrontation and violence. 
People around the world should be heartened by this achievement today. 
These leaders and those with whom they've worked have come a very 
long way. The Israeli and Palestinian peoples whose bitter rivalry 
in this century has brought so much suffering to both sides have moved 
yet another step closer toward fulfilling the promise of the Oslo 
accords, closer to the day when they can live peacefully as true neighbors 
with security, prosperity, self-governance, cooperation, and eventually, 
God willing, genuine friendship. The status of Israeli spy Jonathan 
pollard threatened to unravel the agreement. Pollard is serving a 
life sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina for giving secrets 
to Israel while he was a U.S. Navy intelligence analyst. President 
Clinton has agreed to seriously review the matter at Netanyahu's request.
