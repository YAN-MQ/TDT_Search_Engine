South African and European negotiators said on Saturday they hoped 
the two sides would reach agreement by mid November in four-year-old 
discussions over trade. South Africa's Trade and Industry Minister 
Alec Erwin and European Union commissioner Joan Deus Pinheiro made 
their remarks after meeting on Saturday. The talks bogged down in 
September, when a deal seemed near. The European Union demanded South 
African vintners stop using the names sherry or port for any of their 
wines. South Africa hopes Europe will open its markets to a number 
of South African agricultural products, including dairy products, 
cut flowers, fresh and canned fruits. Any agreement would cover roughly 
90 percent of EU-South Africa trade, worth a total 17 billion European 
currency units (dlrs 19 million). Erwin called for governments to 
provide the push to seal the agreements. ``There comes a moment when 
politicians must take their responsibility and identify a way forward 
to achieve the objectives,'' he said. Pinheiro said the talks were 
at a very difficult stage.
