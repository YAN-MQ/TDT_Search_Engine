A bomb exploded at an office of the far-right National Front overnight, 
shattering windows and damaging furniture but causing no injuries, 
police said Saturday. There was no claim of responsibility for the 
bombing, but it was the third to target a National Front office in 
France's biggest port since a young Comorian was killed here by Front 
members in 1995. The office staff includes Jean-Pierre Bauman, the 
Front's finance director and a former training instructor for members 
in the working-class district of northern Marseille. Bauman had that 
training position when Comorian Ibrahim Ali was killed in February 
1995 by three Front members who were putting up the party's posters 
in the neighborhood. Bauman and party No. 2 Bruno Megret testified 
in the case, in which the three men were convicted in the murder the 
young man. The two previous bombings were claimed by a group calling 
itself ``Partisan Sharpshooters,'' an organization unknown by police.
