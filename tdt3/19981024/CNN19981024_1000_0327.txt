President Clinton heads to California today for a political weekend. 
He'll attend several fund-rasing events for democratic candidates 
in Los angeles, then travel to San Francisco and Oakland before returning 
to washington Monday. The trip had been scheduled for this past Tuesday, 
but was postponed so Mr. clinton could stay close to the mideast peace 
talks in Maryland.
