Closing out elections that have held up action to rescue the country's 
faltering economy, Brazilian voters will elect governors in key states 
on Sunday. Allies of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was 
elected to a second term three weeks ago, are lagging in the states 
of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. The most important 
race, for the governorship of Sao Paulo, is also the closest and most 
bitter, pitting Mario Covas, who is running for re-election, against 
Paulo Maluf, a former mayor of the city of Sao Paulo. Though Covas 
took the lead in recent opinion polls, with the support of 45 percent 
of those polled against 41 percent for Maluf, the margin of error 
was large enough to suggest that either could win. Politically and 
economically, Sao Paulo's cooperation in adhering to spending limits 
and supporting reforms is essential to their success. ``The elections 
Sunday are very crucial,'' said Carlos Geraldo Langoni, director of 
the world economic center at the Getulio Vargas Foundation here and 
a former president of the Central Bank. ``This is a country that's 
still in political, not just economic, transition.'' With credit shrinking 
for emerging markets, Brazil has been struggling to regain investor 
confidence, pulling together a $23 billion package of budget reductions 
and tax increases to convince investors that it is serious about fiscal 
responsibility. But the race is so important that despite the daily 
loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign reserves, the government 
has delayed announcing the details of a fiscal adjustment package 
promised for Oct. 20. And it is taking its time reaching a final agreement 
with the International Monetary Fund. On Friday, Stanley Fischer, 
the deputy managing director of the IMF, ended a two-day visit to 
Argentina and Brazil. He said that the IMF would contribute $15 billion 
toward shoring up Brazil and that the combined aid could be double 
that amount. A spokesman for the IMF, talking with reporters outside 
while Fischer met here Saturday with Pedro Malan, the Brazilian finance 
minister, said an IMF mission would have to examine conditions in 
Brazil, perhaps for as long as three weeks, before any agreement would 
be made final. ``There is no other way to obtain a financing agreement,'' 
the spokesman said. Joseph Harmon, president of the Eximbank, also 
visited Brazil as the election neared, and left Saturday saying the 
bank might increase its lending to Brazilian companies, which currently 
receive some $3.8 billion in financing, by $2 billion or more. He 
also said he would propose the Eximbank resume lending to the Brazilian 
government after a 10-year hiatus, though the government is behind 
on some $240 million in payments since the early 1990s. Though Cardoso 
has used crises to galvanize support in the past, getting the reforms 
through Congress will probably be a far more demanding task in the 
coming term. Cardoso has already been warned by Maluf, a populist 
who is considered a sure contender for the presidency in four years, 
that his party will vote against reforms. Though Maluf's party belongs 
to Cardoso's governing coalition, Cardoso had endorsed Maluf's opponent, 
breaking a pledge to abstain from backing any candidate in the race. 
``Maluf's already put the president on notice that they're waiting 
for him around the corner in the Congress,'' said David Fleischer, 
a political science professor at the Federal University of Brasilia. 
``Winning or losing, he's very upset that the president broke his 
word on neutrality.'' As governor, Covas has been known largely for 
balancing the state's books, while Maluf's administration had been 
repeatedly accused of corruption in delivering government services. 
In Sao Paulo last week, the Covas campaign parked a giant papier-mache 
chicken in a downtown square, reminding voters of a scandal during 
Maluf's administration involving markups in the price of chicken bought 
for school meals. His opponent called Maluf a ``fascist,'' a ``rat'' 
and a ``crook.'' Maluf threw back curses. So revolting was his rival, 
he said, that ``our Lady of Osasco'' struck down the platform on which 
Covas was speaking, when it collapsed in the town of Osasco last week. 
Church officials were quick to point out, however, that there is no 
such saint. Fernando Altemeyer Junior, a spokesman for the Sao Paulo 
archdiocese, suggested that creating the saint was something else 
the candidate could take credit for. Reciting the candidate's slogan, 
he said, ``It was Maluf who did it.''
