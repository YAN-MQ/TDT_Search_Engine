Riot police fired water cannons filled with stinging pepper spray 
Saturday at several thousand people gathered for an anti-government 
protest in the capital. After warning women and children to get off 
the streets, the huge water trucks lumbered into a busy downtown shopping 
district and began spraying people who had lined the streets. Thousands 
of people fled, crying and coughing from the spray that covered the 
streets in a blue foam. Plainclothes police, some wearing ski masks, 
chased people through department stores and down side streets, nabbing 
them and tossing them into waiting vans. Some were slapped and kicked 
and muscled to the ground. Police dragged one middle-aged woman from 
a department store after she shouted at them that they were cruel. 
A policewoman carried the woman's eggs and vegetables as police pulled 
her into the street and her husband demanded, ``Are you trying to 
kill my wife?'' Some of those detained Saturday were holding shopping 
bags and it was unclear whether they were passers-by or had intended 
to join the demonstration. ``It's inhumane. We were here to collect 
curtain fabric,'' said one woman who was afraid to give her name, 
her young daughter clutching her arm and rubbing her stinging eyes. 
``If they continue to send these chemicals into the air, everybody's 
going to be dead soon.'' The anti-government demonstration, which 
never truly got under way, is one in a series of protests since ousted 
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was jailed last month. Police 
have declared illegal all demonstrations in support of Anwar, who 
is awaiting trial on charges of graft and sexual misconduct. So far, 
authorities have detained about 275 people who have attended anti-government 
rallies, releasing them on bail pending trial. This week, however, 
police warned that those who join anti-government protests could face 
arrest under the country's dreaded Internal Security Act, which allows 
for indefinite detainment without trial. Anwar, who showed up at his 
first court appearance with a black eye and neck brace, faces trial 
Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption and illegal homosexual acts. He 
has condemned the charges as trumped up by Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamad because of his growing challenge to the leader's 17-year rule.
