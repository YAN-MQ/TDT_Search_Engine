BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) - Imer Habibi kept fighting when his relatives 
fled their Kosovo homes, when comrades fell in battle and when Serbs 
razed his village. When fellow rebels sold their weapons and left 
for jobs abroad, he started having doubts. ``I can't blame anybody 
for leaving,'' said Habibi, 20, who fled here two weeks ago after 
a bullet pierced his right hand. ``We don't really have any weapons 
to fight the Serbs anyway. If we don't have some major success in 
the next month, I don't think I can ever go back.'' Three months ago, 
about 3,000 Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas were massed in northern 
Albania, from where they launched attacks against Serbian forces in 
their fight for independence for Kosovo, a majority ethnic Albanian 
province of Yugoslavia's main republic. A series of crushing defeats 
over the past few months changed all that. Now, the rebel force has 
dwindled to a few bands scattered over northern Albania, according 
to guerrillas and Western officials based here. Many rebels have grown 
discouraged and returned to jobs in Western Europe, which they left 
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched his brutal crackdown 
on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo on Feb. 28. So many rebels 
sold their rifles to finance trips abroad that the price of Kalashnikov 
assault rifles here has dropped from dlrs 180 in August to dlrs 120 
today. Gone is the bravado of a few months ago, after a wave of early 
guerrilla victories in Kosovo attracted thousands of recruits from 
ethnic Albanian communities in Western Europe. ``I don't know if our 
men will be back,'' said a guerrilla commander who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. ``We're not fighting here anymore. Our job now is to 
try to protect any refugees that cross the border.'' Those who remain 
say it is too dangerous to mount operations across the border now 
because Serb forces have bolstered their defenses. Soon, snowfalls 
in the mountains that tower along the border will seal off the few 
remaining infiltration routes until spring. Maj. Bajram Gostureji, 
commander of an Albanian government border patrol unit, estimated 
the number of Serb troops across the frontier had increased from a 
few hundred to more than 1,500. ``The border is tenser than ever,'' 
Gostureji said. ``Only last year, I used to chat with the Serb border 
guards and lend them cigarettes. Now, they shoot at us whenever they 
see us.'' In their concrete barracks, the KLA ommander and a handful 
of his men squat on milk crates, eating macaroni, drinking an orange 
soft drink and complaining of crushing boredom. Unlike their comrades 
still fighting in Kosovo, they sport neatly pressed and washed green 
fatigue uniforms and polished boots -- a sign of lots of spare time. 
Western officials here say it is premature to declare an end to the 
Kosovo rebellion. One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
said that if the U.S.-led peace process fails to improve the lot of 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, rebel ranks could swell again after winter 
ends. ``If the situation in Kosovo remains the same over the winter, 
we'll probably have a lot of the guerrillas coming back in the spring,'' 
the official said. ``A lot of them went back to their homes in western 
Europe to make money or to study.'' He also said NATO airstrikes against 
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia could also reverse guerrilla fortunes and 
encourage young Albanians to resume the fight. The Americans and Europeans, 
however, oppose the KLA's goal of independence. They want the rebels 
to endorse negotiations between Milosevic and ethnic Albanian moderates 
for self-rule within the Yugoslav federation. Meanwhile, the Albanians 
say the gradual disappearance of the Kosovo rebels has not led to 
a reduction of tensions along the border. ``When the KLA was here, 
the Serbs were more afraid to shoot into Albanian territory,'' Gostureji 
said. ``Now, it seems they want us to empty the area along our border 
to make sure the KLA never comes back.''
