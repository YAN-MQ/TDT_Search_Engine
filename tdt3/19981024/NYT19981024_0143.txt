As soon as the Yankees piled together at the mound in San Diego last 
Wednesday night to celebrate their World Series sweep, the debate 
began. Q. Is this the best team ever in major-league history? A. It 
depends on how you define ``team'' in baseball. If you mean one team 
in one season, and in the free-agent era that's about all you can 
ask, the answer is ``Yes, the Yankees are the best.'' To support that 
answer, their 125-50 record is enough (114-48 in the regular season, 
11-2 in what is now known as the postseason). To those who disagree, 
please forget the argument that this Yankee team doesn't have many 
future Hall of Famers on it, that it doesn't have a marquee megastar. 
All the more reason why Joe Torre's description of these Yankees as 
a ``team team'' is the perfect phrase. And who is to say that with 
so many seasons ahead of them, Bernie Williams, Derek Jeter, Tino 
Martinez, Paul O'Neill, Chuck Knoblauch, Andy Pettitte and Mariano 
Rivera won't compile the numbers that will translate into Hall of 
Fame votes? But if you define a team in the sense of a franchise's 
nucleus dominating an era in the World Series, the answer is ``Wait 
and see.'' Considering that the Yankees' nucleus _ Williams, O'Neill, 
Martinez, Jeter, Joe Girardi, David Cone (the oldest, at 36 next season), 
Pettitte and Rivera _ also won the 1996 World Series, two out of three 
ain't bad. But remember that the same nucleus didn't get past the 
American League Divisional Series a year ago. That's a demerit. Even 
if Williams and Scott Brosius depart for free-agent wealth elsewhere, 
if the remainder of the Yankees' nucleus helps win the Series again 
next year, it would enhance the memory of what this 1998 team accomplished. 
Throughout major-league history, winning the World Series has always 
been the barometer for the best teams. As good as the 1954 Cleveland 
Indians (the sluggers Larry Doby and Al Rosen as well as pitchers 
Bob Lemon, Early Wynn, Mike Garcia and Bob Feller) were in winning 
111 games, when they got swept by the New York Giants in the Series, 
they lost their niche in history. As good as the Brooklyn Dodgers 
(Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, Duke Snider, Gil 
Hodges, Carl Furillo) were in winning six National League pennants 
in 10 seasons from 1947 through 1956, they won only one Series from 
the Yankees, in 1955. As good as the Atlanta Braves (Tom Glavine, 
John Smoltz, Greg Maddux) have been in winning their National League 
division in seven of the last eight seasons, they won only one Series, 
in 1995. And as good as these 1998 Yankees were, or even the 1996 
and 1998 Yankees together, they haven't even approached the Yankee 
teams that won a record five consecutive Series from 1949 through 
1953. In that span, the Yankees had Joe DiMaggio in center field in 
1949, 1950 and 1951 when Mickey Mantle was the rookie right fielder, 
and then Mantle moved to center field. Two other Hall of Famers, catcher 
Yogi Berra and shortstop Phil Rizzuto, were on all five teams and 
another, left-hander Whitey Ford, was on the last four. The Yankees 
also won four consecutive Series from 1936 through 1939 with a young 
DiMaggio and four other Hall of Famers: catcher Bill Dickey, pitchers 
Lefty Gomez and Red Ruffing and an aging Lou Gehrig, whose 2,130-consecutive-game 
streak stopped early in the 1939 season when he was afflicted with 
the disease now named for him. For all the historic hoopla of the 
Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig years, those Yankee teams won only two consecutive 
Series, in 1927 and 1928, as well as two others, in 1923 (without 
Gehrig) and 1932. And for all the adulation of Mickey Mantle and Roger 
Maris, the Yankees won two consecutive Series in 1961 and 1962, but 
the 1963 Los Angeles Dodgers (Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale) swept the 
Yankees. Except for those Yankee teams that won five and four consecutive 
Series, the Oakland A's assembled by owner Charles Finley (Reggie 
Jackson, Catfish Hunter, Vida Blue, Joe Rudi, Sal Bando) are the only 
other team to win three consecutive World Series, in 1972, 1973 and 
1974. Cincinnati's Big Red Machine (Johnny Bench, Pete Rose, Joe Morgan, 
Tony Perez) won back-to-back Series in 1975 and 1976, and then the 
Yankees (Mr. October, Thurman Munson, Catfish Hunter) put together 
their 1977-1978 double in the early years of the free-agent era. Since 
then, only Toronto (Joe Carter, Roberto Alomar) in 1992 and 1993 has 
won back-to-back Series, proof of how difficult it is for any franchise 
to repeat in the free-agent era when its roster can change so much 
so quickly from year to year. That's the challenge the Yankees, with 
or without Bernie Williams and Scott Brosius, face now. If they were 
to win the Series again for three rings in four years, it would polish 
their overall luster as the only franchise in the free-agent era to 
accomplish that. If next season's Yankees don't repeat in the World 
Series, these 1998 Yankees will be remembered as one-year wonders. 
But if your definition of best team means one team in one season, 
that's enough.
