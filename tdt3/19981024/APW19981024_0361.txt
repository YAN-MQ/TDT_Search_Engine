Czech Olympic track and field champions Emil and Dana Zatopek celebrated 
their golden wedding Saturday, media reported. Emil Zatopek, five-time 
Olympic champion long-distance runner, married Dana, a javelin thrower, 
in the town of Uherske Hradiste on Oct. 24, 1948, several months after 
winning his first Olympic gold at the London Olympics. He added three 
more golds in Helsinki four years later, where he dominated the 5,000, 
10,000 and marathon races, while Dana won the gold there for women's 
javelin. In addition to their Olympic medals, the two also share the 
same birthday, Sept. 19, 1922.
