It's almost the end of the millennium and some Mexican sculptors are 
pondering the state of humanity. Problem is, many visitors to their 
exhibition are leaving with more questions than they had in the first 
place. Harris whitbeck reports. Two gigantic cast iron wheels represent 
the onslot of technology on humanity. I'm not sure science and technology 
has taken us the right way. Two spheres rolled out of stone were made 
out of the same material. The prehis panics tried to live by the stars. 
a little over a year before the millennium, Mexicans are showing their 
wisdom of where humanity is and where it is headed. But few visitors 
to the exhibit seem to understand them. I don't know what the end 
of millennium means for me anyway. Some are decidedly fayallistic. 
It's probably what is going to happen. That vision is shared by filmmakers 
these days. Some say a new artistic and cultureal movement is being 
born. But others don't feel it's right here yet. I don't want to be 
irreverent but it's just kind of a poetic idea. Even some of the artists 
aren't sure about being called a Millenniumist. It's an era that is 
being recognized. Then you just go on. In art, a movement is not classified 
as such until decades after the fact. Imagine historians in hundreds 
of years will look back see who has survived, whose work continued 
to be interesting, then they will say these are the people who broke 
through or went over knowing to the new millennium. I love you! But 
if some of the visions of that future prove to be accurate, there 
might not be much time for that anyway, Harris whitbeck.
