In March, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani signed a measure mandating sweeping 
changes in Local Law 10, the 1980 measure that requires periodic inspections 
of facades of buildings taller than six stories. The changes were 
proposed last December after bricks that separated from a wall of 
a Madison Avenue office tower rained down on the streets below. Earlier 
this month, New York City's Department of Buildings issued proposed 
regulations covering those changes. The revised measure has been officially 
designated Local Law 11 of 1998. A public hearing on the regulations 
has been set for Nov. 17. While there is broad consensus among officials, 
lawyers and construction experts that stricter laws are needed to 
protect the public from hazards posed by aging masonry on high-rise 
buildings, they also acknowledge that the new regulations could carry 
a hefty price tag. ``I'm not sure anybody really knows how expensive 
this is all going to be,'' said James Samson, a Manhattan real-estate 
lawyer. Samson explained that under the original Local Law 10, exterior 
walls within 25 feet of a pedestrian walkway or public space had to 
be inspected every five years. In practice, he said, that usually 
resulted only in the inspection of the front facade and perhaps a 
side wall or two. Under Local Law 11, however, virtually every exterior 
wall of every building taller than six stories will have to be inspected 
every five years. Moreover, Samson said, while Local Law 10 applied 
only to walls over six stories high, Local Law 11 requires inspections 
of all four walls even if only one wall of a building meets the height 
requirement. In addition to those changes, Samson said, Local Law 
11 also requires ``hands on'' inspections of any ornamental cast-stone 
or terra-cotta cornices or decorations that project more than six 
inches from the face of an exterior wall. The ``hands on'' requirement, 
he said, means that inspections of such building elements must be 
conducted close-up _ from a scaffold or platform _ rather than with 
binoculars or telephoto lenses from nearby vantage points, as was 
permitted under Local Law 10. ``This is going to be a major-league 
expense for many buildings,'' Samson said. ``Just look up and down 
Broadway. All that wonderful ornamentation and all those cute little 
gargoyles are now going to have to be inspected.'' In addition to 
imposing such new requirements, construction experts say, Local Law 
11 eliminates a provision in the prior law that allowed engineers 
to alert property owners to nonhazardous conditions in their buildings 
without forcing them to correct them. John Flynn, a professional engineer 
in Bedford, explained that under prior law, if an engineer detected 
a crack or other flaw in a wall that was otherwise sound, the engineer 
could note his observation on his report and indicate that the condition 
should be monitored. If the crack or flaw remained stable and caused 
no weakness in the wall, he said, the engineer could carry the item 
from one inspection cycle to another as a ``precautionary'' condition. 
Now, however, conditions can be classified only as ``safe,'' ``unsafe,'' 
or ``safe with a repair and maintenance program,'' with the last category 
replacing the ``precautionary'' classification. ``Putting something 
in the `safe with a repair' category means that the condition needs 
a repair to prevent it from becoming unsafe,'' Flynn said, adding 
that if such a condition is not corrected by the time the next cyclical 
inspection is conducted, it must be reported as ``unsafe'' by the 
engineer. And that, he said, creates the potential for conflicts between 
engineers and their clients because engineers who previously carried 
``precautionary'' items on their inspection reports from cycle to 
cycle must now decide whether to classify such items as either ``safe'' 
or ``safe with a repair and maintenance program.'' ``Some engineers 
might say that if a crack in a wall caused by normal settling hasn't 
moved for 50 years, the condition is probably safe,'' Flynn said. 
``But today, everybody is so litigious, an engineer would be nuts 
not to put the burden back on the building's board of directors by 
saying that the condition is safe with a repair and maintenance program. 
No engineer wants to assume liability for every crack in every building 
he inspects.'' Gene Ferrara, president of JMA Consultants, an engineering 
consulting firm in North Bergen, N.J., said that while Local Law 11 
might indeed place a greater burden on engineers by forcing them to 
make difficult decisions, the stricter standards were justified. ``The 
Department of Buildings was absolutely right to stiffen these codes,'' 
Ferrara said. ``Watching these buildings age is like watching an old 
horse in a field. He's OK today, he's OK tomorrow, but one day you 
look out at the field and he's not OK anymore.'' Ferrara _ who was 
a member of Giuliani's Building Industry Advisory Council, which helped 
draft the new regulations _ said that one problem he anticipated was 
that property owners who wait until the last minute to hire engineers 
to conduct inspections might be in for a surprise. ``I wonder if there 
are going to be enough engineers to go around,'' he said, adding that 
any engineers who might be available would be able to charge top dollar 
for their services. In fact, construction experts say, all facets 
of facade inspection and repair are expected to become more expensive 
because of the tight inspection timetable imposed by Local Law 11. 
Steven Varone, director of operations for Rand Engineering in Manhattan, 
explained that under the new law, any previously uninspected wall 
that is now subject to inspection must be studied by March 1, 2000. 
Walls that were inspected during the last inspection cycle _ which 
ended in Feb. 21, 1997 _ must be inspected for the fifth cycle between 
Feb. 21, 2000, and Feb. 21, 2002. However, he said, to make it possible 
for buildings to avoid having to conduct costly ``back-to-back'' inspections 
_ an initial inspection of uninspected walls by March 1, 2000, and 
then a regular fifth-cycle inspection of all four walls between Feb. 
21, 2000, and Feb. 21, 2002 _ the regulations permit property owners 
who inspect all four walls between Feb. 1, 1999, and March 1, 2000, 
to use that inspection to satisfy the fifth-cycle inspection requirement. 
``That's good because it allows you to avoid double inspections,'' 
Varone said. ``But it also condenses the normal two-year inspection 
cycle into one year,'' he said. And with nearly 10,000 buildings in 
the city subject to Local Law 11, construction experts say, that will 
almost certainly result in higher inspection and construction costs 
as the owners of those properties scramble to line up consulting contracts 
and construction work. ``Sure this is going to be expensive,'' said 
Peter Corsell, president of Peter Corsell Associates, a consulting 
engineering company in Manhattan. ``But what are the alternatives? 
The risks may vary from building to building, but every year you have 
freezing and thawing taking place and every year every building gets 
one year older. It might be expensive to put a scaffold on your building 
and start probing around. But it could be a whole lot more expensive 
to just leave the building alone and wait to see what happens next.''
