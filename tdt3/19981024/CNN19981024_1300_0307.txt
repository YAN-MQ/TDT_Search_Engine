The democratic candidate for governor of Pennsylvania is apologizing 
for racial slurs he made during a radio talk show yesterday. The campaign 
spokesman for Ivan itkin says the candidate meant no harm. Itkin used 
the slurs to describe low-paid Mexican and Chinese workers during 
a discussion on wages for American workers. The campaign manager of 
his opponent calls the incident "inexcusable."
