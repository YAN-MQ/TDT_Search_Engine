On the morning after being defeated by Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel's 
1996 elections, the Labor Party leader, Shimon Peres, was asked what 
he thought happened. ``The Israelis lost,'' said Peres. ``The Jews 
won.'' What Peres was referring to was his notion that Israel had 
become divided between ``Israelis'' and ``Jews.'' The ``Israelis'' 
tend to be secular, with their primary loyalty to Israel as a state 
and their own individual and material advancement. They see Israel's 
future as being in the peace process and in greater and greater integration 
with the region and the world at large. The Israelis, though, come 
in two varieties: the dovish, liberal Israelis (49 percent) and the 
conservative, security-hawk Israelis (25.5 percent). The dovish Israelis 
pretty much liked Oslo as it was, and voted for Peres; the security-hawk 
Israelis wanted a better Oslo, and voted for Bibi to make it happen. 
The ``Jews''(25.5 percent), by contrast, come from the traditional 
and Orthodox communities, the West Bank settlements and the religious-Zionist 
movements. They are devoted to a traditional conception of Judaism 
and see the Israeli state as a means to fulfill Judaism's commandments, 
not as an end itself. The Jews are skeptical of integration, which 
they equate with assimilation, and they see Israel as fated to perpetually 
struggle with its non-Jewish neighbors. They were threatened by Oslo 
and voted for Bibi in hopes that he would kill it. Bibi's heart always 
seemed to be with the Jews, but his head _ and his electoral future 
_ was always with the Israeli hawks (and doves). For two years, he 
did all he could to avoid having to choose between them, but when 
finally forced to do so _ when presented with a credible Palestinian 
security plan, undergirded by the CIA _ Netanyahu opted for a deal 
based on what most Israelis wanted (a better Oslo), not on what most 
Jews wanted (no more Oslo). In doing so, Bibi did something hugely 
important. He brought the Israeli hawks into Oslo, adding them to 
the Israeli doves who were already there, and thereby put the Oslo 
accords on a solid foundation of 75 percent of the Israeli public. 
The Israeli Israelis are now all on board, but many of the Israeli 
Jews are still not. The crucial political question is, Can Bibi bring 
the Jews into Oslo as well? Until now, Bibi has kept the Jews on board 
_ while negotiating with the Palestinians _ by constantly delegitimizing 
Yasser Arafat, building settlements and playing down prospects for 
any deal. He has been like Nixon going to China, while all the time 
telling his people he was just visiting Taiwan. But this time it is 
clear to everyone: He has gone to China. He is doing his own deal 
with Yasser. And God bless him for it. But for this deal to work, 
Bibi has to treat the Palestinians as a real partner (and they him) 
and freeze settlements and rein in Jewish extremists, every bit as 
much as Arafat has to rein in Hamas. And that means he has to find 
a way to hold the Jews, and bring them along into Oslo, not by playing 
on their fears of peace with the Palestinians, but by constructing 
a positive vision of it for them. ``Bibi has now taken ownership of 
the pragmatic side of the Oslo peace process and made it better and 
more popular,'' said Stephen Cohen of the Center for Middle East Peace. 
``But now Bibi has got to begin to build a constituency among the 
Jews of Israel for peace as something more than a defeat of the Palestinians 
or the result of coercion from Washington. It has to have a positive 
meaning for them _ if they are to give him the space he needs, not 
only to implement this deal, but to reach a final accord. He has got 
to start persuading the Jewish Jews that a smaller Israel, at peace 
with the Palestinians and respected in the region, will lead to the 
real `Greater Israel.''' Bibi's first instinct, though, seems to be 
to tell the Jews that he had no choice, that he got them the least 
bad option, and to try to toss them bones like the release of Jonathan 
Pollard. That may work for some for a while, but it won't cut it for 
long. Because as Oslo moves forward, and more territory is ceded, 
these Jews will feel they are losing their Israel, and that will make 
them very dangerous. This is the time when Bibi needs something more 
than pragmatism. He needs the thing that Shimon Peres was so often 
ridiculed for _ a vision of Israel at peace that will make a settlement 
with the Palestinians a positive choice not just for Israel's Israelis, 
but also for its Jews.
