As if to make sure we do not underrate the best-ever greatness from 
the good old days, the last player to hit .400 showed up here hours 
after the Yankees' Broadway parade Friday afternoon to honor an old 
pin-striped catcher who won more than a handful of World Series rings, 
and apparently never wanted his fiercest rivals to forget it. So said 
Ted Williams, sitting affectionately beside Yogi Berra for the dedication 
of Berra's brand-new museum on the Montclair State University campus, 
showing and telling how Berra used to greet him all those years ago. 
``Every finger on his hand had a World Series ring,'' Williams said. 
``He'd wave and say, `Hi Ted. How ya' doing?''' In the wheelchair 
he has used since suffering a stroke in 1994, Williams said he was 
doing just fine, though, as Yogi would have put it, he seemed to be 
experiencing the symptoms of deja vu all over again. As they were 
so many times when Williams was rattling balls around and out of Fenway 
Park and other major league parks, the Yankees were being celebrated 
as World Series winners again, and, wouldn't you know it, over the 
team from Williams' hometown. From his home, now in Florida, he rooted 
for the Padres, and wanted to believe they had a chance to climb back 
into contention in Game 3, but then this third baseman who last season 
in Oakland hit half of Williams' .406 in 1941, turned around Trevor 
Hoffman's fastball for the Series-defining blow. And as Yogi didn't 
say, it was over before it was over. How many times had Williams witnessed 
this brazen Yankee conduct? As his cab driver had said earlier in 
the day when Williams asked what he had thought of the Series: ``It 
wasn't long enough.'' Which was precisely Williams' point about what 
typically happens when the Yankees of most years get involved. The 
third baseman he called ``Broshe,'' was more scientific proof that 
``the Yankees have something that no one has discovered yet. They 
get a player who has never done anything before, and now he's knocking 
things down. I mean, anybody could have got that third baseman, but, 
the Yankees did. I don't know if they're injecting them with venom, 
or whatever.'' At 80, with a wit as sharp as his old swing, the last 
thing Ted Williams wants to do is complain that they don't make 'em 
like they used to. He says today's ballplayers are bigger, stronger, 
faster. On the other hand, he said the two best players he ever saw, 
without question, were the now ailing Joe DiMaggio and the late Mickey 
Mantle, both of whom retired decades ago. And when he said he doesn't 
fancy himself as the greatest hitter of all time, he added, ``I can't 
say I was a better hitter than Lou Gehrig.'' What he was saying, in 
so many words, is that the best-ever riddle is a pitch so wide only 
a bad-ball hitter like Yogi could reach it, and then just to foul 
off. The more striking measure of all-time greatness is this one special 
franchise that began winning in 1923, and, 24 titles later, has not 
stopped. The most significant legacy of the 1998 Yankees will be their 
powerful expansion of the Yankees legacy. ``I'm disappointed they 
won this year because I wanted to see San Diego win,'' Williams said. 
``But I could see how good the Yankees were. Wherever they went, it 
was one guy or another, 25 guys, as good at every position as you 
can get.'' At a news conference for the museum (you don't get this 
honor, Berra said, unless you're ``dead or gone''), Ralph Branca wondered 
if people even remembered that the Yankees between 1949 and 1953 won 
five straight World Series. ``Any time you start saying, `the greatest,' 
you're stretching it, really stretching it, because each era is so 
different,'' said Larry Doby, knowing that any team predating the 
admittance of black players to the major leagues could be stricken 
from consideration on that basis alone. Then again, at no other point 
in baseball history have there been as many small-market franchises 
whose resources are a small fraction of the big-market powers. Would 
these Yankees have won 114 games playing in the saner financial climate 
of, say, the 1977 and 1978 champion Yankees, two 100-victory teams 
with first-rate professionals top to bottom? These questions are all 
rhetorical, ball players being so difficult to judge until you see 
them pitch and hit against each other. Williams, in fact, said the 
first time he saw the stumpy Berra come out of the dugout to catch, 
he said: ``Who are they trying to kid with this guy?'' Now, here they 
were, in the theater of Yogi's own museum, by coincidence on the very 
day Joe Torre's Yankee were the kings of New York. ``Did you know 
that we never had one parade?'' said Whitey Ford, 70 years old last 
week. He shook his head at the thought of those ingrate mayors, which, 
I guess, makes the current one the greatest Yankee fan in the history 
of City Hall.
