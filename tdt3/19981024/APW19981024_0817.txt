Hoping to ease concerns about the security of international monitors 
in Kosovo, the Security Council demanded Saturday that Yugoslavia 
implement an accord to end fighting in the Yugoslav province and said 
action may be needed to enforce it. After nearly eight hours of rare 
Saturday consultations and discussions, a divided council adopted 
a resolution 13-0 to endorse the agreement to allow unarmed monitors 
to patrol Kosovo and NATO to verify from the air that fighting has 
stopped. China and Russia abstained from the vote. China argued the 
resolution went beyond what was agreed to between Yugoslavia and U.S. 
envoy Richard Holbrooke. Russia said details of the resolution _ particularly 
an expression of deep concern about recent closure of independent 
media in Yugoslavia _ had no place in the resolution endorsing the 
accord. Russia and China, both permanent council members, were opposed 
to any resolution threatening Serbs and ethnic Albanians with force 
if they don't comply with the Oct. 12 agreement, which averted NATO 
strikes on Serb targets. They could have vetoed the resolution or 
abstained from it. Much of the negotiation Saturday was intended to 
prevent a possible veto by easing language about the threat of force, 
diplomats said. Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov stated before the 
vote that the resolution ``excludes all enforcement elements,'' and 
guarantees against ``arbitrary or unsanctioned actions.'' The Security 
Council was under pressure to adopt a resolution enshrining the accord 
and protecting the verification team. Potential troop-contributing 
nations are concerned about safety of their forces and wanted the 
council to endorse the plan first, with provisions for enforcement. 
Fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up 90 
percent of Kosovo's population _ has killed hundreds of people and 
forced around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown on Albanian 
separatists began in February. Under the Oct. 12 deal brokered by 
Holbrooke, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to implement 
a cease-fire, to withdraw his special police forces from the province 
and to allow a 2,000-strong team from the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe to verify the agreement. NATO would verify 
compliance from the air. Council President Jeremy Greenstock of Britain 
said he was sure the resolution provided the 54 OSCE member states 
with the security guarantees they needed. ``They know they have NATO 
in particular behind them on this in following up this resolution,'' 
Greenstock said heading into the vote. ``I'm sure this will mean the 
OSCE can go forward as soon as its organized itself.'' Eugeniusz Wyzner, 
the ambassador for Poland, which holds the OSCE presidency, said he 
trusted that the resolution would help make the agreement effective 
``and to assure safety and security of international verifiers.'' 
It was believed to have been the first council resolution endorsing 
a NATO operation, diplomats said. A draft resolution tabled Friday 
night would have allowed NATO to take ``appropriate steps'' to ensure 
the agreement is enforced. It noted that in the event of an emergency, 
``action may be needed'' to ensure the safety of unarmed monitors. 
Saturday's resolution deleted reference to international organizations 
taking ``appropriate steps'' and instead demanded Yugoslavia implement 
the accord fully and promptly. The measure still allowed that action 
may be needed to protect the monitors but referred back to Yugoslavia's 
duty to ensure their safety under the accord. It also demanded that 
both sides in the Kosovo dispute cooperate with verifiers and start 
talks on a political solution. Russia has religious and cultural ties 
to Serbia, the dominate republic in Yugoslavia. China is traditionally 
opposed to any military intervention into what it considers an internal 
matter, fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with 
Taiwan and Tibet.
