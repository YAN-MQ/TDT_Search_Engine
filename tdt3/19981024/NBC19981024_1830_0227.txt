With the ink barely dry on the new mideast peace agreement, the focus 
now -- How to convince hard-liners to give peace a chance. As NBC's 
Martin Fletcher reports, Netanyahu and Arafat agree, but that's not 
enough. While Jewish settlers on the West Bank look on, pro-peace 
israelis, today, help Palestinians with their olive harvest as Israeli 
soldiers keep the peace. The peace process in miniature. We have to 
live together. Jews and Arabs can live together. Not everyone here 
is so positive though. The partners in peace, Yasser Arafat in Austria 
today and Benjamin netanyahu still in Washington, will both have a 
hard time selling their peace deal at home. Netanyahu faces a rebellion 
by some right-wing members of his government who don't want to give 
up any land. It is a black day for Israel, a black day for the Jewish 
people. Arafat must confront his own extremists, Islamic militants, 
who simply want the destruction of Israel. The highlights of the deal 
worked out at the nine-day summit. Israel will give the Palestinians 
another 13% of the West Bank. But there's a big if. First, Arafat 
must collect illegal weapons held by Palestinians. That could lead 
to confrontation, even war, with the Islamic militants. He has to 
reduce the number of his own men under arms from about 40,000 to 24,000. 
And cancel a clause in the Palestinian charter that calls for the 
destruction of Israel. It'll be very hard. Even supporters of peace 
here are skeptical. It doesn't matter how good the agreement looks 
on paper, it is here on the West Bank that it has to work. Speaking 
to the people here, Arabs and Jews, the clearest thing is they just 
don't trust each other. These Palestinians all agree they don't trust 
Netanyahu. But by promising to come to the West Bank soon, President 
Clinton is saying he'll keep up the pressure on both leaders. And 
working from the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv, the CIA will check how 
many guns are taken from the militants. It's a new, deeper role for 
Americans in the mideast peace process, but one that could mean the 
difference between success or failure. Martin Fletcher, NBC, Tel Aviv.
