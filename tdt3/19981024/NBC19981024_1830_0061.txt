Good evening. Abortion rights activists are calling it political terrorism. 
S Barnett shepian, a New York doctor well known to anti-abortion protesters 
were shot dead by a sniper last night while at home with his wife 
and children. The killing comes just days after they warned people 
about a pattern of sniper shootings in that region early on. It was 
an execution style killing. One bullet fired from a high-powered rifle 
crashed through the window of dr. Barnett slepian's suburban Buffalo 
home striking him in the back. Somebody laid in wait. Dr. slepian, 
an obstetrician, performed abortions at this Buffalo clinic. Slepian 
was no stranger to confrontation. Protesters regularly picketed at 
his home and his office. He even appeared in court in the late '80s 
accused of assaulting one picketer. In a 1994 editorial in "the Buffalo 
news," slepian warned that no one should be surprised when a "more 
volatile and less restrained" anti-abortion protester reacts "to their 
inflammatory rhetoric by shooting an abortion provider." Melinda DuBois 
is the director of the clinic where slepian worked. He took these 
threats and took those precautions that he needed to and he took them 
seriously, but he stated constantly that he would never let it interfere 
with his practice. In fact just three days before the shooting, the 
FBI and Canadian authorities warned of possible attacks on doctors 
who perform abortions in canada and in some cities near the Canadian 
border. We were aware, the doctors were informed. They have a network. 
They faxed us information today. They have been taking precautions. 
In the past four years abortion people in Canada and upstate New York 
were wounded by gunshots through their homes. In Buffalo an anti-abortion 
activist. None more than those that new Dr. shepian as not an abortion 
doctor but as a doctor that delivered their children. He was a very 
caring doctor, very personal. He you went in the office. You were 
treated with utmost care. This city in New York is considered one 
of the safest cities in New York. Yet Dr. slepian off ten wore a bulletproof 
vest to work. Now, all authorities are investigating his work.
