Words of relief and praise are pouring in from around the world, a 
day after Palestinian and Israeli leaders signed an interim peace 
agreement. France says the deal took persistence, commitment and courage 
from the Middle Eastern leaders and U.S. negotiators. Russian officials 
say they admire the spirit of constructiveness and good will of the 
summit in Maryland. And Egypt says the pact is one step on the right 
path to peace. Militant Jewish settlers are calling the agreement 
a betrayal and they promise to fight it and to try to bring down the 
government. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
authority President Yasser Arafat say they will not succumb to those 
who want to destroy the peace process.
