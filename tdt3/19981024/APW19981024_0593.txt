Police detained up to 200 leftist demonstrators Saturday after clashing 
with them on the fringes of a rally by rightist extremists. Police 
detained three people at the rally, called by the extreme-right National 
Democratic Party to protest a Bonn exhibition on atrocities committed 
by German soldiers in eastern Europe during World War II. The detained 
rightists were carrying weapons, police said. Between 150 and 200 
leftists were detained after pelting police with bottles. Police used 
batons against the demonstrators, witnesses said. The leftist and 
some 1,000 extreme-right protesters were kept apart by a heavy police 
presence.
