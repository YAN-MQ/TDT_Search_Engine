And finally, a golfer in California is recovering from an unusual 
sports-related accident. The unidentified man impaled himself with 
his own golf club. The club head flew off when he was swinging. He 
then fell and was pierced in the waist by the headless shaft. He managed 
to walk to the pro shop and ask for help, and was taken to the hospital 
by helicopter. Police say the man later asked for his club back because, 
in his words, "The shaft was still good."
