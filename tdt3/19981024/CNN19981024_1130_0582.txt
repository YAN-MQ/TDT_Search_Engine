in today's edition of "tech trends," john zarrella takes a look at 
the objectives of the deep space one mission. beneath the protective 
gold foil layering, behind the folded solar panels, is a space craft 
that may revolutionize travel to the planets and beyond. we feel that 
we're getting to turn fantasy into reality, and that's very, very 
exciting. deep space one is a probe that will head to an asteroid. 
but where it is going is not nearly as important as how it gets there. 
for the first time, a spacecraft is being powered by ion propulsion, 
which generates thrust by shooting out electrically charged gas. if 
it works, the technology is ten times more efficient than conventional 
rocket engines. the reason ion propulsion is better is because it 
uses less propellant. that means you can have a smaller propellant 
tank, less massive spacecraft, and that means you can launch the space 
craft on a more affordable launch vehicle. the vehicle is also equipped 
with an experimental autonomous navigation system. simply put, the 
probe always knows where it is in the solar system, knows where it 
is going and, without help from humans, can correct its course if 
necessary. to use solar electric propulsion with our autonomous navigator 
is like having your car drive itself from new york to los angeles 
and park in its parking space all on its own, getting about 300 miles 
per gallon. deep space one is nasa's version of a prototype economy 
car, built simply to see if it works. there are a lot of future missions 
that are looking at the results from deep space one, and a lot of 
the planning for our future planetary missions will be based on how 
successful we are. with an ever-shrinking budget, nasa is desperate 
for ways to make space flight more affordable and less risky. the 
breakthrough the agency has been hoping for could be this superefficient 
probe with a mind of its own. john zarrella, cnn, at the kennedy space 
center in florida.
