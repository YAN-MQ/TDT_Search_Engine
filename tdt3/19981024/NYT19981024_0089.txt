The United States, China and the two Koreas agreed Saturday to create 
two working parties to explore a peace treaty and to examine confidence-building 
measures on the peninsula, home to the most heavily defended border 
in the world. Concluding four days of talks here, the four countries 
also agreed to hold a fourth round of discussions in Geneva next January. 
The working groups will not begin work before then, according to a 
statement that described the closed-door discussions as ``useful and 
constructive'' and ``conducted in a businesslike manner.'' The agreement 
came after the talks had earlier hit an apparent snag when the official 
news agency of the Stalinist government in North Korea issued a statement 
last week criticizing the timing of U.S. military exercises with South 
Korea. Those maneuvers, routine since 1961, are scheduled to begin 
Oct. 26, the day after talks here are set to end. It was the third 
round of such talks over the last few years. The last time the four 
parties met, in March, the talks collapsed over North Korea's insistence 
that the United States withdraw its troops from the border dividing 
the peninsula, a demand that has repeatedly been rejected. The 1950-53 
Korean War ended in an armistice, leaving North and South Korea technically 
in a state of war. For 45 years the border has remained a potential 
flash point, guarded by 37,000 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands 
of Korean troops on both sides. The United States and South Korea 
have indicated a willingness to discuss troop withdrawal, but officials 
say South Korea objects to the demand being on the talks' formal agenda. 
North Korea also has sought a separate peace treaty with the United 
States, but the Clinton administration has maintained that any such 
treaty must be signed between the two Koreas. Publicly the demands 
on all sides appear unchanged. The chief U.S. negotiator, Charles 
Kartman, sounded cautiously optimistic when the talks opened, although 
on Friday evening he stressed that there was no agreement yet. ``We've 
made quite a bit of progress in narrowing the differences, but the 
North Korean position remains quite firm,'' he said, emerging from 
the first day of talks on Wednesday. The resumption of the talks here 
was part of a deal between the United States and North Korea in a 
negotiation held in New York last month that centered on North Korea's 
missile program. Those discussions took on added urgency after North 
Korea's launching on Aug. 31 of what officials now believe was a staged 
rocket in a failed attempt to lift a satellite into orbit. The rocket 
flew over Japan and landed in the ocean. At the same time, new concerns 
have emerged over North Korea's nuclear program, with reports that 
North Korea has constructed an enormous underground complex.
