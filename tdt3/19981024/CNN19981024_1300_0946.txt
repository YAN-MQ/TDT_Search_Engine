The government's antitrust lawsuit against computer software giant 
microsoft is under way in a Washington courtroom. Steve young looks 
at the first few days of trial. Bill Gates didn't ap pear at the courthouse 
in person. The trial began with the government introducing excerpts 
from his pretrial deposition on videotape. A key subject all week 
has been a 1995 meeting attended by Microsoft and netscape executives. 
The government claims the meeting included a suggestion by Microsoft 
toivvy up the browser market with Netscape. Lead government attorney 
David boyes portrayed Gates as a liar, contrasting his pretrial depositions 
with company E-mails. Gates testified he was not aware of the 1995 
meeting, and of the alleged market allegation charge until much later. 
Boyes then introduced dozens of E-mail messages between Gates and 
senior company executives, showing he was spearheading the anti-Netscape 
strategy. Microsoft says other parts of Gates' deposition will prove 
he testified truthfully. Bill Gates acknowledges on five or six different 
occasions that he was aware of the meeting shortly after it occurred. 
So the way the government tried to portray that is very, very misleading. 
Microsoft attorney John Warden opened his case Tuesday trying to refute 
the governments charges. He argued Microsoft fights hard, but that 
antitrust law is not a code of civility. He complained the government 
has mystified the software market by looking at only windows-based 
PCs. Warden claimed would-be, new competitors face no structural barriers 
put up by Microsoft. The first and only witness so far has been the 
governments. Netscape's CEO, Jim barksdale, who's endured nearly three 
days of grueling cross-examination. Steve young, "CNN Financial News,"
