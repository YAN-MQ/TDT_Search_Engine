It's another sign winter is just around the corner. Daylight saving 
time ends at 2:00 A.M. Sunday in most parts of the country. You should 
turn your clocks back one hour before going to bed tonight, or when 
you get up tomorrow. Some parts of the U.S. are exempt from the change. 
Those include Arizona, Hawaii and the part of Indiana in the eastern 
time zone. Puerto Rico, the virgin islands and American Samoa are 
also exempt.
