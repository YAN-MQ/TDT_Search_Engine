Duane Walker, "Headline Sports." Let's begin on ice where -- with 
college football news. In college football news, Auburn head coach 
Terry bowden has resigned. The 1-5 tigers were off to their worst 
start in over 50 years. It didn't seem to be anything more than a 
pine in time which I could do nothing but continue to make a difficult 
for these young men to have the type of positive experience they came 
here for so that's disappointing. A little shocking, but, again, it's 
the nature of this business. I don't know if they ever accepted Terry 
as an Auburn man. I don't know. I don't know if it was because he 
was a bowden or because he didn't go there or what. But he tried to 
be an Auburn man. He really loved it over there. But I don't know 
if they ever accepted him as an Auburn man.
