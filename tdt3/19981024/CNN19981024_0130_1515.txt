In the past, Hollywood has portrayed Russians as movie bad guys. But 
lately a few characters have been turning into laughingstocks. And 
Moscow isn't happy about it. Betsy Aaron reports. As if Russians didn't 
have enough problems, now what's playing in moscow -- is "Armageddon," 
hardly the final and conclusive battle between the forces of good 
and evil, just a Hollywood glimpse at the U.S. and russia teaming 
up to save the earth from space. But in the celluloid "Armageddon," 
already available on pirated video tape, mir, Russia's space station, 
is a mess. This is a Russian space station. It's cosmonaut -- an unshaven 
drunk. Hardly what Russians think about when they think about space. 
Yuri gagarin, now there's a hero. Mir, seven years past its prime 
and still in orbit. Russians are used to being celluloid victims. 
In the days of the Soviet Union, it was the country Hollywood loved 
to hate. Observe, Mr. bond, the instruments of "Armageddon." The Russian 
was tough and tall. I must break you. But now, Russia's got problems. 
In Hollywood terms, "she's sort of a joke." Russians couldn't find 
snow in the middle of winter. One deputy in Russia's parliament isn't 
laughing. We must, as deputies, give notice to them not to touch such 
important feelings of Russians. We warn that Russians will be not 
the target in the next films of hollywood. The threat from Mr. mitrofanov 
-- Russia will not allow films with questionable images of Russians 
to be shown here. Mr. mitrofanov obviously hasn't surveyed movie fans 
leaving "Armageddon." I took it as a good joke. Bruce Willis was hired 
to sell the movie, but the Russian guy's job was to save the world. 
Yeah, we were proud. He was drunk, so what? At the end he saves everybody's 
life. You know who else is laughing, the moviemakers. "I don't care 
what you say about me," they're probably saying, "as long as you say 
something." Betsy Aaron, CNN, Moscow.
