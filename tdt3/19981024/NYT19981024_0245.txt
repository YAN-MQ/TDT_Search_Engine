The Mets and Mike Piazza, their All-Star catcher, reached agreement 
Saturday on the richest contract in baseball history, a seven-year 
deal for $91 million. ``This tells the fans that we appreciate the 
fact that they came back to watch us play after we acquired Mike,'' 
said Nelson Doubleday, co-owner of the Mets. ``They wanted a marquee 
player, we needed a marquee player and we got them a marquee player. 
And when the fans came back, we decided it was our turn to put that 
nickel into the team.'' Piazza could not be reached for comment, but 
a close friend of Piazza's said: ``Mike's happy. He's excited about 
the moves the Mets are making.'' One of those moves would be the re-signing 
of pitcher Al Leiter to a four-year deal believed to be worth $32 
million, which the Mets apparently were on the verge of doing. ``We 
are extremely close,'' Leiter said Saturday. Doubleday said: ``We 
needed Mr. Piazza. And we need Mr. Leiter. And we're lucky enough 
to be in a market where we're able to afford it.'' Piazza batted .328 
with 32 home runs and 111 runs batted in last season with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, the Florida Marlins and the Mets. After the Mets 
acquired him from the Marlins on May 22, he hit .348 with 23 homers 
and 76 r.b.i. in 109 games. The agreement with Piazza makes it very 
likely that catcher Todd Hundley, who has long been the Mets' popular 
player but struggled badly this season after returning from elbow 
surgery, will be elsewhere next season. ``I love Todd Hundley, and 
the Mets are better off having him on the team,'' Doubleday said of 
the former All-Star. ``But he's got a career. And it would be difficult 
with him and Mike there together. But we have no plans to put him 
at the end of the diving board and bounce him out of here.'' Hundley 
had said that he expected to be traded if the Mets re-signed Piazza, 
which was why he requested a contract clause limiting the teams he 
could be traded to. The clause, which the Mets granted, allows Hundley 
to pick 12 teams to which he cannot be dealt. Piazza was eligible 
for free agency once the World Series ended, but did not file. The 
Mets did not begin negotiations with him until last Wednesday, but 
the talks progressed quickly, and Saturday the two sides agreed on 
a contract that averages $13 million a year, including a $7.5 million, 
two-part signing bonus. Piazza will receive salaries of $6 million 
in 1999, $11 million in 2000, $12.5 million in 2001, $9.5 million 
in 2002, $14.5 million in 2003 and $15 million in both 2004 and 2005, 
said a person familiar with the negotiations. He will be paid $4 million 
of the signing bonus in 1999 and the other $3.5 million in 2002. The 
contract includes amenities such as a suite on the road and a luxury 
box for games at Shea Stadium and a clause that limits the teams to 
which Piazza can be traded. Piazza and the Mets will each pick four 
teams, and if there is duplication, the Mets cannot choose another 
team. Piazza surpassed pitcher Pedro Martinez of the Boston Red Sox, 
who last December signed a six-year contract averaging $12.5 million 
a year, as the highest-paid player in baseball history. Piazza earlier 
this year rejected the Los Angeles Dodgers' offer of $84 million for 
six years, or $14 million a year _ $1 million a year more than the 
deal he accepted from the Mets. The question of whether they could 
re-sign Piazza had hung over the Mets while they fought, unsuccessfully, 
for a playoff berth throughout the second half of the season. Piazza 
struggled at the plate with runners in scoring position after he joined 
the Mets, and he was roundly booed at Shea Stadium, putting in question 
his desire to stay with the team. But after the Mets announced on 
Aug. 5 that they would postpone any contract discussions with him 
until after the season, it appeared that he began to relax. And for 
the last two months of the season Piazza all but carried the Mets 
offensively, turning the boos to cheers. Hundley now appears to be 
the loser. Phillips promised Hundley that he would not trade for Piazza 
three days before he did. Then there damaging reports were leaked 
from within the Mets' organization questioning Hundley's work and 
drinking habits. Shortly after, in early June, Hundley began to work 
in the minor leagues on learning how to play the outfield. But after 
34 starts in left field for the Mets, the experiment was abandoned. 
Hundley has two years left on a contract that has a guaranteed payment 
of $11.7 million remaining. If other clubs are convinced that Hundley 
is healthy and can catch without throwing problems, the Mets should 
be able to get good value in return. With an agreement in place with 
Piazza, Mets General Manager Steve Phillips was next expected to finish 
negotiations with Alan Hendricks, Leiter's agent. Leiter has sought 
a four-year, $32 million deal. Leiter said early Saturday that he 
and his agent had not heard from Phillips since Wednesday, but speculated 
that the general manager had been focusing on Piazza.
