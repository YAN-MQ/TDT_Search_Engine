Three actresses are casting a spell on television audiences in their 
new show called "charmed." Dennis Michael reports. Shannen Doherty, 
Alyssa Milano and holly Marie combs are working magic in their new 
drama, "charmed." They're charming audiences as siblings who discover 
they are witches with special powers. Phoebe, I do not have special 
powers. Now where is the cream? It's a skill Doherty wouldn't mind 
employing on the set. After all, she is getting reacquainted with 
the strains of series work after leaving "Beverly Hills 90210" in 
1994. When I am feeling lazy after I worked 14 hours a day and, you 
know, I like don't wanna, you know, get up and make myself food or 
bring myself a soda or whatever, I can just move it to me, which would 
be fabulous. The show's premiere broke records for the WB. It was 
the highest-rated debut ever for the network. I came running in the 
makeup trailer in the morning and I was like, "Highest WB premiere 
ever!" And they were like "what?" "Speak English, calm down! Talk 
slow!" And all I kept saying was -- "ever!, ever!" The real master 
magician here is Aaron spelling, who knows what it takes to make a 
hit. He made Doherty a household name in "90210" and Alyssa Milano 
took up residence on "Melrose place." Everything he touches turns 
to gold, you know? But I worked with him on "Melrose place." So I'm 
happy to be working with him again. You always feel safe with spelling. 
He is very loyal. Once you have a good relationship with Aaron, then 
he seems to want to work with you over and over and over again. And 
it's good because you -- you go back into a situation knowing exactly 
what you're getting in. And you know what to expect. And therefore 
it makes it somewhat of a smooth ride. It was the only way to get 
their powers. And now I want yours. The actresses find themselves 
battling evil, and occasionally, each other. But getting along when 
the cameras aren't rolling has been no difficult trick at all. da 
da Come here, baby. Come here. This is holly. You guys -- I'm not 
talking anymore for us. You guys, this is holly Marie combs and we're 
best friends. I knew they were friends, so I was a little freaked 
out. But as soon as I got to the set, I was like, "this is gonna be 
so much fun." And the viewing audience is clearly picking up on some 
of that sorcery. Dennis Michael, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
