Delegations from North and South Korea, the United States and China 
reached agreement Saturday on a strategy for negotiating a permanent 
peace to one of the world's potential flash points _ the divided Korean 
peninsula. The four-party conference agreed to set up two subcommittees 
to ``discuss respectively the establishment of a peace regime on the 
Korean peninsula and tension reduction there.'' Negotiators said they 
would hold the next round of talks in Geneva Jan. 18-22. A U.S. official 
said it was hoped then to begin the ``substantive work.'' The protracted 
haggling over procedural details highlighted just how long and fraught 
the way ahead is likely to be. Two previous rounds of talks last December 
and March broke down over North Korean demands that the conference 
agree on an agenda _ including its demands for withdrawal of the 37,000 
U.S. troops from South Korea _ before setting up the two working groups. 
After the meeting, North Korean officials insisted they hadn't changed 
their position, saying troop withdrawal and a peace agreement with 
the United States are still among their fundamental demands. The United 
States stood by its refusal to put troop withdrawals on the agenda, 
the U.S. official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The United 
States and China are attending the talks because they are the main 
allies of capitalist South Korea and communist North Korea. The U.S. 
official said there was no sign of any change in tactics or policy 
of North Korea since the last round of talks. It took seven hours 
just to agree on the wording on the draft establishing the subcommittees, 
according to the U.S. official. The committees will be responsible 
for drawing up proposals to be submitted to delegation heads. They 
will not have any negotiating power. The exact membership of the subcommittees 
and the details of what they will discuss has yet to be determined. 
Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean delegation and chairman of 
the current meeting, said South Korea believed ``big progress'' had 
been made in setting up the two sub-committees. They will discuss 
``concrete and substantive issues'' relating to establishment of peace 
and reduction of tension, he said. ``With the launch and operation 
of the sub-committees, we hope to initiate a long-awaited and eagerly 
sought in-depth discussion,'' he said. Park said the South Korean 
government was prepared to play a more proactive role in future talks, 
but declined to be specific. Any items could be brought into the process 
for discussion, he said. China is also ``open to any ideas'' for inclusion 
in January's discussions, Chinese Ambassador Qian Yong-nian told reporters. 
``Now we have passed the stage of discussing procedural matters,'' 
he said. ``It has been a tangible result.'' Agreement on procedures 
is vital because only after that can the Geneva talks address the 
substance of a full peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended 
the 1950-53 Korean war. The border between the Koreas is the world's 
most heavily armed, with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both 
sides. Annual military maneuvers held jointly by South Korean forces 
and their U.S. allies are scheduled to begin Monday. Tensions flared 
this year after reclusive North Korea launched a small satellite, 
which was originally thought to be a ballistic missile. However, Pyongyang 
is under pressure to make some compromises as it desperately needs 
foreign food aid to feed its 23 million people because of a combination 
of economic mismanagement, flooding and drought.
