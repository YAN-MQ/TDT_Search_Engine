Russia and China are fiercely opposed to NATO's eastward expansion 
and proposed airstrikes on Yugoslavia, and plan to increase military 
cooperation with each other, Russia's defense minister said Saturday. 
Igor Sergeyev also reiterated Russian and Chinese warnings against 
a U.S.-Japanese plan to develop an anti-missile defense system, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. ``This is a factor which can impair 
the balance of forces, and slow down the process of reduction of strategic 
arms,'' he said in Beijing. Sergeyev called his talks this week with 
Chinese officials on NATO and the Balkans ``very important,'' ITAR-Tass 
said. The U.N. Security Council is considering a resolution that would 
allow NATO to enforce a peace accord for the Yugoslav province of 
Kosovo, but Russia and China remain staunchly opposed. Russia has 
religious and cultural ties to the Serbs, and China traditionally 
objects to military intervention into what it considers an internal 
matter. Sergeyev said the two countries planned to expand military 
cooperation, ITAR-Tass said. The report did not elaborate. Sergeyev 
cited his Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian as saying that President 
Jiang Zemin would visit Russia in late November. Chinese officials 
have not announced a date for the trip, but have said it would be 
before year's end. Sergeyev also said during his visit that Russia 
is continuing to reduce its troops along the Chinese border. Also 
Saturday, a delegation led by the speaker of Russia's lower house 
of parliament left Moscow for China for talks with Jiang and Hong 
Kong officials. After decades of friction, relations between Moscow 
and Beijing have improved dramatically in recent years as China has 
become a major trading partner and a leading customer for Russia's 
struggling defense industry. Russia views the new relationship with 
China as a counterbalance to what it sees as U.S. pre-eminence in 
world affairs.
