Jordan on Saturday hailed the Palestinian-Israeli peace deal as a 
cornerstone for lasting peace but in neighboring Syria the official 
media ridiculed it as a Palestinian surrender and an Israeli trap. 
Egypt, a frequent mediator in the Israeli-Arab conflict, was cautious 
in its approval. The U.S.-mediated deal signed Friday can never be 
called a ``peace agreement.'' Syria's government newspaper, al-Thawra, 
said. ``It is rather a liquidation and a total surrender of what has 
remained of the Palestinian rights,'' it said. ``All Palestinian rights 
have been swallowed and canceled from the political dictionary,'' 
the paper said, adding that the agreement favored the Israelis heavily. 
The English-language Syria Times said the agreement was a ``trap for 
the Palestinian side, which has left itself open to Israeli threats.'' 
Syria technically is at war with Israel, which occupies Syria's Golan 
Heights, and peace talks between the two countries have made no progress 
during the time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been in office. 
But Israel's warm relations with the Jordanian government were reflected 
in comments by Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh. Jordan is only 
the Arab nation other than Egypt to have signed a peace treaty with 
Israel. Tarawneh said Friday's agreement ``puts the peace process 
back on track and opens the door for negotiations on a permanent settlement.'' 
Under the peace deal, Israel has agreed to withdraw troops from additional 
West Bank land in exchange for security guarantees. Tarawneh said 
Jordan ``looks forward to implementing this agreement in good will 
and the interest of all.'' Jordan's King Hussein is Israel's closest 
Arab ally and had made an emotional appeal for peace during the negotiations, 
which he joined on two occasions, taking a break from his cancer treatment 
at the Mayo Clinic. Despite the government optimism, Jordan's independent 
newspapers reacted cautiously, saying Israeli deeds and not words 
were needed will provide a lasting peace. ``The bet is on its implementation 
and not allowing any of the two sides to invent obstacles and problems 
to dodge away from'' the deal, said the mass circulation al-Ra'i newspaper. 
The caution was shared by Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa. ``It 
is a step in the right direction so long that it will lead to an Israeli 
withdrawal from Arab Palestinian territories,'' Moussa said in Jordan, 
where he arrived Saturday for a three-day visit. ``But what is crucial 
is for the peace process to move forward through the true implementation 
of the deal,'' he said.
