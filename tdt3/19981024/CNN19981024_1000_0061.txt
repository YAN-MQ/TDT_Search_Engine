The agreement stalled at the last minute in a dispute over an American 
imprisoned for spying for Israel. David Ensor looks back at the case 
of Jonathan pollard. He is the only American ever sentenced to life 
in prison for spying for a U.S. Ally, sentenced in March 1987 after 
providing the Israeli government with thousands of pages of highly 
classified satellite and military intelligence documents. Many U.S. 
officials still consider Jonathan pollard a dangerous traitor. Joseph 
digenova was the U.S. attorney who obtained a life sentence for the 
former naval intelligence analyst. It is a terrible signal to everyone 
in U.S. intelligence and law enforcement, because it means there is 
actually a reward if you spy for an ally. It's never been done in 
the history of the United States. But the government of Benjamin Netanyahu 
considers pollard an israeli patriot, and has campaigned hard for 
his release to Israel. He served his time. And simply on the humanitarian 
basis and nothing else we would like to see him released and allowed 
to go to Israel. In may, Israeli cabinet secretary Danny Naveh visited 
pollard at the federal prison in butner, North Carolina. At that meeting, 
pollard was asked whether he regrets what he did. I would rather look 
to the future, in terms of what I hope to accomplish for the state 
and our people, rather than what I may or may not have done in the 
past. Do you regret things that you've done in the past? Everything. 
At that time, Israel met a U.S. demand that it admit publicly for 
the first time that pollard was an Israeli agent. Pollard's wife, 
Esther, says her husband has already served a far longer sentence 
than any other American convicted of spying for an Ally. She is praying 
for his freedom. Thank God if Mr. Clinton is willing to do this. Thank 
God that he is restoring the principle of equal justice in America. 
As for the American intelligence community, one former CIA official 
said he and his colleagues are shocked that the president would even 
considering letting pollard go. David Ensor, CNN, the state department.
