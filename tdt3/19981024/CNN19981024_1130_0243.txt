president clinton touched on the new mideast peace agreement in his 
weekly radio address this morning. he says it restores hope for peace 
between israelis and palestinians. he then announced the white house 
will host a two-day conference in december to find a solution to the 
social security crisis. mr. clinton says he hopes it can be a bipartisan 
effort. today, i'm proud to announce the next important step we'll 
take in putting these principles to work. on december 8th and 9th 
we'll hold the first-ever white house conference on social security. 
to help pave the way toward a bipartisan solution early next year. 
unfortunately, some in congress already may be backing away from this 
historic opportunity. just last week, the senate majority leader said 
he may not be willing to join me in our efforts to save social security. 
that would be a grave pls stake. as with so many other long-term challenges, 
if we act now, it will be far, far easier to resolve the problem than 
if we wait until a crisis is close at hand. i believe we must save 
social security, and do it next year.
