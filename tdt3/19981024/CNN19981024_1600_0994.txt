On Wall Street, blue chip stocks ended the week on a down note, following 
seven consecutive sessions of gains. The Dow Jones industrial average 
closed Friday, down nearly 81 points to 8452. Lower interest rates 
are behind the robust housing market. The percentage of homeowners 
has jumped to a record 67% to more than 69 million homes. The government 
says whites still outnumber minority homeowners by a wide margin.
