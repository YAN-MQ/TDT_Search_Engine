A Florida meat-processing company, dixie Packers, is recalling 108,000 
pounds of hot dogs distributed to winn-dixie grocery stores. The affected 
hot dogs have the sell-by codes on your screen. The usda says the 
meats may be contaminated with bacteria that can cause severe headache, 
neck stiffness and even death for people with weakened immune systems. 
The hot dogs were distributed in 14 states and the Bahamas.
