Mr. Clinton has agreed to review the case of convicted Israeli spy 
Jonathan pollard. Pollard's ex-wife says she hopes Mr. Clinton will 
pardon both her and her former husband in the wake of the mideast 
peace agreement. Anne pollard spent 40 months behind bars in connection 
with her husband's conviction for spying for Israel. I believe the 
Israeli government from the start should have admitted that it was 
not a rogue operation. They should have said that they sanctioned 
it. They should have come forth and been honest to begin with because 
everybody knew it was. And secondly, as his wife, I was dragged into 
this. The Israeli government knew that and they did nothing at that 
time in 1985 to help me. In fact, they cooperated with the U.S, government 
against my former husband. Jonathan pollard pleaded guilty to espionage 
charges a decade ago and was sentenced to life in prison.
