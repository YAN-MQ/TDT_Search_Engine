China could be the next target of typhoon babs. The storm has already 
killed more than 100 people and caused millions of dollars in damage 
in the Philippines. Forecasters expect babs to gain strength as it 
approaches Hong Kong by tomorrow. Babs is the second typhoon to ravage 
the region this month. Typhoon zeb killed more than 100 people when 
it followed a similar storm track last week.
