Intense talks were under way Saturday in a closed session of the U.N. 
Security Council to overcome Russian and Chinese objections to a resolution 
that would hint at the use of force if President Slobodan Milosevic 
of Yugoslavia failed to withdraw forces from Kosovo. The Western-sponsored 
resolution, written by France and Britain, has the support of the 
United States and seven other members of the council, including Japan, 
Germany, Italy, Sweden and Portugal. The immediate goal of the discussion, 
however, focuses on whether NATO can use force to protect some hundreds 
of unarmed, largely European observers drawn from the 54-member Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe who will monitor the area. 
The effort is designed to support an Oct. 13 agreement reached by 
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke with Milosevic, who has pledged 
to observe a cease-fire in the southern Serbian province, withdraw 
Serbian security forces there and allow the return home of ethnic-Albanian 
refugees. Fighting between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanians, who 
make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, has killed hundreds of 
people and forced about 300,000 from their homes since Milosevic sent 
his troops to crack down on separatist rebels in Kosovo in February. 
Russia has circulated its own resolution that would authorize the 
European mission and NATO to verify Belgrade's compliance. That version, 
however, omits any references to rescuing the observers should they 
come under fire. China is equally adamant in its opposition to any 
use of force by NATO. Its U.N. representative, Qin Huasun, said Saturday 
that NATO could not use force against Yugoslavia without seeking authorization 
from the council and described any use of force as ``brutal interference 
in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.'' As permanent members 
of the Security Council, Russia and China could veto proposals they 
dislike. The proposed Western draft seeks permission to ``take appropriate 
steps'' to insure that Belgrade fully complies with U.N. demands. 
Although NATO already has sufficient authority and fire power to intervene 
in Kosovo without further U.N. authorization, Western nations want 
to obtain a legal basis from the United Nations to protect monitors 
in Kosovo, diplomats say. The draft affirms that ``in the event of 
an emergency, action may be needed to insure their safety and freedom 
of movement.'' The Western diplomatic lobbying is backed by a measure 
of brinkmanship, however, as two of NATO's top military commanders 
arrived in Belgrade on Saturday to warn Milosevic that he will face 
air strikes. The two are NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, 
Gen. Wesley Clark, and the chairman of the alliance's military committee, 
Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany. The U.S. Embassy in Belgrade said the 
two generals would hold talks with the Yugoslav Army's chief of staff, 
Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
