Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat expressed his ``unending thanks'' 
Saturday to European leaders for backing up the Mideast peace process 
with generous financial aid. He asked them to keep their wallets open. 
Arafat also said he hoped the West Bank land-for-peace deal, concluded 
Friday, can revive talks Syria and Israel which broke down two years 
ago. Arafat made an unscheduled appearance at a meeting of European 
Union leaders, flying to this alpine resort from the signing ceremony 
in Washington of the deal concluded after nine days of talks with 
the Israelis at Wye Plantation in Maryland. ``They (the EU leaders) 
were my first port of call,' Arafat told reporters after his meeting 
with the 15 leaders. He assured them their aid for Palestinians _ 
half a billion dollars from the EU budget alone since 1993, plus hundreds 
of millions from individual EU governments _ ``is very much appreciated. 
My thanks are unending.'' The EU is the biggest aid donor to the Palestinians 
and Arafat suggested they keep up that position at donor conference 
December in Vienna. EU governments praised U.S. President Bill Clinton 
for forging the interim peace deal. French President Jacques Chirac 
said of Clinton: ``Your determination to make hope prevail over resignation 
renewed the dialogue in favor of a just and durable peace.'' Dutch 
Prime Minister Wim Kok said ``The EU will stand by and assist in the 
political process and the economic process of implementing the agreement.'' 
He said the EU should intensify financial support for Palestinians. 
The Wye agreement will give Palestinians 13 percent more of Israeli-held 
territory on the West Bank of the Jordan River. In return, they pledged 
steps to fight terrorism by Islamic militants and to end provisions 
in their charter calling for abolishing the Jewish state. Before coming 
here, Arafat met briefly in Vienna with Austrian Foreign Minister 
Wolfgang Schuessel, whose country currently holds the EU presidency. 
Asked at a press conference there if Palestinian radicals such as 
Hamas would accept the Wye accord, he replied, ``I don't know.'' But 
at the press conference here, Arafat sounded firmer, saying the Palestinian 
Authority will crack down on Palestinian hardliners _ an issue of 
primary concern to Israel. ``We will never allow anyone, whoever that 
may be, to undermine or endanger that peace process,'' he said. Arafat's 
presence here did not hide the persistent inability of the Europeans 
to play a decisive role in the Mideast peace process. ``It is time 
the European Union comes up with our own initiative to support peace 
and stability in the region,'' said Schuessel. The Europeans have 
long resented being frozen out by the Americans from playing a leading 
role in negotiations between the Arabs and the Israelis.
