Customs agents at the Franco-Spanish border seized 57,000 Ecstasy 
pills from a car bound for Holland, France's largest haul of the hallucinogenic 
drug to date, authorities said Saturday. Agents arrested the driver, 
a Dutch man who was not identified, after finding the pills hidden 
in his car on Thursday, the authorities said on customary anonymity. 
The man was placed under formal investigation Friday, one step short
