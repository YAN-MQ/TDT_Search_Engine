The U.N. security council should vote today on a resolution that endorses 
the Kosovo peace accord. Yesterday, Russia voted to block the resolution 
because it would allow NATO to intervene in the Yugoslav province 
if monitors are in danger. The motion is supported by the United States 
and other countries. But Russia claims it violates the U.N. charter. 
China also opposes the threat of force. NAto is sending its supreme 
commander to Yugoslavia. He will warn President Slobodan Milosevic 
to comply with an agreement to remove his troops from Kosovo by Tuesday. 
Milosevic agreed to the withdrawal October 12th under the threat of 
NATO air strikes.
