President Hosni Mubarak denied Saturday reports that he had promised 
to pardon an Israeli-Arab serving a 15-year sentence for espionage. 
``This is empty talk and I have never given such a promise to anyone,'' 
Mubarak told a public meeting in Suez, 134 kilometers (84 miles) east 
of Cairo. Israeli television and radio reported Friday that as part 
of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement forged at Wye River, Egypt was 
going to release Azam Azam. Last year an Egyptian state security court 
jailed Azam, a member of Israel's Arab minority, for 15 years with 
hard labor for spying for Israel. ``Israeli Prime Minister (Benjamin) 
Netanyahu had already raised this issue and the answer was that the 
release of a prisoner means the release of all other prisoners,'' 
Mubarak said. ``The Israeli spy was convicted by a court and I respect 
the court's judgment ... We cannot change a court's verdict just like 
that, otherwise things would become chaotic'' Mubarak said. Earlier 
Saturday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa confirmed that U.S. 
President Bill Clinton had asked Egypt to pardon Azam. ``There have 
been contacts concerning this, but they were rejected,'' Moussa replied 
when asked if Clinton had asked for the spy's release. Israel has 
always denied that Azam was a spy and has repeatedly appealed for 
his release. Azam was convicted after a bizarre trial in which prosecutors 
said he supplied women's underwear soaked in invisible ink to an Egyptian 
accomplice. The accomplice, who was jailed for life with hard labor 
on the same charge, used the ink to write secret messages to Israeli 
intelligence about Egyptian factories.
