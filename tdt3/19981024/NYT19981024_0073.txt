European leaders welcomed Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, at 
a lakeside summit meeting near this Alpine border city Saturday and 
hailed the agreement he reached with Israel at Wye Plantation under 
U.S. auspices Friday as a triumph for President Clinton. Arafat, in 
Palestinian headgear and an olive-drab uniform, was welcomed as a 
last-minute guest at the start of a two-day meeting on the future 
of the European Union. He flew into Vienna and then here to brief 
leaders of the 15 European Union countries and thank them for years 
of political and economic aid. ``My thanks are unending,'' he said 
at a news conference here later, at which he also thanked Clinton. 
He said he had told Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that 
they would be ``partners in peace'' together. ``We were very grateful 
to President Clinton, without whom we probably would not have achieved 
what we achieved,'' he said. Arafat said he had expressed gratitude 
to the European leaders meeting in a resort hotel in Portschach for 
their political support of the peace effort through recent months 
of difficult negotiations. ``Europe, as you know, and in particular 
the European Union, can be counted among the countries that assist 
the Palestinian people the most,'' he said. ``It is not by chance 
that immediately after the signing ceremony I came here directly.'' 
The European Union countries have contributed well over $1 billion 
to the Palestinians since the first peace accord with Israel five 
years ago. A spokesman for Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, said 
Sunday, ``The patience of people and their determination to pull it 
through has paid off, and it is clear that this has been a personal 
triumph for President Clinton as well.'' France's foreign minister, 
Hubert Vedrine, expressed admiration earlier for Arafat, Netanyahu 
and Clinton for reaching the latest agreement. France's president, 
Jacques Chirac, has expressed support for an eventual Palestinian 
state. Germany's defense minister-designate, Rudolf Scharping, said 
here, ``Yesterday, we saw that under the leadership of the United 
States there was achieved a fruitful and absolutely necessary development 
for peace in the Middle East.'' He added that Europeans had some way 
to go before they would have the kind of coordinated diplomatic, military 
and economic leverage that enabled the United States to broker the 
accord. Arafat, visibly fatigued from his overnight trans-Atlantic 
journey, said that future negotiations with Israel would deal with 
refugees, Israeli settlements on the West Bank, the border between 
Israeli and Palestinian-controlled territory, water rights and the 
status of Israel. ``Al-Quds,'' he said, using an Arab term for Jerusalem's 
status as a city holy to Islam, ``has top priority.''
