Now, the coming showdown over Britain's decision to arrest and Spain's 
request to extradite the former Chilean dictator, augusto Pinochet, 
the charges that he is responsible for murders while in power, some 
of them in the United States. NBC's Kevin Tibbles is in London tonight. 
"Pinochet's a killer," they chant on the streets of London today, 
calling for the extradition of former Chilean leader augusto Pinochet. 
Pinochet has been detained for a week by British authorities, who 
are threatening to send him to Spain to stand trial. Pinochet's wife 
now pleads for his release, but the British government so far has 
refused. Pinochet staged a military coup in 1973. Under his rule more 
than 3,000 people were killed, thousands more tortured. Spain says 
some of its citizens were victims. So far the U.S. government has 
refused to comment on Pinochet's arrest, but 36 members of Congress 
have sent this letter to President Clinton. In it they say "the case 
against Pinochet and his allies presents a Significant opportunity 
to work with the world community to punish those responsible for international 
crimes in Chile, the United States and elsewhere." Case in point, 
this 1976 car bombing in Washington, not only killed a Chilean dissident, 
it also killed his American colleague. Human rights activists suspect 
Pinochet knew of the plot. The military government under general Pinochet 
executed United States citizens and in fact carried out attacks in 
the United States. Some lawyers say recent changes to international 
law make it easier to bring those accused of atrocities to trial. 
It is in everybody's interests of those that committed Gross violations 
of human rights should be brought to justice if at all possible. Still, 
in London, Pinochet continues to fight extradition. His lawyers will 
be in court Monday arguing the 82-year-old former dictator was traveling 
on a diplomatic passport and should be freed. Kevin Tibbles, NBC,
