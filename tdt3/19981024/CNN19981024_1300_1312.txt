Hockey history was made on Friday night, as the Cannucks' Mark Messier 
became just the tenth player in NHL history to score 600 goals. Messier's 
historic goal was part of Vancouver's 5-0 win over the Panthers. Hall 
of fame coach Scotty Bowman was back behind the bench in Detroit on 
friday. Bowman made his return from angioplasty and a knee replacement 
over the summer. The red wings lost 5-3 to Toronto.
