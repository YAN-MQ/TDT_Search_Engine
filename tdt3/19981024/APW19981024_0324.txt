If Augusto Pinochet stands trial someday in Spain, the prosecution 
will try to prove the former dictator sought to destroy a segment 
of the Chilean population, a lawyer close to the case said. ``This 
is known in legal terms as self-genocide,'' said Joan Garces, comparing 
the Chilean case to the Pol Pot bloodbath of Cambodians. Garces, who 
spoke earlier this week, has worked closely with Spanish judge Baltasar 
Garzon, who sought Pinochet's detention in London on Oct. 16 as a 
preliminary step toward his extradition to face trial in Spain for 
genocide and terrorism. Most of the victims of the Pinochet era were 
Chileans, but Garces said others included people from Spain, Britain, 
the United States, Austria, France, Switzerland and Argentina. Garces 
was once a close advisor to socialist President Salvador Allende, 
who died when Pinochet and other military officers staged a violent 
coup in 1973. Garces now represents the relatives of victims of the 
17-year Pinochet dictatorship. Judge Garzon will be able to draw on 
evidence showing that around 4,000 people were abducted, tortured, 
murdered or disappeared during the general's authoritarian rule, Garces 
said. Garzon's detention warrant cites 94 cases of people being killed 
or disappearing in Argentina in seizures carried out by the Pinochet 
regime aided by Argentine cohorts between 1976-83. They were victims 
of Operation Condor, a campaign by South American military juntas 
to wipe out political opponents. Garces said the judge may broaden 
his case soon to include reference to Pinochet's victims in Chile, 
strengthening the genocide allegation that the dictator sought to 
crush the leaders of more than half the Chilean population. The lawyer 
said he was confident that the Spanish attempt to extradite Pinochet 
would survive appeals filed by the head prosecutor of the National 
Court, Eduardo Fungarino. The court deals with national security issues 
such as terrorism and genocide, but Fungarino has argued that Spanish 
courts have no business delving into Chilean crimes. ``Fungarino has 
been acting like a kind of personal lawyer for Pinochet,'' Garces 
said, insisting that Spanish law gives a ``crystal clear'' mandate 
to Spanish magistrates to pursue the perpetrators of genocide no matter 
where it happens. The National Court is expected to rule Thursday 
on the jurisdiction issue. Garces said he hopes the United States 
will bolster the Spanish case by making available classified information 
from the Pinochet period. Although the United States helped Pinochet 
seize power and consolidate his regime in order to crush Allende's 
socialist government, Garces refuses to discuss the political backdrop 
to the killing in Chile. ``Chilean politics and United States foreign 
policy at the time are irrelevant to this case, which is strictly 
about criminal responsibility,'' Garces said, adding that the case 
referred to crimes against humanity rather than ideological struggles. 
``Murder is murder is murder and we are not interested in what the 
motive behind the murder was,'' he added.
