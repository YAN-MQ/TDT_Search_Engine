Singapore's highly paid leaders will have their salaries cut when 
an influential council makes recommendations next month, a newspaper 
reported Saturday. The National Wages Council, a tripartite body representing 
government, unions and employers, is expected to urge across-the-board 
pay cuts when its guidelines are released in November, said The Straits 
Times. Dominated by the government, the council's recommendations 
are widely adopted in tightly controlled Singapore. But government 
ministers, whose salaries are equivalent to those of corporate leaders, 
will also feel the pinch. ``Ministers will naturally take a salary 
cut if the (council) recommends a salary cut for everybody,'' Manpower 
Minister Lee Boon Yang was quoted as saying. He noted that Singapore 
leaders have in effect already experienced a pay cut this year, when 
a planned mid-year raise of 8.1 percent was suspended by the government. 
Singapore has been searching for ways to reduce the cost of doing 
business here as a solution to its slowing economy, and a package 
including lower taxes, utilities, rentals and wages is expected soon. 
Workers and unions in Singapore have expressed concerns over bearing 
the burden of these measures. A likely cut in the country's mandatory, 
state-run pension fund _ from which many Singaporeans pay their mortgages 
_ has worried some here. ``The measures that the government will take 
has got to be equitable,'' Lee was quoted as saying in the report. 
``We're not just asking workers to bear the burden of cost reduction. 
The government will also make adjustments.'' On rising unemployment, 
he estimated the rate will grow to between 4 and 5 percent by year's 
end, roughly double the 2.3 percent figure in June. ``There's a likelihood 
that we will go into a recession, yes, but the unemployment rate would 
depend on how deep the recession is and how willing Singaporeans are 
... to take on alternative jobs or jobs that were done by foreign 
workers,'' Lee added.
