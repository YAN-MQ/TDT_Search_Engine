Germany's designated environment minister expects the new government 
to start closing the nation's 19 nuclear power plants during its four-year 
term, a magazine said Saturday. Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's 
Social Democrats have agreed with their junior coalition partner, 
the environmentalist Greens, to move the country toward scrapping 
nuclear power but has set no timetable. As a first step, the government 
plans shutdown negotiations with the power industry, which has threatened 
to sue for billions of marks (dollars) in damages if the administration 
closes nuclear plants without its consent. Juergen Trittin, a Green 
in line to be environment minister, appeared to predict quick progress 
in an interview with Focus magazine. ``I expect that a series of nuclear 
power plants will be shut down during this legislative term,'' which 
runs for four years, he was quoted as saying. Werner Mueller, a Schroeder 
adviser on energy policy who will become economics minister, said 
he backs the government's plans because most Germans oppose nuclear 
power. ``I don't see the necessity for atomic power nowadays,'' he 
told Focus. Still, he stressed that the plan could succeed only in 
consensus with utility companies. Mueller told Focus that he discussed 
the government's plans with utility executives over the past week. 
Schroeder's new government is to be sworn in Tuesday, a month after 
the Social Democrats' victory in Sept. 27 elections.
