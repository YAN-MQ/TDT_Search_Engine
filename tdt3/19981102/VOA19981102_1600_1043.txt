The battle for the men's number one world tennis ranking continues 
in Paris this week at the final super nine event of the year, the 
Paris Open. Defending champion Pete Sampras of the United States continues 
his quest to become the first player to win the top ranking in six 
consecutive years, but number two Marcella Rijos of Chile, third ranked 
Patrick Rafter of Australia, and 16 other top 20 ranked players stand 
in his way. In early results, Mark Phillip Pusos of Australia used 
his big serve to blow past Daniel Vechek of the Czech Republic 7-6, 
7-6, while Mark Rosay of Switzerland knocked off South African Wayne 
Perreira 6-3, 6-4. Tommy Haas of Germany was a straight sets winner 
over Carlos Costa of Spain. Gian Lucaposi of Italy defeated Swede 
Thomas Enquist, and Germany's Nicholas Kiefer beat Yan Krozlak of 
Slovakia.
