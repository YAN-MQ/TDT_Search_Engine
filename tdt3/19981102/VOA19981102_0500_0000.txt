The White House strategy session today will focus on Iraq's refusal 
to cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors. I'm Paul Whestpheling. And 
I'm Charlene Porter. The Palestinian authority is due to submit a 
new security plan today and a land for peace accord is due to take 
effect. South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has stirred 
a firestorm with release of its study of apartheid era abuses. Our 
correspondent in Johannesburg is scheduled to join us. From the pop 
music world, Elton John fans are ready to bid on souvenirs owned by 
that British rocker. Sports, a business update, and a look at possible 
global climate change are all ahead in this hour of VOA News Now. 
Now a news summary is next.
