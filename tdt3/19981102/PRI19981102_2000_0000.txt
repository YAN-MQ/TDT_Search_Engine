A co-production of the BBC world service, PRI and WGBH Boston. It's 
Monday November 2. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. Today in the wake of 
Hurricane Mitch, Nicaragua's death toll climbs by the thousands. Also 
Iraq insists it won't let UN weapons inspectors do their work. It 
says the latest crisis is not its fault. Rules against lifting sanctions. 
Not Russia, China and France. It's the United States. Also heads, 
will Republicans get elected with the help of Hispanic votes and will 
Chuckie get lucky in the global sense of course? Hollywood hopes foreign 
movie goers will seek cinematic escape from their economic woes. First 
up, this news. From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm 
Cory Flintoff.
