From the BBC news room in London, this is Pamela McCall. You're listening 
to the World. The World is brought to you by the Capital Group Companies, 
investing throughout the world for individuals and institutions. This 
is the World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH 
in Boston. I'm Lisa Mullins.
