Despite encouraging signs from exports and the currency, the rupiah, 
Indonesia's top economic minister says the economy will falter without 
corporate debt restructuring. The rupiah has gained nearly 40 percent 
in value during October and exports have gained, while inflation and 
interest rates have fallen. However, Indonesia's corporate sector 
has been lackluster since the Asian crisis struck with few takers 
for a restructuring program called the Indonesia initiative.
