And lawyers for the National Basketball League owners and players 
are meeting again today in another attempt to reach a collective bargaining 
agreement. The season was supposed to begin later tomorrow but all 
the games scheduled to be played in November have been canceled because 
of the player lockout initiated by team owners. More cancellations 
are expected if the two sides fail to quickly work out an agreement.
