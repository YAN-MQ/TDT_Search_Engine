Officials in Nicaragua and Honduras say they fear more than 7,000 
people may have died in flooding and mudslides triggered by former 
Hurricane Mitch. Honduran officials say 5,000 people could have been 
killed in their country from the powerful storm. And Nicaragua authorities 
estimate 2100 deaths with 1500 people feared killed in mudslides that 
swept away several villages. Many deaths are also reported in El Salvador 
and Guatemala. Hurricane Mitch swept through the Caribbean late last 
week and weakened Sunday.
