France has added its name to the list of nations seeking the arrest 
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. The judicial sources 
in Paris say a French judge has issued an international arrest warrant 
for the 82-year-old general clearing the way for a formal extradition 
request. The move comes as General Pinochet battles extradition to 
Spain from Britain where he was arrested following back surgery last 
month. A British court has ruled the arrest illegal, but that decision 
is under appeal.
