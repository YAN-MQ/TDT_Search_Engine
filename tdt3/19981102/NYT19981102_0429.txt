Sangstat Medical Corp. said Monday that the Food and Drug Administration 
had approved its immune-suppressant drug, Sangcya, for preventing 
organ rejection in transplant patients, and for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis and psoriasis. Sangstat said it would bring out the drug 
within a month. The FDA said Sangcya was therapeutically equivalent 
to Novartis AG's Neoral, its proprietary formulation of cyclosporine, 
which is projected to have worldwide sales of $1.3 billion this year. 
Sangstat said it would price Sangcya about 20 percent below Neoral, 
which would save transplant patients about $1,200 a year. Although 
Sangstat was notified of the approval over the weekend, the company 
did not plan to release the information until Tuesday morning. In 
NASDAQ trading, Sangstat shares closed Monday at $21.675, up 87.5 
cents. Analysts said the approval and pricing were both widely anticipated, 
and the issue now would be how effectively Sangstat could compete 
with Novartis. ``We had to face a number of hurdles and intense lobbying 
by our competitor,'' Dr. Philippe Pouletty, Sangstat's chairman and 
chief executive, said in a telephone interview, noting that two citizen 
petitions filed by Novartis and one by a Washington law firm attempting 
to block Sangcya had been denied. ``We are optimistic about the market 
acceptance of Sangcya,'' he said. Novartis officials were not available 
for comment. Pouletty said the FDA's finding of therapeutic equivalence 
meant that patients would not need a new prescription from their physician 
to switch from Neoral to Sangcya, and he noted that more than 70 percent 
of transplant patients had already switched from Novartis' older Sandimmune 
to Neoral. At a lower price, and with a more convenient formulation, 
Sangcya will compete effectively, he said. But analysts said the transplant 
community would not take the entry of a new drug lightly. Although 
bioequivalent, Sangcya differs from Neoral in that it is taken in 
liquid form, with a special dispenser developed by Sangstat, rather 
than in capsules. The liquid may be easier to take, as Sangstat suggests, 
but for patients who depend on daily use of a drug to stay alive, 
the change will not be an automatic one. ``Even if a new prescription 
is not required, I think physicians will want to build up a great 
deal of experience and education,'' before switching patients to the 
new drug, said Viren Mehta, an analyst with Mehta Partners. He noted 
also that safer, more potent immune suppressant drugs are coming from 
both Novartis and American Home in the next few years.
