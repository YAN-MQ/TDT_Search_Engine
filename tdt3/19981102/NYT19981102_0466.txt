The Food and Drug Administration Monday approved the first drug developed 
by biotechnology for rheumatoid arthritis, opening a new approach 
to treating the debilitating disease of the joints that afflicts more 
than two million Americans. The drug, Enbrel, was shown in clinical 
trials to reduce pain and swelling in the joints of many patients 
with severe arthritis. It does not cure arthritis or reverse damage 
that has already been done to bones and cartilage. The drug agency 
has approved Enbrel for use by people with moderate or severe arthritis 
for whom existing drugs have failed. It can also be taken with methotrexate, 
the most commonly used drug, if necessary. Enbrel was developed by 
the Immunex Corp., a biotechnology company in Seattle and will be 
marketed in conjunction with the Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division 
of the American Home Products Corp., a large pharmaceutical firm that 
owns a majority of Immunex. The new drug is one of several recently 
approved or being developed for rheumatoid arthritis. Immunex said 
the main side effect of Enbrel, which patients take by giving themselves 
an injection twice a week, was irritation at the site of the injections. 
But the drug agency is requiring the company to continue studies to 
see if there are any long-term safety problems. Enbrel is expected 
to face competition from Remicade, a similar drug from Centocor Inc. 
of Malvern, Pa., that is in the final stage of clinical trials. Last 
week, an advisory panel to the drug agency recommended approval of 
a blood-filtering device made by Cypress Bioscience Inc. of San Diego 
for use in severely arthritic patients for whom drugs have not worked.
