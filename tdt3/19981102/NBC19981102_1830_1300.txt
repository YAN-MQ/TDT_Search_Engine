now to a different kind of health hazard that is causing so much alarm, 
dog attacks are on the rise and posing a big danger. dogs are good 
companions but some aggressive dogs and bad owns can lead to trouble. 
here's nbc's mike boettcher. a typical scene in an american backyard, 
but experts say it's a disaster waiting to happen -- even though this 
man is sure it will never happen to him. they're playful dogs. it 
all depends on how you raise them. that's all it is. if you raise 
them to be mean and aggressive, they're going to be that way. many 
are that way. according to the centers for disease control, dog bites 
are now the leading reason that children end up in the emergency room 
-- a bigger health issue than measles, mumps and whooping cough combined. 
while most bites happen at home with the family pet, many happen on 
the streets when dogs are abandoned or escape. in a flash, it happens 
quickly. no one's expecting it, and suddenly everyone's lives are 
changed. children's lives, mostly. he clawed me here and bit me here. 
7-year-old levigh helton of portland, oregon. 12-year-old michael 
piazza, attacked in utica, new york. just 2 of 4.5 million dog bite 
victims this year, two-thirds of them children -- a situation that's 
gotten so bad in los angeles that a dog bite public health warning 
has been issued. city of los angeles, we have an epidemic. it is seriously 
out of hand. why the increase in dangerous dogs? terrified of crime, 
americans are taking larger and more aggressive dogs into homes for 
protection. it's become such a problem that insurance companies are 
changing homeowner policies -- have a dangerous dog, and you may pay 
a premium or not get insurance at all. insurance experts estimate 
that dog bites cost society $1 billion a year. it cost cody fox his 
arm and almost his life. the dog grabbed me by the right ankle and 
pulled me down to the ground. and the other dogs grabbed my legs and 
my arms and starting eating me. but he doesn't blame the dogs. he 
blames their owner, who faces misdemeanor charges. cody believes it 
was attempted murder, part of an epidemic of violence that is killing 
and maiming the nation's children. mike boettcher, nbc news, los angeles.
