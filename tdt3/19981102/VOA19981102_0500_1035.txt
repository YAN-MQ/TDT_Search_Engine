And we'll have another item about the U.S. election coming up 23 minutes 
past the hour. You're listening to VOA News Now. I'm Charlene Porter 
along with Paul Westpheling. Ten hours, 18, universal time. Our top 
story: A White House strategy session later today will weigh the options 
for dealing with Iraq's refusal to cooperate with United Nations arms 
inspectors. Details later in the broadcast. Now it's time for sports.
