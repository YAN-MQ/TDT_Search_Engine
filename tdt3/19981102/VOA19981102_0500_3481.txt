OK, buy your tickets. Boy, there's something real different coming 
along for tourists to take a look at in South Dakota. That western 
U.S. state is probably best known for Mt. Rushmore, which, as you 
recall, is the big mountainside with the four presidents sculpted 
into the side of it. Well, now they got something totally new and 
different. Congress recently approved a measure that will turn a minute 
man missile silo into a facility that the public can visit. The decommissioned 
former site for ICBM, that's Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, 
will be preserved and turned over to the National Parks Service. U.S. 
Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota said more people need to learn 
about the Cold War and about the role missiles played in the nation's 
defense. The attraction in South Dakota although will not be the first 
national park missile base. A former Nike missile site near San Francisco, 
California is opened to visitors and contains a dummy anti-aircraft 
missile.
