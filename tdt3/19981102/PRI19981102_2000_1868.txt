There's been a further set back to the interim peace deal signed at 
Wye River between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israel Prime 
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has asked the Palestinians for more time 
to ratify the agreement. Paul Adams reports. This was the day when 
the elaborate 12-week timetable agreed in Washington should have begun. 
But Israel says it still needs time to ratify the new deal. The government 
of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is due to hold a vote tomorrow 
and the memorandum comes before Parliament next week. Mr. Netanyahu 
telephone the Palestinian leader Yassar Arafat this morning, requesting 
a delay. Mr. Arafat agreed. In the words of one Palestinian official, 
we do not want to give Israel any excuse not to implement the memorandum.
