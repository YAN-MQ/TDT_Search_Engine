Key races appear to be tightening as Democrats and Republicans make 
final appeals for votes before U.S. elections Tuesday. At stake is 
the makeup of Congress, which faces a decision of whether to impeach 
President Clinton over the White House sex and perjury scandal. Voters 
will choose 34 senators, all 435 members of the House of Representatives, 
and some 36 state governors. Republicans appear set to retain and 
perhaps increase their majority in both houses of the Congress. I'm
