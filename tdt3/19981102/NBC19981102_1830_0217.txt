in the hilly and mountainous terrain of central america, mudslides 
are the real danger after these kinds of rains. whole valleys swallowed 
up by rampaging mud, loosened by the torrential downpour. more on 
that phenomenon tonight from nbc's robert hager. mudslides -- unpredictable, 
and deadly. in colombia, south america, a single mudslide in 1985 
took 23,000 lives. in the u.s., mudslides ravaged the california coast 
during last winter's el nino. even in an average year in the u.s., 
mudslides cause $1 billion damage and kill 25 to 50 people. why so 
deadly? richard iverson, with the u.s. geological survey, studies 
slides by sending saturated mud down a huge chute the length of three 
football fields. he says a real one can be terrifying. it makes a 
lot of noise as it's approaching. you can hear trees snapping. you 
can hear rocks banging around and so forth. it might sound almost 
like a jet plane taking off. mudslides generally occur where slopes 
are steep and composed of already soft soil. that's why they frequently 
happen in mountains created by volcanoes. the triggering event -- 
drenching rain that saturates the soil with no place to drain -- in 
the case of central america, mitch a deadly disaster. commonly, people 
are engulfed by these things before they really have a chance to escape. 
death tolls are highest in developing nations, where impoverished 
shantytowns are unable to withstand the sudden sea of mud. but the 
california experience shows sometimes solidly built homes can be overwhelmed, 
as well. in nicaragua and honduras, vinchly everything in the mud's 
path wiped away. a storm so big, even the astronauts in the shuttle 
were watching it. the beauty of the clouds above, concealing the catastrophe 
below. robert hager, nbc news, houston.
