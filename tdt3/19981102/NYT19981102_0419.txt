Pity poor Pac-Man. Once loved by young children, the yellow blob is 
now little more than a campy joke as game companies chase aging customers 
with commercials for bloody gun battles and vivid hard tackles. But 
if Pac-Man himself is not on the rebound, he may at least have some 
younger siblings on the way as game makers look to a long-forgotten 
market: young children. ``Now is the time to go after the younger 
market,'' said Andrew House, vice president for marketing at Sony 
Computer Entertainment. Just how young children came to be viewed 
as a new audience at Sony explains much of the cyclical nature, not 
to mention forgetfulness, of the industry's marketers. As far as the 
industry is concerned, home video game players grew up on Sept. 9, 
1995, the day Sony released the Playstation. The system was the first 
marketed directly at 18- to 35-year-olds with advertisements on programs 
like ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``The Simpsons.'' Three years to 
the day had passed when House stood before his board with a presentation 
acknowledging the need for an ad shift. To capture new audiences, 
House proposed advertising during holiday specials like ``Frosty the 
Snowman'' and the Thanksgiving Day parade as well as on Nickelodeon 
and the Cartoon Network. The new wave of games vying for the Saturday 
morning cartoon set includes Tomba, a simple, colorful adventure game 
that appeals to younger customers much the way Nintendo's Super Mario 
Brothers once did. ``That's not the kind of game you would have seen 
two years ago,'' said Sean McGowan, an analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison 
Inc., a New York investment firm. ``It was Japanese animation, sexy-looking 
women and lots of shooting.'' The early Atari games bought by adults 
as a fad and taken up in earnest by their children touched off a stampede. 
In 1991, Sega of America and Nintendo of America released the first 
16-bit machines, offering children's games like Super Mario Brothers 
and sports games with ever-better graphics. Then came Playstation. 
While Sega swaggered across late-night television with pitches for 
bone-crunching hits in its football games and all manner of savagery 
in its fighting games, Sony pinpointed technology aficionados with 
a campaign one former executive described as ``viral marketing.'' 
Jim Wimms, former vice president for marketing at Sony Computer Entertainment, 
said the company used radio and print ads only serious game players 
would understand, counting on word of mouth to spread the system's 
popularity. In doing so, Sony avoided the traditional children's market, 
fearing that games that appeal to a young audience would be anathema 
to technology enthusiasts. ``When you try to be all things to all 
people,'' Wimms said, ``you end up being absolutely nothing.'' The 
system has by no means been a flop. Home video game systems and their 
hand-held spinoffs generated around $5.1 billion in domestic sales 
for 1997, and sales are expected to reach $6.3 billion for 1998, according 
to NPD Research, a market tracking firm in New York City. Playstation 
alone accounts for 60 percent to 70 percent of the market, analysts 
said. But to build that following, Sony pursued a strategy that depended 
on ``aspirational gamers'' _ little brothers and sisters _ while not 
marketing directly to them. Sony is walking on gilded splinters as 
it tries to expand its market to include younger game players while 
retaining credibility among technology enthusiasts and other older 
players. Because technology reinvents the market every few years, 
the little brothers and sisters do not have time to fall in love with 
their siblings' systems, said Chris Charla, editor in chief of Next 
Generation, a trade magazine based in Brisbane, Calif. ``You can't 
stay cool for that many years,'' Charla said, adding that younger 
customers are the only place to go for Sony's competitors. But that 
may not be where they will go. Nintendo, historically the system of 
choice with younger players because of games like Super Mario Brothers, 
is fighting for a larger share of the 18 and older market. George 
Harrison, vice president for marketing, said Nintendo was putting 
half its ads in magazines like Vibe and Rolling Stone and on ESPN 
and other sports programs. In 1991, 90 percent of its ad budget was 
aimed at children 14 and under. The company spends around $200 million 
annually on marketing, including $70 to $75 million on television 
commercials. As those two companies' marketing strategists debate 
how to attract older casual players to Nintendo and young children 
as well as casual adult players to Sony, the elephant in the room 
is Sega's release of a new system called Dreamcast, planned for the 
fall of 1999. If successful, it could start the industry cycle over 
again, forcing Sony to drop Playstation's price and head back to the 
drawing board. ``I don't think anyone purposefully sets out to say, 
`I want this one group,''' said Dan Stevens, director of public relations 
for Sega. ``People are not viewing games as kids' toys anymore. They're 
viewing them as a substantial form of entertainment that anybody can 
enjoy.'' Age groups aside, all three companies are making concerted 
efforts to expand the popularity of home video games among casual 
users. ``These are the guys who wait until it costs $99 or $129 and 
only buy four or five games and maybe rent some from Blockbuster,'' 
Charla said. Sports fans make up a sizable easy target in that market 
because they can be cornered during immensely popular live-broadcast 
games as well as on cable networks. For the industry as a whole, marketing 
revolves around the fact that each new system must first appeal to 
a niche market, then quickly seep in as a mainstream industry leader. 
The console companies and their outside software contractors all depend 
on mainstream credibility to market products to customers of different 
ages and levels of enthusiasm. ``What the history of the video game 
business tells you is that the most important factor in the system's 
popularity is the software available for that system,'' said Doug 
Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association, 
a trade group in Washington. ``It's become much more of a science 
now to market these products.''
