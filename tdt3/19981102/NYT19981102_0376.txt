President Clinton predicted on Monday that Iraq's decision to end 
all cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors would backfire. He said 
the move had unified the international community in condemnation of 
President Saddam Hussein's government. Clinton sent Defense Secretary 
William Cohen to the Middle East and Europe to consult with allies 
about options for a response to Iraq's action. Senior administration 
officials said the options included an American military strike on 
Iraq to force it to comply with the weapons inspections. Clinton left 
open the possibility of military action after meeting at the White 
House on Monday with his top national security advisers to discuss 
the latest in a series of showdowns with Iraq. ``Until the inspectors 
are back, no options are off the table,'' Clinton said, interrupting 
a White House event on health care to discuss the situation in Iraq. 
He added, ``Saddam Hussein's latest refusal to cooperate with the 
international weapons inspectors is completely unacceptable.'' ``Once 
again, though, it will backfire,'' he said. ``Far from dividing the 
international community and achieving concessions, his obstructionism 
was immediately and unanimously condemned by the U.N. Security Council. 
It has only served to deepen the international community's resolve. 
``For Iraq, the only path to lifting sanctions is through complete 
cooperation with the weapons inspectors _ with no restrictions, runarounds 
or roadblocks.'' Despite Iraq's announcement on Saturday that it was 
ending all cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors, the United 
Nations reported that inspectors had been allowed to carry out some 
minor monitoring work on Monday and that the Iraqi government had 
made no move to expel any inspectors. ``They haven't thrown our people 
out, and they haven't told us to pull out our cameras or technical 
sensors,'' said Charles Duelfer, deputy executive chairman of the 
U.N. Special Commission. ``The fact that they didn't expel us indicates 
that they are still interested in discussing this.'' The commission 
is charged with enforcing Iraq's compliance with Security Council 
resolutions calling for it to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. 
Clinton administration officials said that despite the tougher language 
from the White House on Monday, no military action against Iraq was 
imminent. Several officials said they were not convinced that Iraq 
would follow through on its threat of shutting down the entire weapons 
inspection program, a move that they agreed would almost certainly 
result in a devastating military response from the United States. 
``No one would be surprised if this was another bluff from Saddam,'' 
said a senior administration official. ``However, if it's not a bluff, 
then we have a true crisis on our hands. Then we have to start thinking 
seriously about a military attack.'' The White House said that Clinton 
had weighed his options in dealing with Iraq during his meeting Monday 
with Defense Secretary Cohen; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; 
Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser; Gen. Hugh Shelton, 
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and George J. Tenet, the 
director of Central Intelligence. ``The president and his team reviewed 
and discussed potential options for next steps,'' said Joe Lockhart, 
the White House spokesman. ``No decisions were made beyond the president 
asking the secretary of defense to travel to Europe and to the region 
to consult with our allies.'' Asked if military strikes were among 
the options discussed, Lockhart replied, ``All options are on the 
table, and that means all options are on the table.'' The Pentagon 
declined to make public the itinerary of Cohen, who will be traveling 
with Undersecretary of State Thomas R. Pickering. But aides to both 
men said they were likely to visit Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, where 
the United States has maintained a sizable military force since the 
Persian Gulf war of 1991. For now, officials said, the administration's 
attention was focused on the United Nations, where the Security Council 
is expected to vote shortly on a resolution to condemn Iraq's latest 
action. ``The next step is clearly for the council to make clear that 
this is unacceptable, that this decision is in flagrant violation 
of the requirements of the Security Council,'' said James P. Rubin, 
the State Department spokesman. The administration has been heartened 
by the quick condemnation of Iraq's action by France and Russia, two 
permanent members of the Security Council that have sought in the 
the past to loosen the sanctions on Iraq.
