The parents of baby Matthew Eppen are demanding a payment of several 
million dollars from the British au pair convicted of his manslaughter. 
But Louise Woodward says she cannot afford to contest the case. Jane 
Hughes reports. Matthew Eppens parents are seeking a payment of several 
million dollars, both in compensation for the death of their baby 
and in punitive damages. said all we have left of Mattie is an empty 
place in our family and memories. Louise Woodward hasn't contested 
the civil case because she can't afford legal representation. So the 
Eppens have won by default and the judge simply has to decide how 
much she should be liable for. They know their former au pair doesn't 
have that much money, but they want to make sure she doesn't profit 
from selling her story. Jane Hughes, BBC, New York.
