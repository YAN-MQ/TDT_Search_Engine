As rescue workers throughout Central America struggled Monday to reach 
scores of remote peasant settlements left battered and isolated by 
Hurricane Mitch, authorities in Nicaragua and Honduras said the combined 
death toll from the storm and its aftermath was likely to surpass 
7,000. ``There are corpses everywhere _ victims of landslides or of 
the waters,'' Carlos Flores Facusse, the president of Honduras, said 
in a grim television address on Monday afternoon after a thorough 
inspection tour of his stunned and beleaguered nation of 4 million 
people. ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin 
throughout the entire country.'' There also were reports of numerous 
deaths and widespread damage to property and crops in El Salvador 
and Guatemala from the storm and the torrential rains and region-wide 
flooding that followed. The unusual late-season storm was being classified 
as one of the worst natural disasters to strike the region in modern 
times, perhaps even eclipsing the devastating earthquakes that leveled 
this city in 1972 and flattened parts of Guatemala in 1976. ``I have 
seen earthquakes, droughts, two wars, cyclones and tidal waves,'' 
said Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Roman Catholic archbishop 
of Managua and the nation's senior religious figure. ``But this is 
undoubtedly the worst thing that I have ever seen.'' At its peak, 
Hurricane Mitch packed 180 mph winds, making it a deadly category 
five storm, the most powerful on the Saffir-Simpson scale. But it 
had a compact eye and was on a course that kept it out over the Caribbean 
Sea and the Gulf of Honduras, far away from population and agricultural 
centers. The hurricane turned deadly as it disintegrated, though. 
It was blocked from moving northward by a powerful front over the 
Gulf of Mexico and was stalled for six days, a pattern that Max Mayfield 
of the National Hurricane Center in Miami called ``extremely unusual.'' 
It dumped as much as two feet of rain a day throughout the region, 
inundating not just coastal and mountain areas, but also large cities 
bisected by rivers whose flow was swollen far beyond their normal 
capacity. In Honduras alone, ``the number of dead could surpass 5,000,'' 
Lt. Col. Saul Castillo, a member of that country's Civil Defense Commission, 
estimated on Monday. But another relief official, Dimas Alonzo of 
the Honduran National Emergency Committee, acknowledged in a radio 
interview: ``We will probably never know how many people died.'' Here 
in Nicaragua, the focal point of rescue efforts Monday was the region 
of Posoltega, at the foot of the Casitas Volcano, about 50 miles northwest 
of the capital, in the province of Chinandega. At least 800 people 
have been confirmed dead in a series of mud slides over the weekend 
there, and another 2,000 people are reported missing and are feared 
dead. ``We could hear people buried in the debris imploring us to 
help them,'' said one shaken resident-turned-rescue worker, who would 
give his name only as Nicolas. ``But there was nothing we could do 
for them. It was the most impotent I have ever felt in my life.'' 
Relief workers who arrived in the area on Sunday said that perhaps 
as much as 30 square miles had been affected by the mudslides, which 
entombed at least five peasant villages. ``It's like a wilderness 
there now,'' Rosa Caballero, a survivor who was evacuated to a nearby 
hospital, said Monday. ``You don't see anything.'' On Monday, soldiers, 
relief workers and evacuees, many of whom were visibly disturbed by 
what they had seen, used phrases like ``a vision out of Dante'' or 
``a deluge of Biblical proportions'' to describe the destruction. 
Somber news reports on Nicaraguan television showed bodies half-buried 
in mud or pinned against tree trunks or tiny limbs protruding stiffly 
from piles of debris. ``There are lots of children dead,'' said Graciela 
Saenz, a relief worker who has been in the area. ``It's horrible.'' 
The devastation is so extensive that Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Barrios, 
the country's minister of defense, said that it may be impossible 
ever to obtain an accurate count of fatalities. For that reason, he 
recommended in a report made public Monday that ``it would be appropriate 
to declare the area of the tragedy a `national cemetery''' and seal 
it off. Even as they struggled to mobilize military and Red Cross 
units, government officials and disaster relief experts throughout 
the region warned that more problems were on the way. The difficulty 
in recovering the bodies of human victims and the widespread destruction 
of livestock was rapidly creating the danger of epidemics of cholera, 
dengue fever and other diseases, they said. The growing shortage of 
food and water in rural areas cut off from the rest of the country 
was equally alarming. Many warehouses where foodstuffs were stored 
have been destroyed, roads that would normally bring goods from commercial 
centers are impassable, and crops of beans, bananas, vegetables and 
coffee have been largely washed away. In both Nicaragua and Honduras, 
nearly every bridge was reported to have suffered damage of some sort, 
with perhaps a majority left unusable. On both sides of the border 
between the two countries, traffic is backed up for miles, with some 
truck drivers reporting that they have been stuck in one spot for 
six days, sleeping in their cabs and depending on the generosity of 
local people for food. In Washington, the U.S. Agency for International 
Development announced that it was providing $3.5 million in emergency 
assistance as a first step in recovery efforts. ``We'll be looking 
at what else we can do,'' President Clinton said. Flores, the Honduran 
leader, has estimated that 70 percent of the infrastructure in his 
country, already the poorest in the Western Hemisphere other than 
Haiti, has been destroyed. Bridges, roads, communications, ports, 
hospitals and schools have all been so seriously affected that it 
will take years for the economy to recover, he said. ``This country 
has been struck a severe blow in every sense,'' he said on Monday. 
``There's practically no place or region that has not been affected.'' 
To cope with that deteriorating situation and the outbreaks of looting 
that it has triggered, Flores announced a ``state of exception'' on 
Monday afternoon allowing the temporary suspension of some civil liberties. 
The measure will give the police the right to unlimited searches and 
seizures of property, as well as expanded powers to detain suspects. 
``The floods and landslides have erased many villages and households 
from the map, as well as whole neighborhoods of cities,'' he said. 
``I ask the international community for human solidarity.''
