An internal memorandum reflecting the views of some of Microsoft Corp.'s 
top executives and software development managers reveals deep concern 
about the threat of free software and proposes a number of strategies 
for competing against free programs that have recently been gaining 
in popularity. The memo warns that the quality of free software can 
meet or exceed that of commercial programs and describes it as a potentially 
serious threat to Microsoft. The document was sent anonymously last 
week to Eric Raymond, a key figure in a loosely knit group of software 
developers who collaboratively create and distribute free programs 
ranging from operating systems to Web browsers. Microsoft executives 
acknowledged on Monday that the document was authentic. Edmund Muth, 
Microsoft's Enterprise Marketing Group manager, said it had been widely 
disseminated among employees who were interested in the threat posed 
to Microsoft by Linux, a highly regarded version of the Unix operating 
system that is distributed free. While Muth took issue with some of 
the memo's points, he said that its author, Vinod Valloppillil, a 
Microsoft software engineer, was a close friend and that he agreed 
with most aspects of his analysis. In addition to acknowledging that 
free programs can compete with commercial software in terms of quality, 
the memorandum calls the free software movement a ``long-term credible'' 
threat and warns that employing a traditional Microsoft marketing 
strategy known as ``FUD,'' an acronym for ``fear, uncertainty and 
doubt,'' will not succeed against the developers of free software. 
The memorandum also voices concern that Linux is rapidly becoming 
the dominant version of Unix for computers powered by Intel microprocessors. 
The competitive issues, the note warns, go beyond the fact that the 
software is free. It is also part of the open-source software, or 
O.S.S., movement, which encourages widespread, rapid development efforts 
by making the source code _ that is, the original lines of code written 
by programmers _ readily available to anyone. This enables programmers 
the world over to continually write or suggest improvements or to 
warn of bugs that need to be fixed. The memorandum notes that open 
software presents a threat because of its ability to mobilize thousands 
of programmers. ``The ability of the O.S.S. process to collect and 
harness the collective I.Q. of thousands of individuals across the 
Internet is simply amazing,'' the memo states. ``More importantly, 
O.S.S. evangelization scales with the size of the Internet much faster 
than our own evangelization efforts appear to scale.'' In computer-speak, 
this means that the growth of the Internet is producing a far more 
efficient medium for collaboration on open programming than for marketing 
traditional, proprietary software. The memo is on the Web at http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html 
with annotations by Raymond, the author of a treatise in defense of 
free software titled ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar.'' Its appearance 
touched off immediate speculation among programmers both about the 
timing of the leak and the content of the memorandum. Microsoft is 
locked in a court battle with the U.S. Justice Department over business 
practices it has developed around its monopoly operating system, Windows. 
On Monday, a number of the company's critics speculated that the release 
of the memo might be timed to suggest that while Windows is shipped 
on more than 90 percent of all personal computers sold today _ and 
while Microsoft programs dominate dozens of markets _ the software 
giant faces real competition.
