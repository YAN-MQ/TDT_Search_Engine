Officials in Nicaragua and Honduras say they fear more than 7,000 
people may have died in flooding and mudslides triggered by former 
Hurricane Mitch. Honduran officials say 5,000 people could have been 
killed in their country from the powerful storm. And Nicaragua authorities 
estimate 2100 deaths with 1500 people fear killed in mudslides that 
swept away several villages. Scores of deaths are also reported in 
El Salvador and Guatemala. Hurricane Mitch swept through the Caribbean 
late last week but weakened Sunday.
