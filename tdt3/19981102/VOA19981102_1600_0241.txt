Turkish officials say they have foiled plans by a Turkish Islamic 
group to carry out a suicide attack at the mausoleum of the founder 
of secular Turkey. Istanbul's governor says police detained 23 members 
of a German based group which planned to crash a plane loaded with 
explosives in the mausoleum of Mustafa Kamal Attaturk. The governor 
says Turkey is starting procedures to extradite the group's suspected 
leader from Germany.
