videotaped testimony from chairman, bill gates, was played today in 
the antitrust lawsuit against microsoft. the government hopes the 
testimony will show the company used strong-arm tactics against competitors. 
marsha walton has more on the complex image of microsoft's high-profile 
chief. the many faces of microsoft magnate bill gates. the internet 
is bursting with sites that slam the nation's richest man. cyber disdain 
and jealousy fuel the mantra of "let him have it." real-life critics 
at new york's cyber cafe are a little more articulate about their 
beefs with gates. i know that he has nothing original to bring to 
the table, because i've used his product. maybe it's his billions, 
maybe it's the stereotype of the computer nerd that causes some people 
to cheer when something goes wrong for gates like when a demonstration 
of windows '98 crashed at a chicago computer show. whoaaa! there are 
spoof sites and parodies of microsoft, also a web site where you can 
keep track of gates personal wealth -- somewhere around $60 billion 
right now. some critics compare gates to the devil. in english spanish 
german and portuguese. and some web sites resort to vulgarities which 
we can't show here. in an online column on the world's love/hate relationship 
with the software giant, pc week's michael surkan wrote that since 
the days of the roman empire, people in power have attracted inevitable 
hostility. that modest defense of microsoft prompted more than a thousand 
hate e-mails in reply. gates has some online supporters. the libertarian 
party calls him a national hero. and this site compares his influence 
to that of david sarnoff, who faced many critics as he guided the 
early days of television. and sometimes there is passion among gates 
supporters. it's the next best thing to sliced bread. it wasn't sliced 
bread but a cream pie that greeted gates in belgium early this year, 
and it's another face of bill gates parodied on the internet.
