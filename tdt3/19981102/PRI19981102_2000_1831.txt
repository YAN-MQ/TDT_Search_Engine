For the World the latest crisis with Iraq. On Saturday, Baghdad announced 
it was halting cooperation with the United Nations weapons inspectors. 
Iraq said the move is aimed at getting UN sanctions lifted rather 
than an attempt to provoke a confrontation. Iraqi deputy prime minister 
Terik Aziz says it's up to the UN to resolve the impasse. The hardships 
of the Iraqi people are still in place and there is no any clear prospect 
for lifting them. Simply why do you continue this kind of cooperation? 
It's futile. Iraqi deputy prime minister Terik Aziz.
