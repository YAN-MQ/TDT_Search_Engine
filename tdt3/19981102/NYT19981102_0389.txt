Stock prices continued to plow ahead Monday as investors gained more 
confidence that the days and weeks of instability that were the norm 
from mid-July until late September are over. ``Everything is good 
right now, for now,'' one stock trader said. ``There is a continued 
belief the Fed will ease interest rates again,'' he added. ``Foreign 
markets are stable. There is not a lot of new supply because there 
are not any deals. And mutual-fund inflows continue.'' Once again, 
equities turned in a broad-based advance. The Dow Jones industrial 
average Monday rose 114.05 points, or 1.33 percent, to 8,706.15. It 
was the fourth consecutive session to end with a gain for the blue-chip 
gauge and the first time it has closed above 8,700 points since Aug. 
18. For the year, the Dow is up slightly more than 10 percent. Among 
broader market measures, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index 
gained 12.93 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,111.60. The NASDAQ composite 
index rose 29.52 points, or 1.67 percent, to 1,800.91. And the Russell 
2000 index of small-company stocks gained 8.66 points, or 2.3 percent, 
to 386.82. For the second consecutive session, investors bought stocks 
despite a sharp rise in market interest rates. Rates rose on all manner 
of Treasury securities Monday. The price of the benchmark 30-year 
Treasury bond fell by more than a point, and the yield rose to 5.25 
percent, its highest level in six weeks. Analysts said the recent 
selloff in the government debt market was a sign that investors were 
increasingly confident that conditions no longer warranted the safety 
of Treasury notes and bonds. ``By and large, the Treasury bond market 
got way ahead of itself in terms of being a flight-to-quality haven,'' 
said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. 
``Now, money is redistributing itself among all financial markets. 
If people start getting nervous again, it may reverse.'' Fine said 
that developments over the last week had slightly altered what had 
been a near-unanimous view in the credit markets that the Federal 
Reserve will cut interest rates again later this month. In the stock 
market, however, that view is still widely if not universally held. 
Moreover, there is little doubt that the Fed's decision to cut rates 
in late September and again last month has been vitally significant 
to the stock market's rally. ``The key thing is that we now have financial 
leadership worldwide, led by the Fed,'' said Jack Shaughnessy, chief 
investment strategist at Advest Inc. in Boston. In a weekly letter 
sent to clients Monday, analysts at International Strategy and Investment 
noted that concerns about the world financial crisis prompted 17 central 
banks, including the Fed, to cut interest rates last month. Six countries 
that lowered rates are European, and those cuts have helped reinvigorate 
stock markets on the continent. Most European markets posted strong 
gains Monday, with indexes in Britain, France and Germany all rising 
by more than 1 percent. Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading 
at Credit Suisse First Boston, said that American equities had benefited 
from what has been happening in Europe. The Western European markets, 
he said, ``are picking up steam as we move toward the end of the year 
and the birth of the European monetary union. That has given support 
to all industrialized country markets.'' Worries that a global economic 
downturn would hurt companies that rely on overseas sales for a big 
part of their profits helped to lower share prices of many multinational 
companies through the last six weeks of the summer. Those concerns 
have abated somewhat, and the stocks are beginning to rebound. On 
Monday, Coca-Cola, which relies on foreign sales for more than 75 
percent of its profits, was the Dow's best-performing issue. Coke 
rose 3 7/16 a share, to 71. Boeing, another Dow stock, gained 3}, 
to 41 5/16. A third Dow component, Citigroup, fell ~ a share, to 46[, 
after James Dimon, co-chief of its investment banking unit and the 
presumed heir apparent to Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup's co-chairman, 
abruptly announced his resignation. Takeover stocks were big gainers 
on Monday. Sofamor Danek Group, a surgical equipment maker, rose 8{ 
a share, to 110[, after it agreed to be acquired by Medtronic Inc., 
one of the world's biggest manufacturers of pacemakers, in a stock 
deal valued at $3.6 billion, or $115 a share. Medtronic shares rose 
1 9/16, to 66 9/16. Boole &AMP; Babbage Inc. gained 3{, to 30[, after 
BMC Software Inc., a leading maker of software to manage programs 
on computer networks, agreed to buy the company for about $900 million 
in stock, or $32.44 a share, based on Friday's closing prices. BMC 
shares fell 2, to 46 1/16. Among other NASDAQ stocks, Intel rose 2| 
a share, to 91 13/16. And Cisco Systems, which is expected to report 
its third-quarter results on Wednesday, gained 1 11/16, to 64 11/16.
