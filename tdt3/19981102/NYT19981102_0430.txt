With Clifford the Big Red Dog hovering above, nearly 100 volunteers 
for Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade struggled recently toward a degree 
in ``balloonology.'' In unison, they took five steps to the right, 
then three to the left. They unrolled their spools of line exactly 
six revolutions, then five more. They pranced around an empty soccer 
field in Hoboken, pretending it was Broadway. ``You are now entering 
Columbus Circle,'' the team captain shouted. Again and again, the 
team practiced emergency drills _ pulling the balloon almost to ground 
level and rapidly unzipping parts of the inflated character to let 
the air out. These volunteers and the hundreds of others who will 
handle the giant balloons in the parade were literally learning the 
ropes of a vastly changed job. After last year's disastrous parade 
_ when high winds played havoc with the balloons and a spectator was 
seriously hurt after an out-of-control Cat in the Hat sent part of 
a lamppost plunging to the street _ Macy's, under strong pressure 
from the city, has revamped its procedures. ``They're making sure 
that everything is understood, that nobody can make a mistake,'' said 
Michael Lynch, a three-year parade veteran and a senior at Stevens 
Institute of Technology in Hoboken, where one of 14 all-day balloon 
training sessions was held on Oct. 25. In past years, he and others 
recalled training lasting, at most, an hour or two. Besides adhering 
to stricter guidelines on how balloons are handled _ including volunteers' 
passing a physical fitness test, not to mention physics _ the 72-year-old 
parade will undergo other major changes. Street lights along the route 
will be replaced or modified; balloons will be tethered to 800-pound 
utility vehicles for extra security; a meteorologist will be on hand 
to determine if winds are dangerously high, and more team supervisors 
will accompany each balloon to better monitor the floating procession. 
The changes came at the direction of a 12-member mayoral panel that 
was formed after serious problems plagued last year's event, when 
winds averaged 26.5 mph, with gusts up to 43 mph, and handlers fought 
in vain to hold down Barney, the Pink Panther and other wildly lurching 
balloons. Kathleen Caronna, a 34-year-old woman from New York, was 
struck by the shattered lamppost and remained in a coma for nearly 
a month. Caronna has sued the city, Macy's and the manufacturer of 
the lamppost. After the accident, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani demanded 
major changes in the parade, openly wondering whether balloons should 
be banned. On Tuesday, the mayor plans to meet with his aides to complete 
the plans, which also include banning balloons in winds exceeding 
23 mph and balloons more than 70 feet high or 78 feet long.
