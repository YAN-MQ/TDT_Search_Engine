Looking like the runner he is in Adidas warm-ups and Asics athletic 
shoes, Jose Cruz was strolling down Seventh Avenue on Monday morning 
in search of a few souvenirs to carry home to Bayamon, Puerto Rico. 
The day before, the 59-year-old Cruz had completed his second New 
York City Marathon in 3 hours 14 minutes _ good enough to qualify 
in the 60-and-over age group for next year's Boston Marathon, which 
he plans to run. ``This is my second New York City Marathon,'' said 
Cruz, who arrived in the city last Thursday and was booked on a 3 
p.m. flight to Puerto Rico on Monday. ``There are 20 of us here. We 
belong to a runners group back home, and I did better than guys half 
my age.'' All along Central Park West and South on Monday were pleasant, 
colorful reminders and remains of Sunday's 26.2-mile race, from the 
metal bleachers and blue wooden police barricades, to the winter-green 
Royal Flush portable toilets. Red, blue, green, yellow and black balloons 
were still hovering above the 59th Street entrance to the park, serving 
as a beacon for any stragglers. They signaled home Zoe Koplowitz, 
who has multiple sclerosis, as she finished her 11th consecutive New 
York City Marathon on Monday afternoon, more than 31 hours after she 
stepped onto the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Stopping every two hours 
for diabetes blood tests and walking overnight with two custom-made 
canes and an unreal perseverance, Koplowitz was greeted by about 60 
friends and fans as she crossed the finish line. None less than Carl 
Lewis, the nine-time Olympic gold medalist, complimented her feat. 
``What she's done is an illustration to all of us that it's not enough 
to be good, you have to have the will and determination to be the 
best,'' Lewis said. He just happened to be in Central Park as a host 
to a Nike-sponsored event in which 200 New York City schoolchildren 
got to meet five elite runners, among them the marathoner Tegla Loroupe, 
who had been their Internet pen pals. John Kagwe of Kenya, who won 
the men's race, and Franca Fiacconi of Italy, the winner of the women's 
race, spent Monday figuratively on the run. In the morning, the two 
were given the keys to the city by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at City 
Hall. Then, it was the Official All-Star Cafe in Times Square for 
a celebratory lunch. Some of the rest of the field was lingering in 
the lobby of the Wellington Hotel, which at times looked like Sunday's 
finish-line chutes. Women and men in various states and styles of 
athletic wear waited in line at the front desk to check out. Most 
were wearing or carrying mementos from Sunday: a 1998 marathon cap, 
their blue-and-orange-beribboned finishers' medals, a badge from Saturday 
night's Ronzoni pasta party at Tavern on the Green. Nestled in a lobby 
chair with his Nike-clad feet atop his suitcase was Edwin Melendez 
Jr. Melendez was headed back to Corpus Christi, Texas, on a 1:50 p.m. 
flight. His father, Dr. Edwin Melendez Sr., who had coaxed his son 
to run his first New York City Marathon and had just completed his 
fourth, would occupy the aisle seat. His uncle, Ernesto Melendez, 
was headed back to San Juan, Puerto Rico. ``It's a family affair,'' 
Edwin Jr. said. ``My aunt, Roxanna, also ran.'' Unlike the rest of 
the Melendez clan, she did not have a flight to catch: she lives in 
New York.
