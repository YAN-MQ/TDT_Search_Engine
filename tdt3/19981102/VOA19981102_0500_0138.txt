Israel says it is lifting its closure on Palestinian territories completely 
today, the day that the last U.S. brokered peace accord with the Palestinians 
go into effect. The Israeli Army calls the action a good will gesture 
that will allow at least 60,000 Palestinians who have jobs in Israel 
to enter from the West Bank in Gaza Strip. Israel says the decision 
to lift the closure was made in light of steps taken by the Palestinian 
authority in recent days against anti-Israeli militants.
