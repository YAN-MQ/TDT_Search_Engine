Two days after the killing of a Roman Catholic man here, Prime Minister 
Bertie Ahern of the Irish Republic conferred with Catholic and Protestant 
leaders of the new Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday in an attempt 
to restart the stalled Ulster peace effort. But the daylong meetings 
were clearly also an attempt to allay fears that the shooting death 
of the man, Brian Service, apparently by a Protestant splinter guerrilla 
group, would lead to renewed violence. That would further delay the 
resolution of political disputes that have impeded the peace effort 
since April, when the politicians and the Irish and British governments 
approved an agreement to end sectarian warfare between the Protestant 
majority and the Catholic minority in the British province. Before 
the talking began at Parliament in the Stormont area Ahern said: ``We 
really have to move things, and today everybody has to say: `Let us 
keep moving. Vacuums are dangerous.' The events of this weekend showed 
that. What we have to do is concentrate our minds, make the compromises, 
put in the effort and keep it moving.'' David Trimble, the Protestant 
first minister of the assembly and Seamus Mallon, his Catholic deputy, 
said in a statement, ``If this murder is designed to derail the peace 
then it will fail.'' At a break in the talks this evening Ahern and 
Trimble said the discussions were positive and helpful. They did not, 
however, predict imminent solutions and mostly discussed less contentious 
areas like tourism, agriculture and transportation. Billy Hutchinson, 
a former guerrilla and convict who has won bipartisan respect as an 
official of a party in the assembly, the Progressive Unionists, expressed 
doubt. Hutchinson, who still has contact with Protestant paramilitary 
groups, said that if the killers were a splinter of the Loyalists 
Volunteer Force ``we can expect more killings, and I would advise 
all people in north Belfast to be on their guard.'' No arrests have 
been made in the killing, for which a group that calls itself the 
Red Hand Defenders, a splinter from the Loyalist Volunteers, has claimed 
responsibility. The main Protestant paramilitary groups have been 
observing a cease-fire since October 1994. The overwhelmingly Catholic 
Irish Republican Army has been observing a cease-fire for 16 months. 
The IRA refusal to disarm has provoked the main disputes. Trimble, 
as head of the assembly, says the IRA political wing, Sinn Fein, may 
not fully take part in the new provisional government until the IRA 
begins to disarm. Sinn Fein has said it will seek to persuade the 
IRA not to retaliate for the killing on Saturday.
