Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat has agreed to Israel's request to 
postpone the start of their new peace agreement for a few days. Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says implementation cannot start 
until Israel's Cabinet and parliament ratify the accord. The Cabinet 
is expected to discuss the agreement Tuesday but Israel's parliament 
will not vote on it until next week. The U.S. brokered accord was 
to go into effect Monday.
