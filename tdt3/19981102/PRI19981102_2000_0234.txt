Hurricane Mitch may have killed as many as 7000 people in central 
America. The chief of emergency services in Honduras said the exact 
death toll will never be known, but he estimated that floods and mud 
slides triggered by the storm killed at least 5000 people in his country. 
Officials in northern Nicaragua fear that as many as 1500 people may 
have perished in mudslides on the slopes of a volcano.
