Well, how would you like to own a part of the best selling single 
of all time? That, of course, is Elton John's "Candle in the Wind 
1997" tribute to Princess Diana. The George Martin musical score for 
the piece is going to be auctioned off for charity in December and 
is expected to fetch about $100,000. Not bad for a musical arrangement 
that the legendary Beatles producer says was written in a great hurry.
