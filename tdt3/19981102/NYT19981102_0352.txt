BOSTON _ ``How can this be in America?'' Julie Hiatt Steele asked. 
``It's not the country I thought I lived in.'' Ms. Steele is an obscure 
person _ a nobody, as she says. But she has become a target of Kenneth 
Starr, and that has changed her life. She has been threatened by Starr's 
prosecutors and shouted at by FBI agents. She, her daughter, her brother 
and her former lawyer have been called before a grand jury. Her tax 
returns, bank records, credit report and telephone records have been 
subpoenaed. All this has happened because Ms. Steele once was a friend 
of Kathleen Willey, who said President Clinton made a pass at her 
in the White House in 1993. Ms. Willey said she was so upset that 
she went to Ms. Steele's home that night and told her what had happened. 
In March 1997 Ms. Steele told Newsweek, which was looking into the 
story, that she had had that visit from Ms. Willey. But in August 
of that year _ before its report was published, and five months before 
the Monica Lewinsky story broke _ she told Newsweek that she had lied 
at Ms. Willey's request, that there had been no such visit. She has 
stuck to that position ever since. This matters to Starr because he 
wants to send the House Judiciary Committee another reason to impeach 
Clinton: that he lied in denying the pass at Kathleen Willey. Ms. 
Steele stands in the way of that objective. So Starr is trying to 
break her, suggesting that she was paid or pressured into calling 
the Willey story false. I telephoned Julie Steele after reading an 
article about her situation by Jill Abramson in The New York Times. 
She is 52 years old, divorced, and lives in Richmond, Va., with Adam, 
the 8-year-old son she adopted in Romania in 1990. Last March she 
was visited by two FBI agents working for the Starr office. ``They 
yelled at me,'' Ms. Steele said. They assumed her guilt, asking her 
who made her do it. In June she was subpoenaed to go before the Starr 
grand jury in Washington. She was told she was being called as a witness 
_ but afterward, retroactively, they said she was a target. In five 
hours of questioning she was asked mostly about Newsweek. There were 
virtually no questions about Ms. Willey. At one point in that grand 
jury appearance, Ms. Steele said, she asked if she could speak with 
her lawyer, Nancy Luque _ a request that prosecutors routinely honor. 
``They said that if I continued doing that, I might be obstructing 
justice.'' In August Ms. Steele was subpoenaed again. This time Ms. 
Luque advised her to invoke her privilege against forced self-incrimination. 
Justice Department rules say prosecutors should not call people who 
intend to rely on the Fifth Amendment, but the Starr prosecutors insisted 
she go before the grand jury and invoke it. Last month Starr's office 
told the Judiciary Committee that it was still considering other possible 
grounds for impeachment. After that, there was another flurry of actions 
against Ms. Steele. The subpoenas went out for her family members 
and former lawyer; the prosecutors said the attorney-client privilege 
did not apply. (Starr has tried to destroy that privilege in case 
after case.) Her 30-year-old daughter, Liza, was asked in the grand 
jury about the fact that she stayed with her mother last spring. Why 
hadn't she paid rent? Then FBI agents questioned Ms. Steele's neighbors. 
They asked about her finances and about her adoption of Adam, which 
they seemed to suggest was illegal. In fact Ms. Steele went through 
Romanian and then, to be meticulous, Virginia legal proceedings. For 
a prosecutor's agents to hound an American mother for rescuing one 
of the innocent victims of Romania's communist horror seems to me 
about as low as you can get. Starr's people never asked Ms. Steele 
about Adam. They just wanted to poison the atmosphere, to intimidate 
her. ``I'm here alone, lost,'' Ms. Steele said. ``I'm not a public 
person. I don't have that support system, and I'm being beaten to 
death.'' Some people brush off, as unimportant, the bullying means 
used in Starr's pursuit of Clinton. The danger _ the danger to our 
freedom _ may be more understandable when the tactics are used against 
an ordinary person. Ask not for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for 
thee.
