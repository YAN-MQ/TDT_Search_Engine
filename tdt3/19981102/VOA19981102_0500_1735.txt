On November 2nd, 1962, President John F. Kennedy told the American 
people that Soviet missiles in Cuba were being dismantled, and the 
Cuban missile crisis came to an end. Mr. Kennedy had announced on 
October 22nd that the presence of the missiles and Soviet jet bombers 
was a clear threat to in his words, "the peace and security of all 
Americans." President Kennedy said a missile fired from Cuba at any 
target of the Western Hemisphere would result in immediate U.S. retaliation 
against the Soviet Union. The president had ordered the U.S. Navy 
to stop any ships from going to Cuba, Soviet or otherwise, to deliver 
more missile, jets, or warheads to the island country. The crisis 
ended in a compromise. The U.S. agreed to begin removing certain missiles 
from Turkey. The Soviet Union agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba.
