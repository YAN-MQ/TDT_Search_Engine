The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 3: Here is 
a summary of our recommendations for noteworthy local races and ballot 
proposals in Tuesday's elections. Poll hours in New York state are 
from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., in New Jersey from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., and in 
Connecticut from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. NEW YORK STATE GOVERNOR: George

NEW YORK CITY PROPOSAL NUMBER ONE Vote No. This proposal would prohibit 
corporate contributions in city campaigns. Although labeled ``campaign 
finance reform,'' it would undermine a far better set of reforms recently 
passed by the City Council. OTHER LEGISLATIVE RACES In recent weeks 
we have limited our endorsement editorials for the New York state 
Legislature to the most competitive contests. There is another group 
of incumbent candidates who, while not being seriously challenged, 
warrant special notice. Among those veterans are Sen. Roy Goodman 
(R-Manhattan) and Assemblyman Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan), for 
successfully championing the Hudson River Park in their borough. Additional 
Assembly members who have been strong advocates for the environment 
include Richard Brodsky (D-Westchester), Thomas DiNapoli (D-Nassau), 
Sandra Galef (D-Westchester) and Fred Thiele Jr. (R-Suffolk). Other 
members from New York City and the suburbs whose work is worthy of 
special mention are State Sens. Suzi Oppenheimer (D-Westchester) and 
David Paterson (D-Manhattan), and Assembly members Pete Grannis (D-Manhattan), 
Roger Green (D-Brooklyn), Catherine Nolan (D-Queens), Felix Ortiz 
(D-Brooklyn), John Ravitz (R-Manhattan) and Steven Sanders (D-Manhattan).
