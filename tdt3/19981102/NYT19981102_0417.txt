Widening its reach in the bottled-water business, Groupe Danone announced 
on Monday that it was buying the Aqua Penn Spring Water Co. for $112 
million, or $13 a share. The move gives Groupe Danone, of Paris, access 
to three spring-water sources in Florida, California and Pennsylvania 
in addition to the Utah and Quebec springs it now uses for its Dannon 
brand of bottled water, which is distributed nationwide. It also links 
Danone for the first time to big customers like McDonald's, where 
Aqua Penn sells bottled water in some areas, and doubles the company's 
production capacity in the United States, a spokesman, Michael Neuwirth, 
said. ``We will remain focused on the fastest-growing and most profitable 
segment, natural spring water in packages of 1.5 liters or smaller,'' 
he said. Aqua Penn water will now be packaged under the Dannon label, 
which Danone introduced as a cheaper alternative to Evian, its imported 
brand. Groupe Danone's American depository receipts rose 37.5 cents 
Monday, to $53; shares of Aqua Penn were up sharply, gaining $2.9375, 
to $12.625. The acquisition, which Aqua Penn's founder and chairman, 
Edward J. Lauth III, described in a statement as ``a tremendous opportunity 
for our shareholders, employees and customers,'' is the latest example 
of the surging demand for bottled water. The noncarbonated water business 
grew by 13 percent last year, said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage 
Digest, while sales of single-serving packages jumped 25 percent. 
Pepsico began national distribution of its own brand, a filtered water 
called Aquafina, earlier this year. Aquafina, which is made by running 
tap water through filtration systems in bottling plants, has become 
the sixth-biggest brand in grocery stores, a company spokesman, Larry 
Jabbonsky, said, citing data compiled by Information Resources Inc. 
through early October. Many in the beverage industry expect Coca-Cola 
to introduce a competing product before long. ``It would make a great 
deal of sense,'' Sicher said. ``I think they're going to do it in 
the first quarter of 1999.'' A spokesman for Coke refused to confirm 
the speculation. ``At any given time, we're looking at a whole host 
of opportunities and we don't comment on anything,'' the spokesman, 
Polly Howes, said. Coca-Cola already packages and sells a bottled 
water called Bonaqua in 35 countries. Analysts and others said getting 
into the water business in the United States had been deliberately 
slow because Coke executives wanted to be sure the economic model 
would work. Bill Pecoriello of Sanford C. Bernstein said bottled water 
would be a good strategic move for Coke. ``You can't ignore water 
right now,'' he said. ``You can put the brand marketing of Coke to 
work, with Coke owning the brand and using their skill on the marketing 
side, and give the bottlers a water that works with their economics 
and their operations.''
