And Sony Corporation also led a rebound by exporters after the better 
than expected U.S. growth in the third quarter. However, Lawrence 
Kudlow, the chief economist at American Scandia Life Assurance Corporation 
cautions that signs of a slow down in the United States are emerging. 
There's a profit squeeze on the one side. On the other side, there's 
a commodity deflation that's still out there. I mean, the quality 
spread in the bond market are just as wide today as before the fed 
started easing. So that's a slowdown signal. Gold is in the low 290s, 
the CRB is barely above 200, so the commodity indicators and the quality 
spreads are telling you we're going to go into a little more of a 
slow down period. Mr. Kudlow expects the economy to slow to one to 
two percent in the fourth quarter.
