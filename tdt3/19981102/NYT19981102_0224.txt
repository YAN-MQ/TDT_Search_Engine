Sometime in mid-December, Timmy and Dan, two silverback male gorillas, 
and their respective troops will move into new quarters at the Bronx 
Zoo, in an environment designed by scientists and animal experts to 
resemble a central African rain forest, the animals' natural habitat. 
The new six-acre area of outdoor and indoor habitat, called Congo 
Gorilla Forest, is scheduled to open to the public in June, after 
the animals have time to adjust. ``The habitats for the animals are 
very large and very heavily vegetated, so they are as close to a rain 
forest as we can get in New York,'' said Lee Emkhe, the Congo project 
manager. ``We had a conflicting desire to give the animals freedom 
of movement yet see them face to face.'' The solution, he said, was 
to plan the habitats so the animals wanted to linger near the viewing 
areas, and, more importantly, to coax natural behavior from them, 
using a mixture of creative landscaping, exhibit architecture and 
some clever, hidden incentives. ``Instead of begging for food or exhibiting 
other older zoo behavior, the animals will do what they do in nature, 
which is foraging for food and interacting with members of their social 
groups,'' Emkhe explained. Over the past couple decades, many zoos 
have expanded their naturalistic habitats and all but abandoned animal 
cages. But Emkhe said the Congo habitat would go further on several 
fronts, especially in showing the animals as part of a whole ecosystem, 
instead of simply on an outdoor grassy plain. The designers are also 
using a dense and detailed mix of plants, waterfalls and synthetic 
mudbanks and native trees. The stars of Congo forest will be the two 
families of Western lowland gorillas, which will be joined by okapis, 
red river hogs, mandrills, birds, fish, reptiles, bugs and several 
species of monkeys, including guenon, colobus and pygmy. To help keep 
the animals in public view, the primate areas will use hidden feeders 
to disperse treats like seeds or fruit. In the mandrill habitat, a 
hopper inside a fake tree will be filled in the morning with sunflower 
seeds, which will be released at random times during the day. ``When 
you see the mandrills, they'll be digging at the base of this fallen 
tree,'' Emkhe said. ``That is exactly what they do in the wild _ they 
spend hours picking through leaf litter and rotted logs.'' Throughout, 
planners have drawn from research on animal behavior in the wild and 
lessons learned in zoos. Gorillas tend to prefer flat ground, so the 
landscape in one habitat slopes away from the viewing areas and up 
a hill. Tangles of artificial vines will be available for play. There 
is also plenty of room and vegetation for privacy. The indoor gorilla 
spaces _ one 900 square feet, the other 1,100 _ will have high ceilings 
and be filled with ledges, ropes, nets, ladders and hay (for nesting). 
The interior areas will be plainly finished, explained Emkhe, but 
more than adequate for the gorillas. ``They want to be able to climb, 
they want to be able to hide, they want to be able to swing,'' he 
said. ``They don't need the space to look like a pretend rain forest 
that most of them have never seen. All but Timmy, the oldest gorilla 
at the zoo, are captive-born gorillas.'' When it came to choosing 
vegetation for the outdoor habitats, designers had to be particularly 
creative. ``You don't want to show these animals in open pastures,'' 
said Rob Halpern, the curator of horticulture at the Wildlife Conservation 
Society, the zoo's parent organization. But the challenge, he said, 
lies in finding a way to keep the animals from eating the exhibits. 
Again, designers relied on wild and captive behavioral observations. 
For okapis, a zebra-size animal that is related to the giraffe, the 
habitat was lushly planted because Society field researchers have 
found that the okapis prefer dense growth. But the staff had to plant 
trees that okapis do not eat, in this case catalpa and bamboo. Similarly, 
the gorilla habitats include barberry, which is too thorny to eat, 
and horseradish, which tastes bad. Trees and plants have to resemble 
rain forest vegetation but be hardy enough to grow in the Northeast. 
Ultimately, zoo officials said, the habitat is about conservation 
education. ``The features in the gorilla habitat are for their mental 
and behavioral health, but visitors should experience gorillas being 
gorillas and not sculpture or pets,'' Halpern said. ``We want to get 
people involved in nature so they want to protect it.''
