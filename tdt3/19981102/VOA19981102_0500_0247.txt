The trial of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim 
on charges of corruption has begun in Kuala Lumpur amid a heavy police 
presence. The presiding judge started the hearings by denying official 
observers status to human rights and legal groups. The case against 
Mr. Anwar has sparked international concern with the former deputy 
prime minister saying the charges against him are politically motivated. 
A group of his supporters gathered near the courthouse as police watched 
but did not intervene.
