The chairman of South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission is 
warning that plans for national elections in the next year could be 
in jeopardy unless authorities quickly provide additional funding. 
VOA correspondent Alex Belida reports from Johannesburg. Voter registration 
for next year's elections in South Africa is scheduled to take place 
later this month, but Judge Johann Kriekler, chairman of the Independent 
Electoral Commission, say that crucial process might not go ahead 
unless more money is allocated soon. We haven't got the money that 
we wanted. We haven't got the money that we need. We're still in the 
process of debate with the controllers of the purse strings. Things 
are getting pretty tough. In the next week or two, somebody somewhere 
will have to decide whether the registration process continues or 
stops for lack of money. Judge Kriekler says his commission submitted 
a budget request a year ago for 960 million rand, about 160 million 
U.S. dollars. He says it has received only two-thirds the printing 
of ballot papers or the actual staging of next year's national vote. 
In an exchange with a small group of foreign journalists in Johannesburg, 
Judge Kriekler also voiced his concern about a new requirement that 
all voters have special bar coded identification cards in order to 
cast ballots. He says five million South Africans, about a fifth of 
the country's potential voters, do not yet have these I.D.'s and might 
be disenfranchised. You ask me will the five million people will get 
I.D. books by voting time next year, the answer is no. No date for 
the election has yet been set, but Judge Kriekler says his commission 
expects the vote will take place in early May. South Africa's 1994 
elections, the country's first democratic contest, were characterized 
by long lines of voters outside polling stations around the country. 
They gave President Nelson Mandella and the African National Congress 
an overwhelming victory. Most analysts expect the ANC to win again 
easily next year in an election that is expected to see current deputy 
president, Tabo Embecke succeed Mr. Mandella who is retiring. Alex
