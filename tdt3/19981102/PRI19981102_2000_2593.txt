Tomorrow, voters out there say, but today it's the dead. We're heading 
to central Mexico for today's geography quiz where they're celebrating 
the famous Day of the Dead. It's a national holiday in Mexico, a follow-up 
to yesterday's All Saint's Day, devoted to the spirit of dead children. 
Well today is the day for grown up ghosts. Mexicans crowded to cemeteries 
which come alive today with all sorts of picnics. The marketplaces 
are more crowded and colorful than ever too and at homes, residents 
erect little altars and adorn them with the departed ancestors' favorite 
foods and drinks, along with marigolds, long considered the flower 
of death. In this place today, you can't step outside without seeing 
wooden skeletons wobbling on sticks or toy coffins complete with pop-up 
skeletons in store windows. So what is this town famous for everything 
dead? We'll dig up the answer in a heartbeat.
