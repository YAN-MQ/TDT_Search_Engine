There is a new member of the World team today. WNED AM 970 in Buffalo, 
New York is carrying our program starting today. Welcome aboard Buffalo. 
We're off to the movies next here on PRI, Public Radio International. 
The World is sponsored by the Capital Group Companies, investing throughout 
the world for individuals and institutions. And the World is sponsored 
by Merck, dedicated to the needs of society through pharmaceutical 
research and consumer education to improve the quality of life. Merck, 
committed to bringing out the best in medicine. Stay tuned for more 
of the World coming up. In the rest of the program this year's worldwide 
music expo has just wrapped up in Stockholm, Sweden. We'll hear more 
from the World's Marco Rummin. Also an examination of the legacy of 
slavery in Cuba. We'll hear these stories next but first here's the 
Franklin Institute forecast. Tonight partly cloudy, low 38. Tuesday, 
clouds and some sun, cooler; high 51. And Wednesday, sunshine and 
a few clouds, breezy and chilly, high 49. Right now you're listening 
to the World on 91 fm. WHYY store of knowledge supports 91 FM and 
encourages you to entertain your brain with thousands of things to 
inspire, enlighten and educate the family. WHYY store of knowledge, 
Cherry Hill, Willow Grove, King of Prussia and the Depford Mall. This 
is the World. I'm Lisa Mullins.
