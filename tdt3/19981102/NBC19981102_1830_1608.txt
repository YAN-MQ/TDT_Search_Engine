there are no secrets not even secrets 200 years old or more. thomas 
jefferson, practically a saint in american history, was a contradiction 
on so many levels -- a champion freedom, who kept slaves, a widower 
who mourned his wife and, now, it turns out, may have kept a slave 
as a lover. nbc's bob faw. thomas jefferson, who wrote "all men are 
created equal," and sally hemings, his slave. tom and sally, says 
one historian -- "the longest running miniseries in american history." 
did they or didn't they? hoping to end a controversy which began in 
1802, geneticists at oxford university turned to dna. using new technology 
which tracks "y" chromosomes in males, they confirm in the journal 
"nature" that jefferson was the father of hemings' son, eston. we 
came up with the figure 100 to 1 for the likelihood that thomas jefferson 
was the father. jefferson inherited hemings from his father-in-law's 
estate. and for years, their relationship was grist for historians, 
even for hollywood. you still scared of me, sally? i ain't scared 
of you, massa. so descendants of miss hemings, who'd long claimed 
jeffersonian lineage, weren't surprised by the test results. it's 
a relief for americans who are a drop of this and a drop of that. 
the tests merely show a mortal who sinned, a great man with ordinary 
weakness a real human being. he was capable of saying one thing and 
doing another in his private life, which makes him not unlike most 
people, i imagine. and if the test results mean jefferson is now regarded 
as what one scholar calls "a '90s kind of guy," the white house must 
be smiling. after all, if bill clinton's favorite president could 
end up on mt. rushmore and the $2 bill despite being sexually active 
with a subordinate, it might put mr. clinton's conduct with a certain 
intern in a different light. it gives clinton additional cover. and 
it makes it more difficult to be as critical of this kind of behavior. 
it might not explain now someone who owns slaves could write the declaration 
of independence, but it does reveal another truth, that even presidents 
aren't saints, they're flesh and blood. bob faw, nbc news, washington.
