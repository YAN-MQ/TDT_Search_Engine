Former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has pleaded innocent 
at the opening of his trial on corruption charges. Mr. Anwar was once 
the designated political successor to Prime Minister Mohatir Mohammed. 
He's charged with ten counts of corruption and sexual misconduct. 
As VOA correspondent Gary Thomas reports from Kuala Lumpur, stern 
warnings from authorities and a solid police presence did not deter 
Anwar's supporters from coming out. riot police took up positions 
around the downtown courthouse where Anwar Ibrahim was to go on trial 
Monday. Access to the court was tightly controlled. Some reporters 
were allowed in as well as diplomatic observers and a representative 
of the international human rights group, Amnesty International. The 
general public was kept well away. As lawyers argued legal motions 
inside, a crowd of several hundred people milled about down the street 
under the watchful eyes of police. A few speeches were made and slogans 
shouted in Mr. Anwar's defense, but police did not break up the crowd 
even though the gathering was technically illegal. Mr. Anwar is on 
trial on the first four counts of corruption with trial on the charges 
to be held later, a process the attorney general has said could last 
until next June. Gary Thomas, VOA News, Kuala Lumpur.
