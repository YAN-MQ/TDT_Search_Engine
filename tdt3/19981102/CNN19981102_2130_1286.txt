jerome jurenovich, "cnn headline sports." more problems for kerry 
collins. the quarterback was arrested on drunken driving charges early 
this morning in charlotte, after his new team, the saints, lost to 
his former team, the panthers, in collins' first return to carolina 
since his controversial parting of the ways with the panthers. i don't 
think that he's a bad kid. i think maybe he's lost right now. i'll 
have to say that. because he certainly doesn't understand what's best 
for his career or what's best for the saints. he was hung in effigy. 
i have been hung in effigy. a guy asked me about it. i didn't like 
it. i don't understand those things. why -- it's part of a sick society 
that wants to hurt people.
