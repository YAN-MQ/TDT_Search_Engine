The top executive at Federal Express warned last weekend that the 
company was on the verge of losing several large customers during 
the peak holiday season because of a threatened strike by its pilots. 
The disclosure came after negotiations between the company and Fedex 
Pilots Association broke down late Friday. In a direct appeal delivered 
to each of the union's 3,500 members on Sunday along with the company's 
latest contract offer, Theodore Wiese, the chief executive of Federal 
Express, wrote that the union's hard line could permanently hurt the 
company and might cost some Fedex workers their jobs. Several big 
customers were asking for firm assurances that Fedex, a unit of FDX 
Corp., would deliver their packages during the peak holiday season, 
Wiese wrote. ``Our competitors are happy to provide those assurances,'' 
he added. ``But only if our customers make long-term commitments extending 
well past the end of our negotiations.'' A company spokesman would 
not say which customers Wiese had in mind. Bob Clement, a spokesman 
for the union, dismissed the letter as a ``typical union busting'' 
ploy by the company. ``I'm shocked every time I read it,'' he said. 
Last month, the pilots voted overwhelmingly not to fly any voluntary 
overtime beginning on Nov. 9, when a rising number of holiday packages 
begin to flow, and the union said it would ask members to authorize 
a strike in a vote later this month. If the pilots and the company 
reach an agreement, it would be the first union contract at Fedex, 
which has grown from a struggling start-up in 1973 into a $16 billion 
freight giant with a brand that has entered the vernacular around 
the world. The possibility of a strike at Federal Express, which dominates 
the air delivery business with about half the market, comes less than 
two years after a walkout by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters 
crippled the United Parcel Service, the biggest deliverer of packages 
on the ground. Federal Express and the pilots have been trying to 
negotiate a contract for more than five years. Two previous attempts, 
by the national Air Line Pilots Association and an earlier incarnation 
of the Fedex Pilots Association, foundered because many pilots did 
not back them. But support for the Fedex Pilots Association under 
new leadership increased markedly over the summer after many pilots 
were upset by a new computer scheduling system introduced by the company. 
The pilots, who earn an average of $130,000 a year, also say they 
are paid much less than their counterparts at UPS and the top commercial 
airlines. They are seeking a 24 percent pay increase over three years; 
the company has offered a 17 percent increase over five years. Clement 
said the company walked out of negotiations Friday night. William 
Margaritis, the Fedex spokesman, said the talks had been suspended 
while ``both sides re-evaluate their positions.'' He added that he 
could not predict when the talks would resume. Even if the pilots 
authorize a strike, it is not clear whether they can actually walk 
off the job. Under the Railway Labor Act, the pilots must receive 
permission by federal mediators. The Fedex pilots say they have simply 
stepped into the shoes of the Air Line Pilots Association, which received 
permission to strike in November 1995 but never followed through. 
Fedex will likely challenge that interpretation in court. Experts 
say the case could go either way. Taking pre-emptive action on Friday, 
the pilots union asked the U.S. District Court in Washington to affirm 
its right to strike.
