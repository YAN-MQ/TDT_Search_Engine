President Clinton is not on the ballot Tuesday and Speaker Newt Gingrich 
faces only token opposition for re-election to the House. But both 
used the final hours to stir turnout by party loyalists and to draw 
contrasts between their visions of the nation's future. Clinton conducted 
radio interviews on Monday with African-American and Latino journalists 
in an effort to bring minority voters to the polls, where they are 
expected to heavily favor Democratic candidates. Gingrich held an 
election-eve rally in his district in Marietta, Ga. Gingrich scaled 
back his earlier predictions about how well Republicans will do, saying 
he expected the party to win a net gain of six to 30 House seats. 
Earlier, he had predicted a net gain of 10 to 40 seats. White House 
strategists still expect the Democrats to lose three to five Senate 
seats and as many as 16 House seats _ a blow, said one senior White 
House official, but not as bad as it could be. This official, who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity, maintained that if those projections 
hold, the result would be worse for Gingrich than for Clinton. ``Given 
the history of midterm elections and what's gone on this year, old 
Newtie is going to have some explaining to do to his caucus,'' the 
White House official said. ``He's going to have to come up with some 
reason why he hasn't done better.'' Clinton said in his interviews 
on Monday that electing Democrats to Congress and to governors' offices 
is particularly important to minorities because new congressional 
districts will be drawn after the 2000 census. More Democrats means 
more money for education, for job training, for health care and for 
other programs that benefit middle- and low-income Americans, the 
president said. His appeal was unvarnished: Elect Democrats to Congress 
to temper the selfish and reactionary impulses of the Republicans. 
``You know,'' Clinton said in an interview with Tom Joyner, an ABC 
radio personality with a largely African-American audience, ``the 
real problem now is that the Congress is basically dominated by not 
only the Republicans, but the right wing of the party is in the driver's 
seat.'' In an interview with four Latino journalists, Clinton said 
that Democrats favored a more generous immigration policy and would 
fight for a fairer count of minority communities in the 2000 census. 
In both interviews, he invoked the specter of the Democrats' favorite 
bogyman, Gingrich, as an incentive to get out and vote, telling each 
of his listeners that their vote counts as much as that of the speaker 
of the House. Gingrich has been barnstorming the country, campaigning 
in 48 states this year, 15 in the last week, for Republicans. Although 
he signed off on $10 million worth of television commercials reminding 
voters of Clinton's scandal with Monica Lewinsky, Gingrich does not 
refer to it on the stump. Instead, Gingrich tells his audiences that 
without a Republican Congress, there would have been no tax cuts, 
no balanced budget and no welfare reform. Monday night at a rally 
in Georgia, Gingrich said that Clinton was using scare tactics to 
motivate voters to go to the polls. ``There are tremendous efforts 
underway to turn out the Democratic base,'' Gingrich said. ``Many 
of you have seen the president and Mrs. Clinton going all over the 
place trying to make sure that they scare enough people to win. We 
really do have a choice here between the politics of hope and the 
politics of fear.'' He added: ``If you listen to their rhetoric, it 
is again and again and again the rhetoric of fear _ divide Americans, 
frighten Americans, scare Americans. Frankly, it's a little shameful 
for the president of the United States trying to divide his own country 
and trying to frighten people with false images of America.'' He said 
that ``we all want every American to participate in prosperity,'' 
and for Clinton to suggest otherwise ``is to do a disservice to the 
country he is supposed to be leading.'' White House officials have 
been delighted in recent days by news reports linking Gingrich to 
the new Republican commercials attacking Clinton. ``If there's three 
things that every decent American can't stand,'' said Paul Begala, 
a senior adviser to the president, ``it's negative ads, partisan investigations 
and Newt Gingrich. And in the closing days of the campaign the Republicans 
gave us all three wrapped together.'' Clinton, in the interview with 
Latino journalists, said that the Republican advertisements argue 
that voters should turn away from Democrats because of Clinton's affair 
with Lewinsky and his lies about it. ``In other words,'' the president 
said, ``they're saying `Punish someone else for this.' And ultimately 
the argument is, they are telling the voters they should punish themselves.'' 
Administration aides acknowledged that, from the president on down, 
White House officials have tried in recent days to focus attention 
on Gingrich. They argued that that was a legitimate strategy since 
the first vote new House members will cast will be for the next speaker.
