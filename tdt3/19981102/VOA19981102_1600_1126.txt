The Green Bay Packers have once again defeated the San Francisco 49ers 
in the featured match on Sunday in the U.S. National Football League. 
Quarterback Brett Favre tossed three touchdown passes and the Green 
Bay defense recorded nine sacks in the 36 to 22 victory at home. The 
Packers had beaten the 49ers five straight times, including each of 
the last three playoffs. Green Bay wide receiver Antonio Freeman says 
defense was the key. I wouldn't say we're better than them defense 
rises to the challenge. And today they did. They did put pressure 
on Steve, you know. They minimized what Jerry Rice could do offensively, 
and we knew that there was a big key coming to the game. The Green 
Bay victory pulls the Packers within one game of the first place Minnesota 
Vikings. The Vikings lost for the first time this season in a 27 t 
24 setback to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Bucks quarterback Trent Dilfer 
says he knew the offense would need to play well. I was trying to 
let everybody know that we needed to score every time we got the football. 
You know, we except for once. You know, that's the kind of game we 
knew we were going to have to play. That's the type of football team 
we beat today. I don't know in my career if I've ever seen an offense 
as explosive as that. The Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos are the 
only undefeated team. The Broncos improved to eight and 0 by rallying 
to defeat the Cincinnati Bengals 33 to 26. Elsewhere in the National 
Football League, the Tennessee Oilers defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 
41 to 31. The Washington Redskins got their very first win of the 
season, 21 to 14 over the New York Giants. The New York Jets were 
20 to 17 winners over the Kansas City Chiefs. The Oakland Raiders 
defeated the Seattle Seahawks 31 to 18. Other winners included the 
Atlanta Falcons, the Jacksonville Jaguars, Buffalo Bills, Carolina 
Panthers, Arizona Cardinals, and New England Patriots.
