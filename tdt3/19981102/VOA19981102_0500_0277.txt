South Korean President Kim Dae Jung has expressed hope that a business 
trip to North Korea last week by the founder of the Hyundai Group 
will help improve inter-Korean relations. Mr. Kim made the comment 
after meeting with Hyundai founder, Chun Jung Yung. Mr. Chun reached 
several deals with North Korea, including a tourism project to bring 
South Koreans to the north. He also discussed deals for oil development 
and building a car assembly plant and an industrial park.
