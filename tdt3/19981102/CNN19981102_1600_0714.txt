Police in Portland, Oregon, are about to launch a sting operation 
to make crossing the street safer. Undercover officers are going to 
pose as pedestrians. Drivers who fail to let them pass will get a 
ticket. 49 people have been killed crossing the street in Oregon this 
year, that's a 40% increase from the same period last year.
