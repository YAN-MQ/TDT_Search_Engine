Elsewhere, western news agencies say Hamas militants have threatened 
war against Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat if he continues his crackdown 
against Hamas to meet Israeli demands. The news agencies say the threat 
came in a fax Sunday from the military wing of Hamas. The one Hamas 
leader, Ismael Abu Shanab calls the threat bogus. He says the fax 
did not come from Hamas.
