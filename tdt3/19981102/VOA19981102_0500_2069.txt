Indonesia is one of the Asian nations hardest hit by the global financial 
crisis and is finding it very difficult to get its economy moving 
again. Indonesia's top economic rendesser says little improvement 
is possible without a healthy private sector. But Indonesian businesses 
are staggering under an estimated $60 billion debt, and since the 
rupiah's plunge, most cannot repay those debts. As long as the debt 
is outstanding, no new loans are possible and business stalls. However, 
what's being called the Jakarta initiative may help. Jenny Grant has 
details from the Indonesian capital. Indonesia's top economic minister, 
Ginanja Kartasasmeta, to hold a meeting of one thousand debtors and 
creditors that result in private sector debt is crucial to national 
recovery. The private sector debt in Indonesia is $63 billion, including 
$33 billion owed to foreign creditors. More than half that debt was 
due to be paid back this year, but over the past year, the filing 
repair has made it almost impossible for Indonesian debtors to pay 
back their heavy loans. Mr. Kartasasmeta says within inflation falling 
and the repair now strengthening, there is new momentum to reschedule 
debt. It is vital that our corporate sector takes action to resolve 
its debt problems, opening up assets to capital. And it is only when 
all our corporations begin to produce, to, and to hire workers that 
we will truly see the end of the crisis. The Jakarta initiative set 
up by the government in the World Bank last month now offers a process 
to help companies restructure their businesses. By restructuring their 
assets those companies can raise funds so they can pay back their 
big debts. Peter Schupta, Indonesia country manager for City Bank 
says his bank will consider using the Jakarta initiative to negotiate 
with its debtors. It seems to me the concept is good, an the concept 
would say that you get a bunch of people in good conscience. Depending 
on where we think it might make sense to have a third party, somebody 
to help grease the wheels, absolutely we will. But Mr. Gupta cautions 
against the attitude that bad credit is only a problem for the banks 
to solve. He says if corporate Indonesia cannot pay back its full 
debts, all parties should share the burden. And Mr. Gupta knows that 
if the Jakarta initiative can assist debtor companies to generate 
cash flow again, creditors do not necessarily have to lose money. 
The Indonesian government has also reformed its bankruptcy law, set 
up a bankruptcy court, and established a debt restructuring agency 
to help debtors and creditors resolve the problem of overdue loans.
