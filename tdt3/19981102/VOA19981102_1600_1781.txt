President Clinton convened his national security advisers Monday to 
discuss how to respond to Iraq's position to halt cooperation with 
U.N. weapons inspections. The president called the Iraqi action unacceptable 
and said no options for responding are off the table. VOA's David 
Gullist has more from the White House. The meeting here included Defense 
Secretary William Cohen and military Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman 
General Hugh Shelton, but neither White House nor Pentagon officials 
were signaling any immediate change in U.S. force deployments in the 
Gulf. At a White House health event, President Clinton said the completely 
unacceptable action of Saddam Hussein has only hardened the international 
consensus against him. Far from dividing the international community 
and achieving concessions, his obstructionism was immediately and 
unanimously condemned by the United Nations Security Council. It has 
only served to deepen the international community's resolve. Mr. Clinton 
says the only way for Saddam Hussein to escape post Gulf War sanctions 
is through complete cooperation with the weapons inspectors in his 
words, "without restrictions, run-arounds, or roadblocks." David Gullist, 
VOA News, the White House.
