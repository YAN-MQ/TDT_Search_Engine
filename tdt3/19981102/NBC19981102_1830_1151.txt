as the shuttle "discovery" continues on its mission, now about halfway 
through, john glenn is having a fine time doing his tests on aging, 
looking out the window, and sharing his experience with those of us 
who remain earthbound. tonight, i talked to the senator-turned-astronaut 
as he sat beside commander kirk brown. and asked him about the rush 
of adrenaline on takeoff. it's been abfine mission so far. there's 
a rush of adrenaline when you're getting ready to launch off the pad 
and feeling that acceleration off the launch pad. that was a great 
feeling and a time of excitement. once you get acclimated and you're 
floating free in this environment, it's great. you just look forward 
to keeping it up and try to do as much as we can and get as much information 
that will benefit people on earth. and in my particular case, get 
information so we can benefit these 34 million americans that are 
over 65. senator glen, any change in body function? i know the viewers 
will notice that your face is puffier? my changes? a little puffy 
yet. it doesn't cause any pain at all. once we start back down, we'll 
readjust the other way. your body needs more fluid. and that shift 
occurs the other direction. we'll have to fluid load when we start 
down. senator, glenn, we asked some young viewers who are watching 
all of this and participating on msnbc.com to submit some questions 
and danielle wants to know whether the earth looks any different to 
you now than it did in 1962. i've had more chances to look out on 
this flight, of course. i've had five before. and i'm so impressed 
with the view you get from here. we're 500 miles up which is more 
than double the height i was up before. glenn said that when it comes 
to that adrenaline rush, getting shot at in combat in two wars still 
tops the adrenaline experience.
