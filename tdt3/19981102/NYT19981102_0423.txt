New York City and state officials are close to a deal to provide Nasdaq 
and the American Stock Exchange with a $200 million subsidy package 
to build a new joint headquarters, probably in a skyscraper a block 
from Times Square, people involved with the talks said Monday. Under 
the terms of an agreement that was still being completed on Monday 
night, the American Stock Exchange, which is based in lower Manhattan, 
and Nasdaq, which is based in Washington, would build a new trading 
floor and a combined headquarters in New York. In turn, city and state 
officials would provide about $180 million in tax breaks and investment 
tax credits and $20 million to $25 million in cash for the project. 
City and state officials and real estate executives say the markets 
will probably move to a 40-story skyscraper that a developer, Douglas 
Durst, plans to build on land between 42d and 43d Streets, from the 
middle of the block east to the Avenue of the Americas. Next door, 
Nasdaq is already erecting the largest sign in Times Square, a $15 
million multi-media kaleidoscope, on the side of Durst's 48-story 
Conde Nast building, which is on Broadway between 42d and 43d Streets. 
Real estate and financial executives say the midtown location would 
be in keeping with efforts by Frank Zarb, chairman of the National 
Association of Securities Dealers, which owns Nasdaq and the American 
Stock Exchange, to build a world financial market that would rival 
the New York Stock Exchange. He acquired the American Stock Exchange 
last week and has made a bid to acquire the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, 
which would presumably also move to New York should the bid be accepted. 
If the markets cannot strike a deal with Durst, Nasdaq and the American 
Stock Exchange could transfer the $200 million benefit package to 
a second site at Battery Park City in lower Manhattan, people involved 
in the talks said. Another developer, World Financial Properties, 
has offered to build a tower for the markets there. Their first choice, 
though, is the Durst site in Times Square, city and state officials 
and real estate executives said. ``We are talking to the city about 
an offer,'' Michael Jones, chief administrative officer of the National 
Association of Securities Dealers, said on Monday night. ``We have 
also received an offer from New Jersey. We are reviewing both.'' Two 
people involved with the negotiations said a deal ``was very close.'' 
A City Hall official said on Monday night, ``We expect to have a deal 
within a few days.'' At first glance, Nasdaq and the American Stock 
Exchange might seem to be alien to Times Square. But in recent years, 
corporate law firms, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the investment firm, 
and Reuters, the giant British financial information services company, 
have found their way to the district.
