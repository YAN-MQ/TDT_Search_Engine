Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun stuck close to her hometown on Monday, playing 
to her Democratic political base in an eleventh-hour attempt to keep 
her job. She greeted dawn riders at an elevated train stop on the 
South Side, stopped at a commuter rail station downtown and picked 
up last-minute endorsements from a group of Latino political leaders. 
She worked the lunchtime crowd at a North Side diner that is a favorite 
hangout of another Democratic stalwart, former Rep. Dan Rostenkowski. 
And she finished the day at a candlelight vigil for Barnett A. Slepian, 
the obstetrician from a suburb of Buffalo who was killed because he 
performed abortions. ``Each soul to the polls,'' she exhorted about 
50 black church leaders and small-business owners at a breakfast rally 
at Captain's Hard Time restaurant, a South Side eatery not far from 
where Moseley-Braun went to high school. ``Take someone with you. 
Get on the phone. I know there's a few voodoo ladies in this room, 
so do what you need to do to get the sun shining tomorrow.'' Vigorous 
turnout by her core supporters is Moseley-Braun's best chance for 
re-election, political experts believe. After bounding from an obscure 
Cook County office to become the nation's first black woman senator 
six years ago, Moseley-Braun has been buffeted by misjudgments in 
her personal and political life. Her opponent, state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, 
a conservative multimillionaire, has hammered at her missteps in a 
glut of television commercials. Most polls over the last few months 
have shown Moseley-Braun trailing badly, but three polls published 
in the last few days show her gaining ground and, in one case, running 
even with Fitzgerald. ``I believe we have a really good chance to 
get elected tomorrow,'' Moseley-Braun said at Captain's Hard Time. 
``What has happened in the last few weeks is that we've been able 
to make the point that his record really is as extreme as I said it 
was.'' But despite the professions of optimism, Moseley-Braun's campaign 
was determined on Monday to pull out all the stops. She was accompanied 
by Rodney Slater, the secretary of transportation, a rousing campaign 
speaker, and praised by Democratic congressmen like Luis Gutierrez. 
On the South Side, her campaign staff handed out buttons and bumper 
stickers intended to tap into the black community's adoration for 
the late Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor. ``Remember 
Harold,'' one bumper sticker said. ``Punch 16 for Carol.'' At Northwestern 
Station, where the senator was trying to reach suburban working women, 
the sneaker-and-skirt crowd who supported her so strongly in her 1992 
election, the campaign signs read ``A Seat at the Table for Women. 
Vote Moseley-Braun'' and ``Pro-Choice, Pro-Child, Pro-Carol.'' Many 
of the voters Moseley-Braun saw on Monday said they were well aware 
of her missteps, but would vote for her, anyway, because she was supported 
by people they respected, or because they objected to Fitzgerald's 
positions on abortion, gay rights and the right to bear concealed 
weapons. Bonnie Taylor-Williams, who runs a beauty salon and a hair-products 
company on the South Side, said she would vote for Moseley-Braun because 
she was the only black woman senator, and because Hillary Rodham Clinton 
had been campaigning so hard for her. ``She's made a few mistakes,'' 
said Luanne Adams, 40, a computer programmer who saw the senator at 
the commuter rail station. ``But if she's in Washington, D.C., she 
is my representative. If Fitzgerald were to win, he does not represent 
me in any way. His views are so radically different than mine.''
