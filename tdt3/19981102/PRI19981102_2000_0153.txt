The parents of the baby who died in the care of a British au pair 
in Massachusetts were in Federal court today. They are seeking millions 
of dollars in damages for their child's death. From member station 
WBUR in Boston, Toni Randolph reports. The family of 8-month old Matthew 
Eppen did not specify a dollar amount in the filings in Federal court 
today. They say the several million dollar figure considers what the 
boy may have earned during his lifetime. An attorney for the family 
says the Eppens arent' interested in collecting money from 20-year 
old Louise Woodward. They are more interested in making sure Woodward 
doesn't profit from the boy's death. Woodward was found responsible 
for Matthew Eppens' death last year after a Massachusetts judge reduced 
her murder conviction to manslaughter and that freed her after the 
279 days she's already served. She's since returned to her native 
England and has not responded to the wrongful death suit, saying she 
has no money to defend herself. Ironically, in order for the family 
to collect money from Woodward, she'd have to sell her story and she 
denies plans to do that. For NRP news, I'm Tony Randolph in Boston.
