The Denver Broncos are the only undefeated team in the National Football 
League after staging a big fourth quarter rally Sunday to meet the 
Cincinnati Bengals 33 to 26. Denver quarterback John Elway led the 
Broncos to three touchdowns in the final seven minutes. The defending 
Super Bowl champions are now off to their best start in franchise 
history with eight straight wins and no losses.
