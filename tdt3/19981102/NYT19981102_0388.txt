National political parties have been steadily pumping money into critical 
state races, in part because whoever controls the statehouses and 
governors' mansions will have a hand in redrawing congressional districts 
after the 2000 census. For the first time in many races, money that 
would go to congressional candidates is reaching candidates for governor 
and state legislature in large amounts. Candidates like Ron Adair 
of Roswell, N.M., who is running for the state Senate, received $35,000 
from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which typically 
supports congressional candidates. In California, Helen Thomson received 
$25,000 from the Democrats for her Assembly race while the Republicans 
gave $125,000 to Lee Daniels, a state House candidate. ``We are doing 
this for one overarching reason,'' said Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman 
for the National Republican Congressional Committee, ``and that is 
because redistricting is important in the long run to the next congressional 
election.'' Control of 26 state legislative chambers is at stake Tuesday, 
with some races so close that a loss of four or fewer seats would 
shift the leadership to the other party. Nowhere is the concern over 
redistricting more visible than in California, where Lt. Gov. Gray 
Davis, a Democrat, and Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican, 
are battling to be governor and where all of the seats in the state 
Legislature are up for re-election. Lawmakers will draw the congressional 
districts _ 52 of them or more depending on the the 2000 census _ 
for the decade ahead. Federal law requires that each congressional 
district within a state contain about the same number of people. But, 
as in all other states, the districts in California, which has the 
largest delegation in the country, can be drawn to benefit either 
the Democrats or the Republicans. ``Who controls that drafting process 
is very important,'' said Craig Engle, general counsel at the National 
Republican Senatorial Committee. ``In California, there could be a 
difference of 10 House seats, depending on how the map is drawn. And 
when the Republicans have an 11-vote margin in the House, losing 10 
seats from redistricting would be unpleasant.'' Of the 14 Republican 
candidates who received more than $100,000 from the national party, 
six are seeking state office. Lungren received the largest amount, 
$1.7 million. Other state office seekers who received hefty checks 
were: Jim Ross Lightfoot, a candidate for Iowa governor, and Robert 
Taft, a candidate for Ohio governor, who each received $250,000, and 
J. Kenneth Blackwell, who got $100,000 in his bid to become Ohio's 
secretary of state. Blackwell, the state treasurer in Ohio, said Republicans 
gave him additional money after he decided not to oppose Taft in a 
primary. The party also contributed to his campaign because, as secretary 
of state, Blackwell would cast one of the five votes on the state 
reapportionment board, which draws the districts for the state Legislature. 
The state lawmakers, in turn, draw the map for the U.S. House districts. 
Thomas Mann, a congressional expert at the Brookings Institution, 
said there had been a marked increase in spending on contested state 
races. ``This happened before the 1990 election, which was the last 
round of redistricting,'' Mann said, ``and it is happening again. 
The parties are looking to play an influential role in congressional 
redistricting.'' Right now, of the 99 state legislative chambers, 
one is split evenly between the two parties, 49 are controlled by 
Democrats and 48 by Republicans. (Nebraska has a nonpartisan legislature.) 
Among governors, 32 are Republicans, 17 are Democrats and one, Maine's, 
is an independent. There are elections for governor Tuesday in 36 
states. Democrats have sent $4 million to California since July 1 
for all races. About $1.8 million was rushed there in the first week 
of October, according to Federal Election Commission records. ``California 
is the 800-pound gorilla of this election,'' said Steve Grossman, 
finance director of the Democratic National Committee. ``This election 
is linked to the strategy for the year 2000 because it is about redistricting 
the biggest state in the country and it will determine who controls 
the legislative process and, therefore, a good part of the political 
agenda.'' In all, national Republican Party committees have sent $37.8 
million to state-level races since July 1, according to figures compiled 
for The New York Times by the Campaign Study Group. That money was 
also used to support federal candidates and get-out-the-vote efforts. 
Democratic Party committees sent $31 million to state-level committees 
and candidates. Another top recipient of Democratic dollars is Texas, 
specifically the district of Rep. Martin Frost, who heads the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee. That panel transferred $1.2 million 
to Texas: $988,400 to the state Democratic Party; $85,995 to the Tarrant 
County Democratic Party, $15,620 to the Dallas County Democratic Party 
and $25,000 to Hidalgo County in the Rio Grande Valley. (Tarrant and 
Dallas Counties are in Frost's district.) In addition, $90,000 went 
to John Sharp, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor.
