In northwestern Nicaragua, hundreds of bodies are being recovered 
from mud and flood waters after a huge landslide down the muddy slopes 
of a volcano. More from VOA's Greg Flakus. Witnesses describe a nightmarish 
scene of nude, and in some cases, dismembered corpses washed down 
the mountainside by the mud and the fast-moving flood waters. Less 
than one hundred of the estimated 2,000 people living in the area 
had been accounted for before darkness fell on Sunday. Even though 
the mudslide occurred Friday, rescue workers have had difficulty reaching 
the area 140 kilometers northwest of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua 
because of continued rain and the devastation to infrastructure caused 
by flooding. The waters have demolished at least 35 bridges and cut 
off a couple of dozen roads. The floods have also destroyed more than 
5,000 homes and left tens of thousands of people stranded without 
adequate shelter, food, potable water, and clothing. Authorities have 
appealed for international assistance, and some newspaper reports 
in Managua indicate this could be the worst natural disaster to hit 
Nicaragua since the 1972 earthquake that destroyed Managua and killed 
more than 5,000 people. The rains that produced the floods in Nicaragua, 
Honduras, and other parts of Central America, were the result of Hurricane 
Mitch, which sat off the coast of Northern Honduras most of last week. 
More than 250 people died in Honduras as the result of the storm. 
Although Mitch is now much weaker and has been classified as a tropical 
storm, experts say it could still pose a threat to Southern Mexico 
and parts of Central America if it strengthens again. It's currently 
located near the Pacific Coast town of Capachula in Southern Mexico.
