In the world of agriculture this week, experts say the prospect of 
more bumper crops here in the United States next year could spell 
bad news for American growers. Scientists find a way to track deadly 
back to the farm and U.S. farm cooperatives get a big boost from the 
federal government. Bob Sivak has details. American grain bins are 
still bulging with last year's crops and another near record grain 
harvest is on the way. The big surplus and weakened overseas markets 
for that grain have sent crop prices to their lowest levels in ten 
years. U.S. farmers facing this scenario might be expected to cut 
way back on their plantings next spring, but most crop analysts say 
that's not likely to happen. Ohio State University economist Allen 
Lyons observes that since the federal government no longer requires 
crop farmers to reduce plantings, U.S. growers will probably say... 
"I already have the equipment. I already have the land." That doesn't 
mean it's going to be profitable to do it. From a cash flow standpoint 
and that additional cash flow will diminish but crops will still be 
planted. That's a view shared by the U.S. Agriculture Department's 
chief economist, Keith Collins. It's true that farmers will tend to 
plant all that's available to them. That's why I think the prospect 
of large acreage for soy beans again next year, large acreage for 
corn against next year seem to be what we're going to get. The experts 
say U.S. farmers will stay with heavy plantings of maze and soy beans 
to try to hold their income steady, hoping higher volumes can compensate 
for lower prices. But the USDA's chief economist says gearing up for 
big crops next spring could depress prices further and make matters 
worse for financially strapped American producers.
