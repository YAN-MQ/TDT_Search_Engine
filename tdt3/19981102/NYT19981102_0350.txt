Under pressure to make its trading system faster and cheaper, the 
London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange on Monday 
announced a sweeping reorganization intended to cut its operating 
costs in half by the end of next year. The changes will mean a loss 
of 600 of its 1,000 jobs. The announcement was the latest indication 
that the exchange, known as Liffe, is under growing pressure _ predominantly 
from the new German-Swiss Eurex futures exchange _ to accelerate its 
move toward screen-based trading and away from its slower and more 
costly open-outcry system. Brian Williamson, the new chairman of the 
London exchange, said it ``needs to act decisively and quickly'' against 
sharp competition. The London derivatives market _ once unchallenged 
as the biggest of its kind in Europe _ has been under increasing pressure 
since the Deutsche Terminborse, Frankfurt's futures market, seized 
control of the benchmark 10-year German bond market earlier this year. 
With the creation of a German-Swiss electronic futures exchange, Liffe 
has been caught up in such competition between European exchanges 
in advance of the January introduction of the euro, the single European 
currency, which will change European trading by creating huge bond 
and stock markets denominated in the new currency. Liffe executives 
said at a news conference Monday that the reorganization would be 
carried out on three levels: cost savings, including a reduction in 
the number of employees to 400 by the end 1999; a quest for new partners 
in different time zones, and changes in regulations now modeled on 
the practices at Chicago trading-pit exchanges. ``It is clear that 
nothing remotely like our current cost base is sustainable and that 
we shall have to cut jobs to remain competitive,'' Williamson said. 
The cuts are supposed to reduce the exchange's operating budget to 
about $100 million by the end of next year from more than $200 million 
this year. ``We have to deliver an efficient trading platform and 
products that our customers want at a price they are prepared to pay,'' 
he said. ``It is clear we shall have to cut jobs to remain competitive.'' 
Liffe executives declined to comment on potential new partners. In 
the past, traders have spoken of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as 
a possible partner, mirroring negotiations reportedly under way between 
Frankfurt-based futures traders and the Chicago Board of Trade. Liffe 
and the London Clearing House have also discussed closer cooperation. 
Williamson also said that ``one of the strategies is to talk to Chicago 
and Frankfurt.'' He is scheduled to travel to Chicago this week, but 
ruled out an announcement there. ``We have a program starting quite 
soon where we will take up offers of interest and we will initiate 
talks,'' Williamson said. The third aspect of the changes involves 
drawing up regulations for automated trading, Liffe executives said. 
The announcement showed how much the introduction of the euro is pushing 
markets into alliances beyond their traditional boundaries. Frankfurt 
and London have become the main rivals for derivatives trading, while 
some smaller futures exchanges, such as the Matif in Paris, have thus 
far been squeezed out.
