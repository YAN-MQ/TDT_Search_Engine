Kids who drink bottled water, rather than tap water, may pay the price 
in the dental chair. Dentists warn some children are developing more 
cavities because they are drinking bottled water, which is not fluoridated.

by selling fluoridated bottled water. Experts also suggest prescription 
fluoride tablets.
