I'm Bill Hazzer, VOA News. President Clinton says all options are 
open for dealing with Iraq's clear violation of commitments to the 
United Nations. The president meets today with his top national security 
advisers to discuss their recommendations. The security advisers met 
at the White House late Sunday after Iraq said again there will be 
no more U.N. inspectors or inspections until U.N. trade sanctions 
against it are lifted. U.S. advisers say Washington will consult with 
its allies and others with a direct stake in the Iraq situation. British 
ambassador, U.N. Security Council president Jeremy Greenstock defines 
diplomatic duty. It's the diplomat's duty, after all, to find options 
other than the use of force. We'll be exploring those particularly 
over the next few days.
