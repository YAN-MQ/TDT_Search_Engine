The preferred way of filming the lives of great painters, it seems, 
is to focus on their lives and ignore their paintings. This at least 
may explain why movie directors keep returning to van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, 
Modigliani and Rembrandt and avoiding the more prosaic careers of, 
say, Monet, Mondrian and Magritte. Alcoholism, madness and tragedy 
are evidently easier to portray on screen than mere genius. But there 
is another good reason for them to favor life over art. Museums and 
private collectors are unwilling to lend classic masterpieces to film 
productions. And with 20th-century paintings, to which copyright rules 
still apply, estates frequently prohibit the use of even reproductions 
or copies, as was the case with Merchant-Ivory's ``Surviving Picasso'' 
and John Maybury's ``Love Is the Devil,'' his new bio-pic about Francis 
Bacon. It is in hope of breaking this pattern, then, that Charles 
Matton has chosen a novel approach in ``Rembrandt van Rijn,'' the 
new French-language movie that he has just begun shooting in the Warner 
Brothers Studios at Bottrop in Germany for release next fall. Determined 
to give the 17th-century Dutch master's paintings a central role in 
his film, Matton commissioned two French artists, Serge Clement and 
Marina Kamena, to paint no fewer than eight Rembrandts. Matton, 66, 
himself better known in France as a painter and sculptor than as a 
director, had an additional brainstorm. He wanted Rembrandt's portraits 
(and two self-portraits) to be copied but with the faces altered to 
resemble those of his actors: Klaus Maria Brandauer as Rembrandt; 
Johanna Tersteege as the artist's wife, Saskia; Romane Bohringer as 
his maid cum mistress Hendrickje Stoffels; Jean Rochefort as Dr. Nicolaes 
Tulp, who presides over ``The Anatomy Lesson,'' and Marie-Claude Mestral 
as Anna Wijmer, mother of Amsterdam's mayor. And yet Matton did not 
want the portraits to look so much like his actors that they lost 
the aura of the originals. ``I wanted them halfway between Rembrandt 
and the actors,'' he explained. ``But I wanted to retain the mood 
of Rembrandt. This is possible because in portraiture, everything 
that emphasizes resemblance undermines the quality of the portrait. 
Even Rembrandt's self-portraits are not identical.'' So now, with 
most of these ersatz Rembrandts in hand, the director can show the 
canvas while Brandauer's Rembrandt pretends to be painting his subjects 
(with transparent varnish). Matton, who wrote the screenplay with 
his wife, Sylvie, can also let the camera dwell on the copied portraits 
since they, too, have the texture and reflective light of real oils. 
Still, for Clement, 65, and his wife, Ms. Kamena, 53, the challenge 
of copying, and changing, Rembrandt has proven humbling. ``We are 
in the process of being given a magisterial lesson in painting,'' 
Clement explained in an interview in his studio in this tiny village, 
60 miles south of Paris. ``Rembrandt was really the first to make 
the most of painting in oil. He could paint ugly things and make them 
beautiful.'' The two artists faced a further problem that did not 
worry Rembrandt: They were expected to complete eight paintings, and 
show four others at an early stage, in just two months. So there was 
no question of starting from scratch; their priority was to introduce 
a subtle though clear resemblance to the movie's actors. They decided 
to work on life-size color photographs of the eight paintings glued 
to canvas. But they also had to develop their own special techniques 
for this bizarre adventure. The first step in each case was to cover 
the original face with gesso, thus acquiring a base on which to paint. 
Then, using thin oil paint and acrylic, they copied the face of the 
actor from a photograph taken in the correct pose. At this point, 
the resemblance was total. Next, having covered this image with a 
transparent gel, they put aside the photograph of the actor and turned 
instead to a photograph of the original painting, working in thick 
oil to create a hybrid. Finally, they applied a glazing to capture 
Rembrandt's luminosity. The paint used at the final stages was similar 
to that available to Rembrandt. In practice, they had to treat other 
areas of the painting to cover evidence of the photograph. In some 
cases, they also recovered important details of the paintings that 
were somehow lost in the photographs. ``With Dr. Tulp, you can't see 
his feet,'' said Ms. Kamena, whose assignments included ``The Anatomy 
Lesson.'' ``So we had to repaint them in the same way: an isolating 
layer of varnish, a transparent texture and then oil.'' With ``The 
Night Watch,'' which is too large to transport and will be painted 
in the movie studio in Germany, Clement must take account of the fact 
that Rembrandt added Saskia to the near-complete painting after he 
discovered she was dying. Since Matton wants to show this before and 
after, Clement will first paint Saskia, or Ms. Tersteege, then cover 
her with varnish and add the legs and uniform of one of the night 
watchmen in gouache, all to be washed off for the later scene. Clement 
also had something of a revelation when he added Ms. Bohringer to 
Rembrandt's 1654 painting of Hendrickje Stoffels as ``Bathsheba Holding 
King David's Letter.'' ``Rembrandt cheated,'' he said with a laugh. 
``No, I don't like that word. Rembrandt was a rearranger. When I asked 
Romane Bohringer to bow her head and keep her shoulders in Hendrickje's 
position, she couldn't. Rembrandt turned her face forward but not 
her shoulders. He was looking for effect, not accuracy.'' Matton further 
wanted Clement to emphasize Hendrickje's pregnancy, which he did by 
increasing the swell of her stomach and making her breasts rounder. 
``Romane's hair ends sharply on her forehead,'' Clement said. ``That 
had to go. She is also a brunette and we made her blonder.'' Ms. Kamena 
explained: ``These are not Rembrandts, not even false Rembrandts. 
They're simply illusions because cinema is illusion.'' On one point, 
though, Matton is eager to keep things real: He will not show Brandauer's 
Rembrandt painting a portrait from start to finish. ``We know the 
results of Rembrandt's work, but we do not know how he painted,'' 
he said. ``We don't know if he worked from sketches, if he started 
on the top or the bottom, on the left or the right, with the background 
or the foreground. So we have to be honest.'' As a painter, Matton 
has also had no hesitation in discouraging Brandauer from overacting 
his role before the canvas. ``People think that a painter is like 
the conductor of an orchestra, using big, sweeping, romantic, impulsive 
gestures,'' he noted. ``He is not. Painting is above all contemplative. 
The violence on the canvas is cerebral, not physical.'' As it happens, 
painters will have the last word in this $12 million movie in more 
ways than one. ``Charles Matton says that the makeup people should 
copy what we have done in the portraits,'' Clement said with undisguised 
satisfaction. ``So it goes full circle. We make the paintings look 
like the actors, then the actors are made to look like the paintings. 
Ah, the games of illusion.''
