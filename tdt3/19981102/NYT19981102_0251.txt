In July, a researcher in the Travel section came up with a question. 
Sabena was offering a restricted ticket for a round trip to Brussels 
for $904, which qualified as the best price on that route. However, 
he said Sabena also had a package trip, with hotel, for $830. How 
can this be, he asked. Good question. The opportunity to find out 
why and how an airline undercuts its own best fare with a weekend 
package came up again Oct. 14, when Sabena sent out word of a Thanksgiving 
package. This was priced at $750 a couple _ that is, $375 a person 
_ for a round trip to Brussels nonstop from Kennedy Airport in New 
York, or from Newark, Boston, Chicago or Atlanta, plus a double room 
for two nights in the Brussels Hilton, including breakfasts, hotel 
service charges, taxes and United States and Belgian departure fees 
and taxes. Only 350 of these were offered, the airline said: 50 seats 
on each of five flights, one for each city, plus 50 seats on an additional 
flight from New York and on one from Atlanta, both operated by Delta. 
They were all sold in 10 days. At the time, the best Sabena fare offer 
for a restricted round-trip ticket _ just the ticket _ was $616 a 
person. With taxes and fees, this would come to about $672, with variations 
for the exchange rate. For two, that would come to $1,364. Of course, 
there are substantial differences. The regular $672 nonrefundable 
ticket, available for use Nov. 1 to Dec. 10, permits travel Mondays 
to Thursdays, requires a seven-day stay and must be purchased 21 days 
in advance. Traveler's choice on the weeks and length of stay. The 
Thanksgiving package is locked in: it requires leaving for Brussels 
on Thanksgiving night, Nov. 26, and returning Sunday, Nov. 29. No 
changes or longer stays are possible. Travac, a New York agency that 
sells consolidator, or wholesale, tickets for Sabena, offered a price 
of $486, taxes included, for a Monday-Thursday round-trip ticket to 
Brussels and back to New York. Last-minute purchase is possible. As 
usual with consolidator tickets, this is less than Sabena's own quotation, 
but still above the package price. So the question remains: How come? 
The central reality of the Thanksgiving fare is that November and 
February are the slowest months for travel to Brussels. ``November 
is too early for Christmas shopping,'' said Nico Zenner, Sabena's 
deputy general manager for North and South America. ``In February 
the weather is tough.'' Zenner said all airlines serving Europe experienced 
these slumps. It is certainly true that Europe fares drop sharply 
in November. British Airways has a $288 round trip to London between 
Nov. 25 and Dec. 1; Iberia has a $298 fare to anywhere in Spain valid 
to Dec. 10. Both of these are bookable as late as 72 hours ahead; 
neither price includes taxes of about $50. As for Sabena, Zenner said: 
``We could drop the fare, but everyone competing with us would match 
it. And we can't compete in advertising. So we decided two years ago 
that we needed to add some values to our fare and get some exposure 
for Belgium and for us.'' By exposure, he meant publicity, and in 
this the line goes over the top periodically. Lucille Hoshabjian, 
speaking for Sabena, said that two years ago an Atlanta radio show 
rushed the news onto the air. Listeners called in furious because 
the package had already sold out: a travel agent had discovered it 
in the computer reservations system before the starting gun. Another 
weekend was added. Now, she says, people start calling in summer to 
see if the package will be offered again. While aiming at the two 
slow months, Zenner said that Brussels had an added factor in that 
it was not a weekend city. Business travel is heavy, he said, but 
on weekends hoteliers are looking at vacancies. Tourism officials 
call this situation ``empty seats, empty sheets.'' So Sabena felt 
it would find receptive ears for plans to bring in customers for weekends. 
``They are basically like us,'' Zenner said. ``Just as we have to 
fly the airplane and buy the fuel whether the seats are empty or not, 
they've got to keep a hotel running whether they have guests or not.'' 
Do the hotels provide free rooms in hope guests will at least buy 
a meal, rent a video, make a few phone calls, order room service, 
buy a souvenir? Zenner emphasized, ``We do pay something,'' although 
he said the line's agreement with the hotels precluded his saying 
what the airline pays for its 175 rooms. Well then, he was asked, 
Does the airline lose money on the transportation part of the $375-a-person 
package? Not really, he said. ``In the summer, when fares are high, 
we get a lot,'' he said. ``In November, not much.'' Referring to an 
Airbus 340 carrying 290 passengers, he said: ``We know from historic 
patterns that if 150 seats are likely to be empty, we might as well 
sell 50 of them in packages. ``You cannot say we lose money on selling 
that package.'' On the other hand, the Thanksgiving package is not 
being offered from Cincinnati. The weekend is selling too well there, 
he said. Thanksgiving is a clear choice for a promotional fare. ``It's 
already a long weekend,'' Zenner said, ``so people don't have to give 
up a vacation day to go to Europe, and they get two whole days on 
the ground and two nights. In addition, we have a lot of regular eastbound 
traffic on Friday _ business people want to get home to Europe for 
the weekend.'' Airlines do not make decisions on super-cheap packages 
until they see how regular business is for that weekend. The hotels 
also have to assess their space. The specials are supposed to appear 
in the travel agents' computer systems at the same time advertisements 
appear and notices are sent to the media. Alert travelers check with 
the lines and ask travel agents to keep a lookout for special packages. 
Sabena is candid about the small number of seats at the promotional 
price; the other airlines are probably offering a similar proportion 
of their seats. When Sabena began its Thanksgiving project three years 
ago, it got the Belgian government tourist office to underwrite dinners 
for the packages. There are no more free dinners, although the tourist 
office still helps. The hotels contribute breakfasts; they are not 
usually included with the rooms, Zenner said. Transfers to and from 
the airport are not included because Brussels has an airport train 
that costs $7. Back to July: The package in the high season that costs 
less than the regular fare is built on the same model, but less extreme. 
The $850 package, without taxes, was a Eurostay: a round trip from 
several cities with two nights in a hotel, travel permitted Monday 
to Thursday, a maximum stay of three months, and other restrictions. 
This package is still offered. It cost $599 a person in the shoulder 
season and on Nov. 1 went to $369, $425 with taxes. Sabena is getting 
its desired exposure for its packages and the fare is rising. This 
year's $750-a-couple package was $599 in 1997. If success continues, 
the gap may close. And if you don't stay in the hotel, does Sabena 
take your return ticket away? No. You can pay what you like, stay 
where you like.
