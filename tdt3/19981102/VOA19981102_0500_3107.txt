A group of seven industrial countries has agreed on a U.S. plan to 
strengthen the international financial system. In a joint statement 
Friday, G-7 finance ministers said they would urge the International 
Monetary Fund implement the plan. U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin 
calls it a necessary measure in an increasingly global economy. This 
is an enormous, particularly over the course of the past year, an 
enormous heightening of focus on preparing the global financial markets, 
or preparing the structure, the regulatory and other structure dealing 
with the global financial markets for what the modern global financial 
markets have become. The plan provides for faster disbursement of 
emergency IMF loans, while setting tougher terms for such loans and 
requiring the IMF to be more open about its policy decisions.
