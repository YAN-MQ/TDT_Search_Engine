The latest Middle East peace agreement is to take effect today. However, 
a major Islamic group is calling for bloody attacks on Israel in an 
attempt to kill the agreement. A leader of the Iranian backed Hezbollah 
group in Lebanon called on Palestinians to kill Israelis. At a rally 
in Southern Beirut yesterday, Sheik Hassan Nasrala urged Palestinians 
to kill Israeli soldiers and settlers. He said the accord is supposed 
to improve Israeli security, but renewed Palestinian attacks would 
worsen it causing Israeli unrest. Sheik Nasrala called Palestinian 
leader Yasir Arafat a traitor for agreeing to the peace deal and said 
he should also be killed.
