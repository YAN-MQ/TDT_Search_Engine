Veteran U.S. astronaut John Glenn and his six crew mates are on a 
welcomed afternoon off today from their busy work schedule aboard 
the U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery. As we hear from VOA's David Mcalary, 
some of the crew members are conducting research even while they sleep. 
Halfway through its nine-day mission, the Discovery team relaxed about 
7-1/2 hours, ignoring for a while the many research experiments that 
have packed their time in orbit. The 77-year-old Glenn and the other 
astronauts used part of the time to speak by video with family members 
back home. Mr. Glenn and Japanese astronaut Chiaki Mukai are in the 
second day of experiments using equipment including a wired head map 
that monitors brain waves and other physical characteristics while 
they sleep. Researchers want to know how the typical loss of one or 
two hours of sleep at night in orbit affects crew performance. Spain's 
minister of culture, Esperanza Agerre, spoke with Mr. Glenn and the 
first Spanish astronaut, Pedro Dukay. Ms. Agerre praised the U.S. 
senator, the first American to orbit Earth in 1962 as one of the great 
American living legends and an example for everybody. David Mcalary, 
VOA News, Washington.
