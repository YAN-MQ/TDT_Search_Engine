President Clinton says all options are open for dealing with Iraq's 
clear violation of commitments to the United Nations. The president 
meets today with his top national security advisers to discuss their 
recommendations for dealing with Baghdad. The security advisers met 
at the White House late Sunday after top Iraqi officials said again 
there will be no more U.N. inspections until U.N. trade sanctions 
against Iraq are lifted.
