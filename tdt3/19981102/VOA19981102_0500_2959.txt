And we're turning to business news right now. Les Carpenter joins 
us. Thank you very much. Well, stocks in Europe are higher this morning, 
led by exporters. Investors expect profits to rise after the U.S. 
economy grew 3.3 percent in the third quarter. The Frankfurt DAX is 
up 69 points, about 1.5 percent. In Paris, the CAC40 is 46 points, 
or 1.3 percent higher. And the London FATI is up 61 points. That's 
a little over on percent.
