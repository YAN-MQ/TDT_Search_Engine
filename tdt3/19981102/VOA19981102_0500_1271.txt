American golfer Hal Sutton has won the prestigious PGA Tour Championship 
Tournament in Atlanta, Georgia with an extra hole victory over V.J. 
Singh of Fiji. Sutton overcame a one shot deficit on the final hole 
of regulation play with a tremendous shot out of the sand combined 
with Singh's missed putt for par. The two leaders, who were then tied 
at six under par 274 for the tournament played the 18th hold again. 
Sutton was able to birdie the hole while Singh could not recover from 
an err in tee shot. Sutton says he's glad he chose a forward to tee 
off both times on the final hole. The first time I tried to go too 
easy and kind blocked it to the right. But I really wasn't that upset 
with it because I had the uphill shot out of the bunker. Second time, 
I mean, it really gave me some confidence to hit it the second time 
because I knew it was the right club if I just stayed in there with 
it. American Jim Furic and Jasper Parnovic of Sweden tied for third 
place.
