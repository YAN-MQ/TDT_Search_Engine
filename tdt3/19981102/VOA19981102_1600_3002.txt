Monique Maddy has transformed her business school thesis into Adesemi 
Communications, a company that is introducing low cost phone service 
to parts of the developing world. Economics correspondent Linda Cashden 
reports Adesemi is installing phones in Tanzania, Ghana, and Sri Lanka 
and is studying the feasibility of expanding to Latin America, Asia, 
and rural areas of Eastern Europe. The name Adesemi was chosen for 
two reasons: because it means regal in several West African dialects, 
and because it is the middle name of Monique Maddy, the 36-year-old 
Liberian born U.S. educated founder of the company. Ms. Maddy's business 
concept is simple: communications by voice mail only. Adesemi Communications 
sets up wireless public pay phones which are cheaper but have better 
sound quality than phones requiring cables. The company provides voice 
mail accounts and pagers that announce incoming messages. Those who 
receive messages need voice mail in return, using a phone card. The 
whole package is priced for people earning $200 a month. What's unique 
about our business I think also is that we're really focusing a lot 
on marketing and education, because bringing communication services 
to many of these places now requires quite a bit of education because 
it's something that many of them, it was a luxury, you know, and now 
we're saying is not a luxury, you know, it's a necessity and will 
make your life much easier, and you know, they educated to the custom 
of using the phone not just for emergencies but just to conduct everyday 
business. After six years of research and sales pitches to potential 
backers, Ms. Maddy has raised $37 million in financing. Adesemi Communications 
chose Tanzania for its first installment because the country has only 
78,000 phones and 27 million people. We've been getting, you know, 
tremendous requests from, you know, all over the world, China, India, 
and we've spoken with analysts in industry and they have agreed. I 
mean, they've acknowledged that this is something that's very new, 
very different because your typical operator will go in and target, 
you know, the top echelon with just cellular service and is not really 
increasing penetration. It's really just giving those who already 
had, you know, more options whereas we're going and really increasing 
penetration. Ms. Maddy's goal is to become a model of economic development, 
a profit making business that is helping to create other profit making 
businesses. Linda Cashden, VOA News, Washington.
