NATIONAL FORECAST Blustery winds from the northwest circulating around 
nearly stationary low pressure over New Brunswick will deliver very 
chilly air to the Northeast on Tuesday. Afternoon temperatures will 
be far below seasonal averages. Clouds will be abundant over northern 
New England, where mountain flurries and valley sprinkles will occur. 
There will be several hours of sunshine near the southern New England 
coast. As the chilly air seeps south of the Mason-Dixon line, low 
pressure in the western Carolinas will send a wedge of mild, moist 
air northward. As the warm air glides up and over the expanding dome 
of cool air, the result will be areas of rain and drizzle over the 
middle Atlantic states. The heaviest rain will likely occur across 
southern Virginia, where up to one-half inch of rain may fall. Farther 
south, patchy thundershowers will precede an associated cold front 
traversing the Deep South. Moist winds from the east will prevail 
from the Ohio valley to the southern Plains states, sponsoring an 
expansive area of low clouds with embedded pockets of light rain and 
drizzle. Over the western Plains, showers will be greater in number 
as the east winds are forced to ascend the sloping terrain. Cold air 
will change the rain to snow across western Nebraska. Snow will also 
fall in the higher elevations of the northern Rockies. A stream of 
Pacific air will invade the Northwestern states. Showers will develop 
near the coast and press inland. Snow will be confined to the highest 
elevation of the northern Cascades. Meanwhile, sinking air currents 
will prompt abundant sunshine over the Southwest. FOCUS: Rare Ice 
Storm Freezing rain glazed McGrath, Alaska, for much of Sunday night, 
an unusually long ice storm for this town nestled in the western interior 
of the state. Moreover, by 4 a.m. on Monday, nearly a third of an 
inch of rain had been measured, all of it freezing on contact with 
the ground and other cold objects. This is an unusually high total 
of freezing rain at McGrath, given the town's great distance from 
moisture in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. With regard to both 
duration and amount of freezing rain, such an ice storm is expected 
to occur in McGrath only once in every ten to twenty years.
