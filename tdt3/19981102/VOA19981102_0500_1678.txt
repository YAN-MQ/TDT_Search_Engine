Well, it's an interesting day in the history of U.S. agriculture and 
the history of the great plains and the land out there in what we 
used to call the Wild West. On Monday, November 2nd, 125 years ago 
- that was in 1873 - a factory in Chicago, Illinois began to manufacture 
barbed wire. Now barbed wire had been invented by a farmer whose name 
is Joseph Glidden to prevent wandering bison and cattle from trampling 
or eating his crops. Within months, the Chicago factory was producing 
thousands of kilometers of the wire. Ranchers at first hated the new 
stuff, cursing it for allowing farmers to close off what had once 
been open prairie grazing range. The ranchers called it the devil's 
rope. However, they soon learned the value of restricting their cattle 
to their own land. By 1900, most privately owned range land in America's 
West had been enclosed with barbed wire.
