A controversy broke out involving top wheelchair athletes at the New 
York City Marathon Sunday when all but the first two of the wheelchair 
racers, who started 10 minutes in front of everyone else, were stopped 
by police at the 15-mile mark for up to 35 minutes to allow the lead 
packs of men and women _ and the 30 trucks, motorcycles and police 
vehicles accompanying them _ to cross the Queensboro Bridge first. 
``It was a slap in the face, an insult,'' said Tom Gorman of Littlestown, 
Pa., one of the wheelchair racers. ``The last thing I want to do is 
complain, but we were so far ahead of the runners there was no need 
to stop us.'' Gorman, 42, was competing in his third New York marathon 
``and probably my last.'' Allan Steinfeld, president of the New York 
Road Runners Club, said the halt was a safety measure because this 
year there is no longer an outer roadway on the bridge for the wheelchairs 
and others to use. In the past, he said, both the outer roadway and 
the lower roadway were used. In addition, a Road Runners statement 
noted that New York City Marathon's policy was to stop wheelchairs 
``to let elite runners through, because this race does not have an 
official wheelchair division.'' But Steinfeld emphasized that vehicles, 
not people, were the problem. ``The runners can run single-file,'' 
he said, but the news media and police vehicles take up a lot of room. 
Richard Traum, president of the Achilles Track Club, the international 
organization devoted to marathoners with disabilities, said he was 
aware of the plan to halt the wheelchairs. But apparently word never 
reached the racers. Traum, who is a board member of both clubs, said 
he thought the Achilles and Road Runners clubs needed to talk about 
the matter. ``Elite wheelchair racers running with runners on foot 
is dangerous,'' he said. On sharp turns such as the one at the Manhattan 
end of the Queensboro Bridge, wheelchairs could conceivably knock 
down elite runners. On the other hand, elite wheelchair racers have 
criticized the Road Runners Club in the past for treating them as 
second-class entrants. Traum acknowledged that the two clubs have 
had a contentious relationship. During the 1995 marathon, high winds 
blew away plywood that had been laid on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge 
to make the bridge surface smoother for the wheelchairs, forcing the 
race organizers to bus the wheelchair racers to the Brooklyn side 
of the bridge. About 200 wheelchair athletes entered Sunday's event. 
Because the fastest wheelchair racers can barrel downhill on the course 
at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour, some usually finish the race 
with times better than the official winner of the foot race. Gorman, 
for example, said that after subtracting his 35-minute, police-enforced 
wait, his finishing time was 2 hours 2 minutes. John Kagwe, the men's 
winner, finished the race in 2:08:45. Dana Jackson of Washington, 
D.C., another wheelchair racer forced to halt as he approached the 
Queensboro Bridge, said the elite foot runners were not yet in sight 
when the wheelchairs were ordered to stop. Jackson, 41 years old, 
who works for the Department of Justice, called it ``one of the worst 
cases of discrimination I've seen.'' Steinfeld responded to the wheelchair 
racers' complaints by saying, ``Communications is always a problem.''
