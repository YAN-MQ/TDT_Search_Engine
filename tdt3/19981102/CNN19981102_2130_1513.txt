hollywood comedies have come a long way since the slapstick days of 
the marx brothers and three stooges. michael okwu looks at several 
new comedies that deal with some pretty demented subject matter. we 
were very, very bad. how's this for funny? guys at a bachelor party 
accidentally kill a hooker during rough sex, slice the body with a 
chain saw, and bury it in the desert. i hope more than anything else 
is that i know the movie's going to shock people and shake them up 
a bit. but i want people to be able to laugh at it and have some fun 
with it, too. when peter berg's "very bad things" hits theaters this 
month, it will become the latest movie to make light of some pretty 
dark subjects, a trend critics have coined -- the new geek cinema, 
where every film is trying to be more outrageous than the other. and 
there's this kind of self-conscious "can you top this" thing happening 
in a lot of films. to hear the stars describe their films, the cinematic 
one-upmanship has a common comic color. it's a black comedy. it's 
sort of a dark buddy comedy. it's just one of those sick, twisted 
comedies. some of the things that are, are, are more graphic and people 
have problems with are some of the funniest things in the film. dylan 
baker plays a pedophile in todd solondz's comedy, "happiness," while 
otherwise regular joes in "your friends and neighbors" and "the alarmist" 
are, essentially, rapists. then there's always -- man overboard. a 
movie like "clay pigeons" that has the funny serial killer -- wa, 
wa, wa. and the idea of the funny serial killer is sort of a newfound 
trend. barney, would you not poke the body with a stick, please. as 
janeane garofalo, one of the stars of "clay pigeons," explains, comical 
killers may be new, but -- there's always been a lot of black comedies. 
it's just that the movie business has changed so much in the last 
five years or so that more independent, smaller films are being seen 
by more people. and so there's always been dark comedies around. they're 
just more in our consciousness now. as for pushing the envelope into 
the future -- there are taboos that have yet to be broken, but they're 
so disgusting that i really hope that they never are broken. but, 
you know, if anybody is asking me for suggestions, i'm keeping them 
to myself. filmmakers will just have to find their own place to go 
after dark. michael okwu, "cnn entertainment news," new york.
