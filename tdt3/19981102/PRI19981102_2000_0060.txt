President Clinton spent the eve of the election campaigning for Democratic 
votes. He invited doctors and nurses to a White House event in which 
he called on voters to support candidates who will work for his patients' 
bill of rights. Earlier in the day, he gave a series of interviews 
to black and Hispanic media in hopes of raising the turnout of these 
traditionally Democratic voters. In several interviews he accused 
Republicans of hoping for a low turnout of African American voters 
who could make the difference in key Senate races in Illinois, South 
Carolina, North Carolina and California.
