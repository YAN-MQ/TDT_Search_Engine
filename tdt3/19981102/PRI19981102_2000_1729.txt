You're listening to the World and don't forget, you can join us anytime 
online at www.theworld.org. This is the World on PRI, Public Radio 
International. Wouldn't it be great if you knew who was going to be 
on Fresh Air tomorrow, not to mention Radio Times, Talk of the Nation, 
Morning Edition and more. Well, your wishes have been answered because 
91 FM will send you that information automatically every day by electronic 
mail. To subscribe, visit the 91 FM section of the WHYY web site and 
follow the simple instructions. The web site is located at whyy.org. 
Once again, that's whyy.org I'm Lisa Mullins. Still to come on the 
World, while Democrats may be taking Hispanics for granted, Republicans 
are sensing a new source of votes. And while the Palestinians submit 
their plan to combat extremist violence, Israel delays a vote on the 
Wye River agreement. Also ahead, Cuba's legacy of slavery reveals 
itself in music and in religion. 29: 50 First up, this news.
