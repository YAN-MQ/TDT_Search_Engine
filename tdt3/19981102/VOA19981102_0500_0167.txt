Hundreds of bodies are being recovered from mud and flood waters in 
Nicaragua after a rain-soaked mountainside collapsed on several villages 
in the northwestern part of the country near the Honduran border. 
As VOA's Greg Flakus reports from Mexico City, rains have now diminished 
in most parts of the Nicaragua and Honduras, but flood waters are 
hampering rescue efforts. More than 1,000 people remain missing in 
northwestern Nicaragua as the result of a massive avalanche that came 
down the side of the Casedas volcano Friday. Rain, combined with the 
remoteness of the area, made rescue efforts difficult. Witnesses on 
the scene tell of hundreds of nude corpses washed down the mountainside 
by the mud. In some cases, the force of the moving mud and water tore 
bodies apart. In some downstream areas, witnesses say arms and legs 
and heads have of victims can be seen protruding from the debris. 
Flood waters in Nicaragua have cut off at least 172 villages and destroyed 
more than 5,000 homes. The rapid flood waters also destroyed more 
than 35 bridges and 24 roads. The devastation in Nicaragua and other 
parts of Central America is the result of a week-long downpour of 
heavy rain from Hurricane Mitch, which was later downgraded to a tropical 
storm. Greg Flakus, VOA News, Mexico City.
