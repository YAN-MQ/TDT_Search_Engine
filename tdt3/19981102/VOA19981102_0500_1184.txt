Runner John Cagway of Kenya has successfully defended his title as 
the winner of the New York City marathon on Sunday, while Franca Fiaconi 
of Italy led the women. Correspondent Larry Fein reports from New 
York. As they neared the marathon finish line in Central Park, John 
Cagway was running side by side with his fellow Kenyan, Joseph Chebet 
and with Zebedayo Bayo of Tanzania. But then Cagway opened his stride 
moving ahead of Bayo and then opening a three second lead over Chebet. 
Among the women, the winner was Franca Fiaconi of Italy, who ran a 
close race with Tegro Larupe of Kenya, winner of the New York Marathon 
in 1994 and 1995 for much of the course. But Larupe suffered from 
intestinal problems during the race and finished several minutes behind 
Fiaconi in third place. In second place among the women was Adrianna 
Fernandez of Mexico. Fiaconi is the first Italian to win the women's 
division of the New York City Marathon. Larry Freund, VOA News, New 
York.
