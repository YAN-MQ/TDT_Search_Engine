I wonder how many of the parents who brought their children to the 
New York City Opera's ``Cunning Little Vixen'' on Sunday afternoon 
quite realized the burden being placed on innocent eyes and ears. 
There were indeed the anthropomorphic pleasures of Maurice Sendak's 
cuddly forest creatures and the fairy-tale whimsy of the production's 
painted cutouts and backdrops. But Janacek's opera, small in stature 
yet transcendent in tone, is anything but a children's piece. This 
lovely, touching tribute to the remorselessness of nature portrays 
as well as any art I know the impotence of human values in the face 
of the regenerative process. The Forester, his family and friends 
may kill the fox, skin the fox or capture the fox, but the fox lives 
on in the cycle of life, death and rebirth. If the Schoolmaster is 
lovelorn, the Priest drunk and Harasta on the sexual prowl _ if as 
they grow old, they feebly assign significance to their individual 
lives _ nature does not really seem to care. The sets by Neil Peter 
Jampolis and costumes by Steven Feldman, both after Sendak's designs, 
threaten a cuteness that neither Janacek nor Sendak will allow. The 
music has a protean loveliness, with swimming, shifting surges of 
meter and color. There is an underlying darkness to the artist's view 
that reminds us of childhood's unpleasant mysteries as well as its 
simple pleasures. This is difficult music. George Manahan and his 
orchestra feel the beauties strongly and manage the intricacies passably 
well. Robin Blitch Wiper is a delight as Vixen Sharp-Ears, agile both 
of voice and limb. Richard Paul Fink is a strong presence as the Forester. 
John Avey (the Priest), Peter Kazaras (the Schoolmaster), George Cordes 
(Harasta) and Kristen Garver (Terynka) represent the human contingent. 
Abbie Furmanski (Golden Stripe), Joseph McKee (the Badger), Kate Butler 
(the Dog), Valerie Bernhardt (the Rooster) and Leslie McBride (the 
Hen) are among the voices emanating from a host of animal and insect 
suits. Frank Corsaro, who directs, has an awful lot of bodies to fit 
onto the City Opera's smallish stage; he is also dealing with many 
child performers. Small clumsinesses seemed unavoidable. The English 
translation by Robert T. Jones and Yveta Synek Graff is clear enough, 
and there are surtitles (also in English) just to make sure. Children 
ready for the unromantic aspects of life and death should go. For 
thoughtful opera lovers, attendance is almost obligatory.
