President Clinton will meet today with his top national security advisers 
to discuss a plan for dealing with Iraq. Mr. Clinton's top military 
diplomatic and intelligence officials gathered at the White House 
Sunday night to consider Baghdad's refusal to cooperate with U.N. 
weapons inspections unless economic sanctions against Iraq are lifted. 
VOA's Jim Randle reports. After the unusual Sunday gathering, a White 
House spokesman said the international community is united and insisting 
Iraq comply with U.N. resolutions. White House spokesman Barry Toym 
also said Washington welcomes Saturday's United Nations' action rejecting 
Iraq's latest attempt to block U.N. weapons inspections. The spokesman 
told VOA all options remain on the table and added Washington will 
consult with its allies and others with a direct stake in the situation 
in Iraq. He said President Clinton has been briefed several times 
on the situation and will meet with the National Security team later 
Monday. Saturday, the United Nations Security Council denounced Iraq 
for ending cooperation with the U.N. Weapons Inspection Commission, 
UNSCOM. The council called Iraq's action a flagrant violation of council 
resolutions and demanded that the inspections resume. Iraq suspended 
all cooperation with the inspection commission protesting the U.N. 
backed disarmament process and economic sanctions. U.N. inspectors 
have been in Iraq trying to verify Iraq's claims that it no longer 
has any weapons of mass destruction. Such verification is required 
by council resolutions approved after the Gulf War. U.N. Security 
General Kofi Annan diffused a similar crisis earlier this year by 
traveling to Baghdad for talks with Iraq President Saddam Hussein. 
U.S. Defense officials say American forces are not on any unusual 
alert, however some 29,000 armed forces personnel are on station near 
Iraq, and they can use their 15 warships, 172 aircraft, and many cruise 
missiles to strike Iraq if Washington decides to use military force.
