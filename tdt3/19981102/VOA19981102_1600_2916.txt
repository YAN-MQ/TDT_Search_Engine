We had a very good day with the Dow Jones Industrials Average closing 
at 8706. That's up 114 points. Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed 
at 1111. That was up almost 13 points. And NASDAQ gained 29. This 
strong start to November followed a 9-1/2 percent gain in the industrial 
average in October. That was the biggest monthly gain since January 
of 1987. Now October, of course, has historically been a bad month 
for stocks, one that traders usually face with caution, but I guess 
last month proves the standard Wall Street warning that prior performance 
is no guarantee of future results.
