Turkish officials say they have foiled plans by a Turkish Islamic 
group to carry out a suicide attack at the mausoleum of the founder 
of secular Turkey. Istanbul's governor says police detained 23 members 
of a German based group that had planned to crash a plane loaded with 
explosives into the mausoleum. The governor says Turkey is starting 
procedures to extradite the group's suspected leader from Germany.
