And American blues legend B.B. King had a bit of a scare last week. 
It seems that, Lucille, picked a fine time to leave B.B. King. He 
was all ready to go on stage in Kingston, New York last week. Unfortunately 
the tour bus carrying his instrument was lost. Kingston's mayor was 
among those waiting in the audience and he dispatched police to go 
out and find the missing bus and then escort it to the concert hall. 
Ten minutes later, an officer did spot the bus with the guitar headed 
out of town instead of towards the theater. The patrolman got them 
turned around and reports that the show was wonderful once it got 
started. I'm Katherine Cole.
