A gray-wigged Bill Clinton impersonator wobbles and lurches, bug-eyed 
and horrified, from one sexual malapropism to another. He sings ``If 
I Was a Rich Man,'' from ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' in a suggestive 
Yiddish-sounding muddle of imaginary body parts. Two reporters happen 
upon Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones, and they all break into a randy 
version of ``Chattanooga Choo Choo'' about seeing something other 
than a train. Can this still be funny? Apparently so, if the reaction 
of audiences at the Chicago City Limits comedy review ``Subpoenas 
Envy'' is any indication. The question that arises is if everyone 
is so sick of Washington's endless sexual soap opera, how come there 
is always room for one more good cigar or dry cleaning joke at the 
expense of the Big He? And the answer seems to be, for better or worse, 
that it's now the American way. Thus Nicole Baker says she has the 
same view of the Clinton follies as almost everyone else does: She's 
sick of it. She wants it to go away. She'd be thrilled if the whole 
sordid ensemble quietly slunk off somewhere. She is even a supporter 
of Clinton. But there she was the other night, at the comedy club, 
at First Avenue and 61st Street in Manhattan, feeling almost patriotic 
about being entertained by presidential anatomy humor, presidential 
lying humor and the general run of scandal humor that a veritable 
comedy-industrial complex of clubs, late-night comics and Web sites 
have been churning out for almost a year now. ``I think the whole 
thing has been blown way out of proportion, but I guess I like the 
fact that people can be so brazen in saying whatever they want about 
Clinton,'' said Ms. Baker, who works as a theatrical stage manager. 
``I think it's great that we're in America and can say whatever we 
think. Actually, it would be nice if he could see it.'' Similarly, 
Morris Davidson, a retired New Jersey neurosurgeon turned New York 
boulevardier, rolled his eyes at the notion that the American people 
were sick of hearing about Clinton's seamy travails. ``They love it,'' 
he said. ``They're not tired of it. They're on it like wolves.'' Chicago 
City Limits has been mixing topical humor with free-form improvisation 
in New York since 1979. On a typical evening, the four-member troupe 
veers from a quick-witted blizzard of Clinton skits to improvisations 
on Paul McCartney's ``Let It Be'' as interpreted by Chekhov and Mamet 
to Dolly the Cloned Sheep's soulful version of the blues song ``Bad 
to the Bone.'' (``Baaaaah, I'm a clone. Baaabaaabaaabaahhhhh, I'm 
a clone.'') The cast members of Chicago City Limits say they don't 
want to do too much of the Clinton humor, which despite the show's 
name is less than 20 percent of the material. ``For a while I thought, 
if you do Monica Lewinsky, it's just a cheap laugh,'' said Denny Siegel, 
the only woman in the troupe. ``But I realize it's become like an 
in-joke that people want to share. They're waiting for it to come 
up; there's like a gratified laugh I've come to recognize. You know, 
someone brings up the pizza story again, and everyone cracks up. ``If 
we didn't use it, I don't know if people would walk out feeling cheated, 
but there's that sense of recognition, camaraderie, fellowship, as 
if we're all sharing something, and it's fine as long as we don't 
overdo it.'' There are, by now, subsets of Clinton comedy: late-night 
one-liners; Clinton impersonators; the panoply of Internet humor, 
from Bill Clinton as the Dancing Baby, to The Official Bill Clinton 
Is a Marionette Who Is Controlled By Aliens Web Page, to the Bill 
Clinton Joke of the Day. (Heard the one about Bill Clinton and Jerry 
Falwell on an airplane?) Clearly, this is not a scandal that is spawning 
modern-day Molieres. And with saturation coverage of impossible-to-top 
marathons like the president's bravura performance piece of grand 
jury testimony, it is easier to imagine people paying money not to 
be reminded of the Clinton-Lewinsky-Tripp saga than paying to be entertained 
by it. ``People say, `Oh, you must be having a field day with this,''' 
said Paul Zuckerman, the show's producer and director. ``But I keep 
thinking, `What else do you say about it?' It plays to a voyeuristic 
side we all have, but it's been hard. And it's moved so fast. ``You 
wouldn't believe how many pieces we had to discard because the situation 
changed. Actually, I liked Watergate better. Nixon was an easier target 
and the cast of characters, Haldeman, Ehrlichman. Now those were creepy 
guys.'' On the other hand, the commingling of politics and entertainment 
has come a long way since Watergate. The soaring ratings of the nonstop 
cable blabfests about the Clinton saga are probably the best example. 
But the persistence of Clinton comedy, even among his supporters, 
shows how the scandal has morphed from a political event to mass entertainment, 
what George magazine this month calls ``a rather low-budget sexual 
thriller'' with Hollywood's favored pairing of an older man and a 
younger woman and a sprawling cast of impeccably drawn character actors 
in supporting roles. Indeed, even those on Clinton's side in the end 
sounded more like critics of theater than of politics. ``I thought 
it was all very funny,'' said Jerry Cox, who writes hip-hop music 
and poetry and supports Clinton. ``But if it was me, I'd want a skit 
with Starr. You could have him as this guy who's searching for something 
that's not there and then it's like he takes whatever he can get. 
He's looking for gold, but finds silver, so he says, `OK, I'll settle 
for silver.''' It is often argued that there is something debased 
in the whole process, that Clinton's behavior or the national political 
meltdown surrounding it is no joke, and just as it is impossible to 
imagine comedy skits based on Dwight D. Eisenhower's anatomy, the 
society has come down a few notches on the evolutionary scale since 
then. But then who knows? Carl Kissin, who portrays Clinton in the 
show, argues that the role of comedy has always been to throw cream 
pies at the powerful, and audiences inevitably find some measure of 
enjoyment in the foibles of the rich and powerful. Staying current 
is, of course, the curse of topical comedy. One of the show's more 
popular bits has people counting down excitedly, ``Five, four, three, 
two, one,'' and then exclaiming, ``Who would have thought the Dow 
would hit zero!'' It was funnier a month ago with the Dow in free 
fall than it is with it at least temporarily stabilized now. But, 
then, while scandals ebb and flow, some comedic verities, like enjoying 
the misfortunes of others, are probably eternal. ``What did Mel Brooks 
say?'' said John O'Donnell, another cast member. ``Tragedy is if I 
cut my finger. Comedy is if you fall into an open manhole and die.''
