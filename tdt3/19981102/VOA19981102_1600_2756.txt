Scientists working to eliminate dangerous food poisoning microbes 
from the U.S. poultry supply have tracked the germs back to their 
source America's chicken farms. Now they're working to keep the birds 
free of the often deadly pathogens. Norman Stern, a microbiologist 
with the U.S. Agricultural Research Service says he and his colleagues 
are using the unique genetic fingerprints of each strain of salmonella, 
campola bactor and other germs to track their movements through the 
farm environment. Their tests can determine whether the bacteria are 
being introduced through tainted feed or by insects, rodents, wild 
birds, or other farm animals. Mr. Stern says farmers and ranchers 
can use that information to close off these avenues of infection and 
provide processors and consumers with poultry that is healthier and 
safer to eat.
