The young street people were leaning against a store window, watching 
the police watching them from a second- floor window across the avenue. 
``They'll arrest us for anything now,'' Justin Montgomery, 22, said 
as he dragged on a cigarette. ``They're just waiting for any excuse 
at all.'' ``They say we scare people,'' said Orin Wells, 21, who was 
sitting on the sidewalk clutching a chubby nine-week-old mixed-breed 
German shepherd. ``Are we scary?'' Whether they are scared or just 
plain fed up, plenty of people in the nation's most famously liberal 
city want the youths, panhandlers, drug addicts, drinkers, mentally 
ill homeless swept off Telegraph Avenue, the shopping district here 
mentioned in every tourist guide. Last week, the all-Democratic City 
Council, which is dominated by a progressive faction, unanimously 
passed an emergency measure authorizing police overtime to fight the 
drug dealing and disperse the entrenched camps of the homeless. The 
police have been all over Telegraph Avenue, in squad cars, on bicycles 
and in front of businesses. ``They've started turning things around,'' 
said Andy Ross, owner of Cody's Books, a hangout that has stood at 
the most popular gathering spot for the homeless, the corner of Telegraph 
Avenue and Haste Street, for 21 years. ``A few days ago,'' Ross said, 
``There were 50 people camped out in front of Cody's dealing drugs 
and menacing my customers.'' Store owners started complaining about 
the youths at least a year ago. In particular, they have complained 
about the young people who come from all over the country to linger 
on Telegraph and Haste. The situation is much like that one in San 
Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, which is also showing signs of 
battle fatigue. Homeless people have congregated here for 30 years, 
but many locals say the more recent newcomers have more than tested 
the limits of tolerance with their drinking, drug dealing, defecating, 
urinating and aggressive panhandling. Not to mention their sheer numbers: 
20 to 30 congregate at any one time in one corner, most of them with 
dogs. Last week, when one store, Half Price Books, announced it was 
moving out because of the youths, and five others threatened to do 
the same, Mayor Shirley Dean, declared that the situation had gone 
from ``severe to critical.'' ``This used to be a vibrant place,'' 
Dean said. ``It's not anymore. It's become a menacing place, where 
hard, hard drugs are dealt, there have been people having sex on the 
sidewalks, S&AMP;M sex on the sidewalk, anti-Semitic graffiti.'' Over 
the last two weeks, before the crackdown, two windows at Cody's Books 
were smashed, one apparently by a vandal, the other by a young man 
who was shoved into it in a fight, Ross said. In recent months, business 
has dropped by 15 percent in the day, he said, 75 percent at night. 
At night, many of the youths had taken to sleeping along the wall, 
cocooned in blankets, bodies scattered like bowling pins. In the daytime, 
they would use the wall as a back rest as they smoked pot and sold 
drugs. Now, the people who are still hanging around gather in small, 
wary clutches. Homeless advocates question the timing of the crackdown, 
just before the mayor and half the City Council members are up for 
re-election. ``We really believe this is an election-motivated issue,'' 
said Sally Hindman, executive director of the Chaplaincy for the Homeless, 
which runs a drop-in center for homeless runaway youth a block from 
Telegraph Avenue. ``There is something appealing to people about hearing 
tough-on-crime talk.'' Hindman said the city would be wiser to address 
the problems of homelessness, rather than criminalize the behavior 
of the people on the street. ``On any night, there are 1,000 to 1,200 
people sleeping on the streets of Berkeley,'' she said. ``Half of 
them are deinstitutionalized mentally ill people. It's like a mental 
ward on the streets. Some of them are on drugs. But we have no detox 
center in Berkeley.'' Hindman said the youths, most of them between 
18 and 25, tend to come from severely troubled families, and that 
21 out of 27 youths the center has counseled have diagnosable mental 
illnesses, including post-traumatic stress. ``You talk to them once, 
they'll say they're traveling,'' she said. ``You start talking to 
them more, they'll tell you they left because their parents were beating 
them.'' The mayor said she is proposing a plan that involves both 
increased social services for the homeless youths and ``tough love.'' 
That includes pushing them off the streets with an anti-encampment 
ordinance. ``I don't think they'll seek services if they don't get 
a nudge,'' she said. Some of the young people have come up with their 
own plan, which they presented to the City Council last week. They 
promise that they will stop urinating and sleeping on Telegraph Avenue, 
panhandle in smaller groups, keep their dogs on leashes and pick up 
their trash. In return, they have asked the city to provide more trash 
cans, create a dog run, clean the public bathrooms more often and 
open Berkeley's first shelter for young people. The mayor called the 
plan ``interesting.'' But on Telegraph and Haste, there were grumblings 
that the city would never take the plan seriously. ``They're making 
us out to be devils,'' Orin Wells said. He said he comes here from 
British Columbia when the weather gets cold there. ``People are getting 
arrested for selling $10 worth of pot,'' Wells said. ``They're not 
even the drug dealers. They get $20 worth of pot from the real drug 
dealers and sell it for a $5 cut, just to eat.'' Nearby, a group of 
homeless people were quietly nodding. Wells shook his head in disgust. 
``This is Telegraph and Haste,'' he said. ``My parents used to hang 
out here when they were young. This is a part of history, whether 
they like it or not.''
