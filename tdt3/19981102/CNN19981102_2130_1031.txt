many air travelers are concerned with the rising number of unscheduled 
landings due to smoke in the cockpit. dan ronan looks at how pilots 
and aviation officials are handling the problem in this edition of 
"working ahead." pilots say smoke in the cockpit and being forced 
to make an unscheduled landing can be one of the scariest situations 
they'll deal with. not only may the plane have a malfunction, but 
the pilot's visibility and ability to breathe can be hampered. all 
of the electrical connections come into the cockpit or come into a 
compartment underneath the cockpit. so if there's an electrical short, 
you're going to get some kind of a smell, just like if you get a short 
in the wiring in your house. it doesn't necessarily start a fire, 
but you'll have that -- that acrid smell. in the two months since 
the swissair accident, there have been at least eight unscheduled 
landings because of smoke in the cockpit. that's twice as many as 
the faa usually receives. aviation experts say while the rules for 
landing a plane with smoke in the cockpit have not changed, because 
of the swissair crash, pilots may be more conservative. when an accident, 
any kind of accident happens, people become more sensitive to those 
kind of incidents. and smoke in the cockpit, of course, is one of 
the really scary things for a pilot. adding to the equation, many 
say the mainstream media are more aggressive about reporting aviation 
issues. but the airlines we spoke to do confirm they're telling their 
pilots, "if there's smoke in the cockpit, don't take chances, land 
the plane." dan ronan, cnn, atlanta.
