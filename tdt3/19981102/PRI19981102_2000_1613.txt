Americans are not doing what their parents told them to do. They're 
not saving for a rainy day. New statistics released today put the 
savings rate in the minus range. In other words, Americans are spending 
more than they're making. The -.2 percent saving rate is the lowest 
since they started keeping records back in 1959. Here's Liz George 
at the World's business desk in New York. America's always been a 
nation of spenders, often termed the consumers of last resort, doing 
most of the buying for the world, especially at times of crisis. So 
who's doing the saving for us? Ash Regan is the vice president of 
the Prudential in New York. You'd be surprised that in an indirect 
way, the U.S. has provided a target rich environment for the rest 
of the countries in the world, the rest of the economies in the world 
to invest here. It's not just commercial investing, not just business 
investing. We talk about real estate. We're talking about ancillary 
and investing too. And that has created sufficient savings and investment 
pool to keep the Americans going. And at some point, there's going 
to be a wake up call and the wake up call will be the Japanese completely 
ignore our Treasuries or the Germans or the English completely ignore 
corporate or real estate investing, when we come back and say, you 
know what, we have to do some savings in order to propel investments. 
While Americans are saving virtually nothing, other nations save between 
6 and 30 percent of their earnings. Japan being one of the largest 
savers. Ash Regan again. The average Japanese person saves too much 
and that savings has not been redeployed back into the economy. I 
think the Japanese are finally getting the message, hopefully they'll 
use public money to stimulate the economy. But even if Americans aren't 
saving, they are investing. It's worth bearing in mind the U.S. has 
one of the largest proportions of private investment on the stock 
exchange, something which points to continued confidence, at least 
among consumers here in the U.S. For the World, I'm Liz George in 
New York.
