Since casting a ballot for Harry Truman in 1948, Harold Hiles, a World 
War II veteran, has always deemed it an honor and a duty to vote. 
But on this Election Day, he is staying home. ``Don't want any part 
of it,'' said Hiles, 76, over a piece of apple pie on Sunday morning, 
as church bells pealed in this small Midwestern city. ``Clinton, Starr, 
the whole bunch of them. Who do you believe anymore? Who can you respect? 
People are just losing faith.'' For all the handicapping about the 
races between Democrats and Republicans on Tuesday, there is little 
doubt what a majority of Americans will effectively choose: none of 
the above. It is a virtual certainty that fewer than half of all eligible 
voters will visit the polls on Tuesday; some political analysts say 
the number could plummet to about one-third. While grousing about 
politicians is a time-honored American tradition, would-have-been-voters 
say this campaign season has wallowed in far more than the usual level 
of muck _ vicious name-calling, transparent pandering and, of course, 
the lascivious details about President Clinton's sexual behavior. 
``It just seems like politics are spinning out of control,'' said 
Jerry Hanck, a 60-year-old liquor salesman, who will sit out the election. 
``There are bad actors on both sides.'' It was in this old river town 
140 years ago that 10,000 people turned out at Washington Square for 
the first debate between Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, a discussion 
that focused on constitutional principles and the most fundamental 
of human rights. It does not escape notice here that the last national 
election of the 20th Century seems to be driven by sound bites, attack 
ads and sex talk that brings an embarrassed blush even to a crusty 
old Navy man like Hiles. But gauging the sensibilities of voters, 
especially when it comes to Clinton's affair with a former White House 
intern, is a tricky business. Hiles, a retired factory-glass union 
member, would surely fall in the approval column on the president's 
job rating. ``He's been a wonderful president,'' Hiles said. And yet, 
Hiles said he will boycott the ballot box on Tuesday largely because 
he disapproves of Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and 
the president's failure to tell the whole truth. It was a sentiment 
that surfaced frequently among nonvoters, mostly among Democrats. 
These were not people who intended to bolt to the Republican side. 
They had simply become dispirited. ''Democrats just feel kind of embarrassed 
right now,'' said Connie Jolley, 29, a restaurant manager. Ms. Jolley, 
who described herself as ``a majorly Democratic'' voter in most years, 
plans to go to the polls on Tuesday, but only to vote on a local referendum. 
She intends to skip the races for governor, Senate and the House, 
saying that she could not bring herself to vote for the Republicans, 
but did not believe the Democrats had earned her vote. Compared to 
voters, nonvoters are younger, less educated, have lower incomes and 
tend to support Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives, 
according to the latest New York Times/CBS poll. The poll, taken Oct. 
26 to 28, found that 32 percent of nonvoters are under age 30, compared 
with just 13 percent of voters. Nearly two-thirds of nonvoters have 
never attended college, whereas 43 percent of voters have not attended 
college. Forty percent of nonvoters have households incomes of less 
than $30,000 a year, compared to 24 percent of likely voters. In terms 
of preferences for the House of Representatives races, 49 percent 
of nonvoters favor Democratic candidates and 27 percent favor Republicans. 
The likely voters, meanwhile, were evenly split between the two parties. 
The 11th Congressional District here, which sweeps north and east 
across Illinois farmland to the industrial city of Joliet, has swung 
between Democrats and Republicans. It last changed parties in 1994, 
when Jerry Weller, a Republican, took office. Weller is widely expected 
to win re-election against his Democratic opponent, Gary Mueller. 
``People feel like, `What's the sense?''' said Mike Malles, a 33-year-old 
house painter, who skipped past the political news in the Sunday newspaper, 
and read the movie reviews. ``The noise is just too loud. There's 
so much hype. A lot of people just want to pull back.'' Mudslinging 
and scandal are surely not the only things keeping voters from the 
polls. Many people say they simply do not find politics interesting 
enough to spend much time dwelling on the issues. When Melissa Reynolds, 
a 19-year-old college student, asked, ``What are we voting for?'' 
she was not posing a rhetorical question. She was unaware that Tuesday 
was Election Day. ``I don't get into that stuff,'' said Miss Reynolds, 
who plans to become a grammar school teacher. With the economy in 
relatively good shape, many Americans have taken a fairly pacific 
view of political affairs, not motivated enough to demand sharp change. 
Others simply see the actions of political leaders as increasingly 
irrelevant to their daily lives. Dedra Phillips, who works as a quality 
analyst for a cookie company, said she was enjoying some prosperity 
these days. But she said politicians should leave her alone. And she 
plans to do them the same favor. ``Times are good for me because I 
make them that way,'' said Ms. Phillips, 28, who pushed a stroller 
that held her two young children. ``It has nothing to do with politicians.'' 
Diana Harden, a 33-year-old custodian, said she would stay away from 
the polls as a gesture of protest against politicians who she claimed 
operated on a different standard than ordinary Americans. ``They think 
they're better than the people who pay their salaries,'' said Ms. 
Harden, as she walked through a parking lot to the Wal-Mart store. 
``The only time you ever see them is at parade time.'' Susan Harnisch, 
a 47-year-old teacher at a corrections facility, said she would skip 
the voting booth because politicians had skipped the issues most relevant 
to people. ``They're wasting time on this investigation _ censure 
him, throw him out, let him go, whatever _ but let's get on with it,'' 
said Ms. Harnisch, who usually splits her ticket. She blamed Republicans 
for dwelling on the Starr investigation, but said the president, by 
his example, ``has made it much harder for the average person who 
wants to go out and do the right thing.'' But more than anything else, 
she said, she was annoyed by politicians who dwell on ``hot-button'' 
issues like gun control and abortion, while ignoring the complicated 
matters that come up in everyday life. ``Why don't they talk about 
things that hit home _ medical expenses, credit card debt, men who 
don't pay child support,'' said Ms. Harnisch. ``I'm not voting because 
it just doesn't seem to get through to them.''
