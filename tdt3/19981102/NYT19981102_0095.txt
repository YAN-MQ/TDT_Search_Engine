It did not take long for Prince Naseem Hamed to recover from the boos 
that rained down on him from the crowd of 8,138 at the Atlantic City 
Convention Center on Saturday night. Only an hour after his unspectacular 
12-round unanimous decision over Wayne McCullough, Hamed was threatening 
to knock out Angel Manfredy, the junior-lightweight dynamo who will 
fight Floyd Mayweather Jr. on Dec. 12. ``Do what you have to do and 
then you'll get beat like the rest of them,'' Hamed shouted at Manfredy, 
who was at the post-fight news conference. After Hamed's performance 
in retaining his World Boxing Organization featherweight title, it 
sounded more like bluster than his normal rhetoric. Hamed was running 
and backpedaling on his bicycle so much that he completed two phases 
of a triathlon during the 12-round bout. If there had been a moat 
around the ring, he would have completed the event. McCullough, who 
remained upright the whole fight despite Hamed's prediction of a third-round 
knockout, said: ``I just did what I could. Naseem hit me with his 
best shots in the first three rounds and then he decided to run away 
like an amateur for the rest of the fight.'' Hamed replied that he 
adopted the same strategy as Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard. Whatever 
the case, it was an unsatisfactory performance in the eyes of the 
Atlantic City crowd, which was swelled by Irish supporters of McCullough, 
a Belfast-born boxing silver medalist for Ireland in the 1992 Olympic 
Games in Barcelona, Spain. American crowds are accustomed to seeing 
fighters like Arturo Gatti, the lightweight who slings leather from 
the opening bell to the end. They have come to accept the juking style 
of Pernell Whitaker, but Whitaker doesn't run on with talk about flattening 
opponents. ``There is a certain level of expectation for a fighter 
like Hamed,'' said Seth Abraham, president of sports for HBO-Time 
Warner, which televised the fight. ``It was the same with Muhammad 
Ali. When he doesn't meet those expectations, people are disappointed. 
But they have to realize, in this game you're not going to pitch a 
shutout every time you step into the ring.'' Hamed scored big with 
the judges. The most rounds McCullough won on any card was four. According 
to the punch statistics compiled by Compubox, the two fighters threw 
almost the same number of punches _ 742 for Hamed and 740 for McCullough. 
But Hamed connected on twice as many (340 to 170) and on more power 
punches (55 percent to 34 percent). ``I don't understand how he landed 
two punches to one,'' McCullough said. ``I was flicking the jab and 
something was landing.'' Hamed's lackluster performance was set in 
motion last week when he couldn't get to the United States because 
his promoter failed to secure a work visa. He sat in London until 
Tuesday morning, while HBO scrambled to get him the visa. Hamed was 
in town for just four days before he climbed into the ring. The turnaround 
was just too short for him to be crisp. He acknowledged as much afterward, 
but said he didn't want to use his late arrival as an excuse. Once 
he realized he wasn't going to knock out McCullough, Hamed shifted 
his efforts to securing a victory and not getting hurt. It was a wily 
move, but it probably cost him some American fans. Hamed said his 
next United States fight will be in Las Vegas, though his next bout 
will be in London, possibly the first weekend in March. There is no 
shortage of opponents for Hamed, as witnessed by Manfredy's presence. 
The candidates include Marco Antonio Barrera, who scored a third-round 
technical knockout over Richie Wenton to win the WBO junior-featherweight 
title on the undercard. McCullough is sure of one thing. He won't 
be the next opponent. ``Aggressive fighters should get more points 
than I got,'' he said. ``That's why I deserve a rematch. But I probably 
won't get one.''
