Lava is flowing from Europe's tallest and most active volcano, Italy's 
Mt. etna. Officials say there is no immediate danger to residents 
on the slopes of mt. Etna because the new lava is being absorbed by 
old, dry lava. The volcano has been in minor activity for months. 
The last major eruption was in 1992.
