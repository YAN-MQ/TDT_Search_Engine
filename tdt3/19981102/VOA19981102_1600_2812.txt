In what it hopes will be a major boost for the rural economy, the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture says it is ear marking $200 million 
next year in loan guarantees for farmer cooperatives. That's double 
last year's amount. Nearly 75 percent of the nation's farmers already 
belong to some form of cooperative, private enterprises in which the 
costs and benefits of production, processing, or marketing are shared 
equally among farmer members. Dayton Watkins, head of Cooperative 
Business Services for the U.S. Department of Agriculture says the 
bigger loan guaranteed program will help more small farmers secure 
commercial credit for all sorts of cooperative ventures. Development 
of a new processing plant to buy equipment, to buy inventory, and 
to provide working capitals for them to organize and operate their 
business activities. Mr. Watkins says farmer-owned milling or processing 
cooperatives are especially important to the rural economy because 
they let small farmers take the middle man role, adding market value 
to their farm commodities and pocketing the extra income. And that's 
agriculture briefs. I'm Rob Sivak.
