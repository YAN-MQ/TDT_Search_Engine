With one last burst of spending and one final intervention by the 
White House, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer ended one 
of the most competitive and expensive political races in the nation 
this year, with D'Amato pleading with New Yorkers to re-elect him 
because ``Al D'Amato delivers,'' and Schumer proclaiming himself ``on 
the verge of an historic victory.'' From Buffalo to Brooklyn to Mineola, 
D'Amato and Schumer _ both looking a little fatigued and sounding 
a bit hoarse _ campaigned on the kind of appeals that they hoped would 
close the political sale with any wavering voters. And they were joined 
by the kind of political celebrities who they hoped would motivate 
supporters to actually vote Tuesday, as they urged at stop after stop. 
For Schumer, it was Hillary Rodham Clinton, flying to New York for 
a fourth time during this campaign in a last-minute visit that left 
no doubt that the White House considered unseating the incumbent Republican 
senator among its highest political goals of 1998. Schumer was among 
a small handful of candidates who got this much White House attention 
during the general election season, with two visits by President Clinton, 
two by Vice President Al Gore and four by Mrs. Clinton. D'Amato countered 
with a stable of celebrities, including two of New York's more popular 
personalities _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and one of his predecessors, 
Ed Koch _ and a person who was a star from his first campaign in 1980: 
his mother. ``He will win,'' Antoinette D'Amato predicted Monday at 
the Polish Community Center in Yonkers, peering over the top of a 
lectern. ``Why? Because he is a good senator, he helps everyone in 
this state!'' Across the state, at street corners and union meeting 
halls and in television studios, the three-term Republican senator 
and his Democratic challenger were met with a crush of television 
cameras, so intense that in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, for example, 
it made it impossible for Giuliani, Koch or D'Amato to do much meeting 
and greeting of voters. The amount of attention paid to the tempestuous 
Senate race on its final day almost obscured the fact that there are, 
in fact, other elections taking place in New York Tuesday. Among them 
are contests for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and 
comptroller. In the views of most politicians and late campaign polls, 
Gov. George Pataki is well positioned as he seeks a second term against 
Democratic challenger Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council 
Speaker, and others. D'Amato, after waging a campaign that attacked 
Schumer for being too liberal, too parochial and for missing votes, 
returned to what has been the bedrock theme of his 18 years as New 
York's junior senator. In a series of brief speeches, the senator 
asked voters to re-elect him because he has tirelessly advocated the 
state's interests in Washington. ``Al D'Amato delivers,'' the senator 
said. ``I do it every day. And I never stop fighting for New Yorkers. 
And if they want to have somebody in the majority who is going to 
fight for them, make a difference for them, it's Al D'Amato.'' As 
D'Amato spoke to an audience of 300 at his campaign-ending event _ 
a rally on the steps of the Nassau County Courthouse in Mineola _ 
the sound system went dead. There were moans and disappointed shouts 
from the crowd. D'Amato tried to speak without amplification, but 
at the end of the campaign, his voice could not be heard from 10 feet 
away. The audience, including more than a few friends who have known 
him through three decades in New York politics, began shouting words 
of encouragement _ ``We love you, Al!'' Then Pataki spoke, with the 
help of a rigged portable loudspeaker, and included words of praise 
for his political patron: ``Let me make one critical point: None of 
this would have happened if we didn't have in Washington the greatest 
United States Senator ...'' Then the sound system gave out again. 
D'Amato campaigned in New York City and the suburbs. He did not, unexpectedly, 
campaign upstate, the part of New York where he has been most popular 
and which would be most likely to carry him to a fourth term. Schumer 
campaigned from one end of the state and back again _ and then back 
again, impulsively deciding last night to fly back to western New 
York for one more rally. He turned up at the American Legion Hall 
in West Seneca, N.Y., for a final campaign rally in a part of a state 
where the Brooklyn lawmaker has always been considered weak by analysts 
assessing his prospects for unseating D'Amato. ``This is our last 
stop of this entire campaign,'' Schumer told asbestos workers and 
other union members at the hall just outside of Buffalo. ``And I wanted 
to be in Western New York to show the people of Western New York how 
much I care. ``We're now in first place, and the momentum is on our 
side,'' he declared. Polls actually show the race to be a virtual 
dead heat. The outcome could be decided by the fewer than 75,000 absentee 
ballots that were returned to state election officials by midafternoon 
Monday. And those officials are taking unusual steps _ including having 
the unopened ballots impounded by the police _ to insure that this 
year's paper votes are counted fairly. Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for 
the State Board of Elections, said he was unaware of a statewide contest 
whose outcome was reversed once the paper ballots were counted. Absentee 
ballots usually account for only 3 percent of the total vote, he said. 
But Daghlian added that this Senate race was as good a candidate as 
any for such a turnabout. ``Everybody's calling for a very close election, 
so it could make a big difference,'' he said. ``If your margin on 
the voting machines is about the same or less than the number of absentee 
ballots that are out, it's going to be very meaningful.''
