Got a lot of music news this week. Grabbing the headlines is the trio 
known as Hanson, which is going high tech. VOA's Katherine Cole with 
details on all that. OK, Hanson fans. Get a pen and paper so you can 
write down a very important Internet address. Good news for Hanson 
fans. If you have had a hard time waiting for the brothers' new live 
CD and video, there is some relief. The band has got a new promotional 
site on the Web, and the easiest way to get there is by visiting the 
Yahoo site at www.yahoo.com and then following the directions. Once 
you reach the Hanson site, you can listen to an audio track or watch 
a video clip from the upcoming live sets. This new Hanson CD and the 
video hit stores on Tuesday and the group will also be taking part 
in an online interview. That starts at one hour UTC Tuesday. Check 
out that Yahoo site for all the details.
