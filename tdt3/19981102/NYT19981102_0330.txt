In a strategic shift, Medtronic Inc., the biggest maker of heartbeat 
regulators, said Monday that it had agreed to buy the Sofamor Danek 
Group for $3.6 billion in Medtronic stock. Medtronic said the deal 
would double its stake in devices for brain and spine surgery at a 
time when sales growth has slowed in its core business in pacemakers 
and other devices that fine-tune heart performance. Revenue of Sofamor 
Danek, which is based in Memphis, has been growing four times as fast 
as sales of Medtronic, an older, much bigger company that is based 
in Minneapolis. Medtronic had already begun altering its thrust by 
hiring more sales people to visit orthopedic spine surgeons and neurosurgeons. 
The surgeons are Sofamor Danek's main customers. Sofamor Danek has 
about 40 percent of a $1-billion-a-year surgical device market, which 
is growing 22 percent to 25 percent a year, said E. Ronald Pickard, 
chairman and chief executive of Sofamor. By contrast, sales of cardiovascular 
devices are growing in ``the high single digits,'' said William W. 
George, chairman and chief executive of Medtronic. Johnson &AMP; Johnson 
will have about 20 percent of the spinal implant market when it completes 
its recently announced acquisition of DePuy Inc., said Rick Wise, 
an analyst at Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. Sofamor projects sales of $400 
million this year, mainly in hardware like rods and screws, which 
hold together damaged vertebrae, and an imaging device for brain surgery. 
About 15 percent, or $400 million, of Medtronic's $2.6 billion sales 
are in related businesses, including pain management devices and electronic 
stimulators to treat tremors. ``Sofamor Danek has a tremendous position 
in a field that will complement what we were doing,'' George said. 
``They have lots of the same customers who we've worked with for years.'' 
Several analysts hailed the deal, which valued Sofamor Danek at $115 
a share, or 13 percent above its closing price on Friday on the New 
York Stock Exchange. On Monday, Sofamor Danek shares rose $8.50, to 
$110.125. Medtronic shares rose $1.5625 cents, to $66.5625, on the 
Big Board. Under the deal, the price per share for Sofamor will be 
adjusted if Medtronic shares trade below $56.97 or above $69.63 in 
the 15 days before Sofamor Danek shareholders meet to vote on the 
acquisition. Kurt Kruger, an analyst in San Francisco at Nationsbanc 
Montgomery Securities, said Sofamor Danek could add $40 million in 
sales next year if it receives federal regulatory approval for a new 
spinal implant device to relieve back pain. Analysts are predicting 
approval early in 1999 for the device, which is called a spinal cage. 
Last year, an advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration 
sent Sofamor back to the drawing board to improve the cage, which 
Kruger described as an ultra-strong metal column an inch long and 
the diameter of a cigar. Similar devices are already being sold by 
the Spinetech unit that was recently acquired by Sulzer Medica, a 
unit of Sulzer Ltd. of Switzerland, and the AcroMed unit that Johnson 
&AMP; Johnson is buying as part of DePuy Inc. As part of a reshuffling 
trend in heart devices, the Guidant Corp. recently agreed to buy a 
heart rhythm device business from Sulzer Medica. ``Medtronic and Sofamor 
Danek are an excellent fit,'' Wise of Bear Stearns said. ``No other 
competitor has the unique portfolio of electronic stimulation, surgical 
and spinal devices that the combined companies will have.'' Franz 
Tudor, an analyst at Oracle Partners, a health care investment group, 
said the deal made sense. But he said the opportunities for cost savings 
were limited because of little overlap between the two companies in 
manufacturing, sales and administration and research. A state court 
in Houston recently awarded $400,000 to plaintiffs who claimed injuries 
from a screw made by Sofamor. Pickard said the device was used in 
a way not recommended on the FDA-approved label. He said Sofamor had 
disposed of more than 1,100 such lawsuits, winning 50 summary judgments 
and paying less than $2,000 each in some 40 cases. The company intends 
to defend 2,000 remaining cases vigorously, he said.
