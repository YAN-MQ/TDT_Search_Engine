The Bill Gates on the courtroom screen was evasive and uninformed, 
pedantic and taciturn _ a world apart from his reputation as a brilliant 
business strategist, guiding every step in the Microsoft Corporation's 
rise to dominance in computing. In two hours of videotaped questioning 
shown at the Microsoft antitrust trial here Monday, a small part of 
the three-day deposition he gave last summer, Gates professed ignorance 
of several key charges in the government's case including allegations 
that he was involved in plans to bully competitors like Apple Computer 
Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp. to step back from Internet 
software markets that Microsoft sought to dominate. When presented 
with e-mail messages he had written, he often said he did not recognize 
the messages or recall the discussions surrounding them. To question 
after question he answered, ``I don't remember using those words,'' 
or ``I'm not sure what you're trying to say.''. In some cases Gates' 
answers were so banal that even Thomas Penfield Jackson, the U.S. 
District Court judge who is hearing the the case, chuckled and shook 
his head. Asked once, ``who was at the executive staff meeting'' where 
a key discussion took place, Gates said simply: ``Probably members 
of the executive staff.'' Microsoft replies that the few hours of 
taped excerpts, drawn from 20 hours of questioning by government lawyers, 
were often taken out of context, selected merely to embarrass Gates 
and Microsoft with little direct bearing on the case. Gates, Microsoft 
says, was obviously not going to cooperate with prosecutors trying 
to put words in his mouth. For the most part, both Gates, the nation's 
wealthiest man, and his questioner, David Boies, the Justice Department's 
trial lawyer, remained civil and polite. Boies, however, did show 
a flash or two of irritation at Gates' plodding evasions _ so at odds 
with his public image as a quick-witted tactician, immersed in every 
significant detail of Microsoft's business. At times, Boies pointedly 
reminded Gates that he was under oath. The pile of e-mail offered 
as evidence Monday vividly showed the round-the-clock pace at Microsoft, 
a pace set by Gates. E-mail messages sent to him at 4 A.M. were answered 
a few hours later. Still, through two hours of verbal thrusts and 
parries, Boies never quite succeeded in trapping Gates, and Gates 
was generally unable to discredit Boies' assertions. Gates, dressed 
in a hunter green suit with a brown striped tie, sitting at a plain 
conference table at Microsoft's headquarters next to his attorney, 
seldom smiled but never raised his voice. Long pauses _ some more 
than 20 second long _ hung between many of Boies' questions and Gates' 
answers. Microsoft's chairman seldom looked his questioner in the 
eye, gazing down at the table instead. As he read documents that were 
handed to him, sometimes, he rocked back and forth in his chair. For 
the last week, the government has been trying to play the Gates deposition 
in court, but Microsoft's drawn-out cross examination of government 
witnesses by Microsoft's trial lawyer, Jack Warden, had left no time. 
The announcement that it would be played Monday came as a surprise. 
During the deposition, taped over three days in August, Gates was 
confronted again and again by e-mail _ his own, and messages sent 
to him by other Microsoft executives. The government's case, in its 
broadest terms, is that Microsoft has used its market muscle to fashion 
a network of relationships that would insure that the rise of the 
Internet did not weaken its dominance. It began with trying, in a 
meeting that took place on June 21, 1995, to divide up with its main 
rival, the Netscape Communications Corp., the market for software 
used to browse the World Wide Web.. In his deposition, Gates said 
that during the period around June 1995 he had ``no sense of what 
Netscape was doing.'' Microsoft documents often seem to contradict 
Gates' profession of ignorance. In an internal document titled ``The 
Internet Tidal Wave,'' written on May 26, 1995, by Gates himself, 
he gives an authoritative analysis of Netscape's strategy. He called 
Netscape a ``new competitor `born' on the Internet,'' whose goal was 
to ``commoditize'' the value of the personal computer operating system. 
Microsoft's wealth and market power derives mainly from the dominance 
of its Windows operating system, the master control software that 
runs on more than 90 percent of personal computers. In the deposition, 
Stephen Houck, the lead lawyer for the 20 states suing Microsoft along 
with the Justice Department, asked Gates about e-mail he had received 
that appeared to show that Microsoft was proposing to divide the market 
for browsers. An electronic message to Gates, written by Thomas Reardon, 
a Microsoft executive, lists the goals of trying to strike a deal 
with Netscape. They include ``move Netscape out of the Win32 Internet 
client area'' _ a reference, in industry jargon, for desktop Internet 
software that runs on the Windows operating systems using so-called 
32-bit technology, Windows 95 and Windows NT. The next objective, 
stated in the e-mail, was to ``avoid cold or hot war with Netscape. 
Keep them from sabotaging our platform evolution.'' Gates said he 
did not recall this message. The government alleges that when Netscape 
refused Microsoft's illegal offer on June 21, 1995, Microsoft set 
out to crush its competitor and slow the rise of other Internet technology, 
like Apple Computer's Quicktime multimedia software, and Sun Microsystems's 
Java, an Internet programming language. All of these posed a potential 
threat, the government argues, to Microsoft's firm grip on computing. 
Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer, asked Gates whether 
he tried to ``get Apple to agree to help you to undermine Sun?'' He 
showed Gates an e-mail on Aug. 8, 1997, sent to Paul Maritz, a senior 
executive at Microsoft, and others. In dealing with Apple, Gates wants 
to get ``as much mileage as possible'' in competing against other 
Internet software companies. ``In other words,'' he writes, ``a real 
advantage against Sun and Netscape.'' He concludes the e-mail by asking 
his aides, ``Do we have a clear plan on what we want Apple to do to 
undermine Sun?'' Boies then asked Gates what he meant when he asked 
that question. Pausing and staring down at his own brief message, 
Gates eventually replied, ``I don't know.'' The government is alleging 
that Microsoft has repeatedly used its market power for anticompetitive 
ends, prodding partners and competitors to divide, or stay out of, 
markets that Microsoft wants to dominate. When asked about these allegations 
in general, Gates gave his most unequivocal reply. ``Are you aware,'' 
Boies asked, ``of any instances in which representatives of Microsoft 
have met with competitors in an attempt to allocate markets?'' Gates 
replied, ``I'm not aware of any such thing. And I know it's very much 
against the way we operate.'' Boies probed further to ask, ``It would 
be against company policy to do that.'' And Gates answered, ``That's 
right.''
