Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat has agreed to Israel's request to 
postpone the start of their new peace agreement for a few days. Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says implementation cannot start 
until Israel's Cabinet and parliament ratify the accord. The agreement 
comes into effect only after Knesset approval of which will be sometime 
next week. I'm sure the Knesset will approve it, assuming it passes 
the government. There conceivably could be a delay, but I think we 
can limit it to a technical delay of a few days. The U.S. brokered 
accord was to go into effect today.
