Knitwear is an indispensable component of a fall-winter wardrobe, 
especially this season when sportswear rules. A sweater and skirt 
or pants make a basic outfit, but there's no need to settle for a 
basic pullover when you can make a more striking statement with a 
knit top. Cable-stitched sweaters include a tunic by Clan Douglas 
($395 at Nordstrom) and a hooded cardigan by Sonja Nuttal ($440 at 
Barneys New York). Barneys also has cardigans: a popcorn stitch by 
We Wool ($595); a notch collar by Irie ($425), and a zip front with 
a small collar by Future Ozbek ($420). Nordstrom also has Missoni's 
distinctive-patterned knits in a long slim jacket ($895); a sleeveless 
dress ($760), and a pullover ($440) with a large coordinating stole 
($660). Besides sweaters, Saks Fifth Avenue has knitted accessories, 
including cashmere gloves ($40); berets by Patricia Underwood ($125), 
and flame-stitch handbags by Missoni ($620).
