One of the world's biggest electronics companies, Phillips, is closing 
about a third of its plants worldwide. Analysts say factories in Europe 
and America are the ones likely to be hit the hardest. A spokesman 
for the Dutch based firm said it's part of a major restructuring to 
reduce overcapacity. 42 factories will close by the end of the year. 
Around 60 more will close during the next two years.
