One of the most expensive races for the House of Representatives in 
Tuesday's U.S. elections is a rematch with California Republican Bob 
Dornan trying to win back the seat he lost two years ago. Mr. Dornan 
is again facing his opponent from 1996, Democrat Representative Loretta 
Sanchez of California's 46th congressional district. The two candidates 
have spent more than $5 million in the campaign.
