now to iraq and saddam's latest slap in the face to the u.s. and its 
allies. tonight, president clinton promised that saddam hussein's 
complete lockout of u.n. weapons inspectors will backfire. but the 
international community has threatened saddam before and had little 
impact. will this time be any different? here's nbc's andrea mitchell. 
120 u.n. inspectors sidelined in what the u.n. calls saddam hussein's 
most serious threat since the gulf war. a complete halt to all u.n. 
inspections, even routine monitoring. until the inspectors are back 
on the job, no options off the table. but a former u.n. inspector 
of with firsthand knowledge calls that an empty threat. it also means 
that there is the capitulation option on the table, too. and i'm sure 
that's getting more look than any military option that's being weighed 
at the moment. people do not want to confront saddam hussein. and 
at a white house crisis meeting today, the president did not authorize 
military action. instead, he is sending william cohen tonight an a 
trip to consult u.s. alies in europe and saddam's neighbors in the 
gulf. but saddam has gone to the brink before -- in fact, five times 
in the last year alone. and this is hardly the first time the u.s. 
has threatened military action. this weapons of mass destruction, 
we've got to stop it. if diplomacy fails we must be, and we are, prepared 
to act. this time saddam has made everyone angry, even his russian 
friends, although not angry enough to back military action. there 
are differences of view in the security council on going about it, 
but no difference in the need for iraq to comply. what would saddam 
have to do to warrant the u.s. acting alone? nothing short of rebuilding 
his weapons of mass destruction, something that could be likely now 
that the inspectors are out of business. andrea mitchell, nbc news, 
new york.
