The United States is urging Arab countries to become more engaged 
in the Middle-East peace process following the latest Israeli and 
Palestinian peace deal. A state department spokesman says Washington 
wants Arab states to rejoin multilateral regional talks. Do more to 
normalize relations with Israel and help Palestinians build their 
economy. Arab countries put on hold diplomatic and economic ties with 
Israel in 1996, after it elected a right-wing government opposed to 
territorial concessions to the Palestinians.
