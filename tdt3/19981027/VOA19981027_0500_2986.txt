Japanese companies last month slashed 700,000 jobs, but that was canceled 
out by the number of people who gave up looking for work. Analyst 
Matthew Pogi of Lehman Brothers Japan says record-high joblessness 
is contributing to Japan's deepening recession. The unemployment rate 
is rising and the loosening of Lao market, of course, and some other 
indicators, basically makes it very difficult for the government to 
get these companies started again. As the vicious cycle of falling 
profits and production is working its way into the Lao markets, and 
the unemployment is falling and wages are falling, so like I said, 
that will make it very difficult for the government to reengineer 
growth in the economy. The jobless rate has risen or remained unchanged 
14 of the last 15 months, as business dries up in Japan and across 
Asia.
