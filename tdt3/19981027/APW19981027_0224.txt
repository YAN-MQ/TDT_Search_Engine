The Indian foreign office is clashing with one of its own committees 
_ a group that oversees arrangements for the thousands of Indian Muslims 
who make the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, a newspaper reported Tuesday. 
The Indian Express said the Ministry of External Affairs sent a memo 
to the prime minister questioning the financial practices of members 
of the Bombay-based Hajj Committee. The committee organizes transportation 
and accommodation at subsidized prices for Indians making the hajj, 
the annual pilgrimage to the Saudi holy city that is required at least 
once of every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it. The Express said 
it had obtained a copy of the ministry's complaints, which included 
accusations that committee members were using their status to fly 
relatives free to Saudi Arabia and not accounting for their own expenses 
for which they were charging the government. The Express quoted the 
documents as saying the ministry had no evidence on which to base 
a formal complaint. A ministry spokesman contacted by The Associated 
Press could not confirm that any memo had been sent. Hajj Committee 
Executive Officer Shabi Ahmad told The Associated Press that the charges 
were baseless. He said the committee's 19 members had received permission 
from the Ministry of External Affairs for all their travel. Ahmad 
said the real problem was that external affairs wanted a new committee 
named, but that that process had been stalled in the bureaucracy. 
The ministry spokesman said the committee needed fresh faces, noting 
the current committee members had already served two years longer 
that the normal three-year tenure. Service extensions are not unusual. 
More than 2 million Muslims perform the hajj every year, half of them 
from abroad and half from Saudi Arabia. Some 100,000 come from predominately 
Hindu India, where Muslims make up the largest minority and one of 
the largest communities of Muslims in the world at about 12 percent 
of the population of 980 million.
