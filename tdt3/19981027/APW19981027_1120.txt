BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO decided Tuesday to keep up the threat 
of air strikes against Serb forces for an unspecified period, despite 
recognizing a substantial withdrawal of troops and police from Kosovo. 
A meeting of ambassadors from the 16-allied nations agreed to indefinitely 
extend the ``activation order,'' which is keeping more than 400 allied 
warplanes on alert for possible raids against the Serbs. ``We have 
requested our military authorities to remain prepared to carry out 
these air operations ... and to maintain forces at appropriate readiness 
levels,'' said NATO Secretary General Javier Solana. But the alliance 
did not set a new deadline for the airstrikes after the previous deadline 
of 1900 GMT expired. Solana said the decision would maintain pressure 
on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic at a time when his troops 
were moving to comply with the alliance's demand that reinforcements 
sent to Kosovo during the eight-month crisis be withdrawn. ``We know 
that President Milosevic only moves when he is presented with the 
credible threat of force,'' Solana said at a news conference after 
the 2 1/2 meeting. Hundreds of people have died and nearly 300,000 
have been driven from their homes in fighting since Milosevic sent 
in troops to battle ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. Ethnic 
Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and most want 
independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic 
in Yugoslavia. The NATO alliance had threatened to launch airstrikes 
unless Milosevic halted his crackdown and cut his forces to levels 
in place before the conflict began. Solana said reports from observers 
on the ground and reconnaissance flights by unarmed NATO planes showed 
most Yugoslav army and special police units had withdrawn from Kosovo 
or returned to barracks. ``The security forces are returning to the 
level they were at before the present crisis began,'' he said. Solana 
said NATO ambassadors would keep the situation under constant review. 
``If we see evidence of substantial noncompliance in the future ... 
we will be ready to use force,'' he said. Convoys of tanks and trucks 
carrying Yugoslav troops and police pulled out of several parts of 
Kosovo Tuesday, indicating Milosevic had ordered compliance with demands 
he reduce Serb forces in Kosovo to levels before the conflict with 
ethnic Albanian separatists flared February. Solana said 4,000 members 
of the special police had left Kosovo in the past 24 hours. He said 
police and military units normally based in Kosovo were moving back 
to garrisons, check points have been dismantled. In Washington, presidential 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Milosevic had withdrawn ``well over 90 
percent of the security force reinforcements.'' ``Thanks to NATO pressure 
and determination, very substantial steps have been taken toward compliance,'' 
Lockhart added.
