It's been a historic day in Germany with the changing of the political 
guard. Gerhardt Shroeder was sworn in as the country's seventh post-war 
Chancellor. And we'll be hearing more about Schroeder and his new 
foreign minister in just a few minutes. But first, the good byes, 
not only to the era of Helmut Kohl, who has run the country for the 
last 16 years, but also to inspector Steffan Derrick. After 24 years, 
Germany's longest running television detective series has come to 
a close. Inspector Derrick, placed by 75 year-old Hoarse Tappert was 
know for his low key style, elegant suits, and thinking man's approach 
to crime solving. German media critic Joachim Huber says that while 
Derrick didn't have the trademark prop of a Kojak or a Columbo, he 
did have other memorable attributes. He had no lolly, he had no cigar, 
he had a BMW, and he was maybe the best phone caller in the whole 
of Germany. In fact, Huber says, part of Inspector Derrick's popularity, 
not just with German audiences, but with viewers in almost 100 other 
countries world-wide, was the program's familiarity. You have just 
two or three scenes, Derrick in his, Derrick in his automobile, and 
Derrick in the murderer's apartment. And if Mr. Derrick took up the 
phone, then you knew the murderer confessed. Inspector Derrick is 
said to have used his gun only 15 times during his 24 years as a crime 
fighter. What appealed most to his many fans, says Joachim Huber was 
the inspector's maturity. In a world, where more and more people are 
indifferent to murder, terrorism and rape, Derrick is there to preach 
his message. Maybe he was the man who everybody expected, to be his 
father. Good bye to Inspector Derrick, whose Friday night slot will 
be replaced by a younger inspector, named Siska, who just happens 
to be about the same age as Germany's new Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder.
