In a sudden strategy reversal during the last week of the campaign 
season, the Republican Party on Tuesday night opened a $10 million 
nationwide advertising blitz that capitalizes on President Clinton's 
sex scandal. For weeks, party officials had stayed clear of Clinton's 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky in their advertisements, expressing 
concern that it would prompt a backlash from voters who have grown 
weary of the scandal and the looming impeachment hearings against 
the president. But after debating strategy throughout the weekend, 
officials at the National Republican Congressional Committee decided 
that recent surveys showed enough evidence that the scandal weighed 
heavily on the minds of voters they were trying to reach. The advertisements, 
they believe, might prod those voters to go to the polls. So as part 
of their final get-out-the-vote push, the committee bought the advertisements, 
settling on three 30-second commercials that will be broadcast in 
up to 70 media markets in the closing week of the campaign. The Republicans' 
decision could again move the Lewinsky matter to the forefront of 
the national political discourse before Election Day. The commercials 
try to link the scandal to specific issues. In one advertisement, 
the narrator does not mention the scandal at all. It closes with footage, 
but no sound, of Clinton, in slow motion, wagging his finger at the 
camera as he did when he misled the country in January by publicly 
declaring that he had not had ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky. 
That advertisement opens with tape of Clinton changing his mind on 
how many years it will take to balance the budget. Then the announcer 
says, ``It took the Republicans just four years to get the job done. 
And get the budget balanced. Now there's a budget surplus. And a Republican 
plan to save Social Security. And a Republican plan to eliminate the 
marriage penalty tax. America needs the balance.'' Then, as Clinton 
appears on the screen wagging his finger, the narrator says, ``Remember, 
it's your choice. For balance. Vote Republican.'' The image of the 
president freezes on the screen. In another commercial the tone is 
set with ominous background music. Against grainy black-and-white 
shots of people at the polls, the announcer asks: ``Should we reward 
Democratic plans for more big government? More big spending? Should 
we reward their opposition to more welfare reform? ``And should we 
reward not telling the truth? ``That is the question of this election. 
Reward Bill Clinton. Or, vote Republican.'' The third commercial features 
a conversation between two women in their 30s. ``What did you tell 
your kids?'' one asks. ``I didn't know what to say,'' the other says. 
``It's wrong. For seven months he lied to us,'' the first one says. 
``But aren't there other things to do?'' ``And say it's OK to lie?'' 
``Besides, the Republicans are doing them. They cut taxes. They helped 
balance the budget. And they're putting people on welfare back to 
work. And now they have a plan to save Social Security.'' Party officials 
said they considered dozens of possibilities for scripts, including 
even blunter messages. One that was shelved featured Steve Grossman, 
the national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who had 
praised Clinton for his moral leadership. But officials said they 
figured that the slightly more subtle approach would be most effective 
_ and least likely to put off voters. ``The challenge in this environment 
is to acknowledge its existence and to pivot to issues that we want 
to focus on,'' Mary Crawford, communications director of the Republican 
Congressional Campaign Committee, said of the scandal. ``If you ignore 
it completely, then your message can seem phony because it is so much 
on the top of the public's thoughts about politics.'' Dan Sallick, 
Ms. Crawford's counterpart at the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee, said of the barrage of new ads: ``This just proves what 
we suspected all along, which is that this Republican Congress is 
obsessed by scandal and investigating the president. They are now 
sending a signal that they are abandoning the political center and 
focusing entirely on appeasing their right wing base.'' In contrast 
to the $10 million from the Republicans, Sallick said his committee 
will spend $3 million on commercials in the final days of the campaigns. 
The Democratic ads do not refer to the scandal in any way. One Republican 
strategist who was involved in the discussions about the advertisements 
said they were being placed in districts where they would have the 
most resonance. The spot about rewards, for instance, is appearing 
only in three southern districts where polling by the party found 
that Clinton is particularly unpopular with swing voters. This strategist 
also said that the ads were tailored to respond to polling that found 
that voters were not upset about Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky 
but about the fact that he misled the public about it. The three districts 
where that commercial, about the president ``not telling the truth,'' 
is running are in those of three vulnerable Democrats, Reps. John 
Spratt Jr., of South Carolina, Sanford Bishop of Georgia and Bob Etheridge 
of North Carolina. The two other advertisements are being broadcast 
in several of the largest media markets in the country. In addition 
to those three spots, the committee is broadcasting 29 commercials 
that will run in districts throughout the country. Those will deal 
specifically with issues and are tailor-made to help House candidates 
in individual races.
