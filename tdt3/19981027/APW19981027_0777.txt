Two German labor unions voted Tuesday in favor of pursuing a merger 
with three others in the service industry that would create one of 
the biggest unions in the world. A majority of delegates at a meeting 
of Germany's print union, IG-Medien, voted in the Bavarian city of 
Wuerzburg in favor of talks to set up the merger. In the northern 
city of Bremen, a union representing the banking and insurance sectors 
also voted for talks. Three other unions must still vote on the interim 
step before talks can begin. A final vote on creating the super-union 
is expected in November 1999. Heated debate among delegates at the 
IG Medien meeting centered around whether a bigger union will succeed 
in strengthening Germany's labor movement. Supporters hope the merger 
will help maintain labor's leverage in an era of industry consolidation. 
Others questioned whether bigger was better, and suggested the merger 
may make them more unwieldy. Leaders of five of Germany's service 
industry unions _ DAG, OeTV, IG Medien, HBV, and DPG _ agreed in principle 
in February on plans to merge by around 2000. The combined group would 
represent nearly 4 million employees, including clerical, transportation, 
education, media and postal workers.
