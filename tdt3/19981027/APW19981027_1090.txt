The Senate gave its approval Tuesday to the new government of Massimo 
D'Alema, giving Parliament's final clearance to Italy's first administration 
to be led by former Communists. D'Alema's coalition won Tuesday's 
Senate vote of confidence by 188-116 with one abstention. The margin 
was about as comfortable as last week's vote in the Chamber of Deputies, 
where it was 333-281 with three abstentions. ``Now, we must get to 
work,'' said D'Alema, who went to Parliament to watch Tuesday's vote. 
D'Alema's coalition includes ex-Christian Democrats from the previous, 
center-left coalition of Romano Prodi but the main force comes from 
former communists like himself. There also are the first communist 
Cabinet ministers since 1947. As Italy's new premier, D'Alema has 
pledged to stick to the stringent economic policies of his predecessor. 
The penny-pinching contributed to the fall of Prodi's coalition but 
ensured that Italy qualifiied for next year's debut of Europe's single 
currency, the euro. Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old coalition lost a vote of 
confidence by a single ballot on Oct. 9 after a communist faction 
withdrew its support. D'Alema's becomes Italy's 56th government since 
World War II.
