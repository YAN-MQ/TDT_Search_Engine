The second-biggest mutual fund group is playing the name game. Vanguard 
is changing the names of all but seven of its 109 mutual funds to 
eliminate confusion to investors. After years of customer complaints, 
vanguard will shorten fund names, get rid of slashes and the word 
"portfolios." The changes take effect today but will not affect fund 
numbers or ticker symbols.
