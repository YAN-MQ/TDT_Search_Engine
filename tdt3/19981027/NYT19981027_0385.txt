Matthew Bourne's production of ``Swan Lake'' opened on Broadway as 
something of an anomaly. Word from Los Angeles, where the production 
played last year, was that the show was touching but campy. Earlier 
reviews in England, where the show originated, tended to dwell on 
what this ``Swan Lake'' was not, particularly among the older dance 
critics. In one of the most famous (and in some circles infamous) 
English reviews, the peppery veteran critic Clement Crisp sounded 
relieved to report that the relationship between the prince and swan 
was not homosexual. ``The swans are oddly sexless,'' Crisp wrote in 
The Financial Times in September 1996, when the production opened 
at the Piccadilly Theater, ``and when (Adam) Cooper appears as the 
Black Swan at the ball _ a brutish incarnation of erotic force _ his 
activities are as blatantly heterosexual as they are destructive.'' 
The move from a small dance house to the London equivalent of Broadway 
effectively took this version of the ballet classic into the realm 
of larger issues. Was it theater or dance? Was it straight or gay? 
One of the pleasures of this ``Swan Lake'' is that it is open to so 
many interpretations. That richness, which has made the production 
a widely discussed entertainment event, comes in part from Bourne's 
failure to carry some of his themes through. Succumbing to the youthful, 
unthinking impudence that makes his production so much fun, Bourne, 
who was in his mid-30s when he created ``Swan Lake,''fails entirely 
to prepare the viewer for his ending, when the swans savagely peck 
their leader to death in a major departure from the ballet scenario. 
And the Private Secretary _ in the ballet the evil magician Rothbart 
_ is involved in so many plots to drive the already fragile young 
prince crazy that it is sometimes almost impossible to figure out 
what is going on in Bourne's version of the ballet's third act. On 
the other hand, Bourne is full of imaginative, yeasty ideas. His best-known 
innovation, aside from all those male swans, is his use of the ballet 
plot to spoof England's royal family. An easy target for parody these 
days, certainly, but Bourne handles the humor with a remarkable lack 
of heavy-handedness. And while his choreography for the swans is unimaginative, 
his social-dance set pieces are witty, knowing responses to the Tchaikovsky 
score and to the classical ballet idiom. That idiom is what gives 
the show its weight and surprising degree of formal grandeur. It is 
unfortunate, then, that this ``Swan Lake'' is being so energetically 
marketed as theater, particularly when the producers, perhaps hedging 
their bets and going for the largest possible audience, have left 
the ballet name intact. Wouldn't it have made more sense to rename 
the show ``The Broadway Swan Lake'' or even sever the umbilical cord 
and call it ``Cob Lake''? Instead, theater critics were recruited 
for the opening reviews in New York, though dance reviewers were welcomed. 
``More like a musical that happens to be danced,'' an early press 
release adroitly reassured reviewers. Radio advertisements quote theater 
writers and even pull in one improbable reference to Marlon Brando's 
Stanley Kowalski. Does it matter if ``Swan Lake'' is dance or theater? 
``Only at Tony time,'' one of the heavily courted Tony award voters 
said dryly. Broadway musicals do tend to sell better than straight 
theater or dance. ``This is not ballet,'' Cameron Mackintosh, a producer 
of the Bourne ``Swan Lake,'' commented on a recent edition of the 
WNET public television show ``City Arts.'' ``I (italics)hate(end italics) 
ballet. I would never go to see a ballet. It would send me off to 
sleep.'' Not having seen any ballet, apparently, Mackintosh may be 
forgiven for his ignorance of the fact that dance and classical story 
ballets, like ``Swan Lake'' in particular, are as much theater as 
his ``Cats'' or ``Phantom of the Opera.'' It is not coincidence that 
Bourne and most of the performers in ``Swan Lake'' have extensive 
training in dance. It is also not a coincidence that two major ballet 
companies have chosen to call themselves American Ballet Theater and 
Dance Theater of Harlem. True, there are no words in Bourne's ``Swan 
Lake,'' apart from ``Ole'' and ``the odd grunt,'' as the lead performer 
Adam Cooper engagingly puts it. But harried ballet directors work 
hard to raise money for the kind of spectacular sets and costumes 
that are de rigeur for productions of such classics as ``Swan Lake,'' 
``Giselle'' and ``The Sleeping Beauty,'' all examples of the kind 
of narrative dance that has helped to define classical ballet in the 
19th and 20th centuries. Do away with the dancing in ``Swan Lake,'' 
whose characterizations were always fraught with the kind of Freudian 
tangles that Bourne has seized upon, and what would you have? That 
script about an unhappy boy meeting an unhappy girl, falling in love 
and then losing his girl when her naughty look-alike seduces him. 
Bourne does not parody ballet itself, with the exception of a dreary 
anachronistic ballet-within-the-ballet in the first act. And he has 
left his ``Swan Lake'' open to more than one interpretation sexually, 
though he is said to have been taken aback when a writer suggested, 
at a Dance Critics Association conference this year in New York, that 
Bourne's doomed prince had been ``punished for being queer.'' Recalling 
similar reactions in Los Angeles, Bourne has talked publicly of his 
surprise that the prince would be assumed to be gay. That possibility 
is hard to ignore in the ballet ``Swan Lake,'' whose prince is bored 
by the princesses dancing for him on his birthday but lavishes loving 
attention on the crossbow his mother has given him. And it is clear 
that Bourne's ``Swan Lake'' has a powerful effect on many gay men. 
Male audience members stand with their arms casually about one another 
on the street during intermission, with an openness that is dangerous 
even in the city's predominantly gay neighborhoods. Men do not dance 
together with impunity on Broadway except in tango shows. And there 
is considerable flirtation and sexual sadism in Bourne's choreography. 
The men may be wearing feathers, but those bare backs and powerful 
wingspreads are anything but effete. One of the high points of the 
production occurs after the prince's first encounter with the swans, 
when he suddenly communicates, without a word spoken, the liberating 
realization that he may not be so different after all. It is a moment 
that cannot help to resonate with any class of people trained to isolation, 
particularly in Ben Wright's poignantly innocent interpretation of 
the role. And why shouldn't gay audiences be turned on by homoeroticism, 
as one gay audience member observed, particularly in a musical comedy 
with a score such as Broadway has never heard? He, after all, had 
spent a lifetime having to get his ``jollies'' from straight stories. 
The truth is, of course, that Bourne's ``Swan Lake'' arrives in perilous 
times for classical ballet and for gay men and women. Until recently, 
it has been possible to tune out the kind of public, government and 
church-sanctioned homophobia that fills the American media these days, 
in a time when homosexuals have begun to claim their place as mainstream 
citizens. The brutal symbolism of the killing of Matthew Shepard may 
make it difficult _ or even impossible _ to appropriate Bourne's icons 
with anything like the old, comfortably wistful identification. And 
ballet? `` `Swan Lake' is in bad shape on our stages,'' Crisp wrote 
in a commentary that rings true for ballet everywhere. ``I cannot 
think of one local ballerina able to perform Odette/Odile in the grand 
manner, nor do our productions make sense of the old ballet. Bourne's 
revision, to judge by its success, represents what the public wants 
of this masterpiece: jokes and shocks and a whiff of tragedy. The 
real tragedy is about ballet itself, and has to do with the fate of 
`Swan Lake' in our time.''
