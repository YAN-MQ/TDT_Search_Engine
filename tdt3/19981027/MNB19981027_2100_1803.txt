As you look at the vehicle assembly building in Florida tonight, about 
that breaking story overseas. Late reports from Sweden tonight that 
dozens of people are dead in a fire that broke out in a city on the 
country's west coast, the second largest city. With us on the telephone 
is an affiliate with the west news Swedish television channel, a journalist 
in Sweden. What can you tell us about this fire. We're hearing a death 
toll at 606? yes. It's noncontrolled fire that started around midnight 
on a second flar in a brick building. There is only one exit, so the 
people jumped out of the windows. As far as I know now, there are 
60 persons killed and approximately 100 injured. Now, the wire service 
is here, associated press is reporting that upwards of 400 were inside 
when the fire broke out. Is it possible that 60 is the best number 
we can hope for tonight as far as fayal its and that perhaps most 
of the people made it out before the fire spread too quickly? yes. 
I think so. The police are holding a press conference just now, so 
I haven't any more details. All right. Thank you very much. We'll 
have more on this story on NBC news starting tomorrow morning on "today."
