Good evening. Tonight, we are tracking one of the worst hurricanes 
on record. Hurricane Mitch is classified as extremely dangerous. As 
those winds swirl around, take a look at that well-defined eye. That 
is one indication for hurricane analysts of how much strength it actually 
has. For a while today, Mitch was what they call a category 5 -- there 
is no category 6. tonight it has weakened a bit, but it is making 
its way out through the Caribbean in the direction of the Mexican 
coast. ABC's Ron Claiborne reports from the popular resort of cancun. 
The first powerful gust hit cancun today. Just a few feet for more 
than 100 lexry hotels. People here are well aware that the center 
of the storm is already brushing honduras to the south with winds 
of more than 150 miles per hour and driving rain. There's been flooding 
and thousands have been forced to flee their homes. In cancun, thousands 
of tourists mostly Americans, crowded the airport. With the hurricane 
coming, it looks like it will come awfully close. I want to beat it. 
I want to outsmart it. Some local residents were also leaving trying 
to get as far inland as possible. why? Ten years ago the cancun area 
was devastated by hurricane Gilbert, this time authorities say, they're 
ready, but still there is some confusion. This woman live as cross 
the street from a school that's been designated as her Shelter, the 
problem is, the school's locked and no one knows who has the key. 
Ron Claiborne, ABC News, cancun.
