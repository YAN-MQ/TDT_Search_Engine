Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic sacked his secret service chief 
Tuesday following reports that the official opposed his hardline policies, 
including the Kosovo crackdown. Jovica Stanisic was replaced by police 
Gen. Radomir Markovic, according to a statement by the Serbian government, 
controlled by Milosevic. Stanisic had also been a security adviser 
to Milosevic. Independent B-92 radio said a session of Milosevic's 
ruling Socialist Party was underway and may result in more purges 
of reported pro-reformists within party ranks. Independent media have 
recently reported that Stanisic was against excessive use of force 
against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo. He reportedly also led a 
faction within the government which objected to Milosevic's cooperation 
with ultranationalists led by deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj. During 
Milosevic's decade-long rule, Stanisic was the key aide, crucial for 
keeping his grip on power intact. His replacement indicated that the 
hardliners were winning over the reformists within the government. 
Milosevic has used a threat of NATO attacks against military targets 
in Yugoslavia to crackdown on his opponents at home. Reported purges 
indicated he moved against the critics among his aides. Stanisic is 
also believed to have been a key figure in arming Bosnian Serbs and 
Croatian Serbs whose armed rebellions led to the breakup of the former 
Yugoslav federation. In 1995, Stanisic helped win the release of hundreds 
of United Nations peace keepers were taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs 
to stave off NATO attacks on their positions. Stanisic was reportedly 
in favor of recognizing an opposition victory at elections in Nov. 
1996. Annulling of the victory led to three months of street protests 
that shook Milosevic's rule. Stanisic reportedly also spoke against 
the recent media crackdown in Serbia.
