Cleveland has a team. It begins play next season and becomes the National 
Football League's 31st franchise. Three other groups _ one from Houston 
and two from Los Angeles _ made presentations to the NFL owners here 
Tuesday at their annual fall meeting explaining why each should be 
selected as the NFL's 32nd franchise. That team would begin play as 
early as in year 2001 and no later than the following year. ``The 
presentations were extremely well done,'' said Paul Tagliabue, the 
NFL commissioner. ``We've been working with these cities and expected 
that. We'll be working together through the first quarter of the year. 
It's realistic to expect we'll have an answer by then if we have a 
consensus.'' Robert C. McNair, leading the Houston bid, said that 
his group was the only one of the three that ``has the land, infrastructure, 
design, money and is ready to start.'' The L.A. Football Group, led 
by Michael S. Ovitz, said his group is ready ``to move swiftly from 
proposal to playing field.'' Edward Roski leads the L.A. New Coliseum 
group and said his group has ``a great project, a great story to tell 
and a great city.'' Robert Kraft, the New England Patriots owner, 
listened to all three proposals. ``All three made wonderful presentations 
but we will have a better idea of where things stand in a couple of 
days. I personally think it is important to have a franchise in Los 
Angeles. I don't want another generation of young people growing up 
without a team there. Houston, however, is ready to go and has the 
financing.'' Dan Rooney, the Pittsburgh Steelers owner, said: ``We 
have to expand to 32 teams to have an even number for scheduling and 
other factors and I'd rather see it happen sooner than later. Houston 
has all of its ducks in the water, as it said. But the L.A. groups 
have beautiful stadiums proposed.'' Also discussed Tuesday were league 
Internet and NFL Properties opportunities. The owners on Wednesday 
will discuss issues relating to Cleveland's request for relaxing tampering 
rules so that it can interview assistant coaches and other personnel 
besides head coaches currently employed by NFL teams. And 1999 league 
game scheduling changes due to Cleveland's addition will be discussed.
