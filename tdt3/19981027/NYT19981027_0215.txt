Arab-American actor Sayed Badreya has had no problem finding work 
in Hollywood. With his dark beard and his accented English, he has 
had his pick of parts as terrorists, hijackers, kidnappers and Islamic 
militants. ``Usually I play the bad guy role, a terrorist or someone,'' 
Badreya said by telephone from Egypt, where he is on a film shoot 
with Al Pacino, playing the head of the military wing of Hezbollah. 
``When I got to Hollywood, at first I couldn't get a lot of jobs,'' 
Badreya said. ``So I grew a beard and look like a really bad Arab, 
and I started to get a lot of work because that's what they want.'' 
After years of virtual invisibility, Arab-Americans are finally finding 
prominence in Hollywood movies _ as terrorists and villains. They 
are only the latest in a long line of ethnic groups and nationalities 
cast in sterotypical bad-guy roles, from American Indians to Germans 
to Japanese to African Americans to Russians. Each set of villains 
reflected the headlines and the anxieties of its era. Each passed 
into obsolescence as the headlines changed. Now, with Soviet pretensions 
shattered and aliens from outer space passe, the new cinematic enemy 
is the Muslim extremist. The latest film of this genre is ``The Siege,'' 
which opens Friday and stars Denzel Washington, Annette Bening and 
Bruce Willis. Trailers for ``The Siege'' reduced it to the typical 
terrorist scare-fare with exploding buses and shadowy images of men 
in mosques, but the full-length film is a cut above. ``The Siege'' 
posits the dangers to democracy and freedom when the United States. 
military, in pursuit of a terrorist cell operating in New York City, 
imposes martial law and herds the entire Arab-American population 
of Brooklyn into a detention camp. Despite this rather mixed portrayal 
of Arab-Americans as both victims and perpetrators, several anti-defamation 
organizations representing American Muslims and Arabs are undertaking 
a leaflet-distributing campaign outside theaters showing ``The Siege.'' 
They point out that there is no avoiding the fact that its villains 
are Arabs who quote the Koran and perform ablutions before heading 
off to blow up innocent civilians. The anti-defamation groups' leaflets 
emphasize that Islam is a peaceful, monotheistic religion and invite 
moviegoers to attend open houses at local mosques. The sensitivities 
of American Muslims and Arabs are so raw right now because ``The Siege'' 
follows a succession of more than a dozen films and made-for-television 
movies produced in the 1980s and '90s featuring murderous Muslim fanatics, 
among them ``Executive Decision,'' ``True Lies,'' ``Voyage of Terror'' 
and ``Terrorist on Trial.'' ``The problem is, you take the lunatic 
fringe and make the lunatic fringe represent the majority,'' said 
Jack Shaheen, a professor emeritus of broadcast journalism at Southern 
Illinois University. ``It would be like showing that every Catholic 
is an IRA member, or every Jew was a member of the Kach party.'' He 
was referring to extremist factions in Ireland and Israel. There are 
between 4 and 6 million Muslims living in the United States. Some 
are white or African American converts. Some are new immigrants. Many 
are first- and second-generation Americans striving for acceptance 
and success, much like the other ethnic groups who came before them. 
The voices of the small circle of Muslims and Arab-Americans who work 
in Hollywood are rarely heard in the discussion about movie stereotypes. 
They have never formed any group to represent their concerns. But 
among them, while there is less outrage than that expressed by the 
anti-defamation groups based in Washington, there is more frustration. 
The Muslim actors and writers, and the sole identifiable Muslim director-producer, 
have an insider's perspective on the reasons their religion is so 
often stereotyped in Hollywood, and whether anything can be done about 
it. They acknowledge that one reason Muslim terrorists have become 
frequent Hollywood fare is that terrorists who kill in the name of 
Islam are a genuine threat in international politics. ``We cannot 
say there are no Arab and no Muslim terrorists,'' said Moustapha Akkad, 
an Arab-American producer and director who was born in Syria and who 
has worked in Hollywood for 45 years. ``Of course there are. ``But 
at the same time, balance it with the image of the normal human being, 
the Arab-American, the family man,'' Akkad said. ``The lack of anyone 
showing the other side makes it stand out that in Hollywood, Muslims 
are only terrorists.'' Earlier in his career, Akkad produced and directed 
two films portraying Muslims as heroes. ``The Message'' (1977) told 
the story of the beginning of Islam, and ``Lion of the Desert'' (1981) 
starred Anthony Quinn as the real-life Bedouin leader Omar Mukhtar, 
who fought Mussolini's invading troops in the deserts of Libya. But 
Akkad said that raising money for such films was difficult, and that 
to achieve financial success and creative freedom, he had had to turn 
to another genre. He is now better known as the executive producer 
of all seven movies in the ``Halloween'' horror series, the most recent, 
``Halloween H2O,'' released in August. And like many Muslims interviewed 
for this story, including the actor Badreya, Akkad is at work on a 
screenplay that he hopes will help countradict the stereotypes about 
Muslims. Akkad's project is about the Crusades. Anyone acquainted 
with real Muslims and Arab-Americans living in this country knows 
that their lives are rich with potential plot lines: crises of faith, 
cross-cultural tensions, daughters and sons marrying outside the faith. 
These are some of the same dramatic themes often tapped in movies 
about Roman Catholics or Jews. But J.D. Hall, an actor and scriptwriter 
who is Muslim, said: ``I've never come across a script about Muslims 
where they weren't terrorists. Islam as a way of life, and the people 
that follow it _ I've seen documentaries but never a dramatic adaptation 
involving that. My suspicion, based on experience, is that if you 
came up with something like that, you'd have a devil of a time getting 
it made because it doesn't involve hate.'' Hall, an African American 
who has appeared in numerous black family sitcoms like ``Fresh Prince 
of Bel Air,'' says that while African Americans have had a modest 
measure of success as writers and directors in Hollywood, Muslims 
and Arab-Americans are far behind. ``We don't have any political power 
in this country,'' Hall said of Muslims in America. ``And we don't 
have the decision-making capacity in the motion picture industry, 
so we can't control our own image.'' Though they hesitate to raise 
the issue, Muslims and Arabs in Hollywood say that the preponderance 
of powerful Jews in the movie industry is probably a factor, but not 
the cause of, negative stereotypes of Muslims. ``I don't want to paint 
all Jews with one broad brush,'' said Hall, ``but there's a Zionist 
element that is definitely against Islam, and to the degree you sympathize 
with that element, if you have the power to portray Muslims, that 
portrayal is not going to be favorable.'' The more pervasive reason 
for stereotyping is that few Americans, in Hollywood and elsewhere, 
have firsthand knowledge of Islam, say American Muslim leaders. ``It 
is not intentional,'' said Aslam Abdullah, the Los Angeles-based editor 
of Minaret Magazine, who recently helped found a Muslim resource center 
for filmmakers. ``It is primarily ignorance. People do not know us. 
And we have not made any systematic effort to reach out to people.'' 
The most obvious evidence of ignorance is that many movies and television 
shows, and undoubtedly many Americans, make the mistake of equating 
Arabs with Muslims. In fact, only about 12 percent of the world's 
Muslims are Arabs. Far more Muslims live in Malaysia, Indonesia and 
India than in the Middle East. And most Americans wrongly assume that, 
conversely, all Arabs are Muslims. The truth is that many Arabs, particularly 
Palestinians, Lebanese and Egyptians, are Christians. Of the 3 million 
or so Arab-Americans now living in the United States, a large majority 
are Christians. The outlook for Arabs and Muslims in Hollywood is 
not all bleak. Even Badreya, so often cast as terrorist, played a 
heroic Arab pilot in 1996's ``Independence Day.'' And a handful of 
Arab-American and Muslim actors whose skin tone and accent allow them 
to ``pass'' have consistently avoided being typecast as terrorists. 
F. Murray Abraham, who received an Academy Award for his portrayal 
of Salieri in ``Amadeus,'' (1984) is among them. (Early in his career, 
Abraham dropped his first name ``Fahrid'' to avoid being typecast 
``as a sour Arab out to kill everyone,'' he once told an interviewer.) 
Abraham, an Orthodox Christian, is the son of a Syrian father and 
an Italian-American mother. Tony Shalhoub, an American of Lebanese 
heritage, has played a Russian, a Jew, several Italians (he was the 
hapless cab driver on NBC's ``Wings'' and the temperamental Italian 
chef in ``Big Night'') and many nondescript Caucasian Americans. When 
he first began acting, he was offered roles as a terrorist, he said 
in an interview. But ``once you start turning them down,'' he added, 
``they stop calling with those roles.'' One twist in the controversy 
over ``The Siege'' is that the film offered Shalhoub a sophisticated 
and nuanced role as an Arab-American. Shalhoub plays Frank Haddad, 
an FBI agent whose loyalty to the United States is tested when his 
son is among those rounded up for detention. Edward Zwick, the director 
of ``The Siege,'' pointed out that Haddad is ``the single rounded 
character in this movie. ``He's the only one with whom we even imagine 
a life, see him at home, with his family. He is not gratuitous or 
token at all.'' In interviews, both Zwick and Lawrence Wright, the 
film's principal screenwriter, defended the Arab-terrorist scenario 
of ``The Siege'' as legitimate and, judging from recent headlines, 
even prescient. ``Were there a story about Baruch Goldstein,'' Zwick 
said, referring to an Israeli militant who murdered 29 Muslims in 
Hebron in 1994, ``and an attack on the mosques, and about Jewish fundamentalism, 
I would tell that story too. I would not believe that that depiction 
is inflammatory by talking about marginal characters.'' Wright, a 
journalist who has traveled in the Middle East and worked in Cairo 
as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam war, said: ``If I had 
felt `The Siege' was anti-Arab, I would have taken my name off of 
it. The fact is, I'm proud to have my name on it.'' Of the criticism 
from Arab and Muslim anti-defamation groups, Wright said: ``I understand 
their anxiety and paranoia about the way Hollywood has depicted Muslims 
and Arabs. They're absolutely right. Arabs have been scapegoated. 
It's disgraceful. ``And yet that's just what this movie is about,'' 
he said. ``It's all about what happens when you blame a group for 
the violence of individuals.''
