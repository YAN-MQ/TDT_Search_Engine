UN officials say nearly 380,000 people have been displaced in Angola 
since January by increased fighting between government troops and 
Unita rebels. The officials say the biggest group, just over 50,000, 
has gathered in and around Malangai City, east of the capital Luanda. 
UN officials say this comes as the rebels appear to have taken key 
diamond-producing areas in the northeast of the country.
