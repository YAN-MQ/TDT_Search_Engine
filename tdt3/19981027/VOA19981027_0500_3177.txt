Japanese domestic auto production fell nearly 10 percent in September 
from the same month last year. It is the 12th consecutive monthly 
decline, due to falling domestic sales and slowing exports to the 
U.S. and Europe. Meanwhile, General Motors is the leader of the big 
three U.S. auto-makers in exports to Japan, sending over 30,000 vehicles 
to the Asian nation during the first eight months of the year.
