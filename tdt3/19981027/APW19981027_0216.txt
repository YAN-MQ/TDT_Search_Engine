Cathay Pacific is looking for ways to boost efficiency and productivity 
as costs related to the opening of Hong Kong's new airport eat into 
earnings, chief executive Philip Chen said Tuesday. Chen, speaking 
at a briefing for the relaunch of the airline's service between Hong 
Kong and Vietnam, said terminal, landing and parking charges are all 
substantially higher at Hong Kong International Airport, which opened 
in July. He provided no specifics but said the added charges ``will 
eat into the bottom line, especially given the slim margins right 
now.'' ``It's an accepted fact that yield pressure in the coming six 
months to one year will be no less than what we have experienced lately,'' 
he said. Cathay Pacific also has invested in a new headquarters, expected 
to be finished by the end of the year, and in catering facilities 
at the airport on outlying Lantau Island. Chen did not rule out more 
layoffs, noting ``you can never say `never,''' but said there ``is 
no plan to do anything like what we did in January.'' In January, 
Cathay Pacific laid off nearly 760 people. It subsequently made further 
staff cuts and urged belt-tightening by managers. Chen said the airline 
will look for other ways to increase productivity and efficiency. 
``We've been pushing electronic ticketing for the last few months 
and it will continue to be pushed,'' Chen said. He said the company 
will be ``looking closely'' at distribution costs but that it has 
no plans to cut commissions paid to travel agents. The airline also 
expects reduced costs and improved efficiency through participation 
in a new international alliance to start in February with American 
Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and Canadian Airlines, among others.
