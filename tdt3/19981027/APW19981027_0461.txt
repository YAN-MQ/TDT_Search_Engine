President Aleksander Kwasniewski told his Moldovan counterpart Tuesday 
that Poland will help seek a peaceful resolution to ethnic conflict 
in the secessionist Trans-Dniester region. Moldovan President Petru 
Lucinschi met with Kwasniewski at the start of a two-day visit in 
Warsaw. Poland, which holds the rotating chairmanship of the the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe this year, ``is ready to do 
everything'' to end the conflict peacefully, Kwasniewski said. He 
said foreign ministers from Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Poland plan 
to meet before the end of the year to discuss Trans-Dniester, a sliver 
of land in eastern Moldova with a population of 700,000 mainly ethnic 
Russians and Ukrainians. The region declared independence in 1990 
fearing that Moldova, dominated by ethnic Romanians, would seek to 
reunite with neighboring Romania. Moldova and the separatists fought 
a brief war in 1992. After the fighting ceased, Russia sent in 5,000 
troops. Relations between the Moldovan government and the separatists 
remain tense. Last week, the presidents of Moldova, Ukraine and Romania 
urged Russia to withdraw its troops from the breakaway region. During 
Lucinschi's Poland visit, he and Kwasniewski are expected to sign 
agreements on regional, military and labor cooperation.
