It was an up day in Hong Kong today when the government said it bought 
up seven percent of the benchmark Hang Sang stock index in late August. 
Paying out over $15 billion U.S. to discourage speculators who are 
betting against the market and the territory's currency pegged to 
the U.S. dollar. Theois Kirsimpkin says the government insists it 
made the right decision. Well government officials here say their 
intervention two months ago in the stock market has really paid off. 
And that it has successfully chased away currency speculators who, 
it alleges, have been making huge profits by selling the Hong Kong 
dollar to drive up interest rates and to manipulate stock prices. 
And the government plans to hang on to its holdings as part of its 
investment portfolio.
