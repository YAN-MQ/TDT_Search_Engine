Greece has no ``fundamental objections'' to Turkey's membership in 
the European Union, but said its rival still has a long way to go 
before it can join the group. ``Greece believes that Turkey has a 
future in the European family,'' Greece's foreign minister said Monday 
in a report given to an EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg. 
The two NATO allies have been divided over Aegean Sea disputes that 
have brought them to the edge of war twice in the last decade. In 
the 41-page report, obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday, Greece 
said that ``we have no fundamental objections, nor any dogmatic opposition 
to ... Turkey becoming a member of the European Union.'' Delivered 
by Greece's foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, the report blamed 
Turkey's failure to meet EU criteria on issues such as democracy, 
the economy and human rights for keeping it out of the Union. ``Thorough 
constitutional and legislative reforms and the respect of human rights 
constitute the ultimate yardstick Turkey has to comply with for the 
further strengthening of its ties with the EU,'' it said. The report 
also includes a chapter on the war-divided island of Cyprus and its 
bid for EU membership. EU foreign ministers were discussing Cyprus' 
bid, along with those of Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia 
and Estonia, who are expected to join the Union in the next decade. 
The EU begins membership talks with these countries next month.
