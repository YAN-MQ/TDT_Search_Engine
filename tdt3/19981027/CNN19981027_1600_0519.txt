This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Wednesday. A slow-moving storm system moves from the 
Rockies into the plains states, bringing some showers and thunderstorms 
to that region. There will be some mountain snow lingering across 
the mountains of northern colorado. Meanwhile, another cold front 
moves into the western United States, behind it cooler temperatures, 
also some rain and mountain snow. There will be some showers across 
the northeast, but the southeastern part of the United States should 
see another beautiful day with readings in the 70s and 80s. 50s and 
60s north of there, 40s and 50s across the northwestern United States. 
Looking ahead to Thursday, look for showers in the northwest and northeast, 
with showers and storms through the central part of the country as 
well. On Friday, those showers and storms from the west push into 
the southwest. We'll see rain showers in the midwest and some lingering 
rain in the northwest and northeast as well. Finally, Saturday, showers 
and storms through the plains with rain in the northwest, rather cool 
in the plains as well. Don't forget, four-day forecasts for 7,200
