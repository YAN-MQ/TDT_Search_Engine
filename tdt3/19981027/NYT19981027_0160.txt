At first sight, the new show at the Musee d'Orsay suggests a bizarre 
attempt to resuscitate a neglected 19th-century French painter by 
exhibiting him alongside a rather more famous name. In truth, the 
idea of uniting Jean-Francois Millet and van Gogh is far more interesting. 
Since the Dutchman looked to the Frenchman as a role model, Millet's 
life and work serve as a mirror that reveals much about Van Gogh. 
Of course, van Gogh's name alone would suffice to draw crowds to ``Millet/Van 
Gogh'' just as it is doing to ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' at the National 
Gallery in Washington. Both exhibitions, which run through Jan. 3, 
have also benefited from the closure for renovation of the Van Gogh 
Museum in Amsterdam, which has sent 70 paintings to Washington and 
provided 27 of the 53 van Goghs on display here. Millet, however, 
gives the Paris show an unusually strong theme. The exhibition displays 
two dozen or so of Millet's paintings and engravings alongside van 
Gogh's copies of the same works as well as others inspired by Millet's 
pastoral themes. It also records van Gogh's remarkable progress as 
an artist: his early copies are clumsy; his later copies overwhelm 
the originals. Yet his identity with Millet ran much deeper. He never 
met the French naturalist painter, but he was immediately impressed 
when he came across his drawings and engravings of peasant life at 
an exhibition in Paris shortly after Millet's death in January 1875. 
Five years later, when van Gogh himself decided to become an artist, 
he acquired copies and photographs of some of Millet's work to assist 
his early drawing efforts. More significantly, in 1882 van Gogh obtained 
a copy of Alfred Sensier's new biography of Millet and it proved a 
revelation. Its pages portrayed Millet as a man of piety, virtue, 
simplicity and courage whose proximity to nature and peasants tilling 
the land exuded a spirituality that spoke to van Gogh's own search 
for a meaning to life. The Dutchman, who had turned away from the 
formal Christianity of his pastor father, found a new pantheistic 
father-guide in Millet. ``It gives me courage to read Sensier's book 
about Millet,'' he wrote to his brother Theo. In 1883, now 30, van 
Gogh returned to Nuenen to live with his parents, but his objective 
was to move closer to nature, indeed to follow the rustic peasant 
life style that Millet supposedly adopted during the final 26 years 
of life at Barbizon. In another letter to Theo, van Gogh wrote that 
Millet ``desired nothing more'' than to share ``the food, drink, clothes 
and sleep'' of the peasants. Soon, van Gogh himself assumed the appearance 
of a peasant. To those who knew Millet in life, however, Sensier's 
account was more hagiography than biography. Millet may have worn 
clogs and simple clothes, but he enjoyed the company of artists and 
writers. He had been poor, but not from choice, and in later years 
his paintings sold well. He was presented as a man of fervent faith, 
but he was apparently an agnostic. In brief, van Gogh was devoted 
to a Millet who probably never existed.``If semi-truths pervade Sensier's 
book, it is no less true that, using elements of the biography, van 
Gogh created his own image of Millet, one into which he projected 
a great deal of himself,'' wrote Louis van Tilborgh, chief curator 
at Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum and one of the organizers of this show. 
``Van Gogh then supported his vision of Millet through his careful 
selection of Millet's major works.'' In Nuenen, van Gogh was able 
to find his own subjects among the local peasantry, but his principal 
inspiration remained Millet. As early as 1881, van Gogh had copied 
perhaps Millet's greatest work, ``A Sower'' (1850), and he would return 
to the subject triumphantly years later, although his early version 
compares poorly with the original. He also did his own variations 
of Millet's ``Potato Planters'' and other farming scenes, struggling 
by his own admission to capture figures in movement. Like Millet, 
van Gogh showed little interest in the faces of peasant farmers, which 
often appeared blurred or in shadow. When he did, as in ``Potato Eaters'' 
and two portraits of peasants, all done in 1885, he painted them as 
physiognomically primitive, as if ``a resolutely animal expression,'' 
as van Tilborgh put it, brought them closer to nature. In 1884, having 
already declared Millet to be his ``father'' and ``eternal master,'' 
van Gogh wrote to his brother: ``For me, it is not Manet, but Millet 
who is the essentially modern painter who has opened the horizons 
for many others.'' In March 1886, van Gogh moved to Paris and Millet's 
influence suddenly receded. The Dutchman discovered Impressionism 
and befriended bohemians like Toulouse-Lautrec and Gaugin. His own 
painting also changed radically, abandoning Millet's mid-19th-century 
neo-classicism and somber colors for the thick brush strokes and vivid 
colors that would make him famous. Yet when van Gogh returned to the 
countryside, moving to Arles in February 1888, Millet re-entered his 
life. He turned again to Millet's themes, but he now attacked them 
with violent yellows and blues that reflected the wheatfields and 
skies of Provence. He was also ready to try his hand afresh with a 
new ``Sower'' series, climaxing with one of his most dramatic works, 
showing a large sun rising behind the darkened figure of a sower, 
with a gnarled and blackened tree truck cutting across the entire 
image. In April 1889, increasingly aware of his mental instability, 
van Gogh checked into a hospital at St.-Remy-de-Provence, but after 
a break he resumed painting. Working from engraved copies, he completed 
his own copies of a series of 10 oils painted by Millet in 1852 called 
``Work in the Fields,'' each showing some aspect of peasant labor. 
During this period, he also painted ``Noon: Rest from Work'' from 
an engraving of ``La Meridienne,'' which Millet executed in 1866. 
``The copies of Millet are perhaps what you do best,'' Theo wrote 
to van Gogh at the time. ``They make me think that when you start 
painting compositions of figures, great surprises will await us.'' 
Even with ``Starry Night'' (1888-1889), in which the gaslights of 
Arles shimmer in the water of the Rhone, van Gogh seems to be following 
his mentor, who painted a ``Starry Night'' above a shadowy countryside 
in the late 1850s. Yet there is no evidence that van Gogh ever saw 
a copy of Millet's version. Perhaps by then, he was working purely 
on instinct. ``I have a terrible need for _ I will use the word _ 
religion,'' he wrote to Theo nine months before his suicide at in 
July 1890, ``so I go outside at night to paint the stars.''
