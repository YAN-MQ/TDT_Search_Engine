In today's medical news, there is some bad news for people like myself, 
women. First heart attacks are deadlier for women than men according 
to a new study in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
Researchers in Barcelona, Spain studied more than 1,100 male and 330 
female first-time heart attack patients. They found that the death 
rate for women during the month after a first heart attack was almost 
19 percent compared to eight percent for men, a 72 percent greater 
risk for women. The disparity continued to be about the same during 
the first six months after an initial heart attack. The study found 
that he women were, in general, older and sicker than the men when 
they suffered their first heart attacks and waited longer to go to 
a hospital for treatment. According to the American Heart Association, 
men and women suffer about the same number of heart attacks.
