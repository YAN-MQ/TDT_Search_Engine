The Philippine peso finished stronger Tuesday, closing at a four-month 
high of 41 pesos to the dollar on a steady stream of foreign-exchange 
inflows. Stocks ended mixed as most issues succumbed to profit-taking 
on recent gains, although bargain hunting in selected blue chips lifted 
the main index. The dollar averaged 41.22 pesos for the day, down 
from Monday's average of 41.806 pesos. The last two deals were for 
a total dlrs 1.5 million at 41 pesos. Volume ballooned to dlrs 286.5 
million from the previous session's dlrs 187 million. Traders said 
the dollar's major support of 41 pesos will likely be breached Wednesday 
as demand wanes and foreign exchange inflows from overseas Filipino 
workers and for stock investments increase. The dollar was last dealt 
below 41 pesos on June 22. The Philippine Central Bank has projected 
a 10 percent increase in remittances by overseas Filipinos from dlrs 
5.7 billion last year, while the stock market is steadily picking 
up as interest rates decline. Some banks, one trader said, were already 
shorting the dollar on expectations foreign exchange inflows will 
rise further. Aside from the steady inflows, traders said the peso 
is trying to mirror the recent gains of other currencies, such as 
the Thai baht, which used to be weaker against the dollar compared 
with the peso. The dollar was at 37.425 baht Tuesday. ``We're trying 
to play catch up with other currencies in the region,'' said a trader 
for a foreign bank. The central bank wasn't active in the spot market 
and kept its overnight borrowing and lending rates unchanged at 13.75 
percent and 15.75 percent, respectively. In stock trading, the 30-share 
Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 6.10 points, or 0.4 percent, 
to 1,592.50, extending a 62.42-point gain on Monday. Decliners, however, 
outnumbered gainers 73 to 51, while 33 issues were unchanged. The 
main index has risen 124.81 points, or 8.5 percent, since Oct. 21. 
Dealers said the market got off to a strong start Tuesday, with the 
main index climbing 42 points before profit-taking eroded most of 
the early gains. ``It was prudent for investors to start cashing in 
on gains made in the past sessions,'' said Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice 
president of Diversified Securities Inc. ``We were due for a correction.'' 
Philippine Long Distance Telephone shares closed up 10 pesos, or 1.1 
percent, at 940 pesos on persistent speculation it is set to sign 
a deal with Hong Kong's First Pacific, under which the latter will 
acquire a substantial stake in the telecommunications company. Both 
companies declined to comment. Shortly after the market closed Tuesday, 
PLDT announced it has shelved a shareholders' rights plan that was 
designed to repel possible hostile takeovers. Garcia said profit-taking 
may continue to weigh on overbought Manila shares in the next few 
sessions, but investors left behind by the recent rally may take advantage 
of price dips and accumulate fundamentally sound issues. ``The market 
correction may not last long. For as long as the peso remains strong, 
we should see shares eventually moving higher,'' he said.
