Under pressure from his right flank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
has postponed ratification of the new Israeli-Palestinian accord by 
his Cabinet until Palestinians show a plan to fight terrorism to the 
United States. The delay drew angry condemnations from Palestinian 
officials, who accused Netanyahu of appeasing right-wing critics, 
who have mounted a fierce campaign against the agreement and have 
vowed to unseat the prime minister. Netanyahu announced the postponement 
on Tuesday hours after the Palestinian police announced that they 
had arrested the killers of a Jewish settler shot near Hebron on Monday 
_ a swift response widely seen as an outcome of the accord. A statement 
released by Netanyahu's spokesman said that he had decided to postpone 
a Cabinet meeting to ratify the agreement that had been scheduled 
for Thursday. The agreement calls for a further Israeli withdrawal 
from 13 percent of the West Bank in return for specific Palestinian 
measures to fight violence by anti-Israeli militants. ``At the Wye 
summit the Palestinians committed to complete within one week a working 
plan to combat terrorism, but this evening it became clear that the 
plan will not be completed on schedule,'' the statement said. ``Once 
the working plan is received, the Cabinet will convene to ratify the 
accord.'' This was the first hitch in last week's agreement, which 
is to be enacted in stages over 12 weeks or more. The ``Wye Memorandum'' 
signed at the White House last Friday said that ``a working plan developed 
by the Palestinian side will be shared with the U.S.'' within 10 days. 
[``The agreement is due to enter into force on Nov. 2,'' said David 
Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said in Washington. 
``We expect that both parties will take the necessary steps in a timely 
manner to allow them to meet their commitments.'' The Palestinian 
security plan is not due to be submitted until Friday and does not 
enter into force until next Monday, an official said, speaking on 
condition that he not be identified. ``There's plenty of time to work 
this out.'') According to David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's communications 
director, the Israelis had learned that the working plan would not 
be submitted by Friday as scheduled. A Palestinian official who declined 
to be named said that Palestinian security officials were to meet 
their Israeli counterparts on Wednesday to explain the plan. Both 
Bar-Illan and Palestinian officials attributed Netanyahu's move to 
the strong resistance he has encountered among his rightist allies 
in the governing coalition, including some Cabinet ministers opposed 
to the accord. ``He has to make sure these people understand that 
he intends to see to it that the agreement is kept,'' Bar-Illan said. 
``Otherwise it will be difficult to sell the idea that this is a good 
agreement. He has to show that he is not playing around here, that 
he is going to insist on reciprocity and compliance.'' Ahmad Abdel 
Rahman, a senior aide to Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, said: 
``He has problems with his coalition. This is for internal reasons, 
but he blames us as usual.'' Hassan Asfour, a member of the Palestinian 
team at the Wye talks, accused Netanyahu of trying to wriggle out 
of the accord. ``He is under pressure and the settlers are against 
him,'' Asfour said. ``He wants to create propaganda for the settlers, 
and he is looking for any excuse to escape the agreement because he 
doesn't like it.'' The right-wing protests against Netanyahu reached 
a new crescendo on Monday night when demonstrators outside his residence 
in Jerusalem chanted ``Bibi is a traitor!'' and held up posters showing 
blood dripping form his handshake with Arafat. Israeli officials from 
the president to the speaker of Parliament condemned the demonstrations, 
saying they were reminiscent of incendiary protests that preceded 
the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin on Nov. 4, 1995. 
With security measures around Netanyahu visibly heightened and the 
anniversary of the assassination drawing near, there is growing concern 
in Israel about the danger of another political killing. Netanyahu 
was also denounced on Tuesday at the funeral of the Danny Vargas, 
the settler slain near Hebron. Mourners cried out for revenge and 
condemned the accord as a recipe for more bloodshed. ``This is a surrender 
of the Land of Israel and an abandonment of Jewish lives!,'' said 
Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a founder of the Jewish settlement in Hebron. 
``Bibi is abandoning Jews more and more!'' But as Vargas was buried, 
there were signs of growing Palestinian security cooperation with 
the Israelis. A spokesman for the Palestinian General Intelligence 
announced that two men, identified as Jamil Khalifa and Ismat Mutaweh, 
had been arrested and had confessed to the killing. They also admitted 
to the slaying of another Israeli at a hillside spring outside Jerusalem 
on Oct. 13, the spokesman said. Dr. Ahmad Tibi, an aide to Arafat, 
said that the men had denied membership in any organization and maintained 
that they had acted on their own. ``I hope the the Israeli authorities 
will catch up with the murderers of Mohammed Zalmout,'' Tibi added. 
Zalmout, a 68-year-old Palestinian, was found battered to death near 
a West Bank settlement hours after the killing of Vargas, apparently 
the victim of a revenge attack.
