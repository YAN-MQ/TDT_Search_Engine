Hurricane Mitch is not expected to threaten the U.S. mainland, but 
NASA forecasters are concerned high winds from the storm could delay 
Thursday's planned lift-off of the space shuttle "discovery." Monday, 
John Glenn and the rest of the shuttle crew arrived at Kennedy space 
center to begin final preparations for the launch. The retiring senator 
is assigned to be payload specialist number two, the lowest position 
on "discovery." At 77, Glenn will have the distinction of being the 
oldest person in space. This is going to be a research rich flight. 
We've got about 83 projects on this, and we couldn't -- I couldn't 
have, if i'd had my own pick of people -- I don't think I could have 
picked better than the people I'm going to be flying with. So we're 
just looking forward, very, very much to Thursday and getting off 
on time, we hope, and keep that weather out of here that's down south. 
Later in the newscast, we'll tell you how NASA determines who has 
the "Right stuff" to make it into space.
