Karl Malone has a new gig during the lockout. The Utah jazz forward 
is hosting an afternoon radio talk show in Los angeles. Isn't it ironic 
that I have been in Utah for 13 years and have to come to l.A. to 
get a radio show? It's the big time, pal. I guess I've arrived now. 
That's big time, but I'm excited about it. Mike Sammond, "CNN Headline 
Sports."
