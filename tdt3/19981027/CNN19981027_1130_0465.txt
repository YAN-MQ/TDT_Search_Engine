I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." You 
see in the bottom of your screen hurricane Mitch, which continues 
to be a very strong hurricane in the Caribbean that will likely continue 
to move towards the Mexican Yucatan peninsula over the next couple 
of days. Elsewhere high pressure, fair weather over the southeast. 
We do have a storm that will be moving in through the plains, producing 
some showers and a few thunderstorms. And mountain snows are expected 
behind the next front as it pushes in through portions of the northwest. 
A look at temperatures, pretty warm along the gulf coast for the remainder 
of today, into the 80s. 50s back in through the southern Rockies, 
and a large area of 60s through the upper midwest. A look now at the 
extended forecast. On Thursday, showers and storms will be found in 
the upper midwest. Rain and windy conditions in the northeast. Look 
for colder weather to be moving in through the northern Rockies as 
it remains mild in the southeast. More warm temperatures along the 
gulf coast on Friday, with temperatures turning cooler through the 
dakotas, back through Minnesota into the 40s for highs. And by Saturday, 
again that colder air settled over the upper midwest as temperatures 
turn cooler, as well, in portions of the northeast. For more weather 
information, including four-day forecasts for 7,200 cities, log into
