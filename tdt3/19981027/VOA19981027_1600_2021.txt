Britain has advised its citizens to avoid all non-essential travel 
to Chili, due to the volatile conditions following the London arrest 
of former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinocek. Mr. Pinocek is under 
guard in a London hospital. A Spanish judge requested the extradition 
of the 82 year-old ex dictator to stand trial on charges of genocide. 
A London court is to rule on the legality of the arrest Wednesday.
