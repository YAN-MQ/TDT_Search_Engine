The Thai capitol, Bangkok, has unveiled the first stage of a mass 
transportation system aimed at ending infamous traffic jams. The elevated 
electric railway, called the Sky Train cost $1.2 billion. That's double 
the price tag expected. From Bangkok, Simon Ingram reports. It's taken 
almost five years to build a 23 kilometer long concrete viaduct extending 
down some of the city's biggest and most congested thoroughfares. 
The government is pressing the Sky Train's private owners to extend 
the line further into the northern and southern suburbs. Otherwise, 
they fear middle class Thais will see no advantage in leaving their 
cars at home and using public transport, instead. Simon Ingram, BBC, 
Bangkok. The system will have to undergo another year of tests before 
it opens to the public.
