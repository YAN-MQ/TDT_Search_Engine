John Glenn's historic return to space tomorrow appears to be right 
on schedule. Forecasters say there's a 70% chance for favorable weather, 
although winds from hurricane Mitch are still a concern. Glenn and 
his shuttle "discovery" crewmates are enjoying some rare leisure time 
today. During the mission, Glenn will participate in several scientific 
experiments, including a study on the effects of weightlessness on 
the human body.
