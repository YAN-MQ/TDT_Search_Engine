The eyes of NAto are on Kosovo today watching to ensure that Yugoslav 
troops pull out before a deadline expires in a few hours. NAto ambassadors 
are gathering in Brussels to review Yugoslavia's compliance with international 
agreements. NAto has threatened to launch air strikes if Belgrade 
does not withdraw much of its military forces from the province. Observers 
say Serb troops are making a significant last-minute pullback. Several 
convoys of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks carrying troops 
and police left a short while ago. Thousands of ethnic Albanians who 
fled the Serb crackdown are now streaming back into their wrecked 
homes. Thousands of Albanians who have been living out in the forests 
all summer long, and as winter approached were in great danger, are 
beginning to come back. So it looks to me like there's very substantial 
compliance. I'm not going to speak for what NatO will do at 2:00. 
Jodi:, but I think NATO's pressure crediblely applied over the last 
three weeks, has resulted in a very dramatic set of events and there's 
more to come. NATO officials say they will deploy a rapid reaction 
force in Macedonia they could be sent into Kosovo if Yugoslavia does 
not fully comply with nATO demands. The force reportedly would not 
contain U.S. troops.
