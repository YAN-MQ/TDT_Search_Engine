Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put the brakes on cabinet 
approval of the new interim peace agreement reached with the Palestinians 
last week. Mr. Netanyahu's spokesman said, "The Palestinians have 
failed to keep their commitment to submit a detailed security plan, 
within a week." From Jerusalem, Lise Dusette reports. Mr. Netanyahu 
was set to convene his cabinet on Thursday for what would undoubtedly 
be a stormy debate on the new interim agreement. Now that debate and 
a decision on whether to accept the deal has been put off indefinitely. 
Mr. Netanyahu's spokesman said, the Palestinians had failed to submit 
a detailed security plan to the Israelis this week. It's not clear 
what was agreed, but the Prime Minister's sudden decision underlines 
his obsession with reciprocity. As he puts it, "the Palestinians must 
give, and only then, we give." Lise Dusette, BBC, Jerusalem.
