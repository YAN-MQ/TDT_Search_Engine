A German labor union was expected to decide Tuesday if it wants to 
join a proposed merger of five labor groups that would create one 
of the biggest unions in the world. A key concern of delegates of 
Germany's print union, IG-Medien, debating the plan in this Bavarian 
city is whether a bigger union will succeed in strengthening Germany's 
labor movement. Supporters hope the merger will help maintain labor's 
leverage in an era of industry consolidation. Others questioned whether 
bigger was better, and suggested the merger may make them more unwieldy. 
Also discussing the plan was HBV, a union representing the banking 
and insurance sector, in the northern city of Bremen. HBV is expected 
to vote for the merger. Leaders of five of Germany's service industry 
unions _ DAG, OeTV, IG Medien, HBV, and DPG _ agreed in principle 
in February on plans to merge by around 2000. A final decision isn't 
expected until November 1999. The combined group would represent nearly 
4 million employees, including clerical, transportation, education, 
media and postal workers.
