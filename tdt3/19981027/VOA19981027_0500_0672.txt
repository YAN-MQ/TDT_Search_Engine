a new chancellor will be sworn into office in Germany later today. 
The 16 year long government of Helmic Cole came to an end on Monday. 
But he was honored with the Grand Cross, one of the country's highest 
civilian awards. Mr. Cole's Christian democrats were defeated by Germany's 
social democrats, the SPD, in elections on September 27. After three 
weeks of negotiations, a new coalition government of the SPD and Germany's 
environmental Greens Party is ready to take control. Here is Suzanne 
Kelly with a report from Bohn. The new members of parliament called 
deputies, began their opening session on Monday, after a church service 
and meetings with their individual parties. Deputies will elect Gerhard 
Schroder as Germany's new chancellor on Tuesday, making him Germany's 
seventh post war chancellor. Mr. Schroder needs 335 votes to be elected. 
His own SPD along with the Greens, control 345 seats in the new parliament. 
Once Mr. Schroder is sworn in, President Hestag will swear in the 
new ministers. Including some from the Greens Party. The new distribution 
of seats in the parliament will give Mr. Schroder and his coalition 
partners a 21-seat majority in the new government. Mr. Schroder's 
first cabinet meeting will come on Tuesday evening. His promise that 
among his first orders of business will be finding ways to lower Germany's 
more than 10 percent unemployment rate. A tax reform plan has already 
been presented. But many German industry associations and taxpayer 
groups say that it is not nearly enough to stimulate employment. The 
incoming German Chancellor begins office with German media reports 
of a power struggle between him and his soon to be finance minister, 
Oscar Lafontane. The man who heads the Social Democratic Party. Both 
men deny the report. Suzanne Kelly for VOA News, Bohn.
