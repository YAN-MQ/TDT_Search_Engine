Some people bottle up their pain. The stars of the new movie "living 
out loud" try singing and dancing their sorrows away. Here's Michael 
Okwu. You look very nice in your uniform. Thank you. Lost souls become 
kindred spirits as three people learn how to live life out loud instead 
of keeping quiet. I feel so invisible sometimes I forget I'm here. 
Holly Hunter's in that tumultuous spot, you know, that tragic spot, 
really. I mean, her husband leaves her, and she and Pat, my character, 
is dealing with this grief, and nobody looks at him. Nobody even knows 
he exists and queen latifah, what a performance. Queen latifah stars 
opposite holly Hunter and Danny DeVito as a Local jazz singer, a seeming 
departure for the rap artist. It was fine for me. I mean I play this 
kind of music in my house, so it was natural. It wasn't -- there was 
nothing uncomfortable about it. It was actually more exciting, My 
husband left me. My husband cheated on me. Left and right. And one 
day, he tells me it's my fault he sees other women. So I pick up a 
knife and say it's his fault I was stabbing him. I wish I would've 
stabbed my husband. There is no violence in this film. All of the 
battles these characters fight are internal. And love finds them when 
they least expect it. You have to make yourself available for that 
moment. You never know when it's going to happen. With this movie, 
uh, it was centered around a Kiss, which I thought had a Great deal 
of beauty about it. To be kissed by a stranger in a dark room was 
such a fantastic launch for a Movie. And a great beginning for a lonely 
woman. You don't leave this film feeling like "aw, man, this happened 
and that happened." You're not going to have that feeling. Because 
it's funny, number one. And then it's like, "yeah, all right." That's 
kind of the feeling you have at the end. "I'm happy for them, I'm 
happy. Michael Okwu, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
