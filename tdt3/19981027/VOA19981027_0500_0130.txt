The West Bank town of Hebron remains closed as Israeli and Palestinian 
police search for those responsible for killing a young Israeli settler 
and an elderly Palestinian farmer. Israeli police say the two deaths 
Monday may have happened about the same time and may not necessarily 
be related. The killings were the first since last Friday's signing 
of the new Middle East peace accord and have raised tensions between 
Jewish settlers and Palestinian militants, both opposed to the deal.
