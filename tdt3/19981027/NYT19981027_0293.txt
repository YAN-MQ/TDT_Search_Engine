A sweetly knowing look crosses the face of the lovely young Miranda. 
``You must learn to love someone else apart from me, Sara,'' she says 
to a schoolmate. ``I won't be here much longer.'' It never becomes 
clear how Miranda knows that, but in Peter Weir's ``Picnic at Hanging 
Rock,'' as mysterious as ever in two new video editions, just about 
everything keeps us guessing. What we do know is that the year is 
1900, that the location is central Australia and that by sundown on 
Saint Valentine's Day, Miranda (Anne Lambert) and two other students 
at the brutally proper Appleyard College for young women will have 
drifted away during a picnic as if hypnotized, disappearing among 
the crags of the 500-foot-high volcanic formation called Hanging Rock. 
Later, one of the girls, Irma (Karen Robson), is found unconscious 
on the ground, but she remembers nothing about what happened. So there 
the case stands for the harried constable, Sergeant Bumpher (Wyn Roberts), 
his bloodhounds and his Aborigine tracker in a red jacket and three-cornered 
hat: three dewy young women, almost vaporous to begin with in the 
throes of awakening desires, suddenly vanished without leaving a trace. 
Having gotten into a tantalizing situation, Weir's film takes an unusual 
route out of it. This is a film, it can be safely said, that defies 
convention. Released in 1975, it earned an international reputation 
as an early example of the emerging Australian school of filmmaking. 
Financial complications kept it out of circulation for the last 15 
years, but this summer it had a theatrical revival, and last week 
it was reissued on a new videotape from Home Vision and in a stunning 
digital video disk edition, recut by Weir, from the Criterion Collection. 
Reflecting shifting vision and intent, Weir's themes have ranged from 
the metaphysical in ``Picnic at Hanging Rock'' and the ``The Last 
Wave'' (1977) to political strife in ``Gallipoli'' (1981) and ``The 
Year of Living Dangerously'' (1983). Later came Hollywood productions: 
``Witness'' (1985) and ``The Mosquito Coast'' (1986), both starring 
Harrison Ford; ``Dead Poets Society'' (1989), for which he won an 
Oscar nomination, and, most recently, ``The Truman Show.'' In the 
early work, mystical forces of irrationality have their way with a 
prosaic world. ``I understand what interested me as a young man,'' 
Weir, 54, said on the telephone from Sydney, ``but I left that field 
of storytelling after `The Last Wave' because it was a cul-de-sac 
and didn't lead to larger areas.'' Nevertheless, the metaphysical 
has its pull. ``As hard as I've tried, I've failed to become a materialist,'' 
he said. By re-editing ``Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' he revisits, as 
he put it, ``unmeasured forces that lead you into religious speculation.'' 
Not everything comes clear in such circumstances, or needs to. The 
departure for the film, and a risky one for a mystery that begs for 
a solution, lies in an enigma that is never resolved. As the young 
women in long white dresses climb the forbidden rock in the stifling 
heat, they shed their shoes and socks, a startling act in that time. 
A low, chilling moan comes from the rock. The girls crumple in a swoon, 
and when they awake they are possessed, compelled upward by _ what? 
_ some kind of force. Plainly they are being carried off. One girl, 
though, is unaffected. She screams in terror and races down to get 
help. ``The genre really was a kind of whodunit,'' Weir said. But 
who did what? Well, these are virginal young women. ``She's quite 
intact, yes, quite intact,'' says old Doc McKenzie (Jack Fegan) after 
examining Irma. ``Part of the fun is trying to guess what the ending 
might be,'' Weir said. ``The challenge was to let the audience know 
in a way that wouldn't upset them that there wasn't going to be an 
ending. To switch off the expectation.'' Attention was diverted to 
mood, which is stoked most effectively by a mix of electronic music, 
pipes and classical passages. From its meticulously studied gentry 
in their heavy formal attire to the buzzing of a fly in the sweltering 
torpor, feeling and attitude, both menacing and mischievous, slowly 
overtake the viewer's concern about missing pieces of the puzzle.``It 
was quite bold because it wasn't the style of narrative, but the use 
of sound and music and sensual overload,'' said Ms. Robson, who was 
17 when she played Irma and now is an entertainment lawyer in New 
York. The film is based on a novel by Joan Lindsay, who in turn based 
her book on what was believed to be a true story. Records show no 
such incident, but the tale is so alluring that Weir and others who 
were involved with the film are reluctant to question its veracity. 
``Who's to say it couldn't have happened?'' said Ms. Robson. For some, 
``Picnic at Hanging Rock'' is a period horror piece. But there is 
also much teasing playfulness _ mysteriously missing undergarments, 
a lizard with a quizzical look waddling by a young woman passed out 
on the grass, a girl's hand reaching for a piece of paper up on the 
rock _ dangling a false expectation that the riddle might yet have 
a solution. Basically, though, the film can be seen as a hallucinatory 
clash between society, its banners of repression flying, and sly, 
predatory forces lying in wait where manicured lawns stop and the 
alien wild begins. Weir has trimmed the film slightly. He had wanted 
to make the adjustments when it went to the Cannes International Film 
Festival in the 70s. ``To mesmerize the audience, I had to experiment 
with rhythm,'' he said. ``Too slow and the film would become indulgent. 
You would see the wheels turning.'' Not wanting to tinker with a winner, 
the film's backers objected. ``No one would let me touch it,'' he 
said, ``because it was a freak anyway, and they thought if you touched 
it, everything would collapse.''
