A new study finds low expectations and social pressure can result 
in low iq scores. Researchers at the University of Iowa divided students 
into several groups. Before giving the test, researchers told some 
right-handed students that right-handers did not score well on iq 
tests, and those who did score well were resented. Researchers told 
some left-handed students the same thing about left-handers. The students 
who were told they would score lower did. Researchers say this could 
explain certain discrepancies in test scores. The study suggests that 
members of minority groups are more likely to have negative expectations 
for a positive performance. In other words, if people expect to be 
punished in some way for getting a High score, then they're lakely 
to score lower on the test. The study is published in the American 
journal of sociology.
