You are listening to the Voice of America. We are broadcasting from 
Washington. I am Charlene Porter along with Paul Westfailing on this 
hour of VOA News Now. Ten hours, 18, universal time on News Now and 
a top story this morning that we are following. Russian President, 
Boris Yeltsin is admitted to a sanitarium to recover from exhaustion 
and erratic blood pressure. We all hope to be talking to our correspondent 
in Moscow at the bottom of the hour. That will be about 12 minutes 
from now.
