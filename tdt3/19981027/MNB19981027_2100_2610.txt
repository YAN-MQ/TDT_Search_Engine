Something similar between the two missions we talked about this last 
night on his first earth orbit, the people in Australia flashed their 
lights at John Glenn, nighttime there as he passed over. Same thing 
happened late this ave, nighttime in perth, Australia. They did it 
and the shuttle astronauts saw it.
