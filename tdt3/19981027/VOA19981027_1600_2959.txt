Well, you have not looked recently. Unfortunately, we closed down, 
but it was not too bad. The Dow Jones Industrial average ended up 
down 66 points, closing at 8,366. Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed 
at 1,065. That was down 7 points and NASDAQ was also off by 7. Analysts 
say some traders got upset about rumors that Brazil is going to devalue 
its currency and that is despite the fact that all the experts say 
those rumors are not completely unfounded. But analysts do say some 
pull back in U.S. stock prices is certainly to be expected. After 
the recent strong rallies we had last week and late the week before. 
A monthly index of consumer confidence in the United States is down 
for the fourth month in a row. Analysts say falling consumer confidence 
could mean some trouble for American retailers. They are preparing 
for the Christmas shopping season, which starts at the end of November. 
Once again, the Dow Jones Industrial average ended up down 66 points. 
This is Breckardt Ray. Thank you, Breech. Appreciate that live report 
from New York.
