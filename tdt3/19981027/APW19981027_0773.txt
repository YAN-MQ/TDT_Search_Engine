Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov received promises of European 
Union support Tuesday for his government's reform efforts but no new 
financial commitments to bolster the country's devastated economy. 
Instead, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said he hoped the second 
tranche of a dlrs 22.2 billion International Monetary Fund loan package 
can be transmitted as soon as Russia submits an economic reform program.
