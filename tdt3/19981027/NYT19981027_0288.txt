In the early fall of 1962, a group of New York theater artists ventured 
down to Philadelphia to try out a new musical comedy, ``Little Me,'' 
based on a racy novel by Patrick Dennis. In terms of comedy and drama, 
they found, offstage events sometimes rivaled those in the show: a 
bathroom sink untimely ripped from a wall, a police officer commandeered 
to arrest the creative team, and a world teetering on the brink of 
nuclear annihilation. ``It was a very scary time,'' recalled the playwright 
Neil Simon, who wrote the show's book and at 34 was fresh from his 
first Broadway success, ``Come Blow Your Horn.'' ``It was during the 
Cuban missile crisis, and it really looked like the world might end. 
My wife, Joan, was at home in New York with our daughter, Ellen, and 
Joan called me almost in tears, saying, `You've got to come home, 
because if we're going to die I want all of us to die together.' I 
was prepared to leave if it looked like it was really getting bad.'' 
The rest of the group included the producers Cy Feuer and Ernest Martin, 
among whose credits were ``Guys and Dolls'' and ``How to Succeed in 
Business Without Really Trying''; Sid Caesar, the hugely talented 
and equally troubled television star of ``Your Show of Shows'' and 
``Caesar's Hour''; Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh, the composer-lyricist 
songwriting team that had recently collaborated on ``Wildcat,'' their 
first Broadway show together; and Bob Fosse, who was co-directing 
with Feuer and had already won Tony Awards for choreographing ``The 
Pajama Game,'' ``Damn Yankees'' and ``Redhead.'' In recent interviews, 
Caesar, Coleman, Feuer and Simon _ who has written about the show 
in his 1996 memoir, ``Rewrites'' _ remembered the days they spent 
together 36 years ago in a Manhattan rehearsal hall, at the Erlanger 
Theater in Philadelphia and at the Lunt-Fontanne on Broadway. (Ms. 
Leigh died in 1983, Fosse in 1987 and Martin in 1995.) A revival of 
the musical, starring Martin Short and Faith Prince, presented by 
the Roundabout Theater Company, is opening on Nov. 12 at the Criterion 
Center Stage Right. It was Simon who gave the show its essential form, 
and its star. ``The book was about a woman,'' Feuer said. ``But it 
was Neil's idea to make it about a man.'' The woman is Belle Schlumpfert 
(played by Virginia Martin in the 1962 show), a generously endowed 
innocent from the wrong side of the tracks who becomes rich and socially 
acceptable through her relationships with seven very different men 
_ beginning in 1900 with Noble Eggleston, the richest and handsomest 
boy in town. ``Neil said, `Why not have one actor play all seven men?' 
'' Feuer said. ``And as a result the star became a man.'' As far as 
Simon was concerned, that star could be only one person _ Sid Caesar. 
``I had written for him for four years on television,'' Simon said, 
``and his comedy seemed ideal for the role.'' Caesar had been on Broadway 
before, in a revue called ``Make Mine Manhattan'' in 1948, but he 
soon found that doing seven roles in one show was very different. 
``I did all eight shows a week,'' Caesar said. ``It's not like today, 
when some actors do six shows and skip the matinees. I had 36 costume 
changes, so in a matinee and evening there were 72 changes. Some were 
so quick I went offstage and it felt like I was meeting myself coming 
on.'' (A Broadway revival in 1982, in which James Coco and Victor 
Garber divided Caesar's roles, flopped.) The costume changes may have 
been difficult, but memorizing the lines precisely was at first equally 
troublesome. ``On television, Sid would paraphrase and it was fine,'' 
Simon said. ``Because whatever he paraphrased was just as funny as 
what we wrote. But in the theater you can't paraphrase. You have to 
say it directly, because the other actor has to know what his cue 
is.'' Feuer said that when he told Caesar he had to say every line, 
``Sid was horrified. He found it very difficult not to just give vent 
to his natural comedic sense.'' One night, that sense failed him. 
``Sid was playing Noble Eggleston,'' Simon said. ``Things haven't 
worked out for Belle and him, and after a long time they meet again 
but they're married to other people. She says, `Oh, Noble, isn't there 
some way we can go on seeing each other?' And he says, `What do you 
want to do? Check into cheap hotels? Sneak around back alleys, lying 
to our family and friends?' And she says, `Of course not.' And he 
says, `Well, it was just a suggestion.' Every night there was a huge, 
huge laugh.'' But at one performance, Caesar paraphrased. ``Sid said, 
`Well, it was just a situation,''' Simon said. ``There was no laugh. 
I went backstage, and Sid asked why he didn't get a laugh on the line. 
I said, `Because you said situation, not suggestion.' And he said, 
`What's the difference?' Knowing Sid, I knew it was time to leave, 
and I said good night. And the next day Sid realized what he had done.'' 
But once, when Simon was in the dressing room with Caesar, Feuer came 
in and didn't know when to say good night. ``Sid didn't take direction 
very readily,'' Simon said. ``In the theater, you have notes _ and 
you give the notes. With Sid, you have to give the notes very carefully, 
because Sid could be a sleeping giant. Cy said to him one night, `It 
was a very good show tonight, Sid, but I thought it was a little slow.' 
And Sid said, `Slow?' I could see from the look on his face that he 
didn't take kindly to it. `Well,' he said, `I can make it faster. 
You want to do the 12-minute version tomorrow night? Or you could 
do a faster version where the audience just buys the tickets and goes 
right home. Would that be faster?' Cy knew he had stumbled into something 
and left. But Sid went back to his hotel room with his manager, and 
he was still mumbling about it. He was very angry. He went to the 
bathroom, put his hands on the sink and pulled it out of the wall. 
And he said to his manager, `(italics)Now(end italics) is it fast 
enough?''' Recalling the incident recently, Caesar still seemed bothered 
by it. ``I was trying to find the rhythms for the show,'' he said. 
``Cy Feuer asked if it could move a little faster. But rehearsing 
a show and performing it in front of an audience are two different 
things. Things that go well in rehearsal don't always work onstage. 
And to be concerned about fine details, like it wasn't up to tempo, 
at such an early stage was at the very least distracting. I hadn't 
worked it out yet. That's what out of town is for. I didn't realize 
it, but I was furious. Everybody wants things fixed immediately, and 
timing is something you can't fix immediately. Timing is trial and 
error. So I got mad. And I think I cut my hand.'' In those years _ 
in fact for 20 years _ Caesar had a severe drinking problem. The drinking 
would be done after a performance. ``Doing `Your Show of Shows,' an 
hour and a half, live every week, 39 weeks a year, with no laugh track, 
no Teleprompters, you've got to know it,'' Caesar said. ``And it was 
kind of hard to go to sleep. You're always thinking, maybe I'll do 
it this way, maybe I'll do it that way. If I got drunk I could sleep.'' 
Another tense moment out of town, involving the kind of desperate 
seriousness that can occur around opening a show and that seems funny 
only later, came when Ms. Leigh, the lyricist, abruptly brought a 
police officer into the theater. A song-and-dance number staged by 
Fosse about the women sent to entertain the troops in World War I 
wasn't working. ``The audience just didn't care for it,'' Simon said. 
``We gave it three nights. Fosse said there was nothing else he could 
do, and I knew that when Bob said he couldn't fix something it was 
unfixable. So Cy Feuer said, `We're cutting that number tonight.' 
Cy Coleman took it well, but Carolyn didn't want anyone to cut her 
song and started blaming Fosse for not choreographing it right. But 
the number came out, and as the show started, she came in with a policeman.'' 
Ms. Leigh had run ``three long, dark, dreary and quite dangerous blocks 
to city hall and got a traffic cop,'' Coleman said. ``When she came 
in with him, she wanted Feuer and Martin arrested, and Fosse arrested, 
and Neil Simon arrested. I think she still had some need for me so 
I guess I was on probation.'' She told the police officer that they 
were ``violating her rights under the Dramatists Guild agreement,'' 
Feuer said. ``And the policeman says, `Why is it I'm arresting them?' 
'' Simon recalled. ``And she said, `Because they cut my number out 
of the show.' The officer didn't quite know what to do, so he asked 
if he could watch the show. Afterward, he came over to us and said, 
`Looks pretty good to me.' And he left. And that was the end of it.'' 
Behind the tears and laughter of trying out a Broadway musical there 
is always the same nagging question: Will it work in New York? With 
``Little Me,'' the creators were uncertain. ``I remember Cy Feuer 
walking down the street with me,'' Simon said, ``and saying, `I don't 
know if we have an enormous hit or an enormous flop.' He said it could 
go either way. You just couldn't tell.'' On opening night, Nov. 17, 
1962, the critics also gave mixed notices, though almost all praised 
Caesar. Time magazine called ``Little Me'' ``rampagingly funny.'' 
John Chapman of The Daily News wrote that it was ``inventive, funny, 
attractive and expertly staged'' but that it had ``little of any sentimental 
worth.'' And Howard Taubman in The New York Times, while remarking 
that the musical ``gleams with show-business savvy,'' said that in 
the end it was a ``flimsy contrivance'' that ``plods as much as it 
romps.'' Audiences, however, seemed to enjoy it, and the show was 
nominated for 10 Tony Awards. But it was the year of ``A Funny Thing 
Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' and ``Little Me'' wound up winning 
just one Tony _ for Fosse's choreography. The show also fell victim 
to a 114-day newspaper strike that began three weeks after opening 
night. ``It's hard to function without advertising and without publicity,'' 
Caesar said. ``We carried on for almost a year, but the strike really 
hurt.'' In the end, there were 257 performances of ``Little Me,'' 
a respectable run in those days, but also a disappointing one. ``Some 
of the critics were baffled by it,'' Simon remembered. ``It was an 
out and out comedy _ with a score. We broke the mold and did something 
daring.''
