Several contestants took part in the annual Couch Potato Marathon 
in Pennsylvania in order to raise money for a local shelter for homeless 
people. The participants collected pledges for each of the 42 kilometers 
they would not run. Instead, the non athletes spent their time sitting 
on couches in front of a big screen television which played a videotape 
of the course. The television showed the marathon course with a red 
arrow pointing to the center of the screen with the displayed message, 
you are not here, true couch potato mentality. And that is sports, 
I am Park Brewer.
