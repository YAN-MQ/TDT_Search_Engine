The U.S. Safety Group says accidental deaths in the United States 
were down slightly last year, compared to 1996, after four previous 
years of increases. The National Safety Council said Monday 93,800 
Americans were killed by car crashes, fires, falls, and poisonings. 
That is a decrease by 100 from the previous year. They said accidental 
injuries continue to be the fifth leading cause of death overall. 
Exceeded only by serious health disorders such as heart attack and 
cancer.
