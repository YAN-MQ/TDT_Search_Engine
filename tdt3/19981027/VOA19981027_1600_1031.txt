This is VOA News Now. I am Susan Yackie, along with Tom Crosby, coming 
to you from Washington. It is 21 hours, 18 minutes universal time. 
Here is the top news story we are following at this hour. NATO ambassadors 
decide against immediate military action in the Kosovo crisis. But 
will maintain the threat of air strikes. We will have more on that 
story a little later.
