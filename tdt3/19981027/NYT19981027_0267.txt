In the moral universe, especially the one that postdates the Holocaust, 
remembering is almost always enlisted on the side of good, and forgetting 
on the side of bad. But in a symposium that ended Tuesday titled ``The 
Claims of Memory,'' held at Boston University over the last few days 
to celebrate Elie Wiesel's 70th birthday, it was memory's difficult 
skirmishes _ battles where it has clashed with artistic freedom, morality, 
fact, writing and sanity _ that were evoked. Even Wiesel, whose writing 
is all about memory, conceded that there may be ``too many memories.'' 
He added that if he remembered everything he would not be here but 
rather ``in an institution.'' In the face of so much opposition, memory 
must fight for survival. Cynthia Ozick, the novelist and critic, addressed 
the threat of literature, particularly the historical novel, poses 
to memory. ``The aims of the imagination,'' she said, ``are not the 
aims of history.'' So how can one object to a novel that distorts 
events? She made an example of William Styron's novel ``Sophie's Choice.'' 
The problem? The vast majority of the victims of the Holocaust were 
Jews, but ``Sophie's Choice'' is about a Polish Catholic victim. So 
what? ``Why must a writer's character be representative of the statistical 
norm?'' she asked. No reason, she answered _ unless it is the novelist's 
intention to ``put flesh on history.'' The term ``historical novel'' 
she said, is an oxymoron. Since Sophie's story stands in for history, 
``the rights of history can begin to urge their own force'' over the 
rights of the imagination. Ms. Ozick raised the same problem with 
``The Reader,'' a novel by Bernhard Schlink whose narrator belongs 
to the second generation of Germans born after the Holocaust. The 
novel involves an illiterate woman who, because she could not read 
an advertisement for a factory job, ended up instead as an SS guard. 
The woman's illiteracy is used, Ms. Ozick said, to exculpate her. 
Furthermore, she said, this woman is an anomaly: after all, most Germans 
in power were far from illiterate. An anomaly like this, Ms. Ozick 
said, ``sweeps away memory.'' She cannot be excused, even in the name 
of literary freedom. Memory must be preserved because it may be the 
only redress for the victims. ``It comes out of seeming nowhere from 
the country of the dead,'' Ariel Dorfman said, ``and bites back'' 
at the villains who think they can erase history. But what happens 
when villains keep the memories? Dorfman, a novelist, poet and journalist, 
recalled District 6, a multiracial, multireligious neighborhood in 
Cape Town that was so offensive to the officials upholding apartheid 
that they bulldozed it. There was nothing left but barren fields and 
a few churches (which the government always spared). But once Nelson 
Mandela came to power, said Dorfman, a museum was built on the site 
of District 6, which included the street signs from the neighborhood. 
How did they survive? The foreman of the wrecking crew had taken the 
signs home and saved them. The man who razed the neighborhood knew, 
Dorfman concluded, that ``he was destroying something sacred,'' and 
that, he added, stirred him enough to ``become the guardian of that 
space.'' This reminds us that memories are kept not only by the victims 
but also by the persecutors. Even villains seem to know that ``there 
must be a space where memories can resonate.'' And even victims can 
turn on their own memories. Novelist Aharon Appelfeld recalled his 
erasure of memory and its eventual retrieval. At the beginning of 
the war, he said, he tried to preserve the details of his home, to 
imagine each room, each corner, separately. But during the war, ``we 
tried to forget we came from Jewish homes.'' He changed his appearance 
so he wouldn't look Jewish. ``I washed my tongue so that Jewish words 
should not slip from my mouth.'' He added, ``Memory was our enemy.'' 
At age 8, he was taken to a concentration camp, then escaped. After 
the war, he found himself in a refugee, or liberation, camp. But the 
atmosphere was oppressive. After days of ``quarrels over every inch 
of space,'' he escaped once more, with a few others. Then memory came 
back to him unexpectedly. It was nature _ ``contact with the trees 
in the forest, with the moist earth, the straw'' _ that brought him 
to his senses and returned memory to him. He described it as a religious 
awakening. ``For the first time, we felt that we were individuals 
_ bereft individuals, but people who had not lost their humanity,'' 
he said. When memory came back to us, it was ``like reattaching to 
your body organs which were cut off.'' His parents and grandparents 
spoke to him in ``a long and colorful dream.'' It was only when memory 
was no longer a danger to survival, nor occluded by the hopeful clamor 
of the liberation camp, that it resurfaced. ``Weeks of seclusion redeemed 
us from our forgetfulness,'' he said. One might assume that memory 
has a solid ally in memoir, but some of the speakers were doubtful. 
Shlomo Breznitz, a psychology professor at the New School University 
in Manhattan, who studies stress, spoke about writing ``Memory Fields,'' 
his memoir of being placed in an orphanage with his sister when his 
parents were taken to Auschwitz. ``We were hungry, but we were not 
starving,'' he recalled. ``We were cold, but we were not freezing. 
We were alone, but we still had hope that our parents would come back. 
Nothing at all compared with with the big drama and the tragedies.'' 
Still, he said, he needed a half century of reflection before he could 
write. And even with a long delay, there was a cost to telling the 
story _ a cost to memory itself. After telling the story, he said, 
``I remember the way I told it, not the way it happened. It is something 
which has a beginning, a middle and an end. The original is covered 
hopelessly by the reproduction. Once we write it, it is frozen forever.'' 
As a 12-year-old, he once crossed his legs right over left rather 
than left over right and dared God to do something about it. Soon 
after, his mother told him she was going to die. She went to the hospital. 
He told God that if his mother lived, he'd give his life to Christ. 
When his mother came back from the hospital, Gates started going to 
church. So, after writing his memoir decades later, he finally figured 
out why he joined the church as a boy. Gates thinks that memoirs not 
only free personal secrets but family and race secrets too. In the 
business of testifying, he does not think there should be any rules 
or limitations. ``Bill Styron wrote about Nat Turner,'' and that's 
fine, he said. A former speechwriter for Alabama Gov. George Wallace 
wrote ``The Education of Little Tree'' pretending to be a Cherokee. 
And that, to Gates, is remarkable. ``I love the confusion of forms, 
the blurring of boundaries,'' he said. ``I love the fact that people 
can't tell whether some 18th-century work is a memoir or a novel.'' 
Some do not love such confusion. Susan Suleiman, the chairwoman of 
the Romance language and literature department at Harvard University 
and the author of a memoir, ``Budapest Diary: In Search of the Motherbook,'' 
spoke about the ``institutional boundary'' between fiction and nonfiction. 
It is notable, she said, that it can really only be violated in one 
direction: ``If a memoir is felt to be fraudulent, there are shock 
waves,'' especially if the events described are traumatic. If a novel 
turns out to be a memoir, she said, people don't care as much. ``I 
don't think there should be limits on what one can do with the Holocaust'' 
in literature, she said. But, she added, ``I think the category of 
memoir implies a kind of contract.'' And so memory battled on through 
the symposium, with Wiesel's recurring message as its best ally: ``Memories, 
even painful memories, are all we have. In fact, they are the only 
thing we are. So we must take very good care of them.''
