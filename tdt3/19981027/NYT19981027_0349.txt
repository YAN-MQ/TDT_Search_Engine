Bracing his nation for a package of austerity measures that are generally 
seen as a first step to restoring Brazil's standing in world markets, 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso pledged Tuesday night to cut $7 
billion in spending from the deficit-ridden federal budget next year. 
Coming after weeks of delays while Brazilians voted for a president, 
Congress and governors in two rounds of elections this month, the 
speech signals the end of a dangerous waiting game with international 
investors, who will now take the measure of the government's ability 
to deliver on a politically sensitive reorganization. In a six-minute 
televised speech the re-elected president did not provide firm details 
on how the cuts would be achieved or specify how states and municipalities 
would cut spending and raise revenues. He did say, however, that tax 
increases would form an important part of the effort to balance accounts. 
``It is an unprecedented cut,'' Cardoso said. ``It makes clear the 
government's determination to reach fiscal equilibrium in the shortest 
possible time.'' Cardoso said that shrinking the budget by any more 
than $7 billion ``would paralyze the essential activities of the state.'' 
On Wednesday morning Cardoso is to announce the austerity measures 
in a closed-door meeting with Congressional leaders from his governing 
coalition. Hours later, Finance Minister Pedro Malan is scheduled 
to announce publicly the spending cuts, tax increases and state and 
local efforts in a campaign to save $65 billion over three years. 
Brazil has been under enormous pressure, ever since the collapse of 
Russia's economy last August, to show investors and financial institutions 
how it will reduce its chronic budget deficit, which, at more than 
$55 billion, is running at 7 percent of the gross national product. 
Brazilian officials are seeking a stand-by loan from the International 
Monetary Fund and other sources that will likely total $30 billion 
or more. To secure the loan, the government must demonstrate how it 
will raise about $20 billion in revenues next year. The lack of confidence 
spells shockingly higher interest rates on government debt. Before 
the Russian collapse, official government figures projected Brazil 
would have to refinance $138 billion in debt next year; now, it is 
expecting to roll over $333 billion. Domestically, the government 
fought the August crisis by jacking up interbank loan rates to more 
than 40 percent to protect the currency. Consumer lending rates of 
over 100 percent slammed the economy into an instant recession that 
is not expected to end before 2000. ``There is nothing worse for the 
country than the interest rates that have been in effect since the 
international crisis began,'' Cardoso said Tuesday night. ``They hurt 
production and public accounts.'' ``The measures that we are proposing 
are meant to put an end to the beating we are taking from high interest 
rates,'' the president said. It was not clear Tuesday night how much 
of the remaining $14 billion in savings would depend on cooperation 
from state and local governments. David Fleischer, a political scientist 
at the Federal University of Brasilia, said he expected the burden 
would be divided evenly between federal tax increases, and state and 
local government spending cuts and tax hikes. Such a division implicitly 
relies upon the cooperation of state and local governments, which 
is far from certain after gubernatorial elections last Sunday. Cardoso's 
party lost governorships in Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. His endorsement 
of political allies may have boosted an important ally, Mario Covas, 
to victory in Sao Paulo, but it also forged a deep split within the 
Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which forms part of Cardoso's 
governing coalition. In the federal district, which includes the capital 
of Brasilia, newly elected Gov. Joaquim Roriz has already promised 
state employees a salary boost of 28 percent.
