Still ahead -- NBC news "in depth." When it comes time to retire, 
why are so many women coming up short? I wouldn't begrudge staying 
home with my children, but I'm paying the price now. What women need 
to know now about planning for their financial future. And John Glenn's 
first flight into space. How those three orbits around the globe inspired 
the young man who spent months on board the "Mir." And where were 
you that historic day in 1962, when John Glenn took his first ride 
into space? All this week we're asking Americans what that first launch 
meant to them. Here was this courageous individual, going out there, 
boldly going where no american had gone before, if you will. And to 
be sharing that, at that moment, on TV, was really both heart-stopping 
and an exhilarating experience. When they said the world didn't need 
another nose strip we said, "oh, yeah?" How about making one that's 
contoured, for a good fit giving it a centering bump so you know where 
to place it and using a skin-friendly adhesive? Introducing ClearPassage 
an ergonomically advanced nose strip designed to relieve the symptoms 
of nasal congestion. Oh, and one last thing-- how about having it 
made by the maker of Afrin nasal spray the people who know more about 
the nose than anyone? New ClearPassage. The truck is here. Introducing 
the new Silverado... it's bigger. It's more powerful. It's the truck 
from Chevrolet. Like a rock oh, like a rock. he's worked almost 40 
years. She's worked almost 40 years. And during that time they've 
gone on walks together instead of cruises. And shared secrets together 
instead of champagne. Just so that someday they could retire and be 
together all the time. At Cigna we care about the retirement dreams 
of over five million people. After all, they're our dreams, too. Cigna.
