Two New York City firefighters have been fired for wearing blackface 
on a Labor day parade float. One of the off-duty firefighters also 
acted out the dragging death of a Black man in Texas earlier this 
year. The firemen say they were just poking fun of the racist views 
of their predominantly white neighborhood. But the fire commissioner 
was not amused and fired them. I think he's making the right decision. 
The acts that they engaged in, basically say that they do not understand 
what it means to be a uniformed service member of New York City. If 
you wear the uniform of the city of New York, you have to display 
respect for all of the different groups in the city. The firefighters 
are suing, saying their first amendment rights were violated. Mayor 
Giuliani says he will not reinstate the firemen unless the U.S. Supreme 
Court orders him to do so.
