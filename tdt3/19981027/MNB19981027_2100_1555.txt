John Glenn's ship tonight providing a national weather service of 
sorts. These pictures from the shuttle discovery passing over tropical 
storm Mitch, what's left of it swirling hundreds of miles to the west 
of here. The storm which was downgraded from a hurricane this afternoon 
caused flooding in southern Mexico today, winds gusting from 60 down 
from 150 on Tuesday. The storm has claimed 32 lives at least. A yacht 
now with 31 passengers aboard reported missing off the Honduran coast.
