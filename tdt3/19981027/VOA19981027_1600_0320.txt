Britain has advised its citizens to avoid all nonessential travel 
to Chile due to volatile conditions following the London arrest of 
former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinocet. Mr. Pinocet is under guard 
in a London hospital. A Spanish judge requested the arrest and extradition 
of the 82 year-old ex dictator to stand trial on charges of genocide. 
A London court is to rule on the legality.
