The New York Times says in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 28: New 
York voters have traditionally elected governors and state comptrollers 
from different parties. That may be an accident of history, or an 
instinctive feeling that the comptroller ought to be a watchdog over 
the state's fiscal health who is not politically beholden to the chief 
executive. This year, at least, we believe the precedent is worth 
following. We have endorsed the re-election of the Republican governor, 
George Pataki, and now recommend that Carl McCall, a Democrat, be 
re-elected as comptroller. The comptroller's most important job is 
managing and investing the assets of pension programs for state and 
local government employees. McCall demonstrates a judicious mix of 
concern for the security of the portfolio and the social implications 
of the system's investments. We certainly prefer his approach to that 
of the Republican candidate, Bruce Blakeman, whose advocacy of reduced 
municipal contributions to the system and increased pension benefits 
seems irresponsible. McCall has also been energetic in carrying out 
his responsibilities to audit city and town agencies, and has frequently 
called attention to the growth of debt and other potential dangers 
in the state's fiscal picture. But one blot on his record is his practice 
of soliciting campaign donations from companies that do business with 
his office. This is the same behavior we have criticized Pataki for, 
and the fact that the abuse is bipartisan does not make it more desirable. 
Blakeman has said that if he is elected he will limit the size of 
these contributions, and McCall has said he will call on the state 
legislature to ban them for all officeholders. Neither approach is 
sufficient. The comptroller should simply not compromise his independence 
by taking contributions from people who are hoping to get business 
from his office. We will never be fully satisfied with McCall until 
he changes his practices. But Blakeman, who is running his campaign 
firmly tied to Governor Pataki's coattails, does not seem likely to 
be an improvement. On the basis of the rest of his performance, we 
endorse McCall.
