I am Bill Hazzard, VOA News. NATO ambassadors are meeting today in 
Brussels to determine is Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, if 
fully complying with UN demands to reduce his forces in Kosovo province. 
VOA correspondent, Lori Kaspen, reports. Serb forces are on the move 
in Kosovo, heading out of the province or back to their barracks. 
The advanced team of NATO-approved verifiers is watching their every 
move. The pullout is supposed to be completed by NATO's evening deadline, 
or else. NATO has threatened air strikes if President Milosevic does 
not fully comply with United Nations' demands to withdraw his Special 
Forces from Kosovo. The deadline was already extended once before. 
NATO's top military commanders were in Belgrade last weekend to keep 
up the pressure. The question now is whether the Yugoslav leader has 
done enough to satisfy NATO members he is serious about compliance. 
NATO ambassadors meet later in the day to make that assessment. Lori 
Kaspen, VOA News, Belgrade.
