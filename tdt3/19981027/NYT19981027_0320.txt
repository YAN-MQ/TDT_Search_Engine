Stock prices slumped after a strong opening Tuesday, but traders said 
profit-taking rather than a shift in sentiment was most likely the 
cause. Early in the session, the Dow Jones industrial average was 
up more than 100 points, and other broad market averages, including 
the Russell 2000 index of small companies, were also higher. But then 
rumors about a possible Brazilian currency devaluation and the health 
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin filtered into the market. Those 
rumors helped push down bank stock prices, and the selling pressure 
spread from there. Some money managers said that a government report 
showing a sharp drop in consumer confidence was another source of 
concern Tuesday. ``There is no real reason for the market to have 
a reversal other than the normal to-ing and fro-ing in a trading range 
I think has a downside of 8,000 for the Dow and an upside of 8,600,'' 
said Bill Allyn, the head of listed trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co. 
``What we are seeing is just routine trading, and institutions seem 
to be sitting pretty much on their hands, in no rush to get in or 
to get out.'' By the close of trading, the Dow had lost 66.17 points, 
or 0.8 percent, and finished at 8,366.04. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500-stock index fell 6.98, or 0.7 percent, to 1,065.34. The Nasdaq 
composite index, which rallied strongly Monday, dipped 7.35, or 0.4 
percent, to 1,717.63. And the Russell 2000 index, which had advanced 
for nine straight sessions, slipped 0.57 point, or 0.2 percent, to 
371.50. More than 764 million shares were traded on the New York Stock 
Exchange, a big jump from Monday, when volume was hampered by a computer 
glitch that forced the Big Board to call a halt to trading for nearly 
an hour. ``One reason the market is stalling is that there are ongoing 
concerns about the impact of the global financial crisis,'' on stocks, 
said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
``The market has moved up, and everybody is feeling good about that,'' 
he said. ``Economically sensitive sector stocks are performing well, 
and the performance of small-cap stocks is a very good sign. But everyone 
recognizes that a very significant financial crisis is still ongoing.'' 
Rumors about a possible devaluation of Brazil's currency, the real, 
have circulated in the past, but a scheduled address late Tuesday 
by Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was a fresh cause 
for concern. Cardoso was expected to outline deficit cuts in his speech, 
and some investors speculated the austerity plan might include a devaluation 
of the currency, which would make it more difficult for Brazilian 
companies to repay loans in dollars and would pare the value of Brazilian 
securities held by banks. In a six-minute broadcast to the nation 
after the market had closed, Cardoso said the government would propose 
a package of spending cuts and tax increases designed to narrow its 
$60 billion budget deficit but provided few details. Brazilian Finance 
Minister Pedro Malan is expected to do so Tuesday. News that Yeltsin 
had entered a health resort outside Moscow for two weeks of treatment 
on the advice of his doctors was another source of concern for bank 
stocks. Those sorts of worries led to a sharp drop in J.P. Morgan 
and Citigroup, two Dow stocks. And it pushed down prices of other 
money-center bank stocks. Morgan fell 3 9/16 Tuesday, to 89|. Citigroup 
dropped 2}, to 43 9/16. And Chase Manhattan, another bank with a big 
exposure to Brazil, declined 2{, to 52. Brokerage stocks were also 
under pressure. Merrill Lynch fell 3 9/16, to 51]. And Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter lost 1{, to 58 1/16. Dan Eagan, a managing director at 
Blackrock Funds, said he was not concerned about renewed weakness 
in financial service company stocks. ``What we saw in the bank and 
brokerage stocks was profit taking,'' he said. ``At the moment, this 
market will trade as much on psychology as it will on fundamentals.'' 
Prices of several computer company stocks gained ground even as investors 
took profits from the high-technology group. IBM rose 1 5/16, to 144], 
after the company said it would buy back as much as $3.5 billion of 
its stock. In the session, the stock hit a new high of 146 13/16. 
Parametric Technology also posted an impressive advance, gaining 1 
5/16, to 15{. Internet stocks also had a hectic day. Hopes for a strong 
earnings report from America Online helped to push the stock up 1, 
to 122; after the market closed, the company said its profit beat 
expectations. Ebay, an Internet auction company, extended its amazing 
rally, gaining 9[, to 82{. That gain followed a 23-point advance Monday. 
But Yahoo fell 4 3/16, to 123}.
