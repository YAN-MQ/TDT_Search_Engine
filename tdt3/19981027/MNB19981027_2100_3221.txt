When we return, we'll look at what's making news in some of the other 
major papers across the country and a final look at what unfolded 
here today on pad 39 B. In the global economy companies can't afford 
to shut down. So America's largest generator of electricity never 
rests. Southern company uses its resources to track the availability 
of oil, gas and electricity 24 hours a day. We keep our customers 
up and running while saving them millions. So at the end of the day 
they know we're still at work keeping the power on. We are southern 
company. Energy to serve your world. If you asked all the dermatologists 
listed here to recommend a therapeutic shampoo, neutrogena T/Gel would 
come out #1. T/Gel works on all three... itchy, flaky scalp conditions. 
Neutrogena T/Gel: Front pages, we're told, by our canvass tonight, 
tomorrow morning's front paged dominated by the story that played 
out here about 3 1/2 miles on launch pad 39-B, John Glenn going back 
into space. But this is interesting, "U.S.A. today" speaks to the 
very fact that we're joining you live from the Kennedy space center 
tonight, and the story says, in effect, by sending John Glenn into 
space, NASA was hoping for a public relations plus. It seems they 
got it, succeeding beyond their wildest dreams with today's coverage. 
The big question is can they maintain high levels of public interest 
after John Glenn is back on earth? "Washington Post" talks about California 
and what a difference a few days can make. If this story if current 
drends -- if the current polling numbers hold up, it appears Barbara 
boxer is now leading her challenger Matt fonk. It appears the democratic 
candidate, gray Davis, lieutenant governor is holding a strong lead 
over Dan lund grin, the republican. We shall see if the democratic 
party's hopes and dreams come true election night. And the F.D.A., 
thanks to the "Denver post" reporting they have approved Tamoxifen 
for high-risk women in the treatment of breast cancer. That is our 
broadcast for this Thursday, a day when history was made here. Tonight 
John Glenn in earth orbit again, just 36 years between trips. In the 
first minutes of the mission he exceeded the other bits of his first 
mission. The world was, indeed, watching what happened here today. 
And before we leave you tonight, here now some of what they saw and 
heard, what they came for as the mission known here as STS-95 became 
an orbiting reality. I'm Brian Williams reporting from the Kennedy 
space center, cape Canaveral, Florida. For all of us here, good night, 
everybody.
