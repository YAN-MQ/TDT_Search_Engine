From the Russian space program, a Russian craft carrying several tons 
of food, water, fuel, and other supplies has docked with the Mier 
space station. Mission Control says the two cosmonauts aboard Mier 
reported a smooth docking and are ready to unload the Progress supply 
ship. Besides supplies the cargo ship is carrying a meteorite monitor, 
which the cosmonauts must hold during a space walk early next month. 
The monitor will be used to collect data when Mier flies through a 
meteorite shower in mid-November. The Progress spacecraft is also 
delivering a giant experimental space mirror measuring about 30 meters 
in diameter, that is to be uncurled in February. What is it going 
to be used for? Well, it is designed to test whether sunlight can 
be reflected towards Northern Russia during long winter nights.
