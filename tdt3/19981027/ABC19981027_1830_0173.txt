It is as we said, very unusual for a hurricane to reach the level 
of category 5. hurricane Mitch is already being blamed for the deaths 
of at least ten people. Here's ABC's Bill Blakemore. It's formed eye. 
A beautiful clear eye like this tells us that all the physical processes 
that make an intense hurricane are working properly. Scientists have 
rarely seen a hurricane stay so powerful for so long, and never so 
late in the year. There's never been a storm this intense in October 
in the atlantic. Scientists suspect Mitch grew so powerful partly 
because it passed over the western Caribbean, water there has remained 
warm late into the year. The warm water makes the wind warmer, so 
it rises more quickly up into the eye of the hurricane making it stronger 
and stronger. Mitch is advancing slowly enough to get maximum heat 
from each patch of ocean before moving on. Today, scientists saw a 
second, outer eye wall forming, which prevented some of the heat from 
getting to the inner eye, and thus weakened the hurricane. But not 
by much. With the outer eye wall forming, it looks like it's going 
to be on a Weakening trend but it's still going to be a very serious 
hurricane. As a category 4, it's still at least as bad as Andrew, 
which did $25 billion damage in Florida in 1992. What frightens hurricane 
scientists most is that they still don't know how to predict when 
a hurricane might suddenly strengthen again, as Mitch has already 
done once. This was a classic case of rapid intensification. If this 
were happening off the coast of Texas, we'd be looking at a major 
disaster for the U.S. It will be at least two days before they know 
if Mitch will head north toward the U.S. Bill Blakemore, ABC News.
