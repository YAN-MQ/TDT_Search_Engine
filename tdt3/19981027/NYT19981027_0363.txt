The question raised in the full-page ad from the Anti-Defamation League 
in Sunday's New York Times was plaintive: ``Is there no moral responsibility 
at NBC News anymore?'' What prompted the ad _ an open letter to NBC's 
president, Bob Wright _ was Louis Farrakhan's appearance on ``Meet 
the Press'' the previous Sunday. Under the cover of the flimsiest 
of news pegs _ the otherwise unremarked third anniversary of the Million 
Man March _ Farrakhan had been invited on air to give his opinion 
of ``the president's moral behavior and his possible impeachment.'' 
The leader of the Nation of Islam did have a unique perspective on 
this issue: He saw Monica Lewinsky as a possible Zionist plot to skew 
the Mideast peace negotiations. But ludicrous and bigoted as his comments 
were, it would be unfair to accuse NBC of pushing any ideological 
agenda. No, the only agenda here was entertainment, and Farrakhan 
is far more diverting, particularly if you're not Jewish, than a sobersides 
like Orrin Hatch. Farrakhan was, in his freak-show way, the perfect 
bookend to Matt Drudge _ the equally entertaining and specious novelty 
act for which ``Meet the Press'' took heat way back at the dawn of 
Monicagate. Welcome to the ``New News'' _ as it has been appropriately 
christened by Marvin Kalb, in a paper just published by the Shorenstein 
Center on Press and Politics at Harvard. While the extent of Monicagate's 
stain on our civic institutions is not yet fully known, its effect 
on our culture is already profound. The 10-month saga has solidified 
for good a 20-year trend in which the media _ especially the electronic 
media, by which the vast majority of Americans get the news _ have 
steadily replaced journalistic standards with those of show business. 
Crowding out the old ideals of public service and truth-seeking are 
the imperatives of star performances, suspenseful plot twists, sex, 
celebrity and box-office profit. Monicagate didn't create this culture. 
The gulf war, O.J. and the death of Princess Di were all dry runs 
for the premise that news could be produced as long-form entertainment 
in the style of nonfiction mini-series like ``Roots'' (and at far 
lower cost). But Monicagate was the first of these real-life dramas 
to arrive on a media field that had expanded to include three competing 
24-hour cable news channels and a full-throttle Internet. Just as 
crucially, it arrived after all three major networks and CNN had been 
swallowed up by media giants, some of them (Disney, Time Warner) show 
biz incarnate. Now there's no turning back. As the old journalistic 
rules don't apply in the ``New News,'' so the old journalistic yardsticks 
for critiquing it are outdated. Last week, for instance, the Committee 
of Concerned Journalists released a much-heralded report tracking 
the factual accuracy (or lack of same) of the reportage on such Monicagate 
scoops as the dress, the cigar, the ``second intern'' and the authorship 
of the talking points. Good or bad, that accuracy record _ the historic 
criterion for journalistic quality _ is now almost beside the point. 
The real flavor of the Monica marathon could be found during the days 
and sometimes weeks when there was no news at all, and the story filled 
up endless hours anyway. The time was passed with show-biz stunts: 
new bit players, mindless speculation that became the journalistic 
equivalent of sideshows, and Emmy-caliber hyperventilation by star 
newscasters. Rather than count up factual errors to assess the excesses 
of this orgy, it would be more telling to add up the stories that, 
like the pope's visit to Cuba, were dumped or ignored for its duration. 
There should also be counts of the eyelifts performed on Monica talking 
heads (including moonlighting print journalists) since January, the 
number of creative network logos the ``crisis'' inspired, and the 
hours of Super-Bowl-style hype that preceded and followed every new 
twist of the plot (however inconsequential). This ``New News'' format 
will be with us long after Monicagate is history, and stories that 
don't fit it don't rate. Show-biz criteria now dictate not only how 
news is covered but what news is covered. Next in line for disproportionate 
mini-series treatment, accordingly, is John Glenn's flight _ provided 
that it doesn't go too smoothly to serve as cliffhanger entertainment, 
or that a younger and sexier star doesn't upstage him much as Monica 
did the pope.
