From his famous 1943 debut at the age of 25, when he filled in for 
Bruno Walter as conductor of the New York Philharmonic, to his death 
in 1990, Leonard Bernstein was rarely offstage, whether as conductor 
or composer, teacher or showman. Wednesday night's partly autobiographical 
and altogether affectionate ``American Masters'' tribute brings out 
the qualities that endeared him to generations of collaborators, students 
and audiences. ``Leonard Bernstein: Reaching for the Note'' covers 
a bustling career of popular acclaim and disappointment, critical 
praise and disdain, awe for the range of his talents and exasperation 
with his pretensions. But mostly it celebrates the irrepressible energy, 
exuberance and inventiveness that took fire with such collaborators 
as Jerome Robbins and Stephen Sondheim. If Wednesday night's two-hour 
program is most vibrant when delivering Broadway hits, that may be 
a comment on what came most naturally to the composer as well as on 
what plays best on television. But nothing is neglected. The opening 
hour has time for crowd pleasers like ``Fancy Free'' and ``On the 
Town,'' whose score excited Broadway, as the narrator describes it, 
with its ``edgy urban blend of concert hall and jazz club pulsating 
with wit and candid sexual energy''; a description of the flamboyant 
conducting style first exhibited at Tanglewood; the early symphonic 
works, in which admirers found evocations of Jewish tradition and 
the American West. And there are more personal matters, including 
his difficult relations with his father and the conflict, delicately 
noted here, between his homosexuality and his need for a close family 
life, which was provided by his wife, Felicia Montealegre. ``He wanted 
family,'' a friend says. ``He wanted a wife, he wanted good friends. 
He wanted the whole, the whole banana, and he got it.'' Particular 
attention is given to ``West Side Story,'' which most successfully 
joined Bernstein's feeling for the popular stage with his classical 
training as well as with the social concerns that would earn him some 
ridicule as the personification of ``radical chic.'' Sondheim, who 
contributed the lyrics to the sidewalk version of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' 
says he learned from Bernstein to take chances: ``If you're going 
to fall off the ladder, fall off a high rung.'' Bernstein seemed tireless. 
As the first American to lead a major orchestra, he proved immensely 
engaging, despite or because of the leaping and laughing and weeping 
that offended some critics of concert-hall taste. He brought new audiences 
to serious music on television, where his young people's concerts 
won high ratings. In his role of international maestro, he conducted 
in Israel during the 1948 war; performed Mahler with the Vienna Philharmonic; 
conducted his ``Mass'' at the opening of the Kennedy Center and Beethoven's 
Ninth at the Berlin wall. What he did less of as success struck was 
to compose. He said, ``I'm helplessly suspended between the creator 
in me and the performer.'' He was hurt, one friend notes, by the common 
judgment that ``he can write theater music but he can't do anything 
in the concert hall of any real worth.'' Toward the end of his life, 
he told a colleague that he wanted to be remembered not for ``West 
Side Story'' but as a serious composer. That may prove a vain hope, 
but Wednesday night's appreciation should help keep alive the heady 
range of his ambitions along with the abiding pleasures of his achievements.
