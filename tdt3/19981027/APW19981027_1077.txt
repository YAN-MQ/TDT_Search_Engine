BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO decided Tuesday to keep up the threat 
of air strikes against Serb forces for an unspecified but ``limit'' 
period, despite recognizing a substantial withdrawal of troops and 
police from Kosovo. A meeting of ambassadors from the 16-allied nations 
agreed to indefinitely extend the ``activation order'' which is keeping 
over 400 allied warplanes on alert for possible raids against the 
Serbs. ``We have instructed our military to remain prepared ... and 
maintain forces,'' said NATO Secretary General Javier Solana.
