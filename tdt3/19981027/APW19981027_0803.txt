As Serb troops redeployed in Kosovo to meet international demands, 
NATO ambassadors met to decide whether to lift or extend the threat 
of allied airstrikes beyond the deadline of 1900 GMT Tuesday. Reports 
from Kosovo suggested President Slobodan Milosevic had made a significant 
pullback of his military and police forces in the province to avert 
NATO intervention. But as NATO's policy-making North Atlantic Council 
started talks 2 1/2 hours ahead of the deadline, officials at alliance 
headquarters said it was unclear if Milosevic had done enough to get 
the airstrike threat lifted. Alliance officials said the Serb withdrawal 
made airstrikes very unlikely, but added that NATO was not expected 
to remove the threat completely. Instead, the council of ambassadors 
from the 16 NATO nations was seen either setting a new deadline for 
complete compliance, or extending indefinitely the ``activation order'' 
which is keeping some 400 allied warplanes on alert for possible raids 
against the Serbs. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a 
BBC interview that NATO should not yet drop its guard despite ``serious 
progress'' made by Milosevic toward meeting international demands. 
``He still has some way to go and it may well be wise for us to keep 
that threat hanging over him,'' Cook said. Convoys of tanks and trucks 
carrying Yugoslav troops and police pulled out of several parts of 
Kosovo Tuesday, indicating Milosevic had ordered compliance with international 
demands he reduce Serb forces in Kosovo to levels before the conflict 
with ethnic Albanian separatists flared February. In Washington, presidential 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Milosevic had withdrawn ``well over 90 
percent of the security force reinforcements.'' ``Thanks to NATO pressure 
and determination, very substantial steps have been taken toward compliance,'' 
Lockhard added. The private Yugoslav radio station B-92 quoted Serb 
sources as saying the withdrawal was complete and that government 
forces in Kosovo were back to pre-conflict levels. A representative 
of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army also confirmed the withdrawal, 
although he expressed concern about it's long-term impact. The NATO 
ambassadors were studying reports from international observers on 
the ground in Kosovo and NATO military, who are operating unarmed 
observer flights over the province as part of the Oct. 12 agreement 
between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. NATO sources said 
the ambassadors would likely wait until shortly before the deadline 
to declare whether Milosevic met the conditions.
