Time now for sports and here in the studio with us is VOA Sports Editor, 
Park Brewer. with big news in U.S. soccer, Park. That is right, Susan, 
what have been rumored for the last couple of months, is now official. 
Bruce Arena, the highly successful coach of Major League Soccer's 
D.C. United Club is the new head coach of the U.S. National Soccer 
team. His selection was made official at a news conference Tuesday 
in New York City where the U.S. Soccer Federation said Arena has signed 
a four-year contract which would take him through the 2002 World Cup. 
Arena is already thinking ahead to his debut November 6, when the 
U.S.A. plays Australia in a friendly match in San Jose, California. 
One mandate that we will expect out of national team players is that 
they are among the best players in MLS. Game in and game out. Week 
in and week out. If they wish to have a place on the men's national 
team. U.S. Soccer officials say Arena has already selected much of 
the team for his first match. Including young stand-outs like D.C. 
United mid-fielder, Ben Olsen, Chicago Fire forward, Josh Wolfe, and 
Fire goalkeeper, Zach Thorton. The 47 year-old Arena has coached U.S. 
major league soccer's D.C. United in all three years of its existence. 
Winning the MLS Cup in 1996 and 1997 and finishing as runner-up this 
season to the Chicago Fire. Before that, Arena was head coach at the 
University of Virginia where he won five U.S. Collegiate Soccer titles. 
He also coached the 1996 U.S. Olympic Soccer Team. Arena replaces 
Steve Sampson, who resigned in August after guiding the U.S. team 
to a last place finish at this year's World Cup in France.
