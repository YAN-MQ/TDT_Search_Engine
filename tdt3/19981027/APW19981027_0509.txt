Iran said Tuesday it will stage major military exercises on its border 
with Afghanistan next week, depite an easing of tensions with its 
neighbor. About 200,000 troops from the Iranian army, air force and 
navy will take part in the war games, the commander of ground forces, 
Brig. Gen. Abdolali Pourshasd, was quoted as saying by state-run Tehran 
radio. The naval drills will take place on Lake Hamoon, which lies 
on the border of Iran and Afghanistan. The maneuvers, code-named Zolfaqar, 
were set to start last month but have been postponed several times. 
No reason was given. Tensions rose sharply last month after the Taliban 
militia, which controls most of Afghanistan, admitted that its forces 
had killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in the northern 
city of Mazar-e-Sharif. But the situation improved this month after 
the intervention of U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who secured 
the release of 26 Iranians held captive in Afghanistan. Brahimi also 
procured a promise from the Taliban to hold face-to-face talks with 
Iran.
