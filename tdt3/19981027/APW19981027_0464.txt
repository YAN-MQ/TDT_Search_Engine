A bottle of 1951 Penfolds Grange Hermitage set a record for Australian 
wine when it sold for 20,460 Australian dollars (about U.S dlrs 12,600) 
at an auction Monday. The price of the rare red topped the previous 
record of 18,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 11,000) _ also for 
a 1951 Grange _ set earlier this year, said auctioneer Stewart Langton, 
from Langton's Fine Wine Auctions. Langton would not reveal the buyer 
of the wine. ``(The 1951 Grange) is a wine that's purchased for collection 
rather than drinking,'' Langton added. ``That's not to say this one 
won't be drunk, or that they're not, but most of them now are just 
things to collect. ``I've seen some '51s opened. I've seen one very, 
very good bottle, one pretty good bottle and the rest were very tired.'' 
Langton said he was continually surprised by the prices collectors 
paid for wines. ``It's a lot of money but I have to say it is a very 
great wine,'' he added. ``It was an excellent bottle of a very rare 
wine. Grange is now an Australian icon nationally and internationally 
and the '51 was the first of the breed so it's taken on historical 
significance.'' The bottle went to a mystery bidder at the Wine Australia 
Shiraz auction in Melbourne. Langton said it would remain in Australia 
as part of a set of Grange. Created by wine industry legend Max Schubert, 
the 1951 Grange was the first vintage of what has become Australia's 
most famous wine. With fewer than 100 bottles left in the world, the 
1951 is in hot demand because it was never released. The first commercial 
Grange was the 1952, which was released in 1955. Grange is Australia's 
top investment wine, with current releases selling for as much as 
Australian dlrs 400 (U.S. dlrs 250).
