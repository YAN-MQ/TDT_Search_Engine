Police in upstate New York are investigating the murder of Barnett 
slepian, a doctor who performed abortions. Susan Candiotti reports, 
slepian's family says it knows who is responsible. My brother's life 
should not have ended this way. Dr. slepian's family is convinced 
his death is the result of overzealous anti-abortion activists trying 
to intimidate other doctors. I feel there's a certain lunatic fringe 
in our society. And there has to be control, that's all. I -- I don't 
know how to control it. For now, authorities have five unsolved attacks 
on doctors who perform abortions in Canada and western New York. While 
deferring to the police investigating Dr. slepian's death, a Canadian/U.S. 
task force says there are striking similarities among the five attacks. 
CNN has learned the bullet that killed slepian has been recovered 
intact, an important piece of physical evidence compared to the bullet 
fragments found at other scenes. All are believed to involve high-powered 
rifles. There's some similarities in the terms of, you know, the rounds, 
where they could've come from. I don't think we've identified a particular 
rifle, or a particular type of rifle at this point. The doctor's widow 
and four sons have returned home, following monday's funeral, attend 
by hundreds. Mostly, I would hope that this country, you know, began 
to educate in how to use birth control so abortions weren't necessary. 
That's what my uncle always said. They downplay suggestions that police 
could have done more to prevent the attack after Mrs. slepian, a part-time 
police employee contacted them about a general alert from Canadian 
police hours before the sniper struck. My uncle felt that if someone 
was going to stalk you that there was little in the end you could 
do about it. After 20 years in practice, the end came Friday night. 
My brother cared about life and he was concerned about his patients 
and he's concerned about their rights. So if we don't forget, it won't 
be in vain. Susan Candiotti, CNN, Amherst, New York.
