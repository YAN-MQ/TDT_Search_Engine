For our report on the '98 vote this evening, how yesterday's violence 
can sometimes be today's politics. Dr. slepian was murdered on Friday. 
Today abortion is an even hotter issue in some important political 
contests. Here's ABC's John Cochran. Abortion rights activists believe 
the doctor's murder can mobilize opposition to anti-abortion candidates, 
such as New York senator al D'Amato. D'Amato voted against a 1994 
law making it a federal crime to use force to interfere with aborings. 
It gave federal agents the authority to investigate in such cases. 
Even though D'Amato touts himself as a crime fighter, he voted to 
deny law enforcement that added authority. He did not ensure that 
women and physicians and health care providers were protected. In 
a bizarre coincidence, two days before the murder, an abortion rights 
group produced a commercial about a woman who was badly injured in 
a Bombing at an abortion clinic. Now they plan to buy more air time 
to give it greater prominence. How could D'Amato vote against a law 
that protects women? D'Amato has deplored anti-abortion violence. 
Chuck Schumer believes the ads and the -- help emphasize -- also become 
pistal in other close races around the country, including California. 
When it comes to choice, fong is --. Wrong. Consultants and pollsters 
say at borgs issue may help democratic candidates ignite enthusiasm 
among supporters who until now have been April thetic. We have a whole 
new element. Energized pro-choice woman, it creates a whole new dynamic 
in this election. Democrats know this is a card they must play carefully. 
If voters think they are using a murder for political gain, it could 
backfire on them, John Cochran, ABC News, Washington.
