The New York Times will say in an editorial Wednesday, Oct. 28: The 
New York state Department of Health has concluded its investigation 
into the death of Shannell Coppage, a six-week-old girl who died of 
malnutrition because her young mother, Tatiana Cheeks, had failed 
to breast-feed her adequately. The investigation suggests that the 
hospital where Ms. Cheeks sought help blundered badly. Ms. Cheeks 
had taken the baby to an outpatient clinic of New York Methodist Hospital 
in Brooklyn for her one-week checkup after birth. But the baby was 
turned away because her mother did not have a Medicaid card for the 
child and could not pay $25. Under state regulations, hospitals must 
provide patients with generally accepted standards of care and are 
not allowed to discriminate based on the source of payment. The Brooklyn 
hospital failed on both counts. There was no need for a Medicaid card 
because infants are automatically covered for one year if their mothers 
are on Medicaid, as Ms. Cheeks was. State investigators concluded 
that this was an isolated case of incompetence at the hospital. The 
hospital has ordered its staff to undergo more training, but will 
face no other sanctions. After Shannell's death, Ms. Cheeks was jailed 
on charges of negligent homicide. The charges were dropped when pediatricians 
testified that many breast-feeding mothers cannot easily tell whether 
their babies are growing normally unless the infants are weighed and 
monitored regularly. Nursing support and education about breast-feeding 
might have alerted Ms. Cheeks to danger signs. Ms. Cheeks' other child, 
taken from her when she was arrested, remains in foster care with 
a relative. This family's life has been horribly altered, all for 
want of access to basic medical care that should be the birthright 
of every child.
