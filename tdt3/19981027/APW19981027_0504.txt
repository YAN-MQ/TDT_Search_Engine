Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat who defeated Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl in elections last month on promises to modernize Germany after 
16 years of conservative rule, was confirmed as Germany's seventh 
postwar chancellor Tuesday. Though the vote was expected, Schroeder 
clearly savored the moment, smiling slowly then standing to embrace 
Social Democratic party leader Oskar Lafontaine after the new parliament's 
president announced the results: 351 in favor, 287 against with 27 
abstentions. Schroeder acknowledged the vote, stating simply, ``I 
accept the election.'' Schroeder, 54, will lead Germany into the 21st 
century and through some critical changes, including the government's 
move to Berlin and the adoption of the single European currency to 
replace the German mark. He was to be sworn in later Tuesday. Parliament 
president Wolfgang Thierse wished Schroeder ``strength and much success 
for our country.'' Kohl, who was relieved of office Monday, waited 
until after the vote was confirmed to shake Schroeder's hand, showing 
no emotion as he turned away. Other members of Kohl's Cabinet followed 
his lead. The parliament later was to confirm Schroeder's Cabinet 
ministers, and he was to convene the first Cabinet meeting by evening. 
Schroeder and his coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens party, 
are pledging to put Germans back to work, make it easier for foreign 
residents to get citizenship and move toward shutting down nuclear 
power plants. Continuity is the byword in foreign policy. Welcoming 
Schroeder to office, President Roman Herzog stressed that Schroeder 
is under pressure to keep Germany competitive. ``Germany needs reforms 
... The world is not waiting for us,'' Herzog said. Schroeder's pro-market 
reputation helped him win ``New Center'' voters who previously mistrusted 
the left. But since his triumph in the Sept. 27 election, he has stressed 
his party's plans to strengthen the social welfare state, and his 
commitment to the free market was called into question after a computer 
entrepreneur he tapped as a Cabinet member backed out. Schroeder's 
defining feature has been his ability to project a broad appeal by 
refusing to be pinned down, promising simply a ``new beginning'' for 
Germany. Within days of announcing the new government's plans for 
a tax cut to relieve average earners, Schroeder responded to harsh 
criticism from German industry by saying he was open to changes in 
the formula. One of Schroeder's main challenges will be balancing 
his pro-business stands with the party's more traditional leftist 
social welfare roots. For now, Germans aren't sure, though, that Schroeder 
is really in charge. About 43 percent of 1,003 Germans questioned 
in a poll said they believe Social Democrat party leader Oskar Lafontaine, 
who also is the new finance minister, will be making decisions with 
Schroeder. Lafontaine, an old-style leftist, has been more enthusiastic 
about government intervention in the economy than Schroeder. But he 
has denied a power struggle and pledged to respect Schroeder's authority. 
``It's not my reputation to show too little authority in making decisions,'' 
Schroeder once remarked. The new government enjoys a 21-seat majority 
in the lower house, which is elected for four years. The Greens are 
governing Germany for the first time and will be running the foreign 
ministry, one of three Cabinet posts for the junior partner.
