Israel's Prime Minister has postponed a cabinet meeting that was to 
ratify the peace deal he signed with the Palestinians. The cabinet 
vote was scheduled for Thursday. But an Israeli spokesman says the 
cabinet session will be put off until the Palestinians submit their 
working plan for combating anti-Israeli violence. Meanwhile, tension 
continues to be high on the West Bank where Israeli troops are scheduled 
to resume withdrawals in a few weeks. In keeping with the agreements 
signed at the White House Friday. VOA's Al Pessin reports from Jerusalem. 
Israel has barred Israelis from entering the Palestinian territories 
following Monday's shooting death of an Israeli settler near the West 
Bank town of Hebron. The Palestinian police say two Palestinian assailants 
fled into their part of Hebron, were captured, and are being interrogated. 
The settlers' funeral Tuesday included emotional outbursts of anger 
toward the government for agreeing last week to hand over more West 
Bank land to Palestinian control. Security has been increased around 
Prime Minister, Netanyahu and senior ministers in his inner cabinet. 
Meanwhile, Palestinians in a West Bank village buried a farmer who 
was apparently killed by a settler on Monday. The Israeli police say 
they are seeking a suspect, but they discount reports the killing 
was done in revenge for the attack near Hebron. Al Pessin, VOA News, 
Jerusalem.
