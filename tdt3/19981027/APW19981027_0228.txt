Transport officials said Tuesday that negligence caused five wagons 
to break away from a train and collide with a bus in the Russian Far 
East, killing 24 people. The bus was split in half when the rail cars 
carrying concrete panels and other construction materials rammed into 
it at an unmanned railroad crossing in Khabarovsk, about 6,100 kilometers 
(3,800 miles) southeast of Moscow on Monday, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported. The wagons had broken off from a train that was standing 
idle about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away at a loading station. They 
accelerated down a hill to between 60-80 kmph (37-50 mph) by the time 
they hit the bus, ripping it in two and dragging one section for 200 
meters (660 feet). Police were investigating the engineer of the locomotive 
that had pulled the wagons. Someone did not secure them properly when 
the train was idle, officials said. The bus was carrying 50 passengers, 
including eight children between the ages of 11 and 14, ITAR-Tass 
said, quoting a duty officer at the Emergency Situations Ministry. 
Twenty-one people died instantly and three more died later in a hospital, 
ITAR-Tass said. The others received injuries of varying seriousness. 
The Interfax news agency said, however, that 49 people had been on 
the bus and 21 of them were killed.
