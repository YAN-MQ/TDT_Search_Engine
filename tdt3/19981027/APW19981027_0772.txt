Government forces scrambled Tuesday to meet a NATO deadline for pulling 
back in Kosovo, and hundreds of ethnic Albanians returned to their 
homes for the first time in months. Private radio station B-92 quoted 
Serb sources as saying the withdrawal was complete and that government 
forces in Kosovo were back to the level before Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian 
militants on Feb. 28. In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said Tuesday that reports from the field indicated Milosevic was in 
``substantial compliance'' with terms of the Kosovo peace agreement. 
``Well over 90 percent of the security force reinforcements'' have 
been withdrawn, major road blocks have been dismantled and heavy weapons 
have been returned to garrison, Lockhart said. ``As we see this substantial 
compliance, we also need to make sure that coming into compliance 
isn't the only issue. We need to send the message that he needs to 
stay in compliance.'' Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have 
been driven from their homes in fighting since Milosevic sent in troops 
to crack down on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians 
make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and most want independence. 
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. 
The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes unless 
Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels in place 
before the conflict began. NATO ambassadors were to meet Tuesday in 
Brussels, Belgium, prior to the 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) deadline for 
Milosevic to comply. In Belgrade, the special U.S. mediator for Kosovo, 
Christopher Hill, said reports from the field indicated ``substantial 
movement,'' but he stopped short of declaring the withdrawal complete. 
``There is an effort to reconfigure the security forces in a way that 
we truly hope will reduce the violence substantially,'' Hill said. 
``We also hope this ... moving around of forces, will help resolve 
the issue of the displaced ... people who are afraid to come back 
to their villages.'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, speaking 
in a BBC interview, warned NATO should not drop its guard despite 
``serious progress'' by Milosevic. ``He still has some way to go and 
it may well be wise for us to keep that threat hanging over him,'' 
Cook said. In Geneva, a spokesman for the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation 
Army, Bardhyl Mahmuti, called the Yugoslav troop movements nothing 
more than an ``illusion.'' Ethnic Albanians maintain the government 
troops are withdrawing only temporarily and want NATO to strike. Evidence 
of the Serb withdrawal included the abandoned Komorane checkpoint 
outside Pristina and signs of more movement among villagers. In Malisevo, 
a former rebel stronghold 30 miles (50 kilometers) southwest of Pristina, 
hundreds of ethnic Albanians filled the streets Tuesday, visiting 
homes and shops they abandoned when Serb forces overran the town in 
July. As if to underscore the uncertainty of the situation, the crowds 
disappeared after a few bursts of automatic gunfire rang out when 
a small convoy of armored police vehicles rolled into town. Serb police 
said the shots came from somewhere in the village and they did not 
return fire. About a mile (kilometer) north of town, uniformed guerrillas 
inspected bunkers vacated by departing Serb police and found a grenade 
tied to a tree, with a trip wire set as a booby trap. Such threats 
prevent most of the remaining displaced people in Kosovo from returning 
home. But many have come out of the wilderness because of the approaching 
winter to stay with friends and relatives in safe towns, said U.N. 
refugee official Kris Janowski. He said about 10,000 people remain 
in the woods. In Malisevo, villager Osman Mazreku said he fled to 
a nearby town nearly three months ago with his wife, mother and three 
children. His elderly father stayed behind, was arrested by police 
and has not been seen since, Mazreku said. ``He said 'I'm old and 
they won't do anything to me,''' Mazreku said. ``I was afraid something 
like this would happen.'' The top floor of the family's two-story 
house had been gutted by flames. Clothing, valuables and garbage were 
strewn across the ground floor. ``I'm sorry to see my house in this 
condition, but I'm happy to be alive,'' he said. ``I hope they'll 
let me live here.'' As the withdrawal accelerated, Kosovo's Serb governor, 
Veljko Odalovic, thanked the police for ``bringing peace to Kosovo'' 
and pledged the province will be defended from ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' 
with or without the police.
