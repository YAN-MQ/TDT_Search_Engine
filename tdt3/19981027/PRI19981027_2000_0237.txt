Police in China have detained or warned numerous dissidents around 
the country. It appears to be an attempt to deter them from holding 
a demonstration in support of a fellow political activist. The arrests 
come despite signs of a relaxation in the country's political atmosphere 
in recent months. James Miles reports. Dissidents say that in the 
last three days, numerous political activists around the country have 
been detained or given warnings by the police, in a large scale clampdown 
aimed at preventing a planned gathering of dissidents in the eastern 
province of Shandong. A human rights monitoring group in Hong Kong 
said that more than 40 dissidents had been targeted by the police, 
of whom at least 15 were still being held. Despite signs of a more 
relaxed political atmosphere in recent months, the authorities clearly 
remain nervous about organized dissident activity. James Miles, BBC, 
Beijing.
