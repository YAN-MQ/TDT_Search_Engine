American tennis player, Michael Chang, suffered another embarrassing 
defeat as he was knocked out of the first round of the Euro Card Open 
in Shtodcart. Unheralded Frenchman, Guyome Raul ranked 22 places below 
Chang, beat the former French Open champion in straight sets 7-6, 
6-3. Two Americans were victorious at the event Monday. Todd Martin 
beat Canadian Sebastian LeRoux in straight sets. While rising young 
player, Jan Michael Gamel defeated Daniel Vicek of the Czech Republic 
in three sets. The top eight seeded players at this event had first-round 
buys. That includes American Pete Sandlers who is trying to hold on 
to his number one ranking. Number two, Marcello Rios of Chili and 
third rank, Patrick Raptor of Australia, still have a chance of denying 
Sandlers a record sixth consecutive year-end number one ranking.
