President and Mrs. Clinton were among the hundreds of thousands here 
this afternoon who came to see John Glenn and the rest of the discovery 
crew blast off. They watched the live river from the roof of the launch 
control building, considered a safe distance away, 3 1/2 miles from 
the launch pad. The president is the first president to watch a shuttle 
liftoff in person. Nixon was the last president to see a space launch 
from here.
