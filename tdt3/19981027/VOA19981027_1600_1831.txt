NATO ambassadors have decided against immediately military action 
in the Kosovo crisis, but will maintain the threat of air strikes. 
The ambassadors, meeting in Brussels acted, after substantial movement 
by Yugoslav authorities toward compliance with the UN demands for 
reducing forces in Serbia's Kosovo province. In Washington, a White 
House spokesman says Yugoslavia had pulled out or returned to barracks 
well over 90 percent of the troops. He cautioned, however, that the 
international community will continue to closely monitor the situation. 
More from Pentagon spokesman, Mike Doubleday, on the Kosovo pullback. 
There is very substantial evidence of compliance that we point to 
roadblocks that have been taken down. Heavy weapons which have been 
moved into containment areas. Troops that have either moved out of 
Kosovo or have moved back into their garrison areas. The figures I 
have heard today are that about 90 percent of MUP reinforcements, 
these are the specialized police that moved into the area when the 
violence erupted. These, about 90 percent of those forces, the MUP 
have been pulled out of Kosovo. Pentagon spokesman, Mike Doubleday. 
Meanwhile, the top commander of ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting 
for Kosovo independence describes the Serbian troop movements as a 
masquerade that does not amount to a real withdrawal.
