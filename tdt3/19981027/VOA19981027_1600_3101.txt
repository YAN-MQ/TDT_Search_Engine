Crude oil prices rose sharply in New York trading Tuesday after Mexico's 
national oil company evacuated workers from off shore rigs in the 
Gulf of Mexico where Hurricane Mitch is headed. Crude oil rose as 
much as 35 cents, that is 2.5 percent, to $14.58 a barrel on New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Oil rigs in the southern Gulf account for three-quarters 
of oil output from Mexico. The world's sixth largest oil producer. 
Mitch is one of the most powerful storms on record and was bearing 
down on the Yucatan Peninsula by late Monday afternoon.
