It's 25 months and counting until the next presidential election and 
an evaluation of the electorate today suggests the republicans have 
the advantage. Vice President Gore and Texas governor George W. bush 
are the clear front-runners for the democratic and republican parties 
respectively. But in a head-to-head match-up a CNN/"USA today" Gallup 
poll shows that bush's support is considerably stronger than Gore's, 
57% compared to 39%. Of the 499 democrats surveyed, 41% favor Gore. 
The next closest contenders are former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley 
and house minority leader Dick Gephart. Of the 423 republicans polled, 
39% support bush. Red cross President Elizabeth Dole and former vice 
President Dan Quayle lead the rest of the pack.
