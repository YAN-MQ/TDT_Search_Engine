On the subject of political gain -- how about at highway, or at least 
a Piece of one? This is about "your money," of course, and how a couple 
of politicians -- well, "worked it out" would be a good description. 
Here is ABC's James Walker. One week before election day and Arkansas 
congressman Jay Dickey is all smiles. You're doing great. I mean, 
you're just doing -- Congratulations. Thank you. Last summer, Dickey 
had tried to get federal money to build a Branch of interstate highway 
69 through his state, but he lost because senate majority leader Trent 
Lott wanted part of the highway to go through his home state, Mississippi, 
and not just through Arkansas. Last July when we talked, your highway 
was dead. Dead. As a door nail. It was dead as a door nail. That's 
right. But an election was coming up and house speaker Newt Gingrich 
wanted to help republican Dickey get reelected, to maintain the GOP 
majority in Congress. So Gingrich cornered Lott and the two struck 
a deal. Lott would keep his portion of the interstate through Mississippi. 
Dickey would reduce his proposed branch to 52 miles -- all of it in 
his district. Lott then agreed. Dickey got $100 million for his road, 
which will mean jobs for lots of his constituents. Did the house speaker 
help you? Absolutely. Did senator Lott help you? Oh, yes. yes. And 
you're in a heavily democratic district? That's exactly right. That's 
exactly right. Maybe one of the most democratic districts -- Will 
it help you? Yes, it will. It's just wonderful to see a democrat here. 
I want ell you. Just keep iling while you're talking about us republicans. 
But it turns out that $100 million is only a start. Taxpayers, either 
state or federal, will have to come up with $150 million more to finish 
congressman Dickey's highway. Either that or leave a half-finished 
strip of interstate sitting in arkansas. James Walker, ABC News, pine 
bluff, Arkansas.
