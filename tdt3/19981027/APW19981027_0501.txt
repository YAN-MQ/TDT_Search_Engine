Two of 25 Rwandan genocide suspects who went on a hunger strike to 
protest what they called bias by a U.N. human rights tribunal resumed 
eating 24 hours later, a U.N. official said Tuesday. Thirty genocide 
suspects and two others appealing their convictions are being held 
by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, prosecuting suspects 
who killed more than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and politically 
moderate Hutus, between April and July 1994. Clement Kayishema and 
Obed Ruzindana, who are jointly charged with killing of Tutsis in 
the genocide, ate breakfast, said the source on condition his name 
was not published. He said workers for the tribunal, which is meeting 
in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, said Ruzindana had breakfast. 
A prison worker, who also spoke on condition his name not be published, 
said some of the other detainees were ``secretly taking biscuits and 
juices.'' The 25 suspects said Monday they were joining the hunger 
strike of a convicted former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, who stopped 
eating last week because the tribunal refused to pay for the Canadian 
lawyer he wanted as a defense attorney. The court gives suspects a 
choice of free tribunal-appointed defense attorneys. Suspects may 
select other attorneys but the court will not pay for them. In a letter 
Monday to the court the 25 suspects accused the panel of bias, indifference 
to detainees' complaints and an inability to ``understand defense 
arguments.'' Awe Okali, the tribunal's registrar, later defended the 
system of court-appointed lawyers and said the detainees were panicking 
because they realized the tribunal's work was moving forward. ``The 
reality of the tribunal's work of calling to account persons accused 
of genocide in Rwanda is hitting home,'' Okali said. ``In these circumstances, 
these detainees feel they have nothing to lose by engaging in these 
agitations.'' Akayesu is appealing the life sentence he received earlier 
this month for his role in the genocide, which was orchestrated by 
the Hutu-dominated government. The slaughter ended when a Tutsi-dominated 
rebel force defeated the government army.
