One of the major concerns about hurricane Mitch is the scheduled lift 
off thursday of John Glenn's shuttle flight. That's looking better 
tonight. But a storm of this magnitude is a killer. History is a reminder 
of just how dangerous these storms can be. NBC's Robert Hager is at 
cape Canaveral. Tom, with Mitch drifting west now, NasA no longer 
sees it as a Threat here. Of launch on time, Thursday. But a hurricane 
like that, with sustained winds peaking at 180 overnight, is among 
the strongest known. One of the all-time "monster" storms. The highest 
winds ever recorded in a hurricane hitting the U.S. 195 miles an hour. 
In killer hurricane camille, in 1969. Slamming into the Mississippi 
coast all the way into Virginia. At the national center for atmospheric 
research, hurricane expert Roger pielke -- It killed more than 250 
people in the United States. We haven't seen anything like that in 
about 30 years. And if we do, we'll see tremendous damage and loss 
of life. Some say another storm might have been even stronger, called 
"the labor day hurricane." It ploughed between the Florida keys in 
1935, there were unofficial claims of winds as high as 200 miles an 
hour. Two other storms packed huge winds, but spared the U.S. mainland. 
Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Mexico's Yucatan peninsula in 1988 
with winds of 185 miles an hour, went on to terrorize the Texas coast 
for a While, but finally blew inland over monterrey, Mexico. Hurricane 
Allen followed a similar course in 1980 with winds of 190 miles an 
hour, but by the time it hit shore over Brownsville, Texas, winds 
had diminished. The one word that scientists use to describe such 
storms is catastrophic. Other records, most expensive ever was 1992's 
hurricane Andrew. Only a category 4 storm, but did $35 billion damage 
in today's dollars, mostly in south Florida. The most deadly ever 
-- also a category 4, a 1900 hurricane that swept over galveston, 
Texas, killed 6,000. As for the space program, hurricanes or tropical 
storms have forced delays in the past. 12 times, the shuttle has had 
to be rolled back from the pad. But no launch has ever been. Scrubbed, 
by such a threat. And at the moment, NASA predicts this one, too, 
will go off on time. tom?
