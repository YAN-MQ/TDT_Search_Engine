Good evening. We were told six weeks ago this would be a nasty hurricane 
season. And tonight, hurricane Mitch is re-enforcing the point in 
a frightening fashion. Mitch is a huge and powerful storm, moving 
slowly and ominously toward the southern coast of the Yucatan peninsula 
of Mexico and central America. There's a mad scramble to clear out 
of its way, but the damage still could be enormous. NBC's Kerry Sanders 
begins our coverage. Troops on high alert across central America while 
residents try to escape hurricane Mitch's fury. A storm so dangerous 
so powerful winds gust in excess of 180 miles an hour, the most -- 
a category 5 hurricane, the most destructive storm it can pack. 350 
miles across on a zigzag course, it creeps towards coastal central 
america. The eye of the monstrous storm is expected to hit Honduras 
until Thursday night, but already residents in Honduras feel the effects. 
This woman says -- "I am sad because I don't know if we are going 
to get through this." The outer bands of hurricane Mitch dumped 10 
inches an hour, some cities flooded, already four people have drowned. 
Experts predict that Mitch could cause massive coastal flooding and 
in rural areas, mud slides. In the resort city of cancun, Mexico, 
hotels boarded up. The rush is now on to get out. Tourists, cutting 
vacations short. No one wants to miss the last flight out. When they 
start to board up your room, I think it's time to leave. We're supposed 
to stay here for a week. This is the third day, and of course, we 
want to be safe and protect our families. We are out of here. At the 
national hurricane center, forecasters tracking the deadly storm -- 
I'm afraid that we are going to have a disaster on their hands in 
Honduras just from the rainfall. If it does day on track towards the 
Yucatan, they are going to get the whole nine yards. A storm surge, 
the winds and the rain over there. Tonight, hurricane Mitch is moving 
slowly. Its winds are down into the 150 mile per hour range. The longer 
it stays out over the ocean, experts said more it Churches up cold 
water. That's good news but the cold water saps its strength. Kerry 
Sanders, NBC news, cancun, Mexico.
