Russia expects record exports this year of crude oil, its top foreign-currency 
earner, despite pledges to cut sales to help stop the slide in world 
prices, an official said Tuesday. The reason for pushing exports ``is 
clear _ the lack of any other sources of cash,'' said Energy Minister 
Sergei Generalov. Russia last year experienced its first economic 
growth since the Soviet collapse, but hopes for more of the same were 
dashed when a new economic crisis erupted in mid-August. The government's 
chronic cash-flow problems have grown even worse. Generalov said Russia 
exported ``substantially more crude oil than ever before'' in the 
first half of 1998. Exports for the second half will be slightly lower, 
but overall, ``this year will in fact be a record high'' he told a 
news conference. Russian news agencies said 1998 exports will total 
115 million to 116 million metric tons (805 million to 811 million 
barrels). However, because world oil prices are quite low at present 
_ about dlrs 14 a barrel _ the government is unlikely to see a large 
increase in revenues. Russia promised the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries earlier this year that it would cut oil exports, 
because surplus oil on world markets has kept prices low. Earlier 
Tuesday, the chairman of a state-controlled bank involved with debts 
said Russia will be able to make all payments on its foreign debt 
this year. Russia will have to pay about dlrs 3 billion toward its 
foreign debt this year and about dlrs 18 billion next year, said Andrei 
Kostin, chairman of the Vneshekonombank, or Bank of Foreign Economic 
Activity. ``If the government decides it cannot make foreign debt 
payments next year, it should say so in advance,'' Kostin said, according 
to the Interfax news agency. ``There is no question of nonpayments 
at present.'' The head of the Russian parliament's budget committee, 
Alexander Zhukov, said Monday the government will owe dlrs 17.5 billion 
in foreign debt in 1999, but won't have the revenues to pay it. Russia 
is trying to restructure its domestic debt, payments on which were 
frozen when the financial crisis erupted in mid-August. International 
lenders and debtors have been concerned about the lack of a plan to 
boost revenues and slash spending, six weeks after Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov took office. The International Monetary Fund has 
said it wants to see a sound economic plan implemented before releasing 
more of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package negotiated during the 
summer. Meanwhile, the Federal Treasury said that privatizations netted 
the government only 11 percent of the revenue it expected between 
January and September _ 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 79 million) instead 
of 11.9 billion rubles (dlrs 698 million). A number of big auctions 
have been canceled because of the economic crisis.
