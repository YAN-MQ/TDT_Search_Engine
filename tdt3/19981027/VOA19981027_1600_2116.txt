The countdown is continuing for Pioneer astronaut, John Glenn's historic 
return to space as the outlook for launch day weather improves. Forecasters 
are now predicting a 70 percent chance of favorable conditions at 
Cape Canaveral, Florida, Thursday, a 10 percent improvement from the 
last assessment. But there was still a chance of strong winds and 
Hurricane Mitch could delay a shuttle discovery's launch.
