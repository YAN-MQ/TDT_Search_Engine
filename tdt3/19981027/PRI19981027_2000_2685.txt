You might want to say your prayers, because we're off to a home of 
monks in today's Geography Quiz. We're in a southeast German city 
which sprang from a Benedictine Monastery built in AD 750. The monks 
chose a beautiful spot. To the south of the city are the Bavarian 
Alps. The mighty Esar River runs through the city, and flanks the 
English Gaarten, or garden, Europe's largest inner city park. For 
the bolder sole, the park features a rare nudist area, where sun lovers 
worship all summer long. The city is also home to Germany's most popular 
TV detective. And thus was a little bit sadder than the rest of the 
country to see his series fold last Friday. I'll give you a few minutes 
for a little detective work of your own, then we will reveal the answer 
to our Geography quiz.
