The company is in bankruptcy but the managers are getting bonuses. 
A judge has approved a plan cooked up by Boston chicken to keep its 
managers from abandoning the company. The company says managers have 
been quitting in droves since it revealed financial troubles in July. 
The $18 million reorganization plan would include $15,000 bonuses 
paid out over two years to the managers. Even higher bonuses will 
be offered to higher level managers.
