For most of us, Tchaikovsky's ballet ``The Nutcracker'' probably means 
one of two things: the perennial magic of the stagework itself or 
a purely musical encounter with the beloved little dances that pepper 
the second act. But who would pause over the whole of Tchaikovsky's 
musical work, every scene and transition, without the stagecraft and 
dancing? After all, ``The Nutcracker'' isn't exactly the ``Pathetique'' 
Symphony. Or is it? In a new recording by Valery Gergiev and the Kirov 
Orchestra (Philips 289 462 114-2; CD), to be replicated in a concert 
at Carnegie Hall on Saturday evening, ``The Nutcracker'' takes on 
a symphonic aspect of unsuspected power and depth. While cleverness 
and brilliance may be routinely associated with Tchaikovsky's evergreen 
score, Gergiev gives fresh meaning to those virtues in an interpretation 
that is anything but routine. Listening to the Kirov's vibrant playing 
here, one thinks of Toscanini's definition of tradition as the last 
bad performance. At least in the West, tradition has glazed the rich 
textures of ``The Nutcracker'' with a superficial gloss that reflects 
nothing much deeper than good tunes. Gergiev and his savvy Russian 
ensemble strip away that varnish to get at the counterpoint, the interior 
voices and their animating rhythms. End to end, it's a heady process 
of rediscovery. Again and again, one is reminded of Tchaikovsky's 
lifelong fascination with music of the 18th century. Along with the 
sparkling clarity and motoric energy that Gergiev brings to the work 
at every turn, he also catches a distinctive edge of Sturm und Drang 
that charges Tchaikovsky's music at unexpected points: in Drosselmeyer's 
presentation of gifts, in the impassioned duet between Clara and the 
Nutcracker, even in the grand waltz that crowns the ballet. Perhaps 
nowhere is Gergiev's sense of the musical fabric more striking than 
in the transitional Act I tableau of the Christmas tree, leading to 
the ``Waltz of the Snowflakes.'' The conductor achieves an aura of 
dramatic suspension and flow worthy of a well-fashioned symphonic 
movement; ``The Nutcracker,'' Gergiev demonstrates, makes for compelling 
theater even on the stage of the imagination. But above all, his seriously 
considered reading shows us an eveninglong symphonic work of unflagging 
vitality and invention. Tchaikovsky may have rued the wild popularity 
of his children's tale, but that was after the creative fact. Gergiev 
takes us back to that first light of inspiration, and his orchestra 
plays as if guided by the composer's own hand.
