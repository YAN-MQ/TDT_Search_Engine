A visit by the foreign minister of the North African country of Mauritania 
was seen by Israel Tuesday as a possible thaw in relations between 
the Jewish state and the Arab world. A senior Israeli foreign ministry 
official linked the two-day visit of Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammed 
Khouna to the new peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians 
negotiated at Wye Plantation in Maryland last week. ``It's a consequence 
of the Wye Plantation agreement,'' David Dadonn told The Associated 
Press. ``We hope this will be a signal for more.'' After the first 
peace agreements were signed by Israel and the Palestinians in 1993 
and 1995, several Arab countries established low-level ties with Israel. 
However, the contacts were frozen when the peace talks entered a 17-month 
stalemate under Israel's hard-line leader, Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu. Israel and Mauritania established interest offices, the 
lowest level of relations, in November 1995. Israel has similar relations 
with Qatar and Oman. Tunisia and Morocco have slightly higher relations, 
Dadonn said. Egypt is the only North African country that has full 
diplomatic relations with Israel. Khouna arrived in Israel Monday 
and was scheduled to meet with Israeli President Ezer Weizman Tuesday. 
Khouna's agenda includes meetings with Netanyahu, Foreign Minister 
Ariel Sharon, and Dan Tichon, the speaker of Israel's parliament as 
well as a visit to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial.
