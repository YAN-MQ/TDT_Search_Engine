Jerry Seinfeld and the producers of his popular sitcom are facing 
a $100 million lawsuit. 43-year-old Michael costanza says they stole 
his name, likeness and persona for the character George costanza. 
The real costanza, who claims to have known Seinfeld for 24 years, 
says the program uses many of his physical and personality traits 
and portrays him in a Negative light. Seinfeld attorneys say the character 
is based 100% on the show's co-creator, Larry David.
