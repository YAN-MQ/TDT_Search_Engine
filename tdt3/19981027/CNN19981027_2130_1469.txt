Morgan Freeman may play south African President Nelson Mandela in 
an upcoming film entitled "long walk to freedom." It's based on Mandela's 
1994 autobiography. The producer is considering casting several actors 
to portray Mandela at different stages of his life, with Freeman playing 
the Elder Mandela. The movie would trace Mandela's life from his childhood 
as a cow herder through his 27 years in prison and his eventual rise 
to south Africa's presidency.
