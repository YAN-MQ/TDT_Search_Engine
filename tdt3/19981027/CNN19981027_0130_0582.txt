Researchers at Vanderbilt University say a new drug has been successfully 
used to treat spinal cord injuries in some mice. But they caution 
-- it's too early to tell what the benefit could be for human victims 
of paralysis. Laurie Dhue reports. Keith McClaire's spinal cord was 
severed in a three-wheel vehicle accident in 1987. He's paralyzed 
from the chest down. Back then, medication wasn't used to reduce spinal 
cord inflammation -- a Process that now can prevent permanent paralysis. 
I remember the doctors saying, "ten years, you'll be walking again." 
Well, yesterday was my 11th anniversary to my accident, and am I walking? 
Are they even close? no. But Keith lives a productive life -- he's 
active in sports, his wife is expecting their first child and he gives 
presentations for think first, a national injury prevention program. 
The discovery of a new drug that allows mice to walk again after a 
spinal cord injury might have given him hope 11 years ago. But now, 
he says he's more realistic. People that are newly injured are probably 
in the earlier stages of the grieving process. And so, when they hear 
the news, they might be a lot more excited than I am, and the false 
hopes might have a big part in, you know, their emotions -- They might 
go up and down. That's a concern shared by the lead researcher of 
the new study. There is nothing in this study that suggests that a 
person with spinal cord injury could benefit from cm-101. Even if 
the medication works on humans, scientists say it must be administered 
within days of the injury. The new treatment is experimental. In fact, 
it won't be tested on humans until next year. But if successful, it 
could change the lives of future spinal cord patients. Laurie Dhue,
