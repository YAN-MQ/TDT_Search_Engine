Families of 179 people jailed since an anti-government riot over the 
weekend stood outside a police compound Tuesday, demanding the release 
of their relatives and waving pictures of what they claimed was police 
brutality. ``I have a 65-year-old father who was beaten up. He was 
praying. He was harmless,'' said Jusri Jamal, whose father was one 
of thousands inside a mosque Saturday when police showered the Muslim 
house of worship with tear gas and water cannons. Jusri and some 150 
others waited outside Kuala Lumpur's Police Training Center all day 
Tuesday. Police denied access to family members and a team of 18 Legal 
Aid lawyers. An officer behind gates of the training center said that 
families would not be allowed to visit during investigations. N. Surendran, 
one of the lawyers, said police planned to hold the detainees for 
11 more days without charges pending an investigation. While meeting 
with a magistrate inside the police compound, he and other lawyers 
said they caught a glimpse of a group of detainees. ``Many people 
had black eyes, there were signs of beatings,'' Surendran said, adding, 
``We cannot confirm they came from police.'' Family members, however, 
showed reporters that they said documented police beatings. One woman 
held a photo downloaded from the Internet showing a woman she identified 
as her 38-year-old sister, being dragged by the hair by a plainclothes 
officer at Saturday's riot. Police said they arrested 268 people at 
the riot, where thousands demanded the resignation of Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad and justice for his jailed former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim. 
The majority of those arrested have not yet been released. Police 
had threatened to use the Internal Security Act against those caught 
at pro-Anwar rallies. The act allows detention without trial. Street 
protests have multiplied since Mahathir fired Anwar as deputy prime 
minister and finance minister on Sept. 2. Anwar faces trial beginning 
Nov. 2 on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct. Saturday's 
was the first violent clash. Protesters hurled rocks and bottles at 
police. Many of those arrested appeared to be innocent bystanders, 
who were kicked and punched by police, then dragged into nearby trucks. 
``I thought it was only in the movies, but it happens in real life, 
in a so-called democratic society,'' Azman Ismail told reporters. 
He waved a photograph that he said he took of his brother earlier 
Tuesday while he was being transported to the police compound. The 
man appeared to have a bruised eye. ``He is in bad shape, worse than 
Anwar,'' Azman said. Anwar's case sparked international concern when 
he appeared in court last month with a badly blackened eye and body 
bruises, which he said came from police beatings.
