Russian President Boris Yeltsin is in a sanitarium for treatment of 
what the Kremlin says is exhaustion. Yesterday, he canceled a trip 
to Austria because of high blood pressure and fatigue. Prime minister 
Yevgeny Primakov went to Vienna in his place to meet with international 
leaders. Yeltsin's current health problems are raising questions about 
his ability to stay in office amid Russia's worst economic crisis 
of the post-Soviet era.
