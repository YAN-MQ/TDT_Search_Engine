Listen up, Zoomers and Ubbi Dubbi linguists of all stripes, childhood 
pleasures are coming around again. PBS is reviving ``Zoom,'' the daily 
variety series for 6-to-12-year-olds that was one of the most popular 
children's shows of the 1970s. Considered a coupling of ``Sesame Street'' 
and ``Laugh-In,'' the series was second only to ``Masterpiece Theater'' 
in its power to attract public-broadcasting viewers. For a culture 
now gripped with nostalgia for the bell-bottoms and tie-dyed T-shirts 
of that decade, WGBH, the public television station here, has shot 
40 new episodes of the show, replete with the old secret language 
Ubbi Dubbi, and scheduled a nationwide premiere for January. The 90s 
``Zoom'' hosts have shorter hair, rounder faces and narrower bell-bottoms 
than their predecessors _ and no need to ask if hockey can be a girl's 
game. But what the producers of ``Zoom'' are trying to re-create is 
not the 1970s version of youth culture as fashion statement. Beyond 
disco music, polyester leisure suits or drug-dazed daffiness, they 
seek to extol the deeper values of the 1970s: peace, love, activism, 
power to the people and free, creative expression, recurrent themes 
of the original series. ``It's about empowering children,'' said Kate 
Taylor, the executive producer. ``We want to give kids the power _ 
in a safe and supportive way _ to write down their ideas, guide us 
and, as a reward for taking the risk of reaching out, give them a 
TV show and a continuous dialogue with us.'' No puppets or animation 
here. ``Zoom,'' which focuses on literacy, science and math, did and 
does again call upon real children from around the country to provide 
the show's contents. For the new series, for instance, Patrick of 
Flatwoods, Ky., sent in a video depicting the construction of a paddleboat 
from styrofoam trays and rubber bands. The video was made part of 
one show, showing the final result: the vessel was launched and even 
floated. Striving for education through participation, ``Zoom'' urges 
young viewers to send in ideas for games, puzzles, recipes, poems, 
skits and conversations. The station responds via a newsletter and 
e-mail. Viewers are also asked, over the air, to summon up enough 
confidence in their own creativity to turn off the television and 
do the activities themselves. That's interactive (among other things). 
And that interactive format should position ``Zoom'' to take advantage 
of digital television when it introduces real-time two-way communication, 
said Peggy Charren, founder of the advocacy group Action for Children's 
Television. ``The show has positioned itself for the digital future 
by reviving some of the deeper values of the 70s past,'' she said. 
``Zoom'' also has a Web site (www.pbs.org/zoom) and an e-mail address 
(zoom(at)wgbh.org). Ms. Charren believes there's good reason to revive 
``Zoom.'' ``There hasn't been anything like it before or since,'' 
she said. ``A lot of the '70s nostalgia is banal, but `Zoom' teaches 
children what they need to know to function in a democracy and helps 
busy parents organize creative play for them. It's for and by kids; 
it's not based on selling merchandise.'' One recent day at WGBH, on 
the purple, yellow, orange and acid green ``Zoom'' set, the new show's 
hosts, ages 9 to 14, were hard at work. Alisa, David, Jared, Keiko, 
Lynese, Pablo and Zoe _ all from the Boston area and none of them 
professional actors _ are known by first names only to avoid creating 
a star system, said Ms. Taylor. Passing out pieces of bubble gum for 
one segment, the children asked the age-old question ``Who can blow 
the biggest bubble?'' In response, they chewed and puffed as the sticky 
stuff burst on freckled cheeks, pigtails and noses. ``A pack of gum 
can be fun for hours,'' they chanted. ``If you like what you see, 
turn off the TV and try it.'' Next, Zoe, un-self-consciously wearing 
a blue bicycle helmet, presented her flea circus. She coaxed the imaginary 
but nevertheless fabulous Fernando to do his death-defying back flip 
on a seesaw made of a ruler laid over a cork. As the ``flea'' soared 
in the air, the other children did the sound effects off camera: barking 
dog, drum roll and slide whistle. After Zoe had patiently spent a 
half-hour trying to perfect the 30-second bit, she momentarily deflated 
and curled onto the carpet for a catnap. Soon after, the children 
divided up for a relay race in which each team had a suitcase of old 
clothes. The children pulled the oversize shirts and slacks over their 
own clothes, ran to their teammates on the other side, then peeled 
off and repacked the clothes for the next contestants. While most 
children's shows have adult hosts, an educational show with real children 
as hosts helps build young viewers' self-esteem and interest them 
in learning, said Joanne Cantor, a professor of communication arts 
at the University of Wisconsin. ``Television has a potentially limitless 
power to positively affect viewers if the money and effort are put 
in,'' she added. Apparently that was true for ``Zoom'' the first time 
around. When it was introduced a generation ago, the show was unusual 
because it received praise from children, parents and television critics. 
Wildly popular among children, the show received about 10,000 letters 
a week, but it also received two Emmy Awards for outstanding children's 
series. Early on, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times described 
the show's success as ``almost startling'' and attributed that to 
``first-rate editing and presentational techniques'' plus the ``spontaneous 
creativity of children'' and their ``infectious exuberance.'' Any 
young viewer, he said, could believe ``that he or she would be sensational 
on the show.'' Nevertheless in 1973, faced with a chronic shortage 
of funds, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in Washington threatened 
to cancel ``Zoom.'' In an act of '70s-style political activism, ``Zoom'' 
hosts asked viewers to press for the show's continuation by sending 
letters to CPB. Deluged by about 190,000 pieces of mail, CPB found 
the necessary $700,000. Today it costs $8 million to produce one season. 
In part, the revival of the show, which ran from 1972 through 1979, 
is also a matter of timing. ``As people in their 20s and 30s have 
children, they reminisce about their own childhood,'' said Ms. Taylor. 
Of course, there are risks in retreads. Old Zoomers may not like the 
new features (among them, shorter segments, more dynamic graphics, 
a bolder color scheme and Zoomchats in which children talk about major 
issues from starting school to divorce). And young viewers may resist 
watching a show with which their parents identify. As they wrap up 
shooting, it's clear that making the show has been like an extended 
summer camp for the Zoom cast, which will change next season. In June, 
the group bonded through a two-and-a-half-day Outward Bound-style 
retreat in a nearby suburb. At WGBH, the children had their own private 
playroom, where they learned the material for each segment, rehearsed, 
ate and relaxed. And they are learning at least one very adult lesson. 
As David, age 10, said, ``The hardest thing is, I don't want this 
to end.''
