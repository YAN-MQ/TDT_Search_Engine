Air force meteorologists are predicting a dramatically improved forecast 
for Thursday's launch of space shuttle discovery. There had been concern 
hurricane Mitch could disrupt takeoff. Meteorologists now say there 
is zero chance bad weather will delay liftoff. That's good news for 
John Glenn and the rest of the crew who arrived at kennedy space center 
yesterday. They spent part of today undergoing medical checks.
