We were on vacation in New Orleans. Great city, but every night I 
got this awful heartburn. A woman in our tour group said "here, try 
Zantac 75." "Oh, thank you," I said, "you're a Saint." She said, "no, 
actually, I'm a doctor." The medicine in Zantac 75 is the #1 doctor-prescribed 
acid reducer. It relieves even your toughest heartburn controlling 
acid for up to 12 hours. Maybe a doctor and a Saint. Zantac 75. If 
you looked into your local carrier's phone lines what time period 
would they place your company in? Why live in the past... when local's 
future is right through here? On-net. Where local, national and global 
all flow over one network, owned by one company. Oh, and did I mention... 
it'll save you money? On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
