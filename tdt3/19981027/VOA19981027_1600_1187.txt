Organizers of the 2000 European football championship say that stadiums 
will be ready for the matches one year ahead of schedule. The 23-day 
tournament is being co-hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands between 
June 10 and July 2, 2000. A tournament spokesman said problems with 
Belgium's Charleroy Stadium have been solved, and it will be completed 
by May of next year. Three other stadiums in Belgium have already 
been renovated. The Netherlands' four stadiums do not need renovation. 
One of those stadiums, Theonore Stadium, has been chosen as the venue 
for the final match. Amsterdam will stage one of the semifinals as 
will Brussels.
