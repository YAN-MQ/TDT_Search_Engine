NATO will not take military action in the Kosovo crisis after substantial 
movement by Yugoslavia towards compliance with UN demands. The Islamic 
Jihad accuses Israel of being behind the car bomb explosion Tuesday, 
which wounded one of its leaders in the Lebanese port city of Sidon. 
Genocide suspects from Rwanda start a hunger strike at the UN Rwandan 
war crimes tribunal in Tanzania. Social Democrat, Gerhard Schroder, 
will be sworn in as Germany's new Chancellor, ushering in that nation's 
first center left government in 16 years. I am Tom Crosby. And I am 
Susan Yackie. We have those stories, sports, business news, and a 
trip to Johnstown, Pennsylvania to remember a massive flood a century 
ago. It is all ahead in this hour of VOA News Now. First, a summary 
of World News. I am Pat Bodner, VOANews.
