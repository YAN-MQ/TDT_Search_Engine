One of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever recorder is moving along 
coast of Central America towards Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. 
Hurricane Mitch has already brought widespread flooding to Honduras. 
Jack Bevins of the Tropical Prediction Center in Miami says much more 
devastation is likely. With this storm, even if the eye of the hurricane 
does not go into Honduras, they are already getting heavy rain, you 
will hear damaging casualty reports there. Also, in 1994, we had tropical 
storm Gordon, down in the Caribbean, a much, much weaker system. But 
it caused very heavy rains over Haiti, and the death toll there was 
somewhere between 1000 and 2000. Latest reports say Hurricane Mitch 
has weakened slightly, but is still packing winds of up to 165 mph, 
posing an extreme threat.
