This is The World. A co-production of the BBB World Service, PRI and 
WGBH, Boston. It's Tuesday, October 27th, I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. 
Today, Syrian forces scramble out of Kosovo in time to meet a NATO 
deadline. But ethnic Albanians are skeptical that 2000 unarmed monitors 
will prevent another war. Russia's president checks out of the financial 
crisis and into a sanitarium. And China's new generation of filmmakers 
gets hip. These are not the retelling of 4000 year-old fables. These 
are modern Aegean. A lot of that, you can say, has something to do 
with influence from American cinema, and kind of the Gen X thing. 
First up, this news.
