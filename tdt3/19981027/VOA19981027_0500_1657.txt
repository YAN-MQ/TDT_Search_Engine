Some of our FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take a short 
two-minute break. Stay with us though, we will be back with more of 
VOA News Now. Today is Tuesday, October 27, 1998. A couple of events 
in American history that we are going to run down in the final moments 
of this half-hour. It was on this date in 1987 that several American 
newspapers published the first of a series of essays supporting ratification 
of the proposed United States Constitution. In all, 85 essays were 
published under the name The Federalist Papers. They were written 
anonymously by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay. Who 
were those fellas? Well, Madison was a future president, Alexander 
was a future Secretary of the Treasury, John Jay, the first Chief 
Justice of the United States. The three wrote under the pseudonym 
Puglas and here they argued that the new constitution was needed to 
replace the Nation's first National Charter. The proposed constitution 
they wrote would be foundation of a strong federal government without 
usurping important powers that belonged to the states. This was a 
fairly significant day in 1904, at least in New York City, well, I 
guess for the whole United States. Fifteen thousand formally dressed 
New Yorkers attended the gala opening of the city's underground railway, 
the subway. The mayor of the city, George McClellan acted as motorman 
on the first trip with passengers. He used a ceremonial silver controller 
to direct the train from Broadway to 145th Street. A distance of almost 
15 kilometers was completed exactly on the published schedule. The 
general public was admitted to the system at seven that evening for 
free rides and most stayed until the last train ran at midnight. Passengers 
admired the clean, white tile stations and quiet ride of the electric 
trains. Oh, how we long for the good old days in New York. Ten hours, 
30, Universal time. This is VOA News Now. Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has been admitted into a sanitarium near Moscow. NATO says 
Serb forces still have not completely left Kosovo as the deadline 
is about nine and a half hours away. And a South Korean businessman 
drives his gift of cattle into North Korea. Those stories plus business 
news and much more in our next half hour of VOA News Now. Hello again 
from Washington, I am Charlene Porter along with Paul Westfailing.
