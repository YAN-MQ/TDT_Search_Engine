John Glenn's upcoming return to space has rekindled interest in NASA's 
astronaut program both past and present. Miles O'Brien has the story. 
These are the astronauts. The first seven astronauts picked by NASA 
don't look much like the last 40. Back then, the stuff that made them 
right for the job was stick and rudder time -- specifically, pushing 
experimental military jets to their limits. Applicants without that 
experience need not apply. I just was in the right place at the right 
time, and -- and had the right desire and willingness. But this is 
now. Astronaut candidate Laurel Clark is fairly typical. She is a 
Navy flight surgeon who specialized in evacuating sick people from 
submarines. I think we are chosen for our ability to do a wide variety 
of things capably, maybe not expertly, but capably. You look for a 
good mix of things. Duane Ross presides over the selection of astronaut 
candidates, or "ascans" as they call them. Typically, he is flooded 
with 2,500 applications for what is often just 30 slots. So what are 
the basic qualifications? You have to have a degree in engineering 
or science. You have to have some work experience. You have to be 
a United States citizen. Of course, if you want to fly the shuttle, 
being a top military pilot is still a must. Persistence counts, too. 
This ascan just wouldn't take no for an answer. He asked NASA for 
a job four times. When you have a batting average before that of three 
times applied and three interviews and three times "no thank you," 
you don't get a whole lot of expectations. Checking credentials, references 
and medical records, Duane Ross and the selection committee winnow 
the wannabes down to a group of about 100. They are invited to Houston 
for interviews, medical exams, a tour and a lot of paperwork. If you 
can't fill out the forms then you probably don't want to be an astronaut. 
They are asked to write the old "why-I-wannabe" essay. This person's 
always wanted to be like James Kirk, Luke skywalker or even george 
jetson. Those were his heroes. Despite all the hoops ascans must jump 
through and the danger they must ultimately face, very few who get 
the nod say "no." In 20 years of picking astronauts, Duane Ross has 
been turned down only twice. Miles O'Brien, CNN, Houston.
