When Matthew Shepard died in a hospital here Oct. 12, this prairie 
city was a fleeting focus of national concern over anti-gay violence. 
At the Poudre Valley Hospital, a Web site for Shepard, the 21-year-old 
college student who was beaten in Wyoming, drew 15,000 e-mail messages 
for his family and 815,000 hits from around the world. Now voters 
here are debating more vociferously than ever two initiatives on next 
week's ballot that would expand the anti-discrimination ordinance 
to include ``sexual orientation.'' And some old attitudes remain unchanged 
by the the case of Shepard, who is believed to have been attacked 
in part because of his homosexuality. ``I was handing out stickers 
on a parade route, and one boy held out his hand for one,'' recalled 
Bob Lenk, spokesman for a group promoting the ordinance change. ``His 
mother said, `You put that on him, and I'll break your arm.''' Others 
say Shepard's legacy may be a softening of attitudes toward homosexuals, 
and a heightened awareness of anti-gay harassment. ``We have seen 
new faces walking in the door, asking for yard signs, asking to help,'' 
said Terry Summers, executive director of the Lambda Community Center, 
a local gay group that supports the initiatives. ``The middle-of-the-road 
has come to a conclusion.'' Without any polls to gauge public opinion, 
it is still unclear whether the 80,000 voters of the city where Shepard 
died will vote to extend anti-discrimination protection to gay men 
and lesbians. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a Washington 
group, knows of only three other municipalities where similar statutes 
are up for vote next week: Fayetteville, Ark., and two towns in Maine, 
South Portland and Ogunquit. Fort Collins, which grew up around a 
land grant agricultural college, Colorado State University, is well 
outside Colorado's ``granola belt.'' In this state, ordinances protecting 
homosexuals from discrimination exist only in Denver, Boulder and 
the mountain resort towns of Aspen, Crested Butte and Telluride _ 
all known for their liberalism. The passage of an anti-gay discrimination 
ordinance here could indicate a shift in middle America's attitudes 
toward homosexuals. In Fort Collins, a fast-growing city of 110,000 
residents, Republicans account for the largest bloc of registered 
voters, 38 percent. Twenty-six percent are Democrats, and the rest 
are unaffiliated. In 1988, the City Council rejected, 6 to 1, a bill 
to expand anti-discrimination protection to gay people. In a referendum 
later that year, 43 percent of voters supported the idea. But last 
March 3, the City Council voted unanimously to approve extending the 
city's Human Rights Code to offer protection to gay people. The shift 
appeared to mirror a larger shift across the country. A Time/CNN poll 
conducted of 1,036 Americans after Shepard's death found that 64 percent 
of respondents saw gay relationships as ``acceptable,'' compared with 
41 percent in 1978. ``I'm optimistic there is a whole different feeling 
today than in 1988 _ more mainstream people are willing to step forward,'' 
said Susan Kirkpatrick, the lone council member to vote for the ordinance 
change a decade ago and who is now running as a Democrat to represent 
Colorado's 4th District in Congress. After Shepard's death, the City 
Council seemed to be so eager to build support for the initiatives 
that it tentatively scheduled a ``Hate Awareness Week'' to coincide 
with the Nov. 3 election. But officials abandoned the idea after deciding 
that the effort might be construed as using public money to influence 
an election. Although opponents of the measure temporarily halted 
their campaign during Shepard's hospitalization here, the proposal 
has deeply split this otherwise easygoing suburban city, where one 
quarter of the residents work or study at the university. Known for 
its green spaces, low crime rate, and light traffic, Fort Collins 
was ranked in July by Money magazine as the best small city in the 
West to live in. Every day, The Fort Collins Coloradoan, the local 
newspaper, is filled with letters about the referendum. Among religious 
leaders here, 28 have formed a group to support the ordinance change, 
and 53 formed another group to oppose it. Tuesday, Colorado's Roman 
Catholic archbishop, Charles Chaput, wrote a column highlighting what 
he saw as flaws in the ordinance language. Objecting to a clause that 
would extend benefits to the ``spousal equivalent'' of a worker, the 
archbishop wrote, ``In the Christian understanding of marriage, no 
equivalent to a spouse can exist.'' Leaders of an opposition group, 
Citizens for Constitutional Freedoms, say revising the ordinance would 
prohibit residents from choosing roommates according to the sex or 
sexual orientation they prefer and would expand the legal definition 
of harassment to include unwelcome ``verbal conduct.'' ``I want Fort 
Collins to remain a place where people are free to express their feelings 
without fear of government reprisal,'' said James Ringenberg, a lawyer 
who leads the opposition group. These and other concerns, Ringenberg 
said, have fired up the opposition movement. In the last two weeks, 
he said, contributions to his group had doubled and enough volunteers 
had come forward to allow opponents to canvass each of the city's 
30,000 households. ``It is bad law,'' he said. ``Let's let the people 
of Fort Collins decide what is the best for their city, rather than 
be influenced by national politics.'' Defenders of the proposed expansion 
of the ordinance say that it will not restrict free speech and that 
it will not restrict people's choice of housemates. In the last two 
weeks, the ebb and flow of public opinion has washed across the desk 
of Chris Walsh, editor of the college newspaper here, The Rocky Mountain 
Collegian. Summarizing the impact of Shepard's death on the referendum, 
Walsh said, ``People are saying something has to be done, and if this 
is it, so be it.''
