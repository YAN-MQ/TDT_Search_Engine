With a 2:00 P.M. eastern time deadline now over, the White House says 
yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has made a significant withdrawal 
of serb military and police troops in Kosovo in order to avoid NATO 
air strikes. A chief U.S. monitor in the province says he has seen 
thousands of Serb police leave in the past 24 hours. That indicates 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with the agreement 
that would end the crisis in the province. NAto has insisted the number 
of troops be reduced to levels seen before the conflict with ethnic 
Albanian separatists began in February. Thousands of refugees who 
fled the violence are now returning home. International monitors are 
planning to help the people resettle and ensure the military stays 
out. We are going to train the local Albanian police, we are going 
to be all over the place. I hope there will be additional forces in 
the region to stabilize it, this is a very dramatic turnaround. Now 
it isn't the end, it's only the beginning, but it's a very important 
set of events if it holds. And frankly, I hate to use the "O" word 
in the Balkans, but there's reason this morning for some more optimism 
than we've had in the past. NATO officials meeting in Brussels announced 
today they will hold off on the approved air strikes against Milosevic. 
But they say the threat of force remains if he does not full comply 
with u.N. demands.
