NATIONAL FORECAST On Tuesday, a hurricane hunter aircraft found that 
Hurricane Mitch, once the strongest October hurricane on record and 
tied for the fourth most powerful overall, had weakened to a Category 
4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson intensity scale with central winds near 
150 miles an hour. However, Hurricane Mitch will remain extremely 
dangerous on Wednesday, as it plods slowly near the Central American 
coast. A strong cold front will sweep into the interior Northeast 
on Wednesday. A band of clouds and scattered showers will precede 
the front. East of the mountains, clouds will increase Wednesday afternoon 
as the front approaches. Weakening showers will accompany frontal 
passage Wednesday night. High pressure will remain nearly stationary 
over the South. Ample sunshine and mild temperatures will prevail 
from the Tennessee valley to the Southeast and Gulf coasts. Over Florida, 
patchy clouds and isolated showers will be limited to the extreme 
south. A corridor of moist air will extend from southern Texas to 
the upper Plains. Scattered thunderstorms will develop in the humid 
air ahead of a cold front from Texas to Kansas. A vigorous jet stream 
disturbance will pivot through the central Plains. Where this disturbance 
intersects the conveyor belt of moist air, clusters of showers and 
some strong thunderstorms will develop. Father west, areas of light 
rain will affect eastern parts of Wyoming and Montana, as moist winds 
ascend the sloping terrain. Meanwhile, a cold front will promote pockets 
of rain and higher elevation snow from the northern Rockies to the 
mountains of Nevada. FOCUS: Sight Loss Meteorologists suffered partial 
blindness on Tuesday when a system failure occurred on the geostationary 
satellite that covers eastern North America, South America and the 
western Atlantic. The loss of sight was particularly serious since 
clear views of powerful Hurricane Mitch over the western Caribbean 
were no longer available. Some distorted pictures were available from 
a satellite stationed over the eastern Pacific as technicians attempted 
to remotely repair the ailing spacecraft. Meanwhile, reconnaissance 
aircraft transmitted vital details about the potentially devastating 
storm.
