Jordan's foreign minister said Tuesday that Syria is arbitrarily arresting 
and interrogating Jordanians and demanded more information on 500 
citizens who were either detained or reported missing in Syria. Foreign 
Minister Abdul-Illah Khatib said that if the arrests and interrogations 
continue, Jordan will issue a travel advisory warning ``our citizens 
to expect certain harassment and (bad) treatment'' in Syria. ``We 
don't accept that our citizens are detained on arrival at Syrian entry 
points and we don't accept that they are investigated, interrogated 
or asked to contact Syrian security departments,'' Khatib said. He 
said two Jordanian engineers arrested at the border on Sunday while 
en route to Lebanon were released a few hours later following extensive 
contacts with the Syrian government. ``They were freed on a condition 
that they go back to the same security office to continue interrogation 
later,'' he said. His remarks underline Jordan's growing frustration 
with worsening relations with its northern neighbor. Ties chilled 
after Amman signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. Syria says 
the treaty has weakened its bargaining position in peace negotiations 
with Israel. Khatib also demanded information on 500 Jordanians jailed 
without trial or reported missing in Syria. Several are government 
officials. ``We need to know the exact case of each and every Jordanian,'' 
he said, adding that two recent meetings with top-ranking Syrian officials 
were futile. Syria has not admitted that it holds any Jordanian detainees. 
Most of the detainees are believed to be either affiliated with Marxist 
Palestinian groups or Jordan's fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood Movement. 
Some are also believed to be members of the National Command of Syria's 
ruling Baath Party who were detained following the coup that brought 
President Hafez Assad to power in 1971. Earlier this month, the families 
of Jordanians detained in Syria held a peaceful demonstration in Amman 
to demand the release of their relatives. Khatib said his Egyptian 
counterpart, Amr Moussa, has offered to mediate the dispute. ``We 
welcomed that,'' he said. ``We have extended our hands to our Syrian 
brethren and we hope that they will respond positively.''
