Scientists at Durham University, in northern England said they have 
developed a new coating that can make clothes resistant to dirt and 
water. Its composition has not been made public, but the scientists 
say, it's so effective, only an invisible layer of material is needed. 
They say it can also be applied to other surfaces and could be used 
to produce longer lasting bank notes. From the BBC, this is Pamela 
McCall for The World.
