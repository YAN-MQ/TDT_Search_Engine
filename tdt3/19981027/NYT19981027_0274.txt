Ian McEwan, the British writer whose novels explore the ways that 
seemingly ordinary people can veer frighteningly out of control, was 
on Tuesday night awarded the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious 
literary award, for his latest work, ``Amsterdam.'' McEwan had been 
nominated for the prize twice before _ for ``The Comfort of Strangers,'' 
in 1981, and for ``Black Dogs,'' in 1992 _ and Tuesday night's award 
came as something of a surprise. ``Amsterdam'' received generally 
glowing reviews here, but several critics said McEwan has written 
better books. In winning the $34,000 prize, McEwan beat not only his 
close friend Julian Barnes, whose novel ``England, England'' had also 
made the five-book short list, but also Beryl Bainbridge, whose appearance 
on the short list this year was her fifth, for the novel ``Master 
Georgie.'' ``Amsterdam'' is the story of a strange euthanasia pact 
between two friends, a composer and a newspaper editor, whose relationship 
spins into disaster. In announcing the award, Douglas Hurd, the former 
Tory foreign secretary who served as the chairman of the five-judge 
panel this year, said that McEwan's book was ``a sardonic and wise 
examination of the morals and culture of our time.'' For his part, 
a glowing McEwan said at a news conference in London's Guildhall, 
where the award was presented, that he would probably spend the prize 
money on ``something perfectly useless,'' so that it wouldn't be frittered 
away on things like ``bus fare and linoleum.'' The Booker is awarded 
each year to a novel written by a Briton or a citizen of the Commonwealth, 
including the Caribbean, Australia and Canada. Other finalists were 
``Breakfast on Pluto,'' by the Irish author Patrick McCabe; ``Industry 
of Souls'' by Martin Booth, and ``The Restraint of Beasts'' by Magnus 
Mills, a London bus driver.
