Islamic Gehad, a Palestinian faction opposed to the Arab Israeli peace 
process, is accusing Israel of being behind the car bomb explosion 
Tuesday which wounded one of its leaders in the Lebanese port city 
of Siden. The man's wife, son, and a passer-by also were injured in 
the explosion. Edward Uranian reports from Beirut. Tensions flared 
Tuesday in the port city of Siden after a booby-trapped car exploded 
on the coastal highway. Wounding the local chief of an extremist Palestinian 
group. Machmud Macazub, a leader of the Damascus -based Islamic Gehad 
had just fled the car with this family when the explosion took place, 
causing shrapnel to fly and throwing flames into the air. Booby-trapped 
cars are a traditional method of liquidating opponents in Lebanon. 
A spokesman for Islamic Gehad told the French press agency that Israel 
was behind the explosion which he linked to the Israeli Palestinian 
accord signed last week in the United States. That accord calls on 
the Palestinian authority to take security measures against fundamentalist 
groups. Amaf of Islamic Gehad bitterly opposed the peace process. 
Ian Helwee, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Southern Lebanon 
is a hot bed of various Palestinian factions. Colonel Muniamukna, 
the camp's commander, recently reconciled with Palestinian authority, 
Chairman Yasser Arafat. The Lebanese government has little control 
over Ian Helwee, which has been the scene of internal clashes between 
Palestinian factions, as well as clashes with government troops. Most 
of Lebanon's 12 Palestinian refugee camps are controlled by factions 
close to Damascus, which is critical of the peace process. Ramadan 
Shalah, leader of Islamic Gehad has been based in Damascus since the 
1995 sleighing in Balta of his predecessor, Fathi Shikopi. Edward 
Uranian for VOA News, Beirut.
