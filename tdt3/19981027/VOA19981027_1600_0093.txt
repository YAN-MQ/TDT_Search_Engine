Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, has checked into a sanatorium to 
recover from, what doctors are calling, extreme fatigue and erratic 
blood pressure. Mr. Yeltsin entered the Barveka Sanatorium near Moscow 
Tuesday, one day after doctors ordered him to cancel his trip to a 
European union meeting in Vienna. Prime Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, 
went instead. Meanwhile, presidential hopeful, Communist leader, Ganadi 
Zugonov has repeated his call for Mr. Yeltsin's immediate resignation 
for the good of Russia.
