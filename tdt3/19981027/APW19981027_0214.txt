Although thousands of kilometers (miles) apart, Cambodia and Mozambique 
share a major problem: decades of war have left millions of land mines 
buried in their soil. Mine clearance organizations from the two nations, 
as well as other mine-infested countries around the world, were brought 
together Tuesday for a rare opportunity to share field techniques 
of the humanitarian trade. On the second day of an international conference 
on land mine issues, more than 100 participants abandoned Phnom Penh 
hotel conference rooms and boarded buses for a tour of the Cambodian 
Mine Action Center's training facility 90 kilometers (56 miles) north 
of the Cambodian capital. Jose Amibal de Almeida, director of Mozambique's 
Accelerated Demining Program, watched intently at the training center 
as CMAC officials showed off an array of mine detection and clearance 
methods. CMAC's display included traditional manual clearing methods, 
dogs trained to sniff out mines and a mechanical ``mine flail'' that 
can clear swaths of land in a fraction of the time it takes by hand. 
``What we are fighting for in Mozambique is to have the best integrated 
system of mine clearance between dogs and mechanical and manual methods,'' 
de Almeida said after the demonstrations. Delegates from Nicaragua, 
Angola, Laos and Sri Lanka also attended the presentation of what 
is considered one of the world's most advanced mine clearing operations. 
Between 4 million and 6 million mines are estimated to be buried inside 
Cambodia's borders, deadly reminders of the decades of war that tailed 
off with the signing of a 1991 peace treaty. Mozambique's civil war 
left 2 million to 3 million mines remaining in its soil. CMAC director 
Sam Sotha hailed the conference in Cambodia as a departure from others 
held in developed cities like Tokyo or Ottawa that are mostly a forum 
for promoting international mine awareness and donor support. ``This 
conference is not for the purpose of pledges, it is to share the knowledge 
with our colleagues from other infested countries,'' he said at the 
training center. Delegates from Mozambique said mine clearance standards 
in their country were on par with CMAC's, but that Cambodia had a 
clear advantage in infrastructure and equipment, perhaps because of 
the greater international attention its conflict received. ``This 
reinforces that we must have international support for our operation. 
We cannot do it alone,'' said Armando Joao, a mine clearer from Mozambique. 
A spirited discussion at the opening of the conference Monday focused 
on mine clearance cooperation among countries in the southern hemisphere, 
de Almeida said. That spirit appeared to have carried over into Tuesday's 
tour, he said, as Africans and Central Americans discussed Cambodia's 
presentation over lunch. ``We really feel the need for `south-south' 
cooperation, to have a real exchange of information between mine-infested 
countries,'' he said.
