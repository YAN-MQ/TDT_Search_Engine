Four years ago, people interviewed in this bedroom community of stucco 
houses, strip malls and independent-minded voters expressed deep disappointment 
with President Clinton and complained vehemently about declining wages, 
rising taxes and worsening crime. Two years ago, the bitterness about 
Clinton had receded as voters raised concerns about Republican presidential 
nominee Bob Dole and said his party was too extreme. Now, dozens of 
random interviews on the eve of another election show that the outlook 
of voters here had shifted yet again: They do not seem exercised about 
anything. In a startling contrast to past years, voter after voter 
could not name a single burning issue that weighed heavily on them. 
They could not muster enthusiasm for any candidate. They were sick 
of hearing about Monica Lewinsky, and the talk of impeachment exasperated 
them even more. The only political matters on their minds, if any, 
were the most local of issues, like school board elections. ``There's 
nothing that affects me so much that I've got to vote on it,'' said 
Cathy Scharwark, a 35-year-old math teacher who is an independent. 
``My life on Nov. 4 is going to be the same as on Nov. 3. I don't 
see how voting one way will change it.'' It is voters like those in 
this fast-growing region, 75 miles east of Los Angeles, where many 
people have no deep political roots or traditions, who are confounding, 
and even causing alarm, among Democratic and Republican strategists. 
This close to the elections, candidates say they are still struggling, 
with little success, to identify issues that engage the public. As 
a result, they are aiming their appeals at a narrow, and not particularly 
representative, slice of the electorate that is considered most likely 
to vote. That is why Democratic consultant Rich Neimand has likened 
this campaign season to the ``Seinfeld'' television program. He says 
it is about nothing in particular. This middle-class sprawl of seemingly 
endless suburbs, called the ``Inland Empire'' is not usually a haven 
of apathy. In fact, it is a pivotal area that pollsters watch closely 
for hints of possible mood swings in the American electorate. In interviews 
in past years, voters here were rarely at a loss for words about their 
personal agenda, or politicians they supported or reviled. But not 
this month. As she watched over her two little girls at a pumpkin 
patch here, Cindy Taylor, a 31-year-old homemaker who is a Republican, 
was asked what she considered the big issues this year. ``Refresh 
my memory _ tell me a couple,'' she pleaded gently. ''There's nothing 
that pops straight in my head.'' Asked the same question, Brian van 
den Burg, a 20-year-old business student who is an independent, said, 
``Gee, nothing in particular.'' A Democrat, Gene Provost, who is a 
66-year-old electronics technician, quizzed his questioner, ``Do you 
have any issues in particular?'' David Waltemeyer, 34, a fire captain 
who is a Republican, did come up with a ready answer. But it was not 
about weighty issues. ``Safe and sane fireworks,'' he said, explaining 
that he was rankled by a ballot measure which would legalize fireworks. 
Waltemeyer, who was cheering his son at soccer practice, said he was 
stumped to come up with any bigger issues, saying his usual fears 
about the economy had been calmed. ``This year there's been something 
of a recovery,'' he said. ``Things here have really turned around 
in the last 12 months.'' Only a few years ago this area, once blanketed 
by orange groves, was sprinkled with foreclosed homes, the outgrowth 
of the economic downturn and large military cutbacks in the area. 
Now, the economy has rebounded somewhat and people are more content, 
and not particularly moved by anything that is happening in Washington. 
``I'm pretty happy with the way things are going,'' said Andy Stetkevich, 
39, a Democrat who is a staff development official for the local school 
district. ``I realize there's a lot that's going on in Washington. 
But if we looked at all of Washington and dug into all of the scandals, 
there might not be anybody to vote for.'' Almost no one mentioned 
the White House scandal. When asked about it, virtually everyone offered 
similar answers: They had heard enough _ in many cases, too much _ 
about Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Though they condemned 
Clinton's conduct, they had more pressing things to worry about, and 
they did not think the president should resign or be impeached. ``They 
need to leave him alone,'' said Carol Simpson, 31, a cosmetics saleswoman 
who votes Democratic. ``If Hillary can handle it, if she's happy with 
it, that's her husband.'' Ms. Simpson's husband, Pierre, 35, a Republican, 
agreed: ``He's only got two more years in there anyway.'' Voter after 
voter said the scandal would have no impact on how they voted. ``It 
doesn't affect how I feel about Democrats,'' said Diane Rowley, 43, 
a homemaker who is a Republican. ``What he did is what he did.'' Ella 
Ramirez, 49, an unemployed electronics worker who is a Democrat, said, 
``You can't blame it on anyone else but him. He's his own person.'' 
Of the dozens of people interviewed, only Eric Nielsen, 41, a Democrat 
who said he had voted twice for Clinton, said the president's conduct 
would affect how he voted for every candidate on the ballot. Nielsen, 
who is the kind of voter that many pundits expected to see more of, 
said he intended to vote ``across the board for non-Democrats,'' not 
because he is enamored of Republicans, but because he is so enraged 
at Clinton. ``What he did is his own personal business,'' said Nielsen, 
a construction designer. ``But he told a stupid, silly lie. How can 
you believe anything he says? It's impossible at this point.'' But 
even Nielsen's indignation goes only so far. ``Impeachment seems silly,'' 
he said. Another Democrat, Greg Davis, said the scandal would cause 
him to oppose Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat being challenged by state 
Treasurer Matt Fong. While Davis said he was not particularly bothered 
by Clinton's personal behavior, he said Ms. Boxer had aggressively 
opposed Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court because of 
accusations of sexual harassment but has been relatively quiet about 
the president. (Ms. Boxer's daughter is married to a brother of Hillary 
Rodham Clinton.) ``She was so tough on Clarence Thomas,'' said Davis, 
37, who designs air-conditioning systems. ``That's hypocritical.'' 
Davis was one of the few people who even mentioned a particular candidate. 
Most admitted not knowing much, if anything, about the Senate candidates 
or the candidates for governor, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, and 
state Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican. The issue that drew 
a trace of passion was a state ballot measure that would allow broad 
expansion of casino-style gaming on Indian lands throughout the state. 
The proposal has been the subject of endless commercials on television, 
and many people interviewed said the tribes deserved to have the casinos 
after years of mistreatment. ``Leave the Indians alone!'' Randy Jones, 
46, a Republican who was having a slow day selling pumpkins, said 
in a refrain that came up in several interviews. ``Let them have their 
casinos!'' Unlike many other residents here, Dee Preston, a 24-year-old 
Democrat who is studying business as California State University, 
blurted out several crucial concerns. But, she complained, all she 
hears about is Ms. Lewinsky. ``It's always on the TV for no reason 
at all. Just like O.J. Simpson,'' she said. ``Even on Christmas they're 
going to talk about what that man did to his wife. Leave the man alone. 
Let's get some real news news: Kids getting murdered. The homeless. 
Kids getting kidnapped.'' While Ms. Preston still intends to vote, 
back at the pumpkin patch, Jones, asked if he planned to go to the 
polls, said, ``If they catch me.''
