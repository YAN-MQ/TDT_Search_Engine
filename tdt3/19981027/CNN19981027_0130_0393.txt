The state department is warning Libya that it may face tougher sanctions 
if it does not allow two Libyans wanted for the bombing of Pan Am 
Flight 103 to stand trial in the Netherlands. The 1988 bombing killed 
all 259 people on board. In July, the U.S. and Britain proposed a 
compromise that would allow the two suspects to be tried by a Scottish 
judge in the Netherlands. Libya was placed under U.N. sanctions in 
1992 to try and force it to hand over the men.
