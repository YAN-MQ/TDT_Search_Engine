On a warm late afternoon in August 1920 a bunch of boys stood outside 
Comiskey Park in Chicago, waiting under the stands for their heroes, 
the White Sox players, to emerge after a game. One of those boys would 
become an important American novelist, James T. Farrell. Young Jim, 
then 16, was an avid fan and he, like several of the others, couldn't 
believe the headlines that had just broken. Eight of their idols had 
been charged with intentionally losing the previous fall's World Series 
to the Cincinnati Reds (five games to three in a best-of-nine series). 
One of them was the greatest of contemporary stars, Shoeless Joe Jackson, 
who still owns the third-highest career batting average in baseball 
history, at .356. Farrell, who died in 1979, once told me what happened 
on that day in 1920: He watched the players come out of the clubhouse. 
Jackson appeared ``sportively'' dressed in gray silk shirt, white 
duck trousers and white shoes, his face ``masked in passivity.'' Farrell 
heard a fan call out, ``Say it ain't true, Joe.'' And again, hauntingly, 
``It ain't true, Joe.'' Then Big Joe Jackson got into his ``sportive'' 
roadster and drove through a double file of silent fans. Farrell emphasized 
that he did not hear, ``Say it ain't so, Joe,'' the rhyming lamentation 
that has inspired a raft of articles, books and movies, from ``The 
Natural'' to ``Eight Men Out'' to the cloyingly sentimental ``Field 
of Dreams,'' which portrayed a gauzy comeback in a latter-day Iowa 
cornfield by Joe. The ``fix'' was a seminal event in American history, 
one that ended, to many, the Age of Innocence. And the lesson learned 
then is one that we are reminded of today, that baseball stars, like 
Presidents, may have tragic flaws. The fascination with Joe Jackson 
and the Black Sox will again be in evidence at a sports memorabilia 
auction Tuesday at Christie's in New York. Items will include Jackson's 
legal correspondence regarding his banishment from baseball (estimated 
price: $20,000 to $30,000), his signed driver's license (estimate: 
$15,000 to $20,000) as well as his business card ($3,000 to $5,000) 
and photographs like the one showing Jackson behind the cash register 
in the liquor store he owned in middle age in his hometown, Greenville, 
S.C. None of those are expected to be the most expensive item in the 
auction. That distinction goes to a circa 1910 baseball card of the 
Hall of Fame shortstop Honus Wagner of the Pirates ($350,000 to $400,000). 
The baseball that Mark McGwire hit for his 50th home run this season 
will also be auctioned ($12,000 to $15,000). Other memorabilia on 
sale include an official American League baseball signed by Marilyn 
Monroe (about $20,000) and one signed by John F. Kennedy on opening 
day in 1962 (around $10,000). Not for sale are any of the baseball 
shoes that Shoeless Joe wore. A pair of them, however, are in a case 
in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Joe got his nickname 
after he removed his tight-fitting shoes in a minor-league game and 
played in stocking feet. It contributed, though, to the image of him 
as an illiterate _ which he was (though he could apparently sign his 
name) _ and a rube, which he may not have been altogether. After all, 
Jackson had been around: he was a sharp dresser, demanded and got 
a drawing room for road trips, and was 30 years old and a 12-year 
major-league veteran at the time of the 1919 World Series. In ``Field 
of Dreams,'' the question is posed: ``Shoeless Joe Jackson batted 
.375 in the Series, hit the only home run and didn't make an error. 
How could he have thrown the Series.'' Until his death in 1951 at 
age 63, Joseph Jefferson Jackson _ though he confessed to taking $5,000 
from gamblers and was admittedly disturbed when he didn't get the 
other $15,000 they had promised _ proclaimed his innocence. But his 
testimony to the grand jury in Cook County, Illinois, on Sept. 28, 
1920 was sometimes conflicting, and the end result was damaging to 
him. He was banned from professional baseball for life by baseball's 
commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis. ``I am the left fielder for 
the Sox,'' Jackson said when taking the stand. ``When a Cincinnati 
player would bat a ball out in my territory, I'd muff it if I could. 
But if it would look too much like crooked work to do that, I'd be 
slow and would make a throw to the infield that would be too short. 
``My work netted the Cincinnati team several runs that they would 
never have made if I had been playing on the square.'' Later, he was 
asked what he did after not being paid as expected after the first 
game of the Series. Answer: ``I asked Gandil what is the trouble?'' 
(The reference was to Chick Gandil, the White Sox first baseman). 
``He says, `Everything is all right.' He had it.'' Q: ``Then you went 
ahead and threw the second game, thinking you would get it then, is 
that right?'' A: ``We went ahead and threw the second game.'' Jim 
Farrell said that the Black Sox scandal ``marked the end of my hero-worshiping 
baseball players.'' Every generation seems to gets its dose of stunning 
imperfections from those we place in exalted positions. Ours is no 
different. The auction at Christie's reflects just such a tragic and 
poignant example, one that centered on a baseball diamond as opposed 
to an oval office.
