Richard Leakey, the world-renowned paleontologist, resigned Tuesday 
from parliament, saying his job as director of Kenya's wildlife services 
is incompatible with legislative duties. Last month, President Daniel 
arap Moi chose Leakey to head the cash-strapped organization, which 
is charged with the protection of wildlife in the east African country. 
A third-generation Kenyan of British origin, Leakey was pushed out 
by Moi in 1994 as head of the same wildlife program _ which oversees 
the country's chief tourism asset _ in a dispute over political control. 
Leakey told a news conference Tuesday that he ``hand-delivered the 
letter to the speaker this morning notifying him I have resigned.'' 
Leakey had been nominated to the 222-member parliament by his opposition 
Safina Party. Safina leader Paul Muite said the party has nominated 
Josephine Odiro Sinyo, who is blind, to replace Leakey, who uses artificial 
legs since an aircraft accident some years ago. Sinyo, who holds masters 
degree in law, said she will articulate issues affecting Kenya's women 
and the disabled.
