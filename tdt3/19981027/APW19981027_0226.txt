Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. abandoned a plan Tuesday to 
prevent a hostile takeover, in what analysts believe is a prelude 
to a foreign company taking a sizable stake in the country's largest 
telecommunications company. After months of speculation, the only 
serious contender for a sizable stake in PLDT appears to be Hong Kong-based 
holding group First Pacific Co., which already has substantial interests 
in the Philippines, the analysts said. In dropping the ``poison pill'' 
plan, PLDT said it considered the need to protect the interests of 
minority shareholders and what it termed ``the free play of market 
forces.'' Recent gains in PLDT's share price have been spurred by 
expectations that First Pacific, which also has other telecommunications 
holdings in Asia, has management control in its sights. ``It's a win-win 
situation,'' said Edward Teodoro, an analyst at Securities 2000 Inc., 
noting that buying into PLDT would strengthen First Pacific's presence 
in the telecommunications sector. PLDT would benefit from fresh strategies 
that would be implemented by a new management, added Neil Juggins, 
Paribas Asia Equity Securities Inc.'s Singapore-based telecommunications 
analyst. No mention of First Pacific or any other bidder was made 
in PLDT's brief statement on scuttling the plan. PLDT's shares closed 
at 940 pesos (dlrs 22.80), up 10 pesos. Its shares have swung wildly 
since Sept. 3, when management announced a plan to sell discounted 
shares to existing investors should an outsider acquire more than 
10 percent of the voting stock. The plan would punish predators by 
diluting the value of their holdings. Teodoro said the market has 
fully discounted the rumors of an agreement between PLDT and First 
Pacific, and it is unlikely the stock will see any further gains. 
Even confirmation from First Pacific that it intends to acquire a 
large stake in PLDT is unlikely to provide a strong boost to the stock, 
other analysts said. First Pacific has declined to comment on the 
rumors, which focus on the Hong-Kong group buying into PLDT by acquiring 
shares held by the Philippine government. The Social Security System, 
a state pension fund, holds 10.3 percent of PLDT, and it is understood 
other government agencies also have stakes in the company. PLDT's 
biggest shareholder is the Philippine Telecommunications Investment 
Corp., which holds an estimated 21 percent stake in PLDT. PTIC is 
owned by the family of PLDT President Antonio Cojuangco. Those shares, 
however, were seized by the government of Corazon Aquino in the late 
1980s on allegations that the Cojuangco family was holding the PLDT 
shares for former dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The government has not 
included its PTIC stake among the state holdings earmarked for privatization 
since the shares are the subject of an ownership dispute. A shakeup 
in PLDT's management is expected by analysts if First Pacific ends 
up with a substantial stake in the company.
