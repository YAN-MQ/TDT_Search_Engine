And two notes from space in the final two minutes of this hour. The 
countdown began on Monday for an unprecedented mission in the U.S. 
Space Program. Pioneering astronaut, John Glenn, 77 years old, flies 
back into space 36 years after he became the first American to orbit 
the earth. On this mission, launching Thursday, he aims to become 
the oldest person ever in space, and he will undergo a variety of 
medical tests. Senator Glenn and the rest of the shuttle crew arrived 
at the launch site in Cape Canaveral, Florida to prepare for the launch.
