Residents of Hong Kong have their eyes on what could be their trial 
of the century. Mike Chinoy has the story. The kingpin of crime in 
Hong Kong, on trial in a heavily guarded courtroom in southern China. 
Cheung tse-keung, nicknamed "big spender," has been charged, along 
with 31 accomplices, with the most sensational kidnappings in Hong 
Kong history. His victims -- two of the richest men in the world -- 
property magnate walter kwok, whose family runs the sun hung Kai development 
company, and victor Li, son of Hong Kong's wealthiest tycoon, billionaire 
Li Ka shing. Reluctant to involve the police, the families of the 
victims reportedly paid a ransom of over $200 million to win their 
release. In a city where flaunting wealth is a favorite pastime, the 
kidnappings highlighted the growing boldness of a new breed of gangsters, 
whose criminal exploits have made them the stuff of local legend. 
As big spender's trial began, a hastily produced movie, glorifying 
his criminal career, opened at local theaters. "He's not only a criminal, 
he's a genius," says director Andy Ng. "People admire his brains. 
No crime in the world can match the ransom he got for those kidnappings." 
But after a string of violent crimes in Hong Kong and across the border 
in southern China, big spender's luck ran out this summer, when he 
was arrested by Chinese police. He's a classic bad guy whose ego eventually 
outperformed his ability to deliver. There's been some concern expressed 
here about big spender being tried under China's secretive legal system 
for crimes allegedly committed in Hong Kong. But that's unlikely to 
affect the outcome, which is almost certain to be a Verdict of guilty 
and a sentence of death. And a swift execution. Mike Chinoy, CNN, 
Hong Kong.
