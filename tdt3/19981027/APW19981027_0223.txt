Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma arrived Tuesday for an official two-day 
visit. He is to meet with President Arpad Goencz, Prime Minister Viktor 
Orban and other dignitaries, as well as visit Szekesfehervar, Hungary's 
``Silicon Valley,'' where he will look up the Philips and Videoton 
plants. The Ukraine become independent with the breakup of the Soviet 
Union, but economically remains closely tied to the east. ``Forty 
percent of Ukraine's foreign trade is with Russia, so it's difficult 
to distance ourselves from the impact of the Russian crisis,'' Kuchma 
told Magyar Nemzet, a Budapest daily in an interview Monday. The situation 
makes it imperative for the Ukraine to seek to open to the West.``We 
do not need credits, but access to markets,'' Kuchma told the daily. 
Hungary enjoyed a trade surplus of dlrs 5.3 million with the Ukraine 
in the first eight months of this year, while last year there was 
a deficit of dlrs 69 million. Seven bilateral agreements are to be 
signed during Kuchma's visit.
