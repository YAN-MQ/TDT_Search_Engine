Family members of Dr. Barnett slepian spoke publicly today for the 
first since his killing. The obstetrician was shot Friday by a sniper 
who fired a high-powered rifle into the doctor's upstate New York 
home. Investigators believe slepian was targeted because he performed 
abortions. His brother says it's hard to understand the loss. Seeing 
that it ended this way, I know how my brother struggled in his early 
years, financially, to get his education and build up his practice, 
and now just at the point where he was enjoying a fine practice, his 
sons were all developing into fine young men, he had a wonderful wife, 
just to have his life snuffed out after all these years of work, getting 
to this point in life and then wipes out completely. Slepian was the 
first doctor killed in four similar attacks that have occurred in 
that area around the same time every year since 1994.
