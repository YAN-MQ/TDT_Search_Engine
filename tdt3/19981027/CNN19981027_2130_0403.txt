President Clinton today signed a Bill that would redirect federal 
funds for "Head start," a preschool program. The Bill designates 60% 
of new funding for the program must be used to improve quality. Previously 
75% of new "head start" funding went to enrolling more children. The 
Bill also creates a test program to allow 50,000 low-income families 
to save money with a dollar-for-dollar government match.
