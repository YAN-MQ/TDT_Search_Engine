The category 5 storm is 90 miles north of the Honduran coast, moving 
west at about six miles an hour. Its maximum sustained winds have 
dropped slightly to 165 miles an hour. Daryn Kagan reports the people 
in harm's way are preparing for Mitch's fury. Honduras is bracing 
for a powerful punch from Mitch. One of the strongest hurricanes ever 
recorded in the atlantic. Steady rain and wind yesterday sent residents 
on the north coast sturying for higher ground. Others headed for the 
stores. Stocking up on food, water, and other necessities. The president 
has declared a state of alert, closing schools and public offices, 
and mobilizing troops. Mexico's Yucatan peninsula is also under the 
gun. Workers in the resort city of cancun spent the night boarding 
store fronts. Still, many tourists spent the evening on the town, 
refusing to let Mitch spoil their good time. We're here, they can't 
kick us out! I've never been through one so I don't know what to expect, 
actually. I'm intrigued more than scared. But there's reason to be 
scared. Look at what Mitch did in Jack make Ka. Raindrops the size 
of bullets turned Kingston's streets into rivers. The region hasn't 
seen a storm like Mitch in a decade. In 1988, Gilbert developed into 
a category 5 storm. It left more than 300 people dead. Darrin Kagan, 
"Headline News."
