Russia Prime Minister Yevgenie Primikov has presented his plans for 
dealing with Russia's economic crisis to a meeting with European Union 
leaders in Austria. He took the place of ailing President Boris Yeltsin, 
who is resting at a Moscow Sanitorium. Angus Roxborough, in Vienna, 
has more details. President Yeltsin had originally intended to spend 
two days in Vienna with European leaders. Then the visit was downgraded 
to one day. And finally called off all together, as Mr. Yeltsin was 
ordered by doctors to rest. His Prime Minister, Yuvginie Primikov 
was sent instead with a mandate to negotiate on the president's behalf. 
But it turned out to be an insubstantial affair. Mr. Primakov's talks 
with EU representatives lasted barely two hours, scarcely long enough 
for them to assess whether his program to pull Russia out of its economic 
crisis was plausible. Angus Roxborough, BBC, Vienna.
