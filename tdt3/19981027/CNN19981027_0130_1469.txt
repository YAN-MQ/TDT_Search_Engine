Some celebrities are dressing up now that halloween is drawing near, 
but it's not to go trick-or-treating. In Santa Monica over the weekend, 
Elizabeth Taylor posed with a one of a Kind Barbie fashioned in her 
likeness. It was later auctioned for $25,000 at a halloween fund-raiser 
benefitting children with AIDS. Jamie Lee Curtis hosted the event. 
Beverly Hills was the site of another dressed-up charity event. Geena 
Davis, Jennifer Tilly and Jenny McCarthy were among the celebrities 
at the carousel of hope ball. The event raised money to fight juvenile 
diabetes.
