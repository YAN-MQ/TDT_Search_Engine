At my grandfather's pastry shop in Nice, there was always a large 
selection of sweets that were called ``mamie cakes'' because they 
were the favorites of that French city's grandmothers, the ``mamies'' 
who took up teatime as a daily treat. Any cake that didn't have cream, 
custard or mousse was a mamie cake (it's pronounced ma-MEE, with the 
``a'' as in mat). It wasn't until I was older that I learned that 
these mamie cakes have a real name. Pastry chefs call them ``gateaux 
secs,'' or dry cakes, and the category includes anything from a cookie 
to a kugelhopf, the ultimate coffee cake. And as you'll see from this 
recipe, the word dry has nothing to do with consistency or texture. 
This particular mamie cake _ it's really a tart, but my grandfather 
always called it a cake _ is filled with fresh sweet pineapple and 
is topped with a macaroonlike layer of coconut, the ``coco'' in the 
name. It was one of the first cakes I learned to make (I started making 
it for my grandfather when I was 13), and it's one I continue to make, 
delighted to find it has fans of every age. The Coco-Mamie is made 
in a pate sucree, or sweet tart crust. The crust, mixed in the food 
processor, is soft and crumbly and is itself the stuff of great cookies. 
It's easiest to work after it's been chilled. If crusts have frightened 
you in the past, try this one: perfection is not required. In fact, 
unlike most crusts, this one should be rolled fairly thick. And because 
the cake's topping is spread all the way to the edge of the crust 
_ even beyond _ there's no need to worry about the edges being exactly 
even. Certainly, there's no fluting or fussing. The topping is made 
in a minute by hand. Baked, it will remind you of the best coconut 
macaroons _ moist, chewy and not too sweet. The sweetness in this 
cake comes from the pineapple. If your pineapple is great, your Coco-Mamie 
will be great. That is the key to success. My first choice is pineapples 
from Costa Rica.They're supersweet, and since I use the fruit in its 
natural state, sweetness counts. If you can't get a soft, golden pineapple 
with that wonderful ripe perfume, you can try doctoring the best pineapple 
you can find by sauteeing it in butter, a little sugar and the scraped-out 
pulp of a fresh vanilla bean. Or in a pinch, you can use well-drained 
canned pineapple. You may love this cake for the same reason my busy 
pastry-chef grandfather did: while it's best the day it's made, it 
keeps for a day. With a few Coco-Mamie cakes in the display case, 
he had time to make perishable cream puffs; you may have time to invite 
Mamie to tea. COCO-MAMIE CAKE Time: 1 hour, plus 2 hours for freezing 
For the crust: 9 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 
1 cup all-purpose flour { cup confectioners' sugar { teaspoon salt 
1 large egg, lightly beaten For the filling: { small pineapple, cut 
into tiny dice, about 2 cups 3{ tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 
{ cup sugar 1{ cups finely shredded unsweetened coconut (available 
in health-food stores) 1 large egg, lightly beaten. 1. To make the 
crust, put the butter, flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food 
processor, and process until the ingredients are well blended. Scrape 
down the sides of the bowl, and add the egg. Process just until the 
egg is completely incorporated; you will have a very soft, creamy 
dough. Remove the dough, flatten it out into a disk shape, wrap it 
in plastic and freeze for 1 hour. 2. Butter an 8-inch round fluted 
metal tart pan, 1\ inches high, with a removable bottom, and place 
it on a baking sheet. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the 
dough into a circle about [ inch thick. Fit the dough into the pan, 
and trim off the excess, level with the top of the pan. 3. Spread 
the pineapple evenly along the bottom of the crust, and return the 
crust to the freezer for about an hour. At the end of that time, preheat 
the oven to 350 degrees. 4. To make the filling, blend the butter 
and sugar together, working with a rubber spatula. Stir in the coconut, 
and when it is well blended, incorporate the egg. Still using the 
spatula, spread the filling evenly over the frozen pineapple, pressing 
down lightly on the fruit to get the filling into the crevices. Spread 
the filling all the way to the edge of the crust. Slide the cake into 
the oven, and bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the crust is baked 
through and the filling is golden brown and firmly set on top. Transfer 
the cake to a rack, and cool. Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
