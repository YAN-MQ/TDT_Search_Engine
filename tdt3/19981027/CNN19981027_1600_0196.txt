Other news now -- Hurricane Mitch has weakened, but with top sustained 
winds of 155 miles an hour, it is still a very strong storm. Mitch 
is centered about 125 miles northeast of Honduras. The now-category 
four hurricane is expected to continue its westward movement for the 
next 24 hours. Honduras is getting rain, as people there prepare for 
the storm. Forecasters warn up to 15 inches of rain could fall there, 
triggering flooding and mudslides. Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize, 
on the Yucatan peninsula, are under a Hurricane warning.
