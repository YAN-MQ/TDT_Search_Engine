The New York Mets have signed all-star catcher, Mike Piazza to a multiyear 
contract worth $91 million, making him the highest paid player in 
major league baseball history. Piazza's seven-year deal will pay him 
an average of $13 million per season. Eclipsing the six-year, $75 
million deal signed last year by Boston Red Sox pitcher, Pedro Martinez. 
After spending most of his career with the Los Angeles Dodgers, 30 
year-old Piazza was acquired from the Florida Marlins in May. He earned 
$8 million this season in the final year of a two-year contract. Piazza 
says he had hoped to put down roots in New York. I am just very, very 
excited and it was definitely had some growing pains getting here. 
It was an adjustment to come here, but once I was here and once I 
went through the ups and downs of being here and the challenge of 
being in New York, I knew I wanted to finish my career here. Catcher, 
Mike Piazza, had been eligible to file for free agency since Thursday 
and was in the midst of an exclusive 15-day period when only the Mets 
were able to sign him.
