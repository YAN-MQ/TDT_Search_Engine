Time for a look at the weather across the country. For that we go 
to WNBC, meteorologist Janice huff. Good evening. You had a picture 
perfect day for the shuttle launch. The weather in Florida, fabulous 
and Mitch not causing problems. There's a vantage point. Look at the 
clear skies in Florida. There is tropical storm Mitch, still spinning 
over the inland areas of Honduras. Winds at 60 miles per hour and 
the storm still sitting there. It's drifted a little to the southeast, 
more inland. That's why it continues to weaken. If it should drift 
back out to the center over the ocean, it could restrengthen. We'll 
watch if. Tropical storm warnings remain in effect along the coast 
of the yurek tan to Nicaragua. The warnings have been diminished. 
Now you're looking at strong thunderstorms moving across the central 
plains of the U.S. they've had reports of hail in Missouri and Iowa. 
The temperatures are a little on the mild side ahead of that system. 
58 in Chicago and 70 in St. Louis but in the 40's in Denver and 30's 
and 20's in Montana. Tonight it will be cold over the northern Rockies 
with teens and 20's for overnight lows. You'll see highs in the 80's 
from the gulf coast down to Miami. Warm over the southern states with 
40's and 50's in New England. Boston with 55. 66 in Washington tomorrow. 
68, Chicago. Showers in Denver. Phoenix, 72. As we take you ahead 
in time, you'll notice the jet stream takes a little bit of a dip 
across the northeast on Sunday. That's going to be the day of the 
New York City marathon. Temperatures will be cool, but a mix of sun 
and clouds. It should be perfect running weather. Sunny skies expected 
across the southern states. Showers in the pacific northwest. It looks 
like the trick-or-treaters will have nice weather in the southern 
states but dress in layers to the north. That's the weather around 
the nation.
