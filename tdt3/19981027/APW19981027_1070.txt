In a show of force, Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction shut down several 
West Bank towns Tuesday to push for the trial and execution of Palestinian 
intelligence agents who killed a young Fatah activist in a clash this 
week. In the West Bank town of Nablus, hundreds of Fatah activists 
filled the streets and burned tires. Several marchers fired their 
weapons in the air. Fatah also enforced strikes in the towns of Bethlehem, 
Tulkarem and in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Shops were shuttered 
and students were told to leave their schools. The dispute began Sunday 
when members of the Palestinian military intelligence raided the Fatah 
headquarters in the town of Ramallah and seized weapons and files. 
A Fatah activist, 16-year-old Wassim Tarifi, was shot and killed by 
intelligence agents during subsequent rock-throwing protests. Fatah 
leaders want Tarifi's killers to be tried and executed. They also 
seek the ouster of the head of military intelligence, Moussa Arafat, 
a distant relative of the Palestinian leader. At a press conference 
in Ramallah, Arafat said he would not resign unless asked to by the 
Palestinian leader. He said he ordered his men into the Fatah office 
not in search for weapons but to find several fugitives. He denied 
members of his force fired the bullet which killed Tarifi and blamed 
the death on shots fired from the crowd. ``There were no orders given 
to members of the military intelligence to open fire at the protesters,'' 
he said. Several men from his force were being detained and questioned 
in the shooting. Despite following their commander's orders, the four 
officers who entered the Fatah building were court marshaled in Jericho 
Tuesday on charges of violating the sanctity of the Fatah office and 
harming national unity. The face a maximum penalty of three years 
in jail and sentencing was scheduled for Wednesday. Palestinian leader 
Arafat is abroad and will return later Wednesday. He needs Fatah's 
support to shape public opinion and is expected to move quickly to 
quell the growing rebellion of his loyalists. A senior Arafat aide, 
Tayeb Abdel Rahim, said that Arafat has already ordered the establishment 
of a special military tribunal that would investigate the case and 
try the suspected shooters. However, no one has been arrested yet 
in Tarifi's death. In a similar case in August, Arafat complied with 
Fatah demands and ordered the execution of two Palestinian policemen 
who had killed two of the group's activists in a personal feud.
