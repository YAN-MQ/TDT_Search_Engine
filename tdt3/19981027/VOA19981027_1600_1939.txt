Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, has been hospitalized just one day 
after he was forced to cancel a trip to Vienna because of exhaustion. 
More from VOA'S Peter Heimline in Moscow. President Yeltsin was moved 
from his country residence outside the city to the nearby Barvika 
Sanatorium Tuesday morning. The sanatorium is a well-equipped medical 
facility where the 67 year-old Russian leader recovered from heart 
bypass surgery two years ago. A spokesman says the length of Mr. Yeltsin's 
stay will depend on how quickly he recovers from what doctors are 
calling extreme fatigue and erratic blood pressure. The condition 
forced cancellation of a one-day trip to Vienna that had been scheduled 
for today. Prime Minister, Yevgeny Primakov is attending the Vienna 
meetings instead. Mr. Yeltsin's recurring health problems have cast 
fresh doubt on his ability to remain in office. He was forced to cut 
short a visit to Central Asia last week because of what was described 
as bronchitis. During the trip, he stumbled during a welcoming ceremony 
in Usbekistan. Peter Heimline, VOA News, Moscow.
