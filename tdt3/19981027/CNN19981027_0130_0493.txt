With a look at your "Headline News weather," I'm Karen McGinnis. The 
weather headlines coming up for Tuesday will be hurricane Mitch, spinning 
around across the northwestern Caribbean. Otherwise, high pressure 
in control across the southeastern United States. That keeps temperatures 
rather mild and very dry weather conditions. However, a fairly powerful 
storm system is emerging from the southwestern United States. It looks 
like snow levels across the Rockies begin to lower. Temperature-wise, 
it's going to be a little bit cooler as well, across the Great Lakes 
and Hudson bay and into Idaho, the great basin and the four-corners 
region -- even into Tucson, Arizona. If you are traveling to Honolulu, 
look for 86 degrees, and 35 for anchorage, around 86 in San Juan. 
Our extended forecast is calling for rain and snow to continue across 
the rockies and gradually for Thursday moves across the high plains 
with scattered thunderstorms across Texas. And by Friday, a rain event 
for the midwest and showers for the pacific northwest. And chilly 
in the northern tier. For more weather information log onto CNN.com.
