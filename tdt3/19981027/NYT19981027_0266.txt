The writer Taslima Nasrin returned home to Bangladesh last month to 
be at the side of her dying mother. But while the older woman lies 
bedridden _ cancer amok in her liver and colon _ her daughter has 
been forced into hiding by religious firebrands who chant ``Death 
to the apostate!'' and have put a $5,000 price on her head. ``These 
are my mother's last days, and I cannot see her,'' Ms. Nasrin, 36, 
said Tuesday, talking angrily on a mobile phone from a hideaway in 
Dhaka. ``I cannot go anywhere or meet anyone. I love this country, 
but my life here is something no one would want.'' The onetime government 
doctor is a feminist and an atheist, a novelist and poet, a creator 
of erotic imagery and critic of organized religion. In heavily Islamic 
Bangladesh, her ideas are disquieting to many and blasphemous to others. 
The price for this outspokenness has been a lonely odyssey, of which 
her current hideout is but the latest stop. In 1994, Ms. Nasrin fled 
her homeland after some little-known Muslim clerics issued a fatwa, 
or death sentence, against her. She had also been arrested and charged 
by prosecutors with a seldom used section of the penal code that prohibits 
the insulting of religion. Many of Ms. Nasrin's writings and pronouncements 
could have set off such difficulties _ not the least her 1993 novel 
``Shame,'' a book that depicted a murderous rampage by Bangladeshi 
Muslims against the nation's Hindu minority. But anger turned to outrage 
only after Ms. Nasrin was quoted in a Calcutta newspaper as having 
commented that ``the Koran should be thoroughly revised.'' Later, 
she said she had been misquoted, though her clarifications then, like 
ones she offered Tuesday, were hardly mollification. ``Every religion 
oppresses women,'' she said in the phone conversation. ``I talk about 
the Koran because I know this book best. It allows for torture and 
other mistreatment, especially for women. And I despise the Sharia 
laws. They cannot be changed. They must be thrown out, abolished. 
We don't need them.'' Some of this fire, while hardly unusual for 
Ms. Nasrin, was stoked by unattributed reports on Tuesday's front 
pages that the writer was now repentant and wished to atone. ``Apologize 
for what?'' Ms. Nasrin said emphatically. ``I haven't done anything 
wrong. I've told the truth. Religious scriptures are out of time and 
out of place.'' After fleeing Bangladesh in 1994, she primarily lived 
in Europe, collecting some awards for artistic courage but little 
peace of mind. In August, her mother, Idul Wara, a devout Muslim, 
joined Ms. Nasrin in New York and received cancer treatments. With 
the diagnosis dire, she left for home Sept. 13. She was accompanied 
by her husband, himself a heart patient, and her daughter. Ms. Nasrin 
hoped to return unnoticed. Indeed, immigration and customs officials 
did not realize whom they had in their midst. Other air travelers, 
however, recognized her. Reporters were called. Flight records were 
checked. Articles were written. In short order, the fatwa and the 
arrest again hung over her head. The writer spent two days with her 
parents, who live in a comfortable three-bedroom apartment that Ms. 
Nasrin bought with earnings from her books. Then she again went into 
hiding. Many here presume that police know her whereabouts. For a 
while, protesters demanded her arrest. Thousands took to the streets. 
Rioters threw rocks. Seminarians in the northeastern city of Sylhet 
called a general strike. Everything there was shut down. Recently, 
the street fury has subsided, prompting many here to suggest that 
Ms. Nasrin no longer faces any danger. ``She should come out,'' said 
Syed Ali Ahsan, a noted writer and vice chancellor of Darul Ihsan 
University. ``She has the best lawyers in the country. Nothing will 
happen to her. She can lead a normal life.'' Such sentiments are not 
uncommon here. Many prominent Bangladeshis insist that the fatwas 
are empty threats by feckless fundamentalists. They remind people 
that Bangladesh is governed by secular laws and resent Westerners 
who have used the Nasrin case to stereotype their nation as another 
repressive Islamic backwater. ``To the West, Taslima is an even better 
victim than Salman Rushdie because she is a woman,'' said Mahfuz Anam, 
the liberal-minded editor of The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper 
in Dhaka. Rushdie was for years under a death sentence issued by Iran's 
Islamic regime. ``She has gotten global attention, but in Bangladesh 
she is not such a heroine. She has not inspired us. She is not a great 
writer. We have far more extraordinary women here who are working 
with the villages and protecting women's rights.'' Ms. Nasrin has 
her share of supporters, but she is surely no darling within most 
women's groups or literary circles. Her work is often derided. Indeed, 
many are perturbed that she is linked to a literary superstar like 
Rushdie by virtue of mutual circumstance. To many, Ms. Nasrin is an 
indiscreet, all-too-shrill voice. Freedom of speech is a wonderful 
thing, Ahsan said, but its use must be tempered in places where words 
too easily lead to bloodshed. ``Freedom does not give me the right 
to try and kill the beliefs of another person,'' he said. Among those 
pained by Ms. Nasrin's writing is someone who loves and respects her 
dearly, the terminally ill Idul Wara, 62. Near death, she finds it 
hard to talk, to eat, to sit up. Still, clutching to her faith, she 
tries to pray the required five times a day. ``My mother supports 
Taslima's feminist writings, but when she writes very directly against 
Islam, my mother cannot help but think this is wrong,'' said Faizul 
Kabir, the author's older brother. ``My mother wants to know why it 
is necessary to write against religion in order to be in favor of 
women. She does not see things the same way.'' Kabir had left his 
mother's bedside and agreed to take tea around the corner. He said 
his mother longed to see Taslima and was bereft at the separation. 
``My mother asks for forgiveness for her daughter,'' he said, drawing 
a careful distinction. ``She does not ask that Taslima ask. She asks 
as a mother asks. She asks for the sake of herself.''
