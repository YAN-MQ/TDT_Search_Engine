The Clinton administration is trying to rally Arab support for the 
israeli/Palestinian peace deal. State department spokesman James Rubin 
has asked Arab states to help palestinians whenever possible and to 
normalize relations with Israel. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
survived a no confidence vote Monday at the Israeli parliament. Hard-liners 
opposed to the land-for-peace deal launched the campaign to bring 
down his government. An effort is now under way to hold early elections 
in the spring. Disenchantment with Netanyahu spilled into the streets 
of Israel. Hundreds of protesters marched in front of his home calling 
for his resignation. Palestinians also protested the deal in the West 
Bank and Gaza city. They say the peace agreement doesn't satisfy their 
demands for the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the release of political 
prisoners.
