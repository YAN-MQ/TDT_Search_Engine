Quick, name the most often performed full-length American opera. It's 
not ``Porgy and Bess,'' which was banished from the opera house for 
decades and branded a highbrow musical. It's not ``West Side Story,'' 
which was intended for Broadway despite the fact that Bernstein, late 
in life, gave it some operatic trappings. And it's not ``Amahl and 
the Night Visitors,'' which, since it was commissioned by a television 
network, could not run longer than an hour. It's ``Susannah,'' with 
music and libretto by Carlisle Floyd, a native of South Carolina. 
The work received its premiere in 1955, when Floyd was 28, and immediately 
leapt to national renown. Regional companies and university opera 
studios have made it a repertory staple. It has had more than 230 
productions and 750 performances, and despite changing fashion, it 
has never disappeared from the American stage. There are, however, 
stages on which it never appeared in the first place. Although it 
was given its first professional production by the New York City Opera, 
``Susannah'' has been mysteriously absent from America's biggest houses. 
And although Floyd went on to compose eight more operas, his name 
is rarely mentioned by the major companies, except with condescension. 
So new productions in New York this season of not only ``Susannah'' 
but also ``Of Mice and Men,'' Floyd's 1969 adaptation of the Steinbeck 
novel, are major events. ``Of Mice and Men'' opens on Saturday evening 
at the City Opera, which has long championed Floyd's work. And next 
March, ``Susannah'' finally makes its debut at the Metropolitan Opera, 
44 years after its birth. Why should ``Susannah,'' so beloved by a 
large and diverse public, suffer such neglect from the major houses? 
And how did Floyd, now 71, get pushed to the margins, where he remains 
a shadowy presence? ``As a Southerner, he's never been part of the 
compositional circles, which are largely in the Northeast and the 
West,'' said the soprano Phyllis Curtin, who created the role of Susannah. 
``He was not going the 12-tone way, so he was not part of academic 
circles. He seemed out of the Romantic era, a bit passe and naive. 
``And in the Northeast there is still this idea that a Southern accent 
means someone is a little bit slow,'' added Ms. Curtin, herself from 
West Virginia. ``You know: `He's a Southern boy, so Susannah must 
be a one-shot thing, and probably he can only write little folk operas.' 
'' Julius Rudel, who directed the New York City Opera from 1957 to 
1979, revived ``Susannah'' three times and introduced two other operas 
by Floyd, although not ``Of Mice and Men.'' ``There was disdain not 
only for the musical style of `Susannah' but for the rural Southern 
setting,'' Rudel said. ``Who writes an opera about an itinerant preacher 
and a bunch of hillbillies?'' Floyd seems to have survived decades 
of neglect with relative equanimity. ``It's irksome not to be considered 
part of an intellectual elite simply because of the style of your 
work,'' he said recently from his home in Houston. ``It has to do 
with the Northeastern academic establishment's attitude toward the 
South. In New York, I'm simply outside the loop.'' At mention of the 
Met debut of ``Susannah,'' Floyd turned wistful. ``To be quite honest,'' 
he said, ``I never expected to see it in my lifetime.'' Yet he harbors 
no illusions as to why it is occurring. ``I would love to think that 
the Met is conferring repertory status on it,'' Floyd said. ``That 
would at least take it out of the novelty category. I hope it's an 
acknowledgment of the work's longevity and effectiveness as a piece 
of theater. But the big houses are performer-oriented, not work-oriented, 
and I'm sure the fact that Renee Fleming and Samuel Ramey and Jerry 
Hadley wanted to do it played a very large part in the decision.'' 
A statement from the Met's press office seems to confirm Floyd's suspicions: 
``We always talk to singers about repertory, and both Sam Ramey and 
Renee Fleming brought us the idea that we should do `Susannah,' and 
we agreed.'' In its subject and tone, ``Susannah'' deliberately broke 
new ground. Set in an isolated village in the hills of Tennessee, 
it offers an unflinching portrayal of a wandering preacher and the 
fanatical mob he incites. Although it takes place in the early 20th 
century, its harsh attack on fundamentalist hypocrisy seems surprisingly 
timely. Floyd's libretto, based on the Apocryphal tale of Susannah 
and the elders, strips it of all but the essentials. The townsfolk 
have always considered the beautiful young Susannah an outsider. When 
she is glimpsed bathing in a stream, her nakedness is taken as a sign 
of promiscuity. A visiting preacher, Olin Blitch, inflames the passions 
of the faithful. At a revival meeting, Susannah is publicly accused. 
But Blitch turns out to be the sinner, raping Susannah only to discover 
that she is still a virgin. As a mob descends on Susannah's farmhouse, 
her brother shoots Blitch. Susannah remains defiant to the end. Floyd, 
whose father was a minister, was born in Latta, S.C., in 1926, and 
grew up in a succession of South Carolina towns, where revival meetings 
were common. The experience of small-town bigotry seems to have shaped 
his life and art. ``The thing that horrified me already as a child 
about revival meetings was mass coercion, people being forced to conform 
to something against their will without even knowing what they were 
being asked to confess or receive,'' he said. It was especially important 
to him that Susannah end the opera in triumph, he added. ``Opera had 
for so long been about pathetic heroines, heroines as victims, that 
not everyone was quite ready for a woman this strong.'' Let alone 
a woman who, though still a virgin, is unashamed of her sexuality. 
`` `Susannah' has a central theme,'' said Ms. Curtin, ``and it's something 
that's right in front of us today, the fear and fascination and punishment 
of sex.'' Begun in 1953, Susannah was also a veiled commentary on 
the McCarthy era. ``The whole atmosphere of `Susannah,' '' Floyd said, 
``is not far from the idea of McCarthyism, that accusation is tantamount 
to guilt.'' Clearly, Floyd identifies with Susannah, just as he identifies 
with the protagonists of ``Of Mice and Men,'' the migrant farm workers 
George and Lenny. All are outsiders who have been ostracized by the 
mainstream. ``I always saw myself in that role in relation to the 
academic new-music world,'' Floyd said. ``I may not have been the 
outcast, but I certainly was the misfit. I wrote music that had strong 
emotional content and that said something to an audience. And I realized 
that what I did was going against the curve.'' If anything, Floyd 
understates the conflict. During the 1950s, Serialism was rising toward 
academic dominance, and Coplandesque Americana was falling into disgrace. 
Floyd had the temerity to write an opera that was unashamedly tonal, 
frank in its use of folk material, soaring in its lyricism and direct 
in its expression. Even Floyd's detractors acknowledge that he has 
an uncanny theatrical command. His skill as a dramatist was honed 
by years of attending plays and movies, not by listening to operas. 
``America is a country that's been born and bred on realism, in plays 
and films and on TV,'' Floyd said. ``That has been the hallmark of 
American theater from the beginning of the 20th century. In the opera 
world we assume the drama will be slow, arbitrary and artificial in 
its pacing. My heritage is in the theater, and I wanted to transfer 
the tradition of American realism to the opera house.'' So it wouldn't 
bother Floyd if, on first hearing, ``Of Mice and Men'' impressed more 
as drama than as music. ``If I can sit back and subtly evaluate the 
score of a new opera, then I didn't spend a very absorbing evening 
in the theater,'' he said. ``I'm not insulted if people who see `Of 
Mice and Men' get caught up in the drama. The music is still there, 
and it's working on you subliminally whether you're aware of it or 
not.'' ``Of Mice and Men,'' Steinbeck's gritty portrayal of migrant 
workers in the dust bowl of the 1930s, is so lean that it might already 
seem the ideal opera text. But this libretto, Floyd reports, turned 
out to be the most difficult project of his career. ``I made the fatal 
mistake of thinking that Steinbeck had done my work for me,'' he said. 
``So I never did the first and most important task, the basic compression. 
I had to start it all over and trim and trim, always asking myself, 
`What is this story really about?' '' ``Of Mice and Men'' was to have 
received its premiere at the City Opera in 1970. But Rudel canceled 
the performances after hearing a piano reduction of an early version. 
``I had planned to do it, and then we came to the conclusion that 
it wasn't going in quite the right direction.'' Rudel said. ``It was 
a disappointment for all of us.'' Floyd found the cancellation, coming 
from an ardent supporter, devastating. ``I felt like the opera was 
getting an advance black eye before it had even been heard,'' he said. 
Inherently a grim, brutal and pessimistic tale, ``Of Mice and Men'' 
will never hold the appeal of ``Susannah.'' Its score is more dissonant 
and less lyrical; its sonorities are strident, bathing the libretto 
in a harsh, cold light. There are times when the music seems to pale 
alongside the vivid narrative. But at its best, ``Of Mice and Men'' 
provides a riveting theatrical realism rarely encountered in the opera 
house. Some think that ``Of Mice and Men'' may be Floyd's greatest 
work, and he does not disagree. ``It's as perfectly wrought as I can 
make it,'' he said, ``and as fine an opera as I've written in terms 
of realizing both musical and dramatic goals.'' But others wonder 
whether Floyd's career started at a peak it has never regained. `` 
`Susannah' stands by itself,'' Rudel said. ``It's like a throw of 
genius, a young man's first explosion. I hate to make value judgments. 
Is `Rigoletto' better than `Traviata'? But in a sense, the large public 
has spoken in favor of `Susannah,' and the paying customer tells you 
what to play.'' In any case, Floyd's career could hardly be judged 
a failure, precisely because it begins with ``Susannah,'' perhaps 
the most dramatically viable opera ever written by an American. ``If 
you come up in a lifetime with just one `Susannah,' '' said Ms. Curtin, 
``that's already a pretty remarkable thing.''
