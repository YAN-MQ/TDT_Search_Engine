In the Japan baseball series, it was a story of going from sinking 
whales to shining stars. The Yokohama Baystars won the Japan baseball 
series by defeating the Sablieu Lions Monday 2-1, capturing the best 
of seven series four games to two. The Baystars have won the series 
only once before way back in 1960 when the team was known as the Tao 
Whales. After that, the team was so hapless for so long, that, even 
hometown fans, commonly called them, the Sinking Whales.
