Miss Israel should not expect open arms. Citing a state of war with 
Israel, Lebanon's new beauty queen declared Tuesday that she would 
not shake hands with her Israeli counterpart at the Miss World and 
Miss Universe contests. ``We all know that Lebanon is in conflict 
with Israel which is occupying an important region in our country. 
If I see her, I will not shake hands with her and will try to keep 
a distance from her so that I won't have to shake hands with her,'' 
said Clemence Ashkar. Ashkar, an 18-year-old sociology student, was 
chosen Friday as Miss Lebanon from 23 contestants during a four-hour 
ceremony. Lebanon, which is technically at war with Israel, forbids 
any dealing or contacts with the Jewish state. Since 1985, Israel 
has occupied a border enclave in southern Lebanon as a buffer against 
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
