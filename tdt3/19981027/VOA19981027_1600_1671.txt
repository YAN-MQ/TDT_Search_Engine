In a Vodan ritual in the West African nation of Bannin, a priestess 
offers her prayers and praise to one of the many deities who make 
up the Vodan spiritual universe. I am Jim Metznic, and this is the 
Pulse of the Planet presented by the American Museum of Natural History. 
Voodoo is a religion. It is a religion, which is, perhaps equally 
importantly, a philosophy. It is a philosophy about life. Suzanne 
Kerstin Blea is a professor of fine arts and Afro-American studies 
at Harvard University and a consultant for a new exhibit at the American 
Museum of Natural History, The Sacred Arts of Haitian Voodoo. It is 
about the way in which one perceives in the course of life. The term 
itself derives from the local language, which means, literally, rest 
to draw the water. Voo, meaning to rest quietly, and doo, meaning 
to fetch water, to bring water from the well. And in this sense, it 
is a philosophy about, no matter what is going on in life, no matter 
how difficult things are, that one has to move through it with a certain 
quietness ease. One should have faith ultimately, in the powers of 
the various gods, and in conjunction with that, perform whatever related 
ceremonies are asked of one. And things will turn out in a positive 
way. There are some ceremonial attributes that one might do every 
day. For example, first thing when one gets up in the morning, the 
children of the house will take small brooms and sweep the face of 
the earth. It is to clean the face of mother earth. These are a ritual 
action that is dedicated to the power of the earth. It is a small 
ceremony and a part of a larger tradition.
