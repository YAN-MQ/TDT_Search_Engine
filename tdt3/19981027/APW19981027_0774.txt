A Munich lawyer fighting to get payments for former Nazi slave laborers 
said Tuesday that he has offered to hold new talks with banks, industry 
leaders and Jewish groups to try to reach a deal acceptable to all. 
Attorney Michael Witti said he was willing to discuss a settlement 
that satisfies the demands of the victims as well as offers legal 
security for German firms. But he said he had yet to get a response 
to his offer. Witti, who works with New York-based lawyer Ed Fagan 
representing Holocaust victims, has been critical of German industry 
and bank plans thus far to repay slave laborers. They have filed a 
lawsuit in New York against Siemens, Volkswagen, Krupp, Daimler-Benz, 
Audi and BMW, seeking a portion of company profits for thousands of 
former slave laborers. ``A solution will and must be found that includes 
the pending court case,'' Witti said. A planned trip by Fagan to Germany 
this week has been canceled to prevent that endangering new talks. 
Ignatz Bubis, the chairman of Germany's Central Council of Jews, has 
accused Fagan of hindering talks toward a settlement by pursuing separate 
legal action. Germany's newly elected Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
last week invited German business leaders to private talks aimed at 
setting up a new foundation to resolve the slave labor claims and 
protect German firms against future lawsuits.
