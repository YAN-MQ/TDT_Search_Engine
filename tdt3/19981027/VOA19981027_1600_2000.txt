Israel's Prime Minister has postponed a cabinet meeting that was to 
ratify the peace deal he made with the Palestinians. A cabinet vote 
was scheduled for Thursday, but an Israeli spokesman says the cabinet 
session will be put off until the Palestinians submit their working 
plan for combating anti-Israeli violence.
