Our man in space. When we come back, one view of what happened here 
today from a man who has been there and has done that. I don't know, 
stu. What? First, the kids star in their own movie. Now they're doing 
commercials. I wouldn't worry, deed. But according to Dr. Lipschitz, 
if children experience fame too soon, it can go to their heads. Come 
on. What's the worst that could happen? Mr. DeVille, I'm ready for 
my close-up. New Mercury villager. Now more room and more power. Preferred 
by grown-UPS. And babies. How far will you go so that people can fly? 
How deep into darkness to bring a city to life? What depths will you 
dare to keep the world running smoothly? How far will the people of 
Texaco go orovide the energy the world N EDS? Going down. How deep 
is the ocean? Texaco.
