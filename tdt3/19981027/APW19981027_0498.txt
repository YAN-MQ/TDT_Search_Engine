British American Racing signed Brazil's Ricardo Zonta on Tuesday to 
drive for the new Formula One team next season, joining 1997 world 
champion Jacques Villeneuve. The 22-year-old Zonta won the FIA Formula 
3000 International series in 1997 and the 1998 FIA Grand Touring Car 
Championship. Craig Pollock, managing director of F-1's newest team, 
said Zonta ``has shown the talent and maturity of a driver of far 
more experience.'' Zonta, who is expected to join the team for December 
testing, has also been a test driver for McLaren Mercedes. ``I am 
thrilled to be driving alongside such a successful and experienced 
driver as Jacques Villeneuve, from whom I am certain I will learn 
a great deal,'' Zonta said. Villeneuve, the defending series champion, 
announced in July he was moving from Williams to British American 
Racing to team with old friend Pollock. BAR was set up last year as 
a joint venture of British American Tobacco, Reynard Racing Cars and 
Pollock, with 50 percent of the team owned by the tobacco giant. BAT 
is reported investing about 200 million pounds (dlrs 336 million) 
in the team. BAR also bought out Tyrrell Racing, which will run its 
final race Sunday in the Japanese Grand Prix. Tyrrell, used this season 
as BAR's laboratory, won 33 F-1 races and season drivers' championships 
in 1969, 1971 and 1973. It also won the constructors' title in 1971.
