Prime Minister Jean Chretien has canceled a planned trip to Russia 
in January because of economic troubles there, his office announced 
Tuesday. The trip already had been scaled back from a full-scale trade 
mission that would have included hundreds of Canadian executives. 
``In consultation with President (Boris) Yeltsin, I have decided to 
postpone my visit to Russia in light of the current economic situation,'' 
Chretien said in a release. He still plans to visit Poland and Ukraine 
in January, his office said.
