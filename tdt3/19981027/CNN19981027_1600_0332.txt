President Clinton has signed a Bill that would redirect federal funds 
for head start, a preschool program. It designates 60% of new funding 
for the program must be used to improve quality. Previously, 75% of 
new head start funding went to enrolling more children. The Bill also 
creates a test program to allow 50,000 low-income families to save 
money with a dollar-for-dollar government match. The savings could 
be used for a first home, business start-up, or college. Financial 
aid is an investment in our people that is repaid several times over 
through enhanced earning power and productivity, greater civic awareness 
and involvement, strengthening the intellectual well-being of our 
great democracy. And that's why the department of education is stepping 
up its efforts to make students and parents aware of these kinds of 
opportunity. The legislation also includes $2 billion for the low-income 
energy assistance program.
