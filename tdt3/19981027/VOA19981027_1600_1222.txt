In the Monday night National Football League game, it is featured 
a battle between two teams that had records of four wins and two losses. 
You could expect a close game and that is what exactly happened. Pittsburgh 
running back, Jerome Bettis, returned to the lineup and rushed for 
119 yards as the Pittsburgh Steelers broke the Kansas City Chiefs' 
11-game home winning streak, 20-13, to win that game. Cordell Stewart 
completed 11 of 22 passes for 82 yards, firing a go ahead five yard 
touchdown pass with 10 minutes to play as Pittsburgh notched its fifth 
win of the season. Bettis, who missed last week's game with an injured 
knee, carried 33 times to record his fourth consecutive 100-yard game 
against the Chiefs. And his sixth straight on Monday night television. 
We stuck with the running game and, you know, it, when you keep up 
defense on the field for a long period of time, it creates a tough 
situation for those guys because they get tired and like everybody 
else. Yes. That is right. And the Chiefs were penalized 10 times for 
71 yards. That did not help their cause. They dropped to four and 
three on the season.
