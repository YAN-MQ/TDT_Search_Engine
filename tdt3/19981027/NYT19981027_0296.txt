At 63, Sam Romero has never felt more wanted. Romero, the son of Mexican 
immigrants, is a retired cabinetmaker, a Reagan Democrat and a veteran. 
In other words, he is the kind of blue-collar voter that Rep. Loretta 
Sanchez and her Republican challenger, Robert Dornan, the former incumbent, 
are spending much of their time and money courting like lovesick teenagers. 
The calculus of politics is rapidly changing across California and 
that is easy to see in the 46th Congressional District, where old 
dogs are trying to learn new tricks to avoid being left behind. In 
the last days of the bitter and tightening rematch of their 1996 campaign, 
Ms. Sanchez and Dornan know they need as many Sam Romeros as they 
can get in this increasingly Hispanic and Asian district in the heart 
of Orange County, once a largely white, conservative bastion. ``Thirty 
years ago, it was white man's land,'' said Gary Jacobson, a professor 
of political science at the University of California, San Diego. ``That's 
certainly not true anymore.'' That was made clear two years ago when 
Ms. Sanchez narrowly upset Dornan, the nine-term incumbent, largely 
on the strength of the growing Hispanic vote. Dornan spent 14 months 
unsuccessfully challenging the results, saying that non-citizens had 
voted illegally. Dornan, 65, the fiery conservative nicknamed B-1 
Bob for his ardent support of the defense industry and his own rhetorical 
bomb-throwing, says he can capture the Hispanic vote this time. ``I 
want Latinos to vote for me and they will,'' Dornan said. ``I'm the 
guy with the work ethic.'' Ms. Sanchez, who has a much larger war 
chest, is favored to win, although her lead has slipped from 21 points 
in a Chapman University poll released last summer to 15 points in 
one the university released in early October, with 35 percent of the 
voters, most of them Republicans, still undecided. ``The actual election 
is going to be much closer than 15 points,'' said Mark Mattern, the 
political science professor who directed the polling. ``I'm guessing 
that Dornan will pick up more of the undecided vote.'' Dornan said 
his own polling shows him only 4 points behind. Lately, Dornan, a 
redhead of Irish descent, has been proclaiming that he is ``the only 
true Latino'' in the race because he opposes abortion. Ms. Sanchez, 
a fellow Catholic, supports abortion rights. Dornan is banking that 
opposition to abortion in the heavily Catholic Hispanic community 
will help him pull in votes. But the polling shows his abortion strategy 
doing him little good, Mattern said. Still, Dornan has pressed ahead. 
He included drawings of the Virgin of Guadelupe and pictures of aborted 
fetuses in a campaign flier, said Mark Petracca, chairman of the political 
science department at the University of California, Irvine. Ms. Sanchez, 
38, a moderate Republican turned moderate Democrat, picked up on the 
district's new math much quicker than Dornan. In 1994, Ms. Sanchez 
ran for the Anaheim City Council using her married named, Brixey. 
She came in eighth out of 16. Two years later, she dropped the name 
in her upset victory over Dornan. By then, the extent of change in 
Orange Country had become clear. Indeed, for decades, immigrants from 
Mexico, El Salvador and Vietnam had been moving into the county, fleeing 
war and want. Although the demographics continue to change, Ms. Sanchez 
said, ``the basic core values of hard work and the desire to give 
a better opportunity to your children, remain the same.'' Today, the 
district, the county's most diverse, is half Hispanic, primarily Mexican. 
Romero, a former U.S. Marine, operates St. Teresa's Catholic Gift 
Shop on Fourth Street here in memory of his late daughter, Lydia Romero-Cruz. 
Although he is a registered Democrat, like many Hispanic residents 
he knows, he has often voted for Republicans, including Dornan and 
President Ronald Reagan. ``He helped turn one of the worse slums in 
the county into a decent place to live,'' Romero said of Dornan's 
efforts to help revitalize a housing development. But on Nov. 3, Romero 
said he would vote for Ms. Sanchez, as he did two years ago. ``When 
she started to run, a lot of us said, `It's about time we had some 
Hispanics in office,''' Romero said. But ethnic pride was not the 
only reason. Romero said he was also motivated by hurt and anger at 
what he said were Republican-backed efforts to stifle Hispanic progress 
in California with ballot initiatives attacking immigrant rights, 
affirmative action and bilingual education. ``One day,'' he said ``the 
Republicans decided I wasn't American anymore, and they shoved me 
off the fence.'' Now, he calls the Republican Party, ``the Evil Empire'' 
and Dornan one of its loudest voices of intolerance. Indeed, because 
of the challenger's shoot-from-the-lip reputation, Republicans here 
and in Washington ``were lukewarm to another Dornan run,'' said Stuart 
Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report, an independent political 
newsletter in Washington. ``It could only activate Hispanic voters 
who weren't pleased about his lengthy challenge after he lost,'' Rothenberg 
said. ``Sanchez raised a million bucks because of Bob Dornan.'' When 
Dornan officially announced last February that he was running again, 
a group of Republican movers and shakers in Orange County came to 
see him, said Dornan's son and campaign manager, Mark. They told him 
that if he ran, they would spend money to defeat him, his son said. 
The group was concerned, said Fred Smoller, Chapman University political 
science professor, that Dornan's confrontational style and harsh words 
about gays and others he disagrees with would be bad for the party's 
reputation and the county's business climate. ``He had a pretty good 
record with constituency services,'' Smoller said. ``But for a lot 
of people he just represented rage.'' ``Neither party wants Bob Dornan 
around,'' his son said. ``He's their conscience. He makes them uncomfortable. 
He's a down-to-earth guy who has never played a round of golf in his 
life.'' But so far it does not sound good for the man some call `` 
Soundbite.'' ``I'm very Republican,'' said Calvin Quy Ngo, the property 
manager at the Mall of Fortune in nearby Westminster, where refugees 
from Vietnam have been settling since 1975. ``But Dornan, I don't 
know. His term before, I don't think he did much for the community.'' 
Dornan has been extremely popular in the Vietnamese community of Orange 
County because of his staunch anti-communism. But Ngo, who fought 
the communists in Vietnam, is not sure that will be enough. Ngo said 
he liked Ms. Sanchez, especially after she recently attended a local 
festival, where she rolled up her sleeves and helped wrapped gifts. 
``Her shadow is everywhere compared to Dornan,'' Ngo said. ``I used 
to support Dornan 100 percent. Now, I have to ask myself.''
