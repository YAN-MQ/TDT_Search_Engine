Americans are showing their concern over the global economic turmoil. 
This month, consumer confidence fell nine points to its lowest level 
in almost two years. This is the fourth consecutive drop. A drop indicates 
fewer people are likely to make a big purchase such as a Home or major 
appliance. It also means fewer people may plan a vacation and there's 
an expectation of fewer jobs and lower paychecks.
