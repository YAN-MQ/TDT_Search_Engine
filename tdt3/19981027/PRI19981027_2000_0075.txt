...night, airstrikes loomed. NATO Secretary General Javier Solano 
says a significant number of Serbian troops have been pulled out of 
Kosovo. I am pleased to report that over the past 24 hours, over 4,000 
members of the special police have been withdrawn from Kosovo. The 
recent military units that are normally based in Kosovo are now moving 
back in their barracks, together with their heavy weapons. Mr. Solono 
maintains NATO forces are still prepared to take action, if the situation 
changes. He said NATO will send a special team to protect international 
observers in Kosovo to insure compliance.
