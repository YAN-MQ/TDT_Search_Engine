The second biggest mutual fund group is playing the name game. Vanguard 
is changing the names of all but 7 of its 109 mutual funds to eliminate 
confusion to investors. After years of customer complaints, vanguard 
will shorten fund names, get rid of slashes and the word "portfolios." 
The changes take effect today, but will not affect fund numbers or 
ticker symbols.
