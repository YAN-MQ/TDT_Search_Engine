Earlier, Brekhardt Ray noted Brazil's economic woes. Well, Brazil's 
car and truck sales plunged in October with more declines expected 
amid high interest rates and rising unemployment. The Brazilian CarMakers 
Association said sales fell about 20 percent in the first 20 days 
of the month over the same period a month ago. The president of the 
association said October was a totally lost month for the auto industry. 
Brazil's auto industry has been hit by interest rates approaching 
as high as 50 percent, resulting in hundreds of thousands of unsold 
vehicles.
