While Tom Wolfe's first novel, ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' (1987), 
gave us a satiric portrait of New York in the giddy go-go years of 
the 1980s _ those heady years when bond salesmen could think of themselves 
as ``Masters of the Universe'' _ his sprawling new novel, ``A Man 
in Full,'' gives us an equally entertaining portrait of Atlanta in 
the 1990s, an era when greed has begun to give way to debt, capitalistic 
hubris to premillennial doubts. It's clear, almost from the start, 
that ``A Man in Full'' (which will be available in stores Nov. 9) 
is a big if qualified leap forward for Wolfe as a novelist. The cartoonish 
cast of ``Bonfire'' _ a collection of physical and sartorial tics 
animated by heaps of authorial malice _ has been replaced by characters 
who bear more of a resemblance to real, sympathetic human beings, 
and Wolfe's novelistic canvas has expanded persuasively to include 
not merely the powerful and rich but also the poor and middle-class. 
Unfortunately for the reader, Wolfe's nimble, often enthralling orchestration 
of several rollicking story lines _ cross-cut cinematically to build 
tension _ comes to a screeching halt in the last few chapters of this 
novel as the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, of all people, is introduced 
as a crude deus ex machina cum self-help guru to provide this thick, 
Dickensian novel with an abrupt, unsatisfying ending. As in Wolfe's 
last novel, an interracial incident that threatens to be as incendiary 
as the Rodney King trial or Tawana Brawley case holds center stage 
in this volume. In ``Bonfire,'' a white yuppie stood accused of injuring 
a young black man in a hit-and-run accident; in ``A Man in Full,'' 
a black football star named Fareek Fanon is suspected of raping the 
daughter of a wealthy white businessman. This incident not only provides 
Wolfe with ample opportunities to satirize racial politics in Atlanta 
(not to mention the politics of political correctness) but also gives 
him a convenient pivot around which he can put several plot lines 
into play. Chief among those plot lines is the story of a blustering 
real estate developer by the name of Charlie Croker, the so-called 
``King of the Crackers,'' who presides, like a foul-mouthed antebellum 
lord, over a 29,000-acre plantation and a vast conglomerate of enterprises, 
including Croker Global Foods. These days, however, Charlie has slipped 
into a late midlife crisis: at 60, he is suffering from a bad knee, 
doubts about his 28-year-old trophy wife and high anxiety over the 
half-billion dollars he owes his creditors. His money problems draw 
him willy-nilly into a political scheme cooked up by the mayor of 
Atlanta to promote his own re-election while defusing the explosive 
Fanon case. While Charlie is having trouble living on several million 
dollars a year (much the way Sherman McCoy, in ``Bonfire,'' had trouble 
living on $980,000 a year), Wolfe's other characters are having similar 
difficulties on their far more modest incomes. Raymond Peepgass, the 
mousy banker with Charlie's chief creditor, PlannersBanc, can't make 
ends meet on $130,000 a year: he's already maxed out 19 of his 22 
Visa cards and owes his lawyer thousands more for handling a paternity 
suit. As for Conrad Hensley, an earnest young man who works in a Croker 
warehouse and finds his life bizarrely colliding with his boss', he 
sees his dreams of buying a condo for his family rapidly slipping 
away on his $14-an-hour paycheck. Having spent the better part of 
his career as a reporter who ardently documented his subjects' lives 
with dozens of physical and sociological details, Wolfe tends to build 
up his characters from the outside in. The reverse of a Method actor, 
he's a craftsman who believes that people can be defined by externals 
like money and clothing, that their behavior is largely driven by 
social context and status (or lack of it). And so, Wolfe tells us 
what sort of cars his characters drive: ``a silver-gray four-door 
Lexus sedan,'' a ``rattling old Hyundai'' or a rented ``black Volvo 
960 with veal-beige leather seats.'' What sort of clothes they wear: 
``a new hard-finished worsted navy suit from Gus Carroll, a high-necked 
tab-collar shirt and a pale-blue crepe de chine necktie with aperfect 
dimple.'' And what their accents sound like: `` `Unnh-unnh-unn There's 
Fareek Fanon, the football star, ``225 pounds of attitude,'' wearing 
around his neck ``a gold chain so chunky you could have used it to 
pull an Isuzu pickup out of a red clay ditch.'' And there's Fanon's 
accuser, Inman Armholster, the sort of ornery ``fat white man who 
exists only in Georgia.'' But if these characters are thorough stereotypes, 
Wolfe's main men (Charlie Croker, Conrad Hensley and Raymond Peepgass) 
are more three-dimensional, more fully fashioned human beings. Writing 
from their point of view, Wolfe endows them with frustrations, fears 
and conflicts that turn them into recognizable individuals while at 
the same time using their picaresque adventures to try to create the 
sort of big work of social realism, based on research and reporting, 
that he has long advocated as a means (in his view, the means) of 
capturing the Zeitgeist of ``this wild, bizarre, unpredictable, Hog-stomping 
baroque country of ours'' as it slouches towards the millennium. Certainly 
``A Man in Full'' aspires to giving the reader an inside look at how 
deals are struck in big city politics, how real estate empires can 
be built on debt, how alpha males struggle to achieve dominance on 
the football field, in business and in high society. And Wolfe does 
give us some dazzling, funny, wrenching set pieces, all rendered in 
his exclamatory, adrenaline-laced prose, that take us from a plantation 
deep in the heart of Georgia to a prison in Alameda County in California, 
from a glittering art opening in Atlanta to a numbing night shift 
in a warehouse stocked with frozen food. In his controversial 1989 
Harper's manifesto for ``the new social novel,'' Wolfe dismissed the 
notion that American life was too ``chaotic, fragmented, random, discontinuous'' 
to be captured _ roped, tied down and branded _ by contemporary fiction 
writers, and the strongest sections of ``A Man in Full'' do in fact 
leave us with a sense of what it's like to live in the ``billion-footed'' 
world of today. The book's hokey, stage-managed ending, however, suggests 
that Wolfe sees the world as such an absurd place _ such a chaotic, 
fragmented, random, discontinuous place _ that he could cavalierly 
(or desperately) tack ona ending that has virtually nothing to do 
with what has gone before, a conclusion that subjects his characters 
to fates that seem preposterous even in the ``age of anomalies'' so 
energetically conjured up in this bold but flawed new novel. PUBLICATION
