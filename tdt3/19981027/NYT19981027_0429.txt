Speaking to what has been a rare sight in this year's political campaigns 
_ a large live audience _ Peter Vallone exhorted several hundred union 
members and low-income New Yorkers on Tuesday to go to the polls next 
week, telling them that Gov. George Pataki ``may have a lot of money, 
he may have a lot of power, but he doesn't have you, he doesn't have 
your votes.'' Vallone, the City Council speaker and Democratic candidate 
for governor, was addressing a rally at St. Vartan's Armenian Church 
in Manhattan organized by the Working Families Party, which was started 
this year by several labor unions and the Association of Community 
Organizations for Reform Now, an advocacy group with low-income members. 
Vallone is at the top of the new party's ticket, and its organizers 
are hoping to win 50,000 votes, which will insure the party a spot 
on the ballot in future elections. Vallone received a boisterous reception 
from a chanting crowd of about 450. The enthusiasm seemed to enliven 
Vallone, who is usually a rather subdued speaker. ``This is your election,'' 
he said. Then, building a crescendo that brought the audience to its 
feet, he thundered: ``I promise, I promise, I promise, I will do my 
job, I will vote for you. You vote for me and we together, together, 
together, will take this state back.'' Rep. Charles Schumer, the Democratic 
candidate for U.S. Senate, is also running on the Working Families 
Party line. He was also supposed to appear at the rally, but party 
organizers said he was running late. Earlier in the day, Vallone attacked 
Pataki for refusing to debate him. ``It's now 7 days, 11 hours, 44 
minutes and 36 seconds until polls open next Tuesday at 6 a.m.,'' 
Vallone said. ``My question for George Pataki is: Where are you and 
when do you expect to debate? This is no longer a game. This is an 
insult to all New Yorkers.'' He also assailed what he termed questionable 
fund-raising practices by the Pataki campaign. Tuesday, Pataki, who 
has said previously that campaign aides were working on arranging 
debates, said he was concerned that Vallone would use a debate for 
personal attacks. ``I want to make sure we discuss the issues,'' Pataki 
said. Tuesday night, the governor went to Astoria, Vallone's home 
base, to accept the endorsement of the Queens Aldos Independent Democratic 
Club. He was met by Vallone supporters dressed as ducks to draw attention 
to what the Vallone campaign describes as the incumbent's ducking 
of debates.
