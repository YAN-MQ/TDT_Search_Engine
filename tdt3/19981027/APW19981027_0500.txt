A man who held a 3-year-old boy at knife point for six hours in a 
Berlin train station was identified by police Tuesday as a 25-year-old 
Algerian who had applied for asylum in Germany. The hostage-taker, 
whose name was not released, was arrested Monday night after being 
overpowered by police. He was to be arraigned Tuesday. Police said 
he arrived in Germany on Sept. 9 and applied for asylum in eastern 
Brandenburg state on Sept. 15. The application was automatically denied 
after he failed to show up for a hearing. The man then disappeared 
from the refugee home in Senftenberg where he had been placed, showing 
up early this month in Berlin without a residency permit. Detective 
Hans-Ulrich Voss said the asylum rejection may have prompted the kidnapping. 
The traumatized boy remained under observation in a hospital Tuesday, 
although a cut lip was his only physical injury. He was snatched from 
his mother on Monday by the kidnapper, who threatened to slash the 
boy's throat. The kidnapper demanded a plane ticket, then money, which 
he threw away after it was given to him. At one point he also demanded 
an imprisoned member of the Algerian Islamic Salvation Front be freed 
in Algeria, police said.
