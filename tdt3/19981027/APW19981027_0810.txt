Serbian police arrested a man suspected of hijacking a car belonging 
to the wife of a U.S. diplomat in Belgrade, a police statement said 
Tuesday. On August 31, at a traffic light, a man had jumped into the 
car driven by Mrs Sharon Miles, wife of the U.S. charge d'affaires 
in Yugoslavia, pointed a gun at her head and hijacked the vehicle. 
Out of the city center, the assailant had ordered Mrs Miles to get 
out of the BMW which had diplomatic license plates and drove away. 
Two days later, police found the somewhat damaged BMW and returned 
it to the U.S. Embassy. They told reporters they had identified a 
suspect and were searching for him. On Tuesday, Serbian police said 
they arrested one Predrag Lejlic, 22, of Resnik, a Belgrade suburb, 
and charged him with robbery. The suspect, a former convict, had been 
released from prison in July, police said.
