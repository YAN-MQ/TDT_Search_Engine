Damage to homes can easily be seen after a hurricane blows through. 
But widespread damage to a coastline may be more difficult to gauge. 
Ann Kellan looks at how the experts do it in this edition of "tech 
trends." This hurricane season reinforces how blowing winds and driving 
rains wash valuable land to sea. See the road behind there is completely 
-- Oh, wow, it's nothing but sand. To assess a hurricane's impact, 
researchers survey changes on the ground, like this North Carolina 
beach where September's hurricane Bonnie blew sand inland onto the 
roads. And researchers take to the skies in a twin otter plane to 
get an exact measurement of how hurricanes like Bonnie, georges and 
Mitch change the profile of the coasts. We're looking to see where 
the sand went. Did hurricane Bonnie deposit sand on the beach or did 
it take sand away? So the laser system is right here. This machine 
bounces laser beams from the plane to the ground and back to precisely 
measure the nooks and crannies along the coast. From this data they 
will compile 3-D images, like these taken of the california coast 
after last winter's rains and floods from El Nino. So we have maps 
from before the hurricane passed through and we have maps from after. 
Comparing the before-and-after maps researchers can assess the damage 
and the changes. I see a lot of roofers. Yeah, a lot of roof damage. 
All this helps community planners decide where to build and places 
to avoid. How far back from an eroding shoreline you should be to 
optimize your chances for safety and rather than getting wiped out 
in a major event. While Bonnie had a minor impact on the North Carolina 
coast, researchers are mapping other shores to see whether storms 
like hurricane georges and Mitch are leaving a more lasting impression.
