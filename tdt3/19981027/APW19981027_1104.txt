BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO decided Tuesday to keep up the threat 
of air strikes against Serb forces for an unspecified period, despite 
recognizing a substantial withdrawal of troops and police from Kosovo. 
A meeting of ambassadors from the 16-allied nations agreed to indefinitely 
extend the ``activation order'' which is keeping over 400 allied warplanes 
on alert for possible raids against the Serbs. ``We have requested 
our military authorities to remain prepared to carry out these air 
operations ... and to maintain forces at appropriate readiness levels,'' 
said NATO Secretary General Javier Solana. But the alliance did not 
set a new deadline for the airstrikes, after the previous deadline 
of 1900 GMT expired. Solana said the decision would maintain pressure 
on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic at a time when his troops 
were moving to comply with the alliance's demand that reinforcements 
sent to Kosovo during the eight-month crisis be withdrawn. ``We know 
that President Milosevic only moves when he is presented with the 
credible threat of force,'' Solana told a news conference after the 
2 1/2 meeting. Solana told a news conference that reports from observers 
on the ground and reconnaissance flights by unarmed NATO planes showed 
most Yugoslav army and special police units had withdrawn from Kosovo 
or been returned to barracks. ``The security forces are returning 
to the level they were at before the present crisis began,'' he said. 
Solana said the NATO ambassadors would keep the situation under constant 
review. ``If we see evidence of substantial non compliance in the 
future ... we will be ready to use force,'' he said. Convoys of tanks 
and trucks carrying Yugoslav troops and police pulled out of several 
parts of Kosovo Tuesday, indicating Milosevic had ordered compliance 
with demands he reduce Serb forces in Kosovo to levels before the 
conflict with ethnic Albanian separatists flared February. Solana 
said 4,000 members of the special police had left Kosovo in the past 
24 hours. He said police and military units normally based in Kosovo 
were moving back to garrisons, check points have been dismantled. 
In Washington, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said Milosevic 
had withdrawn ``well over 90 percent of the security force reinforcements.'' 
``Thanks to NATO pressure and determination, very substantial steps 
have been taken toward compliance,'' Lockhard added.
