At the White House tomorrow, the government and I bixt M will announce 
the development of the world's fastest computer T certainly sounds 
lining an astonishing breakthrough. A computer capable of making nearly 
4 trillion calculations per second. ABC's Jack Smith reports tonight 
on what that will mean to all of us. Remember IBM's "deep blue," which, 
last year, became the first computer to beat a human being at chess? 
Well, the new supercomputer is 20 times faster -- the equivalent of 
15,000 desktop PCs. This is a new ball game. I mean, it will allow 
us to do computing, simulation experiments, the kind of physics we 
absolutely couldn't do before. Built by IBM for government nuclear 
labs, this machine means breakthroughs in -- nuclear weapons. For 
the first time, scientists can actually model a nuclear explosion, 
eliminating the need for controversial testing. Life-saving drugs 
-- with machines this powerful, drugs that take ten years to find 
with hit-or-miss lab work can be isolated in just a year and a Half. 
Climate -- so many probabilities can be assessed so fast, weather 
can be predicted with real accuracy. Oil exploration -- better computer 
simulation of where to drill means fewer dry holes, less damage to 
the environment. Think about it this way. Using a pocket calculator, 
it would take at least 63,000 years to do what this computer does 
in a second. Machines this fast will revolutionize science. Jack Smith, 
ABC News, Washington.
