Dwight Stones, the stylish high-jumper turned television commentator, 
has never been at a loss for words. Such was the case Monday when 
he became one of four athletes voted into the National Track and Field 
Hall of Fame. ``What's the limit on our acceptance speech?'' Stones 
asked Craig Masback, chief executive of USA Track and Field, during 
a telephone news conference to introduce the 1998 inductees. ``We're 
going to be treated to Dwight,'' said Francie Larrieu-Smith, who joined 
Stones, her fellow 1972 Olympian, in the Hall. She set 35 American 
records in distances from 1,000 meters to two miles. Also named were 
Jay Silvester, the first discus thrower to reach 220 and 230 feet, 
and Greg Foster, a hurdler who won the silver medal at the 1984 Olympics. 
The inductees will be honored during the 20th annual Hall of Fame 
ceremonies in Orlando, Fla., on Dec. 3, which coincides with USA Track 
and Field's annual meeting. The four will take their place alongside 
some 120 athletes currently enshrined in the Hall of Fame in Indianapolis. 
``When I started out, I just wanted to be the best athlete I could,'' 
said Larrieu-Smith, 45, who is currently studying for a master's degree 
in sports administration at the University of Texas in Austin. ``I'm 
thrilled to be recognized by athletes and coaches.'' Silvester, 61, 
who competed in four Olympics. winning a silver medal in 1972 and 
a bronze medal in 1976, described his induction as second only to 
winning an Olympic medal. ``When I broke my first world record, I 
didn't feel excitement but contentment and peace to get a monkey off 
my back,'' Silvester said. ``In some way, I feel the same with my 
induction into the hall.'' Foster, 40, a world-ranked high-hurdler 
for 15 of 16 years from 1977 to 1992, said he watched last year as 
his friend and fellow competitor Renaldo Nehemiah was named to the 
Hall. ``I was hoping I could do the same,'' Foster said. ``Now that 
it's come to pass, I'm excited.'' Stones, known affectionately among 
peers as ``the mouth'' and known by fans for his Mickey Mouse T-shirts 
and Fosbury flop style in the high jump, said track and field could 
use a few characters like him to help boost its image and fan appeal. 
``The sport can always use that _ a flashy athlete,'' the 44-year-old 
Stones said. ``People would show up just to boo me, but that was fine 
with me because we were getting the crowds.''
