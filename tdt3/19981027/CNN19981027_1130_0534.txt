In the antitrust trial against Microsoft, founder Bill Gates is expected 
to appear today on videotape. Government lawyers plan to play excerpts 
of his deposition in which they say he contradicts himself. Greg Lefevre 
looks at the man behind the billion dollar software empire. Who is 
Bill Gates? To some, a super geek, to others a new-age industrialist 
bent on dominating the new economy. Bill gets genuinely excited about 
the technology and the impact it can have on people's lives. Fans 
of Bill Gates say he gets it. Perhaps like no one else, he understands 
technology's practical uses. I think when he was a kid he spent a 
lot of time in those closets at school that held the one computer, 
feeding it punch cards. a smart kid who dropped out of Harvard, Gates 
thought computers were cool because they could actually do real things 
-- help people write, pay bills, play. Pure physical animation. This 
is a guy that can't control himself as far as the excitement around 
these technologies But get off the technical subject. I would call 
him a shy person in a social circumstance. Married in 1994 and now 
very much in the spotlight, Gates' public image is morphing from geek 
to polished casual. But no less driven, mostly by his passion for 
technology. And by the fear of irrelevance, of sudden unimportance. 
He faced that two years ago. The Internet explosion caught him by 
surprise. He's now redirected Microsoft into dozens of techno-niches, 
hoping none of them get by him. So I think he looks at business as 
really a gigantic chess game, and he's very, very competitive. Boyish 
enthusiasm is a good way to describe Bill Gates, and I hope it's a 
Good way to describe Microsoft. His critics say Gates wants the world's 
computers to run his way, the windows way, perhaps because it's better, 
perhaps because it's his. Greg Lefevre, CNN, San Francisco.
