A jury in Richmond, Virginia, has ordered an insurance company to 
pay $100 million to settle a discrimination suit. A fair housing group 
accused nationwide insurance of denying homeowners insurance to African 
Americans while approving policies for whites under similar circumstances. 
The plaintiffs also claimed nationwide's marketing efforts were targeted 
to zip-codes in predominantly white areas. Nationwide says it will 
appeal.
