President Clinton and vice President Gore held a roundtable discussion 
at the White House today on women and social security. It focused 
on how important social security benefits are for women retirees because 
they generally live longer than men and earn less. And they addressed 
the problems many women face supporting themselves in retirement. 
The conference is part of the administration's efforts to revamp social 
security.
