It's enough to make even the most jaded rush hour drivers gawk -- 
an airplane landing on the freeway. That's what happened yesterday 
in Los Angeles shortly before 5:00 P.M., backing up traffic for miles. 
A Cessna 152 ran out of fuel and had to make an emergency landing. 
It was the first solo flight for the pilot. He says the feat is nothing 
to be proud of, but he's glad he landed safely.
