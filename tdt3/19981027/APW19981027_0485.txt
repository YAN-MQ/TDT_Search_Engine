No sooner did Israeli and Palestinian negotiators return home than 
a new wrangle developed over the PLO covenant, a 30-year-old document 
that calls for armed struggle to destroy the Zionist state. It could 
be a show stopper, too. So far, the two sides cannot agree on whether 
U.S. President Bill Clinton will host a peace ``festival'' in mid-December 
as Palestinians envision or oversee a somber parliament session to 
renounce the PLO's violent past, as Israel wants. Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu promised his right-wing constituents that he would get the 
Palestinians' highest body to repeal the PLO's founding charter before 
handing over any land. He contends that the 600-member Palestine National 
Council will convene and, for all the world to see, officially cancel 
the charter by the legally mandated two-thirds margin. ``Not so,'' 
say Palestinian officials. Despite Netanyahu's contention that the 
job was left undone, they maintain that the parliament-in-exile already 
amended the charter by a vote of 504-54 at a meeting in Gaza City 
on April 24, 1996. What will be held this time is a ``festival,'' 
said Nabil Shaath, a member of Arafat's Cabinet and a senior negotiator. 
``It will be a popular demonstration to show support for the peace 
process,'' Shaath told reporters in Gaza after returning home. Dignitaries 
from all governing bodies, including the PNC, will attend the ceremony 
at which Clinton and Arafat will speak. Shaath said the gathered officials 
will approve a letter from Arafat to Clinton affirming that the Palestinians 
no longer advocate revolutionary violence to take back land that is 
now part of Israel. At the heart of the debate is an argument over 
translation of a single word. The English text says that Arafat and 
the parliament speaker will ``invite'' members of the PNC. The Hebrew 
version, however, says to ``convene'' a meeting. U.S. Embassy spokesman 
Larry Schwartz said the English version of the text was the ``authoritative'' 
one and that there were no other official versions. Right-wing opponents 
of the Wye Summit accord see the murkiness of the wording as an attempt 
to beguile. Michael Kleiner, a right-wing member of parliament, said 
Netanyahu's claim that the PNC would meet was ``a bluff, a lie, and 
sand in the eyes.'' He said the convening of various Palestinian groups 
would have no legal standing. Returning from the summit, Netanyahu 
told a news conference that there was ``no clouding'' of the issue, 
adding that ``all of the PNC will be present or at least invited.'' 
David Bar-Illan, a top Netanyahu aide, said Israel would ``draw conclusions'' 
from the way the Palestinians treat the issue and said a serious declaration 
in Arabic would have an important educational and psychological impact. 
``We can't allow it to become a farce or a denial of a clear commitment 
to reject the covenant in no uncertain terms,'' he told The Associated 
Press.
