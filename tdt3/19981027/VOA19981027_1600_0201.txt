Iran says it will hold nationwide municipal elections on February 
26, the first since the 1979 revolution. Iran's interior minister 
says 200,000 people will be elected to city, town, and village councils. 
The move follows President Muhammad Cattami's pledge to decentralize 
the government and increase public participation within Iran's 20 
year-old Islamic system.
