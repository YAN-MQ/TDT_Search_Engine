When a love affair goes sour, some destroy the evidence. Others save 
everything: goofy postcards, tiny drawings on matchbooks, a doodle 
on a restaurant menu. Luckily, Dora Maar, muse to Pablo Picasso for 
eight stormy years, kept all those things and more _ from grand oil 
paintings to a paper scrap with her lover's bloodstain. On Tuesday, 
15 months after Maar's lonely death, art-lovers got a chance to buy 
a piece of that passionate treasure trove. The three-day auction _ 
said to be the largest group of Picasso works to go on the block _ 
is conservatively estimated to bring in dlrs 30 million, and likely 
much more. But it is the deeply personal, slice-of-life nature of 
the collection that has had Parisians standing in the rain to get 
a pre-auction glimpse at the Maison de la Chimie near the Eiffel Tower. 
Dora Maar was 29, the dark-haired daughter of a Yugoslav architect 
and a French mother, when she met Picasso in 1936. She quickly became 
his lover and also a model, particularly for ``Guernica.'' But in 
the 1940s, Picasso moved on to the younger Francoise Gilot, and Maar 
went into a tailspin, living a hermetic existence in her apartment 
on the Rue de Savoie, never even seeing her close friends. She died 
in solitude in July 1997 at age 89. She had never married, had no 
heirs, apparently left no will. But genealogists tracked down two 
distant relatives, both of whom had never even heard of Maar. Now, 
after 60 percent of the proceeds go to the government for taxes, they'll 
get much of the remaining 40 percent. Some of Maar's friends aren't 
happy. ``Dora would be just horrified at all this,'' said James Lord, 
one of her close friends in Paris, though in the last few years they 
only exchanged letters. ``All this stuff was so personal to her,'' 
he said in a telephone interview. ``It's rather morbid to have it 
up for sale.'' The French government has deemed some of the works 
_ like a set of whimsical paper cut-outs made for his daughter, Maya, 
including animal heads with cigarette holes for eyes _ a ``collection,'' 
meaning they can't be taken from France. That may hold some prices 
down. It also has reached a deal with the heirs under which some of 
the inheritance taxes will be paid with artworks _ such as a 1915 
pencil drawing of Max Jacob, Picasso's first friend in Paris. The 
big ticket-items are the 10 oil paintings, including seven of Dora 
herself. There is the 1936 ``Dora Maar on the Beach,'' with Dora in 
red lipstick and nails, hair blowing in the wind. There is the 1937 
``The Crying Woman (Study for Guernica)'' _ in which her eyes are 
turned into tears pierced with long pins. And then there is the stunning 
``Dora Maar with Green Nails,'' also from 1936, where the muse is 
at the height of her style, her chin resting on green nails, hair 
braided on top of her head. But the most fascinating objects are the 
smallest: little portraits of Dora made into jewelry; little instruments 
made from the silver wrapping around a wine cork; dozens of sketches 
on tiny matchbook covers; photographs of the dashing Picasso at all 
ages; original books, notes, postcards, and letters. Nothing, it seems, 
was too small or insignificant for Picasso to scrawl on. One matchbook 
says: ``It was so dark at noon that the stars could be seen.'' A restaurant 
menu is adorned with a whimsical self-portrait of the artist. And 
perhaps the oddest but most poignant item from this lover's cache: 
a scrap of paper with a brownish stain, and the scrawled words, ``Blood 
of Picasso.''
