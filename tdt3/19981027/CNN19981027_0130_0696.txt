Michael costanza says he was the model for George costanza in the 
Seinfeld tV series and he's not happy about it. Costanza is suing 
the show's creator, Jerry Seinfeld and the show's producers for $100 
million. His lawyer says his client has known Seinfeld since they 
were at Queens college together. He says in some ways Michael is a 
lot like George, but the obnoxious and sarcastic TV character reflects 
negatively on him. A Seinfeld publicist says the character is based 
on one of the show's creators.
