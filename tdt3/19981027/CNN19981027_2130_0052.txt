The eye of hurricane Mitch is bringing fierce winds and driving rain. 
The storm is about 5 miles from Honduras with top winds of 150 miles 
an hour. It's moving west/southwest at 6 miles an hour. At least 11 
deaths in Honduras are being blamed on the storm. Thousands of people 
are evacuating. Rainfall totals could reach 20 inches in some areas. 
Further north in Mexico, the storm is expected to hit cancun and cozumel 
by the end of the week. The resort cities host tens of thousands of 
tourists. The hotels, they're being low key with the warnings to guests, 
saying they don't expect it to be that bad, but just in case they're 
wrong, plans are being made to evacuate guests to hotels on the mainland. 
The more luxuryous hotels are located on the peninsula here. Scientists 
use a variety of high-tech tools to survey hurricanes and their damage. 
We'll have more on that in our "tech-trends" report in a few minutes.
