Tomorrow night, we'll take a look at a group of people who have some 
reason to be not quite so happy that John Glenn is going into space 
for a second time. They are the women of "Mercury 13." They never 
got a chance to go once. that is our report on "World News Tonight." 
later on "Nightline," two senators running for their political lives.
