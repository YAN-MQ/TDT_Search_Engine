After yearlong talks and arguments, the leaders of Croatia and the 
Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation initialed an agreement Tuesday, defining 
bilateral relations. The agreement is to be made public on Wednesday 
and officials refused to reveal its contents. Richard Sklar, U.S. 
special envoy for Bosnian-Croatian relations, mediated the negotiations. 
He said was ``happy to see that parties have come together to a constructive 
agreement.'' ``The security, the political stability and the economics 
of the region are linked and when the leadership of the countries 
of the region ... find ways to work together, the people are the winners'' 
Sklar told reporters. It was not clear, however, whether the agreement 
achieved anything significant apart from bringing together the two 
sides that have been mostly at odds since the Bosnian war ended in 
1995. Jacques Klein, a top international official in Bosnia welcomed 
the agreement and said talks on annexes, to specify ways of military 
cooperation, economics and trade, should start immediately afterwards. 
These issues are reportedly source of continued disputes. The agreement 
should regulate relations between Croatia and the Bosnia's Muslim-Croat 
federation that makes up 51 percent of the country. The other half 
is controlled by Bosnian Serbs. Relations between the Bosnia's Muslims 
and Croats have been uneasy since they fought each other in 1993-94. 
Croatia aided the Bosnian Croats throughout the Bosnian war and international 
observers blame Zagreb for continued control over the Bosnian Croat-held 
regions. Zagreb is still largely financing Bosnian Croats and President 
Franjo Tudjman is considered their chief decision-maker. Tudjman argues 
that Croatia should take care of its compatriots in Bosnia, but international 
officials accuse him of harboring dreams to annex a part of Bosnia 
to Croatia proper. The ``special relationship'' agreement should end 
such an uncontrolled aid, and define forms in which Croatia can help 
its proxies, while not violating the integrity of Bosnian state. Ivic 
Pasalic, a close aide to Tudjman, said the agreement paves the way 
for Croatia ``to provide more help to Bosnian Croats, but also to 
other citizens of the Bosnian federation.'' Another agreement, on 
Bosnia's use of Croatian port of Ploce, has also been under negotiations 
for years. The two agreements are to be signed in early December.
