The new German Chancellor, Gerhardt Shroeder has been sworn into office 
in Bonn. Mr. Shroeder leads the first center-left government in Germany 
for 16 years. And for the first time, the cabinet includes members 
of the environmentalist green party. Caroline Wyatt was at the ceremony. 
There was a loud cheer from the Greens and Social Democrats as the 
54 year old Gerhardt Shroeder gained the necessary majority in Parliament 
to be sworn in as Chancellor. But the task facing this center-left 
government is a daunting one. Together with the environmentalist Greens, 
Mr. Shroeder knows the people of Germany will judge him on his ability 
to tackle record unemployment, a problem that defeated Mr. Kohl. Thanks 
to the Greens, it will also put an end to nuclear power and make it 
possible for foreigners living in Germany to gain duel citizenship. 
The main question here, though, is whether Mr. Shroeder can push through 
his politics of the new center ground. Carolyn Wyatt, BBC News, Bonn. 
Business leaders have criticized the incoming government because of 
its plans to start introducing an ecological tax, and to start phasing 
out nuclear power.
