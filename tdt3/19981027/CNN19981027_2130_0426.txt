Cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli security forces may be 
back on track. Palestinian agents arrested two Palestinian men today 
after they reportedly confessed to killing an Israeli in the West 
Bank yesterday. Israeli troops imposed a curfew on downtown hebron 
after the killing. They also banned Israelis from entering areas of 
the West Bank under palestinian authority. On the political front, 
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to delay submitting 
the peace deal to his cabinet for ratification. He insists the Palestinians 
first present the United States with a plan to fight anti-Israel militants.
