The nation's largest gay and lesbian church filed suit Tuesday against 
a Chicago television station, accusing the station of breaking its 
agreement to broadcast an infomercial produced by the church because 
the station considered the advertisement too controversial. Leaders 
of the church, the Cathedral of Hope in Dallas, believe the station, 
WGN-TV, which is seen nationally when it is fed by satellite to cable 
systems around the country, rejected the infomercial ``based on their 
views that this is not appropriate content for those stations,'' said 
a lawyer for the church, Christopher Wolf. ``I think those are code 
words for homophobia and for anti-gay discrimination.'' The church 
spent two years producing the infomercial and tried to market it to 
national cable stations over the summer. Church officials saw it in 
part as a counterweight to advertising by conservative Christian groups, 
including recent full-page newspaper advertisements with people who 
say they are former homosexuals who ``overcame'' their sexual orientation. 
``We just wanted to make our voice heard against the overwhelming 
onslaught of people using the media to say how bad gay people are,'' 
said the pastor, the Rev. Michael Piazza. ``We wanted mostly to reach 
out to lesbian and gay teen-agers but also people living in rural 
areas, to tell them there is this possibility that you can be gay 
and Christian, there is this possibility that you are a child of God.'' 
Most of the cable companies the church contacted said no. WGN-TV agreed 
to broadcast the advertisement, scheduled five showings and accepted 
a check for the first payment in July, church officials say. Then, 
church officials said, a week later, WGN canceled the agreement and 
returned the check. Charles J. Sennet, senior counsel for the Tribune 
Company, which owns WGN-TV, declined to comment on the lawsuit or 
to explain the network's version of events, saying the company would 
respond in court. Sennet suggested the church might not know exactly 
what happened because church officials did not communicate directly 
with the station, but used a media buyer, Phil Rozansky, president 
of Tower Media Advertising, in Chicago. Rozansky's version of events 
differs markedly from the church's. ``I think what they're trying 
to do is make this a political issue and a slam against gay rights,'' 
Rozansky said. ``They are jumping to conclusions and making accusations 
that are not appropriate and do not logically follow the facts.'' 
The 30-minute infomercial begins with a montage of anti-gay demonstrators 
and speeches by televangelists. The bulk of the advertisement is devoted 
to happy church members, both gay and straight, children playing and 
the church's inclusive philosophy. At the end, Piazza talks about 
a gay minister who was so distraught he committed suicide. Wolf, who 
considers the WGN agreement binding, said that at WGN's suggestion, 
the church agreed to change the title of the infomercial from ``Holy 
Homosexuals'' to ``A Cathedral of Hope'' and agreed to blur the image 
of Pat Robertson, the evangelist, to make his face unrecognizable. 
Rozansky, who said he had mistakenly believed top executives at WGN 
had signed off on the deal, said there were other ``specific issues 
within the show that make it inappropriate for airing.'' ``I was working 
with the ministry to make those adjustments and they told me they 
were willing to make some of those changes,'' Rozansky said, ``but 
then they brought in the lawyers.'' Rozansky said that infomercials 
that touch on sensitive subjects are routinely turned down by television 
stations. He said WGN had turned down paid programming that had ``gay-bashing'' 
themes. He said the other stations, including the Discovery Channel, 
Black Entertainment Television and Odyssey, had turned the commercial 
down for varying reasons, including length, religious content and 
controversial subject matter.
