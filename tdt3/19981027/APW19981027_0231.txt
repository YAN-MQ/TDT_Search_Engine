President Slobodan Milosevic, facing a NATO deadline Tuesday, has 
made a significant last-minute pullback of his military and police 
forces in Kosovo in order to avert NATO airstrikes. The private radio 
station B-92 quoted Serb sources as saying Tuesday the withdrawal 
was complete and that government forces in Kosovo were back to the 
level before Milosevic launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian 
militants Feb. 28. International observers were out in force Tuesday 
in the majority Albanian province to verify those claims. U.S. officials 
in Washington say the U.S. government wants verification before declaring 
that Milosevic had satisfied the terms of the deal he accepted to 
end the crisis. ``We want to make sure the movements are a real withdrawal 
and not a reconfiguration (of forces),'' said White House spokesman 
Joe Lockhart. The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch 
airstrikes unless Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces 
to levels in place before the conflict began. ``They're going down 
to the wire,'' said Shaun Byrnes, head of the American section of 
the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, which has been monitoring 
the situation since July. ``It's been the pattern.'' Hundreds of people 
died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from their homes in seven 
months of fighting since Milosevic launched the crackdown. Ethnic 
Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and most want 
independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic in 
Yugoslavia. Convoys of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks 
carrying Yugoslav troops and police departed several areas ahead of 
the 1900 gmt deadline for compliance in this southern province. According 
to observers, the forces were headed to their barracks or back to 
Serbia. ``They need to pull more people out of Kosovo to satisfy the 
agreement,'' Byrnes said at the end of a strenuous day of patrolling 
and observing Monday. He said observers will be out in force Tuesday 
to see whether Milosevic is complying. The observer mission is the 
spearhead of what will become up to 2,000 ``ground verifiers'' under 
the command of the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe. Kosovo's Serb governor, Veljko Odalovic, thanked the police 
for ``bringing peace to Kosovo'' and pledged the province will be 
defended from ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' with or without the police. 
In Kosovo's central Drenica region on Monday, tanks withdrew from 
roadside positions where they had dug in since Oct. 18. Several police 
checkpoints were vacant, including one in Malisevo _ scene of the 
latest fighting. All that remained was a tattered Serbian flag hung 
over a pile of bricks. At another checkpoint, in Dragobilje, which 
was occupied by heavily armed Serb police a few days earlier, a uniformed 
ethnic Albanian guerrilla stood holding an automatic rifle. The real 
test of the pullback will be if refugees begin returning to their 
homes. Most say they won't go home until Serb police leave their villages. 
So far, returns have been a trickle. A NATO source in Brussels, Belgium, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the alliance's ambassadors 
probably would wait until shortly before the deadline to declare whether 
Milosevic met the conditions. He said NATO was still prepared to use 
military force if necessary. The deadline has already been extended 
once since Milosevic agreed to the peace plan. NATO and the U.N. Security 
Council have also demanded that Milosevic allows international organizations 
to deliver humanitarian aid to the Kosovo refugees without interference.
