Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, has canceled his already shortened 
visit to the Vienna because his doctors say he is not fit to travel. 
Peter Heimline updates us on Mr. Yeltsin's condition. President Yeltsin 
was moved from his country residence outside the city to the nearby 
Barvica Sanatorium Tuesday morning. The sanitarium is a well-equipped 
medical facility where the 67 year-old Russian leader recovered from 
heart bypass surgery two years ago. A spokesman says the length of 
Mr. Yeltsin's stay will depend on how quickly he recovers from what 
doctors are calling extreme fatigue and erratic blood pressure. The 
condition forced cancellation of a one-day trip to Vienna that had 
been scheduled for today. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is attending 
the Vienna meetings instead. Mr. Yeltsin's recurring health problems 
have cast fresh doubt on his ability to remain in office. He was forced 
to cut short a visit to central Asia last week because of what was 
described as bronchitis. During the trip, he stumbled during a welcoming 
ceremony in Usbekistan. Peter Heimline, VOA News, Moscow.
