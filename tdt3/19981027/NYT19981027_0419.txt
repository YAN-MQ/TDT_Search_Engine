Citibank, one of the United States' largest issuers of credit cards, 
has teamed up with Sony, the giant electronics and entertainment company, 
to introduce a co-branded card they are promoting with an extensive 
national multimedia campaign. The card, which the companies call the 
``official currency of playtime,'' allows holders to earn one ``Sony 
point'' for each dollar charged, and additional points for purchases 
of Sony products or for purchases at retailers that participate in 
the program. Points can be redeemed for credit toward the purchase 
of Sony merchandise, which includes electronics and music products 
as well as movie tickets at Sony, Loews and Cineplex Odeon theaters. 
According to Jeffrey Dorn, senior vice president of Sony's card-business 
division, the company chose to enter the highly competitive credit-card 
industry because it enables Sony to pursue ``relationship marketing, 
to reward and thank our loyal customers.'' ``It's also a wonderful 
way to communicate with them,'' he added. Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, 
will use the Sony card to bolster its credit-card business, which 
received a setback last year when Ford Motor Co. discontinued its 
co-branded card program. Industry analysts said that the program, 
which gave card holders a 5 percent rebate on every purchase _ payable 
toward a new Ford vehicle _ was poorly promoted and too costly for 
Ford. Before Citicorp merged with Travelers Group this year to become 
Citigroup, it bought AT&AMP;T's Universal card business. It also issues 
the co-branded Advantage credit card with American Airlines. Joan 
Bonnette, marketing director for Citicorp Credit Services, a Citibank 
subsidiary, said the intended market for the new Sony card was adults 
25 to 49 years old who are ``interested in electronics and entertainment'' 
and who would find the card's reward structure, ``with its notion 
of free time and playtime,'' appealing. To reach those prospective 
customers, the companies are running a broad campaign created by Wunderman 
Cato Johnson, a unit of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York. Citibank's 
ad agency, Y&AMP;R Advertising, was also chosen by Sony this month 
to handle advertising for its U.S. consumer electronics business. 
Consumer electronics, computers and telecommunications products generated 
U.S. sales of $10.5 billion for Sony in its most recent fiscal year, 
which ended in March. Included in the campaign are one-page print 
ads that show people engaged in playful activities; one depicts a 
briefcase-wielding man playing hopscotch on a city street, with text 
attributing the platitude that ``hard work never killed anybody'' 
to ``some dead guy.'' The ads urge readers to ``use the new Sony card 
and turn the things you buy into everything Sony'' and reminds them 
that they can use the card to buy movie tickets, music, electronics 
and games. These ads will run through early next year in magazines 
like People, Premiere, Entertainment Weekly, GQ, Rolling Stone and 
Sports Illustrated. The campaign also features an eight-page insert 
that will run in the December issues of all magazines published by 
the Hachette Filipacchi unit of the Lagardere Group and select Time 
Warner magazines. The insert, which declares ``Sony and Citibank invite 
you to come out and play,'' depicts consumers involved with different 
Sony products, such as a couple entering a Loews movie theater and 
a family watching a Columbia Tristar home video. In addition to the 
print advertising, the campaign includes outdoor advertising in eight 
cities; direct mail that is being sent to purchasers of Sony products 
and individuals selected by Citibank; 60-second direct-response cable 
TV commercials asking viewers to call in and sign up for the card, 
and material to be distributed by Sony dealers and with Sony products. 
The credit card will also be promoted in a sweepstakes that starts 
later this month at Loews and Cineplex Odeon movie theaters and on 
the sony.com World Wide Web site. Ms. Bonnette said the budget for 
the campaign was comparable to money spent to advertise the credit 
card co-branded with American Airlines, which is owned by AMR Corp.; 
according to Competitive Media Reporting, the budget for the airline 
card was close to $12 million last year. Robert McKinley, president 
of Cardweb Inc. in Gettysburg, Pa., which tracks the credit-card industry, 
questioned the size of the Sony card budget and predicted Citibank 
and Sony would ``probably have to put quite a bit more behind it.'' 
But the companies' cooperative efforts won praise from William Keenan, 
the president of Creative Solutions in Hockessin, Del., a direct-response 
advertising agency that specializes in financial services. Sony, which 
Keenan said was not usually in ``control of its relationship with 
consumers,'' would be able to use the card to ``develop a captive 
database of known Sony buyers.'' ``It's an excellent loyalty and bonding 
strategy.'' he added. And Jennifer Scutti, who follows the credit-card 
industry for Prudential Securities, suggested that Citibank had adopted 
a ``very good strategy by targeting Sony, because people will identify 
quickly and easily with Sony's products, especially the younger generation 
of card holders.''
