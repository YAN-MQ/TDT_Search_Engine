The price tag, one of the reasons NASA is so focused on public relations 
this week is plain and simple money. There just isn't enough money, 
government money, to do everything the space agency would like. So 
is it possible that the answer may be less government and more private 
enterprise? Here's ABC's Jane Clayson. Main engine start and liftoff. 
Space travel is expensive. Every rocket is a one-shot launch. Both 
sets are gone. Right now, th launches, you throw away the equivalent 
of a jetliner every time you fly. So, private companies are racing 
to design reusable Rockets. Looking good, Pete. Pete Conrad commanded 
the "Apollo 12" mission to the Moon. He says the private sector can 
do it much cheaper than the government. The primary objective with 
what we're trying to do is cut the cost per pound to orbit by about 
70%. And these may be the answer -- reusable Rockets, with air bags. 
And parachutes. Here's a prototype that takes off like a rocket and 
lands like a Helicopter. This technology being tested on old fighter 
jets, would actually tow a Spacecraft into Once released, ro its payload 
and lands like an airplane 30 minutes later, ban with innovations 
like these, supersonic deliveries are not far off. Send a package 
from New York -- expect it in Tokyo 45 minutes later. And if freight 
can soar through suborbit, why can't humans? One company has signed 
up 60 people for a $98,000 a seat space ride. Another advertises an 
cable. You can do it, too, ride a rocket into space. Burt Rutan has 
spent $7 million developing the proteus rocket. He says, soon anyone 
can go to space. The reason it hasn't happened no one has had a sense 
that can you profit from it. No one has a sense that you can even 
technically do it. So, don't be surprised, the entrepreneurs say, 
in 20 years, to see space cruise ships, space hotels, fueling stations, 
even asteroid mining in space. All of it, private enterprise. 20 years 
from now, government spending in space will probably be 5% or less 
and 95% of it is going to be in the commercial world. As space becomes 
the final "money making" frontier. Jane Clayson, ABC News, Los Angeles.
