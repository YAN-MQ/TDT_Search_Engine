John Glenn, flying for the second time in space today. He circumstanceled 
the earth three times in 1962, and the first American orbital mission. 
The flight crew is expected to arrive at launch pad 39-B at about 
11:15 this morning, another hour and 15 minutes. Com check, over. 
You're clear. Welcome aboard, John Glenn. All systems are go aboard 
discovery. Weather continuing to look very good. It seems it appropriate 
to say to E shuttle discovery crew, good luck, have a safe flight, 
and to say once again, "godspeed, John Glenn." T minus 10, nine, eight. 
We have a go. Five, four, three, two, one. Booster ignition and liftoff 
of the discovery with a crew of six astronaut heroes, one American 
legend.
