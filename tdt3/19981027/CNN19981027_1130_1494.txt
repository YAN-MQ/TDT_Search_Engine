John Glenn's upcoming shuttle flight is prompting many people to look 
back to the program that first put Americans in space. John Zarrella 
reports on the memories of Mercury. In 1961, life in cocoa beach was 
pretty much black and white. We worked hard, and we played hard. The 
city was just a few miles from cape Canaveral, the Mecca of america's 
newly born space program. The average age was 29. It was exciting 
here. You know, a new era, 'cause they were putting a man up there 
in space. This was all experimental. And it showed. Rockets would 
go up and come down, oftentimes prematurely. Howard benedict wrote 
for the associated press back then. His assignment -- cover this thing 
called the Mercury program. We had the highest divorce rate in the 
country in this county back then, because of the long hours these 
guys were putting in. The tensions -- and then when they'd get a successful 
launch, the parties would just be wild, especially around the swimming 
pools in the hotels. It wasn't unusual to find a car stuck on the 
beach the morning after an all-nighter. Like its owner, usually in 
no condition to drive. Except for the reserved John Glenn, the astronauts 
were the poster boys for this work hard, play hard culture. They lived 
at the holiday Inn, and later at the cape colony Inn, now the econo 
lodge, where ap writer benedict had his office. Of course, I got to 
see some of their shenanigans, like their racing their corvettes around 
that hotel at 3:00 in the morning. Corvettes they'd gotten at a good 
price from a local dealer. In the early 1960s, when you needed groceries, 
you had to go across the causeway to the mainland. When you wanted 
to eat out, as the astronauts often did, you had only three choices. 
One of them was here -- fat boys barbecue. They were just down to 
earth people. If you wanted to find the Mercury seven, fat boys was 
a good place to start looking. We used to have big tables in here, 
and they would all sit right back here at the table and eat and have 
a good time. Fat boys became nerations of astronauts. Their pictures 
wallpaper the restaurant. I hope it was the food that brought them 
back. In 37 years, cocoa beach has grown from 3,000 to 30,000. But 
it hasn't really changed much. Because of the space program, the city 
lives both in the past and in the present. In black and white and 
in living color. John Zarrella, CNN, cocoa beach, Florida.
