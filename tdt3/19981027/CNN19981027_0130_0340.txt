NAto sources tell CNN Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has promised 
to have Serbian forces out of Kosovo and back in their barracks by 
Tuesday. That's the deadline he must meet to avoid NATO air strikes. 
The state department says it needs more signs of compliance. This 
crisis is not over. This crisis is a political crisis, generated by 
the repression Milosevic has caused in the region for the last ten 
years in this region of Kosovo, and will only be resolved in the long 
term, so that each of the problems that are identified, whether it's 
civil strife, whether it's shootings by policemen, whether it's sniper 
fire. All of these issues can only be resolved in the long-term politically. 
NAto officials are scheduled to meet in Brussels Tuesday to assess 
the situation. They already have approval to carry out air strikes 
against Yugoslavia if necessary.
