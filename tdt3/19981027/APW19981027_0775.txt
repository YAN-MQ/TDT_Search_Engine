After being outfoxed in a national vote for a powerful clerical assembly, 
allies of Iran's moderate president are turning to upcoming city and 
town elections to try to push forward his reforms. Supporters of President 
Mohammad Khatami said Tuesday that since a hard-line council will 
not have to approve candidates _ as it did in last week's balloting 
_ moderates will stand a better chance in the elections in Iran's 
10,000 municipalities. A victory in these elections, the first such 
vote since the 1979 Islamic revolution, could serve as an endorsement 
of Khatami and create a broad constituency of local officials who 
support his efforts to open up the country. ``The vote will be a chance 
for Mr. Khatami to fulfill his pledge to the people to draw them into 
the political arena,'' said Majid Ansari, a moderate member of Parliament. 
The election, which on Monday were scheduled for Feb. 26, could be 
the next big battle in the running conflict between conservatives 
and moderates fought out since Khatami was elected in May last year. 
At every step, hard-liners have battled Khatami's efforts to grant 
more freedom to the press and the arts and reduce Islamic strictures 
on average people _ all reforms that have gained Khatami widespread 
public support. In last Friday's elections for the Assembly of Experts, 
the moderates were trounced, gaining only 13 seats on the 86-seat 
assembly _ compared to 54 for the conservatives. The assembly appoints 
and oversees the country's supreme leader, and Khatami's allies had 
hoped to use it to curb the growing powers Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 
Iran's spiritual leader who in effect has the final say in political 
decisions. The moderates blamed their poor showing on the Council 
of Guardians, the body dominated by conservatives which vetted the 
candidates and dumped most progressive theologians by paring the list 
from 396 to 167. In the municipal elections, candidates will not have 
to be clerics or sit for a test on the Shiite Islam dominant in Iran. 
The Interior Ministry will be in charge of approving the 200,000 who 
will run among the expected 800,000 applicants. The winners will replace 
officials left over from the Shah's time or appointees. ``The local 
elections are very important. The criteria for running are much easier. 
Candidates are ordinary people. They don't have to be experts on religion,'' 
Mohammad Sadeq Husseini, adviser to the information minister, told 
The Associated Press. Ansari, the moderate lawmaker who squeaked through 
to a seat on the Assembly of Experts, predicted that the president's 
backers will ``achieve noticeable victory ... God willing.'' The moderates 
also are hoping the municipal elections will produce a huge turnout 
similar to that which gave Khatami his own victory _ in effect, an 
endorsement of the president. In last year's presidential vote, 30 
million of Iran's 38.5 million voters cast ballots, 20 million of 
them for the moderate cleric Khatami. By contrast, only 18 million 
voters turned out last week, and many Iranians said they had boycotted 
the vote because the Council of Experts had destroyed any real competition. 
In the municipal elections, candidates must be over 24, literate and 
residents for at least one year in the constituency where they run. 
In announcing the election Monday, the Interior Ministry said registration 
of candidates will be from Dec. 28 to Jan. 3.
