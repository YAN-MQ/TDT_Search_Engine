Brazil is braced for spending cuts and tax hikes. I'm Patrick O'Connell 
at the Business Desk in New York. The Brazilian President, Fernando 
Enrique Cardoso is to give an evening TV address outlining an economic 
austerity package. It is a much-anticipated effort to stave effort 
to stave off so-called financial contagion, including more taxes and 
less spending. Jim Burnow is a Latin American specialist with Solomon 
Smith-Birney. Certainly nobody looks forward to a recession induced 
by tighter spending and tax hikes. But, I think for the most part, 
key members of Congress are on board with this, key members of Cordosa's 
coalition. So I do think it will get past, and the idea of course 
is short-term paying for long-term gain, and that's the idea he has 
to sell politically. Easy to say of course, if you are a long way 
away. Yes it is, when you're not faced with managing the recession 
every day. But, I think it's important for them to maintain credibility 
in the capital markets. And the more credibility they have, the shorter 
the recession will be. Brazil's troubles began as investors took fright 
over the scale of the global crisis, which spread from Asia, through 
Russia, and into Latin America. They moved their money away from emerging 
markets, into so-called "safer" investments. More details of the Brazil 
package should come on Wednesday. And a response is expected from 
the International Monetary Fund with a package of at least $30 billion-dollars. 
The US, whose trade with Latin America is a large part of its exports 
is also expected to be involved in parts of the deal. For The World, 
I'm Patrick O'Connell, in New York.
