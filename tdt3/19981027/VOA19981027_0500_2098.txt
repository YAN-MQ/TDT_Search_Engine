A new report by the United Nations chemical weapons experts has confirmed 
earlier findings that Iraq did, in fact, fill its missile warheads 
with a lethal nerve gas known as VX before the 1991 Gulf War. Correspondent 
Barbara Shotaw reports from the United Nations on the results of laboratory 
tests conducted on Iraqi war head fragments. A new report from chemical 
weapons experts to the UN Security Council confirms earlier American 
tests showing Iraq put VX nerve gas on missile war heads. According 
to the new report, a French laboratory also found a product associated 
with degraded nerve agents. The report is based on the findings of 
a group of 17 scientists from seven nations who analyzed findings 
from government laboratories in France, the United States, and Switzerland 
from fragments of Iraqi war heads. Iraq has previously admitted using 
two other nerve gasses but has consistently denied loading VX in weapons. 
In June, when a U.S. laboratory first said it found traces of the 
nerve gas on fragments, it was analyzing, Iraq insisted that French 
and Swiss laboratories duplicate the tests. The report says the French 
lab found a trace of a nerve agent on an Iraqi missile war head and 
other tests found traces of a decontamination product, would suggest 
an attempt to remove traces of any nerve gas at some point. Security 
Council President, Jeremy Greenstock, says he expects to schedule 
a meeting to discuss the new report soon. It has always been helpful 
that the previous reports seem to have been confirmed and there is 
a clearer explanation in this report, as I understand it, in what 
there is there. What that means for the whole process is something 
I am not yet ready to comment on. Iraq has refused to cooperate with 
UN weapons inspectors since August 5. Until the special commission 
certifies that Iraq has destroyed all of its biological, chemical, 
and nuclear weapons, the Security Council will not lift sanctions 
imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Barbara Shotow,
