If he could see the place this week, Juan Ponce de Leon might wish 
he had taken a closer look when he passed this way in 1513 in his 
quest for the Fountain of Youth. There must be something here invigorating 
the likes of John Glenn and T.J. O'Malley. Glenn, as everyone knows 
by now, is preparing to return to space on Thursday at an age _ 77 
_ when many men are content to read Modern Maturity magazine after 
a gentle round of golf. Some of the spring in Glenn's step may be 
gone and his bones may be a little creaky, but here he is ready to 
board the space shuttle Discovery with other astronauts half his age 
to show the world, as he said in a recent interview, that the lives 
of older people need not be dictated by the calendar. Thomas O'Malley, 
known to colleagues as T.J., was the man who on the morning of Feb. 
20, 1962, pressed a black button to start the Atlas booster's engines 
and send Glenn on his way in a Mercury capsule to be the first American 
to orbit the planet. O'Malley is 83 now, still full of sass and gruff 
charm, and brimming with stories of the old days. ``Those were great 
days, and we survived them,'' O'Malley said recently at his home in 
Cocoa Beach, a town near the launching pads. He was surrounded by 
space memorabilia, including the black starter button mounted on wood. 
He seemed relieved not to be still under the pressures of that time. 
``We were all trying to catch up with the Russians,'' he continued. 
``We had a bunch of guys really gung-ho to get the job done, and we 
did.'' Like O'Malley, many of those who shared the anxiety, thrill 
and glory of the first Glenn flight in 1962 are gathering here again 
to sip at the fountain of their youth. For this moment at least, their 
years seem to decline in number like a launching clock, counting down 
instead of up. The three other surviving members of the original astronaut 
corps _ Scott Carpenter, Walter Schirra and Gordon Cooper _ have returned 
as commentators for television networks. Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom died 
in 1967 when an Apollo spacecraft caught fire during a launching-pad 
test. Donald ``Deke'' Slayton died of cancer in 1993, and Alan Shepard 
died of leukemia this summer. Dee O'Hara, nurse to the first astronauts, 
is back, remembering the day. ``It's a nostalgia trip for many of 
us,'' she said. ``John Glenn with that wonderful smile; it was a beautiful 
time in our lives.'' Carpenter, 73, who was the backup pilot for Glenn's 
flight and flew the next Mercury orbital mission, joked about a recent 
conversation with his old colleague. ``I told John I would be glad 
to stand by for him again,'' Carpenter said. ``But this time I'm going 
to insist that he break a leg, so I can go.'' As they have a way of 
doing at reunions, unfulfilled dreams cast shadows over the nostalgia. 
Some of the old-timers expressed regret that public support for human 
space flight has waned and many ambitious goals have been abandoned, 
such as the plans of Mars missions that are gathering dust on shelves. 
``People cared then,'' Ms. O'Hara said of the early days of space 
flight. ``Lots of people don't care anymore, and I think that's sad.'' 
Carpenter noted ruefully: ``We could have been further along. But 
we will get there sooner or later. Occupation of Mars is still inevitable, 
in my view.'' At the time of the first Glenn flight, the hotels, shopping 
centers and high-rise condominiums that line the beaches and rivers 
here were years in the future. So was the large community of retired 
people. Jack King, then a public-affairs officer for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration and now manager for media relations 
for a shuttle contractor here, recalled that there were only three 
or four motels, two restaurants, a few cocktail lounges and a small 
community of young engineers, mostly in their 20s and 30s. ``Why, 
we thought of John Glenn as an old man when we launched him in '62,'' 
King said. Glenn was all of 40 at the time, oldest of the original 
seven astronauts. King's most vivid memories are of the ``press invasion,'' 
as he called it, with hundreds of journalists from all over the world 
arriving in December for the Glenn flight and many of them staying 
through the 10 launching postponements, or scrubs, to the eventual 
liftoff. ``They were a hard-working and hard-playing crowd, and desperate 
for news after so many scrubs,'' he said. That brought up a favorite 
story among old-timers. One night at a media hangout called the Starlight, 
the former husband of one of the waitresses burst in, shot her dead, 
and then escaped. Some reporters splashed the story of ``murder in 
missileland.'' It is said, and the tale is too good to check, that 
the reporter for a London tabloid filed the following dispatch: ``A 
jealous ex-husband shot his former wife in a nightclub last night. 
It was the first successful shot here in weeks.'' At last count, some 
3,000 media representatives had registered to cover Glenn's comeback 
flight here, and not once have they had to turn to the police for 
something to report. George Page, who is 74, was T.J. O'Malley's assistant 
test conductor in the blockhouse at launching pad 14 on the morning 
Glenn went into orbit. At first, he recalled, there was little excitement 
or tension. ``Here we go for another one, probably another scrub for 
weather or some mechanical hitch,'' Page said of the initial feeling 
among the 40 or more engineers monitoring the condition of the Atlas 
rocket and the Mercury capsule. ``But the count got down to a minute 
or two, and there were no problems. So we sat up and began to believe 
this might be it.'' Glenn himself had reason to wonder if he would 
get off the pad that day. He recalled in an interview: ``I actually 
suited up four times and was on top of the booster one time waiting 
for four and a half hours, another time for almost six hours. It was 
no-go. I finally went up on the 11th scheduled date.'' O'Malley, the 
chief test conductor for the booster, who grew up in Montclair, N.J., 
and came here in 1958, a few months after the first Soviet Sputnik 
stunned Americans, remembered the blockhouse that day. He called it 
``a pressure pot.'' It was rudimentary by today's control-room standards. 
``There were no computers,'' he said. ``The only thing that you might 
say was one, was the timer, a clock running the launching program. 
When Glenn said, `The clock is started,' it was that timer.'' From 
a shelf in his den, O'Malley pulled down the mounted ignition button 
that had been at his control console. It was among such treasures 
as Atlas, Apollo and space shuttle models; his last job, before he 
retired in 1982, was to prepare the first space shuttle, Columbia, 
for launching in 1981. At T-minus-18 seconds in the countdown, he 
said, ``I hit this button, and then put my fist on the red button 
next to it, ready to activate the escape tower if necessary.'' Tape 
recordings caught his words at that moment. ``May the good Lord ride 
all the way,'' O'Malley said. Carpenter, in the blockhouse to handle 
communications between the ground and Glenn, followed with the famous 
benediction, ``Godspeed, John Glenn.'' At T-minus-0, the Atlas rose 
from the pad. ``Everybody was elated,'' O'Malley said. ``We all went 
to celebrate with a keg of beer.'' Thirty-six years later, some of 
the old blockhouse gang will be coming around to O'Malley's house 
for a fish fry, to bask in memories of when they were young with John 
Glenn and sent him off into the sky and fame.
