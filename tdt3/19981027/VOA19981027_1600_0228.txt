The latest rounds of peace talks for Congo Conchassa have ended without 
achieving the stated goal of a cease-fire. A communique released at 
the close of the two-day talks in Zambia, says foreign and defense 
ministers for more than 12 African nations did draft a cease fire 
agreement, but it says details for implementation of the draft cease-fire 
have to be worked out in future talks. More form VOA's Scott Sterns. 
After two days of talks, foreign ministers and defense officials from 
more than a dozen countries agreed to try and bring both sides in 
Congo civil war closer together. Zambia will lead a committee to meet 
with the government and the rebels to work out the details of a draft 
agreement on a cease-fire. Both sides were in Zambia but failed to 
meet face-to-face. While rebels were kept away from the negotiating 
table, Southern African Development Secretary General Kirae Umbwendae, 
says they were involved in talks on the terms of an eventual cease-fire. 
The meeting also agreed to address the security concerns of Congolese 
neighbors Angola, Burundi, Uganda, and Rwanda. Scott Sterns, VOA News,
