VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- In place of ailing Boris Yeltsin, Russia's 
prime minister arrived Tuesday to brief the European Union on economic 
recovery plans and seek help in coping with Moscow's worst economic 
crisis of the post-Soviet era. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov made 
the one-day trip at the head of a Russian delegation after doctors 
ordered the Russian president to stay home. Yeltsin checked into a 
sanatorium Tuesday for an unspecified ``course of restoration treatment,'' 
the Interfax news agency reported. Following official welcoming ceremonies 
with Austrian President Thomas Klestil, Primakov was to meet Prime 
Minister Viktor Klima; the head of the European Commission Jacques 
Santer and EU Commissioner Hans van den Broek. Primakov was accompanied 
to Vienna by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and others in charge of 
economic and financial policies. Austria currently holds the rotating 
EU presidency. Klima and the others will be seeking not only assurances 
that Russia has a viable plan for economic recovery but will also 
try to gague the impact of Yeltsin's health problems on Russia's overall 
stability. Primakov, the former foreign minister, has been prime minister 
for only six weeks and has yet to produce his own blueprint to deal 
with the country's deep-rooted economic problems. He is, however, 
widely respected by all political factions and is seen as a stabilizing 
influence at a time when Yeltsin has receded into the background. 
Before leaving Moscow, Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the president's 
country residence outside of Moscow, Yeltsin's press service said. 
Yeltsin authorized him to tell EU officials about the government's 
plan to cope with the latest economic crisis, spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin 
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Russia's economic crisis, 
coupled with major downturns in East Asia and Latin America, has sent 
shock waves through Europe at a time when EU governments have taken 
a major turn to the left. During their summit last weekend in Poertschach, 
Austria, the EU's 15 leaders pledged to coordinate economic policies 
to cope with financial crises in Russia and elsewhere. The Europeans, 
however, have made clear that Russia must stick by its reform course 
if it wants international help to overcome the crisis.
