This is "CNN Headline News." I'm David Goodnow in Atlanta. Thanks 
for joining us. The national hurricane center is predicting hurricane 
Mitch could cause catastrophic damage, and people in central America 
are bracing for the worst. The category 5 hurricane still is at least 
three days from landfall with maximum sustained winds near 180 miles 
an hour. Forecasters predict Mitch will bring at least 10 to 15 inches 
of rain to parts of central America. Ginger Blackstone has more. Along 
the coast of Honduras, the heavy rains and flash floods are a sign 
of things to come. Hurricane Mitch, one of the most powerful atlantic 
storms of the century, is lurking offshore. Residents of La ceiba 
were shopping for last minute supplies, looking for a Safe place to 
stay and fearing the worst. This man says "it's a grave situation. 
This hurricane is no game." Forecasters say he's right. While it's 
highly unlikely Mitch will strike Honduras directly, it will come 
close enough to cause major damage. On Tuesday, people in Honduras 
will still have to contend with hurricane-force winds. We do expect 
to have this hurricane warning in effect for Honduras for many more 
hours. Rainfall total is of 10 to 15 inches are possible over the 
mountains of honduras and other parts of central America as well. 
These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. 
Earlier, Mitch swept past the cayman islands and Jamaica. In Kingston, 
flooded streets slowed traffic to a crawl. The government closed down 
and school children were sent home. The national hurricane center 
says it's to early to predict where Mitch will land. But Belize, Mexico, 
and Cuba may lie in Mitch's path. Ginger Blackstone, "Headline News."
