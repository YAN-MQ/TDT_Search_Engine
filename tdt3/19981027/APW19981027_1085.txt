Four Jordanian soldiers who fell during the 1967 Mideast war were 
finally given a full military burial Tuesday, in Israel. The soldiers 
died during intense battles in Nabi Samuel, an town north of Jerusalem 
whose view of the contested city made it critical strategically during 
the war in which Israel captured Jerusalem from the Jordanians. The 
soldiers' remains were discovered three years ago, during an archaelogical 
dig in the area known as Nabi Samuel. Family members said that they 
agreed to requests from Jordanian officials to bury the soldiers where 
they had been found because it is an honor to be buried near Jerusalem, 
Israel TV reported. Tuesday Jordanian soldiers dressed in khaki uniforms 
and red-checkered kaffiyahs draped wooden coffins with Jordanian flags 
and lowered the caskets into the ground as military trumpets blasted. 
Eldad Evitar, a former commander who led Israeli troops in the area 
during the war, praised the courage of his Jordanian counterparts. 
``In war, we are each other's enemies. In peace, we are friends and 
colleagues,'' Evitar told Israel TV. The Jordanian ambassador to Israel 
and several Jordanian lawmakers also attended the funeral in what 
was once enemy territory. In 1994, Jordan signed a peace treaty that 
ended 46 years of hostile relations between the countries.
