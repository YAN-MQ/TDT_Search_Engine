It is 10 hours, 34, universal time. NATO ambassadors are meeting today 
in Brussels to determine if Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic 
has fully complied with UN demands to reduce his forces in Kosovo. 
NATO has given President Milosevic until 19 hours, universal time 
today to remove his security forces or face the threat of air strikes 
against Serbian military targets. Troop movements are under way in 
the majority Albanian province. But it is not clear whether President 
Milosevic is meeting the terms of the U.S. mediated Kosovo Agreement. 
A White House spokesman said the NATO allies want to make sure that 
troop movements are a real withdrawal and not a reconfiguration of 
forces.
