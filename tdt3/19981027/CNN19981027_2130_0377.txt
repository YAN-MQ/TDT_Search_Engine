The FAA says flying and Viagra don't mix. The "Dallas morning news" 
reports it's warning pilots not to fly for at least six hours after 
taking Viagra. The impotence drug can make it difficult to distinguish 
between green and blue colors that are often used in cockpit displays 
and taxiway lights. Not being able to see the colors clearly would 
make it dangerous to fly, especially at night or during bad weather.
