Republican congressional leaders called on President Clinton on Tuesday 
not to release Jonathan Pollard, the convicted spy, saying he still 
represents a threat to national security. During last week's Middle 
East peace talks, President Clinton agreed to review Pollard's case, 
after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel made his release 
a last-minute stumbling block in the negotiations with the Palestinians. 
The White House insists the president made no agreement with the Israelis 
for Pollard's eventual release, but the Republicans are suspicious 
that Pollard might be granted parole at some later date. Many people 
in U.S. intelligence and law enforcement have been angered that Pollard's 
case became a point of negotiation in the peace talks. They believe 
he was one of the most damaging spies of the 1980s by turning over 
huge volumes of highly classified materials. In a letter issued on 
Monday to the president and signed by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and the chairmen of the House and 
Senate intelligence committees, the Republicans said that Clinton 
should again deny clemency for Pollard. They warned that ``should 
Pollard be released, there is every reason to believe, based on his 
own statements, that he would resume his treacherous conduct.'' In 
response, the White House said on Monday that ``the president has 
made no commitments or predeterminations for the release of Pollard.'' 
It said Clinton merely agreed to review Pollard's case. Arrested in 
1985 for spying for Israel while working as a Naval intelligence analyst, 
Pollard was sentenced to life in prison in 1987. Clinton has twice 
before reviewed the case, and twice denied clemency.
