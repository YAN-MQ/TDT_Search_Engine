Genocide suspects from Rwanda have started a hunger strike at the 
UN Rwandan war crimes tribunal in Tanzania. Sonya Lawrence Green reports 
25 of the court's prisoners started the strike although two of them 
resumed eating Tuesday. Of the 32 Rwandan suspects in custody at the 
tribunal, 25 sent a letter to the registrar of the tribunal complaining 
that their human rights are being violated because they did not get 
assigned their favorite defense lawyers. The prisoners' hunger strike 
has drawn little sympathy from the Tribunal, which issued a strongly-worded 
rebuke. The tribunal has retained 41 lawyers from around the world 
to defend the suspects. It is spending $9 million this year on defense 
teams and allows the prisoners to hand-pick their lawyers from a short 
list of six candidates. The tribunal says the assignment of defense 
lawyers is more than fair. And that the hunger strike is unwarranted. 
It said the Genocide suspects are just realizing the gravity of their 
situation and feel they have nothing to lose by engaging in protests. 
These suspects are charged with grave crimes including murder, rape, 
genocide and crimes against humanity. The detainees face life in prison, 
if found guilty by the tribunal. Two have already been handed life 
sentences. One suspect, Hassan Igasi earlier this year attempted to 
kill himself by eating laundry detergent, which was supposed to be 
used to clean his jail cell. He received medical treatment and lived. 
Now, those on hunger strike will most likely get top medical care 
are in little danger of doing much damage to themselves. That contrasts 
sharply with what their fate could have been if jailed inside Rwanda. 
Rwanda has already executed several genocide ring leaders and tens 
of thousands of other genocide suspects are languishing in overcrowded 
jails. Sonya Lawrence Green for VOA News, East Africa Bureau.
