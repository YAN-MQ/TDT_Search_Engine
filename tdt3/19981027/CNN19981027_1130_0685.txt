Calcium has long been known to protect against the brittle bone condition 
osteoporosis. New findings suggest calcium also may help prevent a 
more deadly disease, colon cancer. A study in "the journal of the 
American medical association" followed 70 people at risk for colon 
cancer. Half made no change in diet, while the other half increased 
calcium intake from low-fat dairy foods to about 1,500 milligrams 
a day. After a year, the research, paid for by the national dairy 
council, found the group that got the extra calcium was less at risk 
for developing colon cancer. What calcium appears to do is bind both 
fatty acid and bile acid within the colon to prevent them from interacting 
with the colon lining Five glasses of milk, five yogurts or almost 
a half pound of cheese would deliver 1,500 milligrams of calcium. 
But before you start adding a lot more calcium to your diet, consider 
that other research has linked too much calcium to prostate cancer.
