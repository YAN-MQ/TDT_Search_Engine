It's the end of the line for another hedge fund. Mounting overseas 
losses have reportedly prompted billionaire financier george soros 
to close the $1.5 billion Quantum emerging market growth fund. That 
fund has lost more than 31% this year. Published reports also say 
soros wants to merge the quota and quasar international funds because 
a key fund manager is taking a temporary medical leave.
