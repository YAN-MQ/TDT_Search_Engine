Efforts to end the conflict in Guinea-Bissau suffered a setback Tuesday 
when a meeting between the West African nation's warring factions 
was called off, news reports said. The country's President and the 
former army chief seeking to oust him were due to meet Tuesday for 
their first face-to-face talks since the military rebellion erupted 
June 7. But President Joao Bernardo Vieira and Brig. Ansumane Mane 
called the meeting off because they were unable to agree on a venue, 
Portuguese state radio Antena 1 reported. They later rescheduled their 
planned meeting for Wednesday in Gambia, about 200 kilometers (124 
miles) north of Guinea-Bissau, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported, 
citing government sources. The insurgents could not confirm that the 
Gambia talks would take place, Lusa said. The ambassadors of Portugal, 
France and Sweden were behind the latest effort to bring the foes 
together. Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama told reporters in 
Lisbon that Vieira and Mane would abide by a cease-fire until the 
talks were held. A truce had been in place since July 26 but fighting 
restarted 10 days ago, deepening the plight of some 500,000 displaced 
people in the country of 1 million. The breakaway military faction 
controls most of the country. Government forces, constituted mainly 
of troops from neighboring Senegal, are pinned in the capital Bissau. 
Senegalese soldiers turned back the first aid trucks sent to reach 
displaced people in Prabis, a small town near Bissau, World Food Program 
spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said Tuesday in Geneva. The three-truck 
convoy had to return to Bissau because the soldiers said it lacked 
the necessary authorization. Some 70,000 to 100,000 people in Prabis 
have not received any supplies since Oct. 18, Berthiaume said. Guinea-Bissau, 
wedged between Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, is one of the world's 
poorest countries, with an average annual income of about dlrs 250 
per capita in 1997.
