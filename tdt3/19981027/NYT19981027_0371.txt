IBM Corp. said Tuesday that its board had authorized the repurchase 
of an additional $3.5 billion worth of common shares. Shares of IBM 
gained 62.5 cents, to $143.6875, on the announcement. Like other companies, 
IBM regularly repurchases shares as a way to increase per-share earnings 
by reducing the number of shares outstanding. Although popular with 
selling shareholders _ typically large institutions that receive cash 
_ the practice is also controversial, particularly for technology 
companies and other so-called growth sectors. Such companies are expected 
to create new products and services that should generate earnings 
growth, rather than buying growth by share repurchases. IBM, which 
last week reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings, 
said it planned to buy shares on the open market from time to time, 
depending on market conditions. The company has about 922.9 million 
shares outstanding. IBM announced a $3.5 billion buyback in April 
as well, and has authorized eight repurchases totaling $23 billion 
since the program started in 1994. ``This was pretty much expected 
because they had run down much of the last repurchase,'' said Steven 
Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``I think it's 
a reasonable use of cash. How many investment opportunities do they 
have that can return cost of capital? They should be investing up 
to that point, and beyond that they should return cash to the shareholders.'' 
But Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research, called the repurchase 
a ``Wall Street perversion,'' that benefits selling institutions to 
society's detriment and artificially inflates current earnings and 
growth. ``IBM has already spent several small countries' GDPs on share 
repurchases _ $23 billion and counting _ without creating a single 
product or a single job,'' he said. ``It's a signal they don't have 
the imagination or creativity to employ the capital more productively.'' 
Last week IBM reported a quarterly profit of $1.49 billion, or $1.56 
a diluted share, compared with $1.36 billion, or $1.35 a share, in 
the 1997 quarter. Revenue for the period increased 8 percent, to $20.1 
billion. The results were slightly above analysts' expectations of 
$1.53 a share, according to First Call.
