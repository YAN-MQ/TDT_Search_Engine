The treasury department says banks must do more to protect their customers' 
privacy. The department says even though some banks are protecting 
confidential information, many are not. Some financial services release 
customer information to other agencies. Although there are laws to 
prevent this, the treasury department says they often don't work. 
It encourages banks to adopt its own voluntary guidelines to ensure 
customer information isn't given out without permission.
