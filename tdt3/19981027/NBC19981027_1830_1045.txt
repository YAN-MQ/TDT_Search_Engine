Still ahead -- the original guy with the right stuff. What does Chuck 
yeager, the man who broke the sound barrier, think of John glenn's 
new mission? Winter-- the worst season for skin. Cold air, dry heat, 
all contribute to make your skin... drier than any other time of year. 
There is a way to fight winter dryness-- oil of Olay. Every moisturizing 
product we make, from our body wash... to our daily U.V. protectant, 
combats winter dryness, leaves your skin soft and smooth. Why spend 
another winter with dry skin when there's oil of Olay?
