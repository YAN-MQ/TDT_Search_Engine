Japanese electronics giant Toshiba Corp. posted losses of more than 
dlrs 50 million in the first half of fiscal 1998 _ the company's first 
dip into the red in nearly 50 years, the company said Tuesday. Hitachi 
Ltd., the country's largest electronics maker, also announced losses 
for the half-year ended Sept. 30. Toshiba posted a 6.4 billion yen 
(dlrs 53.6 million) parent pretax loss for the latest six months, 
against a 25.4 billion yen (dlrs 212 million) profit in the same period 
last year. Toshiba also had a 6.4 billion yen (dlrs 53.6 million) 
parent net loss for the half-year after posting a 22.45 billion yen 
(dlrs 188 million) profit the previous year. Toshiba's parent sales 
were down 12.3 percent to 1.60 trillion yen (dlrs 13.4 billion) from 
1.82 trillion yen (dlrs 15.2 billion) the previous year. The company 
blamed its poor results on a drop in semiconductor prices and slow 
demand for computers and consumer electronics. It said the Asian financial 
crisis had cut into demand for memory chips. It was the first time 
the company had recorded pretax losses since 1950, said company spokesman 
Kazuyoshi Ishiyama. Hitachi recorded a parent pretax loss of 69.2 
billion yen (dlrs 580 million) for the half-year compared to profits 
of 33.3 billion yen (dlrs 279 million) a year earlier. The company 
recorded a parent net loss of 124.7 billion yen (dlrs 1.04 billion) 
for the latest six months against a profit of 24.3 billion yen (dlrs 
204 million) a year earlier. Hitachi's parent sales were down 12 percent 
to 1.80 trillion yen (dlrs 15.1 billion) from 2.05 trillion yen (dlrs 
17.2 billion) the previous year. The company said the losses resulted 
from Japan's recession and slumping semiconductor and consumer electronics 
sales. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan's largest 
comprehensive heavy machinery maker, announced a sharp fall in profits 
for the half-year. Mitsubishi's parent pretax profits fell to 50.6 
billion yen (dlrs 424 million) from 74.31 billion yen (dlrs 622 million) 
a year earlier. Its parent net profit dropped to 29.29 billion yen 
(dlrs 245 million) from 43.3 billion yen (dlrs 363 million). The company 
said orders fell as Japan's recession caused the private sector to 
invest less in new factories and equipment.
