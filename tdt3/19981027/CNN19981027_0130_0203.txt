The FBI has announced a $100,000 reward for information leading to 
the arrest of the person who killed Dr. Barnett slepian. Family, friends 
and patients of Dr. slepian gathered Monday for his funeral in suburban 
Buffalo, New York. Some mourners brought along the children he helped 
deliver. A sniper shot the obstetrician-gynecologist with a high-powered 
rifle at his home Friday. Police think slepian was targeted because 
he performed abortions. A U.S./Canadian task force now feels strongly 
the attack is linked to four non-fatal attacks on abortion providers 
in upstate New York and Canada, over the past four years. Canadian 
authorities have had a task force in place for some time. We've recently 
joined. The FBI recently joined that task force, and we're sharing 
intelligence with them. And they with us, to see what information 
that we have that would indicate any similarities. The FBI says it 
will also look at Internet web sites to try and track down the killer.
