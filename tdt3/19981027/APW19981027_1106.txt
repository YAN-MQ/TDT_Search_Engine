The Moroccan government on Tuesday voiced support for the new Middle 
East peace accord, describing the deal reached in Washington last 
week as ``the last chance.'' ``Morocco supports the work of the Palestinian 
Authority,'' government spokesman Khalid Alioua told reporters. ``This 
accord is the last chance.'' It was the first reaction by the Moroccan 
government to the accord which calls for further Israeli withdrawals 
from the West Bank and a Palestinian crackdown on militants to prevent 
attacks against Israelis. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was in 
Morocco on Sunday as part of a regional tour to drum up support for 
the accord. Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared 
too much toward Israel's security demands and too little toward Palestinian 
interests.
