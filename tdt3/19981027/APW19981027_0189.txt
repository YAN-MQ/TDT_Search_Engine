A Indian Air Force jet flying in northern India lost control and plunged 
in a ball of flames into a remote mountainous forest Tuesday, police 
and the air force said. The fate of the pilot was not immediately 
known. Rescuers had reached the area in Himachal Pradesh state, a 
police officer in Shahpur, the town nearest to the village where the 
plane crashed, told The Associated Press by telephone. ``A village 
headman phoned us saying people had seen a plane going down in the 
forest,'' officer Om Beer said. ``We are looking for the pilot.'' 
Air Force spokesman Squadron Leader R.K. Dhingra said in New Delhi 
the plane was a single-seater Mig-2. The plane crashed deep inside 
in a dense forest a four-kilometer (two- mile) walk from the nearest 
road, the officer said. Few other details were available.
