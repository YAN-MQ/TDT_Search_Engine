Cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli security forces may be 
back on track. Palestinian agents arrested two Palestinian men today 
after they reportedly confessed to killing an Israeli settler in the 
West Bank yesterday. Israeli troops imposed a curfew on downtown hebron 
after the killing. They also banned Israelis from entering areas of 
the West Bank under palestinian authority.
