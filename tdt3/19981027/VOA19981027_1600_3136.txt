Still with oil, the United Nations Security Council Sanctions Committee 
has approved more contracts to improve Iraq's oil industry. The committee 
approved 19 contracts worth more than $10 million for spare parts 
and equipment. The contracts were for companies from Britain, France, 
Italy, Turkey, China, Jordan, and Egypt. The total number of contracts 
is now 75, worth more than $72 million. The repairs are being carried 
out in order for Iraq to meet a new ceiling for oil exports to pay 
for food and to pay for medicine.
