President Clinton will hold a White House roundtable discussion this 
afternoon on social security and women. It's an important election 
issue for many female baby boomers. On average, women live longer 
and earn less than men. The conference will be beamed via satellite 
to audiences in ten cities. The event was originally scheduled Friday, 
but was postponed due to the mideast peace talks.
