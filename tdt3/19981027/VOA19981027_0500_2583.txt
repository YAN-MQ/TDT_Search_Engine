A South Korean business tycoon crossed into North Korea Tuesday with 
a gift of 501 cattle. John Larkin reports from Seoul that it was the 
second trip north in four months for Chung Ju Yung the founder of 
the massive Hyundai group. The 84 year-old Mr. Chung crossed into 
North Korea through the truce village of Pung Win Jon. The only neutral 
point between the two Koreas along their heavily fortified border. 
The 501 cows he took with him are the second part of a delivery he 
began in June, when he took a convoy of trucks containing the same 
number of cattle across the border. On Tuesday, he also brought 20 
Hyundai automobiles. Dressed in a trench coat and hat, Mr. Chung looked 
happy but frail as he walked across the border with four family members 
and Hyundai executives. He will spend four days in the North, and 
has been promised a meeting with its reclusive leader, Kim Jong Ill. 
Just prior to his crossing, Mr. Chung, who left his North Korea at 
age 18 to make his fortune in the capital of Sau, said he had hoped 
his visit would help bring the hostile madness closer. Relations between 
the two Koreas have been icy since the Korean war ended with the Shangy 
Armistice 45 years ago. Mr. Chung's two trips north have been dubbed 
cattle drive diplomacy as they coincide with attempts by South Korea's 
President, Kim de Jume to improve the relationship. Topping the tycoon's 
agenda will be securing a launch date for a ferry from South Korea 
to a tourist resort at Scenic Mt. Kungan across the border. Mr. Chung 
on Tuesday, said he expected no further delays to the launch. He also 
wants to build factories in North Korea and explore the potential 
of its oil reserves. This is John Larkin, VOA News, Seoul.
