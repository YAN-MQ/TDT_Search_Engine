The U.S. dollar was little changed in Tokyo from a late Monday New 
York quote of 119.27 yen. Japanese electronic giant, Hitachi, has 
announced into the red in the six months to September for the first 
time since the Second World War. Hitachi has suffered a pretax loss 
of over $500 million with revenue slipping 12 percent. It blamed a 
fall in microchip prices. Japan's Toshiba Corporation says its earnings 
tumbled in the first half of the business year. But it expects strong 
notebook computer sales to help its second half earnings. And Mitsubishi 
heavy industry says its profits fell sharply in the half year to September, 
declining over 32 percent.
