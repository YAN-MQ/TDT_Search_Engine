Unidentified gunmen kidnapped a chairman of an Islamic court on his 
way to the mosque for morning prayers in southern Mogadishu, witnesses 
said Tuesday. Also Tuesday another unidentified group detonated an 
explosive devise outside a court of a joint administration recently 
established by faction leaders. Sheik Omar Maalim Nur, chairman of 
Shirklole Islamic Court affiliated with the administration, was ordered 
to board a pickup truck by the gunmen, neighbors said. They said the 
gunmen, who did not fire a shot, then sped in the direction of the 
Bermuda Triangle, a dangerous central Mogadishu neighborhood. Soon 
after the kidnapping became known court officials were seen preparing 
trucks mounted with weapons and militiamen to attempt a rescue. The 
Shirklole court has in recent months handed stiff sentences to gunmen 
for robberies and the Nur's kidnappers are believed to aim at avenging 
convicted colleagues. There were no casualties reported in the explosion, 
which was heard downtown Mogadishu, but the blast shuttered window 
panes. About five males in a pick-up truck planted the explosive devise 
outside the court and fled as the exchanged shots with militiamen 
on guard. No injuries on either side were reported. No group had yet 
claimed responsibility for the kidnapping or the blast. Somalia has 
had no functioning central government since the 1991 ouster of the 
late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and the country's disintegration 
into fiefs protected by militias.
