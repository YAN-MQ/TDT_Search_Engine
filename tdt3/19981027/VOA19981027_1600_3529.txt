Elsewhere on the Health Beat, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration 
is warning pilots to avoid using Viagra before flying planes. The 
Dallas Morning News quotes FAA officials as saying pilots are being 
urged to refrain from taking the anti-impotence drug within six hours 
of flight. A medical bulletin to be published shortly says Viagra 
can impair the ability to distinguish between blue and green. Colors 
frequently used in cockpit instrument panel displays and taxiway lights 
at airports. An FAA doctor says there have been no known accidents 
directly attributed to the pills, but that pilots should be aware 
of the potential problem.
