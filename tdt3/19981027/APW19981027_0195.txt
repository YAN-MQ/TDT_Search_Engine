A bottle of 1951 Penfolds Grange Hermitage set a record for Australian 
wine when it sold for 20,460 Australian dollars (about U.S dlrs 12,600) 
at an auction Monday. The price fetched for the rare wine topped the 
previous record of 18,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 11,000) _ 
also for a 1951 Grange _ set earlier this year, said auctioneer Stewart 
Langton, from Langton's Fine Wine Auctions. ``That's the highest ever 
achieved for a bottle of Australian wine,'' Langton said. Langton 
would not reveal who bought the Grange at the Wine Australia Shiraz 
auction in Melbourne, but said the bottle would remain in Australia 
as part of a set of Grange. Created by wine industry legend Max Schubert, 
the 1951 Grange was the first vintage of what has become Australia's 
most famous wine. With fewer than 100 bottles left in the world, the 
1951 is in hot demand because it was never released. The first commercial 
Grange was the 1952, which was released in 1955.
