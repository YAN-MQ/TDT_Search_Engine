Spanish authorities now say former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet 
is guilty of killing at least 4,000 people. Spanish prosecutors had 
originally issued a warrant for 94 murders. Pinochet is being held 
in Britain on that warrant. His lawyers argue he has diplomatic immunity 
as a former head of state, and spain has no jurisdiction over offenses 
he allegedly committed in Chile. British authorities say they have 
received another warrant for Pinochet's arrest from Switzerland. His 
lawyers say if Britain extradites Pinochet for trial then theoretically, 
queen Elizabeth could endure the same fate.
