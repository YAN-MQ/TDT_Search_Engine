One of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record is off the coast 
of Central America and is threatening millions of people from Mexico 
to South America. As correspondent, Greg Clacus reports, Hurricane 
Mitch is bringing heavy rains to Honduras and Nicaragua. Heavy rains 
are falling along the Central American coast, as the eye of Hurricane 
Mitch approaches off shore. Hondurans in many areas along the northern 
coast are standing in long lines to buy essential items like food, 
water and gasoline. In the town of El Progresso, Honduran Army units 
evacuated more than 5,000 people living in low-lying banana plantations. 
Several rivers in Honduras have already overflowed their banks. Army 
spokesmen say they will not be able to evacuate everyone who is threatened 
by Mitch, because they lack the transport vehicles and planes that 
would be necessary for such a massive operation. The last time Honduras 
was hit by monster hurricane was in 197 when Hurricane Fifi caused 
massive damage and killed some 2,000 people. Greg Clacus, VOA News, 
Mexico City.
