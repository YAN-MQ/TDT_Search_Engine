Today's launch carried on board a man who's a hero for more than one 
American generation. Today as people watched in cities and small towns 
and classrooms, for a time at least it seemed a little bit like 1962 
all over again, and they watched in what are expected to turn out 
to be record numbers. Our report on that from NBC news correspondent 
Bob Faw. It is a journey of science and sentiment and everywhere it 
seemed the nation stopped whatever it was doing and watched. Traveling 
at a speed of 2, 0509 miles an hour. We wish John Glenn godspeed. 
If only for a few moments the country was united. The continuingling. 
And cheers at the air and space mue seem in Washington alongside John 
Glenn's original capsule. Applause from the Florida beaches overflowing 
with spectators. I think it's the most wonderful thing. Makes you 
proud to be an American. From the giant TV screen atop Times Square 
to a Maryland community center where children counted down. Four, 
three, two, one. Children everywhere watching in wide-eyed wonder 
all eyes on the Glenn launch. I thought it was amazing to see something 
like this. And a chord struck was not just patriotic. There were Sal 
Utes from a pub. If you're young enough and you feel young enough, 
you do what you want. 36 years ago John Glenn thrilled us with the 
sense of possibility. This time he thrilled older Americans when he 
left conventional definitions on the launch pad. Every time you hear 
the word old, old gets older. I think it's cool. I should get so old 
and do a cool thing. For this flight there is a common bond between 
older and younger Americans. Pride. My dream is to be a space man, 
too like John Glenn. American heroes, you know, we need more of them. 
A hero going back up there and for a moment at least, making us feel 
better down here. Bob Faw, Washington.
