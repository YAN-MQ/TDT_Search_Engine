The bowl championship rankings are out, should Ohio state be nervous? 
Ranked number one in every major poll, it comes out second to UCLA. 
I think it's way, way too early to start talking about that and start 
speculating about that. Let's let the season run its course and see 
what happens. If we won all our football games, though, I would hope 
to play for all the marbles. The new standings are based on polls, 
computer ratings, strength of schedule and losses. They will determine 
the two teams in the fiesta bowl January 4th for a shot at the national 
championship.
