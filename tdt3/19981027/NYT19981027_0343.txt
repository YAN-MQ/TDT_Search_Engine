Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. on Tuesday reported losses for the 
six months ended Sept. 30, illustrating how even Japan's vaunted high-technology 
companies are vulnerable to its deep economic malaise. The companies 
blamed the worldwide decline in sales of memory chips, weak consumer 
demand in their home market and falling capital investment in Japan 
for the bulk of their problems. Late last week, NEC Corp. also announced 
losses, and both Toshiba and Hitachi said Tuesday that they did not 
expect to post a profit until the fiscal year ending March 2000. Fujitsu 
Ltd. alone among Japan's large memory-chip manufacturers expects to 
see a profit this year, as the price of the most widely used memory 
chip, the dynamic-random-access-memory chip, or D-RAM, has fallen 
roughly 60 percent. In the six months ended Sept. 30, Toshiba lost 
6.4 billion yen, or about $54 million at current exchange rates, compared 
with a profit of 22.4 billion yen in the comparable period last year. 
Sales dropped more than 12 percent, to 1.59 trillion yen, or $13.3 
billion. Hitachi lost 124.7 billion yen, or about $1 billion, compared 
with net income of 24.3 billion yen last year. Sales slid more than 
12 percent, to 1.8 trillion, or about $15.1 billion. The losses were 
steeper than the forecasts made by Toyo Keizai Inc., a financial data 
company. Analysts said the companies seemed to have taken write-offs 
related to their computer businesses that widened their losses. Toshiba 
and Hitachi have announced plans to realign their sprawling businesses 
_ Hitachi has almost 1,000 affiliated entities making everything from 
elevators to PCs to electric power plants _ to focus on profitable 
enterprises. Hitachi said recently that it planned to pare its fixed 
costs by 10 percent and merge affiliates. Toshiba has also spun off 
money-losing businesses and plans to reduce its work force from about 
66,000 now to less than 60,000 in two years through attrition. Nonetheless, 
the investment community is pushing for more. ``Toshiba is losing 
more money on consumer electronics than on D-RAMs,'' said Peter Wolff, 
a high-technology industry analyst at ING Barings. ``These companies 
need to do some serious restructuring and decide what businesses they 
really want to be in going forward.''
