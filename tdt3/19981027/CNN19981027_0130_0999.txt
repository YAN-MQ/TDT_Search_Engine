The peacock network is shaking up its top executive ranks. Susan Lisovicz 
has the story. "cheers" -- We thought there was gonna' be a puppet 
show. "Seinfeld" -- Hello, Newman. "mad about you" -- are just some 
of the blockbuster shows that have propelled NBC in prime time. But 
the cost of developing and retaining hit shows has skyrocketed, while 
ratings have steadily declined. Now, NBC is replacing Warren Littlefield, 
a key figure on the team that paid $13 million an episode for "ER" 
with Scott sassa, a 39-year-old programming guru whose skills also 
include making deals. Now, more than ever before, it's also owning 
the content that you're putting on the air. What NBC doesn't wanna' 
have happen, and none of the networks wanna' have happen again, is 
to wind up spending $13 million per episode of "ER." Littlefield will 
help NBC do just that. He's heading a joint Venture with the network 
that will create new programming. Sassa, who was only brought to NBC 
a year ago, will have challenges of his own. NBC's venerable Thursday 
night lineup, in its first season without "Seinfeld," has suffered 
double-digit declines. All of this makes sense in terms of creating 
new program potential for the network with someone looking at this 
from a fresh angle. We have the -- the possibility of a -- of a major 
revamping of the network schedule in the next half a year to a year. 
And in addition, it gives NBC the creative possibilities of a new 
voice in the sense of Warren Littlefield taking a creative spot and 
contributing what he perhaps knows best as what NBC would need. NBC's 
Thursday night ratings declines are so bad that the network reportedly 
is close to a make-good situation. That's when a network is so far 
off on its estimates that it has to provide free commercial time to 
its advertisers. Those declines make it a much tighter race this season, 
although so far, NBC has held on to the number-one spot. Susan Lisovicz,
