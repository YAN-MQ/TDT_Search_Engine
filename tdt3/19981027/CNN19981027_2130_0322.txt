NAto secretary general Javier Solana says he has instructed his forces 
to stay prepared if air strikes against Yugoslavia become necessary. 
For now, it appears the government of President Slobodan Milosevic 
is complying with U.N. demands to withdraw troops from the province 
of Kosovo. President Clinton stresses the situation is not resolved 
yet. NAto's willingness to act, combined with determined diplomacy, 
created this chance to end the suffering and repression in Kosovo 
and put its people on the path to peace. But this is a chance, not 
a guarantee. That is why NAto today agreed to retain the authority, 
the forces and the readiness to act if Mr. Milosevic backslides on 
his commitments. About 2,000 international monitors are scheduled 
to enter Kosovo to verify yugoslav compliance with the U.N. agreement.
