Beginning next month, many airlines will honor strict new guidelines 
about the size of your carry on luggage. That means you may have to 
change the way you pack. Lori Waffenschmidt has some tips in this 
"working ahead" report. When airlines began enforcing tough carry-on 
bag rules, travelers started looking for ways around them. My purse 
now resides in my suitcase, so I'm down to two that way. So, we're 
becoming more creative. Some travel suppliers are helping road Warriors 
take it all on board. Travelsmith publishes a catalog full of clothing 
and gear designed to save space. Our belief at travelsmith is that 
you can pack for a week and still carry on. What you'll find -- lightweight 
clothes that pack smaller and are versatile. Packable microfiber raincoats. 
A black dress that folds into a small compact unit that doesn't need 
a Garment bag. A sweater that packs in half the space of a traditional 
sweater. These are all ways can you bring everything you want you 
want to bring, but still fit it in a carry-on bag. Luggage companies 
are designing smaller, more functional, carry-on bags. What we call 
a "carry-on combo." It's a very Slim, elegantly sized combination 
of two products. Number one -- a garment bag that slips very easily 
overhead. And -- a small upright, which slides right underneath the 
seat. We have in development more, still, wheel-aways that are softer 
so that they can be compressed into an overhead and actually smaller 
in size. One of the best features of this bag is that it expands by 
30%. Retractable handles are popping up or down everywhere. They don't 
get caught in airline baggage machinery and don't add extra inches 
to the bag. Most travel experts say the key to keeping carry-on luggage 
to a minimum is planning ahead so you don't leave anything behind.
