Southeast Asian officials said Tuesday a satellite television channel 
representing their countries' unique perspectives will be launched 
next year, as the beleaguered region seeks a unified voice amid increasing 
internal discord. Senior information officials from the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations met in Singapore for two days to hammer 
out operational and financial details for the unprecedented satellite 
network. The channel will broadcast six to eight hours a day of programs 
contributed by member countries, the ASEAN Committee on Culture and 
Information said in a statement. ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, 
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. 
The programs will include news and current affairs, entertainment, 
lifestyle, sports and education shows. ASEAN members will rebroadcast 
the channel domestically, through local cable or broadcast operators. 
Singapore International Media, the government-controlled company that 
owns all of the city-state's television and radio stations, has been 
appointed the network coordinator. Officials also agreed that each 
member country would help pay for operating the channel with fixed 
annual contributions. Details of total operating costs were not disclosed. 
``This channel is to enable the ASEAN countries to project their points 
of view to the region and beyond,'' said the statement. Many ASEAN 
members _ notably Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore and Vietnam _ exercise 
tight control over news and information distributed within their countries, 
and have complained that Western cultural influences are having a 
harmful impact. While the television network could act as a unifying 
force for the troubled region, which is suffering through its worst 
economic crisis in decades, it arrives amid growing discord between 
members. Presidents Joseph Estrada of the Philippines and B.J. Habibie 
of Indonesia have openly criticized the treatment of jailed Malaysian 
dissident Anwar Ibrahim, who was sacked by Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamad last month. Mahathir has publicly lashed out at this ``interference.'' 
Malaysia has also been embroiled in a series of disagreements with 
neighboring Singapore, over perennial issues like land disputes and 
the supply of water, and over recent irritants including the relocation 
of a border checkpoint and alleged military aerial intrusions. Previously 
sacrosanct ASEAN policies of quiet diplomacy and non-intervention 
in one another's domestic affairs have been questioned recently by 
some of the nations, principally Thailand and the Philippines. They 
argue that honest and forthright statements on issues such as human 
rights in ASEAN are necessary to advance the region into the next 
century.
