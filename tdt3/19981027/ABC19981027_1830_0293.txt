An ultimatum from the United States and its NAto allies appears to 
have the desired effect, at least for now, as the U.S. puts it. The 
U.S. confirms today that the Serbs have withdrawn the majority of 
their soldiers and their military police from the province of Kosovo. 
And so the NAto deadline to do so, passed, without an air attack. 
In Kosovo, Richard Gizbert. Convoys on the roads, troops heading out, 
checkpoints coming down -- The Serbs' 11th hour military exodus from 
Kosovo has brought instant results. Albanian refugees are heading 
home. Nasser kastrati was rebuilding his roof today. It was burned 
down in the fighting. But he won't bring his wife and children home, 
not yet. "If the Serbs see NATO isn't doing anything," he says, "the 
Serbs will come back." Yesterday this village was deserted. Today 
some Albanian men came back, but again, without their wives and children, 
because there is still a Serb police presence here. One problem with 
the NATO deal is that it leaves thousands of Serb police in place. 
This man badly wanted to go back to his village today. He asked us 
if an American observer team could come with him. "They can help us," 
he said. "We're afraid of the Serb police." But with no U.S. observers 
around, he headed off. People are not going to come back to places 
like this, at least not in large numbers, until they're sure their 
towns and villages won't become battlegrounds once again. For now, 
the safe thing for the refugees to do is wait and see. Guerrilla fighters 
from the Kosovo liberation army aren't waiting. They're moving quickly 
into what were Serb positions. The Serbs have already said they won't 
tolerate that. And that could provoke another crisis for NATO. Which 
is why, for all the good signs today, U.S. officials were calling 
this a "short-term solution." Richard Gizbert, ABC News, malisheva,
