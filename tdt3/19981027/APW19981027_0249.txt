German joblessness will continue its slight improvement in October, 
remaining under 4 million for the second month in a row, the government's 
top labor official said Tuesday. ``Just as in September, we'll once 
again be lucky enough to come in under 4 million,'' Bernhard Jagoda, 
the head of the Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg, told MDR radio 
in Leipzig. The average unemployment rate for 1998 as a whole also 
will probably come in slightly lower than last year, Jagoda said. 
In September, joblessness dropped to 3.96 million, or 10.3 percent, 
the lowest in two years. In September 1997, 11.2 percent of Germans 
were out of work. Jagoda said the situation would improve again slightly 
next year, with another 200,000 people expected to find jobs. Jagoda 
also pledged support for the incoming government's planned ``Alliance 
for Jobs,'' though he expected results to be slow. The program intends 
to bring together unions, industry, government and even clergy to 
brainstorm on jobs creation. ``I think that one accomplishes more 
by talking than through confrontation,'' Jagoda said. Yet he noted 
a similar initiative begun in the mid-1980s in the Netherlands was 
only just beginning to bear fruit. ``I don't know if we Germans are 
that patient,'' he said. Germany's chronic high joblessness is in 
part a result of economic dislocation after the country was unified 
in 1990. Joblessness in the former communist East Germany is a whopping 
16.3 percent, while in the former West Germany it is 8.8 percent, 
close to the European average.
