NATO ambassadors have decided against immediate military action in 
the Kosovo Crisis, but will maintain the threat of air strikes. The 
ambassadors, meeting in Brussels, acted after substantial movement 
by Yugoslav authorities toward compliance with UN demands for reducing 
forces in Serbia's Kosovo province. Shawn Burns heads the U.S. Ground 
Troops in Kosovo. What we saw was the departure of 4,000 Serbian police 
into Serbia proper. It is a lot of policemen. A White House spokesman 
said Yugoslavia had pulled out well over 90 percent of the troops, 
but pledged to continue to closely monitor the situation.
