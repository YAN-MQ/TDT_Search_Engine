American and other NATO warplanes are not in the sky tonight over 
Kosovo. President Milosevic waited until the last possible moment 
to withdraw his serb forces from Kosovo where they have been slaughtering 
ethnic Albanians. Joining me now with the latest is Jim Miklaszewski 
at the Pentagon tonight. jim? Tom, with Serb forces apparently in 
full retreat tonight, NATO has called off air strikes in Kosovo, but 
only for now. NAto's threat to hit the Serbs militarily still remains. 
With the deadline looming for NATO air strikes -- 2:00 P.M. eastern 
time today -- the Serbs began withdrawing most of their military and 
special police from offensive positions in Kosovo. In Washington, 
President Clinton hailed the news, claiming the combination of military 
threats and tough talk forced Yugoslav President Slobodan milosevic 
to call off his troops. NAto's willingness to act, combined with determined 
diplomacy, created the chance to end suffering on Kosovo. Not entirely. 
Ethnic Albanian refugees, by the thousands, began returning to what's 
left of their homes, burned out and ransacked by Serb forces. I came 
to see what they have done, but as you can see, everything is destroyed 
and stealed. And there is nothing. Serb forces left behind other, 
more deadly reminders. One refugee was killed, two others injured 
when they triggered a land mine. Along with the refugees came more 
NATO-backed observers, who will monitor the cease-fire in Kosovo. 
To make sure Milosevic keeps his word, NATO forces will remain on 
stand, ready to strike if Serb forces return -- including American 
B-52s prestaged in Great Britain and Navy warships on patrol in the 
adriatic, all armed with cruise missiles. Milosevic should be under 
not illusions. NATO will be overhead and next door. At the same time, 
U.S. officials issued a warning to ethnic albanian rebels today that 
if they break the cease-fire and attack Serb troops, they're on their 
own. NAto will not ride to the rescue. U.S. officials warn this is 
only a temporary solution. The long-term goal is for peace talks that 
lead to a political settlement. But given Kosovo's violent history, 
there's serious concern those talk also never take place. One senior 
Pentagon official said tonight, "it'll be dicey." tom? Thanks, Jim 
Miklaszewski at Pentagon tonight.
