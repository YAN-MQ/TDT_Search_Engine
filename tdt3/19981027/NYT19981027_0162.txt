Martinez Bujanda Gran Reserva 1990, Rioja, Spain. About $26. Known 
best for its Conde de Valdemar wines, the Bodegas Martinez Bujanda 
also produces a premium line of wines under its own name. Principal 
among them is this Gran Reserva, made from 50 percent cabernet sauvignon 
and 50 percent tempranillo, the best of the native Spanish grapes. 
This full-bodied, well-structured wine comes from grapes grown in 
Martinez Bujanda vineyards in northern Spain. The wine was aged in 
oak for 32 months, then given an additional four and a half years 
of aging in the bottle. Until about 10 years ago, cabernet was banned 
in the Rioja vineyards because it was not a local grape. But the cabernet 
tannins add structure, or backbone, to the wine, a quality often lacking 
in even the best Riojas. The result is a better balanced wine. Not 
surprisingly, after eight years of preparation, it is ready to drink 
now.
