Every prominent winemaker has one creation of which he or she is particularly 
proud. Robert Mondavi has his Reserve Cabernet, Francis Ford Coppola 
his Rubicon. And Bob Trinchero has white zinfandel, America's most 
popular style of wine. Most serious wine drinkers are uneasy about 
white zinfandel. Like Philip Roth's suburbanites who downplay their 
modest urban roots, many wine enthusiasts are pained to acknowledge 
that they were once smitten by something so declasse as ``white zin.'' 
But Trinchero credits his creation with helping to popularize wine 
in the United States by making it easy to drink. Trinchero, 62, is 
chairman of Sutter Home Winery, the sixth-largest winery in the United 
States. It was built, he proudly claims, on white zinfandel. ``The 
first batch come to about 250 cases,'' he said, sipping a glass of 
it at his headquarters here. This year the winery will produce almost 
four million cases. ``A lot of the experts wrote the wine off,'' he 
said, chuckling. ``They said it was a flash in the pan. They were 
wrong.'' In the 1960s, Sutter Home was a small winery specializing 
in full-bodied traditional red zinfandels. In 1972, Trinchero was 
looking for ways to give the wines even more intensity. ``So I took 
one batch of juice and drained off about 500 gallons before fermentation 
to increase the ratio of skins to juice,'' he said. The juice of almost 
all red grapes is white; the color comes from the skins. By draining 
off some of the clear juice, the winemaker intensifies the color of 
what remains. ``I fermented the drawn-off juice, barrel-aged it, and 
sold it as a curiosity in our tasting room,'' he said. When customers 
complained that the wine was too dry, Trinchero began leaving a small 
amount of natural sugar in it by stopping fermentation early. ``And 
that was it,'' he said. ``From that point on, we couldn't make it 
fast enough.'' For a name, Trinchero chose Oeil de Perdrix _ eye of 
the partridge _ used sometimes in France for white, or almost white, 
wines made from red grapes. When the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms demanded something in English on the label, Trinchero 
added, ``A White Zinfandel Wine.'' Three years later, in 1975, he 
dropped Oeil de Perdrix. Trinchero and his younger brother, Roger, 
who is president and chief executive, make no excuses for their relatively 
unsophisticated wine. ``We've brought the pleasures of wine drinking 
to millions of people who might be turned off of drier wines,'' Bob 
Trinchero said. The Trincheros also see white zinfandel as a bridge 
between soft drinks and more complex table wines. Less than 25 percent 
of Americans ever drink any wine at all; only 5 percent drink it regularly 
with meals. Most occasional drinkers prefer light, slightly sweet 
wine that can be drunk cold, most of which is white zinfandel. Most 
of these drinkers never move up to dry wines. Studies by Sutter Home 
indicate that 60 percent of its zinfandel customers stay with that 
style of wine. About 20 percent go to more sophisticated, drier wines, 
and another 20 percent stop drinking wine, said Stanley Hock, the 
winery's director of communications. The Sutter Home winery was founded 
in 1874 by John Thomann, a Swiss immigrant. In 1920, Prohibition forced 
it to close and it remained so until 1947, when John and Mario Trinchero, 
Italians who had first settled in New York City, bought it and began 
making wine again. ``We were a mom-and-pop operation, and we made 
all kinds of wines,'' said Bob Trinchero, who is Mario's son. ``The 
local joke was that the Trincheros had two tanks, one of red wine 
and one of white _ and 52 different labels.'' With 450 employees at 
three wineries in Napa County, Sutter Home is no longer a mom-and-pop 
affair. But it is still a family business. Bob's wife, Vera, is the 
company secretary and their four grown children are all involved in 
the winery. The success of white zinfandel, now also made by dozens 
of producers in California and Latin America, has led to other light 
Sutter Home wines not quite meant for connoisseurs. Soleo is a chillable 
light red; Portico is a line of three zinfandels with added fruit 
flavors. Until 1984, Sutter Home owned no vineyards. Since then it 
has acquired 4,000 acres of vines and potential vineyard land in 10 
California counties. In 1988, Sutter Home bought the Montevina winery 
in Amador County and converted it into a producer of mostly Italian 
varietal wines. With the release this year of a line of high quality 
wines, the Trincheros, for the first time, will have its name on its 
bottles. A 1995 cabernet and a 1996 chardonay bear the name M. Trinchero, 
in honor of Mario. These wines are in the $15-to-$20 range, three 
to four times the price of most Sutter Home offerings. ``We're doing 
it for ourselves,'' Roger Trinchero said, ``and we're doing it for 
our parents, who made it all possible.''
