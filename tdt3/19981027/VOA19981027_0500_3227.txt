Time once again for a musical quiz before you find out the answer, 
let me give you a few clues to the question. He is a world famous 
singer. Started his career as an arranger and producer for other big 
name talents. In fact, as he put it, he writes the songs that make 
the whole world sing. OK. Here VOA's Ray Freeman with the answer. 
He was born Barry Allen Pikas in Brooklyn, New York in 1946. His interest 
in music started when his mother bought him an accordion, because 
she could not afford a piano. But later he started playing piano and 
became quite good while in his teens. During college he also developed 
a talent for arranging and composing music. At 21, he became the musical 
director for a TV series and added to his income by writing commercial 
jingles for major American products like Pepsi, Band Aids, and Kentucky 
Fried Chicken. Barry Pikas was a talented young man. A turning point 
in his career came in the spring of 1972 when he was asked to fill 
in as the staff pianist in a New York City night club. The featured 
singer he played for in one show was Bette Middler. Barry soon took 
over as her musical director. He did the arrangements and co-produced 
her first album, the Divine Miss M, and her second album, too. Although 
he enjoyed producing other singers, he reluctantly decided to perform 
on his own and accepted the new challenge. By this time, Barry Pinkus 
was using his mother's maiden name, which is how we know him today. 
His debut album, which came out in 1973 was called simply, Barry Mannilow. 
The following year, he released Barry Mannilow II, and from that album 
came his first top ten single. Since 1974, each new Mannilow album 
has made it to the charts. In fact, in 1977, all five albums that 
had been released since his solo career began, were on the charts 
at the same time. Only two other singers, Frank Sinatra and Johnny 
Matthis, had done that before. Barry Mannilow's career continues to 
stay strong with international tours and recordings. He is currently 
doing benefit concerts around the U.S. while working on his latest 
recordings, including a tribute to Frank Sinatra. His fans come out 
by the thousands as he packs concert halls where ever he goes. Barry 
Mannilow was and is a superstar. This is Ray Freeman.
