The official who headed the Swedish bid that lost the vote to play 
host to the 2002 Winter Olympics said Thursday that he wanted Salt 
Lake City organizers to reimburse the expenses of their rival cities 
if the group is penalized by the International Olympic Committee. 
``In some ways, we spent our money in vain,'' said Christer Persson, 
the president of the city of Ostersund's bidding committee. In a telephone 
interview, Persson acknowledged that stripping the Olympics from Salt 
Lake City was impractical at this stage, and the Olympic committee 
has already ruled it out. But he said a fine that would benefit the 
three other 2002 finalists _ Sion, Switzerland; Quebec, and Ostersund 
_ would be an appropriate punishment for the existence of the scholarship 
fund that benefited at least six relatives of IOC members. Persson 
said Ostersund spent about $2 million in its bid for the 2002 Games. 
He said Sion spent about $3.5 million and Quebec $8 million, which 
would make for a total fine of $13.5 million. Persson said he was 
surprised to learn that his rivals had resorted to the scholarship 
fund. ``That was a surprise to everybody, but I'm quite sure Ostersund 
would never have won in any case because Salt Lake was the best candidate 
for the Winter Olympics in history,'' he said. ``It's sad there is 
this component in their victory now.'' While the chief of Quebec's 
bid, Rene Paquet, has said he was approached by an agent offering 
Olympic committee votes for a price, Persson said he never heard of 
such offers until the Salt Lake City scandal broke. ``In 12 years, 
I never got any requests or saw any indications that anybody was asking 
for money to deliver votes,'' Persson said.
