Like many of the Arab-Americans in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, 
Yasser Madbouly said Thursday that he was sickened to see his adopted 
country launch missile strikes on Iraq. ``This is my country now,'' 
said Madbouly, who emigrated from Egypt 17 years ago and has owned 
the popular King Falafel Restaurant on Third Avenue for 10 years. 
``My wife is American. My five kids were all born and raised here, 
and I even feel that I am a stranger now when I go back to Egypt to 
visit. ``But watching television last night and seeing what was happening 
to Iraq, it made me feel like a stranger here _ for the first time,'' 
he added as he sipped strong, sweet Arabic coffee in his restaurant 
on Thursday. ``Innocent children are dying. What we preach is not 
what we do.'' President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is no more popular 
among most Arab immigrants living in the United States than he is 
in the White House. But to those who have lived in the Middle East, 
have friends who have lived or worked in Iraq, and know intimately 
the powerlessness of people who live in the grip of a dictator, the 
latest missile strikes elicited dismay and disgust. ``America indirectly 
allows Saddam Hussein to get more powerful,'' said Hani Ramawi, a 
22-year-old Palestinian-American student at York College in Queens. 
``Saddam Hussein is a dictator,'' Ramawi added as he prepared for 
afternoon prayers at the Islamic Center of Bay Ridge. ``He doesn't 
care about killing his own people. But this makes him more desperate 
and it makes his people more fearful.'' Bay Ridge is home to a mix 
of Arab immigrants, both Muslim and Christian, from all over the Middle 
East and Africa, and a scattering of mosques as well as Roman Catholic 
and Greek Orthodox churches. While some residents interviewed contended 
that the hard-line U.S. policy toward Iraq reflects a bias against 
Muslims and Islamic countries, most said that their negative reaction 
to the latest attacks stemmed from concern for the Iraqi people. ``Saddam 
has a big head and he has bombs,'' said John Awd, an immigrant from 
Syria who works at a convenience store on Fourth Avenue. ``But I feel 
sorry for the people. I am Catholic, but I don't care about religion. 
It's a question of human beings. I don't like to hurt people and I 
want everyone to live in peace.'' Osama Elshinawy, an immigrant from 
Egypt who owns a furniture store on Fifth Avenue, agreed with that 
sentiment. ``Saddam Hussein is guilty,'' he said. ``But his people 
are paying for it even though they are against him and against his 
policies. Women and children die.'' Many people also expressed anger 
at the timing of the attacks. Ramadan, the monthlong Islamic holiday 
during which Muslims fast during daylight hours, will begin this weekend. 
According to Islam, the month of fasting marks God's revelation of 
the Koran to the prophet Mohammed. ``It's a holy month,'' said Nehal 
Hussein, a 35-year-old homemaker from Brooklyn who immigrated to the 
United States from Egypt five years ago. ``People are fasting the 
whole day. It's like Christmas.'' She said President Clinton and previous 
U.S. administrations have used a double standard in their foreign 
policy, punishing Muslim nations with force for resisting U.N. resolutions 
and handling non-Muslim countries guilty of the same behavior with 
diplomacy. ``What did Clinton do to Netanyahu when he didn't do what 
he was supposed to do in the peace process?'' said Mrs. Hussein, referring 
to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. ``Did he bomb him? 
No.'' Many Arab-Americans also expressed the kind of political cynicism 
that can be heard anywhere in the country, from the halls of Congress 
to the streets of New York City. ``A lot of people feel the president 
was doing this now just to cover himself and delay the impeachment 
vote,'' said Madbouly, the restaurant owner. ``And he got what he 
wanted. But we as Americans _ and I'm speaking not as an Arab, but 
as an American _ are really bothered when we see children being bombed. 
We all feel it's wrong because innocent people are dying.''
