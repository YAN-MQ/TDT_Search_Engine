British jets are among the warplanes flying sorties over Iraq tonight. 
NPR's Michael Goldfarb reports from London. British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair broke the news in a statement in the House of Commons. 
Royal Air Force tornado jets carrying laser guided 1000 and 2000 pound 
bombs are reported to have taken off from basis in Kuwait in the early 
evening local time. In making his announcement, Blair pointedly denied 
that the timing of the strikes was linked to the internal affairs 
of the United States a reference to the impeachment process in the 
House of Representatives. "I refute this entirely", Blair said to 
murmurs of hear-hear. After the announcement, The House of Commons 
began an emergency debate on the Iraq situation. British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cooke said, "the present military operation must bring home 
even to Saddam Hussein that we will not let him get away with his 
strategy of deceit and destruction". There has been broad support 
within Parliament for the air strikes. Michael Goldfarb, NPR News, 
London.
