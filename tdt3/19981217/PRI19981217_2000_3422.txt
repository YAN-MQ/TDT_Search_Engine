Repeating our top story of the day today, American and British warplanes 
struck Baghdad this evening in a second wave of attacks aimed at smashing 
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. At least 13 huge explosions from 
incoming missiles rocked the capitol. US defense officials said B-52 
bomber had been deployed from the Indian Ocean island of Deago Garcia 
and that Navy planes launched raids from the aircraft carrier Enterprise 
in the Gulf. Still, the House of Representatives has announced that 
it will hold a vote on whether to impeach President Clinton tomorrow. 
Republican leaders insist the country's work must go on despite the 
Iraq crisis. Democrats counter that will be sending a message of weakness 
and division to Iraq's Leader Saddam Hussein. Earlier today, the House 
passed a resolution of support for the US forces by a vote of 417 
to 5. We'll have more news and analysis of the airstrikes against 
Iraq on tomorrow's program. I'm Lisa Mullins. Thank you for joining 
us once again on The World.
