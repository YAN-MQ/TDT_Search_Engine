Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder expressed support for the U.S. missile 
strikes on Iraq Thursday, saying Saddam Hussein had only himself to 
blame. ``The use of military force is the consequence of Saddam Hussein's 
stubborn refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors as foreseen 
by U.N. resolutions,'' Schroeder said on German television. He said 
the Iraqi leader ``bears the responsibility for the reaction of the 
international community.'' ``There can be no doubt about our solidarity 
with the international community and our U.S. and British allies,'' 
Schroeder said.
