The United States has closed 38 embassies in Africa for at least two 
days to protect employees against possible terrorist reprisals for 
the American air strikes on Iraq, administration officials said Thursday. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the administration was 
taking the highly unusual step of closing so many embassies ``because 
we are concerned about general threats and the heightened situation.'' 
State Department officials said that two of the largest and busiest 
American embassies, in South Africa and Nigeria, remained open. The 
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which were hit by terrorist bombs 
in August, were among those closed Thursday. Administration officials 
said the 38 embassies were closed, in part, to avoid a repetition 
of such attacks, which killed more than 250 people and injured more 
than 1,000. Other embassies closed Thursday include those in Angola, 
Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, Uganda, 
Zambia and Zimbabwe. Several State Department officials expressed 
doubts about whether it was necessary to close so many embassies. 
But a spokeswoman for the department said: ``This action was carefully 
considered. A number of African posts have received threats in recent 
weeks, and our caution is fully justified in the current circumstances.'' 
State Department officials said that, as a precaution, they had instructed 
dependents of American diplomats to leave the American embassies in 
Israel and Kuwait and the consulate in Jerusalem. The officials said 
they were concerned that the dependents could not be adequately protected 
if Iraq used chemical or biological weapons in retaliation for the 
American air strikes. At the American embassy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, 
a spokeswoman said, ``We haven't received any specific threat, but 
it is better to be on guard and take precautions instead of having 
regrets later.'' Federal officials said Thursday that they had also 
ordered extra security at government buildings here and at airports 
around the United States. Additional police officers and guards were 
on duty at the Capitol, and the General Services Administration said 
security had been increased to a ``maximum state of alert'' at federal 
buildings.
