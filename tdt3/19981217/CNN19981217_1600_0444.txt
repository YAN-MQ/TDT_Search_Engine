House democratic leader Dick Gephardt is demanding debate over the 
impeachment of President Clinton be postponed until U.S. forces in 
Iraq are out of harm's way. The impeachment hearing against President 
Clinton is scheduled to begin tomorrow morning. The house adjourned 
a short while ago. House speaker nominee Bob Livingston and other 
republican leaders say the debate could go well into the night. No 
schedule has been set for a vote on the four articles of impeachment 
against the president, but that may come Saturday. Defense secretary 
William Cohen told house republicans an impeachment vote might affect 
troop morale.
