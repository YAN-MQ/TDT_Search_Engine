U.S. authorities are looking for five more suspects in connection 
with a Deadly terrorist attack. Peter Bergen has the latest on the 
twin embassy bombings in Africa. A federal grand jury today -- U.S. 
prosecutors in New York announced new indictments Wednesday for the 
bombing of the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on August 
7th. The blast killed 11 and injured scores of others. A nearly simultaneous 
attack on the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, killed over 200, including 
12 U.S. citizens. The new indictment adds five men to the list of 
those already charged with conspiring to kill U.S. citizens. They 
are Mustafa Mohamed fadhil, khalfan khamis Mohamed, Ahmed khalfan 
ghailani, fahid Mohamed Ally msalam and sheikh Ahmed salim swedan. 
The indictment charges that one of the men rented a house to be used 
as the bomb factory. Another man arranged for mechanical work on the 
truck that was used to transport the bomb to the embassy. And another 
man took photographs of the devastated embassy building after the 
bombing. The whereabouts of all five men are unknown. All are at large 
and are believed to have fled before or shortly after the bombing. 
The state department will today be announcing here rewards for information 
leading to their arrest and/or prosecution. The day before the bombing, 
two of the accused men flew into this airport in Karachi, Pakistan. 
One of those men was on the same flight as Mohamed odeh, who is charged 
in the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Kenya, also on August 7th. Odeh 
has told U.S. officials that he is part of osama bin laden's Al quaeda 
group, which the U.S. government alleges is behind both embassy attacks. 
The new indictment brings the total number of people charged with 
being part of osama bin laden's terror network to 14. Only four of 
them are now in custody in the United States. Peter Bergen, CNN, Washington.
