Federal regulators intend to file civil charges against Livent Inc., 
the Broadway theater producer, and some former employees for securities 
and accounting fraud, according to documents the company has filed 
in bankruptcy court. And the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan is deciding 
whether to bring criminal charges against Garth H. Drabinsky and Myron 
I. Gottlieb, the company's founders, said a lawyer representing Gottlieb. 
The lawyer, Brian H. Greenspan of Toronto, said that he expects a 
decision in the next three weeks. ``I hope the U.S. Attorney will 
review all the information and will not indict,'' Greenspan said. 
``They've done nothing wrong.'' A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney 
said he could not confirm or deny whether there was an investigation. 
The company's new management team, headed by Michael Ovitz, the former 
president of the Walt Disney Co., dismissed Drabinsky and Gottlieb 
from their executive jobs in November, saying the two had engaged 
in a widespread fraud that cost the company and its shareholders more 
than $60 million. Livent, a Canadian company, is the producer of ``Ragtime'' 
on Broadway and other shows in New York, Chicago and Toronto. Ovitz 
and his team, who took over in June, said the two men had directed 
the company's accountants to manipulate the books so that millions 
of dollars of extravagant spending on advertising, actors, actresses 
and elaborate sets were never reflected in the bottom line. The new 
managers have also said that Drabinsky and Gottlieb gave themselves 
more than $7.5 million in ``kickbacks'' by funneling Livent money 
to another company in Toronto that Gottlieb owned. The two men have 
said that the questioned transactions occurred before Livent sold 
stock to the public. They call the transactions proper dealings between 
two private companies. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has also 
begun a criminal investigation. On Wednesday, officers removed dozens 
of boxes of papers from Livent's Toronto headquarters. The company 
has also turned over more than 140,000 documents to U.S. government 
authorities, court papers show. According to papers filed in federal 
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan on Wednesday, securities regulators 
have asked the company to terminate five accountants, including the 
chief financial officer, as a step toward settling the securities 
law violations that may be brought against it. The five accountants, 
who made up most of Livent's accounting staff, were terminated Dec. 
14. But Livent has now discovered it needs them to complete critical 
reports, including financial statements for the third quarter. The 
regulators have agreed that the accountants can work for the company 
as consultants, the court papers said, as long as they do not work 
from Livent's offices. Livent has sought bankruptcy court approval 
to rehire the accountants as consultants, and a hearing has been scheduled 
for Monday. None of the five accountants could be reached for comment. 
A spokesman for Livent declined to comment.
