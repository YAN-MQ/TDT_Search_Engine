From Atlanta, this is "CNN Headline News." Thank you for joining us, 
I'm Catherine Callaway. Iraq will most likely face another night of 
bombing and cruise missile attacks. "Operation desert fox" got under 
way last night. The joint U.S./British assault is an effort to reduce 
Iraq's chemical, nuclear and biological weapons. U.S. and British 
defense officials say the first wave of air strikes was successful. 
U.S. rear admiral J. Cutler Dawson tells CNN all crews returned safely. 
They've been evaluating photographs from spy satellites to assess 
the damage. U.S. defense secretary William Cohen calls the attacks 
severe and substantial, and added that he was impressed with their 
accuracy. Western journalists have not been able to get a full scope 
of damage since they are limited to what Iraqi officials choose to 
show them. Here you see rubble and damaged buildings. It was a different 
scene last night, when the sky filled with explosions and anti-aircraft 
fire. In a briefing just a short time ago, President Clinton called 
the attack the right decision. I'm convinced the decision I made to 
order this military action, though difficult, was absolutely the right 
thing to do. It is in our interests and in the interests of people 
all around the world. Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction 
and ballistic missiles before. I have no doubt he would use them again 
if permitted to develop them.
