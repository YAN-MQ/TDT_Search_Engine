Police forced dozens of students to end a hunger strike, after one 
student participating in the protest was diagnosed with hepatitis, 
officials said on Thursday. At 4:00 a.m. local time (0300GMT), police 
entered the dormitory complex and broke up the protest that 40 students 
from Tirana and Skodra universities were staging, demanding better 
learning conditions and higher scholarships. Despite accusations that 
the protest also had political motives, Albanian authorities said 
the decision to break up the strike stemmed from a doctor's discovery 
that one student was suffering from hepatitis C. Doctors were checking 
in on the students daily. ``The only reason that the police got the 
order to do that was the diagnosis of the hepatitis virus in a student. 
It could be transmitted to the other hunger strikers'' said a spokeswoman 
for the interior ministry. Some of the protesters were admitted to 
hospital for a check-up, while others returned to their dorm rooms. 
The hunger strike began late Thursday in a disco in the Tirana dormitory 
complex. Students from Shkodra University, in northern Albania, joined 
in the protest. Two months ago, however, the government pledged to 
improve the conditions in the dormitories, known informally as Student 
City. About dlrs 70,000 are to be invested in the buildings. Student 
boycotts and hunger strikes seven years ago were instrumental in forcing 
Albania's last communist leader to call multi-party elections, and 
the spread of organized student protests significantly increased pressure 
on the government. A hunger strike by students in the southern town 
of Vlora preceded the failure of the government of Sali Berisha, who 
was president of the country from 1992 to 1997. His government lost 
power after pyramid schemes collapsed, creating anarchy and chaos. 
Berisha, who leads the Democratic Party, called on Albanians to gather 
in the capital's central Skenderbeg square at noon Thursday, to support 
the students and their demands.
