When we come back, this is a still-breaking story here in Washington 
tonight. And we're going to discuss how this news about the speaker-elect 
is being received here on the hill after this. NT to keep. My husband 
thought he was getting dinner. My daughter...A new friend. Time to 
cook the lobster! When the moment came, I didn't have to worry about 
the light being low hey! That's my lobster! Them turning out blurry 
because they were moving. With Kodak Max, I knew I'd get my picture. 
Low light, sunlight, action or still Kodak Max is all you need to 
know about film.
