The food outlook for sub-Saharan Africa has improved with recent bumper 
crops, but 13 countries face emergencies, the U.N. food agency said 
Thursday. In Somalia, Sudan, Congo and Angola, war and civil unrest 
continue to disrupt food supplies, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization 
said. The agency singled out Somalia, where a major food crisis is 
developing for 700,000 people following five reduced harvests caused 
by drought, civil strife, floods and pests. Somalia has lacked a central 
government since the ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. 
Rival clan-based militia have since divided the country into armed 
fiefdoms. ``In Angola, despite an improvement in production, the food 
supply situation is expected to tighten in the coming months ... reflecting 
the volatile security situation,'' the statement said. The rebel UNITA 
army has stepped up attacks on Angolan government areas. Throughout 
Africa, food production has improved with above- average harvests, 
particularly in western Africa, the agency said. But in Congo, the 
former Zaire, civil war that now involves at least five other countries 
and large-scale population movements have hampered farming activities. 
Military activity during the growing season also disrupted food production 
in Sudan, the agency said. Nine other countries facing exceptional 
food shortages are Zambia, Burundi, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, 
Mauritania, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Uganda. The agency will release 
a full report on the situation on Monday.
