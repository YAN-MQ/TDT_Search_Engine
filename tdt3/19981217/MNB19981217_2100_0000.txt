Clinton took an oath to tell the truth in a judicial proceeding, two 
of them, and he lied under oath and my prediction is that by the end 
of tomorrow, and early Saturday morning, there will be a vote to impeach 
this president on two articles for lying under oath in a judicial 
proceeding. He did not trade arms illegally to fund an unjust war 
in -- took it on the bible -- they all broke oaths. All men and women 
have sinned and Bill Clinton -- John: all right. All right. This is 
great. Jesse Jackson, Oliver north, come back next week. We'll argue 
which is the higher law, the Bible or the constitution, and both of 
you guys got the book. Much more, Brian Williams is next. We'll be 
right back. Big explosion. Huge exlotion. Now anti-aircraft fire everywhere. 
oh, no. The attack on Iraq continues, day two, and the onslaught of 
cruise missiles is still under way tonight. The president defends 
his actions while he's hours away from having his future decided before 
the house. And in another bombshell of sorts TONIGH$ during what has 
become such a Personal mean season in the capital, the speaker-elect 
is forced to admit the extramarital trouble of his own. 9 O'clock 
in the east. Good evening to you.
