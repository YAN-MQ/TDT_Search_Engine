When we come back, more about the latest development here on Capitol 
Hill, a personal problem for the speaker-elect. I work out to keep 
my body in shape. To help keep my mind sharp I take new quanterra 
ginkgo biloba. It helps me concentrate, maintain focus. Why quanterra? 
All ginkgos aren't the same. The patented quanterra extract was proven 
safe and effective by doctors in extensive clinical trials. And it 
increases oxygen supply to the brain. With new quanterra mental sharpness 
I feel my best, naturally.
