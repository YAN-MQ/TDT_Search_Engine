To find out how the Holocaust and Bill Clinton's sex life could wind 
up in the same thought, you will have to climb into the mind of Rep. 
Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. This man who 
would bring down the president actually made the connection. ``Have 
you been to Auschwitz?'' Hyde asked during committee hearings on impeachment. 
``Do you see what happens when the rule of law doesn't prevail?'' 
``Now I don't leap from the Oval Office on a Saturday afternoon to 
Auschwitz,'' he said, ``but there are similarities when the rule of 
law doesn't obtain, or where you have one law for the powerful and 
one for the nonaristocratic.'' So astonishing was this statement that 
it begged reaction from a New Yorker who certainly has been to the 
Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp and seen evil from the belly of the 
Nazi beast. ``My God, how dare he!'' said Elie Wiesel, Auschwitz survivor, 
Holocaust chronicler and 1986 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. ``What 
a comparison! Do you use the Holocaust to describe this affair?'' 
Leaving aside obvious doubts about the moral equivalence between Clinton's 
grand-jury performance and the state-sponsored crime of the century, 
the chairman turned completely upside down the reality about Nazi 
Germany and the rule of law. ``It was the law to put Jews in concentration 
camps, to kill them,'' Wiesel said. To him and perhaps also to the 
large majority of New Yorkers shown by polls to oppose impeachment, 
the tortured Auschwitz analogy was a graphic and dismaying example 
of the chronic overreaching by Clinton's pursuers. Hyde &AMP; Company 
keep attaching to their campaign a lofty moral purpose that others 
fail to detect. ``It is,'' Wiesel said, ``so banal.'' Whether with 
disgust, rage, sadness or disbelief, anti-impeachment New Yorkers 
have begun speaking out loud and clear on what to them is a crusade, 
with rightist zealots at its core, to ignore the popular will and 
undo the results of the last two presidential elections. They flocked 
to protest rallies this week at the New York University Law School 
and at the New School. Maybe they were too late to save Clinton from 
a Senate trial. But they were in time to add their voices to the many 
New Yorkers outraged by what they see as an attempt to steal their 
vote, which they had cast for Clinton in full knowledge, if not approval, 
of his sometimes cavalier approach to truth and to ways of the flesh. 
It is almost tempting to leave the last word to, of all people, Jerry 
Seinfeld, who was not among the protesters. The anti-Clinton crusaders 
insist over and over that this is all about lies under oath, not sex. 
But it still boils down to lying about sex. ``Everybody lies about 
sex,'' Seinfeld has observed. ``People lie during sex. If it weren't 
for lies, there'd be no sex.'' Of course, the matter is too grave 
to end with a joke. There is dead seriousness about White House mendacity. 
``I've been trying to think of an American president in my lifetime 
who didn't lie to the American people,'' E.L. Doctorow said at NYU. 
When Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon told lies, Doctorow 
said, many tens of thousands died in Vietnam and Cambodia. ``Perhaps 
the problem with President Clinton's lie,'' he added, ``is that it 
lacked grandeur.'' You could even go deep into antiquity, said Paul 
Moore Jr., the retired Episcopal bishop of New York. ``Read your Bible,'' 
he admonished anti-Clinton moralizers. King David not only committed 
adultery with Bathsheba but he also sent her husband to be killed 
in battle. Yet David remains ``one of the greatest kings of Israel,'' 
Moore said. It hardly seemed necessary to mention that Clinton's fiercest 
accusers in Congress and the news media include confessed or known 
adulterers. But NYU protesters made the point anyway during remarks 
by Elizabeth Holtzman, the former congresswoman and Watergate impeachment 
veteran. ``What is at stake,'' Ms. Holtzman said, ``is the right of 
the American people, by majority vote, to elect a president of the 
United States and not have it undone by moralizing, sanctimonious 
_.'' Then she paused. Voices from the audience filled in the blank. 
``Hypocrites,'' they said.
