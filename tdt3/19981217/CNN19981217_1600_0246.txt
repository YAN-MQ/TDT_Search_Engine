Iraqi officials say there were heavy casualties from last night's 
attacks, as well as damage in civilian areas. Photographers were taken 
to what was described as a rice warehouse that had been hit by missiles. 
Foreign minister Mohammed Al-Sahaf says the home of Saddam Hussein's 
daughter and a military intelligence headquarters were damaged. Sahaf 
calls the strikes "A crime against international law, the U.N. charter." 
He says the Iraqi government will hold the British and American governments 
fully responsible for "crimes they are committing against our country 
and our people." And it is really a crime and cowardly decision and 
attitude from Clinton and Blair to hit civilians' houses and food 
stores, which Iraqi people are striving to have it to ease their human 
suffering. And the Clinton and the Blair is now increasing human suffering 
in different means and ways.
