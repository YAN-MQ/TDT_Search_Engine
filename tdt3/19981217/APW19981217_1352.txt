Major oil producers Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela agreed Thursday 
to maintain reduced output through 1999 and to seek cuts by other 
oil producers in order to bring down supplies and improve sagging 
prices. Ministers of oil and energy from the three nations said after 
a meeting in the Spanish capital that they ``urge other producing 
countries to strictly comply with their commitments.'' The meeting 
followed similar gatherings of oil ministers from other countries. 
All were searching for a so-far elusive answer to the question of 
how to bring the price of oil higher. Crude prices, depressed by overproduction 
amid a global economic crisis, have hovered this year around 12-year 
lows, costing oil-dependent nations billions of dollars in revenue. 
The statement said Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela reaffirmed their 
commitment to the agreed reductions in June 1998, 725,000 barrels 
a day and 200,000 barrels a day respectively. The Saudis and the Mexicans 
have already announced their decisions to extend reduction agreements 
until the end of next year, the statement added. ``Venezuela, sharing 
the same spirit and resolution, will immediately undertake decisions 
required to extend its production restrictions until December 1999,'' 
the three ministers said in the joint statement. Venezuela had agreed 
to reductions of 525,000 barrels a day. Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and 
Mexico have led an initiative to cut production this year which led 
to an agreement at the end of June by OPEC, excluding Iraq, and non-OPEC 
members to cut production by a total of 3.1 million barrels a day 
for a period of one year starting July 1. Analysts and some OPEC members 
have said another additional 1.5 million barrels must be taken off 
the market to begin having an effect on prices. The officials from 
the three nations also agreed to ``initiate immediate actions to discuss 
with other producers further measures that translate into a large 
stock draw-down and improvement of oil prices.'' The statement said 
consultations will be carried out with other oil-producing countries 
and that ``visits had been arranged for the very near future.'' Saudi 
Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi was expected to fly to Norway after 
the Madrid meeting. Norway has already agreed to cut 100,000 barrels 
a day until the end of the year. A senior Saudi source, speaking on 
condition he is not identified further, said Saudi Arabia will consult 
with OPEC colleagues while Mexico and Venezuela will initiate talks 
with oil producers in their region, such as Colombia and Ecuador. 
Saudi Arabia is the leading producer among the 11-nation Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, with output at about 8 million barrels 
per day. Venezuela is OPEC's No. 3 exporter Venezuela, producing about 
2.8 million barrels a day. Mexico, which is not a member of the organization, 
produces 3.2 million barrels a day. The slide in oil prices has continued 
despite repeated attempts earlier this year at production cuts, including 
those implemented by some OPEC members. The price of Brent crude has 
traded at around dlrs 10 a barrel. A Gulf source close to the Saudis 
said earlier Thursday that the oil-rich kingdom would like to see 
a price target for Brent at between dlrs 15 and dlrs 20.
