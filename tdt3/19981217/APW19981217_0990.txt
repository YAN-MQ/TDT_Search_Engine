A group of 130 illegal immigrants ended a 17-day hunger strike Thursday 
after the government agreed to check if any of them qualify for permanent 
residence in the Netherlands. The strikers, most of them Moroccans 
or Turks, had been sleeping in wooden cots in a Roman Catholic church 
in The Hague for the duration of their strike. They began their action 
to highlight the plight of about 500 so-called ``white illegal immigrants'' 
living in the Netherlands. ``This was our last choice,'' said Gunsel 
Yungul, a Turkish man who has lived and worked in the Netherlands 
for 18 years. ``We trust Mr. Cohen, that he will react positively 
to our files.'' Secretary of state for immigration Job Cohen pledged 
Thursday that his ministry would review the files of all the hunger 
strikers and not deport any of them before Feb. 1 next year, when 
the review is completed. Last year, the government scrapped a five-year 
amnesty policy that had granted residency to illegal immigrants who 
could prove they had worked legally and paid taxes for six consecutive 
years. The immigrants involved in the hunger strike all claim they 
have lived and worked in the Netherlands for longer than six years 
but cannot prove that they have held down continual employment. As 
he prepared to end his strike Thursday, Yungul, 36, who has worked 
as a gardener during his stay in the Netherlands, said he felt fit. 
``But I will feel much better if I hear a positive answer,'' he added. 
Yungul and the other strikers were wearing white cloths daubed with 
the number of years they have been living in the Netherlands. Officials 
at the St. Agnes church in The Hague where the strikers have been 
staying advised them to call off the strike following a meeting with 
Cohen. We ``trust that the secretary of state will use his discretionary 
powers in a generous, sensible and careful way,'' the church officials 
said in a press release. Most of the strikers were in good physical 
shape, although one had to be hospitalized this week after he lost 
consciousness for three hours. The man recovered after hospital treatment 
and rejoined the strike.
