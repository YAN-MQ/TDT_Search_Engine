Even Arab governments that joined with the United States against Baghdad 
in early 1991 have offered almost no public support for the attack 
under way on Iraq. The reactions from countries like Egypt, Qatar 
and Syria have ranged instead from regret to concern to outright condemnation. 
Even Kuwait, which was liberated from Iraqi occupation by the Persian 
Gulf war, has stopped short of endorsing the latest U.S.-led military 
action. Kuwait did lend support Thursday night by permitting U.S. 
and British fighter planes to launch raids from bases here. But the 
lack of clear endorsement for the strikes left the United States and 
Britain exposed to an outpouring of anger that echoed from other quarters 
of the Arab world. The speaker of the Syrian Parliament, Abdulqad 
Qaddoura, denounced the attacks in bitter terms, saying they had ``harmed 
our people, especially the children and civilians, and increased their 
suffering and pain.'' Egypt also expressed regret and called for ``effective 
action from all concerned parties to contain the situation and stop 
it from deteriorating further.'' Saudi Arabia, the staging area for 
the Persian Gulf war and still a crucial U.S. ally, issued no official 
comment. Newspapers there expressed sympathy for the Iraqi people 
but blamed President Saddam Hussein for dragging his country into 
another conflict. And Qatar, another U.S. ally in the gulf, said it 
was ``deeply concerned'' over the strikes. On Thursday, even as anti-U.S. 
demonstrations broke out on the West Bank and other Palestinians joined 
in denunciations of the U.S.-led attack, the Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat took pains to avoid public comment. But Saeb Erakat, the chief 
Palestinian negotiator with Israel, called on the United States and 
Britain to halt the attacks. ``This region doesn't need Desert Shields 
and Storms and Foxes,'' Erakat said, using the military names for 
the current campaign against Iraq and its predecessors. ``We demand 
an immediate end to these strikes and to the siege against 23 million 
Iraqi people.'' Among other anti-U.S. protests in the Arab world, 
Jordanian women demonstrated outside a U.N. building in Amman, and 
in Cairo hundreds of students marched from a hostel to a public square, 
where the police asked them to leave. Some of the United States' most 
persistent critics in the region made no effort to pull their punches. 
Lebanon's new prime minister and foreign minister, Selim al-Hoss, 
demanded that the United States not only ``stop this aggression'' 
but also end the U.N. sanctions on Iraq. Iran, which said a stray 
cruise missile struck one of its southern cities, causing damage but 
no casualties, called the strikes unacceptable. ``Such unilateral 
attacks against Iraq will worsen the suffering of the Iraqi people 
and increase instability in the region,'' the Tehran radio said.
