Australian and New Zealand leaders gave their full support Thursday 
to U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq, calling them unavoidable. 
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that having seen the report 
of U.N. weapons inspection chief Richard Butler on Iraq's failure 
to comply with United Nations demands, he believed the United States 
and Britain had no choice but to launch the attacks. ``Any use of 
force is always to be regretted . . . (but) the Australian government 
does not believe that the United States and the United Kingdom have 
been left with any alternative,'' Howard said. ``This has been very 
much a case of it being unavoidable and inevitable that if Iraq failed 
to comply with the earlier undertakings then action to degrade Iraq's 
military capacity . . . would eventuate.'' In a special statement 
to Parliament, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said the world 
could not stand by as Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein continually flouted 
U.N. resolutions. ``Action, at the end of the day, is required,'' 
Shipley said. ``There will be some (innocent) people who will suffer 
from the consequences (but) to not act could lead to much more serious 
consequences.'' Both leaders said they would consider any request 
for assistance, but that none had so far been received. They said 
they were not given prior warning of the strikes. Australia's Department 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade urged 25 Australians believed to be in 
Iraq _ including a woman and her two children on a visit to Baghdad 
_ to leave immediately. Australians were also advised to leave Israel, 
West Bank, Gaza and Kuwait and avoid traveling there unless they had 
essential business. In Sydney, U.S. and Australian antiwar protesters 
demonstrated outside the U.S. consulate, condemning the strikes as 
an exercise in distracting the world from the ``sleazy affairs'' of 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. Australians and New Zealanders awoke 
on Thursday to the sounds of air raid sirens in Baghdad as radio and 
television stations broadcast live coverage of the strikes. Television 
and radio also carried live broadcasts of British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair's announcement he had authorized British participation in Operation 
Desert Fox, and a short time later, Clinton's address to the nation. 
During the 1991 Gulf war which drove Iraq from Kuwait, New Zealand 
sent cargo planes, medical personnel and commandos to the Gulf. Australia 
sent two guided missile frigates and a supply ship. In February, Special 
Air Service commandos were dispatched separately from Australia and 
New Zealand to the Gulf when further hostilities loomed. They returned 
home when the threat of military action declined.
