British planes joined U.S. forces bombing Iraq on Thursday, but other 
European allies kept their distance. Most, including France, blamed 
President Saddam Hussein for making military action inevitable. But 
some regretted that the U.N. Security Council was not consulted before 
U.S. missiles began flying on Wednesday, and they expressed doubts 
that the bombing would achieve its main aim: to keep Iraq from becoming 
a military menace to neighboring countries. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
of Germany endorsed the military action unequivocally. Spain, Poland 
and Portugal expressed approval with varying degrees of reluctance. 
But Italy's prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, echoing the Vatican and 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said, ``Today is a sad day, even 
for Italy.'' He asked Washington and London to call off further attacks. 
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who endorsed the first U.S. 
missile attacks on Wednesday, sent British Tornado fighter-bombers 
from Kuwait into action on Thursday. ``I have no doubt at all that 
action is fully justified now,'' he told Parliament in London on Thursday 
afternoon. In addressing the subtext of President Clinton's timing 
vis-a-vis the impeachment process, Blair suddenly stood back from 
the podium and stated strongly: ``I want to deal with one thing straight 
on. There are suggestions that the timing of military action is somehow 
linked to the internal affairs of the U.S. I refute this entirely.'' 
There were hearty cheers, but he wasn't finished. ``Had he acted differently 
out of regard to internal matters of U.S. politics,'' Blair continued, 
``that would have been a dereliction of his duty as president. Instead, 
and not for the first time, he has shown the courage to do the right 
thing, and he has my full support.'' The stirring expression met with 
no criticism in the Commons, where even Conservative members with 
little sympathy for Clinton have expressed puzzlement and dismay over 
the intrusion of U.S. domestic politics into an international crisis. 
By committing British forces to join the United States in bombing 
Iraq while other European governments stand aside, Blair thus underlined 
his position as Clinton's key ally in Europe. In Brussels, Belgium, 
NATO defense ministers did not endorse the attacks. But the alliance's 
secretary-general, Javier Solana, blamed Saddam alone for, in Solana's 
words, ``the consequences that his defiance of the will of the international 
community has entailed.'' France, which had pressed hard for a diplomatic 
solution to two earlier disputes with Iraq this year, did not hide 
its disappointment that Saddam had chosen to go back on his word and 
defy the inspections. ``Once again it is the Iraqi people that are 
suffering and will suffer, and they should be in our thoughts,'' President 
Jacques Chirac said Thursday afternoon. ``Once again, the responsibility 
is clearly the Iraqi president's.'' The French foreign minister, Hubert 
Vedrine, told Parliament that he did not see how bombing could lead 
to a resumption of effective long-term international controls over 
Iraq's ability to make and store prohibited weapons. ``The sooner 
the strikes stop, the better,'' he said. The endorsement by Schroeder, 
Germany's new center-left chancellor, continued the pro-U.S. policies 
of his conservative Christian Democratic predecessor, Helmut Kohl. 
But Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, whose Greens party has a strong 
pacifist streak, said the air strikes were regrettable nevertheless. 
Schroeder said: ``The use of military force is the consequence of 
the obstinate refusal of Saddam Hussein to cooperate with U.N. weapons 
inspectors who were looking for weapons of mass destruction, in accordance 
with U.N. resolutions. ``Saddam Hussein had to know that the international 
community could not tolerate his behavior. There is no question whatsoever 
about our solidarity with the international community, and with our 
alliance partners the United States and Great Britain.'' Secretary 
of Defense William Cohen and his British counterpart, George Robertson, 
changed plans and did not go to Brussels for Thursday's NATO meeting. 
Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, angrily ordered his defense minister, 
Igor Sergeyev, to cancel a meeting with his NATO counterparts that 
had been scheduled for Friday.
