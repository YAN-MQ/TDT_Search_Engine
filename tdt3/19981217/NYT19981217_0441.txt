Coltec Industries, before agreeing to merge with B.F. Goodrich, never 
received a formal purchase offer from the Crane Co., raising serious 
doubts about Crane's interest in the company, Coltec's chief executive 
said Thursday. As a result, Crane's lawsuit seeking to block the deal 
is without merit, Coltec said. ``The board remains committed to the 
consummation of the announced business combination of Coltec and B.F. 
Goodrich,'' John Guffey Jr., Coltec's chief executive, said Thursday 
in Coltec's first response to the Crane lawsuit. In addition, a 1995 
agreement signed by the two companies did not require Coltec to notify 
Crane if a third party expressed interest in buying the company or 
prohibit it from negotiating an agreement, Coltec said. In a letter 
addressed to Robert Evans, Crane's chief executive, Guffey said the 
lack of a formal offer and the long lapse between Crane's initial 
expression of interest in October 1995 and its follow-up efforts in 
September 1998, and other actions by Evans, caused ``considerable 
doubts as to the seriousness of your approaches.'' Guffey also wrote 
that the agreement in question ``solely required Coltec to notify 
Crane if a third party contacted Coltec about participating in an 
attempt to take over Crane, with Crane having a reciprocal obligation.'' 
In response to the Coltec letter, a Crane spokeswoman said: ``Their 
response is merely diversionary and not substantive. We're asking 
the court for a level playing field. We still don't have a level playing 
field and the agreement we have with Coltec is clear.'' On Monday, 
Crane filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Coltec 
and Goodrich, contending that Coltec, by accepting the Goodrich offer, 
had broken a 1995 promise to notify Crane of any offers to buy the 
company. The suit seeks to allow Crane to present its offer, which 
had never been publicly disclosed, to Coltec's board. It also asks 
the court to prohibit the companies from enacting anti-takeover provisions 
that make it prohibitively expensive for another company to make an 
offer for Coltec. Goodrich has said it has no plans to drop its offer 
to buy Coltec, a maker of aerospace components and industrial products 
in Charlotte, N.C. Last month, Goodrich agreed to acquire Coltec, 
offering 0.56 share of Goodrich common stock for each Coltec share. 
The deal also calls for Goodrich to assume about $610 million in debt 
and move its corporate headquarters from Richfield, Ohio, to Charlotte. 
As of Thursday, the deal was worth about $1.3 billion, excluding debt. 
In September, Crane made an informal offer to buy Coltec, offering 
is shareholders 0.80 Crane share for each outstanding share of Coltec. 
A formal offer, in a registered letter dated Nov. 20, was received 
on Nov. 24, one day after the deal with Goodrich was announced. As 
of Thursday, Crane's offer was worth about $1.6 billion. On Thursday, 
Coltec's shares rose 50 cents, to $18.3125. B.F. Goodrich rose 93.75 
cents, to $33.75, and Crane rose 6.25 cents, to $27.75.
