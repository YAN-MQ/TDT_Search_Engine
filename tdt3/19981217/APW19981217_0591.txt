BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and 
his British counterpart skipped the NATO defense ministers meeting 
Thursday in favor of staying at home and dealing with the airstrikes 
on Iraq. As the alliance's defense chiefs gathered for their two-day, 
year-end meeting, the United States and Britain continued their missile 
assault on Iraq, attacks that began early Thursday in response to 
President Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors. Russian 
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who was scheduled to be at NATO headquarters 
on Friday for a meeting of the Russia-NATO Permanent Joint Council, 
abruptly canceled his trip on orders from President Boris Yeltsin, 
the Itar-Tass news agency reported. ``The German government has clearly 
said that we politically support the approach of the United States,'' 
German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said on arrival at NATO headquarters. 
``We think that Saddam Hussein has to comply fully with the U.N. Security 
Council resolution. He didn't do that. That's why he is fully responsible 
for the military actions, which are necessary.'' NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana also blamed Saddam Hussein, but in his statement did 
not mention the attacks. He said all efforts by the United Nations 
over the past several months have been unsuccessful. ``He alone is 
responsible for the grave situation and for the consequences that 
his defiance of the will of the international community has entailed,'' 
Solana said. Portuguese Defense Minister Jose Veiga Simao agreed. 
``I have full confidence in the judgment of our British and American 
colleagues,'' Veiga Simao said. Spain's Eduardo Serra Rexach said 
the bombing of Iraq was ``inevitable.'' ``Spain deeply deplores that 
use of force, but the Spanish government has always chosen solidarity 
with the allies,'' he said. Poland, which will become a member of 
NATO next year, also expressed solidarity with the United States and 
Britain. ``We deplore the fact that a peaceful solution was not possible,'' 
said Polish Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz. ``As for as American 
action is concerned, we fully understand the reasons that led to this 
decision. We fully support this action.'' NATO officials were at pains 
to point out, however, that ``Iraq is not a NATO responsibility'' 
even if NATO members are involved. The ministers here expressed their 
deep concern at the rising violence in Kosovo and the slow pace of 
peace efforts in Bosnia. American-mediated negotiations in Kosovo, 
the poor southern province of Serbia _ the dominant republic of Yugoslavia 
_ have failed to bring Serbs and ethnic Albanians anywhere near an 
agreement. More than three dozen deaths in the province this week 
has taken ethnic tensions to new heights. Those tensions were compounded 
by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's assertion that use of a 
special NATO extraction force to pull civilian peace monitors out 
of Kosovo in emergency conditions would be an act of aggression. A 
NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted the ``growing 
noncompliance'' by both sides in Kosovo, ``the Albanians willingness 
to continue the struggle'' as well as the Serbs' ``very heavy-handed 
approach.'' NATO is creating a 1,700-man rapid reaction force just 
across the Kosovo border in Macedonia, a force the NATO official said 
``is ready to go now.'' It was created in the wake of U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke's Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the fighting between 
the government and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence in 
Kosovo. Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 forced 
from their homes during fighting this year in Kosovo, where ethnic 
Albanians make up about 90 percent of a population of 2 million. A 
senior NATO military officer said Milosevic agreed during talks to 
both the creation of the extraction force and to its planned activities. 
In Bosnia, they other area where NATO is playing a direct intervention 
role, implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace agreement is going very 
slowly. ``There is a sense that 1999 is a make or break year in Bosnia 
for the Dayton peace agreement,'' the NATO official said. ``In 1999 
the degree of impatience is going to be very high.'' Ministers approved 
a ``structural adjustment'' to the 32,000-member that will reduce 
the force by 10 to 11 percent in the next few months, the official 
said.
