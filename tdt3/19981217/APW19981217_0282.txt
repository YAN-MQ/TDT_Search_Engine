A Singapore soldier was jailed for 10 months on Thursday for illegal 
use of the Internet in a further sign the high-tech island nation 
is serious about preventing computer-related crimes. Luqman bin Mohamad 
Fadlon, a 23-year old serving his compulsory military training, used 
a company's account without permission between December and March 
to chat and play games on the Internet, reported state-run television. 
He also sold the account information to two other people. Singapore's 
subordinate court handed the national serviceman a stiff sentence 
under the recently-amended Computer Misuse Act, which seeks to enhance 
security, broaden powers of investigation, and deter cyber criminals 
with tough penalties. In an effort to propel its economy into the 
21st century, Singapore, a major business center, is actively encouraging 
Internet and electronic commerce. Luqman chalked up about 3,000 Singapore 
dollars (dlrs 1,820) worth of online time on Pony Canyon's Internet 
account, to which he gained access from a colleague who had provided 
computers services to the music and entertainment company, said the 
TV report.
