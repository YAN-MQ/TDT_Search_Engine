International reaction to the strikes is mixed. Palestinians in the 
West Bank and Gaza took to the streets today in protest of the military 
action against Iraq. They chanted "death to Clinton" and burned U.S. 
flags. Meanwhile, members of the U.N. security council debated the 
matter at a Meeting last night. U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan 
describes yesterday as a "sad day for the world." Security council 
members Germany, Canada and Japan have come out in favor of the strikes. 
But Russia and China are expressing outrage, and urging a ceasefire. 
We fully support the U.S. action against Iraq. UNSCOM was under severe 
limitations that deeply infringed against the U.N. resolution. Iraq 
should understand the consequences of holding weapons of mass destruction 
that not only threaten peace in the Middle East but also the world.
