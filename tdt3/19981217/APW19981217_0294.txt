The European Parliament dealt a severe blow to the European Union's 
Commission on Thursday by rejecting its 1996 accounts amid allegations 
of fraud and irregularities in spending. A total 270 members of the 
626-member parliament voted to withhold approval of the 1996 budget; 
225 voted in favor of approving the budget and 23 abstained. A total 
518 members voted during the parliamentary session in Strasbourg, 
France. The vote is damaging to the Commission's standing and puts 
political pressure on its president, Jacques Santer. The vote could 
be followed by a formal no-confidence vote. Under the EU treaty, the 
parliament can only fire the entire 20-member EU executive panel, 
not individual commissioners. Under Parliament procedure, the issue 
is going back to the Parliament's committee for budgetary affairs 
which will put it to vote again next March. The European Union has 
long been hounded by reports and allegations of fraud. On Nov. 17, 
the EU Court of Auditors estimated fraud and financial irregularities 
amounted to 5 percent of the EU's 1997 budget of 83 billion European 
currency units (dlrs 97 billion) budget. The EU Commission has defended 
itself against these attacks. The EU's Budget Commissioner Erkki Liikanen 
argues he has met all demands for tighter financial controls. Yet 
many in the parliament deny he has gone far enough to guarantee regular 
fraud reports, to keep national justice officials informed of investigations 
or to create an independent anti-fraud office.
