Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a veiled warning Thursday 
that Israel would hit back if attacked by President Saddam Hussein 
in response to the wave of U.S. and British air strikes on Iraq. ``We 
reserve the right to self-defense,'' Netanyahu said in a radio interview. 
``Israel will know how to defend itself. I think everyone knows what 
Israel's capabilities are.'' But even as the Israeli army announced 
that it was positioning Patriot missiles to defend against a possible 
Iraqi missile attack, Israeli officials said such an attack is highly 
unlikely. Saddam's offensive abilities are limited, they said, and 
he would not want to risk retaliation by Israel while under U.S. and 
British assault. Brig. Gen. Amos Gilad, chief of research for Israeli 
military intelligence, said at a news conference, ``At the moment, 
Saddam Hussein is preoccupied with defense against the United States, 
and our assessment is that as long as there is no concrete threat 
to his existence, he will not take steps to attack Israel that could 
embroil him on another front.'' At the urging of the army's civil 
defense command, some Israelis stocked up on gas masks and protective 
materials for their homes. In the West Bank, thousands of Palestinians 
protested the air strikes, burning American flags days after the same 
banners were hoisted to welcome President Clinton to Bethlehem and 
the Gaza Strip. Some protests turned into stone-throwing clashes with 
Israeli troops, and a 20-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed 
in Ramallah. The State Department ordered the departure of some staff 
members and their families from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, recommending 
that other Americans should consider leaving. British travel companies 
evacuated several hundred tourists from Eilat, a Red Sea resort, while 
the Israeli Tourism Ministry announced that it had enough gas masks 
for all visitors. Netanyahu, for his part, praised what he described 
as the ``composure'' of the Israeli public. ``We are not involved 
in this conflict, and we have no intention of being involved in this 
conflict,'' he said. ``But if someone will want to involve us, we 
know that Israel has the full right to self-defense.'' In the Persian 
Gulf war in 1991, Israel was hit by 39 Iraqi Scud missiles but did 
not respond, because it wanted to prevent a defection of Arab countries 
from the U.S.-led coalition. There is no such coalition today, and 
the Israelis probably would feel freer to respond to any attack.
