One thing to remember about our perspective from Baghdad, with which 
Bill blakemore would agree -- we are seeing only a little slice. And 
we are not seeing much more. As most military analysts know, hitting 
something, however it looks on television, does not necessarily mean 
you've accomplished what you wanted to accomplish. With that in mind, 
let's go to ABC's John McWethy at the Pentagon. John. First of all, 
Pentagon sources say it now appears that this air campaign will be 
over by the weekend. The U.S. has gone after more than 50 targets, 
using planes launched from aircraft carriers, cruise missiles fired 
from ships and B-52 bombers. We are targeting military or military-related 
targets, period. On the list, air defenses, factories, palaces and 
laboratories suspected of making or storing chemical or biological 
weapons. General Hugh Shelton, chairman of the joint chiefs, showed 
aerial photographs of Iraq's intelligence headquarters in Baghdad 
before and then after the strike. You'll notice down here there's 
nothing left but rubble. There were also photographs of the barracks 
of Saddam Hussein's special republican guards, before and after. Out 
of the five barracks, four of the five were destroyed. But neither 
Shelton nor Cohen could say if it the buildings were empty when they 
were hit. Cohen claims U.S. intelligence indicated the Iraqi leader 
was caught by surprise, not believing the U.S. would strike with the 
Islamic holy period of Ramadan just days away. He felt there was no 
chance the United States would take any action. The U.S. is relying 
heavily on cruise missiles. In fact, last night more than 250 were 
fired from American ships, roughly the same number used during the 
entire Persian gulf war in 1991. In one night the U.S. fired, at $1 
million each, nearly two-thirds of the ship-launched cruise missiles 
in the gulf today. Pentagon officials were quick to point out that 
more are on the way, arriving with a second aircraft carrier task 
force tomorrow. Secretary Cohen today was quick to deny that the U.S. 
was trying to track and then to kill Saddam Hussein as part of this 
air campaign. It is unclear whether that is because the U.S. has chosen 
not to do so or because no one is able to find him. Peter? Thanks, 
John. Did note that he didn't want to destabilize the regime as a 
goal but it would certainly be nice to have it as collateral damage.
