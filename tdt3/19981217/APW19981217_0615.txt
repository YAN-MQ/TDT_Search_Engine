In a tribute to a charity's recycling skills, Prince Charles unveiled 
a plaque Thursday sporting his crest _ fashioned from a broken coffee 
table. Charles, a keen conservationist, toured a former defunct factory 
that now is the headquarters of Track 2000, a charity that restores 
donated household appliances, beds and furniture. The restored coffee 
table, varnished and carved with the Prince of Wales' crest, was the 
main attraction of Charles' tour. The charity, which has distributed 
4,000 tons of recycled goods to the needy, also oversees training 
programs in carpentry and electronics for disabled and disadvantaged 
people. ``Track 2000 deserves enormous credit because the result is 
very much after my own heart,'' Charles said. ``It eliminates as much 
waste as possible, recycling useful things for other peoples' benefit.''
