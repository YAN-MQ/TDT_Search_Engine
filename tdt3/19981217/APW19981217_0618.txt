Serbian police launched a sweep operation Thursday in the area where 
six young Kosovo Serbs were killed this week, arresting 11 people 
and killing two ethnic Albanian rebels in an ensuing firefight, police 
said. International peace verifiers confirmed police were cracking 
down on a rebel Albanian stronghold near Pec in western Kosovo where 
gunfire and mortar fire could be heard, said a U.S. diplomatic official 
on condition of anonymity. The crackdown took place Thursday morning 
in an outlying district of Pec and in the nearby village of Glodjane 
_ a suspected stronghold of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army _ the 
Serb-run Media Center in Pristina reported, citing police sources. 
After officers conducting the search for suspects came under fire, 
the report said, police killed two people wearing camouflage uniforms 
bearing the KLA insignia and armed with assault rifles and mortars. 
They were said to have arrested 11 people and discovered large quantities 
of arms, ammunition and KLA uniforms. A police source who asked to 
remain unidentified confirmed fighting was going on. The international 
Kosovo Verification Mission sent several teams to the area, and American 
and other officials were holding talks with Serbian police. ``We hope 
that the presence of the KVM patrols will encourage restraint on both 
sides and contribute to calming down the situation,'' the diplomatic 
source said. Monday's brutal shootings of the Serbs, shot dead by 
masked assailants who sprayed a barroom with automatic weapons fire, 
further inflamed tensions in the province and prompted reports of 
harassment against ethnic Albanians. The political representative 
of the KLA, which is fighting to drive Serb police out of Kosovo and 
break the province away from Serbia, has denied rebel involvement 
in Monday's attack. But Serbian authorities have blamed the Albanian 
guerrillas, and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged this 
week to arrest the ``terrorist bandits.'' The state-run Borba daily 
called Thursday, in a sharply worded commentary, for the withdrawal 
of international verifiers and U.S. envoys from Kosovo, saying they 
are ``direct instigators and helpers of the crimes committed by Albanian 
terrorists.'' ``Those people should go, and relieve us of their help. 
They should return to their homes and defend them against terrorists, 
separatists, and rapists.'' Serbs held a protest rally against the 
killings for a second straight day Thursday, this time in front of 
the headquarters of the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, which runs the verifying force. About 300 Serbs whistled 
derisively and booed, and demanded an immediate meeting with mission 
chief William Walker, an American diplomat, who said he would meet 
with them Friday. Complaining that the international verifiers are 
failing to ease tensions and not responding sufficiently to the Pec 
killings, they chanted, ``Put them in chains!'' On Wednesday, 5th
