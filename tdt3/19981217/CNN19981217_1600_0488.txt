This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Friday morning. Snowfall is expected in the Great 
Lakes area, the upper midwest parts of the northern plains states, 
as cold frigid air spills across the Canadian border behind a cold 
front that will continue to move to the south and east as we go through 
the day tomorrow. Meanwhile, nice weather will continue in parts of 
the southeast. In southern California, the Santa Ana has died down 
so temperatures should return to normal. However, you can see daytime 
highs tomorrow only in the teens in the northern plains states and 
the northern Rockies. It gets even coder as we head through the weekend. 
Some places on Saturday will see high temperatures remaining below 
zero. And as we head on into Sunday, even colder in that same region. 
Snow is possible again in the Great Lakes area. Some showers to the 
south. As we move on into Monday, thunderstorms are possible in parts 
of the south and snow showers are likely to continue in parts of the 
Great Lakes area. For more weather information, log on to CNN.com.
