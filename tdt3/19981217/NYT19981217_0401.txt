In an attempt to portray the National Basketball Association as good-faith 
bargainers and sway more than 400 players, Commissioner David Stern 
has mailed out a nine-page document detailing the owners' latest collective 
bargaining proposal to the union's membership. The letter, sent by 
overnight mail on Wednesday and complete with charts, graphs and explanations, 
seemed a clear indication of how much the players and owners have 
become entrenched in their positions as they approach the new year 
without an agreement. ``As the 1998-99 season slips away from us, 
it is critical that I communicate directly to you,'' Stern wrote in 
the cover letter. ``I recognize and respect your right to reject these 
proposals. However, it is important that there be no doubt that the 
precise terms you consider to be such a `bad deal' that you would 
prefer to lose the entire season.'' In outlining the general concessions 
made by the NBA, Stern said they were made in response to ``your union's 
forceful assertion of your concerns.'' The league proposal included: 
_ No hard salary cap. _ The retention of the Larry Bird exception 
(a clause which enables teams to sign their own free agents for whatever 
they want). _ No immediate changes to free agency timing rules. _ 
A limit to the escrow tax that would be collected from players' paychecks. 
Billy Hunter, the union executive director, dismissed the letter as 
evidence of frustration on the league's behalf and added that nothing 
the document contained was news to the players. The union issued a 
formal 16-page, point-by-point response late Thursday night and said 
it would send the document to its players by overnight mail. ``I'm 
not too concerned about it, other than it hints that I haven't made 
a full disclosure to our membership,'' Hunter said. ``Our players 
are fully aware of what their proposal is. It's another effort to 
try to sweat our players.'' Hunter added: ``They know what I want. 
I know what they want. It's just a matter of getting together and 
putting it together.'' Despite the first two and half months of the 
season being lost to a lockout, no talks have been scheduled in the 
nearly sixth-month-old labor dispute _ a fight over the sharing of 
the league's $2 billion in annual revenue. Stern is leaving for his 
Colorado vacation home this weekend and may be gone for more than 
a week. Hunter, who was not scheduled to return to his home in Oakland, 
Calif., until Christmas Eve, moved up his travel plans by two days 
because of Stern's departure. With the principal negotiators leaving 
New York for the holidays, it appeared that a bargaining session would 
not transpire until after Christmas. Stern's letter was also released 
to the national news media Thursday. It contained a 12-point summary 
of the league's principal economic terms for a new deal, including 
details about maximum and minimum salaries, salary cap exceptions, 
annual raises for players, changes to the rookie wage scale and length 
of a new deal, which is proposed at six years with an option for a 
seventh year. Most of the proposals have been released in some form 
over the past two months, but several changes to previous proposals 
were disclosed for the first time. They included a maximum contract 
length of seven years for players who sign a Bird contract, an increase 
from six years. Players who don't sign Bird contracts could sign a 
deal for six years, up from five years; allowing a team to use the 
new ``middle-class exception'' to re-sign its own free agent, instead 
of limiting it to another team's free agent; and an increase in the 
maximum allowable raise, from 10 percent on Bird contracts and 5 percent 
on other contracts, to 12.5 percent on Bird contracts and 7.5 percent 
on other deals. As for when the two sides would meet again and try 
to salvage the season, Hunter could not say. But downplaying the personal 
rift between he and his counterpart, Hunter did say he had spoken 
to Stern by telephone Thursday. ``He called to say hello and see how 
I was doing,'' Hunter said. ``He wanted to dispel the notion that 
he doesn't call me. He said he'll call again to wish me a Merry Christmas. 
I said I'd do the same and wish him a Happy Hanukkah. We're cordial 
and pleasant with one another. That's not the issue. The issue is, 
when does he want to make a deal?'' ``I don't think it's just an issue 
of making a call,'' Hunter added. ``I have to feel they're willing 
to negotiate.''
