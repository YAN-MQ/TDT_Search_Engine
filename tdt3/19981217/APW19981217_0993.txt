Switzerland has asked Egypt for legal assistance with its own investigation 
of last year's massacre of tourists in Luxor, a spokesman for the 
federal prosecutor's office said Thursday. Some 35 Swiss tourists 
were killed in the attack by Islamic militants last November on the 
Temple of Hatshepsut in Luxor. In total, 68 people, including four 
Egyptians and the gunmen, died. Twenty-four people, including 10 Swiss, 
were injured. The request by Swiss Federal Prosecutor Carla del Ponte 
contains 116 questions, covering among other things the identity of 
the attackers and the weapons used, said her spokesman, Dominique 
Reymond. Swiss authorities are also seeking documents connected with 
the attack, including videos and photographs. Del Ponte opened an 
investigation against persons unknown in October. Her office criticized 
as incomplete an Egyptian report issued in July on the progress of 
investigations there. She hopes to travel to Egypt with Switzerland's 
federal police chief to talk to local investigators. Last month, Switzerland 
called on Egypt to clarify whether it will provide compensation in 
connection with the massacre. Switzerland's main travel companies 
have declined responsibility for the attack.
