Yearlong 100th anniversary celebrations of the birth of Georges Gershwin 
climaxed Thursday with a concert of classics and a warm tribute from 
Bill Clinton. In pre-recorded remarks beamed to an audience of Gershwin 
fans and international celebrities, Clinton described the American 
songwriter and composer as the ``quintessential American in Paris,'' 
referring to one of his greatest works. ``Gershwin and his brother 
Ira gave to the world a timeless gift of song and symphony,'' Clinton 
said. ``France gave to the Gershwins new and broader horizons.'' Japanese-born 
Seiji Ozawa conducted France's National Orchestra performing Gershwin's 
jazz-inspired ``Rhapsody in Blue'' and selections from his famed ``Porgy 
and Bess'' opera. Soloists included violinist Joshua Bell, pianist 
Marcus Roberts and singer James Taylor. French composer Henri Dutilleux 
presented Ozawa with the Legion of Honor, the nation's highest award 
for excellence. Gershwin died of a brain tumor in 1937 at the height 
of his career, at the age of 38.
