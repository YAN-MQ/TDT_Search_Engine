Reviewing our top story, the United States today hit Iraq with a second 
wave of punishing air strike. Yesterday, a first volley of more than 
200 sea launched cruise missiles leveled Saddam Hussein's military 
intelligence headquarters in Baghdad and four barracks of the special 
security guards who protect weapon sites. The Chairman of the Joints 
Chiefs of Staff today acknowledges that some strikes were not as successful 
as others. President Clinton vowed to complete the mission even as 
Republicans forced the opening tomorrow of the divisive impeachment 
debate. Mr. Clinton rejected Republican's criticism that he ordered 
the strikes to stop the impeachment momentum. He said "I don't think 
any serious person would believe that any president would do such 
a thing". The president appears to have public support for the bombing 
of Iraq. Three quarters of Americans support the action according 
to several polls that were released today. Still about 3 people in 
10 are suspicious that Mr. Clinton's purpose in ordering the raids 
was to delay the impeachment vote. And the international response 
to the US/British attack has been mixed. The strikes divided the UN 
Security Counsel and drew protest from Russia, China, France, and 
Iraq, but Secretary of State Madeleine Albright today said Arab leaders 
she spoke with hold Saddam Hussein entirely responsible for the military 
strike now underway.
