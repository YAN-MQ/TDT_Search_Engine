Thousands of students attempted to storm Indonesia's Parliament today 
fighting with police in the streets of Jakarta. Hundreds of people 
were injured as the students threw rocks and gasoline bombs at police 
who responded with plastic bullets and tear gas. The students are 
demanding that President B.J. Habibe strip the military of political 
powers and put his predecessor Former President Suharto on trial for 
corruption.
