The chairman of the U.S. Senate's intelligence committee said Thursday 
that he carried a message from the Israeli prime minister to Syrian 
President Hafez Assad. But Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, 
did not disclose the contents of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 
letter to Assad. Specter, who had accompanied President Bill Clinton 
during his visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories earlier 
this week, has shuttled between Israel and Syria several times this 
year in an effort to broker peace in the region. He arrived here Wednesday 
and flew to Cairo, Egypt, Thursday for talks with Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak. Specter told a news conference in Damascus before leaving 
for Egypt that he had briefed Assad on the outcome of Clinton's trip 
to Israel and the Gaza Strip. ``President Assad and I had a good, 
frank, open and extensive discussion,'' he said. He said he told Assad 
that Clinton was trying to bring the Syrian and Israeli sides to resume 
talks which were suspended in 1996. Syria demands the return of the 
Golan Heights that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu 
says the heights are crucial to Israel's security. Specter and Assad 
also discussed Iraq in their meeting Wednesday, hours before the United 
States and Britain launched air and missile attacks against Iraq for 
defying U.S. weapons inspectors. He said he had asked Assad to try 
to persuade Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to allow U.N. inspectors 
free access to all weapons sites.
