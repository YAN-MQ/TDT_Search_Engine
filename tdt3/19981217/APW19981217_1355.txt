About 100 supporters of former Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia 
were arrested Thursday after holding an unauthorized protest in front 
of the parliament. The demonstrators were led by Gamsakhurdia's widow, 
Manana Archadze-Gamsakhurdia, who said they were protesting mistreatment 
by authorities in this former Soviet republic. No violence was reported. 
Earlier this month, Gamsakhurdia's followers clashed with police in 
the Georgian capital after the demonstrators tried to block traffic 
on a central street. Gamsakhurdia was ousted in 1992 and died under 
mysterious circumstances in 1994. Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze 
told his Cabinet on Wednesday that attempts at ``using the difficult 
social and economic situation to weaken the executive branch'' would 
be thwarted. Gamsakhurdia's supporters claim Shevardnadze's government 
is illegal, and they staged a mutiny against Shevardnadze at a military 
garrison this fall that failed after one day.
