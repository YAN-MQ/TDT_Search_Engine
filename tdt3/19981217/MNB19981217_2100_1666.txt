With us here in our studio tonight, republican senator John Warner 
of the state of Virginia. He is the chairman-elect of the Senate armed 
services committee. He's a former secretary of the United States Navy. 
Tomorrow morning, senator, we will have the first articles of impeachment 
taken up by a full house since 1868. Tonight cruise missiles are in 
the air over Iraq, the sirens are sounding right now during the call 
to prayer before dawn. And we have another story tonight about the 
incoming speaker of the house and personal affairs. You've been in 
Washington a long time. This can't rank among the best times you've 
seen. You're correct. It's distressing in many respects. But this 
is a great and strong republic. It's over 200 years old. Actually, 
it's the oldest continuously functioning democratic republic in business 
today. We'll survive because of the strength of the people and, like 
you, this breaking story tonight about one of our colleagues, I've 
been privileged to serve in the Senate now 20 years. I'm proud of 
this institution. I've devoted just about everything I can to it. 
And I'm sure there's a measure of distress in all of our hearts. The 
democrats today were trying to fight the idea while American servicemen 
and women are at work in the gulf of bringing up these articles of 
impeachment. At least one republican members said today it's the right 
to discuss this in the open in the house that they are fighting for 
in the gulf. Now, that's a bit convoluted. And you could argue both 
points for days. Where do you come down? That's what we're fighting 
for, the continuation of freedom, not only for ourselves, but for 
our allies and other nations. And it brought back memories. In 1991, 
I was the floor manager with Bob Dole when, for the better part of 
three days on the floor, we debated a resolution which I had written 
in which there was a language needed to put live ammunition in basically 
a Half million troops poised to go against Saddam Hussein. And that 
debate raised, and the accusations were leveled that we were playing 
into Saddam Hussein's hands. What happened? By a mere five votes, 
my resolution prevailed, and I think the whole concept of that engagement 
militarily at that time was strengthened because of that debate.
