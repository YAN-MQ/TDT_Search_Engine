President Clinton spent Thursday in conversation with security advisers, 
congressmen and foreign leaders about the progress of the assault 
on Iraq, as an air of unreality settled over the White House about 
the mix of power politics, constitutional duties and military might 
playing out here. Clinton also held a lengthy meeting Thursday evening 
with his top economic advisers to discuss his proposed budget for 
next year, before attending a gala at the White House in honor of 
the Special Olympics. The White House remained officially neutral 
over the announcement Thursday that the House would proceed Friday 
with an impeachment debate, while the military operation is under 
way. ``That is clearly an issue for Congress to decide,'' said Joseph 
Lockhart, the White House press secretary. Referring to the air strikes, 
Clinton's four-day trip to the Middle East, and his efforts to fend 
off impeachment, Lockhart said, ``It would be an understatement to 
say that the president has been tested over the week.'' Speaking on 
the condition of anonymity, advisers to Clinton expressed amazement 
over the prospective impeachment vote and Republican criticism of 
the attack as politically motivated. ``Twenty years from now, we're 
going to look back at this, and people are going to be astonished,'' 
said one aide. ``It's unbelievable.'' Asked Thursday how he would 
fight a ``Republican drive'' to push him from office, Clinton said 
only, ``Well, the Constitution has a procedure for that and we will 
follow it.'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said that 
if the House impeaches Clinton, the Senate will hold a trial rather 
than quickly settle on a punishment with the president. Clinton plans 
to meet Friday morning to discuss the impeachment vote with Rep. Chris 
Shays, a moderate Republican from Connecticut. Clinton also placed 
calls to at least two House Democrats on Thursday who appeared to 
be wavering in their opposition to impeachment. The president spoke 
briefly with reporters before receiving an update on the military 
operation from his national security team. He began the day with a 
7 a.m. briefing in the White House residence from Sandy Berger, his 
national security adviser. Clinton made a round of calls to foreign 
leaders, including Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France; President 
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel; 
and King Hussein of Jordan. ``I think the president made the case 
that it was Saddam Hussein that precipitated this action,'' Lockhart 
said. The president tried without success to reach Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin. Vice President Al Gore spoke to Yevgeny Primakov, the 
Russian prime minister. Primakov asked that the operation be suspended, 
but Gore repeated the United States' position that the attack would 
continue until it achieved its objectives, administration officials 
said. Clinton also called House and Senate leaders, including Lott, 
a critic of the attack, to update them on the operation. Although 
White House aides resumed contacting congressmen about impeachment 
Thursday, they now regard a vote against the president as all but 
inevitable. One made a joke that reflected Clinton aides' gallows 
humor and their criticism of the tactics of conservative Republicans.``How 
can you tell a moderate Republican in Congress?'' he asked. ``Broken 
kneecaps.''
