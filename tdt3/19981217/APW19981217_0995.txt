Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart is set to sign Macedonian international 
midfielder Srdjan Zaharievski, Kicker magazine reported Thursday. 
Zaharievski, 25, is expected to sign with Stuttgart during the Bundesliga's 
winter break, which starts after this weekend's round, for an expected 
transfer fee of 800,000 marks (dlrs 480,000) from Sileks Kratovo. 
The Macedonian is set to replace Gerhard Poschner, who is joining 
the Italian Serie A club Venezia. Stuttgart is still looking for a 
new coach after firing Winfried Schaefer earlier this month. Kicker 
said that Ivica Osim, the former Yugoslav coach who is at Sturm Graz 
in Austria now, was likely to turn down Stuttgart's offer. The latest 
candidate, Kicker said, was Bernd Schuster, a former star in Spain 
who is now coach of second-division Cologne.
