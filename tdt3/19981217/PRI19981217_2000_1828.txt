For the World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC News Room in London. 
A third attack has been launched on Baghdad, the second tonight. The 
fire power comes after several hours of calm. Rahga Omar reports from 
Baghdad. Barely five or six hours after the second night of bombardments 
of the Iraqi capital began, there's been another wave of anti-aircraft 
fire going out from Iraqi batteries in and around the capital. There's 
been no possibility of making clear whether there have been further 
cruise missile or bomb attacks from American and British forces as 
part of this. The latest bombardment would suggest that most of it 
is outgoing Iraqi fire. It was triggered by an air raid warning that 
resounded through the city for about five minutes and the anti-aircraft 
fire began shortly after that. The Iraqi capital is empty. The streets-there's 
not many people out given that the earlier bombardment had caused 
many people to take cover. Iraq-the Iraqi authorities have also said 
in the last several hours that according to their information around 
25 people have been killed in the Baghdad areas. The Iraqi Minister 
of Health Amid Mithborbaric told the BBC that although this information 
was very hard to clarify given the situation, his ministry, the Ministry 
of Health thought that 25 people had died in the Iraqi capital over 
the last 24 hours and that he said that most of these were civilians.
