Patrick Ortlieb was nearly five seconds faster than the best time 
of a day before and beat out Italy's Kristian Ghedina and fellow Austrian 
Werner Franz on Thursday in the final practice for consecutive World 
Cup downhill races this weekend. The 31-year-old former Olympic champion 
took advantage on one of his favorite tracks and earned one of 10 
Austrian berths for the pair of downhills with a time of 2 minutes, 
4.40 seconds. Ortlieb's was significantly faster than teammate Fritz 
Stroble, who set the pace Wednesday down the 3,495-meter Saslong course. 
Strobl did not finish Thursday's run, falling at the S-shaped Ciaslat 
bend. He escaped unhurt. ``No doubt I like this course,'' said Ortlieb, 
who has two of his four World Cup victories at Val Gardena, in 1993 
and 1995. ``The track was icy and much faster than yesterday. The 
jumps are demanding and I expect a close, tough race tomorrow.'' Friday's 
downhill replaces the season opener canceled in Whistler Mountain, 
Canada, earlier this month. Saturday's race is the original Val Gardena 
downhill, the third of the World Cup season, in northeast Italy. Ghedina, 
the defending champion in Val Gardena, trailed the Austrian veteran 
by 0.15 seconds. ``Practice is like a race for the Austrians, who 
need to qualify. They are always very fast,'' said Ghedina, who's 
seeking his first victory of the season. ``I made several mistakes 
at the bumps, and I'm really surprised with my second place today. 
But I feel competitive for the race.'' Franz, one of the five Austrians 
to finish in the top 11, came in third, 0.41 seconds behind. Franco 
Cavegn edged his younger Swiss teammate, Ambrosi Hoffmann, for fourth 
place. Hoffmann, a 1996 world junior champion, was third in Wednesday's 
practice and is considered a potential threat. Olympic downhill champion 
Jean-Luc Cretier of France was sixth, 0.67 seconds behind Ortlieb. 
``I'm skiing well and I have high hopes for the two races here,'' 
he said. Defending World Cup champion Hermann Maier and overall leader 
Stephan Eberharter, both of Austria, were not as adventerous as Ortlieb 
and finished with the 17th and 19th best times, nearly two seconds 
slower than the leader. Both, however, also earned on of the 10 places 
reserved for Austrians for the consecutive downhills. Eberharter leads 
the overall standings, entering Friday's race with 368 points. Norwegian 
Lasse Kjus, a surprise winner in last Saturday's downhill at Val d'Isere, 
and Maier have 313 and 280 points. Kjus placed 13th in Thursday's 
practice, in a tie with Canada's Brian Stemmle, the top north American 
finisher.
