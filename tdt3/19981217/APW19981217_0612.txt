DaimlerChrysler is considering taking a stake in Japan's debt-laden 
Nissan Motor Co. and not in its truck-making subsidiary as originally 
contemplated, a German news magazine reported Thursday. However, DaimlerChrysler 
Chairman Juergen Schrempp is hesitant to do so at present, according 
to an advance copy of next week's Der Spiegel. ``We shouldn't take 
too much on board at one time,'' Schrempp was quoted as saying. ``In 
three years' time we'll be measured by whether we've made a success 
of DaimlerChrysler or not and less by whether we've entered Asia.'' 
A DaimlerChrysler spokesman, Eckhard Zanger, said the company has 
been in talks with Nissan and its subsidiary, Nissan Diesel, for about 
a year now with a view to cooperation in the commercial vehicle area. 
But he declined to comment further. ``We have never commented on how 
the constellation of such a cooperation would look, were it to work 
out,'' Zanger said. Nissan too declined to comment, but said that 
in general, it is ``willing to consider business tie-ups to strengthen 
its international competitiveness.'' Daimler-Benz and Nissan said 
in July they will jointly build a light truck starting in 2002 as 
the first step toward a broader alliance. Daimler also said then it 
was considering taking a stake in Nissan Diesel. Originally expected 
to decide by year's end, the board will miss that deadline due to 
the workload surrounding the DaimlerChrysler merger, Zanger said last 
week. Spiegel said Nissan is looking for an all-around partner and 
not just for a company to take over its diesel trucks, and is also 
discussing possible linkups with France's Renault and Ford Motor Co. 
In Paris, a Renault spokesman denied the company was in any talks 
for a linkup with Nissan.
