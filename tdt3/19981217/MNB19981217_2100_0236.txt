It is not just limited to the president tonight. Through a set of 
circumstances, the incoming speaker-elect of the house, mr. Livingston, 
of Louisiana, has been forced to admit extramarital affairs of his 
own. In a statement tonight, he has said, "I've decided to inform 
my colleagues, my constituents that during my 33-year marriage to 
my wife, Bonnie, I have, on occasion, strayed from my marriage, in 
doing so, nearly cost me my marriage and my family. I sought marriage 
and spiritual counseling and have receive had had forgiveness from 
my wife and family." He blames a lot of external forces internally 
as well here, in Washington.
