Members of the Arab-American anti-discrimination committee have called 
an emergency meeting to discuss U.S. military action against Iraq. 
Ed Garsten reports on their reaction. Burning the midnight oil, working 
the phones. Why aren't you coming? We need to discuss the vigil. Agonizing 
over the U.S. attack on Baghdad. I think it's very sad to have such 
a thing take place before the holy month of Ramadan. And so, the American 
Arab anti-discrimination committee gathering in its offices in Dearborn, 
Michigan, home to the second largest Arab population outside the Middle 
East. Its members understand the objective of the attack, but do not 
condone the action. Whatever needs to be done should be done, but 
not to continue to bomb Iraq where the people of Iraq, civilians, 
children are dying every day. I believe that, as a U.S. policy, it's 
meandering into the unknown, because you just cannot wage a war against 
a country forever. There has to be a solution a stop to it. Are the 
attacks a diversion to President Clinton's political problems? It's 
not bad timing, if you want to look at it that way. The timing, I 
don't think, has anything to do with it. This has been going on long 
before the Lewinsky affair and all other affairs. But President Clinton's 
future is not of prime concern to the american-Arab anti-discrimination 
committee. It fears now for the safety of Iraqi people, at home and 
in the U.S. We realize that seven years ago, there was a lot of backlash 
that happened to individuals in this country and we have to get ourselves 
up to expect the same things to happen all over again. Right now, 
this is what I'm picturing in Iraq -- there's a lot of children who 
are extremely horrified. And it's going to be a sad Christmas and 
a sad Ramadan for all of us. Ed Garsten, CNN, Dearborn, Michigan.
