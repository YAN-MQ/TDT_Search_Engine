The government is warning people to be very careful about buying items 
listed as being on sale. The federal trade commission says one of 
every 30 sale items listed scans the wrong price at checkout stands.

overcharged. The national retail federation says it's a remarkably 
low error rate, and retailers are taking steps to improve pricing 
accuracy.
