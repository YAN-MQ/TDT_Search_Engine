It's been another extraordinary day in the Middle East and here in 
washington, the attacks on Iraq. As you heard earlier, more than 50 
targets in the first wave, more than 250 cruise missiles. We do know 
precisely what's going on at the moment. Nobody will be surprised 
to hear there's attacks again tonight. Our time in the United States, 
which would be very early in the morning in iraq before the sunlight 
comes.
