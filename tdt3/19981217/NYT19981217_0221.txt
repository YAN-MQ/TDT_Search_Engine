NATIONAL FORECAST Moderate snow spread across parts of the Canadian 
province of Manitoba on Thursday ahead of a streaking low-pressure 
system diving southeast from Alberta into Saskatchewan. On Friday, 
this ``Alberta clipper'' will forge into the Great Lakes region, bringing 
a stripe of moderate snow to parts of northeast North Dakota, northern 
Minnesota and northern Michigan. Two to 5 inches of snow are possible. 
Accumulations could be locally heavy, mainly in northeast Minnesota, 
where easterly winds off Lake Superior inject additional moisture. 
Ultimately, snowfalls will be limited by the system's fast movement. 
The coldest arctic air mass of the season will forge southward into 
the northern Rockies and northern high Plains in the wake of the Alberta 
clipper, accompanied by snow showers and flurries. Steadier snows 
will develop along east-facing slopes of the mountains, where easterly 
winds rise up the sloping terrain. Meanwhile, arctic air will spill 
over the Rockies into Washington and Oregon, driven westward by a 
very strong high-pressure system over the Yukon. The central barometric 
pressure of the high will register more than 31.60 inches of mercury, 
setting the stage for arctic air to gradually spill westward over 
the Cascades toward the Pacific Northwest coast. The sluggish upper-level 
low that spawned thunderstorms over southern Arizona on Thursday will 
be dislodged and sent eastward into Texas, raising the chance of moderate 
rains, some with thunder. Rain will later move into Louisiana and 
parts of Arkansas. Focus: Death Valley Days At least two dozen times 
each year, Death Valley, Calif., is the hottest place in the nation. 
On Wednesday, it made that claim again as the mercury soared to 88 
degrees, establishing a new record for the day and the month. The 
long nights of early winter, nearly 14 hours, allow the desert air 
to lose much of the warmth it gains on a sunny December day. Death 
Valley typically takes a distant second to the hot spots around Los 
Angeles when the Santa Ana winds descend and heat the air at the coast. 
However, strong winds descending the nearby Spring Mountains added 
to the desert warmth.
