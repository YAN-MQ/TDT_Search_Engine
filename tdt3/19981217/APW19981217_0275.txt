A missile from the U.S.-British attack on Iraq Thursday fell on the 
city of Khorramshahr in southern Iran, damaging several houses, the 
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. No one was injured. 
The agency said the missile struck the center of Khorramshahr in southern 
Khuzestan province at 1:25 a.m. (2155 GMT). The bomb hit a barren 
piece of land in the Dorreh district in the center of the city, but 
the impact damaged homes within a 200 meter (660 foot) radius, the 
agency said. Hadi Ravanat, who lives in Khorramshahr, said all the 
windows in his house were shattered and nearby houses were partly 
damaged by the impact, IRNA reported. Khorramshahr, about 40 kilometers 
(25 kilometers) east of Basra in Iraq, is a large port city with major 
oil facilities. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which 
is headquartered in the Gulf state of Bahrain, refused to comment 
about the Iranian report, saying all comments would have to come from 
the Pentagon in Washington. The British charge d'affaires and the 
ambassador from Switzerland, whose embassy looks after U.S. interests 
in Iran, were summoned Thursday to the Foreign Ministry, where they 
received a protest over the stray missile, diplomats at both missions 
said. The missile blast spread panic in Khorramshahr, said 22-year-old 
Mehran Ahmadi. ``Everyone was out in the streets all night, and we 
didn't sleep a wink,'' she told The Associated Press by telephone. 
``It was really scary, and reminded me of the bombings during the 
war with Iraq,'' Ahmadi said. Iran fought a devastating 1980-88 war 
with Iraq. An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman warned Thursday that 
air strikes against Iraq would bring ``pain and misery'' to Iraq's 
people and urged Baghdad to cooperate with the United Nations. Relations 
between Iran and Iraq are still tense after their war, which killed 
or injured an estimated 1 million people. But Iran has always been 
against military strikes against Iraq.
