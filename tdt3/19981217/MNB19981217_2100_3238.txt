Brian, as if there wasn't enough going on today on Capitol Hill, all 
day long, the contrasts could not have been more Stark. Inside the 
Chambers, military involvement in Iraq. And outside, anti-impeachment 
forces saying the president should not be removed from office. All 
day long. It went like this. In Congress, a fierce political battle 
today. The president's defend errs rallying on the steps of the capitol. 
Republican leaders saying war or no war, it's time to begin final 
debate on impeachment. Democrats saying any talk of removing the president 
undermines the country during a time of crisis. Our sons and daughters 
are in harm's way while we are beginning a debate on whether or not 
to remove the president of the United States from office. That is 
wrong! That is wrong! It would be a grave mistake to go forward with 
this vote while our nation is engaged in military action. I cannot 
believe that we are even having this debate. But house leaders say 
they still have their jobs to do. No matter what our debates at home, 
we are as a nation prepared to lead the world. The president has decided 
to take this action that should have been taken any time over the 
last several years. One Judiciary committee member who served in the 
1991 Persian gulf war said under normal circumstances Mr. Clinton 
would be given the benefit of the doubt. The benefit gets removed 
in this case because of the diminished credibility and the self-inflicted 
wounds the president has caused himself. But Senate republican leader 
Trent Lott, who questioned the timing of the attack yesterday, softened 
that criticism today. I have been assured by administration officials 
that there is no relation between this decision and impeachment. I'm 
going to take their word for it. Brian, lawmakers are no longer debating 
when they're ing to vote on it. That's going to happen tomorrow. And 
they're no longer debating how it's going to turn out. They plan to 
impeach the president. But they plan to vote on this Saturday, and 
the debate begins tomorrow morning. Gwen Ifill works late for us on 
tonight.
