Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf accused the United 
States of ``shameless lying'' in their remarks on Iraq's stand with 
the U.N. weapons inspectors. Addressing the first government press 
conference since the U.S. attacks on Iraq began, al-Sahhaf said that 
in defending their strikes, London and Washington had failed to mention 
the report of the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
The IAEA had reported that Iraq had provided ``the necessary level 
of cooperation.'' The United States and Britian did not mention this 
``because they cannot benefit from it for their evil intentions,'' 
al-Sahhaf said. The foreign minister said the cruise missiles had 
inflicted ``heavy casualties'' in their impact on civilian areas of 
Baghdad. But he declined to give figures. The United States and Britain 
``lied to the world shamelessly, saying that the report of the executive 
chairman of (the U.N. Special Commission) showed that Iraq has not 
cooperated,'' al-Sahhaf said. But the U.N. inspectors had visited 
427 sites since Nov. 17, when inspections resumed after an earlier 
stand-off, he said. The Special Commission's report had cited five 
cases of alleged non-cooperation among these 427 inspections, the 
minister said. Taking issues with these five cases, al-Sahhaf said 
in one instance, the inspectors wanted to enter a ``small headquarters'' 
of the ruling Baath Party. ``What is the relation between the small 
headquarters of a political party and a disarmament mission?'' In 
another case, the inspectors tried to enter a former office of a security 
official, but this had been converted into a guest house. The inspectors 
were allowed to enter it after a delay. ``Do you deserve to be bombarded 
because you have delayed an inspection team 45 minutes?'' al-Sahhaf 
asked. Al-Sahhaf said the missiles had hit Iraq's military intelligence 
headquarters, its security police headquarters, and ``several industrial 
establishments - all of them under complete, ongoing monitoring (by 
the United Nations).'' Contrary to the U.S. claims of targeting Iraq's 
military and its weapons manufacturing infrastructure, the missiles 
had hit the house of President Saddah Hussein's daughter, Hala. ``Fortunately 
she and her relatives were not at that moment in her house,'' he said. 
The missiles exploded in ``heavily populated'' districts of Baghdad 
and one had hit a factory that produces brake oil for cars, he said. 
The minister said that instead of calling their campaign Operation 
Desert Fox, the allies should have named it ``Operation Villains in 
the Arabian Desert.'' The special commission is charged with overseeing 
the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and long-range 
missiles _ a process that Baghdad must complete before the United 
Nations will lift the sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait.
