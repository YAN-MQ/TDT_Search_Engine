With four consecutive defeats and almost every Barcelona fan against 
him, Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal heads into Sunday's game against Valladolid 
wondering if he'll still have a job on Monday. Among the first to 
be eliminated from the prestigious European Champion's League, Barcelona 
has fallen to 10th place in the 20-team Spanish first division, nine 
points behind leader Mallorca. But while club chairman Luis Nunez 
last week ruled out dismissing the 47-year-old Van Gaal before the 
season is over, the fans have run up the white flag. Last week's 3-1 
defeat to Villareal had fans waving handkerchiefs wildly in protest. 
The city's sports daily, El Mundo Deportivo, this week ran a survey 
showing 86 percent of fans opposed to Van Gaal remaining with the 
club and most favored the return of Dutch legend Johan Cruyff, who 
led Barcelona to its only European Champions Cup in 1992. Few coaches 
have plunged so low so fast as Van Gaal. He was welcomed with open 
arms before last season when he came from a title-filled career with 
Ajax of Amsterdam, and was excused for the side's early exit from 
the Champion's League last year when the team recovered to capture 
the Spanish league and King's Cup. But Barcelona is a demanding club 
and early anxiety surfaced last month when Barcelona was again eliminated 
from the Champion's League. The first-division slug exacerbated the 
matter. ``Van Gaal has not fulfilled any of the expectations he created,'' 
Spain's leading daily El Pais wrote Thursday. ``The club cannot become 
healthy again as long as it keeps Van Gaal.'' Unable to chuckle at 
Barcelona's woes is fellow Dutchman Guus Hiddink at Real Madrid, which 
has dropped to sixth and six trails Mallorca by six points. On Sunday, 
Madrid takes on a Oviedo, which lies just one point behind Real. Meanwhile, 
Mallorca will be looking to hold onto the leadership for a fifth consecutive 
week when it hosts lowly Racing Santander. Three points back of the 
leader is Celta Vigo, which takes its 25 points to face Real Sociedad 
on Sunday. Also with 25 points is Claudio Raineri's Valencia, which 
goes to a struggling Espanyol. In Saturday's only game, Deportivo 
La Coruna receives a resurgent Betis. Sunday's other 15th-round games 
are: Villareal vs. Athletic de Bilbao; Atletico de Madrid vs. Zaragoza; 
Alaves vs. Salamanca and Tenerife vs. Extremadura.
