BAGHDAD, Iraq _ U.S. missiles struck the Iraqi capital Thursday night 
in a second round of air strikes. At least a dozen explosions were 
heard in Baghdad, and a pall of smoke hung over the downtown. The 
attack came as U.S. officials were still assessing damage from the 
strike by hundreds of missiles in the early morning hours of Thursday. 
In Washington, officials at the Pentagon, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, said cruise missiles were fired deep into Iraq in the second 
attack and Navy strike aircraft fired laser-guided bombs along Iraq's 
borders. At the government's press office in downtown Baghdad, witnesses 
said one missile was seen flying over Thursday night. After the first 
explosion was heard at 9:57 p.m. (1857gmt), anti-aircraft fire came 
in response and tracer bullets darted into the night sky. The blasts 
grew increasingly louder as they came nearer the downtown. One missile 
appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the government's Military 
Industrial Corporation, from where smoke drifted into the sky. There 
was no immediate word on casualties from the Thursday night attack.
