By day, April is a mild-mannered accountant at J.C. Penney in a suburban 
mall. But three or four nights a week she becomes a party animal, 
driving into a seedy section of Tampa called Ybor City to hear a band 
at the Green Iguana or to plunk down $6 for ``sink or swim,'' the 
all-you-can-drink evening at the Edge, or to watch cross-dressers 
perform at the Pleasure Dome. ``There's nothing, really, that you 
can't do here,'' April said one recent Saturday night as thousands 
of drinkers and gawkers spilled in and out of 70 bars along a 10-block 
section of La Septima, or Seventh Avenue. ``You can sit down and be 
totally entertained,'' she said. ``I come here a lot.'' Which explains 
why April did not want her last name published and why, after years 
of failed urban redevelopment, Ybor City is attracting millions of 
dollars from investors. A 20-screen movie complex, retail shops, a 
hotel, homes and chain restaurants have queued up behind the long 
lines of X-generation club goers who wait until 3 a.m. to get on techno 
dance floors fashioned in brick buildings left over from Ybor City's 
heyday as a cigar-manufacturing area. ``We went on a Friday night 
and there were 20,000 people _ you could feel the energy,'' said Jay 
Miller, executive vice president of Steiner &AMP; Associates of Miami, 
which will begin construction in January on a $50 million retail-movie 
project on Seventh Avenue. In the wake of the crowds, the City of 
Tampa is erecting a $12 million parking garage, lending $9 million 
to Steiner to lower its retail rents and building a two-mile, $23 
million streetcar line to connect downtown Tampa to Ybor City. Private 
developers are adding another $50 million in new construction. The 
revival of Ybor (pronounced E-bore), which is named after Vincent-Martinez 
Ybor, a cigar baron who built a company town of 10,000 immigrants 
here in 1886, is based largely on liquor, city officials say. A decade 
ago, frustrated by the area's slide, the Tampa City Council removed 
zoning fees and rules, created tax credits and made the old business 
district a ``wet zone,'' allowing a high number of bars. There was 
no master plan, but when a struggling cafe called Carmine's tried 
staying open at night with a band and a bar, college students poured 
in. Since 1990, 150 new businesses employing 1,500 people have renovated 
800,000 square feet of buildings, and club owners have invested $50 
million of their own money, said Jack Rodriguez, who runs the Ybor 
City Development Corp.. While nearly 40 percent is office space, it 
is the zany mix of Mediterranean bistros, Cuban sandwich shops, dance 
clubs, cigar stores and tattoo parlors that has made Ybor City the 
nighttime playground for a 100-mile zone stretching from St. Petersburg 
to Orlando. On Friday and Saturday nights, the police block cars from 
La Septima, allowing people to stroll beneath bright lights and security 
cameras. Ybor City's success is striking when compared with Tampa's 
$200 million, 20-year effort to create life in its downtown and waterfront 
with publicly subsidized projects ranging from a convention center 
to an aquarium. Developers say 3 million people a year drive downtown 
to events like hockey games. But, blocked by freeways and huge structures, 
nobody stays to walk around, said John J. Twomey III of the Hogan 
Group, which hopes to change that with a $37 million ``retail entertainment'' 
zone 1.5 miles from Ybor City. As 1.5 million revelers stroll through 
the downtown every year, they sense the culture and the human scale, 
said Del Acosta, who administers the Barrio Latino Commission, an 
architectural review board. ``The ability to promenade 10 blocks, 
to see and be seen _ that's Main Street U.S.A.,'' he said. Yes, there 
are problems with too many rowdy youths, skyrocketing rents, rising 
crime and lost historical detail. But Ybor City remains real entertainment, 
he said. ``I was having lunch at the Atomic Age Cafe yesterday,'' 
Acosta said. ``In walked a very wealthy bank executive, a couple of 
kids with green hair and a guy looking for his next meal. You don't 
get that in a mall.''
