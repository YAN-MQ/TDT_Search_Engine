Head lice are a growing problem for many parents and school systems 
around the country. It can spread easily from one child to another. 
But the national pediculosis association says the problem is reaching 
epidemic proportions. It says some lice are developing a resistance 
to the leading over-the-counter treatment for louse infestation. Lice 
lay tiny eggs called nits, usually near the scalp. They can also infest 
pillows, mattresses and other furniture. Here are some tips on getting 
rid of the pests -- use a lice-killing shampoo. It won't kill all 
the bugs, but it's a good way to start. Next, use a metal comb to 
remove lice and nits. They're easier to spot in sunlight or under 
a bright lamp. Be sure to wash sheets and towels daily. And vacuum 
carpets and rugs often. Even after you think the bugs are gone, keep 
checking. Any nits you may have missed could Hatch within seven to 
ten days. Then you'll have to start the whole process over again.

the pesky critters. And for all the latest health news online, go
