This 1,000-year-old city is losing its inferiority complex. A few 
years ago Limerick, with 52,000 people the third-largest Irish city, 
was widely known in the rest of the country as ``stab city,'' a bad 
place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live there, either. But the 
city has changed for the better as Ireland's economy has boomed. The 
upsurge would have pleased Limerick's Viking founders, to say nothing 
of Frank McCourt, a native whose best-selling book, ``Angela's Ashes,'' 
describing the bad old days of 50 years ago, has made him a rich man 
and the city's most famous former resident. Unemployment here is at 
the national average of 8.5 percent, but there are no jobless pockets 
of 80 percent or 90 percent, as there are in the two larger cities 
_ Dublin, the capital, and Cork. More factories are now opening than 
closing in the area. Nearby Shannon Airport provides 500 year-round 
jobs. People are proud of the airport, where the hot mix of whiskey 
and coffee was invented as Irish coffee in 1949, two years after the 
opening of the first duty-free shop in the world. New jobs arrive 
regularly, many of them at branches of U.S. and European electronic 
technology factories locating in the area. And Limerick now ranks 
only fifth or sixth in urban street crime. ```Stab city' was a legend, 
based on an old family feud involving rugby,'' said Ciaran MacGonial, 
director of the new Hunt Museum of art. ``There is a new self-confidence, 
a new dynamic.'' The environment is relatively free of pollution. 
People fish for pike in the wind-scalloped River Shannon from the 
Sarsfield Bridge in the middle of the city. The number of painters 
and sculptors _ about 140 _ is rising, producing outdoor statues and 
indoor exhibitions. The City Museum of Art has studded the city with 
art in a current festival. And there is always the local propensity 
to claim Limerick as the birthplace of the verse form, one more tourist 
attraction. People here talk less about the Celtic Tiger, as the boom 
is called in Dublin, and more about how they pulled themselves up 
with the help of the aggressive government-subsidized body Shannon 
Development and with money from the European Union. ``It's booming,'' 
said Frank Prendergast, a historian and former mayor, who delights 
in anecdotes about the city and its people. Limerick, he said, was 
chartered as a city in 1197, before even London and about the time 
Robin Hood was working Sherwood Forest. Viking traces are everywhere, 
he said, not only in ancient dishes and coins in museums, but in the 
names of current residents, like MacOlaf and Doyle. ``Doyle,'' he 
said, derives from the Gaelic words describing ``dark-haired foreigners,'' 
probably Danes. Still, there are problems, like the closing of the 
Krups kitchen-appliance factory, which will kill 500 jobs in the next 
few months. Outside the Krups plant the other day, workers whose jobs 
are to end were grim, but did not seem desperate. The French parent 
company, Moulinex, is moving production of electric kettles and food 
processors back home, partly because of the collapse of markets in 
Eastern Europe and Russia. ``They called us in one morning without 
warning and just told us we had no more jobs,'' said Doreen Rooney, 
a packer who has worked at Krups for 24 years. ``There are husbands 
and wives working here,'' she added, ``so they have to find two more 
jobs.'' Her friend Jacinta Stoica, who assembles food choppers, said 
that despite the problem her family would have a normal Christmas. 
But there is more evidence of prosperity than of decline. In recent 
weeks, the makers of a movie based on ``Angela's Ashes'' could not 
find streets decrepit enough to portray McCourt's Limerick. So they 
went to Cork and filmed some slum streets. This meant, to some people 
here, that McCourt had overdrawn the hardship of his youth. He wrote 
that the Shannon used to flood his house, but that seems unlikely, 
residents say, as the river is too far away from where he lived off 
O'Connell Street. But most people feel the absence of filmable slums 
is a reflection of how the city has improved. Tours of McCourt's remembered 
places now attract American visitors, who regularly steal the metal 
plaques identifying them. The verse limerick was recently promoted, 
as a tourist attraction, with the first international limerick contest. 
Each entry had to begin ``In Limerick where once I did stay.'' The 
winner among 1,500 entries, by Marian Gormley, of Drogheda, County 
Louth, started that way and ended with a McCourt reference, ``From 
`Ashes' they've come a long way.'' Shannon Development officials, 
who sponsored the contest, produced research purporting to prove that 
Limerick was really the birthplace of the limerick, that Gaelic-speaking 
poets learned the form in France in the 16th century and came here 
to develop it in pubs. They brushed off the statements in reference 
books that the origin of the form is unknown and that it first appeared 
in print in England in 1820. Maeve Kelly, the author of two novels, 
who was chief judge, said in an interview: ``It doesn't matter whether 
it originated in Limerick. It was popularized here.''
