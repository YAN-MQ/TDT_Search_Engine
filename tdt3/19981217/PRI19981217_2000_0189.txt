Top Pentagon officials say the air strikes on Iraq have done extensive 
damage. Defense Secretary William Cohen said damage assessments from 
the first round of attacks showed damage to Iraq's anti-aircraft facilities, 
airbases, and the barracks of President Saddam Hussein's Republican 
Guards. He said there have been no America casualties so far. Army 
General Henry Shelton said US force launched more than 200 Navy tomahawk 
missiles in the first round aiming at more than 50 targets. He displayed 
in large photographs of two of the targets: Iraq's military intelligence 
headquarters and the offices and barracks of the Republican Guards. 
The pictures taken from the air showed rubble where the buildings 
once stood.
