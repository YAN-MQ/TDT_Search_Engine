The world's eyes remain focused on Iraq following the U.S. and British 
military strike. I'm I'm Myron Kandel in New York and this is "Dollars 
& Sense." Investors are closely watching developments in the gulf. 
Oil priced spiked up before the attack. But the markets' reaction 
after the bombing has been decidedly muted. Oil has been hovering 
around record lows recently so any Spike in prices is expected to 
be temporary. Traders say a disruption in Iraqi oil would have only 
a minor impact on prices. I would expect that they would steer clear 
of the oil installations. They're fundamental to the oil for food 
process. In fact, this morning, oil is flowing both from the north 
at chahan and the south. Tankers are loading in both areas so Iraqi 
export crew is still there and the supervisors are still there. Iraq 
is currently allowed to export 1.8 million barrels of oil a day. Under 
United Nations humanitarian deal.
