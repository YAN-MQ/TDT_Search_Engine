Average economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean dropped 
to 2.3 percent in 1998 from 5.2 percent a year earlier, due mainly 
to the Asian financial turmoil and adverse weather conditions, a U.N. 
agency reported Thursday. And growth will further slow down to only 
1 percent in 1999, the Santiago-based Economic Commission for Latin 
America and the Caribbean (ECCLA) said in its annual report on the 
regional economies. Still, given the difficult conditions, the results 
for this year should be considered reasonable, ECCLA said. It noted 
regional growth was above the world rate of 2 percent. The picture 
looks better in the inflation front, with a regional rate of 10.2 
percent this year, similar to that of 1997. Some countries were badly 
affected by the steep drop of international prices for products such 
as oil and copper, which caused losses estimated at dlrs 10 billion 
to the region. Chile, the world's largest copper exporter, and Venezuela, 
a major oil exporter, were especially hit. The region as a whole succeeded 
in curbing pressures on employment, ECCLA said. Average regional unemployment 
grew only to 7.9 percent from 7.3 percent the previous year. The economic 
difficulties were mainly the result of the Asian financial crisis 
and adverse weather conditions, such as El Nino phenomenon and hurricanes 
George and Mitch, that caused massive destruction in the Caribbean 
and Central America. El Nino, a cyclical warming of the water in the 
Pacific Ocean, triggered weather changes this year that caused damages 
estimated at billions of dollars, especially in Ecuador, Peru and 
Chile where it seriously affected fishing activities. Mexico and Bolivia 
led the individual economic growth rates in the region with 4.5 percent, 
followed by Argentina and Chile with 4 percent. ECCLA's executive 
secretary Jose Ocampo said recovery in the region will only begin 
in the second half of 1999. ``But the continued slowdown in Brazil 
and elsewhere this year will keep growth at around 1 percent'' next 
year, the Colombian economist said. He also warned the regional situation 
will continue to depend greatly ``on the programs to reactivate economies 
around the world.'' ``We will depend on industrialized economies registering 
an expansion and on the situation in Brazil,'' he added.
