Woe is the actor's life: judgment, rejection, humiliation. No wonder 
Lena is angry. She is angry at the people who assess her at auditions. 
She is angry at Jorge (David Zayas), the neglectful agent who hasn't 
bothered to check on her three call backs as a candidate to star on 
Broadway opposite Andy Garcia in ``Castro.'' And she is angry at her 
boyfriend, Mike (Gary Perez), who is in the midst of giving up his 
own acting ambitions to take a steady job, so they can get married 
and have children, a decent apartment and health insurance. Most of 
all, Lena is angry at herself. Ten years after beginning her career 
and five years _ or is it seven? _ after vowing at 25 to quit if she 
didn't achieve success by 30, Lena is seething with rage as she faces 
another birthday. Played by Marlene Forte, this Cuban-American actress 
is the passionate centerpiece of ``Lena's Dreams,'' which opens Friday 
at Anthology Film Archives. Anyone who has ever struggled to achieve 
success as an actor in New York is likely to identify with Lena and 
her friends, who study, accept unremunerative roles in workshop productions 
and get rare roles only to be ignored or slighted by some undistinguished 
critic, should the play even merit a review. And in the meantime, 
they wait on tables and live on little money and lots of hope. Along 
the way, some make compromises or drop out. Mike's friend Johnny (Jeremiah 
Birkett) is happy with the occasional commercial, and Lena's pal Suze 
(Susan Peirez), Johnny's former girlfriend, has opted for law school, 
marriage to a wealthy lawyer and a big house in the suburbs, all to 
her regret. Written and directed by Heather Johnston and Gordon Eriksen, 
``Lena's Dreams'' is not a film of many surprises but one of well-observed 
truths. Focused primarily on Lena and at its liveliest in her volcanic 
eruptions, ``Lena's Dreams'' maintains a gritty sense of the reality 
of its characters' lives while keeping the romance of show business 
alive in its heart. Camaraderie, friendship and love, it suggests, 
are the true rewards. Struggle is to be cherished, and success _ as 
indicated by the loneliness and alcoholism in the life of Angela (Kai 
Adwoa), an acting teacher who achieves stardom at 40 _ may be a false 
goddess. ``Acting is a miserable profession,'' Angela says. ``If you 
can do something else and be happy, do it.'' What ``Lena's Dream'' 
makes clear in its forthright, unadorned way is that for some people, 
there is no happiness in doing anything else.
