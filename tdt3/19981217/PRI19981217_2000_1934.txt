Russia has recalled its ambassador to Washington in protest against 
the airstrikes. State Department Spokesman James Rubin describes the 
decisions as "unfortunate", but said it is not a surprise. Earlier, 
President Yelstin demanded an end to the military action. And the 
Russian Prime Minister Yenveny Primakov delivered a similar message 
during a phone call to Vice President Al Gore.
