"CNN Headline News," I'm Chuck Roberts. Good afternoon. We are live 
in Atlanta. Day two of "operation desert fox" is underway and bombs 
have been falling in Baghdad and throughout Iraq. It's quiet now. 
Until about 20 minutes ago and as early as two hours ago the bombs 
were falling in and around Baghdad and throughout Iraq. Reports say 
this bombardment is more thunderous and explosive than yesterday. 
Again today, anti-aircraft fire blazed in the sky over Baghdad as 
sirens wailed. Explosions were seen and heard in the distance. At 
one point, much of the central city was enveloped in white smoke. 
The campaign began 24 hours ago with the launch of 200 tomahawk cruise 
missiles against military and security targets throughout Iraq. U.S. 
commanders say some of the strikes were right on target, while some 
others were "not as successful." So far, no U.S. or British casualties 
are reported. There are no reliable accounts of deaths on the Iraqi 
side, though earlier, officials said two people had been killed.
