Scott Boras, the agent who negotiated Kevin Brown's record-setting 
$105 million deal, said any system that revealed the nature of contending 
offers would constitute collusion. Responding to comments made by 
the Padres' president, Larry Lucchino, Boras said such a suggestion 
is merely a reflection of ``sour grapes.'' Brown signed with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, turning down overtures from the St. Louis Cardinals, 
the Colorado Rockies, the Baltimore Orioles and the Padres. In the 
aftermath of the agreement, Lucchino called others involved in the 
negotiations and asked rival executives about the offers they had 
made to the pitcher. Lucchino suggested Tuesday that Boras was responsible 
for ``misinformation'' during the negotiations, and that as a result, 
the Dodgers, who are owned by the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, paid 
perhaps $35 million to $40 million more than the next highest offer. 
Lucchino also suggested that baseball owners would discuss a method 
by which contending offers could be confirmed _ either through an 
independent verifier, announcements to the news media or a requirement 
that all offers be made in writing. ``I'm talking about the objective 
facts about the negotiations,'' Lucchino said, ``and whether there 
are flaws in the structure of the process that allows for blindman's 
bluff.'' Speaking in a phone interview late Wednesday, Boras attributed 
Lucchino's concern to the fact the Padres lost Brown, a top pitcher, 
to another team that plays in the same division. ``To suggest that 
the Dodgers and Murdoch lack market savvy is like saying Whitney Houston 
is tone-deaf,'' Boras said. ``It's a very arrogant and transparent 
position to suggest that the Dodgers, Murdoch and Fox are a willing 
market patsy.'' Fox is the company owned by Murdoch. Boras continued: 
``As to my credibility, Lucchino sought my counsel before the Padres 
traded for Kevin Brown, and throughout the summer he invited me to 
watch games with him throughout the summer. All of a sudden my history 
with Larry Lucchino is in question, and the only reason it is in question 
is because Kevin Brown is now a Dodger.'' Boras said he was not surprised 
that Lucchino would propose a way for all teams to report their offers, 
and have a mechanism through which offers could be verified. ``But 
he should revert to his baseball history; that was tried under Peter 
Ueberroth's administration,'' he said, referring to the former baseball 
commissioner. ``The clubs did report their offers to central baseball, 
and it's called collusion, and they had to pay $380 million in damages 
to the players as a result. The suggestion of such an event is merely 
a return to activities that are prohibited in the collective bargaining 
agreement. ``There is absolutely no reason for collaborative elements 
on this with the players association. This is representing a player, 
and you cannot collaborate in negotiation, because it affects the 
rights of the player.'' Boras also represents Bernie Williams, the 
center fielder who recently re-signed with the Yankees for a seven-year, 
$87.5 million contract. During negotiations, Boras indicated that 
he had contending offers of seven and eight years length, and at the 
time, George Steinbrenner, the Yankees owner, stated flatly that he 
did not believe Boras. After Williams agreed to terms, the Yankees 
learned that the Boston Red Sox had made a seven-year, $91.5 million 
offer, and the Arizona Diamondbacks made an eight-year, $100 million 
offer. In the aftermath of the Brown negotiations, the Los Angeles 
General Manager Kevin Malone said he was entirely satisfied that Boras 
negotiated in good faith. ``If we hadn't given him that contract,'' 
Malone said, ``I'm sure that someone else would have.''
