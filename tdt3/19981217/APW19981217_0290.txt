Sporadic heavy weapons fire boomed through the suburbs south of Brazzaville 
early Thursday morning as the army battled an outlawed militia group. 
``We're taking control of the situation,'' said Lt. Jaques Otalet 
of the Republic of Congo army. ``We have asked the civilian population 
to leave the area to permit authorities to proceed with the mopping-up 
operations.'' The shooting began Wednesday night and continued, off 
and on, into early Thursday when the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of 
former Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas, who had launched scattered 
ambushes, were pushed back, he said. There were no details on casualties 
and Otelet's version of events could not be independently confirmed. 
The government has been battling the Ninjas in the Pool region south 
of Brazzaville for the past few months, though the intensity of the 
fighting has picked up in recent weeks. Pool is Kolelas' home region. 
Thousands of refugees have fled to neighboring Congo because of the 
fighting, according to aid workers there. The Kinshasa newspaper Palmares 
estimated that 10,000 refugees have crossed the river border from 
Republic of Congo to Congo _ the former Zaire. Kolelas and his sometime-ally, 
ousted president Pascal Lissouba, fled Republic of Congo after President 
Denis Sassou-Nguesso and his ``Cobra'' militia _ with the help of 
Angolan government troops _ defeated Lissouba in a five-month civil 
war last year. Since then, the Ninjas have resisted disarmament and 
are waging a campaign against Sassou-Nguesso's government. Since his 
takeover, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia groups including 
the Cobras. Angola turned the tide in Republic of Congo's civil war, 
coming in to help Sassou-Nguesso and helping him defeat Lissouba. 
Many Angolan soldiers stayed in Republic of Congo after the war ended. 
Angola entered last year's civil war because Lissouba was believed 
to be sending aid to the rebel group UNITA a Portuguese acronym for 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola which has 
been fighting the The Republic of Congo government has said that UNITA 
is now supporting the Ninjas. (lo-ad-tjs)
