This is "CNN Headline News." I'm Sean Callebs. It is the biggest attack 
on Iraq since the gulf war. The United States and British forces fired 
more than 200 cruise missiles on iraq in "operation desert fox." Sources 
say cruise missiles were fired from ships and fighter bombers targeting 
Iraqi military and security installations. Damage reports are now 
coming in from the first wave of the air strike. Doctors at a Baghdad 
hospital say at least two people were killed, 30 more injured. The 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff called it a comprehensive operation. 
Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from U.S. Navy ships at sea and 
United States air force B-52s. We're also in the process of deploying 
additional U.S. military forces to southwest Asia, to the U.S. central 
command area of operation to bolster our already substantial military 
presence in the gulf region.
