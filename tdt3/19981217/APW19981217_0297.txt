Police dispersed hundreds of miners, who blocked a national highway 
and railway lines in protest of falling living standards and possible 
job cuts, a police spokesman said Thursday. Some 200 gold and zinc 
miners sat down across a central Romanian highway and railway track 
Wednesday, after the state electricity company cut power to four mines, 
affecting 5,000 miners. Dozens of trains were delayed, canceled or 
rerouted due to the miners' protest. Pre-dawn Thursday, 200 policemen 
moved in to break up the demonstration in Sandominic, a small town 
225 kilometers (140 miles) north Bucharest. The miners did not resist 
as they were ``hungry, tired and frozen,'' said Maj. Gheorghe Tudor 
by telephone. According to the state electricity company, the mines 
have arrears of up to 156 billion lei (dlrs 1.5 million). The miners 
are demanding the government reconnect their power and guarantees 
their jobs. Their demands will be discussed by the government later. 
Last December, the government said unprofitable mines will be closed 
over the coming months and tens of thousands of mainly coal miners 
were laid off. Miners in Romania are seen as an uncontrollable force. 
Twice in the past decade, they rampaged through the capital, forcing 
a prime minister to resign and killing civilians _ the state counts 
only six victims, but citizens say the numbers are as high as 60. 
The miners have said they want to protest in Bucharest at the weekend, 
but it is unsure whether they will get municipal and police approval 
needed to stage a demonstration.
