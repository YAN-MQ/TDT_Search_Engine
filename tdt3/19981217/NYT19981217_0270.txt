Stung by a government witness' testimony that Microsoft Corp. had 
sabotaged a program designed to gather evidence against the company, 
lawyers for the software giant Thursday offered the court an unusual 
written explanation. Central to the issue are online updates, a feature 
introduced with Windows 98 in June, whereby users who are connected 
to the Internet receive a ``critical update'' message when they turn 
on their computers whenever Microsoft has fixed some bug or made some 
improvement to the operating system. By clicking on a button, the 
user downloads the new code from a special Web site, and it is instantly 
installed automatically. On Monday, the witness, Edward Felten, a 
computer-scientist from Princeton University, testified that Microsoft 
had made changes to its Windows 98 update site that seemed designed 
to thwart a computer program he had written to demonstrate a central 
point in the government's antitrust suit against the company _ that 
Microsoft's browser could be removed from Windows. Felten testified 
that soon after he gave Microsoft a copy of his program in September 
as part of the pre-trial discovery rules, his computer would no longer 
work with the update site. ``Microsoft modified some of the software 
that they distribute as part of the Windows update feature in a way 
that made it incompatible,'' he said. He added that his computer, 
though running a competing Web browser, had worked perfectly on the 
site until Dec. 4. On Wednesday, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson gave 
Microsoft permission to offer an explanation for the changes. In its 
filing Thursday, Microsoft did not explain what had caused the problem 
but denied doing anything that would have caused it. The company said 
that the site was updated regularly, roughly every two weeks, adding 
that an update was first posted on Nov. 4 and modified slightly on 
Dec. 4 ``by a single developer working under the supervision of another 
developer.'' ``Neither of these developers,'' the company said, ``had 
access to Dr. Felten's program, and neither was involved in any way 
in Microsoft's testing of his program. The Dec. 4 change had nothing 
whatsoever to do with Dr. Felten or his program. Microsoft knows of 
no reason why that change should have affected Dr. Felten's program 
and believes it had no such effect.'' In fact, Microsoft argues that 
Felten's removal program changes Windows in such a way that the program 
cannot work with the update site at all. Felten said he would not 
comment on Microsoft's submission.
