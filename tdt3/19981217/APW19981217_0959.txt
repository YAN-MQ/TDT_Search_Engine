Thousands of people rallied in central Grozny on Thursday in support 
of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who has promised to clamp down 
on crime in the breakaway republic. The gathering adopted a resolution 
that called for broader powers for Maskhadov, and urged him to crack 
down on rebel warlords and suspected kidnappers. Protesters shouted 
for an end to the crime wave. Maskhadov imposed a one-month state 
of emergency Tuesday to try to end rampant crime and kidnappings in 
Chechnya. He called for people to turn out at the rally Thursday to 
support his decision. The Chechen Security Ministry claimed 50,000 
people attended the rally. After it ended, opposition groups staged 
a smaller gathering to urge Maskhadov's ouster, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency reported. Hundreds of people have been taken hostage in Chechnya 
since the end of a 1994-96 war with Russia. In an unusually gruesome 
display of lawlessness, four Western captives were beheaded last week. 
The hostages _ three Britons and a New Zealander _ had been in Chechnya 
to install a cellular phone system. They were kidnapped Oct. 3 and 
their heads were found after a rescue attempt apparently went wrong. 
Maskhadov blamed the leader of a prominent group of Chechen Islamic 
militants for the attack and for many other kidnappings that have 
hit the region. The group, the Islamic Jamaats or Warriors of Islam, 
has denied any connection with the killings, and threatened to launch 
attacks on Russia if authorities clamp down on their operations, ITAR-Tass 
reported Thursday. In a statement on Chechen television Wednesday 
night, group leaders threatened to attack Russian sites outside Chechnya 
if Maskhadov tries to fight them. The group does not want to fight 
within Chechnya because it refuses to ``spill the blood of Muslim 
brothers'' or play into the hands of Russia's secret services and 
enemies of Chechen independence, ITAR-Tass said, citing remarks made 
during the address. The group is holed up in Chechnya's second largest 
city, Urus-Martan. Fighters led by warlord Arbi Barayev have dug trenches 
around the town and say they are ready for war. The resolution adopted 
at the rally in Grozny specifically called for Maskhadov to disperse 
the armed groups in Urus-Martan and bring the city under government 
control, Interfax said. Maskhadov won Chechnya's presidential elections 
almost two years ago by an overwhelming margin, and still retains 
widespread support among many Chechens despite his failure to restore 
stability in the region.
