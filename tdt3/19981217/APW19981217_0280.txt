The United States on Thursday closed all its African embassies, except 
for the missions in Nigeria and South Africa, as a precaution following 
the U.S. airstrikes on Iraq. Offices of the Peace Corps, U.S. Information 
Service and U.S. AID and consulates also were ordered closed, said 
Bruce Wharton, an embassy spokesman here. After the deadly U.S. embassy 
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania last August, ``I'm sure people just 
didn't want to take chances in Africa,'' he said. The offices will 
stay closed Friday, and reopen Monday. Americans traveling Thursday 
through Sunday who needed to pick up passports would be allowed in 
to the consulate in Johannesburg, which is being run by a skeleton 
staff, he said. The embassy blasts killed 224 people, including 12 
Americans, and wounded thousands of others.
