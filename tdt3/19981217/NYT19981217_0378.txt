Clifford Alexander, secretary of the Army under President Jimmy Carter 
``We all have our egos and are driven by self-interest, but Bill Clinton 
takes the cake. For someone who holds himself out as concerned so 
deeply about his country, he does us all a great disservice by concentrating 
only on what is happening to him at this point. A lot of people who 
might otherwise be inclined to cut him some slack end up angry at 
him instead. ``This bombing of Iraq at a crucial juncture in the impeachment 
process _ is this a needed, genuine military move or a self-serving 
Bill Clinton political ploy? You have to wonder. ``In his six years 
in the White House, he has failed to do the really hard work of governing, 
the reaching out and forging relationships part, especially creating 
strong ties with the legislative branch. So now, when he stands accused 
of perjury and other very serious misdeeds and needs all the help 
he can get on Capitol Hill, that failure to do what presidents must 
do is coming back to haunt him. ... ``I'd like to have sympathy for 
this president. But I can't. We are now in a constitutional and legal 
process that must be allowed to unwind to its logical conclusion, 
Iraq or no Iraq.'' Robert M. Franklin, president, Interdenominational 
Theological Center, Atlanta: ``It is appropriate for Congress to engage 
in this act of moral accountability. I regard the impeachment process 
as an exercise of moral accountability. ... ``However, the American 
people through the polls have also indicated the desire to extend 
forgiveness and mercy to this particular president. Consequently, 
the impeachment hearings, in view of that expression, represent too 
much too late. ``The president ought to consider a gesture of self-censure, 
where he goes away for a couple of weeks to engage in a time of moral 
reflection and repair, prayer and study. And Mr. Clinton needs to 
prepare an essay on the state of his own soul, his own personal journey, 
from bondage toward deliverance. And that essay could become the occasion 
of a national conversation on the state of private and public morality. 
``That would be a more redemptive exercise than the mere impeachment 
and tarnishing and stigmatizing of a leader. ... ``The bombing of 
Iraq? I just find it extraordinary irony that on the eve of Ramadan, 
Christmas, Hanukkah _ God's graciousness to humanity _ bloodshed abounds.'' 
Peter D. Kramer, author and psychiatrist ``There are times when I 
want to see the guy run out of town _ just recently, when his lawyers 
testified that he misled but did not lie. ... ``On the other hand, 
the conservatives are unspeakable. Compare Clinton's lies about sex 
to Nixon's about subverting the electoral process? ``We will despise 
ourself as a country if we impeach a president over largely private 
matters. ``Not in the middle of a war, of course, but sometime soon, 
when the pendulum has swung his way _ when he is momentarily off the 
hook _ I would love to see Clinton grasp an opportunity to resign, 
say, 'I did wrong, and now there's nothing I can do politically that 
Gore can't do better.' ``Clinton has said resignation would be out 
of character. But that's why it would be admirable. ``So far he seems 
not to have struggled to transcend his character.'' Geoffrey Canada, 
president, Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, New York ``The 
lie the president told about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky 
is not at the level of high crimes that the Framers of our Constitution 
put in for impeachment. In our society, there are very few men, placed 
in a similar predicament who would not have done the same thing _ 
try to cloud the issue or lie. He did something that is very human. 
... ``And as for the bombing of Iraq at this time, a lot of presidents 
have taken action on an international crisis to deflect attention 
from problems at home. It's not particularly relevant here, won't 
make me change my view. ``The reason African-Americans support the 
president is that they understand there is a difference between the 
letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Too many times the letter 
of the law has been used against African-Americans, pushing the law 
to the full extent possible without flexibility. And too many times, 
for whites, it has been the spirit of the law, law applied leniently. 
``A lot of African-Americans worry that this president is a target 
because he is so friendly with African-Americans. They think it is 
payback.''
