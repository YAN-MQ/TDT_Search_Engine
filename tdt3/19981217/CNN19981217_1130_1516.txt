If you've walked around busy city streets, you've seen them -- or 
have maybe been almost hit by them. Bicycle messengers are considered 
a rebellious group. Now they want to get organized. Don Knapp reports. 
Mavericks, renegades, punks on bikes -- bicycle messengers have been 
called that and a lot worse by motorists and pedestrians who compete 
with them on San Francisco streets. But they do deliver the goods. 
Court documents, engineering blueprints, bulky packages, videotape, 
usually in just minutes, door to door. I'll be the first to admit 
it. We have to run lights and do things in traffic that may not seem 
that wise to the casual observer. It's tough work getting over or 
around San Francisco's hills. And dangerous. It's pretty hectic sometimes. 
When it rains, it's even worse. Bike messengers compare their rate 
of death and injury to that of police officers. That's one of the 
reasons messengers want a union. I think we need a union just for 
health reasons, like dental, stuff like that. If we get injured, you 
know, they can take care of our injuries. I'm over at 907 Harrison, 
universal service administration. Some of the 50 or so shops already 
provide benefits and say unionizing would put them out of business. 
It's just a temporary thing for a lot of people. Nobody really wants 
to make this their career. And the ones who have made it a career 
do make a decent living at it. Joel Metz has been a bike messenger 
for five years. He's been hit twice and has long scars on both elbows. 
He pedals about 50 to 80 miles a day and on average, earns less than 
$300 a Week. It's high time the rates went up. They've been like this 
for 10, 15 years, what the rates are now. The messengers found support 
with the international longshore and warehouse union. The delivery 
of all kinds of goods and services would grind to a halt without these 
messengers, just as without our longshoremen in the 30s, the port 
of San Francisco ground to a halt. So we see a lot of parallels in 
the sort of maverick, rebellious character of these messengers. Next 
step for the organizers, convince fellow maverick, rebellious bicyclists 
that they ought to be carrying union cards. Don Knapp, CNN, San Francisco.
