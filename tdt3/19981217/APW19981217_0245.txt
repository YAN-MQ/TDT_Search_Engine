Unemployment edged up to 5.5 percent for the three months ended Nov. 
30, the highest level since the government began keeping records in 
1981. The Census and Statistics Department said 191,000 people, or 
5.2 percent of the workforce, were out of work in the September-November 
period, compared with 188,700 in August-October. Joseph Wong, the 
secretary for education and manpower, warned that unemployment will 
rise further as the recession-mired economy continues to shrink. The 
economy shrank by 7 percent in the third quarter and is expected to 
contract by 5 percent for all of 1998. Economists predict the economy 
will not rebound until the second half of next year. ``Hong Kong is 
undergoing a major economic adjustment brought on largely by repercussions 
of the regional financial turmoil,'' Wong said. ``Unemployment will 
remain on the high side for some time as a result of corporate downsizing 
and layoffs during this process.'' Unionists warn more people would 
be thrown out of work ahead of the Chinese New Year in February, when 
most companies review their operations and lay off unneeded staff 
after giving them a year-end bonus and a traditional thanks for the 
year's service. Many companies, including some of Hong Kong's largest 
employers, have announced pay cuts of up to 20 percent and salary 
freezes to cut costs. Tang Kwong-yiu, the government economist, said 
at a news conference the latest figures reflected higher unemployment 
in decoration and maintenance, manufacturing, business services and 
import and export sectors. There were also substantial layoffs in 
the construction sector as many private property projects have slowed 
down. The territory's property values have fallen by as much as 50 
percent since their peak last year. Property prices have rebounded 
slightly in recent weeks as stock prices and interest rates stabilize. 
Although Hong Kong's unemployment is low compared with some countries, 
people in the territory had been used to years of healthy economic 
growth. The government said earlier it is facing a 13 billion Hong 
Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 1.67 billion) welfare bill this year, a fivefold 
increase in as many years. Hoping to keep a lid on rising welfare 
costs, the government recently announced controversial proposals to 
cut welfare payments by up to 20 percent and encourage recipients 
to perform volunteer work as a condition of receiving assistance.
