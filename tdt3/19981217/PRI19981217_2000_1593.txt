A look at how the markets have responded to the air strikes. On Wall 
Street today, the Dow Jones Industrials closed up 85 points to 8876. 
The Nasdaq also ended on the upside, finishing at 2044. That is up 
35 points. All of which indicates that the missile strikes against 
Iraq have failed to stop the stock market rallies. The World's Liz 
George reports from our business desk in New York. Wall Street stocks 
rallied in early trading with the Dow Jones jumping 80 points on opening 
before it eased slightly. It seems traders have shrugged off fears 
of a long drawn out conflict in Iraq. Even oil prices have fallen 
today, following a sharp spike yesterday, as the market question whether 
the air strikes would effect Iraq for food exports. The international 
benchmark oil price Brent Crude rose 80 cents at first. But today, 
prices have backed down again. Jay Butani is an oil specialist on 
Wall Street. Iraq essentially supplies about 2 million barrels a day 
of oil to the market. That's a little over 2 percent. And while, that 
looks like a small amount, on the margin, that's a tremendous amount 
of oil if we were to lose it. Should that be lost, you would see oil 
prices go up a great deal. Whether it be deal to a shipping problem 
or whether it be due to a simply bombing of a pipeline. So, if people 
do start now worrying about a long term conflict, what would happen 
to oil prices? I think that if there was long term conflict, then 
you do have the chance that UN inspectors that currently monitor the 
oil food program would have to be removed for their safety. If those 
inspectors are removed, you can lose a substantial amount of supply 
from Iraq. And that has the capacity to create a long term sustained 
rise in the oil price. But as long as those inspectors are there or 
no facilities are attacked, there's really very little risk of any 
oil supply impact and therefore no risk to the oil price. So, people 
are seeing this very much just as a short term blip? I think that's 
essentially-the market is saying there's no more to this that we have 
to worry about. The usual safe havens where investors store their 
cash during times of conflict aren't in demand right now either; the 
dollar's fallen, Treasury bonds are down, and even the price of precious 
metals is lower. For the World, I'm Liz George in New York.
