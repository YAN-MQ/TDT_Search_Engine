For 21 years, police have kept open the murder case of Officer Ronald 
Stapleton, who was ambushed by two men outside a Brooklyn disco, stabbed 
in the eye and shot twice in the stomach with his own revolver. Thursday, 
police officially closed the case with the announcement that a Jackson 
Township, N.J., truck driver had been arrested Wednesday morning. 
The truck driver, Manny Gonzalez, 40, was picked up by New Jersey 
State Police as he left his home for work shortly after 5:30 a.m. 
Gonzalez has been charged with three counts of second-degree murder 
and would face up to life in prison if convicted, said Brooklyn District 
Attorney Charles Hynes. Gonzalez, who is being held without bail, 
pleaded not guilty to the charges during his arraignment Thursday. 
``There is a difference between making an arrest and making a case 
that can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,'' said his lawyer, Jeffrey 
Rabin. A second suspect in the killing died of AIDS in January 1997, 
police said. Police say that Gonzalez and his accomplice were lying 
in wait for someone to rob when they saw Stapleton _ who was off duty 
_ leave the Tradewinds Bar and Grill in the Sheepshead Bay section 
of Brooklyn shortly before 4:30 a.m. on Dec. 18, 1977. As one of the 
men approached, Stapleton identified himself and drew his off-duty 
revolver. The other man jumped him from behind and stabbed him in 
the right eye with a longshoreman's hook, according to police. With 
Stapleton on the ground, Gonzalez picked up the officer's .38-caliber 
handgun and shot him twice in the stomach, after which both men fled, 
police said. The officer died on January 3, 1978. He left a wife and 
two children. Reached by telephone Wednesday, Stapleton's 30-year-old 
son, Ronald, said that the shooting had devastated his family. ``I 
was 9 years old and I watched my father go off to work and never come 
back,'' he said. ``It affected my life more than I can put into words. 
This man took away my opportunity to know my father and left my mother 
in a very hard place. That was pretty hard to handle, and it made 
me grow up pretty quick.'' The investigation remained dormant for 
years until the police received a tip in mid-1997, said a law enforcement 
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The official said 
the informer pointed to Gonzalez, who has a history of convictions 
for grand larceny auto, burglary, weapons possession and criminal 
impersonation dating from 1976. But he said there was not enough evidence 
for an arrest until Wednesday. ``If you kill a New York City police 
officer, it doesn't matter how long it takes and doesn't matter where 
you go. We will find you, track you down, and you will be punished,'' 
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Thursday.
