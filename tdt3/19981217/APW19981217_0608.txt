A fast and aggressive South Korean team defeated Pakistan 3-2 Thursday, 
advancing to the gold medal match of Asian Games men's field hockey 
tournament. The Koreans will face the winner of the Japan-India semifinal, 
being played later Thursday. Korea scored two field goals and converted 
one of five penalty corners while Pakistan scored on two penalty conversions. 
Pakistan showed off its ball-stealing abilities in the first half, 
and the first score was set up when Haider Hussain and Atif Bashir 
double-teamed a Korean player to take the action back to Korea's goal 
area. Sohail Abbas then converted the corner in the 4th minute. In 
the 8th minute, Pakistan goalkeeper Muhammad Qasim made a fine save 
of a shot from about three meters out on the left side. But Korea's 
more aggressive play was starting to put pressure on the Pakistanis. 
Korea failed to score from another penalty corner in the 10th minute, 
but began frequent charges on Pakistan's area. In the 18th minute, 
the Koreans finally equalized on a field goal by Kang Keon-wook. Five 
minutes later, Korea's Yeo Woon-kon put his team up 2-1 and Kang scored 
again in the 31st minute for a 3-1 lead. Pakistan had four corners 
in the last two minutes of the half, but failed to score. In the second 
half, the Pakistanis began taking the ball to the Korean side more. 
Pakistan failed on a penalty shot in the 13th minute, but Sohail Abbas 
was successful on another chance half a minute later, narrowing Korea's 
advantage to 3-2.
