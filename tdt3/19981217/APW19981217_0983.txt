Thousands of Palestinians angered by the U.S. bombing of Iraq chanted 
``Death to Clinton'' Thursday, only days after cheering him in his 
visit to the West Bank and Gaza Strip seen as recognition of Palestinian 
claims to independence. In three West Bank towns, marchers threw stones 
at Israeli soldiers who fired rubber bullets. In one confrontation 
outside Ramallah, a 20-year-old Palestinian was killed by Israeli 
army fire and 16 were injured by rubber bullets, doctors said. The 
U.S. attack on Iraq early Thursday placed Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat in a dilemma. Arafat has been careful not to hurt his growing 
ties with the United States, considered an important asset in the 
quest for statehood. However, Arafat also could not afford to be seen 
as going against the widespread support among his people for Iraq. 
U.S. President Bill Clinton sent Arafat a letter Thursday to explain 
why he attacked Iraq, Arafat's office said. A senior Palestinian Authority 
official, Saeb Erekat, adopted a carefully worded position of compromise 
after the latest U.S. attack. The United States should halt its attacks 
and Iraq should comply with U.N. weapons inspectors, Erekat said. 
In the 1991 Gulf War, Arafat had sided with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. 
Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator with Israel, said a war in 
the Gulf will also cause further delays in the implementation of the 
Wye River land-for-peace agreement Clinton helped negotiate. In handling 
the public outpouring of support for Iraq, Arafat permitted rallies 
and marches, but ordered his security forces to disperse violent protests. 
In the West Bank towns of Bethlehem and Hebron, Palestinian police 
moved quickly to break up dozens of Palestinian teen-agers who threw 
stones at Israeli troops. Only two days earlier, Clinton had sung 
along with a Palestinian children's choir in Manger Square in Bethlehem, 
the traditional birthplace of Jesus. However, in Ramallah, Palestinian 
police stood back for more than an hour while about 200 teen-agers 
threw stones at Israeli soldiers who responded with rubber bullets. 
The largest pro-Iraq rally was held in the West Bank town of Nablus 
where about 3,000 Palestinians took to the streets, chanting ``Death 
to America'' and ``Death to Clinton.'' Protesters burned a dozen U.S. 
flags, including those that had been distributed by the Palestinian 
Authority several days earlier to cheer the arrival of Clinton in 
the Gaza Strip and Bethlehem. ``Two days ago, Clinton was here and 
we thought he carried a message of peace,'' said Majeda Masri, a teen-age 
marcher. ``But now it is clear that he is a murderer.'' The Nablus 
rally appeared to be spontaneous, starting out with about 200 high 
school students, with older people gradually joining in. However, 
in other areas, the marches were orchestrated, with pre-schoolers 
and elementary school students handed Iraqi flags by their teachers 
and told what to chant. In downtown Gaza City, about 300 elementary 
school students assembled in Palestine Square. Some carried empty 
milk bottles and others smeared fake blood on their clothes to dramatize 
the suffering of the Iraqi people. Most Palestinians strongly identify 
with the Iraqis as fellow Arabs and fellow Muslims, though their support 
does not necessarily extend to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. ``What 
Clinton has done is unfair,'' said Hussein Najib, who sells bread 
from a cart in the West Bank town of Ramallah. ``The only victims 
of such attacks are the Iraqi people.'' In the Gaza Strip, Iraqi flags 
quickly replaced U.S. banners that had covered the streets earlier 
this week. Safi Sayed, a Gaza City grocer who had done a brisk business 
with U.S. flags was now selling Iraqi flags. Sayed said the Clinton 
visit to Gaza had given him hope, but he was now disappointed. ``We 
are very sorry about this strike against our people in Iraq,'' Sayed 
said.
