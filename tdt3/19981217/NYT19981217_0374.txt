A North Korean vessel that intruded deep into South Korea's waters 
was pursued and sunk Friday morning after a fire fight with South 
Korean forces, South Korean officials said. The vessel, whose incursion 
is sure to aggravate the already strained relations between North 
Korea and the rest of the world, was first detected late Thursday 
a mile from the city of Yosu on South Korea's southern coast, the 
Defense Ministry said. After a pursuit in which the North and South 
Korean boats exchanged fire, the South Korean navy sank the intruder 
at dawn Friday about 60 miles off shore in 300 feet of water. South 
Korea referred to the North Korean boat as a ``half-submarine,'' describing 
it as a high-speed boat that is mostly submerged and thus difficult 
to detect. ``There were a series of warnings and warning shots by 
the joint forces against the escaping half-submarine, but the sub 
continued to flee and fired back,'' said Hwang Dong Kyu, a Defense 
Ministry spokesman. ``As a result, a Korean naval vessel fired on 
and sank the submarine.'' The half-submarine carried about four people, 
and the body of one North Korean commando was recovered in the water, 
the Defense Ministry said. Relations between North Korea and the West 
have been deteriorating, with North Korean officials regularly warning 
of the possibility of another Korean war. The four-year-old ``Agreed 
Framework'' intended to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula has 
seemed in recent months to be headed for a possible breakdown. In 
addition, North Korea is believed to be close to conducting another 
rocket test, after one over Japan in September sent tensions rising 
in East Asia. The one leader who has been arguing for conciliatory 
policies to engage the North has been President Kim Dae Jung of South 
Korea, but Kim's calls have been constantly undermined by North Korea. 
Already criticized for being soft on the North, Kim may find his room 
to maneuver even more limited after Thursday's incursion. North Korea 
had no immediate comment. But the North normally denies that it ever 
sends commandos into the South, and when it has been caught, it has 
said that its submarines have lost power and drifted south, even when 
the prevailing current is moving north. Military officers and diplomats 
in Seoul say that North Korea regularly sends submarines sneaking 
into South Korean waters, partly to infiltrate commandos for reconnaissance 
missions to gather intelligence. Several times it has been caught, 
most spectacularly in September 1996, when a taxi driver along the 
South Korean coast spotted a 110-foot North Korean submarine that 
had been beached on the rocks. An intensive search then by 40,000 
South Korean troops turned up 25 North Korean intruders, some of them 
killed by other North Koreans so as not to slow the group down. One 
was never found and is presumed to have died in the woods or possibly 
to have slipped across the border back to the North. As recently as 
June, another North Korean submarine was captured in South Korean 
waters, and shortly afterward the body of a North Korean commando 
_ apparently from a different submarine _ was found on a South Korean 
beach. North Korea has many spies in South Korea, and it is relatively 
easy to give a North Korean spy a fake or stolen Japanese passport 
and have him fly into South Korea in the comfort of business class. 
So one of the puzzles has been why North Korea goes to the risk of 
infiltrating with submarines and other vessels. Intelligence analysts 
say that one reason may be to test South Korean defenses, for in a 
war North Korean doctrine calls for infiltrating commandos deep into 
South Korea to disrupt communications and blow up buildings to sow 
chaos and fear. In addition, some of the submarines are said to be 
dropping off weapons to be hidden in case they are needed in the future.
