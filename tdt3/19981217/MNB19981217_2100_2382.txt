The events of this D still under way as we head into evening here 
in washington. President Clinton, secretary of state Albright have 
been calling foreign leaders trying to round up support for the air 
strikes. But Russia, China, France, calling for an immediate end. 
With more on how this is playing overseas in the nation that is the 
only ally, really, in this operation -- it's the U.S. and the U.K. 
-- let's go to Charles Sabine in our London bureau. An all-day world 
opinion about the strikes is still polarizing. It's not just in Washington, 
it seems, that Bill Clinton is looking for friends right now. It was 
toney blare who emphasized his credentials as Bill Clinton's greatest 
Ally when asked in parliament today if the timing was just too convenient 
for his friend. I refute this entirely. I have no doubt at all that 
action is fully justied now. Instead, not for the first time, he has 
shown the courage to do the right thing, and he has my full support. 
Today's waves of attacks were supported by other key countries -- 
Germany, canada, Spain, and Holland, all backed the strikes. But has 
the day went on, the list of critics grew. Some were expected. Russian 
President Yeltsin said today the strikes are fraught with the most 
dramatic consequenc, and he recalled his ambassador to Washington. 
China continued to condemn the action outright, and the French president 
said the strikes will not save the crisis. But even more worryingly, 
members of the old gulf war coalition switched sides. Italy, for example, 
called for a halt to the raids. And against a backdrop of flag burning 
in the streets, the Arab media have been especially critical. Egypt, 
a staunch Ally in 1991, voiced its regret at the action. Pakistan 
called the United States international terrorists. Even Iran, Iraq's 
sworn enemy, has condemned the strikes, especially after a missile 
landed on their territory. Surrounded by heightened emotions, israelians 
today increased their alert, despite assessments they are unlikely 
to be targeted with reprisals. A lot of bridge building left for the 
president, Brian. Charles Sabine in our London bureau tonight. Thank 
you, Brian. Thanks for watching the national media for us.
