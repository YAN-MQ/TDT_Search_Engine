Momentous political shifts always breed unintended consequences, and 
frequently the changes are cultural. So when the Soviet Union collapsed 
a decade ago, it stood to reason that artistic ground would begin 
to shift. Indeed, one of the happier consequences of that nation's 
disintegration has been the reappearance in the West of the Russian 
singer. For years, this special breed of artist was largely absent 
from European and American view, a casualty of Stalinism, World War 
II and cold-war politics. True, exemplars like the contralto Zara 
Dolukhanova, the mezzo-soprano Irina Arkhipova and the soprano Galina 
Vishnevskaya achieved some popularity in the West, but they were deployed 
both as political tools and as artistic ambassadors. In fact, not 
since the czarist era have Russian singers attained the unfettered 
mainstream exposure they currently enjoy, once more regularly appearing 
in Western opera houses and signing contracts with major record labels. 
Perhaps the most conspicuous example of their resurgence can be found 
on the Philips label, on which the indefatigable conductor Valery 
Gergiev spearheads a seemingly endless series of Russian operas, including 
many obscure works. Largely as a result of his efforts, several soloists 
have emerged as stars in their own right, including the soprano Galina 
Gorchakova, the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina and, to a lesser extent, 
the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky. Widely popular and critically acclaimed, 
these three singers supplement their operatic work with successful 
recital tours and have lately signed exclusive contracts with Philips, 
which is practically cornering the market on Russian vocalists these 
days. And as three recent disks confirm, the label's confidence in 
these performers is not misplaced. On her disk of Russian romances 
titled ``Memories of Love'' (446 720-2), Ms. Gorchakova, accompanied 
by a piano, sings bittersweet works by Balakirev, Glinka, Tchaikovsky, 
Rimsky-Korsakov, Rachmaninoff and Aleksandr Dargomyzhsky, all of which 
perfectly suit this soprano's sepulchral timbre. The Glinka songs 
make a particularly deep impression. With a firm, darkly tinted voice, 
Ms. Gorchakova provides a pointed melancholy to ``The Lark,'' delivering 
with the song's last phrase _ ``Someone will remember me and sigh 
in secret'' _ with devastating effect. For ``I Remember the Wonderful 
Moment,'' based on a Pushkin text, she alternates between naivete 
and worldweariness. And ``You Will Soon Forget Me'' is a study in 
rue. But in the high-spirited ``Bolero,'' the soprano breaks with 
restraint and opts for gripping abandon. In Tchaikovsky, too, Ms. 
Gorchakova impresses. Listeners may recall the fine performance of 
the Letter Scene from ``Eugene Onegin'' that appeared on a Philips 
disk two years ago. On this new record, the soprano animates four 
of the composer's songs, beginning with a hypnotic lullaby. The three 
love songs that follow find a wistful Ms. Gorchakova highlighting 
the undercurrent of loneliness pervading the pieces. Dargomyzhsky's 
music may not be familiar outside Russia, but his songs stir the soul 
as much any on this disk. Few listeners will be able to resist the 
passionate pull of ``I Love Him Still,'' for instance, in which Ms. 
Gorchakova spins a simple line with eloquence and dignity. The sentimental 
``Sixteen Years'' is no less involving, recounting a timid girl's 
first romance. Despite all the attention lavished on his piano concertos, 
the songs of Rachmaninoff remain little known. This is a pity, for 
there is a mysterious beauty to these miniature dramas. Ms. Gorchakova 
captures that sense of atmosphere completely, especially in ``A Dream'' 
and ``Lilacs.'' The pianist Larissa Gergieva (a sister of Gergiev) 
proves an imaginative accompanist, her painterly touch enhancing the 
spell cast by Ms. Gorchakova. Unfortunately, neither artist is helped 
by this CDs overly reverberant acoustics, which makes both singer 
and pianist sound as if they're performing in a gymnasium. Ms. Borodina's 
album, ``Bolero'' (289 446 708-2), also with piano accompaniment, 
is ostensibly a Spanish program rather than a Russian one. But though 
the record features music by Falla and Granados (and even Ravel's 
``Spanish Song''), the bulk of the disk is devoted to works by Shostakovich, 
Glinka, Dargomyzhsky, Anton Rubinstein and Mark Minkov, all of whom 
found inspiration in images of sunny Iberia. ``Ronda'' is a call to 
make merry, and this mezzo's warm, inviting tone makes the offer hard 
to resist. For the tender ``Eyes of Ebony,'' Ms. Borodina becomes 
a girl driven to distraction by unrequited love. Instead of the fire 
that pervades Ms. Gorchakova's account of Glinka's ``Bolero,'' Ms. 
Borodina favors sultriness, and one can practically see the mezzo 
shimmying up to some young gallant and seducing him. Falla's ``Seven 
Popular Songs'' are a bold choice for a Russian singer, but Ms. Borodina, 
adopting a Castilian lisp, fully steps up to the challenge. Naturally, 
her diction is not as idiomatic as Victoria de los Angeles's, yet 
the mezzo connects with these passionate strains. Even tongue-twisters 
like ``Seguidilla From Murcia'' do not defeat her. She brings poignancy 
to ``Asturian Song'' and a dreamy calm to ``Lullaby.'' And she presents 
a searing account of ``Polo,'' one woman's curse on love itself. Semyon 
Skigin's assertive piano accompaniment suits Ms. Borodina's bold approach. 
He is a gifted player with more than a few ideas of his own. (Listen 
to the extra bounce he lends the introduction to Falla's ``Jota,'' 
for example.) Yet Skigin proves no stranger to nuance, either, as 
his playing on Minkov's bucolic ``Landscape'' shows. Hvorostovsky 
is the most famous singer to have emerged from the former Soviet Union. 
In 1989, he won the BBC's Cardiff Singer of the World Competition, 
beating Bryn Terfel for top honors. His latest disk, ``Arie Antiche'' 
(289 456 543-2), with the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields conducted 
by Neville Marriner, breaks new ground by featuring the baritone in 
Italian arias of the 17th and 18th centuries. Though the popularity 
of these ardent works has declined over the years, Beniamino Gigli, 
Ezio Pinza, Janet Baker and other singers memorably recorded many 
of them, and the pieces _ by both famous composers like Handel, Gluck 
and Vivaldi and neglected ones like Durante, Caccini and Stradella 
_ have much to recommend them. A few, like Gluck's ``Che faro senza 
Euridice?'' and Handel's ``Ombra mai fu,'' have retained their renown, 
but most will be unfamiliar to listeners. Hvorostovsky begins on an 
exultant note, with Giacomo Carissimi's ``Vittoria, mio core,'' in 
which a man heroically proclaims his freedom from ``love's vile servitude.'' 
Here, the plush-voiced baritone is at his swaggering best, dispatching 
coloratura with ease. He's no less fine in Vivaldi's ``Se il cor guerriero,'' 
where a martial antiwar cry is set against ``Four Seasons''-like accompaniment. 
In Giuseppe Giordani's ``Caro mio ben,'' the baritone delivers a declaration 
of love in a resonant, fervent voice, easily displacing Pinza's late-in-life 
recording of the song. Yet Hvorostovsky falls short of the standard 
set by Gigli's incomparably sensitive account, now sadly out-of-print. 
Vivaldi's ``Orribile lo scempio,'' yet another antiwar jeremiad, affords 
the baritone an opportunity for vocal gymnastics, which he gleefully 
seizes. Antonio Caldara's sublime ``Selve amiche,'' is much gentler 
stuff, with the singer imploring the woods to grant his aching heart 
refuge. But though the baritone feels Caldara's music, he lacks Gigli's 
clutching desperation. Gigli also lingers in the memory when hearing 
Hvorostovsky in Alessandro Scarlatti's hymn to the sun, ``Gia il sole 
dal Gange.'' The baritone takes the tune at an impressively speedy 
clip and lends it bluff ardor, but he lacks Gigli's gay, celebratory 
sense. This CD concludes with Hvorostovsky's plaintive performance 
of Alessandro Stradella's ``Pieta, Signore,'' the longest work on 
the record. A plea to God's mercy, the piece benefits from the baritone's 
supple treatment and exquisite diction. Actually, Hvorostovsky's Italian 
is crisply idiomatic throughout the disk. For support, the baritone 
couldn't have done better. Marriner conducted a similar album for 
Ms. Baker two decades ago, and his appreciation for these scores seems 
only to have grown with time. Under his keen baton, the academy plays 
in typically polished fashion, its strings lissome, winds pellucid 
and brass glinting. Fifteen years ago, circumstances would not have 
permitted Ms. Gorchakova, Ms. Borodina and Hvorostovsky their international 
careers. Now, Western ears regularly seek out the bold, viscous sonorities 
of the Russian singer, and a rudely interrupted line that began when 
the gramophone was young thrives yet again. How lucky for music lovers 
that times have changed. NYT-12-15-98 2132EST
