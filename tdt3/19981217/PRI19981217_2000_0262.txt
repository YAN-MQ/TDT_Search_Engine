Mexican authorities say an American newspaper reporter has been murder 
while on assignment in the remote western part of the country. NPR's 
Philip Davis reports from Mexico City. Philip True, a reporter for 
the San Antonio Express News, had been missing for a week after leaving 
November 29th to do a story on the Wetal Indians in the rugged Sierra 
Madre Mountains in Halusco State. After failing to return home, the 
government order a massive manhunt. His body was discovered yesterday 
at the bottom of a 330-foot ravine by searchers conducting an over-flight 
of the area. Officials at first though the fall was accidentally. 
Today however, the state coroner said that an autopsy had revealed 
that the 50-year old True had been straggled. True had been the San 
Antonio's paper Mexico correspondent since 1996 and covered everything 
from the Zapatis rebel conflict in the south to border issues in the 
north. He leaves behind a wife Marta, who is 5-months pregnant. Philip 
Davis, NPR News, Mexico City.
