In Washington, David Levy, spokesman for the National Security Council, 
says the strikes today and yesterday hit their targets, but they could 
mark the death now for the UN weapons inspection program. I think 
for all intensive purposes and we have to move beyond UNSCOM. We'd 
certainly like them to be able to get back there. But clearly, UNSCOM 
has not been effective over the last year. They were harassed, intimidated, 
under cut almost every corner. And that's why we had to take this 
military action, because we just cannot trust Saddam Hussein to ever 
comply and we have to get to these weapons of mass destruction by 
other means. So, even if it is the end of the road for the UNSCOM, 
what about other forces that will continue to be deployed in the Gulf? 
Well, absolutely, we will continue to have a foreign presence in the 
Gulf and we'll continue to contain the threat of Saddam Hussein. We 
will hold the threat of military force in the future over his head 
if he does threaten his neighbors, or if he does continue to develop 
these weapons of mass destruction. He must know that he will pay a 
grace price. But, that requires significant and perhaps long term 
commitments to this. There's a question of time and also how much 
we can contain all at once given for instance threats by Obsana bin 
Laden. We've had a pretty forward leading military posture in the 
Gulf for many years. We have significant interest there; the stability 
of the region, Israeli's security, oil, the threat that Saddam poses 
Iran. As we look around and see where our forces should be deployed, 
the Persian Gulf and the Middle East is always at the top of that 
list. David Levy of the National Security Council, thank you. Thanks.
