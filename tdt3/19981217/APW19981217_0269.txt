The head of Russia's largest television network asked President Boris 
Yeltsin on Thursday for protection because he says opposition leaders 
are trying to influence the debt-ridden media outlet. Igor Shabdurasulov, 
the director of state-controlled ORT or Russian Public Television, 
claimed that Communist politicians are using the company's massive 
debts in a bid to take control. According to the business daily Kommersant, 
ORT owes up to dlrs 80 million to private creditors and the government. 
Authorities recently launched bankruptcy proceedings against it. Shabdurasulov 
accused Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet of doing nothing 
to protect ORT from attacks by the Communists. He also said that Moscow 
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of the country's most powerful politicians 
and a leading presidential candidate, is trying to manipulate the 
outlet. ``Russian Public Television is again under enormous pressure, 
and the reason is the struggle for the presidential seat, the struggle 
for power by unscrupulous politicians,'' Shabdurasulov said in an 
open letter to Yeltsin, released by the Interfax news agency. There 
was no immediate reaction from Yeltsin's office. A senior Cabinet 
official, who declined to be named, said Shabdurasulov was trying 
to cover his own incompetence with the statement. ORT drew criticism 
from opposition leaders in 1996 for what they said was unfair coverage 
of that year's presidential race. The station focused heavily on Yeltsin's 
campaign, while mostly ignoring his opponent, Communist leader Gennady 
Zyuganov.
