Five more suspects have been indicted in connection with the U.S. 
embassy bombings in east Africa. They are charged with conspiracy 
in the explosion in Tanzania, that killed 11 people in August. They 
were added to a federal indictment in New York. All told, 13 people 
are wanted for the bombings, most of them for the one in Nairobi, 
Kenya. Among the suspects is osama bin laden, a fugitive millionaire 
who prosecutors believe masterminded the attacks.
