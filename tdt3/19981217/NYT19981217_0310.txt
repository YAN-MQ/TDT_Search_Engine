The Spanish judge who issued the arrest warrant for Gen. Augusto Pinochet 
in October expects to present an even stronger case against the former 
Chilean dictator when England's Law Lords reconsider his immunity 
from arrest, a Madrid court official said Thursday. The official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 285-page indictment provides 
more specifics than the arrest warrant and extradition request filed 
earlier by the judge, Baltasar Garzon, who indicted Pinochet on Dec. 
10, after the Law Lords ruled on Nov. 25 that he had no immunity from 
prosecution. On Thursday they rejected their earlier ruling. The indictment 
lays out the most detailed case to date against Pinochet for the crimes 
of ``genocide, terrorism and torture,'' the official said.
