Russia and China angrily denounced the U.S.-British attack on Iraq, 
while allies such as Germany and Canada offered their immediate support, 
placing all blame for the crisis on Saddam Hussein. Iraq's neighbor, 
Iran, joined Russia and China in blasting the use of force and warning 
that it could shatter regional security. Fearful of recriminations, 
the United States today closed all but two of its African embassies, 
and security was stepped up at many U.S. and British institutions 
worldwide, from the Philippines to Greece and Denmark. Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin demanded an immediate end to the military campaign, 
while his foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said the United States and 
Britain had acted without U.N. authorization. ``Nobody has the right 
to act on their own in the name of the United Nations and even less 
to pretend to be the judge of the entire world,'' Ivanov said in Madrid, 
Spain. China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he 
emerged from a Security Council session Wednesday evening, learning 
of the attack only after the fact. ``There is absolutely no excuse 
or pretext to use force against Iraq,'' he said. The German government 
noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership ``had been warned'' the 
international community would have to act if it failed to cooperate 
fully with U.N. weapons inspectors. Support for the airstrikes also 
poured in from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, 
the Netherlands, Austria and Spain. ``Saddam Hussein has brought this 
crisis on himself,'' Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said. France, 
which has close ties to Iraq, deplored ``the grave human consequences'' 
of the military strikes, but added its regret that Iraqi leaders were 
unable to ``show proof of the spirit of complete cooperation'' demanded 
by previous agreements with the United Nations. Iranian television 
quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying that ``such unilateral 
attacks against Iraq will lead to even more pain and misery for the 
people of that country and will bring about insecurity in the region.'' 
Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi urged the U.N. Security Council to take 
immediate action to prevent ``further deterioration'' of the situation, 
television reported. Iran also called on Baghdad to cooperate with 
the United Nations. In a statement today, NATO Secretary-General Javier 
Solana blamed Saddam for ``the grave situation'' while Turkey, fearing 
an influx of refugees, closed its border with Iraq, the Anatolia news 
agency reported. Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem expressed disappointment 
in the attack, but also called on Iraq to comply. In Pakistan, however, 
the Senate passed a resolution unanimously condemning the airstrikes 
as ``an attack on humanity and the Islamic world.'' Islamic Pakistan's 
right-wing religious group called the United States ``international 
terrorists.'' The strikes led news reports in Lebanon, where all newspaper, 
radio and television stations carried news agency reports without 
comment. In Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation, leaders 
pleaded for restraint. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka 
backed the United States and Britain, saying, ``We strongly demand 
that Iraq immediately and unconditionally implement the U.N. Security 
Council's resolutions.'' He was seconded by Misao Nozaki, a 47-year-old 
Tokyo restaurant owner who called the bombing justified ``because 
Iraq has continued developing nuclear weapons in a way that goes against 
the common sense of the rest of the world.'' But Yukari Ohi, 38, an 
office worker in Tokyo, said she opposed the use of force. ``I think 
the U.S. decision to attack Iraq was apparently intended to shift 
attention from the impeachment issue to war,'' Ohi said, noting that 
the airstrikes came as President Clinton faced an impeachment vote. 
India condemned the attack, while Mexico expressed disappointment. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal, saying, 
``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take care of 
defending itself if the need arises.''
