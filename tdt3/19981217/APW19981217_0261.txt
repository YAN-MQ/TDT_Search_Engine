President Boris Yeltsin kept a close watch on developments in Iraq 
on Thursday, in between meetings with the leaders of Belarus and Switzerland, 
his press service said. At a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander 
Lukashenko, Yeltsin said the economic situation in Russia ``is now 
stable,'' the Interfax news agency reported. Yeltsin has made a number 
of public appearances since he was released from a hospital a week 
ago to finish recovering from pneumonia. He had received treatment 
for more than two weeks. Yeltsin was up for much of the night monitoring 
the situation in Iraq, according to aides. He condemned the attacks 
on Baghdad by the United States and Great Britain. The president met 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Chief of Staff Nikolai Bordyuzha 
to discuss Iraq, as well as Russia's pressing economic problems. He 
also talked to Chinese President Jiang Zemin by telephone about Iraq. 
Later, he met at the Kremlin with Swiss President Flavio Cotti, in 
Russia on a three-day visit. There was no immediate report of their 
discussion, but they had been expected to discuss economic crimes, 
among other things. The Russian president then met with Lukashenko, 
who said before arriving in Moscow on Wednesday that he would only 
discuss strengthening a union treaty between Belarus and Russia during 
his trip. But the two leaders had also been expected to discuss Belarus's 
massive economic problems, deepened by Russia's financial collapse 
in August. Belarus was hit harder by the crash than other former Soviet 
republics because of its strong trade links to Russia and already 
weak currency. In an interview with the newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta, 
Lukashenko called for pooling the financial resources of Russian and 
Belarus. Lukashenko has frequently pushed closer ties to Russia, in 
part out of an ambition to restore the Soviet Union. Yeltsin has largely 
passed on responsibility for the country's pressing economic problems 
to Primakov, and has not traveled abroad recently because of his health. 
Still, he insists he will serve out his term, which ends in 2000.
