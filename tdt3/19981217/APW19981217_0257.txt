Reacting to protests from South Korea over medals it lost under a 
two-per-country limit, an official of the Asian Games' governing body 
promised Thursday that clearer rules would be written. South Koreans 
had swept the top three places in some archery, equestrian and bowling 
events, but received only the gold and silver medals because of the 
games' limit. In their latest protest, over a bronze lost in equestrian 
competition, the Koreans insisted that some individual sports federations 
allowed complete medal sweeps in one event, and that their athletes 
had earned the bronzes. Wei Jizhong of China, chairman of the Olympic 
Council of Asia Sports Committee, apologized at a news conference, 
saying ``some misunderstanding arose'' because the rules were not 
clearly stipulated in the games' technical handbook. He also said 
the rule had not been applied strictly at the last Asian Games in 
Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. ``I thought I would get better understanding 
and cooperation from the delgations that have been hurt by this rule,'' 
Wei said. He said the committee would study proposals from the delegations 
and sports federations, ``and try to write out regulations more precisely 
and clearly.''
