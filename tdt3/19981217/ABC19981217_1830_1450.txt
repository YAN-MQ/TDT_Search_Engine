I'm going to interrupt the three of you because there's apparently 
something developing on Capitol Hill. I want to go to Linda Douglass. 
As though the capital weren't already reeling, there's a story out 
saying that the speaker to be, Bob Livingston, is now telling republican 
members they're all meeting together behind closed doors, that he's 
had numerous skl affairs over his 30-year marriage. Apparently Livingston 
is offering to resign. Now, we are told that speaker Tom DeLay will 
try to stop that. We don't know if Livingston has resigned. But the 
report again from role call is that he was going to tell them that 
he would like to resign or offered to resign. Thank you, Linda. In 
a crazy week, let me go back to cokie Roberts and ask you how you 
think this will land among the members of the house. This is very 
shocking. People were hoping that they were now in a stable place, 
once they got impeachment behind them that they could then move on 
to a new republican team, a new republican agenda. I will tell you, 
Peter, that someone close to the White House did tell me a Rumor along 
those lines a couple of weeks ago. I was shocked to have that person 
spreading that rumor. Do you think it will have any effect on the 
impeachment debate? Oh, probably. I don't think it will change the 
outcome of the debate, but it could postpone the debate. Okay. Another 
very small bomb shell on Capitol Hill here tonight, not to be compared 
to what's happening in Iraq tonight. We'll come back and continue 
this.
