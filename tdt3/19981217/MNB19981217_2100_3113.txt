Despite the military operation under way in Iraq at this hour, there's 
no stopping the impeachment process under way here on the hill. Republican 
leaders say the debate will go on tomorrow morning despite protests 
from democrats. We get more from NBC's Gwen Ifill here with us on 
Capitol Hill tonight. Good evening. The late breaking news of course 
on Capitol Hill was the news that G.O.P. speaker-elect, Bob Livingston 
told his colleagues tonight he had had infidelities in his marriage 
over time, but drew the difference between his and the kind the president 
had confessed to, can which he said lying under oath. We didn't hear 
from Livingston but from his spokesman. I'd like to make a clarification 
statement on previous reports. There has been no talk of resignation. 
The republican conference is solidly behind Mr. Livingston to be speaker. 
Republicans were staunchly behind Mr. Livingston. In fact, they were 
suspicious of a potential White House hand in all of this. We listened 
to some of what they had to say as they came out of a meeting with 
their new leader. Personal responsibility simply means if you make 
a choice, good or bad, you have to be man or woman enough to stand 
up and accept it. And that's what speaker-elect Livingston has done, 
and I think that's what you call personal -- I certainly hope that 
we don't think that the answer to the articles of impeachment and 
the president's legal problems is to go after exposing everybody's 
family life to public exposure. Bob Livingston has the full support 
of our conference. He has even more support for his honor and his 
Candor and his integrity in addressing this directly. He never lied 
under oath. He never suborned perjury over this subject. He not only 
admitted his errant conduct of years ago. He was prepared to accept 
the consequences. And the consequences are going to be that he'll 
be the next speaker of the House of Representatives.
