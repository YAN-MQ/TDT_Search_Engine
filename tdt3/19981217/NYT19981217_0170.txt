The biggest mystery about ``Outside Ozona'' isn't the identity of 
the serial killer who cuts out the hearts of his female victims. (The 
murderer, who is obvious from the moment he appears, is shown doing 
his dirty work roughly halfway through the film.) The wonder is why 
reputable actors agreed to appear in a movie whose plodding screenplay, 
by J.S. Cardone, who also directed, has the feel of an earnest, immature 
play-wrighting exercise. The characters in this implausible, awkwardly 
acted melodrama are Texans and Oklahomans whose tidy little speeches 
are devoid of vernacular tang or credibility. The story methodically 
cuts from an Oklahoma radio station where a rebellious all-night disk 
jockey (Taj Mahal) plays the blues instead of country music, to the 
chagrin of the station manager (Meat Loaf) and assorted itinerants 
on the road. Tuning in to the all-night broadcast while driving through 
the desolate Southwest are three sets of couples and a weather-beaten 
trucker. While listening to these cardboard characters bicker, it's 
all too easy to picture them as entries in a screenwriter's notebook, 
with each one's background details and personality traits duly ticked 
off as the movie slogs along. The couples include a grumpy unemployed 
clown (Kevin Pollak) and his white-trash girlfriend (Penelope Ann 
Miller); two feuding sisters, one a yuppie nightmare, the other an 
easygoing salt-of-the-earth type, and a young Navajo woman and her 
dying grandmother. Robert Forster is a rugged trucker with a heart 
of gold who rescues a stray dog at a filling station, and Swoosie 
Kurtz plays a hard-bitten truck-stop waitress who pines for him. David 
Paymer is a soft-spoken Chicago psychiatrist who is unaccountably 
on the road in the middle of the night. Long before the story culminates 
in a fiery highway collision, these lifeless creations have worn out 
their welcome by talking our ears off without saying anything of significance.
