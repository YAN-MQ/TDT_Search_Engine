With more details on "operation desert fox," here's Gene Randall. 
His national security team summoned to the White House to update him 
on the early results of the air strikes President Clinton used an 
oval office photo op to endorse what he had put into motion. I am 
convinced the decision I made to order this military act strun, though 
difficult, was absolutely the right thing to do. It is in our interests 
and the interests of people all around the world. On Capitol Hill, 
welcome words for the White House from Newt gingrich. Initially called 
to consider impeachment the house this day passed a Resolution supporting 
U.S. forces in the Persian gulf. We have a chance today to say to 
the world, no matter what our constitutional process, whether it is 
an election eve or it is the eve of a Constitutional vote no matter 
what our debates at home, we are, as a Nation, prepared to lead the 
world. In fact, even as new U.S. combat units left for the gulf, some 
republicans were still questioning the president's timing. One in 
very harsh terms. I don't know any other president of the that is 
recognized as a liar as this president is and thus when he ordered 
our military people into action, there's a credibility problem. The 
president rejected any notion his timetable was dictated by the pending 
impeachment vote. I don't think any serious person would believe that 
any president would do such a thing. Congressional sources say the 
impeachment debate will take place friday with votes set for Saturday. 
Democrats are voicing outrage. We would look down upon any activity 
in this body to go forward with impeachment while American men and 
women are engaged in armed conflict. Meanwhile the Pentagon was saying 
the Iraq mission was going well. We are achieving good coverage of 
our targets, and as a result, we are advancing our goal of containing 
Saddam Hussein. We are diminishing his ability to attack his neighbors, 
either conventionally or with weapons of mass destruction. Cohen said 
there was more to do and by midday came the word a Second day of attacks 
had begun. Gene Randall, CNN, Washington.
