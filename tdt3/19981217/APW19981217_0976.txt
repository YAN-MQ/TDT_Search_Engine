Russia and China angrily denounced the U.S. attack on Iraq, while 
allies such as Germany and Canada offered their immediate support, 
placing all blame for the crisis on Saddam Hussein. ``Nobody has the 
right to act on their own in the name of the United Nations and even 
less to pretend to be the judge of the entire world,'' Russian Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov said in Madrid, Spain. Iraq's neighbor and former 
foe in war, Iran, joined Russia and China in blasting the use of force, 
saying it will bring ``even more pain and misery for the people in 
that country.'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi also urged 
Iraq to cooperate with the United Nations. Fearful of recriminations, 
the United States today closed all but two of its African embassies, 
and security was stepped up at many U.S. and British institutions 
worldwide, from the Philippines to Greece and Denmark. The U.S. State 
Department ordered the departure of some of its embassy personnel 
in Kuwait and warned other Americans living there to consider leaving. 
The Arab League condemned the strikes, and a Gulf official said Baghdad 
had reached out for Arab support to stop the attacks. Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin demanded an immediate end to the military campaign, 
and Chinese President Jiang Zemin also asked President Clinton to 
refrain from further attacks. ``This is a violation of the U.N. charter 
and the principles of international law, and we condemn this,'' said 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi. The German government 
noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership ``had been warned'' the 
international community would have to act if it failed to cooperate 
fully with U.N. weapons inspectors. Support for the airstrikes also 
poured in from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, 
the Netherlands, Austria and Spain. ``Saddam Hussein has brought this 
crisis on himself,'' Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said. France, 
which has close ties to Iraq, deplored ``the grave human consequences'' 
of the military strikes, but added its regret that Iraqi leaders were 
unable to ``show proof of the spirit of complete cooperation'' demanded 
by previous agreements with the United Nations. Fearing an influx 
of refugees, both Jordan and Turkey closed the borders they share 
with Iraq. In a statement today, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
blamed Saddam for ``the grave situation'' while Turkish Foreign Minister 
Ismail Cem expressed disappointment in the attack but also called 
on Iraq to comply. In Pakistan, the Senate passed a resolution unanimously 
condemning the airstrikes as ``an attack on humanity and the Islamic 
world.'' Islamic Pakistan's right-wing religious group called the 
United States ``international terrorists.'' The strikes led news reports 
in Lebanon, where all newspaper, radio and television stations carried 
news agency reports without comment. In Indonesia, the world's most 
populous Islamic nation, leaders pleaded for restraint. Japan's Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka backed the United States and Britain, 
saying, ``We strongly demand that Iraq immediately and unconditionally 
implement the U.N. Security Council's resolutions.'' He was seconded 
by Misao Nozaki, a 47-year-old Tokyo restaurant owner who called the 
bombing justified ``because Iraq has continued developing nuclear 
weapons in a way that goes against the common sense of the rest of 
the world.'' But Yukari Ohi, 38, an office worker in Tokyo, said she 
opposed the use of force. ``I think the U.S. decision to attack Iraq 
was apparently intended to shift attention from the impeachment issue 
to war,'' Ohi said, noting that the airstrikes came as Clinton faced 
an impeachment vote. India condemned the attack, while Mexico expressed 
disappointment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal, 
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take 
care of defending itself if the need arises.'' Russian legislators 
had perhaps the most novel response. Russia's lower chamber of Parliament 
agreed today to consider a motion appealing to Monica Lewinsky to 
help halt the military strikes. ``The State Duma appeals to Ms. Lewinsky 
to undertake corresponding measures to restrain the emotions of Bill 
Clinton,'' said the motion by nationalist lawmaker Alexander Filatov. 
Lawmakers considered including the motion in a broader resolution 
denouncing the attack on Iraq. But seeking to speed up passage of 
the resolution, they approved it later without any additions.
