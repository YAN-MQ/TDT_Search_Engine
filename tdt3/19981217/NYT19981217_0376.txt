Student demonstrators clashed with soldiers Thursday in a burst of 
gunfire, stone-throwing and clouds of tear gas as President B.J. Habibie 
warned that continued protests could lead to ``the disintegration 
of the nation.'' About 4,000 demonstrators, some of them throwing 
gasoline bombs, challenged security forces guarding the Parliament 
building. The military said 14 soldiers and police officers were wounded, 
four of them seriously. Estimates of injured students treated at hospitals 
ranged from 50 to more than 100. It was the latest and one of the 
most violent of the mostly peaceful student demonstrations that have 
paralyzed parts of the capital nearly every day for more than a month. 
After the worst recent clash, on Nov. 13, in which at least nine students 
were killed, the military and the police made elaborate attempts to 
avoid confrontations, sometimes falling back when protesters broke 
through their lines. But some of the more militant students seem bent 
on confrontation, and some members of the security forces seem eager 
to take them on. The students represent many different colleges and 
several student groups. Some have moved from shouting for reform to 
shouting for revolution. But their motivations and demands remain 
unfocused and their protests seem more and more cut off from the concerns 
and mood of the rest of the nation. Some of the protesters, who cruise 
the city in buses, waving flags and dancing on their roofs, seem uncertain 
about just what they really want. Their most common demand is for 
a trial of former President Suharto, who resigned in May, partly as 
a result of pressure from student protests. Since then, the atmosphere 
has grown more unstable as Indonesia moves uncertainly from a period 
of authoritarian rule toward the possibility of a more democratic 
and open system. Speaking to graduates at a military college Thursday, 
Habibie said Indonesia's new freedoms allow for public protests. ``But 
in carrying out these rights people must also respect other people's 
rights,'' he said. ``If the protests are not controlled it can lead 
to the disintegration of the nation,'' he continued. There is a widespread 
expectation here that the protests will subside during the Muslim 
holy month of Ramadan, which begins this weekend. But they are expected 
to resume next year as Indonesia moves toward its first free elections, 
scheduled for June. Even in the tightly controlled system of Suharto, 
the ritualistic elections held every five years, with their foreordained 
outcomes, were accompanied by outbreaks of street violence. Now that 
the government has loosened its grip, almost any grievance can be 
taken to the streets. Hours before the clash outside the Parliament 
building a group of some 200 students held a separate rally near the 
National Monument. Their demand: an end to student protests.
