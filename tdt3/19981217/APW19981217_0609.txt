Malaysia's prime minister said Thursday that senior members of his 
ruling party were advising him to appoint a new deputy before party 
elections next year, a news report said. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad 
said he wanted his United Malays National Organization to decide who 
should be his deputy at the next party election, expected in June 
1999. But, some party members thought the decision should be made 
earlier. ``I wanted to let the party decide in the next party election, 
but certain people including senior members of the party have expressed 
the view that it is too long to wait,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying 
by the Bernama news agency before returning from a trip to Vietnam. 
The 72-year-old prime minister added that certain party members feared 
that ``anything might happen to me.'' The absence of an heir to Mahathir, 
who has been in poor health in recent weeks, has added to the uncertainty 
caused by Malaysia's economic problems. Mahathir has been without 
a successor since he fired Anwar Ibrahim as his deputy on Sept. 2, 
saying Anwar was morally unfit to lead. Anwar, now on trial for abuse 
of power and sexual misconduct, says the charges were fabricated to 
end the political challenge he posed to Mahathir's 17-year rule. Last 
week after a national UMNO convention, Mahathir said he had not yet 
decided on a deputy but that it would be someone he felt would continue 
his policies. Mahathir was in Hanoi for a summit of leaders from the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which ended Wednesday.
