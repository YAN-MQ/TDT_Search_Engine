A top State Department human rights official Thursday pledged strong 
U.S. support for Montenegro, praising the Yugoslav republic's ``fine 
record'' in respecting human rights and democracy. Harold Koh, an 
assistant secretary of state, met Montenegro's reformist president, 
Milo Djukanovic, as part of a tour of Yugoslavia, which will include 
a visit to Serbia's restive Kosovo province on Friday. The Yugoslav 
federation consists of Serbia and much smaller Montenegro. Koh said 
that Montenegro, where opponents of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
took power last year, stands in ``stark contrast'' to Serbia, where 
autocratic Milosevic has full control. Koh visited Belgrade Wednesday. 
``In Belgrade I saw government repression of the media, government 
repression of universities, and deep assault on the institutions of 
civil society,'' Koh said, adding Milosevic's regime shows ``contempt 
for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.'' But Koh praised 
what he called Montenegro's ``fine record on these points,'' adding 
``the U.S. government strongly supports Montengro's steps toward democracy 
and human rights.''
