American reporter Philip True, who disappeared while hiking through 
rugged mountains in western Mexico, was killed by being hit over the 
head and choked, Mexican forensic examiners said Thursday. Earlier 
reports said he had died in an accidental fall. President Ernesto 
Zedillo ordered federal and state authorities to ``spare no resources'' 
in investigating the slaying. Reports from Mexican and U.S. officials 
on Wednesday suggested that True, 50, the Mexico-based correspondent 
for The San Antonio Express-News, had fallen to his death from a cliff 
in the Sierra Madre. But Mario Rivas Souza, the coroner of the state 
of Jalisco, where True was killed, said after studying the autopsy 
results, ``It is a homicide. It is not an accident.'' The autopsy, 
which was performed in Guadalajara, also showed that True had been 
sexually brutalized, forensic experts told Mexican and U.S. officials. 
Justice officials said they were flying the body to Mexico City Thursday 
to perform a second autopsy. True's decomposed remains were discovered 
early Wednesday at the bottom of a ravine. A Huichol Indian resident 
of the barren area led a search party to where he had seen True's 
body days before, by a cliff. The body was no longer there, but a 
trail of blood, apparently from a head wound, and feathers from True's 
sleeping bag, led the searchers to a two-foot-deep grave concealed 
with brush where True was buried. Some of his possessions were missing, 
but he was still wearing his good-quality watch. The autopsy results 
showed True had been dead for about eight days. True, who had been 
a solo hiker since he was a teen-ager, set out on Nov. 28 for a two-week 
trek through the Sierra de los Huicholes, a sparsely populated and 
nearly inaccessible region. The autopsy showed that True was strangled 
with a rope or bandana. The coroner said other bruises were not consistent 
with a fall. True became The Express-News correspondent in Mexico 
City in 1996. Colleagues remembered him as an affable, hard-working 
reporter who reveled in covering the complexities of Mexico. His wife, 
Marta, is five months' pregnant.
