The impeachment debate here in Washington is set to begin tomorrow 
morning at 9:00 A.M. eastern time. You've heard just a couple of minutes 
ago, the latest news about the incoming speaker, Bob Livingston, that 
he may be offering his resignation to his republican colleagues based 
on difficulties, to use a very broad term, in his past. We will keep 
you up to date with everything that goes on. I'm Peter Jennings.
