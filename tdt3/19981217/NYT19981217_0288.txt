Soon after the Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, was captured 
last month in Italy, the leader of the legal Kurdish political party 
said that this was ``an interesting moment'' and might give the Turkish 
government a chance to consider ``a peaceful solution to the conflict.'' 
At other times, such a mild comment might have gone unnoticed. But 
since Ocalan's capture emotions on the Kurdish issue have been running 
higher than usual. The leader of the legal party, Murat Bozlak, was 
arrested and is being held in a Turkish jail. The authorities are 
deciding whether to charge him with subversion. Newspapers and officials 
have waged an intense campaign to convince the world that Ocalan is 
a terrorist whose crimes have no political basis. Rights groups agree 
that he is guilty of what they call ``crimes against humanity.'' Nonetheless 
some prominent Europeans have suggested that Ocalan might be considered 
a political figure. On Wednesday an Italian court released him from 
house arrest, a move that heightened the outrage many Turks are feeling 
toward Europe. The outrage is no longer directed solely at Ocalan 
and members of his Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the PKK. The 
fervor is also aimed at people who are not involved in the war but 
have expressed sympathy for Kurdish aspirations. This month a radio 
station here staged a music festival at which a Kurdish musician had 
been scheduled to appear. The festival hall was on the grounds of 
a military museum, and shortly before it began an officer called the 
organizers and said the Kurdish concert would have to be canceled 
``in view of the present situation.'' One organizer said later that 
if it had not been for the recent capture of Ocalan and the debate 
that it has set off the concert would have probably been allowed to 
proceed. ``The whole climate has undergone quite a change,'' the organizer, 
Omer Madra, said. ``There is a feeling of vengeance, especially among 
the families of people who have died in the conflict. It's vengeance 
in a general sense against the PKK and its sympathizers. But it could 
be turning into a wider sort of anti-Kurdish feeling.'' Among the 
victims of the surge of emotion is Andrew Finkel, a British-born journalist 
who has lived in Turkey for more than 10 years. Finkel is known in 
part for his work as a columnist in Sabah, one of the largest newspapers 
in Turkey. In a column after Ocalan's capture he suggested that the 
14-year war on Kurdish separatists was ``damaging Turkey's own conscience 
and democratic sensibilities.'' ``People disappeared, torture was 
routine, villagers were forced to leave their homes, and an entire 
newspaper office in Istanbul was blown to smithereens,'' he wrote. 
``Winning the war was not easy. Sooner or later someone is going to 
have to win the peace.'' Finkel was dismissed within hours after the 
column had appeared. A columnist in another paper here, Hurriyet, 
then denounced him under the headline ``Ignorant Finkel'' and said, 
``It would be better if Finkel did some research instead of speaking 
and writing so stupidly.'' A Kurdish member of Parliament, Hasim Hasimi, 
said he regretted that free discussion of the Kurdish issue had become 
so difficult. ``In the whole world governments and media are talking 
about Ocalan and the Kurdish problem, but we are not,'' Hasimi said. 
``We can't discuss our own situation. We have a problem and we should 
deal with it in a democratic way. But tension is rising here. We are 
ourselves doing what the PKK has not been able to do in 14 years, 
which is to create conflict within our society.''
