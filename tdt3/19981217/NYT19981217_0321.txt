With bombs falling on Iraq and an impeachment vote nearing in the 
House, Vice President Al Gore has taken an unusually visible role 
in defending President Clinton and the military actions that have 
spurred deep skepticism from many Republicans. Soon after Clinton's 
15-minute address to the American public on Wednesday night, Gore 
appeared on five television networks. Thursday night, aides said, 
he was preparing to appear on several regional networks as well as 
British television. In addition, as one of Clinton's senior advisors 
on matters of national security, the vice president has spent a considerable 
part of the last few days, informing other senior administration officials, 
as well as lawmakers, former Presidents Carter, Ford and Bush and 
foreign leaders of the United States' plans to attack. As one example, 
Gore was directed by the president to convey the U.S. position to 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia. Aides to Gore said their 
20-minute conversation Thursday was the highest level of contact between 
the two countries. Describing Clinton as ``determined and focused 
on winning this confrontation with Iraq,'' the vice president said 
in an interview Thursday in his office in the west wing of the White 
House that he continues to be amazed that some political leaders would 
suggest the administration planned the attack to delay actions against 
the president in Congress. Referring to the secretary of defense and 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gore said: ``Anybody who 
thinks for one minute that Bill Cohen, a former member of the Senate 
Republican caucus, or Hugh Shelton, a four-star general out of the 
Green Beret special forces branch of the Army would sit in these meetings 
and be a party to some politically motivated plan is just crazy. No 
serious person can really look at the facts and come to that conclusion.'' 
At the start of the week, when all hands in Washington expected the 
House to spend Thursday voting on articles of impeachment against 
the president, Gore was scheduled spend the day in New Hampshire, 
appearing on behalf of the administration and his own presidential 
aspirations for 2000. Yet Gore scuttled the trip on Tuesday when he 
said it became apparent that plans for military action against Iraq 
were adding to the building gravity of the week. ``It was obvious 
to me that Thursday was going to be a day when I was needed here at 
the White House to help the president, first of all, to try to help 
persuade the Congress to take a bipartisan approach to the impeachment 
controversy,'' Gore said. He added: ``But also, although I did not 
discuss this with my advisors, I knew from national security meetings 
there would be other matters to help the president with this day.'' 
Gore said he continued to hope the House would reach a ``bipartisan 
compromise solution to forestall an impeachment. But he declined to 
predict how an impeachment vote might carry in the House nor how the 
president might fare in a Senate trial. ``I don't want to engage in 
a hypothetical discussion that assumes the House will make the mistake 
of voting for an impeachment resolution,'' he said.
