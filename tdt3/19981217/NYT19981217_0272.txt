On a day when everyone in Washington seemed to have a beef, Karen 
Dolan had two. Standing at a rally outside the Capitol Thursday morning, 
Ms. Dolan held two signs aloft. ``Stop the Impeachment!'' read one. 
``Stop the Bombing!'' urged the other. ``I'm not a supporter of Clinton. 
I'm an independent, though I prefer Clinton over a Republican,'' said 
Ms. Dolan, a project director at the Institute for Policy Studies, 
a liberal research and advocacy organization in Washington. ``But 
what upsets me is the way that the Constitution and the will of the 
people are being disregarded. ``I think the same thing about the bombing 
of Iraq. It was done unilaterally, without the mandate of the Security 
Council. So I think both the bombing and the impeachment process are 
illegal.'' A crowd of about 3,000 people rallied outside the Capitol 
Thursday, demanding that the House halt its effort to impeach President 
Clinton. But with the twin issues of war and impeachment consuming 
Washington, many at this overwhelmingly liberal gathering found themselves 
often criticizing the same man they were staunchly defending. ``You 
can't justify impeachment on what most people consider kind of superfluous 
charges _ lying about a sexual relationship,'' said Omar Abdul of 
Washington as he stood near the speakers' platform on the east side 
of the Capitol. ``But the bombing of a country is a serious matter 
and generally the people who suffer are civilians.'' Across the country, 
other Democratic liberals were facing their own clash of values and 
trying to figure out which was worse, war or impeachment. While hundreds 
of people gathered in downtown San Francisco Wednesday night for an 
anti-impeachment rally sponsored by San Francisco's political and 
religious leaders, several hundred others were gathering several blocks 
away for a rally against the bombing. ``I think the bombing sort of 
dampens our feelings, but we have to concentrate on the impeachment,'' 
said Jane Morrison, a member of a Democratic committee that conducts 
campaigns for various nominees in local, state and national elections. 
``We have to concentrate on letting the Republicans know that they 
will pay if they disregard the will of the people.'' To be sure, the 
Washington rally, organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a coalition 
of trade unions, women's groups and other liberal organizations, featured 
a host of speakers who sharply criticized Republicans for moving toward 
impeachment. ``This is clinical,'' Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the 
ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said of the House 
Republicans' desire to impeach the president. ``It's pathological 
because they don't even care that they're going to pay a price in 
2,000. Their hatred is complete and they are consumed by it.'' Yet, 
the gathering also pointed out Clinton's shaky relationship with his 
own party's left wing. Having disagreed with the president on issues 
like welfare reform, crime policy, the North American Free Trade Agreement 
and military actions in the Persian Gulf, many on the left of the 
party are now finding themselves in the uncomfortable position of 
defending him. ``The right looks at Clinton and they see us,'' said 
Robert Borosage, a fellow with the Institute for Policy Studies and 
an adviser to Jackson during his 1988 presidential campaign. ``They 
see anti-war, gay rights, pro-choice, civil rights. But when we look 
at him, we don't see us at all. ``But,'' Borosage added, ``we can't 
let the right wing win. He' ain't much. But he's all we got.''
