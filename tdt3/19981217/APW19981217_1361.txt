Kosovo Albanian rebels denied responsibility Thursday for the Pec 
shootings that have enraged Serbs across the province, and promised 
retaliation on Serb forces for the border killings of 36 guerrillas. 
The Kosovo Liberation Army, which Serb authorities blame for the slayings 
of six young Serbs in a bar in western Kosovo on Monday, made the 
remarks in a statement issued to ethnic Albanian media. The KLA, it 
said, has not committed or in any way abetted ``the miserable murders 
of Serb youths in a Pec cafe. We are convinced that this is the act 
of Serb secret police in order to further strain relations between 
Serbs and Albanians.'' ``The murders of more than 30 of our soldiers 
and commanders will not induce us to take revenge on the civilian 
population _ we shall take revenge on the Serb police and the military,'' 
it said. In their statement, the rebels also said the Serbs have not 
abided by an October peace agreement and the KLA has suffered more 
casualties during the last two months than during more than seven 
months of fighting. ``This leads us to seriously question our restraint 
so far,'' it said.
