Here now is the latest on the military operation in Iraq. As we reported, 
yet another wave of cruise missiles has entered Baghdad air space 
within the past hour tonight. Today, U.S. defense officials at the 
Pentagon tallied the damage from the opening attack Wednesday night. 
Joint chiefs chairman general Shelton said sea-launched tomahawk cruise 
missiles hit some key Iraqi command structures. Also today the House 
of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a resolution supporting American 
forces in the gulf while debating the merits of the operation and 
not necessarily supporting the president.
