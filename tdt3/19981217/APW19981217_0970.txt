Norway is dropping a blanket asylum granted all Bosnian refugees because 
conditions in their homeland no longer warrant special protection, 
the justice ministry announced Thursday. During the 1992-95 war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Norway decided to accept all Bosnians who came 
to the country directly from the war zone, without the usual case-by-case 
assessment. The ministry said the change will not affect Bosnians 
granted residence permits by Dec. 31. However, after Jan. 1, Bosnians 
will have to meet the same requirement as other foreigners applying 
for work and residence permits.
