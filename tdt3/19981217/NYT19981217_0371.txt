Amid the many voices skeptical about the timing of the air strikes 
against Iraq, few were blunter or quicker on the draw than that of 
Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Rules Committee 
and the representative from this gentle land of horse farms and mineral 
spas. ``Never underestimate a desperate president,'' he declared, 
as cruise missiles began to rain on Baghdad. ``It is obvious he is 
doing it for political reasons.'' But as snow drizzled on the largely 
Republican Hudson Valley Thursday, Solomon's constituents had an equally 
chilly reaction to his claim. The combination of a reservoir of affection 
for the president and an instinctive protectiveness for the nation's 
young fighters seems to have put American cynicism at least temporarily 
on hold. ``Saddam's been warned and warned, and that's been going 
on a lot longer than impeachment,'' said Kevin Clark, 30, a mail processor. 
``Clinton's had so much controversy that he's had to learn to just 
push on with his job, and that's what he's doing now.'' Doris Howe, 
a retired candle-company worker who was folding bedding at a coin 
laundry, said, ``It's the first thing that comes into people's minds, 
but you have to stop and think.'' She went on say that the president 
could not ignore the national interests involved in Iraq just because 
of his problems back home. Solomon is leaving Congress at the end 
of the year, so he may have felt free to speak more frankly than some 
of his colleagues. But he was by no means alone among high-profile 
conservatives in charging that there was no coincidence in Clinton's 
decision to bomb Baghdad on the eve of an impeachment vote. On Thursday, 
several leading conservatives were amplifying the charge, including 
Rush Limbaugh, who said on his radio show that although he hated what 
he was saying and hated what he was thinking, the military option 
``has been a card in the back pocket waiting to be played at the right 
time.'' But in Saratoga Springs, that thinking was dismissed as overly 
harsh and even dangerous. James Weingartner, a sales consultant who 
was warming up with a big bowl of navy-bean soup at the Spa City Diner, 
has voted for Solomon in the past but said he looked ``like a little 
kid stomping his feet'' when he was talking about the bombing. ``Our 
kids are over in the gulf,'' said Weingartner, who is 49. ``If we 
can't stand behind our president when we're at war, when can we?'' 
At the counter, Roger Gaynor, a 77-year-old who served in World War 
II, said that to accept the position that it was all politics would 
be to accuse the entire chain of command of collusion. ``It's a cheap 
shot at the military,'' he said. Gaynor said he always had supported 
Solomon, but said now he wouldn't ``give him the dogcatcher's vote.'' 
However much they might disagree with Solomon's remarks, few people 
here seemed to be surprised by them. Solomon, an insurance-agency 
founder who rose to become New York's most influential member of the 
House, has been a persistent critic of the president's. He has championed 
such conservative causes as a constitutional amendment that allowed 
the states to make it a crime to desecrate the American flag. His 
district, New York's 22nd, stretches from Dutchess County through 
Albany's suburbs and north to Lake Placid in the Adirondacks. It has 
been heavily Republican since the late 19th century and was reliably 
conservative when Solomon was first elected in 1978. The views of 
voters there have become more moderate since then, and the district 
backed Clinton in 1996 after overwhelmingly rejecting him in 1992. 
Solomon's successor, John Sweeney, is a Republican who is viewed as 
more moderate; but Sweeney said he did not disagree with Solomon's 
take on the timing of the air strikes. ``He said publicly what a lot 
of people say privately,'' Sweeney said. ``This just shows how much 
Bill Clinton has undermined the credibility of the presidency.'' Some 
of the criticism of Solomon was predictable. Ken Klotz, a college 
administrator who is chairman of the Saratoga Springs Democratic Committee, 
said the comments ``undermine the credibility of the nation at a time 
of high risk.'' But listen to John Nolan, the Saratoga County Republican 
chairman, who said most party members in the area believe the bombing 
was necessary. ``We are loyal and supportive of our president when 
our friends and neighbors are in jeopardy,'' he said. ``Saddam Hussein 
has thumbed his nose at us one too many times.'' On the streets of 
Saratoga Springs, which locals call the home of ``health, horses and 
history,'' it was tough to find anyone who embraced Solomon's viewpoint. 
``I think he got a little hot under the collar, and his mouth was 
moving a little faster than his brain,'' said Jim Karge, a librarian 
at the Sarasota Springs Public Library. Gregg Abrams, 32, an investment 
adviser, said he doubted that the bombing was a political plot, but 
said he could understand why that view was likely to get plenty of 
attention in the days to come. ``Mr. Solomon has a record of being 
very sincere,'' Abrams said. ``President Clinton doesn't have sincerity 
on his side.''
