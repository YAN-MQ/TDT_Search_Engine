To appreciate the subtle tension underlying the arrival of Johnathan 
Lee Iverson at Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus, it helps 
to know something of the insular little world of the Circus Winter 
Quarters in this sun-bleached vacationland by the bay. It was here 
that an exotic assembly of been-there-done-that circus aristocrats 
gathered in early December to create a $12 million extravaganza, the 
129th edition of the Greatest Show on Earth. The performance-hardened 
group of aerialists, wire walkers, acrobats and tiger trainers _ many 
of them from multigenerational performing families _ are, like all 
elite circus people, grudging in their approval of newcomers. Iverson 
had no circus pedigree. He grew up in New York, the son of a postal 
worker and a firefighter, and had seen the Ringling circus only a 
few times in his life. And now, at the age of 22, he would become 
the youngest ringmaster in Ringling history. When it was time for 
his in-house debut, Iverson stepped to the ringmaster's platform, 
virtually unnoticed amid the hurly-burly of the rehearsal arena. On 
cue, he sang for the first time. And cast members did what they rarely 
do: They stopped to listen to the lyric tenor voice issuing from the 
6-foot-3-inch, 215-pound singing ringmaster. And when Iverson finished 
his opening number, the performers did what they never do. They applauded. 
``It really didn't matter what Johnathan had done up to then,'' said 
Kenneth Feld, Ringling's producer and chief executive. ``The voice 
was all.'' For Iverson, whose voice was molded at the age of 11 in 
the famously rigorous Boys Choir of Harlem, and then refined at the 
Fiorello H. La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing 
Arts in New York, it was a gratifying moment. In addition to being 
the youngest ringmaster in Ringling's history, Iverson also happens 
to be its first black ringmaster. But this fact was pretty much ignored 
by the 222-member cast and crew, which is about as multinational, 
multicultural, multiethnic and multiracial a work force as can be 
encountered. ``I don't want my race to be the focus of attention, 
but the truth is that we are not a nation of the color-blind,'' Iverson 
said during an afternoon rehearsal session in the Florida State Fair 
Expo Hall and Arena. ``Race still matters, and I suppose it raises 
the pressure about something that will be viewed as historic.'' Feld 
insists that making a great circus, not history, was the only reason 
for selecting Iverson. ``We hired the most talented performer, and 
skin color had absolutely nothing to do with it,'' Feld said. ``That 
said, I suppose his selection as ringmaster is a symbolic moment for 
the Ringling circus. He is the ringmaster for today.'' According to 
officials of the circus, Iverson is the 31st person to be designated 
ringmaster since the merger of the Barnum and Ringling circuses in 
1919. Historically, the ringmaster has been not only the lord of the 
ring for ladies, gentlemen and children of all ages, but also the 
focus of their attention during the performance. It will be Iverson's 
task to announce each act and control the pacing of the show. He will 
sing four songs. He must also become adept at the impromptu segue, 
to cover animal and human glitches. And it will be Iverson's urgent 
duty to reassure the crowd and send in the clowns when there is a 
fall or an injury. ``The ringmaster takes full command of the temple 
of the show,'' said Greg Parkinson, a circus historian who is the 
executive director of the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis. ``So 
for Ringling, naming the first black ringmaster is very significant 
socially and culturally.'' Indeed, Ringling ``was pretty much a segregated 
show when my father bought the circus in 1967,'' said Feld, 50. His 
father, Irvin, who died in 1984, made his considerable fortune as 
a producer by touring black performers in the 1950s and '60s including 
Chuck Berry, Fats Domino and Harry Belafonte. ``The first thing my 
father did was to put a black act, the King Charles Troupe, in both 
Ringling units. ``So the circus people had to deal with the idea that 
a Jewish owner had taken over what was then an anti-Semitic organization,'' 
Feld said, ``and had to face the fact that this new owner was bringing 
black performers into the show. We had people leave the circus because 
blacks were traveling on the circus train.'' After the public has 
its first chance to see the show in Tampa, on Christmas Day, Iverson 
will preside over the Red Unit, one of the two Ringling traveling 
circuses in the United States. The show will migrate northward, landing 
on March 26 at Madison Square Garden in New York, the traditional 
opening-night venue for Big Bertha, as the performers call the Ringling 
show. If to many Iverson will be a living symbol in a shiny top hat 
and spangled tail coat, he sees himself as ``one piece of the puzzle,'' 
which includes 132 performers, 90 crew members and 217 animals. Iverson's 
mother, Sylvia, a secretary for 26 years in the Postal Service's mail-processing 
plant in New York who raised Johnathan alone, said she long expected 
to see her son on stage in something as grand as this. ``He was on, 
from the earliest age,'' Ms. Iverson said, adding that ``he'd say, 
`Mommy, I've got to perform.''' His training ground was the Boys Choir, 
which each year auditions about 1,500 children who hope to be among 
the 100 accepted into the Choir Academy of Harlem, a public school. 
Iverson was 11 when he passed the audition for the choir, which has 
long served as an urban lifeboat for its young members, about 75 percent 
of whom come from single-parent households headed by women, many with 
incomes below the poverty level. He went on to La Guardia, and then 
won scholarships for voice training at the Hartt School of Music in 
Connecticut, where he received a Bachelor of Music degree in May. 
Becoming a ringmaster was far from his career objective. But during 
the summer he landed a role in ``The Fireside Christmas Show,'' directed 
by Phil McKinley at a dinner theater in Fort Atkinson, Wis. McKinley 
happened to be the director of the 128th Ringling show and told Iverson 
about the ringmaster audition. Thirty performers threw their hats 
into the ring. ``There was no question when we saw Johnathan that 
he was the one,'' Feld said. ``It was his presence and his phenomenal 
voice.'' Iverson's youth, his size and his voice training should serve 
him well, other ringmasters said. Vocally and physically, ``the ringmaster 
role is very difficult, because for two and a half hours you never 
leave the floor,'' said Jim Ragona, a k a the Voice, who for 13 years 
has been the ringmaster of Ringling's Blue Unit, the circus's other 
touring show. ``For my first six months in the job,'' he said, ``it 
was so physically draining that after the performance I'd go home 
and fall in bed fully clothed, and sleep until it was time to do the 
show again.'' So far, Iverson relishes his work. ``They spoil the 
ringmaster; I won't lie,'' he said, explaining that Ringling's costume 
director has made three magnificent ringmaster suits for him, and 
has custom made all his ringmaster boots. ``It's like I'm in the NBA,'' 
he said, smiling. ``But the clothes don't make the ringmaster,'' Ragona 
said. His advice to Iverson would be to avoid ``performing an imitation 
of some ringmaster character that isn't him.'' ``His task,'' Ragona 
said, ``is to find the ringmaster named Johnathan.''
