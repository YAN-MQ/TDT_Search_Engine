Made with the tasty, crispy crunch... of French's French fried onions, 
it'll disappear as quickly as the holidays. Life's an adventure! Because 
you're over 50 and still exploring! So take the centrum made just 
for you. Centrum silver. With age-essential nutrients... specially 
adjusted to keep pace with your changing nutritional needs. Centrum 
silver: Fibercon or metamucil? Both have fiber for regularity. But 
I like Fibercon better. Same natural action of fiber, and with Fibercon, 
I get my fiber in two caplets.
