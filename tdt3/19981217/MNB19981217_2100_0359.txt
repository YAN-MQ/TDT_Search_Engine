The main story continues to be in Baghdad, where the air campaign 
against iraq continues this evening, and for the latest, let's go 
to Kevin Tibbles at the ministry of information building there. Kevin? 
Good morning to you, Brian. Good evening where you are. Listen, they 
have said all along that this was going to be a sustained attack against 
Iraq. It started last night, continued on into this evening. Something 
different happened here, and that was there seem to have been two 
separate missile launches against Iraq. One happened sometime around 
11:00 this evening, and then just about an hour ago, the air raid 
sirens went off, and we heard about a dozen or so loud thuds, which 
we assume are cruise missiles slamming into their targets on the ground. 
It's an incredible concussion when they hit, and it has been a night 
of explosion after explokes. Ground zero Baghdad, the city shaken. 
Wave after wave of warheads slam Iraq. Also targeted, Saddam Hussein's 
palaces, military depots, and the Iraqi foreign ministry, the barrage 
lighting up the sky. Tonight the city hospitals treating the wounded. 
Medical supplies are short. The Iraqis say 25 have been killed during 
the attacks, mostly civilians. They call it "operation desert fox." 
In fact, it is operation villainsn the Arabian desert. Saddam Hussein 
is staying out of sight and on the move. Iraqi television reporting 
today he toured the destruction of yesterday's attacks, including 
the home of his daughter. But no pictures of the leader. It was a 
surreal scene here today. Some Iraqis inspecting damage to their neighborhoods 
while others went about everyday life, to work, to school, no signsover 
panic, hoarding, or gas lines. There is nothing to scare about. In 
fact, tonight, Thursday night, the traditional day for weddings, a 
Couple separating a new beginning, but within minutes a fresh wave 
of cruise missiles shattered the night, everyone running for cover 
wating for the next round. And what is unclear of course now, Brian, 
is when is the next round going to come? Have we had it in the past 
hour, or is there more on the way prior to sun-up, which will be in 
about a half-hour to 45 minutes? I should also say the morning prayers 
at the mosque behind me will probably begin in the next few minutes 
again. Thank you. I know the air sirens have sounded there. We'll 
join you live later. ok.
