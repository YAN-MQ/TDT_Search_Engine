Czech car maker Skoda and Russian government officials signed an agreement 
Thursday to set up a Skoda-controlled car assembly facility in Russia. 
Some details of the deal have yet to be worked out, including breaks 
for Skoda on taxes and customs duties. Skoda Chairman Vratislav Kulhanek 
told a news conference in Moscow that the company hoped to sign a 
final agreement by next May, and produce 5,000 cars next year. The 
plant will be based in the city of Izhevsk, 1,350 kilometers (810 
miles) east of Moscow, and the Russian state-controlled Izhmash Holding 
will hold a minority stake. Izhmash used to be Russia's major manufacturer 
of light army vehicles, motorcycles and other defense-related products. 
Thursday's agreement was signed by Czech Vice Premier Pavel Mertlik 
and Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov. Skoda, majority-owned 
by the German auto maker Volkswagen, will invest about dlrs 300 million 
in the Izhevsk plant with a capacity of 80,000 cars a year by 2004, 
Kulhanek said. Skoda officials declined to elaborate on the tax and 
customs duties concessions they are seeking. President Boris Yeltsin 
signed a decree this spring which allows foreign companies to import 
parts, equipment and finished vehicles duty-free for a limited period, 
provided they invest dlrs 250 million in Russia over five years.
