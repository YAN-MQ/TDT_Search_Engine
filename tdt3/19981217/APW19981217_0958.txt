Three Serb officers sought by a U.N. war crimes tribunal appeared 
as witnesses at a Yugoslav military probe into alleged 1991 war crimes, 
in defiance of international demands to hand over the case and the 
suspects to The Hague court. Two representatives of the U.N. tribunal 
also attended the hearings in the Belgrade Military Court, according 
to a statement from the court carried by the official Tanjug news 
agency. The statement added that Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic 
and Milan Mrksic, accused of ordering the 1991 massacre of 261 Croats 
taken out of a hospital in Vukovar in eastern Croatia, ``testified 
as witnesses.'' The statement further said that in their testimonies 
the three responded to allegations from the Hague indictment. The 
Belgrade military court said the proceedings will continue. ``I have 
no comment at all about this proceedings,'' declared The Hague court 
investigator Denis Milner as he came out of the military court building. 
The move by the Belgrade government, loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, has been criticized by The Hague tribunal and the West. 
Yugoslavia refuses to extradite its citizens accused of war crimes 
citing the country's constitution which bars extradition. Defying 
international pressure the military court held its own probe against 
``unknown persons'' involved in the Vukovar massacre. One of the officers, 
Veselin Sljivancanin, told Belgrade daily ``Glas'' Thursday that ``I 
have nothing to be ashamed of as I did my officer's duty honorably 
in Vukovar.'' ``I recognize only my own state, our courts and the 
judgment of my people,'' said Sljivancanin. ``For me, any foreign 
court does not exist.'' Earlier this month, chief prosecutor Louise 
Arbour accused Belgrade of setting up show proceedings to prevent 
the three from being extradited for trial before the U.N. court in 
The Hague. At her request, tribunal judges ordered Yugoslav authorities 
to halt their investigation and send any evidence they have against 
the officers to The Hague along with the officers. Under international 
law, the tribunal has the power to take over cases from domestic courts. 
National governments are obliged to cooperate with such requests within 
60 days. Most of the suspects sought by the tribunal in connection 
with alleged war crimes committed during the Croatian and Bosnian 
wars are Serbs. But the key suspects are not in custody due to Bosnian 
Serb and Yugoslav refusal to cooperate with the tribunal. Serb-led 
Yugoslavia, now consisting of Serbia and much smaller Montenegro, 
faces further international isolation over its defiance concerning 
the Hague court.
