Operations are under way in the gulf tonight. We'll be joined by telephone 
by the C.O. of the carrier enterprise. Okay, you probably think they 
look alike. But with gateway you get basic help over the phone for 
as long as you own it. After a month, you pay for it. Here, you get 
a color printer. Nope, not here. This one you can trade in toward 
the purchase of a new one after two years. Yours forever. Still think 
they look alike? We'll build you a PC like this one for $1,598 or 
$45 a month. Call gateway about guaranteed Christmas delivery.
