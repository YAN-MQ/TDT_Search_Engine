A final note now, radio stations in the Arab world today are face 
with a problem. The World's Marco Wordman have been listening to the 
musical choices of one DJ. Up until yesterday, Nancy Atala, a Palestinian 
DJ with Radio Bethlehem 2000, was spinning Christmas tunes, but all 
that's changed. As a Palestinian Christian living in the West Bank, 
DJ Nancy Atala has often been in situations in which the choice of 
music becomes a diplomatic decision. It's very normal when you have 
events like this to feel with the people around us whether it's in 
Iraq, or in Jordan, or in anyplace. You play music by the even that 
is happening. So, what's happening in Iraq I've determined that you 
have music for, so we play, we play like maybe half a day with these 
songs. I did not program. Also, to put people at ease a little bit 
and to relax instead of having this gloomy and terrible atmosphere 
around us. Nancy Atala works as a hospital administrator by day and 
she says patients seem to be responding to the music of Iraqi Singer 
Kasa em Salher. This is one of the more upbeat songs written by Kasa 
em Salher. It's in stark contrast to the track that Nancy Atala has 
been playing on Radio Bethlehem 2000 in the past 24 hours. That song 
is a mournful composition em Salher wrote after seeing the bodies 
of children killed in the Gulf War. When you year like joyful songs, 
you feel like you're listening to a joyful song and at the same time 
you feel like people are suffering, they are dying. They don't even 
have food to eat. So, you feel guilty. For The World, this Marco Wordman.
