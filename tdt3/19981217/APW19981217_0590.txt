The Chilean government said Thursday it will support Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet in the new hearing he won Thursday from the British House 
of Lords in his efforts to fight extradition to Spain. But, Foreign 
Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said, the government will not claim that 
Pinochet has full immunity for his acts as a chief of state, as his 
lawyers insisted during the first trial. At that time, the Lords voted 
3-2 against Pinochet, saying that Spain could try to extradite him 
for trial on genocide and torture charges. ``We didn't like'' that 
strategy, Insulza said. ``We will not claim a legitimacy to commit 
crimes, but will say which court we think is the one that has jurisdiction 
to try this case.'' The government has denied the jurisdiction of 
any foreign court to try a Chilean citizen for crimes committed in 
Chile. On Thursday, the House of Lords set aside its Nov. 25 ruling 
that Pinochet has no immunity from arrest and granted him a new hearing 
because one of the voting lords, Leonard Hoffman, has ties to Amnesty 
International, the human rights group. The unprecedented decision 
means that the 83-year-old former dictator will have a new hearing 
next month before a different panel of judges. Pinochet was arrested 
Oct. 16 in London while recovering from back surgery on a warrant 
from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who charged him with genocide 
and torture. According to an official report by the civilian government 
that succeeded Pinochet's in 1990, more than 3,000 people were killed 
or disappeared during his dictatorship. Insulza refused to elaborate 
on the possibility of Pinochet getting a different ruling from the 
Lords, because ``this entire case has been full of surprises, beginning 
with the arrest itself.'' The Speaker of the House, Gutenberg Martinez, 
said, ``This is starting to look like a legal or judicial soap opera. 
But the ruling appears reasonable. The lord should have excluded himself. 
``The most important thing now would for this situation to end once 
and for all, within a framework of respect for international law, 
so we can recover normalcy and tranquility in our country.'' Speaking 
from Madrid, the second leg of a European tour to explain Chile's 
position, Senate President Andres Zaldivar said the new ruling ``may 
open the door for a way out of this crisis.'' At the Pinochet Foundation, 
a private group of Pinochet loyalists, the news triggered ``a wave 
of optimism and renewed faith,'' said its director, retired Gen. Luyis 
Cortes. ``This is a great step forward in the difficult road.'' Cortes 
phoned Pinochet's house in London and was told that ``the general 
was extremely happy, sharing the moment with his wife and a number 
of visitors.''
