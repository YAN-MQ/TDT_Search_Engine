Britain's highest court has ordered a new appeal hearing for Chilean 
dictator augusto Pinochet. The law lords set aside a previous ruling 
after finding out one of the lords has close ties to amnesty international, 
which has lobbied to bring pinochet to trial. A new hearing is set 
for next month to determine whether Pinochet enjoys diplomatic immunity 
as a former head of state.
