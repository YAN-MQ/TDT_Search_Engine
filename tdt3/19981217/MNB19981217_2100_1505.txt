I will remember you will you remember me in December, every minute 
you talk on AT&T will mean an AT&T donation don't let your life to 
the American red cross. The more calls you make, pass you by... the 
more help we can give. And I will remember you this year, why not 
reach out to everyone you love, so we can all reach out to those who 
need it most. Will you remember me Teddy gibbs can't let a sore throat 
stop him. Even when it feels this raw. He toughs it out through the 
hacking cough... the aches, the fever but when the job is done he's 
desperate... ...for fast, powerful theraflu relief. With the first 
sip of that soothing, lemony hot liquid he feels comfort instantly. 
Soon, his throat feels calmed his cough quieted. Maximum strength 
theraflu. Now in new cherry sore throat and cough. Instant comfort. 
Powerful relief.
