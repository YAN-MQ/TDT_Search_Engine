Just how big is the furby craze? Hundreds of people at a toy store 
in Santa Monica, California, stood in line for up to seven hours, 
to buy one of the 750 furbys in stock. They were gone in a few hours. 
The fur was flying, literally, in San Antonio, Texas. A local radio 
station blew-up a furby doll, as part of a publicity stunt. The staffers 
behind the stunt said the furby craze had driven them into action.
