c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry predicted 
Thursday that he would report to spring training on time with the 
Yankees in March, even though he must receive chemotherapy treatment 
at least once a week until April after undergoing colon cancer surgery 
two and a half months ago. ``By then, everything will be back to normal 
and people will wonder if I ever had cancer,'' Strawberry said. ``People 
are saying that to me now when they see me.'' Speaking in a conference 
call, Strawberry said he has had no significant side effects from 
the chemotherapy treatments, which he started by taking five in one 
week in November, and added that he has gained 25 pounds to increase 
his weight to 210. The 36-year-old outfielder and designated hitter, 
whose playing weight is 215, said he lifts weights five days a week 
with a trainer to restore the strength he lost before and after surgery. 
Though doctors learned that the cancer had spread to one of the 36 
lymph nodes that were removed during the surgery, Strawberry said 
that he has not undergone any tests since to determine if the cancer 
has spread. He said he would meet with doctors in New York next month. 
In case he is not fully cleared to play by opening day and in order 
for his $2.5 million contract for next season not to count on the 
Yankee payroll, Strawberry will agree to a minor league contract next 
week. Strawberry and his wife, Charisse, have contributed a design 
to the V Foundation for Cancer Research. It will be used in a tie 
as part of the Jimmy Valvano neckwear collection. ``I never could 
have imagined I would be where I am today when I look back at October,'' 
Strawberry said.
