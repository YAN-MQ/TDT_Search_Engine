Let's see how good this connection is tonight. We are joined from 
a long way away by the commanding officer of the carrier enterprise, 
captain Marty chaneck. Can you hear me? I sure can, loud and clear. 
Can you hear me? Yes, sir, I can. Are all your aircraft back for now? 
We are recovering our last 15 or so aircraft here in about 30 minutes. 
Does that mean that, for the daylight hours, at least, and as far 
as the enterprise is concerned, at least, that offensive, that is, 
firing operations, are over for now while people take pictures of 
the battlefield? Well, Brian, we certainly will have break periods. 
We don't -- we like to stay away from talking about future operations 
because that's obviously -- obviously affects our security on that. 
But we will have breaks here and there as we recover our aircraft 
and as we get some needed rest. So, it's a cyclic -- cycle that goes 
on and has some pauses and starts. Now, captain, has -- as the pilots 
come back and get a debrief, how aggressive are they saying the anti-aircraft 
fire is? Well, most of the debriefs have been indicating that it's 
been fairly light. They've been out there. They've had it. But overall, 
if I had to quantify, I think you could say it was fairly light. Anybody 
receive so much as a Ding? No, sir. We have not had a problem with 
that yet, and that's the way we intend to keep it. ok. One last question. 
As we look at the deck of your carrier on the air, how big a surface 
area are we talking about? The U.S.S. enterprise has about 4 1/2 acres 
of flight deck area, although when you put all those aircraft on it, 
it looks an awful lot smaller. A lot of runway floating on the water. 
It's called the big E for a good reason. Captain, thanks for joining 
us this evening. My pleasure, Brian. Thank you.
