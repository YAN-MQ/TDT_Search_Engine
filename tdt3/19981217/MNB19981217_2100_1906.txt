We are continuing our conversation with Virginia republican senator 
John warner. Senator, you just informed me that you had just spoken 
to the Pentagon before coming to the studio. What have you learned 
about what's in progress tonight? On two occasions today, this morning 
and this afternoon, I was with the secretary of defense and the chairman 
of joint chiefs, and I telephoned over to the command just moments 
ago and was greatly relieved to learn that the current strike in progress 
is going on as scheduled and thus far, the airmen have returned safely. 
John Warner and Bill Cohen served together in the U.S. Senate. For 
18 years we sat side by side. He's now with the democrats, of course. 
He is is defense secretary. When he looks you in the eye and tells 
you no politics played a role in the scheduling of this, do you believe 
him? Two nights we sat together in the secretary of defense's office. 
We talked on that very point. I expressed to him my concerns. And 
he said to me directly, "I stake my reputation on the fact that the 
United States has been ready to have this strike for some several 
weeks and that all the reasons for doing it have come to this point 
in time, and we should go ahead with it." And he counseled with the 
president the next morning. And I -- I believe Bill Cohen. I know 
that man very, very well. Your republican leader, Trent Lott, might 
have made a tactical error yesterday when he did not come out full 
square in support of this air strike. He questioned at minimum the 
timing of it. Well, that's a concern as leader perhaps he felt obligated 
to talk about. But he also expressed himself today very clearly, reinforcing 
what he'd said previously the night before that he supports the men 
and women of the armed forces and he has compassion for their families 
who are going through a certain amount of stress until this operation 
is completed. Senatorohn Warner of Virginia. Thank you very much. 
The chairman-elect, by the way, of the Senate armed services committee. 
Thanks. Thanks.
