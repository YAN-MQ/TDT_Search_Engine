If you're flying somewhere during the holidays, a little extra care 
in packing your carry-ons could prevent problems at boarding time. 
Kalin Thomas-Samuel has the story. I can't carry it on? no. Tightened 
carry-on rules, mean many travelers can't take gifts and extra baggage 
on the plane. We encourage people to mail their gifts. It does ensure 
that they're going to get there in advance of the holidays. It does 
avoid problems at the airport with security. You can usually find 
a post office at the airport and most have extended hours for the 
holidays. We will be open late on Christmas eve as well. And one thing 
I might also add is that the post office will be delivering on Christmas 
day. For last-minute shoppers, the post office also provides boxes, 
tape, and other tools, to help you wrap your packages. And don't forget 
to put an extra address label inside the package. But if you must 
carry on those precious gifts, many airports have wrapping services 
where you can buy tote boxes that meet carry-on requirements. At Atlanta's 
airport, wrap-A-bag's carry-on tote box is one of the best selling 
items. The main thing is if you have too many pieces, and you don't 
have a Carry-on, you can take a few items out of your bags and put 
them in the carry-on. Well, it's been extremely convenient, because 
the only thing I had to go with right now is a garbage can, I mean, 
a garbage bag, and the airlines weren't willing to accept it, so this 
is definitely the way to go. Helping to keep holiday carry-ons from 
being grounded. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, CNN, Atlanta.
