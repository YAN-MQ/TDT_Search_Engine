I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Cold temperatures today through the northern Rockies and back through 
the northern Great Lakes, especially with highs into the teens. And 
just a sign of things to come, some colder weather will be filtering 
in as we head on into the weekend. The forecast shows the cold front 
dropping through the northern Rockies in the upper midwest. That's 
just one in a series of fronts that will bring much colder air in. 
Looking for high pressure and fair weather to continue, parts of the 
east after some snow this morning and during the day in parts of the 
northeast. That will be moving back into eastern Canada, as we head 
for the daytime hours tomorrow. We take a look now at the extended 
forecast, it is looking quite cold back through much of the northern 
Rockies during the day, on Saturday with highs below zero. Some showers 
are possible in the southern Mississippi river valley and snow through 
the Great Lakes, both Saturday on into Sunday, as very cold air filters 
in to Montana. Minus 10 for high temperatures. Colder air will be 
heading eastward. As we head on into Monday, snow showers continuing 
back through much of the Great Lakes. For even more weather information,
