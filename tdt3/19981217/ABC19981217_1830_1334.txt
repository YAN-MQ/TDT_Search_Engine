We are joined tonight on the impeachment watch by our political analysts, 
cokie Roberts, George Stephanopoulos and Bill kristol. Cokie, let 
me ask you first a little bit of the steam appears to have gone out 
of this debate tomorrow even before it take place. Partly, I think, 
Peter, because people think the votes are now counted and that the 
president, according to everyone who's counted so far, will be impeached. 
But it's also true that there's been bickering between the parties 
and the house, having to do with coming to the floor while the air 
strikes are going on over Iraq. And so that it will be a complicated 
day tomorrow as the republicans bring the impeachment matter to the 
floor and democrats fight even having a Debate on it tomorrow. George 
Stephanopoulos, when we were talking a little bit earlier today, you 
were talking about how the republicans and the democrats appear to 
have changed positions a little bit. That's right, Peter. The democrats 
do know they'll lose the vote tomorrow. But what they'll do is try 
to win the spin. They're already saying this is a Lame duck Congress. 
Now they'll add an argument, that the republicans are being unpat 
rotic. And Bill kristol, do you think we'll be looking at tomorrow 
a debate which is really about post peex, not about impeachment at 
all? Yeah. I certainly think the democrats are trying to lay the ground 
work for saying this has been a partisan ill legitimate impeachment 
of the president, lay the ground work for appealing to senators to 
end this before it begins in the Senate. Republicans will be trying 
to make the case over and over again. Look, we're indicating the rule 
of law and impeaching the president who lied under oath. We're going 
ahead in an orderly way here, despite the fact that our troops are 
engaged. It Shun the deter us, it should encourage us to abide by 
our constitutional processes.
