Gabriel Batistuta has announced he will stay with Italian League leader 
Fiorentina through 2003. ``Italy's is the most important league in 
the world,'' the Argentine star told reporters Wednesday night, ``and 
I really enjoy playing in Florence.'' Batistuta leads Serie A with 
13 goals in 13 games, putting him on pace to break the single-season 
record of 33 goals. He also could become the fifth player in the last 
20 years to top the scoring chart while playing for a title winner. 
``I really think we can win the championship,'' said Batistuta, in 
his eighth season with Fiorentina. The 29-year-old has come close 
to leaving in recent years, with his biggest complaint being the club's 
failure to compete for a league crown. But with legendary coach Giovanni 
Trapattoni helping turn things around this season, Fiorentina (9-1-3) 
sits alone atop the Serie A standings for the first time since 1982.
