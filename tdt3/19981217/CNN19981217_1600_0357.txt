Congress adopted a resolution today that calls for the support of 
U.S. troops in the Middle East. But some lawmakers are questioning 
the timing of the attack, saying it fell suspiciously close to the 
upcoming impeachment vote. Senate majority leader Trent Lott said 
while he'd been assured by administration officials there was no connection 
with the impeachment process in the house, he cannot support military 
action in the gulf at this time. California republican Dana Rohrabacher 
calls the president's credibility into question. I don't know any 
other president of the United States that is so recognized as a liar 
as this president is. And when he orders our military people into 
action, there is a credibility problem, and that's one of the reasons 
we should move very quickly with this impeachment and get a new president 
into office. The president and his national security team had one 
consideration, and that was our national security. Besides, not a 
single vote will be changed on Capitol Hill with respect to impeachment. 
So the notion that by postponing the vote by a few days there will 
be a Shift in votes is absurd.
