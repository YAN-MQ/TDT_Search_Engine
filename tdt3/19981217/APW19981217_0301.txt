Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki overcame a patriotic crowd to crush hometown 
hope Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-4, 6-2 in the women's tennis final at the 
Asian Games Thursday. Basuki, ranked No. 56 by the WTA, rode to victory 
on a strong groundstroke assault against the No. 37-ranked Tamarine. 
A full house tried to lift the 21-year-old Thai after she dropped 
the opening set, but she suffered two breaks in the second. The Thais 
were celebrating soon afterward, however. Brothers Paradorn and Narathorn 
Srichaphan beat South Korea's Lee Hyung-taik and Yoon Yong-il 6-3, 
7-6 (7-5) for the men's doubles gold. Fans jammed into the stadium's 
front row to seek autographs. Japan's Satoshi Iwabuchi and Nana Miyagi 
won the mixed doubles, beating South Korea's Kim Dong-hyun and Choi 
Ju-yeon 7-5, 7-5 in the final. Basuki and Tamarine are close friends 
because of time spent together on the world tour and had a long hug 
at the net after Tamarine hit a backhand wide on the second match 
point. Tamarine accepted flowers from her fans but spent the next 
half-hour trying to smile through her disappointment and ward off 
tears. Basuki, who is seven years Tamarine's senior, tried to keep 
her opponent cheered up and hugged her several more times before and 
during the medal ceremony. `` We are like a family when we're on the 
tour,'' said Basuki. But the victory was a great moment for Basuki, 
who will play singles and doubles in the Australian Open next month. 
``This title means a lot to me even though it is not a professional 
tour event,'' Basuki said. ``I am just so pleased to have won this 
gold medal for the Indonesian people.'' She said she was not affected 
by Tamarine's supporters, who went against etiquette by cheering every 
Basuki mistake along with every Tamarine winner. ``I had my supporters 
here too, and I just concentrated on the match,'' Basuki said. Tamarine 
said Basuki was always in control. ``Wow! She was unbelievable today. 
Every shot she played she played right. She served well and she hit 
her balls deep,'' Tamarine said. ``I felt like I was the underdog 
because I was younger and she has lots of experience. When she plays 
very well you have to play great, but that wasn't possible today.'' 
Basuki has been a guiding force for Tamarine. ``She's kind of like 
my sister and helped me a lot on all the tours,'' Tamarine said. Basuki 
had an early break in the first set. Serving for the set at 5-4, she 
reached set point with a forehand down the line. She missed a backhand 
drop shot on the next point, but finished the set with a well-placed 
second serve. Tamarine lunged but hit a weak forehand into the net. 
In the second set, Basuki broke in the first game on her fifth break 
point when Tamarine's forehand down the line went into the net. She 
broke again for 4-1 and served out the match from 5-2. Meanwhile Yoon 
Yong-Il of South Korea became the first man through to the gold medal 
game with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Srinath Prahlad of India. His final 
opponent will be Japan's Iwabuchi, a 6-4, 7-6 (7-1) winner over India's 
Mahesh Bhupathi.
