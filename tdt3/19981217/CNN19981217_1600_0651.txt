A Texas bank is a little red faced. It's apologized to customers having 
tested the Y 2 K bug. Bank one Texas printed 2000 overdraft notice 
all dated the year 2000 or later obviously to see if the computer 
could recognize the numbers. The test went fine but the notices were 
accidentally mailed out instead of being destroyed. A bank spokesman 
says it has spent millions preparing for the bug, but, hey, human 
error still exists, he said. Or she said. We don't know the gender.
