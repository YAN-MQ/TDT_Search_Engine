Turkey on Thursday formally challenged a Rome court's decision to 
lift restrictions on Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who was 
detained here in November. Representing the Turkish government, lawyer 
Augusto Sinagra urged the appeal court to reverse its decision and 
to order Ocalan jailed to prevent him from leaving Italy. Turkey wants 
to try Ocalan on terrorism charges. But Italy has refused to extradite 
him, citing Italian law which forbids extradition to a country where 
the suspect can face the death penalty. The leader of the Kurdistan 
Workers Party, or PKK, was arrested Nov. 12 upon his arrival in Rome 
on a flight from Moscow. He was jailed for a week and then transferred 
to a Rome villa and ordered not to leave the city. On Wednesday, a 
court decided to drop all restrictions after Germany dropped its own 
extradition request. Ocalan, who has applied for political asylum 
in Italy, reportedly lacks a valid passport and thus would have difficulty 
legally leaving Italy. It was not clear when Italy would rule on the 
asylum request. The Italian government has indicated it would consider 
expelling Ocalan to a third country, if one could be found. Italy's 
La Repubblica daily reported Thursday that South Africa topped the 
list of countries possibly willing to take Ocalan. The others mentioned 
are Pakistan, North Korea and Libya. Close to 37,000 people have been 
killed since Ocalan's rebel group began fighting for autonomy in southeast 
Turkey in 1984.
