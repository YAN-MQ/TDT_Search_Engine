Uganda procured 62 T-55 Soviet-era tanks earlier this year through 
an Israeli arms dealer, and most of them are not operational, the 
government-owned New Vision Newspaper said Thursday. The tanks, which 
arrived last month from Ukraine at the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, 
were recently transported by rail to Masaka, 130 kilometers (80 miles) 
southwest of the capital Kampala, according to previous media reports. 
The newspaper said Uganda purchased the tanks from an Israeli arms 
dealer Amos Golan, believed to be a former colonel in the Israeli 
army now working for a company called Silvershadow Ltd. The Israeli 
Embassy declined to comment on the report since it involved private 
businessmen. The newspaper said the tanks may have come from the Ukraine, 
Bulgaria or Romania. Opposition legislator Aggrey Awori, a critic 
of the government of President Yoweri Museveni, told The Associated 
Press this week the government paid dlrs 750,000 each for the tanks 
that are in poor condition. Awori said the going price in the international 
market for tanks in such condition would be dlrs 230,000. ``They are 
definitely junk,'' he said. ``We do not believe they are combat-worthy.'' 
He accused the Ugandan government of buying the tanks to supply the 
Congolese rebellion in eastern Congo. Uganda and Rwanda are backing 
the Congolese rebels in their fight to oust President Laurent Kabila. 
Previous New Vision reports have said the tanks were all more than 
30 years old and that 10 did not even run.
