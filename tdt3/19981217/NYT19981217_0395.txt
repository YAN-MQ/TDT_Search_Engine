All happy people have steady incomes, but every unhappy person is 
a paycheck short each month. Leo Tolstoy didn't say that, but many 
parents could have. At no time does this unspoken maxim hang in the 
air more heavily than during the holiday season, when families gather 
around Jell-O molds and eggnog, firing off questions as if they were 
prosecutors in an impeachment inquiry: Are you seeing anyone? Is it 
serious? Does he make a good living? And how good is yours? Therapists 
warn people attending holiday reunions to avoid topics like relationships, 
weight or money _ all of which can raise the tension level. Instead, 
we are advised to stick to safer subjects, like fruitcake recipes 
or Mother Teresa, that are geared to maintaining Yuletide harmony. 
Consider my family. I'm a 30-year-old freelance writer, and my brother, 
Ray, 28, is an actor and stand-up comedian. Our vocations are synonymous 
with erratic incomes, exorbitant health insurance rates, quarterly 
tax payments and endless waits for overdue checks. In stark contrast, 
our older sister, Hillary, 32, makes a bundle as the director of global 
operations at a high-technology company in Silicon Valley, has two 
engineering degrees from Stanford and an MBA from Santa Clara University 
in California and lives in a four-bedroom, two-bath home with a businessman 
husband, a baby and two dogs. My parents have never fretted openly 
about Ray's and my career choices or compared them unfavorably with 
our sister's. And while most parents never shout, ``You're a financial 
loser,'' their children may interpret some of their words as misgivings. 
``My parents have always told me to keep my chin up, to keep plugging 
away,'' says Stacey Zackin, 28, a career adviser in Los Angeles. ``But 
then they'd hand me a check just to be nice, and I'd feel so lame. 
Why did I have to take money from them? It was their pleasure, but 
I felt like I should have been able to make it on my own.'' In my 
family, the zings are also unintentional _ Mom and Dad are just expressing 
their concern, after all _ but the questions are more direct. ``How 
are you paying your rent?'' I once was asked. And a question aimed 
at my brother was: ``How can you be secure with no steady income?'' 
Ray tells me that while living from paycheck to paycheck isn't great, 
it works for him. ``But for them,'' he said of our parents, ``it's 
not the way a normal human being lives.'' How a normal human being 
lives, of course, depends on the definition of normal. But for many 
parents, who have dedicated their lives to providing for their children 
and saving for their own retirements, normal living definitely includes 
health insurance, pension plans and an armchair with backrest. And, 
oh yes, a steady income. Randolph Treu, 38, an independent master 
carpenter who works from project to project on movie, television and 
theater sets and lives in Manhattan, knows all about familial holiday 
inquisitions. He has made it a point never to work more than 10 months 
out of 12, and he has often packed his bags on a moment's notice and 
moved to a distant place to take a job that captured his imagination. 
For a long time, he says, his parents didn't get it. ``My dad was 
in real-estate construction for 25 years; he didn't understand the 
way I worked,'' he recalled. ``He'd say, `How are you making it?' 
But I'm making it great. I'd work 10 months and take in about $65,000. 
I'd turn down work, and they'd say, `How can you do that?' But once 
you've been in a field long enough, you know another job always comes 
along.'' Four years ago, his parents, who live in Milwaukee, finally 
got it. While they were visiting New York, he took them to see Kaufman 
Astoria Studios in New York, where he has often worked. ``That's when 
they saw I was in a good situation,'' he said. ``People came up to 
me, asked if I was free to work next Thursday, if I was available 
for this gig or that. My folks realized I was O.K., that I had plenty 
of work, and they haven't bugged me since.'' Indeed, many parents 
whose children choose unconventional careers reach such conclusions. 
After all, if the kids have survived this long without begging for 
money or sleeping in the gutter, they probably will be all right. 
Parents see that the phrases ``9 to 5,'' ``company car'' and ``expense 
account'' are simply not in our lexicon _ but that we can still be 
successful. Now that my brother and I have some career triumphs, my 
parents have stopped asking us, ``How much do you think you'll earn 
this year?'' Still, when my family and I sit down to holiday dinner 
this year, we'll be playing it safe. There will also be friends at 
the table, so we'll make polite conversation and stick to the financial, 
emotional and spiritual woes of other people. Thank God for Bill Clinton.
