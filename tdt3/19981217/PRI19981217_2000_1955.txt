There are more political developments unfolding in Washington. House 
Speaker Elect Bob Livingston is admitting to past marital infidelity. 
Malcolm Brown reports from Washington. This time the Republicans look 
to be hit by a sex scandal. Speaker Elect Bob Livingston has admitted 
in a statement that he has had extramarital affairs while a member 
of Congress. It followed a report by the Capitol Hill publication 
Role Call that carried an admission from the Louisiana Republican 
that he on occasion strayed from his marriage. The incoming speaker 
has tonight informed fellow Republican lawmakers of the indiscretions 
and his spokesman said there was talk of resignation. For the World, 
I'm Malcolm Brown in Washington. Despite these revelations, the debate 
on whether to impeach President Clinton will go ahead today even attacks 
on Iraq are taking place. From the BBC, this is Pamela McCall, for 
the World.
