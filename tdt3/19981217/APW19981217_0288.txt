In an effort to stifle the flow of narcotics from the region, the 
anti-drug agencies of Thailand and the United Nations pledged Thursday 
to provide support to Cambodia's under-funded drug control program. 
The assistance is aimed at tightening enforcement along the sprawling 
Thai-Cambodian border, drug officials announced after a four-day visit 
by representatives of Thailand's Narcotics Control Board and the U.N. 
Drug Control Program. Thai narcotics agents will train their Cambodian 
counterparts stationed at the border crossing between Thailand's Trat 
province and Cambodia's Koh Kong province, said Sorasit Sangprasert, 
deputy secretary-general of the Narcotics Control Board. The border 
crossing, 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Phnom Penh, lies on the 
Gulf of Thailand in an area of Cambodia notorious for piracy, smuggling 
and lawlessness. Sorasit said Thailand will also provide equipment 
and technical assistance for the establishment of a laboratory in 
Cambodia to test seized substances. ``If we find that these programs 
are successful, we will expand our cooperation to other border areas,'' 
along the border, the Thai drug official said. Visiting UNDCP official 
Christian Kornevall said his office in Bangkok would provide financial 
assistance to the program. Cambodia, one of 28 countries identified 
by the United States as a source of drug problems, is a major exporter 
of marijuana and an important transshipment point for heroin coming 
from the Golden Triangle, the opium-growing region bordering Laos, 
Thailand and Myanmar. Linked to the drug trade in Cambodia are money 
laundering operations that thrive under the developing country's lax 
banking laws. Techniques to expose money laundering will also be taught 
to Cambodian police by the Thais, according to a statement. There 
have been several highly-publicized drug seizures in Cambodia in the 
last year, but sorely underpaid police and military are often reported 
to be aiding the lucrative narcotics trade instead of curbing it. 
In March, military police surrounded the home of one of the nation's 
top anti-drug officials and opened fire with machine guns and rocket 
launchers shortly after the arrest of a high-ranking military police 
officer connected to a drug smuggling operation.
