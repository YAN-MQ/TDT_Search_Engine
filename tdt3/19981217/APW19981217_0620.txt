Russian legislators agreed Thursday to consider a motion appealing 
to Monica Lewinsky to help halt the American attack on Iraq. ``The 
State Duma appeals to Ms. Lewinsky to undertake corresponding measures 
to restrain the emotions of Bill Clinton,'' said the motion by nationalist 
lawmaker Alexander Filatov. The motion was approved on a vote in the 
Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, to be considered for inclusion 
in a broader resolution denouncing the attack on Iraq. The attack 
by the United States and Britain on Iraq was condemned by almost all 
major political groups in Russia. The Communists, the largest party 
in the Duma, also mentioned Clinton and his relationship with the 
former White House intern. ``Many people link it with Clinton's impeachment 
and his intimate relations with a certain person, but if these relations 
develop into such acts of vandalism, than all of U.S. democracy is 
worth a penny,'' Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told a Duma debate 
on the Iraqi crisis.
