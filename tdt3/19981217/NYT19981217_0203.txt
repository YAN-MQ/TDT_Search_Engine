During her short lifetime, Marilyn Monroe was hailed, in Groucho Marx's 
words, as ``Mae West, Theda Bara and Bo-Peep all rolled into one.'' 
She was ``a phenomenon of nature,'' Nunnally Johnson declared, ``like 
Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon.'' In the three and a half decades 
since her death, that legend has been burnished, deconstructed, transmogrified 
and commodified. Her life has not only generated the usual biographies 
and pop tributes, but it's also spawned novels, plays, songs, movies, 
academic papers, gender studies and at least one opera. Barbara Leaming's 
uneven new biography attempts to strip away the accretions of myth 
that have grown up around the actress to give us a portrait of Monroe 
the woman: a deeply troubled and unstable individual, who never managed 
to overcome the sense of abandonment she experienced as a child growing 
up in a succession of foster homes. The Monroe who emerges from this 
volume is, at once, vulnerable and demanding, naive and manipulative, 
courageous and craven: a woman capable of putting her own career on 
the line to stand by her husband-to-be, Arthur Miller, during his 
testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee, but also 
capable of cruelly disparaging his writing to others; a woman who 
desperately sought the respect of others yet who repeatedly sabotaged 
that respect through her tempestuous behavior. Ms. Leaming _ the author 
of biographies of Orson Welles and Katharine Hepburn _ eschews the 
sort of controversial stands taken by earlier Monroe biographers like 
Anthony Summers who dwelled, in the best-selling ``Goddess,'' on the 
mysterious circumstances of her death and her relationship with Robert 
F. Kennedy. Ms. Leaming, in contrast, skims fleetingly over Monroe's 
relationships with Kennedy and his brother, President John F. Kennedy, 
and writes matter-of-factly about her suicide. As this book tells 
it, the central drama in Monroe's life was her relationship with the 
playwright Arthur Miller. Ms. Leaming suggests that Monroe's romance 
with Miller represented her quest for dignity and self-esteem and 
her escape from a tawdry Hollywood past, while its sad, acrimonious 
end became a metaphor for the dissolution of her fondest dreams. In 
relating this story, Ms. Leaming creates a novelistic narrative, animated 
by dramatic set pieces and vivid cameo portraits. But while this method 
makes for a highly readable story, it frequently sidesteps the standards 
of serious biographical research. In her role as an omniscient narrator, 
Ms. Leaming displays a troubling penchant for sweeping generalizations 
without providing the reader with the sort of detailed footnotes that 
might back up such insights into the protagonists' states of mind: 
she writes in one chapter, for instance, that Monroe ``would never 
feel safe in Arthur's love again,'' after she read entries about herself 
in his notebooks. To make matters worse, ``Marilyn Monroe'' suffers 
from bouts of melodramatic romance-novel prose (``Marilyn had grown 
up being told that she was the embodiment of sin and evil''), what-if 
speculation (``And who can say what would have happened to Marilyn's 
relationship with Arthur Miller had she gone to Mississippi in November 
to shoot `Baby Doll' with Kazan?'') and editorial assertions that 
tell the reader exactly what to think and feel. Of Lee Strasberg, 
the head of the prestigious Actors Studio and Monroe's father figure 
and mentor, Ms. Leaming writes, ``From first to last, Strasberg was 
chillingly mercenary.'' While she argues that the ``fierce possessiveness'' 
of Joe DiMaggio would ``blight his relationship with Marilyn,'' she 
patronizingly adds that ``his impeccable behavior following Marilyn's 
death'' allowed him to finally recapture ``some of the `deft serenity' 
he once knew on the baseball field.'' As for Miller, Ms. Leaming writes 
that his play ``After the Fall'' was an ``unctuous exercise in self-justification,'' 
creating a fictional portrait of Monroe as ``a shrill, devouring harpy'' 
while signaling the playwright's own surrender of ``the moral authority 
that had sustained him through a decade of artistic disappointment.'' 
``Ironically, in exposing Marilyn as he did,'' she snidely writes, 
``Miller, who had refused to name names, became something of an `informer' 
himself.'' Such editorializing seems aimed at underscoring Monroe's 
own fears of rejection; it's supposed to create sympathy for Monroe 
as a woman, repeatedly taken up and abandoned by men. Indeed the arc 
of Ms. Leaming's narrative suggests that Monroe's struggles for self-respect 
all came to nought: that for all her efforts to turn herself from 
a sex symbol into a serious actress with creative control over her 
pictures, she ended up in Hollywood much the way she began. In the 
wake of her failed marriage to Miller, in the wake of her firing from 
her last movie, Ms. Leaming writes, she ``seemed to drift back to 
a life she'd once worked very hard to escape'' posing nude for photographers 
and attending all-night parties reminiscent of the 1940s party circuit 
where she'd been treated like chattel by powerful men. In Ms. Leaming's 
view, the sense of worthlessness bequeathed to Monroe by her mentally 
unstable mother (who, the actress claimed, had tried to smother her 
in her crib) had become a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy that her 
psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenson, was unable to head off. The actual 
``triggering event'' for Monroe's suicide, she argues, ``seems to 
have been nothing more than her doctor's having gone to a dinner party 
with his wife.'' ``Earlier, Marilyn had been frantic at the prospect,'' 
she writes. ``By now, it would have become a life-and-death matter, 
his absence on a par with all the abandonments she had suffered, beginning 
with her father. Perhaps she thought she would punish Greenson for 
having left her tonight. Perhaps she thought she could force him to 
return. Perhaps she thought that, as others had done, he'd rescue 
her before it was too late.'' PUBLICATION NOTES: MARILYN MONROE By
