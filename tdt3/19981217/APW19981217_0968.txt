Journalists from the country's most popular weekly gave President 
Emil Constantinescu a mare, commemorating ``his exhausting efforts 
to make Romania the last nag of Europe'' a journalist said Thursday. 
``We believe that Romania lost the last train to NATO and the European 
Union and the president might catch it riding that horse,'' said Ioan 
T. Morar, an editor of Academia Catavencu weekly. The journalists 
presented the president with the starved, 3-year-old horse late Wednesday 
at a ceremony in the giant palace built by former communist dictator 
Nicolae Ceausescu and attended by thousands of Romanian officials. 
Academia Catavencu is Romania's most successful satirical weekly, 
with a circulation of 150,000. It is known for its informative investigative 
pieces, due to strong connections within the intelligence services. 
The weekly has an annual tradition of giving ironical prizes to politicians 
for their most memorable statements or contributions to the state. 
``Its feeding will be another serious problem for Romania,'' Morar 
concluded following the ceremony in which the president accepted the 
gift and even caressed the mare. The presidency spokesmen declined 
to make any comment. Although he is a liberal supporter of the free 
market, Constantinescu's popularity has dropped seriously over the 
last months as Romanians' life has worsened. Unemployment has climbed 
to 9 percent while the monthly wage dropped to only 120 million lei 
(dlrs 12). Romania badly wanted to be invited to join NATO and the 
European Union but its bids were rejected because the country's weak 
economic performances.
