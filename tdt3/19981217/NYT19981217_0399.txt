He always wanted to fly the skies. But when his boyhood dream of becoming 
an airline pilot was thwarted, Mark Bontempo found another route to 
the heavens: selling candy and clothes emblazoned with verses from 
the Scriptures. His earlier business forays weren't so spiritual. 
Bontempo, who qualified for his commercial pilot's license just out 
of college, couldn't find work in the tight airline job market of 
the early 1990s, so he turned to freelance work as a corporate pilot. 
He also worked part-time as a clerk in a private patent office in 
Essex Fells, N.J., where he came up with a business idea: attaching 
an edible handle to Oreo cookies _ a creation he called the Dunky. 
He took the idea to a food trade show, where he met Jerry Greenfield, 
co-founder of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade, and later arranged to talk 
with him at its headquarters in Burlington, Vt. Greenfield didn't 
buy the idea, Bontempo said, but the experience offered a business 
lesson: ``It is possible to get into high places and talk to important 
people.'' As often happens with entrepreneurs, the inspiration for 
his next product began with a problem he encountered in everyday life. 
A devout Christian, Bontempo distributed religious pamphlets as part 
of a local street ministry. Most people discarded them almost immediately, 
and he wondered how he could change that. ``I was sitting at my desk 
when it hit me like a bag of nickels,'' he said. `` `Testamints'! 
Candies bearing the Lord's message. And people would hold on to the 
Bible verse, because it would be right on the package.'' Confident 
that he had a winner, he quit his job and flew to Chicago to talk 
to Rainer Schindler, the chief operating officer of Ragold Inc., maker 
of Velamints. Schindler said he liked the idea, but was concerned 
that the company, based in Karlsruhe, Germany, ``would be very sensitive 
about either slighting Jesus or profiting through the use of God's 
name.'' Still, he was intrigued enough to give Bontempo a ticket to 
a candy convention in California. There, Bontempo approached the makers 
of Chiclets, Pez candies and Trident gum, but they, too, didn't bite. 
Discouraged, he returned home. It was about then, in 1994, that he 
got the call _ from Continental Airlines, that is _ offering him the 
job he had once coveted. ``I was 34, and I knew that they only hired 
until about age 40, and so the window was narrowing,'' he said. ``I 
went for a prayer walk. And though it wasn't quite like Saul on the 
road to Damascus, I felt a sense of assurance that Testamints was 
going to happen.'' He turned down Continental's offer and, with $130,000 
in capital raised from local Christian businessmen, created Food for 
Thought (later renamed Testamints Inc.) in Randolph, N.J. Again he 
went to Schindler, who was more receptive now that Bontempo had both 
a business plan and financing. Schindler agreed to produce Testamints 
in three flavors, with the design of a cross on every mint and a passage 
from Scripture on each package of 12. (Schindler said he also put 
posters in the German production plant, assuring workers that the 
candies were intended to be inspirational, not sacrilegious.) ``Each 
one is meant to be encouraging,'' Bontempo said of the messages. ``There 
aren't any `turn or burn' selections.'' An example is ``We love because 
He first loved us'' (1 John 4:19). Testamints hit the market in 1996 
and quickly became a big seller in Christian bookstores. Bontempo 
expects revenues to reach $3 million this year, up from $1 million 
the first year. QVC, the home shopping channel, recently started selling 
the confections in collectors' tins. Testamints doesn't divulge earnings 
but says it contributes 10 percent of profits to Christian ministries. 
After getting the business going, Bontempo decided to replace himself 
as chief executive last year, though he remains the majority shareholder. 
He handed the reins to Alfred Poe, most recently the president of 
the Campbell Soup Co.'s meal enhancement group. Poe has since expanded 
the product line to fruit sours and Promise Pops, which are likewise 
wrapped in Scriptural sayings, and plans to introduce Spanish-language 
Testamints soon. A born-again Christian, Poe said his goal is to reach 
further into the secular market, so that ``you can find a Testamint 
wherever you find a Life Saver.'' Bontempo, meanwhile, has set out 
in new directions. In 1997, he was the co-founder, with Valerie Fritz, 
of the Wee Witness Clothing line, which includes Bibbles _ baby bibs 
with Bible verse. By the end of this month, he said, Appalachian Inc., 
a large distributor of Christian products, will have the apparel in 
4,000 stores. Spreading the Gospel to the masses, of course, is a 
2,000-year-old enterprise. But lately, evangelism has gone commercial 
in a big way, with sales of Christian music, fiction, clothing and 
now candy. And Bontempo, a supplicant not so long ago, today plays 
the role of deal maker. ``Last month, this guy comes into the office 
and says he wants to put verse on the side of Chap Stick and call 
it `Chapters' and be 50-50 partners,'' Bontempo said. He declined 
the invitation. What's next for Bontempo? Commandmints, anyone? He's 
already patented the name.
