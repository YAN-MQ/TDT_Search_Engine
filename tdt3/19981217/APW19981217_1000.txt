President Boris Yeltsin denounced the United States and Britain on 
Thursday for attacking Iraq and demanded an immediate end to the bombing, 
warning it could shatter hopes of peace in the Middle East. ``Russia 
demands an immediate end to military action, to show common sense 
and restraint and not to allow further escalation of the conflict 
which could result in the most dramatic consequences not only for 
the Iraqi settlement but for the stability of the entire region,'' 
Yeltsin said in a statement. The United States and Britain launched 
air and missile attacks against Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein's 
continued defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors. In response, Russia's 
parliament urged the government Thursday to increase funding for the 
country's military and defense industry. The State Duma voted 394-1 
to approve the non-binding resolution that also denounced ``the barbarous 
bombings.'' Russian television channels showed Yeltsin looking at 
maps of the Middle East and talking with several generals and senior 
aides. The president spent most of Wednesday night monitoring the 
situation, aides said. Russia has consistently opposed military action 
against Iraq, an old ally of the Soviet Union, and attempted to find 
a political solution to the dispute. But Moscow is no longer a global 
superpower and is able to do little more than protest U.S. actions, 
goading Russian frustration. Most Russians seemed critical of the 
attacks _ and most mentioned their sympathy toward ordinary Iraqis. 
The U.S. and Britain ``certainly had no right to do that _ there are 
people there, after all,'' said Nadezhda Nenasheva, walking with her 
child on a Moscow street. Yeltsin discussed the situation in a phone 
call with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The two leaders agreed that 
the attack was ``unacceptable, unilateral and contradicting the U.N. 
charter and the principles of international law,'' the Kremlin press 
service said. Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov also sharply 
denounced the United States and Britain and said Russia would work 
in the United Nations to end the attacks. ``This time the activities 
of the U.S. and Great Britain have not been provoked by Iraq. The 
U.S. administration has the strikes on its conscience,'' said Primakov, 
who has had close ties with Iraq for many years. Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov said Russia will insist on the dismissal of U.N. weapons 
inspector chief Richard Butler, saying Butler ``carries a personal 
responsibility'' for the bombings. In his report to U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan on Tuesday, Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, 
evasion and subterfuge. He said he could not give assurances that 
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed. A day after 
the report, U.N. monitors were ordered to evacuate Baghdad. ``The 
current crisis was created artificially, including through irresponsible 
actions by Butler,'' Ivanov said. ``The document he presented (to 
Annan) gives a distorted picture of the state of affairs in Iraq.'' 
Russia's Islamic Committee issued a statement saying the bombings 
are ``effectively the start of World War III, which the West has long 
been promising to wage on us, Muslims.'' The Union of Russia's Muslims 
was even more blunt. ``Our enemies must not entertain the illusions 
that the Islamic world will remain unresponsive and divided,'' it 
said. Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the strikes ``go 
beyond the international law and annul all political and diplomatic 
efforts aimed at implementing the U.N. Security Council resolutions,'' 
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Parliamentary leaders also denounced 
the attacks, with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov saying, ``This 
is international banditry that must be sharply denounced.'' Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist leader and a long-standing supporter 
of Saddam, called for Russia to unilaterally stop abiding by the sanctions 
against Iraq, and temporarily recall its ambassador to the United 
States, the Interfax news agency reported. Zhirinovsky, who is given 
to flamboyant remarks, also called U.S. President Bill Clinton an 
``international bandit who ought to be tried.''
