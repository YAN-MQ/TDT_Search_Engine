Australia's economy stood rock-solid during the Asian financial crisis 
and outperformed the rest of the world, Treasurer Peter Costello said 
Thursday. Costello released the government's fiscal year 1998-99 mid-year 
economic and fiscal outlook, which boosted official forecasts for 
economic growth, jobs growth and the budget surplus while pointing 
to lower inflation and steady unemployment in the current financial 
year. The document suggests the full impact of the Asian crisis will 
hit Australia's economic growth in 1999, before a recovery in the 
new millennium. ``In the face of the Asian financial fury Australia 
has been a rock of economic stability and growth,'' Costello said. 
``The Australian economy has outperformed the region and the world.'' 
But Costello said a widening current account deficit _ expected to 
expand to Australian dollars 32 billion (U.S dlrs 19.85 billion), 
or 5.5 percent of gross domestic product by June 30, 1999 _ made a 
further cut in official interest rates unlikely. The midyear review 
increased economic growth forecasts for 1998-99 to 3.25 percent, from 
2.75 percent forecast before the Oct. 3 national election. Costello 
said growth would strengthen, reaching an annual rate of 3.5 percent 
over the year to June 30, 2000. Jobs growth for 1998-99 was forecast 
at two percent, sliding to 1.25 percent in the year to June 30, 2000. 
Costello said the falling Australian exchange rate and the ability 
of Australian exporters to diversify had helped the economy withstand 
the Asian crisis. But he expected business investment and economic 
growth to slow next year before recovering in 2000.
