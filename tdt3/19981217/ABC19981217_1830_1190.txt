When we come back, we'll talk about this rather overt disdain for 
Bill clinton. Bacon! Bacon! Where's the bacon? I smell bacon! Bacon! 
Bacon! Gotta be bacon! Only one thing smells like bacon! That's bacon! 
Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon! There! In that bag! What's it say? I can't 
read! Please, please give me what's in the bag! Chewy, yummy, smoky 
bacon! Here you go! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! It's bacon! No, 
it's beggin' strips brand dog snack from Purina! Beggin strips... 
it's bacon!
