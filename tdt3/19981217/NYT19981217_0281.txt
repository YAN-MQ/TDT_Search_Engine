With the air strikes on Iraq causing no damage to its ability to pump 
and ship oil, prices plunged Thursday, wiping out a large part of 
the gains of the last week. The price of crude oil fell 91 cents, 
or 8 percent, to $10.45 a barrel, on London's International Petroleum 
Exchange. It also plunged to $11.03 a barrel, down $1.35, or 10.9 
percent, in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The decline 
also reflected disappointment with a meeting in Madrid by the oil 
ministers of some of the world's largest oil producers _ Saudi Arabia, 
Venezuela and Mexico _ which was called to initiate further production 
cuts. Even though the three ministers said in a statement that they 
had agreed to discuss ``further measures'' with other producers that 
would help oil prices recover and that they planned to meet with other 
producers to discuss such steps, it was not enough to stem the plunge 
in oil prices. Vahan Zanoyan, chief executive officer of the Petroleum 
Finance Co., a consulting group to the oil industry in Washington, 
said that the meeting had raised expectations that there might be 
a quick fix and that it had backfired by not producing one. Last spring, 
the three countries agreed to cut oil production, a move that was 
followed by other producers, reducing daily output by about 3.2 million 
barrels and propping up oil prices for a while. The oil ministers 
said Thursday that they had agreed to keep those cuts in effect. Venezuela, 
they added, agreed to extend its production cuts of 525,000 barrels 
a day for another six months until the end of next year, following 
the example of some of the other major oil producers. The air attacks 
have so far not disrupted Iraq's ability to export crude oil. ``Unless 
there is a miscalculation, there is no intention to hit any oil installations,'' 
Zanoyan said. He added, however, that even under the best of circumstances 
tankers that normally load up at the port of Mina El-Bakr would not 
go there while the attacks continued. He said that this could cause 
a two- to three-week delay in some of the oil shipments from Iraq. 
Because there is already an oversupply of crude oil in most of the 
world's storage tanks, such a delay in shipments ``is not going to 
make a dent,'' he said. Under an exception to the economic sanctions 
imposed by the United Nations after the defeat of Iraq in the Gulf 
War, the country can sell $5.2 billion in oil every six months to 
pay for food and medicine. Iraq has been able to increase its exports 
to about 1.8 million barrels a day under the program, which has added 
to the oversupply. As a result, crude oil prices have fallen by about 
40 percent from levels last year. The Asian economic downturn and 
the mild winter in the United States have cut demand and led to an 
increase of oil inventories to supply world demand of 74 million barrels 
a day for about two and a half months.
