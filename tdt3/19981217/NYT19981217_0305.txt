Although a statement he issued Wednesday was universally interpreted 
as accusing President Clinton of ordering air strikes in Iraq to divert 
attention from impeachment, Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, 
insisted Thursday that was not what he meant. ``Once the decision 
is made and the action is under way, you support it,'' he declared 
on television Thursday. Just as the bombing was beginning on Wednesday, 
a statement was released by Lott's office that began: ``While I have 
been assured by administration officials that there is no connection 
with the impeachment process in the House of Representatives, I cannot 
support this military action in the Persian Gulf at this time. Both 
the timing and the policy are subject to question.'' The White House 
was furious. Democrats in Congress accused Lott of violating the age-old 
political precept of not criticizing the president publicly when troops 
were in danger. And many of Lott's Republican colleagues held news 
conferences at which they said that while they supported the military 
strikes, they understood Lott's skepticism about the president's motives. 
In an interview from Mississippi on CNN, Lott said Thursday that his 
qualms about the timing were ``that we should have acted in February, 
that we should have gone forward with the bombing effort in November 
and that my concern now was one of policy in terms of what is our 
strategic plan.'' As for impeachment, Lott said, ``I believe there 
is no relationship, but the fact that people ask that question is, 
in and of itself, a question.'' He said that the administration had 
not told him the truth in August about air strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan, 
and added: ``Once you sort of feel like you've been burned, the next 
time it comes around, then you're inclined to be a little more cautious.'' 
Lott maintained that in 1991 ``when we had the vote in the House and 
in the Senate'' authorizing President George Bush to use force against 
Iraq, ``I don't believe there was a single Democrat that voted for 
that.`` In fact, 86 Democrats in the House and 10 in the Senate, including 
Al Gore, voted for the authorization. Whatever Lott meant on Wednesday, 
nearly everybody in the Capitol was talking about the connection between 
Iraq and impeachment. The question on many minds Thursday involved 
not whether the majority leader had raised the connection but whether 
he had been right to do so. Leading Republican senators who support 
the air strikes made a point of defending Lott on the early morning 
television shows. For instance, Sen. John McCain of Arizona said on 
ABC, ``Senator Lott and I have some disagreement here as to the degree 
of support, but I believe that it's understandable that people would 
have some skepticism.'' In interviews, many other Republicans also 
supported their leader. For example, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, often 
seen as a rival to Lott within the party, said, ``I think it's almost 
astounding that so few others are questioning the timing.'' But when 
pressed, some Republican senators said that Lott may have stepped 
out of bounds. Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah said, ``My first reaction 
to Trent was, `Right on! I'm glad someone is saying this,' but under 
the circumstances, he probably went a little further than he should 
have.'' Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a member of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, said: ``It's not the way I would have done it. You have 
to be very careful on these kinds of things because the air is thick 
with raw partisanship in this town. Something this serious, it seems 
to me, should overtake partisan politics.'' Democrats were more pointed, 
suggesting that Lott was not the most adept of senators on complicated 
policy issues. ``Trent Lott does not do foreign policy,'' said Sen. 
Joseph Biden Jr. of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations 
Committee, said in response to the Wednesday statement. Republicans 
said they could not afford to criticize their leader publicly. But 
when promised anonymity, several said that Lott's strengths lay in 
handling political matters and keeping the Senate operating on schedule 
and not in making policy. They suggested that his statement on Iraq 
was an example of his tendency to blurt things out when he had not 
thought them through completely.
