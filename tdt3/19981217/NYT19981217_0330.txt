As Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee propelled the nation 
down the superhighway toward impeachment, they sped past a number 
of exits, places where history, tradition or a different understanding 
of the Constitution offered a path to another outcome. Throughout 
the discussion on what to do about President Clinton's failings ran 
an argument _ joined perhaps with more rhetorical flourish than candor 
and sometimes not joined at all _ over what standards to apply in 
deciding whether to impeach a president. As the impeachment debate 
moves to the full House, that argument resumes. Distilled from the 
weeks of hearings and the days of committee debate that produced four 
articles of impeachment, here are some of the pivotal legal and constitutional 
issues that confront House members. Implicit in each issue is a kind 
of theoretical offramp from the impeachment highway, beckoning to 
members who choose not to follow the Republican leadership to its 
chosen destination. IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE Before and during the committee 
vote, there was much discussion of what the Constitution's framers 
meant when they provided for removing the president, and other officials, 
from office ``on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery 
or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Democrats, along with the 
scholars and lawyers they called to the witness table, insisted that 
the president's behavior, which many described as deplorable or worse, 
fell short of the constitutional definition, while Republicans maintained 
that the president's misdeeds fell comfortably within it. At this 
level of generality, the debate proved unenlightening and essentially 
circular; no matter how high the Democrats set the rhetorical bar 
_ ``The great weight of the historical and scholarly evidence leads 
to the conclusion that in order to have committed an impeachable offense 
the president must have acted to subvert our system of government,'' 
as Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, put it _ the Republicans 
responded that the president's behavior met the test. No real exit 
ramp there. But under this general heading were several more specifically 
formulated questions about what qualified as an impeachable offense. 
PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE The Democrats and their witnesses argued vigorously 
that no president should be impeached for private wrongdoing, for 
``the sins of Clinton the man, not Clinton the president,'' as the 
committee's junior member, Rep. Thomas Barrett, D-Wis., described 
it. Abbe Lowell, the Judiciary Committee's Democratic counsel, argued 
that this impeachment process, stripped of Whitewater, campaign finance 
and other aspects of the public's business, was fundamentally only 
about sex. ``Bill Clinton's alleged crimes are not those of an errant 
president, but that of an unfaithful husband,'' Lowell said. Or as 
Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., said: ``When I look at the totality of 
this case, I am left with one undeniable conclusion: The president 
betrayed his wife. He did not betray his country.'' This was perhaps 
the first and most obvious offramp from the road to impeachment. But 
the Republicans barely slowed down. They did not dispute the premise 
so much as the facts: What might have begun as private had become 
public, they said. ``The conduct obstructed our judicial system and 
at that point became an issue, not of personal concern, but of national 
consequence,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said. ``Perjury is not 
sex, obstruction is not sex, abuse of power is not about sex,'' declared 
the committee's chairman, Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill. ``Lies about 
sex are one thing,'' he added. ``Lies under oath by the nation's chief 
law enforcement officer are another.'' Democrats tried to make the 
case that even if they transcended the realm of private misbehavior, 
the president's misdeeds did not rise to the level of ``acts to undermine 
or subvert the government,'' as Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, 
described her understanding of impeachable offenses. But such assertions 
only led the Republicans to invoke the concept of ``the rule of law,'' 
which they said Clinton had placed in jeopardy. ONE STRIKE, YOU'RE 
OUT The Republicans by and large took the position that a lie is a 
lie is an impeachable offense, no explanation needed or permitted. 
``To me, making a false statement under oath to a criminal grand jury 
is an impeachable offense, period,'' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner 
of Wisconsin. The notion that context could make a difference, that 
not all perjury was equivalent, represented another potential exit 
from the impeachment highway that attracted only Democrats. Rep. Charles 
Schumer of New York said that while he believed the president did 
lie, ``he did so about a sexual relationship, not about matters of 
government.'' And Wexler cautioned against one-size-fits-all judgments. 
``I believe in my heart that morality is a complex equation,'' he 
said, ``that good people sometimes do bad things, that moral people 
sometimes commit immoral acts.'' Interestingly, this had once been 
Hyde's view. ``It just seems to me too simplistic to condemn all lying,'' 
he said in 1987, when President Reagan and members of his administration 
were on the defensive in the Iran-Contra investigation. CRIMINAL LAW 
STANDARDS There was general agreement that impeachment is a political 
judgment that does not demand proof of criminal wrongdoing beyond 
a reasonable doubt. But Democrats maintained that the evidence fell 
short even of the lesser ``clear and convincing'' standard of proof 
that the Judiciary Committee applied when it voted in 1974 to impeach 
Richard M. Nixon. A New Jersey Democrat, Steven Rothman, asked: ``When 
you have equally intelligent lawyers refuting one another on inferences 
and conclusions from the same fact, what's this committee left with?'' 
In the absence of witnesses, he said, ``I believe the score is zero-zero, 
and the accused is not convicted.'' Democrats also complained that 
the first two articles of impeachment, dealing with perjury, failed 
to specify the statements deemed perjurious. Hutchinson replied that 
``we're not going on technical legal definition, technical criminal 
statutes.'' He said it was sufficient for the articles to allege behavior 
``in the nature of perjury'' or ``in the nature of false statements.'' 
THE HOUSE'S ROLE ``Ours is but a partial role in the drama of impeachment,'' 
Hyde said, on one level a simple statement of the obvious fact that 
only the Senate has the power to convict and remove a president. But 
the committee engaged in a spirited debate over whether members should 
vote to impeach only if they were personally persuaded that conviction 
and removal were ultimately the proper course. Republicans tended 
to describe impeachment as a kind of warning shot across the bow, 
one that did not imply commitment to an eventual result. ``The House 
does not convict; it merely accuses,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum of 
Florida. Democrats objected that the Constitution gave the House a 
judgment to make, an independent role the leadership's approach threatened 
to trivialize. ``This is not sending to the Senate a questionnaire,'' 
said Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, ``this is a statement the 
president should be thrown out.'' Under this view, any member who 
travels the whole impeachment road in the House and remains unpersuaded 
that the Senate should convict is obliged to get off at the last exit.
