The British Arts Council announced Thursday that it would increase 
its subsidy to the struggling Royal Opera House by more than $21 million 
over the next three years, a move the opera said would allow it to 
reinstate a portion of its canceled 1999 season and to charge less 
for tickets when it returns to its refurbished headquarters next December. 
The Royal Opera, which also presents ballet and other works, will 
use the money for 10 performances of ``Paul Bunyan'' at the Sadler's 
Wells Theater in April. It will also put on a short series of concerts 
at the Royal Festival Hall in May and June, and hold a concert at 
the Barbican with Placido Domingo on April 25. Meanwhile, the Royal 
Ballet will perform a four-week summer season at Sadler's Wells in 
July and will embark on its planned trip to Asia in the spring. Today's 
news of the increased funds also spurred Bernard Haitink, music director 
of the Royal Opera, to withdraw his threat to resign. Several months 
ago, Haitink said that he could not remain in the job if the cash-starved 
opera went ahead with plans to cancel the 1999 season. But Thursday, 
he said, ``I am pleased to remain music director of the Royal Opera 
House and look forward to opening what will be a wonderful new theater.'' 
In increasing the grant to $26.4 million from $23.8 million for the 
1999 season _ and promising a further increase, to $33 million, in 
each of the next two years _ the Arts Council, the government-financed 
agency that dispenses money to cultural organizations, was expressing 
its view that after years of mismanagement and financial ineptitude, 
the opera house had finally begun to put itself in order. Even as 
it undergoes a $353 million refurbishment of its home in Covent Garden, 
scheduled to be completed at the end of 1999, the opera house has 
been running its day-to-day operations at a deficit for years. After 
a series of musical-chair changes in top management, it finally arrived 
at a plan this fall to restore its financial health. But the plan 
was extreme, involving the cancellation of the entire 1999 opera season, 
layoffs and salary cuts for many staff members. ``The Arts Council 
believes the Royal Opera House is now putting itself back on track 
for a sustainable future to insure a solid base for world-class opera 
and ballet after considerable management and financial problems in 
the past,'' the agency said in a news release. But, it added, the 
extra money came with strings attached. Among other things, it said, 
the opera house promised to lower the price of opera tickets, which 
can cost as much as $218 each for the most expensive seats at the 
most expensive operas. It also promised to increase access by staying 
open during the day and attracting visitors with new shops and restaurants, 
to enhance its exposure with educational programs and television broadcasts 
and to raise $165 million in private donations. ``All of the grant 
figures are in anticipation of, and conditional upon, a satisfactory, 
detailed business plan based on an artistic program of quality and 
a genuine concern for access and education,'' the Arts Council said.
