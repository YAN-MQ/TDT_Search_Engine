Dozens of Albanian students defied police orders on Thursday and continued 
a week-long hunger strike, demanding improved dormitories and better 
scholarships. Police ordered a group of 40 students to leave a disco 
in Tirana University dormitories where they had been protesting, officials 
said. Prime Minister Pandeli Majko said the strike was ordered stopped 
because police had ``information that terrorist attacks against the 
students had been planned,'' and because one of the students had been 
diagnosed with hepatitis. But later in the day, 30 students returned 
to continue the strike. The students, from Tirana and Skodra universities, 
have refused to end their protests despite government promises to 
invest the equivalent of $70,000 to improve dormitories. Student unrest 
has played an important role in Albanian politics, and student strikes 
preceded both the fall of the communist government in 1991 and former 
president Sali Berisha. The Albanian information ministry says the 
son of Berisha is among the strike organizers. Berisha supporters 
have held rallies in support of the students, calling on them to continue 
the hunger strike until Majko steps down.
