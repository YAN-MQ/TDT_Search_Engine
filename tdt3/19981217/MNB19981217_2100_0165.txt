We keep coming on the air, reporting about strange Con fluneses of 
events. We have another set of circumstances on our hands here tonight. 
Within the last hour, another extraordinarily powerful volley of cruise 
missiles landing, some of them in downtown Baghdad. The Reuters news 
agency reporting Iraqi anti-aircraft fire tearing open the sky over 
Baghdad at 4:0 5:00 A.M. their time Friday, about a dozen explosions 
heard through the town. Keeping in mind Iraq is about the size of 
California, this is the equivalent of our cameras looking out to just 
one slice of one city in that state. It's important to remember most 
of the operation is going on in the south of Iraq in the country side.
