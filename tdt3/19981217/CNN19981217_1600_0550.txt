The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins Sunday, and President Clinton 
says he wants to avoid attacking Iraq during that time. Mark Marino 
has more. It marks the month when the prophet Muhammad first received 
revelations from God. Ramadan is the most sacred time of the Muslim 
year, a fact recognized in washington. The Muslim holy month of Ramadan 
begins this weekend. For us to initiate military action during Ramadan 
would be profoundly offensive to the Muslim world. During the month-long 
observance, Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking and sexual intercourse. 
Different from the Christmas celebration of salvation or the atonement 
of the Jewish yom Kippur, Ramadan centers on the obedience to allah 
and spiritual stocktaking. Long before Islam, Ramadan was for Arabs 
a time to settle old debts, disputes and behave charitably toward 
their neighbors. Ramadan consists of five Pillars or basic tenets 
of Islam. Shahadah -- the affirmation that there is no God but allah, 
and Muhammad is his prophet. Salat -- praying five times daily. Sawm 
-- fasting during the month. Zakat -- giving to charity. And Hajj 
-- making the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime. Estimates 
put at more than a billion worldwide followers of Islam with as many 
as 6 million in the U.S. the beginning and end of the holiest of islamic 
months comes when a trustworthy witness eyes the new Moon. One difficulty 
posed by this time of saluting uninterrupted peace and the prohibition 
of war -- a clouded sky. Mark Marino, CNN, Los Angeles.
