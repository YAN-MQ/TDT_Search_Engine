Not all U.N. weapons inspectors are down on Iraq. The agency investigating 
Iraq's nuclear program says it has run into far fewer problems than 
Richard Butler's inspection teams. Butler's U.N. Special Commission, 
known as UNSCOM, rejects Iraq's claims it has destroyed all of its 
weapons of mass destruction, and he accuses the Baghdad government 
of obstructing teams trying to verify their elimination. UNSCOM inspects 
and monitors chemical and biological weapons programs as well as those 
involving long-range missiles. The International Atomic Energy Agency, 
on the other hand, has said it believes Iraq no longer has much to 
hide in the area of nuclear weapons. The IAEA, based in Vienna, has 
given Iraq fairly good marks, saying it has provided ``the necessary 
level of cooperation'' to enable the nuclear inspectors to complete 
their work ``efficiently and effectively.'' But IAEA officials say 
their job has been easier than that of UNSCOM, and therefore less 
confrontational. ``They've had a harder time, so they had to pursue 
their work much more toughly and with larger teams than we did,'' 
IAEA spokesman David Kyd told The Associated Press. Iraq's nuclear 
facilities were heavily damaged during the 1991 Gulf War and, Kyd 
noted, it is harder to hide a clandestine nuclear program. ``Biological 
and chemical weapons can be squirreled away anywhere in pharmaceutical 
or plants or elsewhere,'' he said. The IAEA says it has dismantled 
much of what survived the Gulf War. However, the Washington-based 
Nuclear Control Institute suggests nuclear inspectors were relatively 
unimpeded because they were less demanding. If UNSCOM, rather than 
IAEA, was responsible for nuclear inspections, ``there would not be 
the dangerously mistaken impression that exists today that Iraq's 
nuclear weapons threat is dead,'' said Paul Levanthal, president of 
the Nuclear Control Institute.
