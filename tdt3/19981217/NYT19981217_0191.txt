In his feature film debut, as the writer, director and co-producer 
of the darkly comic ``Trouble on the Corner,'' Alan Madison has assembled 
an exceptional cast: Tony Goldwyn, Giancarlo Esposito, Roger Rees, 
Tammy Grimes, Debi Mazar, Joe Morton, Edie Falco, Anna Thomson, Daniel 
Von Bargen, Charles Busch, Mark Margolis and Bruce MacVittie. Leading 
the ensemble is Goldwyn as Jeff, a psychologist treating patients 
in his apartment in a crumbling Harlem tenement that is as vivid a 
character as any of his troubled patients, who often include his eccentric 
neighbors. Under the literal and figurative weight of his dwelling 
and his near-sexless marriage to a motherly nurse (Ms. Falco), Jeff 
is looping into lunacy. En route to becoming unhinged, he is no help 
to his patients, as they often complain. And they are no help to him. 
He is upset by the volatile Sandy ( MacVittie), who has a taste for 
14-year-old girls; he cannot fathom the love of Daryl ( Esposito) 
for his terminally ill partner; he offers no satisfaction to the wife 
(Ms. Thomson) of his butcher (Von Bargen), who revels in blood. In 
the estimation of his patients, the therapist is dull and hollow and 
knows nothing of love. While his wife sleeps, the frustrated Jeff 
spies through a hole in their crumbling bathroom ceiling, trying to 
learn more about the sexy new upstairs neighbor (Ms. Mazar), who never 
takes off her gloves. Jeff is nearing a state of lethal combustion. 
The performances _ among them Ms. Grimes as a Bible-spouting, newspaper-collecting 
widow; Busch as the local psychic; Rees as a disheveled dog-walking 
lawyer, and Morton as a police detective enlisted by Jeff to do something 
about the predatory Sandy _ are expert. And the atmosphere is convincing. 
But ``Trouble on the Corner'' suffers from a monotony of pace. It 
takes too long to get where it's going; and when it arrives, it offers 
an explanation for Jeff's derangement that seems too hasty and facile. 
``Trouble on the Corner'' is playing through Dec. 30 in Manhattan.
