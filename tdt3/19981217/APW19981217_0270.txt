South Africa on Thursday criticized the U.S. air strikes on Iraq, 
saying military force would not solve the conflict between U.N. weapons 
inspectors and Baghdad. Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo ``expressed his 
deep concern'' about the attack to the U.S. deputy chief of mission, 
the ministry said. Nzo also said South Africa supported U.N. Security 
Council resolutions for Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction. 
But the strikes ``would inevitably lead to greater human suffering 
for the people of Iraq,'' the ministry said.
