Seattle quit the race to host the 2012 Summer Olympics on Thursday. 
The Seattle Olympic Bid Committee, formed to seek the 2012 Games, 
withdrew its candidacy and disbanded for lack of civic support. The 
decision by the committee's executive board followed an 8-1 City Council 
vote Monday, reiterating the council's decision against supporting 
an official Olympic bid. Such a governmental endorsement _ including 
a pledge to underwrite any losses _ is required before the U.S. Olympic 
Committee will consider a bid. Seattle had been an early favorite 
to secure USOC selection as the American city that will go against 
international challengers in a race that won't be decided until an 
International Olympic Committee vote in 2005. The withdrawal leaves 
eight U.S. hopefuls _ Baltimore-Washington, Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, 
Los Angeles, New York, Orlando-Tampa and San Francisco.
