From National Public Radio News In Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff. 
Republican leaders in the House had decided to begin the debate on 
the impeachment of President Clinton tomorrow morning. House Speaker 
Designate Bob Livingston defended the decisions against Democratic 
complaints that it could undermine the military action in the Persia 
Gulf. It allows us to face the issue head on. If it's meritorious, 
it will pass. And if it's not, it will fail. We can go home and understand 
that we've done our Constitutional responsibility and the rest is 
either in our colleagues hands or in God's hands or in the president's 
hands. But, it will be simply ended for us. Shortly after he announced 
the decision, Congressman Livingston told his Republican colleagues 
that he had occasionally strayed from his marriage. A spokesman for 
the Louisiana Republican said he had no plans to resign and read a 
statement in which Livingston said "My indiscretions were not with 
employees on my staff. And I have never been asked to testify under 
oath about them". Republicans defended Livingston repeating that the 
impeachment issue is not about the president sexual misbehavior but 
about lying under oath.
