A tragic accident at the St. Louis zoo killed the engineer of a Sight-seeing 
train Friday. Witnesses say it went out of control and jumped the 
tracks. Ten passengers were aboard at the time. Many heard the engineer 
yelling he could not stop the train. It usually traveled no faster 
than five miles an hour. Investigators are now trying to determine 
if the brakes had failed.
