A lifelong Democrat, film director Rob Reiner does not have a lot 
in common politically with people like millionaire Michael Huffington, 
a Republican, or actor Charlton Heston, a conservative icon. ``We 
don't agree on much, that's true,'' Reiner said the other day in his 
office at The Culver Studios near here. ``But the one thing we do 
agree on is helping young children.'' The three men have put aside 
their differences to battle the tobacco industry over a ballot initiative 
that would add 50 cents in new taxes to the price of a pack of cigarettes, 
and use the money to finance programs in early childhood development 
and prenatal care. For months, the men have been making appearances 
across the state and, in recent days, radio and television commercials 
in support of the initiative. If passed, it will rocket California 
to No. 3 from No. 22 among states with the highest cigarette taxes 
in the country, behind only Alaska and Hawaii. Currently the cigarette 
tax is 37 cents a pack in California. The initiative would raise the 
price by about 20 percent, to $3.05 a pack from $2.55. Some experts 
on smoking say that the additional tax will discourage thousands of 
teen-agers from ever lighting up and will encourage thousands more, 
including many adults, to quit. The tax is also expected to generate 
an estimated $700 million to $750 million annually in revenue, which 
will be earmarked for early childhood development, prenatal care and 
antismoking programs. ``Here's an opportunity to make a major investment 
in young children and to get kids to stop smoking,'' Reiner said, 
leaning forward in his chair and waving his hands in the air like 
the liberal and excitable son-in-law character that he played for 
years on the ``All in the Family'' television show. ``How can anyone 
oppose it?'' The answer is, with money. Lots and lots of money. The 
tobacco industry has poured millions of dollars into the fight against 
Proposition 10, also known as the ``Reiner Initiative.'' Some observers 
estimate that the tobacco industry might spend as much $20 million, 
mostly for television advertisements attacking the initiative as an 
unfair tax and as too bureaucratic. But Matt Taggart, the spokesman 
for the ``No on 10'' campaign, which is heavily financed by the tobacco 
industry, would not comment on the exact amount. ``It's a significant 
media buy,'' he said. Reiner said his group would spend about $5 million 
for television and radio advertisements, using the familiar faces 
and voices of Heston, actor Martin Sheen and former Surgeon General 
C. Everett Koop. Still, that may not be enough. Although the proposition 
has been ahead in the polls for weeks, its support among respondents 
fell to 48 percent this month, from 56 percent in August, said Mark 
DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll. The percentage of those opposed 
has not changed much, holding at about 33 percent. More significantly, 
perhaps, the percentage of voters in the undecided column has increased 
to 19 percent from 10 percent. ``The burden is on the `yes' side to 
make the sale,'' DiCamillo said. ``All the `no' side has to do is 
raise doubts.'' Supporters have 15 pages of endorsements from health 
groups, labor unions and elected officials like the Democratic mayor 
of San Francisco, Willie Brown, and the Republican mayor of Los Angeles, 
Richard Riordan. In a recent editorial, The Los Angeles Times called 
the initiative ``a gamble California can't afford not to take.'' The 
editorial said: ``While Proposition 10 is far from perfect, it's also 
a bold, worthwhile experiment _ an attempt to solve a genuine social 
problem arriving at just the right time.'' Opponents of the initiative 
say that they also support early childhood development programs but 
that the increase is a regressive tax that will fall hardest on the 
poor and on members of minority groups. It is the argument that the 
tobacco industry used in its campaign against a proposed national 
tobacco settlement. Last week, The San Diego Union-Tribune blasted 
the measure in an editorial: ``Proposition 10 is a ballot box taxation 
at its most insidious.'' The opponents also say that most of the money 
will not go to programs directly related to the effects of smoking, 
and therefore smokers should not have to foot the bill. ``It used 
to be that patriotism was the last refuge of scoundrels,'' said Bill 
Campbell, a former Republican state senator who opposes the initiative. 
``Now children have become the last refuge. Everybody ostensibly wants 
to do something to help children.'' But what Reiner and his allies 
are really doing, Campbell said, is using a lofty goal that everyone 
supports to attack the tobacco industry ``because it's easy pickings.'' 
``People think that the tobacco companies are evil, therefore the 
people who smoke are evil and they ought to be taxed,'' he said. Opponents 
say the proposition is poorly written, provides little accountability 
and will create new layers of bureaucracy eager to control the $700 
million in new revenue. The proposition calls for the creation of 
a state commission and 58 county commissions to oversee and distribute 
the money. Money will be divided among the counties based on the number 
of births a year. Huffington, recruited to the Proposition 10 campaign 
by Reiner, has been traveling to more conservative areas of the state 
to talk about the merits of the initiative. Although Huffington got 
involved in the campaign last February, his commitment to the effort 
intensified a few weeks ago when he learned that doctors had told 
his mother she had lung cancer. His mother started smoking when she 
was a teen-ager and had smoked as many as three packs a day. ``Part 
of her lung was removed a couple of weeks ago,'' Huffington said. 
``We're not sure we got it all.''
