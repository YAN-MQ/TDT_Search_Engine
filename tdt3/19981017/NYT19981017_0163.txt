Back in 1828, when President John Quincy Adams was running for re-election, 
supporters of Andrew Jackson felt compelled to find some way to undermine 
the incumbent's reputation as a terrific diplomat. They settled on 
spreading a story that Adams, who had served as ambassador to Russia, 
had gotten on the czar's good side by offering up his children's nanny 
as a royal mistress. It was not a very convincing story _ anyone who 
looks at Adams' portrait will instantly perceive that this was no 
good-time Charlie. But the president was called ``the Pimp of the 
Coalition'' throughout the campaign, and when Jackson won, he made 
the editor who invented the slander a member of his kitchen cabinet. 
The moral of this story is that there are negative campaigns and then 
there are really, really negative campaigns. This year's U.S. Senate 
race in New York strikes some voters as pretty deep in the mud. Rep. 
Charles Schumer has been calling Sen. Alfonse D'Amato a liar on every 
channel in the state, and D'Amato has been telling upstate voters 
that Schumer cares more about Mongolia than he does about them. Over 
the weekend Schumer unleashed a new ad called ``Mother'' in which 
the narrator starkly announces that ``D'Amato opposes abortion rights 
even in cases of rape and incest, even if the mother would die.'' 
But on a scale of 1 to 10, this one hardly registers a 6. (A 10 would 
be the effort in 1856 to depict the Republican presidential candidate 
as a cannibal.) The defining adjective for the D'Amato-Schumer battle 
is actually not ``negative'' but ``close.'' Most polls show D'Amato 
and Schumer running neck-and-neck, a condition that tends to bring 
out the vicious streak in any candidate. Close and mean is better 
than a gentlemanly runaway any day. New York Gov. George Pataki is 
miles ahead in the polls, and his ads are so sunny they might be mistaken 
for margarine commercials. His campaign consultants spent years training 
to be political Road Warriors, and now they're stuck doing Walt Disney, 
rolling out one production after another in which Pataki appears surrounded 
by children and scenic vistas. If his lead gets any wider, he will 
approach the camera with a puppy at his feet and the Bluebird of Happiness 
circling overhead. The D'Amato-Schumer contest, meanwhile, is a sort 
of Steel Cage Match of politics, in which the last guy standing wins. 
Schumer's ``too many lies'' campaign was fairly effective _ D'Amato's 
gray ethical aura is his weakest spot. But the lying the ad referred 
to was actually just D'Amato's habit of fluffing up his own reputation 
and calling his opponents ``liberal.'' The hyper-cynical voting public 
expects ``lie'' to means something like concealing a criminal record 
or a couple of surplus wives. After casting about from one insult 
to another _ ``liberal'' didn't work, ``from Brooklyn'' was only so-so 
_ D'Amato fell back on the classic ploy of adding up Schumer's missed 
votes. As in the Andrew Jackson campaign, D'Amato's strategists wanted 
to undermine their opponent's proudest boast, and Schumer is running 
on his reputation as an effective legislator. The attack was trivial 
_ you can skip quite a lot in Washington without missing anything. 
But it was fair. Schumer missed the votes, and he has to accept the 
consequences. None of this stuff would get a mention in the annals 
of low moments in political history. It does not even rank very high 
this year, when one Illinois gubernatorial candidate is basically 
calling another a murderer, and in South Carolina, Sen. Ernest Hollings 
just had to apologize for saying his opponent was ``a (expletive deleted) 
skunk.'' But with just two weeks to go until the election, New Yorkers 
deserve something substantial, even if it is delivered in the rhetorical 
equivalent of a screech. Schumer's new ads, while rough, hit an important 
issue, since polls show most voters do not know that D'Amato is a 
staunch opponent of abortion. But the life-of-the-mother element is 
a bit of a stretch _ it is' based mainly on D'Amato's 1983 vote for 
a constitutional amendment that would put the abortion issue back 
under the control of the states. D'Amato's office did not return calls 
about the content of his upcoming ads. (The senator has been avoiding 
me ever since the 1980 campaign, when I asked him to name the last 
five books he had read.) But we are eagerly awaiting the next volley. 
It has been a long time since New York has hosted an election in which 
we did not know the name of the winner weeks before the first absentee 
ballot hit the mails. It is worth hearing a lot of nasty commercials 
to get a contest in which everyone can imagine that his vote might 
really count.
