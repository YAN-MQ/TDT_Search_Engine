Thousands of tourists go every year to the Trinity Church in Copley 
Square for its renowned choir, Tiffany stained-glass windows and 120-year-old 
spires. But Tyler Florence goes there because it is a cool place to 
practice his ollies, grinds and flips. Tyler, 14, took the train from 
Narragansett, R.I., just to skate with eight others on the church 
plaza one summer afternoon. The smooth pavement is perfect for 360-degree 
kick-flips on his skateboard. For jumps, the low, brown sandstone 
steps are almost irresistible. It is a paradise for skateboarders, 
until a police officer tells them to hit the road. ``We're just trying 
to skate and we just get hassled,'' Tyler said. With millions of enthusiasts, 
skateboarding is one of the fastest growing sports in America with 
its own clothing, language and music. And unfortunately for municipalities 
concerned about damage, it is a sport that uses the urban landscape 
as its playing field. Wheelchair ramps, stone steps and metal railings 
are all part of the ``natural terrain.'' ``They're not urban gangsters 
or terrorists who are hell-bent on destroying significant and historic 
locations,'' said Jim Fitzpatrick, executive director of the International 
Association of Skateboard Companies. ``They utilize what's there.'' 
Fran Richards, director of Transworld Skateboard magazine, said: ``Kids 
don't see the world in the same way that adults do. They see a beautiful 
marble ledge as being a great thing to jump off.'' For visitors to 
New England's historic areas, skateboarders are the last thing they 
expect, and the first thing they find. They congregate at Trinity 
Church and on the granite steps of the nation's first Public Library 
across the way. They skate the streets of historic Newport, R.I., 
and the granite steps of the capital building in Montpelier, Vt. All 
of which has the police concerned for public safety, curators worried 
about damage, and some residents just plain annoyed. ``Tourists see 
that and they say these kids can get away with murder,'' said Kent 
Ford, a 61-year-old retiree who lives near the Trinity Church and 
has complained repeatedly to the mayor about the skateboarders. ``I'm 
sorry, that's not the way Boston should be represented.'' The trouble 
is, cities cannot figure out where to put them. Twenty years ago, 
commercial skateboard parks were opened. (In 1976, Fortune magazine 
endorsed skateboard parks as a best bet for entrepreneurs.) But of 
the 200 parks built then, only 2 remain, most closed due to the threat 
of injury lawsuits. ``They didn't realize the cost, the liability,'' 
said Richards, the magazine director. ``Insurers didn't know what 
to charge.'' Now that boarding has been reborn as a street sport, 
some cities, like Boston, are trying to corral their boarders by building 
public skateboard parks, nonprofit areas where skaters can practice. 
Boston has allocated $2.6 million for two parks. There are about 300 
public and quasi-public parks in the United States, a number that 
will double by next summer, Fitzpatrick predicted. But for many towns, 
getting a skate park built is a study in controversy. Skateboard supporters 
in Burlington, Vt., have lobbied for a park there since 1989. Skateboarding 
downtown had become so common that it was declared illegal in some 
areas, with violators facing $50 fines and board confiscation. Yet 
despite the support of the mayor and governor, the skate park measure 
was blocked by residents citing noise and property value concerns. 
In the meantime, a temporary park has been put up on an access road. 
The mayor of Burlington, Peter Clavelle, said he had thought that 
choosing a location for a landfill was the most difficult challenge 
facing a local government official. ``Now I believe that siting a 
skate park is even more challenging,'' he said. Fitzpatrick, who promotes 
parks across the country, likened controlling skaters to ``attempting 
to organize earthworms,'' but said they were a big part of the grass-roots 
effort to get the parks built. Last April, two dozen young skaters 
staged a protest at the Statehouse in Montpelier, Vt., clattering 
their wheels over the steps and demanding that the city move more 
quickly on their request for a park. ``They were definitely adamant 
that they were not going to leave until they got some attention,'' 
said Kermit Spaulding, the sergeant-at-arms for the Statehouse, who 
helped calm the rebels. Despite the damage done to the 160-year-old 
steps, he said he sympathized with them. The City Council has approved 
a park, but needs the $15,000 to build it. But at the Trinity Church, 
few of the skaters planned to abandon their downtown haunts, where 
tourists are a built-in audience, to skate in a designated area. ``You 
want to have a whole lot of people hanging around,'' said Tyler Florence's 
brother, 17-year-old Nate. ``And the ladies like it,'' added his friend, 
Tyler Sparrow. The town of Farmington, Maine, took three years to 
build its park, valued at about $35,000. It was the pet project of 
Steve Shible the city's recreation director, who was so proud of the 
park that he printed up hats with its name, The Dragon's Nest. But 
vandalism and lack of use closed it within two years. Now it's a children's 
park, a slab for toddlers on tricycles. ``The kids that provided the 
original impetus, by the time this thing opened most of those kids 
had changed from skateboarding to cars and girls and everything else,'' 
Shible said. ``It's pretty hard to make out on a skateboard.'' Skateboard 
advocates argue that, through the exposure of MTV and ESPN's X Games, 
individual-oriented sports like skateboarding cannot be shrugged off 
as a fad anymore. They have evolved into a staple of 90's recreation. 
``It's a freedom of expression thing,'' said Sid Abruzzi, who has 
owned a skateboard shop in Newport, R.I., since 1971, and is a skateboarder. 
He said he ``doesn't have anyone saying `I'm sorry, you didn't make 
the team.''' Tyler Florence agreed: ``You can only play Little League 
for so long. You get tired of the coaches.'' Skate park advocates 
look with hope to California, the mecca of the sport, where a recently 
enacted law absolves cities from liability by placing skateboarding 
in the same category of ``at your own risk'' sports as surfing and 
spelunking. That would be fine for Tyler Sparrow, whose hometown park 
requires skaters to wear protective pads. Sparrow, showing an elbow 
sticky with blood and a two-inch lump on his head, does not think 
pads are very cool. ``I slammed into a wall,'' he said, referring 
to his lack of a helmet. John Clift, director of facilities at Trinity 
Church, has nothing personal against the skateboarders. He just wishes 
the black that edges the steps were the honest scuff off the shoes 
of parishioners, not skateboard wax. ``These are not repairs that 
you can sort of fix,'' he said. ``It's just permanent damage.''
