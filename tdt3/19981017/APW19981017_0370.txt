A senior Turkish official met with Iraq's oil minister Saturday at 
the start of talks aimed at boosting trade despite tensions over Kurdish 
rebels and the sharing of river waters. Mehmet Batalli, a state minister 
with special responsibility for Iraqi affairs, met with Oil Minister 
Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid, the official Iraqi News Agency said. 
It gave no details. ``The visit reflects a desire by Turkey to boost 
volume of economic and commercial exchanges to highest levels possible,'' 
INA quoted Batalli as saying. Batalli, the state minister for atomic 
energy and state statistics, is heading a large trade delegation. 
His visit follows Iraq's recent warning that neighboring Turkey will 
lose business deals under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal if it 
carries out military threats against Syria. Turkey accuses Syria of 
harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels. Syria denies it. Turkey has sold 
Iraq goods worth dlrs 230 million since the oil program began in December 
1996. However, Turkey says it has lost billions of dollars as a result 
of the trade sanctions the United Nations imposed on Iraq for invading 
Kuwait in 1990. The issue of Kurdish rebels also has chilled Turkey's 
relations with Iraq. Turkish troops frequently enter northern Iraq 
to pursue rebels who use the area as a base for attacking targets 
in southern Turkey. Iraq also criticizes Turkey for hosting U.S. and 
British warplanes that enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq to 
help keep the Iraqi army at bay. In addition, the two countries disagree 
on sharing waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. In a sign of 
the sour relations, state-run Iraqi newspapers ignored Batalli's arrival 
Friday, and Iraqi authorities did not invite Western news organizations 
to cover the visit.
