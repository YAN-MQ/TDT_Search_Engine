A juggler who was convicted of robbing and killing a woman in 1996 
has been hanged in the kingdom's third execution this year, Jordanian 
prison officials said Saturday. Mustafa Abdul Mustafa, 47, was hanged 
Thursday at the Swaqa prison, 75 kilometers (45 miles) south of Amman, 
prison supervisor Col. Sa'ad Ajram told The Associated Press. Mustafa, 
a self-proclaimed healer, was sentenced to death in March for killing 
Heigar Ali in his home on Feb. 8, 1996. He had lured her with a promise 
to cure her stomach pain with herbal medicine. According to police, 
Mustafa gave Ali, 44, a poison-laced drink that killed her in four 
minutes. He then took the dead woman's gold bracelets and burned her 
body in the desert to conceal the crime. The case had caused a stir 
in Jordan where crime is rare and murders even more so. Muslims, who 
bury their dead, consider burning bodies a sacrilege. Before being 
hanged, Mustafa requested his relatives to take care of his two wives 
and 14 children, Col. Ajram said.
