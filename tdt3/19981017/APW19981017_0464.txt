Mark O'Meara thrashed defending champion Vijay Singh 11 and 10 Saturday 
to reach the final of the World Match Play Championship and set a 
new record for the most lopsided win in the 34-year-old tournament. 
In the other semifinal, O'Meara's Florida neighbor and friend Tiger 
Woods held a four-hole lead on Lee Westwood after 28 holes with a 
final looming between the two Americans. The start of play Saturday 
was delayed 2 1/2 hours by rain with organizers doubtful the Woods-Westwood 
match would be completed before darkness if it went the full 36 holes. 
In that case, the match would be completed early Sunday before the 
start of the final, which is worth 170,000 pounds (dlrs 289,000) to 
the winner. The previous record was set in 1978 when Tom Watson defeated 
Dale Hayes 11 and 9. On Friday, Singh was 11 up after 21 holes against 
Patrik Sjoland but went on to advance 7 and 6. O'Meara, this year's 
Masters and British Open champion, had nine birdies in his first 18 
with birdie putts of 36 (12 meters), 18 (6 meters), 12 (4 meters) 
and 10 feet (3 meters). He was 11 up after getting a par on the 20th 
and went to 12 up with another par on 21. Singh _ this year's U.S. 
PGA champion _ recovered to only 11 down with a birdie on the 22nd, 
but O'Meara closed out the match when they halved the 26th with pars. 
For 26 holes, O'Meara had nine birdies, all in the first 18. Singh 
had trouble with his usually good iron game, and his short game and 
putting wasn't much better. ``It was just one of those days when everything 
went right for Mark O'Meara. To beat Vijay Singh, who is a world-class 
player, 11 and 10. It was definitely my day.'' ``It was one of those 
rounds where I was in the zone,'' O'Meara added. ``Sixty-three with 
a double-bogey is more than I could ask for.'' O'Meara said he'd prefer 
to play Woods in the final, which would be just another of their friendly 
matches _ this time, for more money. ``We play a lot together,'' O'Meara 
said. ``He (Woods) has been playing pretty well at home. I think he 
took 30 bucks off me the last time we played.'' ``I'm pretty smart,'' 
he went on. ``I'm no idiot. I go to the putting green afterwards and 
try to go nine, double-or-nothing. I can usually win my money back 
on the putting green.'' Woods had to struggle. He was down by three 
holes after the first seven _ due to Westwood's good putting and his 
poor putting and iron play. But he rallied to win the 10th with a 
par, the 13th with a birdie (12 footer/4 meters) and squared with 
another birdie on the 16th with a short putt. He took the lead on 
the 502-yard 18th when he got on in two and down in two. Westwood 
hit a bunker on his drive, another bunker at the edge of the green 
on his second and needed three to get down from there. He went four 
up through 28 with birdies on four holes, getting two of them with 
8-foot (2.5 meters) putts and one on the 28th with a 25-footer (8 
meters). In Friday's quarterfinals, Singh defeated Patrik Sjoland 
7 and 6, O'Meara won over Colin Montgomerie 5 and 4, Westwood beat 
three-time champion Ernie Els 2 and 1, and Woods defeated Ian Woosnam 
1-up on the 37th hole _ the first of a sudden-death playoff. Woods 
said after Friday's tight win _ and anticipating a tough match with 
Westwood _ he wasn't banking on a final against O'Meara. ``I have 
my work cut out... and Mark has his work cut out for him,'' said the 
flu-ridden Woods, who has been fighting the bug since he arrived in 
Britain last week for the Dunhill Cup.
