The songwriting duo who penned the music to "the lion king" now updates 
a Classic set in ancient Egypt. Jim Moret reports on Elton John It 
is "aida" as you've never seen it before. The love triangle between 
the would-be leader of ancient Egypt, the daughter of pharaoh and 
an enslaved nubian princess has been updated, courtesy of Elton John 
and Tim rice, the same Oscar-winning songwriting duo responsible for 
the soundtrack to Disney's "the lion king," as well as the smash Broadway 
play. Obviously, there is the opera by Verdi, which is very, very 
solemn and very operatic and very kind of theatrical. This is also 
very theatrical, but it's very, very -- I would say very camp and 
more along the lines of a "dreamgirls" or a "rocky horror show." No 
expectations oh why The 19 new songs range from ballads to rock 'N' 
roll. "Elaborate lives" is another Disney production bound for Broadway, 
but staged first in Atlanta as a joint Venture between Walt Disney 
theatrical productions and the nonprofit alliance theater company. 
The opera and the musical was written here in Atlanta. I live here, 
and so that meant that I could, by staging it at the alliance theater, 
I could come and check on it during rehearsals. You know, it just 
tied in very nicely. It's a beautiful theater. Elton John attended 
a $1,000-A-person preshow cocktail party sunday night to raise money 
for the Elton John AIDS foundation. It is one of many fund-raising 
efforts. Last year, he brought in nearly $500,000 by selling thousands 
of outfits from his extensive wardrobe. He also stages an annual tennis 
tournament and a celebrity-studded academy awards bash, and recently 
introduced for sale "Elton 2," a slatkin and company scented candle. 
Picked the fragrance out myself. Here we are, Ginger mango. And it's 
available now, and you can get smaller candles, bigger candles, dinner 
table ones. Since 1992, John's foundation has funded more than $15 
million internationally for direct patient services and education, 
which is now becoming a major focus of the organization. We want to 
get to younger people earlier, to try to get into the schools, to 
tell people what's going on. And if you hit people when they're younger, 
they do listen. If nothing else, Elton John compels people to listen. 
Now, theatergoers can hear his new take on an age-old story. It's 
a very modern-day thing. It's not going to appeal to everybody. It's 
not going to appeal to, you know, the stuffy theater critic, but the 
people En masse, I think they'll love it. Jim Moret, "CNN Entertainment 
News," Atlanta.
