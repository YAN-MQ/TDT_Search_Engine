NATO has extended by ten days the deadline for the withdrawal of yugoslavian 
forces from the province of Kosovo. Officials say NATO warplanes will 
remain ready for air strikes if yugoslavia does not end its crackdown 
on ethnic Albanians. Yugoslavia agreed Friday to let 2,000 unarmed 
monitors into Kosovo. They will check to see that Yugoslavian President 
Slobodan Milosevic is keeping his cease-fire agreement.
