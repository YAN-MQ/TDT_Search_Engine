Diego Maradona used to undergo private drug tests ahead of soccer 
matches to be sure he would not turn in positive results if tested 
by the Italian League, the former Napoli star said in an interview 
published Saturday. Maradona was banned in 1991 for 15 months after 
testing positive for cocaine while playing for Napoli. But the Italian 
news agency ANSA reported Friday that the backup urine sample that 
led to the suspension was conducted on a faulty machine. The report, 
based on sources at the scandal-ridden Acqua Acetosa drug-testing 
laboratory in Rome, alleged that the apparatus erroneously indicated 
there were traces of cocaine in a clean urine control sample run through 
in a check in 1991. Maradona's lawyers have said they may pursue legal 
action. ``If it is proven that there was an irregularity in the anti-doping 
test that led to Maradona's suspension, we will ask for a review of 
the judgement and we will pursue symbolic compensation for damages,'' 
Maradona attorney Vincenzo Siniscalchi said. ``That suspension was 
an injustice.'' In the interview with Naples newspaper Il Mattino, 
the player said ``I have never denied'' using cocaine, ``but when 
I went on the field I was clean.'' ``I knew for certain that I could 
not be discovered positive, because before every game I would take 
private tests,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying. ``If these allowed 
me to play without any worry, without compromising my career or harming 
the club, then I would go on the field. If the opposite were true, 
then I stayed at home.'' He said that is why ``I have always had suspicions 
about the testing done in Rome.''
