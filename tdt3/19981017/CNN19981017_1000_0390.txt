Journalists get low marks for integrity from Americans responding 
to a Survey by the freedom forum media studies center. It covered 
both general media ethics and five high-profile cases. 88% of those 
responding said they believe reporters often or sometimes use illegal 
or unethical techniques, 76% said journalists often or sometimes plagiarize 
material and 66% said they believe stories are fabricated, then published 
as real.
