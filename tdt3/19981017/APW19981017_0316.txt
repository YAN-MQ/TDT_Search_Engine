Ahead of talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Taiwan's top negotiator 
expressed optimism Saturday that trust can be built up between the 
two rival governments. Koo Chen-fu's meeting Sunday with Jiang was 
to cap a visit that has helped thaw contacts after a three-year hiatus 
and secured agreement to explore resumed negotiations. Speaking at 
a reception Saturday evening, Koo said that through his visit, China 
and Taiwan ``can promote and build important foundations of mutual 
trust that the two sides were lacking.'' Taiwan and China have a rivalry 
that dates back five decades to the Chinese civil war, and as recently 
as 1996 China was seeking to intimidate the island by testing missiles 
off its waters. The atmosphere at Sunday's meeting in the luxurious 
confines of Beijing's Diaoyutai state guest house should be brightened 
by the agreement Koo secured earlier this week for China and Taiwan 
to work toward resuming formal negotiations. Beijing suspended those 
talks in 1995, in anger over a trip by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui 
to the United States. China viewed the visit as an affront to its 
claims of sovereignty over Taiwan and as a sign that Lee was leading 
the island toward independence. Beijing responded by test-firing missiles 
and holding war games near Taiwan, and by suspending negotiations. 
As China's top leader, Jiang oversaw that crisis, which pushed the 
two sides closer to war than they had been in decades. By agreeing 
to meet Koo during this visit, Jiang appeared to be signaling a desire 
for some degree of rapprochement. Jiang is under pressure from the 
powerful Chinese military and communist old guard to get Taiwan to 
agree to reunification with the Chinese mainland. The island has been 
separated politically from the mainland since Taiwan's Nationalist 
government fled there after losing the Chinese civil war to China's 
Communists in 1949. Koo went sightseeing Saturday, visiting a memorial 
to Chinese nationalist Sun Yat-sen, the prestigious Beijing University, 
and the Forbidden City, the former residence of China's emperors. 
On Sunday, before his sit-down with Jiang, Koo was also due to meet 
Vice Premier Qian Qichen, a former foreign minister. In a sign of 
the lingering distrust between Taiwan and China, Taiwan's vice foreign 
minister, David Lee, claimed Saturday that Qian had recently ordered 
Chinese diplomats to step up efforts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. 
Lee quoted Qian as having called for a ``face-to-face struggle'' with 
Taiwan to lure away its dwindling number of diplomatic partners. Just 
27 countries now recognize Taiwan, with most having switched recognition 
to Beijing. Lee called on China to clarify Qian's remarks. ``We hope 
the mainland authorities will respond to our goodwill and sincerity 
with the same goodwill and sincerity,'' he said at a news conference.
