Vinny Testaverde has come through the trial-by-fire, and so far Glenn 
Foley has not. That was the gist Friday of New York Jets coach Bill 
Parcells' analysis of Foley, the younger, less experienced and more 
vulnerable of the two, who has now been relegated to the bench. Testaverde 
will start Monday night against the New England Patriots in Foxboro, 
Mass., where the anti-Jets' sentiment will be fervent and emotions 
boiling. This is for bragging rights, a division game that pits an 
ascending Patriots team against a wannabe Jets outfit coached by the 
former New England coach. That it is a division game and will significantly 
affect each team's playoff hopes only adds to the drama. In a candid 
analysis of the Foley situation, Parcells at first spoke in a parable. 
But then, as he warmed to the subject of how a person emerges from 
trouble, he specifically cited Foley and his difficulties. Foley has 
been demoted following his mistake-filled performance against the 
Rams last Sunday, when he completed only 5 of 15 passes, was intercepted 
twice, and fumbled once. He had been returning from a rib injury. 
``Lookit, I've said it five times this year,'' Parcells said. ``You 
don't find you out if you can play in this league until what happened 
to Glenn happens. Where do you go from there? For up until that point 
you hadn't been the guy. You were always the other guy. Suddenly, 
you're the guy _ `You mean me?''' ``You mean me?'' is a favored expression 
Parcells uses when talking about second-stringers who suddenly get 
their chance. Until then, they do not get blamed, they have less pressure. 
Suddenly, the coach is pointing his finger at them and the reply is, 
``You mean me?'' Trying to relate it to writing a newspaper story, 
Parcells added: ``You've got your first opportunity to show your wares. 
You're probably going to be your biggest critic. But you're also going 
to be scrutinized by some other people for the first time. There's 
going to be opinions expressed. Some of them may not be favorable. 
You are going to have to deal with things as a writer. I would assume 
at some time a writer gets chewed out. And if it's not going too well, 
or if the editor doesn't like you, or something's going on that makes 
him opinionated about you, you're going to have to respond in a certain 
manner. ``There's going to be times when good things happened and 
everyone's with you and it's going great,'' he continued. ``And there's 
going to be times when it's not going so good.'' Then, jumping back 
to quarterbacks, Parcells said: ``So you don't find out what you've 
got till you're beat up, knocked down, thrown some interceptions. 
And what can you do about it? And you know what? There's not a lot 
who can do a lot about it.'' It appears Parcells' opinion of Foley 
is still being formed. For now, it is less than favorable. Does he 
want to see how Foley reacts to his benching? ``You never know until 
a player goes through it and comes out the other end,'' Parcells said. 
``In Vinny's case, no one had to go through it worse than he did.'' 
The Foley situation reminded Parcells of the undefeated fighter who 
suddenly gets knocked out. He is never the same after that. So how 
will Foley react to this knockout? ``It's still early to draw conclusions,'' 
Parcells said. ``Maybe the opportunity hasn't been ample enough. I'll 
say this. This guy who's playing quarterback now has gone through 
the process that Glenn is going through now.'' Foley would not comment. 
EXTRA POINTS _ The Jets' special teams will undergo extensive renovations 
with the absence of CHAD CASCADDEN and FRED BAXTER, both injured. 
CRAIG POWELL, the linebacker picked up during the week, will see action 
on the unit. _ The Patriots' cornerback TY LAW, who will be matched 
against KEYSHAWN JOHNSON, has four interceptions. He leads the American 
Conference. No receiver has caught a pass longer than 18 yards against 
him this season. _ The Patriots lost only two home games last season 
_ to the Packers and the Steelers. New England is 3-0 at Foxboro this 
year.
