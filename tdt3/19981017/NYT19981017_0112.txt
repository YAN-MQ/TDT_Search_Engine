The Atlanta Braves are not playing in New York this weekend, which 
means they are not playing in the World Series for the third time 
in their seven-season run as division champions and therefore cannot 
seek victory in the World Series for the sixth time in their seven-season 
run as division champions. Although the Braves remain the most consistently 
good team of the '90s, the enduringly best actually since the 1949-64 
Yankees, something has to be missing from the mix that gets them to 
the post-season year after year, at least something that rears its 
ugly head in October. Conversations with officials from several other 
clubs elicited views that could explain the Braves' problem. ``One 
thing the Braves have that no one else has is depth in the starting 
rotation,'' said Dave Dombrowski, the Marlins' general manager. ``Over 
a 162-game season, that is very difficult to beat. I don't think you 
can beat them unless you match up the same way. ``But in a short series 
most clubs you're playing are going to throw three quality starters 
at you. The fifth starter is not a factor. The fourth starter may 
or may not be a factor.'' The rest of the team, however, falls short 
of their pitching in championship status, another general manager 
said. ``They're not that good a club if you take away their starting 
pitching,'' said the general manager, who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity. ``If you put their starting pitching on several National 
League clubs, those clubs would be better. Their bullpen is ordinary 
at best. Their defense is average at best. If they don't hit home 
runs, they're going to struggle because they're not going to score. 
They've done it with starting pitching and timely hitting for years.'' 
An executive of another club suggested that the Braves spend so much 
money on their starting pitchers they don't have much left to spend 
on their hitting. ``Maybe they have four good hitters,'' he said. 
``If the other team's pitching can neutralize those hitters, they 
can beat them. If you pitch well against them, you have a good chance 
of beating them because their offense and their bench aren't that 
great. If you match up with starting pitching, you can neutralize 
their power.'' The Padres' pitchers did their part, shutting down 
most of the Braves' key hitters. Galarraga had two hits in 21 at-bats 
for a .095 batting average and four runs batted in. Ryan Klesko had 
one hit in 12 tries (.083). Chipper Jones batted a relatively torrid 
.208 but drove in a single run, matching Klesko's output. In the league 
series, Andy Ashby held the Braves to 1 run in 7 innings in the first 
game, Kevin Brown shut them out on 3 hits in the second and Sterling 
Hitchcock stymied them in 2 starts, allowing 1 run and 5 hits in 10 
innings. Also, defensive breakdowns at critical moments hurt the Braves 
in the league series against Florida last October, and a relative 
flood of errors killed them in the league series against San Diego 
this year. From the double error by Andres Galarraga on one play in 
the first game to Danny Bautista's muffed catch of a fly ball in the 
last, the Braves self-destructed in the series that sent the Padres 
to New York this weekend. Eight errors in six games is not the formula 
for post-season success. ``There are no perfect clubs,'' Dombrowski 
observed. But he added, ``You tip your cap to the Braves because they're 
there every year.'' Gerry Hunsicker, Houston's general manager, has 
experienced the post-season the past two seasons and wasn't ready 
to find fault with the Braves for their latest loss. He gave credit 
to the Padres, who also defeated the Astros in the division series. 
``I think the Padres were an overlooked team coming into the playoffs,'' 
Hunsicker said. ``They were underrated. This is a team that for four 
and a half months was arguably the best team in the National League. 
Suddenly, in September, they had a slide and everybody forgot about 
them. We got Randy Johnson and the hype got carried away. The impact 
Randy would have on our team was overexaggerated.'' While everyone 
was expecting great things from the Astros and the Braves, Hunsicker 
said, people were underrating the Padres' pitching. ``They have quality 
starters and the best closer in baseball,'' he said. ``In low-scoring 
games, if your pitching is going to keep you in the game, then it's 
just a matter of who rises to the occasion. This season it happens 
to be Jim Leyritz. Right now, Jim Leyritz is playing like Superman.''
