Gene Randall reports. In the rose garden, President Clinton, basking 
in the glow of thursday's budget agreement. Republicans, too, call 
the accord a victory for the American people. Neither party brings 
up the pursuit of pork, one nurtured by prospects of a Budget surplus. 
It's like watching pigs line up at the trough and gobble up our tax 
dollars. Republican house speaker Newt Gingrich got $400 million for 
seven new C-130 military cargo planes, manufactured in by Lockheed-Martin 
of marietta, Georgia, Gingrich territory. The Pentagon says it doesn't 
need the planes. Republican James Walsh of New York pushed a $10 million 
item to help pay a Tariff on Italian wool, a boon to tailors in his 
district. On the democratic side -- Zoe lofgren of California is waiting 
to see if she'll get $16 million for flood control on a home district 
Creek. For another California democrat, Vic Fazio, who is retiring, 
$1.75 million for something called the Gridley rice straw project, 
designed to convert rice into ethanol. Which is, as far as I can tell, 
not a huge benefit for the entire country, just for a very small group 
of people in congressman Fazio's district. In the Senate -- republican 
Thad Cochran of Mississippi is expected to get $385 million for his 
state's chicken farmers. His GOP colleague, Pat Roberts of Kansas, 
$6 million for a public policy center to be named for former senator 
Bob Dole. And, oh yes, remember the infamous mohair subsidy? Well, 
five years after it was killed, it appears it is back. While there 
is all kinds of other headlines about the impeachment, the stock market, 
members of Congress are very quietly slipping these items into the 
bills. Of course, until a formal budget is approved by Congress and 
signed by the president, none of this is set in stone. But then, pork 
rarely is. Gene Randall, CNN, Washington.
