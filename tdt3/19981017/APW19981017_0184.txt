A determined Mark Woodforde of Australia fought back from one set 
down in his semifinal match at the dlrs 700,000 Singapore Open indoor 
tennis tournament on Saturday to advance into his first singles finals 
in four years. Woodforde, better known for his doubles play on the 
world's second-ranked team, defeated Dutchman Sjeng Schalken 0-6, 
6-4, 6-2. He will meet top-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile in the final 
of the ATP tour event on Sunday. The Australian overcame a drubbing 
in the first set, succumbing to what he described as ``impatient'' 
play, as Schalken broke his serve three times to take six games consecutively. 
But Woodforde regained his confidence in the next two sets, using 
an inspired variety of slices, drop-shots and lobs to dictate the 
pace of play. He broke his Dutch opponent in the tenth and final game 
of the second set to pull even. Moving smoothly around the court, 
Woodforde put together an impressive array of passing and drop shots 
in the deciding set. Schalken misjudged a lunging lob from the Australian 
in the critical fourth game of the final set that broke the Dutchman's 
serve, and Woodforde quickly finished his opponent off with another 
break to take the set and match. Singles world number three Marcelo 
Rios manhandled American Jim Courier in the other semifinal. The top 
seed took a mere 55 minutes of nearly flawless play to win 6-2, 6-1. 
The two former world number one players entered the tournament in 
very different standings, with Courier a wild card and Rios the clear 
favorite. ``I felt really good, and I didn't give him any chance,'' 
said a matter-of-fact Rios, who predicts victory on Sunday. The Chilean 
saved all five break points Courier was able to manage against his 
serve, and converted five of his eight break points against the hapless 
American.
