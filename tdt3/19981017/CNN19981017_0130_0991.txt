The fed's decision to cut interest rates, good news for potential 
home buyers. Terry Keenan reports. Just maybe, close this door down. 
I will do that, right. For uliks fehmiu, who is about to buy this 
apartment, Thursday's announcement of a rate cut by the federal reserve 
should mean big savings on his mortgage payments. With several weeks 
to go before he locks in his mortgage, fehmiu is betting mortgage 
rates will follow the fed's fund rate lower. Great, great. I will 
be able to, you know, spend the same money someplace else, you know, 
some better way. In normal times that would be a safe bet, but in 
recent weeks, the global financial turmoil has hit home, sending mortgage 
rates on an unprecedented upward spiral. In a 48-hour period last 
week, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage exploded from 6 1/2% 
to more than 7%, where it sits today. There was a large Spike in interest 
rates last week. And people, you know, read that and heard it in the 
news and, you know, people -- a lot of people were sitting on the 
fence waiting for rates to go lower, and all of a sudden got a little 
scared. More frustrating for those shopping for a mortgage -- the 
wild gyrations in rates have little to do with their hometown bank. 
Gone are the days depicted in the movie "it's a wonderful life," when 
small-town lenders set mortgage rates. Today, those rates are set 
at trading desks like this, where mortgages are bundled together and 
traded on a minute-by-minute basis. As panic gripped the markets in 
recent weeks, traders dumped their mortgage-backed securities. And 
for that reason alone, mortgage rates soared. It's this type of ripple 
effect that the fed hopes to fix by cutting rates. This was actually 
an interest rate cut that may have been stimulated by the problems 
in Wall Street, but really is aimed at main street. But economists 
warn there is no quick fix. And many believe the fed will have to 
cut rates several more times before there is a sustained impact on 
mortgage and other consumer rates. Terry Keenan, CNN, New York.
