Arab legislators in Israel's Parliament will support any agreement 
that emerges from ongoing talks between Yasser Arafat and Benjamin 
Netanyahu, a leading Israeli Arab politician said Saturday. But Abdel-Wahab 
Daraoushe of the Arab Democratic Party indicated that the support 
may not amount to much, saying it is doubtful Prime Minister Netanyahu 
will implement a future agreement. ``We have faith in the Palestinian 
Authority and will support their decisions'' in Israel's Parliament, 
Knesset, Daraoushe said. ``But I do not have faith in Netanyahu and 
(Foreign Minister Ariel) Sharon's readiness to implement any agreement 
signed with the Arabs,'' he added. Daraoushe was speaking to reporters 
after he and other Arab lawmakers from Israel met with Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak to discuss the role of Israeli Arabs in expediting the 
peace process. Arafat and Netanyahu are holding intense discussions 
in a secluded retreat in Maryland in the hopes of reaching a West 
Bank accord that will include a crucial anti-terrorist agreement. 
Daraoushe criticized the expected agreement, saying it ``is less than 
what the Palestinians ask for.'' ``But given the current situation 
... there are no options before Arafat but to sign this agreement,'' 
Daraoushe said. Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa have also 
expressed concern that Arafat has been pressured into making too many 
concessions in the U.S.-brokered negotiations. Daraoushe said his 
talks with Mubarak and Moussa focused on bolstering the Israeli-Arab 
role in the Knesset and ``influencing the Israeli government to implement 
the agreements'' with the Palestinians. There are about 1 million 
Arabs in Israel, making up about 18 percent of the country's population. 
The 120-member Knesset has 11 Arabs _ eight Muslims, two Christians 
and one Druse _ representing Arab and other opposition parties.
