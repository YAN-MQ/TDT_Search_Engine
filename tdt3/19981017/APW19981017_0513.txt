Russia's foreign minister said Saturday that other countries were 
increasingly coming around to support Russia's insistence on a negotiated 
settlement to the crisis in Kosovo, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov was quoted as saying that ``the more 
acute the situation in the Balkans, the more numerous our partners 
who realize the need for our participation in the settlement process 
in this region.'' ``Only a naive person can hope that a combat operation 
can solve a problem that has not been solved for centuries,'' he said. 
Russia staunchly opposes NATO's proposed airstrikes on Serbia, with 
which it shares common Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian religion. 
Russia's Defense Ministry has said it might help Serbia with weapons 
if NATO strikes. NATO on Friday gave Yugoslavia more time to fulfill 
a peace pledge and avoid airstrikes on separatist Kosovo. On Saturday, 
a Yugoslav official said President Slobodan Milosevic will withdraw 
his Serb-led forces in time to meet the new deadline. Meanwhile, the 
speaker of the lower house of parliament on Saturday rejected a suggestion 
by ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky that Serbia, the leading 
republic in Yugoslavia, join in an alliance with Russia and Belarus. 
Zhirinovsky made the proposal on Wednesday, the Interfax news agency 
said. ``It is outrageous to interfere in Yugoslavia's affairs and 
try to pull out one of its republics,'' ITAR-Tass quoted parliamentary 
speaker Gennady Seleznyov as saying. ``It is hard for a sober-minded 
person to grasp this idea.''
