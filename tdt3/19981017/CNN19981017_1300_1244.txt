Rob Ticktin, "Headline Sports." Take all the speculation and prepare 
to throw it out the window. At 8:00 eastern tonight, the New York 
Yankees and San Diego padres open up the 94th world series. While 
New York won an A.L. record 114 victories this season, tonight, they 
face Kevin brown. The right hander's 12-3 career record against the 
Yankees is tops among active pitchers. The key is, you know, as a 
pitcher, you're trying to find a way to get guys out with what you 
have in the day. And, uh -- you know, it has been a while since I 
faced most of these guys over here anyhow. So, I don't know if there's 
any real advantage one way or the other. They can be beat. We just 
have to be at the top of our game to beat them. Hopefully he'll make 
some mistakes and we'll be able to capitalize on them. Although I 
don't think he'll make too much. We have been living on our pitching 
all year. It has held true during the postseason. New York already 
picked up a moral victory yesterday, when teammate Darryl Strawberry 
was released from the hospital. The 36-year-old Strawberry underwent 
surgery for colon cancer and is cancer free.
