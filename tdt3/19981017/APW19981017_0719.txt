PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and an 
advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived Saturday, 
as efforts to ensure Yugoslavia pulls its forces back advanced in 
the air and on the ground. A day after NATO gave President Slobodan 
Milosevic 10 more days to fulfill a peace pledge, Serbs and ethnic 
Albanian rebels blamed each other in new shooting attacks, including 
one that killed three Serb police Saturday night. But Western officials 
said there were signs the government was gradually complying with 
international demands aimed at ending the turmoil. While its warplanes 
stand by in case Milosevic breaks his word, NATO began an aerial surveillance 
mission by sending U-2 planes high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day 
in the southern Balkans. Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights 
on Thursday as part of the package of agreements worked out to end 
the turmoil in the secessionist province of Serbia. After the first 
planes had returned, a White House official said they found ``clear 
indications'' Milosevic is pulling back at least two of seven force 
battalions as demanded by NATO commander Wesley Clarke on Thursday. 
They also showed improved access for humanitarian and relief workers. 
Hours before its four-day grace period for Milosevic to fully comply 
in order to avoid airstrikes was to expire Saturday morning, NATO 
extended it until Oct. 27. Clarke returns to Belgrade on Monday to 
reinforce to Yugoslav officials that the threat of attack ``remains 
alive,'' said the White House official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. An advance team of specialists for the mission of 2,000 
ground monitors arrived in Yugoslavia on Saturday to do setup work. 
Thirteen staffers flew into Belgrade and another small group arrived 
in Kosovo from Bosnia later. ``We're going to look for the mother 
of all buildings,'' said Peter Erben, the head of the Bosnia team, 
alluding to one of the main likely problems of the mission _ finding 
enough living and working space. American diplomat William Graham 
Walker was appointed Saturday to head the new mission by the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman 
for the 54-nation OSCE, said in Vienna, Austria, that the group hopes 
to have a sizable number of monitors in place in Kosovo in two weeks. 
Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven months 
of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, 
and more than 300,000, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been displaced 
from their homes. In one of the worst incidents this month, three 
Serb policemen were found killed late Saturday after what their colleagues 
said was a KLA grenade attack on the house they occupied along a main 
Kosovo road in Orlate, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of Pristina. 
Two other police were seriously wounded, they said. Reporters who 
drove by the house saw the Serbs' bloodied bodies on the second floor 
of the house. The Serb Media Center claimed earlier that KLA ``extremists'' 
had staged more than a dozen attacks on Serb forces across Kosovo 
since late Friday, using machine guns, mortars and grenades and wounding 
at least two Serbs. ``That's what they are trying to do _ use the 
agreement to open fire on us,'' said A Serb police commander at the 
police checkpoint at Dragobilje said the rebels are trying to ``use 
the agreement to open fire on us.'' ``They want to provoke us into 
a response, and get NATO to attack,'' said the commander, who goes 
by the nom de guerre Baja. The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs for 
at least two of the ncidents, saying police in Vranjevac had opened 
fire, hitting several Albanian houses and a car. Many refugees have 
been afraid to return to their homes because of the continuing presence 
of Serb police forces. But aid workers and U.S. officials have reported 
a steady return in the last few days. Humanitarian organizations have 
stepped up efforts to get aid to the refugees before winter sets in.
