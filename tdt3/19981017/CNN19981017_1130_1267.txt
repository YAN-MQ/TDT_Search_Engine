Well, it's Saturday, and that means college football. A couple of 
early games on the slate, including the top-ranked Ohio state buckeyes. 
They're hosting Minnesota at the Horseshoe. The 6-0 badgers travel 
to champagne to face 2-4 Illinois. Number 13 Georgia will try to pick 
up from that deflating loss last week to tennessee against Vanderbilt 
today. And later this afternoon, it's a battle of undefeateds as number 
two UCLA hosts 12th-ranked Oregon.
