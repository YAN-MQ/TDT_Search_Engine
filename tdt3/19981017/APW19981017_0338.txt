Police on Saturday detained hundreds of members of a pro-Kurdish party 
who were urging the government to join a Kurdish rebel cease-fire, 
a party official said. The government rejected the truce declared 
by the Kurdish rebels on Sept. 1 and called on the guerrillas to surrender. 
The insurgents have been fighting for autonomy in the southeast since 
1984 in a war that has claimed 37,000 lives. ``The first step toward 
an end in this war is to silence the guns,'' Hamit Geylani, general-secretary 
of the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party, HADEP, told The Associated 
Press. ``Our members were to call on the government to take a positive 
step.'' The semi-official Anatolia news agency said the riot police 
stopped 10 passenger buses carrying HADEP members to downtown Taksim 
square and detained them before they could stage a rally. Geylani 
said some 1,000 party members were detained by the police and that 
some 20 of them were injured by wielding police truncheons. Private 
NTV television put the number of detentions at 500 people. The Anatolia 
news agency confirmed that a fist-fight broke out between the police 
officers and the protesters but did not give any injury figure. Also 
on Saturday, police detained 39 people protesting the disappearance 
of loved ones believed to be in police custody in Istanbul and in 
Aegean port city of Izmir. Turkey's independent Human Rights Association 
claims more than 800 people have disappeared, most after detention 
by security forces.
