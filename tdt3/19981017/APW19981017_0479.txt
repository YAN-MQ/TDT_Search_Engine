An American has been charged with killing a German couple and paying 
three Dominicans to bury their bodies in front of their home in this 
Caribbean country, police said Saturday. Peter and Barbara Herman 
were reported missing a month ago when they did not make a planned 
trip to Germany, said police spokesman Col. Simon Diaz. Their bodies 
were found buried in the sand in front of their home in Juan Dolio, 
a tourism-based town about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Santo 
Domingo. Police have arrested a U.S. citizen, Dennis Manley, 46, and 
charged him with murdering the two Germans. Investigators were led 
to Manley after they questioned Martin de la Rosa Laureano, a Dominican 
who worked for the victims, said Diaz. De la Rosa told police he witnessed 
the killing and Manley paid him and two other men, brothers Socimo 
and Ramon Castro, 20,000 Dominican pesos (dlrs 1,300 U.S.) each to 
bury the bodies. ``Dennis Manley has not confessed to the crime, but 
according to the statements by Martin de la Rosa Laureano, the American 
killed the couple with a shot to the head and they were buried in 
the sand in front of the house where the Germans lived,'' said Diaz. 
Police are still unsure of the motive for the crime or exactly when 
it occurred. Information on the hometowns of the Germans and the American 
was not available from police.
