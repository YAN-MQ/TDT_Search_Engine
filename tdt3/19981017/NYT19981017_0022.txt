The shake-up in the executive suite at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. continued 
Friday as the brokerage firm announced that it had replaced the head 
of its global debt business. Merrill named G. Kelly Martin, 39, as 
chief of the debt business, replacing Seth Waugh, who will become 
Martin's deputy. Waugh had been co-head of the 1,900-employee global 
debt unit since 1997. The change was the second in as many days at 
the firm. On Thursday, Merrill named Richard Dunn to replace Daniel 
Napoli as head of its risk management team. Both Waugh and Napoli 
were demoted, but Merrill said it was not assigning blame to them 
and that both would remain with the firm. ``We felt it was a good 
idea to bring in some new perspective to our debt business,'' said 
Thomas Davis, Merrill's executive vice president for the corporate 
and institutional client group. The demotions are part of a broader 
revamping at Merrill. On Tuesday, the firm announced a third-quarter 
loss of $164 million and said it would dismiss 3,400 workers. Waugh 
had shared responsibility for the debt unit with Conrad Voldstad, 
who left the position last month when he was assigned to a team overseeing 
Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that Merrill helped rescue.
