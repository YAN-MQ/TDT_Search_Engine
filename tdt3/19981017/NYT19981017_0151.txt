Lots of candidates promise more jobs if elected, but Gov. John Rowland 
of Connecticut is going them one better: he is promising one to his 
opponent. Reflecting supreme confidence that he will be re-elected 
Nov. 3 and his continuing effort to boost his reputation for bipartisanship, 
Rowland said he would welcome his Democratic opponent, U.S. Rep. Barbara 
Kennelly, into his second administration. ``I have a great deal of 
respect for Mrs. Kennelly,'' the Republican governor said in comments 
released Saturday by an aide. ``She is very smart and capable, and 
some of the things that happened in her campaign are not her fault 
_ there are a lot of other external factors. I'd be willing to talk 
to her about any field she'd be interested in working in.'' Mrs. Kennelly 
did not refuse. She said through her spokesman that various people 
have tried to discuss future options with her, but that she was thinking 
only about becoming governor. Asked if Mrs. Kennelly would give Rowland 
a job, her campaign manager, Jonathan Pelto, said, ``John Rowland 
would certainly have a voice in any Kennelly administration, and a 
role if he chose one.'' Rowland first made the offer Friday, during 
a visit to The Connecticut Post of Bridgeport. ``I'm very fond of 
her,'' he was quoted as saying in Saturday's issue. Despite his lead 
of 30 to 44 points in various state polls, he cautioned, ``I don't 
want to be presumptuous, and I don't want to be condescending in suggesting 
that something's going to happen.'' As possible positions, he mentioned 
her concern about child safety and her criticism of his leadership 
of the state Department of Children and Families. The two once had 
a warm personal relationship. During the six years they served together 
in the House of Representatives, they often had dinner together and 
their staffs held joint birthday parties. An aide to the governor 
recalled that when the two were doing television commentaries for 
a presidential debate in Hartford in 1996, they hugged and he called 
her ``Babs.'' The governor often heralds his ability to work with 
Democratic legislators, and a spokesman said he had appointed two 
Democrats as commissioners and one as his chief legal counsel, who 
has since resigned. Rowland also reappointed Mrs. Kennelly's sister, 
Louise Bailey, to the University of Connecticut board of trustees, 
and did not stop the Criminal Justice Commission from reappointing 
her brother, John Bailey, as chief state's attorney. The relationship 
has deteriorated in recent days as Mrs. Kennelly began jabbing at 
Rowland after months of trying to talk mostly about her vision for 
the state. The governor, after holding his tongue during their first 
debate, responded in kind during two debates last week. Mrs. Kennelly's 
change in tone apparently is the result of pleas by her advisers, 
who see little hope of picking up many undecided voters but are eager 
to give loyal Democrats a reason to go to the polls. Her current television 
advertisement is an attack on Rowland's record for enforcing environmental 
laws. ``It should not pay to pollute,'' Mrs. Kennelly says in the 
ad, standing at water's edge, as workers behind her labor in anti-contamination 
suits. ``We have laws on the books to preserve our air and our water. 
They're not being enforced.'' The ad, which also shows a gavel and 
a person in handcuffs, closes with the words, ``When Barbara Kennelly 
is governor, polluters won't get off the hook.'' Rowland, ever feistier 
in debates, has continued to run only positive television commercials. 
Friday, he began a minutelong ad that describes the improvement in 
the state's economy over the last four years. ``But there's still 
more to do,'' he says, looking into the camera. ``We can cut taxes 
further, rebuild our cities, and create better jobs for the future. 
I'm asking for your vote so we can keep building a better Connecticut 
together.'' Mrs. Kennelly's campaign, which had said that it planned 
to make up its deficit in the polls by gaining a point a day, ran 
out of time for that strategy Wednesday, when the University of Connecticut 
released a poll showing her down by 40 percentage points, with 20 
days until the election. Of those polled, 62 percent said they preferred 
Rowland, 22 percent were for Mrs. Kennelly and 17 percent were undecided. 
The poll consisted of interviews with 502 state residents from Oct. 
6 to 11, and has a margin of sampling error of 5 percentage points.
