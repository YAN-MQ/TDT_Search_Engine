Jacques Abram, a pianist who performed regularly as a recitalist and 
concerto soloist in New York in the 1940s and '50s, died in Tampa, 
Fla., on Oct. 5. He was 83. Abram was known for performances that 
combined virtuosity and precision with a modernist's interpretive 
coolness. He was praised for the chiseled details he brought out in 
works by Scarlatti, Haydn, Beethoven and Chopin, and he introduced 
contemporary works, notably the Britten Piano Concerto and solo works 
by Norman Dello Joio. He gave the Britten its U.S. premiere in Salt 
Lake City in 1948, and its first New York performance, with Stokowski 
conducting, in 1949. He was born in Lufkin, Texas and began improvising 
at the piano when he was 3 and performed publicly when he was 6. During 
his tours, he was heard by Rachmaninoff and Paderewski, who urged 
his parents to enroll him at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, 
where he became a student of Ernest Hutcheson. He studied at Curtis 
until he was 13, then with Josef Hofmann and David Saperton at the 
Juilliard School. In 1937, Abram won the National Federation of Music 
Clubs' Schubert Memorial Award for young artists. The following year 
he made his New York debut as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra, 
and played as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic. In the '50s 
he was an artist in residence at the University of Toronto and the 
Royal Conservatory of Music. He moved to Tampa, Fla., in 1963. He 
is survived by two sons, Jonathan, of Washington and Gregory, of Croton, 
N.Y.; a daughter, Nell Abram of Tampa; and a brother, Lynwood Abram 
of Louisville, Ky.
