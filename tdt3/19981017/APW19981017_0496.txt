American diplomat William Graham Walker was named Saturday to head 
the newly created Kosovo verification mission, the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe said. OSCE chairman Bronislaw Geremek, 
the Polish foreign minister, made the appointment the day after signing 
an agreement in Belgrade that allows the planned 2,000-strong international 
monitoring force to operate in Kosovo. During 37 years in the U.S. 
Foreign Service, Walker served as ambassador to El Salvador from 1985-88 
and also held diplomatic assignments in Bolivia, Honduras, Brazil, 
Japan and Peru. Most recently, he served as special representative 
of the U.N. secretary-general as head of the United Nations Transitional 
Administration for Eastern Slavonia, in Croatia. He holds the U.S. 
diplomatic rank of ambassador. In his letter from Warsaw, Geremek 
wrote that the appointment would offer Walker a ``unique opportunity 
to contribute to peace and political stability in the Balkans.'' An 
advance team for the verification mission arrived in Belgrade on Saturday 
and was due to head to Kosovo on Sunday to begin arranging logistical 
details for the monitors. OSCE spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said it's 
hoped that a substantial number of the verifiers will be on the job 
in Kosovo by the end of October.
