Baseball players spend their whole careers trying to get into the 
hall of fame in Cooperstown, Ohio. But the residents there say their 
town is more than just baseball. I think it was a Tuesday that he 
hit the 62nd home run. During that game, the phone wasn't Ringing 
at all. Immediately after that game, the phones started to ring. We 
had people that week say, we were driving by from Nigh agra falls 
to boston, and we realized we were so close and we stopped in. Do 
you have a room for the night?" Those two gentlemen have done a heck 
of a lot for baseball. They've really come across very nice. Been 
a very, very good year for Cooperstown. Our economy is lagging. Having 
a good tourism season, having the baseball hall of fame back in business, 
having baseball seen again as part of the national pastime with mcGwire 
and Sosa, with the great year the Yankees had, that has been a real 
boom to the economy here. We have happy people coming through town 
now instead of disgruntled fans who felt betrayed, as they have for 
the last several years. They're now happy fans. And happy fans spend 
more money. They spend more money, they share more experiences. It's 
more than baseball. And most of the village is a national historic 
district. It is a multifaceted town. It's kind of a very unique town 
-- probably in America, we have all kinds of small but diverse business. 
The hospital, the other museums, the county government, it's a very, 
very diverse town. We give out excellent directions to get here, but 
that's what makes cooperstown what it is. Time has stood still here. 
People come here for what they go to Disneyland to see. But it's real 
here. It's Cooperstown.
