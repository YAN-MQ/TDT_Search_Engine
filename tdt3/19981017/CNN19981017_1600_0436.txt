25 years after he seized power in Chile, general augusto Pinochet 
is under arrest in Britain, charged with murder. The former dictator 
was arrested in London last night. Police won't say where they are 
holding the 82-year-old Chilean general. His arrest came in response 
to an extradition warrant from Spain, which accuses him of murdering 
Spanish citizens in Chile between 1973 and '83. The Chilean ambassador 
to Britain plans to seek Pinochet's release, saying he holds a diplomatic 
passport because he is a senator in Chile. Pinochet was in London 
recuperating from back surgery.
