With "Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven. It's going to be very nerve-racking. 
But, you know, I'm ready for it. I think that it's -- you know, this 
is, to me, a dream come true. We believe -- we believe we can compete. 
And when you believe that you can compete and you go out there and 
you play the way that we've played, we're going to be confident. I 
don't know if anybody else around the country will be confident in 
us. All right, after a grinding regular season, it all gets going 
tonight. The Yankees and padres meet in game one of the world series 
at Yankee stadium. New York will start Mr. perfect David Wells. San 
Diego counters with Kevin brown.
