I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"Headline News" forecast. Scattered showers Saturday morning in the 
northwest, with snow over the central Rockies, and heavy rainfall 
in the plains states, due to a frontal system. As we work our way 
into Saturday evening, we'll see a mixture of snow and rain develop 
over the northern and western Great Lakes, and heavy rainfall develop 
and extend all the way into Sunday morning over Arkansas, northern 
louisiana and Texas. Otherwise, beautiful in the west and in the east 
by Sunday morning, with high pressure over both areas. We'll see highs 
on Saturday, in the 40s and 50s in the northwest, 50s in New England, 
otherwise 60s, 70s and 80s. So, generally cool temperatures across 
the country for Saturday. Your extended forecast showing snow and 
showers out to be pretty heavy in the Great Lakes on Sunday. And then 
that precipitation will extend down into Texas and Louisiana, where 
we will see thunderstorms. Windy conditions throughout the extended 
forecast period over the southern rockies. Scattered thunderstorms 
Monday over the deep south with some snow showers in the extreme northern 
sections of the country. And then, on Tuesday, a mix of snow and rain 
in the Great Lakes, and that area of rain will push to the central 
U.S. as we go into Texas, we'll see thunderstorm activity. And remember, 
you can get your four-day forecast for 6,100 cities at cNN.com.
