Status of promises that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must 
back up with evidence of compliance by NATO's Oct. 27 deadline or 
face renewed threat of airstrikes: _Immediately halt all hostilities 
in Kosovo: No major fighting has been reported this month in the southern 
Serbian province, but both sides reported shooting incidents Saturday. 
Serb police claimed ethnic Albanian ``extremists'' attacked them more 
than a dozen times across Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians blamed Serbs for 
at least two incidents, saying police in the Pristina suburb of Vranjevac 
opened fire. _Withdraw forces and heavy armaments to levels before 
crackdown began Feb. 28: NATO spy planes began flying over Kosovo 
on Saturday to check status of pullouts. On Friday, despite withdrawals, 
NATO said more Serb troops and police remain in the province than 
are permitted. _Start serious talks with ethnic Albanians on self-rule: 
No date for start of talks has been announced. Both sides have held 
separate discussions with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill. Ethnic Albanian 
political leaders reportedly met Saturday in Turkey to discuss taking 
a united stand on independence or autonomy. _Help refugees return 
to their homes: Some refugees have begun moving back to their villages 
but many remain wary of Serb police forces, some of whom were accused 
in massacres of civilians. _Allowing unhindered work by humanitarian 
organizations: U.N. refugee agency and others resumed aid convoys 
in past several days, and some workers say Serb police were less obstructive. 
_Cooperating with International War Crimes Tribunal: U.N. war crimes 
investigators received Yugoslav visas and plan to return to Kosovo 
soon. _Allowing a 2,000-member international verification force into 
Kosovo to verify that Yugoslavia is keeping its word: An advance team 
for monitors, to be overseen by the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, arrived Saturday in Belgrade, and another small 
group arrived in Kosovo from Bosnia. OSCE said it hoped a sizable 
number of monitors would be in Kosovo in two weeks.
