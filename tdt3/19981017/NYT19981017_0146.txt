University presidents still do not come close to basketball players 
or venture capitalists when it comes to earnings, but a growing number 
have compensation packages in the half-million dollar range once thought 
of as the preserve of corporate executives. Three university presidents 
_ at Rockefeller University, Vanderbilt and the University of Pennsylvania 
_ received pay and benefit packages greater than $500,000 in the 1996-97 
school year, according to a study by The Chronicle of Higher Education 
in this week's issue. Ten more universities, including four in the 
New York area _ Columbia, New York University, Yale and Hofstra _ 
paid their presidents between $400,000 and $500,000, and 33 more paid 
between $300,000 and $400,000, The Chronicle said, making it the ``most 
gilded'' year since it started reporting executive pay six years ago. 
Forty-six top executives at private universities were paid more than 
$300,000 in 1996-97, up from 38 the previous academic year. Other 
universities in the New York region whose total presidential compensation 
exceeded $300,000 in 1996-97 included Long Island University and Dowling 
College on Long Island, Princeton University, and Ithaca College. 
``It is striking how many are earning at that level,'' said Scott 
Jaschik, the Chronicle's managing editor. ``It's been going up even 
though a few of the biggies are gone,'' he added, referring to Peter 
Diamandopoulos, the former president of Adelphi University, and John 
Silber, the former president of Boston University, whose compensation 
packages of more than $500,000 made them the previous kings of the 
Chronicle's compensation survey and the targets of faculty anger. 
It was the disclosure of Diamandopoulos' rich compensation _ in 1995-96 
he received $523,636 in salary and deferred bonuses _ that helped 
set in motion the New York State Board of Regents investigation that 
removed him from office. The presidential salaries have generally 
increased faster than faculty salaries. Although some faculty members, 
particularly in areas like business and medicine, have six-figure 
salaries, the average salary and compensation for a full-time faculty 
member at a private institution in 1996-97 was $74,132, according 
to the American Association of University Professors. In general, 
university officials defended the pay packages, citing the demands 
of the university president's job. ``Some of these people run $2 billion 
operations with 15,000 employees, that are really major corporations, 
though they are nonprofit,'' said Morton Schapiro, an economist who 
studies higher education and is a dean at the University of Southern 
California. Many officials also pointed to the signs of robust health 
of their institutions _ rising student applications, hefty fund-raising, 
strong research and successful faculty recruitment _ as signs of their 
chief executives' prowess. Richard Furlaud, the former chairman of 
the board of trustees at Rockefeller University, said the university 
had been in ``bad shape'' when it asked Dr. Torsten Wiesel, a Nobel 
laureate and chairman of its faculty, to take over when David Baltimore 
resigned as president in 1991. ``We were running a substantial deficit 
and had a lot of problems,'' he said. ``He did so rather reluctantly,'' 
Furlaud added, ``but he did an absolutely spectacular job.'' Although 
Rockefeller's board could not persuade Wiesel to accept a raise during 
most of his tenure, Furlaud said, it finally pushed him into taking 
a $50,000 raise (to $350,000) and a $133,333 bonus. With other benefits, 
that raised his total compensation to $546,966, making him No. 1 on 
the Chronicle's list. Dr. Wiesel steps down as president next month. 
John Hall, chairman of the Vanderbilt board, told The Chronicle that 
the university's reputation and endowment had bloomed under Joe Wyatt's 
chancellorship. His $525,496 in compensation put him second in the 
Chronicle survey. And P. Roy Vagelos, the chairman of the University 
of Pennsylvania's trustees, said Judith Rodin, Penn's president, was 
``one of the top five'' presidents in the country and had fully earned 
her compensation, the Chronicle said. Her $514,878 compensation placed 
her third on the Chronicle list. Martin Lipton, chairman of the trustees 
at New York University, said that Dr. L. Jay Oliva, NYU's president, 
was ``a principal architect'' of the university's transformation from 
a ``regional university to a prestigious national research institution.'' 
Oliva received a salary of $428,469 and $23,174 in benefits. Not everyone 
is convinced that the high level of pay is appropriate. Saul Cohen, 
a member of the New York Board of Regents and a former president of 
Queens College, said he thought such salaries were ``out of line.'' 
``The notion that a university president should have salaries comparable 
to those in industry is fallacious,'' he said. ``What it is reflecting 
is the professionalization of the university presidency, which I think 
is inappropriate.'' But Tom Ingram, president of the Association of 
Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, said, ``There are top 
corporate executives who compare what they do with their university 
presidents and say they wouldn't trade jobs for a minute,'' he said. 
The Chronicle said that only two presidents of private research universities 
_ Norman Lamm of Yeshiva University and H. Patrick Swygert of Howard 
University _ had total earnings of less than $200,000 in the 1996-97 
year. The Chronicle's survey of 475 private colleges and universities, 
which was based on filings with the Internal Revenue Service, did 
not include public universities, where pay is substantially lower 
and where about 80 percent of all college students are enrolled. At 
the State University of New York, for example, which has 64 campuses 
and about 400,000 students, the chancellor's salary is $250,000. At 
the City University of New York, with 200,000 students, the chancellor's 
salary is $178,523. Ingram, of the Association of Governing Boards, 
said he believed that the leaders of most public universities were 
``under-appreciated and under-compensated.''
