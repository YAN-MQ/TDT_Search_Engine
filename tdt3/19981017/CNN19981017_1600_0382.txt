Republicans used their weekly radio address to counter President Clinton's 
criticism of their efforts on behalf of education. Yesterday, President 
Clinton accused republicans of not doing enough on the issue. Indiana 
senator Dan coats calls the assertion comments misleading. He blames 
President Clinton for killing bills on school choice, school funding 
and scholarships. And he says republicans passed legislation helping 
head start students with disabilities and children with reading problems. 
Coats also criticized the president for not cutting taxes. Republicans 
know we can both protect our social security and give hard-working 
families some of their hard-earned money back. This administration 
refuses to even consider even a modest tax cut amidst this surplus 
is inexcusable. The new budget includes more than $1 billion to hire 
new teachers.
