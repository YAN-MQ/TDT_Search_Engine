Congo's President Laurent Kabila flew to Khartoum on Saturday for 
talks with Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir, Sudan's national radio 
reported. El-Bashir ``reiterated Sudan's condemnation of the combined 
Ugandan-Rwandan invasion of the Congo and said that Sudan would support 
the Congo in international forums and defend its sovereignty,'' according 
to Radio Omdurman. Kabila's government has accused Uganda and Rwanda 
of sending troops to eastern Congo to support insurgents. Uganda admits 
it has troops in northeastern Congo but says they are defending its 
border from rebels. Rwanda says it reserves the right to intervene 
against attacks from Rwandan Hutu rebels. In turn, Congolese rebel 
commanders have accused Sudan of sending forces to support the Kabila 
government. Sudan denies involvement in Congo. Before flying home 
late Saturday, Kabila visited the el-Shifa pharmaceutical factory 
in north Khartoum, which the United States destroyed in a missile 
attack on Aug. 20. Washington said the plant produced the ingredients 
of chemical weapons _ a charge denied by Sudan and the factory's owners.
