Congress will adjourn without extending a federal waiting period for 
handgun buyers. Instead, a new system will instantly check backgrounds 
of anyone who wants to buy a firearm. Aram Roston reports. Thank you. 
Georgia range and guns, near the Atlanta airport, people get a Chance 
to shoot their own firearms or rent them. Chuck schofield, an aviation 
equipment salesman, has come during his lunch break to fire his rifle. 
He says he's pleased with the new federal laws that will have the 
FBI doing background checks on gun buyers. Like if an honest purchasing 
-- honest person purchasing a firearm, there shouldn't be any concern. 
On November 30th, the Brady law goes into full effect, ending the 
five-day waiting period to buy handguns. But to replace it, the FBI 
will start running instant background checks, which it says will take 
only 30 seconds to 3 minutes. For the first time, the checks won't 
be just for pistols, but also for rifles and shotguns. At gun stores, 
there's a reminder of the new requirements, and there's some evidence 
sales are increasing as the new regulations approach. I can't say 
if it's because of that or if it's because of the hunting season. 
I understand that there are an increase in sales, people trying to 
beat the deadline, if you will. At the Georgia bureau of investigation, 
operators take calls from gun dealers requesting virtually instant 
criminal background checks. The system is a state version of how the 
FBI checks system will work. Buyer Georgia resident. Buyer's last 
name. Operators at computer terminals type in the name and social 
security number, and then they pass on the word. About 8% or 9% of 
the buyers are turned down. The national rifle association had agreed 
to the concept of instant background checks but is a little wary. 
The idea of background checks and registration, that's the first step 
on the road to confiscation. But gun control advocates say the federal 
background checks may not cover all state records, and say they are 
concerned about the end to the waiting period. They claim that over 
the past five years, the Brady law prevented almost 250,000 ineligible 
customers from buying guns. Aram Roston, CNN, Atlanta.
