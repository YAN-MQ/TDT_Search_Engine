The contest between Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer 
remains close, according to five polls of New York state voters conducted 
this month, while Gov. George Pataki continues to lead his Democratic 
challenger, Peter Vallone, by a large margin. In the Senate race, 
the differences between the two candidates range from D'Amato at eight 
percentage points ahead to six points behind. But the gap between 
the candidates is within each poll's margin of sampling error, making 
the race a statistical tie. The most recent poll, conducted by The 
Daily News and WABC-TV, is the only survey to show D'Amato ahead, 
leading by eight points. The poll of 364 likely voters has a margin 
of sampling error of plus or minus six percentage points. There is 
only a one-point difference between the candidates for Senate in the 
polls conducted by Quinnipiac College, with 583 likely voters, and 
by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research, with 803 likely voters. Schumer 
leads by four points in the New York Times/CBS News Poll of 559 likely 
voters, and by five points in the poll of 502 likely voters conducted 
by Manhattanville College. These polls have margins of sampling error 
of plus or minus four points. The polls show Pataki's lead over Vallone 
ranging from 27 points to 30 points. B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence 
Party candidate, and Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Liberal Party 
nominee, are both far behind in all the polls, getting 4 percent to 
9 percent. Differences in polls can be attributed to many things, 
including question wording and order. The timing of the surveys can 
also cause variations. The Daily News/WABC-TV poll was conducted about 
a week after The Times/CBS News Poll was completed. The results of 
these polls are based on likely voters, whom organizations define 
differently. For example, in the poll conducted by Mason-Dixon, registered 
voters who said they would definitely vote in November and have regularly 
voted in statewide elections are considered likely voters. In the 
Daily News/WABC-TV poll, likely voters are those registered voters 
who said they were following the election closely, would definitely 
vote this year, and voted in 1992, when D'Amato last ran for re-election. 
Sampling error could also account for differences in the margins of 
some polls. For example, with a sampling error of four points, the 
46 percent for Schumer in the Manhattanville poll could be as high 
as 50 percent or as low as 42 percent; based on that poll, he could 
be ahead by 13 points or behind by 3 points.
