Both sides in mideast peace talks say the mood is good. Israeli prime 
minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and 
secretary of state Madeleine Albright had a private lunch Friday to 
discuss matters alone. President Clinton opened the meeting yesterday 
at a secluded resort in maryland. Security against terrorism in the 
West Bank remains a key issue. Diplomatic sources tell the associated 
press that Palestinians did not accept an Israeli demand for suspected 
terrorists to be extradited for trial. The state department says getting 
the two sides together was an accomplishment in itself. There hadn't 
been a meeting between the two leaders in 11 or so months. And now 
we've not only increased the frequency but turned it into something 
that is more normal. Something that one hopes will make each leader 
understand the needs, constraints and concerns of the other so that 
practical solutions can be found to very real problems. Rubin says 
the goal is to complete the negotiations by Sunday.
