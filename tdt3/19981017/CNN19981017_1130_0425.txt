A former Seattle schoolteacher has given birth to a second child, 
fathered by a teenager she was convicted of raping. Mary Kay LeTourneau 
had the girl yesterday. LeTourneau is serving a seven-year prison 
term for having sex with the boy, a former student, who is now 15. 
She says she became pregnant for the second time by the boy while 
free under her original suspended sentence.
