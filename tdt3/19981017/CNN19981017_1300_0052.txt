A short time ago, President Clinton arrived at the wye river conference 
center on the eastern shore of Maryland, where he hopes to broker 
a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians before the mideast 
summit ends. Mr. Clinton will meet individually with Israeli and Palestinian 
leaders, apparently to address a key sticking point in the negotiations 
-- controlling terrorism on the West Bank. Secretary of state Madeleine 
Albright says the overall deal being worked out is essentially an 
exchange of land for security. Sources say there's been no real progress 
so far. Israel wants security assurances before turning over West 
Bank land. The Palestinians say peace will bring improved security. 
They reportedly are rejecting an Israeli demand that terrorism suspects 
be tried in Israel.
