There may be a budget deal in Washington, but Congress won't vote 
on it until Tuesday. For now, it has sent President Clinton a fifth 
short-term spending measure to keep the government running. Officials 
say it will be a major project to print the legislation over the weekend, 
and members of Congress will need time to read it before they vote. 
Leaders from both parties are claiming victory for the final deal.
