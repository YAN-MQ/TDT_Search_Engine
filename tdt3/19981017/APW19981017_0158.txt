A bomb exploded on a ferry shortly after it arrived in the southern 
port city of Zamboanga early Saturday, police said. No one was injured. 
The blast damaged an empty upper deck cabin of the Sampaguita Ferry 
1, which arrived around 6 a.m. (2200 GMT Friday) from Pagadian City, 
about 160 kilometers (100 miles) northeast of Zamboanga, said police 
chief Karib Muammil. The explosion sent disembarking passengers scurrying 
off the ferry in panic. Muammil said the bomb may have been set off 
by a timer and police were still trying to determine who had used 
the cabin. Passengers are free to choose their cabins and tickets 
do not indicate cabin numbers. No one has claimed responsibility for 
the blast, which police investigators suspect was the handiwork of 
extortion gangs like those responsible for several bombings of passenger 
buses in the city earlier this year. An officer of the ferry, however, 
said his company has not received any threats. Muslim extremist rebels, 
who have been blamed for some bombings in the city, also operate in 
Zamboanga, about 880 kilometers (550 miles) south of Manila.
