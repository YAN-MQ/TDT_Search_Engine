"In focus" this evening -- why there's a need for a new campaign in 
this country -- to show grownups why vaccinations aren't just for 
children. Here's NBC's Rehema Ellis. In Anchorage, Alaska, a massive 
inoculation program. In Atlanta last weekend, a drive-through flu 
enoch cue lags center. An attempt to get a jump on the coming flu 
season. In New York City this week, health department workers at apartment 
buildings, vaccinating elderly residents. In Alexandria, Virginia, 
a hospital stages it's annual "fight the flu" campaign concentrating 
on those 18 years old or older. The practice of preventive medicine 
is becoming more aggressive. Most of America's children are protected, 
but many adults are not. Some health professionals estimate that nearly 
100,000 Americans die each year of vaccine preventable diseases or 
complications from those diseases. At greatest risk -- people 65 and 
older and those with chronic health problems. But doctors now strongly 
encourage flu shots for all adults. Many adults believe that immunizations 
are only for children, that once they've had all of their childhood 
vaccines, that's it -- they never need a Shot again, and they just 
aren't aware of the benefit of shots of various kinds for adults. 
Each year, the list of vaccine preventable diseases grows longer. 
The latest breakthrough -- hepatitis B, which kills 4,000 to 5,000 
people a Year. But even childhood diseases like measles, rubella, 
mumps and chicken pox can do serious harm in adulthood. Among the 
most dangerous, pneumococcal infections, which cause a type of pneumonia 
blamed for as many as 40,000 deaths a year. But flu still gets the 
most attention. Researchers say that elderly patients who don't have 
flu shots are twice as likely to develop health problems requiring 
hospitalization. Many seniors, like 72-year-old Lindsay green, have 
gone from skeptics to true believers. Since I've been taking the shots. 
I haven't been sick that speaks for itself. The flu season runs from 
December through March. Most years, 10% to 20% of the population comes 
down with it. What will this season bring? We don't know whether it's 
gonna be an early season. We don't know if it's gonna be a severe 
season, or whether it's gonna start at a regular time and perhaps 
be a relative mild season. We'd love to be able to predict that, but 
we simply can't do that. What they can do is sound the alarm about 
the value of vaccination. Rehema Ellis, NBC news, New York.
