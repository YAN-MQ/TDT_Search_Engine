Attackers believed to be Ugandan rebels killed three relief workers 
and injured two others when they ambushed a convoy in northeastern 
Uganda, Norwegian People's Aid said in a statement Saturday. The agency 
said the two vehicles _ a truck and a Toyota Land Cruiser _ were returning 
from delivering relief supplies to the southern Sudanese town of Bamuruye 
when they came under heavy fire. The agency did not say when the attack 
occurred 2 kilometers (.6 miles) west of the town of Yumbe on the 
Ugandan side of the border. The truck driver, his assistant and the 
convoy leader were killed while two others were injured, the statement 
said. It did not give their names or nationalities. Norwegian People's 
Aid said the attackers were believed to be members of the West Nile 
Bank Front, a rebel group that has recently resumed operating in the 
area which borders both southern Sudan and northeastern Congo. The 
group, which NPA said is backed by the Sudanese government, had been 
operating in south Sudan until Sudanese rebels captured their bases 
in March 1997, forcing them to move into northeastern Congo. The relief 
agency, which supports the Sudan People's Liberation Army rebels fighting 
for control of southern Sudan, said the route was crucial for supplies 
heading to the southern Sudanese counties of Kajo, Keji and Yei. NPA 
said the Ugandan border town of Koboko, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west 
of the ambush site, is a major logistical center for relief operations 
assisting 100,000 displaced Sudanese across the border. The statement 
said the attackers burned the two NPA vehicles and made off with their 
cargo.
