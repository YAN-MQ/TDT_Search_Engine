Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan is weighing in on the presidential 
sex scandal. He says hurricanes and other disasters that have hit 
the United States are the result of the country's sinful behavior 
including what went on in the White House. Farrakhan made the remarks 
last night at Howard University in Washington. He says Mr. Clinton 
made mistakes, but that those condemning him are not in a position 
to judge.
