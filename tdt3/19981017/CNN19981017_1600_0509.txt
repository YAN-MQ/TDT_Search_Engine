This is Orelon Sidney from the CNN weather center with your "Headline 
News weather update." Sunday morning will be chilly across most of 
the Rockies and the plains states as a cold front continues to push 
toward the appalachian mountains. Showers and thunderstorms will be 
seen along the front, stretching from texas northward into the Great 
Lakes and portions of eastern Canada. Also look for a new cold front 
system to move through Alberta. That will continue a chance for cool 
temperatures for Montana and into the dakotas, and snow flurries are 
possible. Look for scattered showers across portions of southern Florida 
as the high pressure weakens in the eastern U.S. temperatures will 
be in the 60s, 70s and 80s for the central plains down to the gulf 
coast with cool temperatures in the 40s and 50s for the northern Rockies 
and the northern plains. On the extended forecast -- scattered thunderstorms 
remain in the gulf forecast with strong activity on Monday across 
the Great Lakes. This will change to a mix of rain and snow on Tuesday 
as cooler temperatures settle into the Great Lakes region with scattered 
thunderstorms possible in the gulf through Wednesday. The forecast 
for more than 6,000 cities is at CNN.com.
