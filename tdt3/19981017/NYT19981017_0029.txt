Surrounded by child care advocates, parents and children assembled 
for his news conference, Peter Vallone criticized Gov. George Pataki 
on Friday for vetoing funds in the budget for child care, and said 
his record showed that he would do a better job of serving the interests 
of young children and working parents. Vallone, speaker of the New 
York City Council, said the governor had used his line-item veto to 
eliminate $27 million in low-income day care subsidies from this year's 
budget, and also vetoed $25 million that the Legislature had added 
to the budget for the construction of new day-care facilities. By 
doing so, Vallone said, the governor had deprived the city of even 
more money for day care in the form of federal and local matching 
grants. As he has on many other issues, Vallone called for the governor 
to debate him on child care. ``We should be talking about this across 
the table, face to face, talking about what human effect does it have 
when we veto certain programs and we fund other programs,'' Vallone 
said. Joe Conway, a spokesman for Pataki's budget office, said the 
governor had vetoed the items because they represented ``an unconstitutional 
redirection'' of money by the Legislature away from other important 
programs. ``Essentially this was a shell game that was being played 
with the money,'' Conway said. ``This was not new money. They were 
just moving it around.'' Vallone said he would pay for additional 
child care mainly with money from a special fund controlled by the 
governor and legislative leaders. That money, which he said totaled 
about $600 million, goes to a variety of often politically popular 
projects throughout the state. Critics call it pork barrel spending. 
Since Pataki took office, Conway said, the state's spending on day 
care increased to $456 million from $269 million, and the number of 
positions for children in state-financed day care increased by approximately 
50,000. ``In the past two years, we have witnessed the largest increase 
in child care funding in the history of New York state,'' he said.
