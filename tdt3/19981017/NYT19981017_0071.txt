Quietly in this season of scandal the Clinton administration has managed 
a significant advance in the most unlikely of areas: low-income housing. 
Three years ago the hard-riding, right-leaning Republican majority 
in Congress brought a halt to all efforts to bring additional units 
of affordable housing to poor families. Public housing was in deep 
trouble and the prevailing political sentiment seemed to be, ``Put 
it out of its misery.'' The abolition of the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, which administers the nation's public housing 
program, was seriously considered. This regressive effort went further 
than anything that had taken place during the Reagan years. It was 
particularly insidious in that it occurred at a time when the nation's 
overall supply of affordable housing was shrinking and the overall 
demand, because of stagnating wages and other economic pressures, 
had increased dramatically. The number of poor families in deep distress 
_ living in grossly substandard housing, for example, or spending 
well over 50 percent of their gross incomes on rent _ had reached 
record levels. Housing advocates spoke in tones of despair. Now, suddenly, 
comes passage of a housing measure that bolsters HUD's budget by $2 
billion, that will provide rent subsidies to 90,000 new families, 
that will begin to mix stable, working families into housing projects 
that have been overwhelmed by the indigent, and that will begin to 
desegregate projects that have been racially segregated for decades. 
By all accounts, the architect of this turnaround is Andrew Cuomo, 
who took over as HUD secretary in January 1997. Cuomo streamlined 
the agency and worked hard to salvage one of its most important missions 
_ to provide safe and decent housing to families shut out of the regular 
housing market. In the 1970s the number of new families getting rent 
subsidies from the government each year was measured in the hundreds 
of thousands. Ronald Reagan ratcheted that down to the tens of thousands. 
By the time Cuomo became HUD secretary, the number of new families 
getting subsidies was zero. So rent subsidies (in the form of housing 
vouchers) for 90,000 new families are a big deal. The new policy of 
``deconcentration'' is also a big deal. The idea is to begin admitting 
families with working adults and somewhat higher incomes into projects 
populated almost exclusively by very poor families. The goal is to 
provide an economic mix and models of behavior that will ward off 
the social instability that has ruined many public housing projects. 
At the same time, Cuomo, with the support of President Clinton, has 
insisted that public housing projects begin to desegregate. ``Public 
housing across the nation is as segregated as private housing,'' said 
Cuomo. ``You have black projects and white projects. There are places 
where you have Asian projects. The president has spoken about one 
America. So we are saying that where the federal government is the 
landlord, in our own house, let us end segregation once and for all.'' 
The new legislation, which is about to be signed by the president, 
requires housing authorities to submit for Cuomo's approval a plan 
showing how they will begin deconcentrating and desegregating their 
housing. The legislation also will end what Cuomo called a major and 
``foolish'' disincentive to work. Under existing rules, the amount 
of rent in public housing can increase as a family's income increases. 
The new legislation freezes rent for the first two years of a family's 
increase in income. What is remarkable about Cuomo's effort is not 
the scope of the bill. It's the fact that he was able to secure its 
passage in the midst of the Lewinsky scandal and at a time when Congress 
is controlled by conservative forces that have long been hostile to 
the very idea of public housing. ``The progressive forces stood their 
ground here,'' said Cuomo. ``There is a real hunger for intelligent, 
progressive leadership.'' ``I give Cuomo a lot of credit,'' said Robert 
Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
``He turned out to be a great negotiator. He did a brilliant job.''
