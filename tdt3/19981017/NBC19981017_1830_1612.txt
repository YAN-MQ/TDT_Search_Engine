Finally tonight, any charge that she is too old for the sports she 
referees, would amount to a personal foul. Here's NBC's Pat Dawson. 
I have the whistle. On the fields of long island, New York, a new 
season has begun again. And with the energy and quickness of a teenager, 
78-year-old Helen Allen is right in the thick of it. Right where she's 
been for more than half a century. Whether I was great at it or average, 
or not so good, it didn't matter. I just enjoy playing. Still living 
life on the run, and still refereeing everything from field hockey 
to lacrosse to basketball all year long. When Helen Allen's lifetime 
in sports began, Joe DiMaggio was just starting to set records. She 
played basketball and field hockey in college. And after the war was 
named to women's national field hockey team. I don't think anybody 
thought it was more than just a nice activity for the ladies. But 
the world of women's sports would finally start to change as did her 
role in it from player to coach to official. In 55 years, she's refereed 
thousands of games, a journey from high school fields and cramped 
gyms to Madison square garden. Ask Helen why she's still at it at 
78, and she'll tell you that it's the simple joy of the game, an almost 
innocent child's joy that hasn't been diminished by time and certainly 
not by age. I respect her, I think she's a great role model for the 
girls. We're so much younger than she is, and that she can outrun 
us, is, like a Little bit insulting. Tell me what message you'd like 
these young girls to take away from this after a half century of playing 
sports? Oh, I think to have fun playing, and win or lose, realize 
that it's just a Game, a small part of life. A simple lesson from 
all the seasons of a long life at play. Pat Dawson, NBC news, great 
neck, New York.
