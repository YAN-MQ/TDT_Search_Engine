About 400 Palestinians, some waving large pictures of jailed family 
members, rallied Saturday for the release of Palestinian prisoners 
held in Israeli jails. A small group of demonstrators broke away and 
threw stones at Israeli soldiers on the outskirts of the West Bank 
town of Ramallah, and the troops responded with a few rounds of tear 
gas and rubber bullets. However, no injuries were reported. Palestinian 
police dispersed the protesters. It was the second day of unrest in 
or near Ramallah. On Friday, Jewish settlers had blocked the West 
Bank's main north-south highway outside the town, complaining that 
two of their security officers were detained and roughed up by Palestinian 
police. Palestinian security officials confirmed the two settler guards 
were briefly held Thursday but denied any ill treatment. The prisoner-release 
rally coincided with a U.S. peace summit at the Maryland retreat of 
Wye Plantation, at which Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have 
been trying to reach an agreement on an Israeli troop pullback from 
the West Bank and Palestinian security measures. Israel annexed the 
West Bank after seizing it from Jordan in 1967. One issue on the table 
at Wye is the release of 3,000 Palestinians held by Israel for security 
offenses. The Palestinian official who has been trying to negotiate 
prisoner releases accompanied Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to 
the U.S. talks. In other developments Saturday: _Palestinians living 
near the Jewish settlement of Itzhar, near the northern West Bank 
city of Nablus, said about five settlers rampaged through their olive 
groves, beating villagers. One Palestinian was hit in the head with 
a farm tool and was taken to the hospital for stitches, then released. 
Itzhar settlers have a long history of clashes with Palestinians living 
in surrounding villages. Three months ago, a pair of settlers were 
shot dead in an ambush as they patrolled the settlement's perimeter. 
_About 250 demonstrators marched in Gaza City to demand the release 
of Palestinian detainees held in Israeli jails. They presented a letter 
at the United Nations office asking the U.N. secretary-general to 
look into the question of detainees. _ Police broke up a demonstration 
of several dozen ultra-Orthodox Jews as they attempted to block off 
a downtown Jerusalem street. The demonstrators, who threw glass bottles 
and stones towards the policemen, were protesting the presence of 
a restaurant on the street that remains open on the Jewish sabbath, 
Israel Radio reported. There were no injuries.
