In big cities where the interests of migrating birds and tall buildings 
collide, the birds usually lose. But in one Canadian city, someone 
is looking out for the little guys. James hattori explains. It's 4:00 
A.M., and for some early risers in Toronto's financial district, it's 
bird-saving season. It could be alive. It's alive. Yeah, it's still 
alive. It's not in good shape, though. Every spring and fall, flocks 
of birds run obstacle courses as they fly through Toronto and other 
big cities located in migration corridors. And for reasons that remain 
a mystery, thousands crash into brightly lit buildings. It's dead. 
It's a Lincoln sparrow. To date, we've picked up over 100 different 
species of birds right down in the city's corridor. Some, if they 
survive impact, lie dazed on the ground, defenseless against morning 
traffic. So volunteers with the fatal light awareness program, F.L.A.P. 
for short, try to round up the survivors before they're lost in the 
rush. ah! We want to keep accurate records of the number of birds 
we pick up, the species of birds, because you see in many cases these 
birds are either endangered or they're vulnerable. Volunteers like 
Mike mesure, who's been rising early for bird duty for eight years, 
monitor office towers and persuade property managers to turn off most 
of their lights. This structure here a year ago was an average of 
48% lit. Spring of this year, according to the photograph count, it's 
14% lit. So, that's a 72-story structure, thousands of windows. That's 
a substantial reduction in lighting, which is exactly what we're looking 
for. F.L.A.P. has convinced some of Canada's biggest companies to 
rewire buildings and reduce lighting during migration. On some nights, 
few birds are found. On others, volunteers say birds drop from the 
sky like rain. Okay, princess. Once caught, the birds are examined 
for wounds. The more seriously injured are taken to a sanctuary for 
a recovery. Many make it. F.L.A.P. has saved more than 5,000 birds 
in its eight-year history. Some don't survive. But the ones that do 
are free to continue their journey. James hattori, CNN.
