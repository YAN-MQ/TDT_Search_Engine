A cold front from the central Great Lakes to eastern Texas will be 
accompanied by a band of clouds and areas of showers as it moves east 
during the day. Periods of rain and a few thunderstorms with gusty 
winds are expected across the northern Great Lakes Sunday morning 
as a potent jet stream disturbance moves overhead. In the wake of 
the front, chilly breezes from the north will deliver drier air. Nevertheless, 
low clouds and a few sprinkles will linger over the northern Mississippi 
Valley. The northern and central Plains will be seasonably cool with 
ample sunshine in most areas. Most of the Eastern states will become 
unseasonably warm. After a cool dawn from the Appalachians to the 
Atlantic Seaboard, increasing winds from the southwest will promote 
rapidly rising temperatures. Wind gusts over 25 miles an hour will 
be common from the eastern Ohio Valley to New England. Clouds will 
increase Sunday afternoon west of the Appalachians as the cold front 
approaches from the Middle West. A few showers will spread into the 
eastern parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes during the afternoon. 
Moist breezes from the east will be lifted over a cold front resulting 
in locally heavy rain and some flash flooding over parts of southern 
and eastern Texas. Otherwise, the southern Plains will be mainly dry 
and cool. In the West, a weak front will bring broken clouds and showers 
to the northern Rockies. Meanwhile, offshore winds will favor abundant 
sunshine along most of the West Coast. The interior West will be cool 
and sunny. Focus: Descent Into Winter Winter comes quickly in Alaska. 
Daytime temperatures in Fairbanks in early October average in the 
lower 40s. By October 31, typical temperatures will be in the lower 
20s with nighttime lows near five degrees. The lengthening nights, 
which allow the ground to efficiently lose energy, are an incubator 
for frigid air masses that will grip the 49th state in the months 
ahead. Fairbanks loses an average of seven minutes of possible sunlight 
for each day in October. The month begins with the sun above the horizon 
for over 11 hours and ends with only seven hours and 54 minutes of 
light.
