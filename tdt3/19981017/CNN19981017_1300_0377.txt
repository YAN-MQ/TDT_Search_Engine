Organized crime is making a new move on the sex business in Las Vegas. 
"The New York Times" reports six men were arrested last week for pressuring 
a computer expert to divert calls from escort services to mob-affiliated 
competitors. "The Las Vegas sun" says the men also have been charged 
in plotting to kill three operators of a rival escort service. The 
suspects are allegedly linked to the Gambino crime family. A federal 
prosecutor says using the escort business as a front for prostitution 
is "super big business" in Las Vegas.
