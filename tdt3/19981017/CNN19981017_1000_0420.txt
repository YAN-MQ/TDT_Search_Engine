A rough weekend lies ahead for parts of Mexico because of two storms 
in the pacific ocean. The more powerful of the two at the moment is 
hurricane Lester. At last report, it has winds of 90 miles per hour 
and could dump up to ten inches of rain on southern Mexico when it 
moves near shore today. Farther north, tropical storm Madeleine is 
over Baja, California, with 65 mile per hour winds. Forecasters say 
that storm could eventually affect Texas.
