Duane Walker, "Headline Sports." Darryl Strawberry was released from 
the hospital Friday after recovering from colon cancer surgery. He 
will not attend any world series games, doctors are optimistic that 
strawberry can make a full recovery and return to baseball next season. 
I'm so pleased and delighted with the fact that you know, the cancer 
has been removed from me, and I can move forward from this point.
