After emotional debates, the congresses of Peru and Ecuador have agreed 
to give the United States, Brazil and two other guarantor nations 
the power to impose a solution on South America's longest-running 
border dispute. The two nations have tried war, once in the early 
1940s and again in 1995, and negotiation, but have been unable to 
agree on who should have a 49-mile stretch of the Condor Mountains 
that lies between them. The votes passed overwhelmingly Friday in 
both countries just as President Alberto Fujimori of Peru and his 
Ecuadorian counterpart, Jamil Mahuad, headed for the Eighth Iberian-American 
summit meeting in Oporto, Portugal. There they were to meet with leaders 
and representatives of the four guarantor nations _ the other two 
are Argentina and Chile _ to formally deliver the votes of their Congresses 
and to chart their next moves. Casualties from the brief 1995 war 
ran into the hundreds; the hostility over the border has also been 
the pretext for a sizable arms buildup that neither nation can afford. 
The heavily fortified frontier, now closed, has divided Indian tribes 
who once lived there. Those visiting kin must now travel for days 
through river networks via Colombia. The unusual decision in both 
capitals to allow the guarantor nations to impose definitive borders 
indicates how intractable the problem remains. At a meeting here last 
year, the two countries agreed to a strict timetable for confidence-building 
measures and settling of disputes, and there was even talk of turning 
the entire contested area into an international nature reserve. But 
the heart of the contention, the border markings, has eluded solution. 
The two presidents eventually appealed to President Clinton and the 
other guarantors, who said they would help only if the Congresses 
in both Ecuador and Peru agreed to abide by their decision. Though 
legislators overwhelmingly agreed to turn the guarantors into arbiters, 
debates in both capitals revolved around martyrs, national sovereignty 
and the nature of democracy. As the Congresses convened Thursday afternoon, 
demonstrators turned out in both capitals calling for ``peace with 
dignity,'' and legislators in both countries said _ perhaps inauspiciously 
_ that they expected final borders favoring their side. In Quito, 
Ecuador, Gen. Paco Moncayo, chief of the armed forces, told Congress 
there was no other way to resolve the dispute and presented a letter 
signed by top military leaders backing that view. Jaime Nebot, a party 
leader who had lost the presidential election to Mahuad in July, also 
supported the move Friday, saying it was time for Congress ``to assume 
responsibilities and make decisions.'' Those opposing the vote labeled 
it a surrender of national sovereignty. Carlos Ferrero, a Peruvian 
legislator whose cousin, Eduardo Ferrero Costa, had resigned his post 
as foreign minister over the proposal, called for a popular referendum 
to approve any borders that the guarantor nations present. ``To try 
to close the border by punching a hole in democracy is an error as 
dangerous as can be,'' he said. Francisco Chirinos Soto, a columnist 
for a Peruvian daily, Cambio, called the congressional vote a ``jump 
into the void,'' since the Congresses had no idea what they were ultimately 
accepting.
