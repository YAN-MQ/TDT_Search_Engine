25 years after he seized power in Chile, general augusto Pinochet 
is under arrest in Britain charged with murder. CNN has confirmed 
the former dictator was arrested in London last night. It's unclear 
where police are holding the 82-year-old former dictator. But his 
arrest came by virtue of a Spanish extradition warrant, which accuses 
him of murdering Spanish citizens in Chile between 1973 and 1983. 
Chile's ambassador to Britain plans to seek Pinochet's release, because 
as a senator in Chile he holds a diplomatic passport. Pinochet was 
in London recuperating from back surgery.
