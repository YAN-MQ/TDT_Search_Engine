Three additional suspects in a sexual assault on a trio of Swiss women 
have been identified but not yet found, police said Saturday. Two 
women were raped when they were kidnapped Wednesday on their way out 
of an animal reserve in northern KwaZulu-Natal. A third woman escaped 
being raped by saying she was ill. Police arrested two suspects on 
Friday. Police spokesman Capt. Charl Scheepers said Saturday that 
the police have since identified three additional suspects. The three 
women _ two age 31, the other 37 _ arrived in South Africa earlier 
this week for a holiday and to visit friends in KwaZulu-Natal. The 
attack would cause irreparable damage to South Africa's budding tourism 
industry, said Peter Mokaba, Deputy Minister of Tourism. ``The people 
that will be most affected economically from the (attack) will be 
those living in the area, who sell arts and crafts and fruit along 
the roadside,'' said Sakkie Hattingh, executive director of KwaZulu-Natal's 
tourism promoters, Timeless Afrika.
