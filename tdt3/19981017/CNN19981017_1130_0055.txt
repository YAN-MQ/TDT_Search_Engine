President Clinton is heading to the wye river conference center in 
queensland, Maryland, to join the Middle East peace talks. Mr. Clinton 
will meet separately with Israeli prime minister Benjamin netanyahu 
and Palestinian authority President Yasser Arafat. Andrea Koppel looks 
at how things are progressing so far. Okay, and what would happen 
if somebody would breach the agreement. Then we will take it up with 
the leaders. Despite the best efforts of U.S. officials to control 
the flow of information, limited news about the summit is getting 
out. You know, we're talking. I don't know if we're going to reach 
anything, but we're talking. Still, for two peoples who had done little 
talking during the last year and a half, U.S. officials say these 
intensive closed-door chats show progress. It does appear that there 
is a better and more constructive atmosphere that's been -- and more 
pragmatic atmosphere to work on these problems than there had been 
in the past. Although Thursday's formal gathering at the wye river 
conference center was the last opportunity for pictures, administration 
officials say palestinian authority chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli 
prime minister benjamin Netanyahu have already met informally several 
times over the last two days, including a dinner and lunch with secretary 
of state Madeleine albright. In addition, state department spokesman 
James Rubin says working groups from both sides met Friday to negotiate 
the following issues -- Something a member of prime minister Netanyahu's 
Likud party reiterated friday is the most important of all issues 
for the Israelis. Most of the people in Israel want peace. We are 
tired of wars. And everyone wants an agreement. Senior Palestinian 
sources tell CNN, at the summit's first dinner, President Clinton 
issued a Stern warning to both sides to reach an agreement by Monday 
night or the U.S. would be forced to reevaluate its role. Andrea Koppel,
