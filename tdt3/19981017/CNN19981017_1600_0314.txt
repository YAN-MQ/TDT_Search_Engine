The house and Senate will vote Tuesday on a $500 billion federal spending 
bill. Because of the delay in the vote, Congress passed another stopgap 
resolution to keep the government running until the Bill is completed. 
President Clinton focused on the economy in his weekly radio address. 
Mr. Clinton said the United States must protect its own prosperity 
while working to stabilize global markets. Our economy is the strongest 
in a generation, we have a budget surplus and new jobs, unemployment 
at a 28-year low, inflation at historic lows. Wages are once again 
on the rise. More than ever, this economic strength rest upon the 
strength of an increasingly interdependent world. Our own recent growth 
depends on exports of American goods and services, but over the past 
year, the world's markets in turmoil, countries are having a hard 
time managing their own economies and affording American goods, from 
computer chips to jumbo jets.
