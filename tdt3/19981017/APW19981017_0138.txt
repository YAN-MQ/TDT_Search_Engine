Yugoslavia's ambassador to London said Saturday that Serb forces will 
pull out of Kosovo province ahead of a new NATO deadline and in time 
to avoid threatened air strikes. ``I am convinced that our leader 
(Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic) has been pulling his troops 
out of Kosovo,'' Milos Radulovic said in an interview with British 
Broadcasting Corp. radio. Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw remaining 
Serb forces from Kosovo, begin negotiations with ethnic Albanians 
toward self-rule in the southern Serbian province, and allow up to 
300,000 refugees to go home. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
on Friday gave Milosevic another 10 days, until Oct. 27, to comply 
with international demands and pull his troops out of Kosovo or face 
air attacks. Milosevic has met another demand by allowing 2,000 foreign 
monitors into the province. Radulovic dismissed reports that Serbian 
forces were remaining in large numbers. ``If you ask separatists, 
then you can be sure that they will say no forces were pulled out,'' 
said the envoy said. Radulovic said the Yugoslav authorities have 
also llowed more than 400 journalists into Kosovo, as well as humanitarian 
organizations. ''There are so many people. So the situation is quite 
transparent there,'' he said. Hundreds of people have been killed 
since Milosevic began his crackdown on Kosovo in February to crush 
the rebel Kosova Liberation Army. Its soldiers have killed more than 
200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal to Milosevic's 
government. Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of Kosovo's 
2 million inhabitants, and most of them favor independence or substantial 
self-rule.
