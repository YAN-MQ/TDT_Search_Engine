Containing Palestinian extremists has long been a priority for Arafat, 
and it remains his biggest and toughest challenge back home, where 
our coverage continues now with NBC's Martin Fletcher in Israel. The 
murders earlier this month of two Israelis illustrate arafat's biggest 
problem. Unless his police can keep Islamic militants from killing 
Israelis, Israel says there can be no peace agreement. A guarantee 
of success in the fight against terrorism has been the biggest stumbling 
block in the peace talks. Arafat says he's doing his best. His police 
have arrested hundreds of Hamas fighters -- Muslim extremists whose 
goal is to kill the peace process and, ultimately, destroy Israel. 
Palestinian police have broken up terror cells, stopped suicide bombers 
and frightened people into withdrawing support from Hamas. But increasingly, 
critics say, those tough tactics are becoming routine, used every 
day against ordinary Palestinians who are not extremists. It looks 
like a police state today. Bassem eid is a Palestinian human rights 
investigator. He has testimony from 36 Palestinians who claim they 
were tortured for not paying taxes. And this man says police tortured 
him for 45 days, calling him a terrorist. He says, "they pulled out 
my toenails and fingernails, electrocuted me." After seven months, 
he was released without charge. The Palestinian police admit 20 people 
have died in custody. But eid says it isn't all Arafat's fault. I 
am blaming the Israelis and the Americans because of the pressure 
that they are trying from time to time to put on Arafat. With about 
40,000 policemen, Arafat's aides say some misconduct is inevitable. 
Things are improving, but not to the extent that I would say "sit 
here now" and say, "everything is okay." Everything is not okay. Yasser 
Arafat is paying a heavy price for the crackdown that israel is demanding. 
All opinion polls show he is losing support among his people, who 
accuse him of doing Israel's work. Martin Fletcher, NBC.
