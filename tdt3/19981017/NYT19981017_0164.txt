This time of year is difficult for the family of Tracy Fresquez _ 
it marks the anniversary of both her birth and her death. This year, 
Lori Owens woke up on Sept. 8, which would have been the 38th birthday 
of Ms. Fresquez, her only sister, and, though nine months pregnant, 
set off for the cemetery to visit her grave. About halfway there, 
Ms. Owens felt ill and turned back. After midnight, she gave birth 
to a boy. That day, ``I thought about her a lot,'' said Ms. Owens, 
who was 16 when her 19-year-old sister was found strangled in her 
Shawnee, Kan., apartment on Oct. 6, 1979. Her killer had never been 
found. But last month there was news: A Virginia man had turned himself 
in to Kansas City authorities and confessed to killing Ms. Fresquez. 
The man, Daniel Leroy Crocker, 38, a father of two, has been charged 
with first-degree murder and is being held in the Johnson County, 
Kan., jail in lieu of $100,000 bond. Crocker had never been a suspect 
in the case. ``All we know is that he's doing what is right now,'' 
said Crocker's wife, Nicolette, in an interview from her home in Chantilly, 
Va. Mrs. Crocker met her husband when they both lived in the Kansas 
City area, and before they were married 11 years ago, he told her 
about killing the woman, she said. The couple, who now have an 8-year-old 
girl and a 9-year-old boy, had kept the secret all these years. ``When 
you have something hidden in your heart, it's going to keep coming 
to the surface,'' said Mrs. Crocker, who said her husband's religious 
faith prompted him to come forward. Crocker, an active member of the 
Fairfax Assembly of God in Virginia, had recently counseled a prison 
inmate through the Prison Fellowship Ministries and decided to confide 
in the fellowship pastor, the Rev. Al Lawrence, about the murder. 
Lawrence, assistant pastor at Shiloh Baptist Church in Alexandria, 
along with volunteer lawyers at the Fellowship Ministries, helped 
Crocker surrender to the authorities. A murder warrant was issued 
on Sept. 23, after Shawnee police questioned Crocker. ``This is one 
of those cases that nagged a lot of people involved in it for a real 
long time,'' said Dave Burger, a detective at the time. Ms. Fresquez 
apparently met her killer on Oct. 5, 1979, at a convenience store 
and the two went to a party. It is unclear whether they knew each 
other. Police have said that the two went to her second-floor apartment 
and the assailant left but returned before midnight and slipped inside. 
Burger, now a police captain in Lenexa, Kan., a neighboring suburb, 
recalled questions of the case _ like the fingerprints on a beer can 
found in Ms. Fresquez's bedroom that were never identified. For years, 
investigators periodically checked the prints against those of criminals 
across the country, and the case file grew to about 2,000 pages. The 
authorities' key physical evidence is expected to be the fingerprints. 
``You feel a real strong obligation to the victim,'' Burger said. 
``This was a girl who, by all accounts, had a bright future ahead 
of her.'' Ms. Fresquez had just graduated from high school the year 
before and was working in the credit department at a Montgomery Ward 
when she stopped by on the day she died to check on her mother. The 
oldest of three children, the two girls and a boy, she had spent a 
lot of time taking care of her mother, Judith, whose multiple sclerosis 
was diagnosed when Tracy was 6. ``My wife, she suffered so much,'' 
Louis Fresquez, the children's father, said of Judith Fresquez's reaction 
to their daughter's death. Mrs. Fresquez died in 1991 at 49. Now, 
Crocker's confession is forcing the Fresquez family to relive painful 
memories. ``The emotions are too high for people to think about closure,'' 
Ms. Owens said. She, along with her older brother, Jay, 37, and their 
father, 58, who all still live in the Kansas City area, are troubled 
by the portrayal of Crocker as a hero because he confessed to the 
killing. Louis Fresquez, who works in a window-glass shop, said, ``It 
took him 19 years to find this sudden belief in God.'' Crocker, who 
quit his job as a warehouse manager, would be sentenced under a 1979 
Kansas law, which provides only one penalty for first-degree murder: 
a life term with eligibility for parole after 15 years. The current 
law requires a minimum 25 years in prison. A hearing is scheduled 
for Oct. 30. The Crockers' family and church have been supportive, 
both emotionally and financially, Mrs. Crocker said. ``It's so good 
not to be hiding anymore,'' she said. But the Fresquez family must 
relive the killing, being interviewed again as the murder case is 
reinvestigated. Ms. Owens said, ``He took her life. The issues of 
what and how and when _ they are just details. The issue is Tracy. 
There is no reason good enough.''
