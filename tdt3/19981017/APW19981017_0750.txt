CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ U.S. islands in the Caribbean 
are leading the way in the effort to preserve coral reefs, but enforcement 
of protective laws is still lax and reefs are easily lost. Those were 
among the conclusions from a conference of scientists and resource 
managers from eight southern U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and 
the Virgin Islands that concluded here this weekend. ``The U.S. islands 
have taken the lead in the country on coral reef protection,'' said 
Joseph A. Uravitch, chief of the Coastal programs Division of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But there is still 
much scientists don't understand about reefs. They just know how easily 
they can be lost. A little too much rain, a little too much runoff, 
seawater a few degrees too warm, a few carelessly dropped boat anchors 
_ these are just a few of the many influences that can upset the fragile 
balance that keeps coral reefs thriving. Reefs are a balanced community 
of plants and animals ranging from fish to algae, said Ralf H. Boulon, 
an endangered species coordinator with the U.S. Virgin Islands parks 
service. ``All are part of the chain, part of the balance,'' said 
Boulon. ``We don't know the role that each organism plays in a reef. 
Normally you only find out when one of these animals disappears.'' 
Humans cause many of the threats. Removal of mangroves eliminates 
natural filtering and lets sediment into the sea. Pollution and runoff 
kill reefs. Damage from boats and even tourists breaking off pieces 
of coral for souvenirs have taken a toll. ``Coral reefs around the 
world are all in trouble, they are all declining,'' said Michael Crosby 
of NOAA. ``There's a lot of stress from changes in the ecosystem.'' 
The Virgin Islands is among the areas trying to preserve its reefs, 
and is having at least some success, said Virdin Brown, assistant 
commissioner for the territory's parks and natural resources division. 
``We have a better management of coastal pollution than many jurisdictions 
across the United States because of recent legislation and increasing 
controls over wastewater runoff,'' said Brown. While the laws are 
on the books, enforcement needs improvement, however, said Boulon. 
``I would say we're somewhere in the middle in terms of reef protection 
efforts,'' he said.
