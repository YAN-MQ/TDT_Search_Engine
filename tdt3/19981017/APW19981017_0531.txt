Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist who now leads Italy's largest 
leftist party, said Saturday first talks with potential coalition 
partners, including hard-line Communists, indicated he might succeed 
in forming a new government. Italy's political situation these days 
is so volatile that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on Friday stopped 
short of formally asking D'Alema to try to form of government. Instead, 
the head of state said he was giving D'Alema the ``pre-task'' of testing 
the waters to see if there was enough consensus to actually try to 
put together a coalition. D'Alema consulted on Saturday with leaders 
of parties which could join forces in a new center-left coalition, 
including his own Democratic Left party, a group of breakway Communists 
and a third potential ally, a movement of ex-Christian Democrats led 
by former President Francesco Cossiga. D'Alema's party was the major 
partner in Romano Prodi's 2 1-2 year-old coalition which collapsed 
Oct. 9 after losing a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies. 
``I see that there are the conditions to go ahead'' with talks, D'Alema 
said. Said Armando Cossutta, who leads a breakaway faction of Communists: 
``We have expressed to our comrade Massimo D'Alema our willingness 
and our commitment toward ... the success of his government.'' Cossutta 
broke away from the No. 1 Communist leader, Fausto Bertinotti, whose 
refused to back Prodi in the confidence vote because he wanted more 
funds for job creation. Bertinotti's followers marched through Rome 
Saturday to demand more jobs. D'Alema called the situation ``complex'' 
because his potential coalition partners ``have had difference experiences 
and will keep different visions on the evolution of the Italian political 
and democratic system.'' D'Alema, a pragmatist who, earlier this decade, 
helped transform the West's largest Communist party into the current, 
more moderate Democratic Left, invited all three main forces to sit 
down together to work out ``a sufficiently solid political and policy 
base.'' Scalfaro turned to D'Alema after Prodi, now serving as caretaker 
premier, failed to forge a consensus on a fresh start for his center-left 
coalition. D'Alema was scheduled to report back to Scalfaro on Monday 
evening. Cossiga's supporters originally were loyal to opposition 
leader Silvio Berlusconi, media mogul and ex-premier, but Cossiga 
has indicated he might throw support to a center-left government. 
Early elections, demanded by Berluscoi, are considered unlikely. Elections 
are not held during the last six months of the head of state's term, 
and that period for Scalfaro begins in January. The Vatican appeared 
unhappy over Scalfaro's turning to D'Alema. Referring to the now defunct 
Soviet-Western blocs, Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano cited 
that ``hard-fought victory of liberty and democracy over communism'' 
and noted that Scalfaro chose a man ``from the apparatus of the former 
Italian Communist Party'' who used to edit the party's daily.
