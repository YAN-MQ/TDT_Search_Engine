Capping a sensational week, world road champion Oscar Camenzind overcame 
an early fall and Michael Boogerd's challenge Saturday to capture 
the Tour of Lombardy, the closing event of the international cycling 
season. Camenzind, a Swiss cyclist with the Mapei commercial team, 
covered the 253 kilometers (157 miles) into this northern town in 
5 hours, 59 minutes, 1 second to beat Dutch champion Boogerd by six 
seconds. The triumphant day for the Swiss colors was completed by 
Nicola Puttini's third-place finish and Pascal Richard's fifth place. 
World Cup champion Michele Bartoli of Italy finished between the two 
Swiss, in fourth. All were credited with the same time, 1:21 behind 
the winner. Camenzind, who clinched the world title in Valkenburg, 
Netherlands, last Sunday for his first season victory, scored his 
solo triumph in the 92nd edition of the Italian classic by launching 
a decisive attack on Boogerd 3.5 kilometers (2.1 miles) from the finish. 
Boogerd had helped Camenzind flee from the pack and carry out a successful 
70-kilometer (45-mile) escape, but could not stay with the world champion's 
pace in the final uphill stretch. ``I pushed hard, I knew I was in 
good form, that I could win today,'' said Camenzind, who had to overcome 
pain from a bruised leg suffered in a spill in the initial part of 
the race. Bartoli, who had already clinched the overall World Cup 
title before Saturday's last race of the 10-round competition, tried 
to catch up the leading duo in the closing kilometers (miles) but 
failed to cut his gap under one minute. ``Camenzind deserved victory. 
He proved the strongest cyclist in the last month of activity,'' Bartoli 
said. Saturday's race was the last one for Italian veteran Gianni 
Bugno, who announced his retirement from professional cycling. Bugno, 
34, won two world titles and a Tour of Italy during his 13-year career.
