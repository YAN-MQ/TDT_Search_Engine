This is Orelon Sidney from the CNN weather center with your "Headline 
News weather update." Later today, an area of low pressure will move 
across the central plains and into the Great Lakes. Showers and thunderstorms 
are expected as this frontal system continues to push eastward through 
the rest of the weekend. A cold front will also move into the northern 
portion of the plains and the rockies, bringing in cooler air from 
Canada. High pressure will still dominate most of the eastern U.S., 
and will be building in the central plains. Temperatures will be in 
the 40s and 50s under the trough out to the west with the Ridge in 
the east continuing temperatures in the 60s, 70s and 80s from the 
Great Lakes to the gulf coast. On the extended forecast picture, it 
will be getting a lot cooler in the east as we head from Monday into 
Tuesday. A mix of rain and snow is possible across the Great Lakes 
on Tuesday with scattered showers and a few thunderstorms along the 
gulf coast and the atlantic seaboard. By Wednesday, daytime high temperatures 
will only be in the 50s across the upper peninsula of Michigan and 
into Minnesota. The forecast for more than 6,000 cities can be found 
at CNN.com.
