Laughter rippled from one railroad car to the next, followed by waves 
of applause. These are sounds not normally associated with the early 
morning commute. But this was the 7:44 from New Haven to New York's 
Grand Central Terminal, Travis Ford's train. Ford is the convivial 
conductor who dishes up weather reports, baseball scores, inspirational 
pep talks and greetings in a dozen languages to Metro-North passengers 
on the New Haven line. To connoisseurs of commuting, Ford is a folk 
hero, a font of graciousness in their otherwise rough-and-tumble day. 
``He makes everybody smile,'' said Mike Imber, a consultant from Westport. 
``He gives passengers something in common. It's refreshing to see 
somebody who has such a joy for what he does.'' True to his word, 
Imber had made friends that very morning with Michele Ross, Tom Root 
and Rolan Young, his seatmates in car No. 8554. Grumpy strangers when 
they boarded the train _ each bent over laptop, cell phone, newspaper 
or sales report _ they were pals by the time the train thundered into 
the tunnel. Together, they heard Ford's five-day forecast (mostly 
sunny and breezy with temperatures in the mid-60s), his predictions 
for the World Series (Yankees in seven) and his buoyant charge to 
have a good day. ``Sock it to them! Take no prisoners! Storm the fort!'' 
Ford urged, varying his command from car to car. ``You can't help 
but step off this train with a spring in your step,'' said Ms. Young, 
a lawyer. She began the ride convinced that she would find Ford's 
jollity unbearable. But by the time the train got to South Norwalk, 
she was a convert. ``I wonder what coffee he drinks,'' she said. Ford 
didn't miss a beat. ``Chock Full o' Nuts,'' he said, to the roar of 
the crowd. For regulars on this train, and on the 5:03 p.m. from Grand 
Central, this month brings sad news. Next Sunday, with the end of 
daylight saving time and the attendant changes in the schedule, Ford 
will no longer be their conductor. Instead, his commuter runs will 
be the 6:36 a.m. from New Haven and the 3:35 p.m. return. ``That could 
change commuting patterns,'' said Imber, as if predicting movement 
in the Dow Jones. Many commuters have already endured the disappearance 
of Ford from their route. Naima Quarles, for one, used to see him 
on the 8:19 from Pelham and said he ``took the edge off'' her morning. 
Recently, Ms. Quarles found herself on a midday train, immersed in 
a well-worn copy of The Daily Bible. Suddenly, Ford bounded into the 
car. ``Ticket time!'' he cried. ``I'll take any kind of ticket but 
a parking ticket.'' Ms. Quarles glowed. On the same train, Gilbert 
Ramirez hugged the conductor. Ramirez, a commuter on a run that used 
to be Ford's, found himself in New Rochelle for an appointment. He 
let one train go by and waited for the next because he had heard that 
Ford might be on it. Ford, a New Haven native, worked in the maintenance 
department of Metro-North for more than a decade before becoming a 
conductor a dozen years ago. The pay was better, he said, but most 
of all he loved the contact with customers. Word of his extemporaneous 
banter spread, and soon he was profiled in a Connecticut magazine 
and interviewed on a late-night talk show. Passengers with high-powered 
jobs tried to lure him into sales. Ford, approaching retirement, would 
rather have a shot forecasting the weather for a local television 
station. ``I don't want to take anybody's job,'' he said. ``But maybe 
I could sub for them.'' He is a man who takes pleasure in a kind gesture. 
He poses for snapshots with passengers. He compliments them on a pretty 
dress. He scavenges New York City tabloids off the floor at Grand 
Central and takes them to a Stamford ticket clerk. Ford's morning 
passengers were plotting the other day how to reward him with a World 
Series ticket. What if they each chipped in $2? What if they wrote 
to George Steinbrenner? ``He has plenty of tickets up in his sky box,'' 
Ms. Ross said. George? Are you listening?
