CNN has confirmed, former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet is under 
arrest in England. British police took Pinochet into custody last 
night, after receiving a Spanish warrant for his arrest. The warrant 
charges Pinochet with the murder of Spanish citizens in Chile during 
his reign from 1973 to '83. Pinochet was in England for surgery for 
a herniated disc in his back. The Chilean government says it will 
seek Pinochet's release on the grounds that he travels on a diplomatic 
passport but says it has nothing to do with the judicial aspect of 
the case.
