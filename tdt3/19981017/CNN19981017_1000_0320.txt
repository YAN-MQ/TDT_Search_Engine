Family and friends are remembering Matthew shepard as a gentle man. 
They attended a funeral for the 21-year-old college student yesterday 
in casper, Wyoming, yesterday. Shepard died Monday, five days after 
he was pistol-whipped and tied to a Fence. Police say robbery was 
the primary motive, but shepard apparently was also singled out because 
he was gay. Two men have been charged with murder. Some anti-gay protesters 
gathered near the church yesterday, despite a city council ban on 
picketing. Shepard's family is thanking the public for its support. 
On behalf of our son Matthew shepard, we want to thank the citizens 
of the United States and the people of the world who have expressed 
their deepest sympathy and condolences to our family during these 
trying times. A person as caring and loving as our son Matt would 
be overwhelmed by what this incident has done to the hearts and souls 
of people around the world. Following shepard's death, a number of 
political leaders have called on congress to pass hate crimes legislation 
that protects gays and lesbians.
