The head of an organization that has battled for the return of Holocaust 
survivors' assets said Saturday that ten European nations have decided 
to distribute about six tons of looted Nazi gold among themselves 
without conferring with Jewish organizations. Avraham Burg, co-chairman 
of the World Jewish Restitution Organization, said in a statement 
released to the press, that the countries decided not to include Jewish 
organizations in dispersing the gold which has been stored in the 
vaults of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York and the Bank of England 
in London. According to an aide to Burg, it was decided at the 41-nation 
conference that tried to trace the trail of looted Nazi gold in London 
last December, that the U.S.-British-French Tripartite Gold Commission 
panel would examine if any of part of the six tons of gold rightfully 
belonged to the Jewish people before any dispersal was decided on. 
``We will find the way to prevent this theft, to trace the amount 
which belongs to the Jews and to return it its owners,'' Burg said 
in the statement. Burg was traveling and could not be reached for 
additional comment. Some Jewish groups insist that the leftover gold 
form the core of a fund to compensate Holocaust victims. For 50 years, 
the Tripartite Gold Commission returned hundreds of tons of stolen 
gold to countries plundered by Nazi Germany. The Tripartite Commission 
is funded from the 5.5 tons of gold that remains. This was to have 
been distributed among 10 countries that have received Tripartite 
gold: Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic, 
Greece, Austria, Albania, Yugoslavia and Italy. These are the countries 
Burg claimed have signed an agreement to disperse the remaining gold 
among themselves. At December's conference in London, participants 
agreed to seek financial restitution for victims of Nazi persecution. 
The United States set an end-of-the-century deadline for distributing 
cash to Holocaust survivors, many nearing the end of their lives.
