For Rangers coach John Muckler, it was time to pass out praise and 
stress the positive. He spoke of how young Todd Harvey was the ``heartbeat 
of the team'' with almost 17 energetic minutes at center. Then there 
was the impressive play of the rookie goalie, Dan Cloutier, who stopped 
28 Devils shots Friday night in Madison Square Garden. And who could 
overlook the encouraging debut of Mathieu Schneider, the defenseman 
acquired in a trade from Toronto? Muckler called Schneider a great 
improvement of his roster, in place of Aleksandr Karpovtsev. All this 
is not to ignore the fine play of the first line of Niklas Sundstrom, 
Wayne Gretzky and Aleksei Kovalev. They produced one goal and put 
11 shots on Devils goalie Martin Brodeur. ``It's funny,'' Muckler 
said. ``We're standing here talking about all the guys who played 
well and we didn't win.'' No, they lost by 2-1 to the Devils, their 
fourth defeat in four games, their worst start since 1959. Their worst 
start before that was 0-11, in 1943. The Rangers have scored only 
four goals in four games, and they went 0 for 7 Friday night on the 
power play. The Devils' Patrik Elias scored the game-winner, at 10 
minutes 53 seconds of the third period, when he knocked in a rebound 
past a sprawling Cloutier after the Devils had controlled a face-off 
in the Rangers' zone. But the play that hurt the most came in the 
first minute, the first shot of the game, when Bobby Holik gave the 
Devils a 1-0 lead after stripping the puck from Brian Leetch as Leetch 
tried to skate out of his own zone. ``I think Brian Leetch was surprised,'' 
Holik said. ``I jumped him.'' After Holik knocked the puck off Leetch's 
stick, Dave Andreychuk recovered it, then passed to Holik, who had 
lots of net at which to aim at the 22-second mark because Cloutier 
had shifted toward the loose puck. Leetch blamed himself, saying that 
the first thing a young defenseman learns is not to go in front of 
his own net unless he is sure that it is a safe play. ``It's unexcusable 
to do that on the first shift of the game,'' Leetch said. The goal 
broke a 26-game slump for Holik, which included five games in last 
spring's playoffs. Sundstrom scored the only Ranger goal, on the rush, 
at 6:09 of the first period. Sundstrom had a chance to give his team 
the lead in the third on a breakaway while short-handed and the score 
tied. But Brodeur, who had 24 saves, stopped his forehand wrist shot 
from the slot. The victory gave the Devils a 1-2 record under Robbie 
Ftorek, their new coach. It was a scrappy, energetic affair. ``It's 
always nice to get it on the road, especially in the Garden,'' Holik 
said. ``These two teams will not let the fans down.'' Harvey was playing 
his second game of the season after having missed the previous two 
with a hip injury. He joined the Rangers late last season in the trade 
with Dallas that sent Brian Skrudland and Mike Keane to the Stars. 
Harvey centered a line with Adam Graves on the left and Mike Knuble 
on the right, and they forechecked hard in the Devils' zone. Early 
in the game, Harvey angered the Devils by bumping into Brodeur. Several 
Devils tried to avenge this. One was defenseman Sheldon Souray, who 
took a roughing penalty early in the second period. Later, during 
a Rangers power play, Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko jousted with Harvey 
in the slot in front of Brodeur after Harvey again made contact with 
the goalie. Near the end of the second period, Harvey created another 
power play for the Rangers when Andreychuk punched him, snapping his 
head back in exaggerated motion. The Devils had only two power plays. 
After the game, Harvey was explaining his style: ``Sometimes I bring 
it upon myself. That's the way I play. If the other team's mad at 
me, maybe I'm doing my job.'' But he was interrupted by the gruff 
voice of Muckler, on the way to the bus to go to the airport to go 
to Pittsburgh for Saturday night's game. ``Todd,'' Muckler said, ending 
the interview. ``We've got a game tomorrow.'' With that, they headed 
down the corridor and out into the night, a short flight and a long 
season ahead.
