The 34th annual Head of the Charles regatta, the autumn rowing festival 
in Boston with an entry of close to 6,000 North American and international 
collegiate, club and veteran rowers, began competition Saturday over 
a three-mile stretch of the Charles River. Originally patterned after 
the English-style races in which crews compete against the clock rather 
than in side-by-side racing, the Head of the Charles has evolved its 
own American flavor, equal parts competition and rowing reunion. Thousands 
of former competitive rowers joined with current participants and 
parents, all sporting the colors of their favorite crews, to cheer 
on their teams as they raced upstream. The cheering should reach a 
crescendo for Sunday's final of the men's championship eight, when 
the U.S. national team, racing for the first time since winning the 
gold medal at the world rowing championships in Cologne, Germany, 
last month, seeks to defend its Head of the Charles title. ``I've 
mixed up the boat,'' said Mike Teti, the men's national team coach. 
``Wolf Moser, who captained Harvard last year, will stroke because 
Harvard starts right behind us. That should give Wolf a real incentive.'' 
Chris Ahrens, who stroked the U.S. eight to a gold medal in the 1997 
world championships and then repeated that performance this year in 
Cologne to achieve the first back-to-back world eight-oar titles in 
U.S. rowing history, will be in the two seat Sunday. ``Chris is a 
special guy in a very unassuming way, and is supportive of everyone,'' 
said Teti, who first coached Ahrens as a Princeton freshman before 
moving on two years ago to become the National Team coach, bringing 
Ahrens along and installing him in the stroke seat of the eight. ``What 
I have tried to do on the National Team is create the same atmosphere 
as the oarsmen had in college,'' Teti said. ``No rower in America 
ever picked up an oar for the first time and said, `I want to be in 
the Olympics.' They picked it up because it looked like fun. Other 
coaches might say my approach is a bit immature, but I'm no intellectual 
and believe rowing should be fun.'' Teti, the second oldest of 10 
siblings, started rowing in the spring of his junior year at Monsignor 
Bonner High School near Philadelphia ``as a good way to stay in shape 
for football.'' By the time his senior year rolled around, football 
was forgotten. Teti has been rowing ever since, as a student at St. 
Joseph's University in Philadelphia and as a member of the U.S. National 
Team from 1977 until 1993. He has won numerous medals, including a 
gold as the bowman in the 1987 world championship eight. That same 
year Teti was chosen National Team oarsman of the year. Ten years 
later, in his first year coaching the National Team, the United States 
regained the eight-oar title, and then retained it this year. Bob 
Kaehler, 34, the two-man in this year's eight who will sit out the 
race Saturday to give other squad members a chance to compete, knows 
Teti both as a former teammate and now as his coach. ``I don't mean 
this unkindly, but it's nice to have an American coaching us,'' said 
Kaehler, alluding to the previous National Team coaches who were from 
Europe. ``It's special having Mike.'' Kaehler will get a chance to 
watch Teti race with his reunioning 1988 Seoul Olympic eight racing 
in the same event as his world champion teammates. ``I guess I know 
who will win that one,'' said Teti. In the spirit of the Head of the 
Charles, Kaehler will have two favorites to cheer on.
