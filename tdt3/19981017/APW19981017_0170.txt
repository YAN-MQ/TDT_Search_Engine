Nahoko Hirao shot a 2-under-par 70 in the occasional rain Saturday 
and surged ahead for a three-stroke lead going into the final round 
of the 60 million yen (dlrs 506,000) Fujitsu Ladies. Hirao, who has 
yet to win in two years as a pro, sank three birdies against a bogey 
in negotiating the wet and windswept 6,483-yard (5,900-meter), par-72 
Tokyu 700 Club course. The round left Hirao at a 7-under 137 total, 
three shots ahead of Miyuki Shimabukuro, who turned in a 71 for 140. 
``I was hitting approach shots close today,'' said the 24-year-old 
Hirao. ``I'm more satisfied with today's under-par round than yesterday's 
5-under.'' ``I'm not that excited about tomorrow, and I don't feel 
much pressure, either,'' Hirao added. ``I'll just take it one shot 
at a time.'' Hirao, however, will have to overcome half a dozen heavy 
hitters in striking distance. South Korean Kim Man-soo and Taiwan's 
Cheng Mei-chi fired 68s, the day's lowest, and shared third place 
at 141 with Kaori Higo, Yuri Fudo and Kumiko Hiyoshi. Higo went around 
in 72, and Fudo and Hiyoshi in 73 each. Aki Takamura shot a 72 for 
a share of eighth at 142 with Chieko Nishida, who carded a 74. Overnight 
leader Toshimi Kimura struggled to a 78 for a share of 15th at 144.
