Florida neighbors Mark O'Meara and Tiger Woods were headed to the 
finals of the World Match Play Championship when they each led after 
the first 18 of 36 holes in Saturday's semifinals. O'Meara was crushing 
defending champion Vijay Singh, leading by a massive 10 holes, but 
Woods was only one hole ahead of England's Westwood. The start of 
play Saturday was delayed 2 1/2 hours by rain with organizers doubtful 
both matches would be completed if they went the full 36 holes. O'Meara, 
this year's Masters and British Open champion, had nine birdies in 
his first 18 with birdie putts of 36 (12 meters), 18 (6 meters), 12 
(4 meters) and 10 feet (3 meters). Woods had to struggle. He was down 
by three holes after the first seven _ due to Westwood's good putting 
and his poor putting and iron play. But he rallied to win the 10th 
with a par, the 13th with a birdie (12 footer/4 meters) and squared 
with another birdie on the 16th with a short putt. He took the lead 
on the 502-yard 18th when he got on in two and down in two. Westwood 
hit a bunker on his drive, another bunker at the edge of the green 
on his second and needed three to get down from there. ``Vijay is 
a good friend of mine, and he may make some birdies this afternoon 
(in the second 18),'' O'Meara said. ``I didn't make any mistakes. 
I just have to keep it going.'' In Friday's quarterfinals, Singh defeated 
Patrik Sjoland 7 and 6, O'Meara won over Colin Montgomerie 5 and 4, 
Westwood beat three-time champion Ernie Els 2 and 1, and Woods defeated 
Ian Woosnam 1-up on the 37th hole _ the first of a sudden-death playoff. 
Woods said after Friday's tight win _ and anticipating a tough match 
with Westwood _ he wasn't banking on a final against O'Meara. ``I 
have my work cut out... and Mark has his work cut out for him,'' said 
the flu-ridden Woods, who has been fighting the bug since he arrived 
in Britain last week for the Dunhill Cup.
