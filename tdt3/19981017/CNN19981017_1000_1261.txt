Game one of the world series between San Diego and New York takes 
place in less than 24 hours at Yankee stadium. David Wells will pitch 
for the American league champions. The padres will counter with Kevin 
brown. It's been a while since I faced most these guys over here anyhow, 
so I don't know if there's any real advantage one way or the other. 
Some of them haven't seen me in the past. I'm probably a little bit 
different than what they remember anyhow. To me it's going to be very 
nerve-racking but, you know, I'm ready for it. I think that it's, 
you know, this to me is a dream come true. You know, it's just a lot 
of memories are going to be built up into one. And for me, you know, 
I know it's going to be hard because, you know, now that I'm what 
the New York Yankees and very proud to be here, but it's something 
that I have the job to do and I can't really worry about, you know, 
who is out there and all that. It's going to be great to go see family 
and friends, but I have a job to do.
