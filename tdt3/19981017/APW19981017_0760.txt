Turkey and Syria will hold direct talks on Turkish Kurd insurgents, 
beginning Monday, Egypt's official news agency said Saturday. The 
talks will start either in the Turkish capital, Ankara, or in the 
Syrian one, Damascus, the Middle East News Agency said. The delegations 
would be headed by high-ranking security officials. The agency did 
not give a source for its report and officials could be reached for 
confirmation Saturday. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak played a leading 
role in mediating the long-running dispute that flared up on Oct. 
6 when Ankara delivered what it termed a `final warning' to Damascus 
over Syria's alleged support for Turkish Kurd insurgents. Monday's 
discussions will focus on Turkey's demand that Syria clamp down on 
the activities of the Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, the agency 
said. Ankara accuses Damascus of allowing PKK guerrillas to cross 
into southeastern Turkey from northern Syria and to train in camps 
in parts of Lebanon under Syrian military control. Syria denies the 
accusations and in turn accuses Turkey of taking an unfair share of 
the water of the Euphrates river. Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin 
told reporters Oct. 13 that Syria appeared to have shut down Kurdish 
camps in eastern Lebanon. The announcement indicated an easing of 
tension.
