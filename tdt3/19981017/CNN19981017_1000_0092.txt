Now that NATO has extended a deadline for Yugoslav President Slobodan 
milosevic to fulfill his agreement, the question is will he or won't 
he? About 2,000 unarmed observers arrive today in Kosovo to determine 
whether milosevic really is withdrawing troops from the province. 
He has ten days to do so. A convoy of tanks and trucks left Kosovo 
last night. But some reporters say there is evidence to support Kosovo 
liberation army claims the Serbian presence actually is growing. Serbian 
forces have killed hundreds of ethnic Albanians and thousands have 
been driven from their homes.
