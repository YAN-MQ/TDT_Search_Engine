New York will honor baseball slugger Sammy Sosa with a parade today. 
Yesterday, Sosa received a medal from the city's Cardinal John O'Connor. 
For his activism in the Catholic church. Sosa broke former New York 
Yankee star Roger Maris' home run record this season, as did St. Louis 
Cardinal Mark McGwire. Sosa hit 66 homers. McGwire hit 70. Sosa is 
from the Dominican republic and is considered a hero in New York's 
dominican neighborhoods.
