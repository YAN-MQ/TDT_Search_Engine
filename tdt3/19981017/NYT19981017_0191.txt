A 57-year-old patient at a city hospital on Roosevelt Island was arrested 
Friday night and accused of sexually molesting two catatonic women 
in their beds. A nurse at the Coler-Goldwater Memorial Hospital walked 
into a room where the women were shortly before 8 p.m. and found a 
man who was apparently sexually abusing them, police said. She then 
called hospital security, who detained the suspect, William Green, 
until officers from the 114th Precinct arrived. Officer George Jensen, 
a spokesman for the Police Department, said the suspect and the two 
women, an 83-year-old and a 45-year-old, were all patients in the 
hospital's long-term care program. ``It is for people who cannot take 
care of themselves,'' he said. Regina Lehman, an administrator at 
the hospital, refused to discuss the incident. A hospital official 
speaking on the condition of anonymity said Green was usually confined 
to a wheelchair. Jane Zimmerman, a spokeswoman for the city's Health 
and Hospital Corp., said cases of abuse like the one alleged are infrequent 
in city hospital facilities, particularly in those like Coler-Goldwater, 
which is a nursing home. ``It is more likely to happen in an acute-care 
hospital because of the high volume of people coming in and out, but 
even there this would be a rare occurrence,'' she said. ``There is 
no trend here; this is an isolated incident.'' In April, a man waiting 
for a CAT scan at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan 
was charged with attempting to rape an 87-year-old woman with Alzheimer's 
disease. A nurse walked into the woman's room as the suspect was disrobing 
her, police said. A month earlier, a woman in a coma was raped by 
another patient at Brookdale Hospital and Medical Center, according 
to police. This attack was witnessed by a nurse, they said. In cases 
involving hospitals that accept Medicaid patients, the state attorney 
general's office has sometimes investigated such incidents. In a highly 
publicized case in Rochester two years ago, a 32-year-old comatose 
woman became pregnant after she was raped at the Westfall Health Care 
Center. A former nurse's aide, who had been fired after being charged 
with sexually abusing another physically disabled patient, was later 
charged in the woman's rape.
