Seeking new ways to end 12 years of insurgency in northern and western 
Uganda, the government plans to introduce a bill in parliament that 
would offer amnesty to all rebel groups, Radio Uganda said Saturday. 
The state-run radio said the government had appointed five ministers 
to consult with district and regional officials to win support for 
the proposed Amnesty Bill 1998. The report could not be immediately 
confirmed. If true, it would mark a departure from President Yoweri 
Museveni's refusal to negotiate with rebels he has labelled traitors 
and terrorists. ``In accordance with a policy of reconciliation as 
one of the avenues of establishing peace in all parts of the country, 
an amnesty will be extended to all persons engaged in activities of 
war,'' said a statement broadcast over Radio Uganda and issued by 
Ruhakana Rugunda, the minister in charge of the president's office. 
Two major rebel groups and several smaller ones are operating in Uganda: 
the Lord's Resistance Army which has terrorized the north of the county 
from bases in war-torn southern Sudan, and the Allied Democratic Forces 
which is based along Uganda's western border with Congo. Both groups 
regularly raid Ugandan towns and villages, killing and slashing civilians 
and abducting children and teenagers they force to fight or become 
slaves. The ideologies of both groups are not clear. A government 
official said this week that 12,000 students had been abducted in 
northern Uganda since the LRA began operating in 1986 when Museveni 
took power after a five-yer bush war. About half of them have since 
been rescued by the army. Uganda accuses Sudan of backing the LRA 
and the ADF. Khartoum, in turn, accuses Uganda of backing rebels in 
southern Sudan. Radio Uganda said the five ministers would begin their 
nationwide campaign in support of the bill next week. The radio did 
not say when the bill would be presented in parliament.
