NAto began U-2 surveillance flights over the Yugoslav republic today, 
to make sure President Slobodan Milosevic is indeed withdrawing Serb 
forces from Kosovo province. On the ground, it appears that is happening. 
A huge convoy of tanks and armored vehicles departed last night in 
the direction of Serbia. But despite the apparent progress, U.S. officials 
remain wary of Milosevic and NATO is keeping its guns cocked. Yesterday, 
NAto gave Milosevic ten extra days to meet its demands on kosovo, 
which include allowing 2,000 international monitors on the ground.
