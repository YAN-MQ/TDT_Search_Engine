And to the other "hot spots" now in Kosovo. Where Yugoslav forces 
continued their slow redeployment today, while NATO spy planes monitored 
the movements. NAto has given Yugoslavia ten more days to end the 
brutal crackdown on the independence movement in Kosovo province. 
NBC's Ron Allen is there tonight. Today a rare sight in Kosovo, miftar 
and his son rebuilding the family's bombed-out house. Good weather 
means soft mud to hold a new wooden roof together, they're trying 
to finish before winter and while the shelling has stopped. "I don't 
think the fighting is over," he says, "but I have to take the chance 
and fix my house." He's tired of living in the forests, especially 
because there's a new addition to the family, his first granddaughter, 
born today, in a Neighborhood of deserted homes. Thousands of other 
Albanians are still too afraid of Yugoslav army and police, who've 
rampaged through Kosovo, to come home. Now, Kosovo's Albanian leaders 
worry NATO's extended deadline for those troops to pullback sends 
the wrong message to Yugoslav President Milosevic. The winner in this 
case is the maneuvering space which Mr. Milosevic receives in which 
he will use very well for his own terms. While more troops seem to 
withdraw, most international aide workers are returning and racing 
to bring supplies and a sense of security, to the refugees. There 
is a lot of fear, but I think it's also a waiting game. They truly 
want to see if the international community on the ground in large 
numbers makes a difference. The hope is that more refugees will return 
home once thousands of international observers arrive, part of the 
peace plan. But they won't be here for weeks, and they won't have 
weapons to protect themselves, or anyone taking the risk to go home. 
That's one reason sylver and his family expect to be on the run for 
a While. They even took the kitchen stove. "We don't even feel safe 
here," he says, "unless the outside world gives us more protection." 
Like so many of Kosovo's refugees, he fears, not much will change 
after nATO's new deadline has come and gone. Ron Allen, NBC news, 
Kosovo.
