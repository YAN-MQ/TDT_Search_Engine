Diego Maradona used to undergo private drug tests ahead of soccer 
matches to be sure he would not turn in positive results if tested 
by the Italian League, the former Napoli star said in an interview 
published Saturday. Maradona was banned in 1991 for 15 months after 
testing positive for cocaine while playing for Napoli. But the Italian 
news agency ANSA reported Friday that the backup urine sample that 
led to the suspension was conducted on a faulty machine. The report, 
based on sources at the scandal-ridden Acqua Acetosa drug-testing 
laboratory in Rome, alleged that the apparatus erroneously indicated 
there were traces of cocaine in a clean urine control sample run through 
in a check in 1991. Maradona's lawyers have said they may pursue legal 
action. In the interview with Naples newspaper Il Mattino, the player 
said ``I have never denied'' using cocaine, ``but when I went on the 
field I was clean.'' ``I knew for certain that I could not be discovered 
positive, because before every game I would take private tests,'' 
the newspaper quoted him as saying. ``If these allowed me to play 
without any worry, without compromising my career or harming the club, 
then I would go on the field. If the opposite were true, then I stayed 
at home.'' He said that is why ``I have always had suspicions about 
the testing done in Rome.''
