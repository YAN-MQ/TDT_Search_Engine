Arthur I. Bloomfield, an economist, author and educator, died on Oct. 
6 at the Maplewood Park Place Nursing Center in Bethesda, Md., from 
degenerative neurologic disease, his wife, Dorothy, said. He was 84 
and lived in Bethesda. A specialist in international trade and finance, 
Bloomfield wrote many books on the topic, including ``Capital Imports 
and the U.S. Balance of Payments'' (1950), ``Monetary Policy under 
the International Gold Standards, 1880-1914'' and ``Essays in the 
History of International Trade Theory'' (1994). A native of Montreal, 
Bloomfield received his bachelor's and master's degrees from McGill 
University. After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1942 
with a doctorate in economics, he joined the staff of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, where he was a senior economist and consultant 
until 1958. From 1949 to 1950, while at the New York Fed, Bloomfield 
served as a financial adviser to the Bank of Korea, helping to create 
the foundation of the country's central bank in the post-war world. 
He later served as a financial adviser to the Korean Ministry of Finance 
and the U.N. Korean Reconstruction Agency. In 1958, Bloomfield left 
the New York Fed to accept a teaching post at the University of Pennsylvania. 
He remained a member of the economics faculty there until he retired 
in 1985. During that period, he was also a visiting professor at a 
number of institutions, including Columbia and Princeton Universities 
and the University of Melbourne in Australia. Bloomfield is survived 
by his wife, the former Dorothy E. Reese; a sister, Harriet Joseph 
of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a stepson, Alan Reese of Memphis; five nephews; 
and four nieces.
