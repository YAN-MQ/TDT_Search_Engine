Republicans focused on education in their radio address today. Indiana 
senator Dan coates says President Clinton mischaracterized the GOP 
education record during budget negotiations this week. Coates pointed 
to several education bills approved by the republican-led congress, 
including the stronger head start act and the reading excellence act. 
President's rhetoric on education is misleading. He has accused the 
republican Congress of not doing enough for education, yet this Congress 
has passed many critically important education bills. The president 
knows this because he signed these republican bills into law.
