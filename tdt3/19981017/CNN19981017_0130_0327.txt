Family and friends today attended the funeral for Matthew shepard 
in casper, Wyoming. The 21-year-old student died Monday, five days 
after he was pistol whipped and tied to a fence. Police say robbery 
was the primary motive, but shepard also apparently was singled out 
because he was gay. Two men have been charged with murder. Some anti-gay 
protesters gathered near the church Friday, despite a city council 
ban on picketing. Shepard's family is thanking the public for its 
support. On behalf of our son Matthew shepard, we want to thank the 
citizens of the United States and the people of the world who have 
expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to our family during 
these trying times. A person as caring and loving as our son Matt 
would be overwhelmed by what this incident has done to the hearts 
and souls of people around the world. In the wake of shepard's death, 
a number of political leaders have called on Congress to pass hate 
crime legislation that protects gays and lesbians.
