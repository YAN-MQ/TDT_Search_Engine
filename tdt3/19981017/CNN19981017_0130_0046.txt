"Headline News." I'm David Goodnow. Thank you for joining us. congress 
has delayed until Tuesday a vote on the fiscal 1999 budget. But the 
grappling goes on. Republicans and democrats both are lamenting pet 
programs that didn't make it into the $500 billion plan. Yet both 
sides are doing a victory lap for those that did. The plan includes 
more than a billion dollars to hire one-hundred thousand new teachers. 
President Clinton and lawmakers say they're proud of that. Yesterday, 
our administration and the democrats in Congress reached agreement 
with the republican leadership on a fiscally responsible balanced 
budget that seizes this moment of prosperity and wisely invests it 
in the future. By standing together we were able to achieve historic 
victories for the american people. We are all proud of what we were 
able to do by way of getting more resources to the local school districts. 
To have under their control and their authority to hire those teachers 
they need and especially the special emphasis that we built into that 
so that we would have the flexibility to hire special education teachers. 
You know, this is a group of young people that really deserve the 
attention we can give them. So, yes that was important to us.
