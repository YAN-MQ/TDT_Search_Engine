There were silent tears when friends rose to read homespun recollections 
of the sweetness and merriment of three children who had died. There 
were sniffles and whispered prayers when the minister exhorted the 
mourners to have faith in God. But when six burly men in tuxedos and 
white gloves solemnly pushed carts carrying the small white coffins 
up the carpeted aisle of the Greenwood Baptist Church in Brooklyn 
on Saturday, people began to wail and sob, filling the vaulted room 
with the echoes of pain. The deaths two weeks ago of Damilola, Olusegun 
and Akintunde Morak _ ages 7, 5 and 3, respectively _ touched a broad 
circle that extended beyond the Nigerian immigrant neighborhood on 
Coney Island where the siblings lived. ``They are three little angels,'' 
said Arait Bakare, a family friend. ``These children _ sinless, harmless, 
loving children _ are in the hands of Jesus,'' said Pastor Emmanuel 
Omotoso of the Deeper Life Bible Church in the Bronx. Angela Igwe, 
the children's mother, is the pastor's goddaughter. The Morak children 
died when a private ambulance sped through a red light and into their 
mother's car at an intersection in Brooklyn late on Oct. 1. Ms. Igwe 
crawled from her crumpled car, screaming and pleading for help as 
her children were dying. She remains in Kings County Hospital recovering 
from her injuries. Friends said she came for a brief time to the wake 
for the children on Friday before returning to her hospital bed. Her 
only surviving child, 9-year-old Ibornka, was also hurt in the crash. 
Looking dazed and frightened and wearing a neck brace, the skinny 
little girl attended the funeral of her brothers and sister at the 
side of her father, Timmy Morak. Morak, a nursing home attendant who 
lived apart from his family, kept Ibornka tightly clasped to his side 
throughout the service. The ambulance driver, Anne Lamberson, was 
arrested at the scene. On Friday, she was charged with 11 counts of 
manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, assault and reckless 
endangerment. Despite the circumstances, the message of the funeral 
service was not anger, but acceptance. A friend read a letter from 
Ms. Igwe about her struggle to find peace by adopting the best qualities 
of each of her children into herself _ Damilola's humor, Olusegun's 
thoughtfulness, Akintunde's quiet pride. ``In this way, their little 
hearts will go on through mine,'' the mother wrote. Ms. Igwe, in her 
written reflections, revealed that she has a heart-shaped tattoo on 
her back with the names and birth dates of each of her children inside. 
``They would always ask me, `Mummy, how come you have our names on 
your back?' I would answer, `Because you are all special and I love 
you very much and there is no other way I know to express how I feel 
about you to the world,''' she wrote. Ms. Igwe's co-workers eulogized 
the children, who had spent their last day playing in the beauty salon 
where their mother works. ``Little cherubs,'' one woman called them, 
``spreading love.'' ``I can't even imagine what the pain must be like,'' 
said Margaret Jones, one of Ms. Igwe's friends from the salon. ``She'll 
get through it with prayer, a lot of prayer. But she's very, very 
strong and she'll get through it.'' The Morak family has received 
an outpouring of financial support. Four white stretch limousines 
were on hand to ferry the immediate family. The children's coffins 
were heaped with elaborate flower arrangements. ``A whole lot of people 
helped us with all this _ the general public, the schools, the funeral 
home,'' said Ms. Bakare, the family friend who acted as spokeswoman 
and handled the logistics of keeping track of the crowds of reporters, 
police officers and funeral home workers outside the church. The service 
also drew several elected officials. ``It's three of our kids,'' said 
Adele Cohen, the state Assemblywoman who represents Ms. Igwe's neighborhood. 
``I just hope from this tragedy we can turn it around and get something 
good.'' In announcing the indictment of the ambulance driver on Friday, 
Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said an investigation indicated 
that she did not follow state laws regarding emergency vehicles, which 
allow drivers to go through red lights and stop signs but only after 
first slowing down to insure the safety of other cars and pedestrians. 
Ms. Lamberson, an employee of Transcare Ambulance, had been dispatched 
to Midwood about an hour before the fatal crash. During that interval, 
investigators said, witnesses reported seeing the ambulance traveling 
at more than 50 mph in residential areas, going against traffic and 
making what the district attorney called ``unsafe U-turns.''
