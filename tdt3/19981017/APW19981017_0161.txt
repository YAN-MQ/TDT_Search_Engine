Japan's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura focused on a World War II 
peace treaty with Russia during talks in Moscow on Saturday, a document 
the two countries never signed because of a territorial dispute. Komura 
met Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and later Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov. Talks were also scheduled with First Deputy Premier Yuri 
Maslyukov, in charge of economic ties with Japan, and Moscow Mayor 
Yuri Luzhkov, a likely candidate in Russia's next presidential elections. 
The peace treaty hinges on solving a dispute over the Kuril Islands, 
seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off Russia's Pacific 
coast. President Boris Yeltsin has promised a treaty will be signed 
by 2000. At the start of his meeting with Komura, Primakov said Russia 
``will stand firm by the positions laid out by Yeltsin and ex-Japanese 
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,'' the Interfax news agency reported. 
Diplomatic efforts in preparation for Komura's visit ``will allow 
us to come closer to a peace treaty,'' Primakov said. There have been 
no signs of progress on resolving the Kurils disagreement, despite 
an overall improvement in relations. Moscow insists a decision on 
the Kurils must not threaten its national interests. Japan has been 
cautious about investment and economic cooperation with Russia _ key 
areas that Komura's talks Saturday were expected to discuss _ because 
of lack of movement in the dispute. Still, in an interview published 
Friday, Komura said Russian-Japanese relations have warmed because 
of summits between Yeltsin and Hashimoto. ``In Russian-Japanese relations 
... there has been a continuous dialogue on a high level,'' Komura 
told the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Komura arrived in Russia on Friday 
night, and leaves Saturday.
