A mob of 2,000 villagers beat to death four bandits who attacked their 
village Saturday, police said. Four other bandits were seriously wounded. 
Police said the robbers, led by a retired army major, attacked Bankhali 
village and fired wildly into the air to frighten the villagers into 
submission. But the villagers waited until the attackers were out 
of ammunition and then descended on them and punched and kicked them. 
Four bandits, among them the former major, died on the spot, and four 
others were seriously wounded, police said. The village is 215 kilometers 
(135 miles) southeast of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka.
