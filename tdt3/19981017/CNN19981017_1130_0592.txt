It was a real-life cliffhanger in Santa Clarita, California. Rescuers 
took several hours last night to save a rock climber who was caught 
on a ledge on vasquez rocks. A rescuer with lights on his helmet had 
to repel down to reach him. The man was not injured. Vasquez rocks 
is often used in movies and TV shows because of its rugged landscape.
