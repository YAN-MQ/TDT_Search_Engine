The government is setting up a new FBI office to help local authorities 
respond to chemical, biological or nuclear terrorist attacks on American 
soil. On Friday, attorney general Janet Reno announced the creation 
of the national domestic preparedness office. It will offer police 
officers and firefighters one-stop shopping for federal training and 
equipment to respond to attacks. When a terrorist act strikes the 
streets or rural areas of America, the first few minutes are very 
critical. The first people on the scene are often local rescue squads, 
firefighters and police. They are on the front line. The situation 
is often chaotic and dangerous. For many victims, what these first 
responders do in those first few minutes can mean the difference between 
life and death. The department of defense, department of energy and 
public health service also will take part in the program.
