There's a budget deal in Washington, but Congress won't vote on it 
until tuesday. For now it has approved a fifth short-term spending 
measure to keep the government running. Officials say it will be a 
major project to print the legislation over the weekend and members 
of Congress will need time to read it before they vote. Leaders from 
both parties are claiming victory for the final deal.
