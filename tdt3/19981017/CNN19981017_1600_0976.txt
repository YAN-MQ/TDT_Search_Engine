A surprise move by the fed set off a chain reaction on Wall Street 
this week. David Daniel has a wrap-up of the week in business. Somewhat 
unexpected, but very welcome on Wall Street. Federal reserve chairman 
Alan Greenspan ordered surprise quarter-point cuts in two key interest 
rates Thursday. It was the fed's second such move in less than a month, 
and the first time it's changed rates between scheduled meetings in 
4 1/2 years. The rate cuts made a good week on Wall Street even better. 
The Dow gained some 515 points for the week, 330 points on Thursday 
alone and ended four out of five sessions on the plus side.
