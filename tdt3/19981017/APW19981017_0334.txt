An energy company linked to a massive corruption probe should be forced 
to choose between using the money it's stashed abroad to pay tax debts 
or be bankrupted, a top tax official said, according to a news report 
Saturday. The Unified Energy System company does not have enough money 
in its accounts in Ukraine to pay the debts after losing a court case 
to tax authorities, the Interfax news agency quoted Vadym Kopylov, 
the deputy chief of the State Tax Service, as saying. Tax officials 
recently fined the private gas and energy trader 1.4 billion hryvna 
(currently dlrs 409 million) for evading tax payments and illegally 
transferring abroad dlrs 690 million received from gas sales. UES 
lost an appeal Thursday in the Supreme Arbitration Court. Tax officials 
have told Ukrainian media that in 1997, UES paid a meager 11.1 million 
hryvna (dlrs 5.5 million at the time) in taxes, while its net profits 
amounted to 148 million hryvna (dlrs 74 million) and total turnover 
stood at 4.1 billion hryvna (dlrs 2 billion). The company is linked 
to a corruption investigation against former Prime Minister Pavlo 
Lazarenko, who now leads the centrist opposition Hromada movement 
in parliament. Lazarenko's critics accuse him of abusing his authority 
for personal gain when he was premier in 1996-97, in particular of 
reaping huge profits from gas imports to Ukraine by giving UES preferential 
status in the national gas market during his term in office. Last 
month, authorities charged a prominent Hromada activist and a former 
senior government official, Mykola Syvulskiy, with abusing his position 
and embezzlement connected with gas imports. These charges carry a 
prison term of up to five years. Syvulskiy is suspected of transferring 
more than dlrs 5 million from the accounts of state gas company Ukrgazprom 
to UES. Hromada leaders have protested against the investigation, 
saying the case was politically motivated and organized by President 
Leonid Kuchma and his close supporters. But Ukraine's prosecutor general 
Mykhailo Potebenko has dismissed any suggestions of politics in the 
case and vowed to complete his investigation. Last week, he said investigators 
may complete the probe against Lazarenko within three months and ask 
parliament to revoke his immunity from prosecution if some necessary 
information arrives from abroad.
