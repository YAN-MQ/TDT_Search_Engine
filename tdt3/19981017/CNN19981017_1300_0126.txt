There's a budget deal in Washington, but Congress won't vote on it 
until tuesday. For now, it has approved a fifth, short-term spending 
measure to keep the government running. Officials say it will be a 
major project to print the legislation over the weekend and members 
of Congress will need time to read it before they vote.
