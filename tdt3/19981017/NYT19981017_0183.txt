For just an hour Saturday, Sammy Sosa the baseball star took a back 
seat to Sammy Sosa the humanitarian, as Gov. George Pataki and Jackie 
Robinson's widow, Rachel, saluted him as the first recipient of the 
Jackie Robinson Empire State Freedom Medal. The bronze medal was given 
to Sosa, the Dominican-born slugger for the Chicago Cubs, in a ceremony 
at St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center in Manhattan in recognition 
of his efforts to aid the victims of Hurricane Georges. Later, Sosa 
attended a parade in his honor up the Canyon of Heroes along lower 
Broadway. ``What Sammy represents that Jack also represented is someone 
who is concerned and committed to change,'' Mrs. Robinson said. ``A 
person who does everything he does with humility. He sets a very high 
standard for this award.'' Mrs. Robinson and Pataki established the 
Jackie Robinson award in 1997 at the National Baseball Hall of Fame 
in Cooperstown, N.Y. It is to be awarded annually. The soft-spoken, 
seemingly camera-shy Sosa appeared overwhelmed by the honor. ``Every 
day,'' he said, ``I say to myself, `Thank you, God, for giving me 
so much opportunity to give back to not only my people and my country 
but to the American people.' It's been unbelievable.'' Sosa said he 
planned to return to the Dominican Republic early next week to see 
for himself what Hurricane Georges did to his country. Through the 
Sammy Sosa Relief Fund, he said he intends to build a school and hospital 
near his hometown of San Pedro de Macoris. In a surprise gesture, 
Sosa gave Pataki the bat he used to hit his 59th home run. Sosa hit 
66 home runs this year; only Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals, 
who hit 70, has hit more in a single season. Sosa and McGwire broke 
Roger Maris' longstanding record of 61. ``I wanted to give you the 
No. 62,'' Sosa told the governor, ``but I can't because it is in the 
Hall of Fame.'' Even as some of Sosa's entourage reminded him that 
he was running late for an appearance at a hospital in the Bronx, 
he still made time to visit some patients at St. Clare's. His visit 
to the hospital was arranged by Ramon Tallaj, a childhood friend who 
is a doctor there. Sosa also signed a few autographs. Nine-year-old 
Matthew Doherty was among the lucky few to get one, one of only a 
half-dozen children allowed into St. Clare's crammed lobby. Dozens 
of people thronged the hospital's entrance. Matthew persuaded his 
mom to let him skip his usual Saturday morning soccer practice, just 
for a chance to see Sosa up close and to ask him to sign a baseball 
that had already been autographed by Mrs. Robinson. ``This is historic,'' 
Matthew said, holding up his new treasure. ``I probably have the only 
baseball in America signed by Sammy and Rachel Robinson.''
