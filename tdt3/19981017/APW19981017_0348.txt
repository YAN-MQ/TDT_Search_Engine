Germany's newly elected Social Democrats and Greens shelved plans 
for speed limits on the autobahn while continuing to haggle over energy 
taxes in coalition talks Saturday. Greens had been seeking a 100 kph 
(60 mph) speed limit on Germany's famously unrestricted superhighways, 
but the coalition deal says only that municipalities will be granted 
more leeway to reduce speeds on city streets. Both sides, however, 
said the issue of autobahn speed limits was not dead. ``I'm optimistic 
that we're going to have a European solution,'' Greens leader Gunda 
Roestel said, referring to proposals for eventual common traffic rules 
throughout the European Union. In a partial win for the ecology-minded 
Greens, the partners also cast serious doubt on whether a proposed 
magnetic-levitation train line between Hamburg and Berlin will ever 
be built. While agreeing to honor contracts already signed, they said 
the federal government would not pay for any cost overruns. The train's 
backers admitted Thursday that the stretch would probably cost up 
to 2.8 billion marks (dlrs 1.75 billion) more than the 6.1 billion 
marks (dlrs 3.8 billion) originally planned. The Greens oppose the 
Transrapid project as wasteful and potentially dangerous to the environment 
and animal life. ``Transrapid is not over,'' said Franz Muentefering, 
a Social Democrat proposed as the next transportation minister. ``But 
financing for Hamburg-Berlin looks difficult.'' If the private partners 
don't cover the extra costs, then the government will look for another, 
cheaper site to build the high-tech train, he said. Party leaders 
then went back into closed talks over energy taxes _ the area that 
seems to be the most difficult for the likely partners to reach agreement 
on. Both parties in the center-left grouping want to use the proceeds 
from higher taxes on gasoline and other fossil fuels to finance cuts 
in other levies aimed at bringing down non-wage labor costs. That, 
they hope, will spur job creation _ top of their wish list. The Greens 
wanted a big jump in gas prices to discourage Germans drivers from 
taking their cars out and polluting the air. But Chancellor-elect 
Gerhard Schroeder, wary of hurting the auto industry, has said he 
would not accept more than a 6 pfennig (4 cent) a liter increase, 
far less than the Greens were seeking. Since that wouldn't raise nearly 
enough to make a significant dent in the other taxes they want to 
cut, Greens leader Kerstin Mueller said Friday it was up to the Social 
Democrats ``to come and make new proposals.'' Higher taxes on heating 
oil, electricity and other energy sources were still being considered. 
Also on the table for Saturday were social welfare policies and how 
to pay for them. Schroeder promised before winning the Sept. 27 election, 
that he would rescind planned cuts in social security that were passed 
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition. The Social Democrats 
and Greens also want to boost aid for the elderly and long-time unemployed. 
But financing on that must also be hammered out.
