An interest rate cut triggered a 1,000-point rally in the Dow. Rhonda 
schaffler has the week on Wall Street. Blue chip stocks built on Thursday's 
surge to cap the Dow industrials' best weekly point gain ever. Investors 
seeing the bright side of Thursday's interest rate cut, shrugged off 
the notion that the fed's sneak attack was driven by some deeper concern 
for the U.S. financial system. The mood has shifted in our opinion 
to the glass is half full. You can come up with doubts on why the 
fed did what they did. Obviously the market is saying they did it 
for the right reasons, that there's no subterfuge, that the fed isn't 
aware of something they're keeping from us. Either way, the market 
is saying we're going to look beyond the valley of the current problems 
to the peaks ahead. The broad-based rally lifted economically sensitive 
stocks. Dupont and united technologies both up more than $3. Goodyear, 
3m and Alcoa aluminum gained more than two. Airline stocks also rallied 
on easing recession fears, propelling the Dow transportation index 
to a gain of more than 14% on the week. The NASDAQ composite had its 
best weekly gain ever, up nearly 9%, despite friday's lackluster performances 
from hi-tech blue chips -- Microsoft, dell, Intel and Yahoo. But the 
market's strong performance has not convinced everyone on Wall Street. 
The fed's action yesterday, and probably further fed action will preclude 
a Recession here, but you certainly can't rule it out, given the over 
capacity we have throughout the globe in many industries, and the 
slowdown we're likely to see in the global economy. Alan Greenspan 
was the driving force behind Thursday's rate cut, consulting fellow 
fed governors by phone, but in essence, calling this one on his own. 
Greenspan and the rest of the federal open market committee are scheduled 
to meet again on November 17th, another rate cut then would not be 
surprise. Rhonda schaffler, "CNN Financial News," New York.
