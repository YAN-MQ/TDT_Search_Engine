President Clinton heads to Maryland today to try to jump-start the 
mideast summit. Mr. Clinton opened the summit on Thursday. He's trying 
to help Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and palestinian 
authority President Yasser Arafat reach an agreement by tomorrow. 
Reports say, so far, little progress has been made. Negotiators are 
discussing a U.S. plan under which the Palestinians would crack down 
harder on anti-Israeli terrorism. In turn, Israel would pull its troops 
from an additional 13% of the West Bank. Israel controls the routes 
to many Palestinian-controlled areas which, experts say, has been 
a problem for autonomy-minded Palestinians. Since today is the Jewish 
sabbath, today's negotiation sessions in Maryland are being billed 
as informal.
