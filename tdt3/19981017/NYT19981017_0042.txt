State officials, saying they are intensifying efforts to crack down 
on ticket scalping as the World Series gets under way, filed suit 
Friday against two brokers for selling tickets to the playoff games 
between the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians at about twice their 
face value. And in another move to counter scalpers, the city's Department 
of Consumer Affairs said Friday that it had impounded a car belonging 
to another broker after the driver offered an undercover agent two 
$60 tickets to Game 6 of the playoffs for $275. During the past two 
weeks, New York City Police patrolling outside the stadium have arrested 
242 people for buying or selling tickets at inflated prices, said 
Inspector Edward Delatorre. Three were arrested on Thursday after 
they waited 30 hours to buy World Series tickets and then tried to 
resell them to undercover officers, he said. New York state law prohibits 
the resale of tickets to entertainment and sports events for more 
than face value plus 10 percent of that price, or $5, whichever is 
greater. The resale of tickets is also banned within 1,000 feet of 
Yankee Stadium. Inspector Delatorre said many sellers are skirting 
that restriction by walking as far as 10 blocks from the ballfield 
to make their sales. In the lawsuits filed Friday, the state attorney 
general's office is seeking to force two companies, 2 on the Aisle, 
of Manhattan, and Rave Reviews, of Easton, Pa., to refund the amount 
their customers were overcharged. But David Corvette, a spokesman 
for Attorney General Dennis Vacco, said that investigators did not 
know how many scalped tickets the companies had sold. Howard Silver, 
the president of 2 on the Aisle, who was named in the lawsuit, declined 
to comment. At Rave Reviews, an executive who would not identify himself 
said, ``It's old news.'' He would not comment further. The car impounded 
by the city belongs to a third company, All Events Tickets, of Briarwood, 
Queens, that was sued by the state in July. A default judgment was 
entered against All Events after it failed to respond to the attorney 
general's suit, Corvette said. Company officials could not be reached. 
New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner Jules Polonetsky, said 
that the car, a 1991 Ford Probe, would not be returned until the company 
paid a $41,000 fine for operating without a license. Scalping is a 
largely mobile business that could be crippled without access to a 
car, he said. Polonetsky said he was also trying to find seven ticket 
brokers who are charging up to $2,500 for World Series tickets. Subpoenas 
have been issued to get the addresses from telephone companies, he 
said, since newspaper ads for the brokers list 800 numbers but no 
addresses. ``They've gotten a bit smarter,'' Polonetsky said. ``They 
used to advertise using their names.'' He said many companies are 
moving to New Jersey to escape New York City's licensing regulations. 
Responding to repeated questions at a news conference Friday, Vacco 
said there was no evidence that employees of the Yankee Stadium box 
office were involved in ticket scalping. But Corvette said that his 
office had requested information from the stadium regarding box office 
sales and personnel. The stadium was cooperating, he said. ``At this 
time, we have absolutely no indication that there's any wrongdoing 
occurring at the Yankee Stadium box office,'' Corvette said. ``However, 
based on our extensive investigations of ticket fraud in general, 
we have learned that every ticket to every event originates in a box 
office.'' Stadium officials did not respond to a request for comment.
