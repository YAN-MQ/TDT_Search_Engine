The future of baseball could soon be changing. Tony Guida has details 
in today's "tech trends." If Mark McGwire can hit 70 home runs with 
his low tech wood bat, how many do you suppose he could hit with this? 
This is definitely not low tech. This is a fearsome cylinder. It creates 
a dramatic trampoline effect when bat meets ball. Though he will never 
use this aluminum weapon, only wood bats are bermt notice the major 
leagues, this may be where baseball bats are going. High school and 
college ball players are always looking for the next development in 
bats partly because they always want to lit the ball a Little farther 
and partly because wooden bats break so aluminum is cheaper. Not only 
is the aluminum durable but it does enhance the performance of the 
individuals and that's what most players and most teams are looking 
for. Louisville slugger is the big eflt name in baseball bats an it 
want tosz stay in first place. As it does, it keeps one eye on the 
NCAA which next summer will insist on performance limits in baseball 
bats. Hill Rick and bradsby is keeping its eye on the competition. 
Other companies were very busy themselves in trying to produce the 
next fad in baseball bats. As good a name as this is, if someone else 
has a product that outperforms it, the players will move very rapidly. 
It's an industry that if you're six months behind in technology, you 
can lose a whole year's worth of business. It's that competitive. 
But while future Mark McGwire may be hangering for the latest juiced 
up bat, you're not going to see the real McGwire swing one any time 
soon. When it comes to lumber, low tech still rules the show.
