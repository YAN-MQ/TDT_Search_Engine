A woman who had hitched a ride on a small plane was killed when it 
crashed near a schoolhouse in a remote village in the southern Philippines 
early Saturday, police said. The three others on the plane, including 
the pilot of the single-engine Beechcraft, were injured, said Iligan 
police chief Isnaji Bantala. The airplane crashed close to the schoolhouse 
in the village of Lilangan northeast of Iligan City around 6 a.m. 
(2200 GMT Friday). Local authorities said it was cloud-covered, raining 
and windy. The pilot of the plane, owned by Matling Industrial and 
Commercial Corp., had attempted to contact the control tower at nearby 
Cagayan de Oro airport but was unable to do so, said Antonio Babijes, 
chief of the Manila Rescue Coordinating Center. A passing Philippine 
Airlines plane received the radio message and informed airport authorities 
in Cagayan de Oro that the pilot reported his plane was going down, 
Babijes said. Melquiades Loyola, one of the injured passengers and 
an administrative assistant of the company, said in a television interview 
that the engine suddenly quit. He said the pilot then looked for a 
place to land that was close to a community ``for the possibility 
of recovering our bodies.'' ``We had no alternative but to crashland,'' 
Loyola said as he was being treated at a hospital in Cagayan de Oro. 
An officer of the company said the woman who died, Tessie Prospero, 
was the wife of Matling's cashier. Prospero and her daughter, Daisy 
May, who was injured, had hitched a ride on the plane from Cagayan 
de Oro to visit her husband in Malabang, where the company is based. 
Malabang, a town in Lanao del Sur province, is south of Iligan, about 
700 kilometers (440 miles) south of Manila.
