CNN has learned that lawyers for Paula Jones are preparing a settlement 
offer that asks for a $2 million payout. The settlement will ask for 
$1 million from President Clinton's camp and another $1 million from 
wealthy New Yorker abe hirschfeld. Hirschfeld has previously offered 
$1 million for Jones to settle the suit. This settlement offer has 
not yet been made to President Clinton's attorneys, reportedly because 
lawyers for Jones are arguing over their fees.
