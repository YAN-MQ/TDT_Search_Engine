Thousands of rioters shut down a large area of the nation's capital, 
setting cars on fire and forcing shops to close to protest the shooting 
earlier Saturday of a militant Sunni Muslim leader. Gunmen in a car 
shot Maulana Mohammed Abdullah as he stepped from the mosque in Apara 
district of Islamabad after saying his afternoon prayers. His death 
sparked demonstrations and cries for revenge by his followers. Police 
surrounded the area as mourners brought Abdullah's body to the street 
where thousands of people said funeral prayers. Men and boys clung 
to the sides and roofs of buses to follow his body as supporters took 
it to a graveyard. Abdullah belonged to the militant Sipah-e-Sahaba 
or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet, an extremist group that 
reviles Shiite Muslims as non-Muslims. No one has taken responsibility 
for the killing but police fear it may have been rival Shiite Muslims. 
Abdullah's group, Sipah-e-Sahaba often clashes with militant Shiite 
groups. ``His death is a tremendous loss. . . he was shot in the back,'' 
said Tahiri Hussain Ali Tohidi, a cleric who helped to lead the funeral 
prayers. A police official said hundreds of rioters burned two government 
vehicles and an oil tanker after the shooting. Witnesses said all 
shops in the Apara neighborhood were shuttered and that the entire 
area was in darkness. Last month, four leaders of Sipah-e-Sahaba were 
shot and killed in another hit-and-run attack in Islamabad. Hundreds 
of people have been killed in recent years in conflict between Sunni 
and Shiite groups. Sunni groups accuse neighboring Iran of helping 
the Shiite extremists, while Shiite groups say Saudi Arabia is funding 
the Sunni militant organizations. Both countries deny the charges. 
Shiite Muslims comprise 15 percent of Sunni-dominated Pakistan.
