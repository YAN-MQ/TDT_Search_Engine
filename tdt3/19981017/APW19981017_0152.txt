Scores of policemen cordoned off a commercial district in the Pakistani 
capital Saturday after gunmen shot and killed a leader of a Sunni 
Muslim militant organization, police said. Maulana Mohammad Abdullah 
was shot four times by gunmen in a car outside a mosque in Islamabad. 
Abdullah, a leader of militant Sunni group, Sipah-e-Sahaba or the 
Guardians of the Friends of Prophet, died in hospital and police say 
they fear retaliatory attacks. Dozens of supporters vowing revenge 
protested the killing. The group clashes regularly with militant Shiite 
Muslims. Traffic in the Apara neighborhood was diverted by police 
in riot gear, said eyewitnesses. Last month, four leaders of Sipah-e-Sahaba 
were shot and killed in another hit-and-run attack in Islamabad. Since 
those killings the clashes between rival Sunni and Shiite Muslims 
has intensified. Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years 
in bloody conflict between Sunni and Shiite groups. Shiite Muslims 
comprise barely 15 percent of Sunni-dominated Pakistan.
