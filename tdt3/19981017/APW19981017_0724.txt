A surge in the mosquito population has closed one school and prompted 
the government to warn of a possible outbreak of dengue fever, though 
no cases have been reported yet. ``Residents should take the necessary 
preventative measures to protect themselves and their families,'' 
said Dr. Noel Carr, director of the government-run health clinic in 
Frederiksted. An outbreak of dengue fever, which is caused by a virus 
carried by mosquitoes, often follows a surge in the population of 
the insects. The mosquito population has increased since Hurricane 
Georges passed over the islands on Sept. 21. Rainfall that leaves 
puddles provides a breeding place for mosquitoes. The government has 
begun spraying pesticides on St. Thomas and St. John but will spray 
on St. Croix only when requested by residents, said the territory's 
environmental health director, Laura Hassell. ``Certain people complained 
that the chemical was killing their dogs, was killing their fish, 
is giving them rashes,'' Hassell said. She discounted those claims 
and said the pesticide used, Ultra Low Dose DP-100, is safe. But because 
of the complaints, St. Croix residents must sign a waiver before pesticides 
are sprayed near their homes. Officials were forced to close one school 
in St. Thomas when teachers walked off the job, saying the mosquitoes 
made the building unbearable.
