In a legal battle over book selling, Wal-Mart is suing Amazon.com, 
the company that sells books on the Internet. Wal-Mart accuses Amazon 
of recruiting former employees and targeting vendors to try to learn 
more about its records on sales, inventory and customer buying habits. 
Wal-Mart is asking for a court order to prevent Amazon from duplicating 
any of its technology. An Amazon spokesman says his company is not 
interested in getting trade secrets.
