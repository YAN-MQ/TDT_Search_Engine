The status Saturday of promises that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
must back up with evidence of compliance by NATO's deadline _ pushed 
back to Oct. 27 _ or face renewed threat of airstrikes for his crackdown 
in Kosovo: _ Immediately halt all hostilities in Kosovo: Both sides 
reported shooting incidents Saturday, and Serb police claimed ethnic 
Albanian rebels had attacked them more than a dozen times across Kosovo 
in an effort to provoke them and draw NATO airstrikes. Reporters saw 
the bodies of three police killed in what the Serbs said was a KLA 
grenade attack southwest of Pristina. _ Withdraw forces and heavy 
armaments to levels before the crackdown began Feb. 28: NATO spy planes 
began flying over Kosovo on Saturday to check on the status of pullouts. 
On Friday, despite withdrawals, NATO said more Serb troops and police 
remain in the province than are permitted. _ Start serious talks with 
ethnic Albanians on self-rule: No date for the start of talks has 
been announced. The two sides have been holding separate discussions 
with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill. Ethnic Albanian political leaders 
reportedly met Saturday in Turkey to discuss taking a united stand 
on independence or autonomy. _ Help refugees return to their homes: 
Some refugees have begun moving back to their villages but many remain 
wary of Serb police forces, some of whom were accused in massacres 
of civilians. _ Allowing unhindered work by humanitarian organizations: 
The U.N. refugee agency and others have resumed aid convoys for the 
past several days, and some workers say Serb police have been less 
obstructive. _ Cooperating with the International War Crimes Tribunal: 
U.N. war crimes investigators have received Yugoslav visas and plan 
to return to Kosovo soon. _ Allowing a 2,000-member international 
verification force into Kosovo to verify that Yugoslavia is keeping 
its word: First members of an advance team for the monitors, to be 
overseen by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
arrived in Kosovo. OSCE said it hoped a sizable number of monitors 
would be in place in Kosovo in two weeks.
