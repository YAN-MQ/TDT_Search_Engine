Federal and Puerto Rican officials have announced a massive rebuilding 
program for parts of Puerto Rico damaged by hurricane georges. The 
five-year, $1.2 billion plan will restore or rebuild 50,000 houses 
damaged by the storm, which rampaged through the Caribbean last month, 
before hitting the gulf coast of the United States. The White House 
also plans to convene a task force to supervise the rebuilding, only 
the third time that's ever been done.
