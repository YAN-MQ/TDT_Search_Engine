A final settlement to a border dispute that has plagued Peru and Ecuador 
for half a century could be announced next week, Brazilian President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Saturday. Peru and Ecuador have agreed 
in advance to accept any settlement proposed by the four guarantor 
nations of a 1942 treaty that ended the War of the Pacific between 
the two countries. A dispute over a small section of their Amazon 
jungle border has erupted in war twice since then, most recently in 
1995. Tensions flared again in August when Peru accused 300 Ecuadorian 
troops of entering its territory. Cardoso said the guarantor nations 
_ Brazil, Chile, Argentina and the United States _ were putting the 
finishing touches on their proposed settlement while preparing for 
an Ibero-American summit Sunday in this northern Portuguese port. 
Presidents from the three Latin American countries met here Saturday 
with Presidents Jamil Mahaud of Ecuador and Alberto Fujimori of Peru, 
who confirmed that their legislatures had approved accepting an imposed 
solution. ``We have ordered the negotiators to work quickly, and I 
estimate a proposal ought to be placed on the table by next week,'' 
Cardoso said. He said the proposal would respect the national sovereignty 
of each nation and will provide ``what we all desire, which is peace.'' 
A quick solution was anticipated when the Peru and Ecuador legislatures 
approved proposals Friday from their respective presidents to accept 
any plan drawn up by the guarantor nations. Analysts estimate there 
are 100,000 land mines still in the disputed area. Fujimori and Mahaud 
met with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington earlier this month 
and got his promise to help solve the dispute. They told him they 
had made substantial progress toward completing a peace agreement 
but remained at odds over delineating the actual border area. The 
border region, in the Cordillera del Condor mountains in the highlands 
of the Amazon jungle, is potentially rich in petroleum and minerals. 
The conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a war along 
the Pacific at a time when their jungle border was undefined. After 
Peru won in 1942, the two sides established a 1,088-mile (1,751-kilometer) 
border. But with only 49 miles (79 kilometers) of border left to mark, 
Ecuador stopped the process, declaring the agreement only partially 
applied. Peru and Ecuador fought a short war in 1981 and again in 
1995 over the area.
