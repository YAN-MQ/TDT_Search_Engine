The business of sports, now, and the labor disputes which seem to 
be part of the game these days. Money might just do to the NBA what 
it did to baseball. Here is NBC's Stan Bernard. There was a parade 
today in New York to honor Sammy Sosa, on the opening day of the world 
series. Sosa, Mark McGwire and scores of other millionaire athletes 
are heroes again. Baseball has made a big comeback from 1994, the 
year of the strike. A bunch of billionaires fighting with a bunch 
of millionaires. And it's happening again -- the national basketball 
association is going through a replay of that self-destruction. The 
first two weeks of the season, 99 games, have been called off over 
a Contract dispute. The players are working out in gyms to stay in 
shape. In the NBA, the average salary is $2.6 million. The average 
baseball salary is $1.4 million. The average hockey salary is $1.2 
million. And ticket prices have gone up. A world series ticket is 
up to $150. A courtside seat for the NBA championship in Chicago was 
$475. Despite the huge contracts in the NBA, the players want a bigger 
piece of total league revenue. Some say they want nearly 60%. Players 
realize this is a problem. I can't expect the average fan, who is 
already paying $50, $75 for a ticket to a Bulls game, to feel any 
sympathy at all towards us. The average fan does get lost and disenchanted 
with the shuffle of big numbers. I think the owners are greedy, I 
think everybody's greedy. And while television is offering 2,000 hours 
of sports this year, unhappy fans are tuning out. I feel like turning 
in my cable right now,. I want to just cancel my subscription, because 
basketball's all I got it for. Like it was with baseball, the NBA 
owners and players are betting big bucks the fans disgust will only 
be temporary. Stan Bernard, NBC news, New York.
