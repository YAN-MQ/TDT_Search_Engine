Hoping secrecy will promote compromise, President Clinton has imposed 
a Virtual news blackout on the mideast summit in Maryland. The word 
is the talks are moving very slowly. Mr. Clinton returned to the summit 
today. He met with Palestinian authority President Yasser Arafat privately. 
He's expected to do the same with Israeli prime minister Benjamin 
netanyahu. The Israelis agreed to relinquish 13% more of the West 
Bank if Arafat takes major steps to curb terrorism. The associated 
press reports Palestinians are rejecting Israeli demands that terrorism 
suspects be tried in Israel. An analyst says the summit is risky for 
all sides. I think there is a tremendous risk. Not only is there an 
embarrassment to the president, but you have a May 4th deadline for 
interim moves to be concluded, and that would set in train all sorts 
of things. Arafat has said there would be unilateral declaration of 
independence. The Israelis don't want that. Nobody wants May 4th to 
come. This is the primary opportunity, because the president is not 
going to do this two months from now. This is the time to do it. In 
Jerusalem, protesters are calling on Israel to release Palestinian 
prisoners as part of the peace deal being negotiated at the summit.
