Afghanistan's Taliban religious army freed 25 Iranian captives on 
Saturday ``as a gesture of good will,'' Radio Shariat reported. The 
Taliban's radio broadcast, monitored in neighboring Pakistan, said 
the International Red Cross sent an aircraft to the Taliban headquarters 
in southern Kandahar, picked up the freed Iranians and returned them 
to Iran. Twenty-six truck drivers arrived at an airport outside Tehran 
later Saturday on two planes of the International Committee of the 
Red Cross, according to Iran's official news agency. The discrepancy 
in numbers could not be immediately be explained. The Islamic Republic 
News Agency said that with the release of the 26, the Taliban had 
freed a total of 51 Iranians. The Iranians were captured in August 
during the Taliban's bloody takeover of the northern Afghan city of 
Mazar-e-Sharif. Renegade soldiers killed eight Iranian diplomats and 
an Iranian journalist during the fighting. The killings caused a chill 
in relations with neighboring Iran, which massed more than 200,000 
soldiers on its eastern border with Afghanistan and sent hundreds 
of tanks and scores of fighter jets there. The first batch of five 
truck drivers were released days after the Taliban admitted the diplomats' 
killing in early September. The Taliban seized the truck drivers while 
they were carrying ``humanitarian goods'' to northern Afghanistan, 
the Iranian news agency said. It gave no details about the men's health.
