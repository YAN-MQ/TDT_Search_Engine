From London tonight, word that former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet 
is under house arrest and could face murder charges for abuses that 
took place in Chile when he was in power. Our report tonight from 
NBC's donatella lorch. The former Chilean dictator is being held in 
this London clinic where he is recuperating from back surgery. Protesters 
quickly gathered outside chanting at the curtained windows. British 
police took the 82-year-old general into custody last night, acting 
on an extradition warrant from the Spanish government that charged 
Pinochet with the murder of Spanish citizens in Chile. Pinochet's 
son is outraged. And the Chilean government also is upset. The Chilean 
government has presented a formal protest note to the British government 
for what is considered the violation of diplomatic immunity. But among 
human rights groups the news was welcomed. People were killed, people 
disappeared, and to this day, 25 years later, thousands of people 
remain disappeared. For 17 years, Pinochet presided over a military 
dictatorship in chile. He seized power from an elected president in 
1973, declaring himself both president and commander in chief of the 
army. Pinochet tolerated no dissent, banning political parties. It 
is estimated that his army killed 3,000 people. Several hundred of 
these were Spanish citizens. Pinochet left the presidency in 1990, 
but he held on to his powers as army commander and chief until this 
March when he had himself named senator for life, a position which 
gave him immunity from prosecution in Chile. British government officials 
say that Pinochet does not have diplomatic immunity. Now a British 
court must decide whether he will be extradited to Spain. Donatella 
lorch, NBC news, London.
