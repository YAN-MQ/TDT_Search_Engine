Florida neighbors and friends Mark O'Meara and Tiger Wood _ frequent 
practice partners _ will play for real in Sunday's finals of the World 
Match Play Championship. O'Meara thrashed defending champion Vijay 
Singh 11 and 10 in the semifinals Saturday and set a new record for 
the most lopsided win in the 34-year-old tournament. Woods rallied 
from being three holes down after seven to defeat Lee Westwood 5 and 
4 with Woods making a birdie on the 32nd hole close out the 25-year-old 
Englishman. The previous record for the biggest win was set in 1978 
when Tom Watson defeated Dale Hayes 11 and 9. On Friday, Singh was 
11 up after 21 holes against Patrik Sjoland but went on to advance 
7 and 6. It's the first all-U.S. final since 1975 when Hale Irwin 
beat Al Geiberger and only the fourth in the tournament's 34-year 
history with the winner this time getting 170,000 pounds (dlrs 289,000). 
``I made some putts on the second 18 and that made the difference,'' 
Woods said. ``I'm looking forward to playing Mark. It will be fun 
and the crowds won't be as partisan, pro-British, as they have been.'' 
O'Meara, this year's Masters and British Open champion, had nine birdies 
in his first 18 with birdie putts of 36 (12 meters), 18 (6 meters), 
12 (4 meters) and 10 feet (3 meters). He was 11 up after getting a 
par on the 20th and went to 12 up with another par on 21. Singh _ 
this year's U.S. PGA champion _ recovered to only 11 down with a birdie 
on the 22nd, but O'Meara closed out the match when they halved the 
26th with pars. For 26 holes, O'Meara had nine birdies, all in the 
first 18. Singh had trouble with his usually good iron game, and his 
short game and putting wasn't much better. ``It was just one of those 
days when everything went right for Mark O'Meara. To beat Vijay Singh, 
who is a world-class player, 11 and 10. It was definitely my day.'' 
``It was one of those rounds where I was in the zone,'' O'Meara added. 
``Sixty-three with a double-bogey is more than I could ask for.'' 
O'Meara suggested the final would be another friendly match _ this 
time for more money. ``We play a lot together,'' O'Meara said. ``He 
(Woods) has been playing pretty well at home. I think he took 30 bucks 
off me the last time we played.'' ``I'm pretty smart,'' he went on. 
``I'm no idiot. I go to the putting green afterwards and try to go 
nine, double-or-nothing. I can usually win my money back on the putting 
green.'' Woods had to struggle. He was down by three holes after the 
first seven _ due to Westwood's good putting. But he rallied as his 
putting got better _ and Westwood's worsened was one ahead after the 
first 18. He went four up through 28 holes with a string of birdies, 
getting two of them with 8-foot (2.5 meters) putts and one on the 
28th with a 25-footer (8 meters). He pushed the lead to five after 
30 but two-putted from six feet (2 meters) at the 31st for bogey before 
ending the match on the 32nd. In Friday's quarterfinals, Singh defeated 
Patrik Sjoland 7 and 6, O'Meara won over Colin Montgomerie 5 and 4, 
Westwood beat three-time champion Ernie Els 2 and 1, and Woods defeated 
Ian Woosnam 1-up on the 37th hole _ the first of a sudden-death playoff.
