America's social security recipients are facing the lowest cost-of-living 
increase in a dozen years. And the reason is falling prices for gasoline, 
clothing and vegetables. Inflation averaged just 1.4% for the first 
nine months of the year. Next year, social security recipients will 
see just a up 1.3% cost of living adjustment. This translates into 
a $10 a month raise for the average recipient, from $770 to $780.
