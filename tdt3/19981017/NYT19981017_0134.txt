During the Vietnam War and the Watergate crisis, the campus of Yale 
University, like many others, was politically energized, if not radicalized. 
The university chaplain, the Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr., took 
a prominent role in opposing the war, and many undergraduates viewed 
the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon as a triumph over the 
forces of evil. No such passions grip the Yale campus today as President 
Clinton faces an impeachment drama in which a number of Yale alumni 
are playing central roles. ``There is no sense here that we are witnessing 
a great historical moment,'' said Nicole Itano of Boulder, Colo., 
20, managing editor of The Yale Daily News. Glenn Hurowitz, 20, of 
Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., the newspaper's editorials editor, said that 
students were ``tired of this stuff and tired of our leaders doing 
nothing to define the other issues.'' Last month, The Yale Daily News 
urged Clinton to resign ``to put this incredible, indelible blemish 
of American history behind us and restore the assumption of honesty 
and personal integrity in our highest elected official.'' That was 
during the tenure of the class of 1999, now seniors. A new editorial 
board, composed of juniors, takes a different position, arguing against 
what editor in chief Isaiah Wilner, 20, of Seattle, called ``an open-ended 
congressional witch hunt.'' ``The Beltway has escaped from the rest 
of the country,'' Wilner said. ``The Judiciary Committee needs to 
set a time limit and to limit itself to the Starr report issues.'' 
Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were members of the 
class of 1973 at Yale Law School. They had planned to take part in 
a 25th reunion celebration next weekend and attend a luncheon honoring 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who graduated from the law school 
in 1964. But the trip was abruptly canceled last Friday. A White House 
spokesman said the president wanted to be available for Middle East 
peace talks. Clinton's private lawyer in the Lewinsky case, David 
Kendall, and a new White House coordinator of his political defense, 
Gregory Craig, also went to the law school. Brett Kavanaugh, a main 
author of the Starr report, has a bachelor's and a law degree from 
Yale. All that has had little impact on undergraduates' thinking. 
``There was no particular affection on this campus for George Bush, 
who was even more closely identified with Yale, and there is no particular 
disaffection with President Clinton,'' said Dan Sommers, 21, an economics 
and politics major from New York, who nevertheless favors the president's 
resignation. What Clinton did in private is his own business, Sommers 
said, ``but he involved almost everyone in the Cabinet in defending 
his lies, and he has weakened the presidency so much that nothing 
substantive has happened in Washington since January, at a time when 
we badly need strong leadership.'' The impact at the law school has 
been far greater. Yale Law Review editor Laura Ahn declined to discuss 
Clinton's situation, and several professors spoke only on the condition 
of anonymity. ``There is a powerful sense of betrayal,'' a professor 
said. There had been a surge of optimism and hope when the president 
took office, but now he is seen by most people here and elsewhere 
as just another pol.'' Several teachers recalled the traditional cocktail 
party at the law school on the opening day of classes in the fall 
of 1992. ``The first-year students,'' one said, ``knew that Bill Clinton 
had stood where they were standing only 20-odd years before, and they 
were filled with idealism and ambition because he was running for 
president.'' Prof. Akhil Reed Amar said that what he called ``the 
hard-edged view that nothing in the Starr report comes even close 
to an impeachable offense'' made him ``a little nervous'' in view 
of the possibility that Clinton may have committed perjury in grand 
jury testimony. Amar, a law school professor who is considered an 
expert on both the Constitution and criminal procedure, said: ``I 
would argue that even if the charges are true, and he is technically 
impeachable, this would not be a sensible exercise of the awesome, 
disruptive power of impeachment. In this I am affected by the fact 
that the American people twice voted for Bill Clinton knowing to a 
considerable certainty what his character is like.'' His greatest 
fear, Amar continued, is a deeply partisan debate, which would be 
bad, he said, ``for the process and the country.'' Historian John 
Morton Blum, a professor emeritus, was equally critical of Clinton 
and Congress, describing them as ``the worst leadership combination 
this country has had since Calvin Coolidge.'' Clinton, he said, has 
``a lifelong record of dissembling'' and ``lax principles about anything, 
public or private.'' Blum said he opposed resignation because it would 
move the country too close to the British model, where a prime minister 
who loses the confidence of the House of Commons must quit, and he 
opposes impeachment because he does not believe that ``lies told to 
conceal adultery'' are impeachable crimes. But he confessed to seeing 
no way out, because he found ``a crippled presidency, which is the 
third alternative, worse than the others.'' A conversation with a 
group of graduate and undergraduate students at Yale's Timothy Dwight 
College evoked little sense of the moral outrage that dominated college 
campuses on other issues at other times. Lyneise Williams, 33, an 
art history student from Cincinnati, spoke of detecting ``a shifting 
set of values among political activists, a harsh new morality among 
Republicans, journalists and the religious right.'' But a few shreds 
of doubt emerged about the wisdom of Clinton's continuing in office. 
Andrew Gerber, 21, an English major from Bethesda, Md., said that 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's tactics bothered him deeply. But 
he said he could not help wondering, ``What does it say about the 
president's judgment that he would do these things with Monica when 
he was already under suspicion by a lot of people about extramarital 
affairs?'' Alex Kirshner, 21, a history major from Chicago, said he 
thought there was no avoiding a lengthy impeachment proceeding, and 
``that makes you wonder how Clinton can emerge as an effective leader.'' 
Still, only Sommers among the eight in the discussion group said he 
thought Clinton should resign.
