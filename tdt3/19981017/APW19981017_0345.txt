New world No.1 Lindsay Davenport and Venus Williams each won their 
semifinals Saturday, setting up an all-American, power-hitting final 
at the dlrs 1 million European Championships. Davenport left herself 
just one final hurdle to overcome in the defense of her title, after 
brushing aside Romania's Irina Spirlea 6-2, 6-3 in her semifinal. 
Some 24 hours after closing out Mary Pierce's campaign with the fastest 
serve in the history of women's tennis, Williams cast a shadow over 
fourth-seed Nathalie Tauziat's 31st birthday celebrations, defeating 
the French player 6-3, 6-4.
