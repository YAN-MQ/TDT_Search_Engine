John McEnroe can't play as well as he used to, but his ability to 
offend with foul language remains as unbeatable as ever. McEnroe turned 
the hit and giggle Champions seniors tennis tournament, for superannuated 
and mostly good-humored players still scratching for a paycheck, into 
yet another distasteful outing Saturday. McEnroe littered his straight 
sets semi-final win over Sweden's Mikael Pernfors with swear words 
aimed at his bemused opponent, spectators and umpire Wayne McKewen. 
The rants were also picked up by television microphones near the court. 
``By nature fun and competition don't go hand in hand,'' said McEnroe, 
who won 7-6 (7-4), 6-3. Frenchman Henri Leconte prevented a final 
match-up between McEnroe and his former great rival Bjorn Borg by 
beating the Swede 6-4, 6-4 in their semi-final. Leconte broke the 
42-year-old Borg's opening service game and took control with a 4-1 
early lead. Although Borg got a break back he was unable to force 
his way back into the set, or the match. ``I'm better now than when 
I was playing on the ATP tour,'' Leconte joked. ``The way I played 
today _ I haven't played like that in a long time.'' Borg said, ``The 
Frenchman is hot. When he plays this way he is very difficult to beat.''
