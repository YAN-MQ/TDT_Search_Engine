Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has accused the remaining U.N. weapons 
inspectors in Iraq of spying and urged the U.N. secretary general 
to stop their ``dangerous practices,'' the official Iraqi News Agency 
reported Saturday. In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Aziz 
demanded an investigation into the practices of about 40 U.N. arms 
monitors who are still working in Iraq, according to the agency. The 
agency did not say when the letter was sent and officials in Aziz's 
office could not be reached on the weekend. Iraq has frozen spot inspections 
by U.N. arms monitors since Aug. 5, effectively paralyzing the search 
for its illegal long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction. 
The remaining 40 inspectors and their support staff of about 60 are 
allowed to visit only those weapons sites where the United Nations 
already has surveillance equipment installed. Aziz wrote that even 
activities by these monitors border on espionage, the agency reported. 
U.N. arms officials in Baghdad were not available for comment. Aziz 
accused the monitors of trying to photograph troop movements, of asking 
for the names of Iraqis who hold high degrees, and of demanding an 
inventory of Iraq's water resources. ``Demanding special and new information 
about personnel, vital activities or strategic establishments closely 
linked to the security of the Iraqi people and its future (is an example) 
of these dangerous practices,'' Aziz wrote. ``There is no justification 
for getting information on all the water resources ... Our conviction 
is that insistence on demanding such information is nothing but an 
act of espionage.'' Iraq has long called for a halt to the U.N. inspections, 
saying it no longer possesses banned weaponry. But the inspectors' 
reports have accused the Baghdad government of withholding significant 
information. The trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait will not be lifted until Baghdad shows it has eliminated 
its illegal arms.
