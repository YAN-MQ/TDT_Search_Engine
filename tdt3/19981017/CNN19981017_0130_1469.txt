The world's most expensive hotel is open for business in Las Vegas. 
The $1.6 billion bellagio is a mega-resort replicating a tuscan village. 
The 36-story hotel/casino has 3,000 rooms and 10,000 employees. It 
sits beside a 22 million-gallon lake with 1,000 fountains. Four additional 
mega-resorts are scheduled to open on the Vegas strip in the next 
two years.
