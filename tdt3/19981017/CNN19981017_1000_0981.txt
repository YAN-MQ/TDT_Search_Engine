A windfall from the federal reserve was a shot in Wall Street's arm 
this week, but some major companies are still feeling the pinch of 
a global economic crisis. David Daniel looks at the week in business. 
Somewhat unexpected, but very welcome on Wall Street. Federal reserve 
chairman Alan Greenspan ordered surprise quarter-point cuts in two 
key interest rates Thursday. It was the fed's second such move in 
less than a month, and the first time it's changed rates between scheduled 
meetings in 4 1/2 years. The rate cuts made a good week on Wall Street 
even better. The Dow gained some 515 points for the week, 330 points 
on Thursday alone and ended four out of five sessions on the plus 
side.
