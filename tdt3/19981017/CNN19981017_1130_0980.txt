A record harvest is usually cause for celebration, but in Washington 
state, a bumper crop of apples is causing concern. Casey wian reports. 
They call it the apple capital. In the shadow of the majestic cascade 
mountains, and along the banks of the mighty Columbia river, lies 
wenatchee, Washington. Grant Daniel is a third-generation apple Grower. 
Like many others in the nation's leading apple-producing state, Daniel 
is afraid he'll lose money this year. The first problem is, is we 
probably will pick the largest crop we've ever picked in Washington 
state. Second problem is, we're facing shrinking markets. We actually 
have less places in the world to sell our apples, which means that 
we get stuck in the traditional supply-and-demand mode. When you have 
too many, they get cheaper." At about $12 a box, Washington apples 
are more than 15% cheaper than last year. With exports to Asia and 
Mexico down by nearly 9 million boxes this year, it only pays to pick 
the best. In the past, we -- we've picked almost every apple. This 
year, probably 30% of the fruit is being left in the Orchard, especially 
in our Orchard. Growers used to be able to get $180 a ton selling 
blemished apples for juice. But because China has more than tripled 
its apple production since 1990, the juice market is flooded. Juice-grade 
prices have dropped nearly 90%, to $20 a ton, not enough to cover 
picking costs. Already, many growers are making plans to chop down 
and burn some of their existing orchards and replant them with more 
profitable varieties of apples. Some who can't afford to do that may 
be forced out of business altogether. Casey wian, "CNN Financial News," 
wenatchee, Washington.
