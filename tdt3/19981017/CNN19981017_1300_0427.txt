It could be a rough weekend for parts of Mexico because of two storms 
in the pacific ocean. The more powerful of the two is hurricane Lester, 
which could dump up to ten inches of rain on southern Mexico. At last 
report, Lester had top sustained wind of about 96 miles per hour, 
and was located less than 100 miles off the coast. Tropical storm 
Madeleine is over Baja, California, with 65-mile-per-hour winds. Forecasters 
say that storm may strengthen into a hurricane today and could eventually 
affect Texas.
