The world series begins tonight. We'll have a preview next in "Headline 
Sports." where do ideas come from? Well, while that's still a mystery, 
it's obvious where a lot of the good ones go. Into Dodge stratus. 
A car full of ideas like cab-forward design and competition-inspired 
suspension. And no-extra cost ideas like power locks, windows, dual-heated 
mirrors... et cetera, et cetera, et cetera stratus. Good thing we 
don't charge by the idea. My dad always said: as soon as I get a computer 
you'll come out with something better. So, to make sure people like 
dad have the latest computer we invented Your:)Ware-- technology that 
grows with you. For just $49.95 a month you can buy a computer with 
an Intel Pentium II processor Internet access and in two years you 
can trade it in towards the purchase of a new one. What do you call 
this thing? Your:)Ware. Call 1-800-gateway and let's talk about Your:)Ware. 
I believe I can call I think I'll use the phone in the hall I call 
my friends just to say hi... with five cent sundays from MCI. My space 
jam buddies and I stay in close touch with MCI's five cent sundays. 
Just five cents a minute... Every minute... Every Sunday. Along with 
low wates... low..rates, all week long. Call 1-800-sundays to become 
an MCI customer. I believe I can call. Oh, my goodness! Stocks, bonds 
equities, large cap... ooh, ten best bets. Whoa! Peter Lynch! Can 
I help you out? Whoo! Talk about information overload. It's too much. 
But you must know all this. You don't need all this. It's my mission 
to be informed. Fidelity can help you work out what you should know. 
Hmm... for your free investing guide or visit fidelity.com. just browsing.
