In his weekly radio address, President Clinton concentrated on economic 
issues. He urged Japanese lawmakers to continue to pass fiscal reforms, 
arguing tokyo must take the lead in reversing Asia's economic downturn. 
Mr. Clinton hailed the recent budget agreement, but noted that several 
days of cooperation does not erase months of partisan bickering. One 
contentious issue during the budget debate was the international monetary 
fund. The president said it was crucial to secure funding for the 
IMF, despite gOP misgivings. Through the international monetary fund, 
nations can join forces to help nations help themselves. That's why 
I worked with democratic and republican members of Congress to meet 
our commitment to the IMF with a package of tough reforms to make 
the fund more accountable, more focused on growth and better equipped 
to address the economic crisis of the 21st century.
