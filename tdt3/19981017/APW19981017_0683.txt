Eighty students were admitted to hospital Saturday after eating contaminated 
biscuits in the second such case in a week, Egypt's official news 
agency reported. Some of the students were in a critical condition, 
the Middle East News Agency said. The students ate the biscuits in 
several schools in al-Saf, a town in Giza province near Cairo, the 
agency said. It did not give the age of the pupils. The provincial 
governor has banned the biscuits. On Oct. 11, about 1,400 children 
were admitted to hospital after eating contaminated biscuits in primary, 
middle and secondary schools in Darin, a village in the Nile delta 
province of Mansoura. The authorities are investigating the source 
of the contamination.
