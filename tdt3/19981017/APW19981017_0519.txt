Top-ranked Pete Sampras downed fellow American Todd Martin 6-3, 7-6 
(7-4) Saturday to advance to the final of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy 
ATP. On Sunday, he'll seek his fourth title of the year and first 
since Wimbledon against seventh-ranked Karol Kucera of Slovakia, who 
defeated Britain's Greg Rusedski 7-6 (8-6), 6-4. Sampras needed an 
hour, 21 minutes to dispose of the 29th-ranked Martin. He took control 
of the first set in the sixth game, when he hit a crosscourt backhand 
past the onrushing Martin for a break that put him up 4-2. After falling 
behind a break in the second set, he pulled even at 6-all and then 
won the first three points of the tiebreak en route to the victory. 
``There was very little difference between Todd and I today,'' said 
Sampras, who described his play Saturday as not spectacular but ``solid.'' 
``It all came down to the tiebreak.'' Sampras, involved in a close 
race with Patrick Rafter and Marcelo Rios for the top ranking as the 
season enters its final weeks, entered the indoor tournament at Vienna's 
Stadthalle at the last moment as a wild card. In a bid to become the 
first player to finish the year as No. 1 for six straight years, he 
is playing five consecutive tournaments in Europe leading up to next 
month's ATP Tour World Championship in Hannover, Germany. ``This week 
certainly helps'' in that effort, said Sampras after beating Martin. 
``Basel was not a good week last week'' _ a reference to his early 
exit from the Swiss tournament. The No. 2-ranked Rafter was eliminated 
in Friday's quarterfinals by Rusedski, last year's Vienna runner-up 
to Goran Ivanisevic. Kucera remained on track to nail down a spot 
in the eight-man Hannover finale. In the first set, he trailed 4-1 
and was facing set point at 5-6 before coming back. Rusedski double-faulted 
eight times.
