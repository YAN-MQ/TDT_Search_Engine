New York state's campaign finance system is ``dreadful'' and ought 
to be overhauled, Gov. George Pataki said in an interview, but he 
suggested that any real reform would be difficult to achieve and refused 
to detail what changes he might want to make. In an hourlong interview 
Thursday with editors, reporters and executives of The New York Times, 
Pataki did say he would like to change the system in a second term, 
but not precisely how. ``I have some thoughts, but I don't want to 
talk about them,'' he said. Moments later, he appeared to retreat 
from that, insisting, ``I do not have a plan.'' Throughout the interview, 
the Republican governor, who is running for re-election, dwelled on 
the accomplishments of his first term, like cutting taxes, promoting 
business growth and changing the welfare system. ``There were a lot 
of skeptics around the state who didn't believe that we'd be able 
to achieve what we set out to do,'' he said. ``But I think if you 
look back over what we've achieved in the last four years it is truly 
historic.'' But the governor had little to say about what he will 
do if voters grant him a second term Nov. 3, except that it will be 
more of the same. In addition to his coyness on campaign finance, 
he was elusive on other topics, including the next state budget, legislative 
redistricting after the next census, and whether he would run for 
president or vice president in 2000. He also refused to be pinned 
down as to whether he would debate his Democratic opponent, Peter 
Vallone, or to explain why, a month after Vallone began demanding 
debates, none have taken place or been scheduled. He said it was up 
to the candidates' campaigns to arrange debates, as if he had no say 
in the process. When asked to list his agenda for a second term, Pataki 
declined. ``In '94 I didn't say there were one or two top goals, and 
I wouldn't say it now,'' he said. In fact in 1994, when he was running 
for his first term, Pataki did campaign on two main issues: reducing 
taxes and reinstituting the death penalty. He often cites his success 
in achieving both goals. Among the few specific objectives Pataki 
did cite in the interview were apprenticeships for welfare recipients 
and removing pollution from the Hudson River. On the way candidates 
raise money to run for office, the governor said: ``Our campaign finance 
system is dreadful. I think it's dreadful. And I don't like it, I 
have never liked it. What we need is a comprehensive approach to solve 
it.'' Such sentiments are notable if only because the governor has 
done exceedingly well under the current system, and he has shown no 
inclination in the past to change it. He raised $14.5 million for 
his 1994 run, setting a record for New York campaigns that he has 
shattered this year, raising nearly $20 million. The governor said 
there should be restrictions on ``independent expenditure'' campaigns 
that interest groups, from unions to the tobacco industry, run for 
or against candidates. ``They don't even have to file and disclose 
who they are and what they're spending money on,'' he said. There 
should also be limits, he said, on how much of their own money wealthy 
people can spend in pursuit of public office, referring obliquely 
to B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate running against 
Pataki, who plans to spend $20 million of his money. But Pataki acknowledged 
that so far, no one has found a way to reach either goal without unconstitutionally 
restricting free speech. The governor said any attempt at campaign 
finance reform should also look at ``soft money,'' the unlimited contributions 
that parties can accept as long as they do not go directly into specific 
campaigns, and at transfers from parties to candidates, or between 
candidates. But he would not say that he opposed either practice. 
Looking ahead, Pataki would not pledge to serve out a second four-year 
term, or rule out a run for national office. ``It's flattering when 
people talk, you know, and say that you could run for national office,'' 
he said. ``It has never been an obsession of mine; New York state 
has been.'' ``But,'' he added, ``you never say never.'' He offered 
some criticism of his party's leaders in Congress, who, he said, ``had 
a difficult time transitioning from a minority to a majority,'' and 
said that in 2000, governors like him ought to be more involved in 
setting the Republican national agenda. In reviewing his record, the 
governor concentrated on tax cuts and on the ways he has lightened 
burdens on business, like lowering the cost of worker's compensation 
and unemployment insurance, and deregulating hospital pricing. ``Every 
single year we have been number one in America in reducing taxes,'' 
he said. The result of his policies, he said, is, ``We're seeing economic 
growth that we haven't seen in years prior to that.'' The governor 
boasted, as he frequently does, that private-sector employment is 
up by 360,000 jobs since he took office, though New York's pace of 
growth still lags behind the national rate and has been concentrated 
in the New York City area. Pataki defended his handling of state finances, 
and dismissed warnings from some independent fiscal monitors that 
it has become too dependent on Wall Street, and too vulnerable to 
a sharp downturn. He noted that the state had ended each of the last 
three fiscal years with a large surplus, and is headed for another 
surplus this year. ``We have never counted on Wall Street continuing,'' 
he said. Pataki spoke frequently of the sharp declines in crime and 
in the welfare rolls, taking much of the credit for both. He asserted 
that most of the 570,000 people who have left welfare have found work, 
and grew insistent when asked how he knew that to be the case. ``Well, 
of course it's true,'' he said. ``If they're not on social services, 
what do you think?'' A study earlier this year by the State Office 
of Temporary and Disability Assistance found that of people who had 
left welfare over a nine-month period in 1996 and 1997, only 29 percent 
had found even minimal employment.
