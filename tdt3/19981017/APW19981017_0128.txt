Two sisters whose parents were shot and killed by police over a suspected 
kidnapping have sued the government and Malaysia's top police officials, 
a news report said Saturday. In the suit filed in High Court Friday 
through their grandmother, Alameloo Mangai Gunasekaran, 8, and Keerthana, 
5, said police stormed their house and killed their mother, who was 
eight months pregnant, the New Straits Times daily reported. They 
accused police of acting in a ``lethal'' manner on Oct. 2 by also 
killing their father and three others without properly identifying 
the occupants in the house or giving them a chance to surrender by 
firing warning shots. The children are claiming 80,500 ringgit (dlrs 
21,200) as compensation for burial expenses and 500 ringgit (dlrs 
130) each month over the next 13 years. Malaysia's police chief, Rahim 
Noor, named as one of the respondents in the suit acknowledged Saturday 
the sisters' right to sue. ``We, the police, cannot deny them their 
right,'' he said. Rahim explained that the authorities raided the 
house on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur to apprehend a group of people 
suspected of kidnapping the son of a prominent former politician. 
The shooting occured after the kidnap victim was rescued and the ransom 
money recovered. Firearms and an unspecified amount of money were 
found at the house, police said. After their 31-year old mother was 
shot, police left her unattended and didn't try to save the unborn 
child, the court appeal said. No hearing date has been fixed.
