Sylvia Rodriguez and her son Andrew recently went shopping at the 
Kmart near Co-op City in the Bronx. The place is huge and Andrew is 
young, so it was only a matter of time and nature before the 8-year-old 
wandered off to explore the aisles that beckoned with toys. His mother 
cried as she scoured the store. ``I was so scared that I asked three 
managers to call out for him on the microphone,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. 
``Soon, he was by my side again. And there I was, swallowing my tears. 
I did not feel embarrassed. I was crying for something that was mine.'' 
She has withstood greater pain to keep what's hers. In 1994, she spent 
nearly four months without the boy _ a foster child she was preparing 
to adopt _ when his foster care agency and the city removed him from 
her Morris Heights apartment while investigating allegations of neglect. 
Ms. Rodriguez had not been home when a caseworker found Andrew and 
another foster child being looked after by her 12-year-old grandson. 
During much of their time apart, Ms. Rodriguez could not contest the 
removal or even visit Andrew. The boy was returned when officials 
found no basis for the allegations. Last month, a federal judge presiding 
over a lawsuit stemming from Andrew's removal ruled that some foster 
parents have the same rights as birth parents to promptly contest 
a child's removal. The decision was hailed by foster parent advocates 
who had been stymied since 1977 in their pursuit of equal rights for 
families who are bound by love but not blood. Ms. Rodriguez, a thin 
70-year-old who raised six of her own children before becoming a foster 
mother for another six, shares her victory with the thousands of others 
like her who have felt shortchanged by the child care system. ``These 
other women have been given the right to fight and say, `Don't fool 
us anymore,''' she said. ``I don't have much time. I won't see it. 
But others will see it. Others will see this was done. That this simple 
woman did this.'' Life as a foster parent was hardly simple. While 
caring for other people's children, she was caught in an endless routine 
of taking them to doctors, psychologists, caseworkers and visits with 
their birth parents. Some children arrived as infants; others were 
teen-agers who had grown unruly after shuttling from home to home. 
Money was tight and patience was tried. ``But I felt proud,'' she 
said. ``I was giving love to a child who was not mine. And never, 
put it down, never did any of my foster children have to go to a hospital 
emergency room. For nothing.'' Difficult as it was, she also had to 
accept when a child would be reunited with birth parents. That would 
not happen with Andrew, since a court had taken him away from them. 
He came to her as an infant in 1990 from Cardinal McCloskey Children's 
and Family Services, a foster care agency that had given Ms. Rodriguez 
good evaluations as a foster parent. She soon knew she would adopt 
him. She was devastated when he was removed from her home in March 
1994. ``That was something I could not endure,'' she recalled. ``I 
have grown children. I have family. I love them, but not like Andrew. 
He is alone. He only has me.'' The strength of those emotional bonds 
was a point her lawyers pursued in their lawsuit against the foster 
care agency and the city. The trial is scheduled for early November. 
``Sylvia is the only mother this child had,'' said Howard Seife, a 
lawyer with Chadbourne &AMP; Parke, which is handling the case pro 
bono. ``She had the kid from when he was 13 days old, and without 
a second thought they were separated and refused visitation until 
after 4 months we finally forced them.'' Ms. Rodriguez can barely 
speak about the days she went without food or sleep when Andrew was 
away. She cries and waves off questions. ``It was hard,'' she said. 
``That will always be in my mind until I die.'' That may be sooner 
than she imagined. She has a liver tumor, and she needs an operation. 
Without a transplant, doctors have told her there is little they can 
do. Her lawyers hope that the lawsuit can help her provide for herself, 
Andrew and two other children who still live with her. She prefers 
not to talk about money, since she never had much. ``I can tell you 
about Andrew,'' she insisted. ``I am already taking steps in case 
I die. He'll be with whatever person cares for him the most. That's 
if I die. It's only a saying. Who knows? I just want to give whatever 
time I have left to this little boy.''
