Swirling floodwaters threatened to submerge nearly 100 villages in 
a southern Indian state on Saturday, officials said. At least 80 people 
were feared dead, either drowned or crushed under collapsed houses, 
and more than 50,000 panicky villagers crowded into trucks and boats 
in an attempt to flee the encroaching waters. In the districts of 
Krishna, Guntur and Nalgonda, nearly 100,000 people have already been 
evacuated to higher ground. Police forcibly removed some residents 
who didn't want to leave their homes. Government officials in Hyderabad, 
the capital of Andhra Pradesh state, said the floods were caused by 
heavy monsoon rains that overflowed the Krishna river. Two air force 
helicopters dropped food and waters bottles to flood-hit villages, 
said B.P. Acharya, relief commissioner in the state. In the Diviseema 
region, the Krishna river submerged the only road link to a cluster 
of 30 villages, marooning almost 20,000 people. Cotton, tobacco and 
paddy rice crops and banana plantations have been devastated on nearly 
half a million acres, Acharya said. With a long coast line, the state 
is often hit by floods and cyclones. In 1996, a fierce cyclone killed 
more than 2,000 people.
