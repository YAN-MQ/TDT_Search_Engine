The University of Notre Dame unveiled its impressive new Dublin headquarters 
Saturday, far and away the most substantial project undertaken by 
an American college in Ireland. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern welcomed 
more than 100 university officials and the 33 American students already 
studying in Dublin under the auspices of the Keough-Notre Dame Study 
Center, opened as part of a dlrs 13 million project principally funded 
by Irish-American alumnus Donald Keough. The program's classrooms 
and offices are on the top floor of what was once the Catholic University 
of Ireland, a building of restored Victorian splendor overlooking 
St. Stephen's Green. ``To breathe life into this historic building 
is frankly thrilling,'' said Keough, former president of Coca-Cola 
Corp. and current chairman of investment bankers Allen and Co. Inc. 
Keough noted that his ongoing funding of a Keough Institute of Irish 
Studies at Notre Dame's South Bend, Indiana, campus left his ambitions 
``only half done.'' ``Students are already coming to Notre Dame to 
explore their Irish background and history,'' he said. ``Not to allow 
some of them the chance to experience modern Ireland itself would 
be tragic and foolish when there's the resources to do so.'' University 
President Edward Malloy said Notre Dame began sending business students 
to University College Dublin six years ago. Plans to open a permanent 
Dublin mission with the university's own lecturers accelerated after 
Notre Dame and Navy staged a football game in the Irish capital in 
1995. ``The aim is to create a legitimate international vehicle for 
Irish studies, in genuine partnership with Irish academics,'' he said, 
noting that the university hopes to send about 100 students to Ireland 
annually _ the only U.S. institution with such a commitment. The students 
themselves seem enthusiastic about living and learning in the center 
of one of Europe's most sociable and rapidly expanding cities. Most 
are attending University College Dublin classes through December, 
others until May. ``I've been amazed to see all these American companies, 
most of which evidently have arrived on the scene in the recent past,'' 
said commerce student David Frick, a pony-tailed 20-year-old from 
Elkhart, Ind. ``It's obvious why they're calling Ireland the `Celtic 
Tiger.''' At an afternoon ceremony on the Trinity campus, Notre Dame 
Provost Nathan Hatch paid tribute to Ahern as the person who had helped 
``revive a stalled peace process'' after his June 1997 election as 
prime minister. Referring to the April accord reached in Belfast by 
eight parties and the British and Irish governments, Hatch said, gesturing 
to Ahern beside him: ``The Good Friday agreement will always stand 
as a monument to his outstanding contribution to Irish life.'' A disappointing 
if understandable no-show was John Hume, Northern Ireland's most prominent 
Catholic leader, who was a joint winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for 
his central role in promoting the Belfast negotiations. Later the 
staff and students held a dedication Mass in the University College 
Dublin church beside the new center.
