Thailand's Pichit Chor Siriwat retained his World Boxing Association 
junior flyweight title against seventh-ranked contender Lee Tae Gil 
of South Korea when the ringside doctor stopped the fight at the end 
of seventh round. Lee, 25, was cut above his left eye in the third 
round. By the end of the seventh, his other eye was almost closed 
shut. Pichit, 23, dominated the fight and delighted the home crowd 
with stiff jabs and left hooks that found their targets with little 
resistance. The Thai came into the fight with a record of 18 wins, 
eight by knockouts, and 1 loss. Pichit put Lee off balance on several 
occasions but was unable to knock down the challenger, who put up 
a brave fight. Lee came into the bout with a record of 16 wins, two 
losses and one draw. Both fighters weighed in at 108 pounds ( 49 kilograms).
