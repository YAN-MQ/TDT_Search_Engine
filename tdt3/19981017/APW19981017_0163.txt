Four people died as snow, gales and heavy rain swept parts of Britain 
early Saturday. Three men, aged 70, 18 and one in his 20s, died when 
two cars collided in heavy winds of up to 90 miles and hour (145 kms 
an hour) in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland. In the province's second largest 
city, Londonderry, high winds tore down trees. At Southend in the 
Scottish county of Kintyre, farmer John Hobbs, 54, was found dead 
in a stream as driving rain flooded roads and delayed traffic. In 
southwest Wales, the Environment Agency warned that the rivers Loughor, 
Tawe and Neath could flood as more than 80 millimeters (3 inches) 
of rain fell in 15 hours. Sand bags were distributed in Swansea and 
Neath, but no homes were evacuated. The Meteorological Office said 
snow that fell in the Scottish Highlands could spread to the low country, 
unusual for this time of year.
