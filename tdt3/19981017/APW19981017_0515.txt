An American has been charged with killing a German couple and paying 
three Dominicans to bury their bodies in front of their home in this 
Caribbean country, police said Saturday. Peter and Barbara Herman 
were reported missing a month ago when they did not make a planned 
trip to Germany, said police spokesman Col. Simon Diaz. Their bodies 
were found buried in the sand in Juan Dolio, a tourism-based town 
about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Santo Domingo. Police have 
arrested an American, Dennis Manley, 46, and charged him with murdering 
the two Germans. Investigators were led to Manley after they questioned 
Martin de la Rosa Laureano, a Dominican who worked for the victims, 
said Diaz. De la Rosa told police he witnessed the killing and that 
Manley paid him and two other men, brothers Socimo and Ramon Castro, 
20,000 Dominican pesos (dlrs 1,300) each to bury the bodies. ``Dennis 
Manley has not confessed to the crime, but according to the statements 
by Martin de la Rosa Laureano, the American killed the couple with 
a shot to the head,'' Diaz said. Police are still unsure of a motive 
or date for the killings. The hometowns of Manley and the Germans 
were not available from police.
