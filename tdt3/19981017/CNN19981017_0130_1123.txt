Donald trump is planning to build the world's highest apartment building 
in New York City. The 90-story tower would go up across from the United 
Nations and unit prices would be in the $1 million range. The $360 
million project, of course, must clear many hurdles, including government 
regulations and difficulties in financing. Still, trump is aiming 
to complete it by the year 2001.
