With "Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven. We'll get to the gridiron 
in a moment. Lefty David Wells took the hill for the yafrpgs. San 
Diego puts its faith behind kefben brown, who is 12-3 lifetime against 
New York. They can be beat. We've got to be in the top of our game 
to beat them, and hopefully, he'll make some mistakes and we'll be 
able to capitalize on them. I don't think he will make many. Andy 
pettitte will watch the game from Houston where his father underwent 
triple bypass surgery.
