England coach Glenn Hoddle Saturday condemned as ``a vicious lie'' 
a newspaper report that team captain Alan Shearer led a players mutiny 
against him after Wednesday's European Championship game against Luxembourg. 
According to the Sun tabloid, Shearer questioned Hoddle's own performance 
as coach after the players had been asked why they had played with 
so little passion in the 3-0 victory in Luxembourg. ``Have you thought 
it could be you?'' Shearer is reported to have told Hoddle. Both Hoddle 
and Shearer reacted Saturday by saying there was no such confrontation 
between the two although it was admitted there was a heated debate 
among the players about the disappointing performance. ``The story 
is nonsense,'' Shearer said. ``There was a discussion in the dressing 
room after the game but I'm not prepared to say what was said. ``I 
believe that dressing room conversations are and should remain private. 
But I never used the words that appeared on the front page of the 
newspaper today.'' Hoddle condemned the Sun story. ``Today's story 
about what happened in the England dressing room in Luxembourg is 
a vicious lie. I can only guess at why anybody should write it,'' 
the England coach said. ``We weren't particularly happy with our second-half 
performance and the discussions you have, they go on time and time 
again. ``In every dressing room this afternoon at quarter to five 
there'll be heated moments, there'll be some good discussions, there'll 
be some feedback from players, and that's exactly what it was.'' ``There 
is no truth in the story whatsoever,'' Hoddle said. ``If their aim 
is to undermine me, it has had the opposite effect. What they clearly 
aren't trying to do is to help England qualify for Euro 2000. ``That's 
what I want. So does Alan Shearer. So do millions of people around 
the country.''
