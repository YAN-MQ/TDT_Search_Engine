A female warder found nothing against the rules when she strip-searched 
an inmate at a women's prison here. But the inmate was in contravention. 
He was a man, a police official said Saturday. Ismail Mohammed Abdullah, 
17, gave his name as Rascha, a woman's name, when he was arrested 
with two friends on a charge of theft. Police were fooled by his elaborate 
disguise, and so were fellow inmates after Abdullah was transferred 
to a women's prison. It was only when the warder searched Abdullah 
on Friday that she found his breasts to be fake, the police official 
said. His fellow cell mates said Abdullah's mannerisms and actions 
were not those of a man, the official reported, speaking on customary 
condition of anonymity. Abdullah told police he ``hates men'' and 
that he wants to have a sex change operation. The official said Abdullah 
is now in a police station, awaiting transfer to a men's prison.
