Sen. Alfonse D'Amato charged across upstate New York on Saturday, 
mocking Rep. Charles Schumer as ``The Phantom'' for missing votes 
in Congress this year. Schumer campaigned by marking the six-year 
anniversary of D'Amato's pledge, later abandoned, not to run again 
if voters rewarded him with a third term. With identical props _ a 
videotape player and a television monitor _ to display their latest 
attack advertisements, D'Amato and Schumer used a crisp and pleasant 
fall Saturday to offer the scathing assessments of each other that 
have come to define their campaign for U.S. Senate. D'Amato said Schumer 
was a derelict legislator who had neglected his congressional duties 
by skipping votes this year. Schumer said D'Amato was untrustworthy, 
offering as evidence the promise the senator made in the heat of the 
1992 campaign to retire from politics if voters sent him to Washington 
for a final term in which, D'Amato said then, he would not be guided 
by re-election concerns. The exchanges came as the candidates tried 
to make the most out of the dwindling number of weekends left before 
Election Day, each trying to seize the offensive as they headed into 
the last two weeks of a contest that both campaigns view as excruciatingly 
close. Their choice of campaign stops Saturday indicated where D'Amato 
and Schumer see their strengths. D'Amato campaigned in five upstate 
cities, bouncing around in a private plane before returning home to 
New York. Schumer campaigned in Manhattan and Albany. It was D'Amato's 
second swing upstate in a week, and it suggested the importance that 
the Republican senator had attached to a strong showing in a part 
of the state where Republicans have historically done well. Saturday 
was also, for D'Amato, a day of familiar attacks: for the 17th day 
in a row, he assailed Schumer for missing votes in Congress this year. 
Schumer has a 77 percent attendance record in Congress this year, 
missing slightly more than 100 votes, mostly on procedural matters 
or on bills that passed by overwhelming margins. His lifetime attendance 
record during his 18 years in Congress is just under 93 percent. To 
make his point, D'Amato described his own efforts to bring aid to 
upstate New York after it was devastated by winter storms this year. 
Speaking at an airport terminal in Rochester to about 100 supporters, 
D'Amato noted that Schumer was absent when the bill first came up 
in the House. And D'Amato noted that although Schumer was present 
when the bill came up for a final vote, he voted against it. ``We're 
better off if The Phantom hadn't shown up,'' D'Amato said, ``because 
The Phantom voted against aid to the North Country.'' Schumer has 
said he opposed the measure, as did most other Democrats, because 
he viewed it as a partisan bill that financed the emergency assistance 
with deep cuts in housing funds. In Manhattan, Schumer took advantage 
of one of D'Amato's most famous 1992 campaign moments _ his pledge 
to retire from politics _ with the help of a 59-by-47-inch blowup 
of the Oct. 18, 1992, front page of The Daily News. ``D'Amato Stunner: 
My Last Run,'' the headline said. His audience of supporters burst 
out laughing when the placard was unveiled. The congressman from Brooklyn 
has repeatedly described D'Amato as untrustworthy _ the tag line on 
a new Schumer advertisement that features the Daily News headline 
is ``Too many lies for too long'' _ and he asserted that this particular 
broken promise was evidence of that. Schumer noted that D'Amato said 
in 1992 that he was making the pledge because he wanted to spend six 
years in the Senate without people asserting that his behavior was 
motivated by re-election concerns. ``Do you know what he did right 
after he got elected?'' Schumer said. ``He became chairman of the 
national Senate Republican Campaign Committee, the most blatantly 
political position you can hold. Then, shortly after that, he embarked 
on his partisan and political inquisition of the first family.'' In 
Rochester, D'Amato, whose itinerary also included stops in Buffalo, 
Syracuse, Binghamton and Plattsburgh, responded to Schumer by repeating 
the explanation he gave when he first signaled, shortly after Election 
Day 1992, that this was one campaign promise that might not be kept. 
D'Amato said that in light of his victory, and with some rest, he 
reconsidered his position and decided that he would like to continue 
his career in the Senate. D'Amato was traveling in what his aides 
considered friendly territory Saturday, and at the arranged rallies 
in airport terminals, he was greeted by chants of ``Six more years.'' 
Even so, the senator found himself scrapping with a reporter at one 
upstate news conference over the nature of his attacks on Schumer. 
``He may find that personally embarrassing,'' said D'Amato, referring 
to Schumer's reaction to attacks on his attendance record. ``But don't 
you think that it's reasonable or fair to pull that out? I ask you, 
in all intellectual honesty _ forget the fact that you don't like 
me.'' When the reporter challenged that assertion, D'Amato responded 
acidly, ``It's dripping through.''
