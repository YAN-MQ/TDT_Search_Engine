Sources tell CNN, Paula Jones's attorneys have prepared a new out-of-court 
settlement of her sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. 
It would give Jones $2 million, $1 million dollar from the president 
and $1 million offered by a New York real estate developer. The offer 
hasn't been made to the president's lawyers yet because of a Dispute 
over legal fees among Jones's lawyers. Meantime, documents in the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment case against president will be made 
available on the Internet next week. But chances are you won't be 
able to see them. Bob Cain reports. Judge Susan weber Wright is releasing 
dozens of previously-sealed documents in the Jones case, which she 
dismissed last April. But the judge says depositions by President 
Clinton, Paula Jones and defendant Danny Ferguson will not be made 
public. What will be released? The court isn't saying the mystery 
documents will be posted on the court's web site, beginning at 6:00 
eastern, Monday morning. Word of the release comes as the clock ticks 
toward Tuesday's scheduled court hearing in St. Paul. That's when 
Jones' attorneys are expected to ask the federal appeals court to 
reinstate the sexual harassment case against the president. Both the 
White House and Jones' lawyers continue working to reach a Settlement 
before Tuesday's hearing. But those efforts are complicated by the 
battle between Jones' attorneys -- past and present -- to get paid 
for their work in the case. Her interest, we believe, should come 
first. And that's where it's at. And if we're willing to give, we're 
willing to give. And if that's true, this thing can be settled. But 
there is a lot of inflexibility from other people, obviouslyly it 
puts this thing in jeopardy, and there won't be a settlement. While 
Jones legal team argues, a $700,000 settlement offer by the president's 
attorneys sits on the table unanswered, as does a $1 million check 
from New York businessman abe hirschfeld. Bob Cain, CNN.
