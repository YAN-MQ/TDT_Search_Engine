Pro-democracy protestors on Saturday charged that police beat five 
youths during elections in one of the world's last absolute monarchies 
and accused the government of inviting violence by manipulating the 
vote. After heavy rains kept many voters from the polls on Friday, 
election officials added another day for voting _ Oct. 24 _ because 
of the flooding. ``The longer this takes the more anger grows,'' said 
Mario Masuku, president of the People's United Democratic Movement 
(PUDEMO). The youths believed to have been beaten for their protests 
on election day were receiving medical treatment, according to a spokesman 
for the Human Rights Association of Swaziland, a non-governmental 
organization in Mbabane. PUDEMO said it reported the beating to Amnesty 
International in London. Police in Swaziland, a country of 1 million 
people sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique, also used tear 
gas to break up a demonstration by about 100 protesters calling for 
greater democracy. No arrests were reported. Candidates were nominated 
individually because parties have been banned by royal decree since 
1973. Swaziland's legislature serves little purpose other than as 
a rubber stamp for the Cabinet, appointed by King Mswati III, who 
was out of the country on a visit to Asia to seek foreign investment. 
Since 1990, police have systematically suppressed PUDEMO. The election 
is being watched closely in a part of Africa where democracy received 
a major boost with South Africa's first free elections in 1994. Masuku 
said PUDEMO would continue to boycott and protest against the second 
voting day. He said the extension would give the government more time 
to intimidate voters into going to the polls and increased the chances 
of election fraud. Turnout was low on Friday, due as much to heavy 
rain and flooding as to calls for a boycott by pro-democracy groups. 
Masuku claimed the turnout was only 13 percent. Election officials 
declined to give figures. Turnout in the country's first vote, in 
1993, was 17 percent. In sub-Saharan Africa's other monarchy, Lesotho, 
months of opposition unrest over May elections led South Africa, which 
surrounds the tiny state, to send in troops to restore order.
