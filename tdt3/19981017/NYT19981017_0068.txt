Peter Paul Artaserse, a retired Jersey City lawyer, Superior Court 
judge and former state legislator, died Sunday at General Hospital 
Center in Passaic. He was 98 and lived in Clifton, N.J. He had suffered 
a brief illness, his family said. Artaserse was the son of Italian 
immigrants and had eight siblings. He was born in Manhattan and grew 
up in Jersey City, where he lived most of his life. He never attended 
college, but took night classes to earn his academic high school certificate 
and the degree from New Jersey Law School with which he went into 
private practice. He soon became active in the Hudson County Democratic 
Party and in 1934 was elected to the Assembly. He held elected office 
for 17 years, rising to Democratic minority leader and dean of the 
House. Gov. Alfred E. Driscoll, a Republican, appointed him to Superior 
Court in 1954, and he worked as a judge for 17 years in Hudson County 
and on the Appellate Division. He stepped down as assignment, or administrative, 
judge for the county in 1971 after reaching the mandatory retirement 
age. Artaserse was then affiliated with what is now the Jersey City 
firm of Schumann, Hanlon, Doherty, McCrossin &AMP; Paolino. He retired 
from practice in 1989 at age 89. A former president of the Hudson 
County bar, he was also active in Italian-American organizations in 
Jersey City. Among other things, he was a past president of the Jersey 
City chapter of the Dante Alighieri Society, a national organization 
for people interested in the work of the author of ``The Divine Comedy.'' 
His wife of 53 years, Muriel Dodd Artaserse, died in 1997. He is survived 
by their son, Peter, also of Clifton.
