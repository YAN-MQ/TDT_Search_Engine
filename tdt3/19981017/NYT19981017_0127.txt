No one has guaranteed Michael Jordan's return, just as no one can 
safely say when the season will start. If it's not young knuckleheads 
failing to mature, it's old sages saying goodbye. And all the while, 
these grown men who make their living off a YMCA recreation cannot 
seem to divvy up $2 billion. It is a good time to loathe this game. 
Or to wait for some curmudgeon who once played in satin shorts and 
sideburns to come out with a book detailing the demise of the National 
Basketball Association. What with labor disputes, player insurrections 
and flat-out bad basketball, Bill Bradley had more ammunition at his 
disposal than when he ran the floor with Willis Reed and Walt Frazier. 
Yet in his fourth book, ``Values of the Game,'' the former New York 
Knick and former U.S. senator does not fire away. At a time when the 
league is canceling games and searching for an identity after Larry, 
Magic and very soon Michael, one of its alumni is actually trumpeting 
its virtues. ``I wanted to show that even in the midst of all these 
other things going on, there are some things that last, some eternal 
values in the game that are accessible to a father and mother who 
want to teach the game to their children,'' Bradley said over lunch 
recently at a Manhattan restaurant. ``Or for high school coaches who 
are shaping people as much as they did 30 years ago, I wanted to show 
the continuity that is there, while not whitewashing what are the 
bad aspects of the current game.'' Bradley writes about learning more 
from people by playing a 3-on-3 game with them than he does talking 
with them for a week. He uses photographs he selected and captions 
he wrote to portray the game as a laboratory for shared human experience. 
Instead of drawing distinctions between eras, he tries to bridge a 
gap between his generation of players and today's. There are passages 
about the league's problems that hint at disenchantment, but over 
the book's 158 pages, he celebrates the pro game much more than he 
denigrates it. Why all this sappiness in the midst of NBA anarchy? 
That's apparently what happens when you walk into an empty gym, pick 
up a ball and start dropping in jump shots, as Bradley did one morning 
two years ago at his local Y in Montclair, N.J. His time at Stanford 
University as a visiting professor last year fostered that feeling, 
as he got to know the coaches and players on the Cardinal's Final 
Four men's team. ``The experience reawakened something in me that 
had been dormant for 20 years,'' he said. ``So I decided I wanted 
to write a book about my love for the game. At the same time I wanted 
to try and express it in a way that was different than `Life on the 
Run,''' he added, referring to his book about 21 days on the road 
as a professional athlete in 1974. ``I wanted to use basketball as 
the way to talk about some deeper things and long-lasting values.'' 
Given his political history, one might wonder if Bradley partly used 
the book to deliver character-building messages, words that could 
resonate with a public searching for a new Democrat. ``Whether I was 
a candidate in politics or not, these are things I believe,'' he said, 
scoffing at the notion. ``The book would've been written whatever 
the circumstances. I had a couple of drafts where I would draw lessons 
and apply them to politics. I thought, no, no, no, that's not what 
this book is. This book is about values of the game and life.'' He 
did, in fact, mention that he would decide by the end of the year 
whether to run for president in 2000. ``There are two threshold questions,'' 
he said. ``Can you add appreciably to the public welfare, given your 
skill, sense and experience? And second, do I, my wife and family 
want to jump off a 50-story building with no idea whether there is 
a net at the bottom? I'll answer those and make an internal decision.'' 
Though ``Values of the Game'' (published by the Artisan imprint of 
Workman Publishing) never delves deep into troubling issues surrounding 
professional basketball, Bradley does express genuine concern for 
the sport in the next millennium. ``It's possible to drive fans away,'' 
he writes in a chapter titled ``Respect.'' ``Gratuitous violence (Latrell 
Sprewell assaulting his coach), high ticket prices ($1,350 courtside 
seats at Madison Square Garden) and a perception that players care 
only about the money (Kevin Garnett's rejection of a $100 million 
contract as insufficient) quickly put barriers between the fans and 
the game.'' But after every knock, Bradley soon returns to the redemptive 
qualities of the sport, as if it means too much to him to scorn completely. 
He makes the monotony of practice seem purposeful and relationships 
formed on the court seem more valuable and genuine than many made 
off it. In a time of labor strife in the National Basketball Association 
and petulance and problems at all levels _ a time when there is little 
reason to love the game _ it is good to know someone still feels that 
way about basketball.
