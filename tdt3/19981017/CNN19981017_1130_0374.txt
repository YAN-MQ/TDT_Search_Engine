Republicans used their weekly radio response to counter President 
Clinton's criticism's of their party's efforts on behalf of education. 
Yesterday, President Clinton said the republicans for not doing enough. 
Republican senator Dan coats said those comments were misleading. 
Coats said Clinton killed bills on school choice, school funding and 
scholarships. Republicans passed bills helping head start students 
with disabilities and children with reading problems. Coats also criticized 
Clinton for not cutting taxes. Republicans know we can both protect 
our social security system and give hard-working families some of 
their hard hard-earned money back. This administration's refusal to 
consider a modest tax cut in light of this historic surplus is inexcusable. 
The new budget includes more than $1 billion to hire new teachers.
