CNN has learned that lawyers for Paula Jones are preparing a settlement 
offer that asks for a $2 million payout. Jones and her husband reportedly 
believe a previous offer of $700,000 is too small. The latest settlement 
offer has not yet been made to President Clinton's attorneys. This 
is reportedly due to a dispute among Jones' lawyers over fees. The 
settlement will ask for $1 million from President Clinton's camp and 
another million from wealthy New Yorker abe hirschfeld. Hirschfeld 
has previously offered $1 million for Jones to settle the suit.
