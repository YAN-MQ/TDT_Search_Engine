Looking to solidify his No. 1 world ranking, Pete Sampras downed fellow 
American Todd Martin 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) Saturday to advance to the final 
of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP tennis tournament. On Sunday, he'll 
play the winner of the other semifinal match between Karol Kucera 
of Slovakia and Britain's Greg Rusedski. Sampras needed an hour, 21 
minutes to dispose of the 29th-ranked Martin. He took control of the 
first set in the sixth game, when he hit a crosscourt backhand return 
past the onrushing Martin for a break that put him up 4-2. After falling 
behind a break in the second set, he pulled even at 6-all and then 
won the first three points of the tie-break en route to the victory. 
Sampras, involved in a close race with Patrick Rafter and Marcelo 
Rios for the top ranking as the season enters its final weeks, entered 
the indoor tournament at Vienna's Stadthalle at the last moment as 
a wild card. In a bid to become the first player to finish the year 
as No. 1 for six straight years, he is playing five consecutive tournaments 
in Europe leading up to next month's ATP Tour World Championship in 
Hanover, Germany. The No. 2-ranked Rafter was eliminated in Friday's 
quarterfinals by Rusedski, last year's Vienna runnerup to Goran Ivanisevic. 
Kucera, ranked seventh in the world, was trying to remain on track 
Saturday to nail down a spot in the eight-man Hanover finale.
