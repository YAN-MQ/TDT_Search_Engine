FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - A former Nazi doctor who admits working 
in a medical laboratory at the former Auschwitz concentration camp 
denied in an interview broadcast Saturday that he took part in Holocaust 
atrocities. Hans Muench, 87, appeared confused at times in the interview 
with Associated Press Television News at his home in Bavaria. Bavarian 
prosecutors began investigating Muench this month after a magazine 
quoted him as saying that he wasn't bothered by working at Auschwitz, 
and that gassing Jews spared them from having to suffer longer from 
deadly diseases that were rampant in the camp. Muench's daughter, 
Ruli, 58, at her father's side, called the report in Der Spiegel weekly 
``absolutely false.'' But Muench said he had not interpreted it as 
having any ``big mistakes.'' At times, though, Muench appeared to 
mix his personal experiences with things he first heard of or read 
about in later years. He insisted that he had only worked in a lab 
diagnosing ``prepared samples'' of Auschwitz prisoners for possible 
disease. Muench said the hygiene institute also employed Jewish inmates 
but was separated from the Auschwitz camp. ``We knew only the prisoner's 
number,'' he said. He said that while he could surmise that inmates 
that were the victims of ``questionable,'' experiments at Auschwitz 
had been gassed, but that he was ``not competent,'' to know that himself 
at the time. Muench was acquitted of war crimes at Auschwitz by a 
court in Krakow, Poland in December 1947, after former inmates he 
worked with testified he had in fact helped them. His daughter gave 
APTN a letter dated Oct. 1 from Eva Mozes-Kor, of Terre Haute, Indiana, 
who said she accompanied Muench to Auschwitz for the 50th anniversary 
of the liberation of the camp in 1995. In the letter, Mozes-Kor says 
a doctor who had worked with Muench told her Muench had saved his 
life as well as the lives of other inmates. Mozes-Kor, a survivor 
of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele's experiments on twins at Auschwitz, 
confirmed in a telephone interview she had written the letter and 
knew Muench. ``He was a decent man even if he was in the SS,'' she 
said. Bavarian prosecutors said this week they had forwarded their 
files on Muench to Frankfurt prosecutors, who have dealt with most 
cases on Auschwitz in the past.
