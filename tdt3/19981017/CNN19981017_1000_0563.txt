An E. Coli outbreak that killed a child this summer has prompted changes 
at a suburban Atlanta water park. White water park is designing what 
a spokeswoman calls a zero-depth area for diaper-age children. It 
will have sprinklers and slides, but no pool. Plans also call for 
increasing the water quality and engineering staff. A 2-year-old girl 
died and 25 other children became ill after visiting the park this 
summer.
