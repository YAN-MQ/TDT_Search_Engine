A popular seasonal food item could pose a health risk. Ed Garsten 
reports on what to look for in apple cider and how to play it safe. 
It's rite of fall. A pilgrimage to the cider mill for a jug of the 
sweet Amber apple drink and maybe a Carmel apple. But wouldn't you 
know it something as benign as apple cider, can make you sick. There 
is a small risk these products may have bacterial contamination that 
can be potentially harmful. Bacteria like the E. Coli present in these 
apples. So one solution is pasteurization -- heating the cider up 
to 160 degrees to kill the germs. That's what Lee posely does at yates 
cider mill in Rochester hills, michigan. It can withstand the acid 
environment that the cider has and it doesn't take many cells to cause 
a person to get sick. But at uncle John's cider mill about a 100 miles 
away, pasteurization is a dirty word. The cider goes right from the 
apple into the jug. why? One, we want to maintain our high level of 
quality. Two, I'm not fond of how it looks in the jug sometimes. While 
Lee posley's pasteurized cider is clearly marked on the bottle cap, 
Mike Beck's unpasteurized product is not, although it carries a State-mandated 
warning that the product should be refrigerated. Now the federal government 
is calling on all juice producers to voluntarily place warning labels 
on unpasteurized products. The federal government decided to call 
for warning labels after a child died after drinking unpasteurized 
apple juice. The juice was infected with E. Coli bacteria. The Michigan 
agriculture commissioner agrees warning labels on unpasteurized cider 
are a good idea, but the state is taking steps to make sure all cider 
is safe. We have enforcement capabilities to shut an operation down 
immediately, and we'll do that if we find a pathogen problem. The 
best advice is to keep unpasteurized cider refrigerated at all times, 
so that you can safely enjoy this sweet rite of fall. Ed Garsten,
