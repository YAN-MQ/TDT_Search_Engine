The Federal budget agreement reached on Thursday includes a grant 
of $9.8 million to the National Park Service for moving the Cape Hatteras 
Lighthouse from the shoreline of North Carolina's Outer Banks to a 
point 1,600 feet from the sea, Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina 
announced Friday. The National Park Service has maintained for years 
that the spiral-striped landmark, the nation's tallest lighthouse, 
at 208 feet, is threatened by erosion from the encroaching sea. But 
the move has been vigorously opposed by residents of the Outer Banks 
who fear that the 128-year-old tower may crumble if engineers try 
to lift it in one piece with hydraulic jacks and then move it into 
the woods on rolling dollies. The opponents also contend that moving 
the lighthouse will destroy its heritage and character, diminishing 
its appeal as a tourist attraction. The proposed move became the subject 
of a political fight on Capitol Hill between Faircloth, a Republican 
who supports the move, and Rep. Walter Jones Jr., a Republican who 
represents the Outer Banks and who favors leaving the lighthouse where 
it is. Jones backed a less expensive plan to build up the beach in 
front of the lighthouse by constructing a new steel jetty. Environmentalists 
opposed that proposal as a violation of North Carolina's strict rules 
against the artificial renourishment of the beach with permanent structures. 
Faircloth said Friday that the budget agreement insured that ``this 
irreplaceable symbol of North Carolina will be preserved for future 
generations to enjoy.'' But John Hooper, a Buxton, N.C., motel owner 
who led a citizens group opposing the move, said he was disappointed 
and would explore legal options. Park Service officials said the move 
would be scheduled for the spring.
