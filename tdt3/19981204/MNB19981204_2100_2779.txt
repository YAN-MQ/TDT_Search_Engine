For a lot of shoppers, stereos and other electronic toys are turning 
out to be some of the holiday season's biggest bargains. All because 
the consumer market for the formerly high priced electronic goods 
has bottomed out in the economically troubled far east. We get more 
on this trend tonight from NBC's George Lewis. An unexpected effect 
of this economic boom -- a bargain bonanza for shoppers. Incredibly 
cheap prileses for all sorts of electronic gadgets. Today in New York 
you could get a V.C.R. for $89 and a stereo for $179. I would say 
a spent probably $50 to $100 less than I expected to. And in rant, 
you could buy a video disk player for $299 and a computer for $499. 
You can get quite a bit for your money. One reason for all the bargains 
-- the Asian economic crisis. Asian electronics companies trying to 
unload their goods in the U.S. at low prices because the bottom has 
dropped out of the consumer market in the far east. Alex Martinez 
manages the affordable portables store in Pasadena, california. The 
problems in Japan and Asia. You know, the cost to the retailer to 
purchase is less and we pass on the savings to the consumer. Another 
reason for the low prices is that electronic components such as microchips 
keep getting more powerful and cheaper, as they're produced in greater 
quantities. Visioneer is a company that makes scanners for personal 
computers. Two years ago a scanner that I sold for dollars 1,000 was 
slower and -- $1,000 was slower and probably had worst color today 
that I sell for $100. Electroc retailers here are thriving. They're 
all showing -- just today circuit city had a very strong, you know, 
sales number for November, best buy had very strong numbers as well. 
While economists worry about whether the Asian crisis will drag down 
the U.S. economy in the long-term, those concerns seem pretty remote 
to consumers who are rushing to grab the latest, greatest electronic 
gadgets. George Lewis, NBC news, Glendale, California.
