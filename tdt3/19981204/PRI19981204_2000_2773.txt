For some other surprising Christmas friends this year, we turn now 
to The World's Clark Boyd. Teletubbies, Furbies, and Lasers. Yes, 
it is time for the seasonal scramble for the year's hottest toys. 
But in Britain, police are warning, buyer beware. It seems that not 
every singe Beanie Baby or Barbie on the shelf this year is real. 
Darrin Cousins, who works for Britain's National Criminal Intelligence 
Service says the fraudulent toy trade is in full gear. When it comes 
to counterfeiting on a global scale, the market is measured in the 
billions of dollars. There is a right time, there is a good market 
for counterfeited products and the counterfeiters are well aware of 
this. And we are seeing products that are perhaps originated in Asia 
coming through Europe and into the United Kingdom for sale. Cousins 
says that the fake toys are potentially dangerous. Because they are 
made of inferior materials.
