The editor of a pro-government newspaper has been released after spending 
45 days in prison without trial for publishing a story accusing the 
Togolese army of inciting insecurity. Apollinaire Mewenemesse, editor 
of the weekly ``La Depeche,'' was freed on Thursday from the Lome 
city prison. He was arrested on October 21 after his magazine published 
a story accusing elements in the military of being behind alleged 
border attacks earlier this year. Since his imprisonment, international 
human rights groups had lobbied to secure Mewenemesse's freedom. Scattered 
protests by opposition groups have followed the reinstatement of President 
Gnassigbe Eyadema following June elections in which vote-counting 
was interrupted prematurely. Eyadema, who is accused of ordering a 
number of summary detentions and killings, has led this tiny French-speaking 
nation for 31 years since taking over in a coup that resulted in the 
death of his predecessor.
