More than 10,000 Bosnian Muslims rallied in four cities Friday to 
demand that international arbitrators grant a key disputed city to 
Muslim authorities. Emotional protesters jammed traffic in Sarajevo 
and Tuzla and claimed high turnouts in the towns of Zenica and Bihac 
as they called on international authorities to return the northern 
port town of Brcko to its pre-war status as a Muslim-dominated area. 
Arbitrators say they'll decide in the next few weeks the fate of Brcko, 
which is currently supervised by American Robert Farrand and claimed 
by both Muslims and Bosnian Serbs. The decision has already been delayed 
three times as arbitrators fear upsetting Bosnia's uneasy peace. During 
Bosnia's 3 1/2 year war, Serb fighters drove out most Muslims from 
Brcko, 75 kilometers (45 miles) north of Sarajevo. The city is now 
predominantly Serb although about 2,000 Muslims have returned since 
the war ended with the Dayton accords in 1995. Control of the town 
on the River Sava is the only territorial issue not settled by the 
accords. Both sides have threatened to resume fighting if control 
goes to the other. In Sarajevo Friday, Bosnia's Muslim member of the 
joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, joined the four-city protest 
dubbed ``Brcko to its citizens.'' Izetbegovic threatens to resign 
if Brcko is given to Serbs.
