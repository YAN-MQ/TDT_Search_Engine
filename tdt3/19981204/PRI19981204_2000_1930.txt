Nigeria has closed its borders in advance of Saturday's local elections. 
The polling marks the first crucial stage in returning the country 
to civilian rule. And as Barnaby Phillips reports, the military ruler, 
General Abubakar is appealing for a high turn out. General Abubukar 
said Nigerian politicians had to play the game by the rules. Politics 
in Nigeria is a notoriously corrupt process. And elections have invariably 
been marked by vote rigging and bribery. But Nigeria's military rulers 
know that, should these council elections pass off successfully, the 
whole transition to civilian rule will receive a huge boost. Nigeria's 
electorate is estimated at anywhere between 40 and 60 million people.
