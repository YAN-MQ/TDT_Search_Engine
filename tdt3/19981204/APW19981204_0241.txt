The husband of formfer Prime Minister Tansu Ciller was acquitted Friday 
in a retrial on charges which stemmed from a parliamentary probe of 
the family wealth. Earlier this year, Ozer Ciller had been found guilty 
of misuse of power for altering official papers, which documented 
the wealth and were submitted to a parliamentary commission, and sentenced 
to a symbolic fine of dlrs 8. In Friday's ruling, Judge Mustafa Batu 
said the allegations could not be proven. Mrs. Ciller, premier from 
1993-1996, and her husband have been dogged by corruption allegations 
since she came to power. She survived several parliamentary probes 
mostly with the help of her coalition allies of the time. The Cillers 
have always denied any wrongdoing and accuse rivals of plotting to 
ruin Mrs. Ciller's political career. The family reportedly own several 
million dollars' worth of assets both in Turkey and the United States, 
including a hotel, a shopping mall and a house. Two weeks ago, Mrs. 
Ciller again was cleared in a corruption probe, this time with the 
help of a rival center-right party, in a gesture toward a possible 
coalition alliance. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit is trying to put 
together a government that would include Mrs. Ciller's True Path party. 
The retrial was ordered by an appeals court which had doubts that 
a crime had been committed.
