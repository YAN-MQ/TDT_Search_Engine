A former spokesman for Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was sentenced 
Friday to seven years in prison for homicide and drunken and reckless 
driving. Thami Ntenteni, who had been out on bail, was immediately 
taken into custody. His lawyers said they would appeal the sentence, 
which stems from his killing one woman and seriously injuring three 
other people in a December 1997 car crash. Ntenteni had pleaded guilty 
September. At the time of the crash, he had been the spokesman for 
Mbeki, who will likely become South Africa's next president after 
the 1999 elections. Ntenteni has since been suspended from his job.
