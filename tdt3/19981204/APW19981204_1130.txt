After five grueling hours, Andrea Gaudenzi succumbed to the pain. 
His shoulder aching, his knee bloody, his white outfit caked with 
clay, Italy's top player grunted, grimaced and gutted it out deep 
into the fifth set Friday against Sweden's Magnus Norman in the opening 
match of the Davis Cup final. Seeing, though, that he could no longer 
swing the racket with his injured right shoulder, Gaudenzi retired 
from the match while serving at 6-6 in the deciding set. Officially, 
the score was 6-7 (9-11), 7-6 (7-0), 4-6, 6-3, 6-6 (30-0). Defending 
champion Sweden took a commanding 2-0 lead in the best-of-5 series 
when Magnus Gustafsson overpowered Italy's Davide Sanguinetti 6-1, 
6-4, 6-0 in the second singles match. Sweden can clinch its seventh 
Davis Cup title Saturday by winning the doubles. An initial diagnosis 
found a strained tendon, and Gaudenzi was ruled out of the rest of 
the competition _ a serious blow to Italy's hopes for its first title 
in 22 years. He had been scheduled to play doubles Saturday and another 
singles match Sunday. ``Right now I can not even lift a glass of water,'' 
Gaudenzi said after the match. ``I just could not hit the ball with 
proper power.'' The partisan sellout crowd of 12,000 at the Assago 
Forum gave the Italian a standing ovation when he conceded by tossing 
his racket across the clay court. It was a sudden end to a long, error-filled 
match. Norman _ at No. 52, the lowest ranked singles player among 
the teams' four players _ held a match point while serving at 5-4 
in the fifth set, but Gaudenzi eliminated it with a forehand winner 
down the line and later broke serve. Norman, clearly tiring at the 
end, totaled 82 unforced errors to 60 for Gaudenzi, who is ranked 
44th in the world. It is the first Davis Cup final in the event's 
99 years that does not have any singles players from the top 30. Gaudenzi 
had not played a match since helping Italy upset the United States 
in the Davis Cup semifinals in September, and had surgery on the shoulder 
in October. ``I was bothered by light pain during practice this week,'' 
he said, ``but I decided to play because it was a Davis Cup final 
in Italy.'' As expected, the crowd was raucous. They urged Gaudenzi 
on with soccer-style ``Ole'' chants, yelled ``Idiot, idiot'' at Norman 
when he contested calls on a few occasions, and often interrupted 
the run of play by clapping, shouting or blaring air horns. Gaudenzi, 
a former world junior No. 1 who excels in the charged atmosphere of 
the Davis Cup, started showing signs of trouble in the third game 
of the third set. He clutched his right arm after sending a backhand 
into the net, and headed to the locker room during the ensuing changeover. 
``I felt pain in the middle of the second set and it became bad in 
the middle of the third,'' Gaudenzi said. ``I could not hit the ball 
the right way.'' A trainer massaged the shoulder before the closing 
set, and again during the final changeover. Gaudenzi hit two weak 
serves that Norman ripped for winners in the 13th game, then quit 
after 4 hours, 56 minutes. ``I was for sure more prepared than he 
was physically,'' said Norman, who underwent heart surgery a year 
ago. ``I feel very sad for Andrea, but I think I deserve to win because 
I was fighting.'' With Gaudenzi out, Sanguinetti will be pressed into 
partnering doubles specialist Diego Nargiso for the first time, Italy's 
non-playing captain Paolo Bertolucci said. ``We don't need just one 
miracle,'' a resigned Bertolucci said, ``we need several.''
