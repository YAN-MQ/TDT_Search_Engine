There are huge new figures out tonight on the American economy -- 
specifically employment. Why the numbers are so good when the news 
has been so bad. It now appears to be open warfare between the White 
House and the hill. Could it be that the house Judiciary committee 
just has a very strong case? Is that why the White House is launching 
such a strong effort? He's the best mayor New York has seen in decades. 
He can't run for mayor again so what will Rudy Giuliani run for next? 
The story in the Sunday "New York Times." And what is driving the 
prices down on just about everything with bells and whistles on it? 
Good Friday evening to you. There is breaking news from the White 
House on the impeachment front. We'll have it in a moment. Also tonight, 
a look at the Sunday "New York Times" and the Saturday newspaper headlines 
from around the country.
