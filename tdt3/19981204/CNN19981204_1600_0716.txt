We'll be right back to check our top stories and Wall Street's progress 
today, and kids in L.A. learn about art and life off the streets. 
Let me tell you about the BEST traffic report in town... brought to 
you by qxrt's barb and Bill it's a scorcher out there, and I hope 
none of you are trying to get anywhere soon. From up here, it looks 
like a little backup heading downtown... these guys have the ultimate 
view. ...this is barb and Bill, the qxrt traffic team, signing out. 
Once again, our explorer saves the day. Yeah, glad we're not down 
in that mess. And just think of the money they saved on a helicopter. 
The new Ford explorer. Now for "diskette world" travel news -- notebook 
computers are traveling lighter with built-in superdisk drives. Only 
the superdisk drive works with both regular floppies and 120-megabyte 
superdisk diskettes. Floppies everywhere are thrilled because a built-in 
superdisk is two drives in one, and other drives 9999are on the way 
out. We can save a little. superdisk can save a lot. Together, we 
can save the world. Get it in Hewlett Packard notebooks.
