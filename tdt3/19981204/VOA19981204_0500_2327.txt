At least 100 lawyers gathered outside a Malaysian courthouse Friday 
to protest a contempt of court sentence given to a lawyer defending 
former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. Dressed in black suits, 
the lawyers chanted, "We want justice," as they milled around the 
court of appeals in Kuala Lumpur. Inside, the court granted a request 
of -- by attorney Zinar Zacharia that the suspension of his three-month 
sentence be extended until the court can take up the appeal. The high 
court judge presiding in the Anwar Ibrahim case ordered Mr. Zinar 
jailed on Monday after he refused to apologize for filing an affidavit 
seeking the dismissal of two prosecutors for allegedly manufacturing 
evidence. At the Anwar trial Friday, the day was spent questioning 
a former driver about his accusation that he and Mr. Anwar engaged 
in a sex act five years ago. Questioning from both the prosecution 
and defense centered around why it took Azizan Abu Bakar so long to 
make the allegations. Mr. Anwar was arrested September 20th on charges 
of corruption and illegal sex acts. He says the charges are politically 
motivated.
