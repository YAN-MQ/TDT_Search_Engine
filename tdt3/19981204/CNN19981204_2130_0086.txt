President Clinton's lawyers may be planning an elaborate and lengthy 
defense at the house impeachment inquiry. They have asked the Judiciary 
committee for three or four days to call witnesses. The attorneys 
are scheduled to appear before the committee Tuesday. In a letter 
to the chief republican counsel, they indicate they want to introduce 
testimony on the standards for impeachment and for prosecuting perjury 
and obstruction of justice, as well as prosecutorial misconduct. That 
would require the committee to adjust its plans to vote on articles 
of impeachment by next weekend. Committee chairman Henry Hyde says 
republicans will not be intimidated by rhetoric or name-calling from 
the White House. Presidential press secretary Joe Lockhart today called 
the behavior of GOP committee members "chaotic, partisan and irresponsible."
