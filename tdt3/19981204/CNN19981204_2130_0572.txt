NAto has approved the deployment of a rapid-reaction extradition force 
to kosovo. It says the force of about 1,800 men will be stationed 
in Macedonia in case they're needed to rescue international observers 
from Kosovo. 12 people have reportedly been killed in Kosovo in the 
last 24 hours. U.S. diplomat William Walker visited NATO headquarters 
in Brussels today. He says the new violence is threatening the shaky 
cease-fire between serbians and Albanians.
