Government investigators plan to question former President Suharto 
next week over corruption allegations and could place him under house 
arrest, officials said Friday. ``We will question the former president 
at the Attorney General's Office,'' the official Antara news agency 
quoted Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib as saying. Antara said 
Ghalib did not specify the date of the questioning but stressed the 
investigation into Suharto's wealth would be based on a presumption 
of innocence. Meanwhile, State Secretary Akbar Tanjung repeated an 
earlier warning that officials might place Suharto under house arrest 
if he does not cooperate with the investigation. On Thursday, President 
B.J. Habibie ordered Ghalib to question his predecessor, Suharto, 
immediately over claims that the old leader abused his power and acted 
corruptly to amass a fortune for himself, his family and a clique 
of cronies during his 32 years in power. Suharto, who quit after riots 
and protests in May, has denied any wrongdoing. He has stated that 
he will cooperate with any inquiry. However, Akbar said the attorney 
general has the authority to place Suharto under house arrest. Ghalib 
has questioned Suharto before. But an earlier investigation failed 
to find any evidence. Critics have accused Ghalib, a serving army 
general, of going soft on Suharto, and had criticized the investigation 
as a whitewash. Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth 
at dlrs 4 billion. Others say the figure is higher. Student protesters 
have taken to the streets almost daily demanding that Suharto be tried. 
Habibie, meanwhile, abandoned plans for an independent corruption 
inquiry of Suharto. The government had trouble finding public figures 
who were willing to join the panel, which was viewed as only a cosmetic 
gesture to appease student activists.
