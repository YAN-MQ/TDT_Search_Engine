The space shuttle "endeavour" is safely in orbit after what NASA calls 
a "Just about perfect" launch. We have main engine start. Four, three, 
two, one. We have booster ignition and liftoff. The sky lit up for 
hundreds of miles early this morning when "endeavour" lifted off carrying 
an American-built section of the international space station. Sunday, 
the shuttle's crew of six will attach a 12-ton connecting passageway 
called unity to the Russian zarya Module launched two weeks ago. NASA 
says if all goes well with the space station, humans could eventually 
replace robots as explorers on Mars. The robots are going to be the 
pilot pigeons. We have robots going to Mars December 10th and January 
3rd scouting out places for people to land. They're understanding 
about the weather. They're searching for places where life might be. 
But in the end, it's going to take the brilliance and the dexterity, 
flexibility and adaptability of people to make it happen. "Endeavour" 
astronauts will conduct three space walks on this mission. 159 more 
will be required to build and maintain the space station.
