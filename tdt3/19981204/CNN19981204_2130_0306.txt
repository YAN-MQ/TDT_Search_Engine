Two politicians who have their eyes on the oval office are gearing 
up for the 2000 presidential election. Today, advisers for republican 
senator John Ashcroft of Missouri told CNN he will announce his candidacy 
on January 5th. Ashcroft has asked his advisers to begin establishing 
a fund-raising committee. And on the democratic side, former senator 
and basketball star Bill Bradley of New Jersey says he's testing the 
waters for a presidential nomination from his party. Bradley is officially 
forming an exploratory committee. He has been away from politics for 
a couple of years, but says he's now at the top of his game. I have 
had a great two years, been regenerated. When I left, I said I thought 
that the U.S. Senate was the best selective job in the world and I 
thought it was. But I wanted to leave to do some things that I couldn't 
do if I was in the senate. And I have left and I have done those things 
and I feel very good and very strong. Bradley is not the first to 
form an exploratory committee. Democratic senator Paul Wellstone of 
Minnesota did so last spring. Democratic senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, 
John Kerry of Massachusetts and house minority leader Dick Gephardt 
of Missouri are also considering presidential bids. Talk in republican 
ranks so far has focused on Texas governor George W. bush.
