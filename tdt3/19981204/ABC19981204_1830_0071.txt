Good evening. We begin tonight with an economy so strong that even 
with the Negative impact of the Asian crisis here, more jobs are being 
created than there are workers to fill them. 267,000 new jobs were 
created last month. And the unemployment rate, at 4.4%, is about as 
low as it has been in 28 years. This is really a story of two domestic 
economies. Because while some of the big manufacturers -- Boeing comes 
to mind this week -- are having to cut back, the rest of the economy 
is just barreling along. So first, here is ABC's Betsy Stark. This 
is Brenda, how can I help you? Today's employment report is powerful 
proof that the U.S. economy is now dominated by an enormous sector 
called the service industry, including everything from health care 
to home building. Retailers added 65,000 workers last month in preparation 
for the holiday onslaught. And even so, jobs continue to go unfilled. 
It's been one of the toughest things we've had to do this season, 
find good help, qualified people. Service businesses need lots of 
office workers, and employers hired tens of thousands of them in November 
-- accountants, computer and data processing technicians, temporary 
workers, engineers, customer service reps -- all were in demand in 
industries ranging from health care and education to technology and 
transportation. Demand for professional workers is so high, unemployment 
among college graduates is virtually nonexistent, just 1.9%. outside 
the service industry, the boom in construction hiring continued. Builders 
hired 47,000 new workers last month. In Atlanta, they would have hired 
more if they could find them. There are so many jobs available, that 
if a certain worker doesn't work out with our company, he can go down 
the street and get a job with somebody else, probably the same day. 
It's still a tough job market for Americans working for companies 
that do a lot of business overseas. But in service industries, the 
customers are often local, and right now, those customers have money 
to spend. Betsy Stark, ABC News, New York. The ramifications of unemployment 
near a 28-year low.
