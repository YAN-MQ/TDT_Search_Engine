One place you might not expect to find a good wine cellar is high 
in the sky. But as Carolyn O'Neil explains in this edition of "working 
ahead," many airlines are trying to change that. Business travel and 
drinking wine often go hand in hand. There's definitely a higher rate 
of wine consumption among frequent fliers and the business travelers 
in particular. I actually enjoyed a nice merlot for most of the trip. 
"business traveler international" magazine's annual "cellars in the 
sky" contest rates airline business class wines. We ask them to submit 
two red wines, two white wines and a sparkling wine. And then we have 
some of the top judges in the New York area come and do a Blind tasting. 
For the first time this year, "Forbes" judged wine lists in the sky. 
Although international airlines won more awards in both contests, 
domestic carriers are improving their first and business class wine 
programs. Delta's "vinum" emphasizes passenger education, and earned 
"Forbes'" best wine list honor. American airlines debuted "vineyards 
in the sky," winning a top cellar award from business traveler international. 
And remember, even if you're sitting in coach, where wine service 
amounts to a screw-top bottle, you can get a better glass of wine. 
Just ask your flight attendant, if time permits after beverage service, 
if you could purchase a glass of wine from first or business class. 
But many airlines say they're upgrading wines in coach, so no matter 
where you sit, you can savor a fine wine. Carolyn O'Neil, CNN, Atlanta.
