Heavy fog forced officials to cancel the men's World Cup downhill 
ski race in Whistler, British Columbia on Friday. Organizers are hoping 
to hold the race on Saturday. The venue has been plagued with weather 
problems. The event was cancelled the last two years due to weather. 
The race was originally scheduled for Saturday but fears of deteriorating 
weather conditions prompted officials to take the unprecedented step 
of moving it ahead one day to Friday. Rescheduling the race to Friday 
cost organizers dlrs 100,000 in television revenues, but organizers 
balanced the revenue loss against persistent suggestions FIS would 
relocate the race next season if it was cancelled for the third consecutive 
year.
