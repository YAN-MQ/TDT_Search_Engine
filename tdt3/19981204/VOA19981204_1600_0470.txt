UN Secretary General Kofi Annan says that he hopes his visit to Libya 
tomorrow will end the standoff over the trial of two suspects in a 
terrorist bombing 10 years ago of Pan-Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, but Libyan officials are downplaying his prospects for an 
immediate agreement. Scott Bob sets the scene. The UN Secretary General 
told reporters in Tunis Friday that it is time to end the Lockerbie 
trial issue, and said that he hopes to settle it during his visit 
to Libya, Saturday. Mr. Annan said the technical work has been completed 
by Libyan and United Nation's legal teams, and he hopes to conclude 
the case during a meeting with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Mr. 
Annan requested permission Wednesday from a special UN commission 
to break the ban on air travel to Libya for the visit. The air travel 
ban was imposed when Libya refused to hand over two Libyan citizens 
accused of planting the bomb that exploded on a Pan-Am passenger plane 
over Lockerbie, killing 270 people. However, the Libyan news agency, 
Jana, Friday issued a report downplaying the reports quoting the UN 
officials as saying an agreement was imminent. The news agency said 
that Colonel Gaddafi does not have the power to sign any accord with 
Mr. Annan, and such an agreement must be approved by the Libyan Peoples 
Commission on International Relations. Libya for years refused to 
surrender the two suspects, saying that it did not believe that they 
would receive a fair trial in Britain or the United States, which 
have jurisdiction in the case, however it did agree earlier this year 
to allow them to be tried in the Netherlands, a neutral country, but 
it is held back saying it needed certain assurances. The U.S. and 
British governments have said that there should be no preconditions 
to the hand-over of the suspects. The Secretary General's visit to 
Libya was announced at the end of a week long trip to North Africa, 
aimed at ending another long standing issue, the dispute over the 
Western Sahara. Mr. Annan says that he has obtained approval from 
Polasario guerrillas seeking independence for the former Spanish colony, 
to hold a referendum, however he says Morroco, which claims the territory 
on historical grounds, still has concerns that need to be resolved.
