Two days of heavy rain across northern Sardinia shut down road and 
rail routes Friday. At least two people died. A 28-year-old student 
was killed in a car crash, and a 35-year-old worker slipped off scaffolding 
and died in a hospital. Both accidents occurred Thursday near Cagliari. 
The Olbia-Chilivani railway, on the northeastern part of the island, 
was closed Friday by flooding. Officials said it won't reopen until 
Sunday. The Nuoro-Ortisei highway was closed to traffic after a car 
ran off a road and into a stream below, the ANSA news agency reported. 
The floods swept away trees, along with 1,500 tons of cork that had 
been piled up by factories in the area. Cork represents one of Sardinia's 
main resources and authorities said the damage could amount to dlrs 
5.9 million. Bad weather hit up and down the country. Downtown Venice 
and St. Mark's Square were flooded by high water, which was 113 centimeters 
(45 inches) above average sea level. In Quindici, the southern city 
hit by massive mudslide last May, officials were on the alert after 
hours of heavy rain. Forecasters said there was no end in sight to 
the bad weather.
