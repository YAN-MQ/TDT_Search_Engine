Down to the final weekend of regular season college football, and 
berths in the fiesta bowl are anything but set. In the driver's seat 
tomorrow will be Tennessee and Mississippi state. Regardless of what 
happens in this particular game, as a coach you have to be very, very 
proud of this team going undefeated in the regular season, and now 
it's just where can you take it next? Also eyeing spots are Kansas 
state among other rs. Cindy Beaumont, "Headline Sports."
