The Nantucket, Massachusetts, health inspector has begun eviction 
proceedings against a man who lives underground. For the past ten 
years, Thomas Johnson has been living in a three-room home he built 
eight feet under a boy scout campground. Authorities say the 136 square-foot 
structure has numerous code violations. Johnson claims to have underground 
homes in Colorado, Pennsylvania, and in the Catskill mountains in 
New York.
