My color has come into its season: gray is the new black, as you've 
no doubt heard, decreed by the panjandrums of fashion. This fall, 
the least attention-seeking, in many ways the saddest, color has become 
the toast of Seventh Avenue. It's everywhere, from the pages of fashion 
magazines to the clothing racks at Saks or the Gap. But I have my 
doubts. I don't believe gray was cut out for stardom. I have been 
a fan of gray as long as I can remember. To me, it always meant fall, 
northern skies, rain, ash and smoke _ classicism. Gray is the final 
resting place of color itself, tired of the extremities of orange 
and the ferociousness of black. My choice did not go over big in the 
old neighborhood, in Buffalo, N.Y. It was the equivalent of saying 
your favorite band was Air Supply or your favorite pastime was collecting 
butterflies. Among my rowdy Irish-Catholic friends, choosing any color 
other than green bordered on reckless foolishness. You might get away 
with silver _ at least silver was a football color (the Raiders). 
But gray was for the old, the rich and the neutral, which no one who 
is 17 wants to be. The expression ``gray matter'' only emphasized 
its nerd associations. So did those Grey Poupon commercials, which 
imprinted the hue with snob appeal in the character of a Rolls-Royce-driving 
sandwich-eater. After those commercials hit the air, when I was in 
my teens, I convinced myself that gray was not my color. When girls 
I'd met asked the getting-to-know-you questions, I fibbed. Sign? ``Cancer.'' 
Movie? `` `The Searchers.''' Football team? ``The Bills, of course.'' 
All true. But then, color? ``Um, blue.'' They would say, ``Oh, yeah, 
it's the color of your eyes,'' and leave it at that. I liked blue, 
but I was hiding behind it. Blue was socially acceptable. I had one 
moment of naked courage when I became the editor of my school literary 
magazine, The Juvenalist. It had been revived after years of neglect, 
and I did the assigning, the editing, the typesetting and some of 
the writing. When my staff asked what color the cover was going to 
be, I didn't hesitate. ``Gray!'' I decreed, drunk on power. They looked 
at me as if I had just landed from Mars. The faculty adviser overruled 
me, and The Juvenalist arrived in jackets of Kelly green, the school 
color. As a Northern kid, I read Faulkner and the rest of the Southern 
writers and beheld them gorging on the South's colors _ the grotesquely 
colorful vegetation, the drama of Southern skies. I began to ask myself, 
what is the North's signature color? In winter, Buffalo becomes deeply 
acquainted with gray; I grew to know its infinite shadings like no 
other. There were slate-gray skies heavy and black-edged with approaching 
snow. There was the luminous gray of cloudy mornings after a snowfall, 
when the light would bounce between the sky and the earth, sharply 
etching the details of everything in between. Most of all, there was 
the very clear pearl gray of early fall evenings, when the air acquires 
its first hard snap. Another major factor in my obsession with gray 
is my hair. The first gray appeared beneath my wheat-brown mop when 
I was still in my early 20s. Judging from my father, I knew I would 
be fully gray by my late 30s. When people first asked what was causing 
me to turn prematurely gray, I would sigh, ``Women.'' In fact, I couldn't 
wait to be fully gray. My body was catching up to my taste. Now, fashion 
has, too. Forty years after gray became stigmatized as the color of 
dull conformity, in the person of the Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, 
it has returned. It has won over its rival in the competition to be 
fashion's uniform _ namely, black. Gray is a more nuanced expression 
of that which black states absolutely. Black is grief; gray is the 
sadness that comes afterward. Black is impenetrable; gray has depths. 
Black is definitive; gray (as in gray areas) eludes finality. This 
season, gray has conquered black, the biggest upset since Earth Shoes 
replaced ... whatever it was Earth Shoes replaced. Why did gray overtake 
black now? I asked an expert. ``When you want to reintroduce color, 
as designers are doing now, you need a neutral base,'' explained Sally 
Singer, the fashion director at New York magazine. ``And there's been 
a move away from the hard perfection to the early '90s, the Gucci 
all-black silhouette, which seemed too strident and obvious. I think 
people were in the mood to be imperfect. Gray has the seductiveness 
of someone coming undone.'' It all sounded good, but I don't believe 
New York can be faithful to gray, a color whose motto might be, ``What 
are you getting all emotional about?'' Already, the next color (khaki, 
I hear) is on the style horizon. Gray is merely a moment of silence 
in fashion's ceaseless chatter. Next spring, when gray recedes to 
become once more the color of tweedy blazers worn by history professors 
and the hue of Buffalo skies, I won't be sad; that's where it belongs. 
Gray teaches you to live with good-byes.
