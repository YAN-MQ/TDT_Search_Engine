Less threatening to children, but equally threatening to the Yuletide 
spirit, is a new policy at a Dutch Bank. Spokesman, Sager Pinanberg 
says Robbobanc will no longer send Christmas cards to everyone south 
of the North Pole. The circuit of sending Christmas cards in Holland 
and I mean the circuit between companies have reached a point at our 
bank says this is ridiculous. We are sending cards to people we do 
not know because we get cards from people we do not know. Let us make 
an end to this. Robbobanc sent out more than 600,000 cards last year. 
This year, it is urging its employees to send greetings by phone. 
No word yet on who is going to pay the December phone bill.
