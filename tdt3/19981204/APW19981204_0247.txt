The Russian ruble tumbled again Friday, trading at about 20 to the 
U.S. dollar and threatening to hit its lowest point since the country's 
economic crisis struck in August. The ruble's latest slide is an ominous 
sign for the government, which desperately wants to stabilize the 
economy as Russia heads into the difficult winter months. With President 
Boris Yeltsin hospitalized, and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov still 
struggling to implement a recovery plan, the economy continues to 
founder and remains vulnerable to additional shocks. The government 
is urgently seeking foreign help, but International Monetary Fund 
chief Michel Camdessus came and left this week without giving any 
signal that a frozen loan package will be released soon. With the 
country's financial markets essentially wiped out by the economic 
crisis, the value of the ruble is one of the leading indicators of 
economic confidence, and it is again on the decline. After stabilizing 
temporarily at about 16 to the dollar, it has been falling in recent 
days. The rate set by the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange was 19.6 
on Friday, and in street trading it took more than 20 rubles to purchase 
one U.S. dollar. The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after 
the country's economic crisis hit in August, then made a modest comeback. 
The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis. Meanwhile, 
the government announced that inflation has gone up more than 65 percent 
so far this year and is expected to top 70 percent by year's end. 
Russian inflation had been coming down after years of soaring prices 
and was expected to be in single digits this year until the country's 
economic crisis hit. If the government does not receive foreign assistance 
soon, it is expected to start printing more rubles to pay off millions 
of workers and pensioners who haven't received their money for months. 
But the additional money is almost certain to push inflation higher 
and would risk bringing back the hyperinflation that Russia suffered 
during the early 1990s. Russia's problems could get worse next year 
when its dlrs 17.5 billion dollar foreign debt falls due. Several 
officials have already said the country won't be able to meet these 
payments and have called for creditors to set new terms for payment.
