A busy off season for the Mets became even busier Friday when they 
traded right-handed pitcher Willie Blair to the Detroit Tigers for 
utility infielder Joe Randa. And apparently, Mets General Manager 
Steve Phillips would like to keep on dealing. ``This freed up some 
money for us,'' Phillips said of trading Blair, who is scheduled to 
make $7.75 million over the next two years. ``It at least gives us 
more flexibility.'' With some of the savings, Phillips would apparently 
like to sign free-agent outfielder Rickey Henderson, which could happen 
next week. Meanwhile, Phillips admitted Friday that he had spoken 
with Toronto General Manager Gord Ash about possibly obtaining Roger 
Clemens, who has told the Blue Jays he wants to be traded to a contender. 
``We wanted to know if New York, the National League and the Mets 
were even a possibility for him,'' Phillips said of his conversation 
with Ash. ``In my conversation with Gord, I tried to get a feel for 
it. And they're not going to let this thing drag out.'' But even though 
the Mets are interested, Phillips did not sound as though he thought 
he had a good chance at landing Clemens. ``I'm not sure how strong 
a player we are in this,'' Phillips said. ``I'm not sure we have everything 
they're looking for. But it's worth considering.'' The reasons are 
obvious. With Clemens leading what is now a decent starting staff 
that consists of Al Leiter, Rick Reed, Bobby Jones, Masato Yoshii 
and Hideo Nomo, the Mets would enhance their chances of getting to 
the post-season for the first time in a decade. So even though Phillips 
is trying to trim his budget after signing Leiter, Mike Piazza and 
Robin Ventura to lucrative deals, Clemens would be an exception. ``This 
is a unique situation, one that ownership tends to be very open in 
consideration of,'' Phillips said. The problem is a match. Phillips 
said that as last season was winding down, he evaluated what Toronto 
was looking for. ``And I have thought Toronto's needs were similar 
to ours,'' Phillips said. ``And that is why it is tough to match up.'' 
Even if the Mets lose out on Clemens, they have significantly reduced 
their needs this off-season. The one glaring missing piece is a leadoff 
hitter. And Henderson would fill that need, even if he is not the 
hitter he used to be. By trading Blair, Phillips made the first of 
what might be several modest moves to reduce the Mets' payroll. The 
Mets are believed to be shopping Greg McMichael (possibly to Seattle) 
and Butch Huskey (possibly to Milwaukee). And Phillips said Friday 
that two or three teams are interested in Randa. McMichael will make 
$1.8 million next season. Both Huskey and Randa are eligible for arbitration. 
Randa, 29, who could give the Mets a right-handed bat off the bench 
if he is not dealt again, hit .254 with 9 home runs and 50 runs batted 
in for the Tigers last season, one year after batting .302 for Pittsburgh. 
Blair, who will turn 33 on Dec. 18, went 5-16 for the Arizona Diamondbacks 
and the Mets, one year after going 16-8 for the Tigers. He did turn 
in strong performances in his only two starts for the Mets, losing 
by 2-0 to the Cardinals (while allowing Mark McGwire's 50th homer) 
and defeating the Expos, 1-0, to keep the Mets alive in the wild-card 
race. ``Willie was glad to go somewhere he knows he's part of the 
rotation,'' Phillips said of Blair, who has pitched for eight major 
league teams in his nine-year career.
