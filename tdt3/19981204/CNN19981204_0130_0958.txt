Light trucks are quickly becoming the fastest selling things on wheels 
even surpassing car sales last month. Rusty Dornin has details. Cain 
butera is taking a test drive. When butera hits the road, he'd rather 
do it behind the wheel of a truck. I just got used to driving up high. 
I think it looks better than a car, or drives better than a car. You 
know, once you start driving these, to go back to a car is different. 
Butera is among a growing number of U.S. drivers saying they'd rather 
drive a truck -- a light truck that is. Last month sales of light 
trucks outsold cars for the first time ever. Light trucks include 
pickup trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles. That's no surprise 
to many car dealers who say they can't keep SUVs and minivans on the 
lot. They like to drive to work, or on the weekends, take the kids 
to the soccer game, play football. Then when they do that, they're 
able to get the whole family and the equipment into the vehicle. Everyone 
is trying to get everyone into one vehicle. That's the bottom line. 
a decade ago, the gas-guzzling SUVs might not have appealed to consumers. 
10, 15 years ago, they were looking for fuel economy. Now, they are 
looking for performance. Performance -- and for many families in the 
'90s, it's just a Matter of where to put all that stuff. We do a lot 
of skiing. We're an athletic family. So it's easy to throw everything 
in there -- the skis, convenience and the safety factor, too. The 
safety factor -- the desire to put a little more car between you and 
the next guy. They want something that's a little bigger nowadays 
because they feel safer in the vehicle. Light trucks may be America's 
sweetheart now, but it's only one month sales figures -- too soon 
to predict an end to America's love affair with the car. Rusty Dornin, 
CNN, San Francisco.
