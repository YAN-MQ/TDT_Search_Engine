The United Nation's refugee agency, the UNHCR, says refusing to go 
back to their homes because of what they call the intimidating presence 
of Serbian police. Lisa Schlein, in Geneva, has details. For the most 
part international efforts have been successful to get Kosovo's ethnic 
Albanian to return home. UNHCR spokesman Yanovski says people keep 
trickling back to damaged homes and villages in central or western 
Kosovo, but he says that the town of Molishavo is an exception. Mr. 
Yanovski says that town remains empty. He says the 3000 people who 
were forced to flee in July refuse to go back because of the heavy 
Serbian police and military presence there. We have been trying together 
with the Kosovo diplomatic mission to help the situation, pressing 
the government to reduce the police presence which is intimidating 
to people and preventing them from going back. There are a number 
of the straw houses in Molishavo, but there are also a number which 
are standing, and people could go back if they were not afraid of 
the police presence.
