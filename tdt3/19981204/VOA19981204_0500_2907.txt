The high-technology industry made Bill Gates, the co-founder and chief 
executive officer of Microsoft, the richest man in the world. He's 
worth an estimated $60 billion. This week, Mr. Gates and his wife 
announced a gift of $100 million to speed the delivery of vaccines 
to developing countries. Specifically, the money will be used to find 
ways to protect children from respiratory, intestinal, and liver diseases. 
Gordon Perkins of the Program for Appropriate Technology and Health, 
a Seattle, Washington, non-profit organization, told "USA Today" newspaper 
that this is the largest infusion of private funds into vaccines ever. 
Bill Gates says that he eventually plans to give away about 95 percent 
of his fortune. I'm Dan Nobel.
