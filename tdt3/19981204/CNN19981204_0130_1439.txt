"Babe" may be this year's pig in the city, but there's a much bigger 
animal turning heads in Suffolk county, long island. For Jeanne Moos, 
there's no ducking this story. Take a gander if you ever drive through 
flanders, long island. It sits like a duck out of water. Quack, quack. 
You know you're almost there when you see brake lights up ahead. Is 
it a two-story duck, or a one-story duck? Well, I would say a one-story 
duck. Big duck. We have duck carols that we'll be singing as we do 
every year. Every year when they deck the duck for Christmas. 3, 2, 
1 -- I'm dreaming of a white big duck The dream became reality back 
in 1931, when the owner of this duck farm had a brainstorm inspired 
by a California restaurant. They were in a coffee shop that was shaped 
like a coffeepot. Thus was hatched the big duck. Watch your head. 
Duck! OK, so it's not exactly anatomically correct. How many ducks 
have an air conditioner on their backside, not to mention tail lights 
supposedly from a model-T for eyes? The big duck was in private hands 
for years until Suffolk county historian lance mallamo floated the 
idea of acquiring it. The county executive's office called me like, 
"what is this all about? We're preserving a duck now? This is crazy." 
An hour later, they called me back, "get that duck." Now, you can 
get everything duck from ties to postcards to mugs to rubber duckies. 
How bout big duck shorts? Are you that kind of guy? Sorry, the big 
duck umbrella is no longer in stock. The big duck has even inspired 
a technical term, duck architecture, meaning any building with a sculptural 
form representing its function. There are plenty of examples on the 
walls. This hot dog is an example of duck architecture? Right. They've 
had to move and refurbish the big duck. One made of wire and cement, 
cement it's the little Saint Nick What does a duck do? What noise 
does it make? Quack. Quack. Quack, quack. Quack, quack. It's been 
said that the funniest words in the English language are "duck" and 
"pickle." Both of which you can eat. That's duck? Yeah. That is duck? 
Santa, duck. I feel sorry for all animals, but they do taste good. 
Nevertheless, it's in bad taste to ask "what's cooking?" When you're 
in the belly of the big duck. Jeanne Moos, CNN, flanders, New York.
