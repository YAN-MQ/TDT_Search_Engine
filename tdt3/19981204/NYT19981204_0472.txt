The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 5: The 
Clinton administration has been dodgy about its commitment to unseal 
diplomatic and intelligence documents that may directly connect Gen. 
Augusto Pinochet to crimes committed during his 17-year dictatorship 
over Chile. Washington must make public as much of this information 
as possible. Pinochet is in Britain, appealing extradition to Spain 
on charges of torture and international terrorism. Information that 
may bear on these charges is in the archives of the White House, the 
State, Defense and Justice departments, U.S. intelligence agencies 
and the Ford and Carter presidential libraries. U.S. involvement with 
the Pinochet dictatorship was close, and Washington kept detailed 
records. In the years before Pinochet seized power, the Nixon administration 
openly encouraged a coup against Chile's elected Socialist president, 
Salvador Allende, and assisted in destabilizing the Allende government 
with economic pressures. After the coup, in 1973, Washington embraced 
Pinochet as an anti-Communist ally and muffled criticism of his government's 
murderous repression. But later the United States became more outspoken, 
especially after the Justice Department established that the assassination 
of a prominent Chilean exile and a U.S. citizen in the streets of 
Washington had been ordered and planned by high Chilean officials. 
The United States has not been forthcoming in providing documents 
in its possession on abusive practices of foreign governments it has 
supported. It has moved at a glacial pace in declassifying material 
requested by Honduras and Guatemala. In the case of Pinochet, it should 
move with alacrity and not hide behind technicalities. The United 
States can best make amends for its past mistakes and help Chile overcome 
the traumas of that era by disclosing all it knows about the crimes 
of the Pinochet dictatorship.
