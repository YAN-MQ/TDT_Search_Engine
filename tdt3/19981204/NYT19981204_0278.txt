NATIONAL FORECAST Saturday, December 5, 1998: After some of the highest 
readings ever measured in December Friday, the Northeast will be more 
seasonable today as high pressure builds eastward from central Quebec. 
The clockwise circulation around the fair weather system will draw 
cooler air from eastern Canada and the North Atlantic into New England. 
The leading edge of this ocean cooled air will push southwestward 
into the coastal Middle Atlantic States. Clouds and scattered showers 
will attend a weakening disturbance at 15,000 feet crossing the central 
Appalachians and this will temper the record warmth. A very mild air 
flow will continue from the Gulf of Mexico into the Plains and Mississippi 
Valley. More record maximums are likely in the Middle West and Ohio 
Valley, but clouds will limit the direct heating from the sun. Fog 
will be dense across the lower Mississippi Valley Saturday morning. 
Low pressure near Lake Superior will advance warmer air into Michigan 
while drawing colder air into the northern Plains. Intermittent light 
snow is expected from western Minnesota into the Dakotas and eastern 
Rockies. A second disturbance over western Kansas will produce heavier 
snow in parts of central Colorado with snow showers farther south. 
The interior West will be seasonably cold as clouds remain over northern 
sections and sunshine returns to the Southwest. High pressure moving 
through California will sponsor sunny skies and more pleasant conditions. 
A robust cold front entering the Northwest will cause a cold rain 
to spread down the coast with snow developing across the Cascades. 
Focus: Snow Levels Snow fell at elevations as low as 1,000 feet in 
the Cascades of Washington on Tuesday. Below this altitude, precipitation 
fell as rain. Almost all precipitation that falls over the middle 
latitudes begins as snow thousands of feet aloft. Even the splotches 
of rain that will fall over the unseasonably warm Middle Atlantic 
states Saturday will likely have a snowy start. The profile of temperature 
below the altitude where snowflakes form determines the type of precipitation 
that reaches the ground. On Tuesday, the melting level over western 
Washington was estimated to lie close to 1,000 feet.
