A government psychiatrist says the man accused of opening fire in 
the U.S. capitol building last summer is not mentally competent to 
stand trial. According to his parents, Russell Weston Jr. suffers 
from paranoid schizophrenia. He is charged with killing two capitol 
police officers in the July shooting. The government doctor says Weston 
cannot understand the nature of the charges against him or assist 
in his own defense. Dr. Johnson said that she found, as the court 
said, that Mr. Weston is presently incompetent to stand trial and 
cooperate with his attorneys. Do you agree with that? I don't have 
a comment about my viewpoint, that's just what Dr. johnsons report 
said. The incompetency finding is not binding on the court. A hearing 
will be held to determine whether Weston is fit to stand trial.
