Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Neftenyahu has tried to deflect American 
criticism of his conditions for implementing the Y River peace accord 
with the Palestinians. He told the U.S. Secretary of State Madeline 
Albright, he is not making new demands, but insisting on compliance 
with past commitments. The Palestinians reject Israel's conditions, 
and Washington says that the peace accord should be implemented as 
signed, but as Israeli Senior Advisor David Bar Elan says Yassir Arafat's 
plan to declare statehood is a profound violation of the Y agreement. 
What we are saying is that unless we are assured that there is no 
intention to our unilaterally a declare a state in May, then there 
are in breach of their agreement, the reciprocity is built in. If 
they do not adhere to their commitments, we are not going to withdraw, 
this is what it says in the Y agreement. Israeli Advisor, David Bar 
Elan.
