Still ahead -- children in danger. NBC news "in depth." When a holiday 
trip to the mall turns into a parent's nightmare. We were in the toy 
section and I went around to get the cart and back around to get Katie 
and she was gone in a matter of seconds. How stores are making sure 
your children are safe this holiday season. And the end of the line 
for a fugitive from death row. But authorities are still asking, how 
did he get out in the first place?
