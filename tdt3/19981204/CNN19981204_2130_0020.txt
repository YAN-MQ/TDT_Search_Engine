President Clinton says millions of people can work full time and still 
be living in poverty, so another minimum wage increase is in order. 
Citing conducive economic conditions like low unemployment and a stable 
inflation rate, Mr. Clinton called for the increase today. The president 
trumpeted the minimum wage increase in 1996 and the expansion of the 
earned income tax credit. He said those measures have helped hard-working 
families. Since 1993, families with two children and one parent working 
full time at the minimum wage, therefore, have seen their incomes 
rise by more than $2700 because of the increase in minimum wage and 
the earned income tax credit. This has strengthened families, it has 
strengthened communities. It has helped to restore our compact of 
mutual responsibility to people who work hard and play by the rules 
ought to have a chance to be rewarded for it.
