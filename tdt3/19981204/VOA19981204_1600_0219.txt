Russian President Boris Yeltsin remains in a Moscow hospital, where 
he has been for almost two weeks, being treated for pneumonia. Mr. 
Yeltin's aides are now declining to say when he will return to work. 
Meanwhile he met in his hospital room with Prime Minister Yevgenij 
Primakov. VOA's Gail Butler has more from Moscow. The Russian president 
has for all practical purposes, turned over the day to day business 
of Russian government to his Prime Minister Yevgenij Primakov. A presidential 
spokesman says Mr. Primakov had advised President Yeltsin not to rush 
his return to work. Earlier Yeltsin aides were predicting that he 
would be back at the Kremlin on Monday, but spokesman Dmitri Yakuvshin 
says the doctors are not setting a time table for his return to work. 
While the president is hospitalized Mr. Primakov has taken the lead 
in trying to come up with a plan for easing Russia's economic crisis. 
There was more bad economic news on Friday, the Ruble fell to a new 
low of 20 per dollar, and government figures show that inflation is 
now running at 65 percent with 70 percent inflation predicted by the 
end of the year. Gail Butler, VOA News, Moscow.
