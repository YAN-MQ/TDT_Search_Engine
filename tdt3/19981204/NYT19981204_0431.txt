No matter what, Bill Parcells announced midway through the season 
when his running game had faltered badly, the Jets will continue running 
the ball. And so they have, in what has become a textbook offense. 
The Jets, with their 8-4 record and the sixth most productive offense 
in the league, are the only team that has run the ball exactly as 
many times as it has thrown it: 386. Yet despite that golden blend 
Parcells wonders what will happen if things do not go exactly right. 
Do the Jets have the wherewithal to alter that successful mix? What 
will happen Sunday, for example, if the Jets fall two touchdowns behind 
to the Seahawks in the final period? Then Vinny Testaverde would be 
forced to throw and Seattle would know it. The Seahawks have generated 
45 sacks, second highest in the league. ``Right now, if we get forced 
into a different kind of game, I don't know if that will work to our 
advantage,'' Parcells said Friday. Then again, he is never very optimistic 
when he considers potential problems. Lucky for him he has not had 
to find out, as the Jets have won six of their last seven games, and 
eight of 10 since dropping their first two games. As for sacks, Testaverde 
claims that his protection last week against Carolina was the finest 
of his career. He was not even touched, he claimed, by an opponent. 
Curtis Martin has already produced 1,000 rushing yards. ``This balance 
shows we're not a one-dimensional team,'' he said. ``I believe we 
have a good package that keeps defenses off balance. We're not seeing 
the defenses as aggressively stacked against the run as they were 
earlier.'' The reason is that Testaverde has been exploiting those 
defenses with a variety of passing and receiving weapons. In one game 
he hit nine different receivers, in another, eight. ``That balance,'' 
suggested tight end Kyle Brady, ``keeps the safeties thinking that 
any minute they're going to have to come up to make tackles. By the 
end of the game the safeties are tired from so much running.'' Left 
guard Todd Burger said: ``When you're third-and-9, you're not fooling 
anybody. You'll pass. But earlier in the season when Curtis' yards-per-carry 
was down, he was still running 30 times a game. The other team still 
had to respect it. If we had abandoned the run, it would have taken 
away from our play-action, which we use a third of the time.'' The 
Jets' offense, orchestrated during a game by Charlie Weis, with increased 
input this year from the quarterbacks coach, Dan Henning, has simply 
kept defenses off balance and tired. The Jets' average possession 
time of 32 minutes 9 seconds is second highest in the conference. 
Brady said, ``We have a stack offense this year where I'll line up 
with Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet alongside me, someone goes 
in motion, all kinds of things.'' Burger said, ``If they bring in 
eight people to stack the defense against the run, we'll go to four 
wide receivers to spread them out.'' According to center Kevin Mawae: 
``We do what we're good at and make them adjust to us. We don't adjust 
to them.'' EXTRA POINTS _ Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has decided 
that Jets Coach Bill Parcells did not break any rules in talking to 
New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe by telephone several weeks ago. 
The league was investigating whether Parcells had been guilty of tampering 
or had otherwise disobeyed league rules in making the call to Bledsoe 
the day after the Jets defeated the Patriots on Oct. 19. A league 
statement said Tagliabue accepted that the phone call was not substantial. 
``Coach Parcells said he understood the commissioner's concerns about 
phone calls to opposing players during the season and that there would 
be no further such calls by the Jets,'' the statement said. After 
that Monday night game, Bledsoe had shaken Parcells' hand, a gesture 
that impressed Parcells and prompted the coach to call his former 
quarterback. _ Center Kevin Mawae finally surfaced in the locker room 
Friday. He had avoided exposure to the news media all week. ``I've 
been studying lots of film,'' he explained. ``I want to be very prepared 
for this game. I didn't want to get caught in the media blitz.'' Mawae 
jumped from the Seahawks in the off season as a free agent, and the 
Jets made him the highest-paid center in league history: $16.8 million 
over five years. This is his first meeting against his former teammates. 
``It was a very productive week. I'm very happy I did this.'' _ Keyshawn 
Johnson practiced at full speed all week despite being on the injury 
list for a sore hamstring, according to Parcells, who seemed miffed 
that anyone would even think the wide receiver was slowed.
