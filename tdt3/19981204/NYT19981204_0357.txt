The world of oil may appear to be falling apart, but in oil things 
are never quite as bad or as good as they seem. Huge mergers have 
thrown the industry into confusion as oil prices have dipped to historic 
bottoms. Yet, if history is any guide, investors who write off energy 
will miss opportunities. True, there has been a wave of bad news: 
growth in demand has been tempered by the Asian economic crisis, winters 
have been exceedingly mild and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries appears hopelessly unable to rein in production. And yet, 
oil is a strategic commodity governed by some constants. ``The oil 
business is a cyclical industry, where prices will go up and down,'' 
said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Research Industry Foundation. 
``But oil is also a growth industry and an essential commodity.'' 
If you have any doubts about the growth part, just consider what will 
happen when every other Chinese and Indian family begins, sometime 
in the near future, to buy its own car, refrigerator and air-conditioner. 
There may not be enough energy to satisfy demand in two markets that 
will have more than a billion consumers each. ``Even now, all the 
bad news _ the mild winter, the Asian crisis and OPEC's problems _ 
are one-time factors,'' said Ernst von Metzsch, a partner at Wellington 
Management, a Boston money manager. Worldwide demand for oil is expected 
to rise 0.5 percent this year, compared with an average annual rate 
of 2.3 percent over the past decade. Regardless of the bad news and 
predictions that West Texas Intermediate will soon trade in the middle 
single digits a barrel, many OPEC experts expect oil prices to rise 
gradually to $17 a barrel within a year, versus $11 on Friday. In 
other words, when it comes to oil, think long term. And, don't be 
surprised if oil prices double in a relatively short period. In the 
present atmosphere of excitement and confusion fostered by the recent 
Exxon-Mobil merger announcement and the earlier British Petroleum-Amoco 
deal, the best strategy is to keep a fair share of your energy portfolio 
in huge multinationals. Specifically, that means the big five: Exxon 
Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, British Petroleum, Chevron and Texaco. ``This 
group of big international integrated companies is the most interesting 
right now,'' said Paul Ting, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Ting 
predicts that Exxon's shares, now at $71.50, will hit $85 in 12 to 
18 months, and that Texaco, now at $56.3125, may hit $70 in that same 
period. For Chevron, the target price is $88, versus $82 on Friday. 
``Even if you misjudge the timing with this group, there is always 
another day,'' Ting said. ``All of them have over the past year cleaned 
up their balance sheet, bringing debt-to-capital ratios from 40 percent 
closer to 30 percent, and all are still in an acquisition mode.'' 
With the big oil stocks, investors get paid to wait for any price 
rise. Exxon, Texaco and Chevron have yields of 2.29 percent, 3.20 
percent and 2.98 percent, respectively, versus just 1.31 percent for 
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. The integrated structure 
of these companies _ production, refining, and retailing as well as 
plastics businesses _ gives them a measure of protection. ``This industry 
has a self-correcting mechanism,'' said Karl Bandtel, a partner at 
Wellington Management. Acquisition fever also provides opportunities. 
ARCO, for example, which has big oil reserves in Alaska's Prudhoe 
Bay as well as oil and gas in Indonesia, is one possible target. Its 
shares trade at $67, but Bandtel said they could climb as high as 
$80 the next 12 to 18 months even if ARCO isn't acquired. More risky 
are small independent United States exploration companies. Many of 
their stock prices are off 50 percent or more the past 12 months. 
It's the same for oil-service industries like drilling companies. 
Weatherford International, for example, has fallen from over $50 a 
share a year ago to $17.50 on Friday. Bandtel said, however, that 
it could double in a year if demand for services picks up, as he expects 
it to. Even now there are buys, mainly in companies largely involved 
in natural gas, which has fallen less than oil. Alberta Energy, which 
trades at $21.3125, could hit $26 within a year, according to von 
Metzsch. In general, analysts and managers suggest avoiding higher-cost 
oil producers in North America _ there are scores of them in Texas, 
Oklahoma, California, Louisiana and Alberta. They may need oil prices 
of $18 a barrel to make a profit _ a level that may not be seen for 
some time. Two events to watch: the fourth-quarter earnings announcements 
of oil companies, coming in January, and the OPEC meeting in late 
March. The former will show how well individual companies are coping 
with low oil prices; the latter will show whether a seriously weakened 
OPEC has the will to adopt a new strategy for cutting production. 
But even if OPEC cannot discipline itself, some experts believe industry 
mergers and low oil prices will help it, as small companies exit the 
business of pumping oil in expensive places like the United States. 
``If these mergers curtail production outside the OPEC area, they 
could in fact help, not hurt the whole energy industry,'' said Nordine 
Ait-Laoussine, a Geneva-based energy strategist and a former energy 
minister of Algeria.
