Authorities in Texas say an escaped death row inmate found dead yesterday 
accidentally drowned. 29-year-old Martin gurule may have sought refuge 
in the swift waters of a Rain-swollen Creek when searchers got close 
to his hiding place. His body was discovered one week after his escape 
from the state prison in huntsville. The nephew of a man gurule was 
convicted of killing says, "I'm just glad he's dead."
