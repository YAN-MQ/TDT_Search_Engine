She inspired millions of adventurers, and then she was gone. But DNA 
technology finally may help solve an old mystery -- what happened 
to amelia Earhart? Rick Lockridge has more in this edition of "tech 
trends." She fascinated the people in her own time and was someone 
admired and emulated and she was seen as a model for young women. 
That's part, I think, of why we still care, because we're still fascinated 
with her. The air and space museum's Tom crouch has heard lots of 
theories about what happened to amelia Earhart, the celebrated aviatrix 
who disappeared along with her navigator over the south pacific on 
July 2nd, 1937. Now, there's a new theory, that bones measured by 
the British on a small atoll nearly 60 years ago represent the proof 
that Earhart's final flight, and life, ended on a place called nikumaroro. 
And with the better techniques available today, we can see that there 
is not only a likelihood but a probability that it was a person more 
or less of Earhart's description. The bones in question are nowhere 
to be found, but the recently re-evaluated measurements of those bones 
suggest a tall, northern European woman. And back then, there were 
no recorded female inhabitants of nikumaroro. Now, if the researchers 
could find just one of those bones. All we need is one to do a mitochondrial 
DNA match and then we would know. If you find one of those, clearly, 
it's a smoking gun. The next step -- yet another canvass of nikumaroro. 
More detective work for those who would solve the mystery. Rick Lockridge, 
CNN.
