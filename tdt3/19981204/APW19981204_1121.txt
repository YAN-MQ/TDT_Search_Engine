The Baltimore Orioles plugged a hole in the middle of their infield 
on Friday by agreeing to a dlrs 12.5 million, three-year contract 
with free agent second baseman Delino DeShields. The Orioles also 
announced the re-signing of outfielder B.J. Surhoff, who also had 
been courted by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Terms of the deal were not 
disclosed. DeShields, who hit .290 with the St. Louis Cardinals this 
season, will fill the void left by the departure of free agent Roberto 
Alomar, who signed with the Cleveland Indians last month. DeShields 
likely will fill the leadoff spot in the batting order vacated by 
Alomar. DeShields had a .371 on-base percentage, getting 122 hits 
and 56 walks, and led the Cardinals with eight triples. There was 
no immediate announcement by the Orioles but the agreement was confirmed 
by a source who spoke on the condition he not be identified. DeShields, 
who made dlrs 3 million this year, gets a dlrs 500,000 signing bonus, 
dlrs 3,666,667 next season and dlrs 4,166,667 in each of the final 
two years. The addition of DeShields means the Orioles already have 
filled three starting positions this week. Baltimore signed free agent 
left fielder Albert Belle and traded for catcher Charles Johnson on 
Tuesday. The Orioles and Cardinals were the leading contenders to 
sign DeShields, who stole 26 bases in 36 tries last season. Although 
he isn't known for his power, he hit seven homers and drove in 44 
runs.
