It inspired, even comforted, Communists, and terrified democrats and 
human rights activists. The statue of infamous Soviet secret police 
chief Felix Dzerzhinsky loomed before the KGB headquarters until it 
was toppled by euphoric pro-democracy protesters in 1991. Seven years 
after Russia became a democracy, the Communist-dominated Russian parliament 
formally approved a measure Friday calling for the statue's resurrection. 
The measure passed 255-102 after two heated debates that reflected 
the chasm between those who champion the Soviet collapse and the Communists 
and other hard-liners who view the Soviet era fondly _ and bitterly 
lament Russia's post-Soviet decline. The document says the restored 
statue would be a ``symbol of the fight against crime in Russia.'' 
Crime has become a major problem in post-Soviet Russia, with official 
corruption, organized crime, murders and violent robberies a pervasive 
part of life. Russians, including many who do not support the Communists, 
are deeply unhappy about the lawlessness and several political parties 
have tried to harness that discontent. ``Replacing the statue will 
reassure the nation,'' Nikolai Kharitonov, leader of the Communist-allied 
Agrarian Party, said when the measure was first proposed Wednesday. 
Russia's beleaguered reformers see Dzerzhinsky as a criminal himself. 
``Dzerzhinsky was one of the most horrible butchers in history, with 
a multitude of innocent victims on his conscience,'' said lawmaker 
Yuri Rybakov, a member of the Russia's Democratic Choice party. ``How 
can we possibly reinstate his statue?'' The Duma's resolution, which 
is non-binding, urges the Moscow city government to restore the monument. 
But the city legislature _ where Communists are far less influential 
than they are in the national parliament _ must approve all such decisions. 
Moscow's powerful Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading presidential hopeful, 
said Friday he opposed restoring the statue _ but also said he had 
opposed its initial removal. ``We will not look very good if we stand 
before the world as a system that takes down monuments, then restores 
them, then takes them down again and restores them again,'' he was 
quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. The towering bronze 
statue of ``Iron Felix,'' head of the first secret police organization 
in the Soviet era, was a major Moscow landmark for decades. In one 
of the most enduring images of the defeated hard-line coup against 
Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991, five giant cranes 
pulled down the 14-ton statue. Thousands of onlookers cheered and 
clambered over the prone monument, denouncing the KGB's role in decades 
of repression. The statue has since languished with other Soviet-era 
statues in a city park. Lyubyanka Square is now used by human rights 
groups for vigils to honor the millions of victims of Soviet rule. 
Relatives of victims of Soviet-era purges whose remains were never 
found use the square as a symbolic gravesite, bringing flowers every 
year. President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Friday 
that the president didn't take the parliament's decision seriously 
as a legal document. But ``on an emotional level it is difficult to 
expect a person who spearheaded democratic reforms to support a monument'' 
that for many people symbolizes political repression, Yakushkin said. 
Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the liberal Yabloko faction, said Friday: 
``It's now clear that all Communist talk about being a new, reformed 
party is a cynical lie.'' ``If they come to power in Russia, they 
would use the same methods this man (Dzerzhinsky) used _ physical 
extermination of their opponents. Their ideal of justice is summary 
executions in the basements.'' Yabloko members also proposed an end 
to the state financing of Vladimir Lenin's embalmed body and his mausoleum 
on Red Square. The motion was overwhelmingly defeated.
