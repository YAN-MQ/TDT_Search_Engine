Iran's naval forces and its elite Revolutionary Guards launched exercises 
in the Gulf Friday, Tehran radio reported. The five-day exercises 
began with defensive amphibious operations and the shelling of targets 
by warships and air force fighter-bombers, the radio said. The 50,000 
forces taking part also will practice mine-laying, mine-sweeping, 
chemical attack scenarios, and air defense tactics later in the week, 
the radio said. The maneuvers, code-named Unity 77, would extend from 
the central Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman, 
the radio said. Earlier this week, the official Islamic Republic News 
Agency said that the maneuvers would assess the country's defense 
against chemical, biological and nuclear attacks. ``The other objectives 
of this great exercise are to boost our ability to plan for combined 
operations,'' Isa Galverdi, a commander of the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guards Corps, told the radio. An Iranian military official told The 
Associated Press that an electronic warfare system capable of jamming 
enemy radar would also be put to the test. He said that until now, 
the Iranian navy only had the capability to defend against electronic 
warfare. But new systems developed internally will give Iranian warships 
the capability of jamming enemy electronics, the official said. He 
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
