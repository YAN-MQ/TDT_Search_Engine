Now to oil prices at a 12-year low. This is also having an enormous 
impact. Both good and bad. Here's ABC's Bob Jamieson. The union pacific 
railroad uses 1.3 gallons of Diesel fuel in a Year. In the last three 
months alone, fuel costs were $20 million less than a Year ago. Another 
winner is freight hauler Ms carriers. Th 4,0 trus,ach guzzling llon 
of fuel everyeven miles, lower oil prices will save the Memphis company 
$45 million this year. For American airnes, the savings will be a 
whopping $300 million this year because jet fuel is a dime a gallon 
lower than it was last year. Consumers are unlikely to see that savings 
passed on to them. But for some businesses and regions of the country, 
the drop in oil prices has actually been a hardship. It has meant 
lost profits, lost jobs and lost revenue. The state of oklomwill lose 
royal om its oil fields. The University of Texas endowment will get 
$15 million less this year because oil companies are pumping less 
on University-owned land. Two-thirds of the oil rigs in west Texas 
are idle, and independent drillers have seen their revenue cut in 
half. We cut every expense possible. We let people go. We reduce overhead. 
We scratch to get by and wait for better times. Even non-oil businesses 
have been hurt. At the new brewery bar in Odessa, business is off 
65% because lower oil prices have put so many out of work. Bob Jamieson, 
ABC News, New York.
