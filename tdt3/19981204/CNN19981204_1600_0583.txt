At his office in downtown Miami, former mayor Xavier Suarez handwrites 
the lawsuit he hopes, ultimately, will help him return to city hall. 
It's the latest battle in a political war that has consumed Miami 
for more than a year. It all began in November, 1997, when Suarez 
narrowly forced mayor Joe carollo into a runoff, which Suarez then 
won. But Carollo cried foul, claiming the first election was stolen, 
because of widespread fraud in the absentee vote. Carollo returned 
triumphantly to city hall. Police arrested nearly 40 people on voter 
fraud related charges. Suarez was never linked to the scandal. Miami 
is right now where Chicago was in the '60s, Boston was in the 1940s. 
It's sort of become a symbol for political shenanigans. Earlier this 
year, Suarez began a petition drive to change the city charter and 
hold a new election. Last month, he claimed many of the signatures 
were invalid. Scores, he said, had been forged. Elections supervisor 
David Leahy began analyzing the signatures. And last week, after finding 
that 43% of the first 400 could not be verified, threw out Suarez's 
petition. Suarez will now ask the court to allow him to submit more 
signatures, claiming there has been too much attention on the invalid 
signatures. What we'd like the courts and we'd the media, we'd like 
the community, we'd like the whole civic Arena to focus on is the 
good signatures. Mayor Carollo says he's cooperating with law enforcement 
and hopes to find who's behind what he claims, once again, is extensive 
fraud. This time, we're not going to stop at the border. This time 
we're going to March on Baghdad and get Hussein. So it is deja vu 
here at Miami city hall. Police and prosecutors have seized the latest 
petitions and have started another investigation of the mayor's race 
that just won't end. Mark Potter, CNN, Miami.
