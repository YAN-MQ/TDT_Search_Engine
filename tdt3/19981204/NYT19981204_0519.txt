A white third-grade teacher who was threatened by two black parents 
after she used the book ``Nappy Hair'' in her Brooklyn classroom started 
a new assignment in a Queens school on Friday, school officials said. 
The teacher, Ruth Sherman, began teaching a second-grade class at 
Public School 131 in Jamaica, in Community School District 29, a school 
of mostly black and Hispanic middle-class students that is close to 
her home in Nassau County, Long Island, the officials said. Saying 
she feared for her safety, Ms. Sherman refused to return to her job 
on Monday at PS 75 in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. Two parents 
had threatened Ms. Sherman and called her racist at a community meeting 
at the school, for using ``Nappy Hair,'' a critically acclaimed book. 
They said they found the book offensive. It was written by a black 
author and scholar, Carolivia Herron, and has been recommended by 
the Teachers College of Columbia University for classroom use. The 
book is a coming-of-age story about a black girl's appreciation of 
her hair; ``nappy'' refers to the kinky texture of some black people's 
hair. The book was created to engender pride and self-esteem, and 
Ms. Sherman said this was also her intention in reading it to her 
mostly black and Hispanic students at PS 75. Since the uproar over 
her use of the book, Ms. Sherman and the author have met and now plan 
to work together on a study guide to accompany the book, the teacher 
said. ``I want to be closer to home only because I'll feel safer,'' 
Ms. Sherman said Friday morning as she dashed to her car from her 
two-story red-brick home and headed for her new school. ``God forbid, 
if anything happens.'' The Rev. Herbert Daughtry, pastor of the House 
of the Lord Pentecostal Church in downtown Brooklyn, met Friday with 
at least one of the parents who lodged a complaint against Ms. Sherman, 
to urge her to come forward and explain what troubles her about the 
book. Daughtry, who was called in as a mediator by the parent after 
the meeting, said the original concerns have been lost in the news 
media coverage of the incident. Though he refused to disclose the 
parent's name or say whether she was one of the people who threatened 
Ms. Sherman, he said that she had a child in Ms. Sherman's class. 
``The original question was: Did Ms. Sherman have the principal's 
permission to use this book?'' Daughtry said. ``The answer was no. 
The next question was: Was it appropriate? Now, that's up for debate. 
I don't know anything about any threats over this. I don't know who's 
involved in that. All I know is that this parent's concerns have gotten 
lost in the shuffle.'' Ms. Sherman was transferred from PS 75 after 
two parents, including one with a child in Ms. Sherman's class, threatened 
her at a public meeting, officials said. Felix Vazquez, the superintendent 
of District 32, removed Ms. Sherman from the school, he said, for 
safety reasons while he determined whether the book was appropriate 
for classroom use. He later supported Ms. Sherman but said she should 
have sought permission to read the book from the principal of PS 75, 
Felicita Santiago. Daughtry, who is black, said anything having to 
do with blacks and their hair is potentially explosive because of 
stereotypes that date back to slavery. That, he said, was the mother's 
concern. ``This is explosive stuff,'' he said. ``Those in the black 
community know what I mean. Anything dealing with hair, skin color, 
features and all that stuff is a tinderbox of emotions. Did she have 
the sensitivity while teaching it?'' Antonio Worley, 8, who was a 
student in Ms. Sherman's class at P.S. 75, said Friday that he enjoyed 
the book. ``I don't feel right, because she taught me a lot of stuff,'' 
Antonio said. ``She taught me how to speak right. And `Nappy Hair' 
was funny because the grandfather was saying all that stuff about 
his granddaughter's hair and the people were like, uh-huh. I'm so 
sad I don't feel like going to school.'' Lydia Flores, whose 8-year-old 
daughter, Jennifer, was a student in Ms. Sherman's class, said it 
was time to move on, though the teacher would be missed. The class, 
she said, is being taught by substitute teachers until a replacement 
can be found. ``It's a shame that this had to happen,'' Mrs. Flores 
said. ``Jennifer doesn't like having the substitutes, but I've told 
her she has to get used to whoever comes in after Ms. Sherman. She's 
not coming back.''
