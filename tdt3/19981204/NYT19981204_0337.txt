In 1922 two brothers from England, George and Charles Hurst, started 
brewing beer here. But they had no name for it. A year later an elephant 
killed George on a hunting trip. Charles turned tragedy into macabre 
inspiration: He named the beer Tusker. The offending elephant's tusks, 
dinged with a last-minute bullet hole, still hang in the corporate 
boardroom, and Tusker is by far the best-selling beer in Kenya. Now 
beer drinkers here, who often take their beer warm and always take 
it seriously, are watching as the maker of Tusker, East African Breweries, 
face a threat from another behemoth. There is a beer war on in East 
Africa. South African Breweries, the biggest brewer in Africa, has 
decided to take on Tusker, and in early October it began churning 
out half-liter bottles from a new plant outside Nairobi. Tusker is 
in turn nearly half owned by Guinness, the giant brewer and producer 
of clever marketing. In two months the battle has become about more 
than beer: it touches on Kenya's tenuous sense of nationalism, the 
weak economy and high taxes, the reality that many people are too 
poor to afford bottled beer. And it has been ugly. Thugs have destroyed 
the ubiquitous billboards from both companies. Near Nairobi's main 
airport, one billboard for Castle, the South African brand, has been 
shredded and rebuilt three times. East African Breweries turned around 
and is trying to sell Tusker in South Africa, but has become embroiled 
in a trademark dispute there. So the Kenyan government is now threatening 
higher taxes on all South African imports. ``The perception is correct,'' 
Michael Karanja, managing director for East African Breweries, said 
at a news conference here recently. ``We are fighting.'' Through it 
all, beer-drinking Kenyans seem pleased, in the hope that the dispute 
degenerates into a free fall in prices. Only about 15 percent of people 
in Kenya drink bottled beer because, at about 90 cents for a Tusker 
and slightly more for Castle, it is expensive in a nation where per 
capita income is only $271 a year. ``Competition lowers price,'' said 
Samuel Wanjohi, 49, a Tusker drinker, in a crowded bar in downtown 
Nairobi one recent night. ``So I suspect there may be a reduction 
in the price. If Castle were selling at 45 shillings people would 
stop drinking Tusker.'' His dream price is about 75 cents for a bottle. 
As in many places in the world, beer is important business in Africa. 
Factions in conflict often disagree on their beer brand as well. Even 
when soap and salt cannot get through to war zones, beer often does; 
In Kisangani, the rebel-held city in Congo, the brewery is reportedly 
still going even though the diamond trade has disappeared. But the 
tussle between East African and South African breweries is in fact 
a result of peace: South African companies _ for years unable to do 
much business outside their borders _ began looking to expand after 
the end of apartheid. And African nations that took sides in the Cold 
War, as Kenya did with the West, suddenly had to liberalize their 
economies when it ended. South African Breweries, about the world's 
10th largest brewer, has been expanding rapidly by pouring money into 
dilapidated breweries around Africa and Eastern Europe. They moved 
directly into territory where East African sells beer, investing heavily 
in Tanzania and Uganda. In Kenya, its plans are ambitious: to win 
20 to 30 percent of the market in the first few years, up from roughly 
2 percent now. ``Oh, we'd like as big a piece of the cake as possible,'' 
said Allen McInnes, South African's sales and distribution manager 
in Kenya. He suggested that the cake is big enough for two, if the 
economy finally improves: Kenyans are now drinking half as much bottled 
beer _ about 200 million liters a year _ as they did in 1989. ``It's 
a very sizable market,'' McInnes said. East African, which controls 
97 percent of the beer market in Kenya, is taking no chances: It has 
responded by cutting costs, introducing a new upscale brand and spending 
more on marketing. But its most visible strategy has been a blatant 
play to patriotism and fear of South Africa's economic might, in a 
slogan that equates Tusker with Kenya itself: ``My country, my beer.'' 
In a country where people often identify themselves first by their 
tribe, then as Kenyans, it seemed a risky strategy, especially considering 
that Guinness owns 46 percent of the company. But Rick Ashley, a Nairobi 
stockbroker, said the slogan strikes a chord, particularly in rural 
areas. ``There is still _ not only in the beer side of things _ a 
great wariness of these South Africans coming in and taking over the 
Kenyan economy,'' said Ashley, managing director of Kestrel Capital. 
``If you can make a few shillings out of exploiting that, good luck 
to you.'' But interviews around bars in Nairobi _ where people had 
definite opinions about the beer wars _ suggest that nationalism has 
its limits. ``We don't care where it comes from,'' said Stanley Kamau, 
a 50-year-old farmer drinking Castle. ``There is nothing but fear 
that Kenya Breweries is having,'' he added, referring to East African's 
name until November. ``They have monopolized this market. Now we are 
seeing that there is someone who wants to compete.'' He and others 
said they had not yet seen evidence of a price war, but they are waiting. 
Officials at both brewers say they want to avoid that because more 
than 75 percent of the price of beer goesto Kenya's exorbitant taxes. 
But some people think a price war is inevitable, particularly if South 
African introduces a brand to compete with East African's successful, 
inexpensive brand, Citizen. Binale Wekesa, a 47-year-old private investigator, 
sat in a bar the other evening and said he started drinking Castle 
because he was happy to have a choice that keeps him happy the morning 
after. ``It has no hangover,'' Wekesa said. ``Tusker, when I take 
it, I get a headache _ very much.''
