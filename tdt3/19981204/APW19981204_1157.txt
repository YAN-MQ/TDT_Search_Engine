Brazilian markets see-sawed Friday and ended down a day after shedding 
nearly 9 percent on news that Congress failed to pass key reforms 
deemed essential to the government's economic austerity package. After 
dipping as low as 2.6 percent, Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock exchange 
closed down 1 percent in light trading. The smaller Rio de Janeiro 
stock exchange shed 1.2 percent in extremely light trading. In the 
morning, the Bovespa rose as much as 2.9 percent, amid a feeling the 
market had overreacted to Congress' failure to pass an increase in 
social security taxes and a cut in pensions. The measure, expected 
to save at least 2.5 billion reals (dlrs 2.1 billion) next year, was 
an important part of the government's recently announced plan to cut 
the country's burgeoning debt and make it eligible for dlrs 41.5 billion 
in international aid.
