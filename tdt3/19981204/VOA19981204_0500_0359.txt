Up, up, and away. The international space station is another step 
closer to realization today with the successful launch of the space 
shuttle "Endeavour." A last-minute alarm delayed the launch on Thursday, 
but this morning's liftoff went very smoothly. Two minutes into the 
flight, at the critical booster separation stage, the shuttle and 
crew turned in a flawless performance. Booster off, sir. Confirming 
a good separation of the twin solid rockets. "Endeavour"'s speed now 
3,200 miles per hour as it moves into its second stage. Three main 
engines. "Endeavour," your performance is nominal. You are two engine. 
Performance nominal. Two engine. The call indicating that all performance 
for the spacecraft right on target. All engines operating normal. 
Altitude now 42 miles 61 miles northeast of the Kennedy Space Center. 
Those NASA announcers tracking the progress of the flight. "Endeavour," 
with six astronauts aboard, is headed for a rendezvous with a Russian 
module now in orbit after its launch last month. The shuttle is carrying 
a passageway which is designed to be connected to the module during 
this 11-day mission which will include several spacewalks. Ultimately, 
the space station will consist of more than 100 components to be deployed 
in space over the next five years. The operation will require 45 U.S. 
and Russian space flights.
