In Taiwan, the party that has ruled for almost a half century is battling 
to hold on to power. Military forces there are constantly in training. 
Maintaining readiness for a possible attack from Mainland China. It 
is a state of tension that has kept the ruling KMT Party in power 
for almost 50 years. John Chang, the party secretary general, says 
its opponents are actually keeping the KMT in power. They advocated 
independence of Taiwan by creating a new state. What we think is very 
much materialistic and we think it is totally unnecessary. And that 
the move will definitely mean clear invitation of military action 
from Mainland China. Because Mainland China has stated literally that 
they can never tolerate not Taiwan on China. But KMT opponents have 
modified their stands on relations with China during the past four 
years and are now looking to improve economic and political ties to 
the main land. Pollsters say tomorrow's vote is too close to call.
