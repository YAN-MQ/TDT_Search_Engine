On the eve of a visit to Libya, UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, 
is talking down the prospect of a breakthrough in the Pan Am bombing 
over Scotland 10 years ago. News reports say Colonel Gaddafi had no 
power to strike such a deal. Heba Sala reports. The Libyan news agency 
said Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was neither head of state, a prime minister, 
or a foreign minister. He was the leader of the Libyan revolution 
and as such, had no right to sign deals with Mr. Annan. Only the Libyan 
people could do that through the system of popular congresses and 
committees. The message from Libya does not seem to bode well for 
Mr. Annan's mission. He is expected to meet Colonel Gaddafi but his 
spokesman said earlier, that they were going to Libya without expectations 
of a breakthrough. The BBC's North African corespondent, Hebra Sala.
