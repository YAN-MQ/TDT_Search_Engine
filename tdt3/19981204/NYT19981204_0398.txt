Suharto, the former president, who is being threatened with house 
arrest, has defended himself with a simple answer against charges 
of corruptly amassing a huge personal fortune: He is a good saver 
and landlord. In a rare interview, published Friday in Dharmais, a 
Jakarta magazine, Suharto said $3 million found in his local bank 
accounts was from his presidential earnings and rent earned from two 
houses. The magazine is run by a charity that he owned until last 
week. Estimates of the wealth Suharto accumulated during a 32-year 
reign range up to $40 billion. Dharmais quoted Suharto as saying: 
``That money I collected and deposited in the banks, and every month 
it increased until it reached this amount of about 22 billion rupiah'' 
_ or $3 million. A government official said Friday that the attorney 
general could put Suharto under house arrest while an investigation 
into his wealth continues. The attorney general, Andi Ghalib, said 
Suharto could be summoned for questioning next week. Riot police officers 
and soldiers scuffled again Friday with student protesters trying 
to march on Suharto's residence and the presidential palace to press 
demands for his arrest and trial over corruption. Diplomats say they 
consider it unlikely that Suharto will face corruption charges. They 
say President B.J. Habibie, a Suharto protege, and the country's armed 
forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, would resist a trial. Senior presidential 
advisers and the head of the governing Golkar Party in Parliament 
have declared that even if Suharto is tried and convicted on corruption 
charges, he will almost certainly be granted amnesty. Faced with daily 
protests by thousands of students who have jammed traffic in the capital, 
Suharto turned over to the government last week seven charity foundations 
valued at $528 million, including the one that owns Dharmais.
