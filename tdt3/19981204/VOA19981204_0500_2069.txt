France and Britain have signed a pledge of closer military cooperation 
to fend off possible crises in Europe. The French and British defense 
ministers signed a letter of intent in the French Port of Saint-Malo 
during bilateral talks aimed at forging a new defense identity for 
the European Union. Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President 
Jacques Chirac are to make a joint statement later today on the move 
toward closer cooperation between them in defense matters.
