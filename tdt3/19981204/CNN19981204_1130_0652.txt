If you're a woman and you wake up feeling tired, it's possible your 
menstrual cycle, pregnancy or menopause could be to blame. Studies 
have found women experience insomnia more often than men. A survey 
from the national sleep foundation suggests half of all women have 
trouble sleeping 2 1/2 days during their menstrual cycle. Almost 80% 
of pregnant women say their sleep is more disturbed during pregnancy 
than at any other time, and more than a third of menopausal or post-menopausal 
women experience hot flashes during sleep. A few tips can minimize 
insomnia for both men and women. Try to go to bed and get up at the 
same time every day. Avoid alcohol, caffeine and nicotine late in 
the day. Exercise early in the afternoon, not right before bedtime. 
Avoid napping unless you are profoundly tired. And give yourself time 
to wind down at night. For the latest health news online, check out
