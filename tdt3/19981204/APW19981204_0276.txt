Cheering Muslim mobs on Friday burned a Roman Catholic church in a 
provincial capital in the latest outburst of religious violence in 
Indonesia. At first, thousands of rioters blocked fire trucks from 
reaching the church in the capital of South Sulawesi province, 840 
miles (1,350 kilometers) east of Jakarta. The trucks eventually made 
it through but the church and two houses were gutted, said Muhamad 
Adam, a fire brigade official. Police and soldiers patrolled the area 
after the mobs dispersed. There were no reports of injuries or arrests. 
Police said that as night fell security personnel were guarding other 
churches in the predominately Muslim city of 750,000. Witnesses said 
mobs left neighboring mosques after Friday Islamic prayers and set 
fire to the suburban Kare Catholic Church. Many of the city's Christians 
are ethnic Chinese, who are often targeted when social unrest flares 
because of their relative wealth. Residents said most Chinese shops 
in the city were shut Friday. Last week, Christian rioters in the 
city of Kupang, southeast of Jakarta, burned and ransacked 15 mosques 
in retaliation for the Nov. 22 burning of churches in Jakarta. Police 
said 22 churches had been attacked in the capital, including four 
that were burned. Witnesses in Ujungpandang said about 400 Muslims, 
who arrived from Kupang after the mosque burnings there, marched through 
its streets calling for more churches to be destroyed. ``We really 
don't know what will happen in the next few days,'' said one resident 
who identified himself by the single name of Chairul. On Thursday, 
a man reported to be mentally ill set three mosques afire in Ngabang, 
on Borneo island, 810 kilometers (500 miles) north of Jakarta. The 
violence has raised fears that revenge attacks on places of worship 
could escalate in the world's most populous Muslim nation. Ninety 
percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslim, with the rest 
belonging to Christian, Buddhist and other faiths. Religious diversity 
based on a belief in God is enshrined in the national philosophy, 
known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia declared independence from 
Dutch colonial rule in 1945. But social tensions, fueled by widespread 
unemployment, have intensified in Indonesia amid the worst economic 
crisis in decades. The attacks come despite repeated calls for calm 
by Indonesian President B.J. Habibie as well as Muslim and Christian 
religious leaders.
