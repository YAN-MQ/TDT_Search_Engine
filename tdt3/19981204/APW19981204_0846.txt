Canadian-Swiss ice hockey player Chad Silver, who was found dead in 
his bed, died of a heart attack, according to autopsy results released 
Friday. Christina Achour, spokeswoman for Zurich police, said the 
autopsy ruled out a connection between Silver's death and any injury 
suffered Tuesday in his last game for the Zurich-based ZSC lions. 
He played to the end of the game against Davos although Swiss television 
has replayed footage showing his head hitting the ice hard after a 
collision. Gery Buesser, the team physician, told a news conference 
that it wasn't clear whether Silver's coronary was brought on by a 
problem with his heart rhythm. A cardiologist checked him and other 
members of the team thoroughly two weeks ago, said Buesser. In addition 
to the usual procedures, the cardiologist used ultrasound to check 
the heart area and found nothing unusual, he added. Silver was in 
very good shape. Beat Villiger, Davos team physician, told the Zurich 
station Radio Z on Friday that the pathologist had looked for a brain 
blood clot, but found none. The body of Silver, 29, was found in his 
Zurich apartment Thursday after he failed to report for practice. 
Investigating Judge Daniel Regenmass said there was no indication 
of violence. Simon Schenk, club sports director, said Silver took 
no drugs and a recent doping test on the player was negative. Villiger 
said tests are being conducted on blood and tissue samples to determine 
whether doping or drugs were involved, but that it would take about 
10 days to know the results. Investigators, however, found nothing 
in Silver's flat that would indicate he had been using any prohibited 
substances, he added. Villiger said a recent increase in deaths of 
hockey players could be attributed more to congenital and acquired 
heart problems than to the sport. But he said that because of the 
trend, the Swiss Association of Sports Physicians had developed an 
examination program. Silver underwent the checkup two weeks ago, but 
nothing unusual was detected, he added.
