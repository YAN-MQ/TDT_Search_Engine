The ex mayor of Vienna is expected to meet next week with President 
Vaclav Havel to discuss allegations of the Austrian's collaboration 
with the police under the past communist regime, the daily Pravo reported 
Friday. According to Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek, Havel issued 
the invitation to former Mayor Helmut Zilk Thursday, but no specific 
date was announced. Zilk was rejected for a Czech Republic medal of 
honor just three days before the official ceremony on Oct 28, because 
of sudden allegations that he was an informant for police in communist 
Czechoslovakia. Havel's office then cited newspaper reports and other 
unspecified information supposedly confirming the allegations. By 
law, Havel has no official access to the communist police files. Zilk, 
71, denied the allegations as ``absolute nonsense''. According to 
Spacek, Havel was briefed Thursday on the contents of Zilk's file 
by Interior minister Vaclav Grulich and archive manager Jan Frolik.
