As should be clear to anyone who has looked into what the Internet 
offers by way of religion, cyberspace has become a comfortable and 
expansive home for a vast number of faith groups. Christians, Jews, 
Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and many others have set up Web sites describing 
national organizations and individual houses of worship. Such sites 
may seem to serve a kind of billboard function, advertising and providing 
information for the groups that sponsor them. Some Web sites can work 
as meeting grounds as well. That seems to be the goal of an organization 
affiliated with the Lubavitch movement, the Hasidic Jewish group, 
which announced this week that it had created a site dedicated to 
Hanukkah, the eight-day Jewish festival of lights, which begins on 
Sunday, Dec. 13, at sundown. The organization, the American Friends 
of Lubavitch, said the site _ www.chanukah98.com _ would feature broadcasts 
of the lightings of menorahs in Jerusalem, Moscow, New York and Paris, 
all taking place at 3:15 p.m. Eastern time on that day. ``What we're 
trying to do is be lamplighters in cyberspace,'' said Rabbi Levi Shemtov, 
director of the Washington office of American Friends. The organization 
mounted a more modest site during the holiday last year, and received 
enough encouragement to expand, he said. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, 
the spiritual leader of the Lubavitch movement who died in June 1994, 
urged his followers to use the tools of modern technology, including 
toll-free telephone lines, radio broadcasts and fax machines, to reach 
out to all Jews to encourage people at all levels of observance to 
increase their commitment to the faith. The Lubavitch movement has 
world headquarters in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. In the late 1980s, 
long before the Internet came into widespread use, Shemtov said, his 
father, Rabbi Abraham Shemtov, began a project for the Lubavitch in 
which menorah lightings around the world were televised live via satellite 
linkup. It was undertaken with the approval of Schneerson, the younger 
Shemtov said. ``For us, it was pretty eye-opening,'' he said, adding 
that for members of Lubavitch, as for many among the more rigorously 
Orthodox Jews, ``television is not very popular.'' But the Internet 
may be a different matter. It holds the possibility of being ``a great 
educational tool,'' he said. Also on the Internet, users could read 
that the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America had reported its membership 
to be ``stable.'' Some of the nation's largest Protestant denominations 
suffered heavy declines in membership in the 1970s and 1980s. But 
some recent statistics indicated that the losses had moderated in 
this decade, and the Lutheran report seemed to fit the pattern. David 
Alderfer, the church's director for rosters and statistics, said membership 
declined by 2,308 people in 1997 (the latest year for which figures 
were available), less than one half of 1 percent of the church's 5.2 
million members. The loss was substantially less than that for 1996 
and 1995, when the church lost about 9,000 members each year, or for 
1994, when it lost 13,000 members. But Alderfer, who noted that the 
church gained members in 1990 and 1991, said it was too early to discern 
a trend. ``I'd want to see two more years of data,'' he said.
