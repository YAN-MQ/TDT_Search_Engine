A new analysis of radiation in the earth's atmosphere suggests that 
solar disturbances may have caused the loss of a key communication 
satellite last year. NPR's Christopher Joyce has more. The satellite 
was Galaxy 4, and it malfunctioned for a no apparent reason on May 
19. Some 45 million pager customers lost service. So did numerous 
broadcasters including National Public Radio, that use the satellite 
to send signals around the world. Dan Baker at the University of Colorado 
and a team of atmospheric scientists now say solar flares and high-speed 
solar winds created an intense flux of electrons in the earth's atmosphere 
in early May. They say those electrons could have triggered the failure. 
The scientists note that at least two other satellites experienced 
serious problems the same month. Up to now, Galaxy IV's operator, 
PanAmSat, has not determined a specific cause for the loss of the 
satellite. The scientists published their findings in Theos, the Journal 
of the American Geophysical Union. Christopher Joyce, NPR News, Washington.
