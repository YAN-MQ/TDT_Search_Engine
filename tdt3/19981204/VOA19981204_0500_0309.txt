France and Britain have signed a pledge of closer military cooperation 
to fend off possible crises in Europe. The French and British defense 
ministers signed the letter of intent today during bilateral talks 
aimed at forging a new defense identity for the European Union. British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac are 
to make a joint statement later today on the move toward closer cooperation 
between them in defense matters.
