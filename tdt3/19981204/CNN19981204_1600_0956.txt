Despite a surprisingly good unemployment report, corporate layoffs 
continue to pile up. I'm Jan Hopkins at the cnnfn newsdesk in New 
York with this edition of "Dollars & Sense." The unemployment rate 
fell to its lowest level since the spring, just 4.4%. a surprisingly 
strong 267,000 new jobs were created because of a boom in construction 
and holiday retail industries. That more than offset continued weakness 
in manufacturing. The strong report, though, may prompt the federal 
reserve to hold off on another interest rate cut when its policymakers 
meet later in the month. They will also consider the overall economic 
picture as U.S. economic growth moves into its 93rd straight month. 
That record rate beat the 92-month record for the longest peace time 
growth set in the Reagan/bush era. Nevertheless, corporate America's 
goal to maximize profits is resulting in more job cuts, and total 
about 36,000 job cuts announced just this last week. Workers at Johnson 
& Johnson are the latest causalities of corporate belt tightening. 
The maker of Tylenol and band-aid bandages slashing 4100 jobs, 4% 
of its global workforce. The reductions will come over the next 18 
months by closing 36 of its 158 factories. More than half the cuts 
will come in the United States. Johnson & Johnson has seen disappointing 
sales growth for the past few quarters because of stiff competition 
in its medical device business and lackluster performance from new 
pharmaceutical products. Also, bank of America says it cut 300 stockbrokers 
and support staff from its brokerage units. The move is a result of 
the recent merger of Nationsbank and bank America. The two companies 
eventually plan to cut a total of 5,000 to 8,000 jobs.
