A federal government psychiatrist says Capitol Hill shooting suspect 
russell Weston Jr is mentally incompetent to stand trial. She says 
he is suffering from a mental disease, making him incapable of understanding 
the charges against him or able to assist in his defense. And she 
is recommending he be hospitalized for an extended period of time. 
Weston is accused of fatally shooting two Capitol Hill police officers 
in july. His parents say he is a paranoid schizophrenic.
