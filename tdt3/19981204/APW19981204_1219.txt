Police are taking a second look at accusations that the father of 
Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu was involved in a possible murder-for-hire 
plot, officials said Friday. ``The case has been re-evaluated and 
it is now considered an open case,'' police spokesman Robert Hurst 
said. On Monday, police had said there wasn't enough evidence to warrant 
an investigation into the claims. In court affidavits filed this week, 
the Olympian claimed her father had hired a private investigator to 
track her comings and goings. She also said police officers informed 
her that her father had negotiated to pay a hit man dlrs 10,000 to 
kill a friend, 32-year-old Brian Huggins, and Luminita Miscenco, 26, 
the coach Moceanu credits with reviving her career. A call to Katherine 
Scardino, a lawyer for Dumitru Moceanu, was not returned Friday. There 
was no answer at Dumitru Moceanu's home, and a call to his gym was 
not returned. The alleged plot is the latest installment in the stormy 
relationship between the 17-year-old gymnast and her parents, whom 
she believes squandered her trust fund earnings in risky investments. 
A judge declared Moceanu a legal adult in October so she could begin 
taking stock of how her earnings were spent. But since that time, 
the relationship between the 1996 gold medalist and her father has 
disintegrated to the point that a judge this week granted temporary 
restraining orders to Moceanu and her friends, Brian and Marcy Huggins. 
The couple helped Moceanu move away from her parents. Although police 
won't discuss what new information has prompted them to ``re-evaluate'' 
attempted murder allegations, Moceanu's publicist and a former lawyer 
have said a secretly tape-recorded conversation, purportedly between 
Dumitru Moceanu and a private investigator solicited to perform the 
murder, had been turned over to police. ``He was recorded by the person 
he was talking to, asking him (the private investigator) to do harm,'' 
Roy Moore, who represented Moceanu in her fight to become a legal 
adult, said Friday. A hearing next Wednesday will determine whether 
the restraining orders should be made permanent.
