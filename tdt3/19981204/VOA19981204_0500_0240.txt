Russian officials attending a Washington conference on art and assets 
looted by the Nazis have surprised organizers of the event by turning 
over documents that could help trace some of the stolen treasures 
of World War II. From the State Department, VOA's Kyle King reports. 
The four-day conference on Holocaust-era art and assets ended with 
agreement on guidelines that are expected to have a major impact on 
the international art world. Representatives from 44 nations and 13 
non-governmental groups agreed to try to identify, locate, and return 
tens of thousands of pieces of Nazi-confiscated art that is still 
unaccounted for. As part of that effort, delegates agreed to create 
a computerized international registry with information about artwork 
stolen by the Nazis. U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, 
one of the organizers of the event, said he was almost overwhelmed 
by what the conference had accomplished. Kyle King, VOA News, the 
State Department.
