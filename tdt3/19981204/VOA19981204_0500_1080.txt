Here's Ray Kouguell with a look at your morning sports report. Two 
of the worst teams in the National Football League faced each other 
Thursday night. When it was over -- well, one of them did win. The 
Philadelphia Eagles beat the St. Louis Rams 17 to 14. Quarterback 
Koy Detmer passed for 169 yards and two touchdowns as the Eagles snapped 
a three-game losing streak. The Eagles are now 3 and 10. The Rams 
also are 3 and 10.
