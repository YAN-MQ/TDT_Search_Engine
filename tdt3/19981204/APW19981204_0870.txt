Despite promises of a cease-fire, Congolese government troops and 
their Zimbabwean allies used artillery, tanks and aircraft to attack 
rebel positions in southeastern Congo, the rebel leader said Friday. 
But Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, speaking from the Ugandan capital, said 
the rebels held ground after fighting Thursday and early Friday in 
Kabalo, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of the eastern rebel 
stronghold at Goma. There was no independent confirmation of the report. 
Last week, rebel troops and their Rwandan allies faced Zimbabwean 
soldiers across the Nzofu Bridge over the Congo River, which guarded 
the entrance to Kabalo 14 kilometers (8 miles) away. Zimbabwe, along 
with Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops and equipment to back 
the forces of Congolese President Laurent Kabila after Rwandan and 
Ugandan-backed Congolese rebels took up arms Aug. 2 to topple him. 
At a summit in Paris last week, leaders of Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe 
and Congo had pledged to work toward a cease-fire, but failed to agree 
on concrete proposals. Wamba, who on Saturday will discuss Congo with 
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, said peace talks to discuss ceasefire 
proposals in Lusaka, Zambia Dec. 9 had been postponed to a later date. 
He said his rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition had not received 
an invitation yet, but hoped to participate. So far, Congolese President 
Laurent Kabila has refused to negotiate directly with the rebel coalition 
of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected soldiers and opposition politicians, 
instead demanding that Rwanda and Uganda withdraw their support for 
the insurgents. Both countries say they will stay on as long as Congo 
remains unstable. ``An intention for a need to move toward a cease-fire 
was just an intention, now that we know that Kabila and Zimbabwe have 
attacked Kabalo with a full force,'' Wamba said.
