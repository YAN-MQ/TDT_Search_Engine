Former Southern California head football coach John Robinson is the 
new head coach at the University of Nevada - Las Vegas. Robinson replaces 
Jeff Fortin who guided UNLV to a disastrous 0 and 11 season which 
extended their losing streak to 16 going back to last year. At age 
63, Robinson said he's ready for the challenge. There's a certain 
gamble in coming here. People have asked me, "Why are you doing this?" 
Because it gives us a chance to put ourselves on the line. Every athlete, 
every person, every one of you -- we're all at our best when we're 
on the line, when we accept a challenge and do whatever we can to 
meet it. Robinson was fired by Southern California at the end of the 
1997 season, his second stint as head coach there. Robinson led USC 
from 1976 until 1982 before taking a head coaching job with the Los 
Angeles Rams in the National Football League. Robinson returned to 
USC in 1993.
