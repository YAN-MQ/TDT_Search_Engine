Republican members of the house Judiciary committee want a list of 
witnesses scheduled to defend the president next week. The chief republican 
counsel sent a letter to the president's attorneys asking them to 
provide both the list and time requirements by today. But White House 
spokesman Joe Lockhart says the actual charges against the president 
are unclear. Articles of impeachment are still being drafted by committee 
aides.
