A 50-year-old gas station owner fatally shot his ex-wife and her male 
friend Friday before turning the pistol on himself in a village near 
here, police said. Police said the assailant, who was not identified, 
walked into a tavern where his former wife worked, pulled out a .44-caliber 
pistol and shot a 30-year-old man repeatedly. The victim died later 
in hospital. The ex-wife ran outside for help, but her former husband 
pursued her into the street, police said. She was pronounced dead 
at the scene. The assailant then shot himself dead. Police said the 
couple had been divorced for about three months. The incident occurred 
in the village of Mitterpullendorf about 15 kilometers (9 miles) west 
of the Hungarian border and 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of here.
