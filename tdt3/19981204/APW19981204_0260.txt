Thailand agreed on Friday to allow the U.S. movie studio 20th Century 
Fox to continue its landscaping for a movie to be shot on a southern 
vacation island. A little more than two weeks ago, the forestry department 
ordered a temporary halt to pre-production on the film ``The Beach,'' 
starring Leonardo DiCaprio, to allow environmental complaints to be 
examined. Plans to film Alex Garland's best-selling novel on Phi Phi 
Island have fallen afoul of environmentalists, who say that laws protecting 
the national park there are being violated. After two weeks of investigations 
including field trips, a special study group appointed by the forestry 
department concluded that preparing and shooting the movie would affect 
the environment, but the damage would be small enough so that it can 
be undone. The group suggested several measures to protect the environment. 
Santa Pestanij, the Thai coordinator for the movie, said he was partly 
relieved by the go-ahead, but still worried about an ongoing protest 
by environmentalists and local residents, who are camping out on the 
shooting site. He said he is certain that 20th Century Fox will respond 
positively to the study group's suggestions. Santa said the protesters 
insisted that they will oppose the film's shooting no matter what 
the study group said. To avoid confronting the protesters, Santa said 
he would contact the provincial authorities to deal with them.
