In tennis, the draw has been held for this week's Davis Cup competition 
between Italy and Sweden, with Andrea Gaudenzi and Magnus Norman playing 
in the opening singles match. The second singles match in Milan features 
Davide Sanguinetti taking on Magnus Gustafsson. Saturday's doubles 
match has Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso of Italy playing Jonas Bjorkman 
and Niklas Kulti. Bjorkman says it will be tough to beat Italy at 
home. It's going to be very tough. All the matches in Davis Cup are 
always hard to play, and this time we have a final away, and that 
simply means our cards are going to be behind the Italians, and that's 
where we're going to -- where we'll have to wait, but it's definitely 
going to be a great atmosphere here, and I think we have a very good 
and strong team together here, and I think it will work out good. 
The reverse singles matches on Sunday feature Gaudenzi taking on Gustafsson 
and Norman playing Sanguinetti.
