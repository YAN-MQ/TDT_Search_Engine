President Leonid Kuchma has ordered the government to study the possibility 
of allowing the national currency to float freely as of next year, 
a news report said Friday. In another development, the country's inflation 
was 3 percent in October, down from 6.2 in October, officials said. 
Overall inflation so far in 1998 has amounted to 16.2 percent, but 
13 percent of that increase has come in the past three months, the 
State Statistics Committee said. In a special resolution, Kuchma told 
the Cabinet and the National Bank to consider abandoning the present 
trading band for the currency, the hryvna, and replace it with a floating 
rate as of Jan. 1, the independent Ukrainian News agency said. The 
order came two weeks after Kuchma began speaking in favor of softer 
monetary policies _ including lifting currency controls and printing 
more money _ to allow the government to ease its mounting debt burden. 
The National Bank has worked to keep the hryvna stable since November 
at 3.4 to the U.S. dollar, within a government-set trading band of 
2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar. The stabilization followed two months of 
financial turmoil, caused in part by the economic crisis in neighboring 
Russia. The hryvna fell sharply, forcing the government to widen the 
old trading band of 1.8 to 2.25 to the dollar. The National Bank managed 
to temporarily stabilize the markets in the past two months with the 
imposition of various currency controls. But the bank has warned repeatedly 
that the stability was too fragile to permit looser monetary policies 
in the near future. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko said 
recently that the financial situation in Russia, Belarus and Moldova 
_ Ukraine's major trade partners _ continued to worsen. However, Ukraine 
urgently needs to raise several hundred million dollars to keep the 
1998 budget deficit at 2.5 percent of gross domestic product. That's 
one of the main requirements set by the International Monetary Fund 
for the disbursement of a recently approved dlrs 2.2 billion loan. 
The Cabinet's chronically lax tax collection and failure to implement 
reforms needed to boost economic activity have led government leaders 
to suggest printing money and devaluing the hryvna to avoid a deeper 
crisis. The government so far has made ends meet by not paying wages, 
pensions and social spending debts, which Kuchma said currently total 
8.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.5 billion), or 40 percent of next year's 
projected budget revenues.
