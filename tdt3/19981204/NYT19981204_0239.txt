Regulars call it ``Kafe.'' Mick Jagger, who dropped in four nights 
in a row while in town on a concert tour this summer, referred to 
it as ``Jazz.'' By whatever name, the ultrahip uninhibited Jazz Kafe, 
which is Moscow's most-sought-out night spot, is riding out Russia's 
economic implosion as if the party never ended. The mighty banks that 
added gleaming ziggurats to the skyline in the last decade are half 
empty. Both the ruble and the Russian stock market have collapsed. 
Western executives are heading for the exits, as one of the worst 
emerging-markets disasters of recent years plays out. But at the Jazz 
Kafe, the economy and the onset of a Russian winter are just conversational 
ice-breakers. ``What crisis?'' Boris Lifshits, a young entrepreneur, 
said, guzzling a $10 Corona. ``There is no crisis until the Jazz Kafe 
empties out.'' Young women in tight-fitting designer clothes shook 
their Wella-conditioned hair all around him to the jazz beat in the 
intimate lounge-size club, which occupies the basement of a jazz school 
near Moscow's Tretyakov Art Gallery. Men in retro leather gear or 
Hugo Boss jackets mobbed the bar for drinks. It was early on a Friday 
evening last month, just days after Russia asked the West for emergency 
food aid, but the club was more packed than the Moscow metro at rush 
hour. Outside, supplicants without membership cards, which cost up 
to $500, shoved one another in the sub-zero temperatures, hoping to 
get past the doormen. On the street were the hulking shapes of Mercedes-Benzes, 
BMW's and foreign-made convertibles, known here as cabriolets. ``There's 
a small group of people who are going to party, no matter what,'' 
said Sin Lazarovich, 32, the Jazz Kafe's co-manager. ``Where was Coco 
Chanel during World War II? Not sitting home and sulking.'' Lazarovich, 
a Serb who was a club promoter in Belgrade during the late '80s and 
who moved to Moscow two years ago, said the ruble's nose dive had 
not ``wrecked the high'' of the so-called Golden Youth, the sons and 
daughters of the former Communist elite, who in many ways are still 
the country's elite. They constitute a significant part of the club's 
clientele. (For several months after the club opened last year, foreigners 
were excluded because they were not considered stylish enough.) In 
Moscow today, young models are still being given new cars by their 
flush boyfriends, or ``sponsors,'' as the men are euphemistically 
called. ``Someone handed his girlfriend the keys to a cabriolet the 
other day,'' Lazarovich said. Around 5 a.m., the party swung into 
high gear. A lissome young woman climbed onto the mini-stage near 
the bar and began undressing in an impromptu striptease. Revelers 
crowded around and jousted with one another to peel off her clothes, 
while the deejay pumped up the volume. Some of the men shoved American 
$100 bills at her, chanting ``davai, davai'' _ ``more, more.'' Within 
minutes there were three near-nude women on stage, and the tension 
had reached such a peak that when someone popped a bottle of Veuve 
Clicquot, the crowd shrieked in alarm. ``When things like this stop 
happening, I'm out of here,'' Christophe Charlier, a French-American 
banker from the brokerage house Renaissance Capital, said. It has 
laid off 30 percent of its work force, but he is hanging onto a job. 
``The quality of life has not changed yet,'' he said. The Jazz Kafe 
is not the only night spot that's been twisting and shouting its way 
through Russia's financial crisis. A new disco named Gallerie, decorated 
with Naugahyde couches, a granite-topped bar and prints of the Austrian 
Expressionist Egon Schiele, is buzzing on weekends, attracting a cocktail 
of models, bohemians and ``biznismen.'' In addition, there are other 
signs that luxury has not gone out of style for a privileged few. 
A glitzy Fendi boutique opened a few weeks ago, and the manager told 
a local newspaper, ``Some people are still updating their wardrobes.'' 
There is a new multiplex movie theater, and new restaurants serving 
Japanese and Italian food. Two new magazines _ a Russian-language 
Vogue and one about golf _ hit newsstands this fall. All contrast 
sharply with the disgruntled lines snaking around banks that have 
declared insolvency, or the harried food shoppers carefully counting 
their kopecks. Most of the men at Gallerie _ Russians, except for 
a smattering of foreigners _ dress in dark European suits and seem 
to have money to burn. ``No one knows what they do, and no one asks,'' 
said Victor Gelman, a television producer, taking in the scene. ``They're 
making money somehow, and that's enough.'' It is these shadowy men 
_ a potpourri of Russian and foreign yuppies, children of the elite 
and mobsters _ who are subsidizing Moscow's Saturday night fever. 
One concession to hard times has been the scrapping of cover charges 
at many clubs. And this has encouraged the newly unemployed, with 
no offices to report to the next day, to come out to party, especially 
on weekends, dancing until the metro opens at 6 a.m. ``I was fired 
from the advertising company I worked for a few weeks ago,'' said 
Masha Kuznetsova, who was at the Jazz Kafe in a tank top, navel ring 
and tinted pink glasses. ``So what? I'm not going to stay home and 
eat sausages, am I?'' She believes that Russians are whooping it up 
even more now that the Russian Titanic has hit the iceberg. ``It's 
our Russian soul,'' she said. ``We turn to vodka in times of crisis.'' 
With shots of vodka promoted at a post-crisis discount of $1 at many 
clubs, the revelry actually seems to have gone up a notch. Call it 
the last days of Pompeii. At a recent bash in a raw, plaster-strewn 
space that was to have been an upscale cigar bar until funds ran out, 
actors dressed as bums panhandled, while models handed out papyrosi, 
cheap hand-rolled cigarettes. ``Our mood and the mood of the economy 
are not necessarily in synch,'' Masha Repina, an anchor with the Russian 
television station NTV, said at the Jazz Kafe. ``Moscow was getting 
boring for a while; now it's exciting again.'' The Jazz Kafe has had 
no need to adopt an anti-crisis theme; it is still Moscow's hottest 
club a year and a half after its opening. Some compare it to Studio 
54 in its heyday. The designer Alexander McQueen held a private party 
there last winter, the night before mounting a show of his fall collection 
for Givenchy in a Moscow metro station. The Pet Shop Boys have drifted 
through on visits. There was even a sighting of Leonardo DiCaprio 
recently. The Serb managers, Lazarovich and a fellow Belgrade transplant, 
Vladimir Ostojic, work the crowd, handing out membership cards to 
the bold and beautiful of Moscow. They recently branched out to open 
a cafe and fashion boutique near Red Square, despite the hard times. 
Even more gilt-edged than the Jazz Kafe, it features uniformed waiters 
and a high degree of Euro-snobism _ no beer and no American-style 
coffee are on the menu. The intent is to make ``Dorian Gray envious,'' 
Lazarovich boasted. Not to mention the masses of Russians struggling 
to survive. But the few who have made the Jazz Kafe the focal point 
of their lives are in no mood to scale back yet. ``These people can't 
go back to drinking around the kitchen table,'' said Gelman, the television 
producer. ``They might have lost their jobs, but they haven't lost 
their social status. And that's more important for us.''
