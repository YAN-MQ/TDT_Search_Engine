Good news on employment. Even though manufacturing layoffs continue. 
I'm Myron Kandel at the cnnfn newsdesk in New York with this edition 
of "Dollars & Sense." The unemployment rate fell in November to 4.4%, 
the lowest level since last spring. And job creation was surprisingly 
strong, 267,000 new jobs were created. Helped by a boom in the construction 
and holiday retail industries. That more than offset continued weakness 
in manufacturing. Overall, economists say the strong employment report 
may mean the federal reserve will not cut interest rates again when 
its policymakers meet later this month. Still, corporate America continues 
to swing the job cutting ax. Johnson & Johnson will eliminate 4,100 
jobs, more than 4% of its workforce. The cuts will come over the next 
18 months as the health care giant closes 36 factories. How do we 
reconcile strong job growth on one hand, and big layoffs on the other? 
Underlying all of this is very strong productivity gains and efficiency 
gains. And also deflationary pressures emanating from those productivity 
gains. That's forcing big mergers, that's forcing people to try to 
deal with falling prices and layoffs are one of the ways to try to 
keep profit growth up when your prices of output are falling. In total, 
about 36,000 job cuts were announced just this week. That includes 
cutbacks from such companies as Boeing, Exxon, mobil, and bankAmerica.
