forecast for Saturday. As the storm system pushes across the plains 
states, there will be lingering snow in the rocky mountains with some 
rain and thunderstorms out ahead of a cold front into the Mississippi

midwestern states. Another round of rain and mountain snow into northern 
California with time. Highs on Saturday, 20s and 30s over northern
