Few novels of late have made the transition to the stage as gracefully 
as ``Prater Violet,'' Christopher Isherwood's semiautobiographical 
account of his exploits in the British film industry of the 1930s. 
In an endearing production at the Salon Theater, the director Will 
Pomerantz, who also adapted the book, stays true to Isherwood's spirit. 
The result is an evening of theater with bags of English charm. The 
play, performed by six hard-working cast members assuming a total 
of 42 roles, could hardly be more faithful to the nimble work by Isherwood, 
who also wrote ``Berlin Stories,'' on which ``Cabaret'' is based. 
The dialogue and narration in ``Prater Violet'' are lifted virtually 
verbatim from the 127-page novella, a chronicle of the making of a 
silly movie musical in 1933 by a high-principled Austrian Jew named 
Friedrich Bergmann, who takes on Isherwood as a neophyte screenwriter. 
The author's refined command of language and clinical powers of observation 
have eased Pomerantz's burden. The characters, down to the smallest 
bit parts, are zesty creations that fill out the genially ironic plot, 
one that initially seems as frivolous as the sappy talkie, also called 
``Prater Violet,'' that they are filming on a back lot in London. 
(A prater is a town square where public festivals occur.) But as the 
relationship deepens between Bergmann (Dylan Green), worried about 
the growing power of the Nazis, and Isherwood (Kameron Steele), worried 
about the well-being of his new-found friend, so does the play. What 
begins as rather rarefied English drollery ends as a contemplation 
on the meaning of companionship. Pomerantz has a way with the period. 
Aided by Troy Hourie's sets and Lap-Chi Chu's lighting (and a cast 
that also plays stage crew), the director puts a minimum of resources 
to maximum advantage; the film studio, for instance, is brought to 
life by a few rolling flats, movie cameras and the hustle of the actors 
playing gaffers, editors and film stars. The narrator for the unspectacular 
events of this gentle piece _ the tensest moment comes when a newspaper 
headline announces turmoil in far-off Vienna, where Bergmann's wife 
and daughter remain _ is Steele, a young actor whose unflappable gentility 
makes him an appealing guide. As Bergmann, Green is poignantly anxious 
and avuncular; there's a magnetism that goes with the bluster. The 
other actors _ Frank Dowd, Laura Kachergus, John McAdams and Ashok 
Sinha _ do nicely by many of the myriad supporting roles. McAdams 
is particularly good as a nihilistic film cutter on the movie set, 
and it's fun to watch Ms. Kachergus quick-change her way through a 
dozen roles. Still, Pomerantz could have used another actor or two, 
because his players are simply unsuited to some of the parts. Ms. 
Kachergus, for example, is much too young for Isherwood's mother, 
and Dowd, though swell as a studio executive, is unconvincing as an 
old vet of a movie actor. The play, too, drags in spots, especially 
in an overlong first act, but this is a minor shortcoming. ``Prater 
Violet,'' which runs through Sunday affords another enjoyable view 
from Isherwood's perspective. PRODUCTION NOTES: `PRATER VIOLET' Adapted
