The world's largest tobacco company, Phillip Morris, is launching 
a major campaign to combat teen smoking. Critics are raising doubts 
that it will work and are questioning the company's motives. Deborah 
feyrick reports. This ad is aimed at teenagers. Its message -- smoking 
doesn't make you cool. We don't have to be different, being ourselves 
is enough. Tobacco giant Philip Morris is shelling out $100 million 
over and above the money set aside under the tobacco settlement for 
anti-smoking education. This is one of three commercials scheduled 
to hit air Monday. But will it work? These New York City high school 
students have their doubts. Kids right now, if they're going to smoke 
they're going to if they want to. It's part of personality. They're 
going to do it, the commercial isn't going to do it. Teen smoking 
is on the rise, with more than 3,000 kids every day lighting up for 
the first time, according to figures from the centers for disease 
control. Reasons include peer pressure, wanting to look grown up and 
being cool. That's a serious challenge. When it comes down to dealing 
with another person, it's not enough. Philip Morris says the new campaign 
is designed to help prevent kids from starting to smoke. But in a 
statement, the company also says it's in the best interests of its 
employees, consumers and shareholders. Advertising experts say the 
campaign also help's the tobacco company's tarnished image. Philip 
Morris has an opportunity to make themselves look a little better 
by coming out with a campaign that's anti-tobacco. Critics of the 
tobacco industry say if Philip Morris was really serious about getting 
teens to quit, they would get rid of the Marlboro man, one of the 
most popular images with young smokers. Most kids don't want to be 
like other kids, they want to be like the cool adults. As for the 
overall message of these ads, these teens say, they are more effective 
than past efforts, but they miss the boat. I know my friends aren't 
going to be encouraged by these commercials. If they stop, maybe I'll 
stop. And that would likely take more than a few commercials. Deborah 
feyerick, for CNN, New York.
