Riot police scuffled with about 100 protesters Friday as they marched 
toward Indonesia's National Monument Friday to press demands for greater 
democracy. No one was injured and no arrests were reported. Another 
300 student protesters defied warnings from the military and staged 
a noisy but peaceful street rally not far from the nearby presidential 
palace. Squads of troops and armored personnel carriers blocked the 
students, many wearing brightly colored jackets, when they marched 
to a busy intersection only a few hundred meters (yards) from the 
palace complex near Jakarta's Chinatown. They chanted anti-government 
slogans and called on the government to accelerate and extend a push 
for greater democracy. Some handed flowers to soldiers. The students 
also demanded that former authoritarian President Suharto be put on 
trial. Friday's demonstrations are the latest in a series of almost 
daily protests against President B.J. Habibie who announced Thursday 
parliamentary elections were set for June 7. Indonesia's highest legislative 
body, the People's Consultative Assembly, is to convene in August 
to select a new head of state. Habibie has also promised to step up 
an ongoing investigation into Suharto's wealth after abandoning a 
plan to set up a commission of inquiry into the old leader's affairs. 
On Wednesday more than 1,500 students broke through what should have 
been a tight security cordon and got to within a few meters (yards) 
the ornate white-columned palace. The military has warned students 
not to attempt more protests near the Dutch-built colonial mansion. 
``Demonstrations around the palace are illegal,'' said Maj. Gen. Suwandi, 
who is in charge of palace security. On Nov. 13 soldiers shot dead 
nine students when they tried to march on Parliament.
