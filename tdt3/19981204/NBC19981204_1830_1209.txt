News tonight on the race for the White House. Yes, you heard right. 
With just 699 days to go until the election, republican senator John 
ashcroft of Missouri said he's getting ready to run for president 
in 2000. He's already hedging his bets, though, saying he'll run for 
re-election to his own Senate seat at the same time. And former New 
Jersey senator Bill Bradley took his first step toward challenging 
vice President Gore for the democratic nomination, forming a Fund-raising 
committee. He says he wants to help "unleash the enormous potential 
of the American people."
