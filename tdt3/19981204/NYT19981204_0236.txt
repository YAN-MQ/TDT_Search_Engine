What's an aging, still-single former deb to do? The traditional route 
to marriage for many social types brought up in the world of debutante 
balls and Southampton summer houses is to meet a mate through introductions 
by friends or family or at country-club parties and black-tie charity 
affairs. But what happens when a woman has spent a decade or more 
in this insular world and still come up empty-handed? For many, the 
answer is a last resort so outside their social ken that it is barely 
mentionable: a matchmaking service. And the matchmaking service of 
choice for the post-deb in New York is It's Just Lunch, whose two 
offices, on East 56th Street and in the Wall Street area, have reputations 
for attracting preppy men with good manners, no facial hair and substantial 
incomes. ``It's impossible to find anyone in New York,'' said a single 
Upper East Side woman of 38 who grew up in Greenwich, Conn., and whose 
name appears on the invitations sent out by more than a half-dozen 
charitable groups. Speaking on condition of anonymity because of the 
stigma attached to a dating service by her set, she said: ``In the 
New York social scene, all the men are either married, gay or neutral. 
After a while you know everyone, and you've passed through.'' Like 
several friends from similar backgrounds, she handed over $1,000 to 
It's Just Lunch for a one-year membership or 16 lunch dates. She said 
that friends had told her that the service had many ``well-bred men'' 
as members who worked too hard to be active socially. What's more, 
the company, which matches prospects for first-name-only introductory 
dates over lunch and sometimes dinner (all Dutch), advertises a high 
success rate _ 500 marriages in New York in the last five years, it 
says. An added incentive was that It's Just Lunch plans to open a 
Connecticut office early next year. The woman and her friends are 
eagerly anticipating that the Connecticut office, which will be in 
Stamford, will collect the pool of divorces from wealthy Greenwich 
and single men from the Fortune 500 companies in Fairfield County. 
``It will be a whole new crop,'' the woman said. ``Those guys are 
well mannered, well bred.'' Daniel Dolan, the president and chief 
executive of It's Just Lunch, which was started in 1992 by Andrea 
McGinty, now his wife (yes, they met through the service), said: ``For 
some reason, I can't open up the Connecticut office fast enough. I've 
been getting so many calls. Lots of men calling.'' From a single office 
in Chicago, It's Just Lunch has grown to 30 branches around the country, 
with a membership of 20,000. In New York City, there are 2,000 members 
ranging in age from 23 to 48, with most in their late 20s to mid-30s, 
Dolan said. The company says that 40 percent of its members are men, 
60 percent women, but the imbalance becomes greater for those over 
40, with fewer men. Several women in their 30s said their dates arranged 
by the company were sporadic. The company says the average income 
of men who are clients in New York is $155,000, and of women who are 
clients, $85,000. The most common profession for the men is lawyer, 
followed by investment banker. Both men and women ``are very specific, 
very focused,'' said Tammy Korol, 28, the director in the New York 
office. ``Women want men who will stand when they walk into the room,'' 
she added. ``Men want women they can bring to a black-tie affair.'' 
One client, a man who is 42 and asked not to be identified, compared 
the service to ``a social secretary.'' ``I just can't be bothered 
doing the whole finding-a-date thing,'' he said. A management consultant, 
he spends the workweek in Manhattan and weekends at a second home 
in Fairfield County, where he sails and plays tennis at a country 
club. Most of the women he's met through the service are ``striking 
and from good backgrounds,'' he said, and he nearly married his first 
set-up. Edward Brady, a 41-year-old Upper East Sider who signed up 
a few months ago, has gone on lunch and dinner dates with different 
prospects the same day. The dates are almost always at restaurants 
where It's Just Lunch reserves tables regularly. The company says 
it strives for a romantic but not intimate atmosphere. Recently divorced, 
Brady, who works for AT&AMP;T, joined the service because he felt 
unsure how to rejoin the singles scene. ``I wanted to find a woman 
with good values, passion, intelligence and sensuality,'' he said. 
Marian Rich, an executive recruiter, wanted to find a Republican. 
They went on a first date. They clicked. And the other day at Tuscan 
Square, a restaurant on 51st Street near Fifth Avenue, they had a 
follow-up date, this time over dinner. The candles glowed. As Ms. 
Rich approached the table, Brady stood to pull back her chair.
