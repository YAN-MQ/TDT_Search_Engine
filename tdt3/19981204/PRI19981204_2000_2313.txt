Today's geography quiz takes us to Indochina to a nation where Santa 
Clause will be making the rounds this year. At first glance, this 
country with its tropical monsoon climate and communist government 
might seem a strange place for Saint Nick. There are not too many 
Christmas trees here, but plenty of Mangrove trees. Most of the Southeast 
Asian country's 76 million people are Buddhist or Dowist. But about 
10 percent are Roman Catholic. And Christmas is getting so popular, 
with the communist parties making some allowances this year, as we 
will learn when we answer our geography quiz a little later in the 
show.
