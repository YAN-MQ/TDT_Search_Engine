Ronald Perelman, the multiply married billionaire who has a very private 
office, a very private town house in Manhattan's East 60s, a very 
private estate in East Hampton, and a very private jet, will have 
to continue his fight for custody of his 3-year-old daughter in a 
very unprivate setting: open court. Overturning a decision by the 
judge who handled Perelman's divorce from his third wife, Patricia 
Duff, an appeals court ruled Friday that the custody hearings cannot 
be held behind closed doors. Ms. Duff had challenged the original 
ruling, by Acting State Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten, who 
had agreed to take testimony in private at Perelman's request. Lawyers 
for Perelman, the owner of Revlon, had opposed open hearings, arguing 
that embarrassing personal details, as well as information that might 
compromise his security, should be kept private. ``This decision upholds 
the principle of equal justice for all,'' said Rita Warner, one of 
Ms. Duff's lawyers. ``It shows conclusively that there's no different 
standard for the rich over the poor, but rather equal justice for 
all that the Constitution guarantees.'' As for Perelman, a spokesman 
said he ``certainly would have preferred that the decision not be 
overturned.'' ``He did not want to air the claims and counterclaims,'' 
said the spokesman, Howard Rubenstein. ``They each have their own 
arguments and he thought it was unseemly to air that all in public.'' 
The decision in a case listed in court records as Anonymous vs. Anonymous 
is the latest chapter in the 700-day Perelman-Duff marriage, which 
unraveled at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1996. 
At the time, friends of Ms. Duff said Perelman stormed off after an 
argument, leaving town early and leaving behind Ms. Duff and their 
daughter, Caleigh. Ms. Duff, an influential Democrat who raised considerable 
amounts of money for President Clinton, called the decision Friday 
``a big victory.'' ``From the beginning I wanted it open,'' she said, 
``because I think with a very wealthy, powerful person, it's important 
so that I can be sure that it's going to be a fair process. It's not 
a leap to think that some people might be intimidated in a closed 
situation.'' She said she was not talking about herself, but about 
potential witnesses _ and potential leaks. ``Ultimately, people will 
understand the truth if they see the whole truth, not just pieces 
of it that are leaked,'' she said. She and Ms. Warner both portrayed 
the case in terms of a struggle between rich and poor. When Ms. Warner 
was asked whether Ms. Duff was, in fact, poor, she repeated her previous 
statement that ``there's no different standard for the rich over the 
poor.'' Ms. Duff, in a separate interview, said reports that she had 
money had been ``greatly exaggerated.'' ``I don't think that I'm able 
to, that I have the resources that have been attributed to me in power 
or wealth, to affect the process,'' she said. ``There's no way I could 
compete with him.''
