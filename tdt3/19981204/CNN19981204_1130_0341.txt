The nation's largest tobacco company plans to spend $100 million to 
discourage potential smokers. Monday, Philip Morris will launch a 
campaign to convince kids that smoking isn't cool. Television ads 
will begin airing with slogans like "think, don't smoke." Big tobacco 
recently reached a settlement with 46 states that included an agreement 
to study why children smoke.
