This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Saturday. On Saturday morning, a storm is moving out 
of the Rockies into the plains states and it could produce some thunderstorms 
through the southern plains into the middle Mississippi river valley. 
Meanwhile, snow will continue in the Rockies and also over the extreme 
far northern midwestern states. There's another system pushing into 
the northwest as well, going through the day on Saturday that will 
drop through Washington and Oregon, bringing rain and mountain snow 
to that region and northern California once again. Saturday's highs 
just in the 20s and 30s from the great basin to the upper midwest. 
Also across northern New England. But much of the rest of the eastern 
and central U.S. remains on the mild side. On Sunday, we'll see snow 
over the northern Great Lakes. Showers and thunderstorms through the 
Mississippi river valley. With rain and mountain snow out west once 
again. Monday, showers and storms continue to push eastward with more 
rain moving into the northwest. And Tuesday, temperatures have cooled 
quite a bit in the east. It will be wet there and in the northwest 
as well. Don't forget, four-day forecasts, 7,200 cities, at CNN.com.
