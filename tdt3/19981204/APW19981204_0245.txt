Talks on the Middle East peace process have been held in the Swedish 
capital since 1994, trying to build on the agreements worked out in 
the secret ''Oslo Channel'' talks, officials said Friday. Shlomo Morgan, 
a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm, said the talks had 
included Yossi Beilin, a leader of the Labour Party that is now in 
the opposition in Israel, and Ahmed Qureia who is speaker of the Palestinian 
legislative assembly. At the time the Stockholm talks began, Beilin's 
party was in government, and they continued after Likud's Benjamin 
Netanyahu became prime minister, which brought a long stall in the 
peace process. ''Talks have taken place with a certain regularity,'' 
Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh told the news agency TT. ''They 
hang together _ the Oslo process and these talks.'' The Oslo talks 
led to the historic Israel-PLO peace accord. ''Nevertheless, I can't 
point to any specific results'' from the Stockholm talks, Lindh was 
quoted as saying. Morgan told The Associated Press that one of the 
results was a non-binding proposal, which had been published in the 
Israeli press, for a Palestinian capital to be established in a village 
near Jerusalem rather than in the city itself. Confirmation of the 
Stockholm talks came a day before Palestinian Yasser Arafat was scheduled 
to visit. The trip officially is to attend a meeting marking the 10th 
anniversary of Arafat's statement in Stockholm recognizing Israel's 
right to exist. However, expectations are high that Arafat may use 
the occasion to make a major policy speech outlining his vision for 
a permanent Middle East peace.
