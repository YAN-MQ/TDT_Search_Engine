Norway, the world's second largest oil exporter, plans to extend its 
voluntary oil production cuts through June 30 in a bid to counter 
a global supply glut and boost prices, the oil minister said Friday. 
Norway is not a member of OPEC, but in May cut oil production by about 
three percent until the end of this year to help the oil cartel is 
a drive to reduce supplies and boost prices. Norwegian Oil Minister 
Marit Arnstad said the government wants to continue its cuts, even 
though an OPEC meeting in Vienna last week ended without an agreement 
on bigger cuts. OPEC ministers will meet again in March. ``A continuation 
of Norwegian production regulation in the current market situation 
is important,'' Arnstad said. ``Ending the measures now could complicate 
or prevent further efforts being made by other producers.'' The Norwegian 
government estimated average daily oil production of 3.4 million barrels 
per day from its offshore fields. Arnstad said the cuts in production 
would be about 100,000 barrels per day.
