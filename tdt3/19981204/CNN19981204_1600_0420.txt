United Nations secretary-general koffi Annan is hoping to convince 
Libya to hand over two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. 
He'll meet with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi over the weekend. The 
country's official news agency says a decision to extradite the suspects 
must first be approved by the Libyan people. Flight 103 exploded over 
Lockerbie, Scotland 10 years ago this month, killing 270 people. If 
the suspects are extradited, they would be tried in the Netherlands.
