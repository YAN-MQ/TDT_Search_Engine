European Union justice and interior ministers Friday agreed to cooperate 
in handling the increasing flow of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants 
into the 15-nation bloc. A planned task force would pool ideas on 
how to limit the influx and ensure EU nations share more evenly the 
task of receiving them. ``The solidarity of Europe should not be an 
empty phrase but should become a concrete and effective policy,'' 
said Italy's Interior Minister Rosa Jervolino-Russo, whose country 
is a favored port of entry for refugees coming from the Balkans, the 
Middle East and Asia. The plan for the task force, first tabled by 
the Netherlands in October, is expected to be approved by EU foreign 
affairs ministers on Monday. The force should present a report on 
proposed joint-EU measures to a special summit on the issue scheduled 
for October 1999 in Tampere, Finland. Several member states, including 
Italy, Britain, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands have all faced 
big increases in asylum applicants over the past year. Some have set 
up tented villages to house them while asylum demands are processed. 
``This is an area where work with our European partners is essential,'' 
said British Home Secretary Jack Straw. Asylum applications have risen 
30 percent this year in Britain compared to 1997 and stand at 33,000 
for the first ten months of 1998 alone. In Belgium application are 
up by 57 percent this year and Justice Minister Tony Van Parijs said 
it was ``essential to come to quick agreement.'' Belgium was forced 
to change its asylum policy in October amid outrage over the death 
of a Nigerian woman during a deportation attempt. Overall Germany 
is the biggest recipient nation, processing some 30 percent of the 
EU's asylum cases. In November alone, 10,800 new demands were entered. 
Often, asylum seekers claiming persecution at home are deemed to have 
fled for economic reasons. Of 12,208 asylum demands wrapped up by 
German authorities in November, just 423 or 3.5 percent were accepted. 
In France and Belgium, refugees without proper papers have taken shelter 
in churches. In the Netherlands, dozens of illegal immigrants launched 
a hunger strike this week in a last-ditch attempt to pressure Dutch 
officials to grant them residency permits. Refugees seeking asylum 
in western European from Yugoslavia have doubled this year and now 
stand at some 5,600 a month. Among the tasks to be taken on the force 
will be looking at how the EU can improve the situation for potential 
asylum seekers in their country of origin.
