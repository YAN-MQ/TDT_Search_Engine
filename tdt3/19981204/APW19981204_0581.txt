Premier Costas Simitis resorted to a rare civic emergency decree Friday 
to force customs workers to end a strike that has dried up fuel supplies 
in Greece and left many without heating oil. Simitis signed an order 
for a ``civil mobilization,'' which allows the government to draft 
Greeks into service during times of national crisis. Such orders are 
usually reserved for times of war. The decree shows the determination 
of Simitis' government not to give in to labor protests against measures 
designed to earn Greece a spot in the European Union's single currency 
group by 2001. The walkout by members of the main customs workers' 
union was intended to force the government to back down on plans to 
unify Greece's nearly 200 state pension funds. Strikers ignoring Simitis' 
order face immediate arrest. Customs workers denounced the decision, 
but said they would return to work. ``We will comply. We can't appeal 
something like this in court. It's impossible,'' said union spokesman 
Ilias Roussakis. The strike, which began Monday, has left more than 
2 million vehicles without fuel and hundreds of trucks stranded at 
the border as temperatures have fallen to near freezing in some mountainous 
parts of northern Greece. The work stoppage also forced the closure 
Friday of the main landfill serving greater Athens. Once customs officers 
return to work, it will take at least two days to fully replenish 
the fuel market. Most of Greece's gasoline and heating oil arrives 
in Greece via non-EU nations. Goods shipped from EU partners were 
not affected by the strike. The government estimated the strike cost 
Greece 8 billion drachmas (dlrs 28.3 million) a day. The customs protest 
added to the misery caused by a broad array of strikes against government 
austerity plans. In Athens, the fuel crunch had one positive result: 
easing the city's chronic traffic jams.
