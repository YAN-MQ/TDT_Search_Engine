Bill Bradley, the former New York Knicks basketball star who represented 
New Jersey for three terms in the Senate, said Friday that he planned 
to seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2000. Describing 
himself as rejuvenated in the two years since he left the Senate and 
now ``on top of his game,'' Bradley, 55, said he believed he could 
offer the leadership needed to address the nation's problems _ from 
the lack of affordable health care insurance to childhood poverty. 
``I think I can unleash the potential of the American people,'' he 
said, standing in the gymnasium of a community center here. ``I see 
the energy out there every day that makes the economy run, makes the 
technological breakthroughs. I want to turn that energy toward dealing 
with the problems in this country.'' Bradley, who resisted efforts 
by supporters to persuade him to run in 1988 and 1992, will most likely 
face a difficult fight for the nomination. Despite his celebrity and 
track record raising millions of dollars in previous campaigns, he 
will need to overcome the well-financed organization that Vice President 
Al Gore has built across the country over the last six years and Gore's 
inherent advantage as the nation's second-highest official. Another 
challenge for Bradley will be finding a message that will differentiate 
himself from Gore and other possible Democratic contenders. And Friday, 
Bradley resisted making such a distinction. ``This is not about Vice 
President Gore and me,'' he said. ``This is about telling people what 
I believe, going out and talking to people, as I have been doing for 
30 years.'' While not formally announcing his candidacy, Bradley took 
the first step toward a presidential bid Friday by formally creating 
a Bill Bradley Presidential Exploratory Committee. He will meet with 
fellow Democrats in New Jersey over the weekend to begin putting together 
the apparatus for a presidential campaign, which will be based in 
New Jersey. Early next week, he will travel to Los Angeles and San 
Francisco to meet with supporters and begin fund-raising, his aides 
said. Bradley left little doubt that he was seriously committed to 
the race. Although his family did not join him at the announcement, 
he noted that he had the full support of his wife, Ernestine, and 
his daughter, Teresa Ann, a junior at New York University. ``This 
is training camp,'' he said. ``This is when you get your team together. 
You see how you relate to each other, try to work out some plays, 
and the regular season is when you form the official campaign. I can 
tell you that I have never gone to training camp without expecting 
that I would be playing in the regular season.''
