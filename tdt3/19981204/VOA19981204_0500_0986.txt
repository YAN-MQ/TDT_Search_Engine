U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says the United States 
made serious mistakes in its Latin America policy, especially during 
the era of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Ms. Albright 
expressed regret over some past U.S. actions in the Cold War era but 
said steps are now being made to deal with the mistakes, including 
the release of previously classified documents. Her comments came 
at a southern U.S. university after a speech on human rights. She 
also defended the controversial U.S. military school that has been 
criticized for its role in training Latin American military officers 
later accused of human rights abuses.
