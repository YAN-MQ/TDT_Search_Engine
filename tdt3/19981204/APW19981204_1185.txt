Christiane Mitterwallner of Austria, never better than 19th in four 
years of World Cup racing, surprised herself and her heavily favored 
teammates Friday by winning a women's World Cup super-G. ``I was only 
hoping I could be in the top 20,'' Mitterwallner, still visibly stunned, 
said. ``I never thought about winning, never. Am I surprised? Sure, 
I'm surprised. I can't believe it.'' Renate Goetschl, who won two 
downhills for Austria last weekend in Canada, was giving interviews 
and receiving handshakes and hugs from the other skiers when Mitterwallner, 
24, moved into the gate as the 37th starter. Skiing on a sun-baked 
course that remained fast throughout the day despite soft snow, Mitterwallner 
caught everyone's attention when she reached the midway point .20 
seconds faster than Goetschl. Mitterwallner crossed the finish line 
in 1 minute, 15.64 seconds, only .05 better than Goetschl, who was 
.04 better than Germany's Martina Ertl. ``The last part, I felt was 
not too bad,'' Mitterwallner said. ``The top, it was a little difficult 
to say if I was fast or slow.'' Mitterwallner seemed confused by the 
roar that greeted her arrival, then saw with unbelieving eyes that 
her name was atop the leaderboard. She seemed almost ready to faint 
as she held her hands to her head, then sank to her knees in the snow. 
``I must look two times,'' she said. ``Sometimes you dream about it. 
I hope I can believe it in two hours.'' Since her start number was 
so late, Mitterwallner was still at the bottom of the course when 
the race began. She watched Goetschl and Ertl take the first two positions 
in the early going before taking the chairlift to the top. Mitterwallner, 
who uses the same brand of skis as Goetschl, said she'd seen how well 
they worked in training. ``I knew I could do it but a race is more 
difficult.'' Goetschl once won a super-G starting 34th and so she 
didn't take victory for granted even after it appeared no skier remained 
who could challenge. ``Maybe I win the super-G; it's not over now,'' 
Goetschl said. ``I feel really good about myself and my skiing,'' 
said Goetschl, who had a super-G get away from her last weeke when 
she missed a gate while leading. ``It was a bad mistake and I was 
really disappointed,'' she said. ``I tried to make up for that mistake 
today.'' Despite the almost tropical conditions following an overnight 
storm, many late starters followed Mitterwallner's lead and punched 
in startling results. Eight of the top 15 finishers started outside 
the top seed, with the highest being No. 46 Katie Monahan of Aspen, 
Colorado, who placed eighth. Another American, Megan Gerety of Anchorage, 
Alaska, started 35th and placed 13th. Some of the pre-race favorites 
finished well down the order. World Cup overall points leader Alexandra 
Meissnitzer of Austria, who won last week's first super-G of the season, 
settled for sixth this time. Germany's Hilde Gerg, a former World 
Cup super-G champion, was only 23rd. Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, a former 
overall champion, tied for 44th.
