American retail chains report mixed sales results in November, with 
major discount stores showing the most strength. Unseasonably warm 
weather in much of the country is slowing the sale of winter apparel. 
So far, Christmas holiday sales also seem somewhat disappointing. 
However, Diane Catilla of consultants Deloitte & Touche hopes that 
sales will pick up strongly later in the month. Some of the general 
merchandisers in the season aren't doing that well. Come the 24th, 
when people realize they haven't purchased all their gifts yet, I 
think they will be out there buying what they need to finish up their 
shopping. Many U.S. retailers rely on sales during the year-end holiday 
season to buttress their earnings for the entire year.
