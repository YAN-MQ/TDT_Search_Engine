The United States and North Korea have opened two days of talks in 
New York in a U.S. bid to gain access to a suspected underground nuclear 
facility near P'yongyang. VOA correspondent Elaine Johannson has details 
from New York. U.S. and North Korean delegates are meeting at an undisclosed 
location in New York. The talks will move to Washington on Monday 
for another two days of discussions. No announcements are expected 
until then if at all. Tensions have grown between the United States 
and North Korea since North Korea's alleged missile launch over Japan 
last August. North Korea maintains that it launched a rocket to put 
a satellite into orbit. Japan insists that it was a long range ballistic 
missile. In any case U.S. officials are no longer sure that North 
Korea is complying with the 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons 
program in exchange for two advanced nuclear reactors that could not 
easily produce weapons grade plutonium. The United States wants to 
visit an underground sight near the North Korean capitol. Talk in 
P'yongyang last month broke down after the North Koreans demanded 
$300 million for permission to inspect the area. A U.S. official close 
to the talks says that the United States takes this new round of meetings 
very seriously, but he gave no indication whether the issue is any 
closer to resolution. On the eve of the talks North Korea blasted 
the United States with a barrage of insults and threats. The North 
Korean delegation is led by Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gay Guan, U.S. 
special envoy Charles Cartman is representing the United States. Elaine
