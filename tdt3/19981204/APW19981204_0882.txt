The sinking ruble headed toward its lowest level since a financial 
meltdown this summer, and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Friday 
that the country's reforms were imperiled by the shrinking economy. 
Primakov's government desperately wants to stabilize the economy as 
Russia heads into the difficult winter months. But with President 
Boris Yeltsin hospitalized and Primakov struggling to implement a 
recovery plan, the economy is still foundering and susceptible to 
additional shocks. ``If there is no social and economic stability 
in Russia ... then any (further) reforms are out of the question,'' 
Primakov told a session of the the World Economic Forum, a Swiss-based 
organization. Primakov stressed that the government was still committed 
to market reforms, and noted that it had not intervened to fix the 
ruble rate or restrict the flow of dollars, as some had suggested. 
But he acknowledged that the loss of confidence in the economy had 
given the government little room to maneuver. ``In such conditions, 
the crisis can become permanent,'' he said. ``But the worst consequences 
of the crisis aren't the fall of the ruble, or the drop in production, 
but a total crisis of confidence between creditors and debtors, owners 
and managers, the government and the population.'' Russia is urgently 
seeking foreign help, but International Monetary Fund chief Michel 
Camdessus came and left this week without giving any signal that a 
frozen loan package will be released soon. Until the IMF acts, other 
foreign lenders are unlikely to give Russia the infusion of cash it 
needs to pay workers, pensioners and foreign creditors. The country's 
financial markets have effectively been wiped out by the economic 
crisis, which hit Russia in August after first ravaging many Asian 
economies last year. In this environment, the ruble is one of the 
leading indicators of economic confidence, and it is again on the 
decline. Many blame its fall on concerns that the government is printing 
money to pay huge wage debts _ a move almost certain to push up inflation. 
After stabilizing for a few weeks at about 16 to the dollar, the ruble 
has been falling in recent days. The official rate was down from 18.8 
on Thursday to 19.6 on Friday, and in street trading it took more 
than 20 rubles to purchase one U.S. dollar. The ruble dipped below 
20 to the dollar shortly after the country's economic crisis hit in 
August before making a modest comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to 
the dollar before the crisis. Meanwhile, the government announced 
that inflation is up more than 65 percent so far this year and is 
expected to top 70 percent by year's end. Russian inflation had been 
coming down after years of soaring prices and was expected to be in 
single digits this year until the country's economic crisis hit. If 
the government does not receive foreign assistance soon, it has said 
it would print more rubles to pay off millions of workers who haven't 
received their money for months.
