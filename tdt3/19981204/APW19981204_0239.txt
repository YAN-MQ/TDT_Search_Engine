The death toll from an earthquake that hit several remote islands 
in eastern Indonesia has jumped to 50, a newspaper reported Friday. 
The 6.5-magnitude quake rocked Mangole and adjacent islands in the 
Maluku Sea on Sunday night, flattening buildings and setting off landslides. 
Six people were initially reported killed, but the toll rose as reports 
came in from remote villages. The daily Suara Pembaruan quoted Social 
Affairs Minister Justika Baharsyah as saying that a lack of transport 
had hampered efforts to deliver assistance for the victims. ``We keep 
monitoring the number of the victims, and now, the number of dead 
victims has reach 50,'' Justika said without elaborating. Early reports 
said 27 people were killed and seven were missing. Local officials 
were not immediately available for comment. Meanwhile, a total 543 
people had been evacuated from Sonit Island, west of Mangole, Antara 
said. Most of houses on the island were ruined, said the report from 
Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi. No casualties were reported. 
Earlier, local government officials said more than 150 people were 
injured and more than 858 homes and buildings damaged on Mangole and 
neighboring Taliabu island. Mangole and Taliabu are in the Maluku 
archipelago, known as the Spice Islands in colonial times, while Sonit 
is part of Central Sulawesi. Indonesia, which is part of the so-called 
``Pacific Ring of Fire,'' is prone to earthquakes.
