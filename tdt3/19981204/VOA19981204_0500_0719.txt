At least three people were injured when a surface-to-air missile was 
accidentally launched from a military base in South Korea. The anti-aircraft 
missile was fired Friday from a base in the Western port of Inch'on 
while technicians were performing a routine equipment check. The missile 
self-destructed over Inch'on, showering hundreds of tiny metal fragments 
on to the city.
