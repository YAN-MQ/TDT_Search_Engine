The United States is denying Iraqi charges that depleted uranium shells 
used by U.S. and Britain forces during the Gulf War have sparked a 
health disaster in Southern Iraq. A U.S. spokesmen said Thursday there 
is no evidence the shells triggered increased cancer rates among Iraqi 
children. The U.S. official says Iraq may have caused the cancer itself 
by using of mustard gas and other deadly chemicals against its own 
people during the Iran-Iraq war.
