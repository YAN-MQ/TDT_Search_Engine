The space shuttle "Endeavour" launches successfully from the Kennedy 
Space Center this morning, carrying the first component for building 
the international space station. Britain and France sealed an accord 
for military cooperation amid concerns that Europe reacts too slowly 
to crises, such as the one in Kosovo. Israeli leader Netanyahu defies 
the United States and says he won't implement the Wye River peace 
accord until he gets what he wants from the Palestinians. U.S. authorities 
warn North Korea not to test launch any more missiles. In music news, 
Hootie & the Blowfish do a Christmas tour for U.S. troops abroad. 
I'm Charlene Porter. And I'm Paul Westpheling. Details on those stories, 
sports, business, and a visit to an historic town in the State of 
New Mexico all in this hour of VOA News Now. The hour starts with 
the news. I'm David Chadwick, VOA News.
