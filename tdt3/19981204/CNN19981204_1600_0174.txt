Republican members of the house Judiciary committee want a list of 
witnesses scheduled to defend the president next week. Chief GOP counsel 
Thomas Mooney sent a letter to the president's attorneys asking them 
to provide both the list and time requirements by today. White House 
spokesman Joe Lockhart says the actual charges against the president 
are unclear. Articles of impeachment are still being drafted by the 
committee staff.
