A tobacco story that is impossible to ignore. The country's largest 
tobacco company, Philip Morris, says it is going to spend $100 million 
next year to discourage kids from smoking. More than half of that 
will go to a television campaign. Here is ABC's barrie Serafin. The 
last tobacco company ads to appear on television were meant to make 
smoking appear pleasurable. If it's Philip Morris, king size or regular, 
your throat can tell it's america's finest cigarette. But cigarette 
ads on television were banned in 1971. The new Philip Morris ads, 
scheduled to start Monday, bear a different message, designed to discourage 
teenage smoking. So you want to know why I've decided not to smoke? 
Which reason would you like? I don't need to smoke to prove myself. 
My coolness is not on trial here. I don't smoke because sometimes 
it's what you don't do that makes you who you are. Why is the company 
launching a campaign to reduce teen smoking? Philip Morris officials 
declined to be interviewed, but released this statement. At Philip 
Morris, it's important for us to tackle the issue of youth smoking 
because it's important to our employees, it's important to our consumers 
and, frankly, it's important to our business. And we need to bring 
the youth incidence down. But critics say Philip Morris is trying 
to spruce up its image, especially in Congress where it and other 
companies still face possible legislation to regulate tobacco. I don't 
know if it will Stahl action but I think it will make them look better 
on Capitol Hill. They will look more responsible an they'll have their 
allies on Capitol Hill taughting this. It invites questions about 
its motives. But Philip Morris says when it comes to teenagers, it 
is committed to reducing smoking. Barry Serafin, ABC News, Washington.
