A federal judge has found that prosecutors from the independent council's 
office did not abuse Monica Lewinski's rights when they first confronted 
her on January 16. NPR's Barbara Bradley has more. How the prosecutors 
treated Lewinski at the Ritz Carlton Hotel has been fodder for some 
of the strongest Democratic attacks against the independent counsel. 
The President's lawyers and House Democrats have said that prosecutors 
repeatedly refused to let her call her lawyer. But in a ruling unsealed 
yesterday, Federal Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, found the opposite. 
She said the prosecutors gave Lewinski several chances to call anyone 
she chose and the judge concluded that the prosecutors acted within 
the ethical rules in questioning Lewinski without a lawyer. Judge 
Johnson did express concern about one tactic. The prosecutors may 
have tried to negotiate an immunity deal with Lewinski without a lawyer 
present. But Johnson said she would not take any action. Barbara Bradley, 
NPR News, Washington.
