Usually our report Usually our report on "cutting edge" technology 
has a fairly futuristic edge to it. Tonight, while it is certainly 
the future we are looking at, high-tech it is not. ABC's Richard Gizbert 
gets it cranked up in south Africa. This is a story about power, the 
power of an idea. British inventor Trevor bayliss thought a windup 
radio would be tailor-made for Africa, where electricity is scarce 
and batteries are expensive. A south African company, baygen, bought 
into the idea but found the cost of the radio was too high for the 
African market. End of story? Hardly. Because baygen was already building 
on bayliss' idea and looking beyond africa. They've made a windup 
flashlight. 30 seconds cranking buys you 7 minutes of light, courtesy 
of the same bayliss generator the radio has. It's the engine of windup 
technology, and it's low-tech look is deceptive. This crank and the 
spring it's connected to are definitely low-tech. But there are a 
few high-tech bits in here that have been crucial in transforming 
what was an inspired but very basic idea into something that people 
would actually buy. There's a solar panel for sunny days and electronics 
that store power and regulate the spring, so it only unwinds when 
necessary, preserving energy. These changes make the new radio more 
marketable. Crank it up and it plays for an hour, twice as long as 
the original model. More products are coming. The U.S. military isooki 
at windup laine detector but the application that really has them 
excited around here is this one. This laptop computer is running off 
the energy generated in this flashlight. In effect turning the flashlight 
into? A generator. Absolutely. a windup generator that could connect 
to and power any battery-operated device anywhere. The technology 
is there and can be adapted to any product. The more they build and 
sell in the first world, the cheaper the radio becomes for the third 
world. And that would be the realization of a simple idea, which has 
since spun off into an industry. Richard Gizbert, ABC News, cape town, 
south Africa.
