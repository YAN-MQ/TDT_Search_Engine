Quickly a story out of Washington through the associated press that 
a Government psychiatrist has concluded that the man guilty of the 
-- found guilty of the -- charged rather with the killing of two police 
officers inside the capitol building last summer is not mentally competent 
to stand trial. This is according to a federal judge. Russell Weston 
Jr., you may recall, is his name. The government appears to be agreeing 
with the initial diagnosis that he is a paranoid schizophrenic. Again, 
he is accused in the shooting that killed two police officers who 
were later remembered inside the rotunda of the capitol. Not competent 
to stand trial apparently in this case, according to the associated 
press.
