The World Court said Friday it won't wade into a fisheries dispute 
between Canada and Spain sparked by the Canadians' dramatic high-seas 
seizure of a Spanish trawler in 1995. By a vote of 12 to 5, the United 
Nations' highest judicial body said it lacks the authority to get 
involved in the case, which Spain brought against Canada, because 
the two countries disagree on the basis for their dispute. ``The court 
consequently has no jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the case,'' 
the judges said. There was no immediate reaction. The tussle was triggered 
by the highly publicized seizure of the Spanish trawler Estai in international 
waters by Canadian officials in March 1995. The Canadians had fired 
warning shots and arrested the Estai's captain. Spain claims the incident, 
which occurred in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, violated international 
laws which protect freedom of navigation and freedom of fishing on 
the high seas. It has accused Canada of ``armed coercion.'' The Estai 
was also flying the Spanish flag, which meant it was under Spanish 
and not Canadian jurisdiction, Madrid contends. It has demanded unspecified 
compensation. Canada contends the boat was fishing for endangered 
turbot, was using small-mesh gear and was underreporting its catch. 
Canadian authorities made the arrest based on the Canadian Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act of 1994, which gives officials the power 
to manage fish stocks in areas that straddle international boundaries. 
Friday's ruling was sure to please Canada, which argued in initial 
public hearings in June that the U.N. court lacked the authority to 
get involved. The World Court, officially known as the International 
Court of Justice, has no enforcement powers and relies on states to 
comply voluntarily with its rulings.
