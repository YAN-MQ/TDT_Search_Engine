Australian police plan to formally charge a suspended tax worker in 
connection with sending letter bombs to government officials. One 
of the packages injured two mail sorters. Hugh Williams reports, a 
sexual harassment charge may be behind the bombs. The search for a 
man police believe is responsible for what is described as Australia's 
worst-ever terrorist campaign ended Friday when a 43-year-old plan 
was arrested at a can ber yeah hospital. Colin George dunston had 
been admitted for treatment when hospital staff alerted police. Dunston 
was reported to be in stable condition. Police have not yet questioned 
him, but authorities say they will charge him Saturday morning. Australia's 
tax commissioner says he is a suspended employee of the taxation office. 
And police describe him as being angry over sexual harassment allegations 
that have been made against him. This may provide the motive for a 
series of letter bombs, mostly targeting former and current staff 
of the Australian taxation office. A total of 27 letter bombs have 
been discovered so far across Australia, including one found Friday 
in a Sydney post office. It was safely detonated by police without 
injury. The mail bombs also triggered a number of false alarms, which 
led to the evacuations of office buildings and other disruptions. 
Post offices across the country continue to scrutinize packages and 
have tightened security. A nationwide alert still exists for the public 
to continue to watch out for suspicious packages as police warn there 
still may be bombs yet to be recovered. Postal and tax workers don't 
know yet whether to breathe a Sigh of relief. A prime suspect may 
nb custody, but it has not yet been determined if he is, in fact, 
the man responsible for the mail bombs. Hugh Williams for CNN, Sydney.
