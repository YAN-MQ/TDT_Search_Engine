Premier Costas Simitis resorted to a rare civic emergency decree Friday 
to force customs workers to end a strike that has dried up fuel supplies 
and left many Greeks without heating oil. Simitis signed an order 
for a ``civil mobilization,'' which allows the government to draft 
Greeks into service during times of national crisis. Such orders are 
usually issued in times of war. The decree shows the determination 
of Simitis' government not to give in to labor protests against belt-tightening 
measures designed to earn Greece a spot in the European Union's single 
currency group by 2001. Strikers ignoring the order face immediate 
arrest. Customs workers denounced the decision, but said they would 
return to work. ``We will comply. We can't appeal something like this 
in court. It's impossible,'' said union spokesman Ilias Roussakis.
