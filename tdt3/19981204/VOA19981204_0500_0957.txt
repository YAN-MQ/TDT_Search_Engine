Here in the United States, a U.S. congressional report has sharply 
criticized Citibank for transferring up to $100 million in alleged 
drug money for the brother of the former Mexican president. "The Washington 
Post" quotes the General Accounting Office report as saying the second 
largest U.S. bank failed to follow its own procedures by not looking 
into the background and the source of the funds. A Citibank spokesman 
denied any wrongdoing and said the bank is cooperating fully.
