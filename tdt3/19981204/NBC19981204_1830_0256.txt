One of the reasons this is expected to be a strong Christmas buying 
season is that there are real bargains and cheap gas to get to them. 
Consider the world of electronics, stereos and all the other high-tech 
toys. Here's NBC's George Lewis. a bargain bonanza for shoppers. Cheap 
prices for all sorts of electronic gadgets. Today in New York, you 
could get a VCR for $89 and a stereo for $179. I would say I spent 
$50 to $100 less than what I expected to. And in Atlanta, you could 
buy a digital videodisc player for $299 and a computer for $499. You 
can get quite a lot for your money. One reason for all the bargains, 
the Asian economic crisis. Asian electronics companies are trying 
to unload their goods in the U.S. at low prices because the bottom 
has dropped out of the consumer market in the far east. Alex Martinez 
manages the affordable portables store in Pasadena, california. The 
problem is in Japan and Asia. The cost to the retailer to purchase 
it is less expensive, and we pass on that savings to the consumer. 
Another reason for the low prices is that electronic components, such 
as microchips, keep getting more powerful and cheaper as they're produced 
in greater quantities. Visioneer is a company that makes scanners 
for personal computers. Two years ago, a scanner that I sold for $1,000 
was slower and probably, had worse color than a scanner today that 
I sell for $99. While the low prices mean tough times for Asian hi-tech 
companies, analysts say that electronic retailers here are doing great. 
I think it's a pretty exciting xmas for the consumer electronics retailers 
right now. They're all showing. Just today, circuit city had a very 
strong sales number for November. Best buy had very strong numbers 
as well. While economists worry about whether the Asian crisis will 
drag down the U.S. economy, in the long term, those concerns seem 
very remote to christmas shoppers rushing to snap up the latest, greatest 
electronic gadgets. George Lewis, NBC news, Glendale, California.
