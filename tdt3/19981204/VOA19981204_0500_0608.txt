U.S. officials are warning North Korea not to test launch more missiles. 
The warning comes in advance of today's new round of nuclear talks 
in New York between the United States and Pyongyang. VOA's Jim Randall 
has more from the Pentagon. Japanese officials confirm U.S. and Japanese 
newspaper reports that North Korean technicians are making preparations 
for another missile test. The preparations are said to be similar 
to activities that took place before a test launch in August. That 
one sent a three-stage rocket across Japan and much of the Pacific. 
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon says a North Korean test would be no 
surprise because the reclusive country has tested missiles in the 
past. So it wouldn't be hugely surprising if they were to have another 
test. It would, however, be very disappointing if they were to test 
again because we've urged them not to proceed with tests and we've 
urged them not to proceed with missile sales to other countries as 
well. Mr. Bacon called North Korea missile tests destabilizing. U.S. 
officials warn new test launches could have serious consequences for 
relations between Washington and Pyongyang. Meantime, the United States 
and North Korea are set to resume talks in New York Friday on access 
to a suspected underground nuclear facility near Pyongyang. Talks 
in Pyongyang broke down last month after North Korea demanded $300 
million for access to the site. U.S. officials called the demand ridiculous 
and say they must have access to verify North Korea's compliance with 
a 1994 nuclear accord. In that deal, North Korea agreed to shut down 
nuclear reactors thought to be making nuclear weapons materials in 
exchange for new reactors designed to make electricity rather than 
bombs. The new reactors are mostly funded by North Korea's worried 
neighbors, South Korea and Japan. Jim Randall, VOA News at the Pentagon.
