Government investigators reportedly have found evidence citibank transferred 
up to $100 million in alleged drug money for the brother of a Former 
Mexican president. According to published reports, the general accounting 
office says citibank didn't follow its own procedures against money 
laundering. Officials tell "The Washington Post" the findings could 
lead to congressional hearings on the nation's second largest bank. 
The funds in question belonged to Raul Salinas, who is currently in 
prison on charges of masterminding the murder of a ruling party official. 
A citibank spokesman says the Gao report "contains errors of facts 
and interpretation." But he says citibank would cooperate with authorities.
