U.S. stock prices were down sharply yesterday despite the decision 
by the 11 members of the EU's common currency to cut interest rates. 
That's a move that usually benefits stocks, but traders say investors 
see the move as indicative of the deep concern among monetary authorities 
over the global financial situation. In fact, Allen Sinai, chief global 
economist at Primark Decision Economics in Boston, says he doesn't 
see the situation improving a great deal for quite a while. I think 
the economic numbers in Japan and Asia will be very bad for another 
couple -- two or three quarters, will continue to have deflationary 
pressure. The economic numbers out of Latin America will also be very, 
very weak. Brazil, in particular, moving into a recession, presumably 
have to devalue. Canada's slowing down. In the U.K., you're going 
to flirt with recession. Europe's growth rate is locked into a slower 
path for two or three quarters. And the U.S. -- well, our growth is 
going to slow down, too. Economist Allen Sinai says that central banks 
are on the right track in trying to promote growth with lower interest 
rates. He says, though, that he doesn't expect a full recovery in 
Japan and Asia until sometime in the year 2000. The concern about 
a global slowdown hit U.S. investors with the fear it will cut demand 
for U.S. goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2 percent, 
off 185 points, to 8,879.
