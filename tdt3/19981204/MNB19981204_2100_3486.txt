Let us take a look at the morning papers. Tomorrow morning aoss the 
country, we begin in Dallas, Texas. More is now known about the death 
of death row inmate who escaped -- Martin gurule in Texas. You recall 
it was our lead story here last night. He was found dead on the banks 
of a river. It turns out he used magazines and elastic bandages on 
his arms to protect himself from the razor wire, 10-foot tall wall 
he had to climb to escape. Cardboard taped to his torso. All of this 
added up to give him too much weight. He drowned when it all got wet. 
It dragged his body under when he was trying to cross a body of water, 
in this case a river. "Seattle post-intelligencer", army general John 
Stanford, known best as the head of Seattle schools, he had died after 
a seven-Mon battle with leukemia. And front page "Chicago tribune," 
records falling all over the place. New record in Chicago today -- 
66 degrees. Tomorrow's forecast, 70. It's December. Before we go here 
tonight, a reminder, coming up next on "weekend magazine with stone 
Phillips", a story about how brain surgery has changed the lives of 
so many different Parkinson's patients. That is our broadcast for 
this Friday night. We hope to see you right back here at this same 
time Monday. I'm Brian Williams. Good night, everybody.
