Israeli warplanes twice attacked suspected guerrilla positions in 
South Lebanon Friday for the second day, Lebanese security officials 
said. Also Friday, Hezbollah guerrillas wounded a pro-Israeli militiaman 
in an attack on outpost of the South Lebanon Army militia in the eastern 
sector of the Israeli-occupied zone, the officials said. In a separate 
incident, two Israeli soldiers and an SLA militiaman were injured 
when they mistakenly opened fire on each other in the occupied zone, 
an Israeli military spokesman said in Jerusalem. Two Israeli jets 
fired at least two missiles at targets in a valley between the villages 
of Habboush and Arab Salim, five kilometers (three miles) north of 
this southern market town, the Lebanese officials said, speaking on 
customary condition of anonymity. About midnight Friday night (2200GMT), 
Israeli fighter jets fired two missiles in one run on a valley near 
the front line village of Zillaya, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) 
northeast of Nabatiyeh, the officials said. The jets returned 10 minutes 
later to fire two more missiles on suspected guerrilla gun positions 
in the same area. There was no immediate word on casualties from the 
air raids. The targeted areas are believed to be used by the Iranian-backed 
Hezbollah to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese 
militiamen in the occupied zone. Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected 
guerrilla positions in the south almost daily and guerrillas have 
launched scores of attacks against Israeli and allied forces in the 
area since early November. Hezbollah guerrillas have been waging a 
guerrilla war to oust an estimated 1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 
2,500 allied militiamen from the zone. Israel set up the zone in 1985, 
maintaining it was necessary to protect its northern territory from 
guerrilla attacks.
