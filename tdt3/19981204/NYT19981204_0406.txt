Freddie Young, one of the world's most respected cinematographers, 
whose work included an elaborate series of dissolves for the montage 
that opens Alfred Hitchcock's ``Blackmail,'' Britain's first talkie, 
and the famous three-minute shot in David Lean's ``Lawrence of Arabia'' 
in which Omar Sharif slowly emerges from the shimmering desert haze, 
died on Dec. 1, his family said. He was 96. In his long and distinguished 
career, Young had a reputation for being a consummate professional, 
a craftsman who strove to recreate the simplicity of real life on 
film and who believed that filmmaking was a collaborative effort in 
which his job was to serve, and enhance if possible, the director's 
vision. His talents were well recognized: He was a nominee many times 
for Academy Awards for cinematography, and a winner three times: for 
``Lawrence of Arabia'' (1962), ``Dr. Zhivago'' (1965) and ``Ryan's 
Daughter'' (1970), all directed by Lean. Young was born in London 
in 1902, the seventh of eight children. His family was poor, so he 
left school at the age of 14 to work in a munitions factory, helping 
make hand grenades. But he hated it, and _ inspired by frequent trips 
to the movies with his brother Bill _ knocked on the door at Gaumont 
Studios, a London studio now defunct, and was hired to work in the 
film lab. He quickly advanced to lab manager. When the studio closed, 
he joined British and Dominions, the film company run by Herbert Wilcox. 
Eager to do anything, he occasionally worked as a stuntman in films 
like ``Rob Roy'' (1922), in which he plunged from a 50-foot castle 
wall, and ``Triumph of the Rat'' (1926), where he was the stunt double 
for the actor Ivor Novello, hurling himself through Paris traffic. 
In the 1930s, he was chief cameraman for many of Wilcox's films, including 
``The Blue Danube'' (1932) and ``Goodbye Mr. Chips'' (1939). After 
spending World War II making films for the Army Film Unit, Young became 
chief cameraman of MGM's British arm, working with such directors 
as John Ford, King Vidor and George Cukor. He met Lean, beginning 
what would be a long and fruitful collaboration, when the two worked 
together on ``Major Barbara'' (1941), the film version of Shaw's play. 
But the relationship wasn't always easy: After one particularly harsh 
command from Lean, Young looked at him coolly and said, ``Don't teach 
your grandmother to suck eggs.'' Though Young tended to grumble that 
Lean never gave him enough credit, some years later the director wrote 
flatteringly to him about their work together. ``For the most part, 
I will give you a setup, fiddle around with the props, talk to the 
actors and go and have a cup of tea,'' Lean said. ``I know a bit about 
lenses, consider myself rather bright about composition and, at a 
pinch, make a suggestion or minor criticism about lighting, but on 
the whole you're a lonely man left to your own devices.'' Young married 
his first wife, Marjorie, in 1927; she died in 1963. He is survived 
by his second wife, Joan, and three children. The ever-energetic Young 
worked late into his life, and came out of retirement at the age of 
82 to direct ``Arthur's Hallowed Ground'' for television. But mostly 
he spent his final years painting, which he adored. ``I'm creating 
pictures with a paintbrush with nobody to interfere with my work,'' 
he wrote in his autobiography, ``Seventy Light Years: A Life in Movies,'' 
which is to be published in Britain by Faber &AMP; Faber next year. 
``It's marvelous.''
