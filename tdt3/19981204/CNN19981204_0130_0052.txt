Authorities in Huntsville, Texas, have discovered the body of escaped 
death row inmate Martin gurule. A massive manhunt for him began last 
Thursday when he and six other inmates hacksawed their way through 
a prison fence. The other six were apprehended as they made their 
escape. Gurule's body was found under a river bridge about a mile 
from the prison. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause 
of death. I think we're relieved. This was an issue of public safety. 
We knew as long as we had a death row inmate outside of our compound 
that there was a potential public risk. And we know now that that 
public risk has ended. Gurule was the first person to break out of 
death row in Texas since 1934.
