President Clinton has reacted positively to upbeat reports about the 
U.S. economy, but he says more needs to be done to stabilize the global 
economy and insure continued growth. The World's David LaValley reports. 
Today's economic news showed the nation's jobless rate dropped 2/10 
of a point in October to 4.4 percent. Labor analysts say lay-offs 
in manufacturing were offset by a vigorous construction industry and 
by Christmas holiday hiring at retail department stores. That news 
does not do much to help the first few hundred aircraft workers who 
got the ax today at Boeing. But there is nothing like rosy economic 
figures to buoy a president's spirits. At the White House, President 
Clinton said he feels great about the economic news, though he did 
express concern about the need to stabilize the shaky global economy 
that has been feeling the effects of the Asian economic crisis and 
Russia's money troubles. For The World, I am David LaValley.
