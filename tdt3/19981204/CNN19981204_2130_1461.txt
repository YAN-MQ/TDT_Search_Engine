This big fish didn't get away. Fisherman James laster says it took 
him 30 minutes to reel in a 98 1/2-pound catfish from lake Palestine, 
near Tyler, Texas. He named it "Taylor," after his 9-year-old grandson. 
For now, the catfish is spending its days in an aquarium at the Texas 
state fish hatchery.
