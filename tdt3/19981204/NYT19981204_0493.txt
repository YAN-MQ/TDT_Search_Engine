Waleska Williams watched her husband field questions Friday from the 
back of a huge room at the All-Star Cafe in midtown Manhattan. The 
news conference had been put off until this week as Bernie Williams, 
his agent, Scott Boras, and the Yankees finalized a whopping deal 
that presumably will keep Williams a Yankee for the rest of his career. 
The deal: 7 years, $87.5 million. While Williams spoke with typical 
understatement and mostly relief, Waleska said Friday was a day of 
triumph not simply for her husband, but for the family: Her and her 
husband of eight years; their 8-year-old son, Bernie Alexander, and 
two daughters, Beatrice Noemi, 4, and Bianca, 3. She recalled the 
day before Thanksgiving when Williams returned from Tampa after a 
meeting in which the Yankees said they would not match Boston's offer. 
``I saw the pain in his eyes when he came back,'' she recalled. ``That's 
the saddest I've seen this man in eight years. So I see this as a 
victory because he has worked very, very hard.'' Waleska recalled 
the birth of their youngest child on Sept. 14, 1995, the day after 
Williams' birthday. The Yankees strongly suggested that Williams stay 
with the team for something extra, and because of that and a hurricane, 
Williams did not reach his family in Puerto Rico until 10 days after 
the birth. ``I was very hurt and I told him, `You were there for them 
but not for me,''' she said. ``But I know that's the kind of commitment 
he had for the Yankees and he expected that same type of commitment 
from them.'' But, according to Waleska, this contract was a triumph 
that went beyond money to the strengthening of a marriage which, like 
so many sports unions, had been tested by time, by distance, by living 
arrangements that had Williams living away from the family beginning 
in spring training. Every season, Waleska remained in Puerto Rico 
with the children. The long-term security of this contract will allow 
the Williamses to move to New York, to live under the same roof for 
the first time in Williams' Yankee career. ``With me going back to 
Puerto Rico, those family ties and family connections are strained,'' 
she said. ``He could just put us behind: `I have to go to spring training. 
I'll see you in December. I'll see you in two weeks.' It's hard for 
him to stay connected. This was a very big decision for us because 
it was not only where he was going to play, but where we are going 
to live for the next seven years. There's no more going back and forth 
to Puerto Rico; we're settling here, raising our kids here.'' Spouses 
often carry the burdens _ and joys _ of maintaining the household 
while the athletes indulge a fragile, fantasy-land existence of work 
and play. ``This life is either going to break you up as soon as possible, 
or you can pretend nothing is going on and say, `Oh, well, I'll just 
enjoy it while it lasts,''' she said. ``Or you can really work, and 
that's the most challenging. A lot of things have happened, but I 
believe that God put me here for a reason and God gave me this partner 
for a reason and gave me to him for a reason. ``Most of the time through 
the eight years that we've been married, I was the one who stayed 
behind, was taken for granted. I told him once, `If it was just for 
the money, I could be gone and I'm already set for life.' But I'm 
here because I love this man, and when baseball is over I want to 
have the best relationship ever.'' As the afternoon finally wound 
down, the questions all raised and answered, Bernie and Waleska Williams 
left the large room at the All-Star Cafe and walked into a new, challenging 
life. Waleska recalled a piece of advice a former Yankee had given 
her husband. ``One time Reggie Jackson told Bernie: `Baseball is going 
to be over and all your friends are going to be gone, but this is 
the one person that's going to be with you after. So remember her 
through the years.' Those were the wisest words I've heard.'' Williams 
has apparently heard them, too. ``My kids aren't used to having a 
full-time daddy,'' Williams said. ``That's the most important aspect 
of this whole situation. I was tired of packing, not having an opportunity 
to see my kids grow and having this family life that I really longed 
for. You don't want to live out of a suitcase, then coming back, seeing 
your kids and trying to win them again. It was hard; it was taking 
a toll on the family life.'' Player gets money. Team gets player. 
Children get their father. Husband and wife get each other. Now that's 
what you call a good deal.
