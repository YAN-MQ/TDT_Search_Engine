In Texas tonight, the manhundred the is over. The man is dead. When 
they found the body of Martin gurule who had escaped from death row, 
he had a wound in his upper back. The autopsy showed it was a gunshot 
wound, the actual cause of death was drowning. Here's ABC's Steve 
Osunsami. The receive-day manhunt had started to become a manttexas 
W enforcement. Today, there was no hiding investigators' relief. It's 
through. It's all over. Gurule is no more. We have a clean record 
of all of our escapes now. We've got all our people back in custody. 
Gurule's body was found wrapped in heavy duty cardboard, hidden under 
his prison-issued uniform. Investigators say the makeshift body armor 
protected him as he climbed over these deadly razor-topped fences. 
It was two off-duty corrections officers gone fishing who found the 
fugitive's body under a bridge in a Creek about a mile east of the 
prison. The Texas department of corrections, or tdc, is taking comfort 
in knowing gurule never made it past the established search area. 
Ou really Don'know. I'll tell you what, the tdc was right. He never 
left the area. That's right. In fact, search teams believe the sound 
of their bloodhounds probably forced the fugitive to hide in the water. 
On Monday, prison administrators begin deciding what steps they'll 
take to prevent this from happening again. One issue is the prison 
work program that gave gurule, a death-row inmate, special privileges. 
Time outside his cell and a chance to escape. Steve Osunsami, ABC 
News, Atlanta.
