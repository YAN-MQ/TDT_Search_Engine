Former Australian tennis star Pat Cash has ripped the state of British 
tennis, saying it's a middle-class game in which the English ``don't 
have the stomach for a fight.'' Although two British players _ Tim 
Henman and Greg Rusedski _ finished the year in the top 10, Cash said 
the game needs a tougher, working-class image. ``Tim Henman's a very 
nice guy and a very good player but he has that comfortable, middle-class 
look about him,'' the 1987 Wimbledon champion was quoted as saying 
in Friday's Daily Mail. ``The only English player who seems gutsy 
enough is Greg Rusedski and that shows what I mean, because is Canadian. 
Rusedski is the hungry one. He hasn't Tim's flair but he's as tough 
as anybody. ``What tennis needs is some working-class icons, street 
kids made good and who people can identify with,'' Cash said, citing 
England soccer players Ian Wright and Paul Gascoigne as examples. 
``Even in Australia tennis is regarded as a sport for sissies but 
guys like me and Pat Rafter have shown that we have the competitive 
edge you need. ``Over here, tennis is viewed in the same way, and 
no one has done much to change that. The snobby image of the All England 
Club and Queen's Club is not much help either. If you can alter that 
image then you'll see an Ian Wright come through.'' Cash said tennis 
and cricket in Britain both suffer from the same problem. ``The thing 
about Australians is that we're always competitive and always play 
hard,'' he said. ``With the English you never know if they've got 
guts. ... The English middle class basically don't have the stomach 
for a fight.'' Cash is currently playing in the ATP Tour Seniors event 
in London.
