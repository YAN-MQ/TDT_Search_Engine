This was the scene, spectacular pictures, 3:35 A.M. eastern time this 
morning, behind the flash, lighting up the predawn sky, the space 
shuttle endeavour blasting off from the Kennedy space center in Florida 
at the cape after a one-day delay. Endeavour's mission is to start 
the long, expensive process of building the components of an international 
space station. It will be visible from earth to the naked eye. A shuttle 
will now rendezvous with the first piece of the space station as launched 
and put into space by the Russians last month.
