It appears the Japanese government is backtracking on its forecast 
that it's economy would shrink at only a 1.8-percent rate this fiscal 
year. Finance Minister Kiicho Miyazawa said yesterday the contraction 
will likely be more than that. To reach the 1.8-percent level, the 
economy would have to grow.7 percent through March, something Mr. 
Miyazawa says is difficult to achieve, although he says the government's 
economic stimulus packages are beginning to take root.
