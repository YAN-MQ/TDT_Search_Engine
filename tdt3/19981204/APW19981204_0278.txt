Customs workers came under intense pressure Friday to end a strike 
that has dried up fuel supplies, crippled transport and left many 
Greeks without heating oil as a cold wave hit. The walkout, which 
began Monday, was declared illegal by a court Friday _ the second 
such ruling this week. Meanwhile, a public prosecutor ordered the 
arrest of strikers preventing the transport of fuel already processed 
by customs. The main customs workers' union, striking against government 
social insurance fund reforms, was due to meet later Friday to consider 
calling off the protest following the court decision. The government 
has warned it could declare a national emergency and demand the workers 
return to their posts or face arrest. Most of Greece's gasoline and 
heating oil arrives in Greece via non-European Union nations. Goods 
shipped from EU partners are not affected by the strike. The customs 
protest added to the misery caused by a broad array of strikes against 
government belt-tightening measures designed to earn Greece a spot 
in the European Union's single currency group by 2001. The customs 
walkout has left cars without fuel, trucks stranded at the border 
and even forced the closure Friday of the main landfill serving greater 
Athens. Temperatures have fallen to near freezing in some mountainous 
parts of northern Greece. In Athens, the fuel crunch had one positive 
result: easing the city's chronic traffic jams.
