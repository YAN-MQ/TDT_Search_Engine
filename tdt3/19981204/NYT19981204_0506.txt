The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 5: Speculation 
about the next presidential campaign has already gone on for so long 
that some citizens may be surprised to learn that Vice President Gore 
and Gov. George Bush of Texas are not already nominated. But although 
both men would probably like to be selected by pre-emption, there 
are plenty of other Democrats and Republicans of their generation 
who are not yet willing to give up their own Oval Office dreams. After 
two years of rumination, Bill Bradley, the former Democratic senator 
from New Jersey, has formed an exploratory committee. The hills of 
New Hampshire are teeming with Republicans. Lamar Alexander apparently 
never left. Like Bradley, some high-ranking Democrats may feel they 
are running out of time to wait in line. The House minority leader, 
Richard Gephardt, is dining with Hollywood contributors and says he 
will make his decision by January. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska plans 
to announce his plans later this month. For this group of middle-aged 
pols, 2000 has a now-or-never feel. This premature politicking is 
also being driven in great part by the schedule of the next set of 
presidential primaries. It includes so many important contests during 
the first part of March that candidates who cannot raise enormous 
sums of money and establish themselves as household names in 1999 
might just as well stay home. Experts say Bradley, who has raised 
about $20 million over a long political career, will have to raise 
just as much over the next 12 months to be a serious contender. Bradley's 
entry into the presidential field is a welcome sign that Democratic 
voters will have some options, at least for a while. He comes into 
the race with his own set of advantages and disadvantages. The fact 
that he is a former star of the New York Knicks will get him some 
publicity, but it also probably means he is too tall to be anybody's 
vice president. The public may like his seriousness, and his interest 
in issues like tax simplification. But is his reputation for soporific 
speeches formidable enough to match up one on one with Gore's? We 
have no information yet on Bradley's ability to do the macarena.
