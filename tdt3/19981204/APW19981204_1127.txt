For South American club champion Vasco da Gama, Saturday's decisive 
InterAmerican Cup match against D.C. United is a chance to salvage 
a 23-day tour that has taken the team from Rio de Janeiro to Washington, 
D.C. to Tokyo and finally to Fort Lauderdale. ``We are a little tired,'' 
said the team's technical director Antonio Lopes of his 1997 Brasileiro 
champions. ``But on Saturday, we'll be OK.'' Vasco da Gama beat CONCACAF 
Cup holders D.C. United 1-0 on Nov. 14. D.C. United must win by two 
goals or more on Saturday to claim the InterAmerican title which is 
determined by aggregate score over two games. A one-goal D.C. win 
would force a 30-minute `golden goal' overtime. Failing that, the 
teams would go to a shootout. United's impressive performance in Game 
1 showed how far Major League Soccer's most successful team has progressed 
since debuting in 1996. D.C. United created more scoring chances in 
the opener, but lost on an inspired long-range goal by fancied newcomer 
Felipe. ``We would never lay claims that MLS is better than the South 
American leagues,'' said coach Bruce Arena. ``But we can say we're 
competitive with them.'' Besides determining the club champion of 
the Western Hemisphere, Saturday's game also closes out Arena's tenure 
as D.C. United coach before he takes the U.S. National Team job.
