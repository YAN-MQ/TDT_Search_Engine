Time now for the answer to today's geography quiz. We were looking 
for a socialist republic in Southeast Asia. One of the last places 
you would expect to find Santa Clause, but where the Jolly One will 
be making his rounds this Christmas. The answer is Vietnam. And that 
happens to be where a Hanoi-based travel center is offering a special 
deal. For only $2, you can have Santa, red cap and all, deliver presents 
right to your home on Christmas Eve.
