The leader of an FBI task force says there are credible signs bombing 
suspect Eric Rudolph still is hiding in the mountains of western North 
Carolina. He says there have been reports of prowlers in the area, 
missing food and dogs barking at unusual hours of the night. Rudolph 
has been charged in four attacks, including the 1996 Olympic park 
bombing in Atlanta. He has been listed as a fugitive since the January 
29th bombing of a Women's clinic in Alabama.
