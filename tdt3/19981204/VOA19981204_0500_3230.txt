United Services Organization provides support to American military 
personnel abroad. One of their traditions is to bring U.S. performers 
to perform concerts, particularly during the holidays. This year, 
the USO has asked the rock band Hootie & the Blowfish to share a little 
holiday spirit with troops stationed in Europe and the Middle East. 
VOA's Bernie Bernard spoke with members of the group on the eve of 
their departure. There's nothing I can do / I only want to be with 
you / You can call me a fool / I only want to be with you... From 
now through the 10th, Hootie & the Blowfish will be rocking military 
bases in Bahrain, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia, and Hungary. With album 
sales of more than 20 million, the group receives dozens of requests 
to play for charitable causes. Hootie's lead singer and guitarist 
Darius Rucker and guitar player Mark Bryan explain why touring for 
the USO has a special place in their hearts. We're going to play near 
aircraft carriers and stuff, and we're going places that, you know, 
most Americans never even think about getting a chance to go, and 
we get to go play a show in Bahrain for 3,000 troops, you know. I 
mean, how many chances are we really going to get to do something 
like this, something that's cool? We also -- we play, you know, hundreds 
of shows a year, but it's very rare that we get to do shows that feel 
this important, and the payoff is huge as far as that's concerned. 
It feels really good to be able to do this and make a difference with 
the thing we do every day. Aboard his ship he stops to stare / Needs 
to smell her, touch her hair / Says "I can't be without her" / Tonight 
he's going to be without her... On their USO tour, Hootie & the Blowfish 
will be playing tunes from their newly released album "Musical Chairs," 
as well as old favorites. Two years ago, the South Carolina-based 
band played one show for American troops in Hungary and has always 
wanted to return. Leader singer Darius Rucker realizes that, for the 
next week, his audience will be soldiers who live amid conflict and 
danger every day. Those people have seen things and been privy to 
things that, you know, we wouldn't believe. They're over there experiencing 
life and experiencing things, and you get over there and -- just to 
have a little piece of that with them is just a wonderful feeling, 
to know that, you know, you brought something to them, but when you 
leave, you know you got so much more from them than they could have 
gotten from you. Hootie & the Blowfish will have a chance to sign 
autographs and talk with American soldiers during their USO holiday 
tour. Hootie's Darius Rucker feels that's just as important as the 
performances. That's, for us, I think, just a super part, just talking 
to people, because everybody you meet is so willing to tell you their 
story, where they're from and, you know, who they left behind and 
what they do there, and it's just great -- a great time and a great 
thing. After their USO tour of Europe and the Middle East, Hootie 
& the Blowfish will gear up for an extensive American tour in 1999. 
I'm Bernie Bernard. Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe / 
Help to make a season bright / Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
/ Will find it hard to sleep tonight / They know that Santa's on his 
way / He's loading lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh / And every 
mother's child is...
