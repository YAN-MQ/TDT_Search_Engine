Here in the United States, the Christmas holiday season is underway. 
"The Wall Street Journal" reports that already business is brisk in 
cyberspace. The newspaper says that commerce on the Web is widely 
expected to more than double from a year earlier. The prediction is 
that over $2 billion worth of business will be conducted online this 
year. For example, iQVC, an Internet shopping site, based in Chester, 
Pennsylvania, reports that last weekend's customers ordered nearly 
$800,000 in merchandise, up from about $350,000 for the same period 
in 1997. Stuart Spiegel, iQVC's vice president, says that his company 
is becoming a viable alternative to the traffic at the shopping malls.
