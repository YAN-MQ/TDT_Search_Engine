UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, is preparing to travel to Libya 
tomorrow in an effort to bring two suspects to trial. In the 1988 
Locker v. Airline bomb case. Linda Fisulo reports from the UN. Kofi 
Annan plans to meet with Libyan President, Muammar Gaddafi, diplomats 
say his goal is to secure a date for the surrender of two suspected 
terrorists for trial in the Netherlands under Scottish law. And, in 
anticipation of a deal, the United Nations has a plane on standby 
in Italy to transport the two suspects to Europe within 24 hours. 
In August, the Security Council authorized the UN Chief to arrange 
such a transfer, but not to negotiate any new terms with Tripoli. 
Meanwhile, UN and Libyan lawyers have met regularly to discuss trial 
arrangements. The United States dismissed a Libyan statement that 
Gaddafi does not have the decision-making authority to extradite the 
two suspects. For NPR News, I am Linda Fisulo, at the United Nations.
