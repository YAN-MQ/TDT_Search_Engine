President Clinton says the vigorous U.S. economy and promising unemployment 
figures make the time ripe for another increase in minimum wage. He 
says the success of earned income tax credits and a stable inflation 
rate have been good for working families. Unemployment in November 
fell to 4.4%, the lowest level since spring. The president says this 
is not the time to become complacent. He says millions of people who 
are working full-time are living in poverty. This is not a time for 
self-congratulation or a time to rest. We have more to do here at 
home and more to stabilize the global economy if we expect growth 
to continue. We all know about the economic troubles in Asia. We all 
see sectors of America's steel industry being overwhelmed by imports 
at fire sale prices. We have all read the headlines about Boeing's 
layoffs because of the inability of Asian airlines to pay for planes 
that they have already ordered.
