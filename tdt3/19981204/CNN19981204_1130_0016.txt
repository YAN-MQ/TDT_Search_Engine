First -- the labor department issued a better than expected report 
on unemployment this morning. It said the nation's jobless rate dropped 
.2% in November to 4.4%, a Six-month low. The government says employers 
added 267,000 jobs last month. Holiday hiring at department stores 
and a boom in construction offset layoffs in manufacturing. President 
Clinton welcomed the news, but said more needs to be done. This is 
not a time for self-congratulation or a time to rest. We have more 
to do here at home and more to stabilize the global economy if we 
expect growth to continue. We all know about the economic troubles 
in Asia. We all see sectors of Americas steel industry being overwhelmed 
by imports at fire sale prices. We have all read the headlines about 
Boeing's layoffs because of Asian inability to pay for airplanes that 
they have already ordered. The unemployment report set off a rally 
in early trading on Wall Street. At this hour, looking at the Dow 
Jones industrial average, it's up 110 points at 8990.
