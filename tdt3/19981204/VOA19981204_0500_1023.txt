You're tuned to the Voice of America. I'm Charlene Porter along with 
Paul Westpheling on VOA News Now in Washington. A roaching Universal 
Time. And the top story of the hour: The U.S. space shuttle "Endeavour" 
makes a perfect liftoff Friday morning from the Kennedy Space Center 
in Florida. It's carrying the first addition to the international 
space station. Further details on that story coming up about 12 minutes 
from now.
