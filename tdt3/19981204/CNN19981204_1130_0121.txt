The space shuttle "endeavour" is now in orbit after an early morning 
launch. In the shuttle's cargo bay is the second Module of the international 
space station. On Sunday, the "endeavour" is expected to link with 
the Russian Module already in orbit. Astronauts will then connect 
the two modules, beginning construction of the space station. A third 
Module will need to be added before astronauts can live in the station. 
NASA's chief says the station is a major step towards the human habitation 
of space. If we ever expect to go to Mars or back to the Moon with 
major colonies or go to research stations on asteroids, we got to 
learn how to do this. We're going to have to assemble large structures 
in space and we can't even use our eyes. Sometimes we will have to 
use synthetic vision on video screens. This is where we want to be. 
With a projected price tag of $60 billion, the station is the most 
expensive scientific undertaking ever attempted.
