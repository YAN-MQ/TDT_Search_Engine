Even Michael Jordan couldn't save the day this time. Mj made a surprise 
visit, but the NBA owners and players endured another unsuccessful 
bargaining session on Thursday. After the 10 1/2 hour meeting, David 
Stern publicly acknowledged the possibility of canceling the entire 
season. We have, at the current time, nothing to agree on and, therefore, 
nothing to talk about. It's almost premature to talk about having 
the season. My concern is about not having the season. As I stand 
here today, it's more likely that we will not have a season, than 
we will have a season.
