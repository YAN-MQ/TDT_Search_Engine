The island's leading weekly newspaper called on voters to oust the 
ruling New National Party in an editorial Friday as Grenada moved 
toward early elections after Parliament was dissolved. The government 
of Prime Minister Keith Mitchell must be defeated to end the ``corruption 
and deceitful government'' that has brought political turmoil to the 
Caribbean nation in recent weeks, the newspaper said. Governor General 
Sir Daniel Williams dissolved Parliament on Wednesday, meaning elections 
must be held within 90 days in the former British colony. A date has 
not yet been set. On Sunday, Foreign and Legal Affairs Minister Raphael 
Fletcher resigned, accusing Mitchell's government of corruption. The 
newspaper cited Mitchell's firing of former Deputy Prime Minister 
Grace Duncan after her romance with Mitchell soured, and the dismissal 
of another junior minister. The editorial also criticized Mitchell 
for awarding ambassador-at-large posts to Viktor Korzeny, a businessman 
who allegedly amassed millions by taking advantage of privatization 
programs in his home country, the former Czechoslovakia, and Joan 
Webley, a former politician in Jamaica. Opponents of Mitchell complained 
to the United Nations earlier this year that Webley, who runs a U.N. 
program in Grenada, was also working as a political adviser to Mitchell 
instead of remaining politically neutral.
