A preliminary autopsy has found that convicted murderer, Martin Guruli, 
drowned shortly after escaping from Texas' death row last week. A 
medical examiner in Huntsville, Texas found that Guruli had a superficial 
gunshot wound in the back, but that was not the cause of his death. 
Guruli's body was found yesterday in a creek about a mile from the 
prison.
