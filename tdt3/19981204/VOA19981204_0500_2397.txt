The European Central Bank has made a surprise move by reducing interest 
rates to 3 percent in the countries that will introduce the euro currency 
on New Year's Day. VOA's Ron Pinstein reports from Brussels that the 
rate cut is three weeks earlier than expected. Ever since a center-left 
government was elected in Germany in September, the voices calling 
on the European Central Bank to lower interest rates have been getting 
louder. German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine looked admiringly 
at Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan lowering American interest 
rates. In the same breath, Mr. Lafontaine would say he is not interfering 
in the independence of the European Central Bank. Most of Europe's 
leaders now are Social Democrats, and they want lower interest rates 
to spur growth to bring down unemployment rates that hover around 
10 percent. The European Central Bank, established last May, was set 
up to fight inflation, similar to Germany's Bundesbank. Bank officials 
insisted they would not be moved by political pressure. European economic 
forecasts predict falling growth rates next year as a result of economic 
troubles in Asia and Russia. It was this factor, the Central Bank 
says, which motivated the bank to drop interest rates.3 percent to 
3 percent in the countries introducing the euro on New Year's Day. 
Italy dropped its rate to 3-1/2 percent from 4 percent. The move to 
3 percent had been widely predicted to come at the last bank meeting 
of the year December 22nd. Three percent was thought to be the best 
rate for the bank to take over monetary policy New Year's Day from 
the central banks in the 11 euro countries. It is not clear whether 
this move coming three weeks early is enough to quiet the center-left 
governments that want lower borrowing costs to help them fight unemployment. 
The bank took the step at its meeting Tuesday but did not publicize 
it until Thursday when all the central banks in the 11 countries were 
coordinated. Whether the politicians are satisfied or not, spokesmen 
for the European Central Bank expect 3 percent to remain the interest 
rate as the euro goes into service on January 1st. Ron Pinstein, VOA 
News, Brussels.
