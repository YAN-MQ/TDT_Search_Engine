"Sig" the poodle is turning heads in Sacramento, California. Many 
people are in awe of sig's ability to jump six-feet in the air. His 
owner says it confused her at first but she went ahead and let sig 
do his thing. She says sig the poodle jumps when he wants to take 
a walk, when the mail carrier comes by, or if he sees another dog.
