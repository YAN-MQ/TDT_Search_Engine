The census bureau issued its annual report today on the state of the 
country -- by the numbers. Thousands and thousands of statistics, 
a portrait of our lives. Americans as a whole are living longer. At 
the turn of the century, the average life span was 47. Today, it is 
75. Today, people live longest in Hawaii. Today, only 20% of Americans 
exercise regularly. College graduates do the most. 55% of American 
home owners who are over 65, have paid off their mortgages. 1 in 20 
children in the U.S. are living with their grandparents. New York 
still collects the most taxes, followed by California. Delaware collects 
the least. Last year, Americans spent four times more money on computers 
and other electronic devices than they did on books and maps. And 
more than 75% of all libraries are now connected to the Internet.
