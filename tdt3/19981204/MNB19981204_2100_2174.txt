When we come back, who is running now? Indications today that the 
race for president in 2000 just got a little bit more crowded, by 
two exactly. John was brilliant. We'll miss his brilliant conversations. 
John knew everything. We'll miss his knowledge. John wrote that consolidated 
contract. He didn't even tell us where he put it. Now they're really 
consumed with grief. If only they knew John scanned all of his documents... 
into the Xerox document center. He made them digital and put every 
last one of them on the company website. I wonder what John would 
do in this situation. He'd check your website to see if the Xerox 
document center... scanned in the consolidated contract. Hey, I just 
had a thought. Oh, there's a good place to start. You don't think 
John scanned the contract into the, uh, the-- the Xerox document center. 
Xerox document center, do you? John was smart, but he wasn't that 
smart. Ooohhh! I don't think John liked that. If you ask all the dermatologists 
listed here... to recommend a therapeutic shampoo, neutrogena T/gel... 
would come out #1. T/gel works on all three itchy, flaky scalp conditions. 
Neutrogena T/gel: Teddy gibbs toughs it out through the raw soar throat, 
the hacking cough, the fever. Now he needs... maximum strength theraflu. 
Fast, soothing hot liquid theraflu.
