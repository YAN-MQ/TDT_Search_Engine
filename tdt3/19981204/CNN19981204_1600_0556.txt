Texas prison officials say they have not determined whether an escaped 
death row inmate was shot to death or drowned. An autopsy is expected 
today. Two off-duty prison employees were setting up fishing lines 
when they spotted the corporation. The suspect was imprisoned because 
of a robbery killing.
