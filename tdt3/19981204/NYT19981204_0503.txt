Her first writings to reach print ran shoulder to shoulder with Ernest 
Hemingway's. For her first published poetry she was grouped with William 
Carlos Williams and Marianne Moore. She made it to Paris ahead of 
both Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. She was a leader of the University 
of Chicago school of imagist poets, and if hers is not a household 
name, by the time she died on Monday at the age of 99 in the house 
in Los Altos, Calif., that she had occupied for two-thirds of a century, 
Janet Lewis had the satisfaction of knowing she had written poetry 
throughout the 20th century and seen it published and praised in every 
decade since the first. Her reputation has seemingly been eclipsed 
by that of her late husband, Yvor Winters, the poet, professor and 
critic who wrestled Hart Crane's ``Bridge'' into print and made Stanford 
_ and Los Altos _ a magnet for three generations of poets. Yet there 
are many who will assure you that when the literary history of the 
second millennium is written at the end of the third, in the category 
of dazzling American short fiction her ``Wife of Martin Guerre'' will 
be regarded as the 20th century's ``Billy Budd'' and Janet Lewis will 
be ranked with Herman Melville. (Though, to be fair, her prose is 
more often likened to Stendhal's.) What makes her accomplishments 
even more impressive is that over the course of a career in which 
she wrote hundreds of poems, a single collection of short stories, 
a couple of children's books, a handful of novels, the words to five 
operas and one acclaimed masterpiece, Miss Lewis pursued a literary 
life in which the focus was on the life, and the life was one of such 
placid equilibrium and domestic bliss that she had to reach deep down 
in her psyche _ and far back in the annals of criminal law _ to find 
the wellspring of tension that produced some of the 20th century's 
most vividly imagined and finely wrought literature. She also had 
to find the time. As she once observed, women of prodigious literary 
output, like Willa Cather and Edith Wharton, tended not to have children. 
As the mother of two, Miss Lewis willingly put her work aside when 
her children were young and cheerfully accepted other duties as well. 
``It's a question of what you want to do with your life,'' she once 
said. ``You might also want to take care of your husband.'' The daughter 
of a poetry-spouting English professor, Miss Lewis was born in Chicago 
and grew up in Oak Park where she and her 1899 contemporary, Ernest 
Hemingway, contributed their first works to the same high school literary 
magazines, she deriving inspiration by summering even deeper in the 
north woods than he and finding a lifelong fascination with nature 
and the natural flow of life. Her sentiments were expressed in a 1922 
poetry collection, ``The Indians in the Woods,'' in a series of stories 
later included in a 1946 collection, ``Good-Bye, Son and Other Stories,'' 
and in a 1932 narrative, as she called it, ``The Invasion,'' the multigenerational 
account of a Scotch-Irish-Indian family. After two years at a junior 
college, Miss Lewis completed her education at the University of Chicago, 
majoring in French while joining the famous Poetry Club and meeting 
Winters, who had spent time at a tuberculosis sanitarium in Santa 
Fe, N.M. After a brief stay in Paris after graduation in 1920, Miss 
Lewis returned to Chicago but soon contracted tuberculosis herself 
and spent five years at the same sanitarium, engaging in a passionate 
correspondence with Winters and eventually marrying him and following 
him to California, where she threw herself into a satisfying domestic 
life that included tending to her husband's registered Airedales, 
harvesting the fruit from the adjacent orchard and serving as a sort 
of serene den mother to an extended, animated family of her husband's 
awed acolytes. One of the first and by far the fiercest and most controversial 
of the New Critics and a man of cocksure opinions, for all his fabled 
influence on 20th-century American poetry, Winters may have made his 
greatest contribution to literature when his wife, whose life was 
virtually without drama, complained that she had trouble finding suitable 
plots and he gave her a chance copy of a 19th-century compilation 
of famous old legal cases. By the time she had finished it, Miss Lewis 
had all but abandoned poetry and embarked on what turned out to be 
three short historical novels, ``The Wife of Martin Guerre'' (1941), 
``The Trial of Soren Qvist'' (1947) and ``The Ghost of Monsieur Scarron'' 
(1959), all based on actual cases and so compellingly imagined and 
told that she inspired the 1956 ``Wife of Martin Guerre'' opera by 
William Bergsman, who asked her to write the libretto. The composer 
Alva Henderson was so impressed that he got her to write the libretto 
for his 1976 opera, ``The Last of the Mohicans,'' and two others. 
The historical novels, Miss Lewis said later, represented the ``heavy 
thinking'' of a literary career that did not include her poetry. Her 
poems, she said, were always personal, a quiet corner of her life. 
Devastated by her husband's death in 1968, Miss Lewis, who never took 
his name off the mailbox and maintained his writing shed as a shrine, 
sought to deal with her grief by revisiting the Southwest, rediscovering 
her fascination with the local Indians and producing a series of memorable 
poems. For Miss Lewis, who is survived by a daughter, Joanna Thomson 
of Madison, Wis.; a son, Daniel Winters of Davis, Calif., and three 
grandchildren, her family was always more important than her work, 
and her life is well reflected in her final collection, ``The Dear 
Past'' (1994), with poems covering most of the century. Under the 
influence of her husband, she had done her share of experimenting, 
but the woman who had begun her career by taking part in the imagist 
revolution that sought to strip poetry of its former artifice, ended 
it the same way, using spare, lyrical language to describe and celebrate 
the simplest scenes of nature. For a woman who charmed generations 
of troubled poets and other literary figures with her almost otherworldly 
serenity, looking back over the domestic scenes of a long, literary 
life, it would be hard to find a more compelling image of Miss Lewis 
_ or one more evocative of the flesh-and-blood life beneath the surface 
of 20th-century literature _ than one of the many at the family's 
house after a warm, rollicking meal with the couple's dearest friends. 
You may have to close your eyes to conjure up the sight, but there 
they are forever, two 1899 contemporaries standing side by side at 
the kitchen sink, Janet Lewis washing, Vladimir Nabokov drying.
