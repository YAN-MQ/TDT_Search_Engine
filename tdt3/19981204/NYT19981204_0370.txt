A crew of 22 Pakistani seamen aboard a bedraggled and bankrupt cargo 
ship that fled Mexican waters without food or drinking water has spent 
10 days bobbing in the Gulf of Mexico, three and a half miles off 
south Texas, while bankers, shipping agents and Coast Guard officials 
try to untangle the mess. ``This could take quite awhile to resolve, 
maybe into the new year,'' said Harry Lall, president of Global Ship 
Services in New Orleans, which has spent nearly $15,000 to send food 
and fuel to the seamen, money he hopes to have reimbursed. The ship's 
owner, Tristar Shipping Lines of Karachi, Pakistan, stopped paying 
the seamen's wages nine months ago, and eventually stopped paying 
all of the ship's bills, Lall said. ``The owners have given up,'' 
he said. ``The banks have stepped in. Someone must come up with some 
money and the men must stay out on the ship until they do.'' Such 
ship abandonments are not uncommon, officials said, though they are 
rare in U.S. waters. Usually, they happen when cash-strapped shipowners 
stretch their resources to the limit until they can no longer afford 
to pay the bills their ships are accruing, a situation that appears 
to be happening in this case, said Lt. Brian Gove of the U.S. Coast 
Guard in Corpus Christi, Texas. Last month a 570-foot Panamanian freighter, 
the Fontini, was held at Long Beach, Calif., in a dispute over back 
wages for its crew. In March a 435-foot Romanian freighter, the Dragomiresti, 
was seized in Galveston, Texas, and later auctioned in a dispute over 
back wages. The ship in the current incident, the Delta Pride, is 
738 feet long, a bulk carrier of the Panamax class, meaning that she 
is nearly 106.3 feet wide, the maximum width for a vessel to pass 
through the Panama Canal. The Delta Pride and its crew had been held 
at anchor in Tampico, Mexico, for five months as local agents tried 
to wrest money from the owners, Lall said, adding that the agents 
withheld all of the ship's official papers, including the seamen's 
passports, to keep it in Tampico. ``Gradually, though, the situation 
became desperate,'' Lall said. ``They ran out of food and then water, 
and they were forced to drink dirty rainwater. Finally, when the men 
threatened to jump into the sea and kill themselves, the captain decided 
to head for U.S. waters, where he felt the authorities would respond 
much better to his plight.'' Gove said the ship radioed the Coast 
Guard on Nov. 24 as soon as it entered U.S. waters near Brownsville, 
Texas, and anchored three and a half miles off Padre Island, just 
northeast of Brownsville. By then, he said, the Delta Pride was virtually 
out of fuel and unable to generate power. ``We found that some of 
the crew was malnourished and sick from drinking dirty water, but 
not sick enough to require medical evacuation,'' he added. ``So we 
worked with some local charitable organizations to get food and water 
out to them.'' The men, who still do not have their passports, will 
be kept on the ship unless there is a medical emergency, Gove said. 
The ship cannot be brought into port, he said, because the Coast Guard 
is not sure that its operational systems, including steering and maneuvering, 
are in working order. Bringing a dead ship that size into port would 
take four tugboats, he said, ``and there aren't four tugs in Brownsville.'' 
Besides, Gove said, the Delta Pride does not carry a certificate of 
financial responsibility, so if it were brought into harbor and began 
to leak, the cleanup would have to be paid by American taxpayers. 
On Thursday a second emergency shipment, financed by Lall's company, 
provided the crew with a 21-day supply of food and water. It also 
provided enough fuel to start the ship's electrical system, and the 
men now have lights and air-conditioning. ``They're in much better 
spirits today,'' Lieutenant Gove said. Lall said the situation, while 
serious, is not as complicated as many involving such abandoned ships. 
As far as Global Ship Services has been able to determine, the only 
money owed by the ship is to the local agents in Mexico. ``But the 
owners have more or less gone bankrupt, so we are dealing now with 
the banks who are interested in salvaging the ship,'' he said. Lall 
said he hoped that the Allied Bank of Karachi, the chief creditor, 
would pay the estimated $300,000 necessary to resolve the Mexican 
debt, pay the seamen's back wages, reimburse his company and make 
the ship seaworthy again.
