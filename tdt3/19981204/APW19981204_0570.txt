Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is expected to present a major policy 
statement on working out a final peace agreement with Israel during 
a visit to the Swedish capital Saturday, an official said. The stated 
reason for Arafat's trip is to attend a meeting commemorating the 
10th anniversary of Arafat's statement in Stockholm recognizing Israel's 
right to exist. ``Arafat will, in his talk ... put forward principles 
for final negotiations and they can be expected to get wide support,'' 
Sten Andersson, chairman of the Olof Palme Center that arranged the 
meeting, was quoted as saying by the Swedish news agency TT. Swedish 
and Israeli diplomats confirmed on Friday that unofficial talks between 
Israeli and Palestinian representatives have been taking place in 
Stockholm since 1994. Arafat's speech is expected to build on those 
talks. ``The talks have taken place with a certain regularity,'' Swedish 
Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said Friday ``They hang together _ the 
Oslo process and these talks.'' Israel will be represented at the 
meeting by Meir Sheetrit, group leader in parliament for Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition and Yossi Beilin, a top member 
of Israel's main opposition Labor Party. Although Israel's representation 
is not on Arafat's level in terms of protocol, Beilin is an influential 
figure as one of the architects of the Oslo Accord treaty between 
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Beilin has also 
been involved in the ongoing talks in Sweden, Israeli Embassy spokesman 
Shlomo Morgan said. The unofficial discussions also reportedly included 
influential Palestinian academics. Andersson, who was foreign minister 
during Arafat's visit in 1988, declined to give details on what the 
Palestinian leader might say. ``This is Arafat's matter,'' Andersson 
said. Among the most critical issues in the collapsing peace process 
is whether Arafat will declare a separate Palestinian state. He claims 
the Oslo Accord allows him to do so as of early May 1999, but the 
document's wording on the matter is vague. Israel this week suspended 
its troop withdrawals from the West Bank until the Palestinians meet 
a series of demands including publicly abandoning intentions to declare 
a state in May.
