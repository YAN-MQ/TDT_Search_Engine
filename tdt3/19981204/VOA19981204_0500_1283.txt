Former British Open and PGA golf champion Nick Price of Zimbabwe has 
the lead after round one of the million dollar golf challenge in Sun 
City, South Africa. Price, a two-time champion in Sun City, fired 
a 500 par 67 on the par 72 Gary Clarrit course Thursday. This year's 
Masters and British Open champion, American Mark O'Meara, is tied 
with former Masters winner Bernhard Langer of Germany and former British 
Open winner Justin Leonard of the United States two strikes behind 
Price. Golfer Lee Westwood of England has won the European Golfer 
of the Year crown, pushing aside three-time winner Colin Montgomerie 
of Scotland. The 25-year-old Westwood was the unanimous choice for 
the award handed out by a panel of golf writers and representatives 
of the European tour in London. Westwood had global impact on golf, 
winning events in the United States, Germany, England, Scotland, Belgium, 
and twice in Japan.
