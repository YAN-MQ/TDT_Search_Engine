Inflation in the Philippines jumped to 11.2 percent in November on 
a year-to-year basis, the highest level in nearly three years, the 
government said Thursday. The steep rise from 10.2 percent in October 
was attributed largely to a sharp increase in food prices, which have 
a hefty weighting in the consumer price index. Crop damage caused 
by several strong typhoons pushed food prices up 12.3 percent in November 
from a year earlier, compared to a 9.9 percent increase in October. 
The November data brought the average inflation rate for the first 
11 months of the year to 9.7 percent, still below the government's 
target of 10 percent. Most economists had predicted consumer prices 
would rise just 10.1 percent in November year-on-year. The 11.2 percent 
inflation was the highest since January 1996, when consumer prices 
also rose 11.2 percent on the year. Inflation was 7.6 percent in November 
1997. But economists predicted consumer prices should fall in subsequent 
months as supplies of rice, fruits and vegetables stabilize. ``The 
effect of the weather disturbances is temporary, and the underlying 
trend of inflation remains downward,'' said Central Bank Managing 
Director Amando Tetangco. After an early plunge, the stock market 
welcomed those views. After three days of losses, which saw the market's 
main index drop 168.33 points, or 8.5 percent, on rumors that inflation 
would hit 11 percent, stocks rebounded moderately at the end of trading. 
The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed 15.61 points, 
or 0.9 percent, higher at 1,822.64 after sinking nearly 50 points 
earlier in the day.
