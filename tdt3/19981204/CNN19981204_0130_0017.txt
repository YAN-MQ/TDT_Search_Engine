From Atlanta, this is "CNN Headline News." I'm David Goodnow. Those 
stories shortly. But first, the countdown is approaching for NASA's 
second attempt to put space shuttle "endeavour" into orbit. NASA determined 
a cockpit alarm that sounded and delayed the first launch attempt 
on Thursday posed no threat to the mission. Forecasters predict a 
60% chance of good weather for lift-off, which is set for 3:35 A.M. 
eastern time. The astronauts will bring the second piece of the international 
space station into orbit. Russia launched the first piece two weeks 
ago. Construction of the station is a year behind schedule because 
of financial problems in Russia.
