An intense manhunt for an escaped death row inmate in Texas is over. 
Now prison officials want to know how Martin gurule died. Charles 
Zewe reports. Gurule's body was found by two off-duty prison guards 
running trout lines in a Creek that feeds into the Trinity river about 
a mile east of the prison unit gurule escaped from Thanksgiving night. 
We looked up there and saw what I thought looked like a mannequin. 
We went over to look at it and saw that it was a body and we assumed 
it was the inmate. The body had no bullet holes, but was bloody and 
bloated. He had the tennis shoes on that we knew he was wearing, the 
same watch that we knew he had from our property inventory. He was 
wearing dark-colored Thermal type underwear tops, two pairs of those. 
He had also wrapped his chest in cardboard. That was what enabled 
him to get across the fence. The 29-year-old convicted killer was 
among seven death row inmates who tried to break out of the prison 
near Huntsville, Texas. Guards opened fire and the other six gave 
up, but gurule scaled two razor-wire fences and got away. An autopsy 
will be performed to confirm the cause of death. Prison officials 
say it looks like gurule drowned. I think we're relieved. This was 
an issue of public safety. We knew as long as we had a death row inmate 
outside of our compound that there was a potential public risk. And 
we know now that that public risk has ended. Prison officials may 
be relieved, but Texas governor George bush is demanding answers. 
A perturbed bush says he wants to know why and how gurule was able 
to flee death row and has asked the Texas rangers to find out. Charles 
Zewe, CNN, reporting.
