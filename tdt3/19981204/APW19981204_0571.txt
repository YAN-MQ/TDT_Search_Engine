New South Wales state police said Friday they have no intention of 
raiding the Olympic Village over suspected personal use of sports 
drugs by athletes during the Sydney 2000 Games. Police issued a statement 
Friday denying newspaper reports that the Australian Olympic Committee 
(AOC) had discussed searches on the athletes' village with police. 
``The NSW police service wishes to make clear that it has had no discussions 
with the Australian Olympic Committee regarding drug searches in the 
Athletes Village during the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games,'' 
the statement said. Lesley Honeyman, the deputy director of intelligence 
at the Olympic Security Command Center, said raids on the Olympic 
Village and other 2000 Games venues for personal-use amounts of drugs 
would breach police protocol. ``The (police) policy is that use of 
a performance enhancing drug is not a law enforcement priority, Honeyman 
said. (djp)
