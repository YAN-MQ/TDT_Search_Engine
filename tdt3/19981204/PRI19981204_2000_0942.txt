On three continents, citizens go to the polls this weekend in elections 
remarkable for their personalities and their potential to bring about 
change. Campaigning is drawing to a close in Nigeria where local elections 
take place tomorrow. The vote is seen as a partial first test of the 
military's plan to restore the country to civilian rule. The nine 
parties have based their campaigns not on local issues but on the 
heavyweight politicians who hope to run in national elections next 
year. This weekend's elections are the most competitive since 1993, 
when a democratic vote was annulled by former military ruler, Sani 
Abacha. Senator Olusegun Obasanjo was locked up for months by the 
military regime. Now back in the political fray, he says much has 
changed. Distress in the country have certainly come down. People 
now speak with confidence. The atmosphere of fear is considerably 
reduced. And I can only hope the new head of state can maintain it. 
But others doubt that Nigeria's electoral commission has the resources 
to run an election smoothly in a country with a population of more 
than 100 million people. Ieu Obey of the Nigerian Civil Rights Association 
argues that Nigeria's leaders are rushing the transition to civilian 
rule so they do not have to take the heat for the collapsing economy. 
It is as if the military are setting up a lot of pitfalls along the 
way, so that they are not interested in having democracy. It is always 
like an optional extra. The main thing is to have the elections and 
get out because the whole infrastructure. Everything in this country 
is almost ready to crumble and the military do not want to take the 
blame for it. Nevertheless, Nigeria's current head of state, General 
Abdulsalami Abubakar, has impressed many with his apparent determination 
to relinquish power.
