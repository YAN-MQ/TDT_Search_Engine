An imaginary ring symbolizing the race for president, the people in 
the media always talk about in this country appears to have two re 
hats in it tonight if you look very closely. With only 6 the 9 days 
to go -- 699 days to go they are off and running for 2000. This afternoon 
former democratic senator Bill Bradley took theirst step toward a 
run for the White House. He has formed what they like to call an exploratory 
committee to begin raising money for a campaign. The former NBA star 
chose a gymnasium, of all places, for a press conference. Compared 
what he's doing with going to training camp in sports, and it appears 
republican senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, one of the four senators 
who sing as a group, wants to compete in two different arenas come 
2000. Aides to Ashcroft say their boss plans to run for re-election 
in Missouri and perhaps run for the White House at the same time.
