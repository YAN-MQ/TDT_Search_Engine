Roberto Benigni won best actor and best film prizes at the European 
Film Awards on Friday for his acclaimed movie ``Life is Beautiful.'' 
Benigni directed and starred in the film, called in Italian ``La Vita 
e Bella.'' The film, which also won the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes 
Film Festival last May, is the story of a father who tries to shield 
his son from the horrors of a Nazi death camp and convince him it 
is all an elaborate game. ``This prize for me is a demonstration of 
love,'' Benigni said. ``I don't know how to demonstrate my thanks 
for the amount of this love.'' Best European Actress was a joint win 
for Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier, stars of France's ``La Vie 
Revee Des Anges,'' or ``The Dream Life of Angels.'' Sweden's Stellan 
Skarsgard won the European Achievement in World Cinema Award for his 
appearances in ``Amistad'' and ``Good Will Hunting.'' He beat illustrious 
competition from Antonio Banderas, Pierce Brosnan, Gerard Depardieu, 
Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. ``I am very moved and nervous, but 
I won't go like this as everyone else does,'' he said. Adrian Biddle 
was chosen Best European Cinematographer for Neil Jordan's Irish film 
``The Butcher Boy.'' British actor Jeremy Irons was given the European 
Film Academy Special Achievement Award. Peter Howitt was named Best 
European Screenwriter for British film ``Sliding Doors,'' starring
