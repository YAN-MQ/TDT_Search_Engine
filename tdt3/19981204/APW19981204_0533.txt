ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA's executive committee on Friday allocated 
the 32 places for the 2002 World Cup finals, leaving Asian nations 
to fight for two slots. With France automatically qualified as champion, 
and Japan and South Korea as co-hosts, the world governing body was 
left with one less qualifying place overall than in this year's tournament. 
FIFA decided Asia should have four nations in the finals, including 
the two already qualified. ``The representatives of Asia were not 
too happy,'' FIFA President Sepp Blatter told reporters. But, he added, 
Asia effectively has more slots than in 1998, when it qualified three 
nations, with Iran picking up a fourth slot in a playoff against Australia, 
the top qualifier from Oceania. For the next World Cup, the leading 
contender from Oeania faces a tough two-leg playoff against a South 
American team. That decision followed a draw between Europe and South 
America, which were the only two regions prepared to take part in 
the playoff. Europe retains 14 places in the 2002 World Cup, with 
an additional slot for reigning champion France. The French this year 
automatically qualified as hosts. Africa and CONCACAF _ covering North 
and Central America and the Caribbean _ will keep the five and three 
places they respectively held this year. South America has four qualifying 
places in addition to the slot it must fight for with Oceania. This 
year, it had four qualifiers in addition to reigning champion Brazil. 
The 2002 World Cup will be the first held in Asia and the first to 
be co-hosted. Following his visit this week to South Korea, Blatter 
restated his willingness to consider allowing North Korea to host 
``one, two or three'' games of the finals out of South Korea's allocation. 
But he again insisted that it is up to the countries' politicians 
to make the first move. ``We do not mingle with poltical affairs but 
we're open to any kind of dialogue,'' Blatter said. FIFA is ``open 
to the idea'' and the governing executive committee ``immediately 
supported this,'' he added. The committee also agreed that the 64-match 
tournament can be held within 30 days, between Jun. 1 and Jun. 30, 
2002. But ``the decision has to be taken by the organizing committee,'' 
Blatter stressed. That schedule would avoid teams having to wait several 
days between matches, he said. The FIFA president has said he personally 
believes the 2002 finals should be completed before the end of June 
to avoid the July rainy season in Japan and South Korea. The World 
Cup finals have traditionally been held in June and July, avoiding 
league schedules in Europe and South America.
