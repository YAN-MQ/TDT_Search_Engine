Roller derby is stepping into the new millennium in a new incarnation. 
Greg Lamotte introduces us to "roller jam." July 4th, 1971 -- as impossible 
as it may sound, 35,000 people jammed into Oakland Coliseum to watch 
roller derby. Its heydays were in the '50s, '60s and early '70s. It 
was sort of America's "secret" national pastime. Many people watched, 
but few were willing to admit it. This man, Leo seltzer, is credited 
with inventing the game and promoting it. But in the '70s, roller 
derby's popularity fizzled away. But wait, seltzer had a son. uh-oh. 
Ladies and gentlemen, roller derby has a new name, "roller jam." And 
the seltzer legacy is attempting to make a comeback. It's great sports. 
It's great entertainment. And it's different. Tryouts were held in 
Los Angeles recently for a new weekly two-hour cable television show 
called "roller jam." We have some world-class skaters. We have some 
Olympic skaters. We have some great roller hockey skaters. If you 
can't skate, you can't cut it. I'm 6'2", 205 pounds and I love body 
contact in sports. As a speed skater, I like to rough people up a 
little bit. But in our sport, we really can't do it. So, doing "roller 
jam," I could just check somebody and have the speed aspect at the 
same time. The difference between roller derby and "roller jam"? In-line 
skates versus four on the floor. But do these aspiring "roller jam" 
heroes even remember the roller derby days? no, no, no. It's like 
a foggy Gray zone of my childhood. I think I was too young. But some, 
at least, seem to have the concept. I think roller derby is probably 
a mixed sport, big-time wrestling. It's probably more like big-time 
wrestling with skates on. Those promoting the new show admit it's 
all about entertainment. And "roller jam," whether America is ready 
or not, is coming back to television January 15th. Greg Lamotte, CNN, 
Los Angeles.
