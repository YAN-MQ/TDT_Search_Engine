Standing before hundreds of thousands of roaring supporters, many 
wearing his trademark red parachutist's beret, ex-coup leader Hugo 
Chavez laid out the choice for Venezuelan voters in Sunday's presidential 
election. ``Here there are two options,'' Chavez, 44, bellowed from 
a hydraulic platform high above the crowd at his final campaign rally 
Wednesday. ``Corruption and the same old thing, or the salvation of 
the country.'' Millions of poor people are flocking to the cashiered 
lieutenant colonel, whose rise to the top of the polls reflects growing 
frustration over the failure of democracy and free markets to reduce 
poverty. ``It is a wake-up call for the region,'' said Michael Shifter, 
senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, D.C. The 
race has polarized Venezuela. The poor see Chavez as a hero because 
of his tough anti-corruption talk. The upper classes fear he will 
become a leftist dictator. Politicians have ``sacked and robbed this 
country. When Mr. Chavez wins, all that will change,'' retired airplane 
repair worker Rangel Arcides said at the rally. Chavez's main opponent 
is Henrique Salas Romer, a Yale-educated businessman who built a reputation 
for efficiency as governor of industrial Carabobo state and is viewed 
as conservative and pro-free market. Although he ran as an independent, 
the country's two main traditional parties dumped their own candidates 
last week and closed ranks behind Salas, 62, in a last-ditch effort 
to block Chavez. Salas's administration was ``a model for Venezuela,'' 
said teacher Katia de Pannini. ``The only thing Chavez has ever run 
is the canteen in the barracks.'' Last year, the United States denied 
Chavez a tourist visa because of the coup attempt, but Washington 
says it will respect Sunday's outcome and hope for the best. ``If 
Chavez were to win we'll work with him, but his actions will speak 
louder than words,'' Peter Romero, assistant secretary of state for 
InterAmerican affairs, told The Associated Press. The race is attracting 
worldwide attention partly because Venezuela was long one of Latin 
America's most stable and prosperous countries. That image shattered 
in 1989 when then-President Carlos Andres Perez shocked the nation 
with free-market austerity, provoking riots in which security forced 
killed at least 300 people. In 1992, military rebels twice tried to 
overthrow Perez, with Chavez leading the first revolt. Released from 
prison two years later, he formed a political movement that invoked 
independence hero Simon Bolivar. Most Venezuelans blame the two traditional 
parties, center-left Democratic Action and right-center COPEI, for 
squandering the world's largest oil reserves outside the Middle East 
and for a corrupt political culture widely blamed for sharply declining 
living standards. Public hospitals lack supplies as basic as needles, 
Venezuelans pay bribes for drivers licenses, telephone hookups, even 
operations at crowded hospitals. Well over half the population is 
mired in poverty. ``The state almost doesn't exist. There is no law. 
Democracy has become illegitimate,'' says Chavez. If Chavez wins, 
he will be the first president in 40 years of democracy to come from 
outside the traditional party elite. His Patriotic Pole coalition 
has already broken the old parties' political stranglehold, winning 
a plurality in Congress in elections on Nov. 8. Fears that the military 
would not accept a Chavez victory have unnerved Venezuelans. And Chavez 
says he won't be able to halt violence if fraud costs him the election. 
In the past decade, dictatorships have given way to democracy in Latin 
America, and state-run economies have generally ceded to free markets. 
Yet the gulf between rich and poor has widened. ``Chavez has been 
pushed by a wave of resentment and frustration and protest against 
corruption and against economic policies that haven't delivered for 
the great majority,'' said political scientist Anibal Romero. Chavez 
says he would pursue a ``third way'' between socialism and unfettered 
capitalism. He also vows to convene a constituent assembly to rewrite 
the constitution _ and possibly dissolve Congress. But Chavez insists 
that he's a democrat ``from head to toe.'' A Chavez win could be another 
example of Latin Americans turning to caudillos, or strong men. President 
Alberto Fujimori of Peru temporarily shut down Congress and the courts 
six years ago to clean up corruption, and Bolivia's president, Hugo 
Banzer, is a former dictator. Still, few Venezuelans would tolerate 
a return to dictatorship. ``We need radical changes but within democracy,'' 
said unemployed Caracas accountant Fanny de Avendano. She said she 
was voting for Salas.
