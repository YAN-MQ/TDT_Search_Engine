Cheering Muslim mobs on Friday burned a Roman Catholic church in a 
provincial capital in the latest outburst of religious violence in 
Indonesia. At first, thousands of rioters blocked fire trucks from 
reaching the church in Ujungpandang, the capital of South Sulawesi 
province, 840 miles (1,350 kilometers) east of Jakarta. The trucks 
eventually made it through but the church and two houses were gutted, 
said Muhamad Adam, a fire brigade official. Police and soldiers patrolled 
the area after the mobs dispersed. There were no reports of injuries 
or arrests. Police said that as night fell security personnel were 
guarding other churches in the predominately Muslim city of 750,000. 
Witnesses said mobs left neighboring mosques after Friday Islamic 
prayers and set fire to the suburban Kare Catholic Church. Last week, 
Christian rioters in the city of Kupang, southeast of Jakarta, burned 
and ransacked 15 mosques in retaliation for the Nov. 22 burning of 
churches in Jakarta. On Thursday, a man reported to be mentally ill 
set three mosque afire in Ngabang, on Borneo island, 810 kilometers 
(500 miles) north of Jakarta. The violence has raised fears that revenge 
attacks on places of worship could escalate in the world's most populous 
Muslim nation. Ninety percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are 
Muslim, with the rest belonging to Christian, Buddhist and other faiths. 
Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the national 
philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia declared independence 
from Dutch colonial rule in 1945. But social tensions, fueled by widespread 
unemployment, have intensified in Indonesia amid the worst economic 
crisis in decades. The attacks come despite repeated calls for calm 
by Indonesian President B.J. Habibie as well as Muslim and Christian 
religious leaders.
