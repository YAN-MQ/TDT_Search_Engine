After three days of losses, Philippine stocks capped a volatile session 
Friday with modest gains from last-minute bargain hunting. The 30-share 
Philippine Stock Exchange Index ended 15.61 points, or 0.9 percent, 
higher at 1,822.64 after losing nearly 50 points early in the session 
following the release of the inflation data. On Thursday the index 
plunged 78.97 points, or 4.2 percent, bringing its total loss since 
Tuesday to 168.33 points, or 8.5 percent. Gainers outpaced decliners 
Friday 54 to 43, while 31 issues were unchanged. Jose Ricardo Garcia, 
vice president for Diversified Securities Inc., said the worse-than-expected 
November inflation data triggered a knee-jerk reaction among investors, 
who went on a selling spree soon after trading started. Before the 
market opened, the government reported that inflation in November 
was 11.2 percent on an annual basis, up from 10.2 percent the previous 
month and the highest level since January 1996. The government blamed 
sharp increases in food prices for the higher inflation rate. Garcia 
said the 184.86-point, or 2 percent, loss suffered overnight by the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average further encouraged selling. The market's 
early weakness, however, soon gave way to bargain-hunting, attesting 
to the market's resilience, Garcia said. He said the rise in last 
month's consumer price index shouldn't be cause for concern since 
the average inflation rate from January to November remains at a single-digit 
level at 9.7 percent. ``Inflation has been kept in check despite the 
economic slowdown,'' he said. In currency trading, the peso weakened 
against the dollar, breaching the key 39 peso level as demand for 
the U.S. currency picked up after the release of the inflation data, 
dealers said. The dollar averaged 38.880 pesos for the day, up from 
Thursday's 38.795 pesos. It traded in a thin range of 38.720 pesos 
to 39.100 pesos and last changed hands at 39.010 pesos. ``Some corporations 
have started to buy dollars. Add that to banks squaring their positions, 
you'll have a weaker peso,'' said a trader for a foreign bank. November's 
inflation data struck a negative chord, traders said, pressuring the 
peso despite steady dollar inflows from Filipinos working overseas. 
About 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad, sending home at least dlrs 
6 billion last year. Their foreign-exchange remittances provide an 
important contribution to the Philippine economy, and are expected 
to help support the peso over the rest of the year.
