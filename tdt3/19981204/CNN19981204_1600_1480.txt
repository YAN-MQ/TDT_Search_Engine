A studio in Los Angeles is opening doors for kids who may not otherwise 
have a chance to learn about art and music. Scott withers has details. 
Gang membership is a way of life for many of Los Angeles' teenagers. 
They join looking for a way to survive the city's violent streets. 
They join looking for a way to fill the void in their lives. You don't 
want to get too close to anyone because you'll burn up. woo! Stay 
away. Hundreds of thousands of kids have found what was missing in 
their lives at a small art studio in central L.A. for the last 14 
years, the city hearts outreach program has provided kids from the 
most impoverished areas with an alternative to the streets. The program's 
real value is not what the students learn on the dance floor or at 
a drawing table. I learned that, like, I have people I can trust here. 
And they're my friends. I couldn't trust nobody else. This is my place. 
This is my second home. For many, it's the first time they feel like 
they belong to something positive. It's the first time they've opened 
up to someone else. It's sort of like a family that you can trust. 
They're here for you. You can talk to them. They gave me the books, 
and I just started practicing. It was fun. I just enjoy it more and 
more. The program's goal of building self-worth touched the heart 
of actress Jane Seymour, who now serves as its national honorary chairperson. 
You've got to give them the feeling of self-esteem. Self-esteem is 
the most important thing you can give a human being. And you cannot 
-- you know, you can't not do that. You have to give that to children. 
It doesn't cost very much money. And through these projects, through 
the arts, you can get to these kids. In some cases, the city hearts 
program acts as an intervention to keep these kids off a path that 
could lead to jail. The program's founders estimate it costs $200 
per kid per year, while jail would cost between $25,000 and $45,000. 
City hearts success stories are numerous. The program's volunteers 
believe expanding the students' minds helps warm their souls and their 
hearts. In Los Angeles, Scott withers, "Headline News."
