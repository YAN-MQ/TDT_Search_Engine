The slide toward financial panic would have begun with a flutter of 
pages off a fax machine in Greenwich, Conn., each a notice of foreclosure. 
The instant that Long-Term Capital Management missed a payment to 
a creditor, it would technically have been in default to all of its 
roughly 75 creditors, thanks to loan provisions that required it to 
remain current on all its debts. Facing losses, those creditors would 
have sold assets that the firm had pledged as collateral, sending 
prices plunging. Dozens of markets, from Denmark to Brazil, would 
have bucked like terrified stallions. The selling frenzy would have 
roiled American markets in junk bonds, corporate takeover stocks, 
mortgage securities and even Treasury bonds. Businesses that depend 
on those markets for money to expand and add jobs would have suffered. 
So would consumers whose mortgage rates are influenced by those markets 
and who have billions in retirement savings in them. Fears of such 
a financial panic and its economic aftershocks prompted the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York to help arrange an 11th-hour rescue of the 
fund by 14 Wall Street banks and brokerage firms in September. The 
rescue prevented the fire-sale liquidation of Long-Term Capital's 
far-flung, $125 billion portfolio, assembled almost entirely with 
borrowed money. But even though no public funds were involved, the 
rescue also produced some of the most stinging criticism the Federal 
Reserve has faced since its inflation-fighting efforts prompted a 
national recession in the early 1980s. Some economists and members 
of Congress _ and privately, even a few Wall Street executives _ accuse 
the Fed of overreacting by helping to rescue a speculative partnership 
of wealthy investors and the bankers who allowed its speculation. 
``Why should the weight of the federal government be brought to bear 
to help out a private investor?'' asked Paul A. Volcker, the former 
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Others say the markets could 
have coped with the fund's collapse, although plunging prices would 
certainly have inflicted some pain on market participants. ``There 
is the impression that the Fed interfered with a market solution,'' 
said Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
Fed officials have defended their limited role as essential in avoiding 
what could have become a free-fall panic in markets already struggling 
with the aftershocks of Russia's debt moratorium a month earlier. 
``It was my judgment that the American people, whom we are pledged 
to serve, could have been seriously hurt if credit dried up in a general 
effort by banks and other intermediaries to avoid greater risk,'' 
said William J. McDonough, president of the New York Fed, in testimony 
before Congress a week after the rescue. Alan Greenspan, the Federal 
Reserve chairman, agreed that the times required action. ``With markets 
currently volatile and investors skittish,'' he told Congress in October, 
helping to facilitate a timely rescue of the fund ``seemed entirely 
appropriate as a matter of public policy.'' Still, critics worry that 
by orchestrating the rescue of Long-Term Capital, the Fed suggested 
that a speculator that grows large enough to threaten the system will 
be saved _ a message that might encourage recklessness. ``We need 
to get away from the `too big to fail' idea,'' said Hans Stoll, a 
professor of finance at Vanderbilt University and the author of a 
number of important studies of the volatility in stock markets. ``We 
are not in the position of saving hedge funds, and the Fed or someone 
should make that pretty clear.'' A senior Wall Street banker who is 
a director of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association 
argues that the markets for swaps and other derivatives could have 
coped with Long-Term Capital's collapse. ``There surely would have 
been price changes, and they might have been significant,'' the banker 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But as the prices changed, 
he added, bargain hunters would have stepped in and the markets would 
have adapted. ``When the stock market crashed in 1987, swap activity 
trudged right through without a problem _ with less liquidity and 
less standardization than we have today,'' he added. ``Would prices 
have changed? Yes. Would the system have than been in jeopardy? I 
don't think so.'' Few critics of the Fed can be found in Wall Street's 
corner offices, however. Top executives of banks and brokerage firms 
estimate privately that the collapse of Long-Term Capital alone could 
have cost their businesses a total of $8 billion to $15 billion, and 
one senior executive said he believed that the amounts could have 
been 10 times higher in a market stampede. ``It would have turned 
a machine gun on the Street,'' he said. Andre Levy-Lang, chairman 
and chief executive of Paribas, the French investment bank that contributed 
$100 million to the rescue effort, said the Fed ``was right in raising 
the question and making sure the solution is found.'' There was, he 
added, ``the beginning of a systemic problem'' for the markets, and 
the situation ``might have unraveled very quickly.'' In the end, said 
Litan, the Federal Reserve was ``damned if it did and damned if it 
didn't.'' If the Fed had done nothing and the hedge fund's collapse 
had precipitated a bank failure or a market panic, he said, criticism 
of the sort being cast at the central bank today would seem trivial. 
Indeed, some people say a key lesson of the debacle is the need for 
more regulation, not less. Long-Term Capital's troubles demonstrate 
that ``the regulatory infrastructure is not strong enough or encompassing 
enough,'' said Henry Kaufman, an independent market strategist. Unless 
it improves, he added, there is ``a better-than-even chance'' that 
the markets will see ``future significant financial problems of this 
magnitude, or greater.'' Greenspan has acknowledged that an emergency 
like this one could occur again, and he recently called on bankers 
and regulators to be more alert to the risks of financial derivatives 
and other investments in unseasoned markets. ``New instruments, like 
derivatives, afford the opportunity to reduce risk, but they also 
afford opportunities to become more vulnerable,'' Greenspan told a 
meeting of Wall Street executives early last month. ``Borrowers, lenders 
and regulators need to improve their understanding of the risk characteristics 
of the new instruments under a variety of circumstances _ some extreme.''
