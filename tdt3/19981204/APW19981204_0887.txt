Prime Minister-Designate Salim Hoss appointed a Cabinet on Friday 
of many fresh faces and without five civil-war militia figures who 
had held power previously. ``This government will inspire great confidence 
and reassure people. It augurs well,'' Hoss told reporters after presenting 
his team to President Emile Lahoud. In a first step toward his goal 
of austerity, Hoss formed a government of only 16 ministers, nearly 
half the 30-member Cabinet of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. 
Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist whom Lahoud designated premier earlier 
this week, appointed himself as foreign minister and also took the 
portfolio of immigrant affairs. He chose Nasser Saidi, a vice-governor 
of the central bank, as minister of economy and trade as well as minister 
of industry. The prime minister retained only two members of Hariri's 
government: Michel Murr, who remains deputy prime minister and interior 
minister and takes on rural and municipal affairs as well, and Suleiman 
Franjieh, who was appointed minister of agriculture and minister of 
housing and cooperatives. Franjieh was a Christian militia leader 
during the 1975-90 civil war. Other leading militiamen were dropped 
from the Cabinet. They were Druze leader Walid Jumblatt and ally Akram 
Chehayab, Christian militia leader Elie Hobeika, and senior Shiite 
Muslim Amal officials Mahmoud Abu Hamdan and Ayyoub Hmeid. The defense 
portfolio went to Ghazi Zuetir, a legislator from the eastern Bekaa 
Valley. Hoss appointed a number of specialists to what is the fifth 
government he has formed. The new health minister is the head of the 
Gynecology and Nursery Department at American University of Beirut, 
Karam Karam. Judge Joseph Shaoul was appointed justice minister. Another 
judge, Suleiman Traboulsi, was named as oil minister and will also 
take on the ministry of water and hydraulic resources. The Cabinet 
respects Lebanon's traditional power-sharing arrangement, which divides 
seats equally between Christians and Muslims.
