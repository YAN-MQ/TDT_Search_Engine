In a landmark ruling, an Israeli court said some stores can remain 
open on the Jewish Sabbath. The ruling was seen as a victory for secular 
rights activists fighting against what they see as religious coercion. 
Observant and secular Jews find themselves increasingly at odds over 
what role religion should play in daily life. One of the battle grounds 
is observance of the Jewish Sabbath which runs from sundown Friday 
to sundown Saturday. Under Jewish law, all work and commercial activity 
is banned during the Sabbath and traditionally, shops in Israel have 
been closed during the biblically mandated day of rest. However, the 
Jerusalem District Court ruled Thursday that stores in kibbutzim, 
or communal farms, can operate during the Sabbath. Most kibbutzim 
are secular communities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized 
the ruling, saying that it made a distinction between kibbutz members 
and other Israelis, Israel TV's Channel Two said Friday. Netanyahu 
was quoted as saying he favored keeping the status quo. Kibbutz leaders, 
in turn, accused Netanyahu of pandering to the three religious parties 
that are key members of his shaky coalition.
