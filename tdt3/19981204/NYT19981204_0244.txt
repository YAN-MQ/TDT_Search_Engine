Steven Prescott grabbed a clipboard, a No. 2 pencil and some scrap 
paper and took a seat alongside 100 other nerve-racked men in a stuffy, 
overheated basement. ``Hope I do well,'' Prescott, a graduate student, 
muttered as he glanced at a neighbor, whose hand appeared to be jealously 
shielding a standardized test form. A sociology midterm? Hardly, unless 
you consider the Single Gay Man in Premillennium New York a subject 
worthy of academic study. Prescott, 31, recently dumped and hungry 
for holiday-season company, was braving Date Bait, a brutally efficient, 
high-tech mixer that tries to ease the sting of face-to-face rejection 
by using a computer to make matches. Created two years ago by Rafael 
Risemberg, a dateless psychology professor who was weary of the bar 
scene, Date Bait has become a huge draw among gay men in their 30s 
and 40s, and the Saturday night events, held at A Different Light 
bookstore on West 19th Street, are often so crowded that dozens are 
turned away at the door. So far, Risemberg says, his matchmaking method 
has produced 4,837 dates, although he does not track how many of those 
led to second dates. ``That is something only God knows,'' he said. 
Spurred by the popularity of the events, Risemberg has started a series 
of nights for heterosexuals, lesbians and HIV-positive men. ``I never 
knew it, but I must have been born with some Jewish matchmaking gene,'' 
said Risemberg, 39, who has reaped several dates from his own events, 
but still remains unattached. Date Bait affairs couldn't be less fussy: 
identified with a name tag and three-digit number, participants sit 
on chairs that are arranged in a square. After each person has stood 
and delivered a brief description of himself, the seats are cleared 
for 45 minutes of ferocious mingling. ``Limit conversations to one 
minute per person,'' Risemberg shouts as the men plunge into a frenzy 
of small talk. ``No hogging!'' The mixing done, participants turn 
to their score cards _ those SAT-style answer forms _ and begin shading 
in the ovals that correspond to the numbers worn by the prospects 
who appeal to them. Then comes a nervous 20-minute wait as the forms 
are fed into a scanner, which tabulates and coldly spits out pairs 
of matching numbers. The evening ends with instant gratification _ 
or deflation _ as men who have selected one another scurry to collect 
phone numbers. The anxiety was thick on a recent Saturday night as 
the conservatively dressed crowd _ mostly white and professional _ 
registered, paid a $15 entry fee and quietly took a seat. David Moschel, 
the evening's bubbly emcee, apologized for the heat, which he blamed 
on the room's incandescent lighting. ``We used to have fluorescent 
bulbs, but everyone complained about how green it made them look,'' 
he said. ``Now, everyone suffocates but at least they look good.'' 
Before starting, Risemberg warned the group members to make their 
choices prudently. ``You are fully expected to go on a date with those 
you match,'' he said sternly, defining a date as a half-hour meeting 
in a public place. ``Violators should be reported to the Date Bait 
hot line and will be barred from future events.'' The next hour was 
filled with a numbing litany of 30-second personal spiels that ranged 
from the standard theater-going/long-walk-loving/hopeless-romantic 
variety to the self-deprecating and confessional. ``I have a really 
big mouth, but I'm kind hearted,'' said Rami, No. 031, while Otto, 
077, admitted _ against a friend's advice _ that he lived in New Jersey. 
``I can be in midtown in 30 minutes,'' he said meekly. Jeff, 001, 
back for the 28th time, offered the following description of himself: 
``I'm a 40-year-old neurotic Jew from Brooklyn.'' Tom, 039, sparked 
groans when he said he had broken up with a boyfriend just five days 
earlier, as did Matt, 003, who blithely remarked that he had recently 
used his cell phone on the Stair Master. Heads shook with dismay when 
Rob, 099, said he enjoyed ``The Lion King.'' Others tried unconventional 
appeals. Mark, 064, an accountant, offered any comers a discount on 
their 1998 taxes, and Joe, 015, said he was a nonsmoker but was willing 
to start for the right person. Doug, 030, a ``brilliant unrecognized 
artist from the East Village,'' made a straightforward appeal. ``I'm 
basically a nice person who doesn't have cooties, so go for me,'' 
he said. Then the madness began as participants mingled like ricocheting 
pinballs. Tim Bird, 35, who scribbled two dozen names of men who had 
caught his interest, appeared overwhelmed. ``I'm trying to whittle 
them down,'' Bird, a publicity agent, said as he crossed out three 
names, including a guy who had said that he wasn't interested in anyone 
with emotional baggage. ``Get real,'' Bird said. ``Who doesn't have 
emotional baggage?'' Like many of the men, Jeff Suna, 43, said he 
preferred Date Bait to personal ads and bars, veritable set-ups for 
embarrassment and disappointment. ``It's sort of like a secret ballot,'' 
he said. ``No one gets hurt.'' Not everyone was thrilled by the bait. 
Matt Locker, 31, a radio station disc jockey with exceedingly white 
teeth, stood in a corner drawing smiley faces on his otherwise blank 
form. ``There's nothing here for me,'' he said with a shrug. Still, 
most of the participants agreed that Date Bait is an efficient way 
to meet men who are likely to be sober (no alcohol is served) and 
at least nominally interested in a relationship. ``At bars, the physical 
is primary,'' said John Bonelli, 35, a community organizer from the 
Clinton neighborhood of Manhattan. ``Here, looks are important, but 
there's something more holistic about it. Also, you can't posture 
as easily as you can in a bar.'' David Harper, 35, an adjunct professor 
of economics at New York University, has proof that Date Bait works: 
one of the five dates he got last year turned into a serious relationship. 
``From my point of view, they were three hours well spent,'' he said. 
Unlike rendezvous that originate in clubs or bars _ and often end 
in the morning _ Date Bait dates, he said, force gay men to pace themselves. 
``And even if you don't get a date, at least you'll walk away with 
your ego intact,'' he said. After 28 spins, Jeff Rutsky, the Brooklyn 
neurotic, is still single, but he keeps coming back. ``I don't care, 
because I've made some good friends,'' he said. Once, after failing 
to score a date, he went to a nearby diner and ended up meeting another 
unrequited Date Bait participant. ``You know, we had a really nice 
time,'' Rutsky said. Before handing out the matches, Risemberg offered 
encouragement to those who were about to be disappointed. He said 
that 66 percent of the participants had been chosen by men who interested 
them, too, and 41 percent had two or more matches. ``You think that 
two-thirds of people who go to a bar are going to go home with a date?'' 
he asked. ``I don't think so.'' As the men collected the computer 
printouts, boyish smiles appeared on many faces. Steve Brickman, 23, 
a computer programmer from Brooklyn, was pleased with his two matches 
but said he felt strange after watching one of them swap phone numbers 
_ and a goodbye hug _ with another match. ``I didn't exactly feel 
like No. 1,'' he said. As the men began drifting out, Rutsky shook 
his head and offered a thumbs-down sign. ``I guess I'm going to the 
diner again,'' he said.
