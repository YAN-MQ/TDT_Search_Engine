A lack of goodwill in Kosovo threatens the ``very difficult'' mission 
of unarmed foreign observers sent by the European diplomatic alliance, 
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said Friday. Geremek, the outgoing 
chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
called the Kosovo mission a crucial step for the Vienna-based organization 
that seeks to quell conflict throughout Europe. ``The success of the 
mission seems now to be blocked by a lack of goodwill of all participants,'' 
he told a news conference after returning from an OSCE conference 
in Oslo, Norway. ``The mission faces a very difficult task.'' The 
2,000-strong OSCE mission, still being set up, will try to verify 
if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with agreements 
he reached with U.S. envoys and the OSCE to halt violence in Kosovo 
and start political negotiations. Under the agreements, Milosevic 
has removed some Yugoslav troops and Serb police from the restive 
Serb province where the ethnic Albanian majority seeks independence. 
A crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists that began in February 
led to fighting that killed hundreds and forced 300,000 people from 
their homes. Fearing a humanitarian catastrophe, NATO threatened air 
strikes on Milosevic's forces in October to force him to agree to 
halt his offensive and allow international organizations to feed and 
shelter displaced people. Most of the refugees have returned to their 
homes or villages, but sporadic violence by ethnic Albanian guerrillas 
and Serb and Yugoslav forces continues. In the latest incidents, Yugoslav 
border guards killed eight ethnic Albanians on Thursday. Efforts by 
U.S. diplomats to start political talks have stalled, though some 
progress occurred this week when the ethnic Albanian guerrillas softened 
their demand for independence by accepting the principle of an interim 
period of autonomy. Geremek, a veteran of Poland's Solidarity movement 
that ousted communist rule in 1989, called the shift by the rebels 
a positive sign. He called Kosovo ``the biggest challenge for the 
OSCE and also the biggest chance to show that it is a necessary organization 
in Europe.'' While the humanitarian crisis has been avoided, he said 
``everything or almost everything is still to be done'' in building 
trust and democratic institutions in the region. Asked about Poland's 
role as the OSCE revolving chairman for the past year, Geremek said 
the experience raised Poland's profile and prestige in the changing 
political climate of Europe. Poland will next year join the Czech 
Republic and Hungary as the first three former Soviet bloc countries 
to join NATO, their former enemy. ``Thanks to the OSCE chairmanship, 
Poland enters NATO as a country with an important position,'' he said. 
``It has become an attractive political partner.''
