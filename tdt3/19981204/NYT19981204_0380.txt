A Year-End Guide To Income Tax Savings Most taxpayers can find ways 
to pare their 1998 taxes, especially if they act now; once the year 
ends, many of those opportunities will be gone. ``There are some differences 
from last year because of changes in the law,'' said Avery E. Neumark, 
a principal at the New York law firm Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin &AMP; 
Co., ``as well as traditional year-end moves.'' His checklist includes 
these strategies: SECURITIES TRADES After last year's ultracomplex 
rules on holding periods for long-term capital gains and losses, Congress 
has simplified the rules, defining long term as anything held over 
12 months. Such capital gains will have a 20 percent tax rate for 
most taxpayers; up to $3,000 of net capital losses can be taken against 
ordinary income. While the Dow industrials have recovered in recent 
weeks, many investors still have paper losses in emerging-markets 
funds, for example. If you are among them and want to reposition that 
holding, recognizing the loss in December could cut your taxes. If 
the loss is more than $3,000, the excess can be carried forward to 
a future year. KEOGH PLANS Anyone with self-employment income _ even 
from a sideline like part-time consulting _ can put part of that money 
into a tax-deferred Keogh retirement plan, provided that the plan 
is set up by Dec. 31. The money does not have to be deposited until 
the due date of the return, April 15 _ or later, with an extension. 
CHARITABLE GIFTS If you donate appreciated securities instead of cash, 
you can deduct the market value and owe no capital-gains tax. If you 
are short of cash now, you can take a 1998 deduction if the charity 
charges the donation to a credit card in December. STATE AND LOCAL 
TAX BILLS For most taxpayers, paying real estate or fourth-quarter 
estimated state and local taxes in December will mean a bigger 1998 
deduction. But if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax, 
you will lose the deduction, so it may be worth postponing any payments 
until January. ESTIMATED TAXES The 1998 rules are not as tough as 
last year's, but you should still do some math to make sure you do 
not face an underpayment penalty. You will escape the penalty if your 
estimated tax payments come within $1,000 of what is due, or if you 
have paid 90 percent of the current year's liability in 1998 or an 
amount equal to 100 percent of your 1997 liability. HEALTH INSURANCE 
The allowed deduction for self-employed people has risen to 45 percent 
of health insurance premiums paid for 1998. That gives the self-employed 
a bigger incentive to buy coverage. FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS This 
employer-provided benefit reimburses expenditures for certain child-care 
and medical costs, tax-free. But it is a ``use it or lose it'' benefit, 
so you should tap unused funds this month. GIFTS An individual may 
make annual gifts of as much as $10,000 to any number of people, with 
no reduction of the unified gift and estate tax credit. Wealthy people 
should consider making gifts before Dec. 31 to cut the size of their 
taxable estates.
