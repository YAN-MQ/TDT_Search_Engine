It will take four years and millions of dollars to clean up mercury-contaminated 
soil at a site formerly used by General Electric in the southern town 
of Juana Diaz, officials said. In an interview late Thursday, two 
top regional officials of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
said efforts to treat the soil to remove the mercury were unsuccessful 
so it would have to be removed. ``Right now we are designing a remediation 
process, but we are talking about two years to present a remediation 
plan and two more for the removal,'' said Ramon Torres, EPA emergency 
coordinator. Carl Axel Soderberg, EPA Caribbean director, estimated 
the cost of the cleanup would reach ``millions'' of dollars. ``These 
grounds represent a danger and that's why we are going to remove them,'' 
Soderberg said. Both officials said that while mercury had contaminated 
the ground, it had not entered water wells in the area. The cleanup 
will be paid for by the EPA's Superfund and the government will seek 
reimbursement from General Electric, the officials said.
