A bankrupt concert promoter was ordered Friday to pay tenor Jose Carreras 
400,000 marks (dlrs 240,000) for two 1997 performances, but even the 
judge admitted the singer was unlikely to see any of it. Concert promoter 
Matthias Hoffmann's company has gone bankrupt since Carreras performed 
last year in Fulda and Hanover, and is jailed on suspicion of tax 
evasion. Hoffmann had put off paying the debt citing financial difficulties, 
and his defense argued that Carreras had deferred payment. The state 
court ordered payment of the full fee, with interest. ``It's pretty 
sure the money's not there,'' said chief Judge Bernfried von Loebbecke.
