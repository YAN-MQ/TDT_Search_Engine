The United States and North Korea are set to resume key talks on access 
to a suspected underground nuclear facility near Pyongyang. Negotiators 
for the two sides will meet in New York today and tomorrow, then travel 
to Washington for another round of talks next week. U.S. officials 
fear North Korea is using the site to develop nuclear weapons in violation 
of a 1994 energy deal with Washington. During talks in Pyongyang last 
month, the United States rejected a North Korean offer to allow inspection 
of the site in return for financial compensation.
