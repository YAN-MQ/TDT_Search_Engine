Brothers Andi and Helmut Ruetz of Austria won a two-man World Cup 
luge competition Friday on a natural track. ``We really worked on 
our equipment and we mastered the tricky curves the best,'' said Andi 
Ruetz. With the Americans and many other teams absent, the Austrians 
dominated, taking three of the top four places. Martin Psenner and 
Christian Hafner of Italy placed second, while Peter Lechner and Peter 
Braunegger of Austria came in third.
