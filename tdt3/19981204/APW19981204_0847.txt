South African Breweries Ltd. said Friday it plans to shift its primary 
listing of shares to the London Stock Exchange but made assurances 
it was not abandoning South Africa and would indeed strengthen its 
operations here. SAB Managing Director Graham Mackay said a London 
listing would elevate the company's competitiveness with international 
brewers. The planned shift by SAB _ one of the top six brewers in 
the world in terms of volume and sales _ comes less than two months 
after Anglo American PLC, a mining conglomerate and currently South 
Africa's largest corporate entity, announced it was moving its headquarters 
to London to raise its profile as a global operation and increase 
its ability to tap financial markets. Mackay said he is aiming to 
list SAB on the London Stock Exchange next March, around the same 
time as Anglo American's scheduled debut on that stock exchange. Mackay 
said he had spoken to South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki about 
the proposed listing and that President Nelson Mandela also was aware 
of it. ``There were no problems, it was more a courtesy call,'' Mackay 
said. The company will be holding a special general meeting in January 
of shareholders, who will vote on the move. ``I don't think it will 
be controversial,'' Mackay said. The move ``will allow us to build 
on our international beverage operations and accelerate international 
expansion, while continuing to invest in and strengthen our existing 
operations in South Africa,'' Mackay said in a statement to the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange, where the company will have secondary listings of 
shares. SAB holds interests in various beer-making enterprises in 
sub-Saharan Africa, central Europe and China. Since the beginning 
of 1995, SAB has invested dlrs 660 million in the domestic brewing 
market and a further dlrs 825 million offshore. On another front, 
Mackay emphatically denied that SAB is has been approached by an international 
brewing rival as part of a takeover attempt. Speculation has been 
rife in local financial markets that Holland-based Heineken and U.S.-based 
Anheuser-Busch breweries are stalking the group. Founded in 1895, 
SAB is the oldest continuously listed stock on the JSE.
