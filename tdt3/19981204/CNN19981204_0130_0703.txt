The nation's largest tobacco plans to spend $100 million to discourage 
potential smokers. Monday, Philip Morris will launch a campaign to 
convince kids that smoking is not cool. TV ads will begin airing with 
slogans like, "think, don't smoke." Big tobacco recently reached a 
settlement with 46 states that included an agreement to study why 
children smoke.
