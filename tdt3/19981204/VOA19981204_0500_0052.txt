Ten, nine, eight -- we have a go for main engine start. We have main 
engine start. Four, three, two, one -- we have boost to ignition and 
liftoff of the space shuttle "Endeavor" with the first American element 
of the international space station uniting our efforts in space to 
achieve our common goals. The shuttle is carrying a passageway designed 
to be connected to the module during the 11-day mission, which will 
include several spacewalks. The 16-nation project has been delayed 
more than a year due mainly to Russian budget problems. The space 
station will consist of more than 100 components to be deployed in 
space over the next five years. The operation will require 45 U.S. 
and Russian space flights.
