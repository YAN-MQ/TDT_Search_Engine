Now that his weekends are suddenly free, Ronald Grissom is not sure 
how to spend the idle time. He slept a lot on that first free weekend, 
in November, and he and his wife, Stephanie, decorated the Christmas 
tree last weekend. They have been talking about the various movies 
they would like to see, and if the weather stays warm they will probably 
go bicycling in the flat, open countryside. Grissom, 57, is not unemployed. 
He is not one of the thousands of manufacturing workers who have been 
laid off around the country because of global economic turmoil. In 
fact, he has been employed as a blue-collar factory worker in this 
industrial and agricultural area northeast of Indianapolis for 36 
years without ever being laid off, even for a day. Rather, the time 
on Grissom's hands results from a first cousin of downsizing. He has 
suddenly lost the overtime that had kept him at work nearly every 
weekend and every holiday for five years. And so the Grissoms find 
their income and purchasing power sharply reduced and their everyday 
lives altered _ both for better and for worse. For better, the Grissoms 
will spend more time together. Mrs. Grissom lists the ways: They will 
take more day trips and vacations, and they will work together on 
the 15-acre farm they bought and moved to three years ago. ``I had 
only helped her with the tomatoes and beans,'' Grissom said. ``Now 
we will till the land, and I will have time to paint the barn and 
do other neglected repair work.'' But would he go back to all the 
overtime if he could get it? Absolutely, they both said: The money 
is irresistible. ``When I worked a Sunday, I got double time, $40 
an hour, and on holidays, triple pay, $60 an hour,'' Grissom said. 
The extra pleasures this money bought and the extra retirement savings 
must now be sacrificed. ``I have never known anyone our age,'' said 
Mrs. Grissom, 45, ``who has turned down overtime.'' Her husband's 
wage history over the past decade helps to explain why the current 
economic expansion has featured such robust consumer spending _ and 
why, even now, Grissom and many other American factory workers, most 
of them unionized, are still among the nation's better earners. As 
the economic expansion unfolded, Grissom's annual income more than 
doubled, reaching $117,000 last year, thanks to overtime, which manufacturers 
have piled on their existing workers to avoid hiring more people. 
Grissom was headed for another six-figure year when the overtime all 
but stopped last month. Now he calculates that he will finish 1998 
at $97,000, and next year at about $60,000 _ $43,000 in base salary 
and the rest, he hopes, in overtime. His experience, though dramatic, 
reflects a national trend. Overtime for the nation's 18.6 million 
manufacturing workers has fallen to 4.5 hours a week on average over 
the last three months, from 4.9 hours in January. The 8 percent drop 
in so few months is unusually sharp, the Labor Department said. Grissom, 
who dropped out of Indiana University after three semesters, has spent 
most of his career working for General Motors in several of its auto 
parts plants in this area. Today he works in a former GM plant now 
owned by Magnequench International Inc., a Chinese company. The factory 
produces tiny magnets for computers, anti-lock brakes, ignition switches 
and the like. It also produces a special powder from which the magnets 
are made. Grissom works in the powder-making process. Magnequench 
sells both the powder and the magnets, and some of the powder has 
been exported to Asia. But the powder is also produced now in China, 
cutting into the Indiana plant's exports. That is one reason that 
overtime has suddenly been curtailed at the plant _ although Grissom 
did manage to work on Thanksgiving Day, at triple pay. The curtailment 
translates into an altered life style. A high-powered telescope is 
mounted on an aluminum tripod near a dining room window in the Grissoms' 
bungalow-sized home. They had paid $700 for the telescope as an early 
Christmas present to themselves and they have looked at the stars 
a couple of times. That sort of purchase won't happen again, they 
said, and their practice of buying a new car each year is also on 
hold. By January, Mrs. Grissom plans to be working full-time again 
as a freelance legal secretary. She hopes to earn $20,000 in 1999, 
up from $7,000 this year as a part-timer. And Grissom, who plans to 
retire in four years _ if he is not laid off first _ is reconciling 
himself to a $7,500 contribution to his 401(k) plan in 1999, down 
from $10,000 this year. He now has $100,000 saved up. ``I am one of 
the last of the wealthy blue-collar workers,'' he said. ``I am a dying 
breed.''
