It was a year ago so you may not remember him. A boy named Jake. There 
was a story here about that boy and a dog. Not just any boy and a 
dog. Jake's life was in peril. The dog was just part of the equation 
that turned that around. Tonight NBC's Roger O'Neil on Jake, the 1998 
version. This year, Christmas for a kid we came to know as Jake is 
going to be a whole lot better. Can you see the rings? Yea, yea, yea! 
He's already making a list. Singing in the school choir. Nice try, 
but you missed. Doing all the normal things 12-year-olds do. Last 
year, Jacob empy was suffering from epilepsy. We're right here buddy. 
Stricken with as many as five big, grand mal seizures a day. Jake 
and his parents, Tom and Gerry, had been on a six-year roller coaster 
ride from drugs to herbs to special diets. Nothing brought order to 
Jacob's brain. I hate my life. a helmet to help protect his head from 
injury during the seizures brought tears. A specially trained dog 
to detect and warn of the seizures before they occurred, helped but 
only some. With hope running out, doctors at hermans childrens hospital 
in Houston put a tiny computer, a nerve stimulator, into Jacob's chest. 
It would send electrical impulses to the brain to try to disrupt, 
maybe even stop, the seizures. Okay, come on, Jake. Now it's 13 months 
since the surgery. Jake's done very well. His seizures are over, 0% 
decreased in number, and they're less intense. For Jake, this is a 
miracle? For him, this has changed his life. And almost eliminated 
that helmet. Jake has even become a paid spokesman for the company 
making the device. This is my 61st day without a generalized seizure. 
Guess what? Don't need that any more. Since Jake's operation last 
year, more than 2,000 other patients have received nerve simulators. 
Doctors call the device the most important new treatment for epilepsy 
this century. Jacob can be pretty quiet, but he can be bribed with 
root beer. Now I have little seizures that warn me before I have a 
bigger one. Do you have a seizure every day now? I'd say one a week. 
Jacob will always have epilepsy, but his seizures are under control. 
As for Hunter, he's out of a job. Now, he's a boys best friend. Roger 
O'Neil, NBC news, Galveston, Texas.
