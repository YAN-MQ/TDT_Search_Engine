Many investors are falling back from the risk associated with emerging 
markets. As Liz George reports from our business desk in New York, 
some money people are nervous about whether Brazil will be able to 
implement much needed financial reforms. Brazil, the largest economy 
in Latin America is seen as the key to stemming economic crisis in 
the region. That is why Wednesday's vote in the Brazilian congress 
surely has a significant part of an posterity package led to sharp 
falls in stocks around the world. And even more worrying today, investors 
are continuing to move their money away from risk associated with 
emerging markets. Francis Frisinger is the Latin American specialist 
for Merrill Lynch. Brazil's greatest problem is its fiscal deficit. 
The IMF has given a very large bailout on the basis that Brazil is 
going to take serious steps. And you know we have had a blow to that 
belief that Brazil is going to do what is necessary. And Brazil is 
a big country. There are very large investments there. Banks have 
a lot of exposure. This is a global issue. You know, this is the next 
domino which could potentially fall. If it did, there would be a global 
impact. So how will the Brazilian government get its crucial reforms 
through? Won't there be any pressure from outside? That forces acceptance 
of the plans to reduce spending and raise taxes? Arnaldo Yaban is 
a leading writer and film maker in Brazil. The measures of the IMF 
and all the alarm that was created in the foreign press and everything. 
That helped to approve some measures. Brazilian reforms are going 
through somehow. And I think they are going to get sped up now because 
of the international pressure. Because, if there was not the danger, 
the fear, of bankruptcy and everything. Perhaps the thing would be 
much worse. And like a rioter said in Brazil once, the only things 
that moves Brazilian consciousness is fear. It is a very hobsian, 
conclusion, but I think it applies to Brazil. Only terror may move 
Brazilian congressmen. And with investors around the world beginning 
once again to withdraw from the emerging economies, moving their money 
away from risk, that terror may arrive sooner than expected. For The 
World, I am Liz George in New York.
