Many of our local FM and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break, and so you'll lose us for just that amount of 
time, but I hope you'll rejoin us on News Now. And today is Friday, 
December 4th, 1998. What happened in history on this date? Well, here's 
one. In 1867, a group of men interested in the welfare of farmers 
founded the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry. The Grange 
was established to help farmers learn about new technological advances 
of the era, like the telegraph, the railroads, and crossbreeding of 
vegetables. When it was originally founded, it was seen as an opportunity 
for education for many farmers because of all of the technological 
revolution that was going on at that time. The Grange founders saw 
this coming and were afraid that farmers weren't taking advantage 
of the new technology that was available to them or taking advantage 
of it in the right way. And the Grange has remained a strong organization 
in agriculture to this day. Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Christian 
Science Church, died on December 4th, 1910. She had been a pioneer 
in the belief that spiritual healing is the best way to accomplish 
healing from all your ills. A daughter of a farmer, she had endured 
poor health as a child, but she recovered in 1862 when she was treated 
by a physician who claimed that the cause of illness was often in 
the mind of the sufferer. She's probably best known for chartering 
the Church of Christ Scientist in 1879, asserting that her church 
was founded on the method that Jesus Christ had used for healing sins 
and sicknesses. Mary Baker Eddy died from a kidney problem that went 
medically untreated. It is Universal Time, and this is VOA News Now. 
The U.S. space shuttle "Endeavour" was launched from Cape Canaveral, 
Florida, Friday morning as part of the mission to build an international 
space station. France and Britain sign a pledge of closer military 
cooperation to fend off possible crises in Europe. Those stories plus 
business news and a whole lot more in our next half-hour of VOA News 
Now. Hello again. I'm Charlene Porter along with Paul Westpheling. 
You're tuned to News Now. We're in Washington.
