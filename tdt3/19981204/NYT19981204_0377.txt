When many passionate antique collectors find a prize item, they are 
likely to pay whatever it takes to clinch the deal. Not Brian W.H. 
Berghuis, manager of the T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth fund. He scours 
the countryside and even travels abroad looking for the best bargains 
in federal-style chests, chairs and other furniture. ``In the back 
woods of Ontario, the antiques are about half the price they are down 
here,'' he said from his Baltimore office. But that keen focus on 
price applies to his stock selections, too _ an unusual trait for 
a growth fund manager. These days, Berghuis (pronounced BERG-hice) 
is happy to be mining medium-capitalization stocks. ``Generally the 
mid-cap universe has companies that are growing faster, significantly 
faster, than large caps, and yet the valuations are significantly 
cheaper,'' he said. Finding stocks with reasonable price-to-earnings 
multiples is one component of his conservative approach to growth 
investing. But he is also wary of earnings that climb more than 30 
percent a year; 12 percent to 15 percent is fine with him. That cautious 
bent has not kept Berghuis from making his name as manager of a fund 
that has outperformed its peer group. Since its inception in June 
1992, Mid-Cap Growth has returned 22.4 percent, annualized, through 
Nov. 27, versus 15.4 percent for the average fund in its category, 
according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. 
Berghuis, who is 40, selects stocks from a universe of companies with 
market capitalizations of $750 million to $5 billion. Some funds in 
the mid-cap growth category have bought large-cap stocks to compensate 
for the relative underperformance of mid-caps in recent years, but 
Berghuis said he avoids such ``market-cap creep'' because ``you could 
miss out on a surge in mid-cap stocks.'' He is betting that such a 
surge will come, although he is loath to say exactly when. ``I think 
there's a very good relative valuation story in this sector at the 
moment,'' he said. Berghuis relies heavily on what he calls ``plodders,'' 
companies whose earnings ``fairly reliably grow 12 percent to 15 percent 
a year in a fairly low-risk way.'' But that doesn't mean all of his 
holdings are in that group. The median earnings growth rate of the 
portfolio has hovered around 20 percent since the fund's inception. 
One reason that Berghuis shies away from companies with much higher 
rates, he said, is that such gains are hard to sustain for long periods. 
He also tries to steer clear of momentum stocks, whose prices can 
surge on speculation. ``Once in a while a stock that I own may become 
a momentum stock,'' he said. ``I tend to err on the side of getting 
out early, and sometimes when I've done that, the stocks have even 
doubled again after I've sold them. But it's better than being there 
when the music stops.'' Berghuis sometimes bets on the flip side of 
the momentum coin, buying after the momentum players exit and a stock's 
price falls. An example is his recent purchase of shares in Whole 
Foods Market, a retailer of natural foods. Whole Foods stock fell 
from $70.125 in March to $32 in November. He started buying it at 
$35 in October; it now trades at $48. ``I think there was a lot of 
momentum money in that stock, and it came out over the course of a 
couple of months,'' he said. The company sells high-quality perishable 
foods in nearly 90 stores a number that Berghuis estimated could triple 
in a few years, ``niching away'' at the business of mainstream supermarkets. 
He estimates earnings growth at 23 percent for next year. ``I would 
think that the stock price will keep pace with earnings growth in 
the years ahead,'' he said. The stock is selling at 23 times estimated 
1999 earnings. Another recent purchase is CIT Group, a commercial 
lender with a market capitalization of about $4.5 billion. Berghuis 
first bought the stock at $27 in October; it closed on Friday at $29.0625, 
or 12times estimated 1999 earnings. ``If you look at where other commercial 
finance companies trade, this one is at a severe discount,'' he said. 
Berghuis expects 12 percent to 15 percent earnings growth at CIT over 
the next few years. ``Here's a perfect example of sort of the lower 
end of the growth spectrum in the fund, the so-called plodder, but 
I think a fairly reliable plodder,'' he said. CIT's business includes 
equipment financing, leasing, factoring and lending to small businesses. 
Many of its customers are not big enough to show up on the radar screen 
of big banks, Berghuis said, so its field becomes less competitive 
as banks consolidate. Berghuis sometimes sounds like a hard-bitten 
value investor. One beaten-down stock for which he has high hopes 
is Romac International, which offers outsourcing of information technology, 
financial and accounting services. ``It's an out-of-favor stock in 
an out-of-favor sector,'' he said. Fears of an economic slowdown, 
he added, have shaken confidence in the future growth of outsourcing. 
In July, Romac was selling for $32 a share. Berghuis started buying 
at $20 a share in September, and last week it was down to $16.4375, 
still above its low for the year, $11.75 in October. But he said he 
expects Romac earnings to grow at 30 percent in 1999, partly because 
of its acquisition this year of a similar company called Source Services. 
``The blue-chip company in this sector is Robert Half International,'' 
he said. That stock trades for 25 times 1999 earnings. But Romac, 
which Berghuis said ``could be another Robert Half in another few 
years,'' is trading at just 16 times 1999 earnings.
