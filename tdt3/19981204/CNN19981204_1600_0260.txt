James P. Hoffa has a narrow lead in the election to pick a new president 
of the teamsters union. About 10% of the estimated 400,000 ballots 
have been counted. Hoffa has 49% of the vote and rival Tom leedham 
has 46%. Hoffa lost the 1996 union election to Ron Carey who was later 
ousted for using illegal campaign contributions. Hoffa's father Jimmy 
was elected teamsters president in 1957. He disappeared in 1975 while 
trying to regain the top job.
