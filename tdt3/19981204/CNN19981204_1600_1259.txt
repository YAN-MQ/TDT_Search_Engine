I'm Cindy Beaumont and this is "CNN Headline Sports." Lou Holtz's 
move from the booth to the sidelines is a done deal. The CBS announcer 
will replace Brad Scott. I'm here because I believe in this state 
and in this school. I'm here because I believe in the quality of life 
that the state of South Carolina offers.
