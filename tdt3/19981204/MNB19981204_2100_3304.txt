We'll be back here with the first look at the Saturday morning newspapers 
this Friday night. Did you know harsh winter weather can leave even 
unexposed skin itchy and dry? Did you know moisturizers aren't always 
up to the challenge of itchy, dry skin? That's why there's new cortizone 
10 plus. Among these, only cortizone 10 plus has 10 moisturizers, 
like aloe and vitamins, plus the power of cortizone 10 to stop itch 
and help heal. So for itchy patches of dry skin, even eczema or psoriasis, 
try new cortizon10 plus. Folklore has it the spices they cook with 
in the west indies are aphrodisiacs. As if in a place like this, you 
need any help. Royal Caribbean. Like no vacation on earth.
