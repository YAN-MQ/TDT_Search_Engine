On Monday, the U.S. government working group on electronic commerce 
released a study that finds a growing share of the world's business 
is now being conducted over the Internet. The growth is expected to 
continue. The report was released at the White House in a gathering 
which brought together key members of the Clinton administration and 
leaders of the high-technology industry. Among the executives was 
John Chambers, the president and chief executive officer of Cisco 
Systems, a company that specializes in the manufacture of equipment 
that helps to make electronic or e-commerce possible. I do not think 
it's an understatement to say that 5 percent of the global commerce 
in the world by the year 2005 will travel over the Internet. By the 
year 2010, 25 percent of the world's commerce will travel over the 
Internet. In short, it will change retail forever. John Chambers says 
that the Internet will also change the way we live. When you think 
about how it's going to change our lives, it will create a level playing 
field between small companies and big companies, not only in this 
country but truly on a global basis, and more and more business and 
government leaders are understanding the implications of that around 
the world. President Clinton told the gathering that technology is 
the engine of tomorrow's economy. He said that his administration 
is in favor of strong consumer protection and privacy rights, and 
he called for self-regulation rather than legislation. We have to 
make ourselves absolutely committed to the proposition that we will 
first do no harm. We will do nothing that undermines the capacity 
of emerging technologies to the lives of ordinary Americans and, secondly, 
that insofar as we can, we will help to create an environment which 
will enhance the likelihood of success. Information technology now 
accounts for more than a third of our economic growth.
