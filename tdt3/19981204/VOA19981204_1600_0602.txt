Good news out of Africa may often seem scarce, but at a meeting this 
week in the capitol of Zimbabwe, their focus is on positive changes 
sweeping the continent. Lawrence Bartlet reports from Hirare, on a 
meeting of the Global Coalition for Africa, or GCA, which brings African 
leaders together with western donor nations. The first indications 
that this is a conference with a difference is on the cover of the 
Global Coalition for Africa annual report. It says overall trends 
in Africa continue to be positive despite difficulties associated 
with the process of profound change. The GCA unites African leaders 
and their partners in western countries in seeking programs of action 
on the continents most critical social and economic development issues. 
Executive Secretary Amadu Ul Dobdala Morizania says that while media 
reports give the impression that civil unrest is a norm in Africa 
it would be more accurate to describe the conference as undergoing 
promising economic and political change. There is more space for democratic 
activity. There is more freedom from stress of association of political 
debate. Everything is relative compared to what is in Europe we have 
a lot, a lot to do, but compared to the recent three to five years 
what we are witnessing now is almost revolution. But GCA conferences 
have focused on issues such as economic development and corruption. 
In Herari delegates from 27 African, North American, and European 
countries are looking at the role and functioning of parliaments in 
Africa. Mr. Ul Dobdala says the old African idea of a big man president 
and an all powerful one body system was giving way under increasing 
pressure for the participation of all interest groups in the running 
of the country. I am optimistic about Africa because Africans are 
aware of their guilds, more and more, and they are not going to accept 
that one person, president or not, or prime minister, addresses and 
solves all of the problems of every party. Those attending the Herari 
conference, will no doubt agree. Lawrence Bartlet for VOA News, Herari.
