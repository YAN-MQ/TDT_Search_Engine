I'm John Bershard, VOA News. Britain has indicated that it is committed 
to building a European defense structure, marking a turn around from 
years of British opposition to the idea. Prime Minister Tony Blair 
and French president Jacques Chirac signed a joint statement Friday 
calling for an autonomous European defense force to respond to international 
crisis. Mr. Blair says that such a force would be in full conformity 
with existing alliances, in particular NATO. The move comes at the 
end of a Franco-British summit being held at the French port of San 
Milean.
