Renada Daniel-Patterson's relationship with her father began when 
she was 13 years old and he called from prison, offering her his kidney. 
Renada, born with only one kidney _ an unhealthy one _ had been on 
dialysis three times a week for seven years, unable to go to school, 
stay with friends or dream too far in the future. David Patterson, 
serving time at California State Prison in Sacramento for burglary, 
had abandoned Renada when she was a baby. ``He called out of the blue,'' 
recalls Vicki Daniel, Renada's mother. But when he turned out to be 
a compatible donor, all was forgiven. For two years, Renada lived 
as a healthy girl for the first time in her life. Often, she even 
skipped her medicine. Then her kidney _ her father's kidney _ began 
to fail. She needs a new kidney again. Her father, who is 38 and due 
to remain in prison for three more years, wants to give his daughter 
the one kidney he has left. When Renada's nephrologist at the University 
of California San Francisco/Stanford Health Care Medical Center balked, 
citing the Hippocratic oath that requires doctors to ``first, do no 
harm,'' Renada's mother protested and pleaded. After the family met 
with doctors and hospital administrators, Renada's case was referred 
to the university's bioethics committee, which is now confronting 
an unprecedented situation. Does it agree to save the life of a 16-year-old 
girl knowing that it is also sentencing her father to a painful life 
of medical treatment, with his existence constantly threatened? And 
how should the fact that he is a prisoner, who would be taxing the 
system with dialysis treatment costing $40,000 a year, factor into 
a decision? Dr. Wade Smith, chairman of the university medical center's 
bioethics committee, said that the committee would have to consider 
the rules of organ donation. ``There is a question,'' he said, ``of 
whether this procedure would be violating the surgeon by harming the 
donor.'' As the ethics committee weighed its decision Friday, Mrs. 
Daniel, with Renada in a hospital bed, and several ministers supporting 
the family, held a news conference in the medical center lobby. She 
urged the public to flood the hospital's telephones, both with offers 
of kidneys and, especially, with words of support for the transplant 
Renada's father has offered. With 3,100 patients on a waiting list 
for a kidney in northern California, and the average wait three and 
a half years, Mrs. Daniel said that Renada should not have to wait 
when doctors cannot say for sure how dire her condition is and the 
family has a willing donor in Patterson. ``I'm appalled that the ethics 
committee would even consider entering this,'' Mrs. Daniel said, as 
Renada, flanked by an adopted younger sister and a friend, wept in 
her bed. ``This is a family issue. We want the world to know that 
this man is giving himself to his daughter. We're demanding that the 
State of California honor this man.'' Medical ethics scholars seem 
divided over just what the ethical implications of Patterson's offer 
are. Hank Greeley, chairman of the steering committee of Stanford 
University's Center for Biomedical Ethics, said that a father, in 
most situations, should be allowed to make a sacrifice for his daughter. 
``It makes me nervous, but I can't see any good, strong reason to 
prevent this parental sacrifice,'' he said. ``Parents make all sorts 
of sacrifices for their children and we don't normally see that as 
unethical, even in the extreme cases when the parent gives his life 
for a child. In fact, we normally see it as praiseworthy.'' Patterson's 
offer poses an ethical problem in part because he is in prison, Greeley 
said. ``Would there be a question if he could pay for this himself?'' 
he said. ``Should the health care system participate?'' And, ``Does 
it somehow taint or pollute the health care system that it's participating 
in this self-sacrificing act?'' Arthur Caplan, director of the Center 
for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania and author of ``Am 
I My Brother's Keeper? The Ethical Frontiers of Biomedicine,'' addressed 
the issue bluntly: ``You don't ever want to kill a person to say you 
saved another life.'' ``There's never been a live kidney transplant 
where someone has gone from one to none,'' Caplan said, adding that 
the life of a person on dialysis may be severely threatened. because 
10 percent of patients do not do well with the treatment. ``There's 
no guarantee he could do dialysis,'' he said. Caplan was also concerned 
about giving another kidney to a patient who was not diligent in taking 
her medicine. ``Not only using the second kidney, but using it in 
a situation where someone has gone off their medicine, who has shown 
themself noncompliant, would be a gross violation of medical ethics,'' 
he said. Finally, he said, letting Patterson donate his kidney would 
contradict why he is in jail: to be punished. Prisoners, he said, 
should not be allowed to donate organs. ``We normally don't use prisoners 
as donors. One of the aspects of punishment is a prisoner's restrictions 
on certain things, including voting, running for office and donating 
an organ.'' There is a question of whether Renada's body would even 
accept another kidney from her father. Even though she was a compatible 
recipient before, when she did not take the medicine required to make 
the transplant successful _ it bloated her face, distended her stomach, 
made her feel ill and hunched her back _ her body may have decided 
that her father was no longer an acceptable donor. ``I think that 
the fact that a person rejected an organ is germane to the issue of 
receiving an organ from the same donor again,'' said Dr. Nancy Ascher, 
a professor of surgery at the University of California at San Francisco 
Medical Center. ``Whether the organ was rejected because the medication 
wasn't taken, the body may have decided that this organ is incompatible 
and will be so again,'' she said. ``The person would probably have 
to be retested.'' When Patterson first offered to donate his kidney 
to Renada, he went through months of complicated negotiations between 
prison and hospital officials and the family. That issue would most 
likely arise again, since Patterson would still be in the prison system 
as a dialysis patient. His original sentence of seven years was increased 
by five years when he was found with heroin less than two years ago. 
Billy Mayfield, a spokesman for the California State Prison at Sacramento, 
said Patterson has already spoken to doctors at the prison and that 
he understands the medical implications of his decision. The state, 
by law, would pay for his dialysis, which would cost an estimated 
$40,000 a year. ``In talking with David, his heart seems to be in 
the right place,'' he said. ``With respect to his daughter, I guess 
I can speak for most fathers when I say I would have done the same 
for my daughter. To go from a parent where you have no relationship 
with your daughter to one where you're giving her your kidney is a 
pretty amazing turnaround.'' Since Patterson donated his kidney to 
Renada, the two have been in constant contact, Mrs. Daniel said. They've 
been writing and calling each other, and Renada has visited him. ``She 
loves her father,'' Mrs. Daniel said, as Renada, in her bed, covered 
her face and cried. ``But I know she wants his kidney, too.''
