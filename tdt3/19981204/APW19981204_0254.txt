A Palestinian university student who participated in an attack on 
an Israeli soldier and seized his M-16 assault rifle has been arrested, 
a senior Palestinian official said Friday. The rifle was handed over 
to the governor of the West Bank town of Ramallah, Mustafa Issa, on 
Wednesday night, several hours after about a dozen Palestinians pelted 
an Israeli car with stones, pulled the soldier out of the vehicle 
and struck him repeatedly in the head with rocks. The soldier escaped 
with head injuries. The incident, captured by TV cameras, triggered 
an outrage in Israel and led to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 
decision to suspend the upcoming West Bank troop withdrawal. The Palestinian 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the M-16 was handed 
over by Palestinian university students not involved in the attack 
on the soldier. One of the students was held for questioning, however, 
and later the student who had seized the M-16 was arrested. Israel 
and the Palestinians have blamed each other for the violence, which 
came days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to arrive in the 
region to usher in the second stage of the Wye River land-for-security 
agreement.
