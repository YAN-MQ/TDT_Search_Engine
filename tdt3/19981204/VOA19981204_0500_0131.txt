Secretary Albright also reaffirmed U.S. determination to fight for 
human rights around the world. A U.S.-based human rights watchdog 
has issued its yearly report that contains both good and bad news 
about human rights around the world. The 500-page report issued Thursday 
by Human Rights Watch comes 50 years after the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. Here's Executive Director Kenneth Roth. Certainly, 
we have much progress that we can celebrate in much of Latin America, 
the former Soviet Union, Southern Africa, even parts of Asia, but, 
nonetheless, serious violent abuses stubbornly persist in too many 
parts of the world. The report concerns -- or says concern over human 
rights now goes beyond political prisoners to include refugees, homosexuals, 
women and children, as well as ethnic and religious minorities, and 
it says the good news must be tempered by the knowledge that serious 
problems still persist and points to what it considers repressive 
governments in Burma, China, Iraq, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and 
Turkmenistan. The report also notes war in Algeria, Colombia, and 
Kosovo.
