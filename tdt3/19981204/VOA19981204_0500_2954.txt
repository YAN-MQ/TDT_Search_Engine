It is Universal Time. And here's the major news story we are following 
for you this hour. The U.S. space shuttle "Endeavour" makes a perfect

It's carrying the first addition to the international space station 
and will rendezvous with an orbiting space module later today. An 
update on that story coming up in about 11 minutes.
