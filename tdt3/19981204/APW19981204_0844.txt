A Palestinian university student who participated in an attack on 
an Israeli soldier and seized his M-16 assault rifle has been arrested, 
a senior Palestinian official said Friday. The rifle was handed over 
to the governor of the West Bank town of Ramallah hours after about 
a dozen Palestinians pelted an Israeli car with stones Wednesday, 
pulled the soldier out of the vehicle and struck him repeatedly in 
the head with rocks. The soldier escaped with head injuries. The incident, 
captured by TV cameras, triggered an outrage in Israel and led to 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to suspend the upcoming 
West Bank troop withdrawal. The Palestinian official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said the M-16 was handed over by Palestinian 
university students not involved in the attack on the soldier. One 
of the students was held for questioning, however, and later the student 
who had seized the M-16 was arrested. The officials wouldn't identify 
the student. The army spokesman's office said the Palestinian Authority 
had pledged to take steps against those involved in the attack. A 
preliminary Israeli army investigation into the incident found that 
the soldier under attack, Cpl. Assaf Meyara, 19, should have fired 
on his assailants, the Yediot Ahronot daily said. Meyara will likely 
be charged in military court with violating army procedures, the newspaper 
said. However, the army spokesman's office said that although Meyera 
did violate army procedure by carrying a weapon that was unloaded, 
the investigation was still ongoing as to whether he should have loaded 
it and opened fire. Meyera's mother Lisa said she was taken aback 
by the onslaught of criticism complaining that her son didn't use 
his gun. ``It basically makes me feel that they prefer having him 
open fire and end up dead - a dead hero,'' Meyera said in an interview 
with Associated Press Television News. Israel and the Palestinians 
have blamed each other for the violence, which came days before U.S. 
President Bill Clinton was to arrive in the region to usher in the 
second stage of the Wye River land-for-security agreement.
