With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
Temperatures still holding on. Across the southeastern U.S. from the 
mid-atlantic to the gulf coast and into southern Texas, mostly 60s 
and 70s, but cold into the northern rockies. Here's the reason why. 
Several weather disturbances, one moving out of the great basin promises 
just a bit of snowfall into the northern Rockies and the great plains 
where temperatures previously have been quite nice in the last couple 
of days. Also a little disturbance in the Mississippi river valley 
and the Ohio valley may trigger a couple of thunderstorms. And more 
wet weather is expected in the northwest. And more showers and windy 
conditions in the Hawaiian islands and sections of the Caribbean. 
Our extended forecast is looking at very cold temperatures in the 
pacific northwest, but very mild in the southeast and the mid-atlantic. 
On Sunday, it looks like the snow is flying around the Great Lakes 
with thunderstorms possible farther to the south. More rain for the 
pacific northwest. On Monday, lots of cold temperatures into the Rockies, 
for the Great Lakes and the midwest. For more weather information, 
log on to CNN.com.
