Lawyers for President Clinton have told the House Judiciary Committee 
that they need three to four days to present their impeachment defense 
of President Clinton. The lawyers proposed to call three panels of 
witnesses to discuss such issues as constitutional standards for impeachment, 
standards for prosecution and prosecutorial misconduct. As of now, 
the committee schedule allots only one day for the president's lawyers, 
next Tuesday. The schedule calls for closing arguments next Wednesday 
followed by debate on Thursday and a vote by the weekend.
