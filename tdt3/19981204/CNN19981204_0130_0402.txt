Health care company Johnson & Johnson is cutting its workforce. It 
says it's going to eliminate 4,100 jobs in the United States and overseas 
to free money for research and development and better compete in the 
drug business. The New Jersey-based company says the cuts will be 
made over the next year and a half by closing 36 of its 158 manufacturing 
plants.
