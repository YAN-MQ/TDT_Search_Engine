Nigerian military jets destroyed a Sierra Leonean rebel base in four 
days of bombing raids, killing at least 70 fighters and capturing 
a swath of rebel-held territory, military officers said Friday. The 
attacks between Tuesday and Friday against the rebel base near the 
town of Gberay, about 75 miles (125 kilometers) north of Sierra Leone's 
capital, was launched by the Nigerian-led West African intervention 
force called ECOMOG, intervention force spokesman Paul Aghimimen said. 
The rebels include remnants of Sierra Leone's junta which was ousted 
from the capital by ECOMOG earlier this year. Together with a traditional 
Sierra Leonean militia force, ECOMOG troops and planes continue to 
support the restored government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. The 
junta took power during a bloody May 1997 coup that forced President 
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah into 10 months of hiding. Aghimimen said the raids 
resulted in the capture of a 40-mile (60 kilometer) stretch of road 
linking the northeast town of Makeni with the capital. No civilians 
were killed in the latest raids and ECOMOG promised not to launch 
attacks against targets where villagers and other non-combatants are 
at risk, Aghimimen said. The rebels have been blamed by aid workers 
and villagers for committing thousands of murders, torture and rape 
against innocent civilians in an apparent campaign of revenge for 
their ouster.
