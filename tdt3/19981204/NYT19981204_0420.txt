Jeff Gordon is accustomed to spending his time in stock cars _ testing 
them, racing them to victories at an uncanny pace. But for the past 
few days, the Nascar superstar has made the news media rounds in Manhattan, 
spending time on television with Matt Lauer, Regis and Kathie Lee, 
and Brian Williams; doing magazine photo shoots; and dining at establishments 
like Le Cirque 2000, which presented him with a chocolate race car, 
and Le Bernardin, where he lunched on sea bass. At a March of Dimes 
benefit, he approached Yankees Manager Joe Torre, who was receiving 
an award. ``But before I did,'' Gordon said Friday, ``he went on about 
the Nascar season. I said, `I wanted to tell you we had a New York 
Yankees-type season,' and he said, `No, you had a better season.''' 
Gordon's whirl of appearances led to Friday night's annual Nascar 
banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria, where he received a $2.9 million check 
for winning his third Winston Cup championship during a season in 
which he won 13 races. Gordon's winnings totaled $9.3 million, and 
he earned millions more in salary, endorsements and licensing. ``What 
drives me is how to get to victory lane,'' he said during an interview 
earlier Friday with editors and reporters of The New York Times. ``If 
I don't win, I try to figure out how I'm going to win next weekend.'' 
Next season, in addition to his Winston Cup schedule, he will return 
to the Busch Grand National circuit, where he was rookie of the year 
in 1991. He will be racing for his wife, Brooke, who owns the race 
team. Ray Evernham, his Winston Cup crew chief, will also handle the 
Busch races. ``We're going to Las Vegas, Texas, Michigan and to both 
Charlotte races,'' Gordon said. ``We're using Busch to help us on 
Winston Cup. We're going to Vegas because we ran so poorly there. 
And we need laps at Texas. We've had a lot of interest from sponsors 
and people who want to work for us.'' Two of Gordon's Winston Cup 
sponsors, Pepsi and Frito-Lay, will join the Busch team. ``I like 
the idea of being involved at another level,'' he said. Nascar doesn't 
mind, either. Bill France Jr., the president of Nascar, said the Busch 
series, while successful, has a bit of an identity crisis that Gordon 
may help remedy. ``It's the best-kept secret in motor sports,'' France 
said. ``But we did a focus group and one person said, `I'll tell you 
what, you ought to let Bill France run it.' He didn't know it was 
connected to Nascar.'' Gordon's success has made him one of America's 
best-paid athletes and one of the most sought-after by corporations 
seeking his endorsement. He is too careful to criticize other athletes 
for complaining about multimillion-dollar contracts, but he believes 
he deserves what he's getting. ``I don't want any more money than 
I feel is fair,'' he said, then added, ``Not too many people want 
to risk their lives in a car every weekend.'' Nascar is in a fortunate 
position. Its ratings are second in sports only to the National Football 
League's. There is no labor unrest because there are no unions. The 
racers are independent contractors who have a symbiotic relationship 
with sponsors who pay to keep their expensive cars running. ``The 
other sports have employee-employer relationships,'' France said. 
``We're partners with Jeff, with the fans, the tracks, the sponsors.'' 
If he owned a team in the National Basketball Association, France 
said, he would use the Nascar model. ``I'd have them dress in long 
pants so I can put logos all over them,'' he said. Perhaps, he suggested, 
teams could reduce salaries if sponsors enriched players directly.
