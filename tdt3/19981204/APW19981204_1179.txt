Reggae artist Maxi Priest arrived in Kenya on Friday to gear up for 
what promoters hoped would be the largest pop music concert ever. 
Priest, South African reggae hit Lucky Dube, Levi Roots and Jamaican 
Johnny Clark were among the top billings for Sunday's outdoor concert 
at the Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi, a venue that can accommodate 100,000 
people. On Friday, however, the concert's promoter said only 15,000 
to 20,000 tickets had been sold. Priest, who arrived in Kenya Friday 
to headline the concert of local and foreign performers, said it was 
his first visit to Kenya. ``It's great,'' he said. ``The people are 
wonderful.'' Another performer, Levi Roots, said the visit to Kenya 
was the pinnacle of his career. He said the concert would be good 
for Kenyans following the Aug. 7 twin bombings at the U.S. Embassies 
in Kenya and Tanzania that claimed the lives of 224 people, most of 
them Kenyan. ``I think the people of Kenya need this right now,'' 
said the reggae artist, who met last week with victims of the bombing. 
Despite the enthusiasm of the artists and the potential size of the 
audience, the concert's organizer and sponsors were not expecting 
it to be a huge moneymaker. ``Sponsorship as a rule is not a moneymaking 
exercise per se, in other words, you don't actually make a profit.'' 
said Alasdair Musselwhite, East African marketing manager for Guinness 
breweries, the event's major sponsor. Dean Gordon, of Barrow Gordon 
Associates which is promoting the concert, hopes to build a long-term 
investment in entertainment in Kenya, a nearly nonexistent enterprise 
to date because everything, including whether the artist will show 
up, is often unpredictable. Partner Paul Barrow said he has been working 
on the show for two years, ever since his mother fell ill during a 
Christmas trip to the Kenyan coast and he spent several weeks awaiting 
her recovery. Barrow had time to chat with the local workers, who 
talked of their love for music, especially Lucky Dube. That's when 
he got the idea and opened an East African branch of Barrow Gordon 
in Kenya. But putting the program together has not been easy, Barrow 
said. ``We have been through every emotion under the sun to get this 
thing done,'' he said. ``Sometimes we don't know whether to laugh 
or cry.'' Barrow said international sponsors led by Guinness financed 
the brunt of expenses, although he would not say how much the show 
would cost, what the artists were being paid, or how much money had 
been recouped in the sales of tickets for the all-day show beginning 
10 a.m (7 a.m. GMT) Sunday. Main area tickets sell for Kenyan shillings 
400 per person (dlrs 6) and VIP tickets cost shillings 1,500 (dlrs 
25).
