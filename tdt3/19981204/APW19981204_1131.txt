Christiane Mitterwallner of Austria, never better than 19th in four 
years of World Cup racing, surprised herself and her heavily favored 
teammates Friday by winning a women's World Cup super-G. Renate Goetschl, 
who won two downhills for Austria last weekend in Canada, was giving 
interviews and receiving handshakes and hugs from the other skiers 
when Mitterwallner, 24, moved into the gate as the 37th starter. Skiing 
on a sun-baked course that remained fast throughout the day despite 
soft snow, Mitterwallner caught everyone's attention when she reached 
the midway point .20 seconds faster than Goetschl. Mitterwallner crossed 
the finish line in 1 minute, 15.64 seconds, only .05 better than Goetschl, 
who was .04 better than Germany's Martina Ertl. Mitterwallner seemed 
confused by the roar that greeted her arrival, then saw with unbelieving 
eyes that her name was atop the leaderboard. She seemed almost ready 
to faint as she held her hands to her head, then sank to her knees 
in the snow. Despite the almost tropical conditions following an overnight 
storm, many late starters followed Mitterwallner's lead and punched 
in startling results. Eight of the top 15 finishers started outside 
the top seed, with the highest being No. 46 Katie Monahan of Aspen, 
Colorado, who placed eighth. Another American, Megan Gerety of Anchorage, 
Alaska, started 35th and placed 13th. Some of the pre-race favorites 
finished well down the order. World Cup overall points leader Alexandra 
Meissnitzer of Austria, who won last week's first super-G of the season, 
settled for sixth this time. Germany's Hilde Gerg, a former World 
Cup super-G champion, was only 23rd. Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, a former 
overall champion, tied for 44th.
