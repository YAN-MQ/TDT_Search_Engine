In recent months, we brought you several stories about John Stanford, 
the retired army general who became Seattle's superintendent of schools 
and a Passionate advocate for children. He lost his battle with leukemia 
last week. And today he was buried at Arlington national cemetery 
with full military honors. General Colin Powell and education secretary 
Richard Riley were among the mourners. Stanford's body was carried 
by the same Caisson that carried John F. kennedy's. One friend said 
Stanford loved Seattle's children and those who taught them and that 
his confidence and optimism would live in all their hearts.
