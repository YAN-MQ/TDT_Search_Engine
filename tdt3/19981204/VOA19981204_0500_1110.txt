Former Notre Dame head football coach Lou Holtz has reportedly agreed 
to take over the job at the University of South Carolina, replacing 
Brad Scott. Holtz is 61 years old and left Notre Dame in 1996 for 
a television football analyst's job. He is Notre Dame's second winningest 
coach with a record of 100 wins, 30 losses, and 2 ties during his 
11-year tenure with the fighting Irish. He won the national title 
at Notre Dame in 1988.
