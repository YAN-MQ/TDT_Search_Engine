The Rwandan army has killed more than 250 Hutu rebels during recent 
fighting in the northwest of the country, the private Rwanda News 
Agency reported Friday. Citing military sources, the agency said at 
least two rebel battalions, made up of as many as 1,200 men, had been 
cornered near the Gishwati Forest where fighting took place between 
Nov. 16 and 27. The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen 
responsible for the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis 
and politically moderate Hutus. The killing ended when Tutsi-led rebels 
won power in July 1994, sending thousands of defeated soldiers to 
the neighboring former Zaire. Many still have bases in what is now 
called Congo, from where they have been launching cross-border attacks. 
Since August, more than 650,000 people, mostly Hutus, have fled their 
homes in northwestern Rwanda to seek protection from the army in 19 
makeshift camps. Rebel extortion, harassment and killings of both 
Tutsis and Hutus who refuse them food, money or shelter have increasingly 
turned the population against the insurgents.
