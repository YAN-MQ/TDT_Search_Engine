U.S. envoy Anthony Lake is in Ethiopia launching a new bid to resolve 
the border dispute between Ethiopia and its neighbor, Entrea. The 
State Department says it believes progress is possible and has warned 
of grave consequences if a peaceful solution is not found soon. This 
visit is the third to the heart of Africa by Mr. Lake in recent months.
