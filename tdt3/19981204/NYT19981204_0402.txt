Sure, it was pleasant for Kevin Kane, a 43-year-old playwright, to 
stroll Central Park in a T-shirt and khaki shorts. Who wouldn't enjoy 
late May warmth in early December? But as the temperature climbed 
to a record-breaking 74 degrees, Kane could not shake the feeling 
that heat in December was unnatural and possibly an ominous sign of 
problems like global warming. ``It's a little scary,'' he said. ``It's 
strange. I worry about my daughter.'' But many of the people walking 
or jogging or sunning themselves in the park were simply luxuriating 
in the unseasonable spring. After seven consecutive days, some were 
beginning to take the warmth for granted, like Floridians who think 
that Christmas shopping in sandals and a T-shirt is perfectly normal. 
For many New Yorkers, it no longer seemed peculiar to go outside without 
a sweater, let alone a jacket, or to enter a subway car and feel a 
chilly blast from the air-conditioning. As a rider on the No. 1 line 
pointed out briskly: ``It's 70 degrees outside.'' In fact, customers 
who had rented air-conditioning units for their homes and procrastinated 
about returning them were calling to request extensions, said Mel 
Parker, owner of Aabco, a Manhattan air-conditioning repair and rental 
store. A quick scan of the crowds in midtown Manhattan indicated that 
most people had dressed appropriately for the occasion. Relatively 
few were carrying _ let alone wearing _ coats or jackets. And if hot 
chocolate wasn't selling, ice cream definitely was. The Ben &AMP; 
Jerry's at Times Square dispensed almost twice as many cones as usual 
in December, said Heidy Ardon, the supervisor. All over Bryant Park, 
people on lunch breaks were lounging outside, chewing and sipping 
and reading and talking. ``I haven't brought my jacket at all this 
week,'' said Craig Van Steenbergen, an architect from Fairfield, Conn., 
as he smoked a cigar. Throughout the Northeast, as far north as Vermont 
and Maine, people were carrying their coats or leaving them at home 
and treating themselves to cups of frozen yogurt and ice cream. There 
were record-high temperatures in Newark, N.J., where it hit 75 degrees; 
Bridgeport, Conn., which reached 72 degrees, and Providence, R.I., 
at 71 degrees. In Concord, N.J., where temperatures reached 66 degrees, 
2 degrees below the record, a United Parcel Service deliveryman could 
be seen making his rounds in shorts. Sarah Fisher, a bank employee 
in Providence, N.J., pronounced the weather ``absolutely fabulous,'' 
as she basked in the sun Friday afternoon. For the most part, people 
seem to be taking the warmth _ which has extended along the East Coast 
and across the entire country _ in stride. But for weather-watchers, 
this out-of-season heat had created excitement. ``This gets my juices 
going,'' said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist with the Pennsylvania 
State University weather communication group. ``This is a truly extraordinary 
weather pattern.'' But it is rapidly nearing its end, he said. This 
weekend should be brisk and considerably cooler, with temperatures 
in the low 50s. The weather _ which has been warm for a week from 
San Francisco across to the Rocky Mountains, and the Midwest, and 
from the South up into Maine _ has been the result of floods of temperate 
air masses from the Pacific Ocean. This is contrary to the typical 
pattern this time of year of air masses that move down from Canada. 
The unusual air-mass movements have created the second-warmest year, 
through October, for the entire country since records were first compiled 
in 1895. ``Air over the Pacific is a heck of a lot warmer than air 
from Canada,'' Gadomski said. The record-breaking heat Friday in and 
around New York was enhanced by winds flowing down from the Catskill 
Mountains, he said. ``As the air is forced downhill from the mountains, 
it compresses, which warms it,'' Gadomski said. By Tuesday, chilly 
weather should return, he said. The temperature will drop to the 40s 
during the day, and there may be snow in and around northern New York. 
For some _ say, the people selling Christmas trees and the managers 
of the Wollman and Rockefeller Center ice-skating rinks _ that will 
come as welcome news. ``I've been telling people I should be selling 
palm trees instead of balsam firs,'' said Alan Johnston, who came 
down from Quebec City for the month to work at the tree stand at 94th 
Street and Broadway. Sales have been very slow, he said. ``People 
aren't used to buying trees in such warm weather.'' Clay Courter, 
the manager of a high-rise building in San Diego, had been looking 
forward to ``Christmas weather.'' In anticipation, he spent $400 on 
a heavy winter coat, which he left in the hotel room. ``Needless to 
say, that's where it will stay.'' Ron Williams, 30, and Jay Funderburke, 
32, visiting from Donaldsville, Ga., seemed determined to have a good 
time in New York, despite the un-Christmasy heat. ``I'm still seeing 
the city,'' said Williams, who was looking forward to his first experience 
of snow. ``But,'' he added dolefully, ``it would really be nicer if 
it was cold.''
