To southern California now, home to plenty of examples of nature's 
wrath, from earthquakes and brushfires to mudslides and medflies. 
And now, it's the invasion of the fire ants. Here's NBC's Mike Boettcher. 
An army that conquered the south is invading California and taking 
aim on the rest of the country -- red fire ants. That little queen's 
is capable of starting a new colony all by herself. This week in orange 
county, south of Los Angeles, the destructive fire ant's newest invasion 
was uncovered, bad news for the entire west coast and particularly 
for California's huge agricultural industry. Ants will survive anywhere 
where there's enough moisture and mild conditions, and this is it. 
This may be the garden of Eden for fire ants here. 70 years ago, the 
south American fire ant was first discovered in the deep south and 
quickly spread from Texas to Florida, but the west was relatively 
fire ant free until now. What is really ironic, when I was a kid I 
wanted an ant farm. Now Henry sakaida has an 80-acre ant farm. The 
orange county nursery owner knows that fire ants will eat anything, 
including his plants. Business is about to be bad. We're not going 
to go out of business, but it's really going to hurt. It hurt in Texas 
where the aggressive and voracious fire ants cause about $300 million 
damage each year to crops and livestock. Nationwide -- the figure, 
a stunning $2 billion. why? One colony can harbor 500,000 ants, and 
rancher Al croix has to keep constant watch on his heard. He's seen 
what fire ants can do when they swarm. I've watched them over a period 
of about six hours completely skeletonize a Snake. And they will attack 
humans, too. Fire ants crawled through the plumbing of this Jackson, 
Mississippi, nursing home and stung a 66-year-old woman to death in 
her bed. Researchers have tried various methods to eradicate fire 
ants, but nothing has been effective. As they've learned in the south 
and soon will learn in California, fire ants adapt, becoming resistant 
to any chemical used against them -- a Living fire, virtually impossible 
to put out. Mike Boettcher, NBC news, Los Angeles.
