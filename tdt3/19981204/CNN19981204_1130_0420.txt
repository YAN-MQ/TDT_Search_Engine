I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
A nice warm day again in the southeast and along the gulf coast. Back 
into the northeast, today, daytime highs into the 60s today. See the 
colder weather, though, back into the Rockies and extending into the 
northern midwest, 20s and 30s for highs. Forecast calls for snow to 
continue to push from the northern Rockies in through the upper midwest 
as we head on into tomorrow. Look for an area of low pressure in the 
associated front to bring some showers and storms in through parts 
of the midwest, and another storm moves into the pacific northwest. 
More rain along the coast and snow is expected in the higher elevations. 
Extended forecast for Sunday, snow is expected in parts of Minnesota 
and back through the northern Great Lakes. Look for temperatures to 
continue to cool off back in through Rockies and parts of the midwest. 
Still warm, though, at least on Sunday, into the southeast. That changes 
around, though, as we head into Monday as the colder temperatures 
begin to filter in. And we'll find good chances for rain in the pacific 
northwest and some snow back in through central sections of the Rockies 
on into Tuesday, with showers and storms likely in the east along 
with the cooler temperatures. For more weather information, log into
