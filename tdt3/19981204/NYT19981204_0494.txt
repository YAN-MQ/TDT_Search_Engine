Commissioner David Stern wore a look of resignation, saying he had 
accepted the idea there may not be a basketball season. Billy Hunter, 
the executive director of the union, rambled on about not accepting 
a bad deal until he ran out of breath himself. It was nearly 1 a.m. 
Friday, and the two principals in the National Basketball Association's 
five-month-old labor war were wrapping up their respective news conferences 
after 11 futile hours of negotiating. Day 157 of the lockout had come 
and gone with barely a trace of progress. Never had the two principals 
discussed so openly the possibility of losing the season. ``There 
may not be a solution, and we accept that,'' Stern said. ``I now recognize 
the possibility, or the likelihood, that the season will expire.'' 
For his part, Hunter said: ``Our players have decided that if push 
comes to shove, and they compel us to miss a season, we'll miss a 
season. Our membership is definitely prepared for that possibility. 
And we're not blowing smoke.'' Eight weeks of the season has been 
lost. Even a surprise settlement next week would mean about a 50-game 
season, a figure thought to be close to a cutoff for having a representative 
season. ``I think we're within striking distance, but there are pretty 
significant issues that separate us right now,'' Hunter said. ``Unless 
they soften their stances on those issues, we're not going to have 
a season.'' Depending on one's view, Stern and Hunter are either crying 
wolf before they reach an 11th-hour compromise or are the culprits 
in what could become the most costly labor debacle in professional 
sports. Either way, Stern, Hunter and their respective bargaining 
teams are running out of time to make a deal and resuscitate the season. 
``We now know everyone agrees on two things,'' Stern said Friday on 
Day 158 of the lockout. ``If we made a deal tomorrow, the season couldn't 
start until January at the earliest. And we're not even negotiating. 
So we're not going to be making a deal anytime soon. In that sense, 
we both agree the season is at risk.'' Hunter said Friday that he 
planned to telephone Stern over the weekend and painted a slightly 
rosier outlook _ if anything can be rosy about the projected loss 
of $400 million in salaries. The union's negotiating committee met 
Friday morning to reaffirm its solidarity and contemplate its next 
move. Among the players to speak Friday was the loquacious Karl Malone, 
who dared Stern to cancel the season. ``If we're going to do the deal, 
let's do it right now,'' said Malone, who last attended a bargaining 
session in August. ``If not, cancel it. Stop teasing the fans. Stop 
stringing people along. I'm willing to sit out the whole year to get 
what's fair. ``They can take the season away, that's Commissioner 
Stern's call. But if you're going to take it away, take it.'' Stern 
continues to refuse to announce a cancellation date. Last month he 
said a settlement would be necessary by mid-December to salvage the 
season. Hunter has a deadline in mind. ``With 200 guys waiting to 
sign free-agent contracts, it would have to be by Jan. 1,'' he said. 
``I'm convinced there's going to be a season and a deal. I don't think 
David and the owners can afford for there not to be a season. There's 
too much at stake.'' Aside from the $1.1 billion in player salaries 
lost, an additional $300 million to $400 million would be lost if 
the entire 82-game schedule and postseason were terminated. An announcement 
is expected next week on the cancellation of the All-Star Game in 
Philadelphia on Feb. 14. There was minor progress on several economic 
issues on Thursday night, with the owners showing flexibility on phasing 
in timing rules in order to address the players' concerns about free 
agency. The players made concessions on the rookie salary scale. Under 
their proposal, an owner after three years would choose one of these 
two options: _ Keep a player at scale for a fourth year, or _ Invoke 
the right of first refusal. The players also made an escrow tax proposal. 
But there are several factors still keeping the two sides apart, including 
agreed-upon percentages for revenue distribution. ``It's not the so-called 
intransigent and greedy owners that are blocking the deal,'' Stern 
said. ``It's no one that's blocking the deal. It's just two sides 
that cannot agree.'' Friday morning after the meeting, Stern used 
a multicolored chart illustrating the owners' proposal in an effort 
to show the news media what he has been trying to show the players: 
that the salary structure proposed by the owners would help the players. 
But Hunter shot it down. He even used the phrase ``hard cap,'' two 
words that have polarized the talks in the past. Hunter added: ``I'm 
not pessimistic. Obviously things are somewhat acute. It's no joke. 
We're moving into the extreme zone. But I feel something will happen.''
