Canadian ice hockey player Chad Silver, who played for Switzerland's 
national team, was found dead in his apartment Thursday. The cause 
of death was not immediately clear, and team officials say an autopsy 
is being ordered. But the investigating judge in the case says there 
was no indication of violence. Silver, who was 29, played in the league 
game Tuesday with no problems and also attended a ZCS Lion's team 
practice on Wednesday.
