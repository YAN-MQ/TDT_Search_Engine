Colombian authorities are reporting a major drug bust with the seizure 
of three metric tons of cocaine. The contraband was seized in the 
port city of Cartagena hidden in a shipment of paint destined for 
the United States. That's a massive haul, but Colombian authorities 
say they are continuing to search the port facilities for more cocaine, 
and they say the final count could be much higher. The seizure Thursday 
was the second major cocaine discovery this year on Cartagena, the 
popular tourist destination at Colombian's Caribbean shores.
