A high school teacher in Tampa, Florida, is suing a school board after 
the school refused to let her discuss the Monica Lewinsky matter in 
her class. The teacher wanted to discuss independent counsel Ken Starr's 
report and President Clinton's federal grand jury testimony with her 
government class. None of the students' parents objected. But the 
school said the material is too sexually explicit for high school 
students. The teacher said her first amendment rights have been violated.
