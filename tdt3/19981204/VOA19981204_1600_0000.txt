France and Britain agree that the European Union should build an independent 
defense force to act if needed to respond to an international crisis. 
The U.S. space shuttle Endeavor, and its crew of five U.S. astronauts 
and one Russian cosmonaut, blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
in a brilliant predawn launch today. Talks begin in New York between 
the U.S. and North Korea. Yon Yung is suspected of trying to hide 
a nuclear weapons plant. We'll have a report. The U.S. House Judiciary 
Committee is preparing to vote next week on articles of impeachment 
against President Clinton. We'll have a report on that. I'm Tony Riggs. 
And I am Erin Brummet, stay tuned for details on all of those stories, 
and we will have a tour along the historic Chesapeake and Ohio canal, 
coming up in this hour of VOA News Now. First a summary of world news.
