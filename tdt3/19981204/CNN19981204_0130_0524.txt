Secretary of state Madeleine Albright said the United States made, 
"Terrible mistakes" in Latin America during the cold war. At a speech 
at Emory University in Atlanta Thursday, Albright said washington's 
one-time backing of Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet was such a mistake. 
In the name of anti-communism, the United States often backed Latin 
american dictatorships during the cold war, and it supported the violent 
coup in which Pinochet took power in 1973.
