A California jury must decide whether a drunken driver killed a devout 
jehovah's witness, or whether the woman died as a result of her refusal 
of a blood transfusion on religious grounds. The woman was seriously 
injured when she was struck by the man's car. She repeatedly told 
emergency workers she did not want a blood transfusion. The jury can 
acquit the defendant of murder charges only if it finds that refusing 
a blood transfusion was the sole cause of death.
