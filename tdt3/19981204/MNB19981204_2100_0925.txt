just ahead. And what did the future hold for the mayor of the city 
of New York? Can he go national? The story from the Sunday "New York 
Times" magazine. Card member since '91. Last year, you visited all 
the high-Churches of golf. You equipped yourself with the finest gear 
money can buy. Fore! And you shot 145... every time you went out. 
Fortunately, by paying for all this with your American express card, 
you earned enough membership rewards points to get some lessons. Yet 
another reason to do more with the American express card. Pretend 
the puppy's a salesperson in an average computer store. Now, ask the 
salesperson a question. What's the difference between dvd and CD rom? 
How much ram do I really need? Oh, and can you guys install software? 
Okay, thanks. We built a different place to buy a computer. Gateway 
country, staffed with trained people who'll have a computer built 
just for you starting as low as $999. Gateway country. Get more out 
of the box. Drop by any store or call 1-800-gateway.
