Another twist in the impeachment battle on Capitol Hill tonight. White 
House lawyers are getting ready to defend the president before the 
house Judiciary committee's impeachment inquiry early next week. Tonight's 
developments have thrown off the committee's schedule. They had hoped 
to send this to the committee by next weekend. Some say this is a 
White House ploy to drag this into the new year.
