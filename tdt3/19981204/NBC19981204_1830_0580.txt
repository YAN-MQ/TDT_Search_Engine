In Huntsville, Texas, tonight, anxiety over the death row escapee 
on the loose has given way to relief, and curiosity, now that one 
of the most intense manhunts in memory has turned up a dead body. 
Here's NBC's Jim Cummins. There is no question that Texas prison officials 
are relieved they found their man. You guys seen this? You notice 
the felony escape thing for Martin gurule? It's all over. Gurule is 
no more. Gurule's body was found after nightfall, floating in harmon 
creek, a mile from death row by two off-duty prison workers, Doug 
Smith and mark Humphrey, who were fishing. It was floating over here, 
and that's when we discovered it. The fishermen said gurule's body 
was badly bloated, meaning it was probably in the water for several 
days. His body was wrapped in cardboard. Investigators speculate that 
homemade body armor enabled gurule to climb over razor wire during 
his daring escape, leaving the other six would-be escapees behind. 
They were not wearing cardboard. The discovery ends one of the most 
intense manhunts in history. For six days, authorities insisted gurule 
was probably inside their seven square mile dragnet. They were right. 
We do believe that the dogs and the intense pressure forced him to 
do something he didn't want to do, that was get into the water to 
get away from the dogs and start swimming. But this case is not closed. 
There will be an investigation to find out how seven men could even 
try and breakout of what was once considered one of the most secure 
death row facilities in the country. Gurule and the other six involved 
in the breakout were considered model prisoners, who qualified for 
a unique work program that uses death row inmates to make clothing 
goods for the prison system. That program has been suspended, pending 
the investigation. There was certainly freedom of movement associated 
with those inmates who were in the program. That's something they 
are going to consider. Late today authorities said the you topcy on 
gurule wound he had one superficial gunshot wound to the back. But 
the cause of death was drowning. Meanwhile, Smith and Humphrey hope 
to collect a $5,000 reward for finding gurule's body. Today, they 
were back on harmon Creek catching catfish. Jim Cummins, NBC news,
