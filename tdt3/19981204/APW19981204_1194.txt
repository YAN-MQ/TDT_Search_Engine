If Scotland can compete in international soccer and rugby, Quebec 
should be able to field its own teams in ice hockey and other sports, 
according to pro-independence lawmakers from the province. The proposal 
was made Thursday by the Bloc Quebecois, which advocates Quebec's 
secession from Canada and holds 45 seats in the federal Parliament. 
The party's leader, Gilles Duceppe, cited the examples of Scotland 
and Wales, which are part of Great Britain yet are allowed to compete 
on their own in international soccer and rugby. Duceppe said Quebec 
deserved similar special status to compete in the ice hockey World 
Cup and possibly in other international events such as the Commonwealth 
Games. The federal government had no immediate response to the proposal. 
More than 80 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French-speakers, 
and there is broad support in the province for greater autonomy. However, 
there has never been a clear majority in favor of outright secession. 
A Quebec ice hockey team would be competitive internationally; several 
of the National Hockey league's best goalies are Quebeckers. The province 
also produces many of Canada's top boxers, free-style skiers and speed 
skaters.
