Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi has recommended that Arab residents 
who were evacuated from their homes in two villages along Israel's 
northern border during the 1948 Mideast war be allowed to return their 
former areas, his office said Friday. In a report he submitted to 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hanegbi wrote that the residents 
of the villages of Baram and Ikrit and their family members be allowed 
to return to areas adjacent to their former villages and that 150 
acres be set aside for the reestablishment of each town, Justice Ministry 
spokeswoman Ettie Eshed said. Eshed said that Hanegbi submitted the 
report to Netanyahu's office in September following consultations 
with top army and internal security officials and in response to years 
of court appeals by the former residents of the villages arguing for 
the right of return. Hanegbi said that a return of the villagers would 
help spark economic growth in the financially depressed area. Now 
the cabinet must vote on whether to approve the Justice Minister's 
recommendations. Netanyahu's office, however, said it rejected Hanegbi's 
findings, Israel Television reported. The villagers who are Christian 
Arabs were told in 1948 by Jewish fighting forces that they needed 
to evacuate for their own safety and would be allowed to return a 
few days later. However, they were never permitted to return and their 
land was distributed among neighboring Jewish settlements, according 
to Israeli Arab lawmaker Salah Tarrif. ``It seems that no government 
will implement such an historic and important decision although it 
is the right and moral thing to do,'' Tarrif said. About 700,000 Palestinians 
fled or were driven out of their homes during the 1948 war, which 
erupted when Arab armies attacked Israel immediately after it declared 
independence. However, Hanegbi said that a decision to allow the residents 
of Baram and Ikrit return to areas close to their villages would not 
be viewed as a precedent to allow others to return to their original 
homes, Israel Television reported.
