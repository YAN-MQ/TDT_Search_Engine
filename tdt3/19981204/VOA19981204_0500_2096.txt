A U.S.-based human rights group has issued its yearly report which 
contains both good and bad news about human rights around the world. 
The 500-page report issued by Human Rights Watch on Thursday comes 
50 years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The group 
says, in the decade since, the world has seen a transformation in 
the way governments are expected to treat their people and each other. 
Human Rights Watch notes improvement in the former Soviet Union, Latin 
America, South Africa, and parts of Asia. The report says concern 
over human rights now goes beyond political prisoners to include refugees, 
homosexuals, women and children, as well as ethnic and religious minorities. 
But it points to what it considers repressive governments in Burma, 
China, Iraq, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Turkmenistan. It is Universal 
Time. This is VOA News Now.
