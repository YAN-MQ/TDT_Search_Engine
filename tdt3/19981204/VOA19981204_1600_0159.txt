The U.S. economy created more jobs than expected last month, and the 
unemployment rate matched a 28 year low. Signs that the economy remains 
strong despite global financial turmoil. President Clinton has hailed 
the new unemployment and job figures. In November the economy added 
more than a quarter of a million jobs, which means that now America 
has created about 17.3 million jobs in the last six years. The Labor 
Department November figures were nearly 100,000 higher than forecast, 
but economist Brian Westbury says that manufacturing jobs took a dive. 
We are done roughly 250,000 jobs in manufacturing. We have seen eight 
months in a row decline in manufacturing jobs once that we adjust 
for the GM strike, and as a result, what I expect to see, is a further 
slowdown in jobs as we move into December and January's numbers. The 
4.4 percent unemployment rate matched 28 year lows set in April and 
may.
