Long-serving players Steve Bruce and Brian McClair left Manchester 
United within the last two years. Now they're among the favorites 
to return to Old Trafford to replace Brian Kidd as assistant to manager 
Alex Ferguson. Dismaying Ferguson, the United players and fans, Kidd 
left United on Thursday to become manager of last place Blackburn, 
his first job as a No. 1. His move comes with United facing up to 
a match against Aston Villa Saturday, with the opportunity of replacing 
Villa at the top of the standings. Next Wednesday, United faces Bayern 
Munich with a quarterfinal place at stake in the Champions Cup. United 
won't rush into naming a replacement but will have several candidates 
in mind, including Bruce and McClair. A long-serving center-back and 
team captain who helped United win three Premier League titles in 
four years and two FA Cups, 37-year-old Bruce is now manager of division 
one Sheffield United. He left Old Trafford for a two-year spell as 
a player with Birmingham City. At Sheffield, Bruce has fought a running 
battle with the owners to gain money to buy players yet has kept the 
club within range of promotion to the top flight. McClair, 34, left 
Old Trafford after 11 years service as a player. Although he has no 
managerial experience, he has qualifications as a coach and has a 
long-standing relationship with Ferguson. He left Manchester United 
in the summer to join one of his former clubs, Motherwell, as a player. 
Mark McGhee, 41, who was fired by division one Wolves a month ago 
after a series of poor results, is a good friend of Ferguson and played 
under him at Aberdeen in the early 1980s. Ferguson may choose to elevate 
reserve team coach Jimmy Ryan, although he probably would prefer someone 
younger than 52. Alex McLeish and Alex Miller, who formed a formidable 
defensive partnership under Ferguson at Aberdeen and helped the club 
win the Cup Winners Cup in 1983, may be contenders after modest successes 
as managers in Scotland. What goes against them is a lack of direct 
contact with the English game. Former Manchester United center-back 
Stewart Houston gained standout results as assistant and then stand-in 
manager of Arsenal after George Graham was fired in 1995. Ferguson 
said that Ryan would be with him at Villa Park on Saturday. ``I will 
take Jim Ryan with me tomorrow,'' he said. ``Jim's a very experienced 
man and he knows the club.''
