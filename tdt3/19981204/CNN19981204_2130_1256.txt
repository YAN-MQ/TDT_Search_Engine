Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." Christmas came early for 
South Carolina football fans. The man who has turned around every 
program that he has coached, Lou Holtz, will now try to build the 
1-10 gamecocks into a winner. Don't think because I'm here that things 
are gonna turn around. We're gonna turn it around because of hard 
work and dedication. I cannot promise you that we will win. I cannot 
promise you we'll win, because the schedule is difficult in the s.E.C., 
but I want to tell you this -- there is no reason in this world why 
we can't be as good as anybody in the country. And our goal -- our 
goal is to win the national championship. The man Holtz replaced, 
Brad Scott, has quickly found a new job and, of all places, as an 
assistant at rival Clemson.
