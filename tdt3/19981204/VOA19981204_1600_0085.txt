the u.s. space shuttle Endeavor lifted off from Kennedy Space Center 
today, carrying the first American module of the international space 
station into orbit. VOA science correspondent David MacLeary reports 
the main task for the six member crew today, they need to check the 
equipment to be used next week in connecting the module with the Russian 
Czaria module launched two weeks ago. Endeavor is to meet Unity with 
Czaria early Monday universal time, beginning the five year process 
of assembling the space station. Later today astronaut Nancy Curry 
will test the shuttle robot arms that she will use to hold Unity in 
place while Endeavor pushes it gently against Czaria's docking port. 
Astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim Neuman will examine the space suits 
that they will wear during their three space walks next week to connect 
power and data cables between the two sections. They will also look 
over the jet propulsion units that they will wear on their backs to 
guide them to safety should they become disconnected to the tethers 
linking them to the orbital. Shuttle commander Bob Cobanna, and pilot 
Rick Stirco are focusing on flying Endeavor. They will begin the series 
of jet firings necessary, over the next few days, to put the shuttle 
in the right altitude and position to meet Czaria. David MacLeary, 
VOA News, Washington.
