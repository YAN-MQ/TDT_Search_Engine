President Clinton went to Rhode Island Thursday to promote new regulations 
for drinking water. At a water treatment facility, he announced the 
federal government is giving states almost $870 million to upgrade 
their water filtration plants. All water treatment facilities must 
be in compliance by 2003. The environmental protection agency estimates 
the changes could prevent as many as 460,000 illnesses. Improvements 
are expected to cost federal, state and local governments about $2.5 
billion over five years. We have got to get over this idea that protecting 
our environment and the quality of our lives is somehow bad for the 
economy. It will be one of the chief generators of high-wage jobs 
in the 21st century, and I hope you here in Rhode Island will lead 
the way. The Clinton administration says for most people, the new 
regulations will add less than $2 to their average monthly water Bill.
