With "CNN Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven. The NBA players and 
owners met for the first time in 13 days on Thursday. Michael Jordan 
even made a surprise appearance. But after 10 1/2 hours of talks, 
little progress was made. It's almost premature to talk about having 
the season. My concern is about not having the season. As I stand 
here today, it's more likely that we will not have the season than 
that we'll have a season.
