The White House and Republicans investigating President Clinton traded 
snide remarks on Friday over what the chairman of the House Judiciary 
Committee has said about perjury and how he really feels about it. 
The chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, unwittingly set the stage for the exchange 
on Tuesday, in his solemn and seemingly uncompromising remarks about 
the evils of lying under oath. ``If citizens are allowed to lie with 
impunity _ or encourage others to tell false stories or hide evidence 
_ judges and juries cannot reach just results,'' said Hyde, R-Ill. 
``At that point, the courtroom becomes an arena for artful liars and 
the jury a mere focus group choosing between alternative fictions.'' 
Hyde's remarks about the sanctity of words given under oath were delivered 
in the investigation of the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky 
and his attempts to keep it secret. But some people recalled what 
Hyde said in 1987, in Congress' inquiry into the Iran-contra affair. 
Defending the Reagan administration, Hyde said condemnation of all 
lying ``just seems to me too simplistic.'' ``In the murkier grayness 
of the real world, choices must often be made,'' Hyde said of the 
Reagan administration's covert aid to anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua. 
Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Friday that Hyde ``shows remarkable 
dexterity in applying standards,'' and that the difference in his 
views over 11 years shows ``more about politics than about conviction.'' 
To which Republicans on the Judiciary Committee replied Friday night, 
``Context does matter, and the facts of the Iran-contra affair and 
President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky could not be more 
different.'' ``No one lied under oath, after swearing to tell the 
truth, and no one ever lied for personal gain,'' said the Republicans' 
statement, issued by their spokesman, Paul McNulty.
