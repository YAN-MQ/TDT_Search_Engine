Hundreds of lawyers, many in black robes, marched to a courthouse 
Friday in solidarity for an attorney who faces three months imprisonment 
for contempt of court in the trial of politician Anwar Ibrahim. Several 
dozen pro-Anwar activists joined the lawyers as they shouted, ``We 
want justice,'' in front of the federal courthouse. At the courthouse, 
Zainur Zakaria won a temporary reprieve when a three-judge bench held 
off on his imprisonment until his appeal could be heard. No date was 
set for the appeal. When Zainur emerged from the courtroom, the lawyers 
clapped and cheered. Had Zainur been sent to jail, it would have been 
the first time in Malaysia that a lawyer was imprisoned for such a 
long period for contempt while defending a client. Previous such sentences 
have been a day or two in jail. Zainur was sentenced Monday after 
he refused to apologize for accusing two prosecutors in Anwar's trial 
of trying to get a potential witness to lie. Zainur's attorney, Raja 
Aziz Addruse, criticized the sentencing by Judge Augustine Paul as 
too harsh, calling it ``irregular.'' Anwar, who denies wrongdoing, 
is being tried on four counts of abuse of power. He will be tried 
later on another charge of corruption and five charges of committing 
illegal sex acts. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar as deputy 
prime minister on Sept. 2, saying he had determined his former protege 
was too immoral to rule. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, prompting protests, 
both at home and abroad. The judge in Anwar's trial has said the allegations 
Zainur filed in an affidavit were insulting to the prosecutors. The 
affidavit had accused senior government prosecutors Abdul Gani Patail 
and Azahar Mohamed of trying to cajole a potential witness into fabricating 
evidence of sex crimes and had demanded that the court remove them. 
Also Friday, about 160 more lawyers joined in the call for a meeting 
of the Malaysian Bar Council to discuss Zainur's treatment. As of 
Thursday, 74 lawyers had called for the meeting for Zinur, a former 
council chairman.
