The government is alleging that citibank helped launder drug money 
for Raul salinas. He is the brother of the former Mexican president. 
A report by the general accounting office says that citibank helped 
Salinas move $100 million to accounts in Switzerland and the United 
Kingdom. The Gao says that citibank violated its own internal controls 
on money laundering in the process. The report found that citibank's 
officers failed to perform a financial background check on Salinas 
when he opened his citibank account in 1992.
