In southeast Utah, three people were injured on a highway Thursday 
after a Natural gas pipeline exploded. Witnesses say the blast sent 
a fireball 100 feet in the air and blew trucks across the road. Police 
say a construction crew may have cut the pipe while installing a new 
pipeline next to it. The road is expected to be reopened Friday morning.
