From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff. 
NPR has learned that House Republicans are considering a plan to minimize 
their impeachment inquiry of President Clinton following election 
results that suggest Americans aren't interested in a drawn out process. 
Sources told NPR's Nina Totenberg Republican leaders tentatively settled 
on a plan to call only one witness: Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
The plan would be risky, the sources said, because Starr would be 
opened to questions about his own methods and his management of the 
investigation. On the other hand, Starr is regarded as the person 
who could best lay out the case for impeachment. The sources said 
Republican leaders would like to bring Starr to the stand by November 
19th and hope to vote on the articles of impeachment in the Judiciary 
Committee by Thanksgiving.
