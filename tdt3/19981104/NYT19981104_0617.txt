Proclaiming that ``the politicking is over and the business of government 
is at hand,'' Peter Vallone returned to his job as speaker of the 
city council Wednesday and met with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the 
first time since the two broke off budget negotiations last spring. 
Vallone, a Democrat who lost the gubernatorial race to Gov. George 
Pataki on Tuesday, said that he and Giuliani had spent an hour discussing 
the budget and other issues that they had clashed over this year. 
Although he did not divulge details, Vallone said he was optimistic 
about reaching a budget compromise, four months into the fiscal year. 
``It's the first real constructive dialogue we've had in terms of 
resolving some problems,'' Vallone said after his meeting with Giuliani, 
which took place at City Hall. ``We've always been friendly, but we 
haven't had this kind of a sit-down to talk about positive ways of 
getting out of our difficulties without going to court.'' At issue 
is $150 million for spending that the city council approved as part 
of the $34 billion city budget, but that the Giuliani administration 
has refused to release. Since last spring, Vallone had accused the 
mayor of withholding the money because the speaker opposed his plan 
to use tax dollars to build a new Yankee Stadium in Manhattan. Giuliani 
countered that the $150 million was nothing but pork-barrel spending 
meant to improve Vallone's chances in the race for governor. Much 
of the $150 million would go to nonprofit groups and pay for social 
programs, including foster-care programs, expanded day care and other 
child-care programs; meals delivered at home and other programs for 
the elderly, and alternatives to jail. Some of the money would also 
be used for weekly recycling pickups by the city. Both sides have 
warned that the dispute might end up in court, but Wednesday, Vallone 
said both sides were now determined to prevent that scenario. Instead, 
he said, his aides and aides to the mayor will fashion a compromise. 
Vallone said he would meet with Giuliani at least once a week from 
now on. Weekly meetings between the two had stopped when the budget 
battle began in June. ``That's all going to work,'' Vallone said when 
asked whether he thought the $150 million would be released. ``As 
long as there is a willingness on both sides to work these problems 
out, no matter how difficult they are, there are ways of doing it.'' 
Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Giuliani, said only, ``We have every 
confidence that the budget process will move forward.'' The speaker 
said that he and the mayor did not discuss another contentious topic: 
the future of Yankee Stadium. Asked why not, Vallone said, ``We didn't 
have to.'' He said that after his campaign, he was more optimistic 
than ever that the Yankees would stay put in their current home in 
the Bronx. During the race, Vallone had unsuccessfully called for 
a referendum on whether to spend tax dollars on a new stadium in Manhattan. 
``What the referendum accomplished, I believe, was ending any real 
negotiations or contract-signing to move them out of the Bronx,'' 
he said. But the stadium issue will clearly remain a sticking point. 
Ms. Roche said that Vallone never had _ and never would have _ any 
control over the future of Yankee Stadium. ``That is not his decision,'' 
she said. ``It is not the mayor's decision. It is the decision of 
the owner of the Yankees. It sounds like he is having a hard time 
getting out of campaign mode.'' Vallone, who conceded to Pataki shortly 
after the polls closed at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, was back in his council 
office by 9 a.m. Wednesday. Sitting at his desk, he appeared tired 
but at peace. Vallone said that he was still in pain from injuries 
he received in a car accident while campaigning in Queens on Friday, 
but that he was not planning a vacation. Because of term limits, Vallone 
cannot stay in the council past 2001. Asked about his political future 
_ in the past, he has mentioned running for mayor _ he allowed a weary 
smile, then shook his head. ``I'm not going to discuss it because 
I don't want to be rear-ended again,'' he said, both referring to 
the accident and hinting at the frustration he felt throughout his 
campaign. ``We'll concern ourselves with that in the next millennium. 
Which is not that far away.''
