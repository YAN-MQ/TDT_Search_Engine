BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The United Nations' special representative 
to Bosnia said Wednesday that peacekeeping work in the country was 
far from done and she'd like NATO to keep its troops there for some 
time to come. ''Our cooperation with NATO is very good,'' Elisabeth 
Rehn told reporters after briefing the North Atlantic Council, NATO's 
top policymaking body. ''The only thing I was asking them is they 
should not disappear for some while.'' NATO maintains about 30,000 
troops in Bosnia as its Stabilization Force, or SFOR, about half the 
number that originally entered the country in December 1995 to support 
the Dayton peace agreement. Carlos Westendorp, the high representative 
in Bosnia overseeing the civilian aspects of the Dayton agreement, 
has talked about needing NATO presence for two more years, said Mrs. 
Rehn. ''I'm not sure that's enough,'' she said. ''SFOR should stay 
for some years - two, three, four, whatever.''
