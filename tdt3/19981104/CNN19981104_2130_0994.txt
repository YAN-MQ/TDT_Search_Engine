All big three automakers posted stronger-than-expected gains last 
month, as sales of cars and light trucks went up 10%. General Motors 
is offsetting last summer's strikes by offering generous rebates and 
low financing rates to entice consumers. Ford says the results are 
so positive, it's increasing fourth quarter production by 25,000 vehicles. 
As for Chrysler, it's reporting a 20% increase in sales.
