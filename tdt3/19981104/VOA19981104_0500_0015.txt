The party holding the White House almost always loses congressional 
seats in these elections. Instead, Democrats have held their own in 
the Senate and are apparently on pace to gain a few seats in the House 
of Representatives. The results confounded Republicans, who hoped 
to exploit the President's affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky. 
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle says, this takes the steam out 
of the drive for congressional impeachment of the President. Obviously, 
no one really knows yet. This is going to be a decision that House 
members are going to have to make. But they can't feel very good about 
prolonging this, given the results tonight. Many Americans say, the 
White House scandal was not a factor in their vote. Democrats also 
picked up a few governors' seats, including the one in California, 
which was among the biggest prizes in Tuesday's balloting. David Swan,
