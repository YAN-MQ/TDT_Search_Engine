Tonight "the fleecing of America." At a time when a telephone of some 
kind seems to be a permanent attachment to the hands of every American. 
You may be surprised that your tax collector thinks it's a lexry. 
Here's Fred Francis. Whenever you pick that up, it costs you in a 
way you'd never guess. You think the phone's a necessity. The government 
says it's a sin -- which is really an excuse to hit you with an extra 
tax, a so-called "sin" tax. They are aimed at luxury items -- gas-guzzling 
cars, some firearms, booze, playing the lottery. But talking on the 
telephone, a luxury? It's flip-flopped over the years. It's gone from 
a tax on the rich to a tax that is on everybody. And we've been paying 
for it for most of the past 100 years. Its right here on your phone 
Bill, called "federal excise tax." You could call it the Spanish-American 
war tax. The tax began in 1898, to finance the war effort with Spain. 
There were only 3 million phones then. They were expensive, a luxury. 
It was supposed to be temporary. But today, it's permanent, 3% of 
every Bill. Doesn't sound like a lot? It cost taxpayers $5 billion 
last year alone. It's about time the Congress did look at programs 
that are obsolete now, as far as their original purpose. Ruth nadel 
is active in politics, watches her taxes closely. But only recently 
did she learn she pays a special tax whenever she calls one of her 
sons. This federal tax was put into effect 1898. Maybe we should have 
a celebration, the 100th anniversary for the federal tax on telephones. 
And the anniversary should have as its outcome, let's eliminate that 
tax. But Congress is not likely to eliminate that tax. So remember, 
even time you hear that Ringing, some say it's another "Fleecing of 
America." Fred Francis, NBC news, Washington.
