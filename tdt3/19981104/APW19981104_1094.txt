Nikola Poplasen, the new ultranationalist president of the Bosnian 
Serb substate, was sworn in Wednesday, while moderate Serbs took key 
assembly posts. Poplasen, a former paramilitary leader of the Serb 
Radical Party, was officially installed at a session of the new parliament, 
nearly two months after his election victory over moderate Biljana 
Plavsic. While a hard-liner, he promised to honor the Dayton peace 
agreement. ``Maintaining peace and the provisions of the Dayton peace 
agreement are the necessary framework for the values we have all agreed 
upon,'' Poplasen said after the inauguration. He also promised continued 
economic recovery through privatization and by attracting foreign 
investments. ``Donor help and loans to Republika Srpska are of utmost 
importance in boosting our economy,'' Poplasen said, referring to 
the Bosnian Serb republic. ``Our lasting orientation is certainly 
toward reaching agreements with foreign companies and developing democracy.'' 
Poplasen's Radical Party is allied with the Serb Democratic Party, 
the supporters of war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic. In the September 
elections, also held for the 83-seat parliament, 32 seats were won 
by the Radicals and other hard-liners and the same number went to 
a coalition of moderates. The rest are held by representatives of 
Croats and Muslims. The resulting impasse between the two Serb camps 
in parliament had delayed the vote on anew assembly leadership - the 
speaker, two deputies and assembly secretary - which is required before 
the president-elect can take office. Muslim and Croat deputies in 
the assembly eventually ended the Serb-Serb bickering by endorsing 
the moderates, which led to the appointment of Petar Djokic as the 
speaker, a moderate deputy and a secretary. Poplasen's next step is 
to name a premier, a post so far held by Milorad Dodik, who won praise 
from international officials for implementing the 1995 Dayton peace 
agreement. Western officials have insisted that Dodik remain in the 
post. But the hardliners have accused Dodik of betraying Serb interests 
in Bosnia.
