New York senator-elect Charles Schumer is thanking the White House 
for helping to get him to Capitol Hill. The race with republican Alfonse 
D'Amato had been close, but the decisive victory was a surprise. Gary 
Tuchman reports. You're searchly the best For the first time in 52 
years, the state of New York will have two democratic U.S. senators. 
Charles Schumer will join 22-year veteran Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
I want to thank you New York. You have honored me with your trust. 
Schumer defeated a man who both parties agreed could never be counted 
out, but three-term incumbent Alfonse D'Amato couldn't pull it off 
this time. It certainly wasn't his day. He got stuck in an elevator 
for 20 minutes before his concession speech. I am deeply grateful 
to each and every New Yorker who has given me the opportunity to do 
that which I have loved the most -- to work and to fight and to attempt 
to make a difference for the people of our great state. The victory 
was considered a high priority for the White House. President Clinton, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and vice President Gore paid several visits 
to New York state to help the candidate. To the first lady, and to 
the president and to the vice president -- The applause continued 
for about 30 seconds. I can't thank each of you enough for your frequent 
and electrifying visits to New York. Both candidates called each other 
names during this campaign. But for Charles Schumer, it's easy to 
take his mind off what he was called, because he's now called senator-elect.
