It took Luke less time to become a Jedi than it took director George 
Lucas to grasp the impact Star Wars had on moviegoers. ``When you're 
in the center of something like this you don't see it very much,'' 
Lucas said Wednesday, 21 years after his blockbuster trilogy began. 
``I'm beginning to see it, through my 5-year-old son. He's a Star 
Wars fanatic now and wants me to buy all the toys. I'm beginning to 
see what most people have been going through.'' The filmmaker's company, 
Lucasfilm Ltd., and Fox Studios Australia announced Wednesday that 
the next two films in a three-part prequel to the Star Wars trilogy 
of the 1970s and 1980s will be made in Australia. Plot details remain 
largely under wraps, but Lucas said the new films will include the 
tale of how Anakin Skywalker, father of Luke and Princess Leia became 
Darth Vader, the villain behind a black mask. Filming for the first 
movie in the new series, ``Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace,'' 
was completed in Britain last year and is due for release in the United 
States in May 1999. The film stars British actors Liam Neeson as as 
a Jedi master and Ewan McGregor as a young Ben Kenobi. ``One of the 
biggest problems I've had in the past is that most of the characters 
had to be made out of latex,'' Lucas said. ``It is very hard to direct 
around a large rubber thing that can't move very well.'' After experiments 
with digital technology with the slug-like character Jabba the Hutt 
for a reissued special edition of the original movies, Lucas said 
the new films will have more digital characters. ``I've got digital 
characters which can actually walk and talk with live action characters 
and do a performance.'' The new films largely will be shot on a soundstage 
in Fox's complex in Sydney, with post-production at Lucas' headquarters 
in San Francisco. ``Episode II,'' was expected to begin shooting in 
April 2000, and ``Episode III'' in 2003, said Kim Williams, chief 
executive of Fox Studios Australia.
