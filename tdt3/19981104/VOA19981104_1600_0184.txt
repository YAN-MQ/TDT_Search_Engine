Colombian troops have reestablished control over a provincial capitol 
seized by leftist rebels three days ago, ending some of the heaviest 
fighting in the long civil war. At least 150 soldiers, police, and 
civilians were killed in the battle for Metu in southeastern Valupis 
department. The rebels also suffered casualties. They took about 45 
police prisoner.
