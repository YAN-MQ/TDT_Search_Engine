There was an impossibly gaudy crystal chandelier above him, a who's 
who of prominent New York Democrats around him and hundreds of wildly 
clapping, hoarsely cheering supporters at his feet. But nothing captured 
the significance or heady thrill of the moment for Rep. Charles Schumer 
_ soon to be Sen. Charles Schumer _ as much as his smile. It seemed 
too broad to be contained by his face. Surveying a jammed ballroom 
at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan that just so happened to be the 
place where his Republican rival in the Senate race, Alfonse D'Amato, 
formally announced his bid for re-election earlier this year, Schumer 
bounced up and down, swayed back and forth and leaned down to plant 
a kiss on the forehead of his wife, Iris Weinshall Schumer. Then he 
made a vow, saying he would show his gratitude for being given this 
joy and this opportunity by working to deserve a place among a pantheon 
of Democratic senators from New York that included Robert Kennedy, 
Jacob Javits and Daniel Patrick Moynihan. ``I will do my best to be 
a senator worthy of New York,'' Schumer promised, ``and worthy of 
them.'' Schumer's poignant, roughly 15-minute speech _ which began 
just a few minutes after 11 p.m., in time to be carried live by local 
television newscasts _ capped and consummated a victory party as euphoric 
as they come. Inside the ballroom, at least 300 campaign workers, 
supporters and Democratic loyalists hugged tightly and gave each other 
high-fives. Many hundreds more, unable to fit into the ballroom, filled 
the entire lobby of the Waldorf. The remarkable size of the turnout 
and the expansive spirits of those who came underscored how long and 
how much Democrats had wanted to oust D'Amato, whose wily political 
survival over three terms in the Senate had frustrated them to no 
end. ``It's one thing to see Schumer in,'' Steve Ludsin, 50, a lawyer 
from East Hampton, said. ``But it's great to see D'Amato gone.'' Although 
this was technically Schumer's night, there were any number of other 
agendas at play inside the ballroom. Representatives of interest groups 
serving gays and lesbians, the environment and organized labor roamed 
the ballroom, ferreting out reporters and explaining why the constituents 
their organizations represented, and the issues their organizations 
pushed, turned the election in Schumer's favor. Judith Hope, chairwoman 
of the New York State Democratic Committee, discoursed on the party's 
efforts to get out the vote and how pivotal that drive had been. And 
Democratic politicians like New York City Public Advocate Mark Green, 
who opposed Schumer in the Democratic primary in September, and New 
York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who is expected to run for mayor 
in 2001, made bee lines for the thicket of television cameras at one 
end of the room and basked in the reflected glow of Schumer's accomplishment. 
They portrayed the significance and explanation of that accomplishment 
in terms that went far beyond Schumer himself. ``This is probably 
the biggest win for Democrats in years, if not decades, in this state,'' 
Green said. Hevesi expressed similar sentiments, then suddenly caught 
himself, remembering that it was still before 10 p.m. and that neither 
D'Amato nor Schumer had publicly acknowledged a definitive outcome. 
``If D'Amato ends up winning tonight,'' he told several reporters 
who were furiously scribbling notes, ``would you rip out those pages 
and burn everything I said?''
