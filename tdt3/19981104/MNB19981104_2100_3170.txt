Word today there might be an investigation, a break in the investigation 
of the recent murder of the physician who performed abortions in upstate 
New York. Federal agents say they are now looking for the man they 
think could have information, as they put it, about the crime. We 
get our report from NBC news justice correspondent Pete Williams. 
Federal investigators say they've been looking for a man who may have 
been around the Buffalo, New York home of Dr. slepian before last 
month's shooting. They're not calling him a suspect, but they want 
to question 44-year-old james Charles kopp of Vermont this they say 
his black Chevy cavalier was seen around Dr. slepian's house, have 
the license bpe 216. Authorities have been to kopp last address in 
ureal have the V., a 9 hour drive away from slepians address but no 
sign of him. So today federal agents got a warrant allowing them to 
arrest kopp as a Material wits. Investigators say they're acting with 
urgency because slepian's shooting by a sniper hiding in the Woods 
outside his home appears to fit a four-year pattern of attacks of 
doctors in Canada and U.S. while kopp is officially only a witness, 
authorities say he has a history of arrests for illegal abortion protests. 
NBC news learned his arrests began in Atlanta and Houston and Burlington, 
vermont in 1990. And in 1991, in Levittown, New York for protesting 
abortion by trying to block a clinic interest. Prolife groups say 
he has a long history of protests. He has a very consistent low profile 
activity level that's been going on for looks like about a decade 
we've been able to trace. Officials insist there isn't much more behind 
their search for kopp other than his car and his background, but they 
want to find him quickly in case he holds the key to this investigation.
