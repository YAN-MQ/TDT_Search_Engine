Last spring, Samuel Levin, a 39-year-old money manager and investor, 
was looking for just the right million-dollar co-op apartment in one 
of the doorman-bedecked buildings lining lower Fifth Avenue or facing 
Gramercy Park. At the same time, Karl Steinbrenner, a 66-year-old 
corporate communications writer (and no relation to George), was trying 
to find a $350,000 two-bedroom apartment in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood 
of Brooklyn for himself, his companion and her 20-year-old son. Also 
scuffing their shoes in search of the ideal apartment were Rob Cronin 
and Audrey Mann Cronin, newly married public-relations executives 
in their 30s, searching for a two-bedroom condominium below 34th Street. 
All were horrified at the high prices, and after the stock market's 
512-point plunge at the end of August, all decided to back off _ to 
``keep our hands in our pockets,'' as Steinbrenner said. Guess what? 
Within the last two weeks, they have come back. ``When the stock market 
started to go wonky, we said: `Whoa! Wait a minute! This may not be 
the right time,''' Steinbrenner said. Now the couple are back in the 
market again, although they are bidding lower than they would have 
a few months ago. They are not alone. Although there are no statistics 
available for market changes as recent as the last few weeks, real 
estate brokers and agents are full of anecdotes about the Born-Again 
Buyer, those cautious souls who were scared off by the stormy market 
but have returned to the want ads and the open houses. ``They're tiptoeing 
back in with a lot of caution,'' said Barbara Corcoran, the chairwoman 
of Corcoran Group. ``We haven't seen a rise in accepted offers yet, 
but attendance at open houses is way up.'' Other brokers testified 
that Born-Again Buyers are returning in droves. Betsy Dean, the managing 
director at Stribling Associates, said, ``In the last two weeks it's 
been very active.'' In Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope and Cobble Hill, 
``things have sure picked up during the last two weeks of October,'' 
said Christopher Thomas, the head of William B. May's Brooklyn offices. 
Frederick Peters of Ashforth Warburg Associates agreed. ``We had probably 
a month in which everything seemed frozen,'' he said. ``But now the 
buyers are coming out of the woodwork, people we haven't heard from 
in a year.'' Take Dr. Jim Gibboney, a 36-year-old physician from San 
Francisco. He and Paul Blanchard, a marketing researcher, were planning 
to move to New York but were scared back to California by what Gibboney 
called the volatile real-estate market. ``We left it at that,'' he 
said. But this week, they will dive back into the fray. ``Prices have 
come down,'' he said, ``and we'll try it again.'' But the would-be 
buyers interviewed this week are still wary. ``Next week, we'll probably 
put in a bid on something we saw, but I'm going to bid very low,'' 
Steinbrenner said. ``Maybe they'll counter, and we'll meet in the 
middle.'' Rob and Audrey Mann Cronin signed a contract on Oct. 28. 
``We were delighted _ it was obvious to us that the stock market's 
taking a downturn was good for us,'' Cronin said. The Cronins had 
spent July and August _ ``every day, every night, every Sunday, out 
inspecting,'' Ms. Cronin said. They now plan to have three children 
in five years, ``God willing,'' he said, with a laugh. They said they 
make ``very good incomes'' but could not afford the whopping 50 percent 
down payments required by co-op boards in the best buildings. They 
considered moving to the suburbs and decided they would stay in Manhattan 
and wait ``until things cooled off,'' Cronin said. So they waited, 
playing a Sunday morning real-estate game. ``Audrey would read the 
real-estate classifieds to me _ you know, the descriptions,'' he said. 
``And after a while, I'd be able to guess the prices to within $5,000 
and $10,000.'' Then came the plunge. And within the last few weeks, 
he said, they have been noticing that prices, especially those for 
the newish condominium towers, which are easier to calculate since 
the prices are based primarily on square footage _ have come down 
a peg. At the beginning of October, they firmed up their wish list: 
They wanted to be downtown, in Chelsea, Greenwich Village or TriBeCa. 
They found exactly what they wanted: a new two-bedroom, two-and-a-half 
bath condominium in Chelsea. The apartment, which has three terraces, 
had a price that was already reduced $30,000 after the stock market 
began its most recent gyrations, and the couple said they paid $30,000 
less than that. Because the sale is not final, they did not want to 
reveal the price. ``We never could've gotten it without that 512-point 
drop,'' Cronin said. ``We were waiting. Maybe we were a little bit 
smart and a lot lucky.''
