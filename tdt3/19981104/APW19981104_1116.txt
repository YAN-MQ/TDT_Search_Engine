More than 10,000 furious fans Wednesday waved giant banners, stomped 
to trumpets and even roared threats against Premier Costas Simitis 
_ all because of a goal disallowed during a Greek first-division match 
last weekend. Supporters of Salonica's PAOK gathered on the streets 
of this northern port city to protest the match that was abandoned 
Saturday against Olympiakos Pireaus. The match was halted with Olympiakos 
leading 2-1 after PAOK fans invaded the field and clashed with police 
following referee Yiannis Papapetrouan's decision to annul a goal 
by PAOK with eight minutes remaining. A linesman was hit in the head 
and hospitalized with a concussion. Three police officers and eight 
fans also were injured. Sixteen fans were convicted and sentenced 
to suspended prison terms ranging from eight to 26 months. Wednesday's 
rowdy but peaceful rally was joined by people from across northern 
Greece. The demonstrators chanted slogans against the Greek federation 
and threatened never to vote for Premier Costas Simitis. PAOK is demanding 
a rematch and the suspension of Papapetrou. It also wants an investigation 
into allesged ``soccer corruption.''
