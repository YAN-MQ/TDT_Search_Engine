After one of the closest and most bitterly fought Senate races in 
the country, Rep. Scotty Baesler, the Democrat, all but conceded defeat 
Wednesday to his Republican rival, Rep. Jim Bunning. Aides to Baesler 
said that while he had not formally conceded the race, he had withdrawn 
his earlier demand for a recount and had called Bunning late Wednesday 
morning to congratulate the Republican on his apparent victory. With 
99 percent of the precincts reporting, Bunning had received 567,951 
votes, or 50 percent, while Baesler had 560,888 votes, or 49 percent. 
Bunning, a staunch conservative who had a 17-year career in major 
league baseball before his election to the House in 1986, will take 
the seat being vacated by the state's Democratic senator, Wendell 
Ford, who is retiring from the Senate after 24 years. Bunning's victory 
means that Kentucky will have two Republican senators for the first 
time in a quarter century. ``This is better any time than getting 
into the Hall of Fame,'' Bunning said in claiming victory. Aides to 
Baesler, a centrist Democrat who first came to prominence in the state 
as captain of the University of Kentucky basketball team, said that 
a formal concession may not come until after state election officials 
conduct a review of statewide ballot procedures _ a so-called recanvassing, 
a far less onerous procedure than a recount. The recanvassing is expected 
to take about 10 days. But Baesler's press spokesman, Mark Riddle, 
said the congressman was largely resigned to defeat. ``We don't expect 
the recanvassing to pull this out for us, to produce some kind of 
miracle,'' Riddle said. ``This was a tough, hard-fought Kentucky political 
race, and we're proud of what we accomplished.'' Tough is an understatement 
for this Senate race, which saw Bunning run television advertisements 
that featured snippets of a campaign speech by Baesler last summer 
in which he gestured dramatically, to the accompaniment of Richard 
Wagner's ``Ride of the Valkyries.'' Democrats, noting that Wagner 
was Adolf Hitler's favorite composer, said the advertisements were 
a crude attempt to portray Baesler as a fascist. Bunning sought to 
define himself as a moderate and a defender of Social Security, repeatedly 
reminding voters that he is the chairman of the House Subcommittee 
on Social Security. Baesler accused him of lying about his record, 
noting that he had often voted in the House against programs to help 
the elderly and retired. Bunning's triumph was also a victory for 
Sen. Mitch McConnell, the state's other senator, chairman of the Senate 
Republican campaign committee and a key opponent of campaign financing 
reform. McConnell, a key strategist for Bunning, directed large contributions 
to his campaign. He did not want a loss in his own back yard and was 
especially eager to see the defeat of Baesler, long a champion of 
campaign reform.
