When we come back, service and profit, understanding the connection. 
A ouncing an amazing discovery. Now one-A-day has combined herbs with 
vitamins. Like our cold season formula with echinacea, vitamin C and 
zinc. There's one for memory, even cholesterol health. Do rich people 
have more friends than the rest of us? Are they M Ore deserving of 
a comfortable seat? Are they more entitled to brake safely on a rainy 
day? Are we the only car company that doesn't think so? Century by 
Buick. Full of amenities for under 20,000. Loaded for under 24. Heaing 
up the research team, I do three or four dives a day. Long hours, 
bag lunches. But I can't afford to get slowed down by irregularity. 
My doctor recommended metamucil. It's not a chemically altered fiber, 
not an artificial stimulant. The only leading brand with 100 percent 
natural fiber... is metamucil. Keeps me regular... gently, so the 
only thing dragging is the anchor.
