Vietnam is crediting a 4-year-old program to encourage use of iodized 
salt for a drop in the incidence of goiter, a government official 
said Wednesday. Nguyen Tien Dinh, chairman of the National Anti-Goiter 
Program, said the goiter rate has fallen from 22.2 percent in 1993 
to 14.9 percent now. In addition, the number of children ages 8 to 
12 with no access to iodized salt has fallen to 30 percent from 94 
percent five years ago. The figures were based on a four-month survey 
that concluded in September, Dinh said. Dinh said the government's 
target is to reduce the goiter rate to under 5 percent by the year 
2005.
