New York will now have two democratic senators. Charles Schumer beat 
incumbent republican, Alfonse D'Amato, in what many call the nastiest 
race of the election. D'Amato was seeking a fourth Senate term, but 
Schumer defeated him decisively. Nar D'Amato graciously called me 
a fi minutes ago to congratulate me on being the next senator from 
New York. I did call congressman Schumer to congratulate him for a 
hard fought, wonderful victory. No, no, he is our senator and we want 
him to be as effective as he can for all the people of this great 
state. Remember that. That's the key. Doing the business of the people.
