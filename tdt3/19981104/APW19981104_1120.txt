Suspected ethnic Albanian separatists opened fire on two vehicles 
carrying mine workers, raising tensions Wednesday and providing a 
stark reminder of the violence that persists in Kosovo despite a cease-fire 
agreement. People on both sides of Kosovo's conflict said Wednesday 
that tension remains high in this area because of incident like the 
roadside ambush that injured three Serbs at the Belacevac coal mine, 
10 kilometers (six miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina. Heavy 
fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas has stopped 
throughout the province and many refugees are coming back from the 
woods, but the majority Albanian province has a long way to go before 
real peace is established. The three workers, two of them seriously 
injured, were transported to a Pristina hospital, and the attack sparked 
an hour-long shootout between police and the attackers, Serb police 
said. But villagers in nearby Sipitula said they knew nothing about 
an ambush and only heard Serb police firing in their direction, causing 
them to flee for nearby fields or homes of friends and relatives. 
Two bullet-riddled, bloodstained vehicles were still sitting near 
the road Wednesday, a pool of blood beside one open door. Dozens of 
spent shell casings littered the roadside from where the attack took 
place. ``The mine is not working today because the people are afraid 
to go to work,'' said mine security guard Blagoje Ristic. He said 
the Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas have ambushed vehicles along 
the same stretch of road twice previously, and that KLA snipers hide 
in abandoned houses in the area. In Brussels, Nato Secretary General 
Javier Solana said the alliance's Kosovo extraction force for emergency 
evacuation of civilian monitors will be ready to go by the end of 
November. The extraction force of allied soldiers will be responsible 
for the emergency rescue of civilian ``ground verifiers'' now being 
dispatched to Kosovo should they run into unexpected physical danger. 
``I expect to have it ready around the end of the month,'' Solana 
told reporters. ``Everything is in place now for finalizing the plan.''
