Hurricane Mitch has caused innumerable losses throughout central America. 
Katherine Barrett looks at the potential financial losses for two 
U.S. companies. The torrential rains that have taken thousands of 
lives in central America have also drowned thousands of acres of banana 
plantations. Chiquita brands estimates the industry's entire production 
has been wiped out in Honduras. It has lost 17,000 acres there, close 
to 10% of the bananas it markets worldwide. In a normal week, Chiquita 
ships 48 million pounds of bananas from central america to U.S. ports. 
Now, the company is shipping out boat loads of blankets, canned food, 
water and other relief supplies. We actually airlifted on a cargo 
plane that we charted inflatable boats with motors that have already 
been involved in rescue efforts and have actually already saved lives. 
We've sent necessary medical supplies. We're still accumulating more 
products for further airlift and sealift. Dole foods says 40,000 acres 
of its banana crops -- a quarter of its worldwide production -- have 
been damaged in Honduras, Guatemala and nicaragua. And the longer 
the plants remain under water, the worse the damage. Dole estimates 
it will take 12 to 18 months to restore production. The company may 
have to rebuild roads, bridges and railways. But in the occasionally 
twisted logic of Wall Street, the crop damage could actually help 
profits. Just two weeks ago, Dole warned of a drop in earnings because 
of a severe oversupply of bananas. We think there's a good chance 
it will result in firmer banana prices going into 1999. Pricing has 
been extraordinarily soft this year, and we've already seen very substantial 
uptake. Substantial indeed. In the past week, the wholesale price 
of bananas has more than doubled, proof positive the laws of supply 
and demand remain firm, even in the face of natural disaster and human 
tragedy. Katherine Barrett, "CNN Financial News," New York.
