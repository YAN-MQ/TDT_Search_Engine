Switzerland's Swatch Group said Wednesday it has sold its stake in 
the Smart Car project to German car giant Daimler-Benz, its partner 
in the venture. The tiny two-seater Smart Car was developed by Micro 
Compact Car AG, a joint venture between Daimler-Benz and Swatch Group, 
the Swiss manufacturer of the Swatch wristwatch. Swatch's decision 
to sell its 19 percent stake in the venture gives Daimler full control 
of Micro Compact Car. Neither Daimler nor Swatch provided terms of 
the transaction. A German newspaper, Wirtschaftswoche, put the value 
at 117 million marks (dlrs 70 million). Swatch said it decided to 
sell its stake because MCC decided against using Swatch's hybrid motor 
technology. MCC will pay unspecified compensation to Swatch, which 
may later license its technology to the merged Daimler and Chrysler 
group. The car went on sale across Europe last month following a six-month 
delay after it flunked the so-called ``moose test,'' mimicking a driver 
swerving to avoid an unexpected obstacle. It is on sale in Germany, 
Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland, Austrian, Belgium, the Netherlands 
and Luxembourg in special ``Smart Centers,'' which bypass normal auto 
dealers. The 2.5-meter (yard) long Smart Car takes up around half 
of a standard parking spot. With its bright yellow and red colors, 
mix-and-match replaceable parts and all-plastic body, it is aimed 
at a young market.
