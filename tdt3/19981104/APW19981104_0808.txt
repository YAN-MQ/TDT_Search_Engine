For the second time in two days, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
on Wednesday postponed a Cabinet meeting that was to ratify the land-for-security 
agreement with the Palestinians. Netanyahu aides said the ministers 
would not be convened until Israel receives written guarantees from 
the United States that 30 Palestinians wanted by Israel will be arrested. 
The new delay makes it increasingly unlikely that Israel and the Palestinians 
will stick to the 12-week time table that was to go begin Monday. 
As part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13 percent of the 
West Bank _ with the first pullback installment due Nov. 16 _ in exchange 
for Palestinian security steps. The Palestinians reacted angrily, 
saying Netanyahu was seizing a pretext to try and dismantle the peace 
agreement. ``He (Netanyahu) is inventing new agreements. He does not 
want to honor anything,'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat sad. 
However, despite the recriminations, there were first signs that the 
dispute could be resolved. U.S. officials said they were mediating 
and that they expected results ``shortly.'' Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat, who is visiting Spain, said that 12 of the wanted Palestinians 
are in detention and that he would do his best to apprehend the others. 
``We will continue working on this 100 percent ... but nobody can 
ask us to achieve 100 percent results,'' Arafat told a news conference 
in Madrid. Palestinian security officials have said that several of 
the men on Israel's wanted list were arrested and tried in recent 
years and months, but never gave a specific number. In a press statement 
released by his office, Netanyahu cautiously welcomed Arafat's comments. 
``This is exactly what we demand: strict fulfillment of each and very 
letter of the agreement by both sides, Palestinian and Israeli alike,'' 
the statement said. David Bar-Illan, 9th graf pvs
