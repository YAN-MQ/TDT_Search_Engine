Democrats gained seats in the House of Representatives and scored 
major upsets in the US Senate. Midterm election results, President 
Clinton says, are a vindication for his party. Mr. Clinton says voters 
sent a clear message in Tuesday's election for progress over partisanship. 
The American people want their business, their concerns, their children, 
their families, their future addressed here. That's what the message 
of the election was. Mr. Clinton says the impeachment inquiry of him, 
for the Monica Lewinsky scandal, remains in the hands of Congress 
and the people.
