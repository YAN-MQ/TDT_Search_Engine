The government on Wednesday sent a tanker full of fuel to help relieve 
an energy shortage on the eastern peninsula of Kamchatka, where residents 
have been receiving power for only a few hours a day. ``Kamchatka 
will not freeze this winter,'' Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak 
told the ITAR-Tass news agency. A tanker was dispatched from the eastern 
city of Nakhodka on Wednesday and was expected in Kamchatka in two 
or three days, he said. The region's existing fuel supplies were expected 
to last only about 10 more days in peninsula's main city, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. 
Residents have been receiving electricity for about three to four 
hours a day, the Interfax news agency said. A special commission from 
the Ministry of Emergency Situations arrived on Wednesday and was 
seeking to stabilize the situation before the winter hits with full 
force, the report said. Snow already has begun to fall and the temperature 
is hovering around freezing. The impoverished region has had trouble 
purchasing adequate fuel supplies for years, and conditions have been 
made worse by Russia's latest economic crisis.
