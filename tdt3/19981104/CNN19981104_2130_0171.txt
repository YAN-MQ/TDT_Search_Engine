For more on the midterm elections we're joined by Douglas hodgkin, 
a Professor of political science at Bates college. He joins us by 
telephone. Professor hodgkin, thanks for joining us. Good evening. 
First of all, how do you think the election results affect the balance 
of power right now in Congress? Well, the election results were largely 
a wash. You get a few seats changing hand. But in terms of the net 
gain or loss, the Senate is still the same balance, and the house 
is only a very marginal shift. As far as real power, however do you 
think we will see any increase? Real power increase in power for whom? 
Well, that would be the democrats right now. Oh, for the democrats. 
Well, they have a psychological momentum. Which is probably a lot 
more important than the actual numbers of four or five seats. So the 
psychological momentum would place them in a stronger position than 
they were. Okay. What effect do you think this is going to have on 
the year 2000 campaign? Will it aid them then or do you think by then 
we will have forgotten about it? Well, the 2000 election is a long 
way off. Two years is a long time in politics. We will largely have 
forgotten a lot about the 1998 campaign. So for the Congress, I think 
he'll continue to have the contests and the individual states and 
districts. Given the psychological advantage, do you think we will 
see Newt Gingrich actually move down from his top seat? Well, there's 
always that possibility. The republicans have in the past removed 
leadership when they will been disappointed with the outcomes of elections. 
One instance was when Gerald Ford took over the leadership of the 
house and then that prepared for his way to go to the vice presidency 
and the presidency. But there is a lot of grumbling going on currently. 
However, what the republicans will need is a strong alternative. You 
can't beat somebody with nobody. And they need someone who is able 
to appeal to both the social conservatives and economic conservatives 
in the party. And it isn't clear who that person would be, at least 
at this point. Okay. Thank you for that insight. That was Douglas 
hodgkin's. Is he a professor of political science.
