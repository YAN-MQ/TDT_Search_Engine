You may not see the resemblance, but some genealogists say prince 
Charles is a distant relative of the real count dracula. Charles visited 
the region in Romania known as transylvania today. That's the birthplace 
of the dracula legend, which is based on the medieval prince, vlad 
the impaler. A historian says vlad had a brother whose descendants 
married into the british royal family, thus the connection to Charles.
