At the White House, officials are jubilant over the Democrats gain 
in Congress, which they say are likely to undercut Republican moves 
for President Clinton's impeachment. Correspondent David Gulles reports 
from the white house. The White House had been saying the election 
would not be a referendum on Mr. Clinton or his behavior in the Monica 
Lewinsky affair. But officials here are nonetheless delighted over 
the surprise gains for the Democrats. Questioned by reporters, Mr. 
Clinton declined to say what the outcome might mean to the impeachment 
effort. But he said it clearly shows the voters want Washington to 
focus on issues such as education, health care, and reform of the 
social security pension system. It is a vindication of the policies 
and of the general policy of putting partisanship behind progress, 
and of putting people before politics. And of trying to find ways 
of bringing people together, instead of to divide them. Mr. Clinton 
said the outcome was astonishing because it ran against the tradition 
of the president's party losing seats at mid-term elections, and because 
Democrats were badly outspent by Republicans in the campaign. David 
Gulles, VOA News, the White House.
