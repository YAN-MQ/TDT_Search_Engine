France's Foreign Minister on Wednesday welcomed the outcome of the 
U.S. elections, saying it was ``a good thing for democracy'' that 
the Democrats did not suffer a backlash from the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
Hubert Vedrine, in an interview with radio station RTL, said President 
Bill Clinton's party had performed well ``despite the pressures on 
him, despite the attacks which really resembled McCarthyism.'' ``Generally, 
it's a good thing for democracy that this type of attack doesn't weigh 
on the voters' choices.'' Jack Lang, head of the National Assembly's 
foreign affairs committee, said the result was ``a victory for democracy 
and good judgment.'' Lang, a former culture minister, congratulated 
Clinton in a press release, saying he was pleased ``that the American 
people stood up against the heinous campaign that has been orchestrated 
against you by ultraconservatives for too long.'' Republicans retained 
control of the U.S. House for another two years but failed to obtain 
the sizable increases the party's leaders had sought to reinforce 
their agenda to impeach Clinton. Vedrine said stability was positive 
in terms of foreign policy. ``We know well the foreign policy of Clinton 
and (U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine) Albright,'' Vedrine said. 
``So we know where we stand.''
