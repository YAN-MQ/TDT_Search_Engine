Actress Sophia Loren is taking walks and trying hard to avoid stress. 
Sounds like a good idea, for all of us, Aaron. She is dealing with 
a heart condition that was diagnosed in recent months. In August, 
the Italian-born Loren became ill on a flight from Geneva, Switzerland 
to New York City. Doctors found that the 64 year-old star had an irregular 
heart beat. Well, now she's back home in Geneva, and has been spotted 
taking a walk in a botanical garden. Loren told a Rome, Italy newspaper 
that her doctor had ordered her to take brisk walks. She also said 
she plans to do everything to avoid forms of stress. For her, this 
means working less and taking airplanes less. Very good advice for 
everyone.
