As the English author George Moore once wrote, ``A man travels the 
world over in search of what he needs and returns home to find it.'' 
For business travelers, those needs may be as simple as an AC outlet, 
an incoming phone line, a chair and a flat surface for spreading out 
papers. But just try finding them near most airport departure gates. 
Instead, you're likely to encounter a business employee in a suit, 
sitting on the dusty carpet between the Coke machine and the utility 
closet, typing away on a recharging laptop. Now a new company, Laptop 
Lane, is trying to make it easier to do business on the fly. In the 
Cincinnati and Seattle airports, Laptop Lane leases offices offering 
what it calls ``peace, quiet and a T-1 line.'' For $8.95 a half-hour, 
travelers can use a cubicle with a Micron Pentium PC equipped with 
major e-mail and business software and computer games; a dedicated, 
incoming fax line; four telephone lines; a laser printer; a place 
to plug in their laptops; free local calls; 25-cents-a-minute long-distance 
service; and a lockable door. Peripatetic executives can connect their 
laptops to a 56K modem or, if they have an Ethernet card, a T-1 line 
that moves data at 1.5 megabytes per second. Conference calls for 
up to six parties can be arranged, and a color laser printer is available. 
The offices are separated by partitions, over which the muffled tones 
of business conversations in many languages and requests for copy 
machines (they're provided) can be heard, but no more loudly than 
in most offices. ``Theoretically, someone could be in here on a notebook, 
reading e-mail, getting a fax, talking to four people and charging 
the laptop battery,'' said Bruce Merrell, the company's chief executive 
officer. More Laptop Lanes are scheduled to open in Atlanta and O'Hare 
International Airport in Chicago by Christmas, and in Laguardia Airport, 
Philadelphia and Los Angeles by the first quarter of next year. Similar 
technical services are now available in some airports, but seldom 
in such concentration. Terry Colegrove, a project manager with Siemens, 
which provides consulting services to airports, said many airports 
offer kiosks in which travelers can log on to the Internet. ``It has 
not taken off to that great an extent, but it will in the near future, 
probably,'' he said. ``Airports have got to look into more in the 
way of holding rooms and plug-in facilities for laptops.'' Merrell 
helped establish Laptop Lane, which is based in Seattle, after spending 
a year commuting from there to South Dakota. ``I became surgically 
attached to my laptop,'' he said, ``and a life member of United's 
Red Carpet Club, but I found I needed more services'' _ in particular, 
privacy. ``Give me five minutes in any club room in America,'' he 
said, ``and I can tell you what everyone's working on.'' There are 
12 cubicles in the Laptop Lane in Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International 
Airport, and 7 in Seattle/Tacoma International Airport, as well as 
a conference room. Both centers serve 30 to 40 people a day, for an 
average stay of 35 minutes, Merrell said. As a side benefit, Laptop 
Lane offers travelers a chance to test-drive high-tech products and 
try their own applications on advanced hardware. There are also plans 
to lease cellular telephones and laptops. For those who are worried 
about sharing an office with many fellow travelers, there's little 
chance that bugs, viruses or cookie crumbs of any kind will be left 
on the desks, telephones or computers. After each patron leaves, Laptop 
Lane's cyber concierge quickly slips in a disk to reboot each computer's 
hard drive and get rid of any files or Internet tracks. The concierge 
then spritzes the telephone, desk and doorknob with disinfectant, 
readying the office for the next traveler.
