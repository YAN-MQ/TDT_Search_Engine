Decision '98 -- the fallout, and the future. A stunning lesson for 
congressional republicans, breathing room for President Clinton, powerful 
new forces on the political landscape. What it means for America, 
and for you. "In depth" tonight -- the champ! Jesse, Jesse! Nobody 
thought he had a chance, and then he shocked the world -- from pro 
wrestler to governor. Wanted! The FBI, tonight, thinks this man may 
know secrets they need to crack the case of a doctor, brutally murdered 
for performing abortions. And, a tax you've never heard of, but you 
pay it every time you're on the phone! Tonight's "fleecing of America." 
broadcasting company, Inc. Good evening.
