Democrats also say the election shows Americans aren't interested 
in impeaching the president. But house Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde 
insists the results will have no effect on his committee's inquiry. 
He says -- Hyde is not alone in his opinion. There are those who said 
that by defending the constitution, by speaking out for the rule of 
law and by insisting that no American can be above the law, we republicans 
were ignoring the polls. Those people were right. But some things 
are really more important than politics. And we should never be deterred 
from pursuing our principles. Again and again, faced with an opportunity 
to do the business of the american people, to do the people's business, 
the speaker and the republican party focused the bright lights on 
the Lewinsky matter. And I don't think the American people were the 
beneficiaries.
