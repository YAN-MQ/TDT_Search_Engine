A prosecution witness in the trial of former Malaysian Deputy Prime 
Minister Anwar Ebraheem says, Mr. Anwar urged police to intimidate 
people who alleged he was guilty of sexual misconduct. A former top 
police officer testified that Mr. Anwar ordered him, last year, to 
arrest two people who made the allegations, in a letter to Prime Minister 
Mahateer Mohammad. Mr. Anwar has pleaded not guilty to corruption 
and sexual misconduct charges, saying his is the victim of a political 
conspiracy. I'm Bill Hazard, VOA News.
