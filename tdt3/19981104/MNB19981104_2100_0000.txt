The morning after. Democrats awake to a big surprise. Huge advances 
nationwide where they had been girding for disasters. Republicans 
suffer the consequences. Big losses in some cases where they were 
hoping for home runs. What will it do to management on the hill? There 
are open questions being asked about the speaker of the house, the 
senate leader, and their ability to lead after presiding over something 
of a political fumble. And as for the president, what's in it for 
him? Is the specter of a full-blown impeachment spectacle any less 
likely tonight? And he's the only governor-elect in America with his 
own action figure. Meet Minnesota's new governing body.
