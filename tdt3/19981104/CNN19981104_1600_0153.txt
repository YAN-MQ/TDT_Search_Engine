While the GOP retained control of Congress, their Slim margin in the 
house got slimmer. Republicans lost five seats, dropping from the 
current 228 to 223. Democrats did better than predicted, winning 210 
seats, and are leading in one more race, in Oregon. The house's lone 
independent, congressman Bernard Sanders of Vermont, was re-elected. 
He often votes with democrats. House speaker Newt Gingrich says there's 
a lesson to be learned from the election. There's only one one team 
which has won control, kept control, and then won a third election 
in 70 years. We nay have a lot of things to look at, but if you look 
at whether we were losing govships, there's a lot for all republicans 
to learn from last night's election. But it's hard to argue that the 
only team to have been successful in 70 years, ought to be replaced 
by someone who has never won a national election.
