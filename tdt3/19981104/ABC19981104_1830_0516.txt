George W. bush has an impressive victory. Before the night was out, 
some republicans were practically anointing him as their presidential 
candidate two years from now. ABC's dean Reynolds reports from Texas. 
Thank you, MA'am. And bush has a network of well-healed contributors 
who helped to bankroll a media campaign as slick as most races for 
the White House. His appeal to democrats, especially Hispanics is 
a big political plus. While the governor opposes abortion and favors 
the death penalty and school prayer, he doesn't sound strident. I 
don't think he's the favorite of the evangelical right of the republican 
party. But initially, he appears to be at least acceptable. And that's 
absolutely critical. And being from a famous family doesn't hurt. 
She helps a lot. No, I do not. Of course, you do. He clearly loves 
campaigning, but he has said repeatedly that he is reluctant to put 
his family through what he calls the Washington political meat grinder. 
And that has led to speculation that George W. bush lacks the requisite 
fire in the belly to make a race for the White House. Then there are 
the questions about the governor's admittedly irresponsible behavior 
as a young adult. It all started because somebody discovered I quit 
drinking. And somebody said, well, why did you quit drinking? And 
I said, because I was drinking too much. This being the '90s, bush 
has had to assure people that he's been faithful to his wife Laura. 
If there was something in my closet that would disqualify me from 
a run, you'd know about it. He says he will concentrate on being governor 
for the next few months before deciding what to do about 2000. Whatever 
the decision, there's no question a lot of people will be waiting 
to hear what it is. Dean Reynolds, ABC News, Laredo, Texas.
