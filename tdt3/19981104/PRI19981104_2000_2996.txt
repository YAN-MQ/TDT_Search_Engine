This is THE WORLD. I'm Lisa Mullins. Unravel your maps 'cause it's 
time for today's Geography Quiz. We're searching for a nation in the 
heart of Africa. And your first clue: It's a place that shares its 
borders with five other countries. There's Chad to the north, Sudan 
to the east, Zaire and Congo to the south, and Cameroon to the west. 
Grasslands grace the northern half of our mystery location. As for 
people, well, there aren't a lot but there's many a lion, leopard, 
and bongo - a kind of antelope with curled antlers - roaming the Savannah. 
The human population prefers the equatorial south which is where the 
dense tropical rain forests grow. The official language is French, 
a legacy of the European colonizers, but the lingua franca is called 
Sango. Now you go and find the answer which we will reveal in just 
a couple of minutes.
