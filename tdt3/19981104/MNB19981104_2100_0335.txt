So one of the looming questions after last night, what does this mean 
for those hearings on the hill? Henry Hyde, the chairman of the Judiciary 
committee is his show after this. He said today nothing had changed, 
nothing had changed about the constitution, but there is some debate 
about the hearings. And with us tonight is a republican member of 
that committee. In a moment we're going to talk to congressman Asa 
Hutchinson of the state of Arkansas. We also have some news to report 
on what the committee might be considering. We'll have that conversation 
when we come back.
