That's "Dollars & Sense" for now. Krads written, back to you. Good 
to see you, Valerie. Good to see you, too. We'll have pro hockey scores 
highlits up next, in "CNN Headline Sports." If you could accompany 
your data on its trip overseas the experience would be alarming. Local 
carriers handing it to national carriers over to cable carriers... 
till you don't know who has your data. Unless you send it through 
here. With the one and only company that owns the entire network-- 
local, national, and international. So you know who has your data. 
On-net. From MCI Worldcom. Mike Sammond, "CNN Headline Sports."
