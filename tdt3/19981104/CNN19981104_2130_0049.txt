There may be dissention in the GOP ranks after a better-than-expected 
performance by democrats in the midterm elections. Sources tell CNN, 
house speaker Newt Gingrich has been warned of "broad dissatisfaction 
with him" by republican leaders. Sources say house republicans may 
oust Gingrich as house speaker when they meet to discuss the matter 
later this month. This follows a day in which democrats picked up 
at least five seats in the house and held their own in the Senate 
and in governorships. President Clinton is calling the election a 
vindication of his policies over politics. The American people basically 
said to all of us, all of us, you know, "we sent you there to work 
for us. And we want you to find a way to do it, to address the challenges 
we face and to bring this country together and to move this country 
forward." I think that was the loud, clear, completely unambiguous 
message of the election.
