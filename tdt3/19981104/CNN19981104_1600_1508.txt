Tales of cancellations and carnage are dominating the fall TV season. 
But as Paul Vercammen reports, many surprise shows are surviving the 
cut and making the grade. The power of three will set us free. The 
power of three will set us free. In a fall with no breakout new hits, 
this must be the season of the witch -- "charmed" with Shannen Doherty 
and Alyssa Milano is helping ratings rise for the WB. Overall, the 
WB's numbers are way up compared to last year, and it's one of the 
only networks that's actually seeing a real gain in viewers. So they're 
doin' -- they get the "A" hands down over anybody else. While the 
WB's ratings can't touch major network hits, the advertisers love 
its young audience. "Charmed" averages almost 5 million viewers a 
week. You don't have feelings for me, do you? "felicity" is also building 
a following. Among the major networks, CBS boasts the highest-rated 
new drama, "martial law" -- and the new comedy "king of Queens" is 
generating some buzz. I'll give us an A-minus, which I'll -- I would 
say is the highest grade of the four networks. I think we've had a 
lot more good news than bad news. Led by CBS, the other networks are 
closing the ratings gap on NBC this season. why? Most critics point 
to the end of "Seinfeld's" run. You give, I'll receive. Just as God 
intended it. But the peacock network is getting some encouraging numbers 
from newcomers "will & grace" and "Jesse" -- benefitting from a coveted 
thursday-night time slot on NBC. Christina Applegate plays the title 
character in an ensemble cast. I am nothing without them, and they 
are nothing without me. And we work so well to hold each other up. 
And if one piece falls off, then the whole thing falls apart. ABC 
is showing confidence in its new programming, from "sports night" 
to "the secret lives of men." No ABC cancellations thus far. I feel 
like a stranger in a strange land. "the hughleys," about a black family 
in suburbia, is faring the best of all new ABC sitcoms in the ratings. 
This show only needs for people to watch. I don't think that it needs 
-- it is a show uniquely and truly about life. So far, "that '70s 
show," is earning highest marks on any of the fox network's newcomers. 
Something to celebrate, when other shows, NBC's "wind on water," CBS' 
"the brian Benben show" and fox's "Costello" have already been kicked 
out of class and off TV. Paul Vercammen, "CNN Entertainment News," 
Hollywood.
