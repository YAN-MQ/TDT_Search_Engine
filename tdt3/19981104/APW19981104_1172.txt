Manchester United exploded for four first-half goal to beat Denmark's 
Brondby 5-0 Wednesday in a Champions League match in Group D. The 
English side beat Brondby 6-2 two weeks ago in Denmark and this outing 
was just as bad as David Beckham scored in the 7th with subsequent 
goals by Andy Cole (13th), Phil Neville (15th) and Dwight Yorke (27th). 
Paul Scholes added another in the 63rd. Manchester United manager 
Alex Ferguson eased up in the second half when he brought on substitutes 
Jordi Cruyff and Ole Solskjaer. The Dane's weren't helped by the absence 
of No. 1 goalkeeper Mogens Krogh, who missed the match with a back 
injury with backup Emeka Andersen getting the call. The victory gave 
Manchester United eight points from four games to lead Group D. Brondy 
has three.
