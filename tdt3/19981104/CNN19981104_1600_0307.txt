Prosecutors have announced a 238 count indictment against Saudi millionaire 
osama bin laden in connection with the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa. 
Bin laden has been secretly charged with participating in a general 
campaign against U.S. interests. The state department is offering 
a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest. 
New charges link him directly to bombings last summer at the U.S. 
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 224 people were killed, including 
12 Americans.
