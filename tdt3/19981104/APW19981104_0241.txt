Bands of armed militants raided a city in northern Tajikistan early 
Wednesday, battling government troops and seizing several administrative 
buildings in heavy fighting, officials said. The attackers are led 
by Makhmud Khudoberdyev, a former army colonel who turned against 
President Emomali Rakhmonov last year and then fled to neighboring 
Uzbekistan. The assailants seized all administrative buildings in 
the city of Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the 
capital, Dushanbe. They also took control of the city airport, said 
Rakhmonov's spokesman Zafar Saidov. At least 10 government troops 
were killed in fighting, and the attackers also seized some 30 police 
officers as hostages, Saidov said in a telephone interview. The local 
police chief was badly wounded in the battle. The president chaired 
an emergency government session to discuss the crisis and ordered 
all troops be put on alert. Russia's 201st motorized infantry division, 
deployed in Tajikistan to support the government, has also been put 
in combat readiness. The attackers didn't pose any immediate demands. 
Khudoberdyev broke away from the government after it signed a peace 
deal with the mostly Islamic opposition in the summer of 1997. The 
agreement formally ended a five-year civil war, but the impoverished 
former Soviet republic continues to suffer from frequent outbursts 
of violence. Many opposition warlords and government commanders have 
refused to acknowledge the peace deal. ``The attack is aimed at thwarting 
the peace process in the republic,'' Saidov said.
