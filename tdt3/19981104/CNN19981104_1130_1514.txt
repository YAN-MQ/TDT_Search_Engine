The Internet has changed the way people communicate, shop and even 
invest. But how will it influence the world of politics? Peter viles 
reports. In politics, this was the year the Internet came of age. 
Millions logged on to read the Starr report, millions more to watch 
the president testify. And this fall, candidates flocked to the web 
seeking votes. I think what the Internet has done this year, as opposed 
to other years, is that, traditionally, you had five media in a political 
media mix -- television, radio, newspaper, direct mail and phones. 
Now, the Internet has taken its position as the sixth medium in that 
political campaign media mix. a nationwide survey this summer found 
that 63% of campaigns had a Web site. The percentage was much higher, 
85%, for campaigns with total budgets exceeding $1 million. But the 
web sites were fairly basic -- only 6% offered sound or pictures. 
Significantly, 33% of campaigns were using E-mail for mass mailings 
to voters. California gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren used this 
site to sign up 1,400 volunteers. His opponent, Gray Davis, uses his 
web page to transmit live video of campaign rallies. But for now, 
analysts say most Internet campaigning is more primitive, often as 
basic as this billboard on the home page of Alabama governor fob james. 
Most candidates really don't know why they're using the Internet right 
now. They know that some people are going to look at it, they have 
some sense that it's going to reach some voters. But there's an old 
saying in politics, "50% of what you spend is wasted." But you just 
don't know which half is wasted. Analysts say E-mail may hold the 
key to future on-line campaigning, because it's so much faster and 
cheaper than reaching supporters via direct mail. Peter viles, "CNN 
Financial News," New York.
