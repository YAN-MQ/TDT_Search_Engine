Turkey's premier and deputy premier talked over a U.S.-backed Kurdish 
peace plan with an Iraqi Kurd leader on Wednesday, afterward declaring 
themselves reassured the plan would not lead to creation of a Kurdish 
state. The September agreement sealed a cease-fire between the two 
Iraqi Kurdish factions that control northern Iraq. The accord made 
reference to a future federal structure for Kurds, alarming Turkey. 
With Iraq, Turkey opposes creation of a Kurdish state in northern 
Iraq, fearing it would encourage Kurdish rebels in its own country. 
Massoud Barzani of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, one of the two 
factions in the accord, talked separately in Ankara with Deputy Premier 
Bulent Ecevit and Premier Mesut Yilmaz. ``Reference to a federal solution 
in the declaration were disturbing to us, but Mr. Barzani today made 
an announcement that appeased our fears,'' Ecevit told reporters after 
the meeting. Crucially, Ecevit said, Barzani agreed that ``Any solution 
to northern Iraq has to be within the territorial integrity of Iraq.'' 
Under the cease-fire accord, Barzani and Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan agreed to share power and hold elections in the 
de facto autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Iraq, set by after 1991 
Gulf War. Talabani is due to arrive in Ankara on Saturday. It was 
unclear if the two former armed rivals would meet. In Barzani's talks 
with Turkey's leaders, Yilmaz said, Barzani agreed to increase cooperation 
in the fight against the Turkish Kurdish rebel group PKK, which carries 
out cross-border attacks from hideouts in northern Iraq.
