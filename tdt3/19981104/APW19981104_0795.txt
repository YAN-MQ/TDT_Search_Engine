French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Wednesday he could do nothing 
for a Dutch cyclist detained since his arrest on suspicion of doping 
during the Tour de France. Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok pressed the 
plight of TVM team leader Cees Priem during a working lunch with Jospin 
at Kok's official residence in The Hague. But Jospin told reporters 
his hands were tied. ``The French judicial system is totally independent. 
We can't tell them what to do,'' he said. Priem was arrested July 
23 with TVM physician Dr. Andrei Mikhailov after performance-enhancing 
drugs were discovered in the team's hotel. Although he has not yet 
been charged and is not in custody, Priem has not been allowed to 
leave France and must check in daily with authorities. He has been 
placed under formal investigation, a step short of being formally 
charged. The president of the Royal Dutch Cycling Union recently suggested 
that French authorities might be holding Priem to protest the liberal 
Dutch drug policy which has often led to tension between the two nations. 
Jospin dismissed that claim Wednesday. ``I can tell you one thing,'' 
he said. ``We are involved in a struggle against doping in sport ... 
I am sure everyone agrees with the necessity of eradicating doping 
from sport.'' The investigation of the TVM team began in March, when 
French customs agents found about 100 doses of EPO, a synthetic hormone 
which increases oxygen to the red blood cells, in a team vehicle. 
That discovery was publicized following the outbreak of the scandal 
involving the Spanish team Festina, which was kicked out of the Tour 
after some of its riders admitted taking performance-enhancing drugs.
