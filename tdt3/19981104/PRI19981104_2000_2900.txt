Coming up, Jah love French style on PRI, Public Radio International. 
Good evening, I'm Joe Presudo Pamaco. And here's what's coming up 
in the next several hours on 91 FM. At on "Talk of the Nation," we'll 
examine how communities can prepare for natural disasters, this as 
the death toll from Hurricane Mitch continues to climb in Central 
America. That's at 9:00. Then at 10:00 tonight, it's "This America 
Life" with Ira Glass. On tonight's broadcast, writer Jack Hit goes 
on a search for a mysterious neighbor from his childhood in Charleston, 
South Carolina and stumbles onto an epic story of the old South, the 
new South, gender confusion, and Chihuahuas. That's coming up at 10:00 
tonight. Then at 11:00, Charlie Rose's scheduled guests include Steve 
Case, chairman of AOL.com, and Ken Burns, co-director with Lynn Novik 
of the new program, "Frank Lloyd Wright." That's at 11:00 on the "Charlie 
Rose Show."
