20,000 Iranians are marking the anniversary of the U.S. embassy takeover 
in tehran. 19 years ago today, Islamic students seized the embassy, 
holding 52 americans hostage for 444 days. Today's crowd was made 
up mostly of schoolchildren, who were given the day off for the rally. 
Calls for "death to Israel" drew a louder response than calls for 
"death to america."
