A jury in Royal Oak, Michigan has convicted Dr. Jack Kevorkian of 
interfering with police and resisting arrest. The jury found the assisted 
suicide advocate guilty of two misdemeanors but acquitted his associate 
on the same charges. The charges stemmed from a confrontation with 
police outside a hospital when Kevorkian was dropping off a body. 
The judge ordered Kevorkian to pay a $700 fine along with $200 in 
court costs or serve 60 days in jail. The fine and cost were paid 
by one of Kevorkian's supporters.
