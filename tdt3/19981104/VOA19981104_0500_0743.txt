The death toll continues to climb, in Central America, from Hurricane 
Mitch. More than 9000 people have died, 7000 in Honduras, and more 
than 2000 in Nicaragua. Hundreds more are dead in El Salvador and 
Guatemala. Rescuers are still pulling bodies from the mud. About 14,000 
people are missing, and more than one million are homeless. United 
Nations ambassadors from five Central American nations have launched 
an appeal for international aid. UN correspondent Max Ruston has details. 
The ambassadors from Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, 
and Nicaragua launched the appeal for emergency aid. They spoke in 
detail about the thousands of deaths, and the billions of dollars 
damage, mostly caused by flooding and landslides triggered by Hurricane 
Mitch. Honduran Ambassador, Hugo Norepino spoke about the plight in 
his country. As you know, this is a terrible scenario for us. Particularly, 
Honduras is very, very hard, because we think that we have gone back 
at least 30 years in our effort. Nicaragua's ambassador said, natural 
disasters and warfare have left his country in no position to deal 
with the consequences of the hurricane. The five ambassadors also 
met with the Secretary General of the United Nations to discuss their 
appeal. Nicaragua and Honduras are the two countries hardest hit by 
the hurricane. In addition to the thousands of people killed there, 
hundreds of thousands were left homeless. Extensive road systems and 
dozens of bridges were wiped out. Earlier this week, UN Secretary 
General Kofie Annon expressed his condolences to the victims of the 
disaster. The UN General Assembly has asked all countries to urgently 
and generously extend assistance to the region. UN emergency relief 
officials began arriving in the region, Tuesday, to determine the 
extent and priority of needs. UN agencies are already distributing 
or preparing to distribute medicines, emergency food supplies, and 
oral rehydration salts for children suffering from diarrhea. UN officials 
say it is essential to provide aid to the region, quickly, to prevent 
outbreaks of cholera, malaria, and other diseases. Max Ruston, VOA
