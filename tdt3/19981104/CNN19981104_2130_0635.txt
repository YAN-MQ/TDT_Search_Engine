The Internet was buzzing last night with news and updates about the 
elections. As Rick Lockridge reports, that could be only the tip of 
the iceberg. The classic election night scene -- the ballroom, the 
balloons. The media. The mingling. Good to see you. But drawing much 
of the attention on this night, the Internet, showing its versatility 
as an election-time tool. Web sites are definitely coming. The Internet 
is definitely coming. In years past, you would have seen local TV 
coverage up there on that big screen. But the Internet allows these 
supporters to zone in on the handful of races they're really interested 
in, and that's just what they're doing. It's definitely a developing 
factor in elections. It's hard to catch any statewide candidate without 
a web site. And some of those web sites are pretty slick. Jeb bush's, 
for one. You can see the Florida republican in action, read his speeches, 
even order jeb wear. At this candidate's site, you get patriotic music. 
Didn't help him, though. He lost. Though TV is still the dominant 
medium, the net had a few stars of its own on election eve, including 
J.F.K. Jr., who chatted on AOL, and predicted an even bigger role 
for the web in future elections. Overnight Internet ratings showed 
an 80% increase in the number of americans who surfed web news sites 
versus an ordinary Tuesday. Among them -- Bill Clinton. Particular 
people who he knew or races whoo he paid particular attention to or 
had gone in and campaigned for and sort of check around in a real 
time way. Already a remarkable force in society, the Internet seems 
poised to play an even greater role in elections to come. Two we'res 
from now we may see debates conducted over the Internet. We may see 
even an higher profile for this medium in the context of the electoral 
process. And perhaps someday we'll even vote with a point and click, 
instead of a fold and drop. Rick Lockridge, CNN, Atlanta.
