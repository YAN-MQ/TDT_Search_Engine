Davis Cup tennis team for 1999. Gullickson who has been the captain 
of the team since 1994 was reappointed on Tuesday. He has an over 
all Davis Cup record of 12 and 4, and led the US team to a title victory 
over Russia in 1995. In 1997, the Americans made it to the finals 
before losing to Sweden, but in September, Gullickson's team missing 
top players such as Pete Sampras, Andre Aggassi, Michael Chang, was
