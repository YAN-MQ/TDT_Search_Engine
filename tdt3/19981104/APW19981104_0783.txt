A Ugandan confessed Wednesday to killing an American woman and seven 
others, then tried to strangle the magistrate who took his statement, 
police said. Richard Arinaitwe admitting killing Maria Cecilia Goetz, 
a 35-year-old Minneapolis woman, at a downtown Kampala hotel on July 
28, said Chris Bakiza, director of criminal investigations. The 21-year-old 
also said he killed seven other people, Bakiza told a news conference, 
refusing to release additional details. Arinaitwe will be charged 
later this week, Bakiza said. After giving his confession to Kampala 
Magistrate Elizabeth Jane Alividza, Arinaitwe asked her for a glass 
of water. While her back was turned, Arinaitwe grabbed her by the 
neck, and tried to strangle her, Bakiza said. A courtroom police officer 
who heard their scuffle quickly subdued Arinaitwe, and the magistrate 
was unharmed, he said. Arinaitwe was arrested earlier this week after 
he robbed a Kenyan of dlrs 3,600 at a hotel, Bakiza said. The researcher 
remembered the license plate number of the getaway car, which police 
used to track down Arinaitwe. At his house, police found three pistols 
and three knives. One knife matched a leather sheath found in the 
hotel room of the slain American, Bakiza said. Goetz's body bore deep 
knife wounds on the lower left abdomen and on the left side of the 
mouth. She was a programmer for East Africa Minnesota Information 
Health Volunteers.
