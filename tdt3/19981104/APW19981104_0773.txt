Despite market turbulence that hurt many small investors, Poles are 
diving back into the stock market, opening thousands of new accounts 
to take advantage of Central Europe's largest-ever initial public 
offering: the Polish telephone company. ``Investing in the stock market 
is still a good way to make money,'' insists Rafal Parczewski, a 21-year-old 
law student who plans to borrow 10,000 zloty (dlrs 2,900) to buy shares 
in Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPSA). When the three-week subscription 
period for domestic investors ends Friday, Poles will have signed 
up for about 100 million shares, twice as much as the allocated amount, 
according to an estimate by the Polish daily Law and Economy newspaper. 
The successful offering indicates Poles are becoming used to market 
bears and bulls only seven years after the Warsaw Stock Exchange was 
founded. Poles initially were enthusiastic about investing, but many 
left once they realized that they could lose money as well as make 
it. Still, enough returned to make large sales this year, like that 
of copper giant KGHM and Grupa Pekao SA, the largest commercial bank, 
successful. Then in August, Russia's financial crisis erupted. The 
average turnover on the Warsaw's stock exchange fell by more than 
half, to 100 million zloty (dlrs 29 million) a day from 250 million 
zloty (dlrs 72 million), said Piotr Kazimierski, an analyst with CAIB 
Securities. The story was the same across eastern Europe. Citing weak 
markets, Russia and Bulgaria withdrew plans to sell shares in their 
telecommunications companies. In the Balkans, Greece scaled down its 
offering. Poland, though, decided to go ahead with its sale, although 
at a price _ 14.5-18 zloty (dlrs 4.20 to 5.20) a share _ that was 
only about half what analysts had anticipated in early 1997. Officials 
said they were afraid delay would cause price to drop further. And 
backed by heavy advertising, the TPSA offering is bringing Poles back 
to the stock market. In the past two months, brokers at PBK SA, which 
is overseeing the telecom sale, opened 6,000 new accounts _ as many 
as it did over the past nine months, said PBK director Adam Parfiniewicz. 
``It should be a good investment because TPSA will not certainly go 
bankrupt,'' said Grzegorz Adamczyk, 44, a construction engineer planning 
to buy at least 1,000 shares. ``It makes money on our phone calls 
and we surely won't be calling less.'' Poles have a chance to buy 
49 million shares, or 3.5 percent of the company's entire stock, estimated 
at more than dlrs 8 billion. Ten percent is being offered to foreign 
institutional investors, and 1.5 percent to domestic institutions. 
With 8 million subscribers in Poland, TPSA controls 97 percent of 
the market in a country of 39 million people. Although Poland has 
started opening its telecommunication market, competition for TPSA 
will be restricted for many years. And pent-up demand in this booming 
economy is huge: 2.5 million Poles are waiting for a telephone. Yet, 
the former communist-style monopoly is notorious for poor service 
and lack of efficiency compared with its Central European peers. For 
example, TPSA has just 107 lines per employee, compared 167 for Hungary's 
Matav. Large investments the company requires before restructuring 
is completed means it will not bring high short-term profit, according 
to Artur Jasinski, BGZ stockbroker. But Poles seem hopeful as they 
buy their shares. ``I did it out of curiosity because the sale was 
so advertised,'' said Teresa Wawrzyniec, a shop clerk who is investing 
in the stock market for the first time. ``I want to see what will 
happen.''
