A major upset for both parties in Minnesota. Former pro wrestler Jesse 
"the body" Ventura, running on the ticket of Ross perot's "reform 
party" is projected the winner of the race for governor. They've declared 
me the winner, but I still would prefer to see alled votes counted, 
because the experts were wrong when they said I couldn't win. I want 
to make sure they're not wrong that I have won. What can you tell 
the people of Minnesota? If this does hold up, what can you tell them 
about your governing the state of Minnesota? I'll do the best job 
I can do and make Minnesota proud of me as I'm proufd them. He defeted 
skip Humphrey, and the republican mayor of St. Paul Norm coleman. 
He did it. He body slammed them.
