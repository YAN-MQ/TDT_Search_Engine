How about this one? Blockbuster Video is a popular international chain 
of video stores with millions of customers. So, it apparently can 
afford to enforce its rules for everybody, no matter how prominent 
he or she might be. Now, here's an example. It's reported that American 
Actor, Tom Cruise, ran into some resistance from a Blockbuster store 
in London. He tried to check out a video, but he wasn't able to. Even 
though employees recognized Cruise as the star of several top movies, 
he wasn't allowed to rent a tape. That was because he didn't have 
two forms of identification with him. A Blockbuster Video spokesman 
said, the rule applies to everybody, even if you are a household name.
