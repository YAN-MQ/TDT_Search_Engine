Hundreds of thousands of people remain homeless, and thousands more 
are still missing in Central America, in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Mitch. The death toll is estimated at 9000 and is expected to climb. 
The scope of the devastation in Honduras and Nicaragua is overwhelming 
relief efforts. Survivors are said to be expressing frustration at 
the slow pace of recovery efforts. An angry crowd in Nicaragua screamed 
"murderer" and "give us more food" at President Renaldo Illnan, Tuesday. 
There are shortages of food, clean water, medicines, blood, and other 
basic supplies.
