And New Zealand golfers Frank Novello and Greg Turner have been named 
as captains choices to the international team that will face the United 
States in the President's Cup next month. Robert Allenby of Australia 
had been promoted as a possibility to make the team. But he was overlooked 
by team captain Peter Thompson. Meanwhile, US Captain Jack Niklaus 
picked Fred Couples and John Houston to fill out his roster. The top 
ten money winners on the US PGA tour automatically qualified for the 
team.
