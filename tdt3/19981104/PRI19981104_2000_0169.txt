American mediators are trying to resolve a snag that has delayed Israeli 
ratification of a new peace agreement with the Palestinians. NPR's 
Ted Clark reports. The Y River Agreement mediated by President Clinton 
last month calls for further Israeli withdrawals from occupied West 
Bank and additional Palestinian action against terrorism. But Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not seek ratification of the 
deal until the United States provides written assurances that Palestinian 
authorities will arrest 30 people suspected of killing Israelis. The 
Y River Agreement did not specifically name suspects. American officials 
have been in close contact with both sides in an effort to resolve 
this problem. The State Department won't call it a crisis. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright has been in almost daily phone contact 
with Netanyahu. U.S. Envoy Dennis Ross will go to the Mid East this 
week. Ted Clark, NPR News, Washington.
