NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA expects to decide by Monday how to deal 
with an incident which caused the suspension of a UEFA Cup match between 
Fiorentina and Grasshoppers of Switzerland, the European governing 
body said Wednesday. UEFA representatives asked the referee not to 
start the second half of Tuesday's second-round second leg match after 
a Belgian off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device 
hurled from the stands. There will be no replay of Wednesday's match, 
UEFA said in a statement. A decision will be taken by UEFA's control 
and disciplinary body. ``We need to know the details'' before deciding 
what action to take, UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonella said. The game 
was being played in Salerno, near Naples, following the suspension 
of Fiorentina's own ground and to raise funds for the victims of recent 
floodings in southern Italy. The away home match was the second of 
a two-game suspension imposed on Fiortina's Franchi stadium, the result 
of fan behavior during a European Cup Winners Cup match against Barcelona 
in 1997. Although playing away from home, Fiorentina still was considered 
responsible for the fans' behavior in Salerno. ``We behaved in accordance 
with the rules,'' the Swiss sports agency SI quoted Grasshoppers sport 
director Erich Vogel as saying. ``Now we're waiting for the UEFA decision.'' 
``We just have to wait and see what UEFA decides,'' Fiorentina coach 
Giovanni Trappatoni told Italy's Canale 5 television. The mayor of 
Salerno and the head of the Salerno fan club both apologized for the 
incident. In 1989, Dutch club Ajax was suspended from European competition 
for one year after a fan threw a piece of steel fence at a visiting 
team's goalkeeper. UEFA also punished Ajax with a 3-0 forfeit and 
ruled the club must play three European games after the ban in a stadium 
at least 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Amsterdam. The injured official, 
Philippe Flament, was taken to hospital with a right knee injury. 
The incident occurred as players and officials were walking to the 
dressing rooms at the end of the first half. Draws for third-round 
games of the European competition are scheduled on Friday. Fiorentina, 
which had won the first leg 2-0, was a favorite to qualify. The Italian 
club was leading 2-1 after 45 minutes of the second leg.
