There's a possible break tonight in the case of the obs strigs in 
upstate New York who was murdered because he performed abortions as 
part of his practice. The FBI is looking for a Vermont man with ties 
to the anti-abortion movement as a possible material witness. More 
now from Pete Williams tonight. Federal investigators say they're 
looking for a man who may have been around the Buffalo, New York, 
home of Dr. Bernard slepian before last month's shooting. They're 
not calling him a suspect, but they want to question 44-year-old james 
Charles kopp of Vermont. They say his black 1987 Chevrolet cavalier 
was seen around Dr. slepian's house in the weeks before the shooting, 
Vermont license bpe 216. Authorities have been to kopp's last known 
address in rural Vermont, a Nine-hour drive away from slepian's house, 
but no sign of him. We don't have any idea where he is. We're looking 
for him everyplace we can, everyplace we might look. So, today, federal 
agents got a warrant, allowing them to arrest kopp as a material witness. 
Investigators say they're acting with a sense of urgency, because 
slepian's shooting, by a sniper hiding in the Woods just outside his 
home, appears to fit a four-year pattern of attacks on doctors in 
New York and Canada, most around just this time of year, early to 
mid-November. And while kopp is officially only a witness, authorities 
say he has a History of arrests for abortion protests. NBC news has 
learned his arrests began in Atlanta and Houston in 1988, burlington, 
Vermont in 1990, and in 1991, as this police report shows, in levittown, 
New York, for protesting abortion by trying to block a clinic entrance. 
Pro-life groups say he has a long history of illegal, though nonviolent 
protest. We find that he's had a very consistent, low-profile activity 
level that's been going on for what looks like about a decade, that 
we've been able to trace. Officials insist there isn't much more behind 
their search for kopp, other than his car and his background. But 
they want to find him quickly, in case he holds the key to this investigation.
