We close our show today with reggae from a singer and band based in 
Grenoble, France. The band and its front man are called Russbowa, 
a kind of compound name meaning racial harmony. Born in Benin in West 
Africa, Russbowa's mother sang professionally and his father was a 
building contractor. A perfect blend of his two parents, Russbowa 
is building a musical career and not just in French and Yuroba, but 
also in English. In a nod to Stevie Wonders urban life anthem Living 
for the City, Russbowa begins the angry title track to his second 
CD, Passport, with a scene too familiar for many African immigrants 
in France, the police check for immigration papers. Music from French 
reggae band Russbowa brings this edition of the program to a close. 
You can find out more about Russbowa at THE WORLD on line. That's

us again tomorrow.
