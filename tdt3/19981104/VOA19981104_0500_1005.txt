While voters across the United States, Tuesday for politicians, there 
were also votes cast for sports people. Outfielder Sammy Sosa of the 
Chicago Cubs has gotten the most votes on the 1998 Associated Press 
Major League Baseball All-Star Team. Sosa, who lost this thrilling 
home run chase, with four fewer round trippers then St. Louis Cardinal's 
first baseman Mark McGuire won in the ballet box. The Dominican outfielder 
picked up 187 votes in the nation-wide balloting by sports writers 
and broadcasters. That was five more than his St.Louis slugging rival. 
Only one player from the World Series Champion New York Yankees made 
the team, that was David Wells who was voted in as the left-handed 
starting pitcher.
