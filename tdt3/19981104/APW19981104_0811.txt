Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet on Wednesday approved German 
participation in NATO air surveillance over Yugoslavia's Kosovo province. 
Germany has committed some 350 soldiers to the operation, designed 
to monitor an Oct. 12 peace agreement between Serb forces and ethnic 
Albanian rebels. Germany will contribute 16 unmanned spy aircraft 
known as drones to the operation, which is being based is Skopje, 
Macedonia. The aim is to monitor the withdrawal of Serb forces from 
Kosovo and the safety of some 2,000 unarmed international observers 
monitoring the pullout. The government's decision requires the approval 
of parliament, which will vote on the matter next week. Defense Minister 
Rudolf Scharping said he expects easy passage in the legislature. 
Germany also expects to contribute about 100 soldiers to a special 
NATO force being set up to free observers if they are hindered or 
taken hostage by Serbs, Scharping said. Germany, France and Britain 
will take the lead role in the force, he said. Foreign Minister Joschka 
Fischer, a Greens party leader who once was a pacifist, said that 
experiences with U.N. peacekeepers being taken hostage in Bosnia made 
such a force necessary.
