Serhiy Rebrov, Oleksandr Holovko and Andriy Shevchenko scored Wednesday 
as Ukranian champions Dynamo Kiev defeated their English counterparts 
Arsenal 3-1 to tighten the Champions League race in Group E. The win 
gave Dynamo five points in four games, the same as Arsenal. Lens entered 
its match with Panathinaikos with five and the Greeks had three. Rebrov, 
pulled down in the area by Martin Keown, scored on a penalty in the 
27th as Dynamo took a 1-0 lead. Arsenal keeper David Seaman managed 
to get a hand on the ball to his right but it dropped in six inches 
(15 cm) over the line. It was Rebrov's late goal two weeks ago in 
England that salvaged a 1-1 draw for Dynamo. Holovko made it 2-0 on 
a header in the 62nd from eight meters (yards) off a long cross that 
gave Seaman no chance as it beat him to his left. Shevchenko, regarded 
as the best striker in Europe and reportedly bound for Italy, showed 
why in the 72nd on a perfectly struck free kick from 25 meters (yards) 
that curled into the corner. Stephen Hughes scored in the 84th for 
Arsenal. Playing before more than 65,000 on an Olympic stadium pitch 
softened by all-day rain, Dynamo Kiev took better advantage of its 
chances as Arsenal played without four key players. Tony Adams, Marc 
Overmars and Nicolas Anelka are injured and Dennis Bergkamp missed 
the match with an injury and because he is afraid to fly.
