It soon may be harder for perpetrators of domestic violence to find 
their victims. In a White House ceremony today, vice President Gore 
said the social security administration would make it easier for the 
victims to change their social security numbers. Under the new rules, 
new numbers could be issued if there was written confirmation about 
the abuse from a local Shelter, physician or police officer. It is 
unacceptable that women and children live in the United States like 
domestic refugees, that we're so often forced to flee our homes in 
the middle of the night for fear for our lives. I believe that if 
this was happening to any other group of people in any other part 
of the world, that they would be declared human rights atrocities. 
The social security administration will post steps people can take 
to change their social security numbers on its web page at -- www.ssa.gov
