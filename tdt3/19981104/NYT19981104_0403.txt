First he made seven Top 10 albums, as the producer and mastermind 
of the Wu-Tang Clan. He came up with one of the rawest, spookiest, 
most widely imitated musical styles of the 1990s. Then Robert Diggs, 
better known as the RZA, decided it was time to study music. ``I took 
the last two years going through books to learn how to play music,'' 
he said during an interview in a suite at the Royalton Hotel while 
other people bustled around. ``I just delved into them.'' The suite 
had been redecorated with shiny futuristic shapes inspired by the 
RZA's latest project and alias, a movie titled ``Bobby Digital'' and 
an album called ``RZA as Bobby Digital in Stereo'' (Gee Street/V2). 
Wearing an orange robe, a Lone Ranger-like mask on top of his head 
and two handfuls of rings, among them the Wu-Tang Clan's stylized 
``W,'' the RZA (pronounced RIZ-a) discussed his musical education 
while publicists, children, friends and girlfriends wandered in and 
out. A photographer for a European magazine set up lights and a tripod. 
A former Buddhist monk who had defected from China _ where he had 
been a member of the Shaolin order, which is noted for its feats of 
martial arts _ was hanging out. So was Ghostface Killah, a rapper 
from the Wu-Tang Clan, which got its name from kung-fu movies and 
referred to its home borough, Staten Island, as Shaolin. In Wu-Tang 
geography, Manhattan is Mecca, Brooklyn is Medina, and New Jersey 
is New Jerusalem. ``We named everything like Adam named things in 
the Garden of Eden,'' said the RZA. ``Oh, that's a good metaphor, 
right? I've got to remember that.'' Diggs, 28, began writing rhymes 
when he was 8. His other passion was kung-fu movies, and he would 
often skip school to head for the old movie houses on 42nd Street 
in Manhattan, where he would sit through triple bills to see a favorite 
movie twice. In 1987, he persuaded some friends from the Staten Island 
housing projects to chip in on a four-track tape recorder, which he 
promptly used to start putting together hip-hop tracks. He worked 
as a disk jockey and got together with the rappers who would later 
become the Wu-Tang Clan: Method Man, the Genius/GZA, Raekwon, Ghostface 
Killah, U-God, Inspectah Deck, Cappadonna, Masta Killa and Ol' Dirty 
Bastard. The Genius and Diggs (under another name, Prince Rakeem) 
each released albums in the early '90s that were generally ignored. 
In 1992, Diggs said, after he was tried and acquitted on a charge 
of attempted murder, he walked out of the courtroom and decided to 
get serious about making it in hip-hop: ``I went to Method Man, and 
I said: `Are you with me? I'm ready to do this. I want to get off 
these streets. If we don't get out of here, we're going to be dead.''' 
He plotted out every moment of the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, ``Enter 
the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).'' After reading books about the music business, 
he also oversaw contractual maneuvers that put the Wu-Tang Clan on 
one label and each member on a separate one; with more labels involved, 
the group benefited from additional promotion and varied marketing 
strategies. On ``Enter the Wu-Tang'' (Loud/RCA), on solo albums by 
Clan members and on the less focused 1997 album ``Wu-Tang Forever,'' 
the RZA's productions created an ominous, bombed-out urban sound, 
with rough-cut rhythms and elegiac, hovering strings. The music was 
simultaneously raw, ferocious and mournful, full of tension and bleak 
memories. ``He's universal,'' said Ghostface Killah. ``Those beats 
are straight from the basement, and they're also from the heart, the 
core, the soul. He's a doctor, and he's a scientist, he's intelligent 
to the max. And now he's risen to higher heights. He's orchestrating 
his own music. He doesn't have to sample, he can make it from scratch.'' 
The Clan's rappers, with the RZA among them, have discoursed on poverty 
and violence, philosophy and comedy, social uplift and rude sex, with 
rapid-fire delivery and enough personas to confuse outsiders and turn 
fans into cultists. ``We're all talented, and everybody's got a different 
style,'' said Ghostface Killah. ``It's like a pack of Life Savers.'' 
The raps are packed with internal rhymes and dense with allusions: 
to video games, movies, junk food, Scripture, science and members' 
lives. Someday a professor is bound to publish ``The Annotated Wu-Tang,'' 
footnoting every reference. ``You can't find many MCs who can make 
a rhyme make sense like that but be a conjunction of so many different 
thoughts,'' Diggs said. ``And it's still just the surface of our talent.'' 
The Clan has spun off a line of clothing, Wu-Wear, and associated 
hip-hop groups, like the Sunz of Man; in the last few years, the RZA 
has farmed out some of the production work to his apprentices. A Wu-Tang 
video game is also a possibility. But with hip-hop's breakneck evolution, 
the sound the RZA had created was so widely imitated that its impact 
started to wear off. The Wu-Tang trademark, which from 1994 to 1997 
guaranteed that a hip-hop album would zoom into the Top 10 the moment 
it was released, lost some of its cachet through dilution. For the 
RZA, studying music was one way of leaving the competition behind. 
``Now you've got rappers looking like us and acting like us over weak 
music, over recycled music and mediocre lyrics,'' he said. ``After 
five years and more than 250 songs, my sound is a common trait. I 
realized two years ago that people were going to jump in my world 
and start imitating it. That's when I started studying the music. 
Because they can't do that, they can't imitate that. ``I learned the 
notes, I can see them and read them. I don't have the speed yet, but 
I can read OK. I learned how to play drums. And I know the basic chords: 
E-A-B, that's the basic pop song. But then I confused myself, because 
I tried to keep playing, and I was losing some rawness. So I had to 
go through a year of weak beats, of corny beats. Then, after I got 
those out of me, I started getting some good ones again. ``I used 
to do anything on a track. Now, I'll do anything with a different 
tool. The griminess is what made Wu-Tang stand apart. But clear griminess, 
imagine that. Before, you turned my stuff up past seven, and it would 
distort. Now you can probably make it to nine before it distorts, 
so your car is more fuller with me now. But that old RZA crookedness, 
that weirdness about me, still exists.'' The RZA's latest burst of 
activity surfaces this month. ``Bobby Digital'' arrives as an album 
on Nov. 24 and as a straight-to-video film early in December. At the 
same time, Sony Music plans to release a greatest-hits album of his 
Wu-Tang productions. If he has time, he said, he'd like to make a 
Christmas single, a hip-hop version of the Bing Crosby hit ``Do You 
Hear What I Hear?'' Diggs learned it in the choir at Curtis High School 
on Staten Island, before he was thrown out of the group. And next 
spring comes the RZA's solo album, tentatively called ``The Cure,'' 
which comes from a persona different from Diggs' Bobby Digital character. 
``Bobby tends more to his lower nature, whereas RZA tends to his higher 
nature,'' Diggs said. ``But I couldn't do the RZA album until I got 
this Bobby Digital out of me. I couldn't let the RZA speak without 
showing that I spoke from life. And while I was doing the music, I 
figured I might as well do the film.'' Diggs met only indifference 
when he approached movie studios for financing. ``I'd been thinking 
about doing it for two to three years, but I always was told, `You 
don't want to spend your own money,''' he said. ``They had me scared. 
I've been going to Hollywood to see what the movie world had to offer, 
but everybody was saying, `You need a script.' ``I've got a phat idea, 
but I ain't got no time to write a script. And I don't need no script. 
Just give me the money, and I'll show you what I can do. I'm a good 
investment. Anybody who invested into us in our time, they gained. 
How many people can say that in business, period?'' Eventually, Diggs 
decided to follow the lead of the New Orleans gangsta rapper and movie 
maker Master P, who has built an empire on rap albums and homemade, 
direct-to-video movies. ``Master P gave me the freedom. He proved 
that it could be done and it could be profitable,'' Diggs said. With 
$800,000 of his own money, Diggs made ``Bobby Digital.'' He was the 
star and the director. He used the advice he got from directors like 
Warren Beatty (who used some of the RZA's music for ``Bulworth'') 
and the action-movie master John Woo; he also came up with a wish 
list for new technology, like camera lenses that allow the actor to 
see his own reflection, along the lines of mirrored sunglasses. The 
film is based on a one-page plot outline and a lot of improvisation. 
``Whoever was there that wanted to get into a scene, he was in the 
scene,'' Diggs said. In the movie, Bobby Digital is a Don Juan and 
a street fighter. ``A lot of kids in my age and generation, we grew 
up on comic books, movies, video games, the arcades and hip-hop,'' 
Diggs said. ``That's who this guy Bobby Digital is. He's like a comic 
hero from the early 1970s, and a mack like the guys that kept the 
women in the blaxploitation films. ``At the same time, the kung-fu 
martial arts are in it, and the present-day street mentality is part 
of it. And it has the surreal, as well as the future, whether it's 
the prophesized idea of the future or the imaginary idea of the future. 
It's all incorporated.'' Behind its action, Diggs said, the movie 
also sets out to de-escalate street violence from gunplay to martial-arts 
fisticuffs. ``Gunplay ain't the way,'' he said. ``The situation ain't 
that damn serious that you got to kill someone. Most of the cases 
that you've got in these courtrooms is something that could have been 
handled with a smack in the face, maybe. But to actually go ahead 
and take this guy off the planet for something that has no value, 
that's not right.'' The RZA always keeps a keyboard nearby. He has 
17 of them scattered around his house on Staten Island, and he had 
brought one to the hotel for the night. He turned it on and put in 
a computer disk, and out came one of the hundreds of musical tracks 
he has stockpiled: instant Wu-Tang. ``I could make beats all day,'' 
he said. He stopped when he found a track with a hopping, stuttering 
bass line, answered by the plink of a piano. ``They're whispering 
to each other,'' he said. Then, unexpectedly, the bass slid downward. 
``When you're rhyming, that part makes you go crazy,'' he said with 
a smile. ``I could write to that one.'' Diggs started improvising 
lyrics above the bass line. ``You can't rhyme without design,'' he 
declaimed. ``When I speak my dialect, that's the craziest wreck, make 
your whole body get upset. You catch the bass, we make tapes, there's 
no escape, a Wu-Tang masterpiece tape.'' He switched off the keyboard. 
``I'm just freestyling, catching thoughts,'' he said. ``I'm trying 
to catch something right now.''
