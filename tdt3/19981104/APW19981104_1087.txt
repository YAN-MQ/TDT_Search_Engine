A car sped onto Red Square on Wednesday and exploded just outside 
the main gate to the Kremlin, injuring three guards and the driver, 
authorities said. The cause of the blast was not immediately known. 
Initial reports said one person was killed inside the car, but a spokesman 
for the presidential press service said no one had died. The car exploded 
shortly after 7 p.m. (1600 GMT), a few meters (yards) outside the 
Spassky Gate, the main entrance to the Kremlin. The walled enclosure 
has been Russia's governmental and spiritual center for centuries. 
Clouds of smoke could be seen drifting over St. Basil's Cathedral, 
a few meters (yards) away. Officials inside the Kremlin said they 
could feel the concussion from the blast. The Kremlin spokesman, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said the car had driven very fast toward 
Red Square, past the famous GUM department store. It knocked down 
fences, drove across the square and approached the gate at the foot 
of Spassky Tower, a large red clock tower that is one of Russia's 
most distinctive symbols. The driver, a journalist for a nationalist 
magazine, jumped out just before the car, a cheap, Russian-built Moskvich, 
exploded, the official said. The blast was reported to have had the 
force of 6 kilograms (13 pounds) of dynamite. Two Kremlin guards, 
one presidential guard and the driver were injured. The gate was also 
slightly damaged. Russian television showed an unidentified bloodied 
body lying near the charred car on the square's stone slope. The driver 
was identified as Ivan Orlov, a 65-year-old journalist for the magazine 
``Russian Pravda'' from the Moscow suburb of Podolsk, the Interfax 
news agency reported. He was taken to the hospital to treat minor 
scratches, where he was being questioned by police, who said he would 
undergo a psychiatric examination, Interfax said. It also quoted police 
as saying the driver had a gas pistol in his car. Reporting on the 
incident was sketchy, and the entire area surrounding the blast was 
sealed off to the press and public. The Federal Security Service, 
the main successor agency to the Soviet KGB, said it was investigating 
the incident and had not ruled out terrorism as a motive, Interfax 
said. President Boris Yeltsin has his office at the Kremlin, but has 
been in the southern resort city of Sochi recovering from what has 
been described as exhaustion. Kremlin officials said the doors to 
the gate have been closed for years, and expressed assurance that 
the car could not have broken through them.
