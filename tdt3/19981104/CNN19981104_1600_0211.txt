Momentum didn't help George bush six years ago, but it's clearly on 
the side of the former president's two sons. In his second try for 
the office, Jeb bush won the governor's office in florida. And in 
Texas, his brother, George W. bush, was easily re-elected to another 
term as governor. Bush says his compassionate conservatism appealed 
to traditional republicans and a coalition of Hispanic voters. I was 
very grateful for the size of the win and honored to lead a ticket 
that swept. We've got good republicans elected to statewide offices. 
It was a big night for politics. It was a better night for Texas, 
in my opinion.
