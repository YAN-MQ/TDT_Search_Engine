Australia will resist any attempt to restore trade barriers as a quick 
fix for the region's economic crisis at next week's Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Foreign Minister Alexander 
Downer said Wednesday. In a speech to the Sydney Stock Exchange, Downer 
also said the Monica Lewinsky affair was distracting the United States 
from a role as a regional leader in Asia. ``We have through example 
been showing the region, and the world, that commitment to economic 
reform and liberalization can help a country withstand serious economic 
shocks,'' Downer said. ``Our ability to avoid the worst of the economic 
trends in our region and be in a position to offer our neighbors a 
helping hand is proof enough of that.'' Downer denounced those who 
blamed the Asian financial crisis on moves to free up trade in the 
region. ``It is not the liberal market economy which has failed: it 
is the lack of liberalism, including some political liberalism, which 
has caused failure,'' Downer said. ``Economies which are not transparent 
... which lack effective prudential supervision, or in a phrase, are 
run poorly, will over time fail to prosper.'' Downer warned Asia and 
Pacific leaders not to use the crisis as an excuse to halt moves toward 
trade liberalization. ``Australia will go to the APEC meetings next 
week determined to resist the illusory quick fix of a reimposition 
of trade barriers,'' he said. Downer said the United States has been 
diverted during the crisis by the Monica Lewinsky affair. ``For Australia's 
part, we are keen to see United States involvement and influence in 
East Asian affairs continue.'' Downer said the economic outlook for 
the region was sober for the next 18 months, with developments in 
Japan, the United States and the European Union likely to be critical. 
He said some recovery was likely in 1999, but it would not be uniform 
across the region, and the long-term outlook was very uncertain. ``Strategically, 
the stability and security of our region remain fluid and unsettled,'' 
he said. ``The possibility of prolonged economic and political instability 
in some of our neighbors must remain a concern.''
