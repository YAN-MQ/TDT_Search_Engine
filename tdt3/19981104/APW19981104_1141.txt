DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen lobbied Gulf 
states Wednesday for support of possible military action against Iraq 
but _ at least publicly _ he appeared to be winning little backing. 
Cohen arrived in Qatar after visiting Bahrain and Kuwait earlier Wednesday. 
U.S. officials and the local governments did not release any details 
of his hurriedly-arranged tour that began with Saudi Arabia late Tuesday. 
Cohen is expected to spend the night in Qatar and go to Egypt Thursday 
for talks with President Hosni Mubarak later in the day. He is likely 
to stop briefly in the United Arab Emirates en route to Egypt. In 
Qatar, Cohen met with the emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, 
and Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani. They discussed the 
recent developments in the Iraq-U.N. crisis, Egypt's Middle East News 
Agency said without elaborating. The United States and Britain have 
not ruled out military strikes on Iraq to retaliate for its Saturday 
decision to end cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. The U.N. 
Security Council has condemned the Iraqi decision and is now debating 
what action to take. In Baghdad, an information ministry spokesman 
Wednesday reiterated comments by Iraqi leaders that U.S. threats will 
not force Iraq to rescind its decision. ``The Iraqi people shall not 
be terrified by American threats,'' the official Iraqi News Agency 
quoted the unnamed spokesman as saying.
