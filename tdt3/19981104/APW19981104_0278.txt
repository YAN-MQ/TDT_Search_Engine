The Commerce Ministry said Wednesday that business closures in crisis-stricken 
Thailand in this year's first 10 months were up 35.5 percent over 
the same period last year, a total of 10,175 companies. The closures 
were a stark indication of the damage wrought to the Thai economy 
since last year's flotation of the currency, the baht, triggered a 
regional economic meltdown and sent the country into its worst recession 
in decades. The ministry said that of the total, 9,502 companies voluntarily 
shut their operations. Another 50 companies went bankrupt between 
January and October, and 623 had their trade registration removed 
from records after having suspended operations for several years. 
Thai officials say the economy has not yet hit rock-bottom, though 
the currency and stock markets have recently strengthened. The economy 
is still expected to shrink 7 percent this year. An estimated 1.5 
million Thais have lost their jobs.
