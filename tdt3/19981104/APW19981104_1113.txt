A waterlogged pitch at the Arnold Schwarzenegger stadium and driving 
rain forced Swedish referee Karl-Erik Nilsson to postpone Wednesday's 
Champions League match between Sturm Graz and Real Madrid. The Group 
C match will be replayed Thursday, with the kickoff set for 8.45 p.m. 
(1945 GMT). ``It's too bad for the fans, but it was a correct decision 
by the referee,'' said Graz chairman Hannes Kartnig. Real officials 
agreed. ``The decision is fine, there is no reason for discussion,'' 
said Real board member Manuel Fernandes. The only problem for Real 
was to find a new hotel. The team checked out of its hotel before 
leaving for the stadium because it was planning to return home right 
after the match. Real Madrid has two wins and one loss, while Graz 
has lost all three group matches so far.
