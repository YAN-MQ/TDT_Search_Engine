The United Nations and Iraq have locked horns again over weapons inspections. 
But this time, the posturing, from both sides, seems to be a little 
different. Ben Wedeman reports. The message of the demonstration was 
clear, even if the banners didn't always make sense in English. United 
Nations weapons inspectors, accused of acting as spies for the United 
States, must go, and international sanctions imposed on Iraq lifted. 
And no demonstration in Baghdad is complete without full-throated 
expressions of loyalty to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. But the 
crisis seemed a world away from the French pavilion at Baghdad's international 
trade fair. Before the gulf war, France was Iraq's biggest trading 
partner. More companies, and countries, are participating in this 
year's trade fair than at any time since the war. It is a matter of 
presence, to just show our interest for the Iraqi market. Visiting 
the exhibit, Iraq's trade minister appeared to be confident of his 
country's ability to weather another crisis over U.N. arms inspections. 
Politically and economically, is stronger than last year. And there 
is international support for Iraq compared to last year and years 
before. While the current crisis was sparked by Iraq's announcement 
that it would halt cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, UNSCOM 
personnel went out Wednesday to service monitoring equipment. Meanwhile, 
U.S. defense secretary William Cohen toured the gulf, gauging the 
level of support for possible air strikes against Iraq. Earlier this 
year, the United States reacted promptly to Iraqi defiance, deploying 
a massive air and naval force in the gulf. But this time around, the 
U.S. reaction has been more low-key, creating the impression among 
some here that Washington has lost the will to stand up to President 
Saddam Hussein. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Baghdad.
