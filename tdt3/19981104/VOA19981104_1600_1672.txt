The American television program, "Home Again" shows viewers how to 
make home repairs and renovations. Well, next year, the series will 
be spending a lot of time at a place that is no ordinary home. Program 
host Bob Villa plans to feature the Governors mansion of the state 
of Virginia, designed by Thomas Jefferson. Now there is a project. 
I'll say. A $5 million renovation project, as a matter of fact, is 
planned for the mansion which is located in the city of Richmond. 
The work at the house is expected to begin in April, 1999, and last 
about six months. The Virginia Governor and his family will live someplace 
else while the work is going on.
