French officials say that no damage was done to NATO operations by 
a French Army officer arrested last week for allegedly spying for 
Belgrade. French Foreign Minister Uber Badrine said the case of Major 
Pierre Bunell will not harm France's ties with NATO. He called the 
matter extremely regrettable. French authorities arrested Major Bunell 
Saturday on suspicion of supplying Belgrade with information on planned 
NATO airstrikes during the October standoff over Kosovo. A Yugoslav 
embassy official in Brussels, today, denied radio reports that he 
received sensitive NATO documents on the Kosovo crisis from the French 
officer. The official told the French news agency that he never knew 
Pierre Bunell. It was the second incident this year involving a French 
officer, allegedly NATO plans in the former Yugoslavia.
