Britain's highest court opened a hearing today, to determine whether 
former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet should be extradited to 
Spain or face genocide charges. Judges, representing the House of 
Lords, are not expected to rule immediately after the hearing. British 
prosecutors are appealing a ruling by a London court last week, declaring 
the arrest of Mr. Pinochet illegal. The court ruled that he can not 
be extradited because he is entitled to diplomatic immunity as a former 
head of state. Prosecutors argue that diplomatic immunity does not 
apply to the crimes of genocide, torture, and terrorism. Spanish judges 
want the 82-year-old Mr. Pinochet sent to Spain, to face charges of 
crimes against humanity during his 17 years as Chile's ruler. General 
Pinochet remains under police guard in London, pending the outcome 
of the prosecution's appeal.
