In Nicaragua in the weak of hurricane Mitch and only 20 miles from 
the site of a massive mudslide that buried up to 2,000 people last 
week, a volcano has erupted and geological officials warn the eruptions 
could get worse. The U.S. is helping to air lift supplies to parts 
of that country buried by the mudslides, washed away by severe flooding. 
In all, Andrea Mitchell has killed at least 8500 people. But amid 
all the suffering a Honduran woman washed out to see for six days 
found alive and taken on board a British ship.
