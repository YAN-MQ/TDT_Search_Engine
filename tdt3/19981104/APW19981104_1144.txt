Bands of armed militants raided a city in northern Tajikistan on Wednesday, 
battling government troops and seizing several buildings in heavy 
fighting. At least 10 government soldiers were killed, said Zafar 
Saidov, spokesman for President Emomali Rakhmonov. The attackers took 
about 30 police officers hostage, but they were later released when 
government troops stormed a municipal office where they were being 
held, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Late in the day, the Interior 
Ministry reported that a portion of the elite Presidential Guards 
had surrendered to the rebels. The rebels were reported to be meeting 
with local Tajik leaders to discuss terms for ending the fighting. 
Despite a 1997 peace agreement that formally ended a civil war, the 
former Soviet republic continues to be plagued by outbursts of violence 
involving groups that do not recognize the deal. The assailants seized 
all administrative buildings in the city of Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers 
(125 miles) north of the capital, Dushanbe. They also took control 
of the city airport, Saidov said. A rebel leader told ITAR-Tass that 
his forces also controlled the only major road from the capital to 
the northern region. Phone lines were down throughout the area of 
the fighting. It was unclear how they were cut off. U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan condemned the rebel attacks and urged both sides to find 
a peaceful solution, his spokesman, Fred Eckhard, was quoted by ITAR-Tass 
as saying. The National, pickup 6th pvs
