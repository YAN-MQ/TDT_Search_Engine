Thailand ran a trade surplus with the United States of dlrs 3.3 billion 
in the year to July 31, mainly due to increased agricultural and food 
product exports, a U.S. government agency said Wednesday. The U.S. 
Information Service said Thailand exported more goods to the United 
States than any other country in the first seven months of this year, 
with total trade between the two countries totaling dlrs 10.5 billion. 
The figures were released in the context of Thai media criticism of 
U.S. poultry exports to Thailand, which is itself a major exporter 
of poultry, especially frozen chicken. The U.S. agency said the United 
States imported dlrs 1.47 billion worth of Thai agricultural, food, 
forest and fishery products, an increase of more than 6 percent from 
a year earlier. It added that Thailand imported dlrs 289 million of 
U.S. agricultural products, down 24 percent from the year-ago period. 
The United States would normally take close to 20 percent of total 
annual Thai exports, but would take around 22 percent this year.
