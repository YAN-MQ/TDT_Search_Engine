There has been an explosion at the main entrance to the Kremlin in 
Moscow. The interior ministry says a man drove his car across Red 
Square at high speed knocking down barriers. He jumped from it moments 
before it exploded in front of the gates. He was taken to the hospital, 
as were three guards. The man was later identified as Ivan Orlov, 
a 65-year-old journalist. Police say the man belongs to a little known 
nationalist group.
