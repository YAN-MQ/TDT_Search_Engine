The election cheered Democrats who feared major losses across the 
country, but Republicans still have something to celebrate. The voting 
solidified Republican domination of an entire region. NPR's Howard 
Berkes reports from Salt Lake City. Republicans won two formerly Democratic 
governor seats I Colorado and Nevada, joining winning Republicans 
in Arizona, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Idaho. Add sitting governors 
in Utah and Montana, and that puts Republicans in charge in every 
state house in the interior West. All the region's governors were 
Democrats just 15 years ago. Republicans also bolstered control of 
the region's state legislatures. Six out of eight are Republican-dominated. 
And despite gains for western Democrats in Congress, 31 of the region's 
40 Senate and House seats are still Republican. Some analysts say 
the interior West is now more deeply conservative than the South and 
more dominated by a single party than any region ever. I'm Howard 
Berkes, NPR News, Salt Lake City.
