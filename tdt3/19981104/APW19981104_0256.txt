Peruvian novelist Alfredo Bryce Echenique has been awarded Spain's 
National Narrative Prize for his latest book 'Reo de Nocturnidad '(Nocturnal 
Prisoner). Describing the award as a ``golden touch'' to end his stay 
in Spain, Bryce Echenique was announced the winner of the prize Tuesday. 
Awarded annually by the Culture Ministry, the prize carries a cash 
gift of 2.5 million pesetas (dlrs 180,000) which the 59-year-old writer 
told reporters he would use to pay off debts. Bryce Echenique, who 
was born in Lima, Peru, but also possesses Spanish nationality since 
1988, said his book `Reo de Nocturnidad' deals with advantages and 
disadvantages of insomnia in the relationship between a man and a 
woman. The novel was published last year. The author, who has spent 
the last three decades living between Peru, France and, most recently, 
Spain, plans to return to Lima early next year to live. The National 
Narrative Prize is awarded to works written in any of Spain's four 
official languages, Castilian Spanish, Basque, Catalan or Galician.
