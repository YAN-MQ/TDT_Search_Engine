After intensive efforts by Washington to resolve a dispute over when 
the Palestinians will arrest 30 people wanted by Israel, Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu will present the withdrawal agreement he reached 
last month with Yasser Arafat to the Israeli Cabinet on Thursday morning, 
American officials said Wednesday. Netanyahu has been delaying a Cabinet 
meeting to approve the deal, which was reached at talks with President 
Clinton at Wye River, Md., and was supposed to have taken effect two 
days ago. Israeli officials insisted that the Palestinians first had 
to put in writing a list of the 30 people whom they agreed to arrest 
and a timetable for doing so. Those sought, including at least 12 
Palestinian police officers, are wanted on charges of involvement 
in the deaths of Israelis. At Wye the Israelis agreed to forgo extradition 
if the Palestinians arrested the suspects, with the Central Intelligence 
Agency monitoring their detention. An oral agreement specified that 
the 30 be arrested in three phases over 12 weeks, corresponding to 
the phases of the Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent 
of the West Bank. The withdrawal is conditional on specific Palestinian 
steps to fight terrorism. Arafat said Wednesday in Madrid that 12 
of the 30 had been arrested. ``We have detained 12 of them'' the Palestinian 
leader said. ``They have committed terrorist acts. We will continue 
to pursue the others.'' Israeli officials also said some of the suspects 
had been detained. American officials said they had no reason to doubt 
Arafat's statement but could not confirm it. Netanyahu, to better 
defend the agreement before his Cabinet and his angry right wing, 
has tried to have every ``gray area'' in the agreement ``turned into 
black and white,'' an American official said Wednesday, no matter 
how embarrassing that may be to Arafat. ``Things are moving in the 
right direction,'' the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said 
Wednesday evening. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ``has been 
working intensively on this in recent days, and we're hopeful that 
clarifications will yield a decision to bring this to the Cabinet 
tomorrow, and the agreement will move forward.'' Other American officials 
said Netanyahu was forcing into the public arena matters that both 
sides had agreed to keep private and noted that the published agreement 
does not mention any timetable for prisoner arrests, which the Americans 
are supposed to guarantee, anyway. ``The sensitivity of these security 
matters doesn't lend itself to public discussion,'' an official said 
carefully. ``We recognize the need to publicize and crystallize certain 
issues to win over certain people who might be on the fence. But the 
United States has an obligation to keep private what should be private 
and not interfere with the arrest of people who should be arrested.'' 
That comment was understood to be a reference to the publication in 
an Israeli newspaper of the list of 30 suspects, a move that will 
make their arrest considerably more difficult. Another American official 
noted that Arafat is facing his own domestic threats from radical 
Islamic groups that oppose any accommodation with Israel. The American 
role, in drafting the Wye agreement and nursing it, is extraordinary. 
Albright has made constant telephone calls on this latest ``bump in 
the road,'' as Rubin called it Wednesday, and all her senior officials 
who work on the Middle East have been deeply involved. ``It's total 
dependency,'' said one exasperated American official. But unlike the 
Hebron agreement in January 1997, when the Americans did not pay as 
much attention to its effectiveness and the deal was derailed by Israeli 
settlers, the Wye accord directly involves American officials in carrying 
it out. A senior Israeli official said Netanyahu had been hesitant 
to present the Wye agreement to the Cabinet because he feared that 
the Palestinians would evade their obligations to arrest the fugitives. 
``This is like a real estate deal,'' the official said. ``He wants 
the money in the bank before turning over any land, and not any promissory 
notes. He can't accept it if it's another promise that `the check 
is in the mail.' If he starts with that now, then the whole system 
of Palestinian promises goes down the drain.''
