What was evidently a car bomb exploded just outside the Kremlin Wednesday 
evening, wounding three security guards and the driver and rattling 
windows in Russia's traditional seat of power. Police cut off the 
car, a small Russian-made Moskvich, after it sped past the GUM department 
store and across the cobblestones of Red Square toward the Spassky 
Gates, which top officials use to enter the Kremlin under its distinctive 
red clock tower. Authorities described the force of the explosion 
as equal to 13 pounds of TNT. The site was cordoned off by security 
guards, but Russian television showed smoke wafting around the onion 
domes of St. Basil's Cathedral in Red Square, just outside the Kremlin. 
The driver, who jumped out of the car before it exploded, is being 
questioned in a Moscow hospital. A police official said the driver's 
documents identified him as Ivan Orlov, a correspondent for an obscure 
nationalist magazine called Russian Truth. The car reportedly carried 
other passengers, but they were not identified. One of the wounded 
security guards was said to be in serious condition. President Boris 
Yeltsin, whose office is inside the Kremlin, was away recuperating 
from illness.
