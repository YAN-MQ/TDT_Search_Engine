Communists and their hardline allies in the Russian parliament's lower 
house joined ranks Wednesday to defend a Communist lawmaker who made 
anti-Semitic comments during public rallies last month. Several liberal 
lawmakers proposed a resolution condemning the remarks by retired 
Gen. Albert Makashov as provoking an ``increased tension in relations 
between ethnic different groups.'' Communists and ultranationalists 
spoke out against the resolution and expressed support for Makashov. 
``The Russian people have suffered most, and such remarks are a reaction 
to that fact,'' ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said during 
the debates. ``If the Russian people are satisfied, all others will 
lead a happy life.'' Makashov refused to apologize. Only 107 lawmakers 
in the 450-seat house supported the resolution. Last month, Russian 
prosecutors opened an inquiry into statements made by Makashov and 
other hardliners and warned they might face criminal charges. Such 
a move is bound to fail since Makashov has immunity from prosecution 
as a lawmaker, and Communists and their allies are certain to block 
any attempt to lift his immunity.
