The Philippine government expects the economy to expand in this year's 
first nine months as strong growth in services offsets heavy rain's 
harm to agricultural production in the third quarter, a finance official 
said Wednesday. For the third quarter, government economic planners 
are predicting a gross national product growth of at least 0.3 percent, 
the official said. This would bring the average GNP growth for the 
first nine months of the year to at least 0.5 percent. GNP grew 2.0 
percent in the first quarter, but shrank 0.7 percent in the second 
quarter, the first time a contraction was recorded in five years. 
The official data are expected to be released at the end of the month. 
The economic growth would set the Philippines apart from many of its 
neighbors in Southeast Asia, which have seen their economies fall 
into recession as a result of the region's financial crisis. Services 
growth is traditionally stronger in the Philippines in the second 
half of the year because of increased activity ahead of the Christmas 
holiday. ``We are expecting services growth to be strong enough to 
counter the negative impact of poor agricultural growth,'' said the 
finance official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Although the 
Agriculture Department has said farm output may grow by up to 2 percent 
this year, its says it will most likely contract because of expected 
heavy rains in the remainder of the year. The department has estimated 
that agricultural production in the third quarter contracted by between 
1 and 4 percent. The finance official said the GNP growth estimates 
were among projections submitted by the Philippine government to an 
International Monetary Fund mission that is in Manila to assess the 
country's economic performance. The mission, which arrived Tuesday, 
is expected to complete by Nov. 17 an assessment that will be the 
basis for the release of additional funds from the IMF. On Wednesday, 
the Philippine Central Bank received a dlrs 280 million loan from 
the IMF that was added to its foreign currency reserves. At the end 
of September, the central bank's reserves stood at dlrs 10.6 billion. 
The loan is part of an estimated dlrs 1.3 billion standby credit arrangement 
previously agreed to by the IMF and the Philippines. The money is 
meant to be used by the central bank as a war chest to repel extreme 
speculative attacks on the peso.
