About halfway through last evening, it was clear that just about everybody 
was going to be wrong, just about every recent prediction had the 
G.O.P. picking up big gains, going home when the night was over with 
a lot of new seats. Here now what was sposed to happen last night. 
What your number predictions for the house and Senate Senate plus 
2, republicans, house, plus 7 which would put the democrats be low 
200 seats. Harrison? I thinkhe republicans are going to hold the democrats 
under 200 seats in the house. I ink it will be one or two Senate seat 
loss for the democrats. One to three in the Senate, four to eight 
for the republicans. I think we'll probably win 8 to 12 seats in the 
house. I think what you'll find is we'll win the close seats because 
I think democrats are discouraged to a degree. At the end of this 
election, it will be three elections in a row where republicans have 
won the popular vote. Republicans gain how many seats in the Senate 
and how many in the house? One or two in the Senate and single digits 
in the house. Two or three in the Senate. Ien the house could go anywhere 
to the republicans picng up five or six. I think they could get 15. 
Think they might be undertoe against Clinton in the midst R. I'm putting 
it on the error, three in the Senate and five in the house. How many 
seats will be republican pick up? We will pick uhm 12 and go to 240. 
Wrong.
