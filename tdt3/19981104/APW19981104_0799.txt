Hundreds of opposition party students demonstrated Wednesday against 
a decision by the Cairo University to exclude them from students union 
elections, police said. University officials who vet candidates have 
disqualified many students of opposition parties for political reasons. 
Police officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said 
the students shouting anti-government slogans demanded their representatives 
be allowed to run for the elections. The protesters were supporters 
of the banned fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood and several legal 
opposition parties, they said. They said anti-riot police surrounded 
the university and prevented the students from spreading out to nearby 
neighborhoods to stage protests. Union elections are supposed to be 
open to students of all political affiliation but officials usually 
support members of the governing National Democratic Party.
