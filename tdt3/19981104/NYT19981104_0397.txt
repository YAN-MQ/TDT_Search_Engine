As a brilliant but troubled 17-year-old, a scholarship student at 
the privileged St. Paul's preparatory school whose father had died 
when she was 8, Rosemary Mahoney read the memoirs of Lillian Hellman 
and was overwhelmed. ``She lived her life; I merely walked along beside 
mine, keeping an eye on it, reining it in,'' Ms. Mahoney writes in 
her own riveting memoir, ``A Likely Story: One Summer With Lillian 
Hellman.'' ``When Hellman wrote about her smallest experiences,'' 
she remarks, ``they had the feel of epic adventures with epiphanic 
endings. ... She was brave and strong and full of noble ideals. ... 
And when she wrote in `An Unfinished Woman' that she was `overproud, 
oversensitive, overdaring' because she was shy and frightened, I wanted 
to see her, have a look at her, and let her have a look at me, for 
surely she would recognize similar traits in me.'' So Ms. Mahoney 
wrote to Hellman, asking whether she could work for her at her summer 
home on Martha's Vineyard ``in some capacity.'' When to her amazement 
Hellman wrote back offering her a job as a part-time live-in housekeeper 
for the summer, Ms. Mahoney imagined that they ``would become great 
friends.'' She adds, ``I felt that this meeting with Lillian Hellman 
was a natural step in my destiny, proof that I was, as I sometimes 
dared to suspect in the darkness and safety of my bed, special.'' 
But over that summer of 1978, her experiences were such that six years 
later, when she was helping to renovate an apartment and she literally 
stepped on the headline announcing Hellman's death, she was prompted 
to write, ``Seeing those words was like discovering that the cool, 
slippery object you've crushed beneath your bare foot in the garden 
is a large pus-colored slug.'' She heard herself mutter, ``Thank God.'' 
She writes: ``Lillian Hellman was good and dead. I clapped my dirty 
hands and made cracks about the pieties that were sure to be scattered 
about her funeral.'' What had gone so wrong between them? On the evidence 
of Ms. Mahoney's endlessly fascinating book, practically everything. 
The job she had pictured vaguely as a part-time companion and assistant 
turned out to be a full-time combination of chauffeur, housekeeper, 
valet, butler, messenger, kitchen girl, answering service and laundress. 
In short, Hellman's servant. Looking for someone to replace her own 
adored mother, who had been sliding deeper into alcoholism ever since 
her husband's death, Ms. Mahoney found instead a frightened, partially 
blind 73-year-old woman wholly preoccupied with her own decline. On 
top of being disappointed in the sight of Hellman up close, Ms. Mahoney 
was too wrapped up in herself to understand other people's interests. 
(For instance, she writes of the ritual Hellman and her friends made 
of preparing food, ``Cooking did not strike me as a useful activity, 
but these people were mad for it.'') Moreover, Ms. Mahoney failed 
to understand an older generation that simply did not believe in fraternizing 
with the help. (Curiously, among all of Hellman's celebrity guests 
that summer, among them William and Rose Styron, John and Barbara 
Hersey, Mike Nichols, Carly Simon and James Taylor, only Joseph Alsop, 
the aristocratic newspaper columnist, treated Ms. Mahoney as an equal, 
even going so far as to serve her coffee at breakfast.) But most of 
all, Ms. Mahoney learned an essential lesson. As she herself puts 
it after reading pages her employer had discarded from a defense she 
was writing against those who had said she was dishonest in ``Scoundrel 
Time,'' her memoir of the McCarthy era: ``There was more than one 
version to the world. What people stood for wasn't necessarily what 
they were.'' If Hellman was noble in her books, Ms. Mahoney found 
her petty in person; if she seemed brave, she was actually fearful; 
if generous, then grasping; if large, small. Unluckily for her subject, 
Ms. Mahoney kept her anger at a boil, her sharp eye peeled and her 
journal always at hand to be filled. Her memoir is overwritten here 
and there, with too many similes piled up; but when tasted one sentence 
at a time, her descriptions of Hellman can be deadly. ``The lunch 
and heat had made her sleepy. Her face looked immovable and slightly 
sinister, the big beaky face of a sea turtle at rest on the ocean 
floor, dreaming and digesting, with one dyspeptic eye half open in 
a sluggish scan for predators and perhaps more food.'' By turns hilarious 
and infuriating, Ms. Mahoney's sketches of Hellman add up to a portrait 
of a small-minded tyrant who, when she wasn't ignoring Ms. Mahoney, 
was subtly putting her down. Hellman's typical tactic was to accuse 
Ms. Mahoney of something she hadn't done, like failing to rinse a 
bowl or eating all the tomatoes in the refrigerator. Then if Ms. Mahoney 
defended herself, she would be accused of being argumentative. Each 
such incident was tiny in significance but their cumulative weight 
grew to be unbearably oppressive. ``Hellman was like a dark sky coming 
closer and closer to the ground, pressing me down,'' Ms. Mahoney writes. 
``The less she seemed to see me, the more she pressed me. I walked 
with my head down. She always had the final word.'' Worse, Ms. Mahoney 
could not stop being respectful, even affectionate at times. The contrast 
with what she had hoped for in the way of friendship made her burn 
with shame. Eventually the summer ended. She escaped, finished her 
schooling, went on to write two well-received books, ``The Early Arrival 
of Dreams,'' about a year she spent teaching English in China, and 
``Whoredom in Kimmage,'' a portrait of rural Irish pub life. But she 
has clearly worn her summer experience with Hellman like, as she puts 
it, ``a scab that wanted picking.'' She has written with a vehemence 
that stings on every page. In the end, ``A Likely Story'' may simply 
prove the old adage that no man is a hero to his valet. But it was 
Hellman's self-destructive misjudgment to hire a valet with a fierce 
sense of morality, an exquisite eye for detail, a sharp eye for character, 
a fanciful way with words and a long memory. And Ms. Mahoney's willingness 
to share blame for the misalliance makes her portrait all the more 
absorbing and damning. PUBLICATION NOTES: `A LIKELY STORY: ONE SUMMER
