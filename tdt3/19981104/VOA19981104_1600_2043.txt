Britain's highest court is debating whether to allow the extradition 
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face genocide 
charges. The hearing which is expected to last two days, comes a week 
after a lower court ruled that the general had diplomatic immunity 
from arrest and extradition. Prosecutors are arguing diplomatic immunity 
does not apply to genocide. The general is under guard at a London 
hospital, but he would be free to leave Britain if a prosecution appeal 
fails.
