Mitch has strengthened into a tropical storm again. It's 350 miles 
southwest off the coast of Florida, moving northeast at 20 miles per 
hour. Forecasters have issued storm warnings and a flood watch for 
much of south florida and the keys. They say isolated tornadoes are 
possible later today. In central America, where Mitch struck as a 
hurricane, the death toll has now climbed to 9,000. Thousands more 
are missing. Two million people are homeless in Honduras alone after 
entire towns were wiped off the map. Flooding is still a major problem. 
Some towns are completely surrounded by water. Many bridges and roads 
have been washed out.
