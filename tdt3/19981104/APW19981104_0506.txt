Saudi Arabia is willing to accept international arbitration of its 
border dispute with Yemen, the Saudi interior minister said in an 
interview published Wednesday. Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz told Al-Siyassah 
that Riyadh was ready to settle its border dispute with Yemen through 
continuing talks or by ``resorting to international arbitration.'' 
Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian peninsula, has long contested Saudi 
Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the Empty Quarter, 
a vast desert region with potentially lucrative oil fields. Late last 
month, Eritrea returned a Red Sea island to Yemen in compliance with 
a court ruling after the two sides resorted to international arbitration.
