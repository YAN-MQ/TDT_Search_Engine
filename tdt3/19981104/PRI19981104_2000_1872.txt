Relief workers are warning famine is a very real danger in Central 
America. Thousands have already died in floods that followed Hurricane 
Mitch. And with food crops devastated, aid officials say many more 
people could go hungry in the coming weeks. Paul Bell is supervising 
the United States' relief effort. He says the devastation is staggering. 
Well, in the 35 years that I've been doing this type of work, this 
is the worst the I've ever seen in 35 years. The two poorest countries 
in Central America, more than 7,000 people probably dead. Some 10,000 
square kilometers absolutely destroyed. U.S. relief worker Paul Bell.
