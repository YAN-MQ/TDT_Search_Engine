If you're looking for a big vacation at a bargain price, you may want 
to head north of the border. Lori Waffenschmidt has that in our "working 
ahead" report. Canada is a hot travel deal, and Americans are flocking 
north in record numbers. The air fares are less expensive, and it's 
very easy to get there. It's very convenient. It's English-speaking, 
and the value is good. U.S. dollars go far in many places. Take advantage 
of a lot of city life, a lot of shopping, museums, sports activities. 
There's cities all across Canada, in addition to more rural areas, 
that provide opportunities for more active, adventure kinds of travelers. 
But hotel rooms, especially in border cities, may be harder to find. 
Occupancy levels in some cities are up as much as 8% over the prior 
year. And taxes on Canadian goods and services can add up. U.S. citizens 
can get a tax refund and have up to a year to apply. I'll bring a 
little calculator with me and figure out if I'm gonna come out ahead 
and might spend a little more money. The Canadian "loonie" may be 
a bargain for a while. I haven't seen any initiatives undertaken in 
Canada so far to change the exchange rate. It seems to be beneficial. 
The economy is also booming in Canada. So beneficial, the Canadian 
tourism commission predicts travel there will remain strong over the 
next decade. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN, reporting.
