Wall Street showed no inclination to add to its previous gains, with 
the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial was unchanged. And opens this morning 
at 8706. However it has gained 10 percent in value during the month 
of October. Frank Gretz, market analyst with Shields and Company, 
says the Dow was taking a much needed breather. What I really like 
to see about today, is even when the Dow was suffering earlier in 
the day, the average stocks, so to speak, the advance/decline numbers, 
they were still pretty positive. And we closed the day that way. In 
fact, on the over the counter market - you know you don't know for 
sure until you get the final number. But we may have been up 15 days 
in a row, now in that over the counter market, in terms of advance/decline. 
And that is a major, major change. I mean that was where the bear 
market's been for a year, and it looks like that is finally ending. 
Both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ lost ground. There was a report, yesterday, 
that the leading economic indicators in the US were unchanged in September 
for the second straight month. That's Business, I'm Les Carpenter.
