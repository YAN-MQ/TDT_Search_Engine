Siemens AG, the German electronics conglomerate that has struggled 
for years with mediocre profits, announced sweeping plans Wednesday 
to sell off businesses with combined sales of more than $10 billion. 
The move marks by far the most radical, and in many ways the most 
desperate, attempt by the Siemens chairman, Heinrich von Pierer, to 
steer the global company back toward solid profitability. In recent 
years, Siemens has come under intense criticism for sluggishness in 
restructuring to improve profits. While companies like Daimler-Benz 
and Veba AG have sold off or simply shut down marginal businesses, 
Siemens has remained timid about big changes. Until now. Among other 
things, the Munich-based giant will spin off its loss-plagued semiconductor 
business, which was battered this year by plunging prices for memory 
chips and which lost about $727 million. It will also sell off businesses 
that make copper cable, electronic components and locomotives. All 
told, the companies to be sold employ 60,000 out of Siemens' total 
work force of 416,000. Siemens also announced that it would set aside 
$2.4 billion in restructuring charges, atop $650 million it had announced 
earlier this year. Among other things, the company said it had set 
aside about $600 million for losses in Asia and other emerging markets. 
Though company executives carefully avoided the issue of layoffs, 
most analysts believe the company intends to eliminate thousands of 
jobs beyond the ones tied to businesses to be sold. At a news conference 
in Munich on Wednesday, von Pierer took issue with reports in German 
magazines that the company might shed 20,000 workers. But analysts 
said part of the big restructuring charges would almost certainly 
be used on severance payments. Wednesday's disclosures capped weeks 
of increasingly fevered speculation about Siemens' plans and quickly 
lifted the company's stock to 114.35 marks a share, up 12.75 marks. 
In the United States, the company's American depository receipts rose 
$6.50, to $68.50. ``This is a pretty major step back from the old 
belief that you have to have a huge, vertically integrated business,'' 
said Mark Davies Jones, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London. 
``Until now, restructuring has been piecemeal, selling off parts of 
business units rather than the whole units.'' At the Munich news conference, 
von Pierer said the radical overhaul would set Siemens on a path toward 
higher profits. Though von Pierer has pushed scores of reforms since 
he took over five years ago, the company continues to lag behind many 
of its competitors and frustrate its shareholders. In the last two 
years, Siemens has sold off marginal businesses in military electronics 
and dental equipment. It also announced plans last spring to abandon 
the personal-computer business. For years, Siemens has struggled to 
increase its productivity _ largely by moving much of its manufacturing 
outside of Germany _ but those efforts have been offset by increases 
in wages. None of the previous attempts at improvement came close 
to the sweep of those announced Wednesday. The biggest single move 
would be spinning off its big chip-manufacturing business into a separate 
publicly owned company. ``A company with a portfolio like Siemens' 
cannot allow itself to be in a business with such cyclical variations,'' 
von Pierer said Wednesday. For the year that ended on Sept. 30, Siemens 
said net income from continuing operations rose 2 percent, to 2.66 
billion marks, or $1.65 billion. Sales rose 10 percent, to 117.8 billion 
marks, or $71.4 billion.
