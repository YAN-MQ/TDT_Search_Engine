Defeated U.S. senator Carol Moseley-Braun says she simply couldn't 
compete with early attacks on her ethics. Braun lost her re-election 
bid to republican Peter Fitzgerald. Democrats did win the New York 
Senate race. Congressman Charles Schumer beat republican incumbent 
Alfonse D'Amato. Both had waged a nasty and expensive campaign, filled 
with personal attacks. And in North Carolina, the incumbent republican 
senator, Lauch Faircloth, was ousted by John Edwards.
