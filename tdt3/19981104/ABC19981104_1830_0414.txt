When we come back, we'll look at the races for governor. Why is governor 
bush of Texas so successful? How big a player might he be? And, the 
stunner in Minnesota. Jesse Ventura and reform politics. Raisin bran, 
huh? Uh, yeah. What's goin' on? That raisin bran has less than half 
your folic acid for the day. Even less of your zinc. That's a weenie 
breakfast, Frank. There's almost no vitamin E at all. Looks like you 
need total raisin bran. Just one bowl gives you 100% of ten important 
vitamins and minerals you need for the day. No other raisin bran comes 
close. That a boy, Frank! And there's room for my spoon. Total. Total 
raisin bran. Total corn flakes. What are you getting for breakfast?
