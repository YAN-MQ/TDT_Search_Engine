Earlier this week, the United Nations began another major immunization 
campaign against polio in north eastern Somalia. The exercise is part 
of the Kick Polio Out of Africa Campaign sponsored by the UN Children's 
Fund UNICEF, the UN World Health Organization, and various non-governmental 
organizations. From Washington, VOA's Sonny Young reports, nearly 
one million Somali children have been vaccinated in recent months. 
This is the second phase of the polio campaign. During the first phase 
in Somalia, held in August and September, organizers and observers 
alike, hailed the effort as a remarkable achievement. They said many 
Somali children were immunized, often despite insecurity and difficult 
access to their homes. Robert Kihara is a UNICEF Information Officer 
in Nairobi. During the first round of the polio immunization campaign 
from August 15th to 19th, an estimated 950,000 children below the 
age of five years received polio vaccine. Mr. Kihara told VOA, UNICEF 
is hoping to vaccinate 150,000 more Somali children during this campaign. 
He says some of the children are in very remote areas. To reach them, 
he says UNICEF will rely on various modes of transportation. In this 
effort, some 200 teams went straight out over the vast and arid territory, 
with three people per team, all using approximately 150 cars, trucks 
and in some cases boats. In the most remote areas, camels and donkeys 
are being used for this effort. While the polio immunization effort 
is supported by many African governments, Somalia has been without 
a central government since 1991, when former dictator Muhammad Siad 
Barre was ousted. Since then the country has largely been ruled by 
rival clan leaders. As a result of attacks, looting and kidnappings, 
almost all UN and other aid agencies have pulled their expatriate 
staff out of Somalia in recent months. The latest polio campaign was 
launched shortly after the release of a bleak UN report on human development 
in Somalia. It said life expectancy for Somali adults in only about 
43 years, and one quarter of all children die before age five. UNICEF 
spokesman Robert Kihara says another round of immunization will take 
place next month in Somalia, as UNICEF and other organizations try 
to eliminate polio from Africa. Sonny Young, VOA News Washington.
