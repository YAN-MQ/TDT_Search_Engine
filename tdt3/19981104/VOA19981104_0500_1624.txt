A computer center unlike most others is about to be built in Los Angeles, 
California at a public library. The center is likely to bear the name 
of a certain young actor, who became an international star in the 
movie, "Titanic". The facility will probably be called, "The Leonardo 
deCaprio Computer Center. And teenage girls everywhere will be flocking 
to it. What happened was, that deCaprio has come up with a $35,000 
donation to help pay for the computer workstations that are at the 
center. The facility is being built in a library branch in the Las 
Angeles neighborhood where he grew up. And his mother still lives 
near by, and it was she who found out that the library was trying 
to raise money to expand. She brought the matter to Leonardo's attention, 
and he coughed up the money. Bless his heart! He said, mommy, anything 
you want. The computer center is going to be built in LA, that's good 
news.
