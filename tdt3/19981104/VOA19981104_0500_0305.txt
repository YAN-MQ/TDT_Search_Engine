Democratic Party candidates faired much better in congressional races 
than pre-election polls had predicted. While falling short of attaining 
a majority, Democrats gained a handful of seats in the US House of 
Representatives. For the first time, since 1934, the party of a sitting 
president increased its number of seats in a non-presidential election 
here. House Democratic leader, Richard Gephardt called that victory 
an historic reversal.
