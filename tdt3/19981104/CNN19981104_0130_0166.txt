Democrats scored a major upset in North Carolina. Challenger John 
Edwards unseated republican senator Lauch Faircloth. More races are 
coming, and more races are coming in North Carolina. And a presidential 
race is two years from now. We absolutely cannot allow the conservative 
cause, the conservative movement that has meant so much to this nation 
to be eroded because of one or two losses. We will fight on the floor 
of the United States Senate for the things that matter to us. For 
our public school system. For reforming health care in this country 
so, that every American -- So that every American can pick their own 
doctor and make their own health care decision.
