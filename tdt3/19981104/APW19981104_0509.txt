Dutch approval of euthanasia and assisted suicide has widened to 92 
percent, but that broad support hinges on doctors' strict adherence 
to mercy killing guidelines, a study released Wednesday found. In 
this country known for its permissive euthanasia policy, only 8 percent 
of those surveyed by the NIPO polling agency said they oppose the 
practice. The telephone survey of 1,201 people aged 18 and older was 
commissioned by the Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society. No margin 
of error was given. In a similar study conducted two years ago, approval 
of euthanasia was pegged at 80 percent. Ditte Papousek, a spokeswoman 
for the euthanasia society, declined to speculate about the reasons 
behind the rise. Overwhelming support also was registered among Roman 
Catholics surveyed in the poll, with 96 percent backing euthanasia 
and assisted suicide, Papousek said. ``This underlines what we see 
as a trend that people think of euthanasia as a human right and as 
a matter of self-determination,'' she said. Although respondents were 
overwhelmingly in favor of the right to death with dignity, they made 
it clear in more detailed follow-up questions that their support came 
with a condition: Doctors must carefully follow the rules. In 1993, 
the Dutch parliament became the first in the world to allow euthanasia 
when it passed strict guidelines allowing doctors to perform the procedure. 
Those guidelines stipulate that candidates must suffer from unbearable 
and irremediable pain and must request death repeatedly and lucidly. 
Doctors must also seek a second opinion and report all euthanasia 
deaths to authorities. The Dutch draw a distinction between euthanasia, 
which usually involves doctors administering a lethal injection, and 
assisted suicide, which involves patients ending their own lives, 
most often by overdosing on drugs provided by their doctors. Although 
both remain technically illegal, doctors who follow the rules can 
expect immunity from prosecution. In the past, euthanasia cases were 
screened by public prosecutors who occasionally took doctors to court 
when they violated guidelines. Fearful of such prosecutions, many 
doctors do not report euthanasia deaths. But this week, five new panels 
made up of doctors and legal and ethic experts were introduced nationwide 
to review instances of mercy killing and determine whether any cases 
should be transferred to prosecutors. About 3,600 euthanasia cases 
were reported last year, or 3 percent of all deaths, said Papousek.
