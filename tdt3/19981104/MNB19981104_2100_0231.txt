What about the president? He wasn't on any ballot last night. He was 
on the minds of about a quarter of the voters in exit polling. Does 
a big night for his party buy him anything at all? For the view from 
the White House on all this, we're going to begin tonight with NBC's 
Claire Shipman. Brian, the president's mood was described of one of 
euphoric disbelief and vindication. But the public strategy today 
was to keep all that euphoria in check. The White House message today 
was clear, the issues are the winners in this election, not the president. 
The American people want their business and their concerns, their 
children, their families, their future addressed here. That is what 
the message was. But behind the scenes, the White House hopes the 
message republicans get is that the impeachment inquiry should be 
shortened or even dropped. Henry Hyde is expected to release a hearing 
schedule tomorrow which will suggest that the hearings be completed 
by the end of the year. If a deal to avoid hearings can be reached, 
republicans are still struggling for what they call a suitable presidential 
punishment, like censure, banning the president from the grounds of 
Congress, or taking away his retirement pension. Of those three, White 
House sources say only censure is acceptable. These election results 
won't necessarily mean a quick or easy end to the lewinsky matter. 
For example, many democrats are worried that President Clinton may 
now feel he can avoid any sort of reprimand. And sources tell us that 
Newt Gingrich's job as speaker may in fact be in jeopardy. And advisors 
here are worried if he has to fight to Hang on to that job, he may 
have to agree to push impeachment hearings even harder. Claire Shipman, 
NBC news, the White House.
