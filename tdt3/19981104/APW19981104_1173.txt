Fire broke out Wednesday in the attic of the Reggia palace at Caserta 
in southern Italy, raising fears for the sumptuous, sprawling 18th-century 
landmark. Authorities said they would have to wait until daylight 
to determine the extent of the damage. The fire was discovered late 
Wednesday and was declared under control within hours after firefighters 
were summoned from as far away as Rome. Smoke and flames were seen 
at two windows; Italy's ANSA news service quoted a firefighter as 
saying the fire had reached at least four rooms. Officials said an 
investigation would start Thursday into the cause of the fire at the 
palace, about 30 miles outside of Naples. Charles III commissioned 
the palace in 1751 to show off the might of the kingdom of Naples. 
With five floors and 1,200 rooms, it made the UNESCO list of World 
Heritage sites last year. World leaders met there in 1994 for the 
Group of Seven economic summit _ a setting that prompted Russian leader 
Boris Yeltsin to scrap his usual business suit for a tuxedo.
