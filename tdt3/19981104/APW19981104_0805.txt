A Sierra Leone high court on Wednesday convicted 15 civilians of treason 
for working with the West African nation's ousted military junta. 
In addition, former President Joseph Saidu Momoh, who headed a one-party 
state from 1985 until his ouster in 1992 and who had close ties to 
the junta, was convicted of conspiracy to commit treason. Five more 
people were found not guilty of treason and other offenses and were 
released following the mass trial. The convictions were the latest 
in a string of treason trials in this poverty-stricken country, where 
a Nigerian-led intervention force ousted the junta earlier this year 
and returned President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to power. With the Wednesday 
rulings, 43 civilians have been convicted of treason. Most face death 
by hanging. Last month, hundreds of people cheered as 24 army officers 
convicted of participating in the bloody coup that brought the junta 
to power were publicly executed. Many more suspects remain on trial 
and hundreds are languishing in prison without being charged. While 
Kabbah has been returned to power, fighting continues between Sierra 
Leonean forces and ousted junta fighters and their rebel allies. The 
rebels have killed, raped and maimed villagers as part of a brutal 
campaign against the government. They have also threatened mass killings 
in retaliation for the arrest of their leader, Foday Sankoh, and other 
rebels. Sankoh was recently sentenced to death but has appealed his 
conviction. The fifteen people convicted Wednesday face the death 
penalty while Momoh, who was found innocent of treason, faces a prison 
term. Sentences will be handed down later this week after the court 
hears pleas of mitigating circumstances.
