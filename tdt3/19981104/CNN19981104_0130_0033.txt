This is "CNN Headline News" coverage of election '98. I'm Chuck Roberts. 
It 's been a highly unusual midterm election day. Since 1934, the 
party in control of the White House has lost seats in the House of 
Representatives during off-year polling. The most was 71 seats lost, 
the least in Ronald Reagans term was five seats. This year, democrats 
seem likely to break with history and actually gain seats. That would 
be an important triumph for the party in light of the dire predictions 
about their chances following the revelations in the Monica lewinsky 
scandal. In the Senate, the parties fought to a draw, the balance 
of power will remain exactly what it was before the vote. 55 seats 
will be republican and 45 will be democratic. In Kentucky, a tight 
Senate race went to republican Jim Bunning, who defeated Scotty Baesler 
for the seat held by retiring democrat Wendell ford. Nevada's Senate 
race ended with democratic incumbent Harry Reid holding on to his 
job over republican John Ensign's challenge. In California, democrat 
Barbara boxer is going back to the Senate, having defeated her republican 
challenger, Matt fong. Peter Fitzgerald wins the Senate seat in Illinois 
over incumbent democrat carol Mosely-Braun. And in Wisconsin, campaign 
finance reformer Russ Feingold who accepted no outside campaign financing, 
wins re-election to the Senate over republican challenger Mark Neumann.
