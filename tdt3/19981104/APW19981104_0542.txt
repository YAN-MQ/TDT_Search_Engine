A senior Angolan official said Wednesday his government was waging 
an undeclared, low-intensity war against the former rebel group UNITA, 
which he accused of failing to respect the country's 1994 peace accord. 
Jorge Chicote, Angola's deputy foreign minister, said the army and 
police were engaging in clashes in rural areas of the southwest African 
country with marauding bands of UNITA guerrillas. ``There is already 
a war going on in Angola,'' Chicote said in an interview with Portuguese 
state radio Antena 1. He said UNITA never fully disbanded its army 
after signing the U.N.-brokered peace deal which ended a two-decade 
civil war between the government and rebels. The peace accord is on 
the verge of collapse. The government last month severed all contact 
with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi because he has refused to surrender 
control of his central highland strongholds to the government. UNITA 
has rearmed and in recent months has attacked outlying villages and 
towns in the vast country, according to Chicote. ``The government 
has a responsibility to ensure the security and stability of the Angolan 
people, to destroy all illegal military concentrations,'' Chicote 
said from Austria where he was attending a meeting. But a UNITA spokesman 
in Lisbon denied the claims, saying the recent skirmishes were between 
police and gangs of bandits made up of demobilized troops from both 
sides' armies. ``UNITA can't fight because it doesn't have an army 
any more,'' Rui Oliveira said in a telephone interview. Oliveira said 
the government recently attacked villages in Uige and Malanje provinces 
where the local population was loyal to UNITA and had resisted the 
imposition of government control. There has been no independent verification 
of the fighting. The United Nations, which after the peace accord 
stationed more than 7,000 troops in Angola to monitor its implementation, 
has scaled down its presence to a few hundred staff. Some 500,000 
people were killed in the war which broke out after independence from 
Portugal in 1975. A 1991 peace agreement collapsed the following year 
when UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola, rejected its defeat in the country's first 
democratic elections.
