The day after the NBA season was supposed to tip off, labor talks 
continued, but lasts less than two hours. Owners won an even 50/50 
split of revenue. The players want to keep 60% of it. I believe that 
the high-end players have now declared themselves and they decided 
that any deal that has limitations that would affect perhaps 30 to 
40 players, though the great masses are other players, is a deal that 
doesn't deserve to get done. We'll see, but that seems to have changed. 
The atmosphere in these talks since beentered last Wednesday.
