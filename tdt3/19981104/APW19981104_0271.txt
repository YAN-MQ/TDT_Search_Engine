Singaporeans will test new, more relaxed rules for public concerts 
later this month by dancing to the tunes of Latin American pop star 
Ricky Martin, a newspaper reported Wednesday. What concert-goers throughout 
the world take for granted _ dancing or standing up from their seats 
during the performance _ until recently was illegal in conservative 
Singapore. Since last month, police have relaxed rules for public 
concerts and other entertainment events, and will tolerate dancing 
in the audience as long as it isn't violent or offensive. Taking advantage 
of the new rules, promoters for Martin are selling about 700 standing 
tickets at 55 Singapore dollars (dlrs 32) each for his show on Nov. 
25. ``In the past under the old rules, it was almost impossible to 
get approval for such a thing,'' Michael Hosking of Midas Promotions 
told The Straits Times. The Puerto Rican heart-throb is best known 
for his France '98 World Cup theme song, ``The Cup of Life,'' which 
became an international hit in Spanish, English and French versions. 
Though the new rules allow performers to mingle with the crowd during 
the concert, Singaporeans should not hold their breath to take a closer 
look at Martin. ``If we let him go off the stage, we may not get him 
back,'' Hosking said.
