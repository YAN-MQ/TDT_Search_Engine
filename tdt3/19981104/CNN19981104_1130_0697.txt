You can't see it and you can't taste it. It's found in half the nation's 
drinking water and it has saved countless dental patients from the 
pain of a cavity. It's called fluoride. It's a common element found 
in the earth's crust and naturally occurs in groundwater. For the 
past 50 years, it's also been added to water supplies around the country 
as a safe and cheap method of preventing tooth decay in children and 
adults. Fluoride also is commonly added to toothpaste, mouthwash and 
vitamin supplements. Studies have shown fluoridated water cuts tooth 
decay in half. It's recommended that all family members use toothpaste 
with fluoride. Parents should supervise children when they brush to 
make sure they don't swallow excessive amounts of fluoridated toothpaste. 
Make sure you consult a dentist before using fluoride supplements.
