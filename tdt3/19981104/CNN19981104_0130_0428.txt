Wednesday, the "discovery" crew will use a 50-foot robot arm to maneuver 
the Spartan satellite around the shuttle cargo bay relying solely 
on remote camera views. They retrieved the satellite from space Tuesday. 
Tony Clark reports. Houston, we have Spartan in sight. It's one degree 
left, and one degree low. "discovery" maneuvered back to the 3,000 
pound solar imaging satellite and, carefully, astronaut Steve Robinson 
inched the shuttle's 50-foot-long robot arm toward the satellite and 
locked on to it. Got a good grapple of Spartan. Copy that. Great job, 
Steve. For two days, the satellite downlinked images as part of its 
study of solar winds and the sun's corona. Go for 31 bravo at your 
discretion. In a precise maneuver, the satellite was lowered into 
"Discovery's" payload bay. The satellite has additional solar data 
recorded onboard, which can be retrieved once the satellite is back 
on earth. Congratulations and great job on a successful Spartan rendezvous 
and retrieval and great job on the manual phase. The prop officer 
has a smile on her face. Great, Mike. Thanks a lot. While the Spartan 
retrieval was the high point of shuttle activities Tuesday, the astronauts 
also worked on experiments using oyster toadfish to study the effects 
of microgravity on astronaut's balance systems, and tests of microencapsulation 
for tumor-fighting drugs. The crew will continue to run experiments 
through Friday with the shuttle scheduled to land midday on Saturday.
