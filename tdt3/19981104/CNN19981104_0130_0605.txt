Diabetes strikes many Americans each year, but its symptoms aren't 
always immediately recognized. Holly Firfer looks at just how important 
early diagnosis can be. Feeling sluggish? Tired? Having trouble concentrating? 
You may be one of 8 million Americans who suffers from diabetes and 
doesn't know it. And surprisingly, your employer might also be suffering 
the consequences. Poor control of diabetes really drive up costs in 
two ways. One is that it causes an increase in direct medical expenditures, 
such as doctors visits, emergency room visits. And it also has the 
indirect costs which are the losses to the employer. Losses such as 
work days missed and lack of productivity. But in a new study in "the 
journal of the American medical association," researchers found people 
who do not perform well at work because of side effects of adult onset 
diabetes can change their performance dramatically. Patients who were 
optimally controlled in terms of their blood-sugar levels had better 
physical functioning, they had better vitality, better sense of well 
being and improved cognitive performance. 53-year-old Marcello pagano 
says he thought he was just getting old. I was drinking a lot -- a 
lot of water. I was going to the bathroom a lot in the middle of the 
night, and everything. And my eye sight was going and I was sluggish, 
and everything. When, in reality, he was diabetic and didn't know 
it. Controlling the blood sugar level, my eye sight has come back, 
I see perfectly well now. I don't have to get up in the middle of 
the night. I can sleep better. I'm more rested, I have a lot more 
energy. So life is much better. Diabetes is a condition in which the 
body produces little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone that allows 
sugar to be stored or used for energy. And without that energy reserve, 
diabetics can feel sluggish, tired and have a hard time concentrating. 
But adult onset diabetes, or type two, can be controlled with strict 
diet, exercise and drugs. But to get the symptoms under control, you 
must first ask your doctor to test you for diabetes. Then, according 
to the researchers, once blood-sugar levels are balanced, it may take 
just a few weeks before you're feeling like your old or young self 
again. Holly Firfer, CNN, Atlanta.
