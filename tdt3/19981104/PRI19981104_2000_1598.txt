The results of the mid-term elections certainly gave the financial 
markets a kick start. On the back of the rally on Wall Street, the 
already optimistic European bosses crawled even higher, an indication 
that some confidence is creeping back. But how far is that confidence 
driven by what happens here in the U.S. and how much of an impact 
does economic policy elsewhere have on the United States? The debate 
is on again what will happen to U.S. rates after further recent cuts 
in Europe. John Ryding is the senior economist with Basterns. I don't 
think that what happens in Europe influences interest rate policy 
in the U.S., but it certainly has the potential to influence the U.S. 
economy. The U.S. has suffered under a widening trade gap as it has 
carried the burden of leading world economic growth through this difficult 
problems. And if that burden is lessened by Europe picking up its 
share, then growth in both regions, both the United States and Europe, 
will be the stronger for it. So maybe for Americans, what matters 
is the Europeans have got a bit more spending power. It doesn't all 
fall on the U.S. consumer to buy everyone else's goods. Well, if the 
Europeans have more spending power and do a little bit more spending, 
it would certainly take some of the pressure off of the U.S. consumer 
who has to have seemed to have done a remarkable job since they're 
not spending more than all of their income and the personal savings 
rate in the United States is now in negative territory as of the month 
of September. With all of this in mind, what is happening next and 
when is it happening to U.S. rates, John? Well, I think U.S. rates 
are still coming down. I think the Fed will bring them down again 
on November 17th. And that's going to be a trend for the next few 
months. An early indication of what may happen to interest rates in 
the U.S. may come as early as tomorrow with a speech by the Federal 
Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, on international financial structure. 
For THE WORLD, I'm Patrick O'Connell in New York.
