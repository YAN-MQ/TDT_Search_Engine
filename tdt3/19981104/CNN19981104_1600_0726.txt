Today, on the cold & flu report -- vitamin C -- should you or shouldn't 
you? Scientists have been arguing for decades over whether vitamin 
C can prevent colds. Recent studies have shown that if there is any 
preventive effect, it's minor, and it only works for some people. 
However, many experts feel that while vitamin C may not prevent a 
cold, it may make symptoms less severe if you do get sick. Vitamin 
C typically comes in supplements of 500 or 1,000 milligrams and is 
considered to be free of side effects, except at very high doses. 
Then, it may cause gastrointestinal difficulties.
