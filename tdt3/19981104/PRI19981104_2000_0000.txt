This is THE WORLD, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. It's Wednesday, November 4th. I'm Lisa Mullins in 
Boston. Today, Iraq clarifies its position on what U.N. arms inspectors 
are allowed to do at suspected weapons sites. No, we have not asked 
them to leave. They are welcomed to stay but again without access 
to those sites. Also, the day after elections, we meet some of the 
world's most unusual politicians. We're going to have parliament on 
wheels. We're going to move it around the country if we're elected. 
We're going to have this turn into a Disneyland, a looney land, and 
we're going to throw crocodiles in the Thames. First, though, this 
news.
