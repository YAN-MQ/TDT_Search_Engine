When we come back, what the voter of Minnesota woke up and learned 
they had done last night. If you asked all the dermatologists listed 
here to recommend a therapeutic shampoo, neutrogena T/Gel would come 
out #1. T/Gel works on all three... itchy, flaky scalp conditions. 
Neutrogena T/Gel: ooohh! Sinus pain. So much pressure, I just can't 
focus. Mom, are you okay? Clear the pain with new tavist S inus gelcaps. 
Unlike extra strength Tylenol, it unclogs the congestion that may 
cause the sinus pain. Be clear-headed, clear through your day with 
new tavist sinus gelcaps.
