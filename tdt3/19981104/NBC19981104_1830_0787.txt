Another criminal case in New York tonight, an indictment handed up 
against accused terrorist osama bin laden. He stands adews kuzed of 
masterminding bombing of embassies in Africa. We have more tonight 
from Andrea Mitchell. The $5 million price on bin laden's head is 
the highest bounty the U.S. has ever offered for a fugitive. Also 
wanted, his top general, Mohammed atef. It's a reward to try to get 
individuals to come forward and give us information about either of 
these two individuals' whereabouts. The two are now also accused of 
targeting Americans around the world -- in Somalia, his native Saudi 
Arabia, the Philippines, even New York. And of trying to buy weapons 
of mass destruction. It is alleged that there were efforts made to 
secure chemical weapons, nuclear weapons and the components of both. 
How does bin laden do it? A secret witness from his inner circle is 
cooperating with prosecutors, as they try to penetrate his far-flung 
financial network. He uses a whole host of front companies. He uses 
charitable organizations. He uses offshore bank accounts, hidden bank 
accounts. All of which he moves and manipulates. Tonight, U.S. officials 
think bin laden is in Afghanistan, but admit they have no idea exactly 
where. So today's reward is a desperate attempt to track down the 
man known to his followers as the "prince of terror." Andrea Mitchell, 
NBC news, Washington.
