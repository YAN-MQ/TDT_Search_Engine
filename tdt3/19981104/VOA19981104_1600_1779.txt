American authorities have indicted Saudi terrorist Usama bin Laden 
and one of his top aids in connection with the deadly US bombings 
in Kenya and Tanzania. Prosecutors announced the murder charges against 
Bin Laden, and Mohammed Atiff, his military commander, in New York. 
US State Department is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information 
leading to their arrest or conviction. If convicted, each man could 
face the death penalty. The August 7th bombings killed 224 people.
