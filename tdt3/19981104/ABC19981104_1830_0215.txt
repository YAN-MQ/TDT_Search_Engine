A new Congress will convene in January. The impeachment process will 
be right there in front of it. Several republican leaders said last 
night that it was their constitutional duty to proceed. A lot of voters 
told the exit pollsters this was not the way to go. Here's ABC's Lynn 
sherr. What voters across the country had to say was, simply, enough! 
Forget about impeachment, Ms. or Mr. lawmaker, and get back to work. 
Just look at the evidence. When we asked what they thought Congress 
should do about the impeachment hearings, 39% said, go ahead, but 
58% said drop the matter. That reflects disappointment with congressional 
activity. Only 41% of the voters we surveyed said they approved of 
the way Congress is handling its job. Contrast that with the way folks 
rate the president. Mr. Clinton's performance on the job got a 55% 
approval rating. But Mr. Clinton and members of Congress, should not 
think they are free to behave badly. Mr. Clinton's personal approval 
rating was a dismal 35%. And while the Lewinsky affair itself ranked 
dead last as an issue important to voters, tied for first, along with 
education, was something voters do care about -- moral and ethical 
standards. Lynn sherr, ABC News, New York. Thank you, Lynn.
