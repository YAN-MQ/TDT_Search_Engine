Argentina's economy minister said Wednesday the country's gross domestic 
product growth would be flat in the fourth quarter amid lingering 
economic uncertainties around the world. ``We're operating under the 
hypothesis that growth will be flat'' in the final three months of 
the year, Roque Fernandez told a news conference in Buenos Aires. 
But the leading Argentine economic official said that GDP should be 
above 5 percent for all of 1998. For 1999, Fernandez also said the 
government was sticking by its initial forecast of 4.8 percent growth, 
predicting that ``in the first four months of next year we'll see 
a recuperation from the crisis.'' Speaking with reporters, the official 
also confirmed interest by foreign companies, including British Petroleum 
and several U.S. corporations, in acquiring a 14.9 percent stake in 
energy company YPF. He said the government's execution of that planned 
sale would depend on market conditions. Officials had said previously 
such a sale would be completed by January 1999 by the government. 
In other developments, Fernandez said Argentina would continue to 
tap international debt markets, as it has done in recent weeks, if 
market conditions improve. The comments came as Argentine officials 
met in Europe with bankers and investors. Argentina has tapped international 
debt markets in recent weeks by re-opening two existing global bonds 
to sell a combined dlrs 550 million. On another issue, Fernandez confirmed 
the federal government had reached a deal with provincial governors 
that should allow Argentina's Senate to take up a sweeping tax-reform 
bill that had stalled in the upper house. The Senate is expected to 
begin debating the bill as early as next week. The legislation, already 
approved by the Chamber of Deputies, had stalled in the Senate.
