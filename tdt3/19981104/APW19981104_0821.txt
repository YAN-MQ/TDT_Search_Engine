Jordan on Wednesday revoked the press credentials of a popular Arab 
satellite television station and its employees, effectively closing 
the network's Amman bureau. The move against al-Jazeera Satellite 
Corp. came hours after it broadcast a scathing attack on Jordan in 
its widely watched program, al-itijah al-Muaakes, or The Opposite 
Direction. In the late Tuesday night show, the Qatar-based station 
hosted Syrian researcher, Mohammed Khalifeh, who accused King Hussein 
of conspiring with Israel since its foundation in 1948. Revoking al-Jazeera's 
credentials was in response to al-Jazeera's ``repeated and intentional 
insult against the Jordanian people and the political regime,'' Eyad 
Qattan, director-general of the Press and Publications Department 
at the Information Ministry, said. Mohammed Ajlouni, JSC's Amman representative, 
confirmed the suspension. He declined to provide other details. No 
news organization or journalists can function in the country without 
press credentials, which are issued by the Information Ministry. Information 
Minister Nasser Judeh said the attack was ``unjustified.'' The state-run 
Petra news agency quoted him as saying that al-Jazeera's office will 
remain closed until its anchorman ``publicly and officially apologizes'' 
for the attack and ceases his ``campaign against Jordan.'' Five Jordanians 
work at the Amman office of al-Jazeera, an all-news channel known 
as the Arab world's Cable News Network. The station is financed by 
the Qatari government. In the program, Khalifeh said the Jordanian 
army had ``surrendered Palestinian lands to the Israelis without any 
resistance'' in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Jordan was created to reward 
Hussein's family for siding with the ``Zionists,'' he added. ``Jordan 
is not a nation, but an artificial entity,'' Khalifeh said, describing 
Jordanians as ``a bunch of bedouins who live in an arid desert.'' 
Former Jordanian Foreign Minister Kamel Abu Jaber also participated 
in the program on a satellite link from Amman, but the Syrian anchorman, 
Faisal Qassem, was often seen interrupting him when he tried to respond. 
Jordanian citizens and officials condemned the program in calls to 
a local talk show shortly afterward on the Jordan Satellite Television 
Station. Relations with Syria _ already lukewarm since Jordan's 1994 
peace treaty with Israel _ strained earlier this year when Arab media 
reports suggested that Jordan was joining a military alliance with 
Israel and Turkey. Jordan denied the report. Damascus says such an 
alliance would undermine its security. This is the first time any 
news organization has been shut down in Jordan under a press law enacted 
in August that gives the state sweeping authority to punish journalists 
for reports considered disparaging of King Hussein.
