Japan's economic planning chief says, new government spending measures 
to boost Japan's sagging economy may exceed the 10 trillion yen promised 
by Prime Minister Kazuo Obuchi. The government is expected to announce 
the new stimulus steps on November 16th. But a government spokesman 
said, any new economic steps must trigger an immediate boost in domestic 
demand in order to insure a return to economic growth next year.
