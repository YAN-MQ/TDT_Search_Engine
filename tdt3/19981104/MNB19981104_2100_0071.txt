Good Wednesday evening to you. At about this time last night, you 
could feel it, a trend starting from east to west, race to race, time 
zone to time zone, skipping across the U.S. big republican candidates 
were falling fast and by big margins. Predictions were suddenly absolutely 
worthless. There was instant talk that the speaker of the house may 
not be able to hang on to that job. It was in many respects a shocker, 
a midterm election with the democrats expecting to get hammered, instead 
doing the hammering themselves. The republicans got it in several 
key races. And Washington is about to take on a whole new feel. Here 
is where everything stands as we go on the air tonight. In the Senate, 
the balance remains unchanged. The republicans have 55 seats, democrats 
in the minority with 55 although one of the wick tores in Kevin Newman 
is now subject to a recount. One result that came in late and was 
decided this morning, democrat Harry reed has dweeded Ensign. Carol 
Moseley-Braun made her concession speech today after losing in a long 
one to republican Peter Fitzgerald, 51-47. In the house, the republicans 
lost five seats to the democrats and not the other way around. They 
still retain the majority, but by less. 223 house seats to the democrats, 
211, one independent. The deprans lost one seat to the reformed candidate 
in Minnesota. Otherwise, the ballots remain the same there, too. 31 
republican governors to 17 democrats, one independent, now one reformed 
party. A big shift in California with the election of Gray Davis, 
the first democratic governor in that state in 16 years. And democratic 
senator Barbara boxer managed to defy the pundits and win a 10% margin 
against republican Mr. fong, the unexpected democratic wins mean house 
speaker Newt Gingrich is having to explain as a member of management 
here how his party could have miscalculated. I'm not blaming anyone. 
I'm commenting analytically on what we should have done. I take responsibility. 
I'm the speaker of the house and leded republican team. We in the 
house should have been more consistent and aggressive and stayed focus 
more on reforming government so we could cut taxes and on being in 
a Position to save social security by using the surplus to create 
certainly savings accounts. I think that was our mistake. I don't 
blame anyone else. The speaker on the morning after.
