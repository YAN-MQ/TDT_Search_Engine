Authorities have issued a material witness warrant in the murder investigation 
of Dr. Barnett slepian, the New York obstetrician who performed abortions. 
They want to question this man, 44-year-old James kopp of Vermont. 
They say they believe he may be able to help find the assailant, based 
on sightings of a car traced to him in slepian's hometown. Slepian 
was killed last month at his home in Amherst, New York. Sources tell 
CNN that investigators are trying to determine whether kopp has ties 
to anti-abortion movements.
