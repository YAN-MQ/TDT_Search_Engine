With election '98 over, there's something for both parties to brag 
about this morning. Yesterday's midterm elections have given republicans 
continued control of both the house and Senate. Democrats did better 
than expected in the house, picking up a few seats. We'll have more 
election results in a moment. But here's a quick look at the winners 
and losers. In New York, a big defeat for three-term republican senator 
Alfonse d'Amato. Illinois democratic incumbent Carol Moseley-Braun 
also lost the Senate race, and republican senator Lauch Faircloth 
lost the race in North Carolina. In California, democratic senator 
Barbara boxer will hold on to her seat. And Gray Davis will become 
the state's first democratic governor in 16 years. And what a night 
it was for the bush brothers. George W. bush handily won another term 
as governor of Texas. Brother Jeb won the Florida governorship. In 
the Senate, the republican/democrat split remains unchanged. In the 
house, democrats have picked up at least four seats. And in the state 
governors races, there is no change in the total number of republican 
statehouses. Vice President Al Gore says the results show what Americans 
really care about.
