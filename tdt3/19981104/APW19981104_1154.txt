A waterlogged pitch at the Arnold Schwarzenegger stadium and driving 
rain forced Swedish referee Karl-Erik Nilsson to postpone Wednesday's 
Champions League match between Sturm Graz and Real Madrid. The Group 
C match will be replayed Thursday, with the kickoff set for 8 p.m. 
(1945 GMT). UEFA wanted the match to kick off at 8. 45 (1945 GMT), 
but the two teams insisted on 8 p.m. and UEFA later agreed. ``It's 
too bad for the fans, but it was a correct decision by the referee,'' 
said Graz chairman Hannes Kartnig. Real officials agreed. ``The decision 
is fine, there is no reason for discussion,'' said Real board member 
Manuel Fernandes. The only problem for Real was to find a new hotel. 
The team checked out of its hotel before leaving for the stadium because 
it was planning to return home right after the match. Real Madrid 
has two wins and one loss, while Graz has lost all three group matches 
so far.
