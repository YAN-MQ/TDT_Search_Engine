Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki arrived Wedneday in Yemen for talks 
with the president on defining the two countries' maritime borders 
after they resolved a dispute over three Red Sea Islands. Afwerki's 
meeting with President Ali Abdullah Saleh follows Eritrea's withdrawal 
from a disputed island it controlled in line with last week's ruling 
by an international arbitration panel. During his three-day trip, 
Afwerki also will discuss the flow of shipping in the Red Sea, said 
a government spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
He is accompanied by his foreign and trade ministers. The three islands 
involved in the dispute sit across one of the world's major shipping 
lanes, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait 
at the southern entrance to the Red Sea. Afwerki also is expected 
to ask Saleh to close offices of Eritrean opposition groups based 
in the Yemeni capital San`a, said an African diplomat, insisting on 
anonymity. The Eritrean leader plans to discuss the possibility of 
Yemeni mediation between Eritrea and Sudan, said the diplomat. Relations 
between Sudan and Eritrea are tense following accusations by Sudan 
that Eritrea is aiding separatist rebels in southern Sudan. Yemen 
and Eritrea fought a battle over three Red Sea islands in December 
1995. Eritrea captured Greater Hanish island, while Yemen retained 
control of Lesser Hanish and Zuqar. On Oct. 9, the International Court 
of Arbitration based in The Hague, Netherlands, awarded all three 
islands to Yemen and said its decision should be honored within 90 
days. The court's decisions are legally binding. On Sunday, Eritrea 
withdrew its troops from Greater Hanish. The decision leaves Yemen 
free to develop three islands for tourism, scuba diving, oil and other 
enterprises.
