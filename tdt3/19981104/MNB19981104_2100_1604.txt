Time for a look at the weather, meteorologist Janice huff. I understand 
the storm is reforming and threatening Florida. Exactly. We hoped 
we were done with this dradge Di from hurricane Mitch. It is now back 
and of course not nearly at the strength we saw when it ravaged central 
America with all those heavy rains and mudslides and flooding. It 
has resurfaced and is regenerated into a tropical storm for the second 
time as it moves through the south eastern gulf of Mexico. It is moving 
towards the Florida keys. A lot of rain and severe weather has spread 
out ahead of that. We've had reports of tornadoes in the northern 
Florida keys. Right now the center of Mitch is 270 miles southwest 
of Florida. Now, tropical storm warning is in effect for the southern 
Florida Panhandle down to the keys. You can see all the heavy rain 
pushing through the keys and into south florida tonight. There's been 
quite a bit of wind damage reported. They're expecting four to eight 
inches of rain. You can see the rest of the country is relatively 
quiet. The pacific northwest seeing a storm system. There's snow in 
the central plains tonight. There's a tornado watch in effect for 
south Florida with all this moisture and convection and severe storms 
expected from tropical storm Mitch and possibly tornadoes. Travel 
weather tomorrow, you can see it's going to be nice for most of the 
country. The southwest and central plains. Chicago warms up to 44. 
The northeast, Boston, 52. More rain and thunderstorms, heavy at times 
for Miami tomorrow. As we watch what's left of Mitch moving out by 
the weekend, we'll see sunshine and dry conditions reappearing for 
the southern states for florida. They're going to have a time with 
this heavy rain Mitch is going to bring and possibly tornadoes in 
the next 24 hours.
