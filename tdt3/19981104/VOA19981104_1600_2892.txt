Well the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 8783, that was up 
77 points. Standard and Poor's 500 index closed at 1118, that was 
up 7 points. And the NASDAQ had a very good day, it closed up 35 points. 
Stock prices roared ahead early in the session with the industrial 
average gaining more than 130 points. Analysts say that was euphoria 
about Tuesday's US election results. The strong showing by the Democratic 
party convinced many traders that is now less likely that President 
Clinton will be impeached. But a wave of selling came into the market 
late in the day. Analysts say part of the selling was simply profit 
taking after the early gains. And part may have been the reassessment 
of the real impact of the election results.
