As late as last year, Microsoft Corp. was so worried about Netscape 
Communications Corp.'s lead in Internet software that its senior executives 
wanted to delay an upgrade of Microsoft's Windows operating system 
to gain an edge in the browser battle, according to internal Microsoft 
documents released this week by the government. The linchpin of Microsoft's 
defense in its antitrust trial is that its Internet Explorer, or IE, 
browser is a seamless feature of Windows _ not, as the government 
contends, a separate product bundled with Windows in an effort to 
give it an unfair advantage against Netscape. The origins of its product 
strategy, Microsoft asserts, date back more than four years to a meeting 
of its executives in April 1994. But internal Microsoft electronic-mail 
messages released this week by the Justice Department seem to cast 
doubt on these defense arguments. Microsoft, however, argues that 
the e-mail mostly supports its legal case. ``It shows that they regarded 
browsing functionality as part of Windows and were willing to delay 
an upgrade schedule to deliver a superior product,'' said Mark Murray, 
a Microsoft spokesman. Still, an e-mail exchange between two senior 
Microsoft executives in January 1997 _ more than a year after the 
company introduced its software for browsing the World Wide Web _ 
talks of competing with Netscape as ``pitting browser against browser'' 
and refers to ``browser market share as job 1.'' The exchange suggests 
that at that late date, within Microsoft, the browser and the operating 
system were not viewed as a single, seamless product. In an e-mail 
on Jan. 2, 1997, James Allchin, a Microsoft senior vice president, 
writes to Paul Maritz, a group vice president and the most senior 
Microsoft executive scheduled to appear as a witness in the trial, 
``I do not feel that we are going to win on our current path.'' Later, 
he adds, ``I am convinced we have to use Windows _ this is the one 
thing they don't have.'' In response, Allchin urges Maritz, ``If you 
agree that Windows is a huge asset, then it follows quickly that we 
are not investing sufficiently in finding ways to tie IE and Windows 
together.'' The more tightly Internet Explorer can be entwined in 
the next upgrade of Windows, Allchin writes, ``the more Netscape will 
be cut off.'' Defeating Netscape, the e-mail suggests, was such a 
priority at Microsoft that it was seen to outweigh the impact a delay 
of Windows would have on the computer industry. Sales of new personal 
computers, hardware add-ons and software all typically surge in the 
wake of an upgrade of Windows, part of the central nervous system 
that controls more than 90 percent of personal computers sold today. 
Delaying Windows to embed the browser, is ``the only thing that makes 
sense even if OEMs suffer,'' Allchin wrote, referring to ``original 
equipment manufacturers,'' jargon for computer makers. Maritz shared 
that view. In a response on the same day, he wrote that he saw ``little 
option'' but to fully integrate the browser in the operating system, 
``even if it means missing the OEM window'' _ the delivery time frame 
that would allow computer makers to install the upgrade on machines 
for the 1997 year-end sales season. Microsoft's Windows upgrade, code-named 
Memphis, was initially scheduled to be released in August or September 
1997. But its arrival was delayed until June of this year, and it 
is called Windows 98. In early 1997, Microsoft started hinting to 
software developers and analysts at industry conferences that Memphis 
might be delayed. ``It was never the reason given in public, but industry 
insiders believed that the real reason Memphis was being delayed was 
to totally integrate the browser and help Microsoft in its life-and-death 
battle with Netscape,'' said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, 
a research firm in Seaford, N.Y. ``This e-mail does seem to be proof 
of what Microsoft's intentions were back then.'' Memphis was delayed 
even more than Microsoft had thought in early 1997, partly as a result 
of Microsoft's $425 million purchase in April 1997 of Web TV Networks, 
an Internet-via-television service. Afterward, Microsoft also decided 
to include Web TV software in Memphis. Internet Explorer is fully 
embedded in Windows 98, but the company released a stand-alone version 
of its browser, Internet Explorer 4.0, in October 1997. In its defense, 
Microsoft has also said that it became company policy after a meeting 
in April 1994 to ``make a big bet on the Internet.'' Though few concrete 
plans were made that day, Microsoft says, there was agreement that 
Windows should have built-in access to the Internet, which eventually 
became its browser strategy. The meeting occurred a couple of days 
after Netscape was founded, and suggests, Microsoft says, that its 
main intention in the browser battle was to improve its operating 
system _ not to crush Netscape, as the Justice Department contends. 
Yet in an e-mail written on June 10, 1994, Steven Sinofsky, a Microsoft 
executive who helped organize the April meeting, portrays a company 
ambivalent about the Internet and not yet planning a browser of its 
own. ``I must admit,'' Sinofsky writes, ``that the thought of `Internet 
evangelism' is a little like evangelizing water to Noah.'' He describes 
the Microsoft message for Windows 95 as ``all the plumbing you need 
to connect to the Internet,'' mostly software protocols for communicating 
on the network. Later, Sinofsky wrote, ``We do not currently plan 
on any other client software, especially something like Mosaic.'' 
Mosaic was the name of the browser developed by the programmers at 
the University of Illinois, most of whom went on to help found Netscape. 
Even so, Sinofsky added that Microsoft was ``investigating possibilities.''
