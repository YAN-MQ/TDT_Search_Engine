All 27 of the incumbents seeking re-election to the House of Representatives 
from New York state sailed to victory Tuesday, and four open seats 
went to two Republicans and two Democrats, leaving the makeup of the 
delegation unchanged. In New York City, Joseph Crowley, D-Queens, 
who has spent 12 years in the state Assembly, easily defeated James 
Dillon, a Republican. Crowley will replace Rep. Thomas Manton, a Democrat 
who is stepping down after seven terms in Congress. Crowley, who was 
handpicked by Manton to run, will represent the 7th Congressional 
District, which covers parts of Queens and the Bronx. With 99 percent 
of election districts reporting at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, the vote 
was: Crowley: 45,082 (67 percent) Dillon: 18,167 (27 percent) In the 
9th Congressional District, Anthony Weiner, D-Brooklyn, easily won 
the seat that Rep. Charles Schumer is giving up after 18 years. He 
did not face a serious challenge from his Republican opponent, Louis 
Telano, because the district, which encompasses parts of Brooklyn 
and Queens, is overwhelmingly Democratic. With 98 percent of election 
districts reporting at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, the vote was: Weiner: 
63,774 (66 percent) Telano 23,065 (24 percent) Carolyn McCarthy, a 
Democrat who won her seat after her husband was killed in the 1992 
Long Island Rail Road shootings, defeated Gregory Becker, a Republican, 
in what turned out to be a tight race in the 4th Congressional District, 
in Nassau County. Early returns showed Becker ahead, but by 12:10 
a.m. Wednesday, with 92 percent of election districts reporting, Mrs. 
McCarthy had 53 percent of the vote, compared with 47 percent for 
her opponent. Two seats being vacated by powerful Republicans _ Gerald 
Solomon of Glens Falls, who is serving his 10th term, and Bill Paxon 
of Amherst, who is serving his fifth _ were won by close allies of 
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. John Sweeney, a Republican who worked as deputy 
secretary to Gov. George Pataki and as executive director of the Republican 
State Committee, won Solomon's seat. He will represent the 22nd Congressional 
District, which stretches from the Adirondacks to the mid-Hudson Valley, 
covering parts of nine counties. His Democratic challenger was Jean 
Bordewich. With all election districts reporting at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, 
the vote was: Sweeney: 100,257 (55 percent) Bordewich: 76,029 (42 
percent) Thomas Reynolds, minority leader of the Assembly for the 
last three years, captured Paxon's seat in the 27th Congressional 
District in western New York. Reynolds is a former insurance and real 
estate broker who won his Assembly seat in 1988. He and Sweeney both 
support lowering taxes, but Reynolds is more conservative on social 
issues, opposing abortion rights and gun control. He faced opposition 
from Bill Cook, a Democrat. With 85 percent of election districts 
reporting at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, the vote was: Reynolds: 83,658 
(58 percent) Cook: 61,285 (42 percent) Rep. Maurice Hinchey, D-Saugerties, 
who was considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents in Congress, 
defeated two challengers in the 26th Congressional District: William 
Bud Walker, a Republican apple farmer, and Randall Terry, a founder 
of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue who ran on the Right to 
Life Party line. With 95 percent of election districts reporting at 
12:30 a.m. Wednesday, Hinchey had 98,141 votes, or 62 percent; Walker 
had 48,168, or 31 percent, and Terry had 11,239, or 7 percent. The 
race in the 26th District, which sprawls from Newburgh through Binghamton 
to Ithaca, was emblematic of the struggle between moderate and conservative 
forces in the Republican Party. Terry railed against the party during 
his campaign, saying it had failed true conservatives by tolerating 
abortion, excessive taxes and homosexuality. Most party leaders supported 
Walker, but Terry's candidacy undoubtedly helped Hinchey win.
