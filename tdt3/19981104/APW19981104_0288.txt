Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon 
Wednesday after three pro-Israeli militiamen were killed. In the air 
strike, the fourth in three days, two jets fired at least two missiles 
at targets in Zillaya valley, 12 kilometers (seven miles) southwest 
of the southern town of Rashaya, Lebanese and Israeli officials said. 
About 15 minutes earlier, guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb under 
an armored vehicle of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army, killing 
three militiamen, Lebanese officials said. A fourth militiaman was 
wounded in the bombing, which occurred near Jezzine, 15 kilometers 
(10 miles) northwest of Zillaya. The SLA admitted three dead and one 
wounded in a statement carried by its radio station. Another roadside 
bomb exploded as Lebanese civil defense workers were putting out a 
bush fire sparked by the first bombing in the area. A fire engine 
was damaged but there were no casualties, the Civil Defense Department 
said in Beirut. The Iranian-backed guerrilla group Hezbollah claimed 
responsibility for the first roadside bomb in a statement issued in 
Beirut. Earlier Wednesday, guerrillas fired mortar bombs at an Israeli 
position in the occupied zone, some four kilometers (2.5 miles) south 
of Zillaya. There was no word on casualties from the 11:15 a.m. (0915 
GMT) air strike or the mortar attack. In Jerusalem, a spokesman for 
the Israeli military said their planes had attacked ``terrorist targets'' 
in Zillaya. Guerrillas are known to have hideouts in Zillaya valley 
and to cross it on their way to attack the Israeli-occupied zone. 
Israeli aircraft raided the same area twice on Monday. There were 
no reports of casualties from those raids. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah 
and other guerrillas are fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli troops 
and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the occupied zone which Israel set up 
in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks.
