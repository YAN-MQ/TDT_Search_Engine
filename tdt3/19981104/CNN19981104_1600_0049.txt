President Clinton is calling the results of the midterm election a 
"Vindication" of the democrats' message on such issues as health care 
and social security. The democrats aren't in charge, but they've beaten 
expectations republicans would gain seats in both the house and Senate. 
Mr. Clinton says voters seemed to be saying "get down to business." 
I think that they won because they had a clear message that was about 
america, about saving social security and improving education and 
passing the patients' Bill of rights and raising the minimum wage 
and those other things. I think that's why they won. And they were 
able to get an enormous outpouring of support in all quarters of the 
country. And I'm very proud of what they did. But I think they did 
it by putting progress over partisanship.
