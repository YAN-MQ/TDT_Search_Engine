BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said 
Wednesday the alliance's special force for emergency evacuation of 
civilian monitors in Kosovo will be ready to go by the end of November. 
The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking body, approved 
the ``initial concept of operations'' for the force and is expected 
to give its backing to the final operations plan next week, officials 
said. The extraction force of allied soldiers will be responsible 
for the emergency rescue of civilian monitors being dispatched to 
Kosovo if they run into unexpected danger. ``I expect to have it ready 
around the end of the month,'' Solana told reporters. ``Everything 
is in place now for finalizing the plan.'' Under a deal The monitors 
are verifying the promised withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, 
a predominantly ethnic Albanian province in Serbia. As part of the 
deal struck by U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke Oct. 12 with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic, about 2,000 monitors are being sent 
to Kosovo to verify the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from the predominantly 
ethnic Albanian province. The ground verifiers are being supplemented 
by surveillance aircraft. NATO officials said the ceasefire in Kosovo, 
where hundreds of people died and hundreds of thousands were displaced 
in seven months of conflict between the ruling Serbs and the ethnic 
Albanians, seems to be holding. Albanians make up about 90 percent 
of Kosovo's 2 million population and suffered the most during the 
fighting. As many as 300,000 ethnic Albanian civilians were driven 
from their homes by Serb police and army forces.
