Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that he will 
walk away from the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians 
if he believes they are not keeping all their promises. The warning 
came as Netanyahu traded accusations with Palestinian negotiators 
over the fate of 30 Palestinian fugitives whom Israel wants arrested 
by the Palestinian Authority. The latest dispute is holding up implementation 
of the 12-week plan under which Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent 
of the West Bank, in exchange for a series of Palestinian security 
measures. Netanyahu said he would only convene his Cabinet to ratify 
the peace agreement _ a necessary step ahead of implementation _ if 
he gets written assurances from the United States on a key Palestinian 
security pledge. Shortly after noon, Israel radio reported that the 
Cabinet session tentatively scheduled for 1:30 p.m. (1130) gmt would 
not take place. If confirmed, this would mark the third time in a 
week that Netanyahu postponed a Cabinet session called to ratify the 
accord. Netanyahu did not, 5th graf pvs.
