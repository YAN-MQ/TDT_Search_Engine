The first of seven PGA Gulf tournaments gets under way Thursday, as 
Mark Calkevikia defends his title at the Sarazan Open in Georgia. 
Calkevikia shot a tournament record 17 under par 271 last year. His 
score included a course record 10 under par 62 in the first round. 
Calkevikia says he seems to have success late in decades. You know 
I'd like to think that maybe I'm a late decade type player. I always 
won a lot of tournaments in the late '80s and maybe now is the time 
to do the same thing in the late '90s. But, now is the time to make 
a mark if I'm going to make one, again. Also, participating in that 
tournament with the Americans, John Houston, Scott Hoke, Scott Verplank, 
Paine Stewart, and two time winner Frank Novello of New Zealand. Novello 
says the tournament draws some of the top international players. Is 
Sarrazon as important because of Gene Sarrazon, and it invites Pros 
from all over the world, that have won national opens, as well as 
exempts a few people who haven't. The tournament will be played on 
the par 72 Chateau Elon course in Brazelton, Georgia. The first prize 
is $360,000.
