Talk show host Jay leno got in a few words with senator John Glenn 
today. The two men held a ten-minute conversation, which will be broadcast 
this evening on "the tonight show." Leno let loose with a flurry of 
questions. Does senator Glenn keep telling you how tough it was in 
the old days? How cramped it was, how small it was? How lucky you 
young punks are? Well, Jay, no. He doesn't always do that. Only when 
he is awake. Now, have you ever threatened to turn the space shuttle 
around and go home, senator Glenn, if these kids don't behave themselves? 
No, we haven't had to discipline anyone yet up here. Actually, I'm 
just a working stiff up here on this particular flight. Curt's the 
boss around this place. So I think it would be hard to convince him 
to go home. Nobody wants to go home. We're hoping for an extra day 
up here, since things have been going so good. Leno says the air-to-ground 
interview was "the most amazing thing that's ever happened to him."
