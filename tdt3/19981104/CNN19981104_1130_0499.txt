Pretty chilly today over the northern midwest and extending into portions 
of the northeast. Forecast highs only in the 30s and 40s today. It's 
cool through the southern plains and even back down into the southeast. 
Temperatures have cooled off. In our forecast, Mitch refuses to die, 
expected to be a tropical storm by later today, or on into the overnight 
hours as it pushes in through parts of Florida with more heavy rains 
and the potential for some severe thunderstorms as it interacts with 
that frontal boundary. In the pacific northwest we're looking for 
some wet weather as well with rain along the coast and higher-elevation 
snows. High pressure and fair weather but cool temperatures back through 
much of the midwest through tomorrow. The extended forecast, on Friday 
we'll find some snow through the northern rockies and rain in the 
pacific northwest. A few snow or snow showers expected in through 
the Great Lakes. Saturday, we find a storm back through the plains. 
That'll spread scattered showers and storms as temperatures remain 
cold to the north and still cool in portions of the southeast. And 
on Sunday, again, the cold weather continues to be the story over 
most of the U.S. for more weather information, log into CNN.com.
