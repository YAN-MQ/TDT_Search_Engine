England's highest court was asked Wednesday to overrule a decision 
that granted Augusto Pinochet immunity from prosecution for ``savage 
and barbarous crimes'' in the 17 years that he ruled Chile. Lawyers 
for the Spanish authorities, who have brought the charges against 
the 82-year-old former dictator, argued that it was a ``repugnant 
notion, offensive to all notions of human rights'' to categorize crimes 
like genocide and torture as ones committed ``in the course of official 
functions as head of state.'' The High Court in London ruled last 
week that Pinochet's status as a ``former sovereign'' entitled him 
to immunity. ``It is the argument of the Spanish authorities that 
the savage and barbarous crimes committed in Chile and the territories 
of other states, including the U.S.A., Spain and Italy, are not within 
the functions of a head of state in English law, the law of nations 
or the law of Chile,'' said Alun Jones, the Crown Prosecution Service 
lawyer who represents the Spanish. Jones questioned whether the general 
had even been head of state in the months after he had deposed President 
Salvador Allende Gossens and led a military junta. The distinction 
is important, Jones said, because 28 people were ``kidnapped, tortured 
and executed'' on the first day of the coup. The Spanish charges say 
at least 3,178 people were murdered or ``disappeared'' while Pinochet 
ruled Chile. Clive Nicholls, representing Pinochet, rejected that, 
saying, ``There's no suggestion that anyone else was head of state 
at this time.'' Nicholls also protested admitting new evidence from 
Spain on the grounds that it did not figure in the High Court decision 
under appeal. The 300-page document from the authorities in Madrid 
details ``a most ferocious oppression'' and a systematic criminal 
plot to eliminate ideological enemies of many nationalities in the 
Pinochet years, from 1973 to 1990. The judges said they would consider 
the new material and rule later on its admissibility. Pinochet was 
detained on Oct. 16 in a surprise arrest here on a request from Baltasar 
Garzon, a Spanish magistrate who is investigating atrocities in the 
``dirty wars'' in Latin America in the 1970s and 80s. The general 
is under police guard at a hospital North London, recovering from 
back surgery. About 150 people, including supporters and Chilean exiles 
and relatives of those who ``disappeared,'' crowded into an ornate 
committee room of the House of Lords for the first of two days of 
hearings. Among those watching were Isabel Allende, daughter of the 
former president, who died in the overthrow of his government; Juan 
Pablo Letelier, whose father, Orlando Letelier, Defense Minister before 
the coup, was murdered in 1976 in Washington in a car-bomb attack; 
and Joyce Horman, whose husband, Charles, was taken into custody in 
Chile and never seen again, inspiring the film ``Missing,'' which 
starred Jack Lemmon. The Lords, the upper house of Parliament, is 
the ultimate court of appeal for England and Wales, and Wednesday's 
case was heard by five of the 12 Lords of Appeal, senior judges who 
are also life peers. They are apparently hoping to decide the appeal 
this week, and if they rule in Pinochet's favor he could depart at 
once. Separate moves by Chilean exiles in Europe and other European 
governments seeking his extradition to Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, 
Luxembourg, Sweden or Switzerland would most likely fail.
