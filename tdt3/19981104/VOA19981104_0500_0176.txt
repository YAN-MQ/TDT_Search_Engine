Scores of fighters are reported killed in northern Tajikistan, in 
clashed between government troops and heavily armed rebels. VOA's 
Peter Heinline reports from Moscow. Tajik President, Emmamalir Rakmanoff 
called his security council into urgent session, with Russian and 
United Nation's advisors Wednesday, after fighting broke out in the 
Northern Leninabad region. Reports from the Tajik capital, Dushanbe 
say hundreds of fighters loyal to a former army commander Makmoud 
Kodoberduya crossed into Tajikistan from neighboring Uzbekistan, Tuesday, 
and seized several strategic points. Fierce clashes are said to be 
in progress around the regional capitol, Kojan, with heavy losses 
on both sides. Russian television reported that morning flights were 
canceled from Dushanbe to Kojan, where rebels are reported in control 
of the airport. The rebel commander and his forces were driven out 
of the mountainous central Asian country last year, after a failed 
coup attempt. Peter Heinline, VOA News, Moscow.
