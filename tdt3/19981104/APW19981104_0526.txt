In a showdown with Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and his administration, 
lawmakers voted Wednesday to withhold support for his plans for governing 
Hong Kong. Pro-democracy lawmakers succeeded in blocking a traditional 
motion of thanks for Tung's annual policy address, delivered last 
month, which outlines his governing strategy for the next 12 months. 
In debates last month on the motion, Tung came under fire for not 
doing enough to stimulate Hong Kong's sagging economy and to help 
the unemployed. The motion is symbolic, but the symbolism is important 
because it could illustrate Tung's crumbling popular support as Hong 
Kong struggles through hard times that have thrown thousands of people 
out of work and seen property prices collapse. Speaking to reporters 
at a separate function, Tung dismissed the motion as ``an internal 
matter for the legislature.'' He said some politicians might have 
tried to ``politicize this policy speech.'' Chief Secretary Anson 
Chan, Tung's deputy, also expressed disappointment after the vote, 
but said it would not affect the administration's ``commitment in 
implementing the various proposals and pledges the chief executive 
has made.'' She also pledged to continue efforts to build a ``constructive 
relationship'' with the legislature and ``to cooperate with them on 
the basis of mutual understanding and respect.'' In 1996, when then 
Governor Chris Patten delivered the last policy address under British 
colonial rule, the legislature voted to express ``deep regret'' that 
Britain failed to pursue full democratization during its 155 years 
in Hong Kong.
