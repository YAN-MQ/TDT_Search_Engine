The top US diplomat for Africa has met in Rwanda with Congolese rebels. 
VOA's Scott Sterns in Kingali, with Assistant Secretary of State Susan 
Rice who was concluding her tour of countries involving the Civil 
War in Congo Kinshasa. Ms. Rice met rebel leaders in Kigali after 
talks with Rwanda's government, Wednesday. Rebels want a face-to-face 
meeting with President Lauren Kabila, something Southern African leaders 
are trying to work out. Ms. Rice says the United States supports regional 
mediation in Congo, and believes rebels should be directly involved 
in that process. Our view has been that there are multiple players 
involved in this, and multiple players have to be involved in the 
solution. Rebels want a power sharing deal with Kinshasa and her transitional 
government ahead of elections. President Kabila says rebels are a 
front for an invasion by Rwanda. Rwandan troops are with the rebels, 
but the government here maintains its not involved. Rwanda says Kabila 
ally Zimbabwe and Angola cannot win the war militarily, and should 
reconsider bringing the battle farther east. Scott Sterns, VOA News, 
Kigali.
