The death toll from Hurricane Mitch has risen past the 9000 mark. 
Relief workers continue the grim task of recovering bodies and burying 
the dead. Survivors are stranded on roof tops and isolated patches 
of land. More than 11,000 remain missing in Honduras alone. A crowd 
in Leone near the heaviest mudslide area begged Nicaraguan President 
Arnaldo Alliemon to send them food.
