Bookstores are making room on the shelf for another comedian-turned-author. 
Sitcom star Ray Romano is throwing his hat into the literary ring. 
Bill Tush reports. One of these days, you'll turn around and I won't 
be here. Not today. When Ray Romano did his stand-up routine, it was 
about his life in Queens. When he got a sitcom deal, his show was, 
what else, his life in Queens. In fact, it was his brother, a New 
York cop, who came up with the title. He has to face criminals for 
a living, and I get paid the same amount, or maybe -- and more at 
that time, telling little jokes on stage, you know? So he would always 
kind of tease me, you know, "everybody loves Raymond." "everybody 
loves Raymond," since its 1996 debut, has found a Loyal audience that 
follows the adventures of Ray Barone and family. There might be a 
name change, but the barones are really the romanos. Sometimes they 
see themselves too much. Like, I have to keep repeating, "it's a show." 
And since Ray is playing Ray, he gets a little uncomfortable with 
that word "actor." Well, I mean, I guess I am. I mean, when I walk 
in the house on my show, Kiss my wife hello, that's acting, because 
that never happens with my wife. Now this reluctant actor is an author. 
Yeah, I guess you're using author very liberally. It's very weird, 
isn't it? Weird or not, Ray Romano's "everything and a kite" is coming 
to a Bookstore near you. I wanted to do it the right way, and it was 
torture. It was really hard. Because when I do stand-up, I can rely 
on my delivery and my cadence and this, this kind of stuff. And in 
print, I don't have that. So what to do? Find just the right typeface, 
that's the answer. I wrestled with that, with finding the right font. 
As for the title, "everything and a kite" came from one of his kids. 
I asked him what he wanted for his birthday, and that was his response. 
And I thought that was kind of neat. And I also thought it was pretty 
smart on his part, because in the art of haggling, you always ask 
for more than what you want. He wanted everything. "So let me throw 
a kite in there in case dad tries to talk me down." So, eventually, 
he'll be your agent -- Yeah, he'll be -- -- in about 20 years, right? 
I think I'll give him the 10%. There he is, stand-up comic, sitcom 
star and author. It could only happen to Raymond. Maybe that should 
be the title of his movie. Bill Tush, "CNN Entertainment News," New 
York.
