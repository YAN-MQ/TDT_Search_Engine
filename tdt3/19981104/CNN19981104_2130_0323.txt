Osama bin laden and his top lieutenant have been indicted on conspiracy 
charges. Federal prosecutors accuse the Saudi-born millionaire of 
masterminding a Terrorist campaign that culminated in the two U.S. 
embassy bombings in east africa. They also upped the reward to a record 
$5 million for information leading to the capture of the two men. 
216 people died in Nairobi, Kenya, in August when a bomb exploded 
outside the U.S. embassy. 11 people died in a similar bombing minutes 
later outside the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The charges 
brought today against osama bin laden and Mohammad atif are another 
indication of the progress of this investigation. Their names can 
be added to the list of those already charged in connection with the 
bombings in east Africa. This investigation has been given the highest 
priority. Our investigative strategy is clear -- we will identify, 
locate and prosecute right up the line, from those who constructed 
and delivered the bombs, to those who paid for them and ordered it 
done. Bin laden also was indicted in June by a U.S. grand jury in 
connection with the 1996 bombing of a U.S. military complex in Khobar, 
Saudi Arabia.
