Jack Kevorkian has been handed his first trial loss. He was convicted 
in a Michigan court on two misdemeanor charges in connection with 
a confrontation with Michigan police. He was fined $900. The confrontation 
happened when police tried to impound Kevorkian's car while he delivered 
the body of a 26-year-old quadriplegic to a hospital in may. Kevorkian 
claims to have been present at 120 deaths, and says he will not stop 
his campaign for assisted suicide.
