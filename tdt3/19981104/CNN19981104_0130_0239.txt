The house is holding tightly to its current balance of power. At this 
point, democrats have gained one seat with 76 races still up for grabs. 
While that may not seem like much, it's actually a substantial victory 
for the president's party. Before the election, republicans were expected 
to gain several seats. History almost dictates it. Minority leader 
Dick Gephardt says no matter where the balance stands, americans want 
the two parties to work together. The American people don't send us 
to the Congress to be partisan, they send us there to try to solve 
their problems and I will reach out every day in every way that I 
can to the republicans and try to fashion bipartisan solutions to 
our problems.
