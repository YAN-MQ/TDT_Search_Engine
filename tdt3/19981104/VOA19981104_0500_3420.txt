It is Wednesday, November 4th, 1998. On this date, in 1979, it was 
a terrible day for Americans. About 500 armed Irani militants stormed, 
seized the United States Embassy in Tehran taking 52 American Embassy 
officials and employees hostage. The takeover followed weeks of anti-American 
rhetoric coming out of that company. US President Jimmy Carter later 
rejected the kidnappers offer to release the 52 Americans in exchange 
for the return to Iran of the deposed Shah, who was receiving cancer 
treatments in the United States at the time. President Carter assumed 
personal responsibility for the negotiations for the release of the 
American diplomats. And it was an issue that haunted the remainder 
of his presidency. The Iranians freed the American hostages on January 
20th, 1981, moments after Ronald Reagan took the office of President, 
succeeding Jimmy Carter. It is coming up on 11 hours, Universal time.
