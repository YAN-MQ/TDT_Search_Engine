That monster storm Mitch is still going, regaining strength. It's 
heading toward south Florida. In Nicaragua and Honduras, 9,000 people 
are dead and 13,000 are missing. We get more now from George Lewis. 
Crews using earth-moving equipment to bury bodies in the mudslides 
below Nicaragua's casitas volcano. 1,200 bodies recovered so far, 
most buried in mass Graves. Another worry, how to help survivors. 
Many communities are cut off by flooding, downed bridges and washed-out 
roads. People in these areas suffer from malnutrition. In the village 
of Pueblo Nuevo, they shout "food! "Food! We need food for our kids!" 
The U.S. is helping to airlift supplies to the stricken areas. Many 
nicaraguans are distressed at the slow pace of the relief efforts 
and the blame the government here. The president of Nicaragua, arnoldo 
aleman, was booed by angry crowds when he surveyed destruction in 
this city. There are refugees everywhere. And in the shelters and 
camps, there are reports of cholera outbreaks. Public health officials 
are concerned about disease right now. Because of all the contaminated 
water left behind by hurricane Mitch, doctors fear possible epidemics 
of cholera, dengue fever, malaria and other deadly diseases. In the 
city of La Paz Centro, American peace corps volunteer Lea olschefskie 
is trying to educate refugees on how to avoid disease. At first, I 
was in shock. I mean, these people really have nothing. Now they have 
lost everything they ever had. Amid all the suffering, an amazing 
survivor's story. A Honduran woman, isabel arriola, washed out to 
sea, found alive 80 miles offshore after floating for six days. A 
helicopter from a British ship, "hms Sheffield," picked her up. Survival 
is a big concern right now in central America. But with towns and 
villages isolated by mud and floodwaters, many are starving and they 
feel trapped. George Lewis, NBC news, La Paz Centro, Nicaragua.
