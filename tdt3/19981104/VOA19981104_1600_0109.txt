An Israeli security demand is holding up Israel's ratification of 
the new interim peace deal with the Palestinians. Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu postponed a cabinet meeting on the accord for a second straight 
day. Correspondent Al Pessen reports from Jerusalem. The Israelis 
say they want the Palestinian Authority to specify which terrorism 
suspects it will arrest and when, rather than just restate the agreements 
call for some arrest. US embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz says the 
United States is working to settle the dispute. We are discussing 
the issues with both sides. We expect that this process will be completed 
shortly. Meanwhile a dispute is brewing over another issue. Israel 
is insisting on a formal vote at a Palestinian gathering in Gaza next 
month, to reaffirm change to the Palestinian Charter. The agreement 
requires only a reaffirmation, without specifying how that will be 
expressed. The senior US Middle East Mediator, Dennis Ross is expected 
in the region in the next few days, to try to help settle the disputes.
