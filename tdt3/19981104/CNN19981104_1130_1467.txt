Director George Lucas says he'll make the next two films of his "star 
wars" trilogy in Australia. Filming for the first movie in the prequel 
called "star wars: episode one, the phantom menace" was completed 
in Britain last year, and is expected to be released in the United 
States next year. Lucas says the biggest advance in the new films 
will be the digital special effects. He says the digital characters 
can now walk and talk with live-action actors.
