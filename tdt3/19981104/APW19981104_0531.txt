A plan to significantly ease the 1996 European Union ban on British 
beef exports was blocked by EU veterinary officials Wednesday but 
is likely to be approved later this month, officials said Wednesday. 
Opposition by veterinary officials from five of the 15 EU nations 
was enough to postpone, for now, a plan to allow the export of beef 
from British cattle born after Aug. 1, 1996. Exports of British beef 
were banned in March 1996 after Britain announced a possible link 
between ``mad cow'' disease in British beef and a fatal brain ailment 
in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Separately, the commission 
delayed a decision to ban beef and cattle exports from Portugal because 
the text of that decision was not ready. The commission said it will 
impose the ban within days after its legal service has examined the 
small print. The commission has proposed the export ban due to a sharp 
rise in Portuguese cases of ``mad cow'' disease. British exports were 
banned over two years ago, after an outbreak of ``mad cow disease,'' 
which was believed to have spread through Europe in animal feed. The 
plan to resume British sales, put forward by the EU Commission in 
June, now goes to EU farms ministers, who meet Nov. 23-24. A simple 
majority will suffice to approve the measure. At the veterinary committee 
meeting, eight EU countries endorsed the beef export plan. The Netherlands 
and Luxembourg abstained. Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Austria 
opposed the plan and formed a ``blocking minority.'' The National 
Farmers' Union said a decision to resume sales would help inject confidence 
into the farming community. After Wednesday's block, the British farm 
sector took heart since a lifting of the ban was now a possibility. 
Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers Union, called the vote 
``great news which puts us on track for the lifting of the beef ban 
before Christmas.'' The date-based British plan follows a Commission 
decision in May to allow the export from June 1 of beef from Northern 
Ireland certified to be free of ``mad cow'' disease, or bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy. The significantly broader date-based scheme would 
allow the export of British beef from animals born after Britain banned 
the use of cattle and sheep remains in animal feed and prohibited 
farms from holding those remains. BSE is believed to have spread through 
BSE-infected animal feed. Britain has reported the vast majority of 
BSE cases in Europe.
