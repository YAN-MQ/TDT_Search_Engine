Democrats also fared well in governor's races in the south, former 
state legislator Jim hodges upset republican incumbent David beasley 
in South Carolina. And in Alabama, lieutenant governor Don siegelman 
unseated republican governor fob James. He promised a lottery to help 
education. Both those races apparently turned on the issue of whether 
to institute a State lottery. The democratic candidate wasn't as successful 
in Florida -- lieutenant governor buddy mackay lost to Jeb bush, son 
of the former president. After proclaiming his victory, bush talked 
about what he hoped to accomplish as governor. This is a victory for 
fresh ideas, new ideas as we move into the next century. For making 
our schools work so that every child can learn, bringing common sense 
back to the justice system, for trusting family dose what's right, 
for unchalkling the small businesses so they can create jobs of tomorrow 
and making sure that entrepreneurial capitalism is extended to every 
nook and cranny of this state. This is what this victory is about. 
Jeb bush who tried to unseat Lawton Chiles but ran more moderately 
this time.
