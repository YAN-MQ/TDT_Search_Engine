It's been two weeks since Dr. Barnett slepian was shot to death in 
his home in Amherst, New York. Now, it appears authorities may have 
a break in the case. Pierre Thomas has more. This is a picture of 
the individual we're looking for. The FBI says they have identified 
a Vermont man who may have information about the execution of abortion 
provider Dr. Bernard slepian. An intense manhunt is now under way 
for James Charles kopp, charged as a Material witness in slepian's 
death. Mr. kopp is being sought based on a sighting of a 1987 black 
Chevy cavalier with Vermont license plate bpe216 in Amherst, New York, 
in the weeks proceeding slepian's homicide. Slepian was shot dead 
by a sniper while standing in the kitchen of his home on October 23rd. 
Police are investigating whether his shooting is connected to a series 
of other attacks involving doctors who perform abortions in upstate 
New York and Canada. The FBI emphasized kopp is not yet an official 
suspect in slepian's homicide. But sources tell CNN, law enforcement 
officials believe kopp may have ties to the anti-abortion movement, 
and that he may have been seen jogging in slepian's neighborhood not 
long before the shooting. The slepian shooting has refocused the justice 
department's concern about anti-abortion violence. CNN has learned 
plans are under way to launch a new task force aimed at investigating 
such attacks. Pierre Thomas, CNN, Washington.
