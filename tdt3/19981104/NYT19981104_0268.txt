Sinks, toilets and urinals in many public restrooms use infrared sensors 
to detect the presence of a person and activate the plumbing. There's 
no creepy voyeur lurking behind that small, dark sensor panel, just 
a lot of circuitry. On the wall or on the faucet, depending on the 
fixture, there is a black window about an inch long. Behind it is 
a light-emitting diode that is about the diameter of a ballpoint pen 
and gives off infrared light. It has a wavelength of 850 nanometers 
(850 billionths of a meter) and is not visible to the human eye, which 
can see only the spectrum from violet to red, ranging from 350 or 
400 nanometers to 750 or 800 nanometers. The system is designed to 
save water by keeping people from leaving the faucets on and to reduce 
the spread of germs on faucets. ``No-hands operation promotes hygiene 
and helps prevent the spread of dangerous bacteria,'' the Sloan Valve 
Co.'s promotional materials say. The use of automatic plumbing fixtures 
``provides a hygiene-rich environment that projects a positive message 
to the user,'' Sloan adds. Because faucets and fixtures are touched 
less often, they need fewer repairs and less scrubbing, which lowers 
maintenance costs, faucet manufacturers say. But automatic fixtures 
can also make life more complicated. Especially when it comes to toilets. 
With the automatic toilets at the new electrical engineering building 
at the University of Washington in Seattle, ``it's a riot,'' said 
Martin A. Afromowitz, a professor. ``You sit down and sit forward 
or back, and if your head's down, it flushes. We get triple-flushed 
and quadruple-flushed. It can give you a heart attack when you don't 
expect it.'' Other variables can also fake out the automatic-flushing 
system. ``Eighty percent of women hover,'' said Steve Bissell, senior 
product manager for the Kohler Co. in Kohler, Wis. ``They never sit 
on the fixture, or they sit much farther from the sensor. But the 
average man is the one who sets up the sensor.'' Such confusion can 
keep the toilet from flushing on its own. Kohler has built in a system 
to keep the toilet from flushing at the wrong time. It programs the 
sensor to wait for three seconds after the end of the reflected-light 
signal indicating that the toilet is in use before flushing. ``Children 
are a problem because they can be very tiny,'' said John Lauer, manager 
of installation engineering at Sloan, in Franklin Park, Ill. ``We 
always have on toilets a manual override button. It gives the person 
a little bit of personal control.'' The sensors may react differently 
to different colors because lighter shades reflect more light. But 
that was more of a problem in the early 70s, when sensors were less 
precise and underreacted to dark colors. While the sensors generally 
seem to have worked well enough to have gained broad acceptance, at 
least in airports, there are still a number of factors that can cause 
malfunctions. Sensors' functions can be affected by a change in the 
amount of light in a room, perhaps caused by dying fluorescent light 
bulbs. The ``touchless faucets'' are not cheap _ they range in price 
from around $300 to around $600. The assumption is that they will 
reduce water use, perhaps by up to 50 percent, even though they also 
consume power for operation. Most of them use AA or AAA batteries, 
which can last for two years, manufacturers say. Infrared plumbing 
technology has been around longer than one might expect. It has been 
a big hit since the opening of the 40-year-old Madonna Inn in San 
Luis Obispo, which has what it calls a ``world famous'' men's bathroom 
and ``caveman'' room. Both feature urinals made of heavy rock formations. 
When motion is detected in the room, waterfalls run over the rocks, 
ready to serve.
