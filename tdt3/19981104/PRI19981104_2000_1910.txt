Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat says they've arrested 12 of the 30 
Palestinians Israel wanted detained. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu said the detentions are a condition of the interim peace 
deal. Earlier, he postponed a Cabinet vote to ratify the agreement 
for a second day. Here's Leese Doucet in Jerusalem. The Palestinian 
leader revealed news of these arrests during a brief visit to Madrid. 
He told reporters there that these forces would make 100 percent effort 
to arrest all 30 Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis. Israel 
is still insisting it needs more convincing guarantees. Under the 
terms of this deal, the Palestinians agreed to submit a working plan 
for security to the United States. American officials had expressed 
satisfaction with the report, but a statement issued by the American 
ambassador to Tel Aviv said they were now seeking clarification on 
some security issues. Leese Doucet, BBC, Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu 
has just welcomed the latest arrests.
