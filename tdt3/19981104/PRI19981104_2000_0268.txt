Hurricane Mitch has set Central America's economy back by 20 years, 
according to the United Nations World Food Program. From Managua, 
Nicaragua, NPR's Phillip Davis reports. The remark came from an official 
at the U.N. Food Program which announced that it is rushing emergency 
food supplies to up to 250,000 people in Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, 
and Guatemala. Those countries are most affected by Hurricane Mitch, 
one of the deadliest storms of the century. The death toll now stands 
at at least 9,000 people, and thousands more are missing. Besides 
the World Food Program, half a dozen nations, including the United 
States, Great Britain, Norway, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, are 
sending aid. Mexico is mounting an ambitious air bridge of helicopter 
shipments of tons of medicine to Nicaragua, but relief workers say 
the devastation is still so overwhelming that that nation and the 
rest of the region could be facing widespread hunger soon. Phillip 
Davis, NPR News, Managua, Nicaragua.
