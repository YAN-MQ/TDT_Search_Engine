This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Thursday. We'll see a few snowflakes across the Great 
Lakes. Other than that, high pressure builds into the central United 
States. A cold front will produce rain and mountain snow scattered 
across the northwest. We could see some showers and storms in Texas, 
but it's Florida we're focusing on as tropical storm Mitch moves rapidly 
across southern Florida bringing several inches of rain and some strong, 
gusty winds. Thursday's high temperatures, 30s and 40s across much 
of the northern half of the country, mostly 50s and 60s in the south, 
although it will be a Little warmer in south Florida and across the 
southwest. Looking ahead to Friday, look for rain and mountain snow 
through the northwest and into the northern Rockies with cool air 
across the northern plains. Saturday, rain in the northwest, showers 
in the northeast and scattered showers and storms through the plains. 
Then on Sunday, it'll wet in the west and also across the midwest. 
Don't forget, you can find four-day forecasts for 7,200 cities at
