Embattled National Football League quarterback, Cary Collins has apologized 
for his arrest on drunken driving charges. The New Orleans Saints 
quarterback says he is very disappointed with his actions. Collins 
says, he is making a new commitment to himself, both on and off the 
field. Collins was arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina early Monday, 
after the Saints lost to his former team the Carolina Panthers. Reading, 
Tuesday, from a handwritten note, with trembling hands, Collins says 
he is at a crossroads in his career. I've just basically had enough. 
And I think I can still come back and be a leader of this team. I 
can get back to being the way I have always perceived myself as a 
good leader, and a committed guy. But, obviously it is going to take 
me busting my butt to win everyone over. But, I plan on doing that. 
The Panthers waived Collins after a string of behavioral miscues and 
a slumping performance on the field.
