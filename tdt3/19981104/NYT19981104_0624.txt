Still exultant from his victory in the bruising Senate race, Rep. 
Charles Schumer said Wednesday that education, health care and campaign-finance 
reform would be among his top priorities in Washington next year, 
and he vowed to keep his family in Brooklyn because he did not want 
to lose touch with his constituents. In the first of several days 
in which Schumer plans to crisscross the state thanking voters, the 
nine-term Democratic congressman greeted commuters near his home in 
Park Slope, held a lengthy news conference in Manhattan, made a surprise 
appearance at a teachers union meeting and read the Top-10 List on 
``Late Show With David Letterman.'' Looking exuberant, even if his 
eyes were a bit bloodshot from weariness, Schumer called his nine-percentage-point 
victory over Sen. Alfonse D'Amato ``a humbling and awesome experience'' 
and said he was looking forward to relaxing this weekend with his 
wife, Iris, and two daughters, Alison and Jessica. Asked if he planned 
to move his family to Washington, Schumer, 47, said no, partly because 
they love their Park Slope home and partly because he was worried 
about becoming disconnected from New Yorkers and their concerns. He 
said he plans to continue sharing a Washington apartment with three 
other members of Congress while commuting home on weekends. ``One 
of the nice things, I think, I hope, I pray, about being senator is 
that I can sort of keep my same lifestyle,'' he said. ``I learned 
a lesson a while back. The Congress members who live in Washington 
lose touch with the struggles and the dreams of our citizens far more 
quickly than those who live back in their districts.'' D'Amato, a 
Republican in his third term, held a brief news conference Wednesday 
morning in the parking lot of the Hilton Hotel and Towers in Manhattan, 
where he spent the night. The senator, 61, said he had not made up 
his mind about what he plans to do once he leaves office. ``It's been 
a great honor,'' D'Amato said, ``it's been a great privilege, it's 
been a great thrill to be senator from this great state. I've tried 
to make a difference and I think we have accomplished a lot.'' Schumer 
began his morning with a spate of television interviews, after which 
he walked Alison, who is 7, to her bus stop, trailed by a gaggle of 
photographers, reporters and two New York City police detectives serving 
as bodyguards. At a meeting of the United Federation of Teachers in 
lower Manhattan, Schumer got a standing ovation from several hundred 
teachers when he chided D'Amato for having attacked the teachers union 
early in the campaign. ``I think we have taught a lesson or two to 
those who would kick around teachers,'' he said. In the late afternoon, 
Schumer taped a segment for Letterman's show titled, ``Top 10 Things 
on Chuck Schumer's To-Do List.'' No. 8: ``Learn how to say `Pataki' 
without giggling.'' No. 3: ``Endorse new Starbucks beverage line: 
the Chuck-accino.'' And No. 1: ``Change my name to Chucky ``The Body'' 
Ventura,'' a reference to the former professional wrestler, Jesse 
``The Body'' Ventura, who was elected governor of Minnesota on Tuesday. 
During a 40-minute session with reporters, Schumer was asked whether 
he thought Tuesday's election, in which the Democrats picked up several 
House seats, amounted to a referendum on President Clinton and the 
Monica Lewinsky scandal. ``I think there was a feeling among New Yorkers 
and among Americans that there were some in Congress, particularly 
on the Republican side, that would rather spend time debating the 
Lewinsky affair than debating education and debating HMOs, and I think 
that hurt the Republican Party,'' he replied. Schumer, along with 
a minority of members of the House Judiciary Committee, voted against 
bringing impeachment proceedings against the president. He said Wednesday 
that he had not decided what he would do if the House votes to impeach 
the president _ which, after Tuesday's elections, is considered less 
likely to happen. An impeachment vote in the House would send the 
issue to the Senate, which would serve as the jury over the president's 
fate. Schumer said he had six priorities for his first year in the 
Senate: improving public schools and making all college tuition deductible; 
bringing jobs to upstate communities; improving health insurance; 
bolstering the Social Security system; expanding gun control, and 
revamping the nation's campaign-finance system. The New York Senate 
race was the most expensive in the country this year, with Schumer 
having spent $13 million and D'Amato $20 million by mid-October. Asked 
if he regretted the campaign's high price tag, Schumer said: ``No. 
I won.'' ``But I regret that the system is the way it is,'' he continued. 
``The way to deal with the system is not to unilaterally disarm, but 
rather to change the system so that one side doesn't have all these 
big megaweapons and the other side doesn't have any.'' Schumer said 
he spoke Wednesday morning to Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani, Republicans who supported D'Amato, to discuss state and 
city issues. He said he plans to meet with Pataki in the coming week 
to discuss ways of strengthening the upstate economy. Schumer said 
he wished the campaign could have been more positive in tone. But 
he said he thought that in the final days of the race, voters had 
heard his message on education, Social Security and other issues. 
``The best way to combat the cynicism of young people, and everybody 
in America, is to actually pass things that make people's lives better,'' 
he said. ``And that's what I'm going to do.''
