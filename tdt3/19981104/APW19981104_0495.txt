French police announced plans for tight security in the capital during 
a new protest by disgruntled high school students set for Thursday. 
Police banned street parking as of Wednesday evening and urged merchants 
to shutter their shops along the planned march route from the Montparnasse 
train station to the Education Ministry. In a communique issued Wednesday, 
the police said they were worried the protest could get ``out of control'' 
and said thousands of police would be deployed to try to prevent violence. 
Two recent student protests have drawn hundreds of thousands of protesters 
and disintegrated into violent rock-throwing demonstrations, resulting 
in injuries and property damage. Some high school students remain 
skeptical that plans by the Education Ministry to increase the number 
of teachers, improve equipment and lighten their load will really 
be carried out.
