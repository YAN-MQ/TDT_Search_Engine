Each morning this week, a convoy of U.N. cars _ with the required 
Iraqi escorts _ has headed into the field carrying U.N. weapons experts. 
It suggests a certain normality in the search for Iraq's weapons of 
mass destruction as mandated by U.N. Security Council resolutions 
that ended the 1991 Gulf War. But U.N. officials said Wednesday that 
this is mere trickery _ that things have changed markedly since Iraq 
on Saturday officially cut links to the U.N. Special Commission charged 
with ferreting out Iraq's long-range missiles and chemical and biological 
weapons. The U.N. convoys these days are carrying mainly monitors 
from the separate U.N. body overseeing the elimination of nuclear 
weapons, the International Atomic Energy Agency. It's sort of a pat 
on the back to the Vienna-headquartered IAEA, which is close to declaring 
Iraq free of nuclear weapons. That's in marked contrast to insistence 
by the Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, that Iraq is hiding other 
dangerous arms. However, Iraq also has given what might seem a reward 
to UNSCOM. In a formally announced ``exception'' to its ban on dealing 
with the commission, it is allowing UNSCOM technicians to ride along 
to repair monitoring cameras and collect samples from sensors. Ewen 
Buchanan, spokesman for UNSCOM in New York, sees this as yet another 
attempt by the Baghdad regime to deceive. ``By letting our technicians 
go out, they (the Iraqis) give the appearance that some sort of monitoring 
is still going on,'' he told The Associated Press. In fact, the monitors 
are supposed to do what UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler has said is 
among the commission's most important work _ the long-term monitoring 
designed to keep Iraq from building more weapons in the future. Buchanan 
says what's going on now is nothing like real monitoring. ``It's maintenance 
work,'' he added, explaining UNSCOM has just a handful of air-sampling 
sensors to check for chemicals and cameras at no more than 20 to 30 
sites, ``a small fraction'' of several hundred suspected weapons sites 
in Iraq. ``These things are a very minor part of monitoring and not 
a substitute for physical inspection,'' Buchanan said, contacted by 
telephone from Baghdad. He and U.N. officials in Iraq said the Baghdad 
regime has not told them formally why the nuclear monitors were allowed 
to continue their work while UNSCOM was stopped. ``They've tried in 
the past to divide us up in an attempt to show that UNSCOM is horrible 
and the IAEA nice,'' Buchanan noted. In fact, the almost-daily barbs 
from government officials and the state-run media target UNSCOM and 
Butler, its Australian chief. On Wednesday, the newspaper Babel _ 
published by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odei _ called UNSCOM 
inspectors ``a group of bandits, thieves and mercenaries whose only 
aim is to aggravate our hardships.'' It's not surprising Iraq gives 
different treatment to the two U.N. agencies _ which both must declare 
Iraq free of weapons before the Security Council can lift trade sanctions 
imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The IAEA report that 
it found no evidence of Iraq trying to develop nuclear weapons has 
been used by Iran's supporters on the council to suggest easing the 
sanctions, which have devastated the country's economy. Butler, meanwhile, 
has repeatedly said that Iraq has not fully disclosed the extent of 
its biological and chemical programs _ ammunition for the United States 
and Britain to argue sanctions should be maintained. To try to force 
the council's hand, Iraq on Aug. 5 announced that both the IAEA and 
UNSCOM must cease inspection activities _ unannounced, intrusive, 
spot-check visits to suspected weapons sites. The decision Saturday 
went further, barring UNSCOM from going to previously identified weapons 
sites. A day later, Butler said in a TV interview that the long-term 
monitoring is all that ensures Iraq will not be building a new arsenal 
in the future. ``I think that's what makes this the worst confrontation 
by Iraq with the Security Council,'' he said.
