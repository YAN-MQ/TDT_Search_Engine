Dismissing Turkey's accusation, an Islamic leader in exile on Wednesday 
denied ordering up a plot to disrupt the nation's 75th anniversary 
celebrations with a kamikaze attack on the tomb of Turkey's founder. 
However, Metin Kaplan of the Cologne, Germany-based Anatolian Federal 
Islamic State also said he has declared a holy war against the secular 
Turkish republic, which he wants replaced with a religious one. ``Whoever 
rejects an Islamic state are heathens,'' Kaplan told private Show 
television. Turkish police arrested 23 alleged members of Kaplan's 
group the day before Turkey's Oct. 29 celebrations of its founding 
by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Under Ataturk, overwhelmingly Muslim Turkey 
got a strictly secular constitution. The suspects confessed they had 
planned to mark the anniversary by crashing a plane into Ataturk's 
mausoleum, where Turkish leaders, foreign dignitaries and thousands 
of others were paying their respects. ``I have not assigned anyone 
for this subject,'' Kaplan said of the foiled attack. ``But all Muslims 
must abide with the jihad.'' Turkey has been weighing asking Germany 
to extradite Kaplan. Saying he is a political refugee, Germany has 
requested past such requests for Kaplan, who also leads the German-based 
Association of Islamic Groups and Communities. The two groups are 
not known to have carried out any attacks and have only a limited 
following in Turkey. From abroad, Kaplan has been stepping up a propaganda 
war against Turkey.
