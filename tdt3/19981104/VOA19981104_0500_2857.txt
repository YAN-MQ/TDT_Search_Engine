I'm kind of hot, and I feel pressed, so, news concerns President Clinton 
will be impeached. Germany's DAX index is trading up about 90 points, 
maybe two percent. The Paris KAK 40 is up nearly 60 points, about 
1.6 percent. And London's FUTZI is up around 70 points, and that is 
around 1.3 percent. The gains are led by financial institutions on 
hopes that interest rates will fall. But the European Central Bank 
has rejected calls by leading politicians to lower interest rates 
as a way to stimulate growth and employment. Among the 11 members 
joining the single currency in January. And it's much the same story 
in Germany. Neil McKennen, director at Burke and McKennon in London 
says officials at Germany's Bundesbank have indicated they plan to 
resist cutting interest rates. Nevertheless the German economy is 
sliding down on a wide variety of economic indicators, whether it 
is related to export orders, industrial production as well as the 
surveyed business climate index from EPHO all suggest that the economy 
is sliding down, and that there is at least a very good domestic case 
for considering a further reduction in German interest rates. Mr. 
McKennon expects national central banks, particularly Portugal, Italy 
and Ireland to follow Spain and Sweden in cutting interest rates. 
There was also news that Germany's new government expects the economy 
to grow at a 2 percent rate next year. That's a slow down from the 
2.7 percent rate expected this year.
