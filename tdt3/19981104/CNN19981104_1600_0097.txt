The Senate will stay where it was -- 55 republicans, 45 democrats. 
0 days ago, the Beltway guessers said republicans might hit 60 and 
control the entire debate. The house saw five seats switch to democrats, 
shrinking the republican advantage to ten. Any impeachment hearings 
in the house will still be controlled by republicans, but last night's 
vote was anything but a "full-steam-ahead" blessing.
