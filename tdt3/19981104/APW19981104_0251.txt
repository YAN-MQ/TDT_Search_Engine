Profit-taking sent Philippine stocks sharply lower Wednesday, ending 
two weeks of steady gains, traders said. The 30-share Philippine Stock 
Exchange Index fell 87.55 points, or 4.9 percent, to 1,714.09, more 
than wiping out Tuesday's 46.60-point gain. Wednesday's loss ended 
a streak of gains in the index that began Oct. 21 and totaled 333.95 
points, or 23 percent. ``The market was due for a technical correction. 
We've been waiting for it,'' said Russell Ong, manager for research 
of Anscor-Hagedorn Securities. He said the only factor sustaining 
the market's recent upward momentum was the strong peso. The peso 
hit a five-month high against the U.S. dollar in heavy trading on 
strong dollar inflows, traders said. The Philippine currency closed 
off its session high, however, as some banks with long dollar positions 
moved to take profits. The dollar averaged 39.380 pesos for the day, 
down 1.3 percent from Tuesday's average of 39.907 pesos. The peso 
hit a high of 39.155 pesos per dollar, its highest level since reaching 
39.070 pesos on June 5. It was last traded at 39.400 pesos to the 
dollar. Traders said there was some corporate demand for dollars in 
afternoon trading as the dollar's rate was considered attractive by 
those with pending demand for the U.S. currency. Central bank Managing 
Director Amando Tetangco said he expects more dollar inflows in coming 
days that will further boost the peso. He said the central bank received 
a dlrs 280 million loan from the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday 
that was added to its foreign currency reserves. The loan is part 
of a dlrs 1.3 billion standby credit arrangement previously agreed 
to by the IMF and the Philippines. However, the release of the loan 
to replenish the central bank's reserves is expected to further boost 
confidence in the peso. The day's most actively traded stock, Metro 
Pacific, gave up 24 centavos, or 13 percent, closing at 1.60 pesos, 
on profit-taking following hefty gains on speculation, later confirmed, 
that Hong Kong's First Pacific is eyeing management control of Philippine 
Long Distance Telephone Co. First Pacific is the parent company of 
Metro Pacific. PLDT shares, which also rallied in past sessions because 
of the speculation, gave up 40 pesos, or 3.9 percent, Wednesday to 
close at 970 pesos on profit-taking. The market's main index is seen 
extending its losses over the next few days, after which it is expected 
to resume its upward trek, said Ong. ``We're pretty bullish about 
the market now, what with the strong peso and the fact that everyone 
has accepted the weakness in the economy and has adjusted their respective 
outlooks and projections,'' he said.
