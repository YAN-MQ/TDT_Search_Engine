In 1960, Aaron Copland, searching for a new place to live as he approached 
his 60th birthday, found a six-room house on a hilly three-acre site 
in Cortlandt, N.Y., about an hour's drive north of New York. One room, 
separate from the main house, had two glass walls that overlooked 
forests, gardens and, in the distance, the Hudson River. ``This looks 
like a place where a composer could write music,'' he said at the 
time. He bought the house on the spot, and lived there until he died 
in 1990. Now, thanks to an unusual agreement between the Aaron Copland 
Fund for Music, which manages Copland's estate, and Cortlandt, a town 
of 38,000 in upper Westchester County, other composers will be able 
to live and work in that house, called Rock Hill. On Wednesday officials 
from the Copland Heritage Association, set up in 1990 to maintain 
the house, announced the names of seven composers who have won residencies 
at the house. Allen Shearer of Oakland, Calif., will be the first 
composer-in-residence, from Nov. 27 to Jan. 12. The other composers 
are Mark Kilstofte, Stephen Coxe, Carlos Carrillo, Donald Crockett, 
Akemi Naito and Robert Carl. When Copland died, the house was in bad 
shape, with a failing roof, wood rot, a faulty heating system and 
other problems. The Copland Fund decided to sell it. But the town 
of Cortlandt began a grass-roots effort to save the house and turn 
it into a permanent cultural institution. After six months of discussions 
an arrangement was worked out whereby the Copland Fund leased the 
house to the town for $1 a year. The town, in turn, leased the house 
to the newly formed Copland Heritage Association, a nonprofit organization 
that raised the $150,000 needed for repairs. The association will 
continue to maintain the house, with help from the town for services 
like snow removal and exterior painting. ``These were just ordinary, 
culturally minded townsfolk,'' said Michael Boriskin, a clarinetist 
who serves as artistic director of the association. ``We hear so often 
about government officials not caring a whit about such things, but 
the leadership in Cortlandt was visionary.'' The association will 
also present concerts, organize exhibits and develop educational programs. 
Given the modest size of the house, only one composer at a time can 
be in residence. Each recipient of the honor, known as the Aaron Copland 
Awards, will get the run of the place with a spouse or partner, but 
no children or pets are allowed. Residents will receive food allowances, 
and a car has been made available. ``We in the town are so proud that 
Aaron Copland lived here for 30 years,'' said Linda Puglisi, the town 
supervisor. ``It's wonderful that promising composers will now reside 
in his house, and hopefully write music comparable to Copland's.''
