Jewish settlers have moved 17 mobile homes onto a West Bank hill, 
and peace activists said Wednesday that this was part of a campaign 
to disrupt the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. Mobile homes have 
been put up in at least two other sites since the Oct. 23 signing 
of the new Mideast peace agreement, which calls for an Israeli troop 
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank. Settler leaders have said 
they are seizing land, fearing it will be handed over to the Palestinians. 
The United States opposes Jewish settlement expansion, and as part 
of the new accord urged both sides again to refrain from actions that 
could affect the outcome of negotiations on the future of the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip. In the latest incident, 17 mobile homes were 
erected about 250 meters (yards) away from the Avnei Hefetz settlement, 
a cluster of 150 homes about 35 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of 
Tel Aviv. Israel Bonder, the secretary at Avnei Hefetz, said the trailer 
park was planned months ago and not linked to the expected Israeli 
withdrawal. ``In any case, our settlement wouldn't be returned (to 
the Palestinians),'' Blonder said. He said the mobile homes were to 
be replaced eventually with permanent housing, but would not say how 
many new homes are to be built. Lt. Peter Lerner, spokesman for the 
Israeli military government in the West Bank, confirmed that the project 
had army approval. But the left-wing Peace Now group said the settlers 
are trying to prevent the government from carrying out the pullback. 
Hagit Yaari, spokeswoman for the peace group, said there was no housing 
shortage on Avnei Hefetz and that some 110 apartments there are standing 
empty. Blonder said that 60 apartments at Avnei Hefetz are vacant, 
but said that they were too small to accommodate families wanting 
to move into the settlement. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to appease Jewish settlers 
who oppose the agreement. Since the signing of the peace accord, Netanyahu 
has been ``giving bribes to the settlers by continuing settlements,'' 
he said. Netanyahu has said Israel would keep expanding settlements 
to accommodate what he said was natural population growth.
