Slipcovers are like window dressing,'' Mario Buatta said. ``They're 
the easiest and least expensive way to celebrate the change of seasons.'' 
And as the holidays approach, one newly dressed chair can make the 
difference between a room's being ready for guests or not. Ready-made 
slipcovers look different this fall, too. Like the dressed up, more 
tailored furniture at last month's High Point home furnishings market, 
slipcovers are more fitted than in the past. Also new is that some 
slipcovers come with back and seat pads sewn in. More expensive, yes, 
but they create an instantly upholstered piece. And unlike the duck 
or linen ready-made wraps of yesteryear, there are now attractive 
covers in a variety of fabrics from toiles de jouy to jewel-tone velvets. 
Watch, guests will rise to the occasion. Cover a chair with a slipcover 
of cotton toiles de jouy and the cushioned back and seat create an 
upholstered chair from a straight-back dining-room model _ even a 
tag-sale jalopy. The slipcover is $275 at the Monogram Shop, 11 Newtown 
Lane, Easthampton, N.Y.; (516) 329-3379. A cotton-velvet slipcover 
in purple, green or navy comes in three sizes: for a club chair, $249; 
love seat, $329; and a sofa, $349. From the Pottery Barn catalog, 
(800) 922-5507. A cotton cover that ties and tucks, in red, blue, 
gold or beige plaid, comes in sizes for a club chair, $172; love seat, 
$210; or sofa, $234. At Maison Decor, 1100 Madison Ave. (82nd Street). 
Plain or fancy covers for straight-back chairs are available in white 
canvas, $70, or burgundy velvet, $295. At the Monogram Shop.
