The European Commission said Wednesday preliminary talks to bring 
Cyprus and 10 East European nations into the EU were ``broadly on 
track'' with candidate nations remaining committed to economic and 
political reforms. It said three _ Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia 
_ were doing well enough they may advance to fast-track negotiations 
as of 1999. The commission warned Hungary and Slovenia to keep up 
the pace of writing EU rules and regulations into their laws. And 
it reiterated once again Turkey remained unready for membership, primarily 
because of its shaky human rights record. Appearing before the European 
Parliament, EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek gave 
a generally positive assessment of efforts to bring Cyprus and 10 
East European nations into the EU in the next decade. This year, the 
EU began preliminary talks with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, 
Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus and opened ``preparatory'' talks with 
Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. The second group 
are nations facing a tougher job in improving their economies before 
serious membership talks can begin. Yet Van den Broek said Latvia, 
Lithuania and Slovakia were performing better than expected. ``The 
rate of progress has been sufficient,'' he said for the European Commission 
to consider recommending ``the opening of (membership) negotiations 
at the end of 1999 for Latvia.'' ``For Lithuania and Slovakia, we 
also hope to be able to recommend the opening of negotiations within 
a reasonable period,'' he added. Countries wanting to join the EU 
must be democracies, market economies, at peace with their neighbors 
and able to absorb all EU laws, rules and regulations. The EU has 
set no date for its eastward enlargement. But the most successful 
candidates _ Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic _ may well join 
as early as 2003 or 2004. Preliminary talks opened in March. In its 
first report card, the Commission cited Hungary and Slovenia for ``a 
worrying slowdown'' in writing EU legislation into national laws. 
``If the stagnation ... continues, they could have a problem in the 
medium term in meeting their obligations as future member states,'' 
Van den Broek said. Across Eastern Europe, he added, countries must 
do more ``to protect human rights, improve the judicial system and 
the fight against corruption.'' He said Latvia was an exception. Speaking 
of the economic situation, the commission reported that: _ the Czech 
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia ``are functioning 
market economies that should be able to cope with competitive pressures 
and market forces within the union in the medium term.'' _ Latvia 
and Lithuania ``have made substantial progress'' on that score _ Slovakia 
suffers from ``excessive'' government intervention in the economy. 
_ Bulgaria and Romania ``cannot yet be regarded as market economies.'' 
As a group, the candidate countries enjoy an economic growth rate 
this year of 4.7 percent and they continue to attract foreign investments, 
the commission said. It added: ``Inflation is well below two digits 
in five of the countries and budget deficits are small.'' A weak point, 
said the commission, was the low priority given to environmental protection 
in Eastern Europe. The Commission was uncompromising for Turkey, citing 
shortcomings in human rights, in civilian control over the military 
as well as the military crackdown against Kurds in southeastern Turkey. 
``Turkey has most of the hallmarks of a market economy including a 
dynamic private sector and liberal trade rules. Provided that macro-economic 
stability is restored,'' the commission said, Turkey should have no 
problem in dealing with EU competitors. The commission said Cyprus 
was performing ``relatively well'' in economic terms, adding, ``The 
integration of Cyprus, including its northern part into the EU should 
not raise major economic difficulties.'' However, it added, the island's 
division and the inability to compose a Cyprus negotiating team that 
includes Turkish Cypriots posed an obstacle to a smooth entry into 
the EU of the entire island.
