A Palestinian Cabinet minister rescinded restrictions on foreign reporters 
Wednesday issued by a Palestinian agency two days earlier. The Palestinian 
Information Agency on Monday had ordered foreign reporters to register 
in advance before entering Palestinian territory and disclose whom 
they planned to interview in Palestinian areas. Palestinian Information 
Minister Yasser Abd Rabbo canceled the regulations and charged that 
the agency had no authority to issue them. He complained that the 
restrictions ``damage the reputation of the Palestinian Authority 
and turns it into an oppressive police state.'' The agency is a government 
agency that puts out official news releases and is connected to Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat's office. Abd Rabbo's ministry is separate. He 
announced the reversal of the restrictions in a letter to government 
officials and Arafat. The Foreign Press Association, which had criticized 
the regulations, welcomed their cancelation.
