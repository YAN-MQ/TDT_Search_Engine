Election night ice, and there's no re-count necessary in Buffalo, 
where the dominator has become the Sabres' all-time leader in wins. 
Dominik Hasek faced only 20 shots Tuesday night, as Buffalo skated 
past the bruins 4-2. Hasek has won 157 games, passing Don Edwards 
for the most ever by a Sabres' goalie. After falling behind 3-0, Pittsburgh 
rallied to score four of the next five goals and salvage a 4-all tie 
with the Flyers. Jaromir Jagr lit the lamp twice for the pens. Scott 
Stevens scored the go-ahead goal late in the second period to lead 
the Devils past the rangers 3-1. New Jersey has won five of six. The 
flames broke open a close game with three goals in the third period 
on way to beating the red wings in Detroit 5-2.
