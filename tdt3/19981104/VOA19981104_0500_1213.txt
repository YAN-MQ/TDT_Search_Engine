African heavy weight boxer Frank Botta appears to be the first opponent 
that Mike Tyson will face when he returns to the ring. The Nevada 
State Athletic Commission restored the former Heavy Weight Boxing 
Champion's license to fight, last month. Tyson has been out of the 
ring for 15 months, since he bit the ears of Evander Hollyfield in 
a title bout. Botta is the number one contender for the International 
Boxing Federation Crown now held by Hollyfield. Botta has just lost 
once in 37 fights. Tyson's advisor says the plan is to schedule the 
bout for January, however she says, a deal has not yet been finalized. 
That's Sports, I'm Jim Stevenson.
