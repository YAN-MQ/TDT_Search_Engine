A big victory for republicans took place in Florida. Bush won four 
years after he lost to outgoing governor Lawton Chiles. George W. 
bush won re-election in Texas. I showed texans, I showed people who 
pay attention to politics that one can adhere to the philosophy and 
implement policies that are compassionate for our fellow texans. I 
believe I showed people that you can adhere to a conservative philosophy, 
and win a sizable portion of the Hispanic vote and close the gender 
gap. I showed that you can win without having to sacrifice principle. 
I also know that campaigns are campaigns about ideas. I stayed on 
my agenda to make sure we have the best public education system of 
any state in the United States. I talked about implements charitable 
choice.
