With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
For Wednesday, a frontal system slides across the southeast. In its 
wake, we will expect some cooler and breezy conditions. And a rejuvenated 
Mitch will bring some moisture across the Florida peninsula. We'll 
continue to monitor that. And there's a frontal system that slides 
across the pacific northwest. In between, we're looking at temperatures 
mostly in the 30s and 40s, from the Canadian provinces, the Great 
Lakes, into Kansas and Nebraska and across northern sections of Texas. 
Expect a day that will be cloudy in Anchorage, Alaska, and 38 degrees. 
26 in Barrow. 83, Hilo. And San Juan, 84 and some showers. Our Thursday 
forecast, mostly 30s and 40s all the way from Montana into the ohio 
valley, the Great Lakes, the northeast and into New England. For Friday, 
some 70s can be found in the desert southwest. But we're also expecting 
a storm system to develop across the Rockies and the pacific northwest. 
Scattered showers can be found across the midwestern states going 
into saturday. For more weather information, log on to CNN.com.
