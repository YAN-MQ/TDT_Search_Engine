It appears Democratic Congressman Charles Schumer of New York has 
unseated incumbent Republican Senator Alphonse D'Amato. US news media

a forth term in the US Senate. The race was one of the most hotly 
contested, and nastiest in Tuesday's election, with issues playing 
a smaller role than personalities.
