French ferry workers walked out Wednesday for the second straight 
day, sharply reducing services across the English Channel. About 90 
percent of personnel at the Seafrance company were on strike, preventing 
two ships, the Cezanne and the Renoir, which sail daily for England, 
from sailing. A third ship on its way from England to its home port 
in Calais had to be directed to the French port of Dunkirk. Seafrance 
was advising its customers to use the British company P&AMP;0. However, 
Seafrance strikers have threatened to block P&AMP;O ships from docking 
in Calais. The workers are protesting the hiring of a former sailor 
from outside the company to be the new chief of passenger service. 
The strikers say he is unqualified for the post. No meetings between 
Seafrance management and the striking workers are scheduled for the 
time being.
