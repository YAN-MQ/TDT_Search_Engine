Also on the ballot in many states yesterday -- referendum questions. 
235 of them total, on issues ranging from death and taxes, to gambling 
and animal rights. Michigan voters said no to a proposal that would 
have made them the second state in the nation to allow doctor-assisted 
suicide. Voters in Colorado and Washington defeated bans on late-term 
abortions. Also in Washington, voters passed a complicated measure 
that would repeal affirmative action programs. That is expected to 
be fought out in the courts. Alaska and Hawaii effectively outlawed 
same-sex marriages. Alaska, Arizona, Nevada and Washington approved 
the medical use of marijuana. And in California, voters said yes to 
a 50-cent-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes to pay for programs 
for children.
