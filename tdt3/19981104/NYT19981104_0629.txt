In the end, the upset in New Jersey's 12th Congressional District 
Tuesday may have come down to a piece of doggerel, sung on the floor 
of the House of Representatives by Michael Pappas, the district's 
conservative Republican incumbent. It was the recording of Pappas, 
a freshman, singing the praises _ literally _ of independent counsel 
Kenneth Starr that the Democratic candidate, Rush Holt, used in a 
campaign advertisement that was broadcast over and over in the final 
weeks of the campaign. The Holt campaign said that using Pappas' words 
and music against him at least partly turned the race into a referendum 
on Starr as well as on Pappas' incumbency. If so, then Starr also 
lost on Tuesday. Holt survived a glitch in vote counting that at one 
point gave his opponent about 9,000 Democratic votes to become the 
first Democrat to be elected from the district in modern memory. The 
final, unofficial count was 91,572 for Holt to 86,448 for Pappas. 
The win by Holt, a Princeton physicist who has never held elected 
office, also tipped the balance of power in New Jersey's 13-member 
congressional delegation, giving the Democrats a one-seat majority. 
Both Democrats and Republicans gave a great deal of credit for the 
outcome of the race to the voters' negative reviews of Pappas' singing 
debut in the House of Representatives. ``We knew we had something 
potent, we knew it was cutting and we knew right away we were going 
to use it,'' Brad Lawrence, one of Holt's consultants, said of the 
moment he heard Pappas' performance. ``We just had to decide how.'' 
What they had was the tape of Pappas' appearance on the House floor 
days after Starr's explosive report on President Clinton's relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky. In a moment of unmistakable political euphoria, 
when many Republicans believed that Starr had assured Clinton's impeachment, 
Pappas lifted his tenor voice to sing, to the tune of ``Twinkle, Twinkle, 
Little Star'': Twinkle, twinkle, Kenneth Starr, Now we see how brave 
you are. We could not see which way to go If you did not lead us so, 
Twinkle, twinkle, Kenneth Starr Now we see how brave you are. In the 
Holt campaign spots, a female voice-over underscored the anti-Starr 
message. As Pappas sang in the background, the narrator said, ``Congress 
and Pappas spent millions and millions on partisan investigations, 
while voting against what really matters,'' and later: ``Congressman 
Pappas: Out of tune. Out of touch.'' ``It was a lighthearted, humorous 
way of calling attention to a serious question,'' Sean Spicer, Pappas' 
spokesman, said Wednesday. ``So it was taken out of context, and it 
meant that Holt never had to run an issues-driven campaign.'' Spicer 
added that the congressman would have no comment on the campaign's 
outcome. Both Republicans and Democrats agreed that there were other 
factors that helped Holt win. His forces engineered a strong turnout, 
and he raised about $750,000, almost as much as the incumbent Republican. 
And he benefited from Pappas' conservatism. In an interview shortly 
before the election, former Gov. Tom Kean _ still a popular figure 
in the state who represents the more genteel and moderate Republicanism 
of the current governor, Christie Whitman _ commented that Pappas 
``has not had a very good first term, and has been extreme on a number 
of things.'' The Holt campaign also put that sound bite on the air, 
but it was the ``Little Starr'' ad that allowed Holt to make a name 
for himself, said Roger Bodman, a prominent Republican strategist 
and consultant in the state. ``Cutting through the clutter is very 
difficult in a campaign,'' he said, ``and Brad Lawrence really did 
that for Holt with that spot.''
