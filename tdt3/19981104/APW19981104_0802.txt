A group of masked gunmen stormed a restaurant Wednesday in southeastern 
Bangladesh and killed two activists of an Islamic party. The attackers 
sprayed the two men with bullets as they were having tea at a restaurant 
at Fatkchari in the Chittagong district, 216 kilometers (135 miles) 
southeast of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, a police official said 
on customary condition of anonymity. Three other diners were injured, 
he said. No one claimed responsibility for killing the activists, 
who belonged to the Islamic Chhatra Shibir, the student front of the 
country's largest Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami. Police blamed the 
attack on party dissidents.
