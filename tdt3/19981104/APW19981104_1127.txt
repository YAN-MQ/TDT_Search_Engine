A strike locked visitors out of the Eiffel Tower for a fifth full 
day Wednesday and promised to keep Paris' most visited monument closed 
for a sixth day, despite two hours of talks. But the ``grande dame'' 
of Paris was not the only victim of social protests. France's ``Tres 
Grande Bibliotheque,'' or ``Very Big Library'' as the new National 
Library of France is jokingly known, was in its third week of a strike. 
Library employees, angry over computer glitches at the high-tech facility 
that opened to researchers less than a month ago, are demanding improved 
working conditions and closed doors on Monday. Representatives of 
the strikers met Wednesday with Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann 
and were expected to vote Thursday whether to continue their job action. 
Negotiations over the Eiffel Tower conflict ``didn't go too badly,'' 
the press office of the company that runs the Tower said. But new, 
minor points of contention were raised, it added, without providing 
details. The 200 workers employed at the Eiffel Tower are demanding 
more personnel, rejecting as insufficient the recent hiring of 20 
people, with plans to recruit five more workers at the start of the 
year. In the Wednesday talks, the Societe Nouvelle d'Exploitation 
de la Tour Eiffel, which runs the Eiffel Tower, modified its plan, 
saying the five others would be hired starting Dec. 19. But workers 
are now ``demanding new adjustments on minor organizational points 
which were not part of the negotiations,'' the press office said. 
The strike is costing the Eiffel Tower some 300,000 francs (dlrs 55,000) 
per day. They note that November is a slack period for tourists. Some 
310,000 people visited the Eiffel Tower in November 1997, compared 
to 850,000 visitors in August.
