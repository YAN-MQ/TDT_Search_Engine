Communists and other hardliners in the Russian parliament sought an 
official report on Boris Yeltsin's health while the president continued 
to recuperate at a Black Sea resort Wednesday. Parliament's lower 
house, the State Duma, asked the presidential doctors to give a detailed 
account of Yeltsin's condition. The lawmakers are expected to follow 
up Thursday, when they consider a bill that would require the president 
to undergo a medical exam, with the results passed on to parliament. 
However, the bill faces an uphill battle because Yeltsin would have 
to approve it before it becomes law, and he's almost certain to veto 
the measure. Yeltsin has ignored opposition attacks and insisted he 
will serve out his term that lasts until the middle of the year 2000. 
The president and his doctors say he has no serious health problems, 
and his current ailment is described as fatigue and high-blood pressure. 
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov insisted that a medical inspection 
would reveal that the president was incapable of performing his duties. 
Zyuganov has spoken about Yeltsin's drinking habits in extremely blunt 
language in the last few days, and he kept up his attacks Wednesday. 
``You would consider me mad if I suggest that you board a plane with 
a drunk and incapacitated first pilot,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference 
on Wednesday. ``I feel pity for him (Yeltsin), he destroyed his health 
with his own hands.'' Yeltsin has denied opposition claims that he 
has a drinking problem. Meanwhile, presidential aide Oleg Sysuyev 
said on Wednesday that Yeltsin would outline his ``new political role'' 
in an address to the parliament early next year. Sysuyev, who was 
in France, reiterated that the president would concentrate on political 
issues and allow his Cabinet to deal with economic matters, the Interfax 
news agency reported.
