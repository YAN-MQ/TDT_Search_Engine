US Defense Secretary, William Cohen is seeking support from the Gulf 
Arab states for action to pressure Iraq to cooperate with UN weapons 
inspections. However, he has received no backing in public for the 
possible use of military force. European Union Defense Ministers have 
warned Iraq, it faces the most severe consequences if it refuses to 
cooperate with UN inspectors. Iraq remains defiant and says it won't 
back down.
