When a friend needed to find emergency housing, Marina Rodriguez made 
a quick stop at a new electronic kiosk at the Camden Transportation 
Center in Camden, N.J. By simply touching the screen, she could instantly 
view listings of temporary shelters and other housing programs. ``This 
is a great way to reach people,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. The kiosks, 
which resemble souped-up ATMs, are part of a new effort by the United 
States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The project is 
the brainchild of HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo. Each kiosk offers around 
100 pages of information. Roughly 80 of the pages are direct reproductions 
of the pages available on the agency's Web site, while the rest provide 
local information specific to each community. The kiosks, which cost 
about $16,000 each, are connected by telephone lines to an Internet 
service provider so new content can be pulled from HUD's Web site, 
which is updated every night. So far, about 26 kiosks have been placed 
across the country in federal buildings, public libraries, shopping 
malls, city halls and even groceries, said Candi Harrison, Web manager 
for HUD's home page. That number is to increase to 30 by the end of 
the year, and to 80 in 1999. ``There's a great need for housing for 
low- to moderate-income families,'' said Laura Pelzer, senior community 
builder coordinator for HUD's Camden office. ``We need to assist people 
in any way we can. The kiosk is one way of letting them know we're 
here.'' Although access to the Internet is available through public 
libraries, schools and HUD offices, the kiosks were developed because 
many people are less intimidated by touch-screen technology than they 
are by computers. HUD worked with three companies that are considered 
experts in kiosk design _North Communications, Summit Research and 
Gensler, an architectural firm _ to design an attractive machine that 
is easy to use. Each kiosk has a video narrator who walks users through 
the program. The buttons are big and easy to use, and the screens 
are tilted so even people in wheelchairs can use them. A touch of 
the screen calls up the main menu, which provides eight categories 
to choose from: HUD in Your Community, HUD on Your Side, HUD. Next 
Door, Buy a Home, Find Housing, Keep Your Home, Get a Refund and File 
a Complaint. Some kiosks provide information in Spanish, and all screens 
can be printed, although there have been some glitches. Ms. Rodriguez, 
for example, could not get a printout because the kiosk had run out 
of paper. When she returned the next day, the paper drawer had been 
restocked, but she still could not get the printer to work. Security 
has not been a big problem so far, even though some of the kiosks 
are on the street. ``If people want to break into them, I'm sure they 
can,'' Ms. Harrison said. ``But I'm not aware of any problems yet.'' 
At $16,000 apiece, are the HUD kiosks worth the price? An accurate 
reading of the number of hits each kiosk gets will not be available 
for three months, but Ms. Harrison said the terminals were a good 
deal. Consider, she said, a single mother who buys her first home 
or a homeless family that manages to find shelter for the night. ``What 
value do you put on that?'' she asked.
