The man who helped North Korea strike multimillion-dollar business 
deals with South Korea has been named to guide the communist state's 
policy toward Seoul. He is Kim Yong Sun, 64, a close confidant of 
leader Kim Jong Il and a leading proponent of opening up the isolated 
North to outside investment, South Korean officials said Wednesday. 
He was named chairman of North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful 
Unification of the Fatherland, which is in charge of overall relations 
with South Korea. Its top post had been vacant since 1991. Kim already 
is a ruling Workers' Party secretary and head of the Asia-Pacific 
Peace Committee, a party organ that deals with South Korean businesses 
hoping to invest the North. This month, he successfully negotiated 
a number of business ventures with Hyundai, South Korea's largest 
conglomerate, including a dlrs 906 million tourism project. ``North 
Korea appears to make Kim the sole contact point for the South and 
become more consistent in dealing with the South,'' said Kim Young-joon, 
a Seoul government analyst. Kim's new appointment was revealed by 
Naewoe Press, which is run by South Korea's intelligence agency and 
closely monitors North Korean news media. North Korea rarely makes 
public its political appointments. Outside observers watch its news 
media for clues to any change in the reclusive state's government 
lineups. Hyundai's tourism project allows it to send several thousand 
tourists a week for a five-day tour of Diamond Mountain, a major attraction 
on the North's east coast, beginning Nov. 18. The sightseeing project 
would be the largest inter-Korea joint venture since the peninsula 
was divided into the communist North and capitalist South in 1945.
