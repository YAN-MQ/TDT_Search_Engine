Two security officials in breakaway Chechnya have been killed in what 
the government suspects was retaliation for a crackdown on crime and 
kidnappings, a news report said Wednesday. Chechnya's security forces 
have been waging a campaign to bring order to the violent region, 
but the attempt has also produced a spate of attacks against security 
officials. Security Ministry officials said two of their staff in 
capital Grozny have been found with their throats cut, the Interfax 
news agency reported. The ministry said the killings were an attempt 
to thwart the anti-crime campaign. Late last month, Chechnya's top 
anti-kidnapping official, Shadid Bargishev was killed in a car bomb 
explosion. Officials said Bargishev was targeted because he had promised 
to launch a major offensive against hostage-takers, and he had recently 
succeeded in securing the release of several captives, including a 
British couple. Chechnya has been plagued by kidnappings for ransom 
since its 1994-1996 independence war with Russia. About 100 people 
are still held, including three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk. 
Meanwhile, opponents of Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov have 
resumed demands for his resignation, saying he has been unable to 
bring order to the region, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Wednesday. 
Shamil Basayev, who served as acting prime minister for the first 
half of this year, accused Maskhadov of being unable to run Chechnya, 
ITAR-Tass reported. Maskhadov's resignation ``will be useful both 
for Chechen security and for the strengthening of the independent 
Chechen state,'' Basayev said in a television appearance Monday night. 
Chechnya considers itself independent, but no country has recognized 
its independence, and Moscow insists the territory is part of Russia.
