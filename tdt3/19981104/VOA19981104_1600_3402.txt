Millions of people tune into our short wave frequencies to get the 
news. In many locations we're also available on local FM and medium 
wave frequencies, or on cable and satellite systems. Plus you can 
listen to VOA News Now 24 hours a day on a properly equipped computer. 
All you need is a sound card, and access to the Internet. Then you 
can find our Netcast, by logging on to our website. If you have a 
piece of paper and a pen or pencil, you might reach for it so you 
can jot down our website address. That is www.voa.gov/newsnow. Thank 
you Erin. We're approaching 22 hours Universal time. That means we're 
closing down on all frequencies to the Middle East, North Africa, 
and Europe. All except for 15 kHz medium wave to the Persian Gulf 
Region. In Europe, during the next hour, VOA News Now can be heard 
on WRN1 via Astra, channel 22, audio subcarrier 7.38 MHz. VOA Newsnow 
continues to East Asia on 7.215, 9.77, 9.89, 11.76, 15.185, 15.29, 
15.305, 17.735, and 17.82 MHz. In Africa you can tune to 6.035, 7.415, 
11.975, 12.08, and 13.71 MHz, plus 909 and 1530 kHz medium wave as
