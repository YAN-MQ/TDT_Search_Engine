BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said 
Wednesday the alliance's Kosovo extraction force for emergency evacuation 
of civilian monitors will be ready to go by the end of November. The 
North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking body made up of ambassadors 
from the 16 member nations, approved the ``initial concept of operations'' 
for the force and is expected to give its backing to the final operations 
plan next week, officials said. The extraction force of allied soldiers 
will be responsible for the emergency rescue of civilian ``ground 
verifiers'' now being dispatched to Kosovo should they run into unexpected 
physical danger. ``I expect to have it ready around the end of the 
month,'' Solana told reporters. ``Everything is in place now for finalizing 
the plan.'' As part of the deal struck by U.S. negotiator Richard 
Holbrooke Oct. 12 with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, about 
2,000 verifiers are being recruited, trained and sent to Kosovo, a 
southern province of Serbia, to insure that Milosevic abides by the 
agreement. They are under the direction of the 54-nation Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The ground verifiers are being 
supplemented by surveillance aircraft. NATO officials said the ceasefire 
in Kosovo, where hundreds of people died and hundreds of thousands 
were displaced in seven months of conflict between the ruling Serbs 
and the ethnic Albanians, seems to be holding. Albanians make up about 
90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million population and suffered the most 
during the fighting. As many as 300,000 ethnic Albanian civilians 
were driven from their homes by Serb police and army forces. The NATO 
ambassadors sent the approved initial concept of operations back to 
Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in Europe, and instructed 
him to return with an operations plan in the next few days. NATO officials 
were reluctant to reveal details, saying only that the military is 
looking at ``a reasonable-sized force'' based close to Kosovo and 
``able to react in a matter of minutes.'' First choice of location 
is Macedonia, on Kosovo's southern border. But Macedonia has just 
had an election and the NATO alliance must wait for the new government 
to be formed before moving ahead with plans. The old Macedonian government 
already gave its approval for NATO to base its air surveillance mission 
in Skopje, the Macedonian capital. NATO officials insisted that the 
extraction force was not aimed at pulling out the OSCE verifiers but 
to deal with individuals or small groups that may find themselves 
needing special security help. NATO considers the situation in Kosovo 
to be stable. Officials said there have not been any significant skirmishes 
since Oct. 28, the date the alliance determined that Milosevic was 
largely in compliance with U.N. demands that he end his crackdown 
on ethnic Albanians. The alliance is keeping a close eye on the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army, which at one point had controlled as much 
as 40 percent of the province. There have been reports that the ethnic 
Albanian guerrillas have put up some checkpoints and have been digging 
in new positions in some areas, a NATO official said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. He said about 200 verifiers are now in place 
in Kosovo, though about half of them are personnel from the previous 
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, who were already in place.
