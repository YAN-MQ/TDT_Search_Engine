"I'll be there for you" is the "friends" theme song, and the same 
could be said of its viewers. The NBC sitcom ranks first among a list 
that measures viewer loyalty. That's defined as people who watch the 
better part of almost every episode. Other shows with highly loyal 
viewers include "the X-files," "Ally McBeal," "The CBS Sunday movie" 
and "law and order."
