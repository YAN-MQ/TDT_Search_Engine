One of the races which we watched very closely last night was for 
governor in Minnesota. A lot of people thought it just amusing that 
Jesse "the body" Ventura, former Navy seal, former professional wrestler, 
had thrown such a monkey wrench into traditional politics. But there 
was something more serious going on. And today Mr. Ventura, the quintessential 
outsider, is governor elect venture are. Thrill the people of Minnesota. 
I'm keend of amazing. Or left them embarrassed. I went to bed shocked, 
woke up more ked. But everyone here is surprised. Few took him seriously 
when he would run for governor on the reform party ticket. I only 
answer to the state of Minnesota. Earnest politicians like his opponents, 
the republican mayor of st. Paul and the democratic state attorney 
general with the most famous last name in Minnesota, Humphrey. They 
went after each other and virtually ignored Ventura. You have spending 
promise for everyone. There you go again. But Ventura proved he was 
no joke. His simple message, smaller government and lower taxes. When 
you say investment to me, somebody's reaching into my wallet. He impressed 
younger voters, who turned out in record numbers to support him. Now 
comes the hard part for Ventura, actually governing. Though he once 
served as a suburban mayor, he has no experience working with a large 
legislative body. Today, Ventura met with the outgoing governor, admitting 
he has a lot to learn before he takes office. I feel a little bit 
like Rodney Dangerfield. It's time to go back to school. But unlike 
Rodney Dangerfield, Jesse Ventura is suddenly getting a little respect.
