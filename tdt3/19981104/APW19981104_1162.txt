Bernie Williams has been courted by Colorado, Los Angeles, Texas, 
Baltimore, Detroit and other teams but remains undecided on where 
he will play next season. ``I still really have no idea,'' the free 
agent outfielder said Wednesday. ``It's still to early to make a determination.'' 
Fresh off a World Series win with the New York Yankees, the American 
League batting champion wants a deal at least seven years long and 
his agent, Scott Boras, sounds like he wants a higher average than 
the dlrs 13 million a year catcher Mike Piazza will get with his dlrs 
91 million, seven-year contract with the New York Mets. Williams spoke 
after presenting a dlrs 100,000 check from the New York Yankees Foundation 
and the New York Police Department to a day care center for the elderly. 
Williams is from Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. The Arizona Diamondbacks, 
managed by former Yankees manager Buck Showalter, have also said they 
are interested in Williams and hope to discuss pay with him this week. 
Teams may not discuss financial terms with free agents other than 
their former players until Friday. Williams said he has an emotional 
attachment to the Yankees after seven years in New York, but noted 
the team did not approach him while he was still under contract. He 
rejected a dlrs 37.5 million, five-year offer last spring, then cut 
off talks until after the season. ``It would be a little foolish if 
I didn't take advantage of the opportunity that I have now,'' Williams 
said, saying he hoped to make a decision within two months. He said 
he was seeking a city that offered stability for his family, ``a city 
that is easy to live in, that has a good system of schools and will 
give (my family) security for five or six years.'' Williams has a 
.339 average with 26 homers and 97 RBIs despite missing five weeks 
because of a sprained knee.
