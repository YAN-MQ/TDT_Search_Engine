In the gulf of Mexico tonight, tropical storm Mitch is gearing up 
again and it looks like the southern half of Florida will now be in 
the way. In central America, as we have seen, Mitch has been devastating. 
The death toll is still around,000. More than 1 million people are 
homeless. Helping them is an exercise in frustration. ABC's Ron Claiborne 
is still in Honduras. They began burying people today in mass Graves 
as a precaution against disease. But the main concern now is with 
the living, the Honduran government is trying to get food drinking 
water and medicine to the hundreds of thousands of people who are 
still largely cut off from the outside world. There's a lot of towns, 
small villages that haven't Eaton in two, three days. As fast as supplies 
can be gathered, the Honduran air force flies them out. In the poorest 
country in Latin America, there is simply not enough. In some villages, 
people are said to be so desperate, they rush the aircraft as they 
tried to land. Fearing for their safety, the pilots departed without 
delivering supplies. In the capital, some people are getting fed at 
shelters for the homeless and hungry. But there are still hundreds 
of villages accessible only by helicopter. Many of those villages 
haven't even been reached yet. Ron Claiborne, Honduras.
