For Christian conservative leaders, Tuesday's election was a pivotal 
test of their political power. They poured millions of dollars into 
key races, blitzed churchgoers with voter guides and helped persuade 
Republican leaders to make the election a national referendum on President 
Clinton's moral fitness for office. Now, with the Democrats' strong 
showing, those same Christian conservatives are blaming Republican 
leaders for making Clinton the only issue. Republicans, they say, 
failed to hit hard enough on abortion, vouchers for religious schools, 
homosexuality and school prayer, issues that usually motivate their 
core constituency to vote. ``There was no clear conservative agenda 
coming out of the conservative leaders in Washington, D.C.,'' said 
Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition. ``The Republicans 
tried to run a campaign solely on anti-Clinton sentiment.'' Gary Bauer, 
president of the Family Research Council, said: ``Dozens of candidates 
ran for the tall grass on values issues. And the result was they demoralized 
their own base.'' In several hard-fought races around the country, 
the candidates backed by conservative Christian groups went down to 
surprising defeats. They include Rep. Rick White of Washington state, 
who lost to Jay Inslee, the Democratic challenger; Gov. Fob James 
Jr. of Alabama, a Republican who lost to Lt. Gov. Donald Siegelman, 
a Democrat; and Gov. David Beasley of South Carolina, a Republican 
who lost to former state Rep. Jim Hodges, a Democrat. ``There's no 
way to put a smiley face on it,'' said James C. Dobson, the religious 
broadcaster and founder of Focus on the Family, a conservative ministry 
based in Colorado. ``It was a pretty resounding defeat in my view, 
especially when you have a president mired in scandal who is facing 
possible impeachment hearings. And the Republicans still could not 
make that case to voters. That is pretty sad.'' Dobson has been warning 
since February that religious conservative voters would abandon the 
Republican Party if it does not prioritize ``family values'' issues. 
Wednesday, Dobson called for Republicans in Congress to remove Speaker 
Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of 
Mississippi from their leadership positions. ``When the team is losing 
you look at the coach _ and in this case, we need to get rid of both 
coaches,'' Dobson said. ``They lost their nerve at the end of the 
session. They caved in on everything of importance to the pro-family 
and pro-life community.'' It was religious moderates and liberals, 
active in groups like the Interfaith Alliance and People for the American 
Way, who perceived that voters were disillusioned with the impeach-Clinton 
approach. People for the American Way's new political action committee, 
the Voters Alliance, spent about $2 million on an advertising campaign 
with the message, ``Let's Move On.'' ``The fact is the `Let's Move 
On' message did work,'' said Michael Lux, senior vice president for 
political affairs of People for the American Way. ``People who are 
tired of the focus on the scandal, tired of the Republican obsession 
with impeachment, got motivated to vote.'' Carole Shields, president 
of People for the American Way, said the Christian Coalition and the 
Family Research Council had sent out fund-raising letters and other 
mailings urging their members to cast their votes to impeach the president. 
``It's disingenuous for them to now say they weren't pushing this 
issue,'' Ms. Shields said. ``In many respects, they were the ones 
driving it.'' This year, polls of voters leaving election places show 
that some religious conservative voters, who usually vote Republican, 
crossed over to vote for Democratic candidates. In 1994, about two-thirds 
of religious conservatives voted Republican, and about one-fourth 
voted Democratic, according to a poll commissioned by the Christian 
Coalition. This year, only 54 percent of religious conservatives voted 
Republican, while 31 percent voted Democratic. Part of the reason 
for this, some religious conservative strategists say, is that the 
Democratic Party recruited conservative anti-abortion candidates to 
run in districts where it was clear a liberal could not win. The results 
were not all bleak for religious conservatives. They regard the resounding 
passage of statewide initiatives banning gay marriages in Hawaii and 
Alaska as significant, if expected, victories. In Washington state's 
2nd Congressional District, they defeated Grethe Cammermeyer, a lesbian 
who was dismissed from the Air Force National Guard because of her 
sexual orientation. And they helped hold off challenges to stalwart 
Republican incumbents who have backed the religious conservative agenda, 
among them Reps. Helen Chenoweth of Idaho and John Hostettler of Indiana. 
Despite these successes, said Ralph Reed, former executive director 
of the Christian Coalition, ``There wasn't a lot of ambiguity in the 
results. ``We thought mistakenly _ and I'm not including myself in 
this _ that the Clinton scandals were a sufficient rationale for a 
Republican majority,'' Reed said. ``And that was clearly a mistake. 
People are looking for what you're going to do to address the issues 
that affect their lives in a meaningful way.'' Reed, now a political 
consultant, said that in February, soon after the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal broke, he wrote a memorandum warning Republicans not to make 
the Clinton scandal the central issue. Although most of his clients 
followed this advice, Reed said, only about half of them won in Tuesday's 
elections. ``Ironically enough, Republicans made the same mistake 
during the era of Clinton that Democrats made during the era of Reagan,'' 
Reed said. ``They were so blinded by their hatred of Reagan, and Republicans 
have been so similarly blinded by their disdain for Clinton, that 
they have spent all their time trying to bring down his presidency 
rather than building around it. Democrats did the same thing trying 
to bring down Reagan and Bush on the Iran-contra scandal, and it didn't 
work.''
