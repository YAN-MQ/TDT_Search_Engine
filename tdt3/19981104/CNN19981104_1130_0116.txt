Republicans have been denied the filibuster-proof majority they wanted 
in the Senate. The balance of power was unchanged in the upper house. 
Republicans hold the same 55-45 majority they had before the election. 
New York republican Alfonse D'Amato was one of the big losers. The 
senator was ousted by democratic representative Charles Schumer. More 
thoon in a moment, but first, Lauch Faircloth went down to defeat 
in his contest with democratic trial lawyer John Edwards. And another 
big loser was incumbent Illinois democrat Carol Moseley-Braun. Fitzgerald 
spent millions of his own money in the campaign. Moseley-Braun's says 
it sent a message. One of the Senate's big winners was Barbara boxer 
of California. Support from African-Americans and Hispanics helped 
her to defeat Matt fong. Ernest Hollings held off republican representative 
Robert Inglis. In Wisconsin, campaign reform champion Russ Feingold 
won re-election, defeating Neumann, a kofsh tif. Kentucky voters chose 
conservative republican Jim Bunning to replace wendell Ford. He defeated 
his colleague, Scott Basler, in a see-saw battle.
