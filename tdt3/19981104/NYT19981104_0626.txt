LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ ``If you're going to be a little crazy,'' Dick Mandella 
said, considering the biggest gamble ever taken in the 15-year history 
of the Breeders' Cup, ``you might as well be real crazy.'' Mandella, 
the trainer of the 6-year-old star Gentlemen, was standing outside 
Barn 36 Wednesday morning, reflecting on the tantalizing question 
that had just been answered by R.D. Hubbard, the owner of Gentlemen: 
to enter the horse in the $4 million Classic instead of the $1 million 
Mile. He thereby turned a powerful race into a true classic, with 
a showdown against Skip Away and Silver Charm. Hubbard's risk involved 
money. Because Gentlemen had never been enrolled in the Breeders' 
Cup program at his birth in Argentina, his owner would have to pay 
a supplemental fee of 20 percent of the purse to enter him in any 
race. Hubbard, the chairman of Hollywood Park race track in Los Angeles, 
decided to be ``real crazy,'' so he rolled the dice and entered his 
horse in the Classic, risking a supplemental fee of $800,000. To win 
his gamble, the horse would have to finish first, with its prize money 
of $2.6 million, or second, with money of $1 million. In the Mile, 
he would have risked a supplemental fee of $200,000, and he would 
have had to run first ($665,600) or second ($256,000) to redeem his 
choice. ``Some people lose more money buying a yearling who never 
runs,'' Mandella reasoned several hours before Hubbard's decision 
was made formal in the draw for post positions. ``But we considered 
the decision for a long time. It's a serious decision, and $800,000 
is a lot of money. We didn't finally decide until early this morning.'' 
The decision was made after Gentlemen turned in a snappy half-mile 
workout in 46 4/5 seconds, and Hubbard said: ``Richard and I have 
gone over this every day for the last two weeks and probably changed 
our minds at least three times a day.'' Gentlemen's fate dominated 
the talk all week along the backstretch of Churchill Downs, where 
the final act in the drama will be played out on Saturday in the 15th 
Breeders' Cup: seven races with 85 star horses racing for purses of 
$12 million and the inside track on the year's championships. And 
it was still the buzz Wednesday when the horses were entered and Gentlemen 
was thrust against world-class rivals like Silver Charm and Skip Away 
for the biggest purse in racing, which grew to $5,120,000 with supplemental 
fees added. ``This is a great horse,'' Mandella said, trying to explain 
the reasoning behind the high-risk decision. ``For two years, he was 
unbeatable, the best in the world. Now he's 6 years old, but we think 
he may be back to his old form. We felt he could run with anybody, 
and he likes the distance of a mile and a quarter. And most of all, 
he deserves the chance.'' Gentlemen has won 13 of his 23 races and 
run in the money 19 times, with career earnings of $3.6 million. He 
has even won five of eight starts on the grass, so he would not have 
been venturing into unknown territory if he had entered the Mile. 
He has dazzled the West Coast in most of his races, but in his last 
two starts he has shown his speed and durability to New York. In the 
Jockey Club Gold Cup last month, he ran second to Silver Charm but 
in front of Skip Away. In the Woodward in September, he ran second 
to Skip Away. The Classic drew a powerful field of 11, one of the 
strongest fields in Breeders' Cup history. Silver Charm drew the No. 
8 post position and was rated the 8-5 favorite, Skip Away was next 
at 9-5 in the No. 6 stall and Gentlemen drew the No. 10 hole and was 
quoted at 6-1 by an oddsmaker who apparently did not share Hubbard's 
confidence or investment philosophy. One intriguing part of the equation 
was the coupling of three star horses for betting purposes because 
of common ownership elements. They were Awesome Again and Touch Gold, 
trained by Patrick Byrne, and Coronado's Quest, the 3-year-old speed 
horse from New York trained by Shug McGaughey. They were quoted at 
common odds of 9-2. Bob Baffert, who trains Silver Charm, voiced some 
pleasure that Gentlemen had been booked into the Classic because the 
horse has both the speed and stamina to keep Skip Away from controlling 
the race. ``Somebody has to keep Skip Away from getting an easy lead,'' 
Baffert said. ``He gets very brave on the lead by himself. Coronado's 
Quest can't go toe-to-toe with him. Skip Away just pours it on in 
his second quarter. He'll chew up a horse like Coronado's Quest in 
that quarter. He's just so fast, he runs you into the ground. The 
other early favorites for the Breeders' Cup were Cat Thief, Mountain 
Range and Tactical Cat, three of the five colts entered in the Juvenile 
by D.Wayne Lukas; Silverbulletday in the Juvenile Fillies; Affirmed 
Success in the Sprint; the English horse Labeeb in the Mile; Banshee 
Breeze in the Distaff, and Royal Anthem in the Turf.
