Good news for those planning to travel to New York. "The Wall Street 
Journal" reporting that southwest airlines is planning to fly in and 
out of New York's Macarthur airport in long island -- about 40 miles 
east of laguardia airport. The move could set off a price war as the 
biggest low-fare air carrier moves into the world's biggest aviation 
market. Other links southwest is considering -- New York to Los Angeles, 
Chicago, orlando, Nashville, Baltimore and Providence, Rhode Island.
