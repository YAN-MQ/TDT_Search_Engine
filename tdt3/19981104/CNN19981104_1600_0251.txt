If you're looking for color in yesterday's election, look no further 
than minnesota. Jesse Ventura pulled off the most astonishing upset 
by muscling past two career politicians to win the governor's job. 
The former pro wrestler and reform party candidate wound up with 37% 
of the vote. Ventura bills himself a moderate on social issues, but 
a fiscal conservative. I think that mainly, it was the case, of, you 
know, when you look at politics today, people are looking for credibility 
and honesty. That's what I tried to bring forth. I was honest with 
the people. I didn't try to tell them everything they wanted to hear. 
I told the truth as I saw it. And there were certain questions that 
I'd be honest. I'd say I don't know the answer to that. You don't 
always get that from professional politicians.
