However you feel about politics, a national election defines who we 
are at any given time. And now that all of the votes have been counted, 
victories declared, concession speeches made, the American political 
landscape looks a good deal different tonight than it did just 24 
hours ago. It now has a broad, middle road running through it, the 
preferred passage of both moderate democrats and pragmatic republicans. 
The American public sent some big messages through the ballot box. 
The day after the first-ever billion-dollar election, a clear message 
-- disgust with republican attacks on the president. The result -- 
democrats win in surprising numbers, capturing important seats in 
the house. Some highlights -- in New York, Alfonse D'Amato, the senator 
the White House loves to hate toppled by democrat Chuck Schumer. In 
California, a Senate seat the republicans not they could get but a 
sound victory for Barbara boxer. In Texas and Florida, the bush brothers 
are elected governor, not seen since the rockefellers in 1971. And 
in South Carolina, 77-year-old senator Ernest Hollings wins reelection. 
I have working with 97-year-old senator years now. Strom Thurmond 
makes Hollings the oldest junior senator in the nation. I just want 
to say, we won.
