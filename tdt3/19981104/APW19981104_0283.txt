A Shiite Muslim detained under a security law for spreading his brand 
of Islam began a hunger strike Wednesday demanding immediate release. 
Kamaruzaman Ismail, 45, in a signed statement from his detention camp, 
also called for the release of seven other Shiites arrested last November 
under the Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite imprisonment 
without trial. ``We were arrested for believing in a different Islamic 
creed,'' Kamaruzaman said in the statement issued by a leading human 
rights group, SUARAM. The government's department of Islamic affairs 
and the home ministry declined comment. The government of Malaysia 
_ a predominantly Sunni Muslim nation _ considers Shiite teachings 
a threat to national security, saying they could harm Muslim unity. 
More than half of Malaysia's 22 million people are Sunni Muslims. 
``This action which clearly violates human rights is another pretext 
of the ruling regime for silencing opposition voices,'' said Kamaruzaman, 
who was a member of the Islamic opposition party, Parti Islam SeMalaysia. 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has come under unprecedented attack 
by anti-government protesters since he fired his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, 
on Sept. 2. Protesters have called for Mahathir's resignation and 
the repeal of the ISA, under which Anwar was arrested. Anwar's trial 
began Monday on 10 counts of corruption and sodomy, all of which he 
denies and has called politically motivated. Last November, a group 
of 10 people including professors, social activists and religious 
scholars were arrested for spreading Shiite beliefs, the branch of 
Islam popular in Iran. Three were released. The government treats 
Shiite tenets as deviant. Allowing such pluralism in Islam, it reckons, 
will divide the Muslims in Malaysia. A few years ago, the government 
banned a Muslim group known as Al-Arqam that flourished in some areas, 
saying the group's teachings deviated from the true faith. ``It shows 
the government is quite intolerant of religious differences,'' said 
Elizabeth Wong of SUARAM.
