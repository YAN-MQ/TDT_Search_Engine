For the second time in two days, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
on Wednesday postponed a Cabinet meeting that was to ratify the land-for-security 
agreement with the Palestinians. Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, 
said the ministers would not be convened until Israel receives written 
guarantees from the United States that 30 Palestinian fugitives will 
be arrested. The new delay makes it increasingly unlikely that Israel 
and the Palestinians will stick to the 12-week time table that was 
to go begin Monday. As part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 
13 percent of the West Bank _ with the first pullback installment 
due Nov. 16 _ in exchange for Palestinian security steps. Netanyahu 
has said implementation would not begin until the agreement is approved 
by the Cabinet and by Israel's parliament. The U.S. position in the 
dispute was not clear. U.S. State Department and White House officials 
earlier said that the Palestinians have lived up to their obligations, 
but the spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, Larry Schwartz, 
said Wednesday that ``there are some security issues where additional 
clarification is being sought.'' U.S. officials are discussing the 
issue with both sides, Schwartz said, adding that ``we expect that 
this process will be completed shortly.'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb 
Erekat accused Netanyahu of seizing a pretext in order to dismantle 
the accord before it has begun. ``He (Netanyahu) is inventing new 
agreements. He does not want to honor anything,'' an angry Erekat 
told The Associated Press. The new recriminations made it clear that 
any good will created during last month's Mideast summit at secluded 
Wye Plantation in Maryland has dissipated and that the United States 
will be called in as a referee throughout the implementation process. 
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive Thursday in the region 
to oversee implementation. At issue in the latest dispute is Israel's 
demand to receive written U.S. guarantees that the Palestinians will 
arrest 30 Palestinians, most of them suspects in the killings of Israelis. 
Bar-Illan said that during the Wye negotiations, the two sides settled 
for verbal assurances that the Palestinians would arrest the 30 suspects. 
He said Israel was given to understand that it would receive written 
assurances on the arrests from the United States before implementation 
of the agreement began. Netanyahu said earlier Wednesday that he would 
convene his Cabinet in the afternoon once he had the U.S. guarantees 
in hand. Minutes before the meeting was to begin, Bar-Illan said it 
had been postponed indefinitely. However, Bar-Illan said he believed 
that after two phone conversations between Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright, that the United States had moved closer 
to the Israeli position. ``They now understand that this link is missing 
and without it we cannot proceed,'' Bar-Illan said. Erekat accused 
the United States of being inconsistent. ``In one statement, they 
say the Palestinians honored the agreement. In the other they say 
certain sentences must be clarified,'' he said. Asked by Israel radio 
if he was creating a crisis over a minor issue, Netanyahu said: ``I 
just want to establish the principle. ... We are not reopening the 
agreement. We are insisting that the agreement be honored to the letter.'' 
Netanyahu also said that he would not put up with Palestinian violations 
of the accord negotiated last month with U.S. help. ``I'm not saying 
that promises cannot be broken,'' he said. ``But if they are broken, 
we will stop the process.'' Commenting on the confusion that has accompanied 
the first days of the agreement, Israeli journalist Hemi Shalev wrote 
in the Maariv daily: ``There were many in Israel who expected a moving 
drama and others who expected a horrible tragedy, but no one thought 
that this `historic' week would of all things be a comedy of errors.''
