The Washington Post newspaper says, Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat 
has not finished cracking down on the Islamic militant group, Hamaz. 
According to the report, Mr. Arafat was asked, if the recent round 
up of scores of Hamaz activists has gone far enough. And he replied, 
"No, not yet." Mr. Arafat has ordered the detention of an estimated 
250 to 450 Hamaz activists. And placed under house arrest the group's 
spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmid Hasin.
