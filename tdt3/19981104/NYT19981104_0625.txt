The Republican-turned-Democrat beat the Democrat-turned-Republican 
in Suffolk County's 3rd Assembly District. The incumbent victor, Debra 
Mazzarelli, 43, a former telephone union worker, defeated I. William 
Bianchi Jr., 67, a former assemblyman who first lost to Ms. Mazzarelli 
four years ago when she ran as a Republican and he as a Democrat. 
As if that was not bewildering enough, Bianchi, who is still a registered 
Democrat, was defeated by Ms. Mazzarelli in the Democratic primary 
in September. Although the 3rd District is predominantly Republican, 
many voters apparently chose to ignore party lines, giving Ms. Mazzarelli 
15,143 votes to 11,202 votes for Bianchi, according to unofficial 
returns. ``I don't think party line was an issue,'' Ms. Mazzarelli 
said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``Voters wanted someone they 
could relate to on a personal level who was not the puppet of a party 
boss.'' Ms. Mazzarelli said she switched her party affiliation to 
Democrat because she believed the GOP was wrong for women and families 
and wrong about health care. ``The Republicans have come full circle 
from the days when George Bush talked of a kinder, gentler nation,'' 
she said. Bianchi, who also ran on the Conservative and Independent 
lines, campaigned as a supporter of health care reform and abortion 
rights. Ms. Mazzarelli's victory was a double embarrassment for John 
Powell, leader of the Suffolk County Republican party, who chose her 
in 1994 to challenge Bianchi. ``John Powell breathed life into her 
as a politician,'' said Alan F. Eysen, a spokesman for the county 
GOP. ``Then personally and politically she became a Brutus.'' Powell 
responded by picking Bianchi to oppose her, saying he was willing 
to overlook Bianchi's party affiliation because surveys showed that 
he was the one candidate who could beat Ms. Mazzarelli. Ms. Mazzarelli, 
however, defied the odds _ and possible confusion at the polls _ and 
took 57 percent of the vote, handing Powell yet another defeat. ``It's 
not the party bosses who win campaigns, it's the candidates and the 
people who support them,'' said Ms. Mazzarelli, who stayed up until 
4:30 Wednesday morning celebrating her victory.
