With much of the world agreed on a timetable to cut pollution, a U.N. 
conference on global warming turned its attention Wednesday to ways 
to trim the costs of the effort. ``It's important right from the start 
to focus on how countries can reach their targets at the lowest possible 
cost,'' said Mark Hambly, a member of the U.S. delegation. Some European 
Union and developing countries disagreed, saying the price of cleaning 
the environment should not be the first consideration. Delegates from 
over 160 nations are in Buenos Aires to find ways to implement a 1997 
global warming treaty reached in Kyoto, Japan. At that time, countries 
agreed industrialized nations should cut their pollution output by 
an average 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. U.S. officials opened 
the day's talks saying efforts to reach those levels should take into 
account the enormous expense to scale back emissions. Parties from 
both sides are expected to discuss the issue through the next week 
when environmental ministers from the countries arrive. Many scientists 
believe Earth is gradually warming because of what are known as greenhouse 
gas emissions _ mainly carbon dioxide from factories, power plants 
and automobiles. Critics say dire warming scenarios remain unproved 
and don't warrant potentially costly shifts away from fossil fuels. 
Meanwhile, senior U.S. delegation officials said ``positive'' talks 
were taking place with developing nations on ways to increase their 
commitment to reducing greenhouse gases. One of the few industrialized 
nations not to sign the Kyoto treaty, the United States has said it 
would only sign after poorer nations made a bigger commitment to fight 
pollution. Earlier this week, Argentina, backed by Washington, sought 
to add a discussion of ``voluntary'' quotas for those countries to 
the conference agenda. The move failed when a number of developing 
nations led by China blocked that effort. While the United States 
went into the discussions, a group of scientists called on Washington 
to make a bigger commitment in the fight against rising temperatures 
on Earth. Alden Meyer, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, 
said the United States should step up its commitment ``by having the 
president sign the Kyoto Protocol and announce some major domestic 
policy initiatives to show we're doing more at home.''
