Sam Donaldson is with us again and cokie Roberts joins us from Washington. 
Sam, you first. A little on last night's results and Bill Clinton's 
authority in the new congress. Do the democrats think it gives him 
the clout to back republicans off on impeachment? yes. And the White 
House is very pleased. They think the president may be out of the 
Woods here. The line that you hear from the president and others is 
it's up to the congress, it's up to the republicans to figure out 
the meaning of the election returns. We'll cooperate. But you get 
the mood in the sense that the White House believes now the president 
is going to be free in one way or the other. As far as his authority 
to get things done, that's another question. He'll come out as he 
has today, saying we have to have school construction, raise the minimum 
wage, we have to cure social security. But it's not at all clear that 
he'll have any ability to do that, although he's trying for a page 
in history, which has the first word something other than Monica Lewinsky. 
Sam, thanks. Let's go to cokie. What do the republicans think about 
-- do they worry that he has the authority to back them off on impeachment? 
Sure, they do. And they say that there's no in game here. They had 
a conference call today of the republicans on the Judiciary committee, 
figuring out who they will have as witnesses. Kenneth Starr is said 
to be among them. The words they're using is faster rather than slower, 
fewer witnesses rather than more and get this over with as easily 
as possible. But the truth is, they don't know how to do that. They're 
now deep into this. They don't know how to get out of it and they're 
looking for people to blame. So in as few words as possible, are we 
looking at a power struggle in the republican leadership? No kidding. 
Whether it actually comes to fru igs or not is another question. There's 
no obvious leader. You can't beat someone with no one is still true. 
Thank you both.
