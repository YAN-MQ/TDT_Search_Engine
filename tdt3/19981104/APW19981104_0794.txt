Only one government minister of 10 current and former officials summoned 
to appear Wednesday before a presidential commission investigating 
ethnic violence showed up. The nine others, several of whom have been 
implicated in stirring up the clashes in Rift Valley province in 1991-92 
that preceded Kenya's return to multiparty politics, were represented 
by attorneys. It was the first time high-ranking government officials 
had been summoned to appear before such a commission, which has powers 
of subpeona. Last week, reporters for the Daily Nation and the East 
African Standard told the Akiwumi Commission they had seen then Energy 
Minister Nicholas Biwott and Local Government Minister William ole 
Ntimama incite members of their respective Kalenjin and Maasai ethnic 
group to carry arms and drive those who favored multiparty democracy 
from the region. Attorneys representing Ntimama, now Minister of Transport 
and Communications, claim the reporters ``concocted'' the reports. 
Minister of Public Works Kipkalya Kones was to appear before the commission 
Thursday. Members of the commission were to rule on whether they would 
accept the reporters' version of events. Under the rules of the commission, 
if members are not satisfied with the attorneys' testimony, they can 
oblige the ministers themselves to appear. The commission was set 
up earlier this year to look into the origin of the clashes in which 
at least 1,000 people died and thousands more were forced out of their 
homes and still have not returned. Kenya became a single-party state 
in 1966 under former President Jomo Kenyatta and his Kenya African 
National Union party. President Daniel arap Moi, who assumed office 
on Kenyatta's death in 1978, and KANU reluctantly agreed to multiparty 
elections in 1992.
