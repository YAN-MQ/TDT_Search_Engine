You're listening to VOA News Now. We're broadcasting live from Washington. 
Universal time, and here is the top news story we're following at 
this hour. Tuesday's mid-term elections show President Clinton's sex 
and perjury scandal had little effect on the results, with the opposition 
Democratic party scoring some major upsets in congressional races. 
We'll have details on that coming up. Sports time has rolled around 
again, and Jim Stevenson has the report.
