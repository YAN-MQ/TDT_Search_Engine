A former Shin Bet informer and right-wing agitator who befriended 
Yitzhak Rabin's assassin will be indicted on charges he failed to 
prevent the killing, Israel's attorney general said Wednesday. Attorney 
General Eliyakim Rubinstein announced the indictment exactly three 
years after Yigal Amir, a Jewish extremist opposed to Rabin's land-for-peace 
deal with the Palestinians, shot and killed the prime minister. Rubinstein 
identified the suspect as Avishai Raviv, an informer for the Shin 
Bet security services who used the code name ``champagne.'' He faces 
a maximum two-year sentence if convicted. Raviv founded the radical 
group Eyal and was known for leading some of the most virulent protests 
against Rabin. At a news conference, Rubinstein said Raviv was aware 
of Amir's intentions to kill Rabin and did not tell his Shin Bet handlers 
about it. However, Raviv will not be charged as an accomplice because 
he did not know Amir's specific plans to shoot Rabin on the night 
of Nov. 4, 1995, Rubinstein said. The decision to indict Raviv is 
likely to fuel theories spread by the right-wing fringe that Shin 
Bet knew of Amir's assassination plan and intended _ with Rabin's 
knowledge _ to replace his bullets with blanks and let him fire them 
to discredit the right wing. Questions have also been raised about 
Raviv's relationship with Amir, and to what extent the Shin Bet informer 
may have encouraged Amir to carry out the killing. A government-appointed 
commission of inquiry into the assassination has ruled out any conspiracy. 
Israel's dovish opposition dismisses the conspiracy theories as attempts 
to deflect the blame for incitement against Rabin away from ultranationalist 
groups. Rabin supporters have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 
then the opposition leader, of creating the divisive political climate 
that led to the killing. Rubinstein said the Shin Bet was opposed 
to putting Raviv on trial _ apparently in part because it would hurt 
future recruitment efforts. However, ``the bottom line is that this 
is not a case against the (Shin Bet),'' Rubinstein said. ``It's a 
case against Avishai Raviv.'' Raviv will also be charged with encouraging 
violent acts and inciting to racism, a result of his activities in 
Eyal. Another Amir friend, Margalit Har-Shefi, was sentenced in September 
to nine months in jail for failing to prevent the assassination.
