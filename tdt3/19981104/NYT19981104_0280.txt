I was taught not listen to the radio while I worked. One of the fastest-growing 
Internet industries, Web radio, is based on breaking that very rule. 
There are two kinds of Web radio, both of which can be heard via streaming-audio 
technology. One kind is really ordinary radio that is heard over the 
Internet. The Web now makes it possible to tune into an out-of-state 
baseball game or listen to your favorite college radio station without 
leaving town. The other kind of Web radio was created exclusively 
for the Internet. Together, traditional broadcasters and Internet-only 
start-ups offer more than 1,700 audio channels that you can listen 
to through your computer. ``It's a critical mass of choice,'' said 
Larry Magne, editor of the original edition of ``Passport to Web Radio'' 
(International Broadcasting Service, 1997), which describes stations 
from Texas to Taipei. (An updated edition, edited by David Walcutt, 
appeared earlier this year.) Web sites like www.broadcast.com and 
the BRS Radio Directory (www.radio-directory.com) act as portals to 
thousands of traditional and Web-only stations. Magne said that in 
traditional broadcast markets, many genres, like classical, are losing 
out to programming that draws better advertising. The Web provides 
a broader range of choice. For example, Magne said that Radio Beethoven, 
a tiny classical station that broadcasts from Santiago, Chile, is 
one of the best classical radio stations around (www.beethovenfm.cl/RealAudio/ 
index.html). Many Web-only radio stations were founded on the idea 
of countering a trend toward less broadcast diversity. Web technology 
allows stations to offer niche programs. Some are homespun pirate 
stations or stations devoted to only one band, like www.deadradio.com, 
which exclusively plays the Grateful Dead. In addition to the many 
independent stations, there are larger Internet-only networks that 
offer multiple channels of music and talk. Three of those reviewed 
here _ Imagine Radio, Netradio and Spinner _ have eliminated audio 
advertisements and disk jockey chatter. They offer a wide variety 
of programming and, in the case of Imagine, personalizing programming. 
But personalized programming has made many record labels and the Recording 
Industry Association of America worry that Web radio will threaten 
CD sales. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which was recently 
signed into law, further secures copyright protection on line. While 
all Web radio stations are required to pay fees to artists through 
Ascap and BMI, this new legislation will force Web radio stations 
to pay a licensing fee to record labels as well. The act says customized 
stations must negotiate individual contracts with all the labels whose 
artists they play, and it forbids stations to play more than two songs 
in a row from a single artist in a three-hour period. ``Record companies 
don't yet understand the power of user customization,'' said John 
Adams, director of programming for Imagine Radio. ``They have to realize 
that it can expose new artists and increase record sales.'' To listen 
to Web radio, you need Real Player, a technology developed by the 
Real Networks Corp. that enables an audio signal to be ``streamed'' 
over the Internet. Real Player is available free at www.real.com and 
takes between 10 and 20 minutes to download. It can also be found 
through most Web radio portals and networks. If your modem uses dial-up 
access, Web radio will eat up half your bandwidth, and on any connection 
slower than an ISDN line, Web broadcasts are accompanied by an AM 
radio-style buzz. But if choice and control are more important, and 
if you like the retro charm of the AM buzz, then Web radio can be 
a listening adventure.
