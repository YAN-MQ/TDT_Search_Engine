This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Thursday. As high pressure builds into the plains states, 
the weather should be quiet across that region. We'll continue to 
see rain showers and mountain snow in the northwest as a Cold front 
moves inland. Other than that, a few showers in south Texas. But heavy 
rain is in store for Florida on Thursday as tropical storm Mitch moves 
across the region. We'll see just 30s and 40s across the northern 
half of the country. 50s and 60s south with some warmer weather in 
the southwest and southern florida. Looking ahead to Friday, look 
for rain in the northwest with snow across the northern Rockies and 
cool temperatures continuing. It warms up a bit in the south on Saturday 
with scattered showers and storms in the plains and rain across the 
northwest. On Sunday, rain on the west coast. Scattered showers through 
the Great Lakes. Temperatures will range anywhere from 30s in the 
upper midwest to 70s across the south. Don't forget, you can find
