The United States and Britain are warning Iraq, it must immediately 
allow United Nations inspectors to resume their search for banned 
Iraqi weapons. President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair agreed by 
telephone, Tuesday, that all options are open, including possible 
military force. UN Security Council has begun talks on a British sponsored 
resolution that diplomats say, sets the stage for possible use of 
force. Secretary of State Madeline Albright believes the US has the 
authority to use force if necessary. Let me say that the United States 
believes that we have all the authority we need to use military force 
if we have to, because the international community has spoken on this 
any number of times.
