A senior Malaysian police officer revealed Wednesday that intelligence 
police have a ``great secret'' to force people to retract statements 
and even to change their political views. Mohamed Said Awang, former 
chief of the Special Branch, Malaysia's top police intelligence unit, 
said police used the technique last year, allegedly at the behest 
of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. Mohamed, who was testifying 
at Anwar's trial on corruption charges, said his officers had used 
the method called ``Operation Turning Over'' to force two people who 
had alleged sexual misdeeds by Anwar to retract their statements. 
``Basically we do a quick assessment on our target, so we know how 
possible it is for us to turn them over,'' he told prosecutors during 
the third day of the trial. ``If it is a certain political stand, 
we may neutralize the stand if it is a security threat,'' he said. 
When trial Judge Augustine Paul asked Mohamed to elaborate, he said: 
``My Lord, this is a Special Branch secret. It is a great secret.'' 
Among the 10 charges Anwar faces, four relate to alleged misuse of 
his influence as deputy prime minister to force police to tamper with 
evidence about his alleged sex acts. Anwar was fired by Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 and arrested 18 days later. He denies 
all the charges. Of the two retractions referred to in court Wednesday, 
one was a statement by Anwar's personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, 
who said Anwar sodomized him 15 times. The other was by Ummi Hasilda 
Ali, the sister of Anwar's private secretary, who said her brother's 
wife had sex with Anwar. Mohamed said that during the interrogation 
of the two, police came to question whether the allegations were true. 
``Despite that, I directed them to go ahead and neutralize them,'' 
Mohamed said.
