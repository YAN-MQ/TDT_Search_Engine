Plagued by years of drought and a sour economy, the world's largest 
camel bazaar is suffering from slow trading. The Pushkar Camel Fair, 
which began Oct. 23 and ends Wednesday night, still drew more than 
30,000 camels to this Hindu holy town at the edge of the Thar Desert 
in the western Indian state of Rajasthan. The camels, which sell for 
anywhere between 5,000 rupees (about dlrs 125) to 42,000 rupees (dlrs 
1,000), are checked by traders for stance, stride, condition of teeth 
and most important, head position. A camel that holds its head high 
is good for riding. One which bows its head is used for pulling. The 
camel is still the work horse of the Indian desert, where they lumber 
through fields and along any highway, pulling loads of sugar cane, 
hay or firewood stripped from the precious few trees. But many traders 
said they feared a centuries-old way of life might be fading away. 
``Why use camels when a tractor can do the work of seven?'' said Preladh 
Singh, 68, who shepherded eight camels on a seven-day walk from Chitughar 
in the nearby state of Madhya Pradesh. After a week camping out at 
the fair, he still hadn't sold a single camel. He planned to try his 
luck elsewhere rather than return home empty-handed. While Singh left 
his family behind, other traders' wives and daughters went through 
Pushkar's sprawling outdoor market, haggling for the colorful clothing 
and jewelry. Members of the Rabari tribe, who often live in remote 
villages, use the bazaar as an annual meeting place to find marriage 
partners for their children. The fair, which coincides with a Hindu 
festival, also draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from throughout 
India. They come to bathe in the holy waters of Pushkar Lake, believed 
to have the power to cleanse a lifetime of sins.
