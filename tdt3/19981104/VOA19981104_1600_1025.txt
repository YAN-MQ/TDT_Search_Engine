The National Basketball Association Players Union and team owners 
have broken off talks after heated arguments in New York. The owners 
were reportedly upset by comments made by players union head, Billy 
Hunter, in which he said rumors of an agreement to end a player lockout 
were greatly exaggerated. Wednesday, Hunter said, the two sides had 
not even talked with each other. So sitting in the meeting room was 
useless. There's no lecturing going on. We're just sitting around 
a table. I guess both of us is sort of somewhat resigned to not really 
knowing which way to move next. And so we just thought that maybe 
it might be better to go back to our respective offices. And you know, 
look at where we were, and then if we thought it appropriate, talk 
about getting back together on Friday. NBA Commissioner David Stern 
says the higher paid players are blocking the negotiation process. 
We now have on the table a proposal that does extraordinary amount 
for what we call the middle class. But it is now clear to me that 
the agents for the high end players are not going to let that deal 
go down, without a real disruption. And that's what you're about to 
start seeing now. The two sides have been at odds since July about 
players salaries and team revenues. The owners say players salaries 
are outrunning revenue. The players say they should be able to make 
as much as the market will allow. The lockout has led to the cancellation 
of the first month of the regular season.
