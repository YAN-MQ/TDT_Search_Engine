Esther Shapiro has a sneaky way to make her daughter Debbie to log 
off of America Online and do her homework. She goes into Debbie's 
brother Andre's room and picks up his phone receiver. Since Debbie 
and Andre share a phone line, the move automatically cuts off Debbie's 
online connection. ``It's a little trick I learned,'' Ms. Shapiro 
said. ``I use it as a last resort, when telling her to get off doesn't 
work.'' Ms. Shapiro is among the legions of parents trying to monitor 
their children's online time, but who feel that exercising too much 
control could disrupt their children's privacy. ``I worry about her 
being disciplined about school work,'' Ms. Shapiro said, ``because 
this seems like too much time talking with her friends. But at the 
same time, I know I have to try and trust her.'' Short of using any 
of the countless e-mail and Internet filters now available, which 
can offend the average 16-year-old, what is the beleaguered online 
chaperone to do? Barbara J. Feldman, a San Diego-based newspaper columnist 
who writes a guide for parents on online safety (www.surfnetkids.com) 
and other issues, enforces one steadfast rule in the home she shares 
with her two teen-age children. ``I won't allow a computer with Internet 
access in a room where you can close the door, like in their bedrooms,'' 
she said. Ms. Feldman also periodically looks at the browser history 
files stored on the three computers in her house to check for visits 
to any Web sites she deems inappropriate. To do so for America Online 
running in Windows, go to Programs in the Start menu, choose Windows 
Explorer to find the Windows folder and then look at its History file. 
Mac users will find the History file in System Folder: Preferences: 
History. Most browsers also have History buttons, as well as Preference 
buttons, which let you determine how long Internet addresses stay 
in the folder. But the most important element in monitoring kids' 
online activity is to start out with a mutual agreement on a few ground 
rules, and then to stick to them. ``A certain level of trust has to 
be established,'' Ms. Feldman said. ``You have to have a discussion 
about what you expect their behavior to be, and they have to have 
a clear understanding about the fact that if they don't follow that 
behavior, they're going to lose access.''
