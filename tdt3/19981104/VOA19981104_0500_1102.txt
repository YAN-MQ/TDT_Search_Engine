US Men's Soccer team takes on Australia this week, in a friendly international 
match in San Jose, California. VOA's David Byrd reports that the game 
will be the first for new US coach, Bruce Arena. The 22 players available 
for Friday's match worked out in Palo Alto, California, Monday. Coach 
Bruce Areno was so satisfied with the players that he canceled the 
afternoon practice. Friday's match is Areno's first as head US National 
Team coach. He was serving as the coach of two-time major league soccer 
champ, DC United until his appointment in late October. Coach Areno 
says, that while he wants a win Friday, building a strong overall 
program is more important than a single result. Although we think 
Friday's game is important, we want to set the tone early, with the 
development of this program. And hopefully, head ourselves in the 
right direction so we can be successful in the year 2002. Coach Areno 
has added DC United defender Carlos Yamosa, and World Cup veteran 
Brian Maizanoff to the squad. His final roster will be announced Wednesday. 
In Washington I'm David Byrd, VOA Sports.
