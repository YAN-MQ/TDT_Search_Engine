A sinkhole 80 feet wide and 40 feet deep has opened up on a highway 
off ramp leading to Walt Disney world, Florida. The ramp was closed 
last night. Cars are being diverted to other Disney exits. The hole 
hasn't affected the highways. Sinkholes form when water wears away 
the soil and rock underground, leaving a hollow area.
