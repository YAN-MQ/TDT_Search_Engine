Thank you very much. When we come back here tonight, can the president 
expect any kind of political dividend? After all is said and done, 
what are the key stories as delivered by the voters last night? We're 
going to look at the election from three different angles of it in 
the harsh light of night this time. We'll talk in a moment to a veteran 
of the Washington political scene. We'll go to Wall Street and ask 
the question, is it really still the economy stupid? We begin with 
the opinion leaders.
