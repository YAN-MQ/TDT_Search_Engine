As soon as the clock on the wood-paneled wall struck 9 Tuesday night 
_ marking the close of polling across the state _ the volume of the 
television set at the American Legion hall here rose, and the nervous 
murmuring of the gathered D'Amato faithful died. This just in: The 
18-year tenure of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, Island Park's favorite son, 
had just ended. The more breathlessly the reporter on the fuzzy screen 
talked, the angrier the people in the hall became. Referring to D'Amato's 
opponent as ``Senator-elect Chuck Schumer'' really annoyed them. ``Shoot,'' 
some muttered; others used words that the occasionally profane D'Amato 
might have echoed. When the station returned to its regularly scheduled 
programming, few in the room knew what to say, so they just stared 
at a show called ``Just Shoot Me.'' Jacqueline Papatsos, the village's 
mayor, tapped a Styrofoam cup on a table. Edwin (Doc) McGann, the 
local Republican leader and a close friend of the senator's, stood 
frozen in the center of the room; hearing his nightmare being broadcast 
had left him temporarily paralyzed. When a young Republican jokingly 
asked whether he could still make some calls to potential voters, 
no one laughed. Up until the end, the people at the American Legion 
hall had done what they had been trained to do by the Nassau County 
Republican Committee operation, often called the best and most disciplined 
in the country: They got out the vote. With voter registration lists 
spread across fold-out tables, they drew red lines through the names 
of those who had voted and telephoned those who had not. Car rides 
were offered, as well as gentle reminders to do the right thing and 
vote. The village is so small, the practice so routine, that these 
phone conversations were often conducted on a first-name basis. Since 
this village of almost 5,000 is linked so inextricably to the senator 
that it is sometimes called D'Amatoville, their efforts might appear 
to be little more than Election Day busy work; after all, everyone 
knows that Island Park will vote D'Amato. The senator grew up here, 
began his political career here, still has family here. A large measure 
of his pothole-filling image comes from the attention he pays to Island 
Park and Long Island's southwestern shore. ``Call it nervous energy,'' 
said Michael McGinty, a local Republican leader. And so they worked 
into the night, blocking out the unsettling ``too close to call'' 
reports coming from the television, hearing in every train's wail 
the potential for more D'Amato voters about to be disgorged at the 
Long Island Rail Road station a few hundred feet away. They fueled 
themselves with chicken-and-salad dinners, sweetened by Entenmann's 
cakes and wines that pour from a box. Throughout the day, the friends 
and foes of D'Amato took comfort in whatever information they could 
glean. ``I talked to him this morning,'' Anthony Cornachio, a lawyer 
for the village and a close D'Amato ally, said at noon. ``He's on 
a high.'' But Annette Snow, perhaps D'Amato's most persistent critic, 
said she heard that the senator was seen crying in Oceanside. At 4 
p.m., the senator was spotted on Long Beach Road in the back seat 
of a town car, on a telephone, looking grim. Six hours later, McGann 
announced to those at the American Legion hall that he had just talked 
with the senator. ``He can't understand it,'' he said. ``His numbers 
show that he's 2 points up. We have to just sit and hope and pray. 
It's not dead yet!'' People cheered. But then, one by one, they filed 
out of the hall, seeking comfort from one another in remembrances 
of previous races that D'Amato had won against predictions. ``You 
just got to have faith,'' said Robert Tice, a red D'Amato hat resting 
on his head. ``But if the senator does lose, it'll be a black day 
for New York.'' With an envelope stuffed with computerized election 
results from Island Park, McGann left the hall at 10:30 to report 
to Republican headquarters in Westbury. ``It's over, I guess,'' he 
said. ``It's so hard figuring out.''
