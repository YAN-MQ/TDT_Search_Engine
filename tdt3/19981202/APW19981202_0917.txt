The French yogurt-maker Groupe Danone has begun building a dlrs 100 
million dairy plant near Moscow, a news report said Wednesday. The 
plant near Chekhov, a town 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Moscow, 
will employ 650 people and produce 150,000 tons of yogurt and other 
diary products each year after it is completed in 2000, the Interfax 
news agency reported. Danone is not the only yogurt-maker braving 
Russia's treacherous economy to build a dairy plant. Germany's Ehremann 
began building one in September, and the Netherlands' Campina is also 
planning one, the Moscow Times newspaper reported Wednesday. Danone 
Industry, a subsidiary of the French food giant, plans to invest dlrs 
2 million in its project before the end of this year, Interfax reported, 
citing the Chekhov region's top economic official, Vladimir Galdin. 
The plant is also expected to produce candy and mineral water, and 
the number of employees may gradually rise to 1,300, Galdin said. 
Groupe Danone already has a yogurt plant in the central Russian city 
of Togliatti and owns a 59 percent stake in Moscow's baked-goods factory 
Bolshevik.
