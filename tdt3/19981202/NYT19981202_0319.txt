At first it sounds like wind chimes in the cool breeze, the merry 
clink of scores of little hammers on big chunks of stone. But it is 
the sound of survival in this barren village, where entire families, 
from grandparents to grandchildren, earn a scant living by chipping 
and selling the rocks that lie buried around them. The more skilled 
among them use a chisel to fashion grinding stones for rice flour. 
Others _ particularly the children and the elderly _ hammer small 
stones into smaller ones to be sold as paving material. On a good 
day, a strong young man or woman can earn 80 cents or so. This is 
enough for two meals a day of rice or rice gruel, but not enough to 
buy radios or wristwatches or shoes. This is the way the people of 
Toul Dangkor have lived for generations, deep in the countryside 50 
miles north of Phnom Penh. They are among the rural poor who make 
up some 80 percent of Cambodia's 11 million people. It is the challenge 
of the country's newly installed leadership _ as it has been the failed 
challenge of its predecessors _ to address the hardships that make 
Cambodia one of the poorest nations in the world. Mer Thon, a 48-year-old 
villager, had a comment to make about the inauguration of a new Parliament 
the other day. ``I heard that Cambodia is stable now,'' he said. ``But 
here in the countryside it is not stable because there is nothing 
to eat. They are stable, but we have nothing.'' Another villager, 
Huy Oan, 41, said she had voted with optimism in the elections in 
July that produced the newly installed government. ``I wanted to have 
freedom and enough food and no war,'' she said. ``Especially food.'' 
But she said that although she was proud of her 8-year-old daughter, 
Nay Huoy (``She knows how to make rock''), she did not yet dare to 
hope for a better future for her. ``If there is no more war I have 
a little hope for her,'' Mrs. Huy Oan said. ``But if there's war, 
I have no hope.'' Decades of war, brutality and the rapaciousness 
of corrupt leaders have left the people of Cambodia so poor that King 
Norodom Sihanouk said last year that he feared a new peasant revolution. 
``The gap separating the rich and poor is becoming deeper and larger 
every day,'' he said. ``The social injustice is becoming more and 
more intolerable. There are villages where our compatriots are in 
rags and have nothing more to eat.'' With a new government in place, 
Cambodia has a chance for a fresh start. International donor groups 
are already stepping up their aid. But mismanagement and the country's 
widespread corruption remain major hurdles. And the problems are huge. 
``Everything you read about malnutrition, AIDS, poverty in general, 
about the degradation of the environment, is bleak reading indeed,'' 
a European diplomat said. And he noted that the government had yet 
to place its own priority on social welfare. About 50 percent of the 
national budget is spent on the military in a country that faces no 
external threat and, since the demise of the Khmer Rouge insurgency, 
no major internal challenge. Just 10.3 percent of the budget is spent 
on health care in a country where AIDS, malaria and dengue fever are 
rampant and where nearly half the population has no access to health 
services. And only 6 percent goes to education in a nation with one 
of the world's lowest literacy rates, about 32 percent. In a ``human 
development index'' calculating gross national product, life expectancy 
and literacy, the U.N. Development Project recently ranked Cambodia 
at 140 out of 174 countries. Life expectancy for men has fallen to 
just 50 years, according to recent U.N. figures. Half the children 
under 5 are malnourished. This national portrait is evident in Toul 
Dangkor, where there is no nearby school or clinic, no well, no electricity 
and no paved road and where villagers reacted with awe and perplexity 
when handed newspapers and magazines. The children are thin and underweight, 
barefoot and coughing. A number died in a recent outbreak of dengue 
fever, the villagers said. But the children earn their keep. As soon 
as they can heft a hammer, usually at age 7 or 8, they are put to 
work. It is not as if the people here have been forgotten by the government. 
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who has just been named the new speaker 
of the National Assembly, put Toul Dangkor on his itinerary last spring 
in his failed campaign to become prime minister. ``I remember when 
Ranariddh came,'' said the villager named Mer Thon. ``He gave out 
T-shirts and cotton scarves. Then he left us and never came back, 
and nothing has changed.''
