Police in Australia are in a state of alert after they discovered 
25 letter bombs. Hugh Williams reports, a chance discovery may have 
saved lives. a letter bomb campaign, targeting Australian tax office 
staff and their families, was discovered early Wednesday when a package 
detonated in a postal sorting center near the nation's capital, Canberra. 
The package, addressed to an Australian taxation office, or ato official, 
exploded near two postal workers who were slightly injured. Police 
say a search of the facility uncovered more than 20 other similar 
devices packed in small boxes, all addressed to the personal residences 
of taxation office workers. Two other similar letter bombs were found 
in Sydney, and one in Melbourne, although police say they cannot confirm 
a connection between the Sydney and melbourne bombs and tax office 
employees. An alert has been issued to the 17,000 ato staff and their 
families across australia, warning them to be on the lookout for packages 
described as the same size as a computer diskette box wrapped in a 
white envelope. The tax office says they are very concerned at the 
security breach that allowed their staffs' personal addresses to be 
accessed. The Australian post office has begun an intensive screening 
process to see if they can find any more devices, which police describe 
as very sophisticated and potentially lethal. Hugh Williams, for CNN, 
Sydney, Australia.
