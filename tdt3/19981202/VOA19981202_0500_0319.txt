President Clinton meets today at the White House with Pakistan's Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif for talks expected to focus on economic and 
security issues. Mr. Clinton announced Tuesday a partial waiver of 
sanctions imposed against Pakistan and India after they carried out 
rival nuclear tests in May. The agenda for the talks is likely to 
include nuclear-related issues and ways to ease tensions between Pakistan 
and India over the disputed Kashmir region. I'm Bill Hazerd, VOA News.
