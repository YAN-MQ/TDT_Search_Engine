"CNN headlines sports" is next. And coming up -- visit a country store 
that refuses to be swept aside by urban growth. Hi, I'm expecting 
a fax. Room 212 wants the ammunitionto deal with her toughest clients. 
Nothing? Davies, 212. I called earlier. Right, fax. It hasn't come 
yet. I need it for a meeting. Excuse me, miss Davies? It just came 
in. Thank you, so much. Good morning, everyone. Business services 
by Marriott. Now for "diskette world" travel news -- notebook computers 
are traveling lighter with built-in superdisk drives. Only the superdisk 
drive works with both regular floppies and 120-megabyte superdisk 
diskettes. Floppies everywhere are thrilled because a built-in superdisk 
is two drives in one, and other drives are on the way out. We can 
save a little. superdisk can save a lot. Together, we can save the 
world. Get it in gateway notebooks and desktops. The day we started 
business, we had over 30 years experience as the world leader in satellite 
services and systems. We are the world leader in digital satellite 
television. And, the world's leading provider of private business 
networks. Introducing Hughes, a familiar name with a brand new focus. 
When you need the best in satellite and wireless communications. We 
make it happen.
