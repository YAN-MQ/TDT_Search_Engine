President Clinton and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif have held 
crucial talks on reducing the threat of nuclear war in South Asia. 
As Mr. Sharif left the White House, he said the talks focused on the 
India-Pakistan dispute over the Kashmir region and U.S. concerns about 
nuclear arms tests conducted by India and Pakistan. Correspondent 
Debra Tate reports. Mr. Clinton wants India and Pakistan, which each 
conducted nuclear tests last May, to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty as they have indicated they would do. At the start of his meeting 
with Mr. Sharif, Mr. Clinton said nonproliferation would be a key 
topic of discussion. All of you know my concern to do everything we 
can to end the nuclear competition in South Asia which I believe is 
a threat to Pakistan and India and to the stability of the world. 
Mr. Clinton also said he and Mr. Sharif would try to resolve a dispute 
over a canceled sale of U.S. fighter aircraft. U.S. officials say 
they are working on a plan to return some of the $658 million Pakistan 
paid for U.S. made F-16 jets that Islamabad never received. The delivery 
was blocked under a 1990 law barring direct U.S. military sales to 
Pakistan because of its development of nuclear weapons. Debra Tate, 
VOA News at the White House.
