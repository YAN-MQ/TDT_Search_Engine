In Washington today, a huge legal victory for a former member of the 
clinton administration. Former agriculture secretary Mike Espy was 
found not guilty on 30 counts of corruption. He was charged with accepting 
illegal gifts -- sports tickets and travel -- from companies that 
did business with the government. Mr. Espy was forced to resign in 
1994 over the allegations. Independent counsel Donald smaltz spent 
four years and $17 million on the investigation. Mr. Espy had this 
to say about his battle against the independent counsel. Stand up 
to the schoolyard bullies whether they're in the public courtroom 
or whether they have 5 cents or $20 million. If you're not guilty, 
you should say so and you should not quit. If our investigation and 
prosecutions dissuade cooperations from giving gifts to their regulators 
and I believe that the costs we have incurred are worth the price. 
Mr. smaltz was able to convict some of the companies and lobbyists 
that gave things to Espy. President Clinton said today he was pleased 
by the jury's verdict and that espy had deserved the country with 
distinction.
