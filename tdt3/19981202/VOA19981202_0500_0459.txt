The separatist Kosovo Liberation Army says it may be willing to accept 
a compromise to end the conflict in their homeland. However, they 
insist that it be only a temporary measure leading to independence 
in three years. The KLA reportedly will meet with the U.S. special 
envoy late this week to discuss a draft proposal on Kosovo. Meanwhile, 
nearly 75,000 ethnic Albanians who have returned to their homes in 
Kosovo are facing a grueling winter. Phillip Smucker visited the village 
of Branoff, which was known in the past as a center of guerrilla activity, 
and he filed this report. Nearly 250,000 ethnic Albanians fled their 
homes in Kosovo to escape the fighting between Serbian security forces 
and Albanian guerrillas. About 175 of them, fearing police roundups 
and harsh winter conditions have not returned home. They live with 
relatives or abroad. The other 75,000 have returned to their homes, 
but U.N. refugee officials say that $50 million in assistance for 
the displaced ethnic Albanians is not meeting all their needs. It 
nearly 850 of the towns 1,000 residents have returned. They are trying 
to rebuild at least one room in each house to make it livable. In 
one home, the Krosnicki family huddles around a stove to keep warm 
with a sick grandfather and a new born child. A son complains that 
if he tries to go down the road to buy medicine for his father's chronic 
bronchitis, he will be arrested as a terrorist suspect. Already, eight 
village men have been charged and are awaiting trial in nearby Pech. 
The son, Kadri Krosnicki, says villagers feel defenseless and are 
waiting for NATO to arrive to help them. Mr. Krosnicki says the villagers 
need help from western countries and from NATO. He says they want 
NATO forces in Kosovo. Branoff was well-known as a center of guerrilla 
activity this past summer. Guerrilla fighters still linger in the 
nearby forests regrouping and planning for more fighting. Several 
former villagers now living in the United States are known as financial 
backers of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army or KLA, but villagers 
say the benefactors are giving them humanitarian assistance in addition 
to help with their self-defense forces. Phillip Smucker for VOA News
