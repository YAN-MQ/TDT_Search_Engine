Tonight "the fleecing of America" as uncovered by federal auditors. 
This is a story about milk, that icon of wholesomeness. There was 
a time in America when milk was the drink, but then soft drinks, bottled 
water and fancy juices began to move in. So the milk industry decided 
to strike back. But what kind of deal did it strike, at your expense? 
NBC's Andrea Mitchell. It's a giant and expensive ad campaign intended 
to produce a cash cow for the milk industry. It's the celebrity milk 
mustache, selling milk by trying to make it cool. The ads themselves 
are so popular, they've been turned into posters. Teens collect them. 
And celebrities like Pete Sampras even ask to be included. Milk was 
seen as stodgy and dull, "I don't want to be seen with it." Today 
it's hip, its cool, its in, so we know that it has worked. But are 
they really selling more milk? People love the ads. But after four 
years and at least $169 million, people are drinking even less milk 
than before the catchy campaign started. Government statistics show 
more than 4% less. And who pays for the ads indirectly? you do. Everyone 
who drinks milk pays roughly 2 cents a gallon, passed along by the 
industry to you the consumer. In 1990, the milk industry asked Congress 
to help stop a 30-year decline in sales. So Congress ordered the dept 
of agriculture to create and oversee an industry board to promote 
milk. But now a new government audit finds serious problems with the 
way the industry has run the campaign. A great deal of the money was 
basically misused, and that's got to be stopped. As for the ads themselves, 
the audit says the board paid $2.7 million for the mustache pictures 
shot by celebrity photographer annie liebowitz. But the board didn't 
even get the right to own or reuse them without paying more, a violation 
of government rules. The audit recommends suspending the whole campaign 
until the government tightens its controls. It's agriculture's responsibility 
to monitor this, and they have to play by our rules. And quite frankly, 
they're not playing by the rules. The agriculture department says 
it will fix the problems. The industry calls all this "nitpicking," 
says the ads have improved the "Image" of milk, and without them, 
people would drink even less of it. You've got colas and juices out 
there and they are spending like crazy. They sometimes outspend us 
ten to one. We can not let up. Still, while most people agree that 
the ads are fun, some might call this a "fleecing of America." Others 
would just say you got milked! Andrea Mitchell, NBC news, Washington.
