Janice, thanks. When we come back this Wednesday evening, what the 
Thursday morning "New York Times" is reporting about safety and young 
children and what may be 3u9 putting them at risk. There was a time 
when memories were painful. They just reminded me of how far away 
I was from feeling like myself. I couldn't get out of bed. I was always 
tired. I hardly ate. I stopped wanting to be around people. Sometimes, 
I felt like, "what's the use?" My friends, they'd say, "cheer up. 
You have everything." But I was so depressed, I couldn't snap out 
of it. You can't just snap out of clinical depression. No one can 
because it's a real illness with real causes. But you can get your 
life back. A first step is giving us a call. We'll send you a free, 
confidential information kit... with facts about depression and treatment 
that's worked for millions... and a symptoms checklist that can make 
it easier... to talk with a doctor about how you're feeling. Now, 
I already have my wish. I have my life back.
