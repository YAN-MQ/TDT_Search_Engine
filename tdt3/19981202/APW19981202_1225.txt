The Israeli government said Wednesday that it was suspending troop 
withdrawals until the Palestinians comply with a list of demands that 
includes a promise to publicly abandon plans to unilaterally declare 
statehood in May. Palestinian officials rejected the demands outright 
and charged that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was looking 
for excuses to knock the peace process off track. An Israeli government 
statement said its decision was prompted in part by the attack on 
an Israeli soldier and civilian by an angry Palestinian mob in the 
city of Ramallah in the West Bank earlier Wednesday. The decision 
came only 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to arrive 
in the region to usher in stage two of the Wye River land-for-security 
agreement he helped negotiate in October. The Israeli announcement 
that it was suspending further troop withdrawals from the West Bank 
and implementation of the accord raised questions about whether the 
Clinton trip could take place while Israel was holding-up the agreement. 
``Mr. Netanyahu is trying to create a crisis before the arrival of 
President Clinton. We consider his conditions unacceptable. Every 
day he imposes new conditions, this is an attitude that must not continue, 
it will not be tolerated,'' said senior Palestinian official Saeb 
Erekat. The conditions also drew a sharp reaction from the United 
States. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin 
said the Israeli troop withdrawals were obligations which Israel must 
carry out. ``We do not think it is appropriate to add new conditions,'' 
Rubin said. He also condemned the attack. The attack in Ramallah overshadowed 
the stabbing death earlier Wednesday of an Arab street cleaner in 
Jerusalem, apparently by an Israeli extremist. During the funeral 
procession for Osama Natche, a 41-year-old father of six, mourners 
torched an Israeli car and stoned Israeli police who fired rubber 
bullets. Hours later, rioting throughout traditionally Arab areas 
of Jerusalem continued, with masked Palestinians throwing stones at 
cars and blocking roads with burning tires. Jerusalem police spokesman 
Shmuel Ben Ruby said five Palestinians were arrested for throwing 
stones that shattered a bus window and injured the driver. Israel 
and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the violence. 
The ambush of two motorists in Ramallah, captured by cameras, was 
shown over and over on Israeli television, leading some Israelis to 
wonder whether the Palestinian Authority was trying to control violence, 
as it pledged to do in the U.S.-brokered Wye River land-for-peace 
agreement. In the attack, dozens of Palestinian university students 
waited at a traffic circle, holding rocks and concrete slabs. They 
screened cars. ``Wait, it's an Arab,'' one said of the driver in an 
approaching car. ``A Jew,'' another said. Seconds later, a hail of 
stones hit the vehicle. A young Israeli soldier was dragged from the 
car and struck repeatedly in the head with rocks as he held his hands 
up to defend himself. The political response was swift. ``The bottom 
line is that there will be no further withdrawals unless the Palestinian 
Authority lives up to all its commitments,'' said Netanyahu's senior 
adviser, David Bar-Illan. ``Israel demands, 13th graf pvs
