Chile's foreign minister on Wednesday returned from European visits 
cautiously optimistic about efforts to persuade Britain to release 
former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who is wanted for trial in 
Spain. But, Jose Miguel Insulza said Chileans' polarization about 
the 83-year-old former dictator was undermining his diplomatic efforts. 
``It is very difficult to make these efforts abroad when the messages 
coming from Chile are so contradictory,'' Insulza said upon his return 
from Madrid and London. Still, Insulza said he returned ``with a cautiously 
positive view of the efforts we have made and the ones we still have 
to make.'' Pinochet is under police custody in London awaiting a decision 
by Home Secretary Jack Straw on whether he will be extradited to Spain 
to face charges of genocide and torture. Straw has until Dec. 12 to 
make a decision. The government and the right-wing insist Pinochet 
should be released, saying foreign courts have no business dealing 
with events in Chile. Leftists and human rights advocates support 
the arrest and eventual trial in Spain of Pinochet. A Chilean government 
report concluded that 3,197 people _ including Spaniards and other 
foreigners _ were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's rule from 
1973-1990. The democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, 
died in a 1973 coup Pinochet helped lead. Based on a Spanish warrant, 
Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in a central London hospital where he 
had undergone back surgery. Insulza says Pinochet can indeed be tried 
in Chile, where he enjoys diplomatic immunity as senator for life. 
Insulza criticized three congressmen of his own Socialist Party who 
sent a letter to Straw saying Pinochet's release would ensure his 
impunity. ``It is very important that Chileans understand that the 
problem is the lack of agreement among them,'' Insulza said.
