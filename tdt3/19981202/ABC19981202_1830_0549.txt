Overseas -- Israel said tonight it will call off all further troop 
withdrawals, after a particularly violent episode on the West Bank. 
Palestinian students were protesting Israel's refusal to release more 
prisoners when a car with Israeli license plates showed up. The students 
ambushed the car. An Israeli soldier was trapped inside. The students 
beat him, stole his assault rifle and wrecked his car. The soldier 
eventually limped away.
