England stand-off Paul Grayson has failed to recover from a knee injury 
and will miss Saturday's Test against South Africa at Twickenham. 
Grayson, who limped off during last weekend's 12-11 defeat to Australia, 
will be replaced by Mike Catt. But England coach Clive Woodward said 
Wednesday that Catt will not assume Grayson's goal-kicking duties. 
Catt failed to convert the only try against Australia, allowing the 
Wallabies to pull out a late victory. Instead, Matt Dawson will do 
the goal-kicking Saturday. Nick Beal comes in at fullback for Matt 
Perry, who suffered a concussion against the Wallabies and will be 
sidelined for three weeks. Woodward also brought in Dan Luger at the 
expense of out-of-form Austin Healey. Will Greenwood, like Grayson, 
has not recovered from a recent groin injury and is out. That means 
Phil de Glanville will continue in the center. The Springboks will 
set a world record of 18 consecutive Test victories if they beat England 
on Saturday. They would eclipse the New Zealand All Blacks' 17-match 
winning streak between 1965 and 1969.
