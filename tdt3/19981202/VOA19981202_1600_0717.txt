A group calling itself the Black Tigers says it has declared war on 
the government of Swaziland, the southern African kingdom recently 
rocked by bomb attacks. Alex Belida reports from our Southern Africa 
bureau. The Black Tigers say that what they term fear and terror will 
reign in Swaziland unless there is political change. In a message 
to the "Times of Swaziland" newspaper, the group claims responsibility 
for a bomb attack last month on the office of the country's deputy 
prime minister in which a security guard was killed. The group warns 
of more such attacks unless King Mswati and his government reviewed 
the decree banning political parties in Swaziland. The message threatens 
members of the Cabinet and says the country's prime minister received 
a warning from the Tigers six months ago. There has been no immediate 
response from the government other than to say investigations into 
last month's explosion and two other recent bomb attacks are continuing. 
Reports from the Swazi capital, Mbabane, say police recently raided 
the homes of trade union and opposition leaders in connection with 
the bombings. The opposition has denied having any hand in the attacks 
and dismisses the police raids as harassment. The bombings have led 
to stepped up security at government buildings around Swaziland, Sub 
Saharan Africa's last traditional monarchy. Alex Belida, VOA News, 
Southern Africa bureau.
