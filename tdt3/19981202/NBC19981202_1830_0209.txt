The timing of the not guilty verdict was especially welcome at the 
White House, where President Clinton was said to be extremely pleased. 
And why not? He's about to launch his own high-profile counterattack 
against independent counsel Ken Starr and the house Judiciary committee, 
considering impeachment proceedings against him. NBC's Claire Shipman 
is at the White House. Claire? Tom, the White House has sent a letter 
tonight to house Judiciary chair henry Hyde saying White House lawyers 
will in fact take advantage of an offer to defend the president in 
person next week. And in fact, they say they may still call more witnesses, 
but behind the scenes, aides and lawyers are frustrated with the broadening 
inquiry. They say it's making it impossible for the White House to 
have a coherent strategy. The letter to Hyde reads -- we will, of 
course, accept your invitation to appear before the committee. But 
the president's lawyers also say, to prepare adequately and to represent 
the president on these matter, we must have access to certain core 
materials. They want materials from the Starr referral, Kathleen Willey 
and campaign finance. Meanwhile, a federal judge today allowed two 
house impeachment investigators to take a look at controversial justice 
department memos on another subject, campaign finance. All the while, 
the president insisting he had no time to worry about the wider search 
for wrong-doing. The Congress in the end has to make its own decision 
about what to do and how to conduct itself. It's important for me 
to get on with the work of the country." But despite the president's 
calm, the White House is growing increasingly worried as it hears 
more and more moderate republicans in the house say they would vote 
to impeach. Now, aides here think the president would win in the Senate, 
but they want this to end in the house and they want it to end soon. 
Still, there's also some talk around here that there might be benefits 
to delaying the house vote until next year when there will be more 
democrats in session. But of course, the White House could do very 
little about the timing. tom? Thanks very much, Claire Shipman at 
the White House tonight.
