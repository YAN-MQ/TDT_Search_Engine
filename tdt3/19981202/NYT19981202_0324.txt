Now the lies. I got a call at my hotel a little after 9 p.m. Monday 
from Ronnie Earle, the district attorney of Travis County. I had spoken 
to him earlier in the evening but now there was a heightened urgency 
to his tone. ``There are things you don't know about this case, that 
you haven't been privy to,'' he said. He was talking about Lacresha 
Murray. Now 14, Lacresha is serving a sentence of 25 years for the 
beating death in 1996 of 2{-year-old Jayla Belton. I have been writing 
columns about the two convictions (the first was thrown out) that 
Earle's office managed to get against Lacresha without the benefit 
of any witnesses or physical evidence linking her to the child's death. 
Earle is an affable politician, cooperative and readily accessible. 
But you can almost feel him steaming over the suggestion that his 
office, through negligence or incompetence or worse, had driven an 
innocent child into prison. ``If you had all the facts,'' he said, 
``you might change your mind.'' Now, with the trials long over and 
Lacresha sent off to the Giddings State Home and School, Earle was 
calling to say for the first time that Lacresha's own grandparents 
had told authorities they were afraid to leave small children with 
her because she was ``so rough with them.'' He said one of his top 
aides recalled that the grandparents, R.L. and Shirley Murray, who 
are Lacresha's adoptive parents, had expressed very specific concerns 
about the threat Lacresha posed. This was news to me. I had never 
heard that Lacresha's grandparents thought she was dangerous. I asked 
the DA why this had never come up in our previous conversations, including 
an extensive telephone interview I did two weeks ago with him and 
the aide, Assistant District Attorney Gary Cobb. ``In the first place 
I didn't know it,'' Earle said. He said it was Cobb who had clued 
him in, that it was Cobb who knew all the details. ``I had only passing 
familiarity with this,'' said Earle. He said Cobb probably hadn't 
mentioned it because he was not comfortable dealing with the press. 
I immediately got in touch with Keith Hampton, the scrupulous, straightforward 
young lawyer who is handling Lacresha's appeal. When I told him of 
Earle's comments, he said: ``It's fiction as far as I know. And the 
timing of this revelation suggests its improbability.'' Hampton said 
he had studied the records from both trials and anything of that nature 
would ``stand out in my mind. It doesn't.'' Shirley Murray, when asked 
about the DA's comments, said: ``That's not true. We never did leave 
the children with Lacresha because she was just 11 years old. But 
I would have trusted her with any child.'' R.L. Murray said, ``I never 
said anything like that.'' By Wednesday the district attorney was 
backtracking. He said he thought his comments had been off the record. 
(They weren't.) He said he had not expected his comments to be taken 
as ``specific facts.'' He said, ``I was not trying to give you a verbatim 
rendition of anything.'' Meanwhile, his staff had spent the previous 
36 hours trying to find anything similar to what their boss had said 
on Monday. They came up with a signed statement from R.L. Murray, 
who was grilled intensely by the police soon after Jayla's death. 
Murray knew at the time that he and Lacresha were potential suspects. 
He said of Lacresha: ``In the past Lacresha has been with small children. 
I have never seen her abuse children.'' He said he had seen children 
a couple of times with bruises that he described in the statement 
as ``suspicious.'' But he did not attribute those bruises to Lacresha. 
He said that if Lacresha had, in fact, killed Jayla he would want 
to see her ``get some help.'' The truth in Travis County is elusive. 
Earle's reckless assertion Monday night, in keeping with his office's 
attempts from the beginning to portray Lacresha as an 11-year-old 
monster, turned out not to be true. It wasn't the first time that 
bad information had come out of his office. It was just the latest 
desperate attempt to justify a case that wasn't even put together 
with smoke and mirrors, just smoke.
