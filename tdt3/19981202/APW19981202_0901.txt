Russia's cash-starved government is offering financial aid to Central 
American countries devastated by Hurricane Mitch, a news report said 
Wednesday. Russia's Finance Ministry will send aid for the affected 
countries to a special United Nations bank account in Geneva, Vasily 
Gromov, director of the Foreign Ministry's Latin America department, 
told the Interfax news agency. The report did not say how much money 
Russia would offer. The country is mired in its worst economic crisis 
since the 1991 Soviet collapse and owes billions of dollars to workers, 
pensioners and foreign creditors. Russian leaders are lobbying for 
more aid themselves from international lenders. More than 9,000 people 
were killed in the hurricane last month, most in Honduras. Thousands 
more were missing and more than a million people were left homeless.
