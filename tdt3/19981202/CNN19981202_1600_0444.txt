The weather's been so warm lately, ski resort operators are getting 
nervous. Record high temperatures have been recorded from the Rockies 
to New England. It reached 58 degrees in Boston yesterday. Ice skaters 
on Boston common were able to roll up their sleeves, though it was 
still pretty windy. The first 11 months of this year have been the 
warmest on record in the northeast. And there's no snow to report 
in snowbelt states like Ohio. Temperatures have been as much as 20 
degrees warmer than normal.
