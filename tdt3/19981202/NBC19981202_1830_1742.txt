That is "Nightly News" for Wednesday. Don't forget "Dateline" at 9:00, 
8:00 central. I'm Tom Brokaw. We leave you with a look at the masses 
gathered just outside our doors, waiting for the lighting tonight 
just before 9:00 on NBC of the Rockefeller center Christmas tree. 
See you back here tomorrow night.
