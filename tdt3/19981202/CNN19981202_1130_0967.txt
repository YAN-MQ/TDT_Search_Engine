The world's largest aircraft maker sharpens its ax. I'm Myron Kandel 
in New York with this edition of "Dollars & Sense." Boeing sounds 
an earnings alert and plans massive job cuts. It has reduced its profit 
forecast for next year by 25% to $IS.5 billion. It's scaling back 
production of its 747s, 757s, and 767s jets. Boeing blames the economic 
slowdown in Asia and for employees, Boeing says it's slashing the 
workforce by 20,000 more employees on top of the 28,000 it said it 
was cutting back in July. Combined, that's about 20% of Boeing's global 
workforce.
