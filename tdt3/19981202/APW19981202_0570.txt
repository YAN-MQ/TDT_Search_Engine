Willi Reimann resigned Wednesday as coach of the struggling Bundesliga 
club Nuremberg, saying he wanted to devote more time to caring for 
his ill wife. The resignation came as a surprise, although the coach 
had come under fire since the club has gone six Bundesliga games without 
a win. ``My wife is seriously ill and she needs my care,'' Reimann 
said. Reimann, 48, was fired from Wolfsburg last season and took over 
at Nuremberg shortly before the season. Nuremberg, with a long Bundesliga 
tradition, gained promotion this season. ``We have to accept his decision. 
It's especially tragic, because his wife is ill,'' Nuremberg president 
Michael Roth said. Assistant coach Thomas Brunner will take over as 
head coach for the time being.
