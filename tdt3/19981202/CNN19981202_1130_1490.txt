At 80 degrees and sunny most of the time, it's not exactly a winter 
wonderland. But as Gloria Hillard reports, 'tis still the season in 
Hollywood. In Hollywood, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. 
Santa!? Oh by golly have a holly Jolly -- have a showbiz kind of Christmas 
And what would a showbiz kind of Christmas be without stars in convertibles 
in the Hollywood Christmas parade? And in the Beverly Hills Christmas 
parade, it was -- Happy holiday Barbie! This is the happy holiday 
Barbie doll, and this is the happy holiday Barbie, in person. I think 
I like her hair better this way. Joining Barbie in the Beverly Hills 
parade were the marching shopping bags. Well, it was rodeo drive, 
after all. But I noticed they made an appearance in the Hollywood 
Christmas parade, as well. A showbiz style of Christmas That would 
mean that fellow in red. We have santas, too -- this Santa was serving 
up cookies and hot chocolate to kids at universal. Now, this little 
girl didn't seem to care that it was 80 degrees and sunny. I'm just 
here for acting. And there's like no snow. That's the truth. We have 
special sunglasses made for you, honey. Oh, good! And in no time, 
Santa was upstaged by this guy. Now, for the uninitiated, furby is 
the latest hard-to-find hot Christmas toy that talks incessantly. 
He just said, "my name is cocoa." And he's kind of a cross between 
a cat -- Well, it's got bird eyes. Penguin. Yeah, Penguin, Penguin. 
They did take an interest in our microphone, though -- wow! wow! Have 
a showbiz kind of Christmas -- especially for those New York rockettes 
making their L.A. debut. At least they didn't have to put on a coat 
for the photo op. From high-kicking rockettes to tiny santas in the 
chorus -- that's the jingle bell rock With our decorator palm trees, 
our stars and our santas, and we may not have snow, but soap flakes 
are just as good, as long as it doesn't rain. Gloria Hillard, "CNN 
Entertainment News," Los Angeles.
