First, though, let's get an update on sports from Steve Schy. Thank 
you very much. American swimmer Jenny Thompson has set a new world 
short course record at the Swimming World Cup in College Station, 
Texas. Thompson swam the 100 meter butterfly race in 56.90 seconds 
Tuesday night. That is.89 of a second faster than her old mark. Thompson 
also swam the 50 meter freestyle race in 24.56 seconds, breaking the 
U.S. record in a 25 meter pool by.22 of a second. In the men's competition, 
Jeremy Lynn set an American record in the 50 meter breast stroke, 
finishing in 27.11 seconds. Gary Hall, Jr., who fought a court battle 
to compete after testing positive for marijuana earlier this year, 
finished 13th in the 100 meter freestyle race and 11th in the 50 meter 
butterfly.
