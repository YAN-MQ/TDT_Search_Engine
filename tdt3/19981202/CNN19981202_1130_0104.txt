Boeing executives are giving employees more details about did company's 
latest massive layoff via a conference call. Employees will be getting 
a better sense of who will be the 20,000 to lose their jobs. Boeing 
says the cuts are needed because troubles in Asia mean fewer airlines 
will be buying new jets. Some workers say the cuts go with the industry. 
It's a hard bullet to bite, but it has to be bitten. I think it will 
be a lot of small mom and pop stores, bars, places around town that 
will probably close. It's a cyclical business. People who work here 
need to know that. In the end, the jobs aren't ever secure. The news 
is the second blow for Boeing workers this July. It decided to cut 
28,000 jobs.
