Well, there are far worse places to be a prisoner of war than Seattle, 
Washington, if you can picture that up in our northeast part of the 
- northwest part of the United States. Hans Schmitt rather liked it. 
Last month, the mayor of Seattle, Paula Schell, received a letter 
from Mr. Schmitt who lives at Kercham, Germany. Mr. Schmitt wrote 
that he was grateful for the way that he was treated in Seattle when 
he was a prisoner of war at the end of World War II. He said in his 
letter, "The people of Seattle were very nice." He said they were 
very friendly even if the U.S. and Germany were enemies during those 
dark days. He also said that German prisoners of war were well fed 
in America, even while many people in Germany were starving during 
the last years of the war. Enclosed in Hans Schmitt's letter were 
two 50 dollar bills. The letter said, "I would like to say thank you 
for my good times in Seattle. Please give the amount to a family in 
Seattle with children." Mayor Schell says the $100 would be donated 
to a needy family for Christmas.
