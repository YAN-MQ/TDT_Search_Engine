Dade county in Florida is bringing back a gay rights ordinance. The 
county commission voted 7-6 yesterday to ban discrimination based 
on sexual orientation. 20 years ago, Anita Bryant helped repeal a 
similar measure. At the time, it was one of the first in the nation 
to extend such rights to homosexuals.
