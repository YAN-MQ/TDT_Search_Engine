Scientists at Penn State University have come up with a provocative 
explanation of how glaciers could have once formed at the equator. 
NPR's Joe Palka has more. The explanation is based on how far the 
Earth tilts on its orbit around the sun. Right now it tilts about 
23 degrees. So in summer the northern hemisphere leans toward the 
sun. And in winter it leans away. The new theory says that 600 million 
years ago, the Earth tilted more than 54 degrees. At that great a 
tilt, the equator becomes the coldest place on Earth. Not the poles. 
The theory says that the Earth was pulled back to its more upright 
23 degrees by the gravitational tug of the sun and the moon. But for 
the theory to work, the continents would have had to be closer to 
the equator than they are today. And glaciers must have covered those 
continents. The research appears in the current issue of the journal, 
Nature. Joe Palka, NPR News, Washington.
