Biota Holdings Ltd. said Wednesday that its collaborator, Biostar 
Inc., had received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration 
to begin marketing the first rapid diagnostic test kit for flu. Biostar, 
based in Boulder, Colo., will market the kit in the United States, 
Europe and New Zealand, sharing profits with Biota, a biotech company 
based in Melbourne, Australia. Biostar has not yet set a price for 
the test, which can be performed in doctors' offices in less than 
15 minutes, using samples from saliva, mucus or a throat swab. Biota 
said clinical studies showed the test's sensitivity approached or 
surpassed conventional methods that can take several days to provide 
results. Although there would be some benefit now for patients to 
know whether their symptoms are from flu or a common cold, the real 
significance of the test will come next year with the expected approval 
of new influenza drugs.
