A strong earthquake toppled more than 8,000 buildings in the impoverished 
hills of China's rural southwest, leaving 20,000 people homeless, 
a local official said Wednesday. Few injuries and no deaths have been 
reported from the magnitude-5.1 quake that struck Yunnan province's 
Xuanwei county Tuesday shortly after 3:30 p.m. _ when farmers were 
in the fields and students on recess, said Wei Hui of the local Civil 
Affairs Bureau. The quake was the third to strike Yunnan in two weeks. 
Authorities are struggling to treat the 4,000 injured and house and 
care for the 25,000 people left homeless by a pair of powerful quakes 
on Nov. 20 in the Ninglang region, 300 kilometers (180 miles) west 
of Xuanwei. Among the 8,000 buildings that collapsed in Xuanwei, many 
belonged to poor farming families scattered across 24 villages, said 
Wei. He added that some families lost many of their pigs and cows. 
Many buildings including those in the county seat were cracked or 
listing and will have to be pulled down, said Wei. Yunnan Vice Gov. 
Niu Shaoyao, who was in Xuanwei inspecting the aftermath of a coal 
mine accident that killed 38 miners Sunday, joined local authorities 
in checking on rescue and repair efforts. In mountainous Ninglang, 
many of those left homeless by the quakes two weeks ago are suffering 
through nights of freezing temperatures in huts of wood and plastic 
sheeting. Small town hospitals have set up makeshift wards in parking 
lots to cope with the hordes of injured. ``The government is doing 
a pretty good job distributing rice, basic food and some blankets,'' 
Odilon Couzin of Doctors Without Borders told Associated Press Television 
News in a tour of the disaster area earlier this week. ``What we are 
mostly worried about is the weather, because it can get very, very 
cold here and once it starts snowing the road can be blocked and the 
people will have nothing,'' Couzin said. In almost every village in 
the mountainous area near the Sichuan border, a few mud, brick and 
wood houses collapsed. Despite the widespread devastation, only five 
people are reported to have died in the twin quakes. Villagers said 
the quakes' timing _ a 5-magnitude shock followed by a 6.2-magnitude 
wallop _ kept casualties down. ``When the first one struck we all 
ran out of the house. Then the second one hit, and it was then that 
the house collapsed,'' said one woman, a member of China's Yi minority, 
as she squatted by her ruined home in Lan Yiqing Valley.
