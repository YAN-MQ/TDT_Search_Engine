Police officers with high-tech equipment began scanning a huge garbage 
dump outside the northern city of Parma on Wednesday in search of 
the bodies of a family killed in 1989. The eldest son, Ferdinando 
Carretta, surfaced recently, then confessed to killing his mother, 
father and younger brother. His confession put to rest one of Italy's 
longest-running missing-persons mysteries. Carretta, 36, said he shot 
his family in their apartment in Parma, then buried the bodies on 
the banks of a river outside the city. The area is now a huge garbage 
dump, which complicates the search, and police technicians were using 
instruments designed to find buried organic material. Police were 
also searching for the murder weapon; Carretta has said he threw it 
in a canal. The Carretta family was last seen on the night of Aug. 
4, 1989, getting ready to leave on vacation in their camper. The abandoned 
camper was found months later, but there was no sign of the family. 
Carretta turned up in London when police stopped him for a routine 
traffic violation. Shortly afterward, he confessed on-camera to an 
Italian TV program on missing persons and returned voluntarily to 
Italy on Sunday, where he was arrested on charges of triple homicide. 
Police say Carretta has shown them the general area where he buried 
the bodies.
