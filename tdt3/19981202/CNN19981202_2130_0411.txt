President Clinton says patients in managed health care plans need 
a Bill of rights to make sure they're treated like people, not dollar 
signs. He says Senate minority leader Tom Daschle is reaching out 
to republicans to find a way to get the patients' Bill of rights through 
Congress next year. Now the time has come for Congress to do its part 
to give all Americans the protections of the patients' Bill of rights. 
With senator Daschle and his colleagues leading the way, we will make 
this not a democratic issue or a republican issue, but an American 
issue. The president says voters have sent a clear message they want 
Washington to address issues like health care and not to be distracted 
by partisan squabbling.
