the national rifle association says the fbi is violating gun owners' 
privacy. it has filed a suit to stop the agency from keeping records 
from new instant background checks. an nra spokesman says keeping 
the records would create a national registry of gun owners, which 
federal law does not allow. the fbi says the records will only provide 
data for statistical sampling and internal audits.
