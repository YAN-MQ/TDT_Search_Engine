Johannesburg's Ellis Park was selected Wednesday as the vene for the 
1999 rugby league World Nines. The Rugby League International Federation 
confirmed South Africa as the hosts for the tournament for the next 
three years, starting the weekend of Feb. 5-6. As part of the federation's 
plans to raise the profile of rugby league in South Africa, Britain 
will play a Test match against New Zealand at Ellis Park on the way 
home from the Tri-Nations Series in Australia the weekend of Nov. 
12-13. South Africa will participate in the next World Cup, plans 
for which were also unveiled. Federation delegates backed the Rugby 
Football League's plans for a 16-team competition to be held in Britain 
in the fall of 2000. As in 1995, the RFL will field separate England 
and Wales teams but this time Scotland and Ireland, which took part 
in the second-tier Emerging Nations competition last time, are set 
to compete with the big teams. Other teams will be Australia, New 
Zealand, France, Papua New uinea, Tonga, Western Samoa, Fiji, Cook 
Islands, New Zealand Maoris, South Africa and Russia. A 16th entrant 
is likely to be determined by a play-off involving such minnows as 
Lebanon, Morocco, United States, Canada, Japan and Italy.
