Even now 44 years after the grisly events of one Ohio night, it remains 
one of the most fascinating and controversial murder cases in American 
law, especially for Americans of a certain age. Chronicled on television 
and in the movies, the case of Dr. Sam sheppard again made headlines 
today. Mbs correspondent Ann Thompson explains the twist on a decades-long 
drama. There will be yet another episode in the story of Dr. Sam sheppard, 
the real-life inspiration for "the fugitive" TV series and movie. 
A lawsuit brought by sheppard's son could go forward. We need to have 
the legal system proclaim once and for all that Dr. sheppard was innocent. 
It was the trial of the century back in the 1950's. Dr. sheppard, 
convicted for the 1954 murder of his wife in the midst of a media 
frenzy. Then overturned in 1964 because of pretrial publicity. In 
1966, after a decade behind bars, sheppard was found not guilty of 
the crime. Four years later, at age 46, sheppard died. This was an 
outrageous miscarriage of justice. And those who are responsible for 
this have never been held accountable. As his father did more than 
30 years ago, same Reese sheppard claims someone else killed his mother. 
His son thinks it was the handyman, Richard Eberling. Last year, the 
younger sheppard had his father's body exhumed to gather D.N.A. evidence 
he claims proves his father's innocence. But those efforts have not 
impressed the current county prosecutor. It's in the best interest 
of the residents of the county that the case is too old. Prosecutors 
argue too much evidence has been lost and too many witnesses have 
died. Among the dead, the handyman Eberling. He died in prison while 
serving time for an unrelated murder. But Sam Reese sheppard continues 
his fight to clear his father's name and collect $2 million in damages.
