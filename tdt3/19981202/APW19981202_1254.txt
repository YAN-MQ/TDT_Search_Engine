Iraq asked the United Nations to denounce the United States for its 
acts of aggression and ``flagrant interference'' in Baghdad's internal 
affairs, according to a U.N. document released Wednesday. Iraq's Foreign 
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf called on the Security Council to 
assume its responsibility under the U.N. Charter and ask the United 
States to refrain from any threats or action against Iraq or its people. 
Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors as 
the United States and Britain prepared to launch airstrikes on Nov. 
14. U.S. President Bill Clinton decided the following day to give 
Iraq a last chance, but he left no doubt the United States would attack 
if Baghdad didn't fully cooperate _ and he called for the overthrow 
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. In a letter dated Nov. 30, al-Sahhaf 
said the United States had now made clear that its aim was not to 
ensure Iraqi compliance with U.N. resolutions but ``to kill civilians 
and destroy Iraq's industrial, defense and security infrastructure 
in order to destabilize the country internally.'' This would have 
permitted the U.S. government ``to put into effect its plan to overthrow 
the government of Iraq,'' he said. Al-Sahhaf also accused the United 
States of threatening ``to use its most destructive weapons to destroy 
all of Iraq, without any regard for the fate that would befall the 
millions of Iraqis.'' He cited U.S. ``acts of aggression'' dating 
back to 1991, including the bombing of military and civilian sites 
and the imposition of no-fly zones. Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon, 
who transmitted the letter to the Security Council, said Wednesday 
he had not received a response to al-Sahhaf's request that the council 
convene a meeting to discuss its charges against the United States. 
``This is what we hope,'' Hamdoon said. ``This is what we want.'' 
The foreign minister addressed the letter to the Security Council 
president, a post which rotated on Dec. 1 from Deputy U.S. Ambassador 
Peter Burleigh to Bahrain's Ambassador Jassim Mohammed Buallay. Whether 
the Iraqis get a better hearing with Bahrain in the president's chair 
remains to be seen. Bahrain was part of the U.S.-led coalition that 
drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War and the 
two countries have not exchanged any official visits since the conflict. 
But Bahrain has often sent humanitarian aid to Iraq. Bahrain is home 
to the largest U.S. naval base in the region, the 5th Fleet. It also 
hosts the regional headquarters for the U.N. weapons inspectors, known 
as UNSCOM. The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its 
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and long-range missiles before 
the Security Council will lift sweeping sanctions imposed after Iraq 
invaded Kuwait in 1990. UNSCOM's executive director Richard Butler, 
who met with French officials in Paris on Wednesday, described Iraq's 
cooperation in recent weeks as ``satisfactory,'' according to Foreign 
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret. Butler's assessment of Iraqi 
compliance will be crucial to the council's determination on whether 
to proceed with a comprehensive review of Baghdad's compliance with 
U.N. resolutions. Iraqi leaders say they expect the review to lead 
to the lifting of oil sanctions _ but the United States insists there 
is no link. Butler has been trying to get documents on weaponry from 
Iraq and asked Iraq twice for an air force account of chemical munitions 
used from 1983-88 during the Iran-Iraq war. Iraq failed to meet Butler's 
target date to hand over the air force account by Monday. Iraq's Deputy 
Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi on Tuesday reiterated Baghdad's earlier 
position _ that inspectors could review ``relevant portions'' of the 
document in the presence of Annan's special envoy to Iraq, Prakash 
Shah.
