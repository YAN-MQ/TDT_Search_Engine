The U.S. State Department is warning that sanctions against Yugoslavia 
will not be lifted until democracy begins to take hold there. On Tuesday, 
State Department spokesperson, James Rubin, again blamed Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic as the reason for the region's problems. 
Although he acknowledged Belgrade is complying with international 
demands for Kosovo, Mr. Rubin says President Milosevic deserves no 
credit for compromise because he created the problems in the first 
place.
