The White House and Democrats in Congress are calling on Republican 
leaders in the House of Representatives to limit the impeachment inquiry 
of President Clinton. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart says the 
Republican leaders must figure out a way to resolve the inquiry quickly. 
The Democratic leader in the House, Richard Gephardt, says the impeachment 
process appears to be in chaos. He says the probe should focus on 
allegations that Mr. Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice 
in an effort to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
