In excerpts from a videotaped deposition played in federal court Wednesday, 
Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., professed general ignorance 
of his company's legal battles with Sun Microsystems Inc. over Sun's 
Java programming language. Asked under oath on Aug. 29 if he was familiar 
with a civil lawsuit that Sun had recently filed accusing Microsoft 
of violating its contract to use Java, Gates paused for nearly 30 
seconds before replying, ``Not really.'' Later he said with a shrug, 
``I read something about it on our Web site four days ago.'' The questioning 
in August was in the form of a sworn deposition taken by the Justice 
Department for the government's lawsuit accusing Microsoft of predatory 
business practices that violated antitrust laws. The trial turned 
Wednesday to the company's difficult relationship with Sun, which 
created and owns Java, a programming language that could in theory 
threaten the domination by Microsoft's Windows of the market for personal 
computer operating systems. Microsoft licensed Java from Sun three 
years ago but then wrote its own version of the language, which is 
in some ways incompatible with Sun's original. Sun sued, claiming 
that Microsoft's changes violated its licensing agreement. Two weeks 
ago, a federal judge in California ordered Microsoft to make its version 
of Java compatible with Sun's version within 90 days. In the antitrust 
case, the government is trying to show that Microsoft's battles with 
Sun are part of a broad pattern of illegal, predatory behavior intended 
to protect its Windows operating system monopoly. Through a long day 
of testimony, live and videotaped, Microsoft presented two faces. 
On videotape, Gates seemed largely unconcerned by Sun, though at one 
point he said that Java ``might be evolved in the future'' into a 
competitive threat. But in live questioning, a Microsoft lawyer, Tom 
Burt, tried to force James Gosling, the Sun executive who created 
Java, into saying that Sun intended to mount a deadly threat against 
Microsoft. Burt displayed memos and e-mail from Sun executives describing 
ambitions to challenge Microsoft using Java. ``Charge! Kill Hewlett-Packard, 
IBM, Microsoft and Apple all at once'' using Java, Sun's chief executive, 
Scott McNealy, wrote in one e-mail message, according to a newsletter 
entered into evidence. Bill Joy, another Sun executive, wrote in 1995 
that ``Java gives Sun a chance to break away from the Microsoft monopoly.'' 
But Gosling seemed amused by that and other exuberant statements by 
Sun executives over the years. And when Burt asked him if Sun wanted 
to take over ``100 percent of the computer market,'' Gosling chuckled 
before responding, ``I think we would be happy if we achieved two 
orders of magnitude less than that,'' or 1 percent. Microsoft's goal 
in court was to suggest that it could not be considered an enduring 
monopoly if it was threatened by aggressive competitors like Sun. 
The government can make few of its charges stick if Judge Thomas Penfield 
Jackson does not conclude that Microsoft is a monopoly as defined 
by federal law. While it is not illegal to have a monopoly, a company 
with a recognized monopoly is barred from employing predatory practices 
to maintain its domination of a market. In contrast to Burt's strategy, 
however, Gates seemed wholly unconcerned by Sun and Java. At one point 
in the Aug. 28 deposition, David Boies, the government's lead lawyer, 
asked Gates, ``Did you ever try to find out what Microsoft is charged 
with, what they're alleged to have done wrong?'' In a casual tone, 
Gates responded that he had asked Paul Maritz, a senior Microsoft 
executive: ```Do I need to learn about this lawsuit? Do I need to 
spend a lot of time on it?' He said, no, he's focused on it, and I 
can focus on other things.'' But then Boies presented e-mail to Gates 
from others in his company last year showing that they were quite 
concerned with Sun and Java _ particularly since Java was a significant 
component of the World Wide Web browser made by Netscape Communications 
Corp., Microsoft's chief competitor in Internet software. And in an 
e-mail entered into evidence earlier in the trial, Gates once remarked 
that Java ``scares the hell out of me.'' In one e-mail introduced 
Wednesday, Maritz wrote to Gates: ``If we looked further at Java being 
our major threat, then Netscape is the major distribution vehicle.'' 
Gates said he could not recall that e-mail, adding that ``Maritz may 
or may not have agreed'' with the notions he was describing. In another 
message to Gates last year, a Microsoft executive, Todd Nielson, wrote, 
``We are proactively trying to put obstacles in Sun's path and get 
anyone that wants to write in Java to use J/Direct,'' Microsoft's 
version of the language for Windows. Gates said he did not recall 
the message, adding, ``I don't know what it means.'' Microsoft issued 
a statement Wednesday defending Gates' responses and criticizing the 
government for playing the video of the deposition. ``Gates' performance 
reflects his adherence to the instructions lawyers routinely give 
their clients who are being deposed,'' it said.
