A German club intends to give a completely new meaning to open-door 
policies in international soccer _ by signing the entire Cuban national 
team. Fourth-division Bonner SC, based in the soon-to-be abandoned 
German government seat of Bonn, thinks the plan will help it gain 
promotion. A club delegation will travel to Cuba on Sunday for talks 
with Cuban soccer federation officials, German newspapers reported 
Wednesday. They hope to sign a cooperation deal next Wednesday. In 
return for allowing the entire team to practice and play in Germany, 
the Cubans would receive balls, soccer boots, uniforms and other equipment. 
The Bonn club could release any players on loan, but the transfer 
rights would remain with the Cuban federation. The Cubans would come 
with their coach William Bennett and would also play exhibition games 
against smaller European soccer nations. Also under the plan, the 
Cubans would be available for all World Cup qualifying games. ``The 
Cubans want to develop their team and let it learn tactics in Europe,'' 
Bonner SC chairman Hans Viol told the Bonn newspaper General-Anzeiger. 
Bonner SC coach Rainer Thomas said he would retain the core of his 
current roster. The Cubans would practice separately. Thomas said 
``maybe three, maybe eight'' could make the starting lineup. ``That's 
the only way we can gain promotion,'' Viol said. But it was unlikely 
to come before next season, he said. Bonner SC officials came to the 
idea after watching the video tape of Cuba playing Brazil. If the 
German soccer federation approves the deal, the Cubans could start 
playing in February. The Bonn club is looking for sponsors to pay 
for the Cubans' lodging, food and medical insurance. The General-Anzeiger 
newspaper dismissed the plan as too ``adventurous.'' ``What if they 
start asking for political asylum?'' it asked. Many lower-division 
German clubs have signed a multitude of foreign players. But once 
they reach the second division, they face a problem: the league allows 
only three foreigners outside the European Union to play in a game.
