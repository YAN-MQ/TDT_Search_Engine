Australian stocks gained nearly one percent to the good economic news. 
The Central Bank today cut its key interest rate 25 bases points to 
4-3/4ths percent. Chief economist Bill Evans of West Pac Bank in Sydney 
says low inflation is the key to the global cut in rates. And the 
Reserve Bank, which has set itself a target to hold inflation between 
a two and three percent band has now realized that it is over achieving 
on that target. We would expect that even though the Australian dollar 
has fallen by 30 percent at one stage against the U.S. dollar, we 
would expect that Australian inflation will only be peaking at around 
less than 2-1/2 percent next year. So the Reserve Bank saw this as 
an opportunity to lower interest rates, take a bit of an insurance 
policy against the global economic down to our next year with absolutely 
no risk that they would exceed their inflation targets. Private economist 
Bill Evans. The other piece of good news out of Australia, the economy 
grew one percent in the third quarter, an annual five percent rate.
