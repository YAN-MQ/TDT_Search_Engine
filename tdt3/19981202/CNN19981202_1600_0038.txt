Now the Dow, it closed down 72 points. Those are unofficial numbers. 
Analysts say investors are getting nervous about pushing stock prices 
higher, because of so many unanswered questions about the state of 
the world economy. At one point, the Dow Jones industrial average 
was down 178 points. The expected Spike in holiday shopping wasn't 
enough to bolster the stock of Sears. The retailer announced disappointing 
sales during November and lowered profit expectations. To get some 
perspective on the market, we have David Gardner on the phone. He's 
the best-selling author of "the motley fool" investment guides. Welcome, 
David. I think that's fool.com. isn't it? Absolutely. So why has this 
happened today? We don't spend that much time explaining why the market 
does what it does on any given day. There are many factors. What we 
care about is how it does over the course of a longer period of time. 
In 1998, we are up 20% plus for a fourth year in a row. It has been 
unprecedented. But you see the job cuts, and that's just a natural 
part of business change. We're seeing production shifting to a technology 
economy. Boepg announced cuts again today. The stock dropped about 
15%. It was because the company announced profits were going to be 
coming in about 15% less than had been expected. So you sart of see 
why the stock would do what it does there. So it's all the expectation 
game? A lot of it is. You have sympathy for people who lose their 
jobs, and it's happening for a Lot of large industrial companies today. 
But a lot of companies are hiring in their place. That's why our unemployment 
rate is still low. And your feeling about the direction of the economy? 
We feel strongly that interest rates are the most significant thing 
for people to focus on. It affects mortgages, but also the stock market. 
Money jumps into the stock market or into things like bonds based 
on interest rates. So when interest rates come down the money moves 
out of bonds. As an investor, you have to focus on that. There's less 
capital then. That's true as well. Thank you, David Gardner, co-founder 
of "the motley fool." There's a web site, you can reach him at --
