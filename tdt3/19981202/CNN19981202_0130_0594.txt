you've probably heard being overweight can increase your chance of 
heart disease. now, researchers have found the way you carry that 
weight may be just as important. linda ciampa explains. a strong clue 
to a woman's health may lie in the shape of her waist. new research 
finds women who are apple-shaped -- that is, they carry more weight 
around their waist rather than their hips -- are at greater risk for 
heart disease, even if they're at a healthy weight. it's not only 
how much total fat that you have, but how it is distributed that affects 
risk. harvard researchers found women who had the highest waist/hip 
ratio -- that is a measure of the waistline divided by the hips -- 
were three times more likely to develop heart disease than those with 
the lowest ratio. if you're doing the math, doctors say your number 
should fall below .80. researchers also found women with waistlines 
of 38 inches or more had more than three times the risk of heart disease 
than those with waists of 28 inches or less. experts have a theory 
as to what's going on. fat within the abdominal cavity appears to 
be associated with worse cholesterol profiles, higher triglyceride 
levels, lower hdl cholesterol -- which is the good cholesterol -- 
and higher ldl cholesterol. at 5'4", cynthia franks weighs 139 pounds, 
by most accounts a healthy weight. but because she's naturally thick-waisted, 
she has to be even more vigilant about her diet and exercise. it was 
surprising. but, it's something that i don't want to ignore. while 
franks is doing the best she can to change her waist/hip ratio, her 
doctor is keeping close watch on other risk factors. we need to be 
more aggressive about treating cholesterol in those women, watching 
blood pressure, following a healthy diet and exercising. previous 
studies have shown men who are apple-shaped are at higher risk for 
heart disease as well. so it's a good idea for both men and women 
to watch their waistlines and to make a commitment to exercise and 
a healthful diet. linda ciampa, cnn, atlanta.
