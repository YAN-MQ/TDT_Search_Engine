Kent Tritle grew up on a century-old family farm in a corner of Iowa, 
founded a high school rock band that played at proms across the prairie, 
graduated from the Juilliard School, transformed the music program 
at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue into one of the 
best in the city, performed as an organist with the New York Philharmonic 
and two springs ago bailed out the family farm when his bankrupt parents 
couldn't afford to plant the soybean crop. In a city of 1,000 stories, 
his is a good one. ``I don't think of this in terms of having come 
full circle,'' Tritle said. ``But I'm amazed at the sequence of things 
that have happened. The doors have opened, and allowed me to do more, 
and better. People who are removed from agriculture may not understand 
what the farm means. But it's the only choice I can make. That's what 
I am.'' These days, Tritle, the music director at St. Ignatius Loyola, 
one of the more beautiful churches in the city, is also part of the 
essence of Christmas in New York _ a person who walks the aisle between 
the spiritual and the entertaining and who brings forth the season's 
Handel, Bach and various renditions of ``Joy to the World.'' Tritle 
will conduct the Dec. 20 Holiday Concert at St. Ignatius Loyola _ 
``It's our big warm fuzzy of the year'' _ plus the music for the church's 
Roman Catholic Masses on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Tritle, 
38, is also music director of the Desoff Choirs (they perform at St. 
Ignatius on Dec. 11), a faculty member at Juilliard, the founder of 
the Sacred Music in a Sacred Space concert series and a principal 
organist with the American Symphony Orchestra. ``I am a little tired,'' 
he said. Plus, he has helped make St. Ignatius such a star that Lincoln 
Center now holds its Music of the Spirit concert series there. Plus, 
he directed the music at Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' funeral there 
_ he played the organ when Jessye Norman sang ``Ave Maria'' _ and 
also conducted for the lavish St. Ignatius wedding of Alexandra and 
Alexandre von Furstenberg. All in all, he is in charge of 450 services 
with music a year. Tuesday, Tritle (pronounced as in title) talked 
for two hours about himself and his music in the church's choir loft, 
at the foot of a $1.25 million, 40-ton, four-story organ that he helped 
bring to the church in 1993. This is a whole other subject, but briefly, 
the behemoth is a rare mechanical-action organ, built mostly by hand 
over 18 months; it is one of the largest in the country, and looks 
like the spires of Oz. Tritle showed it off by playing the thunderous 
allegro from Charles-Marie Widor's Symphony No. 6 in G minor. It made 
the floor vibrate madly and sounded like the end of the world. ``Apocalyptic!'' 
Tritle said, enthralled. ``It's big! It's thunderous! It's beyond 
all scale.'' Tritle is an enthusiast, and still seems a little startled 
by the good fortune in his life. He said the best part of his many 
jobs was teaching music to different kinds of people, from St. Ignatius' 
paid, professional choir _ most big churches in Manhattan have one 
_ to its ``volunteer'' choir composed of parishioners and anyone who 
walks in humming off the street. (Some members of the choir are Jewish. 
Tritle is Methodist. St. Ignatius is run by the Jesuits.) The difference 
between the two choirs, Tritle said, ``is like the difference between 
driving the old Farmall tractor and a Rolls-Royce _ but each ride 
can be a lot of fun.'' With the tractor, ``you've got the breeze, 
you've got the smell, you've got the clods of earth. ``And that's 
what it's like with the volunteer choir _ you've got all the humanness.'' 
Tuesday night, Tritle conducted the volunteer choir in a practice 
of ``O Come All Ye Faithful.'' He praised them constantly but stopped 
them frequently, as after the phrase ``joyful and triumphant.'' ``You 
have to be joyful about the word joyful,'' he instructed. ``Joyful 
has to draw you like a magnet.'' And then later: ``Flex the knees, 
hang the tail _ relax!'' The choir, cheery and purposeful, basked 
in Tritle's attention. ``He's a doll,'' said Susan Kasluga, a flight 
attendant for American Airlines. ``He has the patience of a saint.'' 
While he was growing up in Spirit Lake (population 4,000), in Iowa's 
northwest corner, Tritle thought he might be a veterinarian _ he delivered 
pigs and cattle on the farm, and saw a favorite colt die _ but came 
to see the creation of music as mystical, like birth and death. ``Music 
comes from nature, ultimately,'' he said. When his choirs sing, ``there 
is incredible human communication, and I think present in that communication 
is God.'' All is not perfect in Tritle's life. His younger brother, 
Daniel, at the height of the family's money problems, sold cattle 
that did not belong to him and is expected to be sentenced next month 
to three years in prison. Tritle's parents do not like to talk about 
his 10-year relationship with Arthur Fiacco, a cellist, who lives 
with Tritle on the Upper West Side. But Tritle knows that he helped 
save the family farm _ now 56 acres, down from 156 _ and that what 
he calls a ``black hole'' back home is coming toward light. ``I experienced 
the best of small-town America,'' he said. ``In the summer of 1982, 
before heading off to Juilliard, I gave two organ recitals. And they 
all turned out, and they put so much money in the plate.''
