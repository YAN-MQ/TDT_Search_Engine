Rarely has an urban legend been born so quickly and openly as the 
tale that Sony's NightShot video camera could see through clothes. 
Jay Leno joked about it: ``Hear about this new video camera that looks 
through clothes? Well, Sony has recalled it _ and raised the price.'' 
The government of Malaysia banned the device with its No Lux infrared 
feature. The titillating tale rippled through the news media like 
snickers through a sophomore science class. It had only the tiniest 
grain of truth: in skilled hands, during the day, under just the right 
conditions, with just the right (gauzy) fabrics, it might be possible 
to produce an image of a body beneath. The camera could not, of course, 
see through clothes, and there was no recall. Sony was only slightly 
embarrassed; what the company had in mind with the No Lux feature, 
its press release said, was ``to record nighttime activities, such 
as a new baby sleeping.'' Even though 400,000 units had been sold, 
the company still modified the infrared transmitters on new cameras 
to remove even the most-remote possibility of intrusive video taping. 
The strength of the story was a sure indication of the emotional chords 
it struck in the collective unconscious. It illuminated the darkness 
of our fears and fascinations about video surveillance. People are 
increasingly nervous about being watched, yet they don't seem to have 
lost their desire to see more themselves _ to see through the dark, 
through walls, through the murk, to view a hidden order. Sony's camera 
is not alone. No lux is new luxe: the latest luxury option from Cadillac 
is a night-vision panel projected onto the windshield, to aid drivers 
at night. Sales for night-vision equipment, ``civilianized'' from 
military models by ITT Industries, the manufacturer of material for 
defense and industry, are booming among boaters and hunters. Veterans 
swear these models are inferior to less-expensive Russian models sold 
by catalogs like Quartermaster and U.S. Cavalry; the idea of the magic 
technology of a defeated enemy, after all, has its own appeal. The 
Herrington catalog, devoted to the latest gadgets, describes the ITT 
Night Mariner binoculars it offers as piercing ``the pitch black mysteries 
of the dark.'' And ITT itself gives us a touching advertisement, showing 
how its night-vision system found a boy lost in the snow: ``When a 
child is lost and it's dark on the mountain, your heart breaks.'' 
The searchers followed footprints ``until new snow fell and covered 
them. But our Night Vision showed his tracks through the new snow. 
...'' Here it was again, the modern myth, the most-extreme claim of 
night vision, to see not just into the night, but through things, 
like X-rays. Seeing through things means security, as at the airport 
check-in scanners. Danger seen is danger disarmed; danger seen at 
night, from a distance, makes for voyeurism. Night vision has been 
chic since Dan Rather went to Afghanistan and the Gulf War lighted 
up Baghdad. Creating a world that seems carved out of a single gritty-green 
mineral is a fixture of film thrillers. In ``Patriot Games,'' Harrison 
Ford thwarts the IRA terrorists, who are wearing night-vision goggles, 
by hiding in the basement of a darkened house, then flipping on all 
the lights at once. The seemingly blinded attackers scream and scratch 
their eyes in agony. Outdoorsmen, familiar with night vision, snort 
at the idea. In the film ``Eraser,'' there's an even more fanciful 
futuristic version of night vision: a scope on a rifle that, like 
a demonic sonogram, can look into houses, through not only clothes, 
but also through layers of the body, so that its cross hairs center 
on a beating heart. Night vision has become a familiar mode on television 
shows like ``Cops,'' which offer furtive glimpses into the down-market 
demimonde. The cameras on such shows send out the same sort of waves 
as the viewer's remote control _ infrared. These waves, with lengths 
just beyond visible light _ they're cousins to heat waves _ bounce 
from objects back onto chips that electronically magnify them into 
images. Spies have long used infrared; Weegee used it to capture nighttime 
New York. L.A. chopper cops use infrared to pick out the still warm 
engine of the stolen car from among those peacefully parked. But some 
of us hope to find something different in the dark. Advertisements 
for Sony's NightShot show a cat and dog caught in surreptitious embrace, 
in some high-tech version of Edward Hicks' ``Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings. 
The implication is that No Lux will reveal not just a secret world 
of war and crime, but also an ideal, peaceful one _ that it will see 
through the oppositions of daylight. Is that what we hope to see in 
the dark? Perhaps the heat of infrared does cast some light after 
all.
