Slogans denouncing a Kurdish guerrilla group mixed with upbeat soccer 
chants at Ali Sami Yen Stadium Wednesday as spectators awaited the 
start of the politically charged Champions League match between Galatasaray 
and Juventus of Turin. Around 22,000 police officers were deployed 
for the game amid fears that angry Turkish fans might resort to violence 
against the Italians. Military troops in camouflage outfits stood 
guard around the stadium. Turkey and Italy are locked in a bitter 
dispute over the fate of Abdullah Ocalan, a Kurdish rebel leader arrested 
in Rome who has asked for political asylum, and there were fears the 
political tensions might spill onto the soccer field. Authorities 
also said they worried about a provocation by the rebels from the 
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, aimed at staining Turkey's image. 
``Down with the PKK,'' chanted thousands of Turkish spectators who 
filed into the stadium four hours before kickoff. Others yelled more 
traditional soccer cheers in support of Galatasaray, while a scoreboard 
flashed a cartoon Galatasaray player handing flowers to a Juventus 
counterpart. But there was bitterness in the air. No Italian fans 
attended the match because of security concerns. Hundreds of police 
were on hand when the Italian team arrived at the Istanbul airport 
Wednesday. A small group of airport employees tossed flowers at the 
Juventus bus in greeting. But, as loyal home-team fans, they also 
chanted ``Turkey, Turkey!'' The road from the airport to the team's 
hotel was closed to traffic, but people standing along the route waved 
to the bus. Turkey's leaders have been calling on Turks to be hospitable 
and refrain from doing anything to mar the match. Sports ministers 
of both Turkey and Italy are scheduled to attend the game. ``Sports 
is an international language. Tonight we will watch a very nice competition,'' 
said Italian Sports and Culture Minister Giovanna Melandri. Her Turkish 
counterpart Yucel Seckiner said, ``Let's all together applaud the 
team that wins.'' Juventus official Romy Gai agreed. ``We are here 
to play a game, only a game. We don't care about other things,'' he 
said. At the stadium entrance, police searched spectators for weapons 
or items like loose change that could be hurled onto the field. Even 
umbrellas and mobile phones were not allowed. On Tuesday, 11th graf
