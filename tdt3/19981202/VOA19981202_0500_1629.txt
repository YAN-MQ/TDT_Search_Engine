Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. We'll be back though on the other side with more 
of News now. It is Wednesday. It is December 2nd, 1998. On this date 
in 1823, U.S. President James Monroe used his annual message to Congress 
to declare a bold new American policy. That policy became known as 
the Monroe Doctrine and it became a cornerstone of American foreign 
policy for more than a century. President Monroe said the United States 
would not tolerate European interference in the affairs of nations 
in the Western Hemisphere. One principle of the Monroe Doctrine was 
that the Americas would no longer be open to European colonization. 
Another principle: the two spheres principle in which Monroe said 
there were now distinct U.S. and European new world and old world 
systems later through the declaration of Lima in 1942 and the treaty 
of Rio in 1947. Western Hemisphere republics adopted the principles 
of the Monroe Doctrine to defend themselves against foreign intervention. 
It was on this date, December 2nd in 1942 that American scientists 
demonstrated for the first time that they could control a self-sustaining 
nuclear chain reaction. That experiment was conducted in the physics 
laboratory at the University of Chicago as part of the secret United 
States program to develop an atomic bomb during World War II. Bernard 
Fell, then a 22-year-old graduate student of physics, was part of 
the team. He died in 1993, but before he did, he said there was a 
tense atmosphere in the lab. Professor Fell remembered that the group 
of scientists toasted the success with a bottle of Chianti and cigarettes. 
He said they didn't have enough money for champagne or cigars. Ten 
hours 30 universal time, and this is VOA News Now. Big oil gets bigger 
as mergers are announced in the United States and Europe. A Japanese 
newspaper says the United States has warned Tokyo that North Korea 
may be preparing to launch another ballistic missile. The United States 
says it will declassify and release documents relating to abuses in 
Chile under former dictator, Pinochet. These stories and more in this 
half hour of News Now. Hello, everyone, I'm Paul Westpheling along 
with Charlene Porter. We're broadcasting live from Washington.
