You are looking live at the space shuttle endeavor on the launch pad 
at cape Canaveral right now. If everything goes as planned, it will 
lift off well before dawn Thursday morning, right around 4:00 A.M. 
eastern time. The mission is the first in a series of shuttle flights 
designed to build the international space station. Once the endeavor 
crew members get on their way, they will have to catch up with the 
Russian component of the stace station already up there, already in 
orbit, and attach it to the U.S. Module they are carrying with them.
