The vice president of Tajikistan's National Bank was kidnapped by 
several gunmen Wednesday in the capital of this restive Central Asian 
nation. Police said the assailants, wearing military fatigues, stopped 
Navruz Valiyev's car, took him out and drove away. The motive for 
the kidnapping was not immediately clear. However, Valiyev recently 
ordered an increase in the minimum capital requirements for the nation's 
commercial banks in a bid to protect depositors' accounts. Several 
banks failed to meet them and were forced to halt operations after 
the new requirements were introduced in October. Valiyev was also 
in charge of Tajikistan's talks with the International Monetary Fund. 
Tajikistan's economy is in shambles following a 5-year civil war between 
the secular government, which is backed by Russia, and the mostly 
Islamic opposition. A truce signed last year ended large-scale hostilities, 
but there are still periodic clashes.
