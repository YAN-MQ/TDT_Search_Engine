The call came in from the White House on Nov. 10. Could Colette Peters, 
fantasy cake decorator to Bette Midler, Whoopi Goldberg, Al Pacino, 
Joan Rivers and Rockefeller Center, make edible Christmas decorations 
for the mantels in the Red Room and the Green Room and for the Grand 
Foyer? And could she have them installed by Saturday night, Dec. 5? 
Not too many people say no to the White House. Neither did Ms. Peters, 
who gave up a career as a painter _ that thing about making a living 
_ to bake and decorate cakes for the rich and famous. The cakes turned 
out to provide a very nice living. To prepare for the holiday request, 
which came through Robert Isabell, the New York party designer and 
florist who is also doing some White House decorations, Ms. Peters 
cleared her shop on Washington Street in the West Village and set 
to work with the tools of a painter and sculptor. This week, her workroom 
looked like a set for ``The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy'': any visitor 
standing still risked being coated with rolled fondant and decorated 
with nonpareils. With royal icing, gum paste, fondant, pastillage, 
silver and gold dragees, Karo syrup, lemon extract and plastic-foam 
base she has created an edible Christmas tree decorated with elegantly 
wrapped packages for the foyer, a lacy ice palace and ice garden to 
sit on the mantel in the Green Room under a portrait of Benjamin Franklin, 
and for the Red Room, a whimsical tableau of polar bears, igloos and 
snowflakes. It is the painstaking details that make Ms. Peters' work 
so unusual _ closer to sculpture than to cake decoration. The snowflakes 
look like tracery. The white wrapping paper and silver and gold ribbons 
for the packages on the tree are all patterned icing. After studying 
at the Pratt Institute and the Rhode Island School of Design, Ms. 
Peters decided to give up the life of an artist for the life of a 
designer at Tiffany's, where she also did all the cakes for John Loring's 
Tiffany books. Twenty years ago, she went into cake decorating full 
time. Last year, Tiffany's asked her to do its Christmas windows. 
That's the kind of work she likes best, leaving the baking to her 
assistants. ``If I never had to bake a cake again, I'd be happy,'' 
she said. ``I'd rather spend the time decorating.'' Although she did 
not put a price tag on her White House creations, she estimated that 
it would cost her at least $2,000 in supplies and trips to and from 
Washington for herself and her staff. And in order to take on the 
White House project, Ms. Peters has had to turn away about $10,000 
in commissions. The minimum price for a Colette Peters cake is $250; 
most cost $1,000. The six-foot cake for the wedding of Marie-Chantal 
Miller to Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece in 1995 was ``more than $25,000, 
but less than $100,000,'' Ms. Peters said. It was decorated with the 
same flowers that are used on Flora Danica, the pricey Swedish china 
originally made for the prince's royal Swedish relatives. Since each 
of the 1,500 guests at the wedding had an individual cake, the main 
cake remained untouched. So Ms. Peters brought it back to New York 
and, from time to time, scavenged flower decorations from it. Barbra 
Streisand's wedding cake, from a Los Angeles bakery, looked exactly 
like her design for the prince, Ms. Peters says, and others have lifted 
ideas from her books. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery 
Ms. Peters must be flattered to death. But credit, she said, would 
be even better. Which is all she will be getting at the White House. 
Still, ``I didn't think a minute about accepting the job,'' she said, 
adding: ``It's a great honor. And it's a chance to do something of 
my own design.'' Glimpses of Ms. Peters' designs can be had during 
public tours of the state rooms, starting Monday and continuing through 
Dec. 31. What with 4-year-olds who cannot resist snacking and grown-ups 
who cannot resist touching, the icing, gum paste, pastillage and fondant 
will not be recycled.
