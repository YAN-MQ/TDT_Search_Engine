Here in New York today, the world's richest man, Bill Gates, and his 
wife, dipped into their bank account. Donating $100 million to help 
provide vaccinations to children in developing countries. He told 
reporters, the goal is protecting children from diseases that have 
been eradicated in the developed world. The only thing standing in 
the way of saving millions of additional kids lives in developing 
countries is ensuring an adequate supply of new vaccines. So our program 
has a simple goal, to make vaccines you and I take for granted available 
to children, regardless of where they live. The Gates' gift is believed 
to be the biggest ever private donation to support health care around 
the world. And as NBC's chief science correspondent Robert Bazell 
tells us experts think it will be money very well spent. Where will 
the Gates' money go? To find new ways to get all the world's children 
immunized with traditional vaccines and to speed up the distribution 
of new vaccines against killer diseases. Public health experts are 
thrilled with the gift. The most cost effective intervention to prevent 
death and disease in the world is childhood immunization. It's a great 
investment. The world health organization now manages to vaccinate 
80% of kids for the common preventable diseases, Polio, diphtheria, 
measles, rubella, mumps and whooping cough. That is up from only 5% 
two decades ago. But why are so many children still not vaccinated? 
Buying the vaccines is only one step. Someone must also transport 
them. And people must learn how important they are. The real challenge 
now is the rural areas, the poorest of the poor, the poorest of the 
developing countries, many of which simply don't have the resources 
to get it done. a major focus of the Gates effort -- two new vaccines. 
One to prevent a common cause of pneumonia and brain infections or 
meningitis. The other, against the liver infection hepatitis B. the 
U.S. and other rich countries now use the vaccines, but few developing 
countries do, even though the diseases are rampant. We hope this program 
can shorten the time until children in poor countries have access 
to the same vaccine that your children have access to or will have 
access to in the next few months. The Gates money will also pay for 
research efforts to find vaccines for even more killer diseases. The 
potential is staggering. The world health organization effort now 
saves the lives of 3 million children a year. Wider use of existing 
vaccines could double that number to 6 million lives saved every year. 
The U.S. centers for disease control estimates that every $1 invested 
in vaccinations saves up to $29 dollars in health and other costs 
to society. But far more importantly, the vaccines give children and 
their countries a Future they would not otherwise have. Robert Bazell,
