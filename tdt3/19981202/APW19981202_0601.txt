Arsenal's Ray Parlour and Lee Dixon have been suspended for at least 
one European match following incidents during their club's defeat 
by Lens last week, UEFA said Wednesday. UEFA's control and disciplinary 
body also suspended Lens' Tony Vairelles for one match for ``unsporting 
behavior.'' The French champion's 1-0 win at Wembley put Arsenal out 
of the Champions League. Arsenal midfielder Parlour was sent off in 
the final minute for striking out at Cyril Rool. He was followed a 
minute later by Vairelles for a foul challenge on Dixon. Dixon's suspension 
was imposed for ``an elbow-strike in the back of an opponent,'' UEFA 
said. Although Dixon was not booked by referee Anders Frisk, UEFA 
ruled he started the trouble by elbowing Vairelles in the back. Vairelles 
and Lens coach Daniel Leclercq accused Dixon of feigning injury to 
get the French international striker sent off, which came just seconds 
after Parlour was given his red card for going after Rool. The disciplinary 
body will take a final decision in January on the length of the Arsenal 
players' suspensions. Rool and Lens defender Eric Sikora each received 
one-match suspensions after receiving the season's second booking.
