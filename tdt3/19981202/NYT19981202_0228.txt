During the Great Depression, the federal government hired a corps 
of photographers to capture the searing poverty of beleaguered farmers 
and other workers and, not incidentally, to provide work for unemployed 
photographers. Now these pictures, some of the most memorable photographs 
of that era, have been made available over the Internet without fees 
to anyone with a computer. One of those great photographers couldn't 
be more pleased. ``I think it's important because otherwise an important 
part of history is sitting dead in files,'' said that photographer, 
Gordon Parks, who went on from a $48-a-week government photographer 
to a long career that has also brought him acclaim as a movie director. 
The Internet project includes such well-known pictures as Parks' image 
of a black charwoman holding a broom and a mop in front of an American 
flag, in ironic homage in segregated Washington to Grant Wood's ``American 
Gothic.'' ``It should be profitable to many people,'' Parks said. 
``The photographs are indictments of what the government was doing 
wrong.'' The Library of Congress has put online 52,000 black-and-white 
pictures, plus 1,600 in color. They are from the collections of the 
Farm Security Administration and a successor agency, the Office of 
War Information, selected from 164,000 photographs taken from 1935 
to 1945. Eventually, all the pictures in the collection, ``America 
From the Great Depression to World War II,'' will be put on the Internet. 
The Web site for the photos is http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/fsahtml/fahome.html 
Besides Parks, who has 227 pictures on the Web site, others include 
Walker Evans, who is represented with 517 photographs, including the 
simply titled ``Sharecropper's grave'' from 1936. Dorothea Lange has 
759 images, one of which is bound to be among those most often downloaded 
_ ``Migrant Mother: Destitute Pea Pickers in California,'' a 1936 
photograph of a defeated woman with two children, their backs to the 
camera, burying their faces on her shoulders as she stares ahead. 
It is a picture of complete defeat and hopelessness. It is No. 542 
in Lange's Internet canon. Carl Mydans has 1,116 photographs available, 
including one of junk piled up behind two houses in Milwaukee. There 
are 1,430 photos by Ben Shahn, some showing people trying to eke out 
livings as as cotton pickers, miners and masons. An itinerant street 
photographer stands in front of a restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, in 
August 1938, his eyes asking that the passerby pose and buy the photograph 
from him. Beverly Brannan, a curator of photography at the Library 
of Congress, said that the Internet program had its roots in a preservation 
project that started seven years ago in which new positive prints 
and digital versions were made from the library's negative collection. 
Last June, the library started putting together the collection for 
its Internet site and it began becoming available to the public in 
September. ``It is part of a preservation project for the negatives 
and at the same time makes it more accessible,'' Ms. Brannan said. 
Parks and any of the other photographers still alive will not make 
any money from the wide distribution of their pictures because the 
pictures are government property, made while the photographers were 
working for the federal agencies. The going rate for photographers 
during the Depression, Ms. Brannan said, was about $2,300 a year, 
or $44 a week. Parks got an extra $4 a week because he was regarded 
as a senior photographer. Carl Fleischauer, technical coordinator 
for the project, said that the resolution of the pictures on the Internet 
was similar to that found in daily newspapers but not as clear as 
that in magazines. In any event, quality will also depend on the computer 
and printer used by the person who takes the pictures off the Web 
site. But no matter how good the computer and printer, the Internet 
pictures are still not near the quality of the photographic prints. 
These can be ordered from the Library of Congress for $18 and up, 
Ms. Brannan said. Instructions for ordering are on the Web site.
