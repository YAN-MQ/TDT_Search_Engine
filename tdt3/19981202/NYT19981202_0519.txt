Cinderelli, we hardly knew ye. That sentence has been uttered in more 
than one office since a certain letter began inspiring debates about 
the emotional health of New York children. The letter, which has been 
making the rounds of fax and photocopy machines, was originally sent 
last month to the parents of the 2- and 3-year-olds in the Red Room 
class of the First Presbyterian Church Nursery School, at West 12th 
Street and Fifth Avenue. It was a message from the school's director, 
Ellen Ziman: ``As most of you already know, the Red Room hamster `Cinderelli 
Fluffy' became sick about a month ago. Dr. Dale Rubin of Gramercy 
Park Animal Hospital arranged for Cinderelli to be treated at the 
hospital, where she was given the very best of care by Drs. Rubin 
and Kuhlman and their staff. Despite their efforts, Cinderelli did 
not recover. At that time the children were adjusting to a change 
of teachers and we decided to limit them to one adjustment at a time. 
They seem to have accepted Cinderelli's absence but we feel that they 
need to know that she will not be coming back. ``We will be talking 
with the children about Cinderelli, reading them some books about 
the vet, and about the life cycle. They will talk about what they 
remember about Cinderelli and make a book. In a little while we will 
think about getting another pet for the classroom. Please feel free 
to talk with me or the teachers about any concerns you have.'' The 
letter has raised a number of questions around water coolers, starting 
with: Is this really necessary? When today's adults look back on their 
own brushes with hamster mortality, they generally do not recall teams 
of medical specialists and official discussions of grief management. 
After reading the letter, one middle-aged woman recalled that her 
mourning process had consisted of an older brother's explaining, ``Hey, 
the (expletive) hamster's dead.'' Have Americans become so in touch 
with their feelings that they now require bereavement counselors to 
cope with the loss of rodents? Possibly, although some suspect that 
it's chiefly a New York phenomenon, the result partly of the city's 
obsessive parents and partly of its strained relationship with nature. 
The loss of a hamster would presumably loom less large in places where 
children are exposed to richer ecosystems. Still, is this the best 
way to prepare New York children for future careers in the city? One 
Wall Street trader wonders how these sensitized children would fare 
in his line of work. ``Would you feel confident investing your money,'' 
he asked, ``with someone who can only handle one adjustment at a time? 
I can see one of these kids telling his staff not to disturb him with 
any bad news from the Nikkei exchange until he recovers from the trauma 
of hiring a new secretary.'' But this was all idle speculation. A 
field investigation of Cinderelli's death was essential, and Ms. Ziman 
graciously allowed it Wednesday morning. She explained that Cinderelli 
had been suffering from skin lesions when veterinarians nearby offered 
to provide extraordinary treatment free of charge. ``The vets don't 
usually deal with exotics,'' she said. ``That's what they call rodents. 
But they knew how attached we were to Cinderelli, so they did some 
reading and developed an antibiotic to treat her.'' Cinderelli's condition 
initially improved, but then finally overwhelmed medical science, 
whereupon some parents suggested trying to fool the children with 
a substitute Cinderelli. ``We didn't do that,'' Ms. Ziman said, ``because 
the children would have known, and because we saw this as a real opportunity 
for learning. Children need to be able to deal with death and their 
feelings of loss. In the past, people didn't take young children's 
feelings so seriously, but now we know how tremendously important 
their early development is.'' The children filled the Cinderelli memorial 
book by making watercolor paintings and dictating comments like ``I 
feel mad because Cinderelli is not here,'' ``I remember she had a 
Ferris wheel'' and ``She liked her cage.'' Most didn't have a lot 
of specific memories, because Cinderelli had spent most of the daylight 
hours asleep, but there were some ringing testimonials nonetheless. 
``She was the greatest hamster,'' a 3-year-old named Luke recorded 
in the book. ``I remember about the scraping thing she goes under. 
And her drinking from the bottle.'' They all seemed to be coping well 
Wednesday morning as they gathered around the cage of the Red Room's 
new pet, a guinea pig named Rascal. When asked about Cinderelli, several 
of them matter-of-factly replied, ``She died,'' and then rushed off 
to resume work building a highway of wooden blocks. ``They're moving 
on to new things,'' Ms. Ziman said.
