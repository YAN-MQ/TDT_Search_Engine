A car carrying a Norwegian television team ran off the road and overturned 
on Wednesday, killing one of the journalists and injuring the other, 
a Norwegian diplomat said. Vavre De Saint-Clair, consul at the Norwegian 
Embassy in the Jordanian capital Amman, said the driver, believed 
to be a Jordanian, also was hurt in the crash. The accident occurred 
350 kilometers (210 miles) west of Baghdad, according to Mohsin Tarfa, 
acting director of the Iraqi Press Center in Baghdad. The car was 
traveling to the Iraqi capital from Amman along a route that is one 
of the few ways into the country because of U.N. sanctions that ban 
air travel. In Oslo, officials at Norway's TV2 said that two of its 
staffers were involved in the accident. They said cameraman Knut Andre 
Danielsen was killed and reporter Anders Saether was injured. Saether 
was expected to be evacuated to Amman for treatment. Danielsen, 33, 
was single and lived in Bergen, which is 500 kilometers (300 miles) 
west of Oslo. He had a degree as a TV director and was an experience 
traveler, TV2 said. The crew had planned to stay in Iraq for about 
four days to produce a feature film. Iraqi officials initially had 
said that three Norwegian journalists were in the car. Nearly all 
visitors to Iraq must take the 12-hour journey through the desert 
from Amman to Baghdad.
