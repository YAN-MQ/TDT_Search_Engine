French Jews strongly support the government's refusal to sell off 
some 2,000 pieces of Nazi-looted art to compensate Holocaust victims 
worldwide, preferring to keep the works in France, a Jewish leader 
said Wednesday. Henri Hajdenberg, President of the Representative 
Council of French Jewish Institutions, said that if the owners aren't 
traced within 10 years, the government should estimate the value, 
then put that sum towards building a new Holocaust center in France. 
``It's an internal French affair,'' Hajdenberg said. ``It's only right 
that the situation be handled by France and French Jews.'' ``There 
is a moral responsibility to create a lasting memory,'' he said in 
a telephone interview. His remarks came after France rejected a plea 
Tuesday in Washington from the World Jewish Congress and the Museum 
of Modern Art to auction the works for the benefit of Holocaust victims 
or their families across the globe. He added that the French National 
Museum Authority is actively tracing ownership of the 2,000 works, 
and said it should be allowed another five to 10 years to complete 
the investigation. Once completed, the state could buy back the works, 
which would remain part of the French national heritage. The money, 
Hajdenberg said, should go into a foundation to finance a new Holocaust 
memorial. He suggested building an extension to the Memorial to the 
Unknown Jewish Martyr in central Paris. Hajdenberg rejected the suggestion 
that the works be put in a special museum. ``There's no homogeneity, 
no theme and the artists aren't Jewish,'' he said. ``The only thing 
they have in common is that they once belonged to Jews and were confiscated 
during the war.''
