All aboard the cruise ship "paradise." At least, all those who don't 
smoke. Carnival cruise lines is enjoying the success of its latest 
promotion while passengers enjoy some fresh air. Here's John Zarrella. 
From stem to Stern. From port to starboard. There's no IFs, ANDs or 
BUTs about it, the cruise ship "paradise" is smoke-free and passengers 
better not light up. They sign a full disclosure. They understand 
it's a nonsmoking vessel, and there will be no recourse to them if 
they are found smoking on board. They'll be escorted off. Carnival 
cruise line's new smoke-free ship began sailing out of miami this 
week. Not even the crew members are allowed to take a puff, anywhere 
on board. You've got a better shot sighting land than spotting an 
ashtray, not even in the casino or at a bar. I'm sitting at the bar 
here right now, and nobody's filtering over into me. That's like a 
delight. Carnival says it decided to build the ship after an in-house 
survey found 75% of its passengers claim to be nonsmokers. Initially, 
when I heard about it, I was wondering if they could actually get 
enough people on a regular basis to fill the ship, but from what I'm 
hearing is, they didn't have any problem filling this whatsoever. 
Carnival admits some travel agents have been leery about booking groups 
who may have some members who smoke. On the other hand, we've had 
a tremendous increase in groups from American lung, American cancer 
society and American heart. Surprisingly, there were some smokers 
on board for whom cold turkey meant more than a midnight snack at 
the buffet line. It doesn't bother me, me, me, me. Not yet. Only been 
on hour. I'll just probably have to drink a lot. For them, paradise 
may be a quick smoke at the first port of call. John Zarrella, CNN, 
Miami.
