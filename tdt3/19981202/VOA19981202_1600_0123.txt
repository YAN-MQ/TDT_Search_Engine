NATO-led troops have arrested a Bosnian Serb general on genocide charges 
in connection with the 1995 massacres near the former U.N. safe haven 
of Srebrenica. Officials at the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague say 
General Radis Lofkerstitch is the first officer still commanding troops 
in Bosnia to be arrested for war crimes.
