Another historic shuttle launch is scheduled for early tomorrow, but 
bad weather could get in the way. A mission weather forecaster says 
approaching showers and a low cloud ceiling could violate launch parameters. 
He says the chances for an on-time launch are 40% to 60%. Shuttle 
"endeavour" will carry the first American piece of the international 
space station. Construction is already a year behind schedule because 
of Russian financial problems.
