Salim Hoss, the American-educated economist appointed prime minister 
on Wednesday, is a veteran of Lebanon's turbulent politics. His 22-year 
political career _ including four terms as prime minister _ has given 
the Sunni Muslim leader one main asset: Muslims and Christians alike 
respect him as an honest public servant in a political establishment 
often seen as corrupt. The legislator from Beirut served as prime 
minister in the most difficult times _ during the 1975-90 civil war 
when the government had little authority. He once took over leadership 
after his predecessor was assassinated and later was himself the target 
of would-be assassins. Hoss was designated by President Emile Lahoud 
on Wednesday to form a new Cabinet. Hoss is less flamboyant than his 
predecessor, Rafik Hariri, but he is known to share Lahoud's goal 
of ridding the public service of corruption. ``God willing, we hope 
to form a government that will be up to the level of challenges, a 
government that fulfills the people's hopes and meets their needs,'' 
Hoss said in his trademark soft voice after accepting the task. Hoss, 
who turns 69 on Dec. 20, is a firm backer of democracy, a free-wheeling 
economy and Christian-Muslim coexistence in Lebanon. In the civil 
war that killed 150,000 people, he refused to align himself with any 
of the rival militias, leading even opponents to once call him ``a 
voice of sanity in a tortured land.'' His religious tolerance was 
put into practice when in 1957 he married a Christian, Leila Pharaon, 
although such a mixed marriage was rare at the time. His wife has 
since died. The couple had one daughter. While in government, the 
tall, balding and bespectacled Hoss lived modestly in a Beirut apartment, 
where he still resides. Outside the government, he was offered detailed, 
point-by-point criticism of government policy in parliamentary debate 
_ while other opposition legislators heaped personal attacks on Hariri. 
Born on Dec. 20, 1929, Hoss is the youngest of five children of a 
lower middle class Sunni family from Beirut. His father, a pharmacist, 
died when he was young. Despite financial strains, he studied business 
at the prestigious American University of Beirut, where he later taught. 
In 1961, he obtained an advanced degree in economics and business 
administration from Indiana University at Bloomington. He became an 
accountant and later worked as a financial adviser in Kuwait. In 1967, 
he headed the Banking Control Commission at Lebanon's Central Bank. 
His switch from banking to politics came in 1976 when President Elias 
Sarkis, a former Central Bank governor, named him to form the Cabinet. 
In Lebanon's then-swift changing governments, he was prime minister 
again in 1987 and twice in 1989. Hoss is a vegetarian who does not 
smoke or drink. He has a passion for Arabic literature and Western 
classical music.
