British Prime Minster Tony Blair is in Northern Ireland to help end 
the deadlock over the Peace Process. The head of the new power-sharing 
assembly, David Trimble, says a deal is now within reach. We're in 
one of these rather tantalizing situations. We're actually very close 
to getting things sorted. It's a matter of getting things maneuvered 
into the right slots. And getting the overall balance right. David 
Trimble.
