Time now for business news. Here's Breck Ardery with the latest from 
Wall Street. Well, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 9,064. 
That was down 69 points. Standard & Poors 500 Index closed at 11,071. 
That was down four points. NASDAQ was off by eight. The stocks were 
down all day. At one point, the Industrial Average had lost 175 points, 
but some late session buying cut those losses. Stock of the Boeing 
Aircraft Company fell sharply after Boeing said it expects sales weakness 
through the year 2000 because of a big drop in orders from Asia. Boeing 
also say it will eliminate 20,000 jobs, but that's on top of the 28,000 
layoffs that they previously announced. Stock of the Sears Roebuck 
Company also fell after the retailer reported an almost four percent 
drop in same store sales last month. In Kellogg, the world's largest 
breakfast cereal company, is going to eliminate more than 500 jobs. 
Kellogg blames the tough competitive situation for the cuts. Once 
again, Dow Jones Industrial Average closing down 69 points.
