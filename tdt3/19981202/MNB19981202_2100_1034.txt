When we come back, a big decision in a case that's garnered national 
attention for decades in this country. What will this latest development 
mean? Renaline rushing. Hearts pounding. Heavy breathing. It's almost 
as much fun as your first date. Royal Caribbean. Like no vacation 
on earth. During the first 30 years of your life you stand in line
