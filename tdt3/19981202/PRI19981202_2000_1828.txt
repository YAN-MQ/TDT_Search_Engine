For The World, this is Pamela McCall. In the BBC News Room, in London. 
Israel says it's stopped any further military withdrawals from the 
West Bank. A statement said there won't be any more troops pulled 
back until the Palestinians meet a number of conditions. They include 
an end to what the Israelis see as the incitement of Palestinians 
to violence. Israelis also want the Palestinian leadership to drop 
its plans to declare an independent state next year.
