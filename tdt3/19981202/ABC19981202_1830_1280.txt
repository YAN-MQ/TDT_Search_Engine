The makers of certain baby rattles and teething toys are being asked 
to take them off the store shelves because they may pose a risk of 
cancer. Last month, "20/20" reported the chemical phthalate, which 
is used to soften some toys, has caused cancer and other health problems 
in lab mice. Several stores have already stopped selling those toys.
