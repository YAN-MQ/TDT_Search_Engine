And sports it is. Ray Kougell is here. It's been a busy time for Major 
League Baseball's Baltimore Orioles. Baltimore signed free agent slugger 
Albert Bell to a five-year, $65 million contract. Bell was introduced 
as the newest Oriole at a news conference in Baltimore Tuesday. He 
said he's anxious to play for the Oriole fans. There's seven out every 
night, you know, and now you have 43,000 screaming fans who are rooting 
for you instead of rooting against you now, and you know, it's definitely 
going to make you play better, and I'm hoping we'll give the fans 
a, you know, a great show for this upcoming year. Bell has more runs 
batted in than any other player in the game since 1991. The left fielder 
will earn an average of $13 million a year playing for Baltimore, 
his third team in four seasons. While playing for the Chicago White 
Sox last season, Bell batted 328 with team records of 48 doubles, 
49 home runs, and 152 runs batted in. Before his two-year tenure with 
the Sox, he played for the Cleveland Indians.
