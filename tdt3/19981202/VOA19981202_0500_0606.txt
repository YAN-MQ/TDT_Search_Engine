The U.S. State Department is once again dashing any Yugoslav hopes 
about the lifting of economic sanctions that have crippled the country 
most of this decade. State Department spokesman James Rubin squarely 
puts the blame for the region's troubles on President Slobodan Milosevic. 
Milosevic has been at the center of every crisis in the former Yugoslavia 
over the last decade. He is not simply part of the problem. Milosevic 
is the problem. We have been promoting democratic practices and reforms 
in Serbia in a number of ways, including through the independent media, 
including democracy assistance programs for fledgling opposition parties. 
That is something we are going to continue to do. As far as what standard 
we will apply to the three issues, and that is Kosovo, cooperation 
with the War Crime Tribunal, and democracy in Serbia itself in order 
to change the sanctions policy, I don't want to proscribe for you 
exactly what those issues would require, simply to say we will know 
cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal when we see it, we will know 
democracy in Serbia when we see it, and we will know a real change 
in the situation in Kosovo when we see it. And we haven't seen any 
of those three things now. State Department spokesman James Rubin 
said the recent purge of several officials in the president's inner 
circle demonstrates that Mr. Milosevic is becoming desperate. The 
spokesman calls the Yugoslav president the original center in all 
the tragedy that has befallen the Balkans in recent years, even though 
he acknowledged Belgrade's cooperation with international demands 
for Kosovo. Mr. Rubin says President Milosevic deserves no credit 
for compromise because he had created the problems in the first place.
