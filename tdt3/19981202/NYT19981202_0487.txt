For all the talk of Microsoft exercising global dominance from the 
empire's capital here in the Seattle area, most residents know that 
the big engine for jobs in the region remains Boeing Co., the nation's 
largest exporter, whose 100,000-strong local work force is eight times 
the size of Microsoft's. The airplane behemoth is the region's biggest 
employer, providing good jobs for tens of thousands of blue-collar 
workers, whose strong union has secured the kinds of wages that enable 
many workers to afford fishing boats and second homes in the Pacific 
Northwest mountains. So when the company announced Tuesday that it 
was cutting 20 percent of its worldwide work force over the next two 
years _ 20,000 jobs in addition to the 28,000 it had announced in 
July _ with many of those cuts planned for the Seattle area, the news 
hit like a chill winter wind. Boeing, one of the 30 stocks that make 
up the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 16.7 percent, or $6.6875, 
to $33.6875 Wednesday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The 
Dow was down 69 points for the day. The chief factor cited by Boeing 
for the company's downturn, the Asian recession, continues to hammer 
at the local economy in other ways as well: exports of all non-aircraft 
products from this heavily trade-dependent state are down more than 
30 percent in the last year, state economists say. And while exporters 
here see signs that Asia's problems may be easing, those projections 
seem to provide little consolation for Boeing workers. ``I can't see 
any quick turnaround,'' said Thomas Plummer, 49, an aircraft test 
technician on the production line for the 747 jumbo jet, as he finished 
the graveyard shift early Wednesday morning. ``I mean, even if things 
get better over there, I can't see Asian airlines rushing out and 
saying, `Hey, let's buy a lot of big planes to celebrate.' You're 
talking $180 million or so for a fully loaded 747. That's a serious 
chunk of change.'' Kevin Moe, 35, a wing mechanic who was laid off 
for four years in the early 1990s and fears a similar fate now, agreed. 
``You've got to think, how many planes do we already have sitting 
in the desert with no customers,'' he said, referring to a collection 
of sparkling new wide-bodied jets that are indeed parked there because 
various airlines, most from Asia, have not been able to pay for their 
orders. ``You'd like to think there was something you could do, work 
harder, whatever'' to stem the company's problems, he added. ``But 
what can you do? It's out of your hands.'' The job cuts represent 
a potentially serious blow to the region's economy, especially because 
the rough rule of thumb is that every job at Boeing creates about 
three other jobs, directly, in related businesses like suppliers, 
or indirectly, in stores and restaurants. No one here seems to think 
that things will be anywhere near as dire as the 1970s, when the company 
cut nearly two-thirds of its work force amid a global recession and 
a notorious sign directed the last person leaving Seattle to turn 
off all the lights. But they are a worrying sign. ``If you look at 
the last Boeing slump, in '91-93, the state economy held up pretty 
well, because of other areas, obviously the high-tech area, but also 
timber and agriculture as well,'' said Charles Hill, a professor at 
the University of Washington's school of business administration. 
``The problem now, of course, is that timber and agriculture are Asian-dependent. 
Go figure. I think it'll hurt us.'' Hill and others noted that the 
Boeing announcement seemed almost strangely late. ``I'm not surprised, 
I'm surprised that people are surprised,'' he said. ``I think this 
has been in the cards for 12 months. ``The moment those economies 
hit the skids,'' he said, referring to Asia, ``this was in the cards.'' 
Bill Whitlow, an analyst with Safeco Asset Management who follows 
Boeing and who serves on Gov. Gary Locke's Council of Economic Advisers, 
said the company ``seems to be the last one to figure out how bad 
it would be'' in Asia. Even with the signs that the economies are 
bouncing back, he said, there is no short-term good news for Boeing. 
``I think it just takes time,'' said Whitlow. ``It will be three or 
four years before you see much of an improvement in deliveries to 
Asia.'' Not everyone here thinks that all of Boeing's problems can 
be traced to Asia. In Wednesday's edition of the online magazine Slate, 
published by Microsoft, James Surowiecki wrote: ``While in part these 
cutbacks represent an aggressive response to a sharp falloff in demand 
from Asia, they're also the result of a failure of management _ production 
line inefficiencies, mismanaged capacity and poor forecasting. Boeing 
needs a new approach, and job-cutting alone isn't it.'' Boeing officials 
said Wednesday that they had renegotiated many contracts with major 
suppliers and were taking other cost-saving measures, which they portrayed 
as helping to ease the problems caused by the fall-off in Asian demand. 
``There are things that we can't control, like the Asian crisis,'' 
said Bob Jorgensen, a Boeing spokesman. ``We work on things we can 
control, and because of those savings those cuts won't be as deep.'' 
Some of the unionized workers coming off their shift early Wednesday 
morning also said they were suspicious that the cutbacks represent 
a bargaining threat for the upcoming battle between the company and 
the aerospace workers union over a new contract. The current one is 
scheduled to expire next September. Three years ago, when the current 
contract was ratified after a 69-day strike, workers claimed a major 
victory for organized labor, including wage increases of about 10 
percent and protection of many health benefits. The bitterness over 
the negotiations quickly subsided, as the nation and the company enjoyed 
a huge economic boom. Amid a surge in demand for Boeing planes, the 
company made big payments for overtime work, hired more workers (21,000 
people in 1996 and 17,000 last year), and pleaded with some retirees 
to come back to the plants. Now, of course, the fear is that the boom 
times are over. And while no specific individuals have yet received 
layoff notices, everyone knows they're coming. ``You live in this 
bubble, waiting for the news,'' said Rolf Vitous, 34, an electrical 
systems installer who has been with the company for two and a half 
years. ``You don't go out and buy a new car, you don't buy a lot of 
Christmas presents, you definitely don't go and buy a new house. You 
lie in the bubble and wait. `` Boeing has jobs in more than half the 
states in the country, including about 42,000 in southern California, 
making it one of the largest single private employers in that region. 
But its presence in Seattle and its environs is huge, and because 
this is the production site for most of the wide-bodied jets for which 
Asian airlines have reduced orders, everyone knows there will be significant 
job cutbacks here. ``This is a boom-and-bust business, and Boeing 
people understand the cyclical nature of it,'' said Plummer, the test 
technician. ``But that doesn't help when you go home and your spouse 
says, `Honey, are you going to have a job tomorrow?' '' While distressed 
about the job cuts, workers here did not seem particularly angry at 
Boeing management, nor did they blame the Asian airlines. ``It's not 
really their fault,'' said Vitous. ``If you order up a shiny new pick-up 
truck and then you lose your job, you don't still go out and buy the 
truck. Well, it's sort of the same thing for them, though we're talking 
about wide-bodied jets.''
