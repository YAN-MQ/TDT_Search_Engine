A roadside gang ambushed two Spanish trucks carrying 505 imported 
pigs late Tuesday, driving the vehicles into a shallow ravine where 
they tipped over, killing and injuring many of the animals. Police 
said they had no information about who was behind the attack, but 
suspicion fell on Portuguese pig farmers who in recent weeks have 
stepped up their protests against falling pork prices. The trucks 
were traveling on a narrow country road just after midnight near Palmela, 
50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Lisbon, when they were stopped by 
a group of about 15 men, police spokesman Paulo Soares said. Some 
wore hoods and one had a pistol, he said. Two of the men boarded the 
trucks and drove them into the ravine. The trucks fell onto their 
sides, crushing some pigs to death and injuring others, Soares said. 
Some pigs escaped and fled into the countryside, Soares said. The 
trucks were on there way to an abattoir near Palmela from Navarra 
in northern Spain. Last week, riot police used water cannon, horses 
and dogs to break up a demonstration of protesting pig farmers who 
had blockaded a road in a rural town. The farmers have also released 
piglets in the center of major cities. They want the government to 
give them more financial aid and place restrictions on pork imports.
