Boeing says half of newly announced job cuts will come through retirement, 
voluntary resignations and other attrition. Yesterday, the aircraft 
manufacturer announced it would lay off another 20,000 people over 
the next two years, in addition to 28,000 cuts previously announced. 
Boeing's chairman says up to 90% of the layoffs will be in the company's 
commercial airline production plants. Operations in the Seattle area 
will be hardest hit. Boeing says it will cut production of 747s by 
more than half. The company is blaming the Asian economic crunch. 
Reduced travel in Asian markets has reduced the demand for planes.
