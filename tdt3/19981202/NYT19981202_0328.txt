In a widely expected move intended to help revive its ailing cereal 
business, Kellogg Co. said Wednesday that it would dismiss 525 salaried 
employees from its North American operations and would eliminate 240 
of about 600 contracted positions. Kellogg, the maker of Rice Krispies 
and Frosted Flakes, said it would take a one-time charge against fourth-quarter 
profits of $45 million, or 11 cents a share, to pay for the job cuts, 
which the company expects will reduce annual expenses by about $105 
million. Those savings would help offset increased spending on product 
development and promotions. Kellogg said most of the job cuts, which 
will affect 21 percent of its salaried work force, would come from 
operations at its headquarters in Battle Creek, Mich., but that about 
25 percent would come from sales division and plants elsewhere in 
North America. ``Our strategy is centered on increasing growth in 
our ready-to-eat cereal business, accelerating the expansion of our 
convenience foods and continu/usly improving the cost efficiency of 
our operations worldwide,'' said Arnold Langbo, chairman and chief 
executive. Investors were not impressed. Shares of Kellogg fell 93.75 
cents, to $36.375. The market reaction, analysts and fund managers 
said, was a signal to the company that management would have to take 
more decisive action to improve the company's long-term prospects. 
``We consider this to be the first step in what is likely to be a 
long journey to turn the company around,'' said Eric Katzman, an analyst 
at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. So far, the analysts and fund managers 
said, management has offered few details about how it plans to compete 
more effectively as bagel makers and manufacturers of cheaper, private-label 
cereals continue to erode Kellogg's sales. The company's revenue and 
profits have plummeted. Last month, Kellogg reported a 32 percent 
drop in third-quarter profits, to $141.9 million, or 35 cents a share, 
and warned that earnings for the full year would be disappointing, 
possibly falling as much as 20 percent.
