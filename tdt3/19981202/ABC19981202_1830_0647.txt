We have a report tonight about keeping secrets. In the battle against 
international terrorism, the FBI and CIA have been trying to get along 
-- to cooperate and share their secretes more than before. Most people 
say it's working, but a lot can go wrong. And ABC's John Miller reports 
tonight on one case where it has in a big way. After the bombing of 
the two U.S. embassies in Africa, the CIA called on all cooperative 
intelligence services to share whatever information they had about 
suspected terrorists with connections to osama bin laden. Some of 
the most alarming information came from bugs planted by the Italian 
intelligence service in this apartment house in Turin. The Italian 
agents were eavesdropping on a terrorist the CIA brought the fBI into 
the loop. Then the FBI went out of the loop, passing the information 
on to the italian national police. The Italian police raided the house, 
arresting three suspectedded terrorists and seizing weapons and ammunition. 
The problem was, the FBI did not tell the Italian police that their 
information came from Italian intelligence. In fact, the Italian intelligence 
agents first learned of the raid live when their bugs recorded the 
sound of police breaking down the door. Italian intelligence had hoped 
the bugs would help them identify more members of bin laden's terrorist 
cells and felt the raid blew their investigation. Officials at both 
the FBI told us today there was a lack of communication between the 
two agencies in this case. They pointed communication in this case 
between the Italian intelligence service and its own police wasn't 
much better. John Miller, ABC News, New York.
