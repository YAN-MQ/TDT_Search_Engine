An Indonesian trade union leader criticised the Australian government 
Wednesday, saying it was behaving like an international public relations 
company for former President Suharto. In Australia for the Australian 
Council of Trade Unions annual council meeting, Muchtar Pakpahan said 
the federal government was defending the ``human rights violations 
of the corrupt Suharto regime.'' ``The Australian government has become 
the public relations of Suharto ... at the human rights summit meeting 
in Geneva last year, only the Australians said that human rights in 
Indonesia were very good,'' he told reporters. Pakpahan's criticisms 
echoed those of Nobel Peace laureate Jose Ramos Horta, who said Australia's 
most vocal protests against Indonesian human rights violations were 
made during the term of the former Labor government. Jailed by the 
Suharto government for organizing unions, Pakpahan, who is national 
chairman of the Indonesian Prosperity Trade Union Federation Central 
Board, also said Prime Minister John Howard's government had tried 
to block his visit to Australia. ``When I went to the Australian Embassy 
to apply for a visa I was told that because I had been jailed I would 
not be able to be given one,'' he said. ``To fight for democracy in 
a country like Indonesia you have to expect to be jailed, so why is 
it that Australian officials want to ban people fighting for a democracy.'' 
Pakpahan said his visa was granted after an appeal. Indonesian trade 
unions needed financial and administrative support and Australia was 
noticeably missing from the nations who had provided such support, 
Pakpahan said. ACTU assistant secretary Bill Mansfield said an approach 
would be made to the Australian government asking it to follow the 
lead of the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Norway and Finland. 
``Australia is the closest and largest economy to Indonesia and if 
a country as far away as Finland can give help to the emerging union 
movement, then surely we can,'' he said. Indonesian unions also wanted 
to establish an alternate food supply, to bypass what Pakpahan described 
as the ``corrupt food chain'' that delivered rice at inflated prices 
to impoverished Indonesians. He had also asked the ACTU to provide 
his union movement with money to fund training courses and build meeting 
rooms.
