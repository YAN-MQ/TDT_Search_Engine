Falling prices are helping high-tech gadgets rise to the top of many 
holiday shopping lists. Ann Kellan has more in this edition of "tech 
trends." Video games and computers top the wish list of what adults 
and kids want this holiday season. That's according to a consumer 
electronics manufacturers association survey. Spokesman Jim Barry 
says other high-tech gadgets are gaining popularity. One reason -- 
prices are coming down. One thing that's hot this year is the dvd, 
the digital video disc. It's a five-inch disc that plays movies as 
well as music. You are such a typical dog. Storage is one of the big 
hassles a lot of us have with our CDs. And a lot of companies have 
solved that problem now with CD changers that are basically jukeboxes. 
They'll store 200 CDs. Dpu want to make your own music, you can record 
your CDs now. That's another thing in which the prices have come down. 
This one from Phillips is about $500 or so. Just a few years ago, 
you wouldn't be able to buy one of those for less than $2,000. Now, 
this is the mini disk. It's less expensive. You can record on it oev 
aerntd giver again, right, Jim? They've been around for a few years. 
They've taken off quickly in Japan and Europe and are starting to 
move along here now. They are portable and recordable. Jim, you say 
digital camcorders are thot year. The prices have gotten lower and 
pictures are terrific. You can take a still picture with the video. 
The prices have come down under $1,000. Cordless phones are gift items. 
At the high end, if you have an extra $3,000. Can you keep the road 
warrior connected from almost anywhere in the world. Speaking of spenceive 
gifts, how about high definition TV. This one is $4,000, but soon 
we'll be able to say, the price is coming down, right, Jim? You are 
absolutely right. True of all this electronic stuff. Ann Kellan, CNN,
