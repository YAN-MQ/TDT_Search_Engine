The Press Complaints Commission ruled Wednesday that a British newspaper 
was justified in buying a story from the family of Louise Woodward, 
the au pair convicted in Massachusetts of killing the baby in her 
care. The sum of money paid by the Daily Mail for an interview with 
Ms. Woodward's parents was not revealed. But the industry's self-regulatory 
body rejected complaints about it, saying the article published last 
year was in the public interest. Payment had been necessary to get 
the interview and did not provide a profit for the Woodwards, the 
commission said. Ms. Woodward, convicted of killing 8-month-old Matthew 
Eappen, was originally found guilty of second-degree murder in 1997. 
The verdict was reduced to manslaughter by the trial judge, who then 
set her free. The Daily Mail paid for an interview with her parents 
between the first and second verdicts in the case _ before the conviction 
was reduced from murder to manslaughter. The voluntary press code 
says payments can be made to criminals or their associates if there 
is a public interest defense and if it is necessary to secure publication. 
``Payment was necessary because of the obvious financial plight of 
the Woodwards,'' the commission said. The article was in the public 
interest, it ruled, because the interviews released new information 
to the public and formed ``an integral part of the newspaper's campaign 
on a matter of significant public controversy.'' ``On each of the 
central tests applied by the commission... the newspaper's justification 
under the code could not be faulted,'' the announcement said. The 
commission said the money was used by Ms. Woodward's mother, Sue, 
to help her daughter's legal fight, and there was nothing left over. 
``We are pleased that after two exhaustive meetings, the PCC has concluded 
that the Mail's interview with Louise Woodward's parents was in the 
public interest,'' a statement from the newspaper said. The commission 
is an independent body that rules on complaints against the media 
by the public or competing publications. Such rulings do not carry 
financial penalties for the offenders. The Guild of Editors welcomed 
its adjudication in the Woodward case as a ``common sense'' decision 
showing ``self-regulation of the press working at its best.'' ``As 
a general rule criminals and their families should not benefit from 
their actions,'' the guild said. ``In this case they did not. ... 
Newspapers have long been the guardians of individuals and campaigners 
for justice.'' A U.S. federal judge ruled on Nov. 19 that Louise Woodward 
is liable for punitive damages and set a January trial date to decide 
the amount she must pay. Frederic Ellis, lawyer for Matthew's parents, 
said the couple sued because they do not want Ms. Woodward to become 
rich because she killed their child. She is now under court order 
to inform the U.S. district judges if she enters into a contract to 
be paid for her story.
