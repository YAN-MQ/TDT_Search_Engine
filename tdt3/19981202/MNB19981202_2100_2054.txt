When we come back from "dateline NBC," an update on a story receiving 
increasing attention these days, largely because it's being compared 
to another famous case. John was brilliant. We'll miss his brilliant 
conversations. John knew everything. We'll miss his knowledge. John 
wrote that consolidated contract. He didn't even tell us where he 
put it. Now they're really consumed with grief. If only they knew 
John scanned all of his documents... into the Xerox document center. 
He made them digital and put every last one of them on the company 
website. I wonder what John would do in this situation. He'd check 
your website to see if the Xerox document center... scanned in the 
consolidated contract. Hey, I just had a thought. Oh, there's a good 
place to start. You don't think John scanned the contract into the, 
uh, the-- the Xerox document center. Xerox document center, do you? 
John was smart, but he wasn't that smart. Ooohhh! I don't think John 
liked that.
