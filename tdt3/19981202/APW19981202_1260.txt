Inmates at one of Puerto Rico's largest prisons attacked guards with 
stones and sticks during a riot Wednesday that eventually was quelled 
with tear gas. Ten guards and 17 inmates were injured, none seriously, 
at Las Cucharas prison in southern Ponce. Police said they were unsure 
what provoked the violence. The riot occurred in the main section 
of the prison, which holds between 200 and 300 of the complex's 6,000 
inmates, said police Lt. Col. Hector Luis Rodriguez. Police ringed 
the prison during the riot to prevent escapes. Puerto Rico's prisons 
have been plagued by riots, gang violence and a lack of staff, prompting 
a court-appointed monitor to recommend last year that the prison system 
be put under a federally supervised receivership. The Puerto Rican 
government is arguing in court that this is unnecessary.
