In a case that has sparked protests overseas, a judge ruled Wednesday 
that 30 young elephants were cruelly treated and awarded temporary 
custody to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
``This has become of public interest and is not private interest anymore,'' 
Judge Herman Glas said in ruling in the case of the elephants. They 
were snatched from their families from a game reserve in Botswana 
and were destined to be sold to zoos in Europe and to a safari park 
in China. Glas said the animals had been neglected under their owner, 
Riccardo Ghiazza, who runs African Game Services. The NSPCA said the 
elephants had been abused by Ghiazza's trainers, who hobbled them, 
deprived them of water and prodded them so often it caused open sores. 
``I am persuaded that with more care (injuries) could have been prevented,'' 
Glas said. ``These elephants have been neglected.'' In October, animal-rights 
activists dumped coal in front of the South African Embassy in Washington 
to protest the treatment of the animals. A protest was also held at 
the country's embassy in London. Britain's Spice Girls pop group and 
rocker Chrissie Hynde have appealed to South African President Nelson 
Mandela to prevail on his Botswana counterpart, Festus Mogae, to help 
the elephants return to their families. Final custody will be decided 
later. Crminal charges of cruelty may yet be lodged against Ghiazza, 
whose lawyer had maintained that the treatment of the elephants was 
valid under South African law. ``It's not the aim to raise the animals 
to the level of human rights,'' attorney Nic van der Walt had told 
the judge.
