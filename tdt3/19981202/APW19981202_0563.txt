The European Commission decided Wednesday to take France to the European 
Court for its failure to comply to EU laws regarding the hunting and 
protection of wild birds. ``French legislation fails to guarantee 
complete protection of wild bird species during their return to their 
breeding grounds and during nesting and rearing,'' the Commission 
said in a statement Wednesday, adding France was also not respecting 
other rules for four wild bird species. France's hunting seasons for 
wild birds are too long, according to the Commission. They start too 
early, often up to 7 weeks before young birds become independent of 
their parents, and they end too late when migration has already started. 
For four species of wild birds (three kinds of Gull and the Cormorant), 
neither deliberate killing or capture nor destruction or theft of 
nests and eggs are legally forbidden as required by EU law. The Commission 
warned France more than five months ago that legal action would go 
ahead if France did not comply with EU legislation, but France's answer 
``does not reveal any move towards compliance'' said the statement.
