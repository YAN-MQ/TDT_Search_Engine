A bomb blew up a high-voltage electricity tower, blacking out several 
towns in southern Albania, the power company said Wednesday. Government 
officials called bombing a ``clear terrorist act'' aimed at destabilizing 
the country. Police are investigating but have no suspects yet. The 
incident occured late Tuesday, near the Western port of Durres, 35 
kilometers (20 miles) west of Tirana, when the explosion toppled one 
of two towers in the region that supply power to hundreds of thousands 
of people, local media reported. Local police found four unexploded 
bombs, containing TNT, at the site of the explosion near Durres, said 
Artan Bizhga, a spokesman for Albania's Interior Ministry which oversees 
public security. Officials at Albania's Electropower Corporation estimated 
the damage at around dlrs 25,000. While officials repair the downed 
tower, several southern Albanian towns will have no electricity while 
power shortages will affect Tirana and Durres. Bombings and random 
acts of violence are common in Albania, where police have little or 
no control over many rural regions.
