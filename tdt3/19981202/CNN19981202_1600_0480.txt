This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Thursday. The northwestern part of the country continues 
to be wet and windy with mountain snow, as a front pushes south and 
east and another weak front pushes into the northwest. An area of 
low pressure will produce a few showers and storms through the south 
plains. Much of the southeastern U.S. remains quiet and mild. In the 
northeast, just slightly cooler with a front that drags through. 30s 
and 40s for northern New England and the northwest. Much of the country 
though will see 50s or warmer. Looking ahead to Friday, look for rain 
and snow in the northwest with showers and storms through the Mississippi 
river valley. Cool in the northwest, still very warm in the southeast. 
On Saturday, most of the north will see wet weather with the temperatures 
remaining about the same. Sunday, not much change in temperature. 
Rain in the northwest. Wind, rain and thunderstorms across the Mississippi 
valley into the northeast. Don't forget, you can find four-day forecasts 
for more than 7,200 cities on cNN interactive at CNN.com.
