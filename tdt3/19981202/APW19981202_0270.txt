A car carrying three Norwegian journalists ran off the road and overturned 
on Wednesday, killing one of the journalists and injuring the other 
two, an Iraqi official said. A diplomat at the Norwegian Embassy in 
the Jordanian capital Amman said the driver, believed to be a Jordanian, 
also was hurt in the crash. The accident occurred 350 kilometers (210 
miles) west of Baghdad. The crew was traveling to the Iraqi capital 
from Amman along a route that is one of the few ways into the country 
because of U.N. sanctions that ban air travel. The crew was from Norway's 
TV2, said Mohsin Tarfa, acting director of the Iraqi Press Center 
in Baghdad. Officials at TV2 in Oslo declined to identify the journalists 
until their families were notified. The two injured Norwegians were 
taken to a hospital in Baghdad, Tarfa said. It was not immediately 
clear whether the driver required hospitalization, according to the 
Norwegian diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Nearly all 
visitors to Iraq must take the 12-hour journey through the desert 
from Amman to Baghdad.
