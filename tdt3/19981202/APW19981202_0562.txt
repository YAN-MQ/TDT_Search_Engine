Former 5,000-meter world record-holder David Moorcroft on Wednesday 
was named chief executive of UK Athletics, the new governing body 
of track and field in Britain. Moorcroft has been been running the 
organization on an interim basis following the financial collapse 
last year of the British Athletics Federation. Moorcroft's appointment 
was expected and one of the first acts of former Olympic hurdles champion 
David Hemery, who was elected last month as the new president. One 
of Moorcroft's long-term challenges will be to lure the World Championships 
to London in 2003, with a revamped Wembley Stadium as the venue. The 
IAAF, the governing body of world track and field, said last month 
it was considering awarding the 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009 worlds at 
the same time. In no particular order, London, Paris, Tokyo and Berlin 
are expected to be the sites.
