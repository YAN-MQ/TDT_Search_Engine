Organizers have announced the first Formula One race in the United 
States since 1991 will be run at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 
the year 2000. From Indianapolis, Tom Akins has details of the agreement. 
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corporation and the Formula One Administration, 
Ltd. have reached an agreement in principle to return Formula One 
racing to the United States in the year 2000. The exact date for the 
U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis will be announced in the future. Bernie 
Eckelstone, CEO of Formula One Administration is pleased with the 
move. Because it's the obvious place for us to be, and we're comfortable 
that the speedway can give us exactly what we want in the way of facilities. 
A permanent 4.076 kilometer circuit will be built at the speedway 
using the existing main straight of way and 13 turns winding through 
the present track. Tony George, president of the Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway, says it's time for a change. Things change, and while this 
facility is best known for the Indianapolis 500, and has been known 
for the Indianapolis 500 for 80-plus years, you know, this package 
is very nice. It complicates our facility very much. The last Formula 
One race in the United States occurred in Phoenix in 1991. Tom Akins, 
Indianapolis.
