Andrei Kovalenko kicked Spain to the rugby union World Cup finals 
with six penalties in a 21-17 victory over Portugal Wednesday even 
though the beaten Portuguese scored the only two tries of the match. 
A drop goal from center Fernando Diez completed the Spanish scoring 
at Murrayfield, the home of Scottish rugby, with his team already 
leading 18-10 near the end. Rohan Hofman then scored Portugal's second 
try to go with the score from Thiery Teixeira earlier in the game. 
Spain and Scotland, who hammered the Portuguese 85-11 on Saturday, 
advance to the finals in October next year while Portugal must face 
Uruguay in a playoff game. Fly halves Teixeira and Kovalenko each 
kicked a penalty in the opening three minutes, and the Spanish kicker 
edged his team ahead 6-3 before his team was down to 14 men. Flank 
forward Jose Diaz was shown the yellow card for preventing Portugal 
taking a quick penalty and, when he argued the decision with English 
referee Steve Lander, he was shown the red one. Four minutes later 
the Portuguese then took the lead with a try he constructed himself 
with a net chip forward. He collected the ball and touched down by 
the posts and followed up with a conversion which put the Portuguese 
10-6 ahead. But the Spaniards turned the score around with Kovalenko 
kicking two more penalties to give his team a 12-10 halftime lead. 
He stretched that to 18-10 before the drop goal by Diez in the final 
minute put the game beyond the Portuguese, despite the late try by 
Hofman.
