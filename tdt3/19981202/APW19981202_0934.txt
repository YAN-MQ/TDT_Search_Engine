Germany on Wednesday stuck with its call for NATO to drop a doctrine 
allowing it to use nuclear weapons before first being targeted, but 
pledged to abide by any alliance decision to uphold the policy. The 
United States has been irritated by the German proposal, made as part 
of a NATO debate on overhauling its doctrine after the end of the 
Cold War. Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer raised the point with U.S. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on his first visit to Washington 
after Germany's new left-leaning government took office in October. 
Fischer and Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping, who tried to play down 
his colleague's comments during a visit to Washington last week, went 
before parliamentary committees Wednesday to clarify their position, 
stating that Germany will go along with whatever NATO decides at its 
April meeting. They insisted that NATO's strategy debate must be open 
to all ideas, but that there will be ``no separate German way'' from 
its allies, according to a Foreign Ministry official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. Fischer, who led the anti-nuclear demonstrations 
in the 1980s when the United States based nuclear warheads in Germany, 
said the security situation in Europe has changed significantly since 
the first-strike option was adopted. However, the position has been 
criticized abroad and by opponents at home who say nuclear weapons 
are still needed as deterrents to chemical and biological weapons, 
which NATO does not have.
