In China today, there has been an extraordinary reaction to the arrests 
of two pro-democracy activists. Now, nearly 200 other protesters, 
risking their own safety have joined the challenge. ABC's Jim Laurie 
is in Beijing. Xu wenli is the best known dissident still in China. 
He's been trying to form the first opposition political party in 50 
years. That's why he and his colleagues are in jail. In an open letter 
released today 190 democracy activists wrote -- "the arrests expose 
the hypocrisy of the Chinese government." 19 others said they planned 
to stage hunger strikes. The movement to form a political party was 
begun when President Clinton came to China last summer. It gained 
strength when China signed international covenant of human rights 
in October. But that treaty may not matter much. The head of China's 
parliament, Li Peng, warns, "groups seeking a Multiparty system will 
not be allowed to exist." Jim Laurie, ABC News, Beijing.
