The chairman of Rover Group, a subsidiary of Germany's BMW AG, stepped 
down Wednesday, saying he felt ``quite strongly that somebody has 
to be prepared to stand up and be counted'' for the company's failure 
to make a profit. The resignation of Walter Haselkuss _ whom BMW had 
appointed as chairman of Rover _ came as the British automaker disclosed 
proposals for job cuts, innovative working hours, government aid and 
new investment intended to propel the company into profitability. 
The announcement was made two days after Volvo AB, the Swedish maker 
of cars, buses, trucks and construction equipment, said it planned 
layoffs of 5,300 workers _ 7 percent of its work force _ reflecting 
worries among European automakers about a slowdown in global markets. 
At a time when Britain is locked in dispute with other members of 
the European Union, particularly Germany and France, about proposals 
to ``harmonize'' some European taxes, BMW's rescue strategy _ based 
on the flexible work-hours system used at its plants in Germany _ 
offered a vivid example of how businesses are establishing Europe-wide 
practices. ``If the British auto industry can't go along with this, 
it's a very bad sign about the industry going forward,'' said Nick 
Snee, an analyst with J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. BMW bought Rover from 
British Aerospace in 1994 and has been constantly frustrated by the 
unit's inability to make a profit in the high-margin British auto 
market. Haselkuss, who has been with BMW for 22 years, had taken a 
high profile in recent months, contending that the strong British 
pound undermined Rover's exports and exposed it to cheaper imports. 
``The British car market is profitable, but part of that is because 
the pound is very strong,'' Snee said. ``Cars made in France and sold 
in Britain make a profit, but Rover is losing money. Part of Rover's 
problem has been that the pound has been so strong that imports are 
cheaper.'' Haselkuss will be replaced by Werner Samann, another executive 
with 22 years of service at BMW. For the last six years, he has been 
head of the BMW engine and chassis division. Along with the change 
at the top, BMW also announced proposals Wednesday to cut 2,500 jobs 
from Rover's work force of 39,000 and to introduce a system of flexible 
work hours based on a four-day, 35-hour week. The BMW system allows 
the company to pay standard wages for overtime, including night and 
Saturday shifts, when demand is high. But it also permits workers 
to collect up to 200 overtime hours to be taken as time off when demand 
is low. The current workweek at Rover is 37 hours over five days plus 
paid overtime. The new system is similar to the work schedule at BMW 
plants in Germany, where the company says it produces flexibility 
and efficiency. BMW also offered to invest $3.2 billion more in the 
company provided the British government comes up with financial aid, 
reportedly worth $400 million, for the development of new models. 
There was no immediate guarantee of aid from British officials, who 
largely welcomed the plan. A key part of the deal is that it will 
insure the continued use of Rover's biggest plant, at Longbridge near 
Birmingham. Union leaders urged Rover's workers to accept the proposals 
when they vote on them later this month. ``The work force cannot afford 
to reject it,'' Ken Jackson, a union leader, said. BMW executives 
said the proposals would save $247 million a year by 2000 _the date 
BMW has set for pushing Rover into profit.
