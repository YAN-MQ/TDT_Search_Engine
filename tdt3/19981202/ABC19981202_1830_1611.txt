Finally tonight -- a "last word" about jobs, government jobs. More 
to the point -- how to get young men and women to take Navy jobs. 
The Navy needs more than a few good men. Naval recruitment is off 
by 7,000 this year. So the Navy has produced a new recruiting film, 
from which it will produce tV ads. Next year, it will spend 80 million 
today's broadcast those ads. Focus groups tell the Navy young people 
don't like the idea of all work and no play. So what do the pictures 
show? Basketball. Skating. On the town in New York and endorsements 
of a new Navy. You can have a family and live in a nice townhouse 
in a good town. I go bike riding, I go skating. Old salts may be asking, 
where are the pictures of decks, paints halls, polishing and repolishing 
brass? Don't they do that in the Navy anymore? Well, of course they 
do. There is still a big difference between recruiting and reality.
