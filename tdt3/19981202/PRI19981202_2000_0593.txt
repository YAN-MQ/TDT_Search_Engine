At the White House this afternoon, President Clinton confronted another 
Asian nation about its nuclear ambitions. He met with Pakistan's Prime 
Minister Omar Sharif. Whose government tested nuclear devices last 
spring in response to similar test by its rival, India. The World's 
Owen Faye reports. The Pakistani Prime Minister wants to restore the 
relationship his country enjoyed with the U.S. As a strategic ally 
during the Cold War. At today's meeting with President Clinton, Omar 
Sharif is pressing for increased economic aid. But his country is 
under scrutiny by the U.S. Because of its nuclear programs. After 
India and Pakistan conducted testing in May, President Clinton imposed 
economic sanctions, as required by American law. But Clinton has waived 
some of those sanctions until October of 1999. In the hope of retaining 
an influence over the arms race in Southeast Asia. These talks come 
at a time when the Clinton Administration appears to have resolved 
the contentious issue between Washington and Islamabad. In 1989, Pakistan 
paid the U.S. close to $700 million for 28 F-16 fighter planes. The 
following year, the Bush Administration canceled the order. Because 
it suspected Pakistan was developing nuclear weapons. But Pakistan 
was never refunded for the F-16s. Now there is a plan to lease some 
of the fighter planes to New Zealand. Enabling Pakistan to recoup 
some of its losses. With this issue out of the way, the Clinton Administration 
hopes to increase the pressure on Pakistan to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. For The World, I'm Owen Faye, in Washington.
