President Clinton said today he was "very concerned" about the prospect 
of more layoffs at Boeing, which is the nation's biggest exporter. 
Mr. Clinton said an economic recovery in Asia is the key to getting 
companies like Boeing back on track. But Asia is not the only problem. 
At Boeing headquarters near Seattle, here's ABC's Brian Rooney. For 
the people who make Boeing's jets, this is a familiar cycle of boom 
-- and now the bust. The whole time I've worked here it's been hire 
a bunch of people, lay them off, hire a bunch of people, lay them 
off. I grew up with this. My dad is a retired Boeing engineer and 
he was laid off. Boeing blamed much of its trouble on the downturn 
in the Asian economy. Two dozen jets parked in the Arizona desert 
are evidence that with a slump in air travel, several Asian airlines 
can't afford to buy the planes they ordered. But much of this is the 
result of internal problems that came during the boom while Boeing 
tried to fill record orders for airplanes too quickly. Usually when 
they produce sort of the peak of the cycle, when they're producing 
the most airplanes, they make the most money. That didn't happen this 
time because of the production problems. In a two-year period, Boeing 
hired 445,000 new workers, many of who had to be trained and at the 
same time was having trouble getting parts in time to put them in 
the planes. So basically, what they do is put the plane together then 
they have to take the plane apart to put a particular component in 
it. One Boeing official said this morning that it has taken 20% to 
30% more hours of labor to build jets than it did in 1992. And some 
analysts said Boeing announced even bigger layoffs just to impress 
investors, with its determination to cut costs and make profits. Analysts 
also question whether Boeing actually will lay off 48,000 employees. 
Despite cutting back, Boeing still plans its biggest production run 
ever next year. Given the production problems, it could be hard to 
make planes and money with so many fewer workers to do it. Brian Rooney, 
ABC News, Seattle.
