The Mets put one further touch on their off-season shopping spree 
Wednesday when they agreed on a four-year deal worth $32 million for 
the five-time Gold Glove third baseman Robin Ventura. Ventura's free-agent 
signing, which had been expected, was the third signing for at least 
$8 million that the Mets have made since they missed qualifying for 
the playoffs on the season's final day. Earlier this fall, general 
manager Steve Phillips signed Mike Piazza to a 7-year, $91 million 
deal and Al Leiter for 4 years at $32 million. Both Piazza and Leiter, 
as well as Dennis Cook (who re-signed with the Mets for 3 years and 
$6.6 million), were apparently instrumental in Ventura's decision 
to sign with the Mets instead of the Baltimore Orioles. Ventura said 
that both Piazza and Leiter had phoned him in the last two weeks, 
while he had called Cook on his own. ``They did maybe a little bit 
of recruiting,'' said Ventura, a lifetime .274 hitter in nine-plus 
seasons with the Chicago White Sox. The money, of course, had something 
to do with the signing, too. Ventura had been seeking exactly what 
the Mets gave him. But Ventura said his decision had more to do with 
the Mets' chances of winning. ``Obviously, they gave me a great contract,'' 
said the 31-year-old Ventura, who needed a strong final month to hit 
.263 last season with 21 homers and 91 runs batted in. ``And now they 
have a vested interest in me. But again, I looked at the potential 
for winning as a major consideration.'' And with a revamped offense, 
the Mets are confident that they have the chance to do just that. 
After trading for Bobby Bonilla and then trading Todd Hundley and 
obtaining outfielder Roger Cedeno and the hard-throwing right-handed 
reliever Armando Benitez in a three-team deal, the Mets' only remaining 
need is for a corner outfielder who can lead off. And that might come 
soon _ in the form of Rickey Henderson, who will turn 40 on Christmas 
Day but led the major leagues in stolen bases last season with 66. 
His representatives, who also count Piazza, Bonilla and closer John 
Franco as clients, were scheduled to meet with Phillips either late 
Wednesday night or Thursday to talk money for the first time with 
the Mets. Henderson is believed to be seeking a contract for at the 
least one year with an option for a second _ or more preferably, two 
guaranteed years _ at around $2 million per season. According to one 
of his representatives, Dan Horwits, the Oakland Athletics, for whom 
he has been playing; the Seattle Mariners and possibly the Texas Rangers 
are also interested in Henderson. The Mets, meanwhile, have had a 
number of discussions with Henderson's representatives, but were waiting 
to see if they would sign Ventura _ and consequently move Edgardo 
Alfonzo to second base _ or sign the free agent outfielder B.J. Surhoff 
and leave Alfonzo at third before they committed to where they wanted 
their leadoff hitter to play. Wednesday, Phillips insisted his main 
priority all along had been to sign the left-handed- hitting Ventura, 
who could bat behind the right-handed hitting Piazza and in front 
of the switch-hitting Bonilla in a lineup that figures to have much 
more pop than last season's version, although Valentine wasn't quite 
ready to put Ventura into his accustomed No. 5 slot just yet. Still, 
Valentine was obviously excited about having Ventura, calling the 
signing ``the crowning blow to a really nice winter.'' ``I'm really 
more excited about this team and lineup,'' Valentine said. ``Last 
year, we began the season with our catcher hitting seventh and our 
shortstop hitting eighth, with John Olerud and Edgardo Alfonzo hitting 
somewhere, and with a lot of question marks.'' Now, with Ventura (who 
won his fifth Gold Glove this season) at third and Rey Ordonez (who 
has won two consecutive Gold Gloves) at short, the Mets easily have 
the strongest left side of the infield in baseball. And with Alfonzo 
shifting back to second and the always steady Olerud at first, the 
Mets may have the strongest defensive infield as well.
