Time now for a look at the weather. We go to NBC TV in New York. For 
tonight's purposes, ground Christmas zero. Janice huff. Janice? Another 
holiday season is officially under way in New York City with the lighting 
of the Christmas tree in Rockefeller center. It was the 66th annual 
lighting. Here's a live picture right downstairs. This is our roof 
camera. Isn't she lovely? The tree came all the way from Ohio, and 
it's about 74 feet tall. We take a picture -- or a look at some of 
the pictures that were taken earlier when the tree was lit at about 
8:57 P.M. eastern standard time. That's when the lights came on. And 
our first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, was one of the folks right 
there to help turn on the lights. It is a beautiful sight. We get 
to enjoy that all the way until January 3 in New York.
