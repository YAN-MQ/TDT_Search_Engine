Computer software billionaire Bill Gates has made a lot of money in 
the computer industry, but he likes and supports books, too. Mr. Gates, 
the chairman of Microsoft, and his wife, Melinda, are donating $20 
million to the Seattle, Washington Public Library System. A spokesman 
for Mr. Gates says it's the biggest single gift ever made to a public 
library system. About $15 million of the pledge will help expand and 
improve neighborhood libraries, $4 million will improve book collections, 
and $1 million will support literacy and English language programs 
in Seattle, all worthy causes. And be they are.
