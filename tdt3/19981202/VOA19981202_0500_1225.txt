Former heavy weight boxing champion Mike Tyson has pleaded no contest 
to charges of assaulting two men after a minor traffic accident last 
August. The 32-year-old Tyson appeared in a Montgomery County, Maryland 
District Court Tuesday to enter his plea. He admitted to losing his 
temper at the accident scene and said he was under psychiatric care. 
Although the plea is not an admission of guilt, Tyson could face up 
to 20 years in prison, ten for each count, when he is sentenced in 
January. Tyson has reached an out-of-court settlement with the two 
men involved in the case in order to avoid a civil trial. They claim 
Tyson kicked and punched them after the accident.
