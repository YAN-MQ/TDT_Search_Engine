A South African judge has ordered a famous group of baby elephants 
to be placed in protective custody because their owner was treating 
them cruelly. The pachyderms' plight first came to light earlier this 
year. That's when animal rights groups distributed pictures of 30 
hobbled baby elephants stumbling around a farm yard. Since then, celebrities 
like the Spice Girls singing group have urged President Nelson Mandela 
to save the baby elephants who were taken from their mothers in Botswana 
for sale to zoos and circuses. Today in Britz near Pretoria, Judge 
Herman Glass said there was clear evidence of abuse. He granted temporary 
custody of the baby elephants to the National Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Animals. Sounds very good. I think he did the wise thing.
