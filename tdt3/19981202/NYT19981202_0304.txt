``A book must be the ax for the frozen sea inside us,'' wrote Kafka 
to a friend, but the holiday gift books rounded up below seem unwieldy 
for Kafka's purpose. Think of them instead as conversation pieces 
to break the ice, or works of beauty warm enough to melt it. They 
are arranged approximately according to their prices. `HOW TO SKIP 
STONES: AND 43 MORE OF LIFE'S FORGOTTEN PLEASURES.' Cover design by 
Matt Adamec. (97 pages. Hyperion. Paperback. $9.95.) Or how to fly 
a kite, catch a snowflake on your tongue, take a nap, tickle, fish, 
be spontaneous. It isn't the instructions that matter so much here 
in this booklet that was published in hardcover last year with the 
title ``Balance''; for instance, how you give a foot massage is: 1. 
``Find someone with feet.'' 2. ``Rub firmly, deliberately pushing 
outwardly with thumbs. (No tickling.)'' 3. ``Beg recipient to return 
favor.'' What counts are the reminders of the simple silly things 
you used to do before life got complicated. `THE SPORTING NEWS SELECTS 
BASEBALL'S 100 GREATEST PLAYERS: A CELEBRATION OF THE 20TH CENTURY'S 
BEST.' By Ron Smith. Foreword by Willie Mays. (224 pages. The Sporting 
News Publishing Co. $29.95.) Ruth is No. 1, of course. And Nos. 2 
through 6, reasonably enough, are Mays, Cobb, Walter Johnson, Aaron 
and Gehrig. But Williams No. 8, Musial 10 and DiMaggio 11? Pete Rose 
as low as 25 and Mark McGwire as high as 91? Josh Gibson down at 18? 
Combustible fuel for this winter's hot-stove league. `ONE DIGITAL 
DAY: HOW THE MICROCHIP IS CHANGING OUR WORLD.' Created by Rick Smolan 
and Jennifer Erwitt. Designed by Tom Walker. (223 pages. Times Books/Random 
House in association with Against All Odds Productions. $40.) Two 
hundred photos illustrating how the microchip is taking over our lives, 
from Istanbul, where a magic decoder ring will pay your subway fare, 
to Tokyo, where a $3,500 toilet will warm its seat to your liking. 
Granted, it's a book-length ad for Intel Corp., which sponsored the 
project; still, it entertainingly shows how the world is turning into 
a computer game. `SAVEUR COOKS AUTHENTIC AMERICAN.' By the editors 
of Saveur Magazine. (320 pages. Chronicle Books. $40.) No matter what 
the recipes here may produce, the results appear irresistible in this 
pictorial celebration of American regional cooking. Even the macaroni 
and cheese, made with good old Wisconsin cheddar, looks like a gourmet 
special. `THE PRINCE OF EGYPT: A NEW VISION IN ANIMATION.' By Charles 
Solomon. (192 pages. Harry N. Abrams. $45.) A sumptuously illustrated 
how-they-did-it look behind the scenes of the forthcoming Dreamworks 
animated musical version of ``The Ten Commandments,'' complete with 
the Burning Bush, the Ten Plagues and the parting of the Red Sea. 
Barring too many lines like ``Hey, Ramses, how would you like your 
face carved on a wall?,'' the film, with its lifelike animation, should 
be worth seeing if it lives up to the power of this preview. Just 
in case you missed any, these two books sum up in words and pictures 
the peaks and disasters of the past hundred years. One, `THE AMERICAN 
CENTURY,' by Harold Evans, with Gail Buckland and Kevin Baker (712 
pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $50.), says it was not inevitable that the 
era should have been an American one, and examines just how it turned 
out to be. The other, `THE CENTURY,' by Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster; 
photographs edited by Katherine Bourbeau (606 pages. Doubleday. $60.), 
a companion to the ABC News and the History Channel television series 
of the same name, strives with considerable success to give a documentary 
sense of what the times were like. `CARTIER: THE TANK WATCH.' By Franco 
Cologni. With a Catalog of Watches From 1917 to the Present by Dominique 
Flechon. (263 pages. Flammarion. $75.) So ubiquitous has been the 
tank watch _ designed by Louis Cartier in 1917, named after the Renault 
tank whose modernistic design inspired it and presented to General 
Pershing in 1918 _ that Rudolph Valentino even wore one while playing 
in ``The Son of the Sheik.'' This elegant volume tracks the watch's 
life and times and accounts for why its design, even for those of 
us who can't afford one, has become as familiar as the back of our, 
uh, naked wrist. `JACKSON POLLOCK.' By Kirk Varnedoe with Pepe Karmel. 
(336 pages. Museum of Modern Art, New York. Distributed by Harry N. 
Abrams. $75.) The accompanying volume to the major Pollock exhibition 
at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, this includes more than 
200 color reproductions and traces the development of the pioneering 
abstract expressionist. Like great jazz music, Pollock's radically 
experimental drip paintings seem with the passage of time increasingly 
classic. `JACQUES HENRI LARTIGUE, PHOTOGRAPHER.' Introduction by Vicki 
Goldberg. (288 pages. Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown and Company. $95.) 
A charming monograph on Lartigue, the first book to survey the French 
photographer's work in depth since ``Diary of a Century,'' edited 
by Richard Avedon, was published in the 1970s. Lartigue, in his fascination 
with kites, airplanes, cars and motorcycles, captured a world defying 
gravity. As Ms. Goldberg, a contributor on photography and the arts 
to The New York Times, writes in her introduction, ``History provided 
him with a cornucopia of inventions, including a camera with a fast 
lens, and he responded with the passions of a child and the eye of 
an adult.'' Is New York still the tallest city in the world? You'll 
have little doubt after viewing these two spectacular photo collections, 
one looking up at the great city, the other down: `NEW YORK VERTICAL,' 
by Horst Hamann, (165 pages. Te Neues Publishing Company. $98. Also 
available in reduced format, $29.95), in which each of the 66 tall 
black-and-white pictures is accompanied by a telling comment like 
the one by Winka Dubbeldam, an architect, ``The only city where the 
sky is not the limit.'' And `NEW YORK FROM THE AIR,' photographs by 
Yann Arthus-Bertrand, text by John Tauranac (159 pages. Harry N. Abrams. 
$45.), where the city's familiar buildings appear so cleanly bathed 
in golden light that you feel almost sorry for all of us who must 
view them from the ground. And a happy holiday.
