NASA is keeping an eye on the skies above cape Canaveral. The space 
shuttle "endeavour" is to lift off early tomorrow morning. But threatening 
weather could delay the launch. Miles O'Brien reports, the six-person 
mission will carry parts for the new space station. Brimming with 
high-tech tools and shiny hardware, the space shuttle "endeavour" 
is poised to launch NASA on the long, uncharted journey toward building 
a multinational work space-in-space. The crew is ready and very excited 
about the upcoming mission. It's going to be challenging for them 
and for the ground teams. But this is just shades of what's to come. 
Led by commander Bob cabana, the six-person crew of "endeavour" will 
carry the first U.S. piece of the long-delayed $60 billion international 
space station. The so-called "unity node" will serve as a connector 
for future modules and a docking spot for shuttles. "Endeavour" will 
rendezvous with the first Russian contribution to the station -- a 
powerplant called zarya. Cabana and robotic-arm operator Nancy Curry 
will be put to the test, as they pluck zarya from orbit and attach 
it to unity. What are the hardest points of this? I think some of 
the difficulties are in the tight tolerances that we are talking about. 
Tight, indeed. Curry must delicately move the 25,000-pound Module 
within four inches and four degrees of alignment from unity. Then, 
spacewalkers Jerry Ross and Jim Newman are scheduled to strap on space 
tool belts and step out of the shuttle for three shifts of hard work 
in space. They will connect cables, handrails, tethers and antennas 
to the embryonic station. NASA is building the space station with 
Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada. The unprecedented partnership has 
not been easy. Russia's economic collapse has led to several delays, 
or slips of this mission, which was supposed to launch a year ago. 
I think we put the slips to good use. You come up with ways to focus 
people's attention. NASA is still basking in the glow of all the attention 
it received during John Glenn's return to space. Now, the space agency 
is hoping to trade misty-eyed nostalgia for wide-eyed enthusiasm about 
new era in space exploration. Miles O'Brien, CNN, Kennedy space center,
