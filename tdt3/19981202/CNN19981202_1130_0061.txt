The house committee says its subpoena power is more important than 
grand jury secrecy. In a hearing this afternoon, lawyers for the panel 
are expected to ask that attorney general Janet Reno turn over memos 
from former prosecutor Charles laBella. He was the head of the justice 
department's campaign finance investigation. A judge rejected a request 
for the memo last week because it contained secret grand jury material. 
The committee believes that the report may contain allegations of 
criminal wrongdoing by the president during the 1996 campaign. Both 
LaBella and Louis freeh recommended that Reno appoint a special prosecutor 
to look into the campaign. Reno did not take their advice.
