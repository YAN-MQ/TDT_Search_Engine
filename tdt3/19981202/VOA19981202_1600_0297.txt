The White House and Democrats in Congress are calling on Republican 
leaders in the House of Representatives to limit the impeachment inquiry 
of President Clinton. Tuesday, the Republican controlled House Judiciary 
Committee expanded its inquiry of the president to include alleged 
political fund-raising abuses. Here is Florida Republican Charles 
Canady. It is incumbent upon us to review this information which has 
been compiled by the Department of Justice to make certain that there's 
no evidence of impeachable conduct by the president. Meanwhile, the 
Democratic leader in the House, Richard Gephardt, says the probe should 
focus on allegations Mr. Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice 
in an effort to conceal his affair with an intern, Monica Lewinsky.
