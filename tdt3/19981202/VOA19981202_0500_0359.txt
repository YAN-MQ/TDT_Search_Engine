Here in Washington, White House aides are stepping up their rhetoric 
against the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee's impeachment 
hearings against President Clinton. They are denouncing the committee's 
decision to expand its probe of the Monica Lewinsky matter to include 
alleged fund-raising abuses by Mr. Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign. 
VOA's Debra Tate has a report from the White House. The committee 
vote to expand its investigation comes as it is preparing to vote 
next week on articles of impeachment against Mr. Clinton on charges 
of perjury, obstruction of justice, and abuse of power stemming from 
his efforts to conceal his affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky. 
They are charges the president has denied. At the White House, spokesman 
Joe Lockhart denounced the move as purely partisan and aimed solely 
at damaging the president. I fail to see anything beyond politics 
to why at the 11th hour with a week before the vote to go for all 
of a sudden for the Judiciary Committee to launch into a brand new 
venue and area for this investigation or these hearings unless there 
was some political motive. Mr. Lockhart says he does not believe any 
new information will be revealed about Mr. Clinton's campaign fund-raising 
practices, noting that several committees have already investigated 
the issue without finding evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. Earlier, 
Mr. Lockhart declined to say whether the White House would cooperate 
with the Judiciary Committee saying only it would consider the panels 
request for information. Debra Tate, VOA News at the White House.
