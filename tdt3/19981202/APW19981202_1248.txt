Five volunteer firefighters died overnight battling Victoria state's 
first major forest fire of the summer season, officials said Thursday, 
The five, all from the Geelong area, were killed as they fought to 
protect the small country town of Linton, near Ballarat. It is not 
yet known how they became caught in the fire. It was the single biggest 
loss of lives for the Country Fire Authority since Victoria's Ash 
Wednesday bushfires of Feb. 16, 1983, when 75 people were killed in 
Victoria and South Australia. Country Fire Authority spokesman Trevor 
Roche said the tragedy was hard felt. ``The death of these firefighters 
is really a tragic circumstance for the CFA,'' Roche told reporters 
Thursday morning. ``It has devastated our members and our friends 
but also anyone who is associated or has been associated with the 
CFA. ``I mean no one can imagine a worse start to any fire season 
than this.'' Police said names of the victims would not be immediately 
released as they were yet to be positively identified. More than 300 
firefighters, 42 fire trucks and five aircraft battled Wednesday's 
fire.
