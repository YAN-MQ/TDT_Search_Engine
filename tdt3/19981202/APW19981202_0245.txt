The romance of being stranded aboard the ``Love Boat'' finally ran 
out Wednesday and the cruise line began making plans to fly passengers 
home. The ship made famous by the popular 1977-86 American television 
show ``The Love Boat'' has been held in port near Athens since Nov. 
26, when police say they found 25 kilograms (56 pounds) of heroin 
aboard. Authorities said they needed the Pacific Princess in port 
while they completed the investigation. Two crew members have been 
charged with drug trafficking. It was not clear when the ship would 
be cleared to leave. The more than 600 passengers _ mostly Americans 
_ have been staying aboard the ship and taking daily tours around 
Athens and nearly islands. The ship's owner, London-based P&AMP;O 
Cruises, planned to book flights home for passengers beginning Wednesday, 
said company spokesman Peter Smith. The Pacific Princess arrived in 
Piraeus from Istanbul, Turkey, as part of a two-week cruise in the 
Mediterranean.
