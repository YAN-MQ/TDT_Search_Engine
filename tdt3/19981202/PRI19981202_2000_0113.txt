The Federal Election commission meets tomorrow to consider staff recommendations 
to order millions of dollars in refunds to the Federal Treasury. From 
the 1996 campaigns of President Clinton and Republican Bob Dole. NPR's 
Peter Overby reports. The commission's auditors say both campaigns 
got massive and illegal support from the National Party Organizations. 
TV ads promoting the candidates. The campaign were taking public funds 
had agreed to obey strict spending limits. According to the auditors, 
the Clinton campaign should give back $7 million. The Dole campaign, 
more than $17 million. Both campaigns say the auditors misinterpreted 
the law. Tomorrow, the six commissioners will debate the audit reports. 
They could also simply drop the issue. The House Judiciary Committee 
is investigating the Clinton campaign finances as part of its impeachment 
inquiry. And on Monday, Attorney General Janet Reno has to decide 
whether to seek an independent counsel. The FEC audit report has been 
a key element in that case. Peter Overby, NPR News, Washington.
