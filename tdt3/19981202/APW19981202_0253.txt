Ten people were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of buying votes for 
Saturday's elections, as authorities crack down on a traditional problem 
in the island's politics. Police in eastern Hualien county arrested 
and detained nine people, including local county council members and 
a Presbyterian minister, whom they suspected of buying the votes of 
members of mountain tribal communities. Residents were first offered 
jugs of cooking oil, and if they accepted, they then were approached 
with cash bids of 500 Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 15) for each vote, 
newspapers reported. And in suburban Taipei county, a man was arrested 
for distributing up to 500 wristwatches to handicapped voters in return 
for pledges to support a legislative candidate. In both cases, the 
names of the candidates were not identified. They were the first vote-buying 
arrests ahead of Saturday's elections for the 225-seat national legislature 
along with the mayorships of Taipei and Kaohsiung and their city councils. 
Vote buying by candidates has long been a major source of electoral 
fraud, which leads to corruption as elected office holders seek to 
earn back their investments through influence peddling or graft. So 
far in this campaign season, 476 reports of vote buying have been 
investigated, an overall drop from previous years, according to prosecutors 
who declined to provide comparative figures. Four cases of election-related 
violence have been looked into, along with 36 cases of threats and 
intimidation _ reflecting much more orderly campaigns than Taiwan 
has seen in the past. Vote buying is considered more serious in rural 
areas where community networks are stronger, but even in the capital 
Taipei, authorities have been scrambling to look into numerous reports 
of vote buying in the legislative and city council races, said Chou 
Chi-jung, spokesman for the Taipei District Prosecutors office. However, 
investigators have yet to uncover any solid evidence, Chou said. With 
over 400 candidates running, this year's elections provide a monumental 
challenge for investigators who have in the past have successfully 
forced vote buying underground.
