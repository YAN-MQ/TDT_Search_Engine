In the golden age of five-and-dimes, there was a special place mainly 
for girls. Tucked on a rack between the comic books and the coloring 
books were folders of paper dolls. The nice ones might be 29 cents 
or 59 cents, the cheap ones 15 cents. For some girls (and more than 
a few boys), playing with the mix-and-match outfits was almost an 
afterthought; there was a satisfaction simply in cutting out the clothes 
and the little white tabs that held them in place. Today, five-and-dimes 
aren't what they used to be, and neither are paper dolls. ``There's 
not the variety out there that there was years ago,'' said Jim Faraone, 
the editor and publisher of Paper Doll Pal, a newsletter for creators 
and collectors. ``If it's not a Disney movie or a Barbie doll, there's 
not much coming out.'' For some enthusiasts, the Internet is replacing 
those inexpensive paper folders. Many paper-doll artists are putting 
samples of their work on line, where they can be downloaded free and 
reproduced on black-and-white or color printers. Some more elaborate 
Web sites provide visitors to pick from a variety of online outfits 
and dress dolls the way they choose. A good place to start is the 
home page of the Original Paper Doll Artists Guild (www.opdag.com), 
an organization of doll fans that prints a quarterly newsletter for 
members and has links to many doll pages. One such site, Marilee's 
Paperdoll Page (www.ameritech.net/users/macler/paperdolls.html) includes 
links for a wide variety of paper dolls _ teen-age dolls, animals 
and toys, historical figures and celebrity dolls _ along with her 
own printable dolls. ``I get letters from people who have printed 
a copy of every paper doll linked to my site, just as a collection,'' 
Marilee wrote via e-mail. (Marilee, who lives in a Chicago suburb, 
declined to disclose her last name.) ``Some teachers have written 
saying they used the paper dolls in the classroom to teach computer 
skills. A Canadian art teacher was coordinating classrooms in different 
parts of the world. They looked at my site for ideas, made their own 
paper dolls using photos of their faces, then traded with some other 
school somewhere.'' Paper dolls have been around since 18th-century 
France. Some current doll artists, like C. David Claudon (www.tezcat.com/videoc/PaperDolls.html), 
design elaborate costumes in medieval, French court and stage styles. 
Rather than coloring his black-and-white originals, Claudon scanned 
them into the computer and colored them on line. ``Learning to paint 
with the computer added a whole new dimension,'' Claudon said in an 
e-mail interview, `` and I really like the freedom it offers.'' There 
are more familiar doll names on line, too, like the Berenstain Bears 
(www.berenstainbears. com/dressup.html). The Archie Comics site has 
a page for fans of Katy Keene (www.archiecomics. com/katy), the fashion 
queen whose comic book, bearing a host of paper dolls, appeared regularly 
from 1949 to 1961 and again from 1983 to 1990. Brenda Sneathen Mattox, 
a well-known paper doll artist from Indiana (photon.indy.net/paperdoll/bsmdoll.html), 
displays only a few of her doll designs on line and sells the complete 
sets. She said via e-mail that for paper-doll artists, the Internet 
``enables us to get our work in front of people who might not otherwise 
see it, especially kids who barely know what a paper doll is!'' In 
the paper doll world, Kiss means not the rock group, but kisaeke (Japanese 
for ``changing clothes''), a form of Japanese doll cartoons. They 
are highly imaginative dolls, but parents should take note: in Japan, 
dolls and paper doll mannequins often start off nude. Not Barbie nude, 
but nude nude. Kiss sites should be checked out by parents first. 
G-rated Kiss offerings are usually available through a Kids Domain 
site (www.kidsdomain.com/down/kiss), which is down for a week or two 
for maintenance.
