Former military dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, now being held 
in police custody - in British custody may not be so lucky. Chile's 
foreign minister, Jose Miguel Insulsa, says he is cautiously optimistic 
his country will win the release of the former military dictator. 
The foreign minister told reporters in Santiago today he has made 
numerous efforts to have General Pinochet repatriated and that much 
work still must be done. Mr. Insulsa also restated his view that the 
general's status as Chilean senator for life makes him immune from 
prosecution. Mr. Insulsa just concluded a five-day trip to Great Britain 
and Spain to lobby for General Pinochet's release. The former military 
strong man was arrested in October in London at the request of a judge 
in Spain. He faces crimes against humanity.
