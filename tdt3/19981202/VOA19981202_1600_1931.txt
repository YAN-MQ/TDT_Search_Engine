Yugoslavia has warned western diplomats and international monitors 
not to contact the guerrillas fighting for the independence of Serbia's 
Kosovo province. A government statement calls the guerrillas of the 
Kosovo Liberation Army terrorists and an obstruction to peace. U.S. 
and European mediators trying to end the violence in Kosovo have met 
with guerrilla representatives in efforts to persuade them to accept 
an interim peace solution.
