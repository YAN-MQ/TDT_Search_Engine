Q. What is xDSL technology and is it available in New York? A. The 
term xDSL refers to several types of digital subscriber lines that 
speed up a user's connection to the Internet. While conventional modem 
speeds are topping out around 56 kilobits per second, the new technology 
offers significantly faster speeds. One of the most popular members 
of the xDSL family is ADSL (for asymmetric digital subscriber line), 
which promises speeds of up to 8 megabits (8 million bits) per second 
for data coming to the user; most users will probably see speeds of 
1 to 4 megabits per second. Uploads can attain speeds up to 1 megabit 
per second. ADSL is aimed at users who need to download a lot of information 
in a hurry, like Web pages or digital video, but don't have to upload, 
or send, a lot of material. ADSL is not universally available yet. 
Unlike cable modems, which offer fast connection speeds over a shared 
line, ADSL uses special digital coding to get more speed out of a 
single phone line. It also allows you to use a single telephone line 
for both an Internet connection and for regular phone or fax needs 
simultaneously. An excellent Web site devoted to ADSL, www.adsl.com, 
contains a table that shows what parts of the country have access 
to ADSL service (yes, it is available in parts of New York). (italics)Circuits
