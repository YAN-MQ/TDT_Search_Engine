Separatist guerrillas increasingly agree with Kosovo politicians but 
Serb officials are stalling talks on the status of the war-torn province, 
a top ethnic Albanian negotiator said Wednesday. The negotiator, Fehmi 
Agani, welcomed a statement by the Kosovo Liberation Army that it 
could agree to something short of full, immediate independence for 
Kosovo, which had been its goal. Guerrilla spokesman Adem Demaci made 
the statement Monday in the first clear indication the secessionist 
rebels would accept a temporary status for Kosovo as a Yugoslav republic. 
Yugoslavia consists of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro. Kosovo, 
with a majority ethnic Albanian population, is a province of Serbia. 
``This is a serious approach to the problem,'' Agani told reporters 
in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. ``It was easy to insist on independence 
as a final goal but this prevented the process from moving forward. 
A decisive time has come when we should present a united stand.'' 
But Agani accused Serb negotiators of blocking talks on Kosovo's status 
and inciting confrontations between the guerrillas and Serb security 
forces. Last month, Belgrade authorities rejected a U.S.-sponsored 
plan for Kosovo as giving too much independence to the majority Albanians. 
Serbian officials called the plan a ``step to full secession.'' Serbia 
then issued its own plan which would give Kosovo some autonomy but 
maintain firm Serb control. Agani Wednesday called the Serbian draft 
proposal ``catastrophic and destructive ... since it affirms Serbian 
rule over Kosovo.'' The government of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic Tuesday accused rebels of endangering the shaky peace and 
blasted international efforts to include the guerrillas in the peace 
process. In a protest letter, the Yugoslav government also accused 
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe of ``legalizing 
the terrorists.'' Agani said the Yugoslav note to the OSCE was a sign 
of ``nervousness'' and called on the international community to exert 
more pressure on Milosevic. ``I don't believe the international community 
would allow its peace efforts to fail easily,'' Agani said. Since 
a U.S.-brokered, Oct. 12 agreement brought a halt to full-scale fighting 
in Kosovo, international diplomatic efforts have focused on finding 
a political solution for the separatist. province. Sporadic violence 
has continued since the agreement and international officials are 
worried the fragile peace will collapse in new fighting if a political 
settlement isn't reached soon. Hundreds of people were killed and 
as many as 300,000 fled from their homes during a nearly eight-month 
crackdown by Serb forces against ethnic Albanian separatists.
