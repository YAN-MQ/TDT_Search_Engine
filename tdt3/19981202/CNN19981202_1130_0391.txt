Heirs of Richard Nixon and are getting their day in court in a lawsuit 
over his presidential documents tapes and photographs. The trial opens 
today in Washington to determine how much the Nixon estate should 
be compensated for materials seized by the government after the watergate 
scandal. Nixon sued in 1980 to recover cost. He lost in district court, 
but an appeals court ordered a trial to determine the value. Some 
estimates put the value as much as $250 million.
