The president of Nice soccer club has decided not to sell the second 
division team to Italian soccer giant AS Roma, the French sports daily 
L'Equipe reported Wednesday. ``The club is no longer for sale. We 
have already lost precious time and do not want to waste more,'' Nice 
president Milan Mandaric was quoted by the newspaper as saying. After 
talks with Roma officials, Mandaric, an American businessman, decided 
that a sale to Roma would not be in the club's interest. Mandaric 
told the paper that the club has attracted a new investor. On Tuesday, 
Roma officials had said that a takeover was imminent. The move was 
intended to encourage youth development at Nice and give second string 
Roma players experience in the French league.
