Australia's Antarctic supply ship Aurora Australis is stuck in pack 
ice off Antarctica with a damaged propeller, Australia's Antarctic 
Division said Wednesday. The director of the division, Tony Press, 
said the ship became trapped in ice some days ago but the crew was 
in no danger and there are plenty of supplies on board. The Aurora 
Australis is carrying 69 expeditioners and 24 crew members. Press 
said it was unclear how long the ship will be stuck or whether the 
crew had the necessary equipment to fix the ship's damaged propeller. 
``It's temporarily caught in pack ice and that can change depending 
on the weather,'' he said. ``It's been caught in the ice for several 
days but the problems with the propeller were only discovered the 
evening before last.'' The Aurora Australis was in the process of 
changing crews at bases in Antarctica, as well as carrying out scientific 
experiments, including field surveys, he said. ``The ship had been 
making trips to the Antarctica for about 10 years,'' he said. ``It's 
not unusual for ships to be temporarily caught in ice.'' The Australian 
government has been considering a two-ship policy for its Antarctic 
bases, or possibly building Antarctic air strips for supply by aircraft.
