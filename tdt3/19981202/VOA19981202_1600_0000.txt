West Bank until the Palestinian authority meets a list of conditions. 
Nigeria's military dictator says he'll step down and wants his fellow 
military leaders to do the same within six months. Lebanon's president 
chooses veteran politician, Salim Hoff to be the country's next prime 
minister. Tomorrow is the first anniversary of the signing of the 
treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines, but proponents say there 
is still much work to do. I'm Tony Riggs. And I'm Erin Brummett. Stay
