Have you ever had your blood pressure taken by one of those drugstore 
machines? Like many medical devices, that technology comes from the 
space program. When Alan shephard became the first American to fly 
in space 37 years ago, project Mercury scientists wanted to know what 
blast-off does to blood pressure. So, they invented an automatic measuring 
device. If you wear scratch-resistant glasses, you, too, can thank 
the stars. NASA needed something to protect satellites from getting 
nicked by space debris. And an implantable insulin pump that helps 
keep diabetes under control, borrows from the mechanical robot arm 
on the first Mars probe. It's wonderful, because without this technology 
that we got today, I wouldn't have the control I have, and maybe I 
might not be here. NASA says its primary mission is to fly in space. 
The medical spin-offs are just a bonus, but one that directly benefits 
life on earth. For the latest health news online, check out CNN.com/health.
