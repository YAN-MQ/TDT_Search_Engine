The world's largest aircraftmaker slashing thousands of jobs. I'm 
Terry Keenan with a business news update from New York. Faced with 
reduced or canceled orders from Asian nations wracked by economic 
turmoil, Boeing says it's cutting production of its 747s, 757s and 
767s. It's slashing its workforce by 20,000 jobs. That on top of 28,000 
previously announced cuts. Altogether, that works out to 20% of Boeing's 
staff. The world's largest aircraftmaker also slashing profit estimates 
for next year by 25% to $1.5 billion.
