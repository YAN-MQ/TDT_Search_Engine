For today's geography quiz. We're looking for a place where the people 
speak French. Carry around French franks. But pooh-pooh Perrier. Preferring 
the tropical taste of Caribbean rum. Before Christopher Columbus ventured 
here in 1493, the island was known by the locals as Karu-Cara, or 
the Island of Beautiful Waters. It's actually two islands. They are 
separated by the Straight of Rivier Salais and reformed by a now-dormant 
volcano. And every four years around this time, an intrepid group 
of lone sailors sets off from the shores of France. In a four thousand 
mile long race across the Atlantic to this island's main harbor. Which 
is known as Pointa Pete. Capeche? A little more on that race, and 
the answer a little later.
