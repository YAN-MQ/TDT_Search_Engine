Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft maker is hurting from 
a down turn in the Asia market and will have to cut 48,000 of its 
238,000 work force over two years. Bloomberg's Josh Fineman says Boeing 
is at lean times at least for now. It's a cyclical industry, you know, 
expected to go down, say, 2000 through I guess maybe about 2003, 2003, 
but after that, I expect them to peak up again. So, you know, this 
is a possibility that they'll be hiring more people as the production 
increases up again. Asia's recession poses risk for Boeing, America's 
largest exporter, because the region accounts for a third of its $90 
billion backlog of commercial jet orders.
