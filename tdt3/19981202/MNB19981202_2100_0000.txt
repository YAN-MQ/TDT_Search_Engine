Lost jobs, layoffs, trimming payrolls just weeks before Christmas. 
A major concern over a component in children's toys and what might 
be a big health danger. The story in tomorrow's "New York Times." 
Tonight from "dateline NBC," a young girl missing for a year now, 
why her two parents are still suspects in the case. Why some see some 
similarities. And from "NBC nightly news" tonight, the ad campaign 
everybody knows. And it turns out, everybody is paying for it as well. 
And good Wednesday evening for you. We will update you on the latest 
out of the Washington and potential future trouble for the independent 
counsel. Also what the "New York Times" is reporting in its Thursday 
morning edition. And our look at the front pages of the morning pages 
across the country here this Wednesday night.
