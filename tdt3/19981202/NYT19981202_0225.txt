The spirit of universal design _ making something that enhances everyone's 
life _ has filtered into my garden plans for next spring. As I planted 
tulips up and down the hill in front of our barn in Maryland over 
Thanksgiving, I scoured the old buildings for good junk that might 
lend itself to a container garden on the south side of the house, 
just outside the kitchen door. Years ago, when a patio was still something 
you saw in Spain, my grandfather poured a slab of concrete in the 
L-shaped space, which was not only protected from the north wind but 
also operated as a passive solar heat collector. Ever since, the cement, 
as we call it, has been a natural gathering place for people, dogs, 
cats and black snakes. It's often warm enough to sit out there in 
the winter, provided the wind is down, and by spring, it feels like 
the Mediterranean. Over the years, we have lined the edge with pots 
of oleanders or African lilies. Morning glories have scrambled over 
the kitchen porch roof, from their humble whisky barrels on either 
side of the door. And next spring, I'm going to add a few old washtubs 
on rollers _ like the ones I've admired at the roof garden at Terence 
Cardinal Cook Health Center in East Harlem _ for a little movable 
salad bar next to the kitchen. Out in the garden, Bernie Eckenrode, 
who keeps everything from the old Gravely tractor to the furnace going, 
has agreed that this winter he will build a raised bed, about thigh-high, 
so that my mother can get her fingers in the dirt without crawling 
around on her hands and knees. (``Don't put me in any more stories,'' 
Kathleen says.) It will be wide enough to sit on while twiddling with 
the plants and will be made of rot-resistant cedar rather than treated 
lumber, because we don't want chemicals leaching into our food supply. 
After the summer harvest, this same bed will be a convenient site 
for the cold frame, which produces cold-hardy greens in the winter. 
I'm envisioning more trellises, too, for tomatoes, pole beans, peas 
and squash. Vertical crops get more sun and air circulation, they 
are less vulnerable to insects and rot, and you don't have to bend 
down to pick them. You can make trellises out of bamboo or sapling 
weed trees or buy them ready-made, and they work equally well in the 
ground or with planters. I saw some great ones at the roof garden 
at Terence Cardinal Cook, including vine-covered arbors, which can 
provide food as well as shade. ``Make sure you provide raised beds 
with a variety of heights,'' said David Kamp, the landscape architect 
who designed that garden. ``Somebody in a walker might find it more 
comfortable to stand and plant, while someone else might want to sit. 
Even individual needs change from day to day.'' I fell in love with 
the spirit of universal design a few weeks ago, at the ``Unlimited 
by Design'' exhibition at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. 
As soon as you make something more accessible, everyone wants it. 
``People think, `Oh, universal design, that's for people with disabilities,' 
'' said Bruce Hannah, who, with Tanya Van Cott, designed the exhibition. 
``But I always say, Alexander Graham Bell's father ran a school for 
the deaf. He invented a hearing aid that works so well I can hear 
someone talking from California with it.'' He handed me a pair of 
featherweight rubber hedge shears, designed by Frank Cogliano, with 
comfortably large handles. They were so much lighter than I'd expected, 
they almost floated out of my hand, and I longed for some boxwood 
to test the blades on. Who wouldn't prefer these to the wooden-handled 
variety, which can strain even the most vigorous wrists? Too bad, 
they're not yet in production. I also was curious to see how much 
force a pair of gear-operated loppers would bring to bear on my overgrown 
mock oranges. ``It's all about increasing reach and leverage,'' Hannah 
said, as I picked up a trowel bent at a right angle to the handle, 
with cuffs that fit around your forearm. The design takes the pressure 
off the wrist and harnesses the use of the whole arm for digging. 
Haws now makes a plastic watering can with an arching handle, far 
lighter than its brass ancestors. Smith &AMP; Hawken offers a lightweight, 
two-wheeled cart for collecting garden clippings and toting tools, 
but I wondered about the single handle. Wouldn't a two-handled cart 
be more stable? ``My father would never use a walker,'' Gianfranco 
Zaccai, a designer for the exhibition, had told me. ``But he loved 
to go to the grocery store and push the cart for my mother. There 
was lots to look at, it was socially acceptable, and he was doing 
something to help my mother.'' Just as I started thinking that's what 
the world needed _ a grocery cart for the garden _ I got an e-mail 
from ``nick(AT)noblemotion.com.'' ``A wheelchair is the last thing 
you need,'' said the electronic Nick Thompson, replying to a comment 
I made last week about my mother's aversion to wheelchairs (sorry, 
Mom). ``Ask your mother'' _ (sorry, Mom) _ ``and her friends where 
they walk best. At the risk of sounding cocky, I am betting their 
answer will be, `Behind a grocery cart.' '' Thompson sells something 
called a rollator, designed in Sweden, which looks like a walker on 
four wheels, with a little basket to hold your stuff and a seat for 
taking a breather. (Information: 800-234-9255 or www.noblemotion.com.) 
It costs about $400, depending on the model. But look, you don't have 
to spend a lot of money to bring universal design to the tomato patch. 
``Don't make disabled people special,'' said Nancy Chambers, the director 
of horticulture therapy at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine 
in Manhattan. ``All people are different, and it's just a matter of 
finding the right tools.'' She held up her hand and ordered me to 
place my palm against hers. My fingers were about an inch longer. 
``See?'' she said. ``Would we use the same tools?'' I tried out a 
lightweight pair of snippers she finds ideal for light pruning. They 
were simply too small for my hand. ``And you have a little arthritis 
in your right hand,'' she said. ``You should be using Felco No. 7, 
which turns and swivels.'' There are extenders that can be snapped 
onto favorite rakes and hoes to extend reach and prevent lower back 
strain. There are dozens of tools with soft grips that are easy on 
the hand. There are garden stools and little seats on wheels that 
can roll you down the garden bed, as you weed or plant. ``It's all 
available,'' Ms. Chambers said. ``But you have to go to the store 
and try out the tools. Or order from the catalogs. If they don't work 
for you, send them back.'' So, I leafed through my favorite catalogs. 
Smith &AMP; Hawken has a whole line of tools for what it calls the 
ageless garden. Fiskars (800-500-4849 for a list of retailers), known 
for its scissors, has a wealth of extenders, soft grips, right-angled 
tools and gear-operated pruners and loppers. Stillbrook Horticultural 
Supplies (800-414-4468) offers a Felco No. 13 pruner, developed by 
occupational therapists, with an extra-long handle for two-handed 
use, as well as many other universal tools. Gardener's Supply (800-863-1700) 
offers everything from bamboo trellises and raised beds to sturdy 
kneelers, which creaky gardeners can use to lower themselves to the 
ground (or turn upside down for a seat). Another great source of information 
is ``The Enabling Garden,'' by Gene Rothert (Taylor Publishing, 1994), 
a horticultural therapist who uses a wheelchair. Rothert designed 
the barrier-free garden at the Chicago Botanic Garden, and much of 
his practical wisdom is in this book. Whatever works. Rollators, washtubs 
on wheels. My cousin Janice crawled up to her garden one spring, after 
her hip operation, just to plant the peas.
