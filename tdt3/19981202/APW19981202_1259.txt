Cuban President Fidel Castro said Wednesday he would be pleased to 
welcome Pope John Paul II to Cuba again when the pontiff travels to 
Mexico next month, though no such visit has been planned. ``A visit 
by the pope would always be welcome,'' Castro told reporters. Castro 
said he heard rumors that the pope might consider visiting Cuba during 
his upcoming travels, but said there was no official plan for such 
a stop. The pope is scheduled to travel to Mexico on Jan. 22 and then 
to St. Louis on Jan. 26 before returning to Rome. John Paul visited 
Cuba in January of this year.
