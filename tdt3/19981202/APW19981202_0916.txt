In a case that sparked protests overseas, a judge made a final ruling 
Wednesday that 30 young elephants were cruelly treated and awarded 
temporary custody to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Animals. ``This has become of public interest and is not private 
interest anymore,'' Judge Herman Glas said in upholding his earlier 
ruling, made in October. In an unusual move, the elephants' owner, 
animal exporter Riccardo Ghiazza, had asked the judge to reconsider 
his earlier decision. Ghiazza was allowed to keep the elephants in 
the interim. The NSPCA hopes to transport the animals to three game 
reserves in South Africa on Friday or Saturday, said NSPCA executive 
director Marcelle French. The elephants were snatched from their families 
from a game reserve in neighboring Botswana. Ghiazza had planned to 
sell them to zoos in Europe and to a safari park in China. The judge 
cited particular concern about seven baby elephants who had abscesses 
on their heads from being prodded by sharp instruments as part of 
training to prepare them for captivity. The trainers hobbled them 
and deprived them of water, NSPCA officials testified during the hearings. 
Glas pointed out that international elephant experts testified that 
such training was outmoded and dangerous. ``I am persuaded that with 
more care (injuries) could have been prevented,'' Glas said. ``These 
elephants have been neglected.'' The international animal rights organization, 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, had threatened to organize 
a tourist boycott if Ghiazza was allowed to keep the elephants. ``I 
feel the baby elephants will never feel the comfort and love of their 
mothers again, but at least they have the chance to live their lives 
without bull hooks, chains and beatings,'' said Jane Garrison of PETA, 
who monitored the case. In a statement from PETA's headquarters in 
Norfolk, Va., PETA Vice President Mary Beth Sweetland said: ``This 
must be the beginning of the end of the African elephant slave trade.'' 
In October, animal-rights activists dumped coal in front of the South 
African Embassy in Washington to protest the elephants' treatment. 
A protest was also held at the country's embassy in London. Britain's 
Spice Girls pop group and rocker Chrissie Hynde have appealed to South 
African President Nelson Mandela to prevail on his Botswana counterpart, 
Festus Mogae, to help the elephants return to their families. Final 
custody will be decided later, pending criminal charges of cruelty 
being considered by the attorney general against Ghiazza. Ghiazza's 
lawyer had maintained that the treatment of the elephants was valid 
under South African law. ``It's not the aim to raise the animals to 
the level of human rights,'' attorney Nic van der Walt told the judge 
last month.
