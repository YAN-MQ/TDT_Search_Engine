A Japanese newspaper says the United States has warned Tokyo that 
North Korea may be preparing to launch another ballistic missile by 
the end of the year. Niyomiyori Shimbun reports U.S. spy satellites 
have detected North Koreans moving missile components from storage 
to a launch pad. Japanese officials confirm they received the U.S. 
intelligence reports. Similar North Korean movements were seen before 
Pyun Young fired a missile without warning over Japanese territory 
in August.
