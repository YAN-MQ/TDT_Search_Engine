Being a prisoner of war is not exactly the kind of thing you'd like 
to do, but if you're going to have to undergo that ordeal, why not 
head to Seattle, Washington where there are far worse places where 
you can do it? Hans Schmitt rather liked it. Last month, the mayor 
of Seattle, Paula Schell, received a letter from Mr. Schmitt who lives 
at Kercham, Germany. Mr. Schmitt wrote that he was grateful for the 
way that he was treated in Seattle when he was a POW at the end of 
World War II. He said in his letter, "The people of Seattle were very 
nice." He said they were very friendly even if the U.S. and Germany 
were enemies during those dark days. He also said that German POWs 
were well fed in America, even while many people in Germany were starving 
during the last years of the war. Enclosed in Hans Schmitt's letter 
were two 50 dollar bills. The letter said, "I would like to say thank 
you for my good times in Seattle. Please give the amount to a FM in 
Seattle with children."
