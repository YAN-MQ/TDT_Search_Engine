While we're on the subject of business and economic news, how's this 
for a rags to riches story. American rhythm and blues star R. Kelly 
started his life in Chicago, Illinois growing up at a low-income housing 
project surrounded by negative peer pressure, but a spiritual upbringing 
and interest in music kept him out of trouble. And about eight years 
ago at the age of 22, R. Kelly signed with Jive Records and has since 
sold more than ten million albums worldwide. As VOA's Mary Morningstar 
reports, today he's one of the most sought after musicians in rhythm 
and blues. R. Kelly's new album simply titled "R," is a double CD 
collection of 29 songs written, arranged, and produced by the 30-year-old 
rhythm and blues superstar. The CD, which marks his first in three 
years, recently entered "Billboard's" R&B chart at number one and 
the top 200 listing at number two. R. Kelly arrived on the music scene 
in 1991 and soon became one of the most respected artists in the rhythm 
and blues field. In addition to his own successful recording career, 
he has written and produced songs for Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, 
Kirk Franklin, Janet Jackson, and many others. R. Kelly's industry 
honors include "Billboard" magazine's R&B Producer and R&B Artist 
of the Year Awards in 1994. That same year, his smash hits, "Bumping 
Grind," broke a 37-year chart record to become the longest running 
number one hit on the rhythm and blues charts. But his biggest breakthrough 
came in 1996, when he crossed over onto the pop charts with the Grammy 
winning single, "I Believe I Can Fly." "I Believe I Can Fly" was featured 
on the soundtrack to the 1996 film, "Space Jam," which starred basketball 
great Michael Jordon. Ironically, R. Kelly dreamed of a professional 
career in basketball but was persuaded by his mother to follow his 
talents in music. R. Kelly included "I Believe I Can Fly" on his new 
album, "R." The collection also contains first-time collaborations 
with rappers J.Z., Foxy Brown, and Keith Murray, and pop star Celion 
Dion. R. Kelly is one of today's most versatile recording artists 
whose albums cover everything from pop ballads and gospel influenced 
songs to rap and hip hop. On his latest release, he even experiments 
with opera and yodeling. R. Kelly's duet with Celion Dion, "I'm Your 
Angel," will no doubt bring him many new fans from the pop mainstream. 
This week, the ballad enters "Billboard's" hot 100 chart at number 
one. I'm Mary Morningstar.
