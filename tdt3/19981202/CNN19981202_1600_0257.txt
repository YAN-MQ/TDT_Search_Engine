A federal judge is reversing course, and will allow staff from the 
house judiciary committee to see four secret justice department memos. 
Those documents deal with allegations of fund-raising irregularities 
in President Clinton's 1996 campaign. U.S. district judge Norma Holloway 
Johnson ruled today that one republican and one democrat on the committee's 
staff may see the memos. They will report to chairman Henry Hyde and 
the committee's ranking democrat, John Conyers. They won't be allowed 
to copy the documents or take on their contents, because the memos 
contain secret grand jury testimony. Democrats opposed even this limited 
disclosure. I think, as we get to the specifics, the entire impeachment 
process will probably just fall apart on its own weight, because we've 
been unable to articulate which allegations, if any, are even worth 
pursuing. We've had the broad brush kind of allegations and the ominous 
titles of offenses. But when you get down to the specifics, I think 
we can agree with many of the constitutional scholars that have commented 
that none of the allegations constitute impeachable offenses. I think 
this is a step in the right direction. I, personally, don't believe 
that the restrictions on access are necessary or appropriate, but 
the court has ruled on that. And at this stage, we'll proceed on that 
basis and see what information the staff obtains. Attorney general 
Janet Reno says today's ruling strikes a "just balance" by allowing 
restricted access to sensitive, justice department documents. In two 
of the memos, she's urged to appoint an independent counsel to investigate 
the president's campaign fund-raising.
