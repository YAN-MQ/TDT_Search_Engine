Former Chilean dictator general augusto Pinochet is under police guard 
at a Mansion outside London. He's waiting for word on whether he will 
be extradited to Spain to be tried on genocide charges. Tom Mintier 
reports on how that decision is affecting the British government. 
This is the posh new rented home of general augusto Pinochet. It is 
located just outside London and costs more than $16,000 a month. This 
is the man who will decide if Mr. Pinochet will soon move to the more 
cramped and less opulent surroundings of a Spanish jail. British home 
secretary Jack straw will decide if Spain will be allowed to extradite 
Pinochet on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism. In an interview 
with CNN, he provided few clues as to how he will decide. All I can 
say on the Pinochet case is that I will be making the decision in 
accordance strictly with the obligations imposed on me under the 1989 
extradition act and other legal requirements. The fact that the hospital 
says he is all right has no bearing? As I said, I shall be making 
the decision as I always do in extradition cases on the basis of the 
law's requirements. The decision may be based on law, but politics, 
or at least political pressure, is mounting. Let's have an end to 
the whole affair. The tory opposition in parliament has been critical 
of Tony Blair's labor government since the day general Pinochet's 
immunity was stripped by a Decision of the British house of lords. 
Political analysts say that the Blair government has few options but 
to allow the process to move forward. If he were to cut off the extradition 
process at this early stage, he would find himself opposed by almost 
the entire labor party. He would find himself compared with the extremely 
human-rights-oriented judgment in the house of lords last week. That 
would be an extremely uncomfortable position for Tony Blair. The house 
of lords may not be a political group. But by, in effect, reversing 
its decision by freeing general Pinochet, for whatever the reason, 
would have political consequences and come at a huge cost for Blair's 
government. Tom Mintier, CNN, London.
