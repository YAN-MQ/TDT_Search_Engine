As the season continues to slip away, National Basketball Association 
players and owners will meet Thursday in Manhattan for the first time 
in 13 days to try to end the five-month-old lockout. ``I think we're 
beyond the part of being frustrated,'' said Michael Curry, a member 
of the union's negotiating committee. ``By no means do we want the 
season canceled. But at the same time, if it comes to accepting a 
bad deal or letting the owners lose the season, unfortunately, we 
have to let the owners cancel the season.'' The last meeting on Nov. 
20 was termed the most productive bargaining session by both sides 
after it broke up after 10 hours. Within 48 hours, all progress was 
shelved. The union was upset about an owners' proposal that would 
severely limit a team's ability to sign its own free agents. The owners 
then accused the union of reneging on its acceptance of a complex 
tax formula that was to be used as part of an escrow system in the 
final years of a proposed seven-year plan. Nearly two weeks of rhetoric 
later, they're back at the bargaining table. Having set an unofficial 
mid-December deadline for striking a deal and having tested the union's 
resolve for the past month _ a period in which more than 200 players 
did not receive two paychecks _ the owners may have a renewed urgency 
in negotiations. But the union is feeling the pressure, too. In particular, 
the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, has had his job performance 
questioned by Isiah Thomas, a former union leader, over the past week. 
The former Bulls coach, Phil Jackson, said Wednesday he had reservations 
about the players' leadership. ``I'm very concerned about the representation 
on the players side,'' Jackson said from his home in Chicago. ``It 
looks like it's being directed by a couple of agents. I know there's 
some bitterness there, too. I've talked to some players _ players 
who are not your $10 million and $20 million players _ that do not 
feel like they have enough power to speak out because they don't have 
the clout.'' Jackson added: ``I think there's a certain limited amount 
of perspective some of these players have. They see their own era 
perhaps, they see their own careers, they see their own ability to 
compete. But they don't see a game that their children may play. I 
don't miss basketball, but for the good of the game it's very disappointing.'' 
Jackson said a mediator should be brought in to help the two sides 
settle their dispute, a suggestion the league has shot down on at 
least two occasions. The most difficult hurdle may be whether the 
escrow tax system can be saved. The plan was designed to make sure 
owners recouped revenues in the fourth year of the deal in the event 
that an agreed-upon percentage of money paid out in player salaries 
was exceeded. The union had previously proposed setting aside 10 percent 
of their paychecks in the escrow years, but the owners want to make 
sure the difference is completely covered. ``We may have to go a totally 
different direction with the format,'' Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik 
said on Tuesday. ``Hopefully, we won't.'' ``I think we would probably 
be inclined to stay with the same framework,'' Hunter said. ``I don't 
really think that we can move away under the circumstances _ unless 
they come up with something really magnificent.'' Though neither the 
league nor the union is predicting progress, Hunter was hopeful negotiations 
might spill over into Friday. He told the players on the negotiating 
committee that they should plan to be in New York for two days. ``I 
could see it going into Friday if there's progress, but only if we're 
moving,'' he said. ``We're not going to go through the motions and 
sit across the table and look at each other.''
