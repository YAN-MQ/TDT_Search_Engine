He arrived fashionably late, the celebrity way, and his entrance created 
a most suitable stir. Joe Torre, in the house. Lights. Camera. Reaction. 
``I was at the Rockland Business Association last night,'' Torre said 
Wednesday at the Waldorf-Astoria, in his casual, conversational way. 
``Must have been 350 people. I got up to speak and said, `Is there 
anybody I didn't take a picture with?' A few raised their hands, and 
I said, `Well, come back to the house after this and we'll take care 
of you.''' Who wouldn't want to go back to the house with Joe Torre, 
and, more to the point, who couldn't imagine sitting in his living 
room, accepting an offer for a glass of iced tea? Tuesday night, it 
was the Rockland martini crowd. Wednesday, the March of Dimes Sportsman 
of the Year luncheon. Pick a date from the time the Yankees finished 
off the San Diego Padres for their second World Series championship 
in the three years since Torre became a homespun New York story. Chances 
are, the Yankees' manager was somewhere, making a speech, taping a 
show, lighting a tree. Maury Gostfrand, the booking agent from RLR 
Associates, faxed over the November itinerary from Joe Torre's Wonderful 
Life. Nov. 6: cameo role in the sitcom ``Spin City.'' Nov. 11: the 
Children of Chernobyl gala dinner. Nov. 12: photo shoot for the cover 
of New York magazine. Nov. 18: Starlight Foundation sports auction. 
Nov. 19: speech at Western Connecticut University. Nov. 23: speech 
at Adelphi University. Nov. 26: Thanksgiving Day parade. Nov. 30: 
Christmas tree lighting for the New York Stock Exchange. ``We know 
we won the World Series, and we got a taste of it two years ago, but 
you can't imagine how many people it impacts,'' Torre said. ``It's 
overwhelming at times. With me, probably what they latch on to more 
than anything is that I'm from New York, like family, a lot closer 
than just an acquaintance.'' It is more than his being from Brooklyn 
that explains the transformation of a man a city tabloid once called 
Clueless Joe into the aforementioned magazine cover. This is about 
a rare knockout victory these days for substance over style. We loved 
the idea of having Pat Riley play Michael Douglas on the sideline 
at Madison Square Garden, but ultimately viewed him as a man we couldn't 
make eye contact with. We are awed by the coaching majesty of Bill 
Parcells but intuitively know we wouldn't want to run into him on 
the Monday after he'd lost. Torre, in addition to being the soothing, 
supervisory presence of the most decorated Yankee team ever, has become, 
in many respects, the paternal face of New York sports. When self-promotion 
is continually forced down our throats, when it is difficult to separate 
the man from the spin, Torre has come to represent a self-assured, 
comfortable fit. We are not fascinated with his hair, not bullied 
by his bluster. We just like the idea of a man who has a Brooklyn 
little league named for him, not only as a manager of the rich professionals, 
but also as a model for those who would coach our kids. He stepped 
out of the cab Wednesday on Park Avenue, into the breezy warmth of 
what still feels like October, and saw the smiles on the faces of 
the delighted New Yorkers. ``You keep hearing: `Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe,''' 
he said. He laughed and added, ``Enjoy it while it's here,'' so whimsically 
you knew that when the attention is gone, he'll manage just fine. 
He sounded, in this moment, like a throwback, like one of the city's 
championship coaches lost in the very month Torre was making the ceremonial 
rounds. He recalled meeting Red Holzman and Weeb Ewbank only in passing, 
but ``choking up'' when he heard what the players, from Joe Namath 
to Willis Reed, had to say. ``The thing I always admired about those 
guys is how the players perceived them,'' Torre said. ``You can't 
make people do that. That respect only comes from it being a two-way 
street.'' In the 25 years since Holzman's Knicks won their second 
title, the communications explosion allows even a regular Joe like 
Torre to become a star, to have a television movie made about him 
and his brother, to have published a book with another on the way. 
Nobody begrudges Torre what he seems to enjoy as an out-of-body experience. 
``I never expected the adulation,'' he said. Torre never expected 
to be shaking hands into December. He left the Waldorf on Wednesday 
and went to the airport for a long-awaited family vacation. ``This 
is it,'' he said. ``The end.'' He meant of 1998. This unlikely epic 
continues next year.
