The president named U.S.-educated economist Salim Hoss as the next 
prime minister of Lebanon on Wednesday. Hoss accepted the appointment, 
telling reporters after meeting President Emile Lahoud: ``We are facing 
big challenges which we should confront.'' He said his government 
would work to reduce the budget deficit and continue efforts to end 
Israel's occupation of part of southern Lebanon. His first task would 
be to appoint a Cabinet, he added. Lahoud issued a decree appointing 
Hoss after a majority of lawmakers in Parliament expressed support 
for him.
