I'm Bill Hazerd, VOA News. The largest oil company in the United States, 
Exxon, agreed Tuesday to buy the second largest, Mobil, for a record 
$76.2 billion dollars. The deal is the biggest corporate merger in 
U.S. history. VOA correspondent Elaine Johannsen reports from New 
York. The stock transaction merging Exxon and Mobil creates the world's 
largest oil company. Indeed, it will rival General Motors as the world's 
largest corporation. The new entity, which will be called Exxon-Mobil, 
will have 20.7 billion barrels of oil and gas reserves, 1.6 million 
barrels of oil and gas production per day, and 6.6 million barrels 
of refining capacity. Analysts say the new corporation will have greater 
access to north sea oil fields and a stronger presence in the U.S. 
marketing and refining arena. Depressed oil prices and growing competition 
in the world market drove the two American oil giants to the negotiating 
table. Elaine Johannsen, VOA News, New York.
