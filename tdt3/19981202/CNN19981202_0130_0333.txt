just in time for the holiday shopping rush, two washington senators 
have released their fourth annual video game report. gina london has 
the results. that's from a so-called good video game. who wants bacon 
and eggs? that decidedly is not. the national institute on media in 
the family says about 75% of the games on store shelves is appropriate 
for all ages. but the fourth annual survey of video games finds a 
small but significant core of ultraviolent games. these games are 
also far more perverse and antisocial in the way that they reward 
death and depravity. the survey acknowledges the industry has successfully 
implemented a voluntary ratings system on game violence. but -- there 
are very few retail stores across the country that refuse to sell 
games that are improperly rated, improperly to children. and there's 
growing concern too, that if a kid can't get the video he wants from 
a store, he can turn to the internet, where unless there's some sort 
of net nanny in place, he can try it out here. those who write about 
the computer and video game industry for a living say the future of 
violent games is rock solid. they have tremendous special effects. 
you're gonna see bodies cut in two, you're gonna see spurting blood 
against the wall, you're gonna see all sorts of grossness. but the 
reason for that is, because it's fantasy. and it's a fantasy the industry 
says is marketed to adults. seven out of ten video gamers and pc gamers 
are adults. this is not an industry just about kids anymore. critics 
and industry experts agree -- when buying games, pay attention to 
the rating label to determine what kind of violence or offensive language 
may be waiting inside. gina london, washington, cnn.
