You've seen the ads, people from all walks of celebrity in this country 
with that white milk moustache. Those not immediately recognizable 
are revealed only in the small print at the bottom. The only other 
words on the page are "got milk." The milk industry launched the expensive 
and aggressive campaign after seeing the popularity of their white 
beverage was under attack from other more popular drinks in the 1990's. 
Tonight, this "fleecing of America" news, Andrea Mitchell reports 
the catch phrase has a monetary catch. It's a giant and expensive 
ad campaign, intended to produce a cash cow for the milk industry. 
It's the celebrity milk moustache. Selling milk by trying to make 
it cool. The ads themselves are so popular they've been turned into 
posters. Teens collect them. And celebities like Pete Sampras even 
asked to be included. Mimming was seen as dull. I don't want to be 
seen with it. Today it's hip, it's cool, it's in. But are they really 
selling more mill snk people love the ads, but after four years, and 
at least $169 million, people are drinking even less milk than before 
the catchy campaign started. Government statistics show more than 
4% less. And who pays for the ads? Indirectly, you do. Everyone who 
buys milk pays roughly two cents a gallon, passed along by the industry 
to you, the consumer. In 1990, the milk industry asked Congress to 
help stop a 30-year decline in sales. So Congress ordered the department 
of agriculture to create and oversee an industry board to promote 
milk. But now a new government audit finds serious problems in the 
way the industry thazz run the campaign. A great deal of the money 
was basically misused. And that's got to be stopped. As for the ads 
themselves, the audit says the board paid $2.7 million for the moustache 
pictures, shot by celebrity photographerer annie libowitz. But the 
board didn't get a right to use them without paying more. The audit 
recommends suspending the whole campaign until the government tightens 
its controls. It's the agriculture's responsibility to monitor this. 
They're not playing by the rules. The department says it will fix 
the problems. The industry cause all this nitpicking, saying the ads 
have improved the image of milk. And without them, people would drink 
even less of it. You've got colas and juices and they are spending 
like crazy. They outspend us 10 to one. Still while some say the ads 
are fun, some fight call this the fleecing of America. Others might 
say you got milked. Andrea Mitchell, NBC news, Washington.
