'tis the holiday season, but in some places, spring is in the air. 
Record high temperatures are hitting areas from the Rockies to the 
northeast. Temperatures in some places are as much as 20 degrees above 
normal. Some ski resorts say it's even too warm to keep artificial 
snow frozen. And sporting goods stores report a drop in ski equipment 
sales, while mountain bikes and in-line skates continue to sell strong.
