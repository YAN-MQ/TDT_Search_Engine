Weather permitting, the second part of the international space station 
will head in to orbit tomorrow. Space shuttle "endeavour" is scheduled 
to lift off from Kennedy space center just before 4:00 A.M. eastern 
standard time. Forecasters predict only a 40% chance of favorable 
launch conditions. NASA says it is "very tentatively" considering 
Russia's request for another shuttle flight to Mir, to bring back 
science equipment that could be used on the space station.
