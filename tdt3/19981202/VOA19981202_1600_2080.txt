The head of the International Monetary Fund has ended talks with Russian 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov without pledging to release more loan 
payments to Russia. Michelle Komdasu told reporters in Moscow Russia 
must work harder to get its economic reforms back on track. He said 
the IMF will consider further support in January and that the multi-billion 
dollar loan package would remain on hold. Mr. Primakov said IMF support 
is essential if Russia is to meet huge debt payments that are due 
next year.
