Well, you don't change a winning team. Those are the words of Italian 
Davis Cup tennis team captain Paulo Bertolucci, as he announced his 
selections Tuesday for this week's final against Sweden in Milan. 
David Sanguinetti and Andrea Godenzi will play singles on the indoor 
play court beginning Friday, while Godenzi and Diego Nagiso will team 
up for the doubles match on Saturday. That's the same line up that 
upset the United States in the semi-finals since September in Milwaukee. 
Reverse singles match is in the best of five finalists set for Sunday.
