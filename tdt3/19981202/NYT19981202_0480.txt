Bryan Cox exploded last week after being fined $10,000 by the National 
Football League. In the process of sounding off, the New York Jets 
linebacker raised a thin curtain covering feelings and attitudes about 
race. Cox accused the NFL of maintaining a closed shop in regard to 
filling head coaching positions. ``The good-ol'-boy network is alive 
and kicking,'' he said. ``How many black owners are in this league? 
How many black coaches?'' Cox wondered about recycled coaches. He 
criticized the NFL for maintaining a ``tokens'' and ``house Negroes'' 
mentality. ``With this league being over 70 percent black,'' Cox said, 
``within the league office all the black people that are in any position 
of authority are always pitted against the players in the league. 
Why do we always have to be pitted against each other? Every time 
we have to be subject to discipline of some sort, it always has to 
be against a person of color.'' Cox never mentioned names, but Harold 
Henderson, the league's labor relations director, and Gene Washington, 
the director of football operations, were prominently mentioned as 
the highest ranking African-American executives in the league office. 
So, three African-American men, different generations, different regions, 
are connected to each other by race and by the NFL. Cox, 30, was born 
in East St. Louis, Ill., in 1968, three months before Martin Luther 
King Jr. was assassinated. Gene Washington, 51, was born in Tuscaloosa, 
Ala., moved to Long Beach, Calif., and attended Stanford. He was a 
senior at Stanford when King assassinated. Henderson was born in 1942 
in Washington. He went to Michigan State as an undergraduate and then 
to Harvard Law School. The year Cox was born and King was assassinated, 
Henderson was a 26-year-old rookie police officer in East Lansing, 
Mich. Henderson heard about Cox's remark from his children, who were 
home for Thanksgiving. ``When I got home from work my son said, `Dad, 
I guess Bryan Cox doesn't like you,' '' Henderson said Wednesday from 
Dallas, where he was conducting a seminar for club employees who deal 
with player contracts. ``My son said, `So you and Gene are the only 
black executives in the league, and are always pitted against the 
players?''' Henderson's first reaction was ``Here we go again,'' he 
said. ``This is a guy who just is overly emotional and running off 
at the mouth in a way that showed total lack of thought.'' He said 
Cox had ``a narrow point of view'' and added, ``You have to understand 
that in the work force, that's the nature of management. That's the 
way the work force views management: as being opposed to them. To 
the extent that Gene and I and anybody else in the league is management, 
there are some people in the work force who are going to consider 
that as being opposed to them.'' Henderson admitted there was a prevailing 
strain of racism in a process that allows owners and general managers 
to repeatedly tap into the old boys network. ``Is it present in people's 
attitudes?'' he said. ``It probably is. We have to adjust the process 
by which coaches are changed. We have to open the closed group. You 
go on gut feeling and emotion: you tend to like people who are like 
yourself. Is that racism? Bottom line, it is. Subtle, subtle unseen 
racism, unintentional.'' For Henderson, the message had credence, 
the messenger did not. ``Bryan is one of those people who see racism 
in everything they don't like,'' Henderson said. ``If it goes against 
them, it's racism. Racism is a hot button.'' But Washington, who played 
in the NFL for 10 years, took a broader, slightly more compassionate 
view. ``I think the bigger picture is that things like this are a 
manifestation of a bigger issue,'' Washington said. ``This is just 
sort of a lightening rod. We're sort of insignificant players in this 
deal. ``To me the question is, `Are things getting better?''' Washington 
added. ``I think they are. To show you how old I am, when I broke 
in in 1969, black cornerbacks were a rarity. Forget trying to be coaches; 
we just wanted to be able to play certain positions.'' Asked about 
Cox's criticism about blacks being pitted against blacks, Washington 
said: ``It comes with the territory. If you're a black person, in 
a job like Harold's or in my job, it comes with the territory and 
you have to be able to handle it.''
