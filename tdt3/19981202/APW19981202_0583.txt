A parliamentary committee unanimously agreed Wednesday on a bill to 
cut subsidies to racist parties, following weeks of haggling over 
public funding for the extreme right Vlaams Blok party. The Vlaams 
Blok and Dutch-speaking conservatives stayed away from the vote in 
protest, allowing the bill to proceed without opposition. The bill 
is expected to be passed by the full House of Representatives on Dec. 
10 and later by the Senate with the backing of eight of the ten parties. 
Under the proposal passed Wednesday, Belgium's highest administrative 
court, the Council of State, would have authority to judge if parties 
are racist. A party could appeal the decision. The bill has become 
a hot issue with elections approaching next June. Polls indicate the 
Vlaams Blok could further erode the electoral base of the traditional 
parties. The Vlaams Blok has made major advances in Dutch-speaking 
regions, winning 12.2 percent of the Flemish vote in 1995 with an 
anti-immigrant, Flemish nationalist program. The anti-racism move 
originated among the French-speaking parties and also rose linguistic 
tension in the legislature. But many fear the drawn-out public battles 
over the issue, may have given the Vlaams Blok more publicity that 
the party could have paid for. ``We have to prepare much better for 
things like this. We have to make clear which way we want to go,'' 
said Louis Van Velthoven, the parliamentary leader of the ruling Dutch-speaking 
Socialists. The Christian Democrats of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene 
also want to move on. ``Now we have to prove we also care about the 
real issues facing the people,'' said the party's parliamentary leader 
Paul Tant. The Vlaams Blok said it would not get a fair hearing if 
the bill is passed. The Dutch-speaking Conservatives objected on legal 
grounds. ``It's hysteria and that has always proved to be a bad advisor,'' 
said Conservative leader Patrick Dewael. ``The parties started their 
electoral campaign with this.'' Under Belgian law, political parties 
are restricted from seeking private funding and instead receive cash 
handouts from the state based on their election results. This year, 
the Vlaams Blok receives 52 million francs (dlrs 1.53 million). In 
comparison, Prime Minister's Jean-Luc Dehaene's Dutch-speaking Christian 
Democrat party is the top recipient with 108 million francs (dlrs 
3.18 million).
