Court trial procedures throughout China must be opened to the public 
starting next year, the country's top judicial official was quoted 
as saying Wednesday. Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's 
Court, said at a national conference that courts must open up so that 
ordinary people may observe deliberation over the evidence, legal 
arguments and the announcement of verdicts. China's courts so far 
have ignored guidelines calling for open trials, sometimes because 
the judges do not have the skills needed to do their jobs, the state-run 
Xinhua News Agency quoted Xiao as saying. A former justice minister, 
Xiao has pushed to wipe out corruption and bring greater accountability 
to the largely closed, often badly run court system since he became 
head of the top court in March. He recently warned judges should not 
accept gifts and attend banquets while carrying out their duties. 
``Verdicts must be made public in a timely manner to avoid under-the-table 
deals,'' Xinhua quoted him as saying. Judges should also cite legal 
grounds for their verdicts in order to help the public understand 
the legal system, he said. While Chinese courts seldom use the jury 
system, lawmakers were discussing laws about how to select jurors 
and what their rights and duties should be, Xiao said. Some courts 
in Beijing and other parts of the country recently made hearings public. 
The government has indicated it will continue to hold closed trials 
for people accused under the vague state secrets law used to prosecute 
dissidents.
