The Italian highway and fast food company Autogrill said Wednesday 
it is negotiating with the French national railway system, SNCF, for 
the concessions to restaurants at 13 French train stations. ``We are 
in talks with SNCF and hopefully they will be concluded positively 
by year-end,'' said Paolo Prota Giurleo, the managing director of 
Autogrill. He Giurleo told a news conference that other bidders had 
dropped out and ``now we are alone at the table with SNCF.'' The daily 
newspaper Milano Finanza said Wednesday that Autogrill would pay around 
97 billion lire (dlrs 59 million) for the concessions. SNCF, through 
Frantour, has the concessions for 13 restaurants in French railway 
stations.
