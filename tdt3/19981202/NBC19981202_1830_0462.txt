Of all the bizarre twists and turns the American economy has taken 
over the past year, a huge round of layoff announce announcements 
right before the holidays is one of the most puzzling and the most 
painful for the thousands of workers who are now finding that a strong 
economy at home is no guarantee that your job is safe. Here's NBC's 
Jim Avila. More than a half million Americans face layoffs this year, 
well on the way to a record. What's happening out there? Mergers, 
the five largest in U.S. history, all born in 1998. From oil companies, 
to banks, to phone companies. Giant marriages that ultimately streamline 
and downsize, cut the workforce. You got to cut costs, because Wall 
Street is going to cut your stock price precipitously, if you don't. 
Michael Bourque, blue collar worker at mobil oil, in Beaumont, texas. 
His job, now on the line, after the new merged mobil/Exxon created 
a Company larger than some countries, and now projecting layoffs of 
9,000 people labeled redundant. These companies are making obscene 
earnings. I mean, they're making huge, huge earnings. But that's not 
enough. They continue to cut workers and expect more. He's not alone. 
1998 is just the peak of a layoff spree that began in the 90's and 
is growing. Boeing's announced job cuts, this year 48,000 workers. 
Today Kellogg is announcing layoffs, 525 employees at their battle 
Creek factory. You have to make these changes and deliver value to 
consumers and ultimately deliver. Your first priority, value to your 
shareholders. These changes do not signal trouble. Why, because the 
American economy is so strong it is creating many more jobs than are 
lost. 2 million more this year than last. And the new jobs are not 
at fast food restaurants, real earnings are up nearly 4% this year, 
People can land elsewhere in the economy, where they couldn't a few 
years ago, even if they're pushed out of their cushy, corporate jobs. 
Experts say in today's climate, workers won't be staying with companies 
long enough to earn a gold watch, but should be paid enough to buy 
their own. Jim Avila, NBC news, Chicago.
