And the death toll from Hurricane Mitch in Honduras has dropped after 
a government investigation of a regional governor's fatality figures. 
As VOA's Greg Flakus reports from Mexico City, the governor has been 
suspended pending investigation of the issue. The government of Honduras 
has suspended Governor Lucilla Esperanza Baralona De Castro of Northwestern 
Santa Barbara region, one of the areas hit hardest by Hurricane Mitch 
in late October and early November. According to a preliminary investigation, 
the governor over reported the number of dead in her area by 1,350 
people, the new death toll being cited by the Honduran Interior Ministry 
as 5,657. This would also lower the overall toll for Central America 
to just over 9,000. Government officials say the suspension of the 
governor is a routine measure taken during an inquiry of this kind. 
Investigating teams from the Interior Ministry had been working throughout 
the Central America nation over the past few weeks to verify death 
counts. The numbers had been questioned by international aid workers 
when the Honduran figures jumped from 600 to 5,000 on the same day 
that reports from Nicaragua indicated that some 2,000 people had been 
killed in a mud slide on the slopes of a volcano. Honduran officials 
denied there was any attempt to manipulate figures of dead and disappeared 
in order to gain more international disaster aid. They say they still 
have no firm figure total deaths because the investigation is continuing. 
Honduran officials say that in addition to the deaths, the storm left 
more than 8,000 missing, more than 12,000 people injured, and more 
than a million people homeless. Greg Flakus, VOA News, Mexico City.
