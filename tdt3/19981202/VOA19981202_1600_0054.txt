The Israeli government says it will not carry out more troop withdrawals 
in the West Bank until the Palestinian authority meets a list of conditions. 
VOA correspondent David Gullis has more from Jerusalem. Israel is 
supposed to make two more troop pull backs in the West Bank by the 
end of next month under the Wye River memorandum, but an Israeli government 
statement late Tuesday said there will be another withdrawal only 
if the Palestinian authority makes clear it is abandoning threats 
to declare statehood and commits itself to negotiating that and other 
final status issues of the peace process. The announcement reflected 
growing Israeli anger over statements by Palestinian leader Yasir 
Arafat about statehood this week in Washington, and what officials 
see as anti-Israel incitement by Palestinians on prisoner releases. 
Palestinians charge that Israel violated the Wye agreement by freeing 
mostly common criminals rather than political and military prisoners 
in last month's initial release. But Israel denies this and accuses 
Palestinian leaders of fomenting anti-Israel violence over the issue.
