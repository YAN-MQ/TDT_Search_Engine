Secretary Mike Espy on charges that he accepted illegal gifts from 
companies his agency regulated. Espy, a 45 year old former Congressman 
from Mississippi, was elated. Each and every day, I read the 27th 
psalm. And it basically says that the Lord is my light and my salvation.

Donald Smaltz spent more than four years and $17 million prosecuting 
Espy. While we are disappointed with the jury's verdict. We accept
