The social costs of the Asian economic crisis are far higher than 
initial estimates and are ``dramatically worsening,'' according to 
a report issued here on Tuesday by the International Labor Organization, 
a U.N. agency. The ILO said the economic collapse had resulted in 
a combustible mixture of soaring unemployment, spreading poverty and 
dashed expectations. The lack of social welfare programs made the 
hardest-hit countries, like Indonesia, ``fertile ground for breeding 
social unrest.'' ``I would veer to the pessimistic side,'' said Eddy 
Lee, an ILO economist, who wrote the report. ``The unrest in Indonesia 
is spilling over into Malaysia. And even where you don't have street 
riots, there is a tremendous amount of social instability just beneath 
the surface.'' Indonesia has seen violent clashes between soldiers 
and students and between Christians and Muslims. In Malaysia demonstrators 
are protesting against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad for ousting 
and imprisoning his deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim. The report 
called on governments to increase spending on social programs, particularly 
unemployment insurance, which is largely unknown in Asia. It likened 
the current crisis to the Great Depression of the 1930s, which galvanized 
the United States to weave a social safety net. ``The question we 
asked was, `What could people in these countries expect?' '' Lee said. 
``The answer was, `Very little.' '' In its bleak and even alarmist 
tone, the report is starkly at odds with both Asia's resurgent financial 
markets and other international agencies, like the International Monetary 
Fund, that have played up the prospects for a rebound. Lee said a 
swift recovery was unlikely, given the deeper than expected recessions 
in Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea. In Indonesia, the report estimates, 
economic output will decline 15 percent in 1998, while in Thailand 
and South Korea it will shrink by 6.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively. 
Along with the abrupt loss of commercial activity has come rapidly 
accelerating unemployment. The report estimates that the crisis has 
wiped out one-fifth of non-farm jobs in Indonesia this year, a loss 
that will drive 40 million people, or 20 percent of the population, 
into poverty. In Thailand, the report predicts, the unemployment rate 
will triple, to 6 percent, this year. Even in South Korea, which is 
perceived as being on the road to recovery, unemployment is expected 
to jump to 8.2 percent, from 2.3 percent, while 12 percent of Koreans 
will sink under the poverty line. ``What the crisis has driven home 
is the consequence of not having stronger social policies,'' Lee said. 
He noted that of these countries, only South Korea offers even rudimentary 
unemployment benefits. Lee conceded that financially strapped Asian 
governments did not have the resources to subsidize unemployment insurance 
on a mass scale. But he said such benefits could be financed through 
a modest payroll tax. With Asia moving from panic to painful recovery, 
more people are focusing on the social implications of the downturn. 
Former Vice President Walter Mondale said in an interview in Hong 
Kong Wednesday that Indonesia, in particular, could spin out of control 
without a sturdier social safety net. ``You have religious fissures, 
Christians fighting Muslims, and disaffected students,'' said Mondale, 
who was sent by President Clinton on a special mission to Indonesia 
last March. ``I'm very worried about it.''
