A Taliban leader says evidence given to them by U.S. officials against 
the Saudi militant, Osama bin Laden, wasn't good enough for Taliban 
authorities to try Mr. bin Laden for alleged terrorism. The leader, 
Juaquil Ahmed, made the remarks in an interview with VOA. Aya Sgul 
reports from Islamabad. Juaquil Ahmed is a senior leader and close 
aide to the Taliban Islamic movement's chief, Mula Mohammed Omar. 
Speaking to an interpreter, Mr. Ahmed tells VOA American officials 
did provide evidence against Mr. bin Laden, but he says it was of 
little value. The only thing we have received is a video cassette. 
It was given to the embassy in Islamabad, and the video cassette contained 
some news editions which was from the CNN, and it was a little bit 
of gossip. I think it's not something which can help us to any evidence. 
But an American embassy spokesman in Islamabad says the United States 
provided more than a video cassette. He tells VOA the United States 
gave the Taliban a copy of the grand jury indictment under which bin 
Laden would be tried in the United States. The U.S. spokesman refused 
to give further details. Osama bin Laden has been indicted by the 
U.S. government in connection with the August bombings of two American 
embassies in East Africa. More than 200 people were killed in the 
attacks. The Taliban Supreme Court in Afghanistan set November 20th 
as the deadline for receiving any evidence of terrorist acts by Mr. 
bin Laden. The court declared him innocent after the deadline expired 
saying on evidence was received showing Mr. bin Laden is guilty of 
terrorism. The American embassy spokesman says the evidence was submitted 
to the Taliban in time. The Taliban official, Juaquil Ahmed, does 
not rule out the possibility of reopening the case against Mr. bin 
Laden. We have not closed the court against him, but we have closed 
his file. So if somebody has no evidence, proof of his crime, it means 
that he has done nothing. So we have closed his file, and if there 
is any future evidence, we will talk later. The U.S. State Department 
has offered $5 million for information leading to Mr. bin Laden's 
arrest. He's currently living in Afghanistan where Taliban authorities 
say he is their guest. This is Aya Sgul for VOA News, Islamabad.
