THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO forces on Wednesday arrested the 
most senior Bosnian Serb military figure yet to be seized for U.N. 
trial on genocide and war crimes charges. Gen. Radislav Krstic was 
arrested in a section of northern Bosnia controlled by U.S. troops 
serving in NATO's Stabilization Force, better known as SFOR. The Yugoslav 
war crimes tribunal has charged him in the 1995 massacre of Muslim 
civilians fleeing Srebrenica. Krstic was ``a very significant military 
leader,'' said Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war 
crimes tribunal. Arbour said she was delighted at the arrest of Krstic, 
who was indicted in October on charges of genocide, grave breaches 
of the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity. SFOR spokeswoman 
Maj. Sheena Thomson said Krstic was arrested without incident and 
would be sent to The Hague tribunal for trial on charges stemming 
from the wartime massacre of thousands of Muslims who fled the U.N. 
safe haven of Srebrenica after it was taken over by Serb rebels. He 
was indicted for genocide, complicity to commit genocide, extermination, 
murder, and persecution for his alleged personal involvement in the 
atrocities and his command of troops carrying out the massacres, the 
tribunal announced. In a statement, Arbour, of Canada, said the arrest 
was ``very significant for the continuing work of the tribunal.'' 
Amor Masovic, the head of a Bosnian Muslim commission unearthing mass 
graves containing victims of the 3 1/2-year war, said he expected 
the case to yield important facts related 8,000 people still missing 
from Srebrenica. ``I'm very pleased that one of ... the executors 
of genocide, the destruction of the entire population of a wider region 
of Bosnia made it to The Hague,'' he said. But Petar Djokic, president 
of the Bosnian Serb parliament, said Krstic's arrest on a secret indictment 
``brings uncertainty to people, a feeling that every citizen of Republika 
Srpska can be regarded as a potential war criminal in the eyes of 
the tribunal, and that SFOR is authorized to arrest anybody, anytime, 
anywhere.'' Republika Srpska is the Serb entity within Bosnia. Serbs 
account for the vast majority of suspects publicly indicted by the 
U.N. court. Krstic was the commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian 
Serb Army. He is believed to be a close associate of former Bosnian 
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko 
Mladic, the tribunal's top two indicted suspects. Both Karadzic and 
Mladic have been indicted for genocide for allegedly masterminding 
the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica. Neither is in custody. ``Persons 
indicted for war crimes who are still at large should realize they, 
too, will be brought to justice,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
said Wednesday after the arrest. Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect 
to be arrested in the former Yugoslavia by international forces. He 
was named head of the Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995 
after the fall of Srebrenica.
