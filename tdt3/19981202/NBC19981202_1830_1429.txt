I'll be right back with a "fleecing of America" that some say really 
milks the average milk drinker. Got a new product here, and all I 
wanna do is wash your hair. hi! Here in beautiful downtown Miami to 
find out what people think about new pert plus. Gonna ask this lady. 
Excuse me, MA'am! Excuse me! hep! hi! Could I ask you a couple of 
questions? Do you mind? Okay, have you ever used a shampoo and a conditioner 
all in the same bottle? Yes, I have. Okay! - What'd you think of 'em? 
- I hated 'em. - I don't like 'em. - It's not good. Have you ever 
tried one of those shampoos and conditioners in one? Uh-huh. I hate 
those. Yeah? What'd you think of--? You hate-- you don't like 'em 
at all? Why not? why? - My hair feels-- - they leave A, like a build-up. 
- It's build-up. - but I go an all new version... of pert plus with 
clean conditioning. - Yeah. - you're gonna shampoo my hair right here? 
Ironically enough, yeah. But this stuff since they re-did it, I-it's 
been revolutionarily, like, redesigned with water-based conditioning. 
There's no build up, so your hair's gonna feel clean, clean! - Feels 
great. - Feels great. - It feels great. I mean, I can feel the volume 
just like-- and the softness. - I love it. - Oh, my gosh. - Light. 
- It's so soft. - It's wonderful. Hey, that's pert plus with clean 
conditioning. Fantastic. If we can wash your hair, we can change your 
mind. Excuse me! Excuse me! Ah, the good old days of supermarket shopping. 
Where nothing stood between you and your next meal. Nothing. But today, 
there are materials that help lock out harmful contaminants and reduce 
spoilage. Keeping us safe and the food we eat fresh. Plastics make 
it possible. So now, the rest is history.
