Some gift shops have nice museums attached. In fact, museum shops 
are proliferating so wildly that some might call it a whole new mall 
game. They are bright little exhibitions all to themselves _ good 
places for holiday browsing and gift-buying. At the American Museum 
of Natural History, one-of-a-kind sequined banners and other arts 
and crafts are featured at the Vodou shop outside the exhibition on 
the sacred arts of Haiti. The Philadelphia Museum of Art has Moroccan 
handicrafts inspired by its current Delacroix show. Successful shows 
make for successful shops, and museums depend on the shops' profits, 
with public and private money drying up. Last year, retail sales at 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art totaled $83 million; two shops at the 
Museum of Modern Art pulled in $20 million. At the Museum of American 
Folk Art, the shop gave back $150,000. ``That might sound like a small 
amount,'' said Jeffrey Grand, the director of finance and operations, 
``but you really miss it if it isn't there. And try to go out and 
raise that money.'' Emphasizing originality, museum shops like the 
MOMA Design Store have been hiring curatorial elves with retailing 
prowess. But unlike the situation at a department store, said John 
Curran, vice president of retailing at the Met and an alumnus of Gump's, 
``I have 110 curators weighing in on new products.'' Museum shops 
offer creative gifts for less than $25. Yes, you can shop on the Web 
(at www.museumshop.com), but you'll miss the joy of ambling through 
the museum show when you're done. MUSEUM SHOPS American Museum of
