The United States says it will declassify and release documents relating 
to abuses in Chile during the 17-year regime of former Chilean dictator, 
Augusto Pinochet. State Department spokesperson James Rubin says the 
Clinton administration is reviewing papers in its possession that 
could shed light on human rights abuses from that era. The 83-year-old 
former strong man remains under guard in London awaiting a decision 
on whether he will be extradited to Spain to face charges of crimes 
against humanity.
