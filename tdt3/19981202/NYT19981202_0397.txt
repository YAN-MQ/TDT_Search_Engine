Stocks weakened Wednesday after Boeing and Sears, Roebuck warned of 
lower 1999 profits, but all major averages rebounded smartly during 
the afternoon to finish with losses well under 1 percent. ``There 
was pressure coming in, only to be met by strong institutional demand,'' 
said Joseph Battipaglia, investment policy chairman at Gruntal &AMP; 
Co. He said some of this buying reflected ``window dressing'' by portfolio 
managers eager to be seen holding winners in year-end statements. 
Boeing's disclosure late Tuesday that it expected profits to be as 
much as 25 percent less than the company projected in July sent its 
shares plunging 6 11/16, to 33 11/16, accounting for 40 percent of 
the loss in the Dow Jones industrial average. The blue-chip gauge 
closed 69 points lower after having skidded more than 178 points at 
midday. But the aircraft maker's swoon, which also prompted selling 
in United Technologies, down 4 13/16, to 101|, and other of its suppliers, 
was said to be more a reflection of disappointment with Boeing's erratic 
response to Asian economic problems than to fears that Asian orders 
will shrink further. As for Sears, which now predicts an earnings 
rise of 1 percent to 3 percent instead of the 5.2 percent that Wall 
Street expected, fell 1 9/16, to 43, as most department stores and 
discounters lost ground. Although most Internet stocks and other speculative 
favorites lost ground, buyers gave the latest initial public offering 
a warm reception. E-Tek Dynamics offered 5 million shares at 12 and 
the fiber optics company traded as high as 29~ before closing at 26}. 
The recent frenzied buying of almost every company with an Internet 
tie brought a strong expression of concern from John Laporte, a specialist 
in small-capitalization companies at T. Rowe Price. ``It clearly represents 
a speculative bubble,'' not unlike tulip mania centuries ago in the 
Netherlands, he told an investment seminar in New York. ``I think 
it's quite worrisome.'' A report of stepped-up insider selling at 
Excite and other Internet companies apparently dampened enthusiasm 
Wednesday. Another sign that the market may be growing less exuberant, 
observed Richard Cripps, chief strategist at Legg Mason, is a survey 
showing less bullishness among Wall Street traders. The latest reading 
found 60 percent optimistic, down from 78 percent last week. Exxon, 
which said it retained the ability to call off its acquisition of 
Mobil if demands of antitrust enforcers were judged too onerous, eased 
], to 71\. Drug stocks were among the afternoon's recovery pacesetters. 
Schering-Plough gained 4], Bristol-Myers 3 7/16, Pfizer 2 1/16 and 
Merck, American Home Products and Abbott a point or more each. Friday, 
Citigroup will begin trading under the ticker symbol C, the designation 
for Chrysler before the automaker merged with Daimler-Benz. The Standard 
&AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 0.34 percent Wednesday while 
the Nasdaq composite was down 0.43 percent. The Russell 2000, however, 
did worse than the Dow, falling 1.25 percent. On the New York Stock 
Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by 1,737 to 
1,348, with 74 making new highs for the year and 56 new lows. Volume 
was a moderate 727.43 million. Shares were mostly lower overseas _ 
1.12 percent in Brazil, 1.36 percent in Germany, 1.04 percent in France 
and 0.55 percent in Britain. Prices rose, however, in Japan and Hong 
Kong, by 1.02 percent and 0.8 percent.
