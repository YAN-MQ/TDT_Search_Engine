This is the Voice of America coming to you from Washington. I'm Tony 
Riggs, along with Erin Brummett bringing you this hour of VOA News 
Now. Have you talked about your child's health today? All parents 
want the best for their babies, and the best begins with good food. 
For young infants, breast milk alone is the best food until a baby 
is four or five months old. Then you can begin to add solid food. 
As girls and boys grow, they need a diet filled with a variety of 
green and orange colored vegetables, fruits, tubers, rice, bread, 
and beans, or other legumes. Find out from a health worker about the 
best foods to feed growing children. Your child's health is your family's 
future. It's 21 hours 18 universal time. Here's the hour's top news 
story. NATO-led troops have arrested a Bosnian Serb general on genocide 
charges in connection with the 1995 massacres near the former U.N. 
safe haven of Srebrenica. We'll have more on that story and the rest 
of this hour's top news in our next summary 12 minutes from now. MUSIC
