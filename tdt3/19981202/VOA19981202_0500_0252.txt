The United States says it will declassify and release documents relating 
to abuses in Chile during the 17-year regime of former Chilean dictator, 
Augusto Pinochet. State Department spokesperson James Rubin says the 
Clinton administration is reviewing papers in its possession that 
could shed light on human rights abuses from that era. There has been 
interest expressed in what we might have available that will help 
people come to their own conclusions about what transpired. This is 
not a report of the United States government, it's not a conclusion 
of the United States government; this is an effort on our part, given 
the extensive human rights abuses that occurred in Chile, to try to 
assist those who want to know more about a problem like this, and 
that is the reason for it. It's not designed for us to reach conclusions, 
but for us to provide raw information that will help others to reach 
conclusions. The 83-year-old former strong man remains under guard 
in London awaiting a decision on whether he will be extradited to 
Spain to face charges of crimes against humanity.
