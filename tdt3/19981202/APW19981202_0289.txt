Hoping to ease a tightening of credit to commercial banks and businesses, 
Taiwan's central bank offered Wednesday to mobilize its massive foreign 
currency reserves _ if necessary _ to keep cash flowing. The central 
bank said it was responding to a decision in late November by U.S. 
credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service to downgrade 10 of 
Taiwan's largest banks. That prompted foreign banks to trim credit 
lines and raise interest rates for local companies and banks, said 
J.S. Duann, a deputy director of foreign exchange at the central bank. 
The central bank's support gave the jittery credit market a psychological 
boost _ although there were no specific promises for how much money 
it might provide. Whether or not the bank actually does dip into its 
massive cash pile to spur lending in Taiwan, the move would lower 
the costs of obtaining foreign currency for banks and businesses that 
now find themselves short of cash amid a slowing economy and a drop 
in exports, Duann said. Despite criticizing recent government intervention 
in financial markets, western bankers seemed mostly upbeat about the 
central bank's action. The move could help calm fears in the banking 
sector, where many believe risks are growing as companies encounter 
cash flow problems, bankers and economists said. The central bank's 
stance ``will allow fundamentally sound banks to get the foreign currency 
that they need,'' said John McGowan, treasurer at Hong Kong Banking 
Corp. The central bank's show of strength will also help allay rumors 
of weaknesses among financial institutions, he said. Buoyed by foreign 
reserves that now total U.S. dlrs 88.1 billion and with little foreign 
debt, Taiwan has weathered the Asian economic crisis far better than 
most countries in the region. But the economy has been hit by plunging 
export growth and slumping domestic demand, and is expected to grow 
just over 5 percent this year, down from 6.8 percent in 1997. In the 
latest crisis, authorities announced an unprecedented 100 billion 
Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 3 billion) bailout package for the Taichung 
Business Bank after a run on deposits sparked by reports of irregular 
loans. The bank's chairman and some other directors were replaced 
in the scandal that led to the third financial rescue plan authorized 
by the Ministry of Finance for financial institutions in the last 
few months.
