U.S. Special Envoy Anthony Lake is on his way to the Horn of Africa 
to resume his efforts to end the border conflict between Ethiopia 
and Eritrea. Mr. Lake is scheduled to arrive in Arisabula on Thursday. 
Last month, he met separately with the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea 
but no progress was announced. In Washington, the State Department 
says failure to find a peaceful solution to the conflict could have 
grave consequences for those two countries and damage U.S. interest 
in the region.
