Well, the palm pilot is expanding into cyberspace. 3com, the maker 
of the popular handheld computer, is adding features to include wireless 
access to the world wide web. The new model will be slightly larger 
than the old version, which is about the size of a deck of cards. 
3com expects web sites offering travel and weather data to tailor 
information for its new palm pilot. No word yet on the price of the 
device.
