Representatives for the National Basketball Association team owners 
and players are scheduled to meet again Thursday, but the season remains 
in jeopardy. The talks come nearly two weeks after the last full bargaining 
session in New York. The session scheduled for last Saturday was canceled 
when players union head, Billy Hunter, refused to abide by conditions 
set down by the league. The owners locked players out on July 1st 
claiming the players are making too much money for some teams to stay 
in business. The labor dispute has led to the cancellation of 203 
games so far this season.
