President Clinton says voters want Washington to get down to business, 
and deal with issues like social security and health care. He says 
his patients' Bill of rights is needed to ensure managed care providers 
treat patients as people, and not as dollar signs. 30 days ago, the 
American people gave all of us our marching orders. They want us to 
work on their behalf. They want us to work on their business. They 
want us to go forward into the future with progress, not partisanship. 
We heard them, loud and clear. And all of us look forward to working 
with our colleagues across party lines to create a new season of achievement 
and progress for the American people. The president's comments came 
today, after a meeting at the White House with Senate democrats.
