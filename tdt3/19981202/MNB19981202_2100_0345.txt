there has been a not guilty guilty tonight for a man who's been in 
some trouble for some time. President Clinton's agriculture secretary, 
Mike Espy, was forced to resign, accused of accepting gifts and favors 
from the companies he regulated. Today he was completely exonerated. 
A federal jury has found him not guilty on 30 corruption counts. As 
NBC news department Williamson women reports, this may be a huge blow 
to the independent counsel law. For Mike Espy, today's verdict, not 
guilty, ends a four-year legal cloud. That's how long an independent 
counsel has been going after Espy, accusing him of illegally accepting 
favors. But Espy insists they never had any affect on his decisions. 
And today, a federal court jury agreed. I knew this would come today, 
and I knew it would come this way. This was the relentless and unsupervised 
pursuit of the trivial. Espy was accused of accepting $33,000 worth 
of gifts like luggage, cash for his girlfriend, and airplane tickets 
from companies the agriculture department regulates. Prosecutors say 
he actually requested some of it, getting an aide, for example, to 
ask quaker oats for tickets to a Chicago Bulls game. When word of 
the gifts became public, White House officials forced him to resign, 
calling his behavior inappropriate. But was it criminal? Several weeks 
of testimony and two days of deliberation led the jury to an emphatic 
no, cleared of all counts. Espy himself never testified. And today, 
he blasted the independent counsel $17 million investigation. And 
stand up to the schoolyard bullies whether they in the playground 
or the public courtroom, whether they have five cents or whether they 
have $20 million. His lawyers says the verdict had nothing to do either 
with the jury's makeup, 11 blacks and one white. I would like to think 
Mike Espy would have gotten off any place because he didn't do anything. 
And all this business about race really is a bunch of garbage. Today, 
the independent counsel defended his record, saying he has successfully 
prosecuted others involved in the Espy case. Those prosecutions have 
resulted in 15 convictions and we have collected over $11 million 
in fines and penalties. Even so, many in Congress will no doubt cite 
this as a reason to drastically change the independent counsel law 
when it comes up for renewal next year. Espy says he wants to be the 
first witness. Pete Williams, NBC news, Washington.
