The small-town institution of the country store is slowly disappearing 
in america. David crabtree of affiliate wral reports on one that's 
still going strong. This one right here in 1960. 38 years -- and not 
much has changed at olive's cash service, or "Fat boy's" as folks 
have come to call it. Hey, there. How are you, MA'am? Good. All right, 
thank you. Nothing's changed, except fat boy himself is a bit thinner 
and a Bit older. 70 years old, 19th of September. Bryce olive has 
given way to a few new brand names. And he's got a good selection 
of most anything you want, from clothes to shoes or whatever. I bought 
these shoes to work in. Amen. And just comin' out here to get me a 
pair. Gettin' ready for a pair. Then hit where the threads are. Yeah, 
okay. The advice is free, as long as you pay cash. We don't mess with 
the credit card. We just tell them we just don't have the label. We 
lay off of checks, too. Lay off of them. I got many thousands of dollars 
worth in here. They aren't worth the paper they wrote on. Most places 
nowadays will take your credit. Hey, speaking of gas, how about filling 
it up? In apex, there is a new fully automated gas station. But there's 
no one to shake hands with. While you're here, why not get your car 
washed? If you have a problem, you talk to someone in Texas. Do you 
need a receipt, sir? Odds are, there will be more of this -- My kid's 
gotta eat. And less -- Sure do thank you. -- of that. Your mother 
doing good, too? She's doing real good. Her and Ricky both are. That's 
good. I call this "the vanishing American scene." That's what I entitle 
them, because they're gonna be gone. They're going one-by-one down 
the path. People are taking them down and building new stores and 
new landscapes in that area. And the stores just don't fit in with 
their architecture anymore. Well, this is why we grew up. We grew 
up at these stores. Hey, how you doing? Though he has no one to take 
over the store when he and his wife are gone, Bryce olive refuses 
to believe the personal touch is out of style. And there's still room 
for them to be here when I'm long gone. His customers wouldn't have 
it any other way. He is -- he's one of the greatest people to come 
visit. You can tell they care about their customers. He's a good community 
man. And he's served the well springs area good. You hurry back, MA'am. 
All right, I sure will. That was David crabtree from CNN affiliate 
wral.
