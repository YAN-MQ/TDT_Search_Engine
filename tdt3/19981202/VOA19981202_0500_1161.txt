The Orioles weren't finished pulling off a three-way trade with the 
New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers. Baltimore traded Relibo Ormando 
Benitez to the New York Mets for catcher Charles Johnson. Johnson 
was traded earlier in the day, along with outfielder Roger Sadanio 
from the Los Angeles Dodgers to the New York Mets in exchange for 
catcher Tod Hunley. And the New York Mets have reportedly signed free 
agent third baseman Robin Ventura to a $32 million, four year deal. 
Ventura comes over from the Chicago White Sox where he hit 263 with 
21 homers and 91 runs batted in last season. He also won his fifth 
gold glove for defensive excellence.
