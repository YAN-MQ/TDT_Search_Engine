with a look at your "cnn headline news" weather, i'm karen maginnis. 
temperatures will cool down all the way into the desert southwest 
as a developing storm system will produce a little bit of snowfall 
across the mountains. in tucson, temperatures barely making it to 
60 degrees. but lots of 60s and 70s from the mid-atlantic all the 
way into the southeast. from the middle of the work week going into 
thursday, it will still be a bit breezy into new england. a fairly 
vigorous weather system pushes across the pacific northwest and into 
central california across the great basin and lots of moisture into 
the desert southwest. not a very nice day across the hawaiian islands. 
it's going to be fairly showery and windy. windy and stormy across 
the caribbean, as well. our extended forecast still shows unsettled 
weather for the northwest and into the southern great plains. but 
mostly 70s in the southeast. by friday, snow begins to invade the 
rockies. and then by saturday, very unsettled from the great lakes 
into the great basin and the northwest. for more weather information,
