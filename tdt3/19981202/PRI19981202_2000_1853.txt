Russia's population is facing another hard winter. But head of the 
International Monetary Fund Michel Kandasu says more talks are needed 
before further funds can be given to Russia. He was speaking after 
meeting with Russian Prime Minister Yevgemi Primakov in Moscow. Andrew 
Harding reports. Yevgemi Primakov, who recently ridiculed the IMF's 
experts as "inexperienced kids." Acknowledged that his government 
badly needed to regain access to the Fund's cheap loans. But to do 
so, he will have to meet their conditions. That will almost certainly 
involve making big spending cuts. A move which the Russian Parliament 
is unlikely to go along with. The result is a deadlock which could 
drag on for many months. As the government, Parliament and IMF argue 
over the details of the 1999 budget. Andrew Harding, BBC News, Moscow. 
The Fund stalled payments in September. Saying the new Russian government's 
economic plans were unrealistic.
