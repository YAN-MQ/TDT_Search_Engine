The United States says it will declassify and release documents relating 
to abuses in Chile during the 17-year regime of former Chilean dictator, 
Augusto Pinochet. State Department spokesperson James Rubin says the 
Clinton administration is reviewing papers in its possession that 
could shed light on human rights abuses from that era. But he says 
documents relating to U.S. national security will remain classified. 
Mr. Rubin adds Washington's strongly supports accountability but does 
not want to tell Britain or Chile how to resolve their dispute over 
General Pinochet's legal status. We think this is a matter for the 
courts. We do have an opinion on Pinochet's behavior, and we've stated 
very strong condemnation for the abuses that took place during his 
rule. We also have a general view about the importance of giving respect 
to democracies as they go through the process of balancing justice 
and reconciliation so long as they do so without sacrificing an important 
principle of accountability. That is our view. This is a matter for 
the government's concern. We have not been agitating to one or the 
other to do a particular thing, but the views that we've expressed 
privately, as you can imagine, would be consistent with the ones that 
we've expressed publicly. That is State Department spokesman James 
Rubin. The 83-year-old senator for life remains under guard in London. 
Mr. Pinochet is awaiting a decision on whether he will be extradited 
to Spain to face charges of crimes against humanity.
