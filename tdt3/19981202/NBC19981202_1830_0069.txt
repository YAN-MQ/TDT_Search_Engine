Good evening. When the investigation of former Clinton agriculture 
secretary Mike Espy began, it was billed as the largest corruption 
scandal of the administration. Tonight, it ended as a total victory 
for Espy. A federal jury found him not guilty on all counts. As NBC's 
Pete Williams reports, this very expensive four-year investigation 
was on trial as well. The "not guilty" verdict today ends Mike Espy's 
four years under a legal cloud. That's how long an independent counsel 
has been aggressively going after espy, accusing him of illegally 
accepting favors but Espy insists they never had any affect on his 
decisions. And today, a federal court jury agreed. He says he never 
doubted how it would end. I knew this would come today, and I knew 
it would come this way. This was the relentless and unsupervised pursuit 
of the trivial. Espy was accused of accepting $33,000 worth of gifts, 
like luggage, cash for his girlfriend, and airplane tickets from companies 
the agriculture department regulated. Prosecutors said he actually 
requested some of it, getting an aide, for example, to ask quaker 
oats for tickets to a Chicago Bulls' game. When word of the gifts 
became public, White House officials forced him to resign, calling 
his behavior inappropriate. But was it criminal? Seven weeks of testimony 
and two days of deliberation led the jury to an emphatic, no. Espy 
himself never even testified. And today, he blasted the independent 
counsel's $17 million investigation. And that's the message I'll leave 
the world. Stand up to the schoolyard bullies, whether they're on 
the playground or the public courtroom. Whether they have five cents 
or $20 million. His lawyer said the verdict had nothing to do with 
the jury's makeup. 11 blacks and 1 white. I would like to think Mike 
Espy would have gotten off anyplace, because he didn't do anything. 
And all this business about race is a bunch of garbage. Today, the 
independent counsel defended his record saying he has successfully 
prosecuted others in the Espy case. Those prosecutions have resulted 
in 15 convictions, and we have collected over $11 million in fines 
and penalties. Even so, many in Congress will cite this as a reason 
to drastically change the independent counsel law when it expires 
next year. Espy says he wants to be the first witness. Pete Williams,
