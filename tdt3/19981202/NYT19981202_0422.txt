Even as the House Judiciary Committee moves to expand its impeachment 
inquiry, a growing number of conservatives are coming to terms with 
what they increasingly see as the painful and galling reality that 
President Clinton will keep his job. ``I don't know of anyone who 
still thinks he'll be removed from office,'' said the conservative 
writer Arianna Huffington. She said attempts by congressional Republicans 
to shift the focus to a perjury charge and Clinton's campaign finances 
would probably not change anything. ``It's too late,'' Ms. Huffington 
said. That does not mean the pressure on Republicans in Congress to 
forge ahead with impeachment proceedings has eased. On the contrary, 
there is enormous pressure to proceed as aggressively as possible, 
both for the political purpose of satisfying the party's conservative 
base and out of the philosophical belief that fighting on, even to 
almost certain defeat, is the right thing to do. But while virtually 
no one on the right believes Clinton should remain in office, most 
conservatives have quietly, grudgingly given up any real hope that 
he will be ousted. At this point, the revised goal of many conservatives 
is simply to lose with honor. Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative 
Weekly Standard, said his magazine would certainly continue pressing 
Congress to impeach the president _ but then he mocked the improbability 
of his own position. ``Some of us are hanging tough in our obdurate 
blindness to the political reality,'' Kristol said, with a grim laugh. 
``I'm like one of these Japanese soldiers after World War II. It's 
1949 and I'm on some island not knowing the war is over.'' But already, 
he is focused less on the outcome of the fight than the integrity 
of the process, and he seems most concerned that Republicans fulfill 
what he sees as the conservative duty to uphold the rule of law and 
the Constitution. ``The thing I want more than anything is a real 
debate, real consideration of whether he should be impeached,'' Kristol 
said. ``The Congress owes the American people that, even if they don't 
know they're owed that. Even if Clinton slips the noose, I think it's 
important that conservatives not accede to Clintonism as victorious. 
You can't re-litigate Clinton, but you can continue the conversation 
while looking beyond it.'' Kristol said there is a split between conservatives 
who want to go through the motions of impeachment as quickly as possible 
and those who intend to fight to the last, no matter the consequences. 
But even some in that latter group seem a little weary. William Bennett, 
author of ``The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on 
American Ideals'' (Free Press), sounded uncharacteristically humbled 
by the mystery of how it is that most Americans remain relatively 
undisturbed by Clinton's transgressions. ``I may have been wrong,'' 
in thinking that the public would eventually react, or would hold 
future presidential candidates to a higher moral standard as a result 
of the Clinton scandals, said Bennett, who was nursing a bad cold 
and sounded downright dejected. ``I'm not sure enough people care,'' 
he said. ``For the first time in my adult life, I'm not in sync. I 
don't get it. What about all these conferences I've been invited to? 
I mean, values, schmalues. I don't get it.'' Bennett says he still 
believes there is a 50-50 chance that the president will be impeached 
in the House, but trailed off mid-sentence without bothering to finish 
answering a question about what might then happen in the Senate. In 
Congress, the debate is, if anything, still heating up. But the Republican 
strategist Ralph Reed said he and others were already focusing on 
the aftermath of the inevitable failure of congressional Republicans 
to remove Clinton from office. ``They have to make it clear that this 
was a reluctant duty, kind of like settling the estate of a deceased 
parent,'' Reed said. ``You do it, move on and you're fine. You don't 
look like you're enjoying it.'' Ms. Huffington said she and many other 
conservatives felt forced to concede defeat after the special prosecutor 
Kenneth W. Starr ``not only failed to connect the dots of presidential 
abuses but removed two of the major dots, Travelgate and Filegate.'' 
She was speaking of the dismissal of White House travel office employees 
and the improper gathering of FBI files of government officials in 
the White House. She said she hoped that Clinton would be tried for 
perjury after his term expired. Wait. Is there anyone on the right 
who still believes Clinton might be removed from office? ``No,'' Reed 
said without any hesitation. ``Not to my knowledge. We're starting 
to focus our energy and efforts where it belongs and that's with Al 
Gore.'' There is not, of course, universal agreement among conservatives, 
particularly the rank and file, on this point. G. Gordon Liddy, for 
example, says listeners to his radio show seemed almost ready to give 
up but got mad all over again after Clinton responded to questions 
posed by the House Judiciary Committee in terms they saw as legalistic 
hair-splitting. But throughout the conservative movement there are 
indications that many have nonetheless begun to look beyond the current 
efforts to impeach Clinton. A banner headline in a recent issue of 
the conservative newspaper Human Events was ``Think President'' but 
the text didn't concern Clinton at all; It referred to the 2000 elections. 
``The next two years will determine whether the conservative movement 
returns victorious to the pinnacle of power or is once again sent 
into the wilderness.'' the front-page editorial said. ``Everything 
rides on the outcome of the 2000 Presidential elections.'' The editor 
of Human Events, Terence Jeffrey, insisted that good conservatives 
would never give up on impeaching a president who in their view has 
repeatedly flouted the rule of law. But Jeffrey, too, acknowledged 
that ``I don't think there is any realistic chance they'll find the 
votes in the Senate to remove'' him. Susan Carpenter McMillan, a conservative 
activist and sometime spokeswoman for Paula Corbin Jones, whose sexual 
harassment suit against the president brought Clinton's liaison with 
Monica Lewinsky to light, said she had already reconciled herself 
to the likelihood that Clinton would probably be around for two more 
years. She said, ``I've finally just come to accept that this must 
just be God's will that nothing is going to happen to this man.'' 
Even among those conservatives who do not seem to have lost heart 
entirely, there have been at least incremental acknowledgments that 
Clinton may well survive. Speaking specifically about the Travelgate 
and Filegate investigations, the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh 
told one caller to his radio show recently that ``It makes me sad 
to hear you'' clinging to the hope that those matters might still 
bring Clinton down. Limbaugh urged the caller more than once to ``move 
on.'' R. Emmett Tyrrell, editor of the American Spectator and author 
of ``The Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton'' (Regnery), said 
he, for one, was not ready to do that just yet. And even if this particular 
impeachment effort fails, he said, Clinton might yet provide his critics 
with some new material. ``Other scandals could pop up at any moment,'' 
he said hopefully. ``If he gets out of this one, who doubts that in 
six months there could be something else?''
