I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Forecast temperatures today, again, another very mild day in the southeast. 
Back through the southern plains and the mid-atlantic, 60s and 70s 
are anticipated. Cooler weather, though, has snuck in through the 
upper midwest. Some forecast high temperatures into the 30s. We check 
your forecast weather maps for later today on into Thursday. High 
pressure and dry weather expected over much of the eastern half of 
the U.S. there is a weak weather system in the southwest that will 
push towards texas and spread showers. A storm in the pacific northwest 
will continue to spread rain along the coast, both today and on into 
tomorrow. And snow is expected to continue as well in some of the 
higher elevations. A check now of the extended forecast. On Friday, 
we'll find colder temperatures through the northern Rockies, and showers 
and storms through the Mississippi river valley. Wet weather continues 
along the west coast. On Saturday, rain is likely in the pacific northwest, 
with snow back through the dakotas and northern Minnesota and showers 
back through the Great Lakes. On Sunday, again, the potential for 
some rain in the pacific northwest. More showers and storms back through 
much of the plains. For more weather information, log into CNN.com.
