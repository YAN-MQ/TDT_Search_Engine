Cartoons Dare To Mock Icons LOS ANGELES _ The discipline of pop-music 
cartoon strips is a small and sad one, but one of the best has always 
been ``Great Pop Things.'' Running for 10 years in alternative weekly 
newspapers, this pen-and-ink history of rock-and-roll has informed 
readers that Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones ate so much candy 
that ``his entire body rotted away from the teeth downwards,'' Madonna 
``tried to change organized religion'' by ``wearing her underwear 
outside her clothes,'' Bob Dylan's music opened the way for new singer-songwriters 
who ``were usually discovered feeling sorry for themselves on the 
stairs at parties'' and Bono of U2 ``retired from music to make LPs.'' 
For those who don't live in the cities where the comic strip is regularly 
published (Los Angeles and Chicago, mainly), this smart, skewed, pun-filled 
and just plain inaccurate history of rock-and-roll has always been 
out of reach. This month, its best strips have been anthologized for 
the first time in the United States as a book, ``Great Pop Things: 
The Real History of Rock-and-Roll From Elvis to Oasis'' by Verse Chorus 
Press. (In 1992, Penguin in England released a hard-to-find anthology 
that the creators weren't happy with, then retained the rights to 
the comics until last year.) Steve Connell, who runs Verse Chorus 
Press and is a publisher of the music magazine ``Puncture,'' said 
he was attracted to the comic strip by ``the attitude of complete 
irreverence to things that are normally approached with great reverence 
_ phenomena like U2 especially, which begs to be made fun of.'' The 
strip is drawn by Jon Langford (of the 20-year-old rock group the 
Mekons) under the pseudonym Chuck Death. A friend from his hometown 
of Newport, Wales, Colin B. Morton, writes the text. ``Some people 
have a problem with the comic strip,'' Langford said. ``Morrissey 
picked up a copy and threw it across the room and said his chin was 
too big. He was quite angry. But others, especially less popular bands, 
have used the comic as a T-shirt and view being included in it as 
an honor.'' The criteria for being included in ``Great Pop Things'' 
are usually arrogance, a lack of self-awareness and being a pop-culture 
phenomenon, which has made for lots of comics about Morrissey, Madonna 
and U2. Unlike Morrissey, U2 has never responded to the barbed, mocking 
insults the comic has hurled at them. ``That's one of the things that 
gall me,'' Langford said. ``We relentlessly pillory them for being 
one of the most obnoxious and pompous of rock bands. But they've never 
gotten back to us. I'm sure they could break our legs if they wanted 
to.'' The strip originally ran in Record Mirror in England in 1988 
and, according to Langford, his inspiration has never ebbed. ``Just 
when we think we've run out of ideas, David Bowie will say he's going 
to relaunch `Ziggy Stardust,''' he said. ``Or the Sex Pistols will 
reform and we'll go, `Wow, we can get five strips out of that; that's 
like 500 bucks.' There's no bounds to the ridiculousness of pop people.'' 
But does Langford feel hypocritical in making fun of all these popular 
and semipopular musicians when he is one himself? ``They've got more 
money than me, but they're not as good-looking or talented, so I should 
ridicule them,'' he explained, not without sarcasm. ``So it was partially 
inspired out of greed and hatred.'' R-and-B Awards The Rhythm-and-Blues 
Foundation announced the recipients of its annual Pioneer Awards on 
Wednesday. They include Johnny Adams, the New Orleans singer who died 
this year; Garnet Mimms, the leader of the Enchanters whose songs 
have been most famously interpreted by Janis Joplin; Mickey Baker, 
the prolific session guitarist; Brenda Holloway, the Motown singer; 
Dee Dee Warwick, the sister of Dionne; Patti LaBelle and the Bluetones, 
whose original lineup will be reunited at the awards ceremony for 
the first time since 1967; the Manhattans and members of the Drifters. 
In addition, John Lee Hooker, now in his 50th year recording music, 
will receive a lifetime achievement award. The awards ceremony and 
performances will be at Sony Studios here, with Smokey Robinson as 
host, on Feb. 25, a date strategically planned for the day after the 
Grammy Awards. This way, rhythm-and-blues music can borrow some of 
the fanfare from the popular music that has borrowed so much from 
it. Unlike the Grammys, however, recipients of the Pioneer Award receive 
not just recognition and a piece of molded metal but also a fat check: 
$15,000 for individuals, $20,000 for groups. This year, the foundation 
is giving away $260,000, a sum that Janis Hazel, the foundation's 
new executive director, describes as ``an all-time whopper.'' Over 
the last year, she said, the foundation has focused on its education 
project, creating a 26-part radio series on rhythm-and-blues planned 
to run on National Public Radio next year and working on bringing 
music education programs to schools. The foundation has also continued 
its drive to make sure music pioneers with a legacy but little money 
to show for it (thanks chiefly to bad record deals) have what they 
need. It helped pay medical and, ultimately, funeral expenses for 
one of this year's honorees, Adams. The foundation started 10 years 
ago with seed money from Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records, but recently 
it has been forced to get more creative in its search for funds, which 
may be one reason Ronald Perelman, the chairman of Revlon and a rhythm-and-blues 
fan, will be presiding over this year's ceremony. ``The economy has 
shrunk, the music industry is tightening its belt,'' Ms. Hazel said. 
``We need to seriously fund-raise in order to continue with our programs 
so we have been looking at other industries like automobile and major 
appliance manufacturers that use R-and-B in their advertisements.''
