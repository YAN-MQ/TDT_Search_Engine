As the season continues to slip away, National Basketball Association 
players and owners will meet Thursday in Manhattan for the first time 
in 13 days to try to end the five-month-old lockout. ``I think we're 
beyond the part of being frustrated,'' said Michael Curry, a member 
of the union's negotiating committee. Having set an unofficial mid-December 
deadline for striking a deal and having tested the union's resolve 
for the past month _ a period in which more than 200 players did not 
receive two paychecks _ the owners may have a renewed urgency in talking. 
The union is feeling the pressure, too. The union's executive director, 
Billy Hunter, has had his work questioned by Isiah Thomas, a former 
union leader. Phil Jackson said Wednesday he had reservations about 
the players' leadership. ``I'm very concerned about the representation 
on the players side,'' Jackson said from his home in Chicago. ``I've 
talked to some players who are not your $10 million and $20 million 
players _ that do not feel like they have enough power to speak out 
because they don't have the clout.''
