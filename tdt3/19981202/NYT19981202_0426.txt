When they lighted the giant Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center on 
Wednesday evening, they must have been conducting a dry run to see 
if the electrical system worked. It couldn't be anywhere near Christmas. 
Wasn't Memorial Day coming up? It felt that way. For the fifth consecutive 
day Wednesday, the temperature was in the 60s in New York, when it 
ought to have been in the upper 40s. The thermometer reached 64 in 
Central Park, 2 degrees below the record for Dec. 2. The sun was out 
strong. There was nothing more than a balmy breeze. Sure it was December. 
Maybe at the North Pole! The city was an expression of befuddlement. 
While most people were out in light spring jackets or shirt-sleeves, 
there were others who didn't seem to know it was May. They wore ski 
jackets and coats with _ yes _ fur collars, or more precisely, they 
carried their ski jackets and coats and cursed their fur collars. 
It was as if a few buses full of tourists had unexpectedly dropped 
in from Alaska. Who could be sure what to wear? ``It's December _ 
it's supposed to be cold,'' said Solange Bernall, 23, a baby sitter 
walking in Park Slope, Brooklyn, Wednesday afternoon with a 7-year-old. 
``I put my winter stuff on. Then I put it away again. Then I take 
it out. Right now I just feel really hot.'' Weather that made no sense 
with Christmas on the horizon was confusing people throughout the 
nation. Some cities reached record high temperatures that were as 
much as 20 degrees above normal. Forget about skiing anywhere. Tennis 
and golf, if not swimming, were the only suitable activities. The 
persistent toasty weather was making people a little somnolent. In 
at Bryant Park in Manhattan during the lunch hour, there were inanimate 
reindeer and giant red Christmas presents decorating the lawn. Meanwhile, 
people basked in the sun in folding chairs, in their shirtsleeves 
and with their shoes off. It's hard to work on your Christmas shopping 
list _ and forget about buying earmuffs and gloves _ when you're daydreaming 
about the beach. ``Who wants to wait on line at Macy's when you can 
be outside?,'' said Midori Inoue, 30, who was having a cup of coffee 
outside a Brooklyn cafe with her pit bull. ``I'll probably be doing 
a lot of last-minute shopping this year.'' Meteorologists were predicting 
more of the same irregular temperatures for the rest of the week, 
and possibly even a day that creeps into the 70s. The highest temperature 
ever recorded in December in New York was 72 on Dec. 4, 1982. Anyone 
who found this spurt of benign weather bizarre needed only to check 
with someone in Minneapolis. It should be in the 30s there, snow underfoot. 
Tuesday, it was 68, the highest reading on a December day in the city, 
and Wednesday was only slightly cooler. That's bathing suit weather 
in the Midwest. ``It's rather dead in here,'' said Barbara Pierce, 
the owner of the Pierce Skate &AMP; Ski store in Minneapolis. ``It's 
even been warm at night.'' Among the dozens of record highs registered 
Wednesday, it reached 66 in Newark, N.J., and 60 in Bridgeport, Conn. 
It hit 77 in Galveston, Texas, and 74 in Valentine, Neb. It was warmer 
in South Dakota than in New York. In Sioux Falls, the temperature 
was a record 70 degrees. The thermostat has been turned up all year 
across the United States. Through October, this has been the second 
warmest year for the entire nation since record-keeping began in 1895, 
eclipsed only by 1934. In terms of precipitation, this year stands 
second to none, ranking as the wettest year ever, surpassing soggy 
1973. For the Northeast, this has been the warmest year so far, beating 
the record set in 1921. Seven states have been enjoying their warmest 
years on record, including New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. So 
who turned up the heat? Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at the Pennsylvania 
State Weather Communications Group, identified the latest culprit 
as some Pacific winds trapped for the past several weeks over much 
of the country. ``The atmosphere has been locked in a pattern of very 
strong upper-level winds blowing vigorously from the Pacific Ocean 
and directly into the heart of the American continent,'' he said, 
noting that Pacific air is appreciably milder than the cold air that 
comes from Canada. Throughout the year and across the United States, 
this predominance of Pacific air has accounted for the persistent 
mild weather. After reciting the usual caveats about the unpredictability 
of predicting weather, Gadomski mentioned that in another 10 to 15 
days, there might be a different story to tell. ``There are some indications 
in the long-range computer model that there will be a substantial 
shift in the weather pattern that will lead to extremely chilly conditions,'' 
he said. ``The path now from west to east is going to undergo a shift 
where the pattern becomes more north to south.'' In short, temperatures 
in the 30s. Believe it when you feel it. As for winter, Gadomski was 
reluctant to commit himself in a year of zany weather. ``There is 
no strong signal that suggests an unusually cold winter or an unusually 
warm one,'' he said. ``If there is any signal, it's that a bitterly 
cold winter is unlikely because we've had a mild autumn.'' Given the 
mercury level, it is hard to imagine anyone buying coats or earmuffs, 
and retailers indicated that cold weather gear was not having its 
customary winter appeal. Bloomingdale's said that its coat business 
got off to a slow start, but has picked up in the past couple of weeks. 
``I think people are anticipating the weather will get colder,'' Anne 
Keating, a store spokeswoman, said. ``Everyone is waiting for the 
weather to get colder.'' She said that fewer people have been buying 
winter accessories like mufflers, gloves and hats for their own use, 
though they are buying them as gifts, perhaps for friends at the Arctic 
Circle. ``The boot business has been good,'' she said, ``but it's 
been dress boots, not the cold-weather boots.'' Saks Fifth Avenue 
said that items like cashmere wraps and coverings made of pashmina 
(a lightweight blend of silk and cashmere) are selling well at a time 
when normally they would be relegated to stores in resort areas like 
Palm Beach. Saks also is doing a brisk business in fur collars and 
boas that can be attached to light evening jackets to inject opulence 
without making the wearer too hot in this moderate weather. Some New 
Yorkers clearly are finding solace in this second summer. Dr. Mark 
Warfel, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan, said he normally needs to 
get his boat safely into storage by the middle of October before the 
ominous northeasters blow in. ``But we're going on one more sailing 
adventure this weekend,'' he said. ``This is wonderful.'' Victoria 
Capeci, 37, spent a good part of Wednesday at the Prospect Park playground 
with her 2-year-old daughter, Delphine, who was licking a vanilla 
ice cream cone. In December. ``This weather is better for everyone's 
state of mind,'' said Ms. Capeci, who teaches English in the City 
University system. ``My students seem less stressed out now even though 
it's final time.'' On the other hand, William Steel, 40, an elevator 
mechanic having a drink at a bar on the Upper West Side, took umbrage 
at this affront to his seasonal expectations. ``It's not winter anymore,'' 
he said. ``I want the old winter back. It feels like we're in California 
here.'' Some people were downright apocalyptic. ``The ice up in the 
Arctic is melting by the ton every day,'' said Anthony Vitanis, 71, 
a retired steel carrier. ``We're going to see flooding and loss of 
life, mark my words. The outlook as far as I'm concerned is very bleak.'' 
But Linda Fowler, 44, who drives a double-decker tour bus for New 
York Apple Tours, was relishing the interlude. ``I'm a bus driver 
and I don't miss the snow and ice at all,'' she said. ``It's safer 
to drive. I'd love it to stay like this all year round.'' Nonetheless, 
she admitted that the unseasonable weather drained some of the sport 
out of her work. ``I miss seeing the tourists freezing in the upper 
deck,'' she said. ``They sit up there in rain, snow and lightning 
storms.'' Some New Yorkers were stubborn about yielding to the unorthodox 
climate. If it was December, they dressed for December. Vi Gourdet, 
56, was window-shopping on Seventh Avenue in Brooklyn on Wednesday 
in his winter coat and hat. ``It can suddenly get cold, so I don't 
change the clothes I wear,'' he said, looking about as if the temperature 
might drop to zero without warning. ``I've spent Christmas in Alaska 
and Hawaii, very cold and very hot, but either one's OK with me.''
