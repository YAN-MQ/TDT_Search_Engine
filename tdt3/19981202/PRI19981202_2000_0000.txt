This is The World. A co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH, Boston. It's Wednesday, December 2. I'm Lisa Mullins, in 
Boston. Today, when it comes to confronting Saddam Hussein. President 
Clinton seems to be getting a little gun-shy. At this point, I think 
the President is more afraid of the use of American military force 
than Saddam. Also, Serbia's leader cleans house. And a British painter 
applies a touch of red. A dash of green. And a pinch of elephant dung. 
All in the name of art. I'm trying to delve into depths that go a 
lot further than whether or not it's oil paint, or elephant dung, 
or whatever. First, this news. From National Public Radio News, in 
Washington. I'm Cory Flinthoff.
