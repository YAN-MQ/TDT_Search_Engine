Holiday parties can be good for business, but dangerous for your waistline. 
Carolyn O'Neil has some party survival strategies in our "working 
ahead" report. Business as usual during the holiday season can mean 
more invitations than usual to eat, drink and be merry. Ooh, what 
is this? But that doesn't have to mean unwanted weight gain if you 
adopt a Few strategies. You need to figure out how many parties you 
think you might be attending, and where you're going to be going, 
so that you really know that you have some goals in mind to navigate 
the holidays. One party navigation tip -- scope out the food before 
digging in. Be choosy. Fill yourself a plate, and ideally, you should 
go and sit down away from the buffet and enjoy it. Then you know you 
have eaten. And as this tray of colorful roasted and marinated vegetables 
demonstrates, many thoughtful party hosts are offering their guests 
lighter choices. I think that they want a variety -- vegetarian, seafood, 
chicken. And the chef also has a lot of smoked trout and smoked scallops. 
And remember, it's not just what you eat that adds holiday calories. 
What you drink counts, too. So, watch the eggnog, with 324 calories 
per rich, delicious cup. Carolyn O'Neil, CNN, Atlanta.
