aircraft manufacturer boeing has announced it will cut thousands of 
additional jobs from its payroll over the next two years. susan lisovicz 
explains why. an economic head wind is forcing boeing aircraft to 
cut production and slice 48,000 jobs by the year 2000. 28,000 of those 
cuts were previously announced. in total they amount to 20% of its 
workforce. the world's largest commercial aircraftmaker said that 
the economic slowdown in asia is forcing the company to cut production 
of its highly profitable 747 airplane by more than half next year. 
one third of the outstanding orders for 747s were bound for asian 
airlines. boeing now expects many of those will be delayed or canceled. 
the general health of boeing is somewhat critical at this stage. they 
do have a heartbeat and a pulse, but i don't think they can take too 
many laps around the track. i think boeing is still in good shape. 
they've recognized the problem. they've adjusted to it. i think the 
bigger issue is long term because the 747 which is the bulk of their 
production cuts in the future is their most profitable aircraft. but 
overall i think boeing is well positioned into the future. adding 
to the aircraftmakers' woes -- recently boeing said that it would 
take a huge charge against future earnings to pay for development 
cost of its next generation 737 -- the world's most popular commercial 
aircraft. the upshot of the job cuts and slowdown in 747 production 
-- boeing is cutting earnings forecasts by $500 million for next year.
