American forces still serving as peacekeepers in Bosnia scored a big 
victory today. They arrested Serb general radislav krstic, the highest-ranking 
Serb military officer to be taken into custody on war crimes charges. 
He's accused of genocide and crimes against humanity for the 1995 
massacre of Bosnian Muslims in the town of srebrenica, which was supposed 
to be a U.N. safe haven. He'll now face the war crimes tribunal in 
the Hague.
