K2 SKIS, $565-$795 K2 Skis introduced the first piezo-enhanced sports 
product in November 1995 and has expanded its piezo-enhanced lineup 
to approximately one-third of its products. K2 BIKE, MOUNTAIN BICYCLES, 
$800-$4,000 First released in October 1997, the K2 mountain bicycle 
``smart shock'' uses the piezoceramic module somewhat differently 
than other piezo sports products. Instead of converting mechanical 
impulses to electrical impulses and dissipating the energy, the shock 
uses an electronic sensor to monitor the need for ``harder'' or ``softer'' 
shocks. The sensor signals the piezoceramic, which then lets more 
or less oil through the shock mechanism. This year's models use a 
Motorola microprocessor within the shock. K2 SNOWBOARD, $500 The Electra, 
released in June 1997, uses two piezoelectric vibration dampers, one 
on each edge of the board between the foot and the tip of the board. 
Advanced Control Experts says tests show an 80 percent drop in destabilizing 
vibrations. WORTH INC., COPPERHEAD ACX BASEBALL BAT, $279-$299 The 
company says the Copperhead ACX, released in May, reduces vibrations 
_ and the sting that accompanies them _ by 50 percent to 70 percent. 
The ACX piezoelectric module is embedded in the handle. It enlarges 
the spot where the batter will achieve maximum speed on the ball, 
so batters hit better with less sting. O'BRIEN INTERNATIONAL WATER 
SKIS, $589 and $539 Tested by Andy Mapple, a champion water skier, 
in this year's World Cup Championship, O'Brien's piezo water skis 
came out in September. They reduce ``chatter,'' for better turns and 
control.
