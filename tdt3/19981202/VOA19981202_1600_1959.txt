Here in Washington, President Clinton has met with Pakistan's Prime 
Minister Nawar Sharif for talks aimed at repairing bilateral ties 
that were frayed by Islamabad's nuclear tests earlier this year. VOA's 
Debra Tate reports from the White House. Mr. Clinton wants India and 
Pakistan, which each conducted nuclear tests last May, to sign the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as they have indicated they would do. 
At the start of his meeting with Mr. Sharif, Mr. Clinton said nonproliferation 
would be a key topic of discussion. All of you know my concern to 
do everything we can to end the nuclear competition in South Asia 
which I believe is a threat to Pakistan and India and to the stability 
of the world. Mr. Clinton also said he and Mr. Sharif would try to 
resolve a dispute over a canceled sale of U.S. fighter aircraft. U.S. 
officials say they are working on a plan to return some of the $658 
million Pakistan paid for U.S. made F-16 jets that Islamabad never 
received. The delivery was blocked under a 1990 law barring direct 
U.S. military sales to Pakistan because of its development of nuclear 
weapons. Debra Tate, VOA News at the White House.
