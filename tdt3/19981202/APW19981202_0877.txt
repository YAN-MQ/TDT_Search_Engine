The Trinidadian government and sportsmen's associations are warning 
hunters in Trinidad's dense northern rain forest to beware of mosquitoes 
carrying deadly yellow fever. The disease, legendary for its devastating 
attacks on the builders of the Panama Canal, has been reported on 
the rise in Venezuela, just seven miles from Trinidad. The virus can 
cause high fever, jaundice and death. It is spread by the forest-dwelling 
hemagoggus mosquito. Howler monkeys that live in the forest are immune 
to the virus and are carriers of the disease. ``The forests are full 
of howlers and really full of mosquitoes right now, so we are warning 
everyone of the dangers,'' said Mohan Bholasingh, president of Trinidad's 
Southeastern Hunters Association. ``The Ministry of Health is on an 
active drive to get all hunters inoculated.'' Vaccinations are free 
in Trinidad and are good for about 10 years. Most children in Trinidad 
are vaccinated after their first birthday. The Trinidad &AMP; Tobago 
hunting season runs from October 1 through the end of February.
