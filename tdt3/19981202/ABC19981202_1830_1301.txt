Not many would think of guns as a product for children, although many 
parents do encourage their kids to learn how to handle them safely. 
Still, there are questions tonight about gunmakers and their campaign 
that sells to children. Here is ABC's Deborah Amos. The acorns junior 
rifle club trains on guns they are still too young to buy. Legally, 
they are under my dad's name. The two guns that I own. And dad is 
the coach here at the national rifle association range. This 13-year-old 
marksman says gun catalogs to keep up. They show pictures of people 
shooting. And they make it sound interesting. There is a tradition 
in many parts of the country of fathers teaching children to shoot, 
but anti-gun activists say something new is going on here. With gun 
manufacturing in a slump, they say for the first time, gun manufacturers, 
lobbying groups and gun magazines are marketing a gun culture to kids 
so they'll buy firearms when they are adults, a charge that may be 
tested in court. Specifically, they point to these images in gun catalogs. 
Semiautomatic handguns competitions for juniors. This video promoted 
by a sports shooting group. Youth magazines and shooting clubs of 
the NRA. If it was any other product, alcohol or tobacco, and we saw 
the exact same type of efforts being made, people would be shocked, 
but because it's guns, people somehow think it's different. But gun 
enthusiasts say, getting kids interested in the shooting sports is 
nothing new. There isn't a recreation industry in this country, be 
it bowling or tennis or golf who doesn't have to look ahead, who are 
the customers of our future. Adult males are the traditional customers, 
but that market is saturated. Gun sales to women never took off. In 
many ways, it's just like the tobacco industry needs replacement smokers, 
the gun industry needs replacement shooters. So sport shooting is 
a battleground for activists because national studies show that if 
you don't buy a gun by the time you're 21, you probably won't buy 
one at all. These people are attacking boy scout shooting programs, 
4-H shooting programs, NRA safety programs. I mean, my gosh, get a 
life. And both sides are after the same target -- kids. Deborah Amos, 
ABC News, New York.
