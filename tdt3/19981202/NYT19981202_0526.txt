It's appropriate, somehow, that anyone calling himself a skiing weatherman 
might also ski. Isn't it easier for skiers and boarders facing wet 
snow or ice to know that their meteorologist might also be boot-deep 
in slush or skidding on boilerplate? Such is the psychic fallout affecting 
Herb Stevens, the television weatherman who disseminates a weekly 
forecast of 1 minute 25 seconds on 30 stations from Florida to Maine. 
He has an opinion on all weather subjects, especially if the subject 
is as debatable as La Nina. ``I give skiers a look into the future 
of weather, rather than telling them what the weather is on any one 
day,'' Stevens said from his office in North Kingstown, R.I. ``That's 
particularly true of ski conditions in the East, where weather changes 
so rapidly. In Colorado, once the snow surface is established, it 
stays fairly similar except for occasional dumps of new snow. But 
in the East, we can undergo three surface changes in 24 hours.'' Stevens 
has deduced that La Nina _ El Nino is the warming phenomenon in the 
equatorial Pacific Ocean that affects the climate around the globe, 
and La Nina is its associated cooling phase _ will bring more cold 
air and snow than usual to the Northeast this winter, despite the 
region's recent stretch of warm weather. ``It will be with us throughout 
the winter and into the spring,'' he predicted. ``Whereas the southern 
portion of the jet stream was more active and powerful last year, 
the opposite is apt to prevail this year.'' Ski areas within the shadow 
of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain are likely to receive snow from 
cold air masses sweeping over the lakes from Canada, he added. Benefiting 
will be areas in Northern Vermont especially, such as Smugglers' Notch, 
Jay Peak, Sugarbush and Mad River Glen. The lake effect could be felt 
as far south as New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, Stevens 
said. Indeed, areas such as Smugglers' Notch had a record snowfall 
during the last La Nina period, which came during the 1995-96 ski 
season. ``If you have a meltdown, you can make up for it,'' said Barbara 
Thomke, a spokeswoman for Smugglers' Notch. Last winter, however, 
the cold spells did not last long enough for many ski areas to recoup 
their losses from warm spells. Smugglers', for example, had 219 inches 
of snowfall last season compared with 334 inches in 1995-96. Resorts 
able to make snow will benefit not only from natural accumulations, 
but also from the ability to make snow and count on it lasting through 
occasional thaws. Ski areas more to the east, such as those in Maine, 
New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Southeastern New York, 
according to Stevens, are outside the lake effect band. But they are 
still apt to have a better-than-average winter. Areas in the Catskills, 
such as Hunter Mountain, were open in early November this year during 
a mid-autumn cold spell. But then they had to close and reopen. The 
West will experience a different La Nina effect, Stevens said. The 
southern Rockies are likely to see a drier and milder winter than 
they had last season with the huge dumps of snow brought on by El 
Nino. But in the northern climes, the opposite is predicted. ``I'd 
say stay north of Interstate 70,'' Stevens said, referring to the 
highway that cuts through the Rocky Mountains outside of Denver. Cliff 
Harris, a climatologist in Jericho, Vt., sees a similar picture. ``La 
Nina takes what is normal and enhances the pattern,'' he said. ``But 
during the El Nino periods, which the country is just pulling out 
of, the opposite was true. Dry areas turned wetter, wet areas turned 
drier, and normally cold areas turn warmer.'' He added: ``Last year, 
we had a relatively snowless winter in the Northeast. El Nino was 
holding all that cold weather at bay. In Northern New England, we 
had flooding and the worst ice storm in history. But here in Vermont, 
things are fairly normal right now. I don't expect the really harsh, 
cold stuff, the main body of the serpent, to come in at least until 
the end of December.'' As for keeping tabs on snow levels, Stevens 
suggests that skiers and snowboarders pay attention to general lists 
as well as rely on individual ski areas for reports. ``Ski areas are 
more accountable now than they used to be,'' he said. ``I can say 
that because I'm a meteorologist, and I know whether they get snow 
or not.''
