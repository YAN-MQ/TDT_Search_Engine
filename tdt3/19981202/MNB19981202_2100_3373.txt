Mike T: the wealthiest man in the world today gave away a small portion 
of his sizable personal wealth, something he's vowed to do more of 
as he grows older. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and his wife Melinda 
announced they will give away more than $100 million to help immune

is a part owner of MSNBC.
