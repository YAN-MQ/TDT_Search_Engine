Substitute Suat Kaya headed in the equalizer in injury time Wednesday 
to lift Turkey's Galatasaray into a 1-1 draw with Italy's Juventus 
in a politically tinged Champions League match that came off without 
a hitch. The clubs' countries are locked in a dispute over the fate 
of Abdullah Ocalan, a Kurdish rebel leader arrested in Rome who has 
asked for political asylum. Fears the tensions might spill onto the 
soccer field resulted in postponement of the game for a week and extra 
security measures Wednesday. Kaya's goal, from steps away off a free 
kick, ended a late flurry of offense from Galatasaray after Juventus 
had taken a 1-0 lead with 12 minutes to go on Nicola Amoruso's goal. 
Amoruso, who entered the game in the 66th minute, fired French playmaker 
Zinedine Zidane's lobbed cross from the left flank between Galatasaray's 
Brazilian 'keeper Claudio Taffarel and the near post. The goal silenced 
the crowd of 23,000, barely outnumbering the police officers present 
at Ali Sami Yen Stadium. Officers in riot gear escorted the players 
and officials off the field after the final whistle. Authorities had 
also said they worried about a provocation by the rebels from the 
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, aimed at staining Turkey's image. 
Such concerns led European soccer's governing body, UEFA, to put off 
the match, originally slated for last Wednesday. But while obscenities 
directed at Juve's players and chants of ``Down with PKK! Down with 
Italy!'' echoed through the stadium, there was no real unruliness, 
much less violence. Juventus was to leave Istanbul immediately after 
the game. The club flew in just hours before the match, in defiance 
of UEFA rules requiring clubs to arrive the day before a game.
