This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Thursday. We continue to see mild, quiet weather in 
the southeastern part of the country. A couple of cold fronts will 
bring slightly cooler temperatures to the northeast and the upper 
midwest. Out across the west, it remains unsettled -- rain, mountain 
snow and windy conditions. There could be a few showers or storms 
through the south plains with an area of low pressure, as well. Thursday's 
high temperatures -- 30s and 40s in the northwest and northeast. But 
from southern New England to the southwest, 50s or better, the forecast 
highs. We look ahead to Friday. Remember, it'll be cool in the northwest, 
but still mild in the southeast with showers and snow across the west 
and also some thunderstorms over the middle Mississippi river valley. 
On Saturday, rain or snow stretch from the northwest to the Great 
Lakes. Sunday, still cool in the northwest, mild in the southeast, 
with rain stretching from the northwest to the northeast and down 
through the mississippi river valley. Could be some snow in the upper 
midwest. Don't forget -- four-day forecasts, CNN.com.
