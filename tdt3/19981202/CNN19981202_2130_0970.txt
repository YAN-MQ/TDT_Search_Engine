One of the biggest blue-chip losers was Boeing. It says the Asian 
economic crisis is forcing it to slice its workforce and scale back 
production. The company plans to eliminate 48,000 jobs over the next 
two years. The company says half the job losses will come through 
retirement, voluntary resignations and other attrition. Up to 90% 
of the cuts will be in the commercial sector. An industry analyst 
says as the people go, so will the value of the company. I think what 
we have is Asian flu, and bad management is lethal for workers and 
investors. 38,000 employees are going to go, and my guess is $8 billion 
to $10 billion worth of shareholder value will be destroyed in the 
next couple of weeks.
