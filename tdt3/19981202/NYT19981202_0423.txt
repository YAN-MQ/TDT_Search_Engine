Saying that it could not be certain of the risk to babies from a material 
found in vinyl that causes cancer in rats, the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission advised parents Wednesday to throw away nipples and pacifiers 
made of vinyl and asked manufacturers to stop using it in objects 
that children put into their mouths. But because laboratory tests 
cannot measure how much of the chemicals babies are likely to ingest 
when they chew on vinyl objects, officials said they did not have 
enough evidence to try to ban the material. They were not even sure 
how long a baby typically chews on a pacifier or toy, they said. The 
chemical, called DINP, turns vinyl from a hard plastic suitable for 
products like water pipes into the soft plastic used for children's 
toys. In the mid-1980s the commission urged toy manufacturers to switch 
to DINP from DEHP, another kind of softener, because lab studies found 
that DEHP caused cancer and other maladies in rats and mice; more 
recently, DINP has been shown to have similar effects. Industry scientists 
say both materials are safe. In a study released Wednesday, the safety 
commission said that ``few, if any, children are at risk from liver 
or other organ toxicity.'' Ronald Medford, the commission's assistant 
executive director, said more work was needed, including a review 
by an expert panel and a study to ``get a better handle on length 
of time kids mouth the stuff.'' Medford said his agency had begun 
in October to ask manufacturers to stop using the material, and nearly 
all have done so, at least for objects intended to go in the mouth, 
like teethers, rattles and nipples. Nearly all are now made of other 
materials, like latex. But some Gerber Clear and Soft pacifiers and 
nipples still on the market are made of vinyl, he said.
