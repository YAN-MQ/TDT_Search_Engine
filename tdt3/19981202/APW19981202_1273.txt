Police on Thursday announced they were looking for a 43-year-old man 
suspected of masterminding Australia's biggest terrorist campaign, 
the mailing of at least 25 letter bombs to tax officials. Australian 
Tax Office staff nationwide were put on alert Wednesday after more 
than 20 explosive parcels were found addressed to present and former 
tax office staff. The alert was issued after an early morning letter 
bomb explosion Wednessday at a Canberra mail center slightly injured 
two postal workers who were hit by bits of plastic shrapnel. Another 
21 explosive parcels were found at the mail center, while at least 
two more of the potentially lethal devices had been found posted to 
homes in Sydney, and one in Melbourne. The man sought by police was 
believed to be driving a blue 1985 Toyota Corona sedan with Canberra 
license plates. Police issued a statement: ``Concerns are held for 
the well being of the occupant and safety of the public and it is 
important that the vehicle be located as soon as possible.'' Police 
were concerned more letter bombs could still be on their way to past 
and present tax officials, sent by what they believe to be a disgruntled, 
disturbed person. Police were investigating a common link between 
all addressees. Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said the vast bulk 
of the letter bombs were directed at present or former tax office 
staff. Sources close to the investigation said the matter related 
to a personal dispute. The ATO has taken steps to protect its employees 
and a national memo to its 17,000 staff warned: ``Please ensure that 
your families and others likely to open your mail are informed immediately.'' 
The bombs are in white parcels about the size of a five computer-disk 
package. The bombs are designed to explode when opened, although the 
device which exploded at the Canberra Mail Center went off when it 
was thrown into a sorting basket, slightly injuring the workers.
