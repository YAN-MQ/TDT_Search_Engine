James Dalton is hopeful of playing in an unchanged South African team 
against England on Saturday as the Springboks bid to make it a world 
record 18 wins in a row. The experienced hooker limped out of the 
record-tying victory over Ireland with a hamstring problem on Saturday, 
when South Africa triumphed 27-13 to match New Zealand's total of 
17 wins in a row, set between 1965-69. ``I will be guided by medical 
advice on James Dalton,'' said Springboks coach Nick Mallett, whose 
team was last beaten in August last year by New Zealand. ``At the 
moment, he looks like being fit, but if he is not 100 percent then 
he won't play. ''Keeping an unchanged team is one of the big reasons 
for our success.'' England stand-off Paul Grayson has failed to recover 
from a knee injury and will miss Saturday's match before 75,000 fans 
at Twickenham. Grayson, who limped off during last weekend's 12-11 
defeat to Australia, will be replaced by Mike Catt. But England coach 
Clive Woodward said Wednesday that Catt will not assume Grayson's 
goal-kicking duties. Catt failed to convert the only try against Australia, 
allowing the Wallabies to pull out a late victory. Instead, Matt Dawson 
will do the goal-kicking Saturday. Nick Beal comes in at fullback 
for Matt Perry, who suffered a concussion against the Wallabies and 
will be sidelined for three weeks. Woodward also brought in Dan Luger 
at the expense of out-of-form Austin Healey. Will Greenwood, like 
Grayson, has not recovered from a recent groin injury and is out. 
That means Phil de Glanville will continue in the center. Lineups:
