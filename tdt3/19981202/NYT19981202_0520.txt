When Roger Clemens was a free agent two years ago, he shunned two 
teams that had been and would continue to be legitimate contenders, 
the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians. Now, after winning 
his fourth and unprecedented fifth Cy Young awards but no championships 
with the Toronto Blue Jays, Clemens wants to be traded to a contender. 
The pitcher made that request Wednesday through his agent, and the 
Blue Jays, adhering to a verbal commitment made two years ago, said 
they would comply. Gord Ash, the team's general manager, said he wanted 
to move as quickly as possible, in the next week to 10 days. ''I'd 
say I'm on a fast track with this,'' Ash said by telephone from Toronto. 
``There are so many other things going on with free agents and other 
deals, we need to have this clarified before we move on.'' After speaking 
with Clemens' agent, Randy Hendricks, Ash wasted no time. He immediately 
contacted the Yankees, Cleveland, Texas and Houston, teams, he said, 
that had shown the strongest interest dating to last July. He said 
he expected to talk to other teams as soon as the news spread. Ash 
said that Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, told him he 
would have to talk to George Steinbrenner and would get back to him. 
``They were very interested at the trade deadline, so one could assume 
they still are,'' Ash said. The Indians, Rangers and Astros, he added, 
all said they were very interested and would be in touch with him. 
``We'll be looking for players who could help us at the major league 
level now,'' Ash said. ``Prospects aren't going to work. We're going 
to need at least some pitching back, but I want to be open minded 
about this. I don't want to predetermine what it will take. I want 
to see what the offers are.'' Given that the Rangers, Astros and Indians 
all have been seeking pitching to bolster their staffs, the Yankees 
would seem to be in the best position to include a starting pitcher 
because they have six. But would the Blue Jays really trade Clemens 
to a team in their division? ``We've debated that,'' Ash said. ``I 
don't see that as a roadblock. What we have to concentrate on is getting 
the best possible deal. If that presents itself from within the division, 
that would be unusual, but you have to do what you have to do both 
short and long term.'' Clemens has two years left on the contract 
he signed in January 1997, after Paul Beeston, then the club's president, 
convinced him the Blue Jays would be a contender. Clemens, whom the 
Boston Red Sox let leave as a free agent because they viewed him as 
an aging pitcher, accepted the Toronto offer because he felt the environment 
there would be best for his family.
