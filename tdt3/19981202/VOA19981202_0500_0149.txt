The separatist Kosovo Liberation Army says that it's willing to accept 
something less than independence as a temporary measure for ending 
the conflict in the Serbian province. KLA political representative 
Addem Damachi said Tuesday ethnic Albanian guerrillas would agree 
to Kosovo temporarily becoming a republic within Yugoslavia equal 
to Serbia or Montenegro. He says such a political settlement must 
include international guarantees for independence after three years.
