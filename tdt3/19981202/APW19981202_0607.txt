Russian leaders met today with the head of the International Monetary 
Fund, who gave no sign he was prepared to release the frozen loans 
the country so badly needs. Michel Camdessus met for a second day 
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and praised Russia's ``pragmatic'' 
course in dealing with the country's economic crisis. But he said 
an IMF team would have to return to Russia next month for further 
negotiations on the loan installments. ``We are hoping 1999 will be 
excellent for cooperation between Russia and the IMF,'' Camdessus 
said. The stakes are high: Russia owes billions of dollars to workers, 
pensioners and foreign creditors and wants the IMF to provide new 
installments on a $22.6 billion bailout package. The loans were negotiated 
this summer, but have been on hold since the latest economic crisis 
hit in August. The IMF has been demanding a realistic recovery plan 
from the Russian government and has so far been unimpressed with Moscow's 
efforts. Primakov sought to lower expectations even before today's 
talks began. ``Don't measure the significance of Camdessus' visit 
by how much money he brought,'' Primakov said. ``He has come with 
an attache case containing documents, not cash. You shouldn't think 
that the question of giving money to Russia will be solved now.'' 
Speaking to reporters after the talks, the Russian prime minister 
said Russia expected advice, not money, from Camdessus. ``We haven't 
considered specific credits, the size and timing of their release,'' 
Primakov said. ``It was important for us that the fund chief come 
to Moscow and analyze and assess the situation.'' The IMF put the 
loan installments on hold after Russia's government devalued the ruble 
and defaulted on some of its debts in August. Primakov's government 
has moved cautiously, refraining from any radical measures and hoping 
the IMF and other lenders will offer help. The government delayed 
a debate this week on next year's budget as it struggles to find ways 
to come up with enough money to meet expenses. While the Cabinet insisted 
the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit, Russian media have 
suggested the government put off action on the budget because it still 
holds out hope for receiving IMF money. The latest budget draft assumes 
Russia will receive the IMF loan. If the Russian government doesn't 
receive foreign help soon, it will be forced to start printing money, 
which would drive up inflation and further imperil Russia's fragile 
economy, Primakov and other officials have warned. An IMF mission 
left town last week saying the government's revenue forecast for next 
year was overly optimistic. It also disapproved of the government's 
intention to lower taxes, offer subsidies to ailing industries and 
increase state regulation of the economy. Primakov played down the 
differences today, saying he and Camdessus agreed some state intervention 
in the economy may be positive, provided it doesn't prevent the development 
of a free-market. ``We will find a common approach, probably not immediately, 
but we will,'' Primakov said. Russia has so far received only about 
$5 billion of the bailout package, which also involves the World Bank 
and the Japanese government. Meanwhile, Central Bank chairman Viktor 
Geraschenko outlined the country's economic woes in an address today 
to parliament's upper house, the Federation Council. Russia's economy 
has shrunk 5 percent to 6 percent compared to a year ago and inflation 
is up an estimated 70 percent compared to last December, he said. 
The government hopes to limit inflation to 30 percent next year, he 
said.
