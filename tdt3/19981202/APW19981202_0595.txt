Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday began debating the 1999 budget draft 
amid the government's warnings that most of the fiscal targets set 
by lawmakers would be impossible to meet. The document, prepared by 
parliament's budget committee, provided for a zero deficit and sharply 
raised the federal government's projected revenues and expenditures 
to nearly 50 percent more than the Cabinet had proposed. The revenues 
and expenditures were set at 35.1 billion hryvna (dlrs 10.2 billion). 
``Ukraine can produce a financial sensation by approving a deficit-free 
budget,'' parliament's budget committee chief Julia Tymoshenko told 
lawmakers. Deputies are to continue debating the 1999 budget Thursday, 
with the vote on its first reading expected this week. However, Cabinet 
officials already have objected to the proposed document, an amended 
version of the budget draft the government had submitted, and said 
its primary figures had to be revised. ``The proposed revenues and 
expenditures are not realistic, and we have doubts the economy would 
be able to live with (a budget like this),'' Finance Minister Ihor 
Mitiukov said. The government originally planned to raise 23.1 billion 
hryvna (dlrs 6.74 billion) in budget revenues next year, allowing 
a deficit of no more than 700 million hryvna (dlrs 204 million) or 
0.6 percent of projected gross domestic product. The figures were 
calculated to reflect the beleaguered state of government finances. 
Budget revenues in the first nine months of 1998 were just 50.8 percent 
of the annual target, while companies' tax debt skyrocketed to 9.2 
billion hryvna (dlrs 2.68 billion) as of Nov. 1, according to Cabinet 
figures. The government also forecast that the economy, which showed 
signs of growth in the first half of 1998, would shrink again by 1.5 
percent in 1998 largely because of the economic crisis in neighboring 
Russia, Ukraine's main trade partner. But lawmakers who had examined 
the Cabinet's draft for two weeks before Wednesday's debate said the 
government overlooked many opportunities for raising extra revenues. 
Tymoshenko said extra money could be raised by taxing commercial banks, 
raising rent for the land used for oil and gas extraction, and pushing 
enterprises to repay loans received under government guarantees. She 
said revenues could also come from more unorthodox sources, such as 
payment for using Ukraine's air space. Tymoshenko said these and other 
suggestions the lawmakers came up with would allow the government 
to pay off many of its debts, including billions of dollars worth 
of overdue wages, pensions and other social payments.
