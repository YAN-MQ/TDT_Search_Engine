You're listening to the Voice of America, VOA News Now coming to you 
from Washington. I'm Paul Westpheling, along with Charlene Porter. 
Have you talked about your child's health today? All parents want 
the best for their babies, and the best begins with good food. For 
young infants, breast milk alone is the best food until a baby is 
four or five months old. Then you can begin to add solid food. As 
girls and boys grow, they need a diet filled with a variety of green 
and orange colored vegetables, fruits, tubers, rice, bread, and beans, 
or other legumes. Find out from a health worker about the best foods 
to feed growing children. Your child's health is your family's future. 
1018 universal time.
