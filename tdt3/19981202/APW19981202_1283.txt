The drive to rid sports of drugs should not keep athletes who abide 
by the rules from getting the money they need to train and compete, 
the president of the U.S. Olympic Committee said Wednesday. To make 
sure both goals were met, the USOC could contribute some of its own 
money while rounding up funds from government and private sources, 
including ``ethical pharmaceutical companies,'' committee chief Bill 
Hybl said. He also said in an interview that the fight against drugs 
had become a ``watershed event'' for the Olympic community worldwide. 
The International Olympic Committee is considering a worldwide crackdown 
on doping that would include a dlrs 25 million research program for 
preventing and detecting drug use. Dick Pound, an IOC vice president 
from Canada and head of the commission to find a way to pay for the 
anti-drug program, has said the money probably would come from the 
IOC's share of multibillion-dollar television rights fees, which generally 
is redistributed to athletes through national Olympic committees and 
IOC training programs. Although the USOC does not share in that redistribution, 
Hybl, a member of Pound's panel, said he feared that such a financing 
plan for the drug program would cut into sports development as an 
``infringement on television revenues that accrue to athletes for 
training and support.'' Stressing that the anti-drug fight was among 
the most important Olympic issues, Hybl said alternative revenue sources 
should be tapped, such as the dlrs 1 million pledged last week by 
the White House for drug research. Similar grants could come from 
the Department of Health and Human Services as part of public health 
programs, and ``ethical pharmaceutical companies will certainly be 
asked to participate,'' Hybl said. ``They have the finest research 
labs in the world,'' the USOC official said. ``They have firsthand 
knowledge through development research. And they have the financial 
ability to be very helpful to the USOC and its athletes.'' Hybl also 
said the USOC might be willing to put part of its dlrs 11.3 million 
anti-drug budget toward the IOC research. He said the committee was 
looking for an ``active role'' in the international program. The USOC's 
executive committee will hear from Pound and other Olympic and government 
officials at a special meeting in Chicago on Jan. 9.
