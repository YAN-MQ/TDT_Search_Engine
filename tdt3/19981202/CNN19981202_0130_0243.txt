the 1996 clinton campaign is disputing an fec report on how it used 
campaign money. federal election commission auditors say they found 
massive spending violations by the clinton and dole campaigns. they 
recommend the clinton campaign repay $7 million to taxpayers. they 
say the clinton campaign and that of republican presidential nominee 
bob dole illegally coordinated and benefitted from issue ads run by 
their political parties. the auditors recommend the dole campaign 
give back almost $18 million. dole's representatives have not commented. 
the recommendations are to be reviewed thursday by the full bipartisan 
commission. it can uphold, adjust or throw them out altogether.
