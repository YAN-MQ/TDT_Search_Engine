Well, it seems that British men get all stressed out shopping for 
Christmas and year-end holidays. The latest study sponsored by a North 
London shopping center compares their stress levels to fighter pilots 
or policemen in danger. Our London correspondent and shopping expert, 
Laurie Kassman, has more on this disturbing news. Lots of women complain 
how little their husbands help with the holiday shopping. Now a new 
study in Britain says it could be because it makes them sick. Their 
heart rate went up. Their blood pressure soared. They were producing 
a lot of hormones which related to the stress response. Psychologist 
David Lewis conducted a survey of three dozen male shoppers for a 
North London shopping center to see how they reacted to all the hustle 
and bustle at holiday time. Indeed in some cases, we were finding 
levels of stress that you might perhaps find in a combat pilot flying 
into action or even a riot police officer dealing with an angry mob. 
So they did become for a short time very, very stressed out by the 
shopping experience. The men in the survey complained most about the 
noise and the crowds and the delays at the checkout counter. They 
grew short tempered and fidgety. They wanted to get in, do the job, 
and get out again as quickly as possible. The shopping center that 
commissioned the survey has used the findings to offer new services 
to ease shoppers' stress. There's now a bag carrying service and a 
creche, a day care center for children. But Mr. Lewis says some malls 
have gone a step further. There is a shopping mall in the south of 
England that have actually opened a creche for men, for a father and 
son creche where the fathers can go and read magazines and play computer 
games and watch television while the woman does the shopping. Mr. 
Lewis says men actually do enjoy some shopping. I think men are fine 
when they're shopping for toys for the boys if you send them out to 
buy a Lear jet or a six-pack or a video or computer or something like 
that. They love it. Women in the survey say the best way to deal with 
their own shopping stress is simply to leave the men and children 
at home. Laurie Kassman, VOA News, London.
