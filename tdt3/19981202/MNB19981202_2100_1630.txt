In the meantime, I enjoy the weather in the pacific northwest. Seeing 
snow in the mountains and parts of heavy rain in Washington, Oregon, 
and northern California. Even in the southwest, around Phoenix is 
getting snow. Into parts of New Mexico. The rest of the country, incredibly 
mild. 57 degrees here in New York City right now. And that's what 
it's been like all day today. Record-high temperatures near Newark 
and Hartford, Connecticut. It's 56 right now in Phoenix! The Omega 
block is stalling out the jet stream. That's why we've seen such mild 
weather. On top of that, cold air is banked up north of the jet stream. 
Whev an unusual presence of the bermuda high that's pushing southwesterly 
winds into the northeast. This pattern is going to continue for the 
rest of this week. As you can see, overnight lows in the east, mainly 
40's and 50's. The coldest air banked up over the Rockies and the 
valleys. For highs tomorrow, parts of Montana and Idaho, and extreme 
northern Maine in the 30's. The rest of the country not bad. Look 
how far the 60's go. Up to Denver, Chicago, Dallas, 68. 67 in D.C. 
more rain expected in Seattle tomorrow. That's the weather around 
the nation. Brian now back to you.
