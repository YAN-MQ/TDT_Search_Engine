Zali Steggall's summer was hectic, crammed with media requests and 
personal appearances. She treasured every moment. ``I was definitely 
Australia's sweetheart for a while,'' Steggall said after claiming 
a bronze medal in the slalom in the Winter Olympics at Nagano, Japan. 
It was Australia's first Olympic Alpine medal. ``It was amazingly 
big, which was fun,'' she said. ``Australia is used to getting a lot 
of medals in the summer Olympics and the public gets quite picky and 
only expects golds. ``When it came to the Winter Olympics, I think 
Australia got behind the fact that all of a sudden they had a medal 
in such a traditional winter sport as skiing, which we've been in 
for decades but hadn't come close yet.'' Steggall was thrilled with 
the reception. ``I got a nice response,'' she said. ``I live in Manley, 
a beach suburb of Sydney, and to have people come up to you and say 
congratulations at the beach is fun. ``It made it busier, but also 
more interesting. When you've been struggling for six, seven years 
to get to the top and you finally do, and with it comes more attention 
and more things to do and more responsibilities, I always had looked 
forward to that. So in many ways I enjoyed being busier. If you get 
to the top, get great results, then have complete anonymity, it's 
a bit sad. ``It's tough when you get to something like an Olympics 
where there's so much pressure, and on top of that we only had, I 
think, 23 athletes from Australia and only about three people with 
a chance of a token result. So it means the whole team, the media, 
the coaches, everybody is looking at you and counting on you. That 
means added pressure. ``And ski racing is the kind of sport where 
you can't guarantee you're going to cross the finish line. I remember 
the world championships the year before, I had only one race and I 
fell in the first run, before I even got to the intermediate. That 
showed me the other end of the spectrum, of how bad it can feel.'' 
The Olympic medal wasn't a fluke for Steggall, who won the season-opening 
race at Park City, Utah, and followed with three other top-10 placings 
on the way to a final slalom standing of ninth. ``I was happy with 
my whole season last year,'' she said. ``There were a few up-and-down 
races, but on the whole it was a very satisfying year.'' She opened 
this season with a solid seventh at Park City, a result that showed 
her she's still among the best in the world and capable of winning 
races. She has another opportunity Thursday in a slalom at this resort 
in the Sierras. Steggall spent 10 years in France as a youngster, 
growing up racing in the French development system. She left France 
in 1989 and struggled for years to maintain her enthusiasm while Australia 
put together an Alpine program from scratch to support her. ``It meant 
that I had to dig deep to keep motivated, to keep coming back every 
year,'' she said. ``I always felt that given the right circumstances 
and support I could do it, and I guess I showed it last year.'' There's 
another Olympic-sized goal this season, the world championships at 
Vail, Colorado beginning Jan. 31. She'll use the same strategy as 
she did for Nagano, taking a week off to go home and recharge her 
batteries. ``It's difficult to go home, though, because it's so much 
of a change,'' Steggall said. ``You're going from altitude to sea 
level, you're going from mid-winter to mid-summer, the temperature 
change is huge, then you've got 10 hours jet lag. ``But the physical 
drawbacks are completely outweighed by the mental advantage that you 
get from getting that break. It worked last year.''
