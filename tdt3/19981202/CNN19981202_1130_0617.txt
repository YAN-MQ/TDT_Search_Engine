Judge Norma Holloway Johnson has allowed impeachment investigators 
to see the fund-raising memos. You may remember that in a hearing 
today, lawyers for the panel were expected to ask attorney general 
Janet Reno to turn over memos from former prosecutor Charles LaBella. 
He was the head of the justice department's campaign finance investigation. 
Once again, judge Johnson has allowed impeachment investigator or 
will allow them, to see the fund-raising memos.
