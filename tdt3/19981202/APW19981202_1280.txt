The Bosnian Muslim leadership has welcomed the arrest of a Bosnian 
Serb general indicted for war-crimes and hopes NATO will soon accelerate 
efforts to arrest the architects of the Bosnian War. on Wednesday, 
NATO troops arrested Gen. Radislav Krstic on charges of alleged involvement 
in massacres of Muslims that occurred after his troops overrun the 
eastern enclave of Srebrenica in summer 1995. Krstic was arrested 
in the northern part of Bosnia in the sector controlled by U.S. troops. 
``We welcome this arrest and particularly the fact that they have 
started arresting generals,'' Mirza Hajric, the adviser to Bosnian 
Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic said Wednesday. 
``We hope they will soon switch over to commanders,'' referring to 
former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic and military chief 
Gen. Ratko Mladic. The arrest also brought to the surface tensions 
between the Muslim-led government and the French, whom the Muslims 
accuse of blocking efforts to apprehend leading suspects. ``This could 
serve as a good example for the French troops who have not yet arrested 
anybody and in who's region of control the alleged civil and military 
commanders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are still living,'' 
he said. Karadzic and Mladic are the two main indictees on the list 
of the International War-Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. The Bosnian 
Muslims consider France as an obstacle to the arrest of Bosnian Serb 
war-crimes suspects after the French government turned town a request 
of the International Tribunal to allow it's officers to testify in 
front of the court, a source close to the Muslim leadership said. 
So far three high ranking French officers were caught secretly cooperating 
with the Serbs behind the back of the United nations and NATO. NATO-led 
French troops now control the eastern part of Bosnia considered a 
``heaven for war-criminals,'' said a source close to the Muslim leadership. 
``We wonder how long this is going to go on with the French here,'' 
he said. Wednesday's action against Krstic was the first one to result 
in the arrest of a more senior person in the Bosnian Serb military 
structure and the first one related to the Srebrenica massacre in 
which some 8,000 people went missing. For the current political atmosphere 
in Bosnia, it would be important for the masterminders of crime to 
be arrested, Hajric said. ``It would be a message to hundreds of thousands 
of refugees that they can prepare themselves to go home,'' he said. 
While war-criminals remain at large, no minority returns are expected 
to occur in the areas they move around. On last September's nationwide 
elections, the Bosnian Serbs chose Nikola Poplasen, a Bosnian Serb 
ultranationalist for president of their half of Bosnia, to the frustration 
of international agencies charged with the implementation of peace. 
``This would also be an important message to Nikola Poplasen that 
would made him understand that his policy has come to an end,'' Hajric 
stressed.
