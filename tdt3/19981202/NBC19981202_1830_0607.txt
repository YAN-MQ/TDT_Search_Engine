In Seattle, where Boeing is headquartered, the layoffs are not just 
numbers on an annual report. They are real jobs, and real families 
depend on them. Tonight, there is uncertainty and fear among Boeing 
employees. NBC's George Lewis is there. When you think about the 48,000 
Boeing workers getting layoff notices, consider Tim Goree. Married, 
four children. Last day of work will be Friday. The timing couldn't 
have been worse. Right before Christmas, all the bills coming due. 
You know, it's not a good situation. Tim's wife, danette, a clerical 
worker at the state division of child support, is now the family's 
sole breadwinner. You're not able to take care of your bills all at 
once like we were previously. So basically, it's just dinette where 
we spend the money and what bills get paid. Tim and other workers 
say that at the Boeing plants in the seattle area, people are obsessed 
with who's getting laid off and when. It's kind of like running around 
a barnyard, you know, with a bunch of scared chickens. Boeing says 
the economic crisis in Asia and a cutback in planes being ordered 
by Asian airlines are the main reasons for the layoffs. Boeing executives 
say the downturn in their business could last between two and five 
years. The company now has 238,000 employees. That will drop over 
the next two years to 190,000. A Wall Street analyst who follows Boeing 
says company management bears part of the blame for the layoffs, that 
Boeing tried to manufacture too many different kinds of planes too 
rapidly and that costs were out of control even before the Asian crisis 
hit. Boeing has very high costs, high unit costs, to build each of 
these airplanes. And they need to Slim down, not just because there's 
less of an Asian demand, but also because there's too many people 
there. The gorees says the company does have its management problems. 
Yes, I have a little resentment towards the Boeing company just because 
of this. The way they handled things, The way they handled things, 
the fact that it's not going to kill them to keep everyone on until 
after Christmas. The gorees and a lot of other families who depend 
on Boeing for their livelihood are looking at the prospect of empty 
Christmas stockings this year. George Lewis, NBC news, Seattle.
