40,000 Chicago-area residents who received blood transfusions between 
1994 and 1996 are being warned about a risk of possible contamination. 
A New York blood bank says the blood it supplied Chicago-area hospitals 
was improperly tested for viral infections, including HIV and hepatitis. 
Health officials say the chances of infection are remote. No infections 
have been linked to the blood so far.
