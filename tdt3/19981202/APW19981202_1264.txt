Two goals by Polish striker Andrzej Juskowiak and one by American 
midfielder Claudio Reyna gave Wolfsburg a 3-1 victory Wednesday over 
third-division Siegen and a place in the semifinals of the German 
Cup. Wolfsburg, one of the hottest Bundesliga teams at the moment, 
reached the semifinals for the second time since 1995. Werder Bremen, 
another first division team, also advanced by beating TeBe Berlin 
2-1 in extra time, while second-division Oberhausen upset Borussia 
Moenchengladbach 2-0. Juskowiak brought his season goal total to 13 
by scoring in the sixth and 45th minute. Reyna, who has been struggling 
to preserve his place in the starting lineup, added the third in the 
63rd. Wolfsburg is now undefeated in 11 consecutive games. Lithuanian 
midfielder Roman Cirba scored in the 22nd for Siegen, which had eliminated 
one first-division and two second-division teams from the competition. 
A goal by Polish substitute Pavel Wojtala in the 108th minute capped 
Bremen's comeback against second-division TeBe Berlin. Norway's Harvard 
Flo clinched the extra time for Bremen by equalizing four minute before 
the end of regulation time. Creso Kovacec had given the Berlin team 
the lead in the 10th minute. Bremen reached the semifinals for the 
14th time, equaling Schalke's record. Goals by Lars Toborg and Achim 
Weber in the last 20 minutes gave Oberhausen the upset victory over 
struggling first-division Borussia Moenchengladbach. On Tuesday, Bundesliga 
leader and cup holder Bayern Munich crushed slumping VfB Stuttgart 
3-0 in the subfreezing Olympic stadium on goals by Carsten Jancker, 
Mario Basler and Alexander Zickler. The defeat could hasten the end 
of coach Winfried Schaefer's reign in Stuttgart, which is now without 
a win in six games, with four defeats German media reports say Stuttgart 
players are rebelling against the unpopular coach, who is also detested 
by fans. Schaefer denied knowledge of a reported poll by Stuttgart 
players, who allegedly voted 25-0 against the coach. But Schaefer 
dropped Bulgarian star midfielder Krasimir Balakov from the rosters, 
while starting striker Fredi Bobic only came on in the second half-time 
against Bayern. Schaefer said Bobic was in poor form, but the on-and-off 
international immediately assailed the coach. ``You can do this with 
an 18-year-old, but not with Fredi Bobic,'' Bobic said. ``That's exactly 
the problem of Stuttgart,'' Schaefer countered. ``He should have said 
that he deserved to be benched because he hasn't performed well.'' 
``The players blab into microphones instead of checking their performances 
on the field,'' Schaefer said.
