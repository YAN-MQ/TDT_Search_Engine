Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." With Robin Ventura on board 
for the next four years at a cost of $32 million, the new-look New 
York Mets not only feel they have put a stop to their revolving door 
at the hot corner but now are bragging that they have the best defensive 
infield in baseball. We're ecstatic right now. I mean, to think where 
we've come from a year ago and really what we've done this off-season, 
I think that adding Ventura has actually improved us in two positions. 
At third base, I think he's better offensively and defensively than 
we were a year ago. And alfonzo moving to second improves us offensively 
and defensively. So one move actually helps us in two positions.
