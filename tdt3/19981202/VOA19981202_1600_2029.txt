The U.N. Secretary General says opposition forces in Afghanistan have 
been largely eliminated as an effect of force except for those under 
the command of Ahmed Sha Masud. In a report to the general assembly, 
Kofi Annan said that as of September, the Taliban faction had taken 
control of most of the country. Still, he said a political solution 
remains elusive because Taliban military victories appear to have 
reduced the willingness of some parties to negotiate.
