A lot of people were surprised that Mobil Corp. chairman Lucio Noto 
was willing to sell the company to Exxon Corp., but a look at his 
pay package shows that he had powerful incentives. Noto, 60, can collect 
at least $6 million in cash just by leaving if the deal goes through, 
although he said Tuesday he would become vice chairman of the merged 
company. After the deal closes, he would be free to harvest stock 
options that otherwise would not be ripe, removing the risk that depressed 
oil prices will make them worth less in the future. And if he sells 
now the value of his 1996 and 1997 options will balloon by 41 percent 
under terms of the deal. In addition, by selling Mobil and then leaving 
the company, Noto would be freed from company policies that force 
him to hold almost all of his wealth in a basket filled with Mobil 
shares. For a man who has said that he foresees some tough years for 
the oil industry _ oil is selling at the depressed price of about 
$11 a barrel _ there must have been at least a few thoughts about 
the benefits of taking some of his $58 million or so of Mobil wealth 
out of that basket and spreading it around in investments with a less 
risky future. Those would be significant achievements for Noto, a 
lifelong Mobil employee, especially since the Mobil board of directors 
compensation committee determined that in his first three years as 
chief executive, 1994 to 1997, the company's performance was merely 
average compared with other large oil companies. But that committee 
also decided that Noto's salary and bonus have been low relative to 
chief executives at comparable oil companies and gave him a $40,000 
raise to $930,000 starting July 1, 1997, as well as a bonus of $1.13 
million, up from $650,000 in 1996. In February of 1997 Mobil's board 
also doubled his annual award of stock options to 140,000, then doubled 
it again ``in recognition of special achievements of long-term value 
to the company.'' There are sharp differences in style between Noto, 
a man with social skills and considerable charm, and Lee Raymond, 
who would remain chief executive at Exxon and is a very private man 
known for his ability to recall minute details. These and other differences 
have raised some questions about whether the two could work together 
for long. William Randol, an independent energy consultant in New 
York, expressed bewilderment over what prompted Noto to recommend 
that the board sell Mobil. ``He has a strong personality, he is an 
energetic guy and a not insignificant ego,'' Randol said. ``He is 
going to be taking the back seat in this combination and that is very 
strange.'' The relative inattention outsiders have given to Noto's 
pay package and how he will be better off if the merger goes through 
is not surprising. Mobil is a master at making sure it discloses as 
little as legally possible about how it pays executives. Brian Foley, 
an executive compensation lawyer in White Plains, N.Y., spent several 
hours going over Mobil documents trying to flush out the subtle points 
that can add enormous value to pay packages. He found little. ``The 
Mobil guys have taken a lean cuisine approach to disclosure,'' Foley 
said, adding that he tried to parse one key document, a 1995 pay plan 
that is critical to analyzing how executives will fare in the merger, 
and concluded ``that it doesn't say boo.'' Pearl Meyer, whose Pearl 
Meyer &AMP; Partners in New York advises companies on executive pay, 
also said she was struck by how little Mobil has disclosed in filings 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. She found that the Mobil 
board has ``an unusual plan,'' which is more restrictive than other 
companies. ``In the majority of companies you have automatic triggers'' 
that let executives cash out if a company is sold, she said. Mobil's 
plan, however, leaves to company directors the discretion to let executives 
collect their severance packages and exercise all their options. A 
Mobil spokesman, David Bailey, said the company would not comment 
on whether Mobil directors had taken any steps to let executives collect 
these so-called golden parachutes and other benefits. He said the 
sale was recommended by Noto solely because ``it is in the best interests 
of the company.'' Noto's 1996 and 1997 options are worth $8.3 million 
on paper without the Exxon deal, but if it goes through he not only 
can turn those options into cash, they will also swell 41 percent 
in value to $11.6 million. The options are worth more because each 
Mobil share would be exchanged for 1.32 Exxon shares, effectively 
raising the value of Mobil shares, which closed yesterday at $84.1875, 
to $94.06, based on Exxon's closing price of $71.25 per share. How 
much Noto is paid this year, and how many stock options he was awarded, 
will not be known until the next proxy statement. That is not due 
until May, but may be issued sooner because of the merger. However, 
if the board followed the pay practices outlined in its disclosure 
statements, Noto would have received at least 140,000 options last 
February. That would mean he has options worth $10.3 million but that 
cannot be converted into cash yet. If the deal goes through these 
options would be worth $15 million, a 46 percent increase.
