Given that Marc Brown, a children's author, doesn't use a computer 
and just upgraded from rotary-dial phones, it is not surprising he 
wasn't all that impressed when Microsoft came calling in early 1997. 
Microsoft wanted to transform his two anthropomorphized aardvark siblings, 
Arthur and DW, into microchip-laden plush dolls that could interact 
with computers and television sets. But Brown was reluctant after 
seeing Microsoft's first effort at toy making, a computer-friendly 
version of Barney. ``It's a little bit like flying a Lear jet down 
to your mailbox to pick up your mail,'' he said. ``It wasn't really 
necessary to have an animatronic doll to learn your colors.'' Brown 
had previously turned down requests to turn the Arthur stories into 
an animated series. ``I just knew what would happen to Arthur,'' he 
said. ``In no time, they'd have him carry a weapon in his backpack.'' 
He finally agreed to a television series in 1994 after receiving a 
proposal from WBGH, the public broadcasting station in Boston, and 
Cinar Films of Montreal. ``Arthur'' began in 1996 and is now the No. 
1 show among 2- to 5-year-olds nationally. The deal also forced Brown 
to be more open to licensing his characters, because much of program's 
funding comes from payments for those rights. Eventually, he gave 
in to Microsoft. ``When I saw the very first prototypes, it was scary,'' 
Brown recalled. ``It didn't resemble him at all.'' After some design 
changes, Brown was generally satisfied. But his foray into the world 
of computers hasn't changed his mind about technology. ``Using electric 
light is a big excitement for us,'' Brown said from his studio in 
Hingham, Mass.
