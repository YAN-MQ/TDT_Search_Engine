The Asian economic crisis has become a reality for employees of Boeing. 
The American aircraft maker announced 20 thousand job losses last 
night. In addition to 28 thousand five months ago. Liz George has 
details from our business desk in New York. The job losses were announced 
as Boeing, the world's biggest aerospace company, gave a gloomy financial 
forecast for the next few years. It's blamed its difficulties on economic 
troubles in Asia. Saying it's been forced to slash the number of new 
aircraft it's making. Mark Altair is the managing director with Simon 
Smith-Barney. He says Boeing failed to anticipate the knock on impact 
of falling demand for air travel. A lot of the Asian airlines have 
gotten into severe financial difficulty. One -- a couple have gone 
out of business altogether. Meanwhile, with less traffic in Asia, 
the American airlines and other airlines are pulling back planes that 
were allocated to Asia. Into the United States. Into Europe. Into 
South America. And therefore, the demand for planes in those markets 
is dropping. So it is a bit of a snowball effect. But Boeing has repeatedly 
disappointed investors and analysts. And Mark Altair says that although 
the whole industry will be affected. Boeing's workers are bearing 
the brunt of the company's inability to look ahead. They were especially 
bad at predicting this one. The rest of the industry has already assumed 
that 1998 will be a peak year. And 1999 will be a down year. So the 
rest of the industry is pretty much set up for what Boeing announced 
today. And Boeing's contribution to the economy of the Seattle region 
is so important. That for every job it cuts, two or three other jobs 
locally will be effected. The past three years have been terrible 
for Boeing. Not only has it had to shut down its assembly line over 
production quality issues. It struggled with the difficult takeover 
of McDonnell Douglas. And it's lost important customers to its European 
rival, Air Bus. For The World, I'm Liz George, in New York.
