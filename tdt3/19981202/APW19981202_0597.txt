A NATO force on Wednesday arrested a Bosnian Serb general indicted 
in the 1995 massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica and prepared to send 
him for trial before an international war crimes tribunal. The NATO-led 
international Stabilization Force in Bosnia arrested Gen. Radislav 
Krstic, who was indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal 
in The Hague, Netherlands. While the indictment was sealed, the Bosnian 
Serb general was charged in the July 1995 massacre of Muslims after 
rebel Serbs took over the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica in eastern 
Bosnia. Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour called Krstic ``a very significant 
military leader.'' She said she was delighted at the arrest of Krstic, 
who was still believed to be serving in the Bosnian Serb Army. He 
is the ninth war crimes suspect arrested in the former Yugoslavia 
by international forces. ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are 
still at large should realize they, too will be brought to justice,'' 
said NATO Secretary-General Javier. Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic have been 
indicted for genocide for allegedly masterminding the massacre at 
Serbrenica. Neither is in custody.
