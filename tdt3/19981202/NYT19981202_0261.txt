How did she know? ``Of course sex is `OK.' Again, if I didn't want 
you to play certain games, I wouldn't have given you the toys. Do 
you give your children things you don't want them to play with?'' 
That's God talking, in the book ``Conversations With God,'' and the 
question is how did Susan J. Petersen know when she read such pithy 
utterings in the manuscript that they could translate into a huge 
best seller? By most accounts in book publishing, Ms. Petersen has 
an acute literary sensibility and an uncanny intuition about writings 
in the spiritual dominion. Not out-of-body wizardry stuff, but mainstream 
spirituality as befitting a woman who is interested in meditation 
and is said to have visited an ashram and who published ``The Cloister 
Walk,'' and ``Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith'' (Riverhead Books), 
both by Kathleen Norris and both of which made the New York Times 
best-seller list. ``Cloister Walk'' is about monastic life, not exactly 
a buzz topic, but Ms. Petersen is a ``rainmaker,'' ultimately the 
highest accolade in book publishing, a publisher who spots the showers 
coming where others often don't; who publishes books that people not 
only think they should read, but actually walk into a bookstore and 
buy. Not many, for instance, would have guessed that Harold Bloom's 
``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'' (Riverhead), a fat, expensive 
($35), scary title, would become a best seller. Nor would one naturally 
predict that James McBride's ``Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute 
to His White Mother'' would be on The Times' paperback best-seller 
list for nearly two years, and still selling. One of Ms. Petersen's 
competitors, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: ``It's 
not that all her books are best sellers. It's that many of her books 
will probably sell and resell and resell.'' Which is even better than 
simply having a best seller. Of course, her divining rod doesn't always 
find water. Riverhead went into a Billy Joel project this year, and 
then it was dropped. It also was said to have paid about $1 million 
for the paperback rights for Marianne Williamson's ``Illuminata,'' 
a book about prayer, which made the best-seller list but did not sell 
enough to earn back such an advance. Book publishing often seems a 
whiner's trade, caught up in the lamentations about consolidation 
and conglomeration, the fear that somehow it will implode. Despite 
that ambiance, or perhaps because of it, about four years ago Phyllis 
Grann, president of Penguin Putnam Inc., decided to create a new publishing 
division that would be more upmarket, quality driven, youthful than 
Putnam, and its other imprints. Ms. Petersen proved that a major new 
publishing presence such as Riverhead could be created and be successful, 
despite the industry's habitual hand-wringing. Ms. Petersen had left 
Ballantine at Random House in 1992 after running it for about 16 years, 
her stormy personality notwithstanding, and spent two years wandering 
about the mansions of contemplation _ ``I had been working since I 
was 14 and didn't know anything,'' she explained _ before she was 
hired by Mrs. Grann to run the new division. (Last year, Ms. Petersen 
also took over running Viking, Penguin, another Penguin Putnam Inc. 
division. Riverhead publishes about 30 hardcover books a year and 
retains all their paperback rights; Viking and its groups publish 
about 130 books annually.) Ms. Petersen purchased Neale Donald Walsch's 
``Conversations with God: Book I,'' from Hampton Roads Publishing, 
a small press, and published it for Putnam, not Riverhead. It's been 
on The Times' best-seller list for almost two years. (Books II and 
III of the series, also best sellers, were published by Hampton Roads.) 
To succeed as a publisher one needs many things: certainly an entrepreneurial 
gift, but also that vision thing. ``I thought that there were subjects 
that fascinated me,'' Ms. Petersen said, ``and, therefore, probably 
fascinated other people. And then I had to look for editors who would 
fit in, but would also extend my field of vision.'' ``I got editors 
who were fascinated by the ways in which people are alike, yet different, 
who would buy books that take me into a different world that is compelling,'' 
she went on, in an interview. ``As obvious as it now seems to be, 
Harold Bloom's book shows a rare vision of Shakespeare.'' So she hired 
Julie Grau, formerly of Random House, and Celina Spiegel of Houghton 
Mifflin as co-editorial directors, and Amy Hertz of Harper San Francisco 
as her West Coast editor. Among others Ms. Grau bought ``An Instance 
of the Fingerpost,'' a 700-page novel about war-torn 17th-century 
England, that was critically acclaimed and made the best-seller list 
this spring, and it was Ms. Spiegel who trolled in Kathleen Norris. 
What is interesting about Riverhead is that nearly all its books, 
fiction and nonfiction, reflect its publisher's vision: they chronicle 
a journey that is physical and spiritual, with possible absolution 
for those who take the trip. On the summer list, for instance, is 
``The Group,'' by Paul Solotaroff, which was acquired by Ms. Grau, 
about a particular group in therapy, and James Morgan's ``Distance 
to the Moon: A Road Trip into the American Dream,'' bought by Ms. 
Spiegel, in which a man drives across the United States in his Porsche. 
``Every decade there's a personal journey book that is an interesting 
way to think about the meaning of life,'' Ms. Petersen said. ``Its 
appeal is the Lewis and Clark in all of us.'' Or, as God said in ``Conversations 
with God'': ``There is no such thing as `getting into heaven.' There 
is only knowing that you are already there. There is an accepting, 
an understanding, not a working for or a striving.''
