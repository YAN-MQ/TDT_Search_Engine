A car carrying three Norwegian journalists ran off the road and overturned 
Wednesday, killing one of the journalists and injuring the other two, 
an Iraqi official said. The accident occurred 210 miles (350 kms) 
west of the capital, Baghdad. The crew was traveling to the Iraqi 
capital from Amman, Jordan, along a route that is one of the few ways 
into the country because of U.N. sanctions that ban air travel. The 
crew was from Norway's TV2, said Mohsin Tarfa, acting director of 
the Iraqi Press Center in Baghdad. Officials at TV2 in Oslo declined 
to identify the journalists until their families were notified. The 
two injured Norwegians were taken to a hospital in Baghdad, Tarfa 
said. Nearly all visitors to Iraq must take the 12-hour journey through 
the desert from Amman to Baghdad.
