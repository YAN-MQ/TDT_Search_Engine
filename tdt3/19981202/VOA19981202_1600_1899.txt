NATO-led troops have arrested a Bosnian Serb general on genocide charges 
in connection with the 1995 massacres near the former U.N. safe haven 
of Srebrenica. Officials at the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague say 
General Radis Lofkerstitch is the first officer still commanding troops 
in Bosnia to be arrested for war crimes. Prosecutor Louise Arbor says 
the arrest was under a secret indictment. More than 5,000 men disappeared 
after being taken by Serb forces in the area.
