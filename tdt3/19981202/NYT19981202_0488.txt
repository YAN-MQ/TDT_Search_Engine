An auction of American Indian art at Sotheby's in Manhattan turned 
out to be less of an auction than expected Wednesday, after protests 
by several Indian tribes that argued that their cultural heritage 
should not be sold into private hands. Nineteen of the objects, including 
six that several tribes had asked to be removed from the auction block, 
were withdrawn by the auction house or the consignors. Three other 
objects that Indians had also requested be withdrawn from the sale 
_ a Plains ceremonial club, a Yurok ceremonial dance apron and a 16th 
or 17th century Aleut wood mask _ were bought by three people who 
wanted the items returned to the tribes. The 19 objects were pulled 
from the sale at the last minute because of unresolved legal issues. 
In some cases, consignors may not have notified the tribes who are 
claiming the items. In other cases, items were withdrawn because the 
auction house had not determined whether the feathers on them were 
covered by a 1916 act regulating the sale of feathers from certain 
migratory birds. Among those items was an early bentwood hunting hat 
from the Aleut Indians, an Eskimo tribe. Representatives of the tribe 
had protested the hat's sale, arguing that it was part of a lost cultural 
tradition that the Aleuts were struggling to maintain. The hat's consignor, 
Adelaide de Menil, and her husband, the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, 
had rejected requests to withdraw the hat and other items, saying 
that they feared the objects would not be properly cared for by the 
tribes. An Eskimo wood mask also consigned by Ms. de Menil and sought 
by the Aleuts was purchased by a California woman, Anne Bleecker Corcos, 
for $46,000. Ms. Corcos, the head of a nonprofit organization that 
supports American Indian issues, said she planned to return the mask 
to the Aleuts. ``It's a personal thing,'' she said. ``I feel it's 
important for native Americans to receive these things back, especially 
those of ceremonial and spiritual value.'' Ann Rockefeller Roberts, 
president of Fund of the Four Directories, a small nonprofit organization 
that offers grants to native American causes, bought the Yurok apron 
for $11,500. She did it, she said, ``because this is an object that 
the Yurok nation has identified as sacred to their spiritual practices 
and cultural lineage.'' Lawrence Gutstein, an administrator at IBM 
headquarters in Armonk, bought a Plains ceremonial club for $7,475 
that the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of Montana had asked 
be withdrawn from auction. ``My interest,'' he said, ``was to return 
it to its owners. It's a ritual object that has meaning to its community 
and serves a binding role _ it binds the community to each other, 
to its past and present, and provides a foundation to move to the 
future.'' A three-member delegation of Aleuts from the Aleutian/Pribilof 
Islands Association that had flown in from Alaska for the sale expressed 
pleasure at the outcome Wednesday. ``We are finally breaking the ice 
and working toward gathering items _ spiritual, ritual and cultural 
items,'' said Dimitri Philemonof, who heads the association. Speaking 
of the wood mask that would be returned to the Aleuts, Allison A. 
Young, cultural heritage director of the association, said, ``There 
are no words to describe the joy the people in the region will feel 
when they see the ancestral object.'' Quietly and behind the scenes 
Wednesday, the lines were drawn between those who support the Indians' 
right to repossess their sacred objects and those who believe that 
Indian objects in private hands should remain so. In the former camp 
is Elizabeth Sackler, who orchestrated the purchase of the three items. 
Ms. Sackler, the daughter of the antiquities collector Arthur M. Sackler, 
is the founder and president of the Manhattan-based American Indian 
Ritual Object Repatriation Foundation. She created the foundation 
after another American Indian auction at Sotheby's in 1991, where 
she bought and returned to the tribes three masks _ two Hopi and one 
Navajo _ that the Indians considered sacred and had asked be withdrawn 
from the sale. On the other side was Carpenter, who said that he was 
``saddened'' by the auction's direction. ``Disgust is too positive,'' 
he said. ``It's a sad scene.'' He deplored a 1990 Federal statute 
that provides for the return of many Indian objects returning to the 
tribes, but makes no provision for housing or caring for the objects. 
``My wife and I,'' he said, ``have been vigilant in protecting these 
objects for future generations.'' Carpenter said he is dismayed that 
the Aleuts have not vigorously pursued the return of Indian items 
from museums covered by the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act of 1990, which requires federally financed institutions 
to list their Indian holdings and to work with Indian tribes on the 
return of their human remains, ritual objects and items of cultural 
heritage. Ms. de Menil had consigned a number of native American materials 
to the Sotheby's auction, he said, after deciding to close down her 
collection. The majority of the pieces were going to the De Menil 
Museum in Houston, which specializes in surrealism, he said _ objects 
that were visual puns and that represented the coexistence of contraries. 
He met with the Aleut delegation on Tuesday evening soon after they 
arrived in New York, he said, and described the meeting as friendly. 
``I kept insisting that there be standards of protection and scholarship,'' 
Carpenter said. Carpenter said that he believes that ``auction houses 
are being blackballed and blackmailed.'' He added, ``All they're succeeding 
in doing is driving this whole thing underground where information 
will be lost _ and to what end?''
