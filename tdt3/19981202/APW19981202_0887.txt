South Africa's highest court ruled Wednesday it will hear an appeal 
by President Nelson Mandela on a lower-court decision that quashed 
his probe of racism and mismanagement in the South African Rugby Football 
Union. In a country emerging from decades of white rule, the case 
resonates with racial issues. Blacks hated rugby _ loved by the Afrikaner 
descendants of Dutch settlers _ as a symbol of the white minority. 
Mandela tried to use rugby to unify the nation by cheering on the 
national Springboks team to their World Cup victory in 1995. But racial 
divisions emerged again after Mandela appointed a commission to investigate 
SARFU. SARFU went to court to block the probe and even hauled Mandela 
into the witness stand. In April, a judge on the High Court in Pretoria, 
the capital, ruled Mandela had acted unconstitutionally in appointing 
the commission. High Court Judge William de Villiers, appointed to 
the bench under apartheid rule, even rebuked Mandela for insolence 
during his testimony. The Constitutional Court voted unanimously to 
hear the appeal, filed by lawyers for Mandela, Sports Minister Steve 
Tshwete and Director-General of Sport Mthobi Tyamzashe. The court 
set aside five days, beginning on March 23, 1999, for the case.
