The man who inspired the movie and TV series "the fugitive" is getting 
another chance to clear his name 28 years after his death. Today, 
the Ohio Supreme Court ruled a wrongful imprisonment lawsuit filed 
by the son of Dr. Sam sheppard may proceed. Sheppard spent ten years 
in prison for the 1954 murder of his wife. The Supreme Court overturned 
the conviction and sheppard was acquitted at his second trial. His 
son is seeking $2 million in damages.
