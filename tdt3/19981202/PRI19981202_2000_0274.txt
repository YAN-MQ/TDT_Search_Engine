United Nations Secretary General Kofi Ennan appears close to a deal 
to bring suspects to trial for the 1998 -- the 1988 Laugerby Bomb 
Case. Two hundred seventy people were killed when a Pan Am jet exploded 
over the Scottish town. Linda Fusillo reports from New York. In recent 
days, it's been speculated that Kofi Ennan might visit Libya this 
weekend to meet with President Omar Kadafi. Now, officials say the 
prospects of growing, that a deal is in the works. Libya recently 
agreed, in theory, to a U.S.-British proposal. To hold the trial in 
the Netherlands, under Scottish law. But has been objecting to the 
two suspected terrorists serving any possible prison time in Scotland. 
Meanwhile, U.N. and Libyan lawyers have met regularly to try and bridge 
the gap. Ennan would make the trip if he was confident that Kodafi 
would agree to surrender the suspects. The tenth anniversary of the 
bombing is December 21. For NPR News, I'm Linda Fusillo. At the United 
Nations.
