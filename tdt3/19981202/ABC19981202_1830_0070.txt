Good evening. We are going to begin tonight with a question -- why 
are so many people being laid off when the economy is still so strong 
and the job market is still so tight? Just today, B.F. Goodrich said 
it's cutting 775 jobs. Kellogg, the world's largest cerealmaker, is 
cutting jobs. And the industrial giant ITT joined Boeing in announcing 
big job cuts. In fact, already this year, well over 500,000 workers 
at major companies have been told they are not needed. "On the money" 
tonight, ABC's Betsy Stark. Today the bad news came from battle Creek. 
Kellogg said shrinking sales of its cereals around the world were 
forcing it to cut more than one-fifth of its workforce. The cuts were 
about discontinuing work that no longer needed to be part of this 
organization's growth strategy. ITT also announced layoffs today. 
Yesterday it was Boeing, Exxon and mobil. On Monday, Deutsche bank 
and banker's trust. Corporate America is on course to make 1998 the 
worst year for layoffs in a Decade, for three big reasons. The first 
-- 1998 is also shaping up as a banner year for mergers. When a merger 
occurs, inevitably there is a lot of duplication. That means job cuts. 
The Asian crisis is the second reason the toll is mounting. 7,000 
steelworkers have been laid off this year for the same reason tens 
of thousands more Americans have lost their jobs making computer chips 
and electronics. Asian customers have stopped buying, Asian competitors 
are selling a Cheaper product, which means American companies cannot 
raise prices, so they have to cut costs. Labor is about three-quarters 
of the cost of production, so when firms decide to cut back on spending, 
then labor is often the first thing that they turn to. Finally, blame 
Wall Street for the Spike in layoffs. While workers complain cutbacks 
have gone too far, management keeps cutting under pressure from investors 
and industry analysts to keep earnings and stock prices high. For 
all the headlines layoffs have been making, it's important to remember 
that this is still an economy that creates more jobs than it loses. 
Analysts now worry the gap may be closing. Betsy Stark, ABC News, 
New York.
