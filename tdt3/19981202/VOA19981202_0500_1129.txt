Free agent first baseman Raphael Palmero of the Baltimore Orioles 
has signed a five-year, $45 million contract to return to the Texas 
Rangers. Palmero came to Baltimore five years ago from Texas. Palmero 
reportedly turned down a last-minute offer from the Orioles worth 
an extra million dollars a year in order to play near his Texas home. 
The all-star first baseman previously played with the Rangers from 
1989 to 1993. Palmero hit 296 with 43 home runs and 121 runs batted 
in for the Orioles last year. Those home runs and RBIs are career 
highs.
