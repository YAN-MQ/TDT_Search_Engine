A politically charged, high-security soccer match here brought together 
Italian and Turkish ministers who reportedly made some progress toward 
resolving a bitter dispute between both countries over a Kurdish rebel 
leader. Turkey and Italy have locked horns over the fate of Abdullah 
Ocalan, who asked Rome for political asylum after he was detained 
in Italy last month, and there were fears the political tensions might 
spill onto the soccer field. But the match between top teams Juventus 
of Turin and Galatasaray of Istanbul came off without any violence 
at the stadium, where some 22,000 police officers were deployed for 
the Champions League game, which ended in a 1-1 tie. Military units 
were on standby. Hundreds of police were on hand when Juventus arrived 
at the Istanbul airport Wednesday. A small group of airport employees 
tossed flowers at the team bus in greeting. But, as loyal home-team 
fans, they also chanted ``Turkey, Turkey!'' The road from the airport 
to the team's hotel was closed to traffic, but people standing along 
the route waved to the bus. Turkey's leaders had called on Turks to 
be hospitable and refrain from doing anything to mar the match. However, 
upbeat soccer cheers were mixed with obscenities aimed at Juventus 
players on the field. In a show of top-level support, Italy's ministers 
of foreign trade, Piero Fassino, and of sports, Giovanna Melandri, 
went to Istanbul for the game. Just hours before the match, the two 
held talks with the Turkish Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu and 
Sports Minister Yucel Seckiner. After the meeting, Denizkurdu said 
the ministers ``may have found a way out,'' the Anatolia news agency 
reported. He did not elaborate, but said he would relate the discussion 
to Turkey's prime minister. ``I believe the talks were very useful, 
they can be a departure point to overcome the disagreements of the 
past few weeks,'' Fassino was quoted as saying by Anatolia. The Italian 
news agency AGI quoted Melandri as saying: ``we had a way to explain 
that Italy could find a solution to the Ocalan affair but in respect 
for the laws of the Constitution that doesn't allow extradition to 
a nation where capital punishment is practiced.'' Italy doesn't have 
the death penalty while Turkey, which has accused Ocalan of terrorism, 
does. Earlier in the day, Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said in 
Rome that Italy would consider a trial in an impartial country if 
its proposal for an international tribunal to judge Ocalan isn't feasible. 
An Italian trial for Ocalan was also suggested as a way out. ``We
