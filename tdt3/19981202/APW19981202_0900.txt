Germany will seek tough budget reforms in the European Union during 
its six-month presidency of the trade bloc starting Jan. 1, Foreign 
Minister Joschka Fischer said Wednesday. His comments drew battle 
lines, including with Germany's key partner France, over difficult 
efforts to streamline the EU to allow it to welcome the first nations 
from the former Soviet bloc after 2000. A priority will be to cut 
Germany's share of the dlrs 100 billion EU budget, Fischer said in 
reply to lawmakers' questions. Germany is the largest contributor, 
paying for about a third of EU spending. ``We want a success, but 
not at any price anymore,'' Fischer said. He also repeated that Germany 
wants a budget freeze and cuts in farm subsidies, which eat up about 
half the EU budget. France worries that its powerful farm lobby will 
revolt against subsidy cuts. Schroeder has set an ambitious March 
deadline for resolving squabbles among EU nations over plans to overhaul 
the budget for 2000-2006 to enable the bloc to finance the entry of 
new members. Another focus of the EU presidency will be joint efforts 
to put Europeans back to work, Fischer said. ``It will be a chance 
to push employment and social policies for Europe,'' government spokesman 
Uwe-Karsten Heye said. German and French leaders called Tuesday for 
a European pact for jobs. But Fischer seemed to tone down expectations, 
saying that main goal was better coordination of national programs 
to fight unemployment. Joblessness in the 11 countries launching Europe's 
single currency, the euro, is a stubborn 10.9 percent. With the euro 
making its debut Jan. 1, Germany's finance minister is stepping his 
campaign for a common EU tax policy to complement the common money. 
Oskar Lafontaine is proposing that the EU drop the right of individual 
EU governments to veto common tax measures, German media reported 
Wednesday. The idea seems aimed against Britain, which says a single 
currency doesn't necessarily require unified taxes in Europe. Britain 
is not introducing the euro.
