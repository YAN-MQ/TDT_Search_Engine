Angola's government and the former rebel group UNITA have been planting 
new land mines, causing a sharp rise in casualties, several non-governmental 
organizations said Wednesday. In a letter addressed to both sides, 
four organizations said 18 people had died and 36 were wounded in 
explosions during the past two months in the eastern province of Moxico, 
about 560 miles (900 kilometers) southeast of the capital, Luanda. 
The letter sent by the Jesuit Refugee Service, Mines Advisory Group, 
Medico International and Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation said 
the total number of mine victims this year is 91, including 40 soldiers. 
The groups added that the toll hadn't been so high since 1994, when 
a U.N.-brokered peace deal was signed to end a two-decade-long civil 
war. A recent surge in tension between the government and UNITA has 
triggered fears that the country is sliding back to war. Angola is 
thought to have between 9 million and 20 million mines concealed in 
its soil, making it one of the world's most mined countries.
