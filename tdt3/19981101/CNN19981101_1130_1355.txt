Illinois versus Penn state. Fourth and inches for the fighting illini, 
when elmer Hickman takes the handoff, but Penn state's LaVar arrington 
reads the play perfectly and leaps over the line of scrimmage to make 
the tackle. One more look, as arrington goes airborne for the stop, 
and the "play of the day."
