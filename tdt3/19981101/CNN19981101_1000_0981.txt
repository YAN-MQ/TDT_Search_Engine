The most famous landmark in Paris is closed for the weekend because 
of a Strike. Workers at the Eiffel tower walked off the job Friday 
to demand management hire more staff. The strikers want 32 new workers 
added to the payroll, but management is only planning to hire 25. 
The strike could keep the tower closed until at least tomorrow.
