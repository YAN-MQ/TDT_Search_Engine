We now have more on the release of those secretly recorded Tripp/Lewinsky 
tapes. Sherry rauh reports. She's become win of the most recognizable 
faces in the country. Private details about her relationship with 
President Clinton are now public record. But through it all, there's 
been something about Monica Lewinsky most americans have never heard. 
The sound of her voice. First time I ever looked into his eyes, close 
up, and was with him alone, I saw somebody totally different than 
I had expected to see. And that's the person Eiffel in love with. 
The tapes, made secretly by Lewinsky's one-time confidant Linda tripp, 
were released today. We hear Lewinsky as she describes how it feels 
to be pushed away by the man she thought may have loved her. This 
is an original thinking, are you ready? Write a letter? yes. Send 
him a note, making the atmosphere acceptable for telling me that. 
Do you see what I mean? yes. Like saying, look, okay, it's clear to 
me this is not going to happen. Can we please get together and work 
on some way so that I can come out of this situation not feeling the 
way I do. Transcripts of the tapes were released last month so there 
nor surprises. But they add a human quality to a report that until 
now has been a listing of evidence and accusations. Having him in 
my life is more important to me than a job. Sharry rauh, "Headline 
News."
