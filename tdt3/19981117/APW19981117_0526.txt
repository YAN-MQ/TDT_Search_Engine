A U.N. investigator will travel to Nigeria for the first time this 
weekend to check on the human rights situation there, a spokesman 
said Tuesday. In a move aimed at restoring its international image, 
the Nigerian government in September invited Indian expert Soli Sorabjee 
to travel to the African nation ``as soon as possible.'' Sorabjee's 
visit will start Sunday and finish on Dec. 1, said Jose Diaz, spokesman 
for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Sorabjee will report 
his findings back to the U.N. Human Rights Commission. Nigeria's new 
leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has promised to end human rights 
abuses and restore democracy and civilian rule. Nigeria is on a special 
watch list at the U.N. commission for countries accused of the most 
flagrant violations. However, the late military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, 
refused to allow Sorabjee into Nigeria for a first-hand investigation.
