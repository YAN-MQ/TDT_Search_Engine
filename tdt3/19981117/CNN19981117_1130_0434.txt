I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News" weather. 
Cold weather today over much of the upper midwest and northern Rockies 
with 20s for highs. Still warm, though, much of the southeast, gulf 
coast, highs into the 70s and 80s. Forecast calls for a pretty big 
storm system to move in through the upper midwest and northern plains 
by later on tomorrow. That will be spreading some heavy snows through 
sections of the dakotas and northern Minnesota. Windy conditions will 
be pushing in through the midwest. High pressure and fair weather 
expected for the northeast and a good part of the northwestern U.S. 
as well. Take a look now at the extended forecast -- snow will accompany 
parts of the northern Great Lakes during the day on Thursday with 
that storm system. A mix of precipitation further to the south through 
the southern Great Lakes and then showers and storms from the Ohio 
river valley into the southeast. Temperature highs are quite cold 
through the upper midwest, both on thursday and on into Friday. Look 
for precipitation in the northeast, mainly from the form of rain on 
friday, the snow will be up in the eastern Canada with showers and 
storms in the southeast. And windy conditions both Friday and Saturday 
will be spreading into the pacific northwest.
