that's not always the case. why? "Bitter pill," our special series, 
tomorrow night. I'll be right back with a woman of the house, making 
a big power play. Dr. Scholl's next stop: San Francisco. Let's talk 
about feet. I do have corns. I've tried band-AIDS. They don't get 
rid of the corn. This is Dr. Scholl's cushlin gel corn removers. The 
cushlin gel relieves the pain. The medicated disk removes the corn. 
It just feels so much better. My work here is done. I'm on an all 
night flight, when suddenly... terrible heartburn. The guy in the 
next seat says, "here, try this." Zantac 75. Thanks, I say. Ya know, 
maybe I oughta see a doctor about this heartburn. He says, "you just 
did." The medicine in Zantac 75 is the #1... doctor-prescribed acid 
reducer. It relieves even your toughest heartburn, controlling acid 
for up to 12 hours. Thanks, doctor. wherever you are. Zantac 75: open 
wide! It's new friskies dental diet! Now there's a great-tasting cat 
food that helps reduce plaque and tartar build-up by 25%. That's news 
to chew on! Toothbrushes... poor humans. New friskies dental diet. 
The truck. The award. The new Chevy Silverado. The motor trend truck
