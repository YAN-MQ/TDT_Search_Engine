A presidential scandal that was never long on mystery or romance surrendered 
perhaps its last tantalizing secret Tuesday. What for the last 10 
months had been heard only by select prosecutors, grand jurors, relatives 
and waiters Tuesday chattered, sobbed and wheedled around the world. 
Monica Lewinsky's endlessly tape-recorded voice _ like so much of 
her uniquely interrupted, scrutinized life _ became public property. 
The inflection was not thin or childish, even in constant counterpoint 
to the robust rasp of Linda Tripp, who secretly recorded their conversations. 
But, more Buffy than Bacall, it was unmistakably that of a woman who 
is very young. ``Meaning, like, if she had a moment,'' she says sharply 
at one point, describing how she had paged the president's secretary, 
Betty Currie, ``like, if she could, you know, if she could talk, then 
to call me.'' Unaware that Tripp is archiving her rapid-fire ramblings, 
she adds impatiently, ``So it's like, whatever.'' At other points, 
Lewinsky's rather nasal intonation softens, the word ``like'' drops 
away, and she sounds lost and a little afraid. ``That was very nice 
of her,'' she murmurs sadly when told that a White House staff member 
has defended her jeopardized reputation. The content of the 22 hours 
of conversations was revealed weeks ago in transcripts. But their 
tone and tenor were unknown before Tuesday morning, when sets of 37 
tapes were presented in flat brown boxes, like so many breakfast doughnuts, 
to reporters. They were released by the House Judiciary Committee, 
which is considering an impeachment case against Clinton. In an unexpected, 
nostalgic twist, the audiotapes almost instantly yanked Tuesday's 
24-hour television news networks back to the less hectic days of radio 
drama. Static head shots of the protagonists adorned the screen. White 
House aides privately grumbled about the timing of the release, two 
days before Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, is to testify 
before the committee. But most just declared that the tapes contributed 
nothing new. Asked if the audio might draw attention by adding drama 
to the proceedings, Paul Begala, an adviser to Clinton, did not pause. 
``Maybe in the way that people slow down to look at a car wreck on 
the highway,'' he said. ``But that doesn't mean they want more car 
wrecks.'' The White House could draw some comfort Tuesday from Tripp's 
performance. What read as exhortation in the transcripts sounds like 
hectoring and even badgering as she presses Lewinsky to seek a better 
job with higher pay from Clinton and his friends. ``Favors like that 
are done every day, and it's nonthreatening to anyone,'' she says. 
All the while, Tripp commiserates with Lewinsky that others have their 
``own agenda'' and worries that she could ``lose a dear friend'' by 
testifying against Lewinsky. Lewinsky sometimes sounds quite mature 
and analytical as she contemplates in matter-of-fact tones the trouble 
it might cause the president to arrange a highly paid job for her. 
But she also sounds determined as when she declares that she wants 
``something easy to do.'' And she sometimes sounds plain angry. ``I'm 
fed up,'' she says at another point. Tripp has a lot going on in the 
background. She can be heard eating _ at one point there is the unmistakable 
sound of a spoon scraping cardboard _ watching sports on television, 
ordering a pet off the furniture. But she never seems to lose track 
of Lewinsky's exhaustive accounts of her efforts to reach Clinton. 
The committee blanked out some personal exchanges as well as what 
appears to have been a multitude of expletives. The two women spent 
much of their hours of conversation trading observations about their 
own and each other's personalities. Worrying that White House staff 
members might be gossiping about her, Lewinsky tells Tripp she may 
go crazy if she returns there to work. ``Me with my paranoia?'' she 
expostulates. At times Lewinsky seems to be using her voice as an 
instrument to influence her confidante. She sobs, seemingly uncontrollably, 
at the news that Tripp intends to testify truthfully about their conversations, 
but she dries up when Tripp cuts her off with the impatient observation 
that she does not cry as easily as Lewinsky. Lewinsky tries wheedling. 
``What about if I could insure that you have job security?'' she asks. 
Finally, her voice rises to a screech as she says that the president 
will realize she has been indiscreet with Tripp. ``Because it'll be 
obvious, it'll be obvious to him!'' she storms. It is when she considers 
the extremes of her extraordinary predicament that Lewinsky sounds 
the youngest. In Harlequin romance novel terms, she describes falling 
in love with Clinton ``the first time I ever looked into his eyes 
close up.'' But she also becomes almost a child again when she contemplates 
the awfulness of her situation. ``You know, I can't win for losing,'' 
she blurts out at one point, sounding near tears. ``I can't win. I 
can't win.''
