Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche said Tuesday it has suspended the 
use of its anti-Parkinson's disease drug Tasmar in the European Union 
and will issue a revised label restricting its use in the United States. 
``Evolving safety information has led Roche to revise the recommendations 
to physicians on the appropriate use of the drug,'' the company said 
in a statement. The European Commission has asked member states to 
suspend the use of Tasmar from Tuesday. First launched in August 1997, 
it is available in 38 countries. On Monday, the U.S. government warned 
the drug may cause fatal liver damage and should be reserved for severe 
cases unhelped by other therapies. The Food and Drug Administration 
approved Tasmar in January. But after learning of three deaths from 
severe liver damage, it ordered Roche to put the government's strongest 
warning on the drug's label. Patients taking Tasmar should consult 
physicians and shouldn't precipitately stop treatment, since inappropriate 
change in therapy might trigger serious harm, Roche said. The company 
said that for a restricted number of patients the addition of Tasmar 
to standard therapy is providing a ``clinically significant benefit 
that outweighs the risk.'' Roche last month confirmed it had sent 
an advisory letter to doctors asking them to report any liver troubles 
in patients taking Tasmar. About 60,000 people worldwide have taken 
Tasmar, including up to 30,000 Americans.
