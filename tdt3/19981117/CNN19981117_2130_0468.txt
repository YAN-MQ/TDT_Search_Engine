This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Wednesday. Rain and snow move away from New England 
to be replaced by high pressure. High pressure will also build into 
the northwestern U.S. but we will see some lingering snow showers 
over the northern Rockies as a storm moves into the upper midwest, 
producing rain and snow, and in fact, near-blizzard conditions in 
some parts of North Dakota and Minnesota because of strong winds associated 
with this system. Highs through that region will be in only the 20s 
and 30s on Wednesday. We'll see 30s and 40s across the northeast and 
some mild 60s, 70s and a few 80s in the south. Looking ahead to Thursday, 
we'll see snow from the northern Great Lakes, with showers and thunderstorms 
farther south. Some showers push into the northwest as well. Then 
on Friday, a mix of rain and snow in the northeast, showers and storms 
in the southeast and rain and wind in the northwest and just some 
lingering snow showers northeast on Saturday.
