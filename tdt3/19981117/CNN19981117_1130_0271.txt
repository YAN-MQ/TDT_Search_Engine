United Nations arms inspectors are back in Iraq, but they probably 
won't conduct any field work until tomorrow. At that point, they can 
test Baghdad's pledge of unfettered access. If the Iraqis fail that 
test, severe consequences may follow. Both Britain and the U.S. warn 
that the next broken promise will trigger an attack. Iraq had suspended 
cooperation with the inspectors, demanding that the U.N. lift economic 
sanctions before letting the inspectors continue their work.
