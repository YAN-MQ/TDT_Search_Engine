Geoff Hurst, the only player to score three goals in a World Cup final, 
went to Buckingham Palace on Tuesday to receive a knighthood for services 
to English soccer. Queen Elizabeth II knighted Hurst, 32 years after 
she presented him with his World Cup winners' medal at Wembley following 
the 4-2 victory over Germany in the final. ``Receiving a knighthood 
is a wondering thing to happen and it was almost like full circle 
today because it was the Queen who presented the England team with 
the trophy at Wembley in 1966,'' Hurst said. Hurst, 56, is a leading 
official in England's bid to host the 2006 World Cup. His 1966 World 
Cup team-mate, Bobby Charlton, and manager Alf Ramsey also have been 
knighted.
