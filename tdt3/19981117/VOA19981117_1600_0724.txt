The United Nation's Children's Fund, UNICEF says children are bearing 
the brunt of the devastation left by Hurricane Mitch in Central America, 
and will suffer from its effects for months and yeas to come. Lisa 
Schlein reports from Geneva. UNICEF studied specifically the situation 
in Honduras. The study found that about one-half of the estimated 
7000 people killed by Hurricane Mitch in Honduras are believed to 
have been children. It says children also comprise at least one-half 
of the 10,000 Hondurans who are still missing and the nearly 2 million 
made homeless. UNICEF Communication Officer Patrick McCormick says 
children who live in shelters are particularly vulnerable to disease. 
Furthermore, he says, the lack of proper sanitation and safe drinking 
water could lead to water-born diseases. We're seeing an increased 
number of instance of respiratory infections, diarrhea, and we foresee 
outbreaks - unless we're very, very lucky - of malaria, cholera and 
such things like that. And of course the hepatitis seems to hit children 
first. The study was conducted with the Honduran government. It says 
the country was making considerable progress in reducing child mortality 
before the disaster struck. The child death rate had dropped and it 
looked as though it would continue to drop. But, UNICEF says Hurricane 
Mitch will slow perhaps even reverse this progress. Mr. McCormick 
says the psychological impact on children from this tragedy is devastating. 
We can't even begin to imagine how many children have been traumatized 
by their own experience. And seeing family members, mothers, fathers, 
dragged away by mud or water. We have noticed already some signs of 
depression. Mr. McCormick says many children are having difficulty 
eating and sleeping. Some are prone to violent behavior and are having 
learning difficulties. UNICEF says its greatest needs are for food, 
medicine, water and helicopters to fly in relief supplies to inaccessible 
remote areas of the country. The agency says it also hopes to provide 
psychological counseling for traumatized children. And once the emergency 
situation settles down, UNICEF says it will begin a tracing service 
to try to locate missing family members. Lisa Schlein for VOA News,
