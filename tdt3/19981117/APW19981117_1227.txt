Responding to a U.S. plea, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
pledged Tuesday to revive a probe into whether Soviet spy agencies 
plotted to seize U.S. prisoners from the Korean War. After five years 
of investigation, a U.S.-Russian panel on POWs said last year it had 
failed to find evidence of such a plot, but the memoirs of a late 
Russian military historian prompted the United States to press for 
renewed study. U.S. Vice President Al Gore asked Primakov for help 
Tuesday during a meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum in Malaysia. Gore gave Primakov a letter asking him to open 
Russian records in hopes of finding a final answer to a question that 
has haunted many Americans for decades. ``Primakov said he would do 
whatever he could to help,'' said a senior U.S. official, who briefed 
reporters on condition of anonymity. It remained unclear which archives 
Russia would open to investigation. The previous probe included reviews 
of more than 10,000 documents and interviews with hundreds of Russians. 
More than 8,000 Americans are missing from the 1950-1953 war, in which 
Moscow sided with North Korea and the United States supported the 
South. The war ended in a tense military standoff that continues today, 
seven years after the end of the Cold War. The families of some of 
the missing Americans say they may have been taken to the former Soviet 
Union, and could still be alive. Some Russians claim to have seen 
Americans in hospitals or prisons over the years. U.S. officials said 
Washington wanted to look into a claim by Gen. Dmitry Volkogonov, 
a military historian whose memoirs described a possible plan to obtain 
Americans for questioning. Volkogonov, who died in December 1995, 
wrote that he had tried in vain to confirm that such a plan existed. 
Volkogonov was co-chairman of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on 
POW/MIAs, set up in 1992 to determine the fate of missing servicemen 
from both nations. A former KGB director has told U.S. officials he 
knew of no such plan but it may have been discussed in KGB documents, 
said another U.S. official at the APEC summit, also speaking on condition 
of anonymity. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has said there's no 
reason to believe any Americans are alive and being held against their 
will in Russia. The U.S.-Russian commission said last July it had 
no information to contradict Yeltsin's statement. However, the Americans 
still want to see additional classified material. ``Given the nature 
of the relationship between North Korea and the Soviet Union, the 
Soviets must have gotten their hands on some Americans,'' Malcolm 
Toon, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow and co-chairman of the joint 
commission, said at the time. ``It would be wrong to say we are satisfied 
with the results of our investigation so far,'' Toon said. The Russians 
are looking into the fate of Soviet troops missing in Afghanistan.
