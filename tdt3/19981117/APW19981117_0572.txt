About 70 Jordanian political activists staged a sit-in outside the 
Iraqi Embassy Tuesday to protest U.S. threats of strikes against neighboring 
Iraq. The silent protest organized by the Jordan Women Association 
urged Arab states to defy the crippling U.N. sanctions against Iraq. 
The protesters carried pictures of malnourished Iraqi children, who 
have been suffering under the sanctions which were imposed following 
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. ``No for striking at Iraq,'' the women 
said in a statement. ``Striking at Iraq will not erase Clinton's scandals,'' 
it added, referring to the U.S. president's recent sex scandal with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. ``Arab dignity is at stake'' 
if the United States and Britain attack Iraq, the statement said. 
The threat of an attack was averted after Iraq on Saturday rescinded 
its Oct. 31 decision to suspend cooperation with U.N. inspection teams. 
But Clinton warned that a military strike was still an option if Iraq 
failed to cooperate with the inspectors. Some 86 inspectors returned 
to Baghdad Tuesday to resume their work.
