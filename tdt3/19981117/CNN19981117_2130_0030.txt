I'm Lynne Russell. Thanks for joining us. In another attempt to pad 
the U.S. economy against a potential blow from crashing global markets, 
the federal reserve has cut interest rates. Today, the central bank 
lowered two short-term rates .25%. that puts the federal funds rate 
for overnight loans at 4.75%. that rate determines the interest charged 
on most loans, like credit cards and automobiles. The fed also lowered 
the discount rate for emergency loans to banks to 4.5%. it's the third 
interest rate cut in seven weeks and had a mixed effect on Wall Street. 
We'll have more on that in consumer news.
