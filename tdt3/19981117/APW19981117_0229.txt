The giant Russian Gazprom company has proposed building a natural 
gas pipeline to China with the possibility of extending it to Japan, 
the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday. Gazprom president Rem Vyakhirev 
told Russian journalists at the APEC summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 
that the proposed pipeline would enable the compaly to deliver 30 
billion to 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas for 30 years. Construction 
would be supervised by Russia and the project would be financed internationally, 
he said. ``We are ready to start designing and forming a consortium. 
Russia is offering builders, scientific resources, machinery and know 
how, while the financing would be international. Someone is looking 
for gas, and we money,'' he said. The pipeline would take three years 
to four years to complete and be completed by 2004 at the latest, 
Vyakhirev was quoted as saying. The initial project would cost about 
dlrs 15 billion, he said. The pipeline could be a first step to an 
Asian-Pacific natural gas system similar to an existing network in 
Europe. Japanese officials were studying the option of extending the 
pipeline to Japan, the report said.
