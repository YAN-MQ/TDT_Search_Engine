After a week and a half of stalled talks, the National Basketball 
Association's labor dispute took a turn for the better Tuesday when 
internal negotiating teams for both sides met and agreed to schedule 
a full bargaining session with owners and players on Friday in Manhattan. 
The two-hour meeting at a midtown hotel was described as amicable 
by the league and represented the first contact in 10 days between 
the two parties. With the opportunity to begin the season before January 
fading fast, it also pointed to renewed concern for the players and 
the owners to negotiate rather than postulate. Commissioner David 
Stern, the deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, and Steve Mills, the 
league's senior vice president for basketball development, met Tuesday 
with the union's representatives: the executive director, Billy Hunter; 
the president, Patrick Ewing, and the vice president, Herb Williams. 
The league said no progress was made, but the fact that the NBA's 
nine-member labor relations committee and the union's negotiating 
committee of more than 20 players will be in the same room on Friday 
for the first time in more than three weeks speaks volumes. ``If we 
don't start making progress soon, the season is in jeopardy,'' said 
Granik, who added that negotiating around the holiday season would 
be difficult. ``We'll give it one more try on Friday.'' Six weeks 
of the season have been lost to the dispute as the games of Dec. 8-14 
were canceled last week. ``We've been making compromises all summer 
long, and they haven't made any,'' Ewing said before Tuesday's meeting. 
``They still haven't made any. Now it's up to them.''
