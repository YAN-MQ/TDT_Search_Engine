Wall Street's eyes will be on federal reserve policymakers meeting 
today to consider another cut in interest rates. The fed dropped short-term 
interest rates twice recently as the U.S. economy stuttered and the 
stock market plunged. But economists say recent events such as an 
international bailout of brazil, Japan's moves to shore up its weakening 
economy and the recent 1,500-point surge in the Dow makes it tough 
to predict what the fed will do today.
