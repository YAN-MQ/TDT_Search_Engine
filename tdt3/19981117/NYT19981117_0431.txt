At the request of President Clinton, the ethical implications of creating 
hybrid human-cow cells were discussed by the National Bioethics Advisory 
Commission at its meeting Tuesday in Miami, but at least in the public 
portion of their discussion, none of the commissioners voiced concern 
about the creation of the hybrid cells. Clinton requested the discussion 
last week in a letter to the commission's chairman, Dr. Harold Shapiro 
of Princeton University. Clinton said he was ``deeply troubled'' by 
news that Advanced Cell Technology, a small biotechnology company 
in Worcester, Mass., had created the hybrid cells. The company proposes 
to use the technique to take any body cell from a patient, return 
it to its embryonic form and use it to grow any of a variety of body 
tissues for possible transplant back into the patient. One advantage 
of the technique is that the patient would receive tissues made from 
his own cells. Another is that no cells would be taken from human 
embryos or fetuses. Noting that scientists had been fusing together 
cells of different origin for years, Dr. David Cox of Stanford University, 
a member of the commission, said, ``We should tell the president there 
is nothing new in cells fused from different eggs.'' The hybrid cow-human 
cells consist of the nucleus of a human cell inserted into a cow egg 
whose own nucleus has been removed. Factors in the cow egg are thought 
to make the human cell nucleus revert to its embryonic form. Because 
the proteins of a cell turn over rapidly, the cow proteins are expected 
to be rapidly replaced by human proteins. The mitochondria of the 
cell, however, are likely to remain cowlike, giving rise at least 
initially to cells that are not wholly human. An outside expert who 
spoke to the commission by telephone, Ralph Brinster, a physiologist 
at the University of Pennsylvania, said of the cow-human hybrid cell, 
``Most scientists would not regard it as a chimera.'' Chimeras are 
animals made from the cells of two different individuals by injecting 
the embryonic cells of one into the embryo of another. Making human 
chimeras is widely regarded as unethical. Dr. Michael West, president 
of Advanced Cell Technology, attended the commission's meeting and 
was invited speak. In response to questions, he said he did not believe 
the cells formed in his procedure, called embryonic stem cells, were 
capable of forming a fetus if transferred to a uterus, something he 
said he had no intention of doing. Asked how he would prevent the 
technique from being misused, such as in cloning a person, he suggested 
that the cloning of humans should be made a crime. The commission 
members said they would draft a reply to Clinton.
