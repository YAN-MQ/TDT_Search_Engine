The environmental protection agency is launching a program designed 
to control emissions of the toxic substance, Mercury. The EPA is directing 
utilities to begin testing how much Mercury is emitted through smokestacks 
of coal-burning power plants. Testing begins in January. The agency 
says, it will gather information from more than 1,400 plants around 
the country. Mercury can cause brain damage.
