U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Baghdad today for the first time 
since iraq stopped cooperating with them last month. Chief arms inspector 
Richard Butler says he'll demand Iraqi officials hand over documents 
concerning chemical and biological weapons. He says that's part of 
the full, unfettered access Iraqi leaders promised over the weekend, 
bringing a halt to U.S. plans for air strikes. One aircraft carrier, 
two dozen ships, 173 planes and 23,000 U.S. troops are still in the 
Persian gulf, just in case Iraq backs down on its promise.
