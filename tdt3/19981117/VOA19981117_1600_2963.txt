Well, stock prices were down until mid-afternoon when US Central Bank 
announced that it will cut two key interest rates by one quarter percent. 
Stock prices then started rising, although as I said, some late session 
selling did bring the Dow down. Analysts say this latest interest 
rate cut, the second in less than a month should prolong US economic 
expansion and help corporate profits. One factor that may have encourage 
the Central Bank to order the interest rate cuts is that US inflation 
remains very low. Government reports consumer prices rose just a modest 
2-tenths of one percent in October.
