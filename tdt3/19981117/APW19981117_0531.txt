German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the Russian government's 
economic rescue plan a ``good start,'' but indicated Germany would 
provide little more than moral support in Russia's latest economic 
struggle. Schroeder, on his first visit to Russia as German leader, 
met Tuesday with President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin. Yeltsin expressed 
hope that Russia and Germany ``will enter the next century with their 
relations developing at the same pace as now.'' ``I'm sure they will,'' 
Schroeder responded. Yeltsin looked fit and spoke distinctly at the 
start of the meeting after weeks of renewed speculation about the 
state of his health. He curtailed meetings last week with the visiting 
Japanese prime minister, prompting new speculation that he was seriously 
ill. Speaking at a news conference after the talks, Schroeder said 
Yeltsin was ``active and well-informed.'' He said Yeltsin will join 
the summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in Cologne 
next June. Schroeder said he would again travel to Moscow to hold 
further talks with Russian officials. Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut 
Kohl, had close ties with Yeltsin, which helped secure significant 
German investment and aid but also drew criticism from those who blame 
Yeltsin for many of Russia's problems. Schroeder insisted Monday that 
the relationship between Germany and Russia must not rely too much 
on personal ties. After meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
on Monday, Schroeder said Germany will not give Russia any emergency 
financial aid outside the money it's providing through international 
lenders. ``People in Russia fully realize the contribution Germany 
has made,'' Schroeder said at a news conference Tuesday. ``I think 
Russians duly assess it and realize that our opportunities are limited.'' 
Schroeder said his talks with Russian officials focused on cooperation 
in aerospace industry and improving conditions for foreign investors 
in Russia. A delegation of German executives with business interests 
in Russia joined Schroeder on the trip. The cash-strapped Russian 
government desperately needs foreign aid to pay off its huge debts, 
but the IMF and other international lenders have stopped releasing 
loans, saying they want Moscow to start implementing a sound economic 
plan first. Schroeder called Russia's economic rescue plan, presented 
this weekend, a ``good start'' toward convincing international lenders 
to resume aid. ``That program should be augmented so that it meets 
conditions set by the IMF,'' he said Tuesday. He stopped short of 
saying Germany would recommend that the IMF release the money. The 
IMF has criticized the latest government plan as too vague and overloaded 
with state controls of the economy. Schroeder urged the Russian Cabinet 
and the parliament to ``find answers to the IMF questions.'' Germany 
is a key member of the IMF, the World Bank and the European Union, 
all of which have provided aid to Russia. Schroeder also met with 
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, speakers of both parliament 
houses and politicians, including Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. 
At a news conference Tuesday, Schroeder defended his meeting with 
the Communist leader. ``Mr. Zyuganov is the leader of the largest 
parliament faction,'' he said. ``I may voice a different opinion on 
certain subjects, but that doesn't impede us from having a dialogue.'' 
The Communist Party recently provoked an outburst when it failed to 
publicly condemn anti-Semitic remarks of one of its members. ``I pointed 
out to Mr. Zyuganov that anti-Semitism is unacceptable in a democratic 
country, and he agreed with me,'' Schroeder said.
