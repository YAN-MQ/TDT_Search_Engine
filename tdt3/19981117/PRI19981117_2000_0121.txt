The Federal Reserve has cut short-term interest rates by a 1/4 point. 
The central bank cut the Federal funds rate to 4.75 percent and the 
discount rate to 4.5 percent. It's the third time in less than two 
months that the Fed has brought rates down in an effort to keep the 
economy moving in spite of the global financial crisis. In a statement 
following the rate cut, the Fed said even though financial markets 
have settled down since mid-October, unusual strains remain. The central 
bank said the costs of borrowing money are now low enough to ensure 
solid growth and low inflation.
