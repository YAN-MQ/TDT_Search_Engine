An outspoken regional president said Tuesday he's ready to sever his 
republic's financial ties to Moscow because it hasn't been receiving 
any federal funds for months. Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a billionaire who 
plans to run for Russian president, said in an interview on Russia's 
ORT television that he has ordered officials in his republic of Kalmykia 
not to turn over federal taxes they've already collected to the central 
government. ``We are ready to consider becoming an associate member 
of the Russian Federation, not violating the territorial integrity 
of Russia and remaining within the borders of Russia, but removing 
the budget of Kalmykia _ which isn't receiving any federal money now 
_ from the budget of Russia,'' he said. He did not rule out Kalmykia 
eventually seceding from Russia altogether, but he added, ``We want 
to be part of Russia. ... We're not preparing to leave, but they are 
putting us in such a position that we are ready to look at this option.'' 
Ilyumzhinov said Kalmykia, an impoverished republic on the Caspian 
Sea about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southeast of Moscow, hasn't 
received money for months, including pay for federal employees or 
cash for subsidized vaccinations for children. Many of Russia's 89 
regions have seized more control of their finances since the country 
fell into its latest economic crisis in August, freezing many federal 
subsidies and payments to government facilities, including hospitals 
and schools. Some governors have instituted controls on prices or 
imports.
