The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 18: The 
world's financial markets have calmed down since the Federal Reserve 
first moved to lower interest rates seven weeks ago. But economic 
problems remain, and the Fed acted wisely Tuesday when it imposed 
its third cut in two months. The rebound in the Dow Jones industrial 
average, which has made up nearly all its plunge of almost 20 percent 
this past summer, overstates the extent to which financial markets 
have rallied since the Fed signaled in late September that it was 
determined to fight the prospect of world recession. Markets in other 
countries, and for smaller stocks in this country, remain far below 
their peaks of earlier this year. Perhaps more important, there are 
still signs of credit stringency in the premium rates companies here 
and abroad must pay to borrow money. Those conditions have eased from 
the peak of panic in the summer, but are not back to normal. Most 
of Asia remains in recession, and it is too early to know whether 
the Brazilian rescue package will keep the Asian flu from infecting 
Latin America. Nonetheless, the Fed's decision Tuesday to lower the 
federal funds rate at which banks borrow from each other by a quarter-point, 
to 4.75 percent, was a relatively close call. That is because the 
American economy remains strong and consumers are still spending. 
There are signs that rampant speculation is returning, at least in 
Internet stocks. One such stock, Theglobe.com, was unable to sell 
stock just four weeks ago. But last week it sold shares at $9 each 
and saw the price leap to a high of $97 within minutes. It has since 
come back down to just over $40, but even that price shows a lot of 
optimism. Whether or not such optimism is warranted for Internet companies, 
the picture for the entire economy is mixed. While the chances of 
a recession have declined, the weak international economy means that 
corporate profits are not likely to be nearly as strong as they were 
in recent years. The Fed's pre-emptive rate cuts will help, but they 
cannot completely insulate the United States from international economic 
woes.
