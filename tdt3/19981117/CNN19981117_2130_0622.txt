The Leonid meteor shower raised expectations of a spectacular light 
show. And concern that orbiting satellites might be damaged. Rick 
Lockridge looks at what has happened in this edition of "tech trends. 
a blazing fireball coming straight from the constellation Orion. One 
of the stunning images captured by a plane flying high above the south 
china sea during the peak of the Leonid meteor shower. There were 
a few other dazzlers, but just a few. The Leonid meteors, instead 
of roaring like the lion they're named for, the constellation Leo, 
they seemed to purr along quietly. Still, few complained -- It has 
been great. We haven't seen a storm, I think, but it has been one 
of the best showers i've ever seen. We have some very nice data. I'm 
happy. In Japan, a peak viewing area, some spectators said they were 
awestruck that specks of dust from the tail of an old Comet could 
put on such a show. But these particular specks were colliding with 
the earth's atmosphere at nearly 50 miles a second, creating a lot 
of energy. When you have that much energy, things, even solid rock, 
burst in to flames when it hits the earth's atmosphere. Though some 
spectators might have been disappointed, the relatively limp leonids 
display might have been good for NASA, the Russian space agency and 
commercial satellite operators, as no damage to any of earth's nearly 
600 working spacecraft was immediately reported, and the two cosmonauts 
aboard Mir were unharmed. Most experts believe the storm is now past 
its peak, but they add that meteor showers are inherently unpredictable, 
and neither spectators nor satellite operators should give up on it 
just yet. If you didn't have a good seat for this year's leonids, 
some impressive images are showing up on dozens of web sites. Or you 
could wait until next year the best viewing? In Africa and the Middle 
East. Rick Lockridge, CNN, Atlanta.
