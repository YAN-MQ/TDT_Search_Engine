TIRANA, Albania (AP)- Special police units were guarding the stadium 
where Albania was scheduled to play Greece on Wednesday in the first 
international soccer game to take place in Albania since 1996. ``Special 
police units have been posted in and around the stadium since Sunday,''Interior 
Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said Tuesday. He said that there will 
be tight control of the fans on Wednesday before they enter the stadium. 
Albania's general police director Veton Gjoliku was put in charge 
of the police operations to secure the stadium, said Bizhga. The last 
international game played at Tirana's Qemal Stafa stadium was in November 
1996 against Armenia.
