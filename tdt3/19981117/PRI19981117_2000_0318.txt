Housing prices are rising faster than inflation in many cities. The 
national median price for an existing house was $132,700 in the third 
quarter, up nearly 5 percent from the same period a year before. That's 
more than double the retail inflation rate of around 2 percent. Prices 
were up the most on the west coast, and in some parts of the south.
