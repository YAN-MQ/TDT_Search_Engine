And Totenheim defender, Sol Campbell has been named the captain of 
England's squad for its friendly match against the Czech Republic 
at Wimbly Stadium on Wednesday. The 24 year-old was giving the captains 
arm band on Tuesday after Allen Shearer withdrew from the match because 
of a hamstring injury. With previous captains Paul Inse and Tony Adams 
also on the sidelines, Coach Glen Hoddle named Campbell, who captained 
the team against Belgium in a World Cup warm-up in Morocco last June. 
Hoddle says Campbell leads by example and the players respond well 
to him. The English coach says he expects the fans at Wimbly to get 
behind Campbell and the team. That's a look at sports this hour, I'm
