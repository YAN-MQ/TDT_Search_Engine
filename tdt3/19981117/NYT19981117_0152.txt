If you insist on perfection, here is what I have learned after roasting 
40 turkeys in search of it: You must brine the turkey in salt water 
the night before, and rotate it during roasting. A salt-water brine 
helps the turkey retain its juices and pleasantly seasons it from 
the skin right down to the bone. It's a simple process: dissolve two 
cups kosher salt (or one and a half cups table salt) in two gallons 
of water in a clean bucket or large stockpot. When the salt dissolves, 
drop in the turkey and refrigerate it overnight. When you are ready 
to roast, remove it from the brine, give it a quick rinse, and pat 
it dry. I have found a small bird, 12 to 14 pounds, tends to cook 
more evenly and stays juicier. After the turkey has been rinsed, brush 
the breast with melted butter, place it breast side down on a V-shaped 
rack over a pan, then brush the back with butter. Roast in a 400-degree 
oven for 45 minutes. Remove the turkey from the oven, baste it with 
butter, and with a large wad of paper towels in each hand, turn the 
turkey, wing up, and roast for 20 minutes. Remove the turkey from 
the oven, baste again, and then turn the turkey so that the other 
wing is up; roast for another 20 minutes. Remove the turkey again, 
baste, and turn it breast side up. Roast until an instant-read meat 
thermometer registers 170 to 175 degrees in the leg-thigh area or 
when juices run clear when thigh is pricked, 30 to 45 minutes. (The 
breast should register 160 to 165 degrees.) Larger turkeys (16 to 
22 pounds) require a slightly different technique. After its salt 
water bath, brush the breast with melted butter, place it breast side 
down on a V-rack, then brush the back with butter. Roast in a 250-degree 
oven for three hours, basting the back every hour. Remove the turkey 
from the oven and, with a large wad of paper towels in each hand, 
turn the turkey, breast side up; roast an hour. Increase the oven 
temperature to 400 degrees and roast until the skin has browned and 
a meat thermometer registers 170 to 175 degree. For more than 22 pounds, 
you're on your own.
