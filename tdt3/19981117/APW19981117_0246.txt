With offers of loans and investment worth more than U.S. dlrs 1 billion, 
Taiwan is quietly riding to the rescue of crisis-hit Southeast Asian 
nations, while side-stepping a diplomatic row with China. Taiwanese 
officials attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit have 
made a splash by unveiling a holding company, Southeast Asia Investments 
Co., that will funnel U.S. dlrs 300 million into the region's stock 
markets and companies. Its officials also are seeking to interest 
APEC countries in the possibility of collateralizing and repackaging 
bonds for stricken nations to allow them to raise much needed cash. 
Although most of the money comes from private sources, the government's 
high-profile backing of the measures at the APEC leaders summit has 
generated Chinese criticism. Taiwan also is negotiating a loan for 
Malaysia that would extend U.S. dlrs 1 billion as a prepayment for 
oil and natural gas. Taiwanese aid must be restricted to non-governmental 
channels, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told reporters 
at the summit. ``Our position on this is clear cut,'' Zhu said. ``Taiwan 
isn't a sovereign state.'' Though Taiwan is a full member of APEC, 
its top leader, President Lee Teng-hui, is barred from attending the 
forum's summits at China's insistence and must send a stand-in. China 
has claimed Taiwan as a renegade province since the sides split in 
1949, and refuses to recognize its government's legitimacy or right 
to international relations. In all, Taiwan has invested nearly U.S. 
dlrs 37 billion in the Southeast Asian region. Despite the Asian crisis, 
Taiwan's economy has remained one of the strongest in the region, 
an advantage it hopes to put to use countering China's efforts to 
isolate it. The timing and venue of Taipei's offers has highlighted 
what's becoming an increasingly tricky conflict: how Asian leaders 
balance their desperate need for cash - and Taiwan's willingness to 
provide it - with a wariness of angering China. The United States 
and Japan seem ready to leave Taiwan out of a plan to create a U.S. 
dlrs 5 billion fund to restructure Asian corporate debt. Taiwan has 
been a key advocate of such a plan, but Tokyo and Washington don't 
want to anger China. Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan's top economic planner 
and Lee's representative at the summit, called Beijing's efforts to 
block Taiwan's aid efforts ``nonsense.'' ``These countries are very 
keen to have capital because of the crisis,'' Chiang told Dow Jones 
Newswires. ``You mustn't forget that we are a sovereign state. We 
aren't a part of China.'' Andrew Hsia, Taiwan's main spokesman at 
APEC, said ``Taiwan is one of the few economies that is willing and 
able to do something. We not only have the right, but the obligation.''
