Eight six United Nation's weapons inspectors are back in Iraq. They're 
picking up the pieces of work hastily dropped when they evacuated 
last week. Spokeswoman Caroline Cross says the inspectors are keen 
to get back up to speed as soon as they can. Our main priority is 
to get the computer back on line, make sure the communications systems 
are working, etc. That's our first priority and we'll be back out 
in the field as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Iraqi opposition groups 
have been responding to President Clinton's statement that the U.S. 
is intensifying efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Hammed Bioti 
speaks for an Iraqi opposition group based in London. He said Iraqi's 
are capable of overthrowing Saddam themselves, given help. I think 
Iraqi people are capable to do the job. I think we are capable to 
overthrow Saddam if Iraqi forces were supported by the international 
community. Hammed Bioti.
