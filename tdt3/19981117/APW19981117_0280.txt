A private American school where four staff members face cruelty charges 
has been shut down and all its students have left the Czech Republic, 
the school's secretary said Tuesday. Martina Krystofova said that 
the Brno school's program for troubled American teen-agers was officially 
ended as a result of the police investigation. ``We closed down because 
of the consequences the investigation had,'' Krystofova said but did 
not elaborate. She said all the students left for the United States. 
Charges were filed last Wednesday against two American and two Czech 
employees of the Morava Academy whom police said kept some students 
isolated or tied up and prevented them from using the bathroom. School 
principal Glenda Roach and her husband Steven of St. George, Utah, 
along with two Czech employees, were charged with cruelty to people 
in their custody and with curtailing the students' freedom of movement. 
They face up to eight years in prison if convicted. All of those charged 
are currently free. Steven Roach was released on bail of 200,000 koruna 
(dlrs 6,600). Investigator Petr Netik said Tuesday that police took 
measures to prevent the American couple from leaving the country. 
``We, of course, did not take their passports away from them, but 
we won't let them cross the border if they try to leave,'' Netik said. 
He also said Czech police had asked the FBI for assistance. The school 
in Brno, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Prague, was run by 
the Morava Academy agency, partly owned by Ralph Atkin of St. George, 
Utah. The academy billed itself as a boarding school for American 
teen-agers who were neglecting school and had problems getting along 
with their families. A lawyer for the American couple, Robert Bezdek, 
said the children had serious problems at home, including drug problems. 
Police interviewed 25 of the school's 57 students earlier this month 
and eight complained of harsh punishments, according to police.
