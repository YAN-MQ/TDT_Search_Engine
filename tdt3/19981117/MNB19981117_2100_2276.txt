When we come back, more to tell you about why starting to tomorrow 
you might look for big changes in the republican party. Five cents. 
Five cents. Five cents... introducing AT&T one rate international 
plus with 5 cent weekends. Now calls across the country and to Canada 
are just 5 cents a minute all weekend long. Yeah, call your friends... 
call your relatives... call everybody you know! To get 5 cents a minute 
in the U.S. and great international rates as well, call now to enroll. 
Y# 1-800-833-3232 no, Monday is what? It's a weekday. That's right. 
That's right. It was one of those moments in life you want to keep. 
My husband thought he was getting dinner. My daughter...A new friend. 
Time to cook the lobster! When the moment came, I didn't have to worry 
about the light being low hey! That's my lobster! Or them turning 
out blurry because they were moving. With Kodak Max, I knew I'd get 
my picture. Low light, sunlight, action or still Kodak Max is all 
you need to know about film.
