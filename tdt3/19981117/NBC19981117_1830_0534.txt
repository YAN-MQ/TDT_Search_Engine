the federal reserve has spoken. And once again, interest rates are 
going down. Chairman Alan Greenspan said world financial markets are 
in better shape than they were a month ago, but unusual strains still 
remain. So two key rates are down another quarter point. What does 
it mean for you? Here's NBC chief financial correspondent Mike Jensen. 
The rate cut set off a wild rally on Wall Street. Mr. Greenspan, you 
did the right thing. I'm behind you 100%. Stocks shooting up 0 points 
in just five minutes after the fed announced it's cutting rates another 
quarter of a percentage point -- the third such cut in just two months. 
That means credit card rates will fall just in time for the crucial 
holiday shopping season. Willie tatum, an electronic engineer, Christmas 
shopping in Manhattan. I can go out and splurge a little bit on Christmas 
rather than taking a lot out of pocket cash. In the last three months, 
credit card rates have come down from 15% to less than 14%. Auto loans. 
Down in three months from 9% to 8.8%. so far, home mortgages have 
bucked the trend, averaging 6.9%. but with today's cut by the fed, 
they're expected to start back down again. Mark zichelli of Montclair, 
New Jersey -- The lowering of the rates would definitely allow me 
to either refinance on my existing home or possibly look to spend 
more money on a newer home. All this, good news for borrowers, but 
not for retirees like marion brick of Texas, who invests in things 
like CDs. I will have less return by them lowering the interest rates, 
so I can't see that this is a good thing at all. Six month CD rates 
have fallen in three months from 4.7% to 4.2%. the federal reserve 
cut rates today because it's determined to keep this economic boom 
alive. So determined, analysts say, the fed could do it again at its 
next meeting three days before Christmas, if the economy shows any 
signs of faltering. Mike Jensen, NBC news, New York.
