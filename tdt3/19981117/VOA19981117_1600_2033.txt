The senior US Envoy is in North Korea for talks about a suspected 
underground nuclear facility. A US surveillance satellite is reported 
to have spotted the massive construction project north of Yung Byung 
in August. VOA's Chalice McDonnah reports the State Department, the 
US delegation is pushing hard for access to this sight. State Department 
Spokesman James Rubin says Envoy Charles Cartman is in Pyung Yang 
to press for access to the underground facility. Mr. Ruban says denial 
of access to the sight would call into question the viability of a 
1994 nuclear accord. Under that accord, North Korea agreed to freeze 
its nuclear development program in exchange for fuel oil and two western 
built nuclear power reactors. We did make it clear to the North Koreans 
during the first day of discussions, that verbal assurances will not 
suffice. We're pressing for concrete action, including access to clarify 
the nature of the underground construction. The state department spokes 
man says he does not think Mr. Cartman will travel to the suspect 
sight during his visit. The talks began Monday and are expected to 
end Wednesday. Challice McDonnah, VOA News, Washington.
