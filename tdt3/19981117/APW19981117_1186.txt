George Foreman and Larry Holmes went through the motions of grilling 
hamburgers for kids on Tuesday. But the two old former heavyweight 
champions say there's no way they will just be going through the motions 
Jan. 23. ``Once that bell rings all we know is competing, winning, 
fighting,'' said Foreman, who will fight Holmes in the Houston Astrodome 
13 days after he turns 50. ``I'm not here for my health,'' said Holmes, 
who became 49 Nov. 3. ``I'm here to let you know I'm fighting a fight. 
My style would have beaten George Foreman 20 years ago, and my style 
will beat him this time.'' Foreman drew laughs when he said, ``I'll 
be two hundredahhhhh.'' He has not weighed less than 250 pounds (113 
kilograms) since he weighed 244 pounds (110 pounds) in 1988, the second 
year of his comeback from a 10-year retirement. ``I'm not going to 
run,'' Foreman said. ``I don't know how. I don't even do road work.'' 
Pride is at stake in ``The Birthday Bash,'' which will be carried 
on pay-per-view for dlrs 39.95. Pride, however, is not the only thing 
getting these elderly pros into the ring. Foreman is getting dlrs 
10 million and Holmes dlrs 4 million. Foreman and Holmes were in New 
York for a round of television and radio interviews and for what was 
more a photo opportunity than a news conference. The two men donned 
chef's jackets and Holmes put on a tall hat to pose as a hamburger 
griller for 30 children (ages 8-13) from the Salvation Army's Bushwick 
Center in Brooklyn. Fortunately for the kids, Foreman and Holmes, 
weren't grilling for real because the cooks might have gotten into 
sampling their own fare. The children were served lunch later. Both 
men have said several times their boxing careers are over. ``This 
is a fight surely to end all fights,'' Foreman said. Then he smiled. 
``I ain't ever going to say never again,'' Holmes said. ``I'm tired 
of lying to you guys.'' Then he said, ``I want to fight Mike Tyson 
(who knocked Holmes out in 1988) right after I beat George Foreman. 
If he (Tyson) hurts me, I can bite his ears off.''
