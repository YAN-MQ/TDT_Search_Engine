President Clinton leaves Washington Wednesday for a trip to Japan 
and South Korea, two key Asian Allies currently experiencing economic 
downturns. White House officials say that discussions in both countries 
will focus on a common agenda. Correspondent Nick Simeon reports President 
Clinton is expected to take up differences Washington has with its 
Asian allies over trade and economic matters. US officials say the 
President's trip comes at a significant point in time for the world 
economic situation as well as for relations between Washington and 
its Asian allies. A day after announcing a multi-billion dollar financial 
support package to help bolster Asian economies, US officials are 
emphasizing they want Japan to do more to remove trade barriers and 
are concerned about a surge of imports of Japanese steel. Currently 
US exports to Japan are down 12 percent. Jean Spurling is the President's 
National Economic Advisor. There is no question we've had some very 
real differences of opinion on areas we think are critical to gaining 
economic strength in the region, and we'll speak candidly and frankly 
to those individual matters as we have for some time. During his stop 
in Tokyo, the President will meet privately with Japan's emperor and 
hold a town meeting with young Japanese. In South Korea, Mr. Clinton's 
discussion with President Kim Dae Jung will include regional security, 
in particular North Korea's nuclear and missile program. Nick Simeon
