Armed men massacred eight people and injured 10 others in an overnight 
attack south of Algiers, authorities said. The attackers slit the 
throats of most of the victims and burned their houses, according 
to hospital workers. The attack took place about 150 kilometers (93 
miles) south of Algiers near Ain Defla, authorities said in a brief 
statement on state radio. There was no claim of responsibility and 
no further details were provided on the attack, which occurred in 
an area where Islamic insurgents are thought to be hiding out. Such 
attacks are blamed by authorities on the Armed Islamic Group, the 
radical insurgency movement trying to topple this North African nation's 
military-backed government. The attack occurred less than five weeks 
before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan _ usually marked 
by a surge in violence since the start of the insurgency in 1992. 
The insurgency was triggered by the military-backed government's decision 
to cancel legislative elections that the now-banned Islamic Salvation 
Front was poised to win. An estimated 75,000 people _ civilians, soldiers 
and insurgents _ have been killed in the violence.
