A New York grand jury has decided not to indict Khallid Abdul Muhammad 
for his actions at the end of a Harlem rally in September that erupted 
in violence, prosecutors said Tuesday. The decision angered city officials, 
who had said the black leader tried to incite a riot at the event. 
Instead, the grand jury indicted six other people on charges of attempted 
assault and reckless endangerment. The violence started after police 
officers in riot gear moved in on the speaker's podium at the rally. 
The violent end to the Sept. 5 event, which organizers had called 
the Million Youth March, led both Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police 
Commissioner Howard Safir to call for the arrest of Muhammad on charges 
of inciting a riot. They said he urged people at the rally to fight 
back if the police confronted them. The Manhattan district attorney's 
office said it had reviewed 26 videotapes of the event and interviewed 
more than 50 witnesses in its investigation. But investigators were 
able to identify only one of the six people indicted _ James Washington, 
who surrendered to the police just after the rally after being recorded 
on videotape punching a police officer. Law enforcement officials 
with knowledge of the investigation, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity, said prosecutors presented evidence to support indicting 
the six on rioting charges, but that the grand charge declined to 
do so. Since the grand jury was unwilling to say anyone had rioted, 
law enforcement officials said, there was no way to charge Muhammad 
with inciting a riot. Safir expressed disappointment, saying he still 
believed that Muhammad, a man he once referred to as a ``Black Hitler,'' 
was guilty of inciting a riot. ``I've been in this business over 30 
years,'' he said, ``and I've seen grand juries do things that are 
in my view illogical. But that's the criminal justice system, and 
so be it.'' Muhammad could not be reached Tuesday night. After the 
rally, the police were sharply criticized by some neighborhood leaders 
for blocking access to the event, and then moving in too quickly and 
too forcefully to shut it down.
