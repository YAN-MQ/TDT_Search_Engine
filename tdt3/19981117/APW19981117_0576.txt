German authorities warned Tuesday that a food blackmailer may be targeting 
Nestle, just as police said they had arrested a man who tried to extort 
25 million marks (dlrs 15 million) in diamonds from the company. Police 
said they nabbed Alexandru Nemeth, 43, by tracking carrier pigeons 
with which he had ordered the company to deliver the diamonds in September. 
Frankfurt police chief Wolfhard Hoffmann said Nemeth was suspected 
of trying to blackmail Thomy, a Nestle brand, by poisoning supermarket 
products with cyanide in at least 20 German cities over the last two 
years. No one was hurt in the incidents. Police said Nemeth denied 
involvement, and they were seeking accomplices. In Baden-Wuerttemberg 
state, authorities warned people certain Nestle products sold by a 
supermarket chain Saturday may have been tampered with, and asked 
them to check for damaged packaging, or strange odor or color. It 
was not immediately clear whether the two cases were connected. Nestle 
said it was ``relieved, happy and thankful'' about the arrest, but 
didn't comment on the possibility of a second blackmail attempt. Nemeth, 
a Romanian of German descent, allegedly began his poisoning spree 
in August 1996. Police traced many of the tainted foods, informed 
by the attacker who apparently wanted to prove he was serious. Last 
December, he allegedly delivered poisoned Christmas chocolates to 
randomly chosen homes. He later left a cyanide-poisoned drink in a 
Cologne playground. Police say Nemeth finally directed Thomy in September 
to a car with 12 carrier pigeons and small sacks for the diamonds 
he had demanded. Using helicopters, police tracked the pigeons to 
a garden plot outside Frankfurt rented by Nemeth. He was arrested 
the next day, Sept. 26, in the town of Eschborn. The diamonds never 
were delivered, police said. Police gave no explanation for the delay 
in their announcement.
