On the day that Steve Phillips returned to work as general manager 
of the Mets after an eight-day leave of absence, one of Phillips' 
assistants, Jim Duquette, went to work on trying to plug one of the 
team's main holes. Late Tuesday afternoon, Duquette offered Gregg 
Clifton, the agent for B.J. Surhoff, a three-year deal for the 34-year-old 
outfielder. Clifton did not reveal the amount of the offer, but it 
was believed to be for $12.75 million _ or about the same offer Surhoff 
has been made by the Baltimore Orioles, for whom he hit .279 with 
22 homers and 92 runs batted in last season. To complicate matters 
for both the Mets and Orioles, the Pittsburgh Pirates have jumped 
into the bidding for Surhoff. ``We have received a four-year proposition 
from Pittsburgh for a substantial amount,'' said Clifton, who would 
not reveal the offer. But it was believed to be for a little under 
$20 million. The low-budget Pirates do not usually shop around offering 
that kind of money. But at least one person involved with major league 
baseball reasoned Tuesday that with a new stadium opening in Pittsburgh 
in 2000, the Pirates might be trying to show fans that they are serious 
about competing, while trying to sell some corporate suites. Clifton, 
who works for Woolf Associates, said he had told the Mets of the Pirates' 
offer for Surhoff, a 12-year veteran who was born in the Bronx, went 
to high school in Rye, N.Y., and apparently remains interested in 
playing for the Mets. The feeling was that he would stay with the 
Orioles if Baltimore's and New York's offers were the same. ``We appreciate 
the Mets' offer,'' said Clifton, who characterized Surhoff as being 
``very excited about the Pirates' four-year proposal.'' Should the 
Mets sign Surhoff, he would likely play left field in an outfield 
with Brian McRae in center and the newly reacquired Bobby Bonilla 
in right. Should the Mets lose out on Surhoff, they might be in trouble 
in their search for another corner outfielder. Brian Jordan is scheduled 
to visit Shea Stadium Thursday morning. But Jordan, a Cardinal since 
1992, has already met with the Braves, will meet with the Yankees 
this morning and with the Orioles Thursday afternoon. The Yankees, 
Braves and Orioles all could probably outbid the Mets for Jordan, 
who mainly plays right field. ``Our meeting with the Braves was extremely 
productive,'' Jordan's agent, Jim Turner, said Tuesday. ``We told 
them we'd like to consummate a deal by Thanksgiving. And they're all 
for it.'' As for the Mets' other needs _ a second or third baseman 
and/or a leadoff hitter _ John Boggs, the agent for Robin Ventura, 
is hoping he hears from the Mets soon. Ventura, a third baseman, has 
apparently narrowed his list to five core teams: the Indians, the 
Mets, the Red Sox, the Cardinals and the Padres. But the Mets would 
probably have to ante up four or five years in excess of $8 million 
a season to sign him. The left-handed-hitting Ventura would be a formidable 
presence batting behind the right-handed Mike Piazza and in front 
of the switch-hitting Bonilla in the Mets' order. The Mets could also 
become interested in the free-agent second basemen Roberto Alomar 
(who apparently has only received an offer from the Indians) or Delino 
DeShields (who could solve the Mets' leadoff problems). That, of course, 
is up to Phillips _ although the Mets apparently are still operating 
as a negotiating team (Duquette is the team's director of player personnel) 
until Phillips settles back into his everyday role. Thursday, Phillips 
spent a good part of his time in meetings at Shea, which included 
the co-owner Fred Wilpon and the team's vice president, David Howard. 
Howard said that a threatened sexual harassment lawsuit against the 
Mets and Phillips still had not been filed. Phillips did not return 
phone calls Thursday. But Howard said the Mets, with Phillips back, 
were ``getting our game plan together. We're ready to go. In fact, 
we're going as we speak.''
