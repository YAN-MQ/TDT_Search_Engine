Investors unimpressed by relatively strong earnings from some of the 
nation's largest retailers, J.C. Penney said profits jumped 65%, ahead 
of Wall Street expectations. Penney said store sales were weaker than 
expected but said catalog, drugstore and direct marketing sales were 
strong. Profits at Dayton Hudson grew 14%, in line with expectations, 
but investors are punishing the stock. Dayton Hudson is the owner 
of target and mervyn's stores.
