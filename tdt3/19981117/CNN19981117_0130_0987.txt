The videotaped testimony from chairman Bill Gates drew laughter from 
the judge Monday, in the government's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. 
Steve young explains why. The government once again used videotape 
of Bill Gates to attack the Microsoft chairman and his company. His 
pretrial testimony was about Microsoft's worries about Netscape two 
years ago. Gates referred then to browser share, which plays into 
the government's argument that Internet browsers are a separate software 
product. On the tape, government lawyer David boies confronts Gates 
with one of his own E-mails. "Winning Internet browser share is a 
very, very important goal for us." The government says Microsoft bundled 
its browser in windows to mow down netscape's wide market lead. But 
in an exchange typical of Gates' evasive style, the Microsoft chairman 
wouldn't concede Netscape concerned him. I don't know, what you mean 
"concerned"? What is it about the word "concerned" that you don't 
understand? I'm not sure what you mean by it. Is there a document 
where I use that term? Is the term "concerned" a term that you're 
familiar with in the English language? yes. Gates said he didn't remember 
writing the sentence and doesn't know what he meant by it. Gates argued 
he wasn't talking about browser share. What he really was talking 
about was browser usage share. There were peals of laughter in the 
court. The judge shook his head, then he laughed, too. Government 
witness Glenn weadock said many companies don't like the integrated 
browser in Windows 98 because they want to prevent employees from 
surfing the Internet. But Microsoft argued back, that for most companies, 
integration is a Convenience. And it said the government handpicked 
companies for weadock to survey, so it handed him a stacked deck. 
The government says it used ten companies that own 600,000 PCs. The 
mere fact that you have substantial numbers of customers who want 
a Choice that they're being deprived of is part of-- a part of what's 
at issue. The case has been moving at a glacial pace. We may get through 
two witnesses this week, which, for this trial, would be warp speed.
