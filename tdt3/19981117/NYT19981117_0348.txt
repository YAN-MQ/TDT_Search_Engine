Americans rate the quality of the classroom teacher as the most important 
element in lifting student achievement, ahead of stronger curriculum 
and stricter discipline, according to the results of a poll released 
Tuesday. The poll by the nonprofit Washington organization Recruiting 
New Teachers and Louis Harris and Associates tested respondents on 
a range of subjects related to teaching quality, including salaries 
and approaches to school change. It was done as a way to gauge public 
interest in a topic educators and policy makers view as increasingly 
important in light of an estimated need for 2.2 million new teachers 
in the next decade to meet growing enrollments and replace retirees. 
The telephone poll of 1,504 adults, who were asked 42 multiple-choice 
questions, has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. 
The Philip Morris Companies Inc. provided a $130,000 grant to finance 
the poll, whose results were compiled in a report, ``The Essential 
Profession.'' The poll showed that most Americans, 56 percent, would 
consider a career in teaching if the salary was at least $60,000, 
and 81 percent would recommend it to a family member if the pay was 
that high. The national average for public school teachers is about 
$38,000. And, when asked which of eight professions was most beneficial 
to the country, teachers ranked first, ahead of doctors, accountants 
and lawyers. But when asked which profession they would recommend 
to a family member, teaching ranked second _ 39 percent _ to medicine 
_ 40 percent. Respondents in some cases were out of step with the 
thinking of policy makers seeking to improve the quality of teachers. 
Contrary to movements afoot in several states, for example, the poll 
found that just over a third of Americans felt that earning a master's 
degree from an accredited school of education was necessary. And despite 
efforts nationwide to raise curriculum standards, 90 percent of the 
respondents rated a well-qualified teacher as the most important element 
in improving student learning, ahead of a challenging curriculum, 
77 percent; strict discipline, 77 percent; reduced class size, 56 
percent; and school uniforms, 16 percent. When asked if they favored 
allowing parents to use public money in the form of vouchers for private 
education or ``doing what it takes to get qualified teachers in every 
classroom,'' 84 percent of the respondents chose the latter. ``A lot 
of the findings do not necessarily run counter to common sense,'' 
said David Haselkorn, president of Recruiting New Teachers, ``but 
they do run counter to what has been seen as common wisdom in school 
reform in the last 10 years.'' The poll did not ask respondents how 
they ranked improving teacher education against other concerns like 
lowering crime or improving the environment. And it did not delve 
into the thornier issue of education financing and how much money 
should be devoted to improving teaching. Eric Hirsch, a senior policy 
specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures, a research 
group based in Denver, said that policy makers would agree with much 
of the poll's findings but that the larger question was how best to 
enact changes. Hirsch noted, for example, that several states had 
raised minimum teacher salaries in the past few year but nowhere near 
$60,000. He predicted that such moves would be complicated by voters' 
distaste for the higher taxes that might be necessary to achieve those 
higher salaries. ``Quality teaching is such a complex issue when it 
comes to salary, recruitment and retention that a lot of states are 
just now trying to assess what programs they have in place,'' said 
Hirsch, who called teacher quality ``one of the most talked about 
pressing issues in state legislatures.'' Gordon Ambach, executive 
director of the Council of Chief State Schools Officers, a lobbying 
group in Washington, said that although most Americans told pollsters 
they supported improving education, spending money on it was another 
matter. ``Only about 20 percent of adults now have children in school,'' 
said Ambach, who served as New York State education commissioner from 
1977 to 1987. ``That makes a difference in the willingness to support 
education.'' Still, the view of teacher quality as a leading component 
in improving education matches what education experts increasingly 
have been saying. ``Only in the past decade has there been a strong 
movement in education renewal toward the view that the teacher is 
of primary importance,'' said John Goodland, director of the Center 
for Education Renewal at the University of Washington and a leading 
scholar on teacher training. ``This a relatively new concept. We examined 
school reform reports for the entire century and none mention teacher 
education until 1986.''
