You may not know his name, but odds are Robert smigel has made you 
laugh. The comedian has written memorable skits for both "Saturday 
night live" and "Late night with Conan O'Brien." Bill Tush reports 
on his latest work. Since joining the writing staff of "Saturday night 
live" back in 1985, Robert smigel's come up with a lot of bits. None 
perhaps more popular than those mustachioed sports fans from Chicago 
who sit around guzzling beer and praising "da bears," or in this case, 
the windy city's other pro team. Da Bulls. Da Bulls! All right. But 
after eight years of cranking out material at "snl," it was time for 
a break. It's awful. Really, like, sometimes we have like two-week 
breaks, and I could not get out of bed for the first week. Smigel's 
break didn't last long. He signed on to create a new talk show starring 
the then-unknown Conan o'Brien. And there was a cartoon called "clutch 
cargo" that he used to watch as a Kid that inspired him to create 
Conan's signature piece. If we're going to save captain, we've got 
to get moving. Come on fellows, back to the plane. I immediately thought, 
"oh, now we don't have to hire a million actors and put them in makeup. 
We can do this incredibly cheesy thing and it will be much funnier." 
And born was this bit. It doesn't really have a name, but it is funny. 
You're the last one left that -- who hasn't come out against me. Oh, 
no, no, sir, I like you. I think you're a nice guy. Thanks. Want to 
go get high? no! We just saw it as a practical joke on Bill Clinton's 
face. So you don't want the accurate -- "I'm Bill clinton kind of 
thing." We just wanted -- you want to see that picture accompanied 
by a -- "Nee-haw, how you doin' everybody," kind of insanity. Well, 
hey there, it's -- Whoo-wee. Yeah, great. Anniversary. Yeah. From 
there, smigel moved on to animation and back to "Saturday night live" 
where they run his segments, one called be "real audio." We take the 
audio of the guy and we play with the visual and screw around with 
that and humiliate the person and hurt him and his family that way. 
"Saturday night live" should be called "Saturday night dead." What 
has all this led to? For smigel -- work, work and more work, and possibly 
another series of his own. Well, let's cross our fingers that it doesn't 
get picked up, because I have a wife and a baby now and I'd like to 
see them. Bill Tush, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
