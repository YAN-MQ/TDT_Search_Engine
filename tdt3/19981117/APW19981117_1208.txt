Russia on Tuesday criticized Washington's calls for overthrowing Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein, but said the crisis must be resolved soon, 
once and for all. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement 
that the calls ``clash with the norms and principles of international 
law.'' ``The (U.N.) Security Council's resolutions must be carried 
out, but one mustn't forget that they also state the need to respect 
Iraq's sovereignty and political independence. The decision on what 
government Iraq will have is a prerogative of the Iraqi people.'' 
Saddam has repeatedly limited access for U.N. weapons inspectors in 
Iraq, then eased up when the United States threatened air strikes, 
then cracked down again. Now, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright are openly calling for overthrowing Saddam 
and pledging support to opposition groups in Iraq. While the Russian 
Foreign Ministry statement criticized the U.S. position, it also said 
the recent developments around Iraq ``have demonstrated the need for 
the quickest settlement of the problem.'' ``Otherwise, dramatic splashes 
of tensions around Iraq will again and again agitate the world community,'' 
it said. Iraq owes Moscow billions of dollars from Soviet times, when 
the Arab nation was a big arms buyer, and Russia wants the conflict 
around Iraq resolved so it can begin collecting debts.
