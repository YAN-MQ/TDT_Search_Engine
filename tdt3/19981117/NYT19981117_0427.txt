The Giuliani administration agreed Tuesday to release most of the 
$150 million that it had withheld from nonprofit groups since July, 
completing a budget deal with the City Council that also eliminates 
a 12.5 percent surcharge on the personal income tax of New York City 
residents. The compromise came after a five-month standoff between 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who had 
pushed for both the release of the money for the nonprofit groups 
and the elimination of the surcharge. Although Giuliani had initially 
opposed eliminating the surcharge, he said Tuesday that he had changed 
his mind months ago. For its part of the deal, the council agreed 
to save $165 million it had earmarked for debt reduction, putting 
the money into a reserve fund instead, as the mayor had insisted. 
It also agreed to allot $15 million for renovations to the Museum 
of Modern Art, something else Giuliani had wanted, but that the council 
cut from the budget in the spring. The council also agreed to phase 
in weekly recycling throughout the city during two years, instead 
of immediately. ``There is no more question about the funding of the 
budget,'' a beatific Vallone said at a Tuesday afternoon news conference. 
``And hopefully, we will be able to propel the city into the next 
century not only in good fiscal shape, but with the quality-of-life 
items that must be part of the greatest city in the world.'' Aides 
to Vallone said the Giuliani administration had agreed to release 
all but $20 million of the $150 million that the council approved 
in June as part of the $34 billion city budget. The council had earmarked 
the money for public schools, nonprofit agencies and community groups, 
but Giuliani refused to spend it, saying it was nothing but pork-barrel 
spending meant to improve Vallone's chances in the race for governor. 
During his campaign, Vallone accused the mayor of withholding the 
money because the speaker opposed his plan to use tax money to build 
a new Yankee Stadium in Manhattan. Although both men insisted the 
battle was more about money than politics, it ended the day after 
Vallone lost the governor's race, when they met for the first time 
in months and agreed to fashion a compromise. Vallone and his staff 
appeared more excited about the budget agreement than did Giuliani, 
who gruffly said he was releasing the money only because the council 
had agreed to cuts in other areas. In particular, Giuliani said he 
was happy that the council was shifting $165 million from debt reduction 
into the reserve fund, which will now have a total of $465 million. 
``I will achieve the overall objective of keeping spending way below 
the rate of inflation,'' Giuliani said of the compromise, ``which 
is the way that any executive has to discipline a legislature.'' The 
mayor said he had stopped resisting the elimination of the income 
tax surcharge because it would expire on Dec. 31, and the city could 
not continue it without the State state Legislature's approval. He 
said the city would have to make budget cuts during the next few years 
to make up for the loss of the 12.5 percent surcharge, which brings 
the city $550 million a year in tax revenues. ``My objection to the 
tax cut was not doing the tax cut,'' Giuliani said in a news conference. 
``It was the order in which it was done. First you should reduce the 
spending, then you cut the taxes.'' For a married couple with two 
children and annual earnings of $50,000, the elimination of the surcharge 
will save about $123 a year. A single person earning $50,000 will 
save almost twice that amount, and a single parent with two children 
and earnings of $50,000 will save $177. Most of the money that Giuliani 
had been withholding during his standoff with Vallone will pay for 
social and cultural programs, including foster-care and day-care programs, 
meals delivered at home and other programs for the elderly, library 
programs, and alternatives to jail. About $8 million will be used 
for weekly recycling pickups by the city, which will be phased into 
every sanitation district over 18 months. Despite all the talk in 
City Hall about saving money through the compromise, the city budget 
is actually increasing by about $600 million _ from $34.1 billion 
to $34.7 billion _ to absorb unforeseen costs like police overtime 
and a health insurance rate increase for city workers, aides to Vallone 
said. But unanticipated tax revenues and state and federal funds will 
cover most of the added costs, they said. The nonprofit groups that 
had been caught up in the budget fight had complained bitterly, saying 
the loss of revenue had affected services for children, the elderly 
and the poor. Most never had to cut services, but they were not able 
to meet an increasing demand for their programs. Some took out loans, 
while others sought out private and state grants. As part of the budget 
compromise, the city's allocation to the groups was cut by a total 
of $20 million. But officials of several nonprofit groups said that 
their organizations could endure the loss. For the Legal Aid Society, 
it means receiving only half of the extra $10 million that the City 
Council had allotted for the organization. ``We are happy to get just 
half of it, because half the year is already gone,'' said Danny Greenberg, 
president of the Legal Aid Society. ``With this money we will be able 
to hire more lawyers and other staff.'' Throughout the budget battle, 
the mayor has pointed to the recent uncertainty on Wall Street and 
warned that the city could soon face serious financial problems. But 
Vallone cheerfully predicted Tuesday that the next budget process 
_ which gets under way in January _ would be easier. ``We are beginning 
the new budget sequence, which begins just two months from now, in 
very good shape,'' he said. ``The city is as secure financially as 
it could possibly be.''
