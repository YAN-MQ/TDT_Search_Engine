Angolan government troops have launched an operation aimed at capturing 
the traditional strongholds of the Unita rebel movement in the country's 
central highlands. VOA correspondent Alex Bolita reports from the 
Angolan capitol, Luanda. Angolan military officials say government 
troops have encircled the area around the towns of Andulu and Bymundu, 
until now the headquarters of Unita leader Jonas Savimbi. Fighting 
has been reported and witnesses say government casualties have been 
transported to the hospital in Quito about 100 kilometers to the southeast. 
No details are known on the scale of the fighting or the number of 
dead and wounded on either side. Intelligence sources say the government 
side hopes to have control over the area within a matter of days. 
However these same sources say Unita's high command, including Mr. 
Savimbi appear to have fled further east. Other sources familiar with 
plans for the operation say, the governments hope was to mount a surprise 
attack with the aim of capturing or killing the Unita leadership. 
They say authorities in Luanda the Angolan capitol believe this would 
cause any remaining Unita resistance to collapse. Government troops 
would then conduct cleanup operations in Unita controlled areas to 
the east and southeast of the central highlands. Confirmation of the 
long awaited offensive came after the UN World Food Program reported 
one of its truck convoys was halted by government troops while traveling 
Sunday on a key road ear the city of Huambo in the central highlands. 
UN authorities have had no official comment on the situation, however 
there are unconfirmed reports that UN officials, who traveled out 
of Huambo on Monday to check on the blockade, were fired on, possibly 
by Unita forces involved with fighting with government troops. Efforts 
to reach Unita officials by satellite telephone have been unsuccessful. 
The government in Luanda recently broke off all contact with Unita 
leader Savimbi, calling him a war criminal who has refused to honor 
his commitments to demilitarize the rebel movement under the terms 
of Angola's 1994 peace agreement. Alex Bolita VOA News, Luanda.
