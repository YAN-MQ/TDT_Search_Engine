The Maui melody performed by Hawaiian slack key guitarist Barney Isaacs 
and George Kuo, puts the musical wraps on today's show. I'm Lisa Mullins, 
inviting you to join us again tomorrow for another spin of the World. 
The World is a co-production of the BBC world service, Public Radio 
International and WGBH Boston and is made possible in part by the 
PRI program fund, whose contributors include the Ford Foundation, 
the John D. and Catherine T. McArthur Foundation and the Theresa and 
H. John Heinz III Foundation. PRI, Public Radio International.
