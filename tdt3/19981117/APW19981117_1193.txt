Russia on Tuesday criticized Washington's calls for overthrowing Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein, but said the crisis must be resolved soon, 
once and for all. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement 
that the calls ``clash with the norms and principles of international 
law.'' ``The (U.N.) Security Council's resolutions must be carried 
out, but one mustn't forget that they also state the need to respect 
Iraq's sovereignty and political independence. The decision on what 
government Iraq will have is a prerogative of the Iraqi people.'' 
Saddam has repeatedly banned U.N. weapons inspectors from his country, 
then allowed them to return when the United States threatened air 
strikes, then banned them again. The game has cost Saddam little or 
no erosion of his power inside Iraq, and allowed him to avoid meeting 
U.N. demands. Now, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright are openly calling for overthrowing Saddam and 
pledging support to opposition groups in Iraq. While the Russian Foreign 
Ministry statement criticized the U.S. position, it also said the 
recent developments around Iraq ``have demonstrated the need for the 
quickest settlement of the problem.'' ``Otherwise, dramatic splashes 
of tensions around Iraq will again and again agitate the world community,'' 
it said. Iraq owes Moscow billions of dollars from Soviet times, when 
the Arab nation was a big arms buyer, and Russia wants the conflict 
around Iraq resolved so it can begin collecting debts.
