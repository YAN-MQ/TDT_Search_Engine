Right about now, the biggest shooting star show in more than 30 years 
is reaching its peak in the skies above north America. Unfortunately, 
we can't see it. Asian countries have had the best view so far of 
the leonids meteor shower, but Californians got a glimpse last night. 
The shower is the result of earth's annual passage through the tail 
of comet tempel-tuttle. The tiny, fast-moving particles of space dust 
could damage some satellites, but they pose no danger to people.
