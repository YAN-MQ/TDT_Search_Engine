Israeli peace activists demanded Tuesday that the army dismantle seven 
Jewish settlement outposts on remote West Bank hills and said they 
would appeal to the Supreme Court if the order was not given by the 
end of the week. The outposts, consisting of several trailers each, 
have been set up since last month's Mideast peace summit during which 
Israel agreed to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the 
end of January. Jewish settler leaders said they have been setting 
up the outposts because they do not want the land to fall into Palestinian 
hands in the future. They were encouraged earlier this week by Israeli 
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon who said settlers ``should move, should 
run, should grab more hills, expand the territory.'' U.S. State Department 
spokesman James Rubin said Monday that Sharon's statement served to 
``undermine the trust and confidence'' needed to make peace. Sharon's 
ministry, in turn, said in a statement Tuesday that it was ``taken 
aback'' by Rubin's comments, saying Sharon's point had been the need 
to strengthening existing settlements. However, the Israeli daily 
Haaretz said Sharon's call to seize hilltops appeared to be contradicting 
a quiet pledge by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the United 
States more than a year ago that settlements would only be expanded 
to ``immediately contiguous'' areas. This would exclude the settling 
of areas several hills removed from the nearest built-up land, Haaretz 
said. Haaretz said the understanding was confirmed by five different 
Israeli and U.S. officials. The newspaper said the Americans accepted 
the limited pledge because Netanyahu made it clear that his coalition 
would not accept a settlement freeze. In a speech to parliament Monday, 
Netanyahu denied that he had accepted any restrictions on Jewish settlement 
building. Concerning the latest settlement outposts, the Israeli group 
Peace Now and opposition legislator Dedi Zucker said Tuesday they 
have asked Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in writing to dismantle 
them. If this is not done by the end of the week, Zucker said, the 
activists would ask the Supreme Court to step in. Zucker said the 
settlers are breaking the law and that the Israeli army, which is 
in charge of enforcing the law in West Bank areas under its control, 
is required to take action. In recent weeks, Israeli soldiers have 
made no efforts to dismantle the seven outposts, Zucker said. However, 
troops did thwart the latest attempt Monday in which settlers from 
the Kedumim settlement seized a hill and set up two mobile homes. 
Troops ordered the settlers to leave. The Defense Ministry said it 
had not received the Peace Now letter and had no comment.
