The defending champion Broncos have become the first team since the 
1991 redskins to start the season 10-0. Tonight, Denver embarrassed 
Kansas city 30-7. Bubby brister filled for the injured John Elway 
and rumbled 38 yards for a Touchdown. Terrell Davis racked up a 41-yard 
score. The cheers are 4-6r. I'm apologizing to you, to this community. 
Because I'm embarrassed.
