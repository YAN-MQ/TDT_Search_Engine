The 37 now infamous tapes are shockingly candid. As Linda Tripp and 
her young friend Monica discuss hair, the president's anatomy, the 
the art of lying under oath, and, of course, sex. Sometimes Lewinsky 
seems worldly, other times, fragile. This exchange when Clinton had 
not called her. Linda Tripp taped conversations to protect herself, 
she says, once she became aware of wrongdoing. From the outset, she 
appears to manipulate Lewinsky and gathers evidence against the president. 
October 6, Tripp helps Monica draft a letter to the president, upping 
her job demands. October 23, Tripp Stokes Monica's anger towards Clinton. 
If he for one minute considered someone doing this to his daughter. 
November 20, Tripp urges Monica to keep the blue dress with the president's 
d.N.A. as insurance. The next day, a major betrayal. Tripp secretly 
tells a lawyer for Paul Jones about Monica's relationship with the 
president. December 22, on whether the president knows Monica will 
lie under oath. In January, Tripp takes her evidence to Starr, who 
has the F.B.I. wire her to probe for more facts damaging to Clinton. 
And deny it, he did. Linda Tripp had nothing to do with that decision 
to lie or with the president's decision to get involved with an intern 
in the first place. But without Tripp and her tapes, chances are the 
president would never have been caught. Lisa Myers, NBC news, Washington. 
For those who missed their first airing, we will have more excerpts 
from the tapes a bit later on in this hour. Reaction from the White 
House was both brief and predictable, just as the airwaves -- both 
radio and television -- were filled with nothing but the tapes, it 
seemed, nationwide. And the White House briefing room, presidential 
jokesman Joe Lockhart said he expects most people would pay little 
attention to the tapes. Everybody knows what's on these tapes. I think 
everybody has seen all of the information they're going to see on 
this story. My guess is that most people around the country won't 
be paying much attention, but the people who are obsessed with this 
story, this will be a Day in heaven for them.
