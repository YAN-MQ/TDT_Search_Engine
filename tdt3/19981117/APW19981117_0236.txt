British inflation hit the government's 2.5 percent target in October, 
the third consecutive month. The underlying inflation rate has held 
steady since it dropped from July's rate of 2.6 percent, the government 
said. At the same time, headline inflation _ which includes mortgage 
interest repayments _ rose 0.1 percent for the month. The figures 
are likely to increase the clamor from manufacturers and unions for 
a further cut in interest rates to protect jobs from the continuing 
global financial turmoil. The main downward pressure on prices was 
a fall in motoring costs as a result of reduced insurance premiums 
and lower used car prices, the government said. The costs of clothing 
and furniture also fell because of heavy discounting by retailers 
in the autumn sales. However, the downward effect was partially offset 
by higher tuition fees for new university students. ``Today's figures 
show that the government is steering a course of stability with inflation 
at its target level for the third month in a row, and our public finances 
are on track to achieve a debt repayment for the year as a whole _ 
the first time this has happened for nearly a decade,'' said Stephen 
Byers, chief secretary of the treasury.
