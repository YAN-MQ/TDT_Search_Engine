The 13-year-old heiress to the Onassis fortune arrived on the family's 
private island Tuesday to attend a graveside memorial on the 10th 
anniversary of her mother's death. Athina Roussel, the granddaughter 
of the late shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, was accompanied by 
her father Thierry Roussel to the Ionian island of Skorpios, about 
260 kilometers (160 miles) northwest of Athens. The family holds a 
memorial for Christina Onassis each year in Switzerland, where Athina 
lives with Roussel, his Swedish wife and the couple's three children. 
Athina has visited her mother's grave, but this will be the first 
time she will attend a memorial ceremony there. Following the Wednesday 
ceremony, Athina will return to her school in Geneva, said Roussel's 
spokesman, Alexis Mantheakis. French-born Roussel is locked in a battle 
for management of the dlrs 600 million fortune that Athina stands 
to inherit on her 18th birthday. The Greek trustees administering 
the inheritance sued Roussel for slander, perjury and other charges 
after he lost a court case in which he accused them of fiscal mismanagement. 
The trial is being held in Athens.
