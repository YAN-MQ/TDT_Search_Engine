Well, it's time now for a sports update with VOA's Steve Shine. Thank 
you very much, Tony. Tom Glavin of Baseball's Atlanta Braves has won 
the Sy Young Award as the best pitcher in the National League, for 
the second time in his career. He also earned the honor in 199: Lavin 
edged San Diego relief pitcher Trevor Hoffman by 11 points, but Hoffman 
received the most first place votes. This is the first time in Sy 
Young Award history that a pitcher has won without getting the most 
first place votes by the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
The 32 year-old Glavin was the National League's only 20 game winner 
this season, with a record of 20 and 6: The left-hander had a 2.46 
earned run average, and struck out 157 batters in 229 innings. Hoffman 
had a major league-leading 53 saves and 54 chances along with 4 wins 
and 2 losses and an earned run average of 1.48. Hoffman's San Diego 
teammate Kevin Brown was third in the Sy Young balloting, while Atlanta 
teammates Greg Maddox and John Schmaltz tied for fourth. Roger Clemments 
of the Toronto Blue Jays won an unprecedented fifth, American League 
Sy Young Award, Monday in a unanimous vote.
