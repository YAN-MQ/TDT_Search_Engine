President Laurent Kabila's outspoken health minister has been effectively 
placed under house arrest following his dismissal in recent days, 
a member of his family said Tuesday. Jean Baptiste Sondji was sacked 
as health minister last week and has since been ordered to stay at 
home under the watchful eye of state security agents, the family member 
said on condition on anonymity. ``He can't receive any visitors and 
he is not allowed to leave his home,'' the relative said. Sondji, 
who for months urged the government to pay more attention to public 
health and education, expanded his criticism of Kabila's regime, saying 
the president had stifled debate on constitutional reform. ``This 
is not an issue for only a few individuals to discuss,'' Sondji said 
of constitutional reform, ``this is an issue for the entire country 
to debate.'' Sondji was quietly dismissed from his post on Friday, 
interrogated over the weekend and ordered to return to his home, the 
relative told The Associated Press. Earlier this year, Kabila had 
at least six cabinet ministers, including the finance minister and 
the director of state broadcasting, arrested on unspecified charges. 
Kabila, a former rebel leader, came to power in May 1997 after toppling 
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. The new president promised 
reform and democracy in his renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, 
but many critics say his regime's 18 months in power have seen repressive 
policies and a growing intolerance for criticism. Disaffected members 
of his armed forces banded together with ethnic Tutsi insurgents earlier 
this year and launched a rebellion against Kabila, accusing the president 
of corruption, nepotism and tribalism. The rebels marched to the capital's 
eastern outskirts in August, but were pushed back to the country's 
eastern region by Kabila's allies from Angola and Zimbabwe.
