Pacific Rim leaders have met in Kuala Lumpur for their annual economic 
summit, but the first day was clouded by a political dispute sparked 
by the United States. Malaysia lashed out at US Vice President Al 
Gore for his public expression of support for the host country's growing 
pro-democracy movement. Other countries said the focus needs to be 
on Asia's financial crisis, not politics. Mr. Gore was unapologetic 
Tuesday, saying his message at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
Summit is that democracy must go hand in hand with economic reform.
