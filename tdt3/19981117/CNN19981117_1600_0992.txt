Stocks swung wildly after the fed announcement. The Dow industrials 
had slipped 80 points before hearing from the fed, and surged after. 
They finished the day down, still, down 24 points, at 8986. The broader 
markets finished mostly higher. The NASDAQ composite gaining almost 
17 points. One bright spot, interest rates -- I think we're going 
to be stuck right now in a fairly narrow trading range. I wouldn't 
be surprised if we tacked on 100 points on this current rally here 
just on the enthusiasm, that, golly, the fed is on our side. However, 
I think analysts are going to be focusing in on earnings forecasts 
for next year. And those earnings forecasts have got to come down. 
One bright spot, interest rate-sensitive bank stocks are surging on 
the fed rate cut -- with BankAmerica adding 1 5/16, chase up 3 1/4, 
and city group up a dollar a share. The bond market is giving back 
some early gains.
