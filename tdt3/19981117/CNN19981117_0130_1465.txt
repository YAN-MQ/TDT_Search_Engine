Some of the movies featured at a New York film festival aren't much 
longer than most movie trailers. Jeanne Moos talked to the people 
who find depth in their shorts. At a party to celebrate shorts, you'd 
think someone would be wearing them. Oh yeah, I think people like 
shorts. Are you here looking for shorts? yes. Not that kind of shorts 
-- this kind. You don't have to be short to enter this festival, but 
your film does. Take "17 seconds to Sophie," the winner in the experimental 
film category. Bill Cote time-lapsed footage of his pregnant wife 
-- We took two frames every day for nine months. When the director 
finally yelled cut -- he probably meant the umbilical cord. The second 
annual shorts festival featured 62 shorts, ranging from the three-minute-long 
"I'm on fire" -- to the 6 1/2-minute "fetch" -- to the nine-minute 
"ratwomen" -- One of the advantages of rats tails is that they taste 
lovely. yum. Some shorts are mercifully short. Theaters used to play 
shorts before the main feature, but not anymore. And feature films 
keep getting longer and longer. Just the trailer for "Titanic" was 
longer than some short films. God almighty. How long was "Titanic"? 
That was like three hours long I think. Three hours. Like 40 shorts. 
Yeah. These three brothers, the fields brothers, created a short called 
"Script doctor." Okay, what do we got? Looks like "batman 5." Page 
count? Just under 150. Long, but not fatal. These guys could make 
a short out of anything. It's very cute. isn't it? It's very fuzzy. 
Put a couple of eyes on it, we've got a short right there. Organizers 
of the shorts festival say their art form is being shortchanged. I 
keep saying it's analogous to a short story. I mean, you read novels 
and you read short stories. Actresses Rosie Perez and Mia Farrow presented 
awards in such categories as best short animation. Pregnant pregnant 
You'd have to be short-sighted not to see the advantages of shorts. 
I do like short films, because then you can see five films in one 
night. Leaving him more time to paint his head. What do you call shorts 
that tend to be a little long? Well, bermuda shorts, definitely. My 
first short was "two bananas making love." How did that work? The 
first banana peeled down from the top, and his peels became arms, 
and then he slipped his arm under the other banana's peel, which became 
a Skirt. You figure out who's top banana in this bunch. Jeanne Moos, 
CNN, New York.
