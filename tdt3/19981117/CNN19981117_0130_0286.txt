Most Americans don't feel the United States has fared all that well 
in the recent conflicts with Iraq. A CNN/"USA today" Gallup poll shows 
53% of people believe that over the last year, Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein was the winner. 37% say President Clinton won. When asked 
if missile attacks on Iraq have achieved significant U.S. goals, only 
30% of those polled say "yes," 66% say "no."
