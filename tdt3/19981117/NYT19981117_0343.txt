It will come as no surprise to Nicole Kidman's screen admirers to 
learn that she also looks sexy and beautiful on stage, not least when 
scantily dressed. Yet this unremarkable discovery threw British newspapers 
into a veritable swoon this fall when she made her first stage appearance 
in 11 years. A few theater critics did actually notice her performance 
(``she (italics)can(end italics) act''). But far more space was dedicated 
to poetic, erotic and clinical (``no _ repeat, no _ cellulite'') ruminations 
about her body. The normally staid London Daily Telegraph was quite 
overwhelmed. ``Pure theatrical Viagra,'' it gasped. True, sex (italics)is(end 
italics) the theme of the play, ``The Blue Room,'' David Hare's loose 
adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's turn-of-the-century play ``Reigen,'' 
or round-dance, now better known as ``La Ronde.'' Ten characters (Ms. 
Kidman and the British actor Iain Glen each play five) engage in a 
daisy-chain of sexual encounters. Copulation is suggested every time 
the stage goes dark, with surtitles coyly offering how long each of 
the 10 couplings supposedly lasts. And yes, for the briefest of moments, 
the tall, lissome actress does stand naked, her back to the audience, 
as her partner dresses her. But what is it with the Brits? This was 
theater, not live sex. ``I think there's an element of the British 
that is kind of pathetically grateful for a glamorous star gracing 
our boards,'' said Sam Mendes, who directed the play at the 250-seat 
Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden. ``Even those who have seen the 
play have written about something that isn't really on stage. This 
is not the kind of violently erotic `Oh, Calcutta!'-style review that 
has been reported here. They wrote about the wrong things. They didn't 
write about the play.'' The playwright seems to have taken it all 
in stride. ``As far as the British press were concerned, the play 
was simply a chariot that was carrying Nicole Kidman into town,'' 
Hare said. ``I don't think they noticed there was a play. Plainly, 
there was something magnetic about Nicole's presence.'' Now, after 
eight weeks of sold-out performances in London, where the rich paid 
upward of $1,000 for a ticket and the poor waited 12 hours for returns, 
``The Blue Room'' moves to Broadway to test the response of a New 
York audience to the Kidman phenomenon. Will they, too, scramble to 
view the 31-year-old Australian aka Mrs. Tom Cruise in various states 
of undress? The New York producers evidently hope so, since they have 
scheduled a longer run in a larger theater than in London. With previews 
beginning on Friday at the 900-seat Cort Theater, and the opening 
scheduled for Dec. 13, the 100-minute play involving, as the advertisements 
say, ``10 intimate acts'' ... and no intermission is scheduled to 
run through March 7. For all the hype, though, Ms. Kidman's purpose 
was hardly to encourage voyeurism. Rather, having begun her acting 
career in the theater in Australia in the mid-1980s, she said she 
simply missed appearing on stage. After Ms. Kidman moved to the United 
States and married Cruise, she made her name in such movies as ``To 
Die For,'' ``Dead Calm'' and ``A Portrait of a Lady'' (her latest 
film, ``Practical Magic,'' opened last month). But, she said, she 
always preferred seeing plays to movies. And when she and Cruise half-settled 
in England while shooting Stanley Kubrick's still-to-be-released film, 
``Eyes Wide Shut'' (based, by coincidence, on another Schnitzler tale, 
``Traumnovelle,'' or ``Dream Story''), she jumped at the chance of 
working in an experimental theater where, she thought, she would attract 
little attention. ``Well, yes, I have been totally surprised by the 
reaction,'' she acknowledged in a recent interview, accompanied by 
Glen, in a dressing-room at the Donmar Warehouse. ``This is a small 
theater. I didn't want to start by doing something big on Broadway 
or on the West End. When you do theater, you want to explore yourself 
as an actor. And if there is a lot of pressure, it tends to stop you. 
I just wanted to work with Sam Mendes. I had seen his work at the 
Donmar. I had seen his `Cabaret' and `Othello.' We went to lunch one 
day and we just got on. He had a lot of ideas.'' But bringing a movie 
star to the London stage is not an original one: Juliette Binoche, 
Kevin Spacey and Liam Neeson have all drawn crowds here in recent 
months. But Mendes was clearly taken by Ms. Kidman's eagerness to 
appear at the nonprofit Donmar _ and willingness to do so for a weekly 
salary equivalent to $400. ``When you meet her, her spirit is surprising,'' 
the 33-year-old director said. ``She has a huge kind of childlike 
streak that is very engaging and very unexpected with someone whom 
you associate with film performances which are very severe. So I wanted 
to find something in which she could display that.'' The chosen vehicle 
was the contemporary version of ``La Ronde,'' which Mendes had asked 
Hare to write, using two actors to play all the roles. Schnitzler's 
original 1900 German-language version, which was closed down by police 
as obscene when it finally opened in 1921, was a satirical expose 
of Vienna's highly stratified society. Speaking of the original play, 
Hare said: ``I think, crudely, you could say that at the end of the 
19th century, Freud's contemporary Schnitzler produces this shocking 
revelation that sex and romance are used to manipulate, and that they 
are forms both of self-deception and deceit. His version is rather 
world-weary and cynical about La Ronde, or sexual roundelay: `Here 
is this place where we all deceive each other.' ``I have swung it 
round because I don't feel that at the end of the 20th century that's 
such a startling thing to say. If anything, I am saying, `La Ronde 
is where we live _ where else can we live? And hideous as the bruises 
are that we may take on on La Ronde, it's a lot better than being 
off La Ronde,' which is why I give the actress that climactic speech 
where she says, `What's the alternative? The story is going to end 
badly, so what do we do meanwhile? At least we're on La Ronde.' I 
feel La Ronde is where you learn, while Schnitzler feels that La Ronde 
is where you got your heart broken.'' Hare's version, which changes 
the identity, though not the social ranking, of several characters, 
also suggests that nihilism rather than hypocrisy is today's social 
blight. Of course, in both cases, it is sex that breaks down class 
barriers. So, Mendes was asked, did Ms. Kidman know what she getting 
into? ``I think if she had known what she was going to do, she might 
have blanched,'' the director said with a laugh. ``But once it became 
part of an organic process, after you have spent six weeks in rehearsals, 
it grew out of the natural chemistry between the two actors. If I 
had told Iain on the first day, `By the way, I want you to do a naked 
cartwheel in this scene,' he'd have looked at me and probably walked 
out. But it came naturally out of the situation.'' It obviously helped 
that the two actors got along well. Before Mendes cast them together, 
Ms. Kidman had never heard of Glen, who in recent years has won accolades 
here for his leading roles in ``Hamlet,'' ``Henry V'' and ``Martin 
Guerre.'' And, by the way, Glen had not seen any of Ms. Kidman's movies, 
either. Even now, with Glen in loose shirt, scruffy trousers and no 
shoes and Ms. Kidman in elegant gray sweater, gray slacks and black 
boots, they seemed to hail from different worlds of entertainment. 
Yet after four months of working together, they have clearly become 
good friends. And for that, they also pay tribute to Mendes. ``Sam 
was never pushy; he never insisted on anything,'' Ms. Kidman recalled, 
stealing a puff of Glen's cigarette. ``The actual scene in which Iain 
as the playwright is naked and he dresses me, the model, we didn't 
do it in rehearsals, only in the preview. But we felt that particular 
scene was needed because of who the playwright was and who she was.'' 
Glen, 37, whose strong physique serves as a perfect match to Ms. Kidman's 
fragile beauty, concurred. ``I thought that in an evening of sexual 
coupling, it might have seemed coy if at some point there wasn't full 
nudity,'' he said, ``because there's a coital moment in each scene. 
It was just getting that balance right.'' Well, since we are talking 
about sex ... ``We've spent the last three months talking about it,'' 
Ms. Kidman interrupted with an exuberant laugh. ``Why should we stop 
now?'' So, she was asked, what did Cruise think of the intimacy of 
the play? ``My husband has done many things in films,'' Ms. Kidman 
said. ``I have done many things in films. That's part of being an 
actor. And, I'm sorry to say, it doesn't provoke any fights in our 
household any more.'' And the audience reaction? ``You hear them gasp,'' 
she said with an embarrassed giggle. ``In the scene between the politician 
and the model, when he _ I don't know what word you can use in print. 
Well, you sense the tension because people feel relieved to laugh. 
When he asks, `Is that good?' and I say, `I don't even know what you're 
doing,' it always gets a very big laugh.'' As it happens, it was not 
the play's sexiness that worried Ms. Kidman. Not having appeared on 
stage for so long, she was nervous before rehearsals even began. And 
before opening night, she said, she was terrified. For her, the real 
challenge was playing five different characters in quick succession, 
each with a different accent: cockney, French, Australian, upper-class 
British and breathy actress. ``I thought, `Oh, my God, I have bitten 
off more than I can chew,'' she recalled. ``Why didn't I just choose 
one character?'' Hare said he was struck by how dramatically Ms. Kidman's 
performance improved once the previews began. ``It was almost like 
those two weeks were her university of theater acting,'' he said. 
``My only sadness is that in all this hysteria it gets overlooked 
how damned good she is in it.'' The actors' fresh challenge in New 
York will be to perform in a proscenium theater after working with 
an audience on three sides of the stage at the Donmar. But, for Ms. 
Kidman, the perils of returning to the theater after a long break 
are over. Indeed, she is now looking forward to more frequent stage 
appearances, with the leading role in Strindberg's ``Miss Julie'' 
now provisionally scheduled for Sydney late next year. She has also 
told Mendes that she is ready to return to the Donmar. ``As an actress, 
there are so few good roles in film,'' she said. ``But there are great 
roles in theater for women of all ages. In theater, you grow, vocally, 
in discipline, it's the best thing you can do.'' She paused as if 
ready for a confession. ``If you work just on films, you get lazy,'' 
she said. ``You really do.''
