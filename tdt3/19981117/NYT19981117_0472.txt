Calvin Klein is going online. Klein is making his first foray into 
cyberspace with an interactive campaign for CK One, the unisex fragrance 
from the Calvin Klein Cosmetics Co. unit of Unilever. The scent has 
become a worldwide best seller since its introduction in 1994, though 
sales in the United States have flagged recently. The campaign replaces 
a previous one that featured corps of edgy androgynes dishing out 
hip, flippant chatter. Now, a smaller cast of slicker, sleeker characters 
use electronic mail in recounting their fictitious, interconnected 
relationships. The campaign for CK One, estimated at $10 million, 
is indicative of marketers' efforts to capitalize on the increasing 
consumer use of personal computers. That is particularly true for 
brands seeking to create personas that appeal to trend-setting shoppers. 
For instance, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is entering the electronic-commerce 
realm by selling Levi's and Dockers apparel at two World Wide Web 
sites, www.levi.com and www.dockers.com. ``I want to be of the moment,'' 
Klein, president and chief executive at Calvin Klein Inc., said in 
an interview Monday at his office in midtown Manhattan. ``To watch 
people who stand for what the fragrance is all about communicate in 
the most modern way speaks to the consumer we're trying to reach.'' 
What makes e-mail appropriate, he added, is that it echoes how ``very 
personal'' the choice of a fragrance can be. The concept for the CK 
One campaign came from the New York office of Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, 
the Portland, Ore., agency that handles brands like Coca-Cola, Microsoft 
and Nike. The campaign was developed in collaboration with CRK Advertising, 
the in-house agency at Klein. By presenting cyberspace as the answer 
to the question ``Where does Calvin Klein want to go today?'' the 
ads offer a contemporary twist on a traditional ploy _ the serialized 
or continuing campaign. Examples include the flirtatious couple hawking 
Taster's Choice coffee for Nestle SA and the unconventional couples 
peddling Klein's Obsession fragrance in surrealistic spots. ``Many 
people will say `Who wants to talk to any of these characters?' and 
you don't have to,'' Klein said, smiling. ``But over the years we've 
found that people are interested in the models, the characters, in 
our commercials, and want to find out more about them.'' The e-mail 
addresses of the CK One characters are featured prominently in the 
campaign, which begins this week with television commercials in Asia, 
Europe, Latin America and North America. The initial three characters 
are Anna, a schoolgirl who is ``13 going on 30,'' Klein said; Tia, 
a 20-something woman embarking on a career, and Robert, a 40-ish urbanite. 
Missives to the three addresses _ anna(AT)cKone.com, tia(AT)cKone.com 
and robert(AT)cKone.com _ are answered with prepared responses meant 
to be in the characters' voices, in which they ruminate on their complicated 
lives in and out of love. The replies expand on remarks they make 
in the commercials. Models portray the characters in the TV spots, 
as well as in radio commercials, print ads and posters; the e-mails 
are actually produced by Brant Mau, a copywriter at the Wieden &AMP; 
Kennedy office in Portland, who works with the co-creative directors 
of the agency's New York office, Stacy Wall and Michael Prieve. ``Technology 
is about now,'' said Prieve, who had been co-creative director on 
the agency's Microsoft account, ``and fashion is supposed to be. The 
question was how could we combine the two.'' ``Even if people write 
back and say `This is a joke; I can't believe you're doing this,''' 
he added, ``they're responding to the campaign, and that's great, 
instead of just sitting around watching TV.'' The campaign _ titillating 
in a voyeuristic, ``Rear Window''-meets-Windows way _ marks the first 
CK One work from Wieden &AMP; Kennedy since its New York office was 
selected in September to share brand duties with CRK Advertising. 
When an e-mail was sent to Anna's address, the reply resembled the 
hasty, chatty online argot of teen-agers. It was centered on a crush 
Anna has on a boy at school, who is ``smart and gorgeous and totally 
perfect and really really sweet,'' and included emoticons like : ) 
for a smile and : ( for a frown. The e-mail reply from Tia, far more 
polished than Anna's, described her new job at a ``superhot TV production 
house'' called Manic _ an in joke? _ and her problematic love life 
involving Jason, a boyfriend left behind in Seattle, and Ian, an ``annoying 
guy'' she met during the shooting of a dog-food commercial in London. 
The reply from Tia states, in a style evocative of the novel ``Bridget 
Jones's Diary,'' ``Note to myself: Men equal Confusion. Avoid at all 
costs.'' And Robert's reply, in world-weary tones, revealed him to 
be a ``happily married'' man on a business trip to London, who feels 
``some unspoken connection'' to a woman he just met while shooting 
a ``bloody dog-food commercial.'' Of course, it's Tia. (Later, it 
turns out that Anna is his daughter.) There will be no fixed schedule 
by which computer users will receive subsequent e-mail from the characters, 
said Robert Triefus, senior vice president for worldwide communications 
at Klein, ``to make it as realistic as possible.'' ``They'll be surprising 
in the way e-mail can be,'' he added, ``with the next one coming immediately 
or a couple days later or a couple weeks later.'' And if consumers 
tire of the cybersoap opera, they can send e-mail asking for the correspondence 
to end. The story is intended as ``an unfolding drama,'' Prieve said, 
and is not completely plotted out, so ``if everyone falls in love 
with one character,'' his or her role can be expanded. Plans call 
for as many as seven additional characters to be introduced. Whatever 
happens with the characters, Prieve said, they will ``stay away from 
the piercings and the tattoos'' that were hallmarks of the first batch 
of models promoting CK One. That shift comes after a refocusing of 
Klein's apparel advertising this year to emphasize a clean-cut look. 
And consumers will be spared static shots of the characters at keyboards, 
Klein said, because ``it isn't really necessary to get the idea what 
this is about.'' Dawn Jacobs, vice president at CRK Advertising, said 
that the campaign would begin in this country with television ads 
in 30 markets, radio spots in more than 20 markets and national commercials 
on cable networks like MTV. The print ads and posters will appear 
regionally and nationally. The commercials were directed by Mark Romanek 
and the print ads and posters were photographed by Richard Burbridge; 
Steven Meisel produced the original CK One campaign. As plugged in 
as the new campaign is supposed to be, the Klein foray into cyberspace 
is only partial. ``People have always said to us we should have a 
Web site for image,'' Klein said. ``We'll get there because I'm convinced 
it will mean enormous business one day, but it's not the main priority 
right now.'' And though his company is moving online, Klein is remaining 
most resolutely off line. ``I don't have time to sit in a room and 
e-mail,'' Klein said. ``My life just doesn't work that way.'' Besides, 
he added, ``I can't type'' _ though he is ``debating whether I should 
take lessons.''
