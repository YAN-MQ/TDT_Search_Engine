Another bit of miss hi surrounding Monica Lewinsky is gone. Today 
the house Judiciary committee released 22 hours of audio tapes made 
by Linda Tripp of taped conversations with the former White House 
intern. For most Americans, it's the first time they have heard Lewinsky's 
voice. Transcripts of the tapes previously were released by the committee. 
In one recording, Lewinsky advises Tripp about testifying in the Paula 
jones case, the creep she refers to in it is the president of the 
United States. On another recording, Tripp insists her political feelings 
have nothing to do with her desire to testify truthfully in the Paula 
Jones case. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart says reaction there 
is somewhere between none and indifference. And says he thinks most 
of America will be equally disinterested, considering transcripts 
of the tapes were released previously. You can stay tuned to "Headline 
News" for excerpts from the Tripp/Lewinsky tapes.
