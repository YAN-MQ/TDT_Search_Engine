The outgoing president of the Inter American Press Association on 
Tuesday lamented the number of journalists killed this year and called 
for a fight against obstacles of press freedom. A grouping of newspaper 
publishers from across the Americas, IAPA also elected 20 new members 
of its board of directors and heard praise from Uruguay's president 
for the media's role in democratic society. ``Twenty six journalist 
have been killed in the past year and that's been a horrifying statistic,'' 
said departing IAPA president Oliver F. Clarke, chairman of The Gleaner 
Company Limited, Jamaica. He said IAPA sent 66 protests to governments 
in the past year over attacks on journalists or infringement on press 
liberties. IAPA also sent nine missions to investigate the most serious 
cases during the year. ``We continue to investigate the murders of 
journalists and to urge governments'' to prosecute those responsible 
for the deaths, Clarke said. He has called for non-stop IAPA pressure 
on judicial systems in many countries that have failed to prosecute 
those who assault or kill journalists. Uruguayan President Julio M. 
Sanguinetti later told the publishers that the press serves as a beacon 
for democracy, but warned against the excesses of ``yellow journalism.'' 
He also warned the press to be wary of those who try to use the media 
for their own benefits, they political powers or others. As part of 
the penultimate day of meetings, Clark informed IAPA that 18 heads 
of states _ and the Organization of American States _ had endorsed 
IAPA's document on press freedom called the Chapultepec project. But 
while the Chapultepec endorsements were a highlight, Clarke has acknowledged 
that the operation of a free press in Latin America faces some major 
obstacles. Separately, he announced elections of 20 new members of 
the 60-member IAPA Board of Directors, who will fill terms from 1998 
until 2001. Elected to the board of directors from U.S. publications 
were Robert J. Cox of The News and Courier, Charleston, South Carolina; 
Diana Daniels of The Washington Post; Gregory Favre of The Sacramento 
Bee, Sacramento, California; Jack Fuller of the Chicago Tribune; Earl 
Maucker of the Sun-Sentinel, Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Sergio Munoz 
of the Los Angeles Times; Laurence G. O'Donnell of The Wall Street 
Journal; Robert Rivard of the San Antonio Express-News, San Antonio, 
Texas; Scott C. Schurz of the Herald-Times, Bloomington, Indiana; 
Paul C. Tash of the St. Petersburg Times, Florida. Elected to the 
board from outside the United States were Washington Beltran of El 
Pais, Montevideo, Uruguay; Felipe Edwards of El Mercurio, Santiago, 
Chile; Jose Santiago Healy of El Imparcial, Hermosillo, Mexico; Saturnino 
Herrero Mitjans of Clarin, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Roberto Eduardo
