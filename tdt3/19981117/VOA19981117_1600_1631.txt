And tomorrow, Adam Phillips will take a look at the new Butte, Montana 
with a report on the lingering environmental effects of the local 
copper industry, as well as efforts to detoxify the town without sanitizing 
its colorful past. Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates 
are about to take a two minute break. This is VOA, News Now. Today 
is Tuesday, November 17th, 1998: On this date in 1881, US labor leader 
Samuel Gomphers completed the organization of an alliance of American 
and Canadian labor unions. The purpose of the new American Federation 
of Labor, known as the AFL was in Mr. Gomphers words, pure and simple 
unionism. That is higher wages, shorter hours, and better working 
conditions. For several decades, Samuel Gomphers and his organization 
were able to monopolize the labor of skilled workers. In 1955 they 
merged the AFL with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, known 
as the CIO, which was generally for less skilled workers. As the Af 
of L, CIO, the combined group is still a dominant force in the US 
labor movement. And on November 17th, 1800 the United States Congress 
met for the first time in the partially completed Capitol Building 
here in Washington. Congress had begun planning for a permanent meeting 
place in 1790: The legislative body was unhappy that it had been forced 
to convene in eight different cities since the Declaration of Independence 
was signed in 1776. Congress appointed George Washington to choose 
a sight for a permanent capitol district. He selected a 256 square 
kilometer location along the east bank of the Potomac River between 
the states of Maryland and Virginia. Thomas Jefferson selected the 
site for the capitol building on a hill overlooking the river. And 
the structure has been under almost constant construction or renovation 
since work on it was begun in 1793. Stay tuned now for World News 
as VOA News Now continues. It's Universal time and this is VOA News 
Now United Nations weapons inspectors are back in Iraq, three days 
after Baghdad's last minute promise of unconditional cooperation narrowly 
averted US air strikes. Italy says it will not extradite Kurdish rebel 
leader Abdullah Odjullon to Turkey. And on our Dateline segment, a 
look at Muslims in the west. It's all coming up in this half hour 
of VOA News Now. First a summary of World News.
