The British government agreed Tuesday to join the nation's museums 
in a comprehensive search of their art collections for works that 
may have been looted by the Nazis during World War II. At the urging 
of The Holocaust Educational Trust, the government and museums have 
agreed to audit their collections as part of an international campaign 
to identify art stolen by the Nazis and return it to the rightful 
owners or heirs. Britain is a focal point because many works plundered 
from conquered countries are believed to have made their way to London 
after the war, sold by dealers unconcerned or less than truthful about 
their origins, according to a new report by the Holocaust group. ``The 
hunt for Nazi loot has already turned into the greatest treasure hunt 
in history,'' Lord Janner, the group's chairman, said Tuesday. The 
art restitution issue will be the focus of a 42-nation conference 
starting Nov. 30 at the U.S. State Department in Washington. The Holocaust 
group's report cites inconsistencies in the handling of art and other 
holdings seized by the Allies for restitution after the Nazi defeat. 
Efforts to return the property to its rightful owners were ended in 
1949, with most works still unaccounted for. ``The restitution was 
partial and perfunctory, and missed a great deal of paintings,'' said 
Stephen Ward, co-author of the report. If art in Britain is identified 
as Nazi loot and traced to an owner, ``we hope then an amicable settlement 
can be reached,'' said Toby Sargent, a spokesman for the Department 
for Culture, Media and Sport, which oversees galleries and the government's 
own collection of 11,500 works. Last week, the World Jewish Congress 
challenged the French government to step up efforts to track the ownership 
of 678 artworks in the Louvre believed to have been looted by Hitler's 
friends and agents. The French government has acknowledged that 2,058 
looted paintings, sculptures and drawings _ valued at hundreds of 
millions of dollars _ are in French museums and collections, including 
the Louvre. ``We've been in touch with the French government, but 
so far nothing has happened,'' Elan Steinberg, the World Jewish Congress' 
executive director, said last week. ``We're challenging France and 
other European countries holding art plundered by the Nazis to get 
the works to their original owners.''
