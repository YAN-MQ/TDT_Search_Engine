Two teams heading in opposite directions couldn't be more cliched, 
couldn't be more accurate, either. Behind quarterback bubby brister 
and Terrell Davis' 111 yards rushing, the denver Broncos ran their 
record to 10-0, beating up on Kansas city, 30-7, at Arrowhead. With 
the game out of reach, frustration set in big time. The chiefs were 
called for five personal fouls during Denver's final td drive. I'm 
embarrassed and I'm humiliated. The way we permitted the fourth quarter 
to go is as great a disappointment as I've ever had in my coaching 
experience. wow.
