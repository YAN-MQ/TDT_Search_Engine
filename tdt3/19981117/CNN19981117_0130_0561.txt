Some illegal immigrants from central America will stay in custody 
in the United States a little longer. The immigration and naturalization 
service says it won't deport them until at least January 7th. INS 
says it wants to give the region a chance to recover from hurricane 
mitch without the Burden that repatriated nationals might cause. The 
agency says it will re-evaluate the issue in January.
