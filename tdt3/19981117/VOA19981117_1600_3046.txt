Meanwhile, the European Union's chief auditor has criticized the EU 
Budget controls saying about 5 percent of the EU's total yearly spending 
of $94 billion appears to have been lost. But VOA's Ron Pimstein in 
Brussels reports that EU officials insist that the problems are mismanagement, 
not fraud. Even the President of the European Union's Court of Auditors 
does not say criminal fraud is responsible for the loss of billions 
of dollars from the union's accounts. Instead the report speaks of 
irregularities, and shortcomings in financial management. The Chief 
auditor, Bernard Friedman recommends that the European Union sharply 
reduce its guaranteed farm prices, better monitor lost customs fees 
and value added taxes. And use more efficient management of programs 
in Eastern Europe. Speaking through an interpreter in Strasbourg, 
France. Mr. Friedman says the auditors can only make recommendations 
to the European Commission for improvements in accounting practices. 
Commission and Parliament and Council do listen to the auditor's comments, 
do assess them and do take steps as a result. The European Court of 
Auditors has no power as to impose sanctions. Our weapon is the quality 
of our own arguments and the power of persuasion. The Commission's 
budget chairman, Erkei Lekenon responds by saying, many of the auditors 
complaints have to do with management of the European Union's foreign 
aid programs. Mr. Lekenon tells reporters, a complicated system is 
to blame. Our aid programs are the level of seven or eight billion 
Ecus a year. They are based on 75 budgetary lines, 87 legal basis, 
nine different committees are understudying them. There are about 
10,000 contracts per year, 3000 47 different procedures. Mr. Lekenon 
says the auditors' reports are not pleasant reading for the commission. 
But, budget reforms should be completed by next year to eliminate 
some of the complaints about external aid programs. According to the 
auditors, the European Union's aid programs do not have sufficient 
staff to manage them. And errors are made in payments. Mismanagement 
yes, the auditors say, but not fraud. Ron Pimstein, VOA News, Brussels.
