One hundred years ago Sunday, Pietro Mascagni's opera ``Iris'' had 
its premiere at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome, the same theater in which, 
eight years before, his first and most famous opera, ``Cavalleria 
Rusticana,'' received 60 curtain calls at its premiere. But whereas 
``Cavalleria'' ushered in the era of verismo, which sought to dramatize 
the lives of ordinary people, ``Iris'' came at the height of the ``japonisme'' 
that swept the arts in Europe in the second half of the 19th century. 
The centennial of the work, which was last heard at the Metropolitan 
Opera in 1931, will be celebrated on Monday evening with a concert 
performance by Teatro Grattacielo at Alice Tully Hall in New York 
City. While preparations have been under way, associations and connections 
have evolved on many levels, including a conductor, Fiora Contino, 
whose father sang in Mascagni's operas and some elaborate Whistlerian 
costumes that connote the Esthetic Movement's interpretation of the 
Japanesque. This is only the second opera presented by Teatro Grattacielo, 
which was founded in 1994 and is named for a movie house in postwar 
Genoa, where Maria Callas and others performed while the city's bombed-out 
opera house was rebuilt. The name, Skyscraper Theater, is especially 
appropriate to a New York setting. ``We see our mission as a kind 
of historic preservation of operas, specifically in the verismo style, 
that the larger opera houses can no longer afford to stage,'' said 
Thurmond Smithgall, who directs the company along with Duane D. Printz, 
one of its founders. As former opera singers themselves, Smithgall 
and Ms. Printz are also devoted to giving young singers opportunities 
to perform in New York. Three of the lead singers in ``Iris,'' including 
Karen Notare in the title role, will be making New York debuts. In 
addition, Ms. Contino, the general director of Opera Illinois, will 
make her New York conducting debut. As the youngest daughter of Ferruccio 
Corradetti, an Italian baritone, Ms. Contino was born into the verismo 
tradition. Corradetti, before moving to New York and establishing 
a prolific recording career, sang under Mascagni's direction in Rome 
in 1901, when his ``Maschere'' was given its premiere in six Italian 
opera houses on the same night. One of Ms. Contino's half-sisters, 
Iris Adami Corradetti, a soprano and voice teacher, was named for 
Mascagni's Japanese heroine. Mascagni was the second composer (after 
Alberto Franchetti) to whom the librettist, Luigi Illica, had shown 
his work for ``Iris,'' inspired by the Japanese legend ``The Maid 
Who Loved Flowers.'' Illica had discovered the tale in an anthology 
of Japanese and Chinese poetry, ``Le Livre de Jade,'' compiled in 
France and translated into Italian. He included long descriptive passages, 
which were not meant to be set to music but which establish the mood 
and setting for each of the three acts. The libretto, including those 
passages, has been newly translated for the printed program by Ms. 
Printz. In the opera, Iris, a village maiden, is coveted by Osaka, 
a nobleman, for her beauty. A procurer, Kyoto, plots her abduction 
by means of a puppet show. Iris is distracted by Osaka's seductive 
voice as one of the puppets and carried off to the geisha district 
of a nearby town. Osaka, bored by her innocence and protestations, 
leaves her to Kyoto, who displays her to the town. Among the bystanders 
is her blind, saintly father, who reviles her in a mistaken belief 
that she left him purposely. In her shame, she jumps into a sewer 
and dies. ``As an impressionistic opera, it echoes Debussy's `Pelleas 
et Melisande,' Ms. Contino said recently in her New York studio. ``And 
in breaking harmonic rules, it resembles works by Mussorgsky.'' Listening 
to recordings of the opera, Ms. Contino became aware that they did 
not represent the music as she heard it. ``Bar lines should fall away 
to reveal supple blending of words and music,'' she said. She sang 
a few lines, following the score with her finger, to show how to achieve 
a more natural sound. Although Mascagni did not include Japanese instruments 
in the orchestration, he suggested their dissonance and timbre with 
an assortment of strings and gongs surrounding melodic lines reminiscent 
of Wagner. Giacomo Puccini, who attended opening night and called 
the instrumentation ``dazzling and colorful,'' profited from Mascagni's 
experiment and sought greater authenticity when he came to compose 
``Madama Butterfly,'' which appeared in 1904. Illica also had a hand 
in the ``Butterfly'' libretto, working with Giuseppe Giacosa. ``Iris'' 
has been receiving attention in recent years, specifically in London; 
Opera Holland Park performed it in a full outdoor production during 
the last two summers, with costumes by the Welsh designers Charles 
and Patricia Lester, whose costumes for the film ``Wings of the Dove'' 
were last year nominated for an Academy Award. Their costumes for 
``Iris,'' a cross between Whistler's ``Princesse du Pays de la Porcelaine'' 
and portraits by Klimt, so successfully paralleled the music in a 
timeless fantasy version of Japanese dress that Teatro Grattacielo 
has borrowed them for the New York performance. Perhaps nothing captures 
the spirit of the opera so well as the field of purple irises that 
adorns the heroine's kimono as she sings her opening aria. Beautiful 
on its own terms, it also presages the vision of immortality that 
concludes the work, as the sun rises on a sea of irises.
