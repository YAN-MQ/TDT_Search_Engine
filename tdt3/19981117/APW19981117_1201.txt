The sixteen-member IOC evaluation commission Tuesday finished a three-day 
stay in Finland after taking a close look on Helsinki's infrastructure 
and plans for the Olympic winter games 2006. Helsinki -- and its co-organizer 
Lillehammer in Norway -- were the commission*s last stop. They have 
earlier visited the five other candidates;Sion (Switzerland), Turin 
(Italy), Zakopane (Poland), Poprad Tatry (Slovakia), and, in a joint 
bid Klagenfurt in Austria, Planica in Slovakia and Tarvisio in Italy. 
``We are here not to compare Helsinki's bid to other cities' bids. 
We are here to evaluate your bid only,'' said delegation leader, IOC 
member Chiharu Igaya. He indicated however that Finland's tradition 
for winter sports was a positive factor in the bid. ``You have a wonderful 
sport tradition in this country and you have produced so many great 
winter sportsmen. The jumping venue in Lahti was really something'', 
Igaya told a news conference. Lahti, host of successful World Championhips 
and several World Cup skiing events, will handle the crosscountry 
skiing, ski jumping, biathlon and the freestyle skiing. Lillehammer, 
the Olympic host in 1994, is slated to arrange the alpine skiing, 
the sledding and luge events. ``The challenge for the Helsinki bid 
will be the distance between Lillehammer and Helsinki.'', Igaya said. 
``The distance between the Oslo airport and Lillehammer is only 110 
kilometers, on a fairly good road. We have to convince the doubtful 
that is no longer than it was in Albertville and Nagano,'' said Arne 
Myrvold, the Lillehammer representative in the Helsinki 2006 organizing 
committee. The evaluation commission will meet at the IOC headquarters 
in Lausanne December 8-9 to finish its report on the bids. It will 
be made public in the end of January. The voting for the host of the 
winter Olympics 2006 will be made June 19 next year, during IOC:s 
session in South Korea.
