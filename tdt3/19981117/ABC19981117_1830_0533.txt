Iraq will do its best to cooperate with them, but he also said naturally 
there are limits. the subject of what to do about Saddam Hussein is 
still very much front and center. What to do or what to try now that 
President Clinton said pretty clearly the U.S. will work to bring 
about a leadership change in Iraq. The Congress has made it clear 
that there is at least $100 million there to be spent. But who knows 
enough about what might work? From the Pentagon, ABC's John McWethy. 
All the high-level talk of overthrowing Saddam Hussein is music to 
the ears of the Iraqi opposition, especially Ahmad Chalabi, who has 
been pleading for U.S. support for years. This response is more effective 
than the bombing campaign, and it gets right to the heart of the problem. 
Saddam Hussein is the problem. He cannot be part of the solution. 
Chalabi's proposal, which he has presented to Congress, is for the 
U.S. to declare the western, southern and northern parts of Iraq no-fly 
and no-drive zones for Iraq's military. This would, in theory, create 
safe havens for those wanting to join an opposition army. It would 
be enforced, Chalabi says, with U.S. bombers, not ground troops. The 
problem with all such plans is the ruthless way Saddam Hussein has 
dealt with deserters and dissidents in the past. Even those who support 
his overthrow admit airpower alone could not adequately protect those 
people. Clearly, if you were to have a credible program for removal 
of Saddam hussein, it's going to involve U.S. ground troops, in due 
course. U.S. military officials are vehemently opposed to any plan 
that might draw American troops or planes into a civil war. The U.S. 
also faces the problem of exactly who to support. The opposition abroad 
is split into numerous factions warring against each other. The two 
major elements are not credible, and they have no support whatever 
inside the country. Despite these concerns, the Clinton administration 
is exploring ideas for how to strengthen the Iraqi opposition to see 
if it can do, with a little help, what American bombs never could.
