A Portuguese diplomat and a Bulgarian politician who defied their 
governments to save thousands of Jews from the Nazis during World 
War II received a posthumous tribute Tuesday from the European Parliament. 
``There were some brave men and women, the just, who risked their 
lives, their careers and confronted barbarism any way they could ... 
Today we pay homage to two of these heroes,'' said European Parliament 
President Jose-Maria Gil-Robles, opening the ceremony in Strasbourg, 
France. Aristides de Sousa Mendes was Portuguese consul general in 
Bordeaux, France, when the Germans invaded in 1940. He ignored government 
orders and issued visas to an estimated 10,000 Jews and 20,000 other 
refugees fleeing the Nazi advance. As a result, he was called back 
to Lisbon, where he was vilified by dictator Antonio Salazar. Dismissed 
from the diplomatic service, denied a pension and barred from practicing 
law, Sousa Mendes died in poverty in 1954. Dimitar Peshev played a 
key role in saving the 48,000 Jews living in Bulgaria in 1943. As 
deputy chairman of Bulgarian parliament, he vehemently opposed plans 
of the pro-fascist government to deport the entire Jewish community 
to the Auschwitz death camp. After the communists took over in 1944, 
Peshev was sentenced to 15 years in prison for collaborating with 
the Nazis. He was released after one year and died in 1973. The tribute 
to Sousa Mendes and Peshev was attended by Portugal's foreign minister 
Jaime Gama, speaker of the Bulgarian parliament Yordan Sokolov, and 
Israel's ambassador to the European Union, Harry Kney-Tal.
