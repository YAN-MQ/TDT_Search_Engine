US Central Bank policy makers have decided to lower interest rates 
for the third time this year, to keep the US economy growing amid 
the global slowdown. The Central Bank reduced the federal funds rate 
by one quarter of one percent to percent, its lowest rate since August 
of 1994. This rate is what banks charge each other for short term 
loans.
