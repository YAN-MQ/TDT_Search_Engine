Italy says it will not extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Urjalon 
to Turkey. At the same time the Italian Prime Minister says Rome will 
not grant political asylum to Mr. Urjalon unless it is convinced he 
has renounced terrorism. Turkey wants Mr. Urjalon extradited to face 
charges of terrorism and treason.
