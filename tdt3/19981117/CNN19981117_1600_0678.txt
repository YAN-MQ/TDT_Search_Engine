In Argentina, scientists have discovered a huge dinosaur nesting site. 
Their findings, outlined in the journal "nature," describe thousands 
of six-inch fossil eggs along with embryo remains. Scientists say 
the eggs were laid 70 million to 90 million years ago. They believe 
the large number of eggs suggests dinosaurs converged at the site 
to lay them. Researchers believe a catastrophe, perhaps a flood, kept 
the eggs from hatching.
