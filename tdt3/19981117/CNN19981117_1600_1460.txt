He once dressed up as a bride, but now basketball star Dennis Rodman 
apparently is a groom. The Chicago Bulls forward has confirmed reports 
he married "baywatch" actress Carmen Electra over the weekend in Las 
Vegas. His agent had questioned whether the nuptials were legal, saying 
Rodman was drunk during the ceremony. Rodman apologized for what he 
called "false statements" given on his behalf. He says he loves Electra 
and is proud to be married to her.
