Last year, drought from the El Nino weather phenomenon crippled Guyana's 
economy. Now scientists warn El Nino's cooler counterpart, La Nina, 
may bring further damage in the form of flooding. The weather service 
in this impoverished English-speaking northern South American nation 
is warning residents to expect heavy rains and flooding through May. 
Near-daily rain storms have begun in Georgetown, the flood-prone capital 
that sits below sea level behind a system of dikes. ``I hope people 
pay attention to our forecast and take the necessary precautions,'' 
said Chief Meteorologist Dilip Jaigopaul. Meteorologists predict a 
60 percent to 70 percent increase in rainfall during the winter rainy 
season. In normal years, Guyana gets about 185 millimeters (7.5 inches) 
of rain in November and January, and about 262 millimeters (10.5 inches) 
in December. Last year, scientists blamed a months-long drought on 
El Nino, a warming of the Pacific Ocean off the South American coast. 
La Nina, a cooling phenomenon, could have the opposite effect, Jaigopaul 
said. The drought cost farmers millions of dollars and forced the 
government to truck rice, canned food and other supplies to communities 
deep in the tropical forest. The drought also dried up rivers used 
to transport equipment to far-flung gold mines, which produce the 
biggest share of the country's export earnings. On Tuesday, the government 
said it would collect food donations to prepare for possible flooding 
in coastal areas, where about 635,000 of Guyana's 706,000 people live. 
Most of Guyana's cities lie at least 2 meters (6 feet) below the Atlantic 
Ocean behind dikes, sluices and a reinforced concrete seawall.
