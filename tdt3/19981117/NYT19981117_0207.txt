At least as intriguing as the songs the English folk-rocker Robyn 
Hitchcock performs in Jonathan Demme's intimate concert film ``Storefront 
Hitchcock'' are the surreal vignettes the singer spins out between 
numbers. A typical flight of fancy is his meditation on the gradual 
disappearance of the Isle of Wight as its shoreline is steadily eroded. 
Its science-fiction fantasy is peopled with ghosts of the dead dating 
back to Cro-Magnon times who hover over water covering what used to 
be land. The darkly futuristic dream ends in a vision of a world ruled 
by computers in which human life as we know it is extinct. Hitchcock's 
twisted commentaries have corollaries in his extensive catalog of 
seriously whimsical songs, which have made him a popular cult figuresince 
the late 1970s when he recorded with his first group, the Soft Boys. 
In the '80s, Hitchcock formed another band, the Egyptians. In 1996 
he released an acclaimed solo album, ``Moss Elixir.'' If those songs 
are lyrically too esoteric to have broad mass appeal, most of Hitchcock's 
albums have sold at least 100,000 copies. Think of the Beatles' playful 
surrealism fused with the spaced-out fantasies of Hitchcock's idol, 
Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd, spruced up with the historical imagination 
of Al Stewart at his most fanciful, and you have some idea of the 
flavor of Hitchcock's arty folk-rock ruminations. Accompanying himself 
on guitar and joined in the film for several numbers by two frequent 
collaborators, Deni Bonet (on violin) and Tim Keegan (on guitar and 
backup vocals), Hitchcock sings in a sour British twang that suggests 
a cross between John Lennon and David Bowie at their most sardonic. 
``Storefront Hitchcock,'' which opens today at the Film Forum, was 
filmed in a 14th Street storefront in Manhattan over two days before 
an unseen live audience. For much of the film, Hitchcock performs 
standing with his back to a window, through which a steady stream 
of traffic can be glimpsed. Occasionally pedestrians stop in front 
of the window and gawk. The film plays subtle tricks with time that 
reflect the playfulness of Hitchcock's lyrics. At one point, the clear 
glass of the window is replaced with colored panes. From song to song, 
the props surrounding the singer keep changing. There are candles 
in one number, a mirror ball in another and an odd sculpture of a 
tomato in another. ``Storefront Hitchcock'' is unlikely to spur a 
commercial resurgence for the 45-year-old singer, whom Demme obviously 
appreciates with the same enthusiasm he brought to the Talking Heads 
in his other rock-concert film, ``Stop Making Sense.'' But it still 
captures the sensibility of this smart, quirky folk-rocker in the 
most appealing possible light. PRODUCTION NOTES: ``STOREFRONT HITCHCOCK''
