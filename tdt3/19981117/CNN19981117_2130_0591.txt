Sun Microsystems is celebrating a legal victory over rival Microsoft. 
Today, a federal judge granted an injunction to force Microsoft to 
change its popular Windows 98 operating system. Sun alleges Microsoft 
polluted the windows version of sun's Java programming language, making 
it incompatible with operating systems other than Windows 98. The 
judge gave Microsoft 90 days to modify Windows 98 and its Internet 
explorer 4.O or pull them off the market.
