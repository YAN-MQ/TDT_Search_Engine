listeners into soy yurs. Some are fascinated, others horrified. The 
former intern talking about her love for the president. Heads are 
rolling in the G.O.P. as the cameraings prepare to roll on the impeachment 
hearings. Is the house about to be shaken up? And you are looking

show of its kind in three decades. It gets five stars from astronomers 
as meteors, thousands of them, make a Dramatic and so far harmless 
and safe entry into the atmosphere. And good Tuesday evening to ifif
