European Union foreign and defense ministers have ended a two-day 
meeting in Rome with a general agreement on the need to strengthen 
their defensive block. The grouping, The Western European Union has 
often been overshadowed by the US led NATO alliance in dealing with 
regional crises. The ministers have not fully explained their plan 
to coordinate their individual defense policies and transform their 
group into a coherent alliance to complement NATO. But several ministers 
say the meeting was the start of an extensive discussion on the matter. 
The ministers did agree to look into creating a single arms agency 
that would stop duplicate arms manufacturing by European nations.
