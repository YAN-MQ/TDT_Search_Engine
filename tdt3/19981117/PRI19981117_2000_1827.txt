For the World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in London. 
Israel's parliament has overwhelmingly approved the new peace agreement 
with the Palestinians. It allows for withdrawal of Israeli troops 
from more of the west bank. The agreement was passed after the opposition 
labor party joined the government in supporting the peace plan. The 
government has put off a key cabinet meeting until Thursday, that 
would pave the wave for the pull out. A spokesman said this was to 
give the Palestinian authority more time to take security measures 
demanded by Israel.
