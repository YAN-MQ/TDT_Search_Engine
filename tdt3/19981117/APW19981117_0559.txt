Eight oil workers abducted last week by a group of militant youths 
in southern Nigerian were released Tuesday unharmed and in good spirits, 
a Texaco official said. The oil workers _ three Americans, a Briton, 
an Italian, a Croatian, a South African and a Nigerian _ were taken 
hostage last week by armed youths from the ethnic Ijaw community who 
were demanding a ransom for their release. The hostages, working for 
various oil service companies on contract with Texaco, were taken 
from an exploration drilling rig near the Niger River delta in southern 
Nigeria. ``They appeared to have been well treated and look fine,'' 
said Yusuf N'jie, the assistant managing director of Texaco's joint 
venture company in Nigeria. Their release came after days of negotiations 
between the youths and representatives of Nigeria's military government. 
Details of the conditions leading to the hostages release were not 
made public. 6th graf pvs
