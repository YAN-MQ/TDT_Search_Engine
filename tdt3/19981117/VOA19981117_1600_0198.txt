Eight oil workers who were kidnapped in Southeastern Nigeria last 
week were released. The US oil company, Texaco, says its employees 
were released in good health after a round of negotiations, which 
appeared close to falling apart earlier in the day. VOA's John Pittman 
has details from our West Africa Bureau. Texaco says the workers, 
including three Americans, a Britain, a Croat and an Italian, a South 
African and a Nigerian, are all in good health. The men were freed 
in a group on Tuesday just hours after Texaco rejected an offer by 
the kidnappers to release them one by one. It remains unclear what 
changed in the negotiations, to secure the workers freedom. A Texaco 
spokesman has reportedly said the company did not meet any of the 
kidnapper's demands. The kidnappers initially asked for jobs and money 
for community development in exchange for the workers release. The 
kidnapper's identity remain a mystery. But they are believed to be 
young men from the Ejah ethnic group, which is leading a massive protest 
against the Nigerian government's oil policies. The eight men were 
working on an offshore platform when they were taken away by armed 
men last week. John Pittman, VOA News, West Africa Bureau.
