In a gradual but distinct change in policy, the British and Irish 
governments are relaxing pressure on the Irish Republican Army to 
disarm. The operation of the new Northern Ireland Assembly has been 
thwarted by the disarmament issue since the assembly was set up by 
a peace agreement approved in the spring. Protestant leaders say the 
IRA must start to disarm before its political wing, Sinn Fein, can 
fully take part in the new body. The IRA says it will not disarm until 
the peace agreement is fully enacted, an event scheduled for the spring 
of 2000. Last week, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland said the 
disarmament issue should be ``parked'' until the spring. On Monday, 
the highest British official in the north, Mo Mowlam, the Northern 
Ireland secretary, defended the early release of IRA and other prisoners 
despite the IRA's refusal to disarm. About half of the 400 prisoners, 
Catholics and Protestants convicted of terrorist acts, have been released 
early in recent months. The day before, in an unusually conciliatory 
statement, the chief of the Northern Ireland security forces said 
that the 16-month cease-fire being observed by the IRA could help 
bring permanent peace in the predominantly Protestant British province 
of Ulster. Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, 
who is in charge of 12,000 police officers and 15,000 British army 
troops in the province, was clearly trying to break the deadlock over 
disarmament. The police force is about 93 percent Protestant; the 
IRA has killed about 800 police officers and soldiers in the last 
29 years, but Flanagan, in an interview on Irish national radio, said 
that the IRA cease-fire would give politicians time to work out a 
final peace agreement. In effect, he was agreeing with Gerry Adams, 
the president of Sinn Fein. Adams has repeatedly said that while the 
IRA, with an arsenal estimated at 100 tons of weapons and explosives, 
will not disarm immediately, its cease-fire is convincing evidence 
that it wants a political solution to the conflict that has killed 
nearly 3,300 people since 1969. Flanagan referred to the cease-fires 
being observed by all but a few of the northern paramilitary groups, 
of which the IRA is the largest. But officials and experts said his 
words were aimed at reassuring Protestant politicians that the IRA 
cease-fire was genuine. ``That's a great irony,'' Flanagan said of 
the refusal to disarm and the cease-fire. ``While on the one hand 
they pose a threat, on the other hand, they pose the opportunity to 
deliver this true, lasting permanent peace.'' In another attempt to 
break the impasse, the highest Catholic official in the province, 
Seamus Mallon, the deputy first minister of the new assembly, said 
his mainstream Catholic Social Democratic Labor Party favored allowing 
Sinn Fein to hold Cabinet posts in the new Northern Ireland government, 
even if the IRA does not disarm immediately. Mallon, at a party conference 
on Saturday, said that if the IRA still had not disarmed by the final 
settlement in 2000, then he would move to have Sinn Fein expelled 
from the assembly. He said he was aware of Protestant Unionist fears 
that Sinn Fein would ``pocket'' concessions made by the British and 
Irish Republic governments, ``then will fail to honor'' its disarmament 
obligations. He also noted that Sinn Fein fears that the Protestant 
Unionists would keep finding obstacles to block the political reforms 
intended to give Catholics more power in the new government. ``We 
will not allow anyone to play political games,'' he said.
