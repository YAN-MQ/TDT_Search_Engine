Meanwhile, economic issues will top the agenda when President Clinton 
departs tomorrow for a five-day trip to Asia. David Ensor reports. 
Iraq or no Iraq, the Asian economic crisis is still too serious and 
the stakes for the U.S. too high, aides say, for the president to 
put off a chance to confer face-to-face with the leaders of Japan 
and south korea. Analysts agree. The stakes are the global economy. 
We're -- we're looking at the possibility of global recession if not 
global depression, and how to stop it. And what the U.S. and Japan 
do will determine that, so this meeting is extremely important. Mr. 
Clinton will press Japan, aides say, to open up its markets and reform 
its troubled banking system. He will also raise complaints by U.S. 
steel firms that Japan is dumping steel in this country at below-market 
prices. There's certainly concern at the surge in steel, the increase 
by over 500% of hot-rolled steel imports into the United States from 
Japan. The president is also making the trip to reassure uneasy Japan 
and south Korea that they remain America's key strategic partners 
in the region. When he went to China earlier in the year, he did not 
stop in Japan or korea. That was seen in both those countries as a 
bit of a snub. It hurt our relationships in those countries, so I 
think it's important for him to go back and assure them we remain 
committed as allies and good friends of those two countries. As for 
Iraq, White House officials say they expect it will be some days before 
U.N. inspectors will be fully tested the promises to cooperate with 
their efforts to uncover weapons of mass destruction. Enough time, 
aides say, for the president to go to Asia and be back again before 
the next possible showdown with Baghdad. David Ensor, CNN, the White 
House.
