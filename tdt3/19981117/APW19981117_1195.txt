The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday it may provide dlrs 100 
million in loans to Belarus next year if the country begins reforming 
its Soviet-style economy. The Belarusian government agreed to some 
IMF demands during two weeks of negotiations in the Belarusian capital, 
Minsk, Yulia Lyskova, an aide to the chief of the IMF mission in Belarus, 
said Tuesday. The talks ended Tuesday. If the government delivers 
on these promises and agrees to meet the rest of the IMF demands during 
the next round of talks planned for December, ``it would be possible 
to discuss the credit of about dlrs 100 million,'' Lyskova told The 
Associated Press. The money would be released in February or March, 
she said. The announcement comes two weeks after a delegation from 
the World Bank left Belarus saying no aid will be provided until the 
country begins economic reforms. Belarus has one of the most unreformed 
economies in the former Soviet Union, with most enterprises still 
under state control. It was rocked by an economic crisis this spring, 
with a dramatic slump in its currency prompting the government to 
order strict price controls. The current economic troubles in Russia 
_ traditionally the main customer for Belarusian goods _ has made 
Belarus' situation even worse. Pyotr Prokopovich, head of Belarus' 
National Bank, praised the results of the IMF talks. ``We have reached 
many constructive decisions and we hope that the IMF mission will 
continue its work in December,'' Prokopovich said. He also promised 
that Belarus would introduce a single exchange rate next year, as 
opposed to the five different rates it currently uses. The World Bank 
has repeatedly criticized Belarus for refusing to abide by an agreement 
to introduce a single rate. World Bank officials have said the lack 
of a single, objective rate has prevented the accumulation of hard-currency 
reserves and inaccurately reflected the country's health in trade 
and production.
