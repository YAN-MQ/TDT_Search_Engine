BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors arrived in Iraq on Tuesday 
and said they want to get back to work as soon as possible to test 
Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of mass destruction. 
``We are back, we are ready to work immediately,'' senior weapons 
inspector Jaakko Ylitalo told reporters shortly after his C-130 transport 
plane landed at the Iraqi military air base at Habaniya outside Baghdad 
just a little after 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT).
