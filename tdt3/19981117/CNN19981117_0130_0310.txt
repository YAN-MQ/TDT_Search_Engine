Authorities in Burlington, Wisconsin, have arrested three boys they 
say were planning a killing spree at their high school. Investigators 
say the boys, all 15 or 16 years old, conspired to kill 15 to 20 students, 
a teacher, the school principal and the assistant principal. They 
were arrested Sunday night after an informant tipped police to the 
alleged plot, which police say they had intended to carry out Monday. 
Parents in the small Wisconsin town are shocked. I'm very close with 
my kids. How could you not see signs? I would see something. You have 
to know. You would think that. It's sometimes difficult. Kids can 
be very deceiving and very conniving and do things to shock you. As 
much as we try, and I always suggest to parents that you always have 
to be on a vigil always questioning and always supervising and always 
wanting some answers. Some parents do that well and some parents do 
not. The three boys appeared in juvenile court Monday and were ordered 
held without bond. Police say two others backed out of the alleged 
plot but could be charged.
