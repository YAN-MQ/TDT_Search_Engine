Americans today are finally hearing the voice of Monica Lewinsky. 
The house Judiciary committee this morning released edited copies 
of Linda tripp's secretly recorded tapes of her phone conversations 
with the former White House intern. The 37 tapes contain 22 hours 
of conversations with Lewinsky about her relationship with the president. 
In this excerpt, Tripp advises Lewinsky to save her stained naviy 
blue dress. And I feel like this is what I would tell my own daughter. 
That's why I'm saying this to you. I would say to my own daughter, 
for your own ultimate protection which, I hope you never need it, 
but I don't want you to to take it away, either. I'm telling you, 
I would say this to my own daughter. She would tell me to off. I'll 
think about it. All right. I'll think about it. I just -- I -- Believe 
me, I know how you feel now. I just don't want do take away your options 
down did road if you need them. Believe me, I know better than anybody, 
probably, other than your mother, that you would never, ever use them 
if you didn't have to. I know this. Believe me. I just -- I don't 
trust the people around him. And I just want you to have that for 
you. Put it in a baggy, a ziploc bag, and you pack it in with your 
treasures for what I care, I mean, whatever. Put them under your antiques. 
What for, though? I don't know, Monica. It's this nagging awful feeling 
I have in the back of my head. What if I didn't have it? I know that, 
eye -- I think it's a blessing you do, and it could be your only insurance 
policy down did road or it can never be need and had you with throw 
it away. But I never, ever want to read about you going off the deep 
end because someone comes out and calls you a stalker or something 
and he confirms it. Something, God for bid, awful like that. In this 
day and age, I don't trust anybody. Maybe I'm being paranoid. If I 
am, indulge me. I'm not saying you should do it if you don't want 
to. I'm just saying, I think it would be a smart thing to do. And 
then put it somewhere where no one knows where it is but you. And 
you don't label it, obviously. You don't say -- I know, I know.
