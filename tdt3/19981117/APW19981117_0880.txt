A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in Kosovo suggested Tuesday for the 
first time that his side might settle for less than independence for 
the Serbian province. But the comments by Fehmi Agani, the head of 
the Albanian negotiating team, do not necessarily mean all Kosovo 
Albanian factions are ready to compromise and accept some form of 
autonomy. Ethnic Albanian guerrillas, who met the top U.S. envoy for 
Kosovo on Tuesday, have not indicated they would accept anything less 
than the independence they have been fighting for. Agani told The 
Associated Press his side had proposed giving the province the same 
status as Yugoslavia's two republics _ Serbia and Montenegro. ``A 
period of three to five years would be enough to see whether such 
a union could function,'' said Agani, who normally expresses views 
of moderate Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. ``If it could, 
we would want to stay in it. If not I don't see why we would stay.'' 
Agani's comments were the first time an ethnic Albanian leader has 
openly accepted the idea of autonomy, though even he indicated peaceful 
coexistence probably wasn't possible. Agani confirmed Tuesday that 
his delegation would not attend direct talks called for by Serbian 
President Milan Milutinovic. The ethnic Albanians refuse to talk without 
U.S. and European mediation, saying only foreign countries could guarantee 
that an eventual agreement would be implemented by the Serbian government. 
The Serbian government says the troubles in Kosovo, where hundreds 
of people have died and tens of thousands were left homeless in its 
crackdown against secessionists, are Serbia's internal matter and 
should not involve foreign mediators. U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, 
who has been shuttling between Belgrade and Pristina in an effort 
to find a compromise peace plan, met representatives of the ethnic 
Albanians' rebel Kosovo Liberation Army Tuesday. The meeting in the 
village of Dragobilje, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, 
was Hill's second with KLA representatives since Nov. 6. Adem Demaci, 
a guerrilla spokesman, praised Hill's decision to include the KLA. 
``Rugova can sign anything, but there could be no deal without KLA 
consent,'' Demaci said.
