Big tobacco has reached a proposed agreement with eight states to 
settle lawsuits over the health costs of smoking. Cigarettemakers 
would pay $206 billion over the next 27 years and there would be a 
ban on cigarette advertising on billboards, city buses and t-shirts. 
The deal falls short of the $369 billion national proposal that Congress 
killed last year. Some lawmakers say the new agreement does virtually 
nothing to protect public health, so the issue is not dead on Capitol 
Hill. The tobacco companies, year after year, have always figured 
out a way to get around any congressional action. I think when we 
bring a strong accountability effort up in the next session of Congress, 
it's going to be hard to paint that as a big government, big tax kind 
of proposal. And I think we'll be able to get momentum for that, where 
we were not able to get momentum in this last session. Much of the 
money would go toward efforts to cut teen smoking.
