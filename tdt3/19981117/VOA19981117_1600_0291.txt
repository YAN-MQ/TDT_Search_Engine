The American public is hearing for the first time the voice of Monica 
Lewinsky, the former White House intern at the center of the presidential 
sex and cover-up scandal. A House of Representatives Judiciary Committee 
has released 22 hours of tape recordings of conversations between 
Ms. Lewinsky and Pentagon worker Linda Tripp. Ms. Lewinsky admitted 
on one tape, that she was willing to lie in court. I think down deep 
you don't like having to lie. Of course, I don't think anybody likes 
to. I don't think anybody likes to but if, like - But the only thing 
to me is - This is how family is. This is, I would lie on the stand 
for my family. That is how I was raised as family. In the tapes, secretly 
recorded by Ms. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky can be heard candidly describing 
her affair with President Clinton. The Judiciary Committee begins 
impeachment hearings on Thursday.
