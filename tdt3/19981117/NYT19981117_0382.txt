Asia's economic troubles will depress oil and gasoline prices for 
nearly a decade, saving drivers roughly 13 cents a gallon in 2000 
alone, the U.S. Energy Department said Tuesday. While the Asian crisis 
has already helped cut energy costs, Tuesday's report offers the strongest 
evidence that the effects will be deep and long-lasting. In the United 
States, continued low energy prices are likely to restrain inflation, 
reducing the usual friction between strong growth and stable prices, 
economists say. Weak Asian demand and heavy global production also 
reduce the nation's vulnerability to oil-import disruption. But with 
crude oil at $12 to $15 a barrel, there are few economic incentives 
for saving energy or using renewable sources to reduce the carbon 
emissions often blamed for global warming. Falling production costs 
and the opening of new regions have added to supplies. Analysts at 
the Energy Department and the oil companies doubt that crude oil prices 
will necessarily remain at their current level below $13 a barrel. 
But the department, relying on economic forecasts by DRI/McGraw Hill, 
sees Asia recovering so slowly that the average price in 2000, adjusted 
for inflation, will still be below $14 a barrel. That compares with 
$20.61 predicted by the department last year before the scale of Asian 
troubles became evident. The Energy Information Administration does 
not see oil prices returning to where they would have been, excluding 
Asia's woes, until about 2007.
