United Nations weapons inspectors are back in Iraq, after Baghdad's 
last minute promise of unconditional cooperation narrowly averted 
US air strikes. A spokeswoman for the UN special commission says the 
inspectors will start work on Wednesday. VOA Middle East Correspondent 
Scott Bob reports, governments in the region are waiting to see if 
the Iraqi government will now fully comply with UN demands. A UN spokesman 
told reporters the UN inspectors would resume their work, Tuesday 
or Wednesday, and said the next few days would be very important. 
The inspectors returned three days after Iraq ended a three-month 
standoff with UN inspectors and thus avoided what were reportedly 
were to have been a wave of air strikes against it. People in neighboring 
Kuwait, which was occupied by Iraq eight years ago, are waiting to 
see whether Iraq will provide the full cooperation demanded by the 
UN Security Council. But many say they do not expect to see such cooperation, 
and as a result they believe another crisis is inevitable. Scott Bob, 
VOA News, Kuwait City. President Clinton, meanwhile is warning that 
US forces remain ready to strike if Baghdad reneges on its promise. 
The world is watching Saddam Hussein to see if he follows the words 
he uttered with deeds. Our forces remain strong and ready if he does 
not. Both the United States and Britain have indicated that an attack 
could come without warning, if Iraq interferes again with weapons 
inspections.
