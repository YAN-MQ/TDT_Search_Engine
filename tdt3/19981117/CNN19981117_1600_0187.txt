At the Asia-pacific economic conference in Malaysia, fall out continues 
from a speech by vice President Gore. Mr. Gore advocated democratic 
reform, and praised pro-democracy demonstrators in Malaysia. In a 
meeting with Russia's prime minister Primakov, Mr. Gore said he was 
proud to deliver America's message of democracy. Host Malaysia was 
outraged, saying the speech might incite more trouble. At the conference, 
the U.S. proposed a multibillion-dollar package to bail out Asian 
banks.
