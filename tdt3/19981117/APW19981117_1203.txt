Twelve workers were killed and three injured when an elevator at a 
building site plunged 20 floors into a basement Tuesday, police said. 
Ten Syrian and two Lebanese laborers were killed instantly after the 
elevator's cables snapped, sending it crashing from the 19th floor. 
Two Syrians and an Egyptian were seriously injured and taken to a 
hospital. The accident occurred because the workers had crowded into 
an elevator designed to carry a maximum of five people, said a police 
official, speaking under customary condition of anonymity. Lebanon, 
with a population of 3.2 million, plays host to many foreign laborers, 
including about 1 million Syrians who work mainly in construction 
and agriculture.
