The White House has accepted an offer to question independent counsel 
Ken starr, the lead witness when impeachment hearings begin Thursday. 
But White House attorneys want more time to do it. They're requesting 
90 minutes to cross-examine Starr instead of the 30 minutes the house 
Judiciary committee has allotted. This has been a busy day of preparations 
for that committee. It sorted through four boxes of additional material 
sent over by Starr just today. Sources say the information pertains 
to former associate attorney general webster Hubbell, who resigned 
because of charges in connection with whitewater. Investigators are 
looking into whether Hubbell was given hush money from clinton supporters 
to keep quiet about possible improprieties by Mr. clinton.
