Indianapolis may have little in common with Pont-Aven, the picturesque 
village in Brittany that Paul Gauguin painted into art history more 
than a century ago, but Tuesday the Indianapolis Museum of Art acquired 
17 paintings and 84 prints by Gauguin and his Pont-Aven followers 
that will forever link the two towns. The museum purchased the paintings, 
which are valued at about $30 million, from Samuel Josefowitz, a retired 
77-year-old Swiss businessman and well-known collector, with the help 
of a $20 million challenge grant from the Lilly Endowment, an Indianapolis 
philanthropy. The museum is raising about $10 million to complete 
the purchase. Josefowitz, a trustee of the museum since 1990, is contributing 
an undisclosed amount to that effort and is donating all of the prints, 
which are estimated to be worth more than $1 million. The artworks, 
which capture a pivotal moment in modern art, vastly upgrade the Indianapolis 
museum's holdings, which are strong in old masters, watercolors by 
J.M.W. Turner, Chinese and African art and Neo-Impressionist paintings 
by the followers of Georges Seurat. ``The combination of the Pont-Aven 
things with the Neo-Impressionist things will give us examples of 
the two competing schools of modernism from that era that you won't 
find anywhere else in the United States,'' Bret Waller, the museum's 
director, said. The museum, whose collection includes Cezanne's ``House 
in Provence,'' van Gogh's ``Landscape at St. Remy,'' Seurat's ``Channel 
of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe'' and two other Gauguins, can now 
claim to be a regional center for late 19th-century French art. In 
a telephone interview from his home in Lausanne, Switzerland, Josefowitz 
said that making a difference was an important consideration in deciding 
to part with these artworks. ``I'm very happy that the Indianapolis 
museum has a chance to expand,'' he said. ``For a big museum this 
wouldn't be such a major thing.'' The acquisition also fit the requirements 
of the Lilly Endowment, which had previously agreed to finance a purchase 
that significantly enhanced the museum's profile as a cultural destination. 
Among the museum's new treasures are Gauguin's ``Flageolet Player 
on the Cliff,'' ``Still Life With Profile of Laval'' and ``Christmas 
Night''; Emile Bernard's ``Pont-Aven Seen From the Bois d'Amour'' 
and ``Breton Women at a Wall,'' and works by Maurice Denis, Paul Serusier, 
Henry Moret and Jan Verkade. The museum plans to unveil the paintings 
and prints in a show beginning next March. While the public associates 
Gauguin most strongly with his days in Tahiti, many art historians 
consider his time in Pont-Aven, which he first visited in 1886, to 
have been more formative. ``It was in Pont-Aven _ not in Paris or 
anywhere else _ that Gauguin became Gauguin, the father and grandfather 
of modes of feeling and utterance that have counted for a great deal 
in the art of our century,'' wrote John Russell in The New York Times 
in 1986. There, together with Bernard, Gauguin formulated the principles 
of Synthetism, which fused the artist's subjective reaction to nature 
with his sense of design. Artists of the School of Pont-Aven made 
works with simple shapes and rhythmic surface patterns, unshadowed 
lighting and flat colors inspired as much by imagination as by nature. 
Josefowitz, who was born in Lithuania, is a former chemical engineer 
who made his fortune as a co-founder of mail-order book and record 
clubs in 21 countries. He assembled most of his Pont-Aven collection 
in the 1950s and '60s, when few people recognized the significance 
of the movement. In the mid-1990s, the collection toured several American 
cities, including Indianapolis, San Diego, Baltimore and Memphis. 
Josefowitz said that he had not intended to sell the works but that 
he had nevertheless suggested the idea when Ellen Wardwell Lee, the 
museum's chief curator, called him in September 1997 to ask about 
acquiring a Neo-Impressionist work from his collection. ``I said, 
`Maybe you should think about making a Pont-Aven room instead,''' 
Josefowitz recalled. He had met Ms. Lee in 1983, when she was doing 
research for a catalog of the museum's Neo-Impressionist collection, 
and they had forged a relationship. Once he and the museum agreed 
in principle, Josefowitz said he let Ms. Lee choose the works she 
wanted. But there were some reservations. ``He wanted to hang on to 
some for his family,'' said Ms. Lee, who was also in Lausanne, supervising 
the packing. Although Josefowitz frequently lends his art to museums 
_ two paintings going to Indianapolis had just been returned from 
an exhibition in Munich _ Ms. Lee said that ``we are not robbing any 
museum, we are robbing Sam's walls.'' But not completely. Josefowitz 
also owns collections of Post-Impressionist works by the Pointillists 
and by the Nabis, a group of French artists, of old master drawings 
and of African and pre-Columbian art, and they fill the walls of his 
home in Paris and another near Oxford, England, as well as the one 
in Lausanne. The art world can only continue to wonder where these 
works will eventually go. ``This whole thing was very impromptu on 
my part,'' Josefowitz said. ``I'm planning to enjoy the rest of my 
collection for many years, though some will eventually go to other 
museums and some more to Indianapolis.''
