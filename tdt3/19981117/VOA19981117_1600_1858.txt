Turkey says it will not extradite Kurdish Rebel leader Abdullah Urjallon 
at the same time the Italian Prime Ministers says Rome will not grant 
political asylum to Mr. Urjallon unless it is convinced that he has 
renounced terrorism. Turkey wants him extradited to face charges of 
terrorism and treason. His Kurdistan Workers Party has been fighting 
Turkey for 14 years to gain Kurdish self-rule.
