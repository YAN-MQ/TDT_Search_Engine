Malaysia says it will hold Washington accountable for any unrest caused 
by Vice President Al Gore's pro-democracy comments. He angered Malaysia's 
government yesterday in a speech encouraging the opposition to seek 
change. Mr. Gore's pro democracy speech has not been entirely welcomed 
by the opposition either. Spokesman Lin Kits Yang. There is a worry 
that there may be a backlash that the political foment in the country 
for change, for democracy may be as a foreign inspired foreign masterminded 
movement when it is a local group completely. Malaysian opposition 
spokesman Lin Kits Yang.
