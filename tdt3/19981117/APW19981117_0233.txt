In the streets of Kuala Lumpur, U.S. Vice President Al Gore's heavy-handed 
criticism of Malaysia hit a sour note among average citizens on Tuesday. 
``He should learn to exercise diplomacy,'' said businessman Kamal 
Abu Bakar, as he stood curbside trying to flag down taxis driving 
past the Renaissance Hotel. Gore and his delegation are staying at 
the gleaming downtown hotel. ``The vice president's merely encouraging 
demonstrators here to riot with his below-the-belt comments,'' Kamal 
added, shaking his head. Gopal Krishnan, a retired Army officer walking 
past the Renaissance Hotel on the way to a bank, was in an even scrappier 
mood. ``If I could meet Al Gore face-to-face, I would tell him to 
get lost,'' he said, as he crumpled his tweed cap in his hands. ``What 
right does he have, talking about human rights when people in his 
country send their aged parents to old folks' homes to die?'' On Monday, 
Gore infuriated Malaysian leaders when he sympathized with the ``brave 
people of Malaysia'' who are part of a growing street protest movement 
that calls for an end to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year 
rule. Mahathir sacked his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 2. Anwar's 
subsequent arrest and alleged beating while in police custody have 
outraged world leaders. Anwar is standing trial on 10 charges of corruption 
and sexual misconduct, allegations he denies and calls trumped up 
to undermine his challenge to Mahathir. Since Anwar's arrest, ``Reformasi,'' 
or reform in the Malay language, has become the battle cry of the 
anti-government demonstrations here. ``In a way, I'm glad the U.S. 
vice president said what he did, because I support reformasi,'' said 
a 35-year-old office-cleaner, who was too scared to give her name. 
``But I'm also wondering why Gore doesn't criticize his own boss, 
who's been caught with his pants down,'' she added, slurping from 
a bowl of curry noodles. Even the rare individual who backed Gore's 
comments wasn't really happy, either. ``It's all words, words, words!'' 
said senior accountant Ronald Khoo, swatting a rolled-up Wall Street 
Journal against his palm. ``For the U.S. to send a really strong signal 
to Malaysia, Bill Clinton should order one of his aircraft carriers 
to drop anchor in our waters,'' he said, standing near the Hard Rock 
Cafe. Mail messenger Amran Ibrahim, 24, had a more expansive view 
of the political fracas roiling Malaysia as he sipped a traditional 
Malay frothy milk-and-tea concoction under a shady tree behind the 
five-star Renaissance Hotel. ``It's peaceful here,'' he said, gesturing 
to office-workers standing in line to buy food from nearby stalls. 
``What can we get from reformasi? Only riots, fights and demonstrations.''
