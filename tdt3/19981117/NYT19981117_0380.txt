Novell Corp. and Cisco Corp., two major players in the computer networking 
industry, will announce Wednesday that they have agreed to make their 
software and hardware broadly compatible. The move is seen as a victory 
for Novell in its effort to halt the advances of Microsoft Corp.'s 
Windows NT, an operating system that incorporates office networking 
technologies, a market that Novell once dominated. Directory programs 
that permit computers and computer users to track the location of 
network resources have become increasingly crucial as business networks 
have grown to include tens of thousands of computers, printers, servers 
and disk storage systems. Cisco, the largest player in the market 
for network routers and switches, has previously agreed to support 
Microsoft's Active Directory service for office networks. However, 
both Microsoft's Windows NT and its Active Directory software projects 
have suffered lengthy delays and will not be available until sometime 
next year. Novell has refined its Netware Directory Services, or NDS, 
software and has struck compatibility agreements with both Lucent 
Technologies and Nortel, two other makers of computer networking gear. 
``Cisco's customers pushed very hard for a directory deal with Novell,'' 
said Novell chairman and chief executive Eric Schmidt. ``This permits 
both management and remote configuration of Cisco routers and switches 
from our software.''
