We have tonight the first look at a freak tornado that ripped through 
a Small town in south African. The footage is incredible. It was taken 
as the storm was in progress. Tornadoes this large are very rare in 
that country. The town of harrismith got the worst of it. Dozens were 
injured and sent to hospitals. It was a massive storm, the likes of 
which you would see in the American midwest. Hundreds more have been 
left homeless tonight. But there the towering funnel as recorded on 
videotape in south Africa.
