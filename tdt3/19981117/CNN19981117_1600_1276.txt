For the sixth time in eight years, an Atlanta Braves pitcher takes 
home the cy young award. For the second time in his career, it's Tom 
glavine. The lefty and his 20-6 record edged San Diego reliever Trevor 
Hoffman and his 53 saves by just 11 points in the voting. You can 
see from the breakdown Hoffman received more first place votes than 
glavine. But glavine's the first pitcher to ever win the honor without 
receiving the most first place votes.
