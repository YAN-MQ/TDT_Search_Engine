Now to our special series with "the Wall Street Journal" -- "bitter 
pill." Together with "the journal" this week, we're looking at the 
high cost of prescription drugs in this country. Tonight -- the tough 
choices and terrible problems that can happen when families find they 
can't pay for the medicine they need. Here's NBC's Jim Cummins. Dave 
Butler, a short-order cook, faced an impossible choice -- his wife 
Emily has a serious mental illness, no insurance to pay for her expensive 
drugs, up to $1,000 a month. Dave was forced to pay out of his own 
pocket so that Emily could get the critical drugs. I can't afford 
not to get 'em or else they'll lock her up and throw away the key. 
But the cost was too great. The butlers were so desperate that they 
had only one alternative -- get a Divorce so that she could qualify 
for government disability aid. We fought it for two years, even when 
we knew we didn't want it. I guess that piece of paper meant a lot 
to us. The marriage license? Yeah. The butlers are among an estimated 
40 million working-age americans who do not have health insurance 
and must pay top dollar for their prescription drugs. It's even worse 
for people 65 and older who are covered by Medicare because that coverage 
usually does not include the cost of prescription drugs, which have 
become the single largest health care expense for the elderly. What 
are we going to do? Are we going to get our prescription filled? Are 
we going to skip meals? Are we going to not pay a Bill? Kate Stahl 
of the Minnesota senior federation says there are price controls on 
prescription drugs in every major country except the U.S. so she helped 
organize two bus trips to Canada for about 140 Americans not covered 
by insurance to buy their prescription drugs at a discount. The bus 
as a whole, averaged out, saved about 47%. And that's remarkable. 
But when members of Stahl's group tried to refill their Canadian prescriptions 
through the mail, U.S. customs intercepted the deliveries, and the 
government warned them not to import prescription drugs. The drug 
companies say they need to charge high prices to pay for developing 
new drugs, and they do have a program to help more than 1 million 
Americans buy their prescription drugs. But millions of others do 
not get any help and are forced to make impossible choices, like the 
butlers, who had to divorce so that she could get her medicine. Jim 
Cummins, NBC news, mankato, Minnesota.
