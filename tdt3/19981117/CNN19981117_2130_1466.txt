The bad boy of basketball might have to clean up his act for the missus. 
Dennis Rodman married former "baywatch" actress Carmen Electra Saturday

was drunk at the time and questioned if the marriage was legal. Today, 
Rodman issued a statement saying he loves his new wife and apologized 
for any misleading remarks made on his behalf.
