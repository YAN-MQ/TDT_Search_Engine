From National Public Radio news in Washington, I'm Cory Flintoff. 
Two days before independent counsel Kenneth Starr's appearance before 
the House Judiciary Committee, partisan attacks are growing. Committee 
Republicans are pressing for a vote on articles of impeachment while 
Democrats say the process is unfair and they may boycott the hearing. 
NPR's Peter Kenyon reports. Georgia Republican Bob Barr says those 
who think the president should be censured but not removed from office 
should support impeachment, which is an expression that the president 
has committed serious offenses. ... which the House believes ought 
to be the grounds for his removal from office. But it does not remove 
a president from office. For those who want censure, that is the constitutional 
process of censuring. Democrats meanwhile, say the hearing process 
is outrageous and unfair and minority leader Dick Gephardt says they 
may boycott Thursday's hearing. A committee aide calls that threat 
a big bluff. The aide says there will be witnesses other than Starr, 
but they may be deposed rather than invited to testify in person.
