Speaking of a different type of football, Europe's leading football 
clubs have accepted a proposal to expand the Champion's League Competition 
to 32 teams, and eliminate the Cup Winner's Cup. The 14 teams meeting 
in Madrid, Spain agreed to reforms that would expand the Champion's 
league from 24 teams, and combine the Cup Winner's Cup and UAFFA Cups 
into one tournament. However, the football clubs decided to set up 
a five-man commission to negotiate financial matters, including television 
rights. The reforms still require final approval by the UAFFA Executive 
Committee, which is scheduled to meet in Jerusalem in December. The 
agreement reached Tuesday, appears to put an end to talk of a rival 
super-league in European football. The proposed league was planned 
by the Media-Partners group and would have been in direct competition 
with the Champion's league.
