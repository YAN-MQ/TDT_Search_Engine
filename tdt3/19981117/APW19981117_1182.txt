The struggling Chicago Blackhawks dealt much-shopped center Roman 
Vopat to the Philadelphia Flyers for left wing Mike Maneluk on Tuesday. 
Vopat, a 22-year-old Czech native, started the season with the Los 
Angeles Kings. He was traded to the Colorado Avalanche Oct. 29, then 
sent to Chicago Nov. 10. He had no points in three games with the 
Blackhawks, who were 4-10-3 going into Tuesday night's game. In 85 
National Hockey League games, Vopat has six goals and 11 assists. 
The trade came one day after Chicago acquired goalie Jocelyn Thibault 
and defensemen Dave Manson and Brad Brown from the Montreal Canadiens 
for goalie Jeff Hackett, defenseman Eric Weinrich and minor league 
defenseman Alain Nasreddine. Maneluk had two goals and six assists 
in 13 games for Philadelphia this season. The former Canadian National 
Team member had 68 points in the AHL last season.
