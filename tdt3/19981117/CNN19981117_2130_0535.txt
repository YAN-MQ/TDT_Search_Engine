The international monetary fund and several other world economic bodies 
are setting up a debt-service trust fund for countries affected by 
hurricane mitch. The arrangement would suspend interest payments on 
loans so the governments could rebuild roads and other infrastructure, 
and the lenders are considering forgiving some debt for the hardest 
hit countries. Mitch killed 11,000 people and caused billions of dollars 
damage.
