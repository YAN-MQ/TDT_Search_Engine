Finally this evening, try to cash in on the millennium. Last night, 
we focused on the minor debate about when it will be. We pretty much 
agreed it'll be in 2000, not 2001. And we touched on the significance 
for many Christians. Tonight, the significance for those who are angling 
for millennium profit. Here is ABC's Michele Norris. Even 409 days 
before the millennium, businesses are hoping that the turn of the 
century will turn into profits. It's an entrepreneur's dream if you 
have the right product. Never has there been such a rush to market 
so many products for a Single event. It's a once in a 1,000-year business 
opportunity. The U.S. patent and trademark office has been swamped 
with requests to market all kinds of things related to the millennium, 
more than 2,000 applications so far. This is a clock that is counting 
down to the millennium. The days, the hours, the minutes the seconds. 
There's the patented millennium clock and the patented millennium 
candy. About this millennium thing. And, of course, champagne. Official 
champagne of the millennial celebration. There's a toothbrush for 
the millennium, millennium steaks, jewelry, toys, clothing, something 
for everyone from cradle to grave. I would describe the millennium 
casket as a casket that represents a high degree of quality and workmanship. 
That's right, a stainless steel casket for the millennium. Your grandchildren 
are going to ask you, "where were you when we went into the next millennium?" 
So I think there's a tremendous feeding frenzy there. Chocolate bars. 
Savvy entrepreneurs have registered millennial phrases, Y2K and 01-01-00, 
the first day of the big year. Robert guberman is a smart man. Five 
years ago he had the good sense to Register a trademark for the "year 
2000" phrase. He and the lucky owners of other millennial trademarks 
are entitled to at least 8% from the sale of any product that carries 
their registered name. It's expected to add up to millions. I still 
pinch myself when I get up in the morning and I say, you know, we 
really have it. We have that piece of paper that says we own it. Still, 
it's too early to tell if millennial products will catch on. Consumers 
are greeting the millennium with a big yawn. But analysts say more 
consumers may catch millennial fever as the clock ticks closer to 
the big event. Michele Norris, ABC News, New York.
