Widely anticipated cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board 
did not invigorate the stock market Tuesday. Prices, which have rallied 
sharply the last six weeks, closed mixed in moderate trading. Stocks 
moved lower early in the session, then jumped abruptly in midafternoon 
after the Fed announced its third cut in the overnight federal funds 
rate and second reduction in its discount rate in the last seven weeks. 
But sellers emerged in the last hour of trading, particularly in big, 
blue-chip issues. The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell as 
much as 82 points in the morning and was up as much as 91 after the 
Fed's announcement, closed down 24.97, or nearly 03. percent, at 8,986.28. 
Nearly all the average's decline resulted from a sharp slide in Hewlett-Packard, 
which closed at 60 1/16, down 5 15/16. Hewlett-Packard warned that 
first-quarter earnings might fall and that sales in its 1999 fiscal 
year were not likely to meet forecasts because of increased competition 
and weakness in Asia and Latin America. Most broader market indexes 
did better than the Dow. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index 
rose 3.46, or 0.3 percent, to 1,139.32. And the Nasdaq composite index 
gained 16.84, or .09 percent, to 1,878.52. But the Russell 2000 index 
of mostly small-capitalization stocks dipped 0.99 point, or a quarter 
of 1 percent, closing at 389.43. ``We have come a very long way in 
a very short time,'' said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. 
Edwards, noting that since Oct. 8 the Dow rose 21 percent; the S&AMP;P 
500, 24 percent, and the Nasdaq composite, 39 percent. ``The market 
was doing some consolidating last week and is likely to be doing some 
more of that,'' he said. ``But I don't see a lot of downside risk 
below 8,600 on the Dow. If there had been a 1-in-3 risk of a recession 
next year before the Fed started to cut rates, it has been reduced 
to a risk of 1 in 10.'' The cuts in the federal funds rate and the 
discount rate pushed those two rates to their lowest levels in four 
years and helped lift prices of financial service and bank stocks, 
which have been on the rise since the Fed began to cut rates in late 
September. J.P. Morgan and American Express, two Dow stocks, rose 
for the second consecutive day. Morgan gained 3}, to 107\. American 
Express rose 2 7/16, to 99]. BankAmerica rose 1 5/16, to 61 1/16, 
and Chase Manhattan climbed 3 7/16, to 61 3/16. Brokerage stocks also 
gained. Merrill Lynch rose 3[, to 66|, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
closed at 66|, up 2 9/16. But not everyone was sanguine. Richard Bernstein, 
chief quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch, said Hewlett-Packard 
was not likely to be the last company to issue a somber message on 
earnings for the coming year. ``Most people think that if you get 
Fed easing, you will get earnings growth,'' he said. ``But we are 
in a period where earnings growth is negative. That is something people 
have pretty much ignored over the last six to seven weeks.'' With 
interest rates at current levels, Bernstein said stocks were between 
10 and 20 percent above what he considered fair valuation. Slumping 
crude oil prices, which fell to a 10-year low in London and a 4-year 
low in New York, pushed down oil stocks. Chevron fell 2{, to 80}. 
Exxon dropped 15/16, to 70 9/16. And Mobil lost 11/16, to 71 15/16. 
With much fanfare, DaimlerChrysler, formed by the merger of Daimler-Benz 
and Chrysler, introduced its shares on the New York Stock Exchange 
yesterday. But the stock ended lower, closing at 83~, down 7/16. The 
stars of Nasdaq includedAmazon.com. Shares in the online bookseller 
soared 22\, to 148{, after it said it had opened an online video store 
to compete with Hollywood Entertainment's Reel.com Web site. Bigger 
high-technology companies that trade on the Nasdaq system also moved 
higher. Microsoft gained 3 1/16, to 111~. Cisco Systems rose 1 13/16, 
to 68}. And Intel closed at 108{, up 1|. K-Tel International was one 
of the session's biggest losers. The seller of music, videos and other 
entertainment was notified by Nasdaq that it had failed to meet the 
minimum tangible net asset requirement for trading, and faced delisting. 
The stock tumbled 5|, to 12.
