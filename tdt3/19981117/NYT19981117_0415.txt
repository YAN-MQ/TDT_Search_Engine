The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 18: Malaysia's 
prime minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, is fuming, and his countrymen 
should relish every second of his discomfort. Vice President Al Gore 
and other foreign leaders have used an economic summit meeting in 
Mahathir's capital to call for greater democracy and economic reform 
in Malaysia. Championing the cause of freedom and human rights with 
a zest that he has rarely demonstrated before, Gore was especially 
effective in defending the cause of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's former 
deputy prime minister. Anwar was jailed in September on dubious charges 
of corruption and sexual misconduct and is now on trial. Most Malaysians 
recognize the case for what it is, namely a political vendetta against 
one of Southeast Asia's most articulate and thoughtful reformers. 
Anwar's supporters have been roughed up in the streets and otherwise 
intimidated. But their movement has endured and become a force for 
needed political and economic change. Gore was not the only visiting 
foreigner to raise concerns about the Anwar case. Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright made a point of visiting Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, 
Anwar's wife, as did President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines and 
Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy. Diplomatic protocol calls 
for speaking positively of one's hosts. Gore, Ms. Albright and the 
others were right to be rude. America's interest in Asia is to encourage 
human rights and democratic change, not to flatter embattled autocrats.
