This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Wednesday. A storm developing across the intermountain 
west will move through the rocky mountains and the northern plains 
states on Wednesday, producing rain and snow and some windy conditions 
that could cause near blizzard conditions over parts of the dakotas 
and Minnesota. Things will be quieter out across the west as the system 
moves away. Things will quiet in the northeast as well, with high 
pressure influencing the weather. Cool though, just 30s and 40s northeast, 
20s and 30s over the northern plains. The southeast rather mild. We're 
looking for highs in the 60s and 70s. Looking ahead to Thursday, we'll 
see snow in the northern Great Lakes, rain and thunderstorms through 
the southeast. Then on Friday, our wet and snowy weather pushes east 
with rain across the northwest. For Saturday, rain and wind in the 
northwest. Some snow showers lingering in the northeast.
