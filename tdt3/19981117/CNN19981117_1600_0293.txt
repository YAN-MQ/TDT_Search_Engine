Police in the Netherlands are searching for the thieves who stole 
a Multimillion-dollar shipment of Viagra from a warehouse. The shipment 
of the impotence-fighting pills is worth at least $16 million. The 
theft was discovered by a truck driver who was supposed to drive the 
pills to Spain. Viagra is reportedly a big seller on the black market 
in the Netherlands.
