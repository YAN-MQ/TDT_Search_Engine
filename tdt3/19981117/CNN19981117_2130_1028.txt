Thousands of frequent Flyers fought a major airline and won a few 
extra miles. In today's edition of "working ahead," Kalin Thomas-Samuel 
has the first of two reports on the settlement. Delta is finally settling 
a class action suit filed ten years ago. The suit says Delta illegally 
imposed what are called "capacity controls" on free airline tickets 
back in 1988 without notifying their frequent flyer members in advance. 
A capacity control means that you can't always fly when you want to 
on a Free ticket. The airlines have decided there are only certain 
times and certain flights and a certain number of seats per plane 
that are available for award tickets. A week doesn't go by where I 
don't hear from a member of the frequent-flyer program that wants 
to hear of a lawyer's name that specializes in suing the frequent-flyer 
programs. So I think there's a lot of frustration out there on using 
these awards. Most of the suits filed by frequent Flyers are tossed 
out of court. But Delta has decided to settle out of court. A notice 
about the preliminary approval of the settlement went out to almost 
600,000 eligible members a few weeks ago. Tomorrow -- the terms of 
the settlement, expected to receive court approval in January. Kaelin 
Thomas-Samuel, CNN, Atlanta.
