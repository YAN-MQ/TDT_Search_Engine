Confidence in Hong Kong is coming back, despite the government's controversial 
intervention in the stock and futures markets, a top Wall Street executive 
said Tuesday. Philip Purcell, chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
and Co., said that although foreign investors were shaken by the government's 
foray into the markets, he was ``surprisingly positive'' that Hong 
Kong's markets would remain free. ``Everybody understands that the 
government was in a difficult position,'' Purcell told a luncheon 
audience. Purcell said Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang's 
recent assurances to European and U.S. investors that the government 
was committed to a free and open market were ``very convincing.'' 
Purcell said effective regulations and a liberal market were ``not 
in conflict.'' Meanwhile, Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong 
Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto central bank, said 
late Tuesday that the threat of another speculative attack on Hong 
Kong's financial markets ``has not disappeared.'' ``There are so many 
unknowns,'' Yam told reporters. Yam added that the massive 946 billion 
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 122 billion) in reserves ``can be used 
again'' to defend the currency's 15-year-old peg to the U.S. dollar 
if necessary. In August, the Hong Kong government spent U.S. dlrs 
15 billion to scoop up shares and futures contracts in an effort to 
drive stock prices up to levels at which speculators _ who bet the 
market would fall _ would be stuck with huge losses. Hong Kong officials 
said they were not concerned about people betting on lower stock prices. 
But they said they had to draw the line at speculators who were selling 
the Hong Kong dollar at the same time, forcing Hong Kong to raise 
interest rates, and thereby pushing stocks lower.
