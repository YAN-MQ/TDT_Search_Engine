In a way no one anticipated, the election two weeks ago is breaking 
up one of the most powerful cliques on Capitol Hill -- the republican 
leadership in the house. All conservative white males, most of them 
from the south. Newt Gingrich is out as speaker and the battle is 
joined for the number two leadership job. Tonight NBC's Gwen Ifill 
on one candidate who wants to break the mold. In a world of dark suits 
and backroom politics, Jennifer Dunn has always been a standout. I 
want the talk to him about the majority leader's race. Now she wants 
to make history, as the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in the 
House of Representatives. You've been saying that it's important for 
you to be elected in part because you would be a symbol. I wanted 
to pick up the banner and say, "you need my strengths these days for 
our success in this party." But who is Jennifer Dunn? A child of the 
prosperous Seattle suburbs, where her conservative, republican father 
taught her to shoot a gun, and where she beat her brother at boxing. 
A divorced mother of two grown sons, who models herself after the 
first politician she ever campaigned for, Ronald Reagan, even naming 
her younger son Reagan. Her mentor on Capitol Hill, Newt Gingrich. 
But with his fall, Dunn's star has risen. She hopes. He's still supporting 
Armey. I hear rumors about how that's not going any place. Locked 
in a three-way battle with congressmen Dick Armey and steve Largent 
for the number two post in the house, her fight is all uphill. How 
do you win? It's a very personal election. You call every single member. 
I believe I can be a very good messenger for folks who haven't been 
touched before by the republican party. Some conservatives, for instance, 
question her position on abortion. Dunn says she supports a woman's 
right to choose, but that the federal government shouldn't pay for 
it. But after six years in Congress, Dunn thinks she has the formula 
to fix the traumatized republican party -- a new public face that 
is neither southern, nor male. But is looking the part good enough? 
She's a good old-fashioned political street fighter, too. Dunn may 
not win tomorrow. But when democrats elected their leaders yesterday, 
no women made that cut, either. Dunn wants to change all that. And 
use some of her old boxing skills to beat down the doors of the old 
boys' club in Congress. Gwen Ifill, NBC news, the capitol.
