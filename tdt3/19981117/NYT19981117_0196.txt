For the legions who drive sport utility vehicles to work on Wall Street, 
wear high-tech mountain gear to suburban barbecues and keep Jon Krakauer's 
Everest adventure story, ``Into Thin Air,'' on the best-seller list, 
another spectator sport is catching on: collecting exploration art. 
That rubric covers the paraphernalia used by the great explorers _ 
their oxygen cylinders, packing crates, rations cups, Holy Bibles 
and climbing shoes _ as well as photographs, paintings, maps and charts, 
many of which were drawn on the spot of previously uncharted terrain. 
The genre spans nearly 500 years of exploration from the early sea 
voyages of the 1400s to the Everest climbs of the 1950s. But only 
recently have such artifacts been marketed under the heading of exploration 
art. ``We've got a whole new audience of people who are just interested 
in that word exploration,'' said Nicholas Lambourn, associate director 
at Christie's. ``It reflects what's going on in literature.'' Two 
years ago Lambourn began ``Exploration and Travel,'' a sale held twice 
a year at Christie's in London, featuring topographical pictures, 
books and manuscripts. Selling the idea of exploration, Lambourn added, 
``has brought us new material, especially from the Antarctic field.'' 
While map and book collectors are generally interested only in the 
objects themselves, fans of exploration art are often attracted by 
the narratives they evoke _ the more harrowing the better. ``The Ravine 
of the Desert,'' an 1838 landscape, set in Mexico, by the British 
painter Daniel Thomas Egerton, commanded $243,193 at a recent Christie's 
sale. The biographical detail that the artist and his female companion 
were murdered there by bandits in 1842 no doubt buoyed the price. 
Anything touched by a famous explorer has a talismanic quality. A 
plywood packing case is a treasure if it traveled with the British 
adventurer Sir Ernest Shackleton on his Nimrod expedition to the South 
Pole in 1907. It sold at Christie's last year for $20,000 _ 20 times 
the pre-sale estimate. Relics related to the Antarctic martyr, the 
gallant Capt. Lawrence E.G. Oates, a volunteer on the British explorer 
Robert Scott's final expedition to the South Pole, have a following 
among collectors. Slowed by frostbite, Oates sacrificed himself by 
walking out into a blizzard so that the others in the party could 
continue. (They eventually perished, too.) ``I'm just going out now, 
and I may be some time,'' Oates had famously said. Even a monogrammed 
canvas bathtub he used in the Boer War recently fetched $2,898. Other 
oddball artifacts have new viability on the market: petrol lanterns 
and medicine bottles, for example, left behind in huts blackened by 
blubber-fueled fires. At a recent Christie's auction, two pair of 
woolen mittens belonging to the commanding officer of the Commonwealth 
Transarctic expedition of 1955-1958 were part of a lot that sold for 
about $575. But exploration art has come to comprise more than historical 
artifacts. With the globe now thoroughly conquered, the concept of 
exploration has branched into the surreal. Witness the installation 
artists Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick, who joyfully document 
explorations that never happened. Most recently they depicted an imaginary 
Siberian expedition undertaken by a so-called Royal Excavation Corps. 
It is recorded with panoramic, sepia-toned photographs and diaries 
along with texts awash in magic realism and artifacts like a bark 
covered in python skin. Photographs stamped with the the corps' ``official'' 
seal feature actors dressed as explorers and a local shaman; the pictures 
are creased in the manner of old charts that were carried and abused 
en route. Antique postcards are altered for the artists' purposes, 
and some of the picaresque protagonists depicted in the plot did exist 
in life. Called ``The Circular River: the Siberian Expedition 1944-46,'' 
the work is on display at Monique Knowlton gallery in Soho through 
next Jan. 9. ``The whole thing is a giant forgery,'' said Kahn, 34. 
``We don't mind it being known as a forgery as long as no one asks 
how we do it or which characters are real.'' The team's works have 
been bought by the Fogg Museum of Art at Harvard University and the 
Philadelphia Museum of Art. Where is the next frontier in exploration-art 
collecting? Artifacts of early aviation, including canvas fragments 
from old planes and hot-air balloons, are avidly sought. Atlases of 
sea charts are more popular than maps because they have actually been 
used by navigators during a voyage, said Selby Kiffer, senior vice 
president of American manuscripts at Sotheby's. Space artifacts, too, 
have been tapped by Sotheby's, in a 1993 sale of memorabilia from 
the Russian space program. Among the items were satellites, space 
suits and moon dust, which alone sold for $440,000. Kiffer suggested 
that arm-chair adventurers might next turn their attention to explorations 
below the sea. ``The field I haven't seen much in is undersea exploration,'' 
he said. But maybe Kahn and Selesnick have it right: all that's really 
left to be explored is the mind.
