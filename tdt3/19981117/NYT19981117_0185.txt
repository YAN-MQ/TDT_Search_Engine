Can Kermit (the frog), Merlin (the wizard) and Trapper John (M.D.) 
coexist on the same cable channel, cheek by jowl with ethicists and 
professors of religion? The Jim Henson Co. and Hallmark Entertainment, 
already partners in television ventures, took over 45 percent ownership 
of the Odyssey Channel Monday. Henson and Hallmark shows will be added 
to Odyssey's lineup of faith-and-values programs. Margaret Loesch, 
former chief of the Fox Kids Network who became president of the Henson 
Television Group in February, was named president and chief executive 
of the new Odyssey Channel. She said it would be a family network, 
but geared to adults rather than children. Odyssey is also owned by 
the Liberty Media Corp. and the National Interfaith Cable Coalition, 
a consortium of 70 religious denominations and faith groups that founded 
the channel in 1988. The Henson-Hallmark partners had been seeking 
a cable channel, and Odyssey's appeal lies in its 30 million subscribers 
and low-profile name. ``Since not a lot of people know about the channel, 
we can broaden awareness and make it mean more to a broader group 
of people,'' Ms. Loesch said. ``With these two bulletproof brand names, 
Henson and Hallmark, to brand the channel, you don't have to explain 
a lot.'' It will have 4,000 hours of programs from the Hallmark and 
Henson libraries, including Hallmark's television specials like ``Merlin,'' 
``Gulliver's Travels'' and, appropriately enough, ``The Odyssey.'' 
It will continue to carry religious and spiritual programs, including 
its documentary series ``Landmarks of Faith.'' The new partners agreed 
to keep a minimum of 40 hours of faith-and-values programming a week. 
``Our religious programming doesn't represent narrow doctrine or dogma,'' 
said Wilford V. Bane, chairman of the religious coalition's management 
group. ``It is not designed to proselytize or attract people to a 
specific point of view but help see their sense of values and religion 
and spiritual beliefs are part of their daily life.'' Its new look 
is to be ready next spring. Henson and Hallmark are investing $100 
million in the channel, and the channel itself expects to invest $200 
million over the next three to five years in new programs. Both Henson 
and Hallmark will continue to make programs for other television outlets 
around the world, executives of both companies said.
