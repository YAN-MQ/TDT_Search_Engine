Lufthansa doubled its pretax profits to 1.98 billion marks (dlrs 1.23 
billion) in the first nine months of 1998 despite fierce competition 
and price pressure, the German airline said Tuesday. The large profit 
was expected after the company recorded strong gains in earnings throughout 
1998, benefitting from cost-cutting measures and the building of a 
global system of alliances with partner airlines in recent years. 
Pretax profits in the first three quarters were up from 975 million 
marks (dlrs 609 million), Lufthansa said. The airline said it was 
sure it would exceed pretax profits of 2 billion marks (dlrs 1.25 
billion) for the whole year after raking in 1.6 billion marks (dlrs 
1 billion) in 1997. But company chairman Juergen Weber warned leaner 
times may be ahead. ``The weather radar is not showing the clear blue 
skies of 1997 and the prospect of staying that way well into the next 
millennium,'' he said at a news conference. Lufthansa said a ``substantial'' 
4.9 percent increase in sales to 16.4 billion marks (dlrs 10.25 billion) 
from 15.7 billion marks (dlrs 9.81 billion), coupled with moderate 
expenditure increases, boosted earnings during the nine months.
