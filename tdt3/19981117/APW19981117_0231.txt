BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors arrived in Iraq on Tuesday 
and said they want to get back to work as soon as possible to test 
Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of mass destruction. 
``We are back, we are ready to work immediately,'' senior weapons 
inspector Jaakko Ylitalo told reporters shortly after his C-130 transport 
plane landed at the Iraqi military air base at Habaniya outside Baghdad 
just a little after 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT). He declined to give details 
on his inspection work Tuesday. Ylitalo was among the 86 inspectors 
from UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency who flew in 
from the Gulf state of Bahrain. At the air base, Ylitalo asked an 
Iraqi official if the Iraqis had prepared for the resumption of their 
work. ``Everything will be sorted out as soon as possible,'' the unidentified 
official told Ylitalo. Asked by reporters if Iraqi officials were 
helpful, Ylitalo said: ``We have no problems.'' Three Iraqi buses 
transported the inspectors to their headquarters in Baghdad, 70 kilometers 
(44 miles) away. Earlier in Bahrain, the inspectors said they were 
going to test Iraq's promise to cooperate. ``The Iraqi authorities 
have promised cooperation. Obviously the next few days are going to 
be very important,'' said Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. 
Special Commission in charge of arms inspections. She spoke as the 
80 UNSCOM and six IAEA inspectors left their hotel in Bahrain, where 
they were evacuated last week, for the flight back to Baghdad. With 
the threat of American and British air strikes on Iraq over for now, 
about 150 U.N. relief workers also returned to Baghdad from the Jordanian 
capital of Amman, where they were sent at the height of the crisis. 
Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to Baghdad, 
said in an interview Monday that Iraq was being watched closely to 
measure its resolve in cooperating in the search for forbidden weapons. 
``Many members of the Security Council want the question of Iraq's 
cooperation with the inspectors to be tested and proved on the ground,'' 
Shah said. He added: ``If Iraq cooperates fully and unreservedly with 
the inspections due to begin in the next few days, the comprehensive 
review to be conducted by the council offers a hopeful sign for the 
future.'' Shah was leaving Tuesday for New York to brief Annan and 
council members on the situation. Ms. Cross said as she readied to 
leave Bahrain that the inspectors were anxious to get back on the 
job. ``We will be back straight to work today,'' she said. ``The first 
thing we will be doing is getting the office up and running, reassembling 
some of the equipment and computers that we dismantled or brought 
down. ``We will be out on inspections _ within a few hours maybe, 
later today or maybe tomorrow,'' she said. ``We will be out and about 
doing our work as soon as possible.'' Among the inspectors returning 
were 80 from UNSCOM, which is searching for Iraq's chemical and biological 
weapons and long-range missiles, and six from the separate U.N. agency 
examining the country's nuclear weapons programs. Of the about 150 
U.N. relief workers pulled out last week, the first 31 returned on 
a special U.N. flight from Jordan, where they were evacuated, to Habaniya 
military air base west of Baghdad. The other 120 traveled overnight 
on a bus convoy through the desert of Jordan and Iraq and arrived 
in Baghdad early Tuesday morning. The threat of military action was 
averted Sunday when U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that the 
United States had accepted the Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier 
to lift its three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections. Once inspectors 
report they are able to work effectively, the Security Council will 
conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to eliminate its dangerous weapons. 
The Iraqi government wants the review to lead quickly to the lifting 
of U.N. sanctions _ a move both the United States and Britain have 
resisted. The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, 
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated 
Iraq's economy. The council has said they will not be lifted until 
the U.N. Special Commission and the Vienna-headquartered International 
Atomic Energy Agency certify that Iraq has eliminated its lethal weaponry.
