An appeals court on Tuesday upheld a conviction of far-right leader 
Jean-Marie Le Pen but reduced the punishment, banning him from politics 
for one year instead of two for assaulting a Socialist politician. 
The court also upheld a three-month suspended sentence, and ordered 
Le Pen to pay a reduced fine of 5,000 francs (about dlrs 900). He 
had originally been fined 20,000 francs (dlrs 3,333). The ruling means 
Le Pen, 70, cannot hold office, run for office, or vote for a year. 
The conviction, unless successfully appealed, makes Le Pen ineligible 
to run in the June 1999 European Parliament elections. He has said 
that his wife, Jany, would run in his place _ a position that put 
him on a collision course with his party's No. 2 man, Bruno Megret. 
Le Pen wasn't present at Tuesday's court hearing. Samuel Marechal, 
a party official and Le Pen's son-in-law, called the ruling ``scandalous.'' 
``The system has invented a jurisprudence specifically for Jean-Marie 
Le Pen,'' he said. ``But nothing will prevent Jean-Marie Le Pen from 
standing in France's final battle, the presidential elections in 2002.'' 
The National Front has consistently won about 15 percent of the vote 
in national elections. It blames immigrants, particularly from North 
Africa, for high unemployment and urban violence. It has been widely 
accused of racism and anti-Semitism. Le Pen could lodge a final appeal 
with the Cour de Cassation, France's highest court, but has not decided 
whether to do so, said his lawyer, Jean-Francois Galvaire. Le Pen 
was convicted in April of assaulting Annette Peulvast-Bergeal, a Socialist 
opponent of his daughter in the race for parliament, at a 1997 election 
rally in the town of Mantes-La-Jolie, west of Paris. Television footage 
showed Le Pen shoving Ms. Peulvast-Bergeal in the chest during a scuffle 
with protesters. But Le Pen denies he attacked her. Peulvast-Bergeal 
said she was ``satisfied'' by Tuesday's ruling. ``Le Pen remains condemned 
and this condemnation brings him to a halt,'' she said. In an interview 
published Tuesday in the daily Le Parisien, Le Pen said his career 
would not be over if his conviction were upheld. ``Whatever happens, 
I am and will remain head of the National Front,'' Le Pen was quoted 
as saying. ``Is somebody seeking my political death?'' he asked. ``I 
have no regrets, except for having fallen into an ambush.'' Le Pen 
holds a seat in the European Parliament and is a regional counselor 
in the Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur region of southern France. Last 
month, the European Parliament voted to lift his parliamentary immunity 
so German prosecutors can investigate whether he broke laws that make 
trivializing the Holocaust a crime. The charges came from comments 
he has made several times, saying the Nazi gas chambers were a ``detail'' 
of history.
