In business news, short-term interest rates dropped again today for 
the third time in less than two months. The Federal Reserve reduced 
the benchmark rate 1/4 of a point from 5 to 4.75 percent. The central 
bank justified the move, saying that although conditions in financial 
markets have settled down, unusual strains remain. The interest you 
pay on your credit cards and auto loans is likely to fall in response 
to the Fed's action and Wall Street was pleased as punch, although 
stocks sputtered after an early rally today. The Dow Jones Industrials 
closed down 26 points, ending the day at 8985. The Nasdaq on the other 
hand, closed off 17 points to reach 1879.
