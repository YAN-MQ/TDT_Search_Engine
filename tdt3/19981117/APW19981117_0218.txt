Romania's longest-surviving official of the post-communist years is 
likely to keep his job for another six years as head of the central 
bank, media reports said Tuesday. Political leaders from the fractured 
ruling coalition said late Monday they considered Mugur Isarescu, 
49, the only person suited to head the central bank. Isarescu was 
appointed governor of the national bank in 1990, just after communism 
ended. Known for his tight monetary policy, he has survived five governments 
whose members' economic policies ranged from leftist to liberal. Isarescu 
needs parliament's approval in a vote next week.
