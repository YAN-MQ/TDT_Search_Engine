Peter Cotes, a British theatrical producer and director who staged 
the first production of Agatha Christie's ``Mousetrap'' in 1952, died 
Tuesday at his home in Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds. He was 86. 
``The Mousetrap,'' now in its 46th consecutive year in London, is 
the longest-running show of all time. It made Christie a rich woman 
and Cotes a rich man, although his name was often overlooked when 
credits for the play, a murder mystery, were mentioned. Wisely, Cotes 
demanded a royalty of 1.5 percent rather than a flat fee for his work 
as director. The Christie play was unquestionably his most successful 
effort, but it was only one stop in a significant career that often 
defied censorship. In 1946, he presented ``Pick-Up Girl,'' an American 
play dealing with venereal disease, at a small, private London theater 
club. Because of its subject matter, the play had not been licensed 
for commercial production. Queen Mary, the Queen Mother, came to see 
it, and after the performance asked Cotes where he found ``those wonderful 
actors.'' Helped by that royal recommendation, the play was licensed 
and moved to the West End. Cotes was born in Maidenhead as Sydney 
Arthur Rembrandt Boulting. His younger brothers, John and Roy, became 
the Boulting Brothers of English films. He took the name Cotes from 
a childhood home called Northcotes and used it as a pseudonym to show 
independence from his brothers. He began his career as an actor, working 
in films as well as onstage. After World War II, he was active as 
a producer and director, often working with his second wife, the actress 
Joan Miller (who died in 1988). In 1948, he founded a theater company, 
the Peter Cotes Players, in Manchester. His commitment to outspoken 
drama and his antipathy for the star system were integral to his book 
``No Star Nonsense.'' He also collaborated on ``The Little Fellow,'' 
a biography of Charlie Chaplin. In addition, he wrote books about 
crime and was a television producer and director. In the early 1950s, 
he staged private productions in London of ``The Children's Hour'' 
and ``A Pin to See the Peepshow'' (about an English murder case), 
avoiding censorship by the Lord Chamberlain by presenting the plays 
privately in a theater club. In 1953 he brought ``A Pin to See the 
Peepshow'' to Broadway, with his wife in the leading role. The show 
closed after one performance, in direct contrast to ``The Mousetrap.''
