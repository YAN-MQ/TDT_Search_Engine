An austerity plan meant to stabilize South America's largest economy 
could be undermined by corruption allegations involving two top government 
officials, analysts said Tuesday. Brazil secured a dlrs 41.5 million 
rescue package from the International Monetary Fund, by promising 
austerity measures and a reduction in its dlrs 65 billion budget deficit. 
The package was announced Friday. Yet analysts fear a scandal involving 
alleged attempts to influence the phone company's privatization may 
stall key congressional action needed to pass the austerity measures. 
The allegations involve Communications Minister Luiz Carlos Mendonca 
de Barros and Andre Lara Resende, president of Brazil's national development 
Bank. Conversations, secretly recorded on the eve of last July's dlrs 
19 billion privatization auction of the state-run telephone holding 
company, Telebras, allegedly show Barros and Resende favoring a consortium 
of personal friends in its bid to purchase part of Telebras' operations. 
The two officials coordinated the sale. Since news of the tapes surfaced 
in the Nov. 9 issue of the magazine, Epoca, the brewing scandal has 
been the top news story in Brazilian media. Another newsmagaizne, 
Veja, published excerpts in this week's issue. It is unclear where 
the tapes came from or who made them. Both Barros and Resende have 
denied any wrongdoing _ and the consortium they allegedly favored 
lost the auction. That hasn't stopped opposition politicians from 
calling for a full congressional investigation, which analysts say 
could weaken the resolve of legislators facing the tough budget cuts 
needed to save the ailing economy. ``The government's worst nightmare 
at the moment is a congressional probe into the tapes,'' said Alexandre 
Barros, a Brasilia-based political and business consultant. ``It will 
draw attention away from the austerity measures and possibly weaken 
them.'' In late October, the government unveiled a mix of taxes and 
spending cuts in a bid to save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and 
some dlrs 80 billion by 2002. The measures must be approved by Congress. 
The measures, designed to reduce Brazil's budget deficit of 7 percent 
of gross domestic product, are likely to aggravate the economic slowdown 
and push unemployment past nearly 8 percent, analysts said. Independent 
economists put unemployment at nearly 20 percent. Some politicians, 
Barros said, will agree with the creation of an inquiry committee 
``so they can later indulge in some horse trading with the government.'' 
``They'll negotiate withdrawal of their support in exchange for approval 
of projects that can dilute the fiscal austerity package,'' he added. 
Political consultant Jose Luciano Dias said an investigation will 
give Congress a stronger hand when it votes on austerity measures 
proposed by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. ``The President will 
become more dependent on the good will of Congress,'' he said. Aware 
of the danger, the government is rallying allies to delay a possible 
investigation _ at least until after Congress approves the belt-tightening 
measures. To complicate government determination further, police are 
also looking into allegations that Cardoso and three close allies 
stashed away dlrs 368 million in a Cayman Islands corporate account. 
Unlike the wiretapping, though, the impact of these allegations is 
quickly fizzling out, said political consultant Jose Luciano Dias. 
``The documents are so grotesquely false that no one is giving them 
any credence at all,'' he said. Other analysts, though are waiting 
to see what details on the wiretaps emerge before deciding what the 
impact will be on the package. Silvio Camargo, head of international 
institutional equity sales at Banco Fator, a Brazilian investment 
bank, said that so far ``the tapes offer no conclusive evidence of 
wrongdoing.'' ``If solid evidence of irregularities emerges, then 
the momentum for a congressional probe will grow, jeopardizing the 
austerity measures,'' he said.
