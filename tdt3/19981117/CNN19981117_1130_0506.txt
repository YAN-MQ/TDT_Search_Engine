One of five Wisconsin high schoolers charged in a plot to kill classmates 
says it was all just a big joke. But as Patty Davis reports, police 
and parents aren't laughing. They came to vent their anger and their 
fears. I'm a new parent in this community and I don't think it's right 
to come into this community, have my child come into this school, 
and she's running scared already. I don't feel safe coming into this 
school. My exchange student is just -- she's absolutely terrified. 
Police and school officials in Burlington, Wisconsin, faced hundreds 
of concerned students and parents at a community meeting. They were 
stunned by the news that five teenaged boys had allegedly plotted 
to attack Burlington high school on Monday and kill 15 to 20 students. 
The intention was to shoot these students and there was talk that 
some of those involved would flee while others would stand their ground 
while the police came and have a shootout. Police say the teenagers 
had planned to take the schools principal and other staff members 
hostage. A weekend tip led police to the boys. The motive they say, 
revenge for being taunted by fellow students. This was very real, 
this was going to happen, action had to be taken. Three of the boys 
were arraigned Monday in juvenile count on charges of conspiracy to 
commit homicide. The other two were released but still may face charges. 
From behind his apartment door, one of the boys told CNN affiliate 
wisn there was no murder plot. This was like a little joke and people 
are taking it way too seriously. I can understand because of what 
happened at the other schools. Burlington's mayor calls the arrests 
a wake up call for the city. It's something that a lot of people thought 
would never happen here in a City of 10,000, but as I said, I felt 
that our community and other communities are never isolated. Not isolated 
from what police say could have been another violent episode in our 
nation's schools. Patty Davis, CNN, Burlington, Wisconsin.
