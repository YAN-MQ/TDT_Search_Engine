Still "on the money" inflation remains under control. The consumer 
price index was up just 0.2% last month. Energy prices are down nearly 
9% this year. In fact, the average price, across the country, of regular 
unleaded gas is 99 cents. The energy department says oil prices will 
stay low well into the next decade. The oil-producing nations continue 
to pump so much. And they are not using as much in Asia because of 
economic bad times, so there is a lot of oil to be had more cheaply.
