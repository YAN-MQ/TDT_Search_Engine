Thanks, Angela. As anticipated, federal reserve policymakers cut interest 
rates today in a Bid to stabilize the still fragile world markets. 
The fed cut the benchmark federal funds rate, the interest banks charge 
each other on overnight loans, one-quarter point to 4.75%, and cut 
the less frequently used discount rate one-quarter point to 5%. -- 
To 4.5%. that's what the fed charges on its own loans to banks. Major 
U.S. banks like BankAmerica and chase Manhattan quickly cut the prime 
interest rates one-quarter point in response to the central bank move. 
Mortgages, credit cards and consumer loans are pegged to bank prime 
rates.
