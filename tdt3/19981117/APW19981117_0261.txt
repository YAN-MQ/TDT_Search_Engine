Former Khmer Rouge rebels expressed doubt Tuesday about reports of 
the death of Khieu Samphan, a longtime top leader of the guerrilla 
group. Thai military sources along the border and the Cambodian Defense 
Ministry also said they could not confirm a report from the Japanese 
news agency Kyodo that the veteran guerrilla had died in the jungles 
along the Thai-Cambodian border. Kyodo quoted ``a well-informed source'' 
in the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet as saying an aide to Khmer 
Rouge military chief Ta Mok had disclosed the death last week. However, 
former rebel military commander Sok Pheap, speaking by telephone from 
Poipet, opposite the border from Aranyaprathet, said he had not heard 
that Khieu Samphan was dead. ``He may be politically dead, but he 
is still physically alive,'' Sok Pheap told The Associated Press. 
Sok Pheap was a key figure in a massive 1996 defection of rebel fighters 
led by former Khmer Rouge deputy prime minister Ieng Sary, a move 
that crippled the Maoist movement. Yim Phanna, a Khmer Rouge commander 
whose defection earlier this year led to the government's capture 
of the rebels' stronghold in Anlong Veng, also said Tuesday that he 
did not believe Khieu Samphan was dead. ``I don't think that it is 
true yet,'' said Yim Phanna, adding that his troops in Anlong Veng 
have been instructed to gather information on the whereabouts of the 
dwindling band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas still loyal to Ta Mok. Khieu 
Samphan, 67, has been the nominal head of the Khmer Rouge for much 
of the past two decades. The group's supreme leader, Pol Pot, died 
of an apparent heart attack in April as the guerrillas were being 
driven out of their last major stronghold. Some reports have suggested 
that Khieu Samphan is being held against his will by Ta Mok, commander 
of the remaining Khmer Rouge forces. A team of U.N. legal experts 
is now in Cambodia to assess evidence that could be used to prosecute 
leaders of the Khmer Rouge, which has been blamed for the deaths of 
as many as 2 million Cambodians when it ruled the country between 
1975 and 1979.
