The music of Chopin seems to trigger in Mitsuko Uchida's playing something 
close to raw emotion. So refined in Mozart, so subtly introspective 
in Schubert, this estimable Japanese pianist plunged headlong into 
two nocturnes, the 24 Preludes and the A-Flat ``Polonaise-Fantaisie'' 
on Monday night. The refinement and thoughtfulness were there for 
Chopin's more leisurely moods, but the big statement, often in the 
form of an up-tempo challenge, was met with impetuosity bordering 
on the heedless. Even the B-flat minor Prelude, one of pianism's most 
daunting races, set new standards for reckless driving. This Carnegie 
Hall recital began with Bach's G-minor ``English Suite,'' an appropriate 
gesture given Chopin's status as Bach's biggest fan. The nocturnes 
in B Major and E Major and the ``Polonaise-Fantaisie'' sought out 
Chopin in his blackest moods. The first two couch lovely melodies 
in some of the most arcane and original harmonies ever written. The 
last is a long and bitter struggle, a black hole of a piece that emits 
its moments of light only rarely. The Bach is scarcely less difficult, 
made more so by playing it on a modern piano. The baritonal texture, 
clearer on earlier instruments, clots on ones of newer invention. 
Indeed, the Prelude sounded like early Brahms; the Musette almost 
lolled. Ms. Uchida's stony insistence on the Sarabande's considerable 
dissonance entered the 20th century. This is Bach reinvented, Bach 
translated into a more contemporary language. And why not? Bach, like 
Shakespeare, lends itself to successive reinventions, which is why 
both survive so hardily. In the Preludes, Chopin pays tribute to Bach's 
``Well-Tempered Klavier.'' There are no fugues, but the format of 
major and relative-minor keys progressing around the circle of fifths 
remain his guide. The D-Major and B-Major items hurtled into unintelligibility, 
but so genuine is Ms. Uchida's enthusiasm that it was hard to complain. 
She has that unusual gift of making a large hall seem small. Touch, 
color and a sense of scale help, but mostly it is personality. Who 
else would play Schoenberg as an encore?
