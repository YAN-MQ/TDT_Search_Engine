Another major report today about smoking and young people. Smoking 
on college campuses is up 28% from five years ago. One in every four 
college students now smokes. It was only yesterday that eight of the 
states and the tobacco companies made a deal which would allow the 
companies go on advertising cigarettes pretty widely. Here's ABC's 
Barry Serafin. Until now, college students were considered less likely 
to smoke than others of their age group. In general, more education 
has meant less smoking. But the new survey indicates that college 
students are just as susceptible as other groups. The pressure starts 
before they get to campus. We might say E kids that grew up with Joe 
camel are now in college with camels, marlboros and newports. I was 
14, and all my friends smoke. Now it's just habit. And the same pressures 
increase when they get to the campus. More than one-fourth of student 
smokers do not start smoking regularly until they get to college. 
One reason -- tobacco companies increasingly promote cigarettes at 
bars, music and social events frequented by students. They target 
our generation. They target ads that are geared toward college students. 
Researchers found more smoking at all types of colleges and among 
all student groups, regardless of age, sex or race. It's there. It's 
strong. It's across the board. And something needs to be done about 
it. Wechsler and others are calling for more restrictions such as 
smoke-free dorms, more anti-smoking education and more campus health 
programs to help students stop smoking. Barry Serafin, ABC News, Washington.
