CNN legal analyst Greta Van sus sten says the tape release wad planned. 
I think it's the political effect. Actually hearing the voice of Monica 
Lewinsky and Linda Tripp on the tape. I think that's the bigger part. 
The timing is everything in legal business. And it's true in political 
forum as well. The timing is so terrible. If this were a month ago, 
we would have forgotten about it. But we're two days away from the 
hearings, so we're all going to remember it.
