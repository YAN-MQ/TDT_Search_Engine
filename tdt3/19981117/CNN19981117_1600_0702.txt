Keeping track of what you've paid in to social security will become 
much easier for working Americans, thanks to new annual statements 
from the government. The notices have already gone out to 50 million 
people over the age of 47. Starting next fall, every U.S. worker over 
the age of 25 will get an updated notice each year. They're designed 
to help Americans plan for retirement.
