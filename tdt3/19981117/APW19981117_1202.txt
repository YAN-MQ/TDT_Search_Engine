Two days of back-and-forth threats and sharp rhetoric came to a close 
Tuesday after Israel welcomed a verbal commitment by Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat to disavow violence and forge ahead through peaceful 
means. The crisis over inflammatory remarks made by Arafat over the 
week-end was the latest in a series of flare-ups to plague the U.S.-brokered 
land-for-peace accord signed last month in Washington. Several hurdles 
still remained however before Israel would start carrying out a troop 
withdrawal from 13 percent of West Bank territory. One day after the 
pullback was to begin, Israeli legislators were still debating the 
Mideast accord. Lawmakers were getting their first look at withdrawal 
maps and were to vote late Tuesday on the deal. Coming out of a map 
room in the Knesset, right-wing lawmakers said they were shocked to 
see how isolated some Jewish settlements would become after the first 
pullout from 2 percent of the area. Others complained that the government 
was hiding the truth from them by only posting a map for the first 
phase of withdrawal. ``This is a fraud,'' charged Michael Kleiner, 
a right-wing legislator in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition. 
The public and the press were not allowed to view the maps. After 
seeing the maps, Naomi Bloomenthal, a staunch member of Netanyahu's 
Likud party sat with a group of fellow lawmakers and looked close 
to tears. She told Israel TV it was one of the hardest days of her 
life. She did not say how she would vote over the accord. Kleiner 
said two small Jewish settlements near the Palestinian city of Jenin 
in the northern West Bank would become surrounded by Palestinian-controlled 
areas when the first pullout phase takes place. He said it would take 
Jewish children up to two hours to reach schools in other communities 
because Palestinians control would slice through Israel's current 
contiguous hold over that area. And Ephraim Sneh, a former general 
and member of the dovish Labor party said after viewing the maps that 
he would abstain. Sneh said territory had been carved up in a way 
which would complicate future negotiations. Addressing the Knesset, 
Netanyahu said maps would be shown to the parliament before each pullback. 
He called on ministers to support the peace accord. ``I hope that 
what comes out today is a wide agreement on the Wye accord and the 
desire to see it carried out. I think this is the only way to achieve 
peace,'' Netanyahu said. Monday, Netanyahu, 8th graf pvs
