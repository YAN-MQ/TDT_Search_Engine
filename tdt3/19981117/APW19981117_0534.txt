For the first time in 400 years, Sweden's Roman Catholics will have 
a bishop who's a Swede. The Vatican on Tuesday named the Rev. Anders 
Arborelius as bishop of the Stockholm diocese, which covers all of 
Sweden. Arborelius was born in Switzerland of Swedish parents and 
grew up in the Swedish city of Lund. He replaces Bishop Hubertus Brandenburg, 
a German, who on Tuesday turned 75, the usual retirement age for bishops. 
Arborelius will become the first Swede to head the church in this 
country since the Protestant Reformation swept the country in the 
1500s. The Reformation changed Sweden from an almost entirely Catholic 
country into one where Catholics were banned. Until 1860, no native 
Swedes were allowed to be Catholics and today the church claims only 
about 2 percent of the population _ about 165,000 people _ and most 
of its priests are foreign-born, according to the Stockholm diocese.
