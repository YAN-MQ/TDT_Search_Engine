Declaring that it would hold the United States responsible for outbreaks 
of ``lawlessness,'' Malaysia Tuesday excoriated Vice President Al 
Gore for a speech here in which he praised simmering protests against 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. In a statement, Malaysia's foreign 
minister said that Gore's remarks on Monday were a ``gross interference 
in the internal affairs of the country and a brazen violation of the 
basic tenets of relations between sovereign states.'' ``Malaysians 
hold dearly the harmony and stability which they have painstakingly 
built up through the years,'' said the foreign minister, Abdullah 
Ahmad Badawi. ``Malaysians would hold the United States accountable 
for any rupture of harmony arising from this irresponsible incitement.'' 
In his speech at a regional summit meeting of Pacific Rim countries, 
Gore accused Malaysia of suppressing freedom. As Mahathir and other 
Malaysian officials seethed in the audience, Gore saluted anti-government 
protesters as brave people. He even invoked the rallying cry ``reformasi,'' 
which was coined during Indonesia's student movement and is now chanted 
here to protest the jailing of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, 
Anwar Ibrahim who is being tried on sex-related and corruption charges. 
He was ousted in September after a power struggle with Mahathir. Gore's 
blunt words, and Malaysia's enraged reaction, have left this meeting 
of Pacific Rim nations in a shambles. At the gathering, called the 
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, discussions of how to lower 
trade barriers or rein in global capital flows were scarcely heard 
Tuesday. Instead, there were sharp divisions over whether the vice 
president had taken a principled stand in defense of human rights 
or hijacked a meeting intended to be devoted to the Asian financial 
crisis. New Zealand's prime minister, Jenny Shipley, accused Gore 
of practicing ``megaphone diplomacy,'' while officials from Singapore 
and China offered more subtle criticism of the speech _ reaffirming 
that they would stick to economic matters and not wade into the affairs 
of other countries. However, the President of the Philippines, Joseph 
Estrada, said in an interview, ``I feel the same way as the Vice President.'' 
``I don't interfere in Malaysia's domestic problems, but I've said 
human rights and due process of law transcend all boundaries,'' said 
Estrada, who earlier threatened to boycott the meeting to protest 
Anwar's treatment. Early Tuesday morning, Estrada met with Anwar's 
wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, defying a stern warning by Mahathir that 
visiting dignitaries should not use the summit meeting to get involved 
in the Anwar dispute. ``I told her that it was a great sacrifice on 
the part of Anwar for the future of freedom,'' Estrada said of the 
meeting. ``I really can't tell you if he will receive a fair trial. 
Hopefully because of the media, it will help.'' If Gore's speech was 
meant to be a call to arms, however, it had a muffled echo on the 
streets of Kuala Lumpur. About 500 people gathered in a neighborhood 
near Gore's hotel this evening to chant and wave placards calling 
for Mahathir to step down. But they did not carry through on a threat 
to march to the luxury hotel where the Vice President was staying. 
Protesters have assembled in front of a mosque here nearly every weekend 
since Anwar was arrested. And while this was the first rally held 
during the week, it lacked the size or intensity of previous protests. 
People here said the demonstrators may have been discouraged by a 
phalanx of riot policemen who stood three deep across the road, wielding 
bamboo batons and glaring from behind plastic shields. Two red trucks 
with high-pressure water cannon stood as a silent warning in front 
of the police barrier. Some protesters said they were heartened by 
Gore's remarks. ``It helped our emotions,'' said a middle-aged woman 
who would give only her first name, Marina. ``It helped inspire people.'' 
She said that when she and her friends saw a tape of the Gore speech 
on CNN, they broke into cries of ``reformasi.'' But even some political 
analysts who support Anwar said they were troubled by the stridency 
of the speech. They said Gore might have played into the hands of 
Mahathir, who has used anti-Western jeremiads for years as a means 
to galvanize his mostly rural supporters. ``This speech may have given 
ammunition to Mahathir to discredit the reform movement, in the sense 
that he can now say it is sponsored by the U.S.,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, 
a professor of political science at the University of Malaya. Mahathir 
did not respond to Gore's remarks _ ignoring shouted questions as 
he and leaders of 20 other nations posed for photos before meeting 
in a Moorish-style hotel on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. Advisers 
to Gore contended that the vice president's speech was no different 
from President Clinton's performance in Beijing last July, when he 
pointedly challenged the Chinese government's human rights record 
in a televised news conference with President Jiang Zemin. And despite 
the furor over his words, Gore did not retreat Tuesday. ``My point 
is very simple,'' he said. ``These economies have some very difficult 
choices to make. Democracy and freedom are essential prerequisites 
for making those choices.''
