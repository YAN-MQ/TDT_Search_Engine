"A bug's life" may seem pretty simple, but taking it to the big screen 
is another story. Dennis Michael talks to the cast and crew of Disney's 
new computer-animated film. I'm lost! They call it an epic of miniature 
proportions. For pixar, the creators of "toy story," "A bug's life" 
is a whole new world. A simple rule of thumb is that the more geometric 
something is, the easier it is to produce with a computer. The more 
-- the more organic something is, the more difficult it is to produce 
with a computer. And so hence, like "toy story" was the perfect subject 
matter for our first film. Man-made world, man-made environment, flat 
floors. "Bug's life" -- there is nothing geometric about this movie. 
Hey, who ordered the poopoo platter? "A bug's life" is far more advanced 
technologically than "toy story." It's animated in a widescreen format, 
but to pixar, the technology is only a means to an end. The big myth 
is that we're out to make the best computer-animated movie in the 
world. And it's like, "no, we're out to make the best movie we can 
make." You always cast me as the broom. The pole. A stick. A splinter. 
Casting was one of the keys to "A bug's life." David Hyde Pierce provided 
the voice of Slim, a walking stick. Well, it's very humbling, I'll 
tell you. Because as you're sitting there watching and the character 
does some wonderful thing, and you think, "oh, that was good." But 
it wasn't me. It was them. They did that. And, you know, it is definitely 
being a piece of a huge puzzle. Dave Foley, who plays the film's hero, 
flik, feels that his personality did transfer to his six-legged alter 
ego. He looks a little like me. He's got my eyes, you know, my great 
big bulbous eyes. And, you know, and he has -- he has my stammer, 
you know? And that affects your facial features, when you stammer. 
And Phyllis diller is unmistakably the queen of the ant colony. That's 
our lot in life. It's not a lot, but it's our life. It's a certain 
kind of immortality, because those Disney films do go on and on and 
on. And so does pixar's partnership with Disney. Lasseter and company 
are returning to the playroom for a "toy story 2" and they have bigger 
plans beyond that. We can't talk about anything after "toy story 2." 
But it's bound to be big, no matter how small the setting. Dennis 
Michael, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
