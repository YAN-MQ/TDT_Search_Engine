A group of about 1000 tourists leaves South Korea today for a five-day 
trip to North Korea. It's the first such visit since the end of the 
Korean War 45 years ago. The tour has been organized by the South 
Korean company Hyundai which hopes the initiative will help to improve 
relations between the two countries.
