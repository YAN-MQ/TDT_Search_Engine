We have not heard of any real damage being done by the storm. As Ned 
said, some precautions were taken. The Hubble space telescope was 
turned so its mirrors facedded away from the incoming meteors. And 
as more satellites go into orbit NASA is trying to do more to protect 
them. ABC' Tom foreman reports from Denver. Ten, nine, eight -- Out 
on the windswept Colorado plains, scientists working for NASA are 
recreating a dramatic moment in space. Push the start button. In space, 
that instant when a meteoroid collides with a Satellite. Excellent! 
Excellent! Joel williamsen is determining if lightweight aluminum 
foam can be used to shield a satellite from such impacts. And his 
results are striking. Look at what happens when he fires a small aluminum 
pellet through standard satellite shielding made of plate aluminum. 
The bullet rips right through. And you can see we've got a lot of 
damage to the rear wall, from pieces of debris that have come off 
of this shield. But high-speed photos tell a very different story 
when the same kind of pellet hits less than an inch of aluminum foam. 
Even though the pellet is traveling 20 times the speed of sound, it 
rips, tears, and essentially disintegrates. It breaks that particle 
up quite a bit better and you can see it just places a fine field 
of aluminum spray over the front of the target space. What's more, 
the aluminum foam weighs 20% less than standard shielding and can 
double as a type of space radiator for excess heat on board a satellite. 
All that makes engineers hopeful they can reduce the danger to satellites 
by the next time the leonids shower comes around. Tom foreman, ABC 
News, Denver.
