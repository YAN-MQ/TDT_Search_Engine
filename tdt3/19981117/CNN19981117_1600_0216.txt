The wye peace agreement appears to be back on track. Israeli prime 
minister Benjamin Netanyahu is praising Palestinian authority President 
Yasser Arafat's decision to back away from a threat to declare statehood 
in may. Netanhayu yesterday suspended the planned troop withdrawal 
from the West Bank if Arafat did not retract the statement. The Palestinian 
leader says his decision was based on a commitment to achieve peace 
in the Middle East. I reiterate before you that peace is our strategic 
choice and I also reiterate any problems concerning final status negotiations 
will be resolved through amicable and peaceful ways and through negotiations, 
but not through any other means. I certainly view in a positive lot 
the statements made by chairman Arafat. I think that his statements 
that the Palestinian authority's committed to negotiating the permanent 
peace agreement with Israelis through peaceful means and through them 
alone, that rejection of violence as a means of negotiation, and the 
commitment to cooperate against violence and terror, I think these 
are positive steps and we view them accordingly. Netanyahu says the 
Israeli cabinet will decide tomorrow whether to go ahead with the 
troop withdrawal.
