No accident that today's tape release comes just two days before impeachment 
hearings are set to begin on the hill, amid reports that the investigation 
could be headed in a new direction. That angle from David Bloom at 
the White House White House. Brian, tonight democrats are threatening 
to boycott Thursday's impeachment hearings as republicans move to 
broaden the inquiry far beyond the Monica lewinsky case. Today, new 
evidence from independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, four boxes delivered 
to Congress, focusing on allegations that the White House tried to 
buy the silence of former justice department official Webster Hubbell. 
And tonight new signs that republicans are pointing their impeachment 
investigation in the same direction. Late today, republicans on the 
house Judiciary committee met, in part to consider whether to seek 
the testimony of John huang, a former democratic fundraiser. Democrats 
say they're outraged that Starr's upcoming testimony may go far beyond 
the Lewinsky investigation. If this thing keeps going the way it's 
been going, democrats may decide not to come to the hearing. And the 
White House seized on huang's testimony as proof that this whole thing 
is turning into a fishing expedition. That will reinforce the American 
public's view that this process is not fair. The two sides can't even 
agree on how much time the president's lawyers should get to cross-examine 
Starr. Clinton's team wants 90 minutes. But tonight Henry Hyde said 
that 30 minutes is more than generous. David Bloom, NBC news, the 
White House White House.
