A leading Israeli philanthropist told U.S. Jews to reverse the traditional 
trend of sending the bulk of fundraising money to Israel and instead 
spend it on their own communities. Dov Lautman, who heads the Israeli 
branch of the United Jewish Appeal, the largest fundraising arm of 
American Jewry, said American Jews must realize that Israel is no 
longer a poor country in need of the intensive support it once received 
from Jews abroad. ``We need to stop thinking of American Jews as those 
who give. The vast majority of resources and the money that are raised 
there should be used to strengthen the young generation there,'' Lautman 
told the Haaretz daily. The UJA raises about dlrs 1.2 billion a year, 
about half of which it sends to Israel. Lautman is presiding over 
the General Assembly, an annual conference of North American Jewish 
Federation leaders. Attended by some 3,000 North American Jews and 
1,500 Israelis, the General Assembly is being held in Israel for the 
first time as part of the country's 50th anniversary celebrations
