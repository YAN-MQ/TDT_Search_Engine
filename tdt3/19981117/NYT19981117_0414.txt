Robert Isaacson, a former art dealer in Manhattan who helped revive 
interest in 19th-century academic French and English painters, died 
on Nov. 5 at his home in Manhattan. He was 71. The cause was lung 
cancer, said his companion, James Draper. Two years after opening 
the Robert Isaacson Gallery in 1960, Isaacson mounted an exhibition 
of work by the once-popular English painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, 
who specialized in renderings of ancient Roman life. It was the first 
important exhibition dedicated to the artist since his death in 1912. 
For the Vassar College Art Gallery in 1967, Isaacson arranged the 
first exhibition in the United States devoted to the French painter 
of antiquarian scenes Jean-Leon Gerome (1824-1904). At the New York 
Cultural Center in 1974, he organized the first American museum show 
of work by the French painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905), 
who was noted for his ultra-realistic approach to mythological, historical, 
genre and religious subjects. The shows were harbingers of reemerging 
interest in these and other academic artists; nowadays their work 
is owned and exhibited by major museums. Isaacson was born on Sept. 
1, 1927, in St. Louis. He never finished high school, instead moving 
to New York at age 16 to study the harpsichord. Later, with backing 
from his mother, he opened his gallery, where, besides the earlier 
artists, he showed contemporary realist painters like George Tooker. 
Isaacson retired from art dealing in 1970. He wrote occasional scholarly 
articles and made significant gifts to the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art and other institutions for purchases in the decorative arts.
