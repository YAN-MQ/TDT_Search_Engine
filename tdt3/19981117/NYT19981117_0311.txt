As U.N. weapons inspectors prepared Tuesday to resume their work in 
Iraq, they were greeted with fresh denunciations in the official Iraqi 
press despite Iraq's new pledge to demonstrate full cooperation. It 
may have been intended primarily for domestic consumption, but it 
also showed that Iraq is hardly ready to roll out a welcome mat. More 
than 80 of the inspectors returned to Baghdad Tuesday morning after 
they pulled out last week in anticipation of an attack, and they expressed 
the hope that Iraq would indeed make good on its promise to allow 
them to conduct unfettered work. The last time Iraq permitted U.N. 
inspectors to conduct anything more than monitoring operations was 
in early August. But for now, the clearest clue about the Iraqi attitude 
may have been the newspaper headline that taunted the head of the 
inspection commission, Richard Butler, as a ``Mad Dog.'' As the inspectors 
arrived on a U.N. C-130 plane on a flight from Bahrain to an air base 
outside the Iraqi capital, a U.N. spokeswoman, Caroline Cross, offered 
a forecast that was carefully guarded. ``We're looking forward to 
a professional and productive relationship with the Iraqi authorities 
over the next few days,'' Ms. Cross said, ``and, you know, time will 
tell.'' The inspectors were not scheduled to resume work until Wednesday 
morning, and even then, U.N. officials say, it will almost certainly 
be at least several days before they undertake the kinds of intrusive 
inspections that have aroused Iraq's ire in the past, and which the 
Iraqi government banned on Aug. 5. Ms. Cross said the inspectors hoped 
to return to the field ``as soon as possible.'' But she said that 
more pressing priorities for inspectors would be to test communication 
equipment and otherwise re-establish the infrastructure they abandoned 
when Iraq decided on Oct. 31 to cut off cooperation altogether. Most 
Arab governments have done little more than express relief since Clinton 
decided over the weekend to call off an attack and accept Iraq's promise 
to resume cooperation with the inspectors. Some Arab commentators 
have remained sharply critical of Iraq for taking the confrontational 
stand that provoked the latest crisis, a stance that left Baghdad 
without tangible support from any of its neighbors. ``Saddam erred 
in the timing of his decision to halt cooperation with the international 
inspectors for good, and so had to back down,'' Abdelazim Hammad, 
an Egyptian columnist, wrote on Monday in the semiofficial daily Al 
Ahram. ``One hopes this climbdown will be the start of the Iraqi regime's 
reaching the age of maturity, and learning when to advance and when 
to retreat.'' On the other hand, other leading Arab voices have warned 
that the tough American response to Iraq and the renewed threats of 
military attack could ultimately rebound against the United States. 
``What Washington may consider to be a humiliation of the Iraqi leadership 
will be sold in Baghdad as a victory, on the argument that the rug 
has been pulled from beneath the feet of the Americans who are forever 
seeking an opportunity to wage aggression against Iraq,'' Salameh 
Ne'mat wrote in the Saudi-owned Al Hayat.
