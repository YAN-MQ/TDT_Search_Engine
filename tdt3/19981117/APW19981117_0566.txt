Germany's top athletics doctor suspects some German athletes of taking 
undetectable performance-enhancing drugs. Dr. Karlheinz Graff, chief 
doctor for the national athletics team, has told the German Athletics 
Federation (DLV) that two athletes have asked him for plasma, which 
can be used to fight blood thickening that can be a result of EPO 
use. EPO is a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of 
oxygen-carrying red blood cells and cannot be detected by existing 
doping tests. The substance gained notoriety during the scandal that 
marred this year Tour de France cycling race. According to DLV, Graff 
has ``strong suspicion that at least one DLV athlete has been using 
blood doping or doping through EPO for a long time.'' Graff declined 
to name any athletes. The DLV welcomed Graff's disclosure on Tuesday 
and asked him for a written statement so that its anti-doping panel 
can prepare any possible action. ``The DLV hopes to make further progress 
in fighting the abuse of EPO by taking joint action with physicians 
and lawyers,'' DLV president Helmut Digel said.
