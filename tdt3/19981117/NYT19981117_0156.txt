Like a puff of smoke, Pearson's Texas Barbecue, the only authentic 
barbecue pit in this city, will fade and vanish by the end of the 
year. The smoke, in fact, is part of the problem. Pearson's, situated 
for almost seven years in the shadow of a huge Con Edison smokestack 
(paradoxically perhaps) in Long Island City, Queens, is being evicted. 
Its building, at 5-16 51st Ave., was sold earlier this year, and the 
new landlord, D&AMP;E Electrical Contractors, which is housed next 
door to the restaurant, was not able to work out a lease agreement 
with Pearson's. Ellen Goldberg, the owner of Pearson's, said she might 
have been able to extend the existing lease with a court fight but 
conceded that the restaurant also had a continual problem with smoke, 
an inescapable byproduct of authentic pit-cooked barbecue. The city's 
Department of Environmental Protection received numerous complaints 
over the years about the smoke and aromas from Pearson's, Ms. Goldberg 
said. ``Finally, they said you had to comply by a certain date, or 
you have to get out,'' she said. Over the years, Pearson's had paid 
fines, she said, but was unable to solve the smoke problem. With just 
20 seats, plus a small picnic area, Pearson's was too small to invest 
in an elaborate exhaust system, which Ms. Goldberg said would have 
cost a minimum of $30,000 and would have had high maintenance costs. 
Eric Olynik, the owner of D&AMP;E, knows all about the smoke. ``It's 
like a wood-burning monster back there,'' he said. ``The smoke would 
come into our building, especially at night. We had to cover all the 
windows and doors in plastic and duct tape, and workers still complained.'' 
Nonetheless, Olynik said, ``I love the food _ it's unbelievable.'' 
Ms. Goldberg said she hoped Pearson's would be able to reopen in Manhattan 
next year. She is currently scouting sites in Greenwich Village that 
would be big enough to justify investing in expensive exhaust equipment. 
``We're not even considering NOT doing that in Manhattan,'' she said. 
Several years ago, when Pearson's was known as Stick to Your Ribs, 
it opened a restaurant on Amsterdam Avenue near 81st Street, but the 
restaurant did not try to cook there, trucking in its barbecue from 
Queens instead. The Amsterdam Avenue restaurant closed after a fire 
in 1996. What about the impending loss of Pearson's superb smoky beef 
brisket? ``I think it's further support for the notion that New York 
is an abysmal barbecue town,'' said Ed Levine, one of Pearson's fans 
and the author of ``New York Eats'' (St. Martin's Griffin, 1997). 
Jim Leff, who lives in Queens and whose book, ``The Eclectic Gourmet 
Guide to Greater New York City,'' has just been published by Menasha 
Ridge Press, had a brighter view. ``The first thing it makes me think 
of is the trend of Queens places going to Manhattan,'' Leff said. 
``On the other hand, it's OK because it would cut down on the bridge-and-tunnel 
crowd in Queens.''
