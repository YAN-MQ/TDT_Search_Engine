The world should know Tuesday if Iraq is serious about complying with 
U.N. weapons inspections. The inspectors are returning to Baghdad 
after a standoff that saw a massive buildup of U.S. forces in the 
Persian gulf. Iraq agreed over the weekend to cooperate with the inspections, 
and now President Clinton says it's time for Baghdad to follow though. 
The United States says anything less than full compliance will result 
in military strikes. The importance of this agreement now is that 
it clarifies, for all to see, that the Burden of proof is on Iraq 
to clarify the difference between what uNSCOM thinks is there and 
what Iraq says it has.
