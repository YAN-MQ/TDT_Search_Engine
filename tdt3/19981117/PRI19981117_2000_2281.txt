For today's geography quiz, we're looking for a southeast Asian country 
which borders four other nations. Cambodia and Laos to the east, Burma 
to the west and Malaysia to the south. It's steamy here. Temperatures 
soar to the '90s and the humidity makes it seem even worse. But what's 
uncomfortable weather for you is just perfect for rice growing. Rice 
is the heart of this nation's economy, but the cash crop has been 
under attack by armies of rats in the north in Arutia province. These 
voracious rodents have been ravaging the grain and infecting farmers. 
But help has come in the form of a snake. The government has released 
450 non-venomous snakes into the fields and they're expected to consume 
18 million rats a year. There's one more hint. Today's mystery nation 
used to be called Siam. We'll have the answer coming up later in the 
show.
