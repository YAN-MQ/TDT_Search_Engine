Texaco oil says all eight contract workers abducted last week in southern 
Nigeria have been released. Allegos-based spokesman for Texaco says 
they were freed together, after negotiators rejected a proposal by 
the hostage-takers to release the men one by one. Three Americans, 
a Britain, a Croatian, a Southern African, an Italian and a Nigerian 
were abducted by a band of young Nigerians from an off-shore oil rig, 
November 13th. Texaco has not released the terms under which the hostages 
were released. Reports say the kidnappers were demanding jobs and 
community development in southern Nigeria.
