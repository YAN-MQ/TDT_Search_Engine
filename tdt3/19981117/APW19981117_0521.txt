Human rights violations continue in Jordan despite political reforms 
that were introduced nine years ago, a report by Amnesty International 
says. It said the kingdom lacks ``the safeguards to prevent such violations,'' 
which include alleged prolonged incommunicado detention of political 
opponents, torture of detainees and restrictions on freedom of expression. 
It appears that several detainees have died in jail over the last 
two years following beatings by members of different security services 
and that ``sometimes there has been no proper investigation'' of the 
alleged torture, Amnesty said in the report faxed Tuesday to The Associated 
Press office in Amman, Jordan. It said detainees had no access to 
family or lawyers. There was no immediate comment from the Jordanian 
government, which boasts of a ``transparent'' policy and democracy 
in a largely totalitarian Arab world. Officials have repeatedly said 
that Jordan has no political prisoners since the reforms nine years 
ago which oversaw the revival of a multi-party system. Officials also 
have dismissed reports of torture and coerced confessions from detainees 
by the country's largely feared General Intelligence Department. ``There 
seems to be almost total impunity for members of the security services 
involved in torturing or ill-treating detainees,'' the Amnesty report 
said. It alleged arbitrary detention of political activists even those 
who committed no violent acts, but may have slandered King Hussein 
in public. It said other detainees include fans of heavy metal music 
accused of being ``satanists'' and students who took down a portrait 
of Hussein during a protest against price hikes at their college in 
southern Jordan in May 1997. The report urged Prime Minister Fayez 
Tarawneh, who took office in August, to rescind a controversial press 
and publications law enacted under a previous government three months 
ago. The law gives the state the right to control and censor the media, 
imposes stringent restrictions on reporting and hefty fines on violators 
which include confiscating press credentials and closing down the 
media outlet. The statement urged the government to bring ``Jordanian 
law and practice closer to the letter and spirit of international 
human rights treaties to which it is a state party.'' It recommended 
``an end to incommunicado detention, amending the Press Law to guarantee 
the right to freedom of expression and the inspection of detention 
centers by an independent body.''
