It's a big day for country music star Garth Brooks, but will it be 
one for the record books? His new album, "Garth: double live" is being 
released, and Brooks is hoping it will break a record for CD sales 
in a single day. He's playing a concert tonight that will be beamed 
to Wal-Mart stores nationwide to launch the new album.
