Good evening. This is going to be another uncomfortable week for President 
Clinton. There have been secret Washington tape recordings made public 
before. Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. Monica Lewinsky confiding 
in her friend, Linda Tripp, who, unknown to Ms. lewinsky, was recording 
their intimate talks. The conversations range from the banal to the 
sensational to the shocking. They won't make President Clinton's life 
any easier, but there doesn't appear to be a smoking gun, either. 
At the same time, there now appears that there is a move to expand 
the impeachment proceedings. We begin with David Bloom at the White 
House. David, what's going on in the impeachment front? Tonight democrats 
are threatening to boycott Thursday's impeachment hearings as republicans 
move to broaden the inquiry far beyond the Lewinsky case. Today, new 
evidence from independent counsel Kenneth Starr -- four boxes delivered 
to Congress focusing on allegations that the White House tried to 
buy the silence of former justice department official Webster Hubbell. 
And tonight, new signs that republicans are pointing their impeachment 
investigation in the same direction. Late today, republicans on the 
house Judiciary committee met in part to consider whether to seek 
the testimony of John huang, a Clinton Ally and former democratic 
fund-raiser who helped steer a $100,000 payment to Webb hubbell. Democrats 
say they're outraged that Starr's upcoming testimony may go far beyond 
the Lewinsky investigation. If this keeps going the way it's been 
going, democrats may decide not to come to the hearing. The White 
House seized on huang's possible testimony as proof that the impeachment 
inquiry is turning into a "fishing expedition." That will reinforce 
the American public's view that this process is not fair, expeditious 
and limited. The two sides cannot even agree on how much time the 
president's lawyers should get to cross-examine Kenneth Starr. The 
White House team wants an hour and a half. Tonight republican Henry 
Hyde said that 30 minutes is more than generous. tom? Thanks very 
much, David Bloom at the White House tonight.
