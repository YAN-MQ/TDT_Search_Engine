An estranged Sudanese rebel general tried to assassinate rebel chief 
John Garang in a weekend gunbattle in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, 
the rebel group and a newspaper said Tuesday. Both Garang, who is 
chief of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, and Maj.-Gen. Kerubino 
Kwanyin Bol, a rebel leader who had defected to the government in 
April 1997 and rejoined the rebels in January, have homes in Nairobi. 
The friction underscored rivalries in the Sudanese rebel movement, 
which has been fighting a 15-year civil war against the government 
in Khartoum for control of south Sudan. The war has left more than 
1.5 million Sudanese dead, mired any possible development and driven 
hundreds of thousands from their homes. The SPLA said in a statement 
that Kerubino, backed by the Sudanese government, had organized a 
hit squad of 20 men to assassinate Garang and a number of other senior 
rebel officials. It said the squad arrived at Garang's residence Sunday 
to kill him, but Kenyan police chased them off. However, in a conflicting 
account, the private Kenya Television Network said Kerubino said in 
an interview Tuesday that the face-off took place at a local police 
station, and not at Garang's residence. Kerubino claimed that Garang 
and several of his soldiers arrived at the police station armed and 
ordered the police officers to hand him over to Garang's men. ``From 
there I would be killed or put in prison,'' Kerubino said on KTN. 
He did not say when this took place or how he evaded capture. A report 
in the independent Daily Nation newspaper said the incident took place 
Saturday at Garang's home, and that an ensuing 30-minute gun battle 
left one of Garang's men dead, before Kenyan police arrived and chase 
the assailants away. The newspaper cited an informed source as saying 
eight supporters of Kerubino raided Garang's home with the intention 
of assassinating him and taking over control of the SPLA. A police 
spokesman contacted Tuesday refused to comment, and said all queries 
should be addressed to the Foreign Ministry, which also declined comment. 
An official at the Zambian High Commission in Nairobi confirmed to 
The AP that following the gunbattle, Kerubino and three of his supporters 
sought refuge at the diplomatic mission, but were eventually asked 
to leave. The SPLA statement said the rebel organization ``condemns 
this callous and uncivilized behavior and acts of terrorism that is 
being extended, practiced and exercised in a friendly and neighboring 
country that is a haven to our refugees and a route for humanitarian 
assistance to the people of New Sudan.'' ``We cannot turn the streets 
of Nairobi into scenes of terrorism.'' Last week, Kerubino told reporters 
that SPLA officials had confiscated his car and were harrassing him. 
The SPLA responded Tuesday saying it was ``a complete fabrication.'' 
It said Kenyan police had searched Kerubino's home for guns and a 
long-range communication radio that was interfering with police work 
and therefore arrested him.
