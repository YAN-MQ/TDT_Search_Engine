Japan's new stimulus package is a first step toward its economic recovery 
over the next two years, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said 
Tuesday. Obuchi said he was aware that Japan's recovery is important 
for other Pacific Rim countries hit by the region's financial crisis, 
and that he expects Japan's economy will begin growing again in the 
fiscal year starting in April. Japan's recession has reduced its purchases 
of Southeast Asian products. In a speech to heads of state and business 
leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Obuchi also 
noted other efforts Japan is making to help Asia pull out of recession. 
He said Japan is committed to reforming its struggling financial sector 
and to quickly implementing a planned dlrs 30 billion economic assistance 
program for the region. He also said a joint plan with the United 
States to create a dlrs 5 billion fund to guarantee new Asian bond 
issues is a ``timely response'' to the region's problems. Obuchi said 
he saw an urgent need to strengthen the global financial system, and 
he welcomed studies by the International Monetary Fund on global capital 
flows. APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong 
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, 
Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, 
the United States and Vietnam.
