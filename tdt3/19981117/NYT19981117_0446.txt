Taking a page from the litigation against the tobacco industry, three 
New York City Council members proposed Tuesday that the city file 
a lawsuit against all the nation's gun manufacturers, trying to recoup 
millions of dollars spent treating shooting victims. The proponents 
say they also hope to restrict the number of guns entering the city. 
The proposal would need the support of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and 
if he agrees, New York will join a wave of cities that have recently 
filed such suits. Last month, New Orleans became the first city in 
the country to try the tactic. Boston announced plans for a similar 
suit on Friday, and Chicago filed court papers the day before. Leaders 
in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Dade County, Florida, are also considering 
lawsuits. ``The gun makers know they're an accomplice when someone 
gets shot, but there's no incentive for them to do better,'' said 
Councilman Kenneth Fisher of Brooklyn, a lawsuit proponent. ``The 
gun manufacturers know that their guns are going to wind up in the 
wrong hands, and the gun manufacturers know they're going to wind 
up used in the wrong way.'' Lorna Bade Goodman, a senior litigator 
in the Office of the Corporation Counsel, said suing the gun industry 
was ``something we've been looking at.'' For his part, Giuliani said 
he was ``not against the idea'' but added that he needed to research 
it. While Fisher and two of his Democratic colleagues on the council 
_ Jerome O'Donovan of Staten Island and Sheldon Leffler of Queens 
_ are the chief proponents of New York's joining in lawsuits against 
gun manufacturers, the City Council on its own cannot sue. None of 
the lawsuits filed by cities have yet gone to trial, but similar cases 
filed by individuals have largely failed. A jury in Oakland, Calif., 
ruled on Monday that a gun manufacturer was not liable for the death 
of a 15-year-old boy who was shot by a friend playing with his father's 
handgun. Earlier this year, a jury in Brooklyn found seven gun companies 
not liable for the 1994 shooting death of a teen-ager on the Brooklyn 
Bridge. Other cases have been dismissed by judges. ``They're going 
after the wrong people here,'' said Stephen Sanetti, general counsel 
for Sturm, Ruger and Co., a manufacturer of rifles, shotguns, pistols 
and revolvers that is based in Southport, Conn. ``We shouldn't say 
let's sue the manufacturer of the product; we should look at who's 
using it and how.'' The New Orleans suit focuses on product liability 
law, saying the manufacturers do not take advantage of all the available 
technology to make their guns safe. The Chicago suit, seeking $433 
million in damages, claims that the manufacturers are creating a public 
nuisance by knowingly making and distributing guns for illegal uses. 
The New York council members said they were not sure how much money 
the city should seek in a lawsuit against gun manufacturers. Two advocacy 
groups that support such lawsuits _ New Yorkers Against Gun Violence 
and Physicians for Social Responsibility _ estimate that treating 
a firearm injury can cost up to $400,000. Citing Health Department 
records and other documentation, the groups said that the total medical 
cost in 1992 for gunshot injuries in New York City was more than $94 
million. But gun industry leaders said that suing them was akin to 
blaming a vintner whenever a liquor store sold to a minor. New York 
already has strict laws governing the sale of firearms, they pointed 
out. Guns are unlike tobacco, they say, because when used correctly 
they cause no harm. ``It's a feeding frenzy out there right now, and 
the industry is the red meat,'' complained Jack Adkins of the American 
Shooting Sports Council, which represents 350 manufacturers, distributors 
and retailers. `It's beyond guns now. It could be a potential threat 
to just about any industry in this country.'' ``The basic theory that 
they're pursuing is that manufacturers, distributors and retailers 
should be held responsible for the criminal or negligent use of their 
products,'' Adkins said. Proponents of the lawsuits say the courts 
are an important venue in which to attack the gun industry, because 
legislative efforts are often stymied by its powerful lobby. Barbara 
Hohlt, chairwoman of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, said that manufacturers 
made more guns than the legal market could bear and that their advertisements 
were sometimes intended for a criminal audience. ``Gun companies couldn't 
make the profits they are making if they were not knowingly producing 
for the black market,'' Ms. Hohlt said. ``You've got to come up with 
a way of stopping them. There have been a lot of legislative suggestions, 
but it's not going anywhere.''
