This is the World, a CO-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and 
WGBH Boston. Today is Tuesday, November 17. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. 
Coming up on the World, is President Clinton's call for the overthrow 
of Saddam Hussein a realistic threat or empty bluster? Also, why did 
Vice President Al Gore say what he said about Malaysia's prime minister 
and why do Jamaicans love to take on their former ruler's in a friendly 
match of cricket? It is always an opportunity to get something over 
on the white man and it's almost in direct conflict with the very 
essence of the game which is that gentlemanly conduct. First up, this 
news.
