Poor Sally Quinn. As soon as she published her landmark Washington 
Post article about why Washington insiders despise Bill Clinton's 
trashy morals, other, no doubt envious Washington insiders had the 
gall to question her morality. ``Sally's had a very interesting sex 
life of her own,'' says Charles Peters, the editor of The Washington 
Monthly, in this week's New York magazine, though he didn't produce 
any tapes to back up his claim. Some capital refugees, of whom I'm 
one, remain incredulous when anyone mentions the phrase ``interesting 
sex life'' and Washington in the same sentence. To fault Ms. Quinn 
or the other righteous Washingtonians she quotes for hypocrisy about 
sex is itself a form of hypocrisy. Washington insiders are entitled 
to keep their extramarital affairs private, even if they don't feel 
others are. The real smoking gun in Ms. Quinn's essay, far more intriguing 
on impeachment-hearing eve than all the moral pieties, involves not 
sex but the law, and her judgment of Kenneth Starr, not Clinton. ``Ken 
Starr is not seen by many Washington insiders as an out-of-control 
prudish crusader,'' Ms. Quinn wrote. ``Starr is a Washington insider, 
too,'' with ``a reputation as a fair and honest judge.'' Ms. Quinn 
did not say whether Starr's reputation for fairness stems from his 
dismissal of a $2 million libel judgment against her own paper; that 
case wasn't mentioned in her piece. But she did make it clear that 
her affection for Starr was common among the ``more than 100'' insiders 
she interviewed, many of them journalists. And that raises a serious 
question: After all the talk of a right-wing conspiracy fueled by 
Richard Mellon Scaife to bring down Bill Clinton, and a left-wing 
conspiracy fueled by James Carville to defame Bill Clinton's accusers, 
might Ms. Quinn have inadvertently unmasked a third, previously unremarked 
conspiracy? Was there a bipartisan conspiracy by Washington insiders 
to give a free journalistic pass to their fellow club member Starr? 
Certainly the evidence keeps piling up that Washington media insiders 
were as blind to Starr's adventures this year as they have been to 
the anti-impeachment sentiments of ``the American people.'' There 
has been far more detailed coverage of the dead-end ``talking points'' 
than of the independent counsel's alleged 24 illegal leaks (under 
federal investigation since June), or of his deputies' strong-arm 
efforts to prevent Monica Lewinsky from calling her lawyer when she 
was apprehended in January, or of his exact relationship to that dulcet-toned 
human wire Linda Tripp. Luckily for the country, not all the press 
lives in Georgetown. Washington outsiders, some of them too lowly 
even to appear on ``The Beltway Boys,'' have helped pursue the stories 
the Quinn co-conspirators have ignored. The latest example is the 
writer Renata Adler, who in the December Vanity Fair raises still 
more doubts about Starr's insistence that he didn't hear from Ms. 
Tripp until Jan. 12 _ and therefore could not have been in earlier 
collusion with that selfless patriot and the Paula Jones legal team 
to ambush the president in a perjury trap. By exhuming a 1994 FBI 
report (as well as Alfonse D'Amato's now-forgotten Whitewater hearing 
transcripts), Ms. Adler found that Ms. Tripp had contacts with the 
independent counsel office, both under Starr and his predecessor, 
Robert Fiske, as far back as 1994, to push murder theories about Vincent 
Foster (among other matters). This history casts doubts not only on 
Ms. Tripp's supposedly ``apolitical'' motives to betray her friend, 
but also on the veracity of her grand jury testimony this year, when 
she swore she ``had never even thought about the independent counsel 
in (her) wildest dreams'' while taping Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Adler uncovered 
much else left unreported by the Beltway gang, too, including out-of-chronology 
sequences on the Tripp tapes that cast further doubt on their integrity. 
On a lighter note, Ms. Adler also discovered that Starr had redacted 
vulgar synonyms for excrement in his published Monica encyclopedia 
_ but, inexplicably, not those for penis. This may be the only bizarre 
inconsistency in the independent counsel's behavior this year that 
we can hope investigators of the investigator will leave unexplored.
