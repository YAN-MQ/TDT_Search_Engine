Fueling the widespread speculation about his political future, Andrew 
Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development, said Tuesday that 
he had not ruled out running for the Senate from New York in 2000, 
and he said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would be a potentially formidable 
Republican rival. But Cuomo said that while Giuliani ``is widely perceived 
as having done a good job'' as mayor, he might not have the skills 
and personality required to be an effective legislator in a body of 
100 members. ``You have to be very flexible, you have to be very compromising,'' 
Cuomo, the son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, said during an hourlong 
discussion with Capitol Hill reporters. ``That is not the style he 
has demonstrated as mayor of New York. Let's say that. But I don't 
know if he would want to do it. I don't know if he would be capable 
of it. That, we would have to wait and see.'' Speaking in a Queens-flavored 
baritone reminiscent of his father's, Cuomo called Giuliani ``a talented 
man'' who would be tough to beat because he could win many votes in 
New York City, where Democrats have traditionally dominated in statewide 
races. ``Giuliani will do relatively well in the city, would be my 
guess, which would somewhat frustrate the normal equation,'' Cuomo 
said. Giuliani has not decided yet whether to seek higher office, 
but the Cuomo comments brought a retort from City Hall. ``It sounds 
like Andrew Cuomo has made the first mistake in his potential run 
for the Senate,'' said Jack Deacy, a mayoral spokesman. ``He's gone 
negative immediately, even before he's announced.'' Even as Cuomo 
was keeping his name alive in the contest to replace Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, another possible candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was announcing 
that he had decided against running for the seat, which his father 
once held. In a telephone interview from California, where he was 
giving a speech on the environment, Kennedy said that after much discussion 
with his family and friends during the last week he had decided that 
a Senate campaign would keep him away from his family far too much. 
Kennedy, 44, said he made up his mind after talking to Mark Green, 
the New York City public advocate, who lost in the Democratic primary 
this year, and Rep. Charles Schumer, who defeated Sen. Alfonse D'Amato 
two weeks ago. The two men told him that he would have to make tens 
of thousands of phone calls and spend six out of seven days a week 
for more than a year to raise enough money and build sufficient support 
to win a statewide race. ``It was clear that to make this run, I'd 
have to give up my family life,'' said Kennedy, who has five children 
ranging in age from 1 to 14. ``I want to see my kids grow up.'' Kennedy, 
a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, whose 
sister Kerry is married to Cuomo, said he had been encouraging his 
brother-in-law to run for Moynihan's seat. Since Moynihan announced 
earlier this month that he would not seek re-election after his term 
ends in 2000, a raft of well-known politicians and officials have 
said they are considering running for the seat, or allowed supporters 
to float their names as potential candidates. In addition to Cuomo, 
the Democrats include State Comptroller H. Carl McCall; Rep. Nita 
Lowey of Westchester; two of Cuomo's fellow Cabinet secretaries, Donna 
Shalala of Health and Human Services and Robert Rubin of Treasury; 
Assemblyman Michael Bragman of Syracuse, the Rev. Al Sharpton and 
George Stephanopoulos, television commentator and former adviser to 
President Clinton. In addition to Giuliani, the Republicans include 
Rep. Rick Lazio and Rep. Peter King, both of Long Island, as well 
as former Rep. Susan Molinari of Staten Island and Thomas Gulotta, 
the Nassau County executive. D'Amato has also been mentioned as a 
possible candidate, but his aides have said that he is not thinking 
about running for anything right now. Cuomo offered one reason for 
keeping quiet about running, saying that he might lose his ability 
to work with Republicans in Congress on housing legislation if he 
proclaimed an interest in the Senate seat. ``As soon as you run that 
political banner up the pole, you polarize Democrats and Republicans, 
and we'll lose the progress we're making,'' he said.
