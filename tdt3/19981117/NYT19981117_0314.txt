A dispute has arisen over a best-selling book promoting a diet that 
purports to prevent breast cancer. The book is ``The Breast Cancer 
Prevention Diet: The Powerful Foods, Supplements and Drugs that Can 
Save Your Life,'' by Dr. Bob Arnot, the physician who is a national 
correspondent for NBC television. It says that although it will be 
a decade or more before medical science fully knows what kind of diet 
may prevent breast cancer, ``you can't afford to wait'' and that ``food 
is a lot kinder to your body than drugs.'' But some scientists, including 
some whose work is cited in the book, have criticized it as making 
recommendations that are premature, misleading and misrepresentative 
of existing research results. In an interview on Tuesday, Arnot said 
he should perhaps have spoken of ``risk reduction,'' rather than prevention, 
since there are no diets, drugs or supplements that are definitely 
known to prevent breast cancer. ``Prevention is a buzz word,'' Arnot 
said, adding that the book clearly states that the specific dietary 
recommendations are ``a bet,'' not a sure thing. ``Still,'' Arnot 
said, ``I stand by the idea that food is a major part of breast cancer 
and breast cancer prevention.'' The book recommends that women limit 
their consumption of carbohydrate foods like potatoes, carrots, rice, 
bagels and popcorn that can raise levels of blood sugar, and avoid 
the fats found in most vegetable oils. The recommended diet is rich 
in soy, flaxseed and fish oils. Most experts say that not enough is 
known about nutrition and cancer to formulate a diet that can be said 
to prevent or treat breast cancer, although there are many clues to 
dietary factors that might be helpful in preventing the disease. For 
example, the American Cancer Society and those doctors who do offer 
dietary advice to breast cancer patients and women at high risk of 
developing the disease suggest that they consume a low-fat diet rich 
in fruits, vegetables and whole grains in amounts that maintain a 
normal body weight. The American Council on Science and Health, a 
nonprofit organization, issued a critique this week calling the book 
``unscientific and deceptive, a disservice to American women.'' Lilian 
Thompson, a professor of nutritional science at the University of 
Toronto whose work was cited three times in the book, said she was 
especially distressed by what she called ``a very misleading'' description 
of her research. The book states that Ms. Thompson had demonstrated 
that consuming 25 grams a day of flaxseed caused women's breast cancers 
to diminish in size. In an interview, she said the finding had been 
made only in laboratory animals and that a study of a flaxseed-supplemented 
diet in 100 breast cancer patients was far from completed. ``I never 
spoke to Dr. Arnot _ his assistant called me _ and I was very clear 
that this work is ongoing and that we don't yet know if the findings 
in animals will apply to women,'' Ms. Thompson said. ``I'm very upset 
at being quoted in this way. I'm already receiving calls from patients 
and physicians about this and I have to tell them that it's wrong.'' 
Cheryl Rock, a nutrition scientist at the University of California 
at San Diego, said she objected to the suggestion that a diet that 
she is now involved in testing can prevent breast cancer. The $13 
million study, which is being financed at seven centers by the National 
Cancer Institute, is testing the ability of a diet low in fat and 
rich in fruits and vegetables to reduce breast cancer recurrence in 
3,000 women who have already been treated for the disease. ``It's 
quite premature to come out with these guidelines,'' Ms. Rock said. 
Dr. Moishe Shike, who heads the cancer prevention program at Memorial-Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, said he recommends that 
breast cancer patients avoid being overweight, eat a diet with no 
more than 20 percent of calories from fat, consume five to eight servings 
a day of fruits and vegetables and about 25 grams a day of dietary 
fiber. `` But we cannot say that such a diet will prevent or cure 
cancer,'' he added. ``We simply don't have the evidence to support 
such an assertion.'' The Associated Press reported that Sloan Kettering 
said Arnot had agreed to remove references to the cancer center from 
subsequent editions of the book.
