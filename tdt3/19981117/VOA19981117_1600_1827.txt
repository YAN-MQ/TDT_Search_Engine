I'm Robert Burns, VOA News. United Nations weapons inspectors are 
back in Iraq after Baghdad's last minute promise of unconditional 
cooperation, narrowly averting US air strikes. The spokeswoman for 
the UN Special Commission says the inspectors will begin work Wednesday. 
She said the next few days are going to be very important to see if 
Iraq lives up to its pledge to cooperate. President Clinton has warned 
that the US forces remain ready to strike, if Baghdad goes back on 
its promise.
