Few indisputable points can be made about Walter Winchell. One is 
that in his day, from the late 1920s to the '50s, he added extraordinary 
zest to the language of tabloid journalism. In his abundantly syndicated 
column, newly married couples were ``welded'' or ``lohengrinned,'' 
or ``Adam-and-Eveing it.'' A pregnant woman was ``infanticipating,'' 
and with her mate would soon join ``the mom and population.'' If a 
couple broke up, Winchell found them ``sharing separate tepees.'' 
And all of this would assume huge importance if it happened anywhere 
near Broadway, which in his parlance was, of course, ``the main stem.'' 
But his creation of a language that caught the gaudy syncopation of 
Tinseltown and the Great White Way doesn't come close to explaining 
his lingering presence as a cultural benchmark. At the pinnacle of 
his success, in the 1940s and early '50s, Winchell's column appeared 
in about 2,000 newspapers and his radio program was the top-rated 
program on the air, beating out ``Jack Benny'' and ``Fibber McGee 
and Molly.'' More than a quarter century after Winchell died, lonely 
and angry, denuded of power and pen, often reviled and more often 
only half remembered, his story has proved to have resonant staying 
power _ what he might refer to as long legs. With steady frequency, 
writers and filmmakers examine his life, which, in an era drenched 
in celebrity journalism, has new relevance. The latest of their efforts 
is an HBO movie starring Stanley Tucci to be shown beginning Saturday. 
Also in line is Martin Scorsese, who has an option on Neal Gabler's 
critically praised book ``Winchell: Gossip, Power and the Culture 
of Celebrity.'' Michael Herr's fictionalized rendering of Winchell's 
life remains a cult favorite. And those who remember what Winchell 
referred to as the ``oh so long ago'' can recall Burt Lancaster's 
ruthless and somewhat demented version of Winchell, J.J. Hunsecker, 
in the 1957 film ``Sweet Smell of Success'' and the rat-a-tat-tat 
cadences of James Cagney and other actors influenced by Winchell's 
vocal rhythms more than half a century ago. His voice was a break-neck 
staccato. And his trademarks _ a snap-brim fedora on his head and 
a cigarette dangling from his mouth _ almost turned into a stylistic 
cliche of a certain type of big-city ``Front Page'' journalist. ``There 
are so many great themes here of power and revenge and extracting 
revenge and then paying the price for it,'' said Steven Zaillian, 
who has contracted to adapt Gabler's book for Scorsese. ``He was monstrous 
but vulnerable in a way.'' Winchell came from a family of Jewish immigrants 
from Russia and grew up in East Harlem. He first escaped New York 
immigrant poverty as a vaudeville hoofer. As a youth he began submitting 
one-liners and news to Billboard, then a stage trade paper. That led 
to a job as a columnist for the The Vaudeville News and, in early 
1924, to a column called ``Your Broadway and Mine'' for the sensationalist 
The Evening Graphic. Less than a decade later, by then enormously 
popular, he signed on with The Daily Mirror, a Hearst tabloid, for 
a daily Broadway column. Through it, in a world not yet transformed 
by television, he amassed extraordinary power, often wielded ruthlessly, 
as a purveyor of gossip, innuendo and pointed opinion delivered between 
ellipses. ``If one surveys this culture of Monica Lewinsky and O.J. 
Simpson and constant gossip and salaciousness, and one tries to trace 
the roots, you find yourself at Walter Winchell,'' Gabler said recently. 
``He was not only present at the creation of this modern journalism 
but in many respects he was the creation.'' From Table 50 at the Stork 
Club _ he never picked up the tab _ Winchell held court like a prince, 
beckoning prizefighters, movie stars, debutantes, royalty and gangsters 
to his table. He demanded to know what they were doing but talked 
most of the time himself. He mingled with the mob _ he conducted interviews 
with Al Capone and palled around with Frank Costello _ and defiantly 
dominated a Broadway world that no longer exists. One of his biggest 
coups took place in August 1939 when Louis (Lepke) Buchalter, who 
was described by J. Edgar Hoover as ``the most dangerous criminal 
in the Untied States,'' surrendered to him. Buchalter was electrocuted 
in 1944. Winchell's reach into politics and the sporting world was 
also huge. Early in his career he adored the New Deal, was a firm 
supporter of civil rights and repeatedly denounced Hitler and fascism 
far sooner than more Establishment journalists did. His two favorite 
public figures were President Franklin D. Roosevelt and FBI Director 
J. Edgar Hoover. Shortly after the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt 
asked Winchell to the White House, where he thanked him for his support 
and told him to call whenever he wanted. From then on Winchell flattered 
Roosevelt in print, but the columnist was far better known for invective. 
A New York Post series about him in 1952 led him to attack the paper 
ferociously as the ``Poo,'' the ``Compost,'' the ``Postinko'' and 
the ``Postitute.'' He called the newspaper's columnists ``presstitutes,'' 
and his constant attacks on the newspaper's editor, James Wechsler, 
were even worse. For a while he seemed power-mad. Through his radio 
show and his aggressive push for a military buildup before World War 
II, he viewed himself as nothing less than the nation's savior. His 
personal behavior was marked by tantrums. ``If he deigned to wave 
or something, you'd go over to shake his hand,'' David Brown, the 
producer, told Gabler, concerning Winchell's behavior at the Stork 
Club. ``If he ignored you, you wouldn't go near him because he'd be 
very rude.'' By the 1950s Winchell had become obsessed with communism 
and, through his friendship with Roy Cohn, embraced McCarthyism. He 
also launched a series of shrill attacks against the singer Josephine 
Baker, who created front page headlines by announcing that she had 
been snubbed at the Stork Club because she was black. The event turned 
into a cause celebre, stirring up rival columnists, including Ed Sullivan, 
who once said over the radio, ``I despise Walter Winchell because 
he symbolizes to me evil and treacherous things in the American setup.'' 
Although he narrated the television series ``The Untouchables,'' by 
1959-60, Winchell's career was in a rapid slide. His radio show was 
canceled. Jack Paar, on ``The Tonight Show,'' called him ``a silly 
old man.'' In 1963, after a devastating 114-day newspaper strike, 
The Daily Mirror folded. Hearst's Journal-American took Winchell on 
as a columnist, but he was despondent and felt he never really belonged 
to that newspaper. He hung on but in May 1967, Hearst Corp. informed 
him that his services were no longer needed on what was then the World 
Journal Tribune. As his career hurtled through its ups and downs, 
his son committed suicide, a daughter, Walda, suffered mental imbalance, 
another daughter, Gloria, whom he had adopted and adored, died of 
pneumonia, and his wife turned reclusive. He died of cancer in 1972 
and was buried with only one person, Walda, at his graveside. In the 
HBO drama, Tucci plays a complex, witty and paranoid Winchell who 
not only transformed entertainment journalism but was also a populist 
who aggressively used his columns and Sunday night radio show to champion 
what he called ``Mr. and Mrs. America,'' the underdog. The drama is 
based on the book ``Walter Winchell: His Life and Times,'' by Herman 
Klurfeld (Praeger, 1976), who wrote many of Winchell's columns and 
worked for him for 27 years. The film, directed by Paul Mazursky, 
also stars Christopher Plummer as Roosevelt and Glenne Headly as Dallas, 
a composite of the many women in the columnist's life. Klurfeld, who 
is 82 and lives in Boca Raton, Fla., said in a telephone interview 
that he was ambivalent about his former boss. ``Gossip was only a 
small part of his column, maybe 20 percent,'' said Klurfeld. ``He 
broke some of the biggest stories. He wrote about politics. He fought 
anti-Semitism when it wasn't so fashionable. ``I loved working for 
him; we had like a father-son relationship, but he was an egomaniac, 
he was stubborn and in the end he was fooled by an evil devil named 
Roy Cohn.'' It was Winchell's ``chumship'' with Cohn, as the columnist 
once put it, that led to his support of McCarthyism. Winchell's impact 
on tabloid journalism today _ and even Establishment journalism _ 
remains unquestioned. ``He did not just invent the modern gossip column,'' 
Gabler wrote. ``He became an opinion maker because he understood, 
as no one else then seemed to, the bitter subtext of the gossip he 
purveyed.'' Gabler said Winchell ``understood that gossip, far beyond 
its basic attraction as journalistic voyeurism, was a weapon of empowerment 
for the reader and listener.'' He continued: ``Invading the lives 
of the famous and revealing their secrets brought them to heel. It 
humanized them, and in humanizing them demonstrated that they were 
no better than we and in many cases worse.'' As detailed in the HBO 
drama, Winchell's downfall in the late 1950s and '60s was a result 
of several overlapping factors. After the Stork Club incident involving 
Josephine Baker, The New York Post ran a series detailing, for the 
first time, Winchell's hunger for power and his relationships with 
and defense of Hoover and Sherman Billingsley, the owner of the Stork 
Club. In addition, Winchell's personal demons made him vulnerable. 
``He was an egomaniac,'' Klurfeld said. ``Old age didn't creep up 
on him. Overnight he became a sick old man.'' What was perhaps most 
damaging to Winchell, Tucci said, was the columnist's inability to 
accommodate himself to television. ``When he was young he was really 
handsome, a kind of Don Juan. Women were crazy about him,'' Tucci 
said. ``He was actually a movie actor for a while. But when he got 
older and tried television, he looked like some strange, nervous elf. 
He was from a different time and people recognized that. He kept wearing 
a hat, and people stopped wearing hats. ``If you see the tapes, he 
never stopped moving, he looked a little crazy. People in the audience 
laughed. When you hear that voice, it's exciting. But when you see 
him doing it, it's like a madman.'' Zaillian recalled seeing a photograph 
of Winchell caught in a riot at the 1968 Democratic convention. By 
this time he was a has-been, his column vestigial, his broadcast long 
gone. ``He always wanted to be a legitimate reporter, and here he 
was, with hippies and police and young reporters, wearing his fedora 
hat with a press thing in it, and he was sort of falling over, and 
the caption identified him as an unidentified reporter,'' Zaillian 
said. ``It had to be the last nail in the coffin, but maybe he would 
say that this was his grandest moment. He was actually identified 
as a reporter.''
