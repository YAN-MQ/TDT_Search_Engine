Much of Ukraine's capital Kiev may be without electricity in the coming 
days because the city's cash-strapped energy provider cannot afford 
to meet the growing demand, news reports said Tuesday. The Kievenergo 
company, which distributes electricity and heat for this city of 3 
million, has no other choice but to start to ``massively'' cut off 
consumers in order to compensate for power shortages, Kievenergo said 
in a statement cited by the independent Ukrainian News Service. Kievenergo 
appealed to companies and enterprises to begin working during night 
hours when demand for energy is lower, and warned Kiev city authorities 
to take preventive measures to avoid possible damage from sudden electricity 
cutoffs. Temperatures throughout most of Ukraine have sunk below 0 
C (32 F) and heavy snowfalls have hit Kiev in recent days, causing 
a sharp increase in gas and electricity consumption. But Kiev's energy 
plants, owed tremendous sums by consumers, are unable to purchase 
enough fuel to increase production and are already buying fuel with 
money allocated for wage payments, Kievenergo chief Ivan Plachkov 
said. The situation with energy supplies to Kiev will become ``unpredictable'' 
if the temperature continues to drop, the daily Fakty quoted Plachkov 
as saying. The former Soviet republic's energy sector is plagued by 
mounting cash problems. Most Ukrainian companies have become loss-making 
as a result of the country's continuing economic decline and have 
practically stopped paying for electricity and heat. Consumers' total 
energy debt rose to 4.3 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.25 billion) by November, 
increasing by nearly 500 million hryvna (dlrs 145 million) in October 
alone, Ukrainian News said.
