L'ANSE DE'PRIEN NOIR, La. _ Alphonse (Bois Sec) Ardoin, 82, an accordion 
player and farmer, is checking his hogs on a muggy, mosquito-ripe 
autumn afternoon. ``Allez, cochons,'' Ardoin chants as dragonflies 
dart above the hog pens. ``Allez.'' Walking past his swaybacked barn, 
his dog, Sunshine, trailing after, Ardoin says: ``Me? I got eight 
acres and three hogs.'' And, he should add, a new album on Rounder 
Records, ``Allons Danser,'' made with the Cajun band Balfa Toujours, 
which is led by Christine Balfa, the daughter of Ardoin's friend the 
fiddler Dewey Balfa, who died in 1992. The album is a heartfelt cry 
redolent of a time before radio and television, traditional French 
music from South Louisiana powered by Ardoin's bluesy, black Creole 
singing and accordion playing. ``It feels good to me, having a new 
record out,'' says Ardoin, who had not recorded in 20 years. ``But 
I play music to be with other people. You need other people for the 
music to be good.'' That attitude is why Ms. Balfa and her husband, 
Dirk Powell, also a member of Balfa Toujours, have driven the hour 
or so north of Lafayette _ past fields of sugar cane and rice, past 
crawfish farms, past cypress knees poking out of the bayous _ to Ardoin's 
place here in Evangeline Parish. ``We're used to playing with Bois 
Sec at least once a month, just for fun,'' Ms. Balfa says. For Ardoin, 
Ms. Balfa, Powell and others in their community, music has never been 
a career; it has meant living and breathing. The vital French music 
of the region _ 22 parishes called Acadiana _ hasn't been shunted 
to the museum, to be occasionally dusted off and propped on a sterile 
stage. Cajun and black Creole music features fiddles and accordions 
complemented by the haunting, high-pitched singing of French lyrics; 
the main difference is that the Creole fiddler or singer is bluesier 
than his Cajun brother. Zydeco takes the rural tradition of the black 
Creoles and marries it to rhythm-and-blues, creating a louder, more 
urban dance music in which the groove is all important. French music 
thrived here because of South Louisiana's isolation, both physical 
and cultural. But what happened here is not an isolated event. Often 
damned for its take-no-prisoners mass culture, the United States has 
always found room for local, often country, musics: the strong fiddling 
tradition that grew up around Galax, Va.; the African-American fife-and-drum 
bands of Northern Mississippi; the Mexican-American conjunto born 
along the Texas-Mexico border. And the omnivorous popular culture 
has never been shy about borrowing (stealing?) from the locals, as 
Cajuns know. Hank Williams's ``Jambalaya (On the Bayou)'' was a country 
hit. The Cajuns Jimmy C. Newman and Doug Kershaw made it to the Grand 
Ole Opry with pale versions of their childhood music. As the fad for 
all things Louisianan bloomed in the 1980s, Paul Simon dabbled in 
the sounds of Acadiana and the 1987 movie ``The Big Easy'' featured 
a Cajun detective and a soundtrack of Louisiana music. And isn't that 
a rowdy zydeco accordion heard on the occasional Budweiser television 
commercial? But so what? South Louisiana's French-speaking culture 
has not only survived the broader culture's disdain and lack of interest 
(then annoying obsession) but has also reached the late 1990s healthy 
and intact. No mean feat in these days of cultural cannibalism. And 
on this day it seems that Ardoin, Ms. Balfa and Powell are celebrating 
that good fortune, doing their bit for cultural renewal. The threesome 
play for a good two hours, Ms. Balfa on guitar, Powell on fiddle and 
Ardoin, accordion balanced on his right knee as his feet tap time: 
``Donnez Mon Chapeau,'' ``Valse a Canray,'' ``Duralde Ramble.'' Although 
he has played Carnegie Hall and has played worldwide, it's understood 
that Ardoin is just as happy making homemade music with his friends 
and family, maybe happier. He is a farmer who plays music (and who 
has brought up 14 children), not a musician who plays at farming. 
Yes, he received a National Heritage Fellowship award in 1986, but 
in 1992 he was the grand marshal of the Louisiana Swine Festival. 
Ardoin, who was born in the house next to his small farm, pauses between 
songs. ``I could play day and night when I was young,'' he says. ``But 
the last two days I've been cutting tall grass. My back and arms hurt, 
and the mosquitoes were eating me, too.'' He laughs; the music surges 
on. ``Allons Danser'' grew out of Ms. Balfa and Powell's musical get-togethers 
with Ardoin, whose last album, ``The Ardoin Family Orchestra With 
Dewey Balfa: A Couple of Cajuns,'' had been made with Ms. Balfa's 
father, whom he had known since the 1950s. Ms. Balfa recalls that 
as they played at Ardoin's farm one day, she said: ``Hey, you remember 
that record you did with Daddy? I think it's time we turned it around 
and made `Bois Sec Ardoin With Balfa Toujours.''' Ms. Balfa says, 
``And Bois Sec said, `Don't say that if you don't mean it, no.''' 
Of his new album, Ardoin says, ``It still feels good to hear yourself 
on the radio.'' Petty thievery was crucial in Ardoin's learning how 
to play accordion as a boy. ``These white boys I knew would steal 
an accordion from their parents, and then we'd go sit by the canal 
and I'd play,'' Ardoin remembers. He also used to pinch his brother 
Houston's accordion, hide in the hayloft of the family barn and practice. 
By the time his brother found out, Ardoin played so well that Houston 
gave him the instrument. ``My brother said: `I can't even play one 
song. Here, you take it.''' And that nickname? Ardoin didn't like 
working in the rain as a boy, and he knew of a hollow tree where he 
could hide when he felt the raindrops. That kind of tree was called 
``bois sec,'' or dry wood, and the name stuck. As Ardoin, Powell, 
29, and Ms. Balfa, 30, jam in Ardoin's kitchen, it's hard to believe 
that in the late 90s their music still makes some in their community 
angry. But it is so. ``There are people saying, `I can't believe Christine 
recorded with that black man,''' Ms. Balfa says. Balfa Toujours had 
to grapple directly with questions of race and ethnic identity last 
January when, on Martin Luther King Day, they were dismissed from 
a job by a dance club in Basile, Ms. Balfa's hometown, because of 
their friendship with Geno Delafose, a black zydeco musician. Ms. 
Balfa says the club's owner was worried that Delafose might join her 
band onstage and offend his customers. Of her friendship with Delafose, 
Ms. Balfa says, ``It seems we can share the stage together all around 
the country and the world, yet we can't do it where we grew up.'' 
Balfa Toujours's run-in with racism is a haunting reminder of what 
happened to Amede Ardoin, a cousin of Bois Sec's and one of the region's 
most important and influential musicians, at a dance in the early 
40s. All Amede Ardoin did was wipe his sweat away with a handkerchief 
given him by a Cajun woman. After the dance, he was nearly beaten 
to death by white men enraged that a black man would use a white woman's 
handkerchief. Bob Reed, 55, a white accordion player who grew up on 
a farm next to Bois Sec Ardoin's, finds such racism bewildering. ``When 
I was a boy, we were color-blind,'' he says. ``We always just considered 
ourselves to be poor people. Everybody used to go to the country store 
in the afternoon after cutting rice. I used to play harmonica while 
Bois Sec was playing. A lot of songs I play today are his style.'' 
Sometimes, the music would be at Ardoin's farm _ music, and more. 
``Bois Sec was always known for his boucherie,'' Reed says. ``He'd 
butcher pigs twice a year, and everyone was welcome, white and black. 
There'd be boudin, cracklins, pork roast, andouille.'' Just inside 
the front door of Ms. Balfa and Powell's house on Bayou Teche in La 
Pointe, a button accordion _ ``made in Louisiana'' _ sits on a bench 
as if waiting for the right player, a bayou Excalibur. ``That belonged 
to my father,'' says Ms. Balfa of Dewey Balfa. ``It's made out of 
cypress,'' Powell adds. ``It's light but hard, and water doesn't affect 
it. This house is made of cypress.'' As is, perhaps, Balfa's reputation. 
``He's a constant presence in our lives,'' Ms. Balfa says of her father. 
``We're trying to carry on his message. I always feel his presence 
when we play.'' In 1964 Balfa, the fiddling son of a sharecropper 
who also drove a school bus and sold insurance, was a late replacement 
at that year's folk music festival in Newport, R.I. A local newspaper, 
however, considered Balfa's invitation to play Cajun music an embarrassment, 
especially to those trying to put their country roots behind them. 
``Daddy had never seen more than 200 people together at one time before,'' 
Ms. Balfa says. ``And 17,000 people gave him a standing ovation after 
the first song. And that changed his life. He became a strong advocate 
for Cajun culture.'' Powell adds: ``We still get cards and letters 
from people who have Dewey dreams. As Christine's cousin, Courtney 
Granger, got ready to record his first album, he had a dream that 
Dewey was in the room with him, and that Dewey had touched his heart, 
and he cried as he told us the story. That gave Courtney such a sense 
of emotion when he went to make his record.'' But as much as Balfa 
Toujours honors the past _ and the past is never past in Louisiana 
_ it is careful not to turn its music into mere waltzing with ghosts. 
``Music has to be a part of people's lives,'' Ms. Balfa says. ``And 
as a musician, you have to make that connection with people when you 
play.'' The band's latest album, ``La Pointe,'' recorded in Ms. Balfa 
and Powell's living room and kitchen, mixes traditional songs like 
``Pa Janvier'' and ``Le Reel de Courville'' with their own compositions. 
``We're always looking deeper into the tradition, into the center 
of it rather than outside it,'' Powell says. ``There's so much richness 
in it as far as writing original songs.'' Powell, an old-time musician 
whose family and musical roots stretch back to the mountains of Eastern 
Kentucky, has found Louisiana's French-speaking culture congenial. 
``Almost everyone has been accepting,'' he says. ``People are flattered 
that someone from outside wants to play their music. In clubs it's 
never an issue. The only test is whether you're playing it right or 
not. People will come up and ask for a song that was recorded 40 years 
ago.'' So, how did Powell learn all those songs? ``I listened a lot, 
and I used to play the accordion while I was driving,'' he says. ``When 
I was dating Christine, I'd travel between Maryland and Louisiana, 
and I'd drive with my knees on those long interstate stretches.'' 
In South Louisiana, music is still passed generation to generation, 
a quilt made up of fiddles, guitars and accordions. Especially accordions: 
Powell estimates that there are more than 50 accordion makers in the 
region. In the Basile-Mamou area, Ardoins and Balfas have been making 
music since at least the 19th century; this year three generations 
each of Balfas and Ardoins performed together in London. Two high 
school students lead the youngest generation. Courtney Granger (who 
plays fiddle) is completing his first album with the help of Balfa 
Toujours, while Chris Ardoin, whose grandfather is Bois Sec, leads 
a popular zydeco band, Double Clutchin', which also features his brother 
Sean. On the band's 1997 album, ``Gon' Be Jus' Fine,'' it recorded 
songs by both Bois Sec and Amede Ardoin. In the album's liner notes, 
Chris's father, Lawrence, says Double Clutchin' remade the 1930 recording 
of ``Amede Two Step'' into ``Ardoin Two Step.'' ``Chris plays it just 
like Amede.'' his father said. It's a steamy Louisiana Saturday night, 
and at the Bourques Club, a dance hall in Lewisburg (pop. 300). The 
accordion player Horace Trahan and the Ossun Express hold court. Couples 
of all ages glide, waltz and two-step to the hard-driving accordion, 
the sobbing fiddle. ``Of course the old people dance,'' Ms. Balfa 
says. ``It's what they do. It keeps them young.'' Dancing is a birthright 
here, a good time on a Saturday night after a hard week's work: dim 
lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music. Red tablecloths (cigarette-scarred, 
patched and repatched) disguise plank tables, the jukebox offers tunes 
by the Louisiana Aces, the Balfa Brothers and Le Band Passpartout, 
and for tonight anyway Bud is indeed the King of Beers. The band, 
helped by Ms. Balfa and Powell (Trahan is a carpenter who sometimes 
works on their house), is lighted by one naked, bug-sticky bulb; after 
playing for four hours, each band member will be paid $50 to $70. 
As the Ossun Express finishes a song, someone shouts, ``Un autre 'tit 
bout!'' (``Another little bit!'') The dancer liked the song so much 
that he wants to dance to it a little longer. ``In this music the 
line between the band and the audience is almost nonexistent,'' Powell 
says. ``You can go up and meet the biggest star in this music and 
shake his hand.'' Dominick Cross, editor and publisher of In Tune, 
a Lafayette magazine that covers South Louisiana music, says (in between 
dancing): ``The music is so important here. In Lafayette there are 
15 or so clubs, and every town has a dance hall. It's part of the 
culture. There's a lack of influence from white-bread America. People 
here don't talk about culture. They live it.'' Later, two French friends 
of Ms. Balfa and Powell's show up. The friends, Bruno Catheline and 
Michel Salmon, have a Cajun band back home in Brittany, so Trahan, 
as he would for any local player, invites them to sit in with his 
band. Suddenly the world shrinks, centuries fall away: the original 
Acadians left Brittany and Normandy and arrived in what became Nova 
Scotia in 1604, taking their music with them. By the mid-1700s, many 
Acadians had arrived in Louisiana, Ms. Balfa's descendants included, 
exiled by the British. Now, two musicians from Brittany are playing 
Cajun music in a Louisiana dance hall, music whose roots are buried 
deep in their homeland. ``I love Cajun music,'' says Catheline, who 
plays and builds accordions. ``And to play with the Cajuns is magnificent. 
I stayed up all night after I heard Dewey Balfa play in Brittany in 
1992.'' Trahan introduces his guests, then cries: ``Allons, danser!'' 
A touch of Dewey Balfa in his voice, a Bois Sec Ardoin quiver. The 
dance floor fills. Ghosts waltz. The tradition lives.
