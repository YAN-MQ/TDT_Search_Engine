PARIS (AP) - A six-page, hand-scrawled rough draft of Arthur Rimbaud's 
masterpiece ``A Season in Hell'' was sold Tuesday to France's National 
Library for 2.9 million francs (dlrs 517,000), about half of its presale 
estimate. The state-run library which opened to the public in 1996 
exercized its right of preemption and obtained the manuscript for 
the amount of the final bid. All state-run institutions in France 
have the right to preempt art and other valuables for its collections. 
The sale at the Drouot-Montaigne auction house fetched a total of 
12 million francs (dlrs 2.1 million). The sale included 10 autographed 
poems by Rimbaud and two letters by Lautreamont, a 19th century novelist. 
Smudged, yellowed with age, and filled with corrections, the notebook-size 
pages give a rare glimpse into the creative genius of the precocious 
writer who renounced poetry at 19 to travel the world. ``Une Saison 
en Enfer'' (A Season in Hell), a prose poem dating from 1873, has 
long been a cult work among Rimbaud admirers. It expresses his passion 
for the writer Paul Verlaine, his lover with whom he would eventually 
quarrel, as well as his religious and aesthetic convictions. The manuscript, 
which experts thought had been destroyed long ago, belonged to a 97-year-old 
bibliophile who claimed he had never shown it in public. Jacques Guerin, 
one of France's foremost collectors, said he first stumbled on the 
Rimbaud manuscript in London in 1938, but couldn't afford to buy it. 
He finally tracked it down in 1950 and never let it out of his sight. 
In March, the library shelled out 3 million francs (dlrs 535,000) 
for the manuscript of Rimbaud's ``La Lettre du Voyant'' (The Letter 
of the Clairvoyant).
