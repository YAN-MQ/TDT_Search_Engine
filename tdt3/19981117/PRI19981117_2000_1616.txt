The other top business story of the day was the official unveiling 
of the new car giant Daimler Chrysler. We get details from Patrick 
O'Connell, at our business desk in New York. No bell at the New York 
Stock Exchange this morning. Instead, the rush hour chorus known to 
drivers worldwide, all publicity to mark the launch of the new firm. 
The new Daimler Chrysler is the fifth largest car maker in the world. 
It will have 430,000 employees globally and it's expected to be just 
the first such marriage. Bob Eaton of the old Chrysler and Yurgen 
Shremp of the old Daimler have told us they think that by the end 
of the decade, they could be just 10 independent car makers in the 
world. They're talking of the lessons from Mercedes and its sports 
utility plant in Alabama. Mr. Schremp first. There you have the brew. 
Germans and Americans and other nationalities working together, a 
great team, a great product and we will do that now with a new company 
Daimler Chrysler. Will there by job cuts? Definitely not. We're very 
fortunate that we don't have enough capacity now. We're both growing. 
We're both gaining market share and this new company will be adding 
people. Mr. Eaton, who's next in this marriage season for car makers? 
I don't know, but I know of at least a half a dozen talks going on 
right now and of course we're involved in talks as well. So there 
is going to be a consolidation. It's a question of how fast. I suspect 
it'll be pretty rapid however. Many independent analysts warn that 
international mergers share some of the challenges of producing a 
car. Moving from concept to the working model is an entire job in 
itself. For the World, I'm Patrick O'Connell in New York.
