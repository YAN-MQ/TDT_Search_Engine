the defending Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos continued their championship 
caliber play, Monday, thumping out the Kansas City Chiefs 30 to 7: 
In front of a nationally televised audience, Denver used a balanced 
attack along with a stifling defense in turning the American conference 
rivalry into a rout. Reserve quarterback Bubbie Blister completed 
13 of 23 passes for 180 yards, and he added 53 yards rushing, including 
a 38 yard touchdown run. Fullback Turell Davis though is the man on 
the ground for Denver, with 111 yards and a touchdown, he remains 
on pace to shatter the league's single season records for rushing 
and touchdowns. Kansas City was penalized five times in the fourth 
quarter for personal fouls. Chief Coach Martie Shotenheimer says his 
team embarrassed itself. The way we permitted the fourth quarter to 
go, is as good a disappointment as I've ever had in my coaching experience. 
I'm apologizing to you, to this community, because I'm embarrassed. 
Denver Coach Mike Shanahan says a game as important as the one on 
Monday night, in a situation like that, rough play is to be expected. 
Well, there is some tempers. Anytime you have a game that two teams 
are fighting as hard as they are, there are always tempers that will 
rise. And sometimes it is something that people don't like to see, 
but that's the nature of the game. But I was pleased that our players 
kept their poise and didn't strike back. And when you don't do that, 
you are able to get some penalties and some cheap first downs. The 
Broncos are the first team since the 1991 Washington Redskins to open 
a season with ten wins, and no losses.
