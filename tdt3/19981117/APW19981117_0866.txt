Germany's new government will hold its first Cabinet meeting in Berlin, 
the prewar capital, next week, a spokeswoman said Tuesday. It was 
a sign that Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's first chancellor without 
personal experience of World War II, intends to hasten the government's 
planned return to Berlin despite new reports of building delays and 
cost overruns. Government ministers will meet next Tuesday in a central 
Berlin building once used by communist East German rulers that is 
serving as Schroeder's interim office in Berlin, government spokeswoman 
Charima Reinhardt said. Schroeder, who is chairing the session, will 
be in the capital to meet governors of eastern German states. Plans 
for the 20 billion mark (dlrs 12 billion) move of the capital from 
Bonn call for parliament to meet in Berlin starting next fall, marking 
the start of the ``Berlin Republic.'' A government review of the move 
reportedly has determined that most construction of government offices 
had fallen behind. But the government said Monday it will keep to 
the schedule. Schroeder, 54, unseated longtime chancellor Helmut Kohl 
in September elections.
