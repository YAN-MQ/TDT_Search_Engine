It takes a lot of tax money to keep Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
in line. Since the Persian gulf war, U.S. taxpayers have spent $7 
billion on military buildups in the region. Just maintaining a presence 
there costs an additional $50 billion a year. That means one-sixth 
of the annual U.S. defense budget goes to maintaining the gulf deployment. 
If an air strike had happened last weekend, it would have cost another 
$1 billion.
