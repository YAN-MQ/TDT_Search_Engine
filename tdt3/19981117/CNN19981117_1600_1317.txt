Chiefs coach Marty schottenheimer is still simmering after his team's 
blatant lack of discipline in Monday's loss to Denver. Five personal 
fouls on the Broncos final drive prompted this apog to the team's 
owner and others close to the club. I want to apologize to Lamar so 
that people in this organization, and particularly to the fans of 
this community.
