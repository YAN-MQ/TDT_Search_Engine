A truck carrying sand and at least 100 hitchhiking schoolchildren 
overturned at the side of a highway Tuesday in eastern India, killing 
at least eight and injuring 28 others. At least five of the injured 
were in serious condition in Balasore, near India's eastern coast 
in Orissa state, police official Devin Mohanty said by telephone. 
The town is 1,250 kilometers (775 miles) to the southeast of New Delhi. 
One hundred children were crouching or squatting on the truckbed of 
sand to hitch a ride from their remote village schools to a science 
exhibition at a regional government school. Fourteen students were 
buried in the sand when the truck swerved, lost control and toppled 
over near Kuchiakoili town, Mohanty said. The driver fled the spot. 
Few other details were immediately available.
