Lewinsky in her own voice. He just makes me so angry, you know. It's 
like I think he has no idea what I'm going through. Linda Tripp's 
secret tapes. What they reveal about the president and the intern. 
Prime cut, another drop in interest rates. Now the ripple effect. 
What it means for you. "In depth" tonight, that spectacular meteor 
shower not over yet. And the people trying to prevent a high-tech 
disaster. In our special series, the high cost of prescription drugs. 
For millions of Americans, choosing between food and medicine. broadcasting
