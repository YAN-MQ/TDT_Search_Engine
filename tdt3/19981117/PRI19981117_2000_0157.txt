The Malaysian government is enraged with the U.S. for its support 
of demonstrators demanding political reform. The displeasure comes 
as Prime Minister Mayhateer Moyahmed hosts the sixth annual APEC summit. 
From Kuala Lampur, NPR's Julie McCarthy reports. The leaders of 22 
Asian Pacific economies dined to dancing men and women in traditional 
dress at one of the many luxury hotels that make up the central city 
skyline. One day after a speech that infuriated Malaysian government 
officials, Vice President Al Gore greeted Prime Minister Mayateer 
at the crowded dinner, but said little else. Gore mingled mostly with 
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakoff and Chinese President Xuang 
Ximin. Gore's remarks praising the pro reform movement here drew criticism 
from more than just Malaysia. A spokeswoman for the U.S. business 
council on OSEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said 
American businesses who came for constructive solutions to the region's 
economic ills were "mortified." This is Julie McCarthy, NPR News, 
Kuala Lampur.
