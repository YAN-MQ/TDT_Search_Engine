He was known as Tito Landrum in the '80s. He stood in against Nolan 
Ryan and Doc Gooden when their fastballs buzzed under his chin, but 
he never knew fear until he sat in a classroom at New York University. 
``Those kids were more qualified than me,'' he said the other day, 
a college graduate, a man with a future. ``There would be a three-hour 
class and a half-hour break and another three-hour class. I did not 
know how to handle it. I was out of the loop.'' He is now called Terry 
Landrum, his given name. Last May his peers chose him valedictorian 
of his college class, the School of Education at NYU. ``I had a problem 
with that,'' he said. ``Some of them had 3.9 averages, and mine was 
only 3.3. But they wanted me to do it, and it was an honor.'' With 
his bachelor's in physical therapy, Terry Landrum will have a life 
after sports. Not all athletes make the break, and some of them run 
into very public trouble. Too gracious to bring up the subject himself, 
Landrum conceded that some of his colleagues still seem to be grieving 
for their former life. ``I go to some of the golf tournaments and 
card shows,'' he said. ``I ask them, `What are you doing?' and they 
say, `Oh, nothing.' You'd be amazed at some of them. Where are they 
now?'' Obviously, many athletes do not live in the past, but shed 
their clubhouse manners and life style when it is time, and become 
useful members of the broader society. There is the former professional 
running back and Supreme Court justice, Byron White, once known as 
Whizzer. There is Sally Ride, former junior tennis player, rugby player 
at Stanford, later an astronaut. There is Scotty Baesler, a former 
basketball captain for Kentucky, losing a tight election to Jim Bunning, 
a pitcher of a perfect game, for a Senate seat. There are Tenley Albright, 
Bobby Brown, Eric Heiden, Dot Richardson, Ron Taylor and Debi Thomas, 
doctors all. Depending on your definition of athlete, there is also 
Jesse (the Body) Ventura, the professional wrestler who, winning the 
governorship of Minnesota this month, said, ``You can't win until 
you learn how to lose.'' Landrum knew he was learning lessons while 
taking eight years to reach the St. Louis Cardinals. Last week he 
said: ``I was not an everyday player, so I had to go early for practice. 
I would stay late and listen to everybody. I accepted criticism. That 
was the only way to learn.'' He had his moments. In 1983, he was shuttled 
to Baltimore, and he hit the homer in Chicago that won the American 
League series. In 1985, when Vince Coleman absent-mindedly became 
entangled in the tarpaulin, Landrum stepped in and batted .429 in 
the league series and .360 in the World Series, and relished every 
moment of it. He was, for the record, one of the good people in a 
major league clubhouse, willing and able to express himself, while 
many of the Cardinals were grumbling about all those journalists asking 
all those questions. When his career ended in 1989, Tito Landrum tried 
for a job in baseball, and none was forthcoming, if you can imagine 
that. In 1991, he moved to New York with his fiancee, Carol Williams, 
an award-winning producer now with ABC's ``Discovery'' series. ``Carol 
is my heart and soul,'' he said. ``We've been together 11 years. When 
she suggested I go back to school, I was frightened because I had 
been an average student in high school, and had no background in science 
or math, all the things I hated and, quite honestly, ducked. But I 
took one course in biology and got a B, and that excited me.'' He 
had not made a ton of money in baseball, and wound up taking a student 
loan after seeking guidance from Richard Lapchick of the Northeastern 
University Center for the Study of Sports in Society. Accepted into 
the highly selective physical therapy program at NYU, Landrum felt 
like a rookie who has just seen his first big-time curveball. ``The 
main thing I had was my work ethic,'' he said. ``I showed up early, 
and I asked questions. I had four tutors, and I would sit and talk 
with those bright kids about how to study.'' Last May 13, in his elegant 
speaking voice, Terry Landrum gave his valedictory talk, a masterpiece 
in six quick paragraphs. He recalled a minister's parable about a 
race in which the two fastest runners became careless and fell down. 
``I've always identified with the slowest runner,'' Landrum said. 
``I spent eight long years in the minors. Then I made it to three 
World Series. Not one of them felt as good as it feels to be here 
today.'' Since then, Landrum has completed eight-week clinical internships, 
one in cardiopulmonary medicine, one in orthopedics, and is now studying 
to gain his license. He hopes to specialize in female athletes who 
are coming down with a major number of noncontact knee injuries. He 
would have been an asset for any baseball team in the front office, 
or with a television network. Instead, Terry Landrum has applied the 
positive values from sport toward his own education and a useful career 
in the broader world.
