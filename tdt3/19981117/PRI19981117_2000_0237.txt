The baseball writers of America have named Tom Glavin as the National 
League's most valuable player. The Atlanta Braves left-handed edged 
out Trevor Jones of the San Diego Padres who actually got more first 
place votes. It's the second Si Young award for Glavin who led the 
National League with 20 wins.
