Scientists have uncovered what appears to be a dinosaur nursery in 
Argentina. The site contains thousands of eggs and several dinosaur 
embryos. NPR's Christopher Joyce has more. The fossil hunting team 
stumbled on the egg site while looking for dinosaur bones in the northwestern 
part of Patagonia. They found mostly egg fragments and in a few of 
those fragments, the fossilized bones of dinosaur embryos. Paleontologists 
suspect the embryos were about to hatch when they were buried and 
quickly fossilized. The embryos are the first ever found belonging 
to a group of dinosaurs known as sauropods. These were the giant plant 
eating dinosaurs with long necks and tails. There were also intact 
eggs about six inches across. The hatchlings, had they been born would 
have measured about 15 inches long. The scientists from the American 
Museum of Natural History in New York also found fossilized dinosaur 
skin, complete with scales. They reported their discovery in this 
week's issue of the journal, Nature. Christopher Joyce, NPR News, 
Washington.
