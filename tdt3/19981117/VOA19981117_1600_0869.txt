In US news, the American public is getting a chance to hear the secret 
recordings that launched the investigation of President Clinton's 
relationship with former White House Intern, Monica Lewinsky. VOA's 
Paula Wolfson reports they've seen the transcripts, now for the first 
time they can listen to her voice. It's a rather average voice for 
a young American women, nothing that would stand out in a crowd. Ms. 
Lewinsky sounds frustrated and confused at times, and she confides 
in the older women who befriended her, Linda Tripp. She complains 
about her job at the Pentagon and her inability to return to the White 
House. Sometimes there is anger in her voice as she talks about the 
President. And sometimes the tone is strangely love-struck and naive. 
The first time I ever looked into his eyes close up, and was with 
him alone, I saw somebody totally different than I had expected to 
see. And that's the person I fell in love with. She speaks frankly 
in the conversations, totally unaware that Ms. Tripp has attached 
a recording device to her telephone. The older women plays the role 
of confidante, often probing for information, particularly about Ms. 
Lewinsky's contacts with the President. He knows you're going to lie, 
you've told him haven't you? no. I thought that night when he called, 
you established that much? Well, I mean, I don't know. Oh, Jesus ! 
Well, does he think you are going to tell the truth? no. The final 
tapes in the series are barely audible. For their last meeting, Ms. 
Tripp wore a hidden microphone and tape recorder provided by investigators. 
I'm trying to be as honest with you as I can. No, I understand, because 
I think I'm not understanding what you are saying. I don't, I don't 
- Do you understand what I have riding on this. I mean, don't think 
I'm trivializing your situation - I know -- It took recording engineers 
weeks to prepare the tapes for distribution. The House Judiciary Committee 
ordered some portions of the recordings cut because parts of the conversations 
were too graphic or amounted to idle gossip about people not connected 
to the case. Paula Wolfson, VOA News, Capitol Hill.
