A growing rift between Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema and his 
main rival could escalate into a political crisis unless the two sides 
find common ground, says a special envoy from France. A report made 
public Tuesday by French member of parliament Kofi Yamgnane urged 
Eyadema and opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio to settle their election-related 
dispute and work together. Olympio has filed a protest with Togo's 
Supreme Court, contesting the results of June presidential elections 
which Eyadema won. Election monitors from the European Union said 
the vote was flawed and even members of Togo's election commission 
have resigned in protest. Yamgnane, who is of Togolese descent, spent 
much of last week in Togo's capital trying to bring Olympio and Eyadema 
together for a meeting. Eyadema earlier offered to form a coalition 
government with Olympio, but the opposition leader rejected the proposal 
and said he would continue to contest the June election results. Olympio, 
who lives in neighboring Ghana, met on Monday with that country's 
president, Jerry Rawlings, to discuss the political impasse in Togo. 
Rawlings urged the two sides to work together and called on France 
to help find a solution to the problem. Eyadema has ruled Togo since 
seizing power 31 years ago in a bloody military coup, during which 
he ordered the execution of former President Sylvanus Olympio, Gilchrist's 
father.
