To the situation in the Persian gulf tonight. U.N. weapons inspectors 
returned today just three days after the Iraqi government came close 
to air strikes. They agreed to comply with U.N. demands. Chief among 
them, allow the inspectors to return to work. Although the crisis 
is over for now, the U.S. and its allies warn it will strike without 
warning if Iraq goes back on its promingses. "The New York Times" 
reported that an attack is still inevitable before long as Iraqi compliance 
is bound to fall short.
