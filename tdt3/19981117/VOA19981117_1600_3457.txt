Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. Well, let's go to Africa 
now for a few weather forecasts. On Wednesday it will be rainy and 
cool in Algiers with a high of 17 degrees. Rabat, Morocco a little 
warmer at 22, although you can expect sunshine, a pleasant day. Tripoli, 
19 degrees for your high, it will be showery and cool throughout the 
day. Accra, Ghana, your high temperature on Wednesday, 30 degrees. 
Partly cloudy and sunshine on and off thoughout the day, a humid day 
for you. And Addis Ababa, your high temperature, 27 degrees on Wednesday, 
it will be sunny. It's just about time to end this hour of VOA News 
Now. We're coming close to 22 hours Universal time. And it means that 
we are closing down on all frequencies to the Middle East, North Africa 
and Europe except for 1548 kilohertz medium wave to the Persian Gulf 
region. In Europe, during the next hour, VOA News Now can be heard 
on WRN1 via Astra Channel 22 --
