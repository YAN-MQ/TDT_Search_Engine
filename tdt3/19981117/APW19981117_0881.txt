The Attorney-General is examining a lawmaker's call on the Portuguese 
authorities to seek the extradition of former Indonesian President 
Suharto for human rights abuses in East Timor, an official said Tuesday. 
Nuno Correia da Silva of the rightist Popular Party wrote a letter 
arguing that Suharto should be tried in Portugal for crimes allegedly 
committed in East Timor _ a former Portuguese territory that Indonesia 
invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year. ``We're looking at 
whether it's possible in Portuguese law,'' said Sara Pina, a spokeswoman 
for the Attorney-General. Human rights groups have accused Indonesian 
troops of widespread abuses in East Timor, 1,900 kilometers (1,200 
miles) east of Jakarta. As well as noting that the United Nations 
regards Portugal as the legitimate administrative power in East Timor, 
Correia da Silva argued that his bid to see Suharto extradited was 
strengthened by current attempts to extradite former Chilean dictator 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet to Spain. He said Pinochet's detention in London 
on Oct. 16, as a first step to possible extradition to Spain, had 
opened a new era in international law where, ``there are no borders 
against the law nor against the legitimacy of seeing justice done.'' 
Pina said there were differences between Portuguese and Spanish law 
which had to be analyzed. Pinochet was detained at the request of 
a Spanish judge who charges the former dictator with genocide, torture 
and terrorism committed during his 1973-1990 regime. The Spanish government 
presented a formal extradition request last week. The English High 
Court quashed the original arrest warrant against Pinochet on the 
grounds that he is immune from prosecution as a former chief of state. 
The Law Lords are currently considering an appeal. Suharto stood down 
as Indonesia's president last May after 32 years in power.
