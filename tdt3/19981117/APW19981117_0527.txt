Serbian President Milan Milutinovic pressed ahead Tuesday with efforts 
to hold peace talks with rival Kosovo Albanian officials despite their 
refusal to meet with him. Serbian government sources, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said Milutinovic will travel Wednesday to 
Kosovo's capital Pristina on a mission the ethnic Albanians have dismissed 
as a publicity stunt. Milutinovic wants to chair direct talks with 
the ethnic Albanians, with international officials in attendance but 
not as mediators. The ethnic Albanians refuse to talk without U.S. 
and European mediation, saying only foreign countries could guarantee 
that an eventual agreement would be implemented by the Serbian government. 
They have turned down 16 such invitations in the past six months, 
prompting Serb authorities to show up at the prearranged site anyway 
to try to show their sincerity and the ethnic Albanians' lack of cooperation. 
The Serbian government says the troubles in Kosovo, where hundreds 
of people have died and tens of thousands were left homeless in its 
crackdown against secessionists, are Serbia's internal matter and 
should not involve foreign mediators. Ethnic Albanian leaders said 
Milutinovic's call for talks is a part of Belgrade's effort to reduce 
international pressure on Serbia to find a peaceful solution to the 
Kosovo turmoil. They said ethnic Albanians support peace talks, but 
not under Serb conditions. U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been 
shuttling between Belgrade and Pristina to reach a compromise peace 
plan, was to meet representatives of the Albanians' rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army in the province on Tuesday, guerrilla sources said. Adem Demaci, 
a guerrilla spokesman, praised Hill's decision to meet the KLA commanders. 
``Rugova can sign anything, but there could be no deal without KLA 
consent,'' Demaci told reporters in Pristina, speaking of Kosovo Albanian 
political leader Ibrahim Rugova. Commenting on Milutinovic's scheduled 
talks, Demaci said ``it's a bluff intended to say that Albanians don't 
want dialogue and thus deserve to be beaten by force.'' The militants 
have refused any compromise with the Serbian government, demanding 
outright secession for Kosovo. Rugova also advocates independence 
but is willing to negotiate a possible three-year interim period during 
which Kosovo would regain the autonomy stripped by Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic in 1989. Serbian state-run media reported Tuesday 
that Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party gave full support to Milutinovic 
in his attempts to hold the talks. But the opposition Democratic Party 
said Milutinovic's call for talks is ``the sowing of mist'' aimed 
at fooling the public at home and abroad.
