A magistrate ordered Tuesday that Gen. Augusto Pinochet must appear 
before a court Nov. 27 if a High Court ruling awarding the former 
Chilean dictator immunity from prosecution is overturned. Pinochet, 
arrested here Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition 
to face charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping, remains under 
police guard in a London hospital after undergoing back surgery. A 
Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered or 
disappeared at the hands of secret police during his 17-year rule 
after he ousted Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in a 1973 military 
coup. A five-judge tribunal in the House of Lords, Britain's highest 
court, has not yet ruled on Spanish and British prosecutors' appeal 
of the High Court ruling awarding Pinochet immunity from prosecution 
for any crimes committed as a foreign head of state. On Tuesday, Magistrate 
Graham Parkinson also set Dec. 2 as the date by which Britain's Home 
Secretary should decide whether a Spanish extradition request can 
go ahead. Alun Jones, a lawyer representing prosecutors, said Pinochet 
is now fit enough to be discharged from Grovelands Priory, the north 
London hospital where he has been recovering from back surgery. Parkinson 
then said he wanted Pinochet to be brought to the court as soon as 
possible. ``Some people are more well-known than others,'' the judge 
said. ``That does not mean the court should treat them in a different 
way.'' Under Britain's 1989 Extradition Act, people whose extradition 
is sought usually have to appear before Bow Street Magistrate's Court 
within days. On Monday, Britain's attorney general blocked a fresh 
bid to have Pinochet tried under British law for torture and hostage-taking. 
John Morris said there was ``insufficient admissible evidence'' to 
bring criminal proceedings against the 82-year-old general. Lawyer 
Geoffrey Bindman, representing human rights groups, had presented 
Morris with fresh evidence of alleged torture and disappearances. 
France on Thursday submitted an extradition warrant for Pinochet, 
one day after a warrant arrive from Switzerland. Three French families 
have filed complaints against the former leader in France.
