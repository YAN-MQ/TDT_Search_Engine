Nearly 10,000 Indian soldiers swooped on an island on India's western 
stretch not far from Pakistan Tuesday in a land-and-sea assault, the 
largest Indian military exercise in a decade, officials said. The 
exercise, which brought together the Army, Navy, Air Force and the 
marine Coast Guards in a mighty display of military muscle, was conducted 
``somewhere on the western coast,'' domestic news agencies reported. 
Defense Ministry spokesman Swagat Ghosh confirmed Tuesday's exercises, 
but gave no details or the location of the exercises. At least 26 
ships, 26 naval aircraft, 15 Air Force jets and helicopters, a battalion 
of T-72 tanks and two submarines took part in the exercises, the United 
News of India said. India had announced in October it would hold the 
military maneuvers, including in the Thar desert bordering arch rival 
Pakistan. Islamabad was informed of the plans and ``these can't be 
called unusual or large-scale,'' Ghosh had then said. Military sources 
said the exercises would continue through December. Tuesday, a fleet 
of Sea-Harriers roared over the island, backed by Air Force Jaguars 
and Mig-21s. The air attack was followed by an amphibian commando 
assault on mock enemy territory as soldiers inched and slithered toward 
the island backed by lethal weaponry, UNI reported. Pakistan, with 
which India has fought three wars in 1948, 1965 and 1971, had said 
the maneuvers were provocative and soured the atmosphere for the peace 
talks. Officials from the two hostile South Asian neighbors held peace 
talks for the first time in a year in October and held a fresh round 
this month in New Delhi but reported little progress. The exercises 
are the biggest Indian military maneuvers since 1987, which brought 
the two countries to the brink of a fourth confrontation. Two of the 
three past conflagrations between India and Pakistan were over the 
disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir, divided between the two countries 
when the British gave South Asia its independence. International pressure 
mounted on the two neighbors to talk after they conducted nuclear 
tests in May that led to widespread international condemnation and 
economic sanctions. In the weeks after the tests, India and Pakistan 
escalated routine border clashes to heavy artillery barrages that 
killed more than 120 people on both sides of the frontier.
