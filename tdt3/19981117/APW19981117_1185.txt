French defense electronics giant Thomson CSF plans to cut 1,100 jobs 
over the next two years in its division that produces radar and jamming 
devices, news reports said Tuesday. The reductions will be taken as 
part of restructuring in France's defense sector, LCI television reported. 
Thomson CSF, in which the state has a 58-percent stake, is one of 
France's most important defense manufacturers.
