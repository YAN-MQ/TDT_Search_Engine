Smoking among American college students has increased substantially 
in recent years, a national survey of about 15,000 students by the 
Harvard School of Public Health shows. The study, which was released 
Tuesday at a news conference here and which appears in the Nov. 18 
issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, found increased 
rates of cigarette smoking among all students regardless of age, sex, 
race, type of college or region of the country. Altogether, 28 percent 
of college students said in 1997 that they had smoked in the last 
month, compared with 22 percent in a similar survey in 1993. In general, 
the authors said, cigarette smoking among college students fell in 
the 1970s and early 1980s and remained steady until 1990, when the 
rate began to increase. This reflects a 32 percent rise in smoking 
by high school students from 1991 to 1997, the authors said. They 
said they had no conclusive evidence about why more young people were 
smoking, but they suggested that it was a consequence of advertising 
aimed at them by tobacco companies. Since those in college are less 
likely to smoke than their peers who do not attend college, said one 
of the authors, Henry Wechsler, a lecturer at the School of Public 
Health, the increase among students ``signals great danger'' for the 
health of the next generation of adults. Most of the students are 
not heavy smokers, the study found. Fewer than 12 percent of the smokers 
_ only 3 percent of all the college students surveyed _ said they 
smoked a pack a day or more; 43 percent of the smokers said they did 
not smoke daily, and 45 percent said they smoked daily but less than 
a pack. Another author of the study, Dr. Nancy Rigotti, an assistant 
professor at the Harvard Medical School, said that because so many 
of the students were ``early in their cigarette-smoking habit,'' they 
would be receptive to cigarette-cessation programs at the colleges. 
The study found that African-American and Asian students were less 
likely to smoke than whites and that students at public universities 
smoked more than those at private colleges.
