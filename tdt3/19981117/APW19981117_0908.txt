Outrageous! Unthinkable! Unfair! That's what tourists are saying about 
a week-old strike by Orsay museum employees that's kept thousands 
away from one of the world's renowned collections of 19th-century 
art. ``It's totally outrageous that cashiers and guards have the power 
to completely shut down a prestigious museum like Orsay, when what's 
in there belongs to everyone,'' said Chris Halford, a 43-year-old 
computer engineer. He will return home to Birmingham, England without 
having set foot in the museum. ``At the end of the day, it's the tourists 
who are punished,'' he said. ``Why victimize the people?'' Disgruntled 
employees have demanded a one-time bonus of 1,600 francs (dlrs 280) 
to compensate for what they call ``inconveniences'' caused by huge 
crowds flocking to a temporary exhibit of works by Jean-Francois Millet 
and Vincent Van Gogh. ``I'll pay it to them right now if that will 
get me in,'' Halford said. The workers, who met last week with government 
officials without reaching an accord, say visitors are forced to wait 
in line up to three hours and often display rude and abusive behavior. 
``That's just a pretext!'' said Jeanne-Marie Malauzat, an art history 
professor shut out Tuesday, along with her American students from 
Alma, Michigan. ``Employees are just trying to cash in on the success 
of the show,'' she said. Mrs. Malauzat's students were more sympathetic 
to the strikers, applauding them for banding together to make a statement. 
``This wouldn't ever happen in the US,'' said Karima Ridgley, 21, 
from Iowa City, Iowa. ``And the French do it with such panache and 
frequency.'' Frequency is right. This fall, high school students took 
to the streets demanding more teachers and better facilities, while 
several major attractions including the Eiffel Tower and the new National 
Library also were closed by striking workers. Constant transport strikes 
affect cities all over France. Tourists at Orsay were caught by surprise 
Tuesday. The words ``En Greve'' (On Strike) were plastered over the 
main entrance in giant letters. A single sheet of white paper was 
posted, telling visitors _ in French only _ that it was ``impossible'' 
to view the show, and explaining how to get reimbursed. ``I don't 
speak French,'' said Pat Hennessy, 55, a partner at Deloitte and Touche 
from Florham Park, N. J. ``Then I saw the word `impossible,' and I 
knew it meant bad news.'' Workers are scheduled to vote Wednesday 
whether to extend their action. The strike was a costly inconvenience 
for Maryse Pradet-Simon, who came by train from her home in Lyon especially 
for the Millet-Van Gogh show. ``I booked my ticket in advance, bought 
a train ticket and took off two days from work,'' she said angrily. 
``Now what am I supposed to do?''
