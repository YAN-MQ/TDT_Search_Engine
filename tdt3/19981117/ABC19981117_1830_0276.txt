So, "on the money" tonight -- also from Washington, the federal reserve 
has done it again. For the third time in seven weeks, the discount 
rate -- which is what the central bank charges commercial banks for 
overnight loans -- was cut 0.25% to 4.5%. and the federal funds rate 
was also cut 0.25%, to 4.75%. that's the rate that commercial banks 
are allowed to charge one another for overnight loans. What does it 
mean? Here is ABC's Bob Jamieson. Analysts said the decision by chairman 
Alan Greenspan and other federal reserve policymakers was a close 
call, because the economy is still growing steadily, and unemployment 
remains low. But the fed is worried about the continuing impact of 
Asia's economic troubles -- particularly on U.S. manufacturers, which 
are selling less overseas and cutting jobs. Manufacturing has seen 
declines in its job creation over the last seven months. And they're 
operating at levels that are close to recessionary. I think the fed 
wanted to make sure that this problem didn't spread throughout the 
economy. And while the credit crunch that prevented many businesses 
from borrowing earlier in the fall has begun to ease, the rate cut 
should ensure that companies can get banks and the bond market to 
give them the money they need to expand and create new jobs. The fed 
move had little effect on the stock market. It lost almost 25 points 
for the day. But since the fed's sudden, second rate cut in October, 
the market has not only stabilized, but the Dow Jones industrial average 
has gained almost 18%. One thing today's federal reserve action is 
not likely to help is the interest rates on mortgages. There is so 
much demand now for mortgages and refinancing that those rates may 
remain unchanged. Bob Jamieson, ABC News, New York.
