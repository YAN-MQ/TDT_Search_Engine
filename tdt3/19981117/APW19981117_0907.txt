Some 4,500 Kurds rallied Tuesday to protest Italy's arrest of a Kurdish 
rebel leader who is also wanted in Germany on terrorism charges. Gathering 
in front of the Interior Ministry in Bonn, the protesters demanded 
that the European Union _ both Italy and Germany are members _ reject 
Turkey's demand to extradite Abdullah Ocalan for trial. Police said 
there were no incidents. Meanwhile, about 60 members of Germany's 
large Kurdish community said they are continuing a hunger strike in 
Bonn begun last weekend to protest Ocalan's arrest. Foreign Minister 
Joschka Fischer said Tuesday in Rome that Germany would not seek Ocalan's 
extradition.
