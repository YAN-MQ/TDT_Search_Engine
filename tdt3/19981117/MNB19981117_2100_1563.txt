Time for our weather. We go to WNBC-TV in New York, Janice huff. That 
was great video. You know that 90% of all tornadoes that occur in 
the world happen here in the United States. So, anyway, tonight we 
don't have any severe weather here, no tornadoes to speak of. Actually, 
it's relatively quiet. We see a storm system rolling out of the Rockies 
into the northern plains with some clouds and precipitation and another 
storm exiting the eastern seaboard. Now we've got snow advisories 
for the mountains in Idaho and parts of montana tonight. Had some 
heavy rain around California over the past 24 hours. 54 in San Francisco, 
46 in Seattle. Warm temperatures in south Florida. But to the north 
is where you'll find the coldest air tonight. Teens and 20's for lows, 
exing back into the rokes and the great basin. Tomorrow, 40's over 
most of the northeast and 50's in Washington, D.C., but 80 over Florida 
and south Texas. Dallas a high of 78 tomorrow with partly cloudy skies 
and Miami 86 degrees. North, showers in Minneapolis and Chicago, high 
of 59 degrees. The jet stream will shift a bit on Friday. We'll see 
windy weather across the pacific northwest. Meanwhile, the cool weather 
dips as far south as parts of the central plains. We'll see some rain 
in the northeast in places like New York City and boston and Philadelphia. 
Showers over south Florida and sunshine and warm temperatures and 
mild weather across southern California. That's the weather around 
the nation. Back to you.
