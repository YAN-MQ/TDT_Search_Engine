Figured out the answer to today's geography quiz yet? Just be glad 
it wasn't Transnestria. We're searching for a nation in southeast 
Asia, bordering Laos, Cambodia and Burma. It's now fighting a war, 
not against another nation, but against rats. And its weapon, a battalion 
of hungry snakes. The answer is Thailand, formerly known as Siam. 
Coming up, the danger posed tonight by tiny pits of space junk on
