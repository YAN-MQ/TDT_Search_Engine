Eleven-year-old Zowie Norford took about 45 seconds to defend her 
Australian boxing title on Tuesday. But it will take the controversy 
surrounding her appearance in the ring longer to die down. The schoolgirl 
from nearby Ipswich, Queensland on Tuesday danced and threw enough 
round-arm rights against 12-year-old Veronica Cameron of New South 
Wales to prompt the referee to stop the fight and award Norford her 
second consecutive Australian sub-junior 39-kilogram (86-pound) title. 
But whether she will be able to continue to follow the family sport 
in Queensland, let alone Australia, will depend upon politicians. 
Prompted by the Australian Medical Association (AMA) and Health Minister 
Wendy Edmond, Queensland Premier Peter Beattie said Monday that cabinet 
would consider a ban on boxing for those under the age of 18. Norford, 
a Grade 6 student, said the controversy surrounding her appearance 
and that of other children in the Australian Amateur Boxing League 
(AABL) titles at a Southport club was ``stupid.'' ``I should be able 
to fight. It keeps me fit,'' Norford said after the fight. Norford, 
who has been boxing for two years, comes from a long line of fighters 
_ seven uncles have been boxers. While admitting she finds its hard 
to punch up friends in the ring, Norford, who is protected by head, 
breast, groin and mouth guards and uses softer gloves during the one-minute 
rounds, said she has never been hurt in the ring. However her words 
may not be enough with New South Wales state already banning women 
in the ring and the looming threat of an Australia-wide ban for those 
under the age of 18. The AABL is the only amateur group in Australia 
which allows female boxing after breaking away from the Amateur Boxing 
Union of Australia (ABUA) 12 years ago. The ABUA refuses women or 
girls the chance to fight. (djp)
