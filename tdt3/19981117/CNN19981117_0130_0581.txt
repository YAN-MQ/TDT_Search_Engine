More help is on the way in Honduras. On Monday, Hillary Clinton discussed 
plans to double the amount of American aid to more than $250 million. 
Harris whitbeck reports, her visit also brought something else in 
short supply -- hope. Hillary Clinton arrived in Honduras to lend 
her support to the hurricane-ravaged country. She couldn't see much 
of the damage from the airports she stayed in for her two-hour visit. 
She did, however, meet with Honduran President Carlos flores, who 
gave her his firsthand account of the devastation that was visited 
upon his country. And it is very important that all of us work together 
to continue to rebuild lives and rebuild this country. Then French 
President Jacques Chirac stopped in. He did visit a destroyed neighborhood 
in the country's capital, where he posed for pictures, even signed 
an autograph. What do these high-level visits mean for the countries 
affected by hurricane Mitch? "It is good for our morale," says this 
woman, "we need our spirits raised." But the region itself has to 
raise funds. It would be best if the country's debts were pardoned. 
The interest we're paying on those loans could be invested in the 
reconstruction effort. The United States announced it would pardon 
$54 million of honduran and nicaraguan debt. The French have already 
pardoned the Honduran and nicaraguan bilateral financial obligations. 
And the United States, as have other countries, has committed hundreds 
of millions of dollars to the region-wide reconstruction effort. With 
disaster relief teams from dozens of countries working in Honduras 
and nicaragua, the first wave of international aid is starting to 
have an effect. Shelters are relatively well-supplied with food and 
medicine. International medical and engineering teams are busy repairing 
broken bodies and destroyed highways in the countryside. That is something 
visiting VIPs are proud of. The hope is that Honduras and the other 
central American countries won't be forgotten long after the visiting 
dignitaries go home. The immediate emergency might well be on its 
way to being taken care of, but the long-term effects of hurricane 
Mitch will be felt here for years. Harris whitbeck, CNN, tegucigalpa, 
Honduras.
