A senior IBM executive accused Microsoft Corp. Tuesday of imposing 
contract restrictions on software developers that prevented OS/2, 
IBM's computer operating system, from effectively competing with Microsoft 
Windows. John Soyring, director of network computing software for 
IBM Corp., took the witness stand Tuesday afternoon in the government's 
antitrust suit against Microsoft. In the early 1990s, he was in charge 
of developing OS/2. For part of that time, OS/2 was being jointly 
developed by IBM and Microsoft as a replacement for MS-DOS, the Microsoft 
operating system that preceded Windows. In written testimony, Soyring 
largely blamed Microsoft for OS/2's tiny 6 percent market share. Though 
the suit does not include complaints about Microsoft's monopoly hold 
over personal-computer operating systems, its competitive business 
practices are central to the case. Soyring testified that Microsoft 
provides certain programming tools that software developers use to 
write programs that run on Windows machines. Developers rely on those 
tools, he said, but Microsoft forbids their use in writing software 
for other operating systems. As a result, Soyring said, if a company 
wants to create a version of, say, a word processing program for OS/2 
computers, it would have to ``recreate much of the application from 
scratch,'' making it difficult to ``justify the cost of offering the 
application on OS/2.'' Microsoft, in a statement Tuesday, said, ``IBM 
made decisions with its OS/2 operating system that were not well received 
by consumers and did not make it easy for developers to make great 
applications for their platforms.'' In November 1989, when IBM and 
Microsoft were still collaborating on OS/2, they designed it to run 
only on expensive computers with more memory than was typical at the 
time. Until hardware caught up, the companies said, customers could 
use Microsoft's new product, Windows. Eventually, however, the computing 
world turned to Windows, and Microsoft ended its partnership with 
IBM. The government also played a short clip from the 20-hour deposition 
last summer of Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, in which he was 
asked about Microsoft's relationship with IBM. In an e-mail message 
last November, Gates wrote that he was unhappy with IBM because ``the 
Java religion coming out of the software group is a big problem.'' 
Java is the programming language created by Sun Microsystems that 
can be used on any operating system. As in previous parts of the deposition 
shown in court, Gates said he did not recall much about his e-mail 
message or about other topics on which he was questioned. Gates did 
volunteer that he had wanted IBM to stop criticizing Microsoft, adding 
that he had ``talked about rhetoric being lowered on both sides.'' 
Soyring _ like a previous witness, Glenn Weadock, who ended his testimony 
Tuesday _ also said IBM saw no advantage in integrating a Web browser 
with the company's operating system. ``Indeed,'' he said, ``integration 
could be inefficient and disadvantageous to customers'' because it 
could ``increase the size of the operating system and therefore the 
size of the hardware required to run it effectively.'' As Weadock 
finished his testimony earlier in the day, the government showed memorandums 
and played deposition excerpts from executives of several large corporations 
_ including Boeing, Packard Bell NEC and Gateway _ who offered similar 
sentiments. ``Generally, Gateway wants to have flexibility on anything 
associated with the Internet,'' Jim Von Holle, a Gateway executive, 
wrote in an internal company memo last April. ``We want Microsoft 
to provide us with the technology, not make decisions and choices 
for us or our customers.'' Jon Kies, a Packard Bell NEC executive, 
said in a videotaped deposition that ``it wouldn't make sense to have 
two very large programs installed'' _ Microsoft's browser and another 
that a user might choose to use instead _ ``taking up hard disk space 
and potentially confusing customers.''
