a team of American and Argentine scientists say they've discovered 
a huge dinosaur nesting site in Argentina's Patagonia desert. It contains 
thousands of fossilized eggs. In some of the eggs, the scientists 
found unhatched remains containing the first definite fossils of embryo 
skin from any dinosaur. The eggs were laid between 70 and 90 million 
years ago.
