Online retailer Amazon.com is not content with its growing share of 
the online books and music market. Today, it began selling movies 
via its Internet service. Amazon plans to cross-market videos with 
books and music, meaning it would promote a soundtrack alongside a 
hit movie. Wall Street is enthusiastic about the strategy. Amazon 
stock closed up 22 1/4 points today to 148 1/2.
