Complaints of misconduct by the office of Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr are being examined or reviewed by several government and non-government 
offices. Among them are these: _ The Justice Department has been examining 
the origins of Starr's investigation of President Clinton's relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky and is deciding whether to investigate a complaint, 
first raised by one of Ms. Lewinsky's early lawyers, that Starr's 
office improperly pressured Ms. Lewinsky into cooperating at the outset 
of the inquiry last January. _ The department has already reviewed 
and dismissed a number of accusations raised by Clinton's lawyers 
and others. It found no evidence that Starr acted unethically or withheld 
pertinent information about the timing of his initial contacts with 
witnesses, like Linda Tripp, when he asked the department to expand 
his inquiry to include the Lewinsky matter. _ An inquiry is under 
way into charges that Starr's deputies improperly disclosed federal 
grand jury information to news organizations. U.S. District Court 
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who has been been presiding over the 
federal grand jury examining the Lewinsky matter, named John Kern, 
a senior District of Columbia judge, to conduct the inquiry. _ An 
examination of whether David Hale, an important Whitewater witness, 
received payments from Clinton's political adversaries is being conducted 
by a special investigator, Michael Shaheen, a former Justice Department 
official. In addition, the District of Columbia Bar Association is 
carrying out a review of whether prosecutors on Starr's staff violated 
provisions of the ethics code of the District bar. The nature of the 
accusations has not been disclosed.
