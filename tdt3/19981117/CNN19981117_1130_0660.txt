Doctors have long known that the food you eat and how much you exercise 
can affect the health of your heart. Now researchers at the American 
heart association are finding that a Variety of environmental influences 
may affect your heart as well. For instance, if you need an excuse 
to sleep in, here's the perfect one -- "Most studies suggest heart 
attacks are more likely to occur when people wake up and start moving 
around." That's because the adrenaline surge associated with gearing 
up for the day can put a strain on your heart. The same physiological 
reaction happens after you've rested all weekend, making Monday the 
most common day of the week for a heart attack. The weather may also 
affect your health. Winter is the riskiest time for a heart attack, 
especially December and january. Experts say that's because blood 
pressure tends to go up in cold weather, which means the heart has 
to work harder.
