The lawyer for a police officer charged with attacking Abner Louima 
asked prosecutors Tuesday for details of a lawsuit in which two men 
allege that Louima had filed fraudulent claims with an insurance company. 
The men claim they were dismissed by Country-Wide Insurance Co. to 
keep them from disclosing information about Louima's claims, which 
were related to injuries from a 1994 auto accident. A lawyer for Country-Wide, 
Peter Panken, said there was ``nothing to cover up'' and that the 
investigators had been dismissed for other reasons. In a request filed 
in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, Marvyn Kornberg, who represents 
Officer Justin Volpe, asked prosecutors for the results of what he 
said had been questioning by the FBI of the two men, Eldon DeSenso, 
who had worked as an investigator for the company, and John Gonzales, 
who had supervised its investigators. Their lawsuit makes no reference 
to any such questioning. The lawsuit, filed last week in Superior 
Court in Monmouth County, N.J., quotes a company official as saying 
that Louima had tried to make some insurance claims with Country-Wide 
and that the company had disclaimed them. Alan Vinegrad, a prosecutor 
in the Volpe case, declined to comment. A lawyer for Louima, Peter 
Neufeld, did not return a phone call, but in the past he has said 
that Louima, who alleged brutal attacks while in custody of New York 
police, had received ``a few thousand dollars'' from the claim.
