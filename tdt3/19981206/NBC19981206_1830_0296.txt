And now to the space shuttle "endeavour," and construction projects 
200 mile ace bov the earth. NBC's Rick Davis is monitoring the mission. 
Chris, the shuttle astronauts are joining the first parts -- one U.S.-built 
the other Russian in what will be a massive international space station. 
This was the wake-up call for the astronauts today. Somewhere over 
the rainbow Shuttle commander Bob cabana liked the lyrics. The dreams 
that you dare to dream Well, dreams really do come true. It's going 
to be a great day. That is because the day follows a good night's 
work by mission specialist Nancy Currie. Operating a 50-foot robotic 
arm, she slowly and gently lifted this 25,000-pound chamber from the 
shuttle's cargo bay. Everybody on the crew was helping out. It just 
went great. The arm flew great. The chamber is a collection of hatches 
and docking ports that will eventually link a half a dozen space modules 
together, beginning with number one tonight. Currie, using that robotic 
arm, grabs the Russian-built zarya Module while speeding through space 
at five miles per second, 210 miles up and upside down, as astronaut 
Kent rominger explained. Once she grapples it, then she'll bring it 
over and align it and mate it at this point to the unity Module. When 
completed, the station will have 100 sections, be longer than a football 
field and twice as wide. The scientific missions are many, including 
launching journeys beyond earth's orbit. Tomorrow, the astronauts 
are scheduled to make the first of three space walks on this mission 
which is scheduled to end in nine days. Chris? NBC's Rick Davis.
