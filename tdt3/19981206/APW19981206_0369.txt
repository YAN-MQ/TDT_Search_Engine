One of two jaguars that escaped from their cage in a zoo in western 
France fatally bit and mauled a small boy, then attacked his father 
as he desperately tried to fight off the animal, officials said Sunday. 
Authorities were investigating how 3-year-old Gregoire was attacked 
Saturday afternoon at the zoo in Doue-la-Fontaine, 250 kms (150 miles) 
southwest of Paris. Police in the small town near Saumur killed one 
of the two 100-kilo (200-pound) female jaguars and captured the other, 
authorities said. The Zoo Doue was immediately shut down pending the 
investigation. ``The child didn't pass through any security zone,'' 
said state prosecutor Yves Gambert told France Info radio. The jaguar 
went after the boy ``the moment it came out of a small tunnel.'' Repeatedly 
bitten in the head, the boy died of his wounds and his father was 
hospitalized in serious condition with mostly head wounds he suffered 
while battling the jaguar. The father ``acted courageously, because 
there wasn't much he could do, and two other children were nearby,'' 
nurse Noura Oumaziz told French television LCI.
