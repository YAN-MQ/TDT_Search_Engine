The triumph of a politician not born in Taiwan in weekend elections 
shows one unwelcome cultural undercurrent has begun to disappear _ 
an ethnic divide between the island's native-born majority and those 
who arrived from mainland China half a century ago. ``The Taiwanese 
society and our voters have matured gradually,'' Ma Ying-jeou said 
after declaring victory in the Taipei mayoral race shortly before 
midnight Saturday. ``There is no longer any market for the ethnic 
issue. Any candidates trying to capitalize on the issue could only 
incite backfires,'' he said. Before voters had their say, doubts lingered 
over whether Ma, who was born to mainland immigrants but moved to 
Taiwan when he was just one-year old, could defeat a popular, native-born 
mayor in the capital city. Ma ran for the ruling Nationalist Party, 
and he carried some huge personal strengths into the campaign, a clean 
image, magnetic charm and good looks _ not to mention a successful 
background in government. But supporters of incumbent mayor Chen Shui-bian 
struck some low blows, raising questions about Ma's loyalty to Taiwan 
by branding him as a pawn in a conspiracy to sell out to China. Ma's 
party favors eventual reunification, but near the end of the campaign 
Ma said he personally would go into combat with Chinese to defend 
Taiwan, if necessary. And the ethnic attacks didn't sit well with 
many voters. ``The election was never about China,'' said one Ma supporter, 
Lee Ya-fen, who works for a construction engineering company. ``Chen 
only lost votes by raising the ethnic question.'' Ma, a former justice 
minister, captured 766,000 votes, or 51 percent. He enjoyed broad 
support among the majority native voters as well as minority mainland-born 
voters. Chen comes from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party 
that favors a formal declaration of independence from China _ a tactic 
viewed as too risky by Taiwanese who fear China might retaliate with 
a military attack. After Gen. Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists were 
ousted from mainland China by Mao Tse-tung's Communist forces in 1949, 
Chiang fled to Taiwan with about 2 million followers, mostly soldiers 
and elite members of Chinese society. During his rule, Gen. Chiang 
prohibited the Taiwanese dialect from being used in schools and offices, 
but the native culture and way of speaking have been revived in the 
past decade. Though there is little physical difference between mainland 
Chinese and their island brethren, those from the mainland have traditionally 
dominated politics, while native born Taiwanese concentrated on running 
farms or businesses. But during the last decade of democratic reforms 
carried out by President Lee Teng-hui, the mainlanders have been largely 
replaced by native Taiwanese within the government, and new tensions 
emerged. Several retired or ousted politicians have sought to establish 
ties with mainland Chinese leaders and attacked Lee and his followers 
on allegations they were covertly pushing for Taiwanese independence. 
During the campaign, Chen stayed away from demanding independence 
as he instead took aim at Ma. Newspapers said Chen's camp tried to 
spread the word among voters that ``Taiwanese don't vote for Chinese.'' 
The nasty campaign drew antagonism, especially among supporters of 
the tiny New Party who are mostly mainland immigrants or their offspring. 
Most dumped their own longshot candidate to vote for Ma, figuring 
that since they weren't going to win anyway, their best strategy was 
to get rid of Chen. Days before the poll, the president helped dissolve 
the lingering doubts over Ma's loyalty by urging voters to accept 
the mainlanders as ``New Taiwanese.'' Lee earlier had lamented about 
``the sadness of Taiwanese'' who first let Japanese and later mainlanders 
determine their fates. Taiwan had been ruled by Japan for 50 years 
as a colony before it was returned to China after World War II. Lee 
then appealed for reconciliation ``to help us walk out of the past 
shadows.''
