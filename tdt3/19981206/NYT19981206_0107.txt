NATIONAL FORECAST One more day of record maximums are expected on 
Monday from eastern New England through the Middle Atlantic States 
as balmy breezes from the southwest precede a cold front. A few sunny 
intervals along the East Coast will raise temperatures over 70 degrees 
in many locations, perhaps eclipsing monthly records set during the 
past few days. A robust high pressure system over the Southwest Atlantic 
will only slowly yield to clouds and scattered showers. More record 
highs are expected along the Southeast coast as temperatures rise 
more than 20 degrees above normal. The leading edge of more seasonable 
air will push to the crest of the Appalachians by afternoon. However, 
a small disturbance developing over northern Kentucky will cause the 
front to temporarily stall just east of the Great Lakes. It will also 
produce a swath of showers and embedded thunderstorms from West Virginia 
to eastern Tennessee. As colder air seeps southeastward across the 
central Lakes, a few snow showers will form over Michigan. A large 
ridge of high pressure stretching from Nevada to Lake Superior will 
sponsor dry and seasonably cold weather over much of the central and 
western United States. Light snow and flurries will attend a disturbance 
as it weakens over New Mexico and the Texas panhandle. Gusty winds 
will enhance the chilly air in the deserts of the Southwest. Rain 
and gales will return to the Northwest Coast with snow spreading into 
the Cascades as a cold front moves onshore. It will stay rather cold 
across the interior. FOCUS: See-Saw Jet Like a giant see-saw, the 
jet stream tipped even further on Saturday with all-time December 
warmth reaching into the Middle West while a deepening chill in the 
Far West brought snow to low elevations of California. Two inches 
of snow accumulated in Redding in the northern Sacramento Valley. 
Even Daggett, in the Mojave desert, had a sloppy mixture of rain and 
snow. Meanwhile, record maximums were being eclipsed at the stroke 
of midnight in the East with exceptional nocturnal warmth across the 
Great Lakes. The jet stream will straighten out some this week leading 
to more seasonable conditions.
