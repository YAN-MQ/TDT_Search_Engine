Thanks to an economic boom in the last few years, Ireland is the 19th 
richest country in the world, with the fastest growth rate of any 
European Union nation. Immigration by people looking for work here 
now exceeds the perennial emigration to Britain and America. The average 
annual pay has risen to about $24,000, and the government announced 
late last month that it had taken in a record $1.4 billion in revenue 
in 1998, and expected the upward trend to continue next year. But 
the gap between the poor, estimated at 20 percent of the population 
of 3.6 million, and the well-to-do is apparently widening. And there 
is a growing feeling in the grubby public housing projects, especially 
in Dublin, that the Celtic Tiger, as the boom is widely known, is 
the same old fat cat that ignores them. The educated professionals 
and middle-class administrative and technical workers are thriving, 
cramming the streets of Dublin with thousands of new cars, and their 
prosperity has pushed up the cost of housing by about 100 percent. 
But that only makes life more bleak for people like Helen Delaney, 
48, a single mother of six children who has lived for 20 years in 
the Ballymun high-rise public housing complex on the northern edge 
of the capital. ``If I found the Celtic Tiger, I'd take him down to 
the Dublin Corporation office and get them off their backsides, up 
here to do what they're supposed to be doing _ fixing my flat,'' she 
said recently. The poverty and resentment of Ballymun, where 20,000 
people live, received brief attention in the outside world in the 
1991 film, ``The Commitments.'' National unemployment has fallen from 
20 percent, when the film was released, to about 8 percent, well below 
the European Union average. But in Ballymun and other poor areas of 
Dublin, like the Docklands, unemployment averages about 40 percent. 
And there are pockets where 90 percent of the people are out of work, 
many of them for several years. They survive on welfare payments, 
called the dole, averaging a little less than half the average wage 
for a family of four. The official poverty line, based on European 
Union criteria, is half the national average. ``People on the dole 
don't think about the Celtic Tiger as relevant to their future,'' 
said James Hargis, manager of an employment training program in the 
Docklands, near the River Liffey. ``They find that the social welfare 
people are chasing them more,'' he added, to see if they are taking 
welfare payments and at the same time have found jobs in the underground 
or ``black'' economy. ``We have Trinity College literally on our doorstep,'' 
he said, but ``very few people in the Docklands would ever get there.'' 
One of the main problems that keeps people here from profiting from 
the boom is that about 40 percent of men over 35 are functionally 
illiterate, descendants of dock workers whose jobs disappeared 25 
years ago with the arrival of huge container ships. Some of the Trinity 
students help tutor children from the area through the St. Andrew's 
Resource Center, operated with government and private funds. The center 
finds work for about 200 people a year, mostly women, who are more 
open to training programs than the men, many of whom are ashamed to 
admit they cannot read a newspaper. Brendan Walsh, an economics professor 
at University College Dublin, does not take an entirely pessimistic 
view. ``It's not as if the Celtic Tiger zoomed ahead and left the 
elderly, the unemployed, the disabled and single parents without support,'' 
he said. ``Support has increased with inflation.'' Welfare payments 
have risen, he said, though they have not matched the level of increased 
national income. ``Like many developed or booming economies,'' he 
said, ``the gap between the rich and the poor has widened. If you 
are a pessimist, you can say that's terrible. If you are an optimist 
you can say everyone has drifted up a little.'' He noted that because 
there is a cash-producing boom, there is more begging on the streets 
of Dublin, some of it by immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe 
and Africa. A little is not enough for the Rev. Sean Healy, director 
of the Conference of Religious of Ireland, a gadfly group that prods 
the government of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to increase welfare 
payments and expand employment programs. Healy, a former missionary 
in Africa who has a doctorate in sociology from Fordham University, 
wants Ireland to become the first country in Europe to establish a 
guaranteed annual income for all citizens _ at an amount above the 
average public assistance level. He concedes that this is unlikely, 
but he noted that Ahern, who has been prime minister for 18 months, 
has recently begun to acknowledge ``poverty and social exclusion'' 
in his public speeches, and promises to do more to eliminate them. 
He noted that traditional Irish ``begrudgery,'' a widely acknowledged 
national trait of resenting the success or good luck of a neighbor, 
may be part of what makes people with jobs unwilling to give more 
help to the unemployed. ``Begrudgery is beatable,'' he said. ``From 
the point of view of Christian teaching, everybody is their brother's 
keeper.'' His optimism is not in evidence at the Ballymun public housing 
project, though. In the 15-story housing towers, the corridors reek 
of urine and the elevators are often out of order. There are scores 
of heroin addicts, and the principal amusement of many children is 
riding and caring for the often scrawny horses that have long roamed 
the grounds, to the dismay of city officials and animal rights groups. 
The government has said that it hopes, in the next several years, 
to do what some American cities have done with high-rise projects 
_ tear them down and replace them with low-rise housing more conducive 
to family life. Ms. Delaney, the mother of six children, who lives 
on the fifth floor, said: ``When the lifts are broken I have to take 
my young one out of school because I can go down the stairs with her, 
but I can't come back up. She really needs to be in school at this 
stage, since she's only starting. If I keep her out of school now 
she'll think, `Great! The lifts in Ballymun let me stay home.''' She 
said the economic boom has only made things harder for Ballymun residents 
and has made it even more difficult to contemplate moving to private 
housing. Large food store chains have beaten out smaller supermarkets, 
reducing competition, and food prices have gone up. And a private 
house in the neighborhood that might have cost $30,000 before the 
boom is now worth $200,000, putting escape from public housing even 
farther out of the residents' reach. Jackie Lee, 35, an unemployed 
hairdresser who runs a child care program at the community center 
in Ballymun, said she was still looking for an outside job, but the 
project has become a symbol for poverty and crime in Ireland. ``If 
you're from Ballymun you won't even get a reply,'' she said. Ms. Lee 
contends that many of the people in Ballymun have the skills and education 
to take advantage of the economic boom if it were not for the bias 
against them. ``It's like that film, `Escape From New York,' where 
they made New York a prison,'' she said. ``That's what Ballymun is 
like _ just dump everybody out there that has any problems. Don't 
worry about the people who want to do anything about themselves.'' 
She said that unemployment becomes an accepted way of life at Ballymun. 
Her father, once a roofing contractor, was unemployed for years. ``It 
was very depressing because you've lost your role model,'' she said. 
``There's a 10-year age gap between me and my younger brother and 
sister. I've always worked, but my sister is unemployed, and they 
don't want to work, because for them Dad never worked.'' She said 
she would stay at Ballymun, though, waiting for the government to 
fulfill its promise to tear down the high rises and put people in 
new houses. But, she added, ``It's terrible to have to turn to your 
child and say, `No, you can't have that doll, it's 50 pounds''' _ 
about $75 _ ```and I can't afford it.' I take her into town to show 
her all the toys in the shops and it breaks her heart.''
