The crew of the space shuttle "endeavour" are preparing for the most 
challenging part of their 11-day mission. They will try to attach 
the first U.S. piece of the international space station called unity 
to a Russian Module launched into space last month. Astronaut Nancy 
Curry will use a robot arm to attach the two parts without a direct 
line of sight and will only use a computerized system to align them. 
It is so tricky that NASA has given them extra time on their schedule. 
She used it yesterday to move it into position for today's assembly.
