An Ariane rocket placed a Mexican telecommunications satellite into 
orbit overnight, after a 24-hour delay due to a technical glitch with 
the SATMEX 5, officials with the European Space Agency said Sunday. 
The launch from Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, on the northern 
edge of South America, took place at 9:43 p.m. Saturday (0043 GMT 
Sunday), officials said. It was the 114th launch of an Ariane 4 and 
the 10th of the year, and it was the first time the rocket was using 
a more-efficient fuel system for the third stage. SATMEX 5, built 
by U.S.-based Hughes Space and Communications, is the third Mexican 
telecommunications satellite placed in orbit by Ariane. It was placed 
in orbit over the Pacific to support TV and telephone relays for the 
next 15 years. The next Ariane 4 launch is slated for Dec. 21, carrying 
a U.S. Panamsat. Arianespace, the European Space Agency's commercial 
arm, also plans next year to begin using its new Ariane 5, after a 
successful test launch in October. Twice as powerful as the Ariane 
4, it is to gradually replace Arianespace's workhorse in an effort 
to maintain the company's lead in the world's commercial launch market. 
The first Ariane 5 crashed in June 1996 and a launch a year ago was 
less than perfect, making October's final test launch critical.
