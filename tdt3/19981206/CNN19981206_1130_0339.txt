A man prosecutors say tried to avoid paying child support by injecting 
his son with HIV-Tainted blood has been found guilty of first-degree 
assault. Brian Stewart's 7-year-old son has AIDS. Prosecutors say 
Stewart stole HIV-infected blood from the hospital where he worked 
in 1992 and injected it into his son. Jurors deliberated for eight 
hours yesterday before returning a guilty verdict and recommending 
life in prison for Stewart. Sentencing is set for January 8th. Stewart 
is expected to appeal.
