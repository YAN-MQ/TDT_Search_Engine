tnchts globalized economies of many nations have produced both winners 
and losers. They used to be called Asian economic miracles. Just as 
the rest of the world decided to embrace the global openness it believed 
brought prosperity to Asia, those same Asian economies collapsed. 
Incomes fell, governments tumbled. The world is still trying to understand 
precisely what went wrong. This globallization model guarantees massive 
ams of poverty, hunger, environmental degradation and a certain point 
where people see their families facing no future. It is going to be 
settled in the streets. When international worries about money, the 
investors move their money. Healthy economies make a stampede for 
it. In the case of Latin America, many economies like Argentina, chile 
and Brazil have followed the correct policies, but they were unfairly 
hit when the markets panicked. Major world leaders today are sold 
on globallization and Bill clinton in the United States to many in 
Europe, Asia and the rest of the developing world. Globallization, 
these leaders say, still benefited even suffering Asian nations. Incomes 
in Indonesia and Korea are falling right now, but the fact of the 
matter is, over the 20 years up to 1997, they grew much faster in 
those countries than they did in the rich countries. In rich countries 
and poor, the debate is growing. In recent full page ad in the New 
York Times lists scores of environmentalists and labor leaders around 
the world who believe globalism strengthens corporations at the expense 
of the environment, human rights and average individuals. The losers 
are most of us. The vast majority of people whose livelihoods, food 
security and safety, whose cultures, whose very laws and traditions 
are to be smashed down by this one system. Yet many mainstream economists 
are unpersuaded by the arguments conceding the international economy 
may need some safe guards. The one point on which both sides agree 
is that economic globallization can bring painful swings to local 
economies. Governments may need to figure out how to dampen them.
