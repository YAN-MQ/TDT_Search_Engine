Supporters of a jailed Malaysian opposition figure gathered Sunday 
outside a prison after they were refused entry to wish the political 
dissident a happy birthday, a local report said. The wellwishers carried 
balloons and placards in front of the jail where Lim Guan Eng, deputy 
secretary-general of the Democratic Action Party, has been held, the 
state-run Bernama news agency reported. Lim is serving an 18-month 
jail sentence after having been found guilty of violating Malaysia's 
Seditious Act and Publications and Printing Presses Act. He is the 
son of Lim Kit Siang, who is the opposition leader in the Southeast 
Asian nation's Parliament, and secretary-general of the Democratic 
Action Party. Prison officials would not allow Lim's supporters to 
meet with him, citing regulations limiting visitors to family members 
and lawyers. Officials initially refused even to pass gifts or messages 
on to Lim, but eventually relented by allowing prison guards to deliver 
a birthday card to the prisoner.
