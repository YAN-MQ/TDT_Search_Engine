NBC's John Palmer is on duty at the White House tonight. Good evening, 
John. What do we know about the White House witness list? We know 
that among the first witnesses, a constitutional and legal scholars 
from Princeton and Yale, they will be making the point that even if 
you believe the charges against the president, they do not measure 
up. They don't rise to the point of an impeachable offense. The audience 
won't be the Judiciary committee the White House has given up on that. 
The audience will be the house,? General, in particular moderate republicans. 
And of course the public at large. And also the witnesses will make 
the point that this whole process has been unfair. How much concern 
is there at the White House about the possibility of impeachment? 
There's a lot of concern here. One official told me late this afternoon 
there's a real possibility that just ten days from now, the president 
of the United States could be impeached by the full house. They're 
very concerned that the members will not be able to vote on the censure 
issue, only an impeachment. They're worried that that means the moderate 
republicans will stay away from them. They say that's pretty much 
like asking a jury to just vote either for the death fenlt or for 
no penalty at all. NBC's John Palmer at the White House. Thank you. 
Thank you.
