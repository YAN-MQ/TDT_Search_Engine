The commander of the shuttle "endeavour" says his crew is off "to 
a great start" in constructing the international space station. In 
about 15 minutes, the astronauts are scheduled to fire the shuttle's 
engine to move it closer to a Russian Module. In about 2 1/2 hours, 
they will use the robot arm to join an American module to it. Tony 
Clark has more on the procedure. With the unity Module now firmly 
in place in the shuttle's payload bay, "endeavour" is speeding toward 
a Sunday afternoon rendezvous with the Russian-built zarya Module. 
"Endeavour" will pass 600 feet directly underneath it. Then, commander 
Bob cabana will fly a half circle around zarya and slowly close in. 
When "endeavour" and zarya are about ten feet apart, astronaut Nancy 
Currie will grapple it with the robot arm, and bring zarya within 
inches of the unity Module in the payload bay. The shuttle will then 
fire a jet to dock the two space station modules. Houston, "endeavour." 
Unity is coming out of the payload bay. Saturday, the 12.8-ton unity 
Module was gently lifted out of its berth in the payload bay, with 
only an inch of clearance on each side to spare. Beautiful and delicate 
work so far. It's a pleasure to watch. Yeah, Nancy's a real pro. Unity 
is designed as a connecting Module for the space station. It has six 
attachment ports to which future modules will be connected. It took 
more than an hour to lift unity and stand the 36-foot-long Module 
perpendicular in the payload bay. We've got unity firmly attached 
to "endeavour," and we're off to a great start on building the international 
space station. Once the two modules have been joined, astronauts Jerry 
Ross and jim Newman will perform three six-hour spacewalks to connect 
cables between the units and install equipment. If all goes according 
to schedule, there will be five more assembly flights next year alone. 
And by January 2000, the first three-member international crew will 
begin living and working on the space station. Tony Clark, CNN, Johnson
