Good evening. It has only happened twice before, Congress considering 
the impeachment of a president. For President Clinton a lifetime in 
politics could hinge on what happens this week. His lawyers have been 
granted 30 hours to present a defense. Then the Judiciary committee 
will vote on articles of impeachment. Joe Johns has the latest from 
Capitol Hill. Setting the stage for historic drama in this hearing 
room, the house Judiciary committee granted the White House request 
for extra time to defend itself. But, in their letter, committee republicans 
strictly limited the time -- long hours. The letter also raised concern 
that "recent maneuvers by the White House may be little more than 
an attempt to delay the committee." The plan is for a vote by the 
end of this week on any or all of the articles of impeachment. Among 
the possible charges -- but which of those possibilities actually 
gets voted on is still being debated. I think the evidence amassed 
by the independent counsel presents a very clear case of lying under 
oath on multiple -- in multiple instances, by the president of the 
United States, as well as instances of obstruction of justice. And 
there is still disagreement among republicans over what will happen 
if the Judiciary committee does vote to send articles of impeachment 
to the full house. The committee's top democrat today accused congressman 
Tom DeLay, the top vote counter in the house, of twisting arms to 
shore up support. DeLay doesn't count by going knocking on your door, 
by saying "would you fill in one of these boxes and send it back to 
me?" He goes in there with what? The hammer. Mr. conjure Conyers ought 
to look within themselves. They're putting a lot of pressure on their 
members. We have not talked to any member and urged any member to 
vote one way or the other. Many democrats and a handful of republicans 
continue to discuss a Censure option for the president. But that faces 
stiff opposition. But noon tomorrow the house must tell the house 
Judiciary committee what witnesses it plans to call at the hearings. 
Joe Johns, NBC news, the capitol.
