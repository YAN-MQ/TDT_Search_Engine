The house Judiciary committee will give President Clinton's lawyers 
two days to explain why he shouldn't be impeached. The committee's 
chief of staff says the team will be given 30 hours from 9:00 A.M. 
to midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the Sunday morning talk shows 
republicans and democrats weighed in on how the hearings are going 
and where it should go next. I've looked at the constitution backward 
and forward, and I've looked at the history of censure, and I don't 
think it's used -- been used often or effectively and would be a problem, 
probably, for the future. But I think there should be a trial if there 
are articles of impeachment. After that, you know, we'll just have 
to see. This thing is clinical now, Mr. russert. It's psychopathic. 
People want partisanship blood, and I'm trying to explain to my few 
republican friends that you're digging a deeper grave. You can't tear 
November 3rd off your calendar now from last month. It was real. Ask 
Newt Gingrich.
