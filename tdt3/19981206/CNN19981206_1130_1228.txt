Underdogs undo the second two. I'm Anthony Keith James, and this is 
"CNN Headline Sports." So who is going to play for the national title? 
We won't know until the final bcs poll comes out later today. Only 
one half of the fiesta bowl is certain. Top-ranked Tennessee assured 
itself of a berth by holding off Mississippi state 24-14 in in S.E.C. 
championship. Tee Martin hit peerless price on a 41-yard td pass for 
the go-ahead score. Martin finishing 15 of 32 for 208 yards. We're 
a team that's fought. We had to fight for everything we got this year. 
And nobody gave us the respect at the beginning of the year. So we 
knew as a team that to get the job done, week in and week out, like 
coach Wilkins said, "we ain't got to be the best team in the country, 
'cause those guys they pick you to be, but be the best team every 
Saturday. UCLA may have seen its national title hopes wave bye-bye 
as the bruins lost a shootout to Miami, 49-45. James scored three 
TDs for the hurricane, including the winning score in the final minute. 
Cade McNown had a career day. He flew for a school-record 513 yards 
and 5 TDs. Texas A&M stunning previously undefeated Kansas state and 
ruining the wildcats' national title hopes with a 36-33 win in double 
overtime in the big 12 title game. Parker caught a 32-yard td pass 
in double O.T. to rally the aggies, who trailed by 15 points. So now 
the nation plays the waiting game.
