Finally tonight -- police are standing guard around the main Buddhist 
temple in Seoul, south Korea, where rival monks have been fighting 
it out like the hatfields and McCoys. ABC's Mark Litke is there. This 
is how we usually picture Buddhist monks -- spiritual, enlightened, 
nonviolent. But this is how they are carrying on in south Korea these 
days. Over the past month, several hundred monks from two rival factions 
have been battling for control of a 1,000-year-old temple right in 
the heart of seoul, each group contending they are the rightful leaders 
of Korea's largest sect, and using anything, from 2 x 4s to fire hoses, 
to stake their claim. All of this, of course, has nothing to do with 
spirituality or the path to enlightenment that's at the core of Buddhist 
religion. This is all about power and money. Whoever controls south 
Korea's largest Buddhist order controls a massive fortune built on 
donations, property and lucrative tax breaks -- so much money that 
gangsters have been gravitating to the religion for years to share 
in the spoils. Violence and corruption have become so commonplace, 
worshipers now fear that 12 centuries of Buddhism here is being jeopardized 
by naked greed. They are shocked, disgusted, and they simply think 
that something should be done to reform the religion. Today there 
was relative calm between the warring factions, but it took an army 
of police to keep them apart, and few expect the peace to last. In 
Buddhist terms, it just may be their karma to keep on battling, making 
it ever more difficult for ordinary worshipers to keep the faith. 
"With the example you monks are setting," she shouts, "how do you 
expect anyone to believe in Buddhism?" Mark Litke, ABC News, Seoul. 
Amazing.
