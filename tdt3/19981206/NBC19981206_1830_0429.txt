When "NBC nightly news" continues in a moment -- the U.N.'s frustration 
after the unsuccessful effort to bring suspected terrorists to trial. 
And later in "focus" -- the things they are doing to protect the priceless. 
I love being out in the sun. It makes me feel so alive. Now I really 
enjoy being outdoors because I've discovered this new lotion... that's 
been awarded the skin cancer foundation seal, designed for women our 
age. This SPF 15 formula with intense vitamin-enriched moisture... 
helps protect maturing skin from future U.V. damage. It minimizes, 
even helps prevent, age spots. And the name? Provital protective moisture 
lotion from oil of Olay. Proven to help you look revitalized.
