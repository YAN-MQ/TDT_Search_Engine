As resistance to a proposed stadium deal budded among Connecticut 
lawmakers this weekend, Gov. John Rowland and the New England Patriots 
signaled for the first time that they were willing to make changes 
in a plan to bring the team to Hartford that had been presented to 
lawmakers as a take-it-or-leave-it deal. In a concession to critics, 
the governor said he would add a requirement that the Patriots pay 
cash for the stadium if they left Hartford before the end of a proposed 
30-year lease, and the team said it would accept. Lawmakers had begun 
to bridle at the many incentives in the tentative agreement the governor 
signed last month with the Patriots' owner, Robert Kraft. The governor 
said he recognized that he had to reassure legislators as they begin 
debating the deal on Wednesday, and he said he would start by adding 
a requirement that the Patriots stay for the full 30 years or else 
pay off the debt the state would incur to build the stadium. The estimated 
cost of the stadium would be $375 million. ``If the Patriots were 
to leave after 15 years, their payback would be literally the rest 
of the bonds, which may be $100, $150, $200 million,'' Rowland said 
in an interview after a banquet Saturday night. ``We'll basically 
have language that says if you leave early, you have to pay off the 
balance. That's pretty devastating.'' Andy Wasynczuk, the Patriots' 
vice president for business operations, said the National Football 
League team was willing to accept such a provision and did not consider 
it a change in the agreement. ``It's appropriate because the state 
needs protection, and our intention is to be there for 30 years or 
beyond,'' Wasynczuk said. He suggested separately that legislators 
should not get the idea that they could start rewriting the deal that 
the Governor and Kraft signed. ``In our minds, we are in an education 
process to be sure everybody understands the deal,'' Wasynczuk said. 
``We've gone through the negotiation phase already.'' Rowland, a Republican, 
secured the support of the leaders of the House and Senate, both of 
which are controlled by Democrats, before announcing the deal, and 
the leaders had indicated that they would not allow rank-and-file 
members to tinker with the agreement, since any change would give 
Kraft license to back out. ``If you have an amendment that materially 
changes the deal, that's like voting no,'' the House speaker, Thomas 
Ritter, said last week. The governor and the team seem likely to face 
pressure to adjust the terms, however. A dozen lawmakers from throughout 
the state said calls from constituents were running heavily against 
the deal with the Patriots, and several legislators spent the weekend 
trying to convince their colleagues that the proposal would prove 
costly to the state. ``There seems to be a lot of unraveling happening,'' 
said Rep. Louis P. Esposito Jr., a West Haven Democrat. ``I think 
this was thrown together, and if people really looked at what it will 
mean in the long run, they would be calling up screaming.'' Rep. Demetrios 
Giannaros, a Democrat who is an economics professor at the University 
of Hartford, said he had talked to 15 to 20 of his colleagues across 
the ideological spectrum and described them as very skeptical. ``The 
information that we have is limited, insufficient and questionable,'' 
he said. ``I don't think any of us has a problem with the Patriots 
coming to town, but we have to ask if this is really a good investment, 
given the alternative investments we could be making in education 
or in returning the money to taxpayers.'' The most widely questioned 
provision is a guarantee that the state will pay the Patriots up to 
$17.5 million a year if luxury suites and seats are not sold. Rowland 
said it might be possible to ``tighten'' that guarantee, but he said 
he believed he would be able to allay lawmakers' fears by demonstrating 
that demand is strong. He said the state or the team had commitments 
for about 80 of the 150 luxury boxes.
