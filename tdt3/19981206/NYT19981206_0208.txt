A quarterback sneak! For all of pro football's modern complexities, 
and on a day when the air was filled with passes, something as elementary 
as a schoolyard play may have pushed the New York Jets into a magical 
season. Vinny Testaverde recalled that when he was a kid growing up 
on Long Island, playing football in sandlots, the mark of being the 
best athlete was to be the quarterback and call your own plays. As 
football became more sophisticated, and defensive players became bigger, 
the quarterback sneak was gradually abandoned. Used only when needed. 
But with 27 seconds left Sunday, with the Jets facing fourth-and-goal 
at the 5-yard line, trailing the Seattle Seahawks by 31-26, Testaverde 
walked over to coach Bill Parcells with his assessment of the situation: 
The Seahawks' middle seemed soft. The defense, preoccupied with slant 
passes to Keyshawn Johnson, was loosening up. The play Testaverde 
wanted would give him two options: He could run, or, if the defense 
bunched up in the ``box'' a 5-yard area between the defensive tackles 
extending back to the linebackers, he would fire another slant pass 
to Keyshawn Johnson or Leon Johnson. Testaverde said: ``I told him, 
`I think we should run this play. I think I can make it if it's the 
run; and if it's the pass, you got a couple of your best receivers 
out there.' ``The pass we were going with had worked all day,'' he 
added, referring to slant passes to Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet. 
``Odds were in our favor.'' In the third quarter, with the Jets facing 
a third and 9, Testaverde rumbled for a crucial first down. He didn't 
slide; he rumbled and forced the defensive back to wrestle him down. 
``It was going to take everybody contributing on every play,'' Testaverde 
said. ``I just wanted to keep the drive alive.'' But with 27 seconds 
left, the game _ and possibly the season _ was on the line. So the 
Jets came out in spread formation with five receivers. Seattle took 
one look at the Jets' formation, looked at Curtis Martin on the Jets' 
sideline, and the defense thought pass. Prepared for pass. Testaverde 
had thrown a career-high 63 passes Sunday, and had completed a career-high 
42. Surely this would be attempt No. 64. The Seahawks doubled Keyshawn 
Johnson, one defender playing him for an inside route, the other for 
an outside route. The defense saw the Jets and thought pass. Testaverde 
saw the defense and flashed run. All he saw was an empty middle and 
an end zone beckoning. So like the kid on the playground, he called 
his own number. ``I followed Kevin Mawae right to the end zone,'' 
he said. Although the ball may not have broken the plane of the goal 
line, Testaverde scored in the officials' eyes. Defensive back Jay 
Bellamy said the Seahawks' defense hadn't been fooled. ``How can you 
be surprised if you stopped something?'' he said. ``We stopped it.'' 
Martin said he couldn't tell. ``To be honest,'' he said, ``we were 
all down on the sideline, eyes closed, praying.'' Testaverde's touchdown 
salvaged what had been an odd day for Parcells. There are calls that 
make coaches look like Lombardi on one series and Kotite the next. 
Parcells visited both worlds on Sunday. On third-and-goal in the first 
half, he sent Ray Lucas in for Testaverde at quarterback and moved 
Testaverde to the slot. Lucas hadn't played a serious down at quarterback 
since last December in a crucial, season-ending game at Detroit. On 
Sunday, the play failed. In the fourth quarter, down by 31-26, the 
Jets faced fourth-and-9 at the Seattle 20-yard line. Parcells elected 
to go for it rather than to take a field goal. ``The way our defense 
was playing, I wasn't sure whether I'd get the ball back,'' Parcells 
explained. When someone argued that the defense wasn't playing that 
poorly at that juncture of the game, Parcells bristled. ``How many 
points did they score?'' he said. ``Thirty-one. You call that playing 
well? Why don't you come here and tell everybody how the team's playing?'' 
The coach said that he wasn't trying to be a wise guy. ``This was 
a hard-fought game,'' he said. ``I'm quite emotional. We make decisions 
under pressure. It doesn't always turn out right. Sometimes you roll 
the dice: Sometimes they come up 2s and 3s or 12s; other times they 
come up 7 or 11. I feel sorry for the guys in the Seattle locker room. 
I've been there.'' On Sunday, a quarterback's athletic play made it 
all turn out right for the Jets. Are the Jets lucky or are the Jets 
blessed? The answers were mixed. ``I'm not a luck person,'' Martin 
said. ``I believe that all things happen for a reason. I do believe 
that things went our way today.'' From Parcells' perspective, the 
Jets are blessed with good luck. ``God's playing in some of these 
games,'' he said. ``And He was on our side today.''
