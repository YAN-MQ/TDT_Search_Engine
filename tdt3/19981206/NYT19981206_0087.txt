Years ago, when his media empire consisted of little more than an 
Atlanta television station, Ted Turner was so widely considered a 
self-promoting parvenu that critics called him the Mouth of the South. 
So when Turner, now vice chairman of Time Warner Inc., announced late 
last year that he planned to donate $1 billion to the United Nations 
over the next decade, many wondered if the philanthropic gesture would 
turn out to be all talk. By Turner's own calculus, the contribution 
was to come in annual gifts of $100 million for 10 years. And as 1998 
nears its end, he concedes that his contribution so far _ $75 million 
in the form of roughly 1 million shares of Time Warner stock _ has 
fallen a bit short of the target. But he said in a telephone interview 
last week that setting up the money pipeline had taken longer than 
expected, and that now that it was in place, he planned to increase 
the flow rate and make up the difference by the end of next year. 
Certainly, the United Nations is not complaining, having already committed 
$55 million from Turner's largess to projects that include fighting 
polio around the world and helping to keep HIV-infected pregnant women 
from transmitting the AIDS virus to their unborn children. ``We announced 
our first round of grants in May and the second in September,'' said 
Jennifer Lee DeLaurentis, head of the U.N. office overseeing the gifts. 
``We are very pleased with the volume and quality of projects approved 
thus far.'' Turner, 60, has become increasingly active as a philanthropist 
in recent years. ``Everybody gives,'' he said, ``except Rupert and 
Sumner.'' He was referring, half in jest, to two titans of the media 
industry, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., and Sumner Redstone, 
chairman of Viacom Inc. Redstone declined to comment. A Murdoch family 
spokesman said the Murdochs regularly donated to all sorts of charities. 
The Turner U.N. gifts are administered by the U.N. Foundation, which 
Turner set up after announcing his plan in September 1997. Taylor 
Glover, Turner's financial adviser, said that it had been fairly complicated 
to start giving away the money. Not only did Turner have to set up 
the new foundation, but the United Nations itself created an entity, 
the U.N. International Partnership Trust Fund, to receive the gifts. 
The two foundations were not in place until last February. David Harwood, 
chief of staff of the U.N. Foundation, said that he, like Turner, 
expected the rate of giving to accelerate in the coming year. And 
Glover noted that Turner already had placed an additional 1.6 million 
shares of Time Warner stock, worth roughly $100 million, into a charitable 
remainder trust, which can be used as needed in coming years to meet 
the foundation's U.N. obligation. Meanwhile, Turner can receive income 
from the trust. Already, both the foundation and the trust fund have 
sold their Time Warner shares to lock in gains in the stock's price, 
which has risen 67.8 percent this year. By the same token, since Turner 
announced his intention to give to the United Nations, his ability 
to do so has sharply increased. In September 1997, his 58 million 
shares of Time Warner stock were trading at $55.375 each, giving him 
a net worth of $3.2 billion. Although he now has 54 million shares, 
their value is about $5.72 billion. The stock closed Friday at $106.06 
The U.N. Foundation remains separate from the Turner Foundation, which 
is based in Atlanta and run by Turner; his wife, Jane Fonda, and Turner's 
five children. That foundation gave away $26 million this year. Turner 
also gave Ms. Fonda $10 million to establish a foundation of her own.
