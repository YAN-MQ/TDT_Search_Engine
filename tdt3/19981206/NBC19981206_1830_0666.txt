In the western U.S. today, there was some very strange weather. South 
of Los Angeles, people are cleaning up after tornado-like winds roared 
through the area overnight. They toppled trees and power lines, leaving 
40,000 people across greater los Angeles without power. And this shopping 
mall is in, of all places, Las Vegas. About two inches of snow fell 
around the city and suburbs today. It hasn't snowed that much in December 
since 1967.
