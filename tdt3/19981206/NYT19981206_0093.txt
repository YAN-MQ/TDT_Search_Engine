Fans who decry the creeping commercialization of sports, who moan 
when they hear that the Micron PC Bowl will take place at Pro Player 
Stadium, who shake their heads at brand logos on uniforms have another 
reason to rant: a new men's basketball league has sold team-naming 
rights to a company. The Collegiate Professional Basketball League, 
which plans to begin play in November 1999 with eight teams in the 
Northeast and Midwest, signed a three-year agreement with Lycos Inc., 
operator of a popular Internet search engine (www.lycos.com), to sponsor 
a team in Boston. The name says it all: Team Lycos. The league describes 
itself as the first professional American sports league that will 
have all its teams named after corporate sponsors. Heck, the league 
is even willing to name itself after a company if one wants to buy 
those rights. ``Consumers are becoming used to the idea that entertainment 
is underwritten by sponsors, and sponsors put their names on things,'' 
said Paul McMann, president of the league in Lexington, Mass. ``Part 
of our mission is being in the advertising business,'' he added. ``We've 
always assumed that the CPBL will not make its money at the gate, 
but from delivering eyeballs to advertisers who want to get their 
messages in front of fans.'' The naming rights to a second league 
team, in Chicago, will be sold soon, McMann said. The Lycos deal is 
worth about $1.2 million in cash and services to the league. Lycos 
will help build a Web site (www.cpbl.com), provide banner advertising 
and enable fans to send e-mail and buy merchandise on line. The agreement 
is emblematic of the growing presence of interactive advertisers in 
mainstream marketing. The team naming comes after Lycos began running 
its first national brand advertising, created by Bozell Worldwide 
in New York, a unit of True North Communications. The campaign includes 
commercials likening the Web-searching abilities of Lycos to a Labrador 
retriever. ``We know the power of having your name associated with 
a team,'' said Jim Hoenscheid, promotion director at Lycos in Waltham, 
Mass. ``We've had a tremendous amount of success with building brand 
awareness through title sponsorships.'' Among examples listed by Hoenscheid 
was a Team Lycos in a NASCAR auto racing series. The basketball Team 
Lycos will be one of a handful of branded team names in American sports. 
``Leagues have to be cautious,'' said Sean Brenner, editor of Team 
Marketing Report, a sports business publication in Chicago, because 
``fans can get upset.'' ``But the revenue potential becomes difficult 
to ignore,'' he added, particularly as fans ``become anesthetized 
to the increasing commercialization of sports, especially as it happens 
gradually.'' Roberto Muller, president and chief executive at Muller 
Sports Group in New York, said: ``Most teams are in need of money 
for bigger stars, more stars,''. But, he added: ``I just don't see 
a major sports league in America ever naming teams after sponsors.'' 
Indeed, the previous examples of teams selling naming rights mostly 
involved sports outside the mainstream. They include the Miami Hooters 
in arena football, named after the Hooters restaurant chain; Team 
OP in beach volleyball, named after Ocean Pacific swim wear, and the 
Detroit Neon in indoor soccer, named for the Neon subcompact car sold 
by DaimlerChrysler AG. Perhaps the most familiar example is the Colorado 
Silver Bullets, a women's minor league baseball team sponsored by 
the brewer of Coors Light beer, nicknamed ``the Silver Bullet.'' The 
Coors Brewing Co., a unit of the Adolph Coors Co., sponsored the team 
from 1993 to 1997. ``When our contract came up, we made a decision 
not to renew our sponsorship,'' said Lori A. Varsames, a spokeswoman 
for Coors Brewing in Golden, Colo. ``We were proud of what we were 
able to do with the team,'' she added, ``but it was a question of 
where our best sponsorship opportunities were.'' For instance, Coors 
Brewing continues as the naming sponsor of Coors Field, the home of 
the Colorado Rockies in Denver. After ending its sponsorship of the 
Silver Bullets, the brewer allowed the team to retain the name. If 
Lycos decided to discontinue its sponsorship, would a Team Lycos by 
any other name play as sweet? ``If we have sponsors in a market changing 
every year, that means the league would not be delivering good value,'' 
McMann said. ``I'm confident that won't happen.'' ``I'd like to help 
Lycos get to the point,'' he added, ``where it has the same brand 
recognition as the New York Yankees.'' That was music to Hoenscheid's 
ears. ```The House that Lycos Built,''' he said, chuckling. ``There 
you go.''
