Nearly one year ago, Adrien Brody, a six-foot, hazel-eyed actor, walked 
into Orso's restaurant in Los Angeles and sat down at a table on the 
patio with his agent and a publicist to talk about his budding career. 
He had just returned from six months in Australia where he played 
one of the coveted roles in ``The Thin Red Line,'' Terrence Malick's 
World War II epic that opens on Dec. 23 with an ensemble cast including 
Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson and John Travolta. 
Nineteen ninety-eight was shaping up as a pivotal year for Brody, 
who would also have key roles in movies by Spike Lee and Barry Levinson. 
By 1999 he would have a half-dozen movies in release. Had Adrien Brody's 
moment arrived? ``It was time to sit down and talk,'' said David Pollick, 
a publicist whose agency also represents Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad 
Pitt. ```The Thin Red Line' was going to be a big event picture. Adrien's 
career was happening. Now was the time to focus.'' Brody, 25, may 
or may not prove to be a star: His physical appearance is hardly the 
conventional blond, blue-eyed Hollywood handsome. He and his agents 
could make damaging decisions over the next few years. And Malick 
recently called to tell him that he'd had to trim back the actor's 
role during editing. But Brody's odyssey from Queens to Hollywood 
is a testament not only to his raw talent and persistence _ he aggressively 
pursued acting jobs from the time he was 12 _ but also to the indefinable 
ways careers can take shape in the movie business, sometimes in a 
flourish after years of preparation. ``It would not surprise me if 
Adrien becomes a movie star,'' said Spike Lee, who cast him in ``Summer 
of Sam'' (due next year) as a blond-mohawked punk rocker from an Italian 
neighborhood in the Bronx who is accused of being the ``Son of Sam,'' 
who terrorized New York City 20 years ago. (Leonardo DiCaprio originally 
agreed to the role, then backed out). Levinson, who cast Brody as 
a Jewish youth in 1950s Baltimore in ``Liberty Heights'' (also to 
be released next year), said the actor ``had a sensibility and a quality 
that's very interesting _ when he says the lines there's something 
else going on all the time.'' Daily Variety, in a review three years 
ago of ``Ten Benny,'' an independent film about a New Jersey shoe 
salesman, said the actor ``seems destined to become a star'' and that 
he ``displays the raw instinctive talent of a young De Niro or Pacino.'' 
(Recently, the trade paper compared him to European film stars like 
Jean-Louis Barrault, Gerard Philippe and Vittorio Gassman.) Malick, 
who auditioned hundreds of actors for the role of Fife in ``The Thin 
Red Line'' (a role based loosely on James Jones, who wrote the autobiographical 
novel), told Dianne Crittenden, his casting director, that Brody reminded 
him of Jean-Pierre Leaud, the star of the Francois Truffaut classic 
``The 400 Blows.'' Like her peers, Ms. Crittenden first became aware 
of Brody in Steven Soderbergh's ``King of the Hill'' (1993), a vivid 
Depression-era drama in which he played a streetwise youth. ``Adrien 
has a wonderful face,'' said Ms. Crittenden. ``He just has something 
_ you're mesmerized by him on the screen.'' Six months ago, Pollick 
began sending magazine editors copies of reviews for Brody in Daily 
Variety, hoping to boost his client's image. He followed by talking 
up Brody's appearance in ``The Thin Red Line,'' which has stirred 
considerable attention because it marks the director's return to filmmaking 
after 20 years. The result was a one-page photo layout on Brody in 
last month's Vanity Fair, followed by a GQ magazine photo spread. 
Standing in Penn Station in Manhattan one recent Sunday, waiting to 
board a Metroliner for Baltimore, where he is making ``Liberty Heights,'' 
Brody could have been a graduate student en route to Johns Hopkins. 
Removing his woolen cap, he revealed a 1950s style crew cut. His backpack 
was filled with books. His narrow dark face, all angles, was dominated 
by his nose. ``If I don't get parts,'' he said with a grin, ``it's 
because they say I'm too ethnic-looking.'' On the train later, sipping 
bottled water, Brody was low key and a bit nervous. ``It's like the 
quiet before the storm,'' he said. ``Like I have done this body of 
work, and I can do nothing now but sit back and wait and see what 
the outcome is.'' Whatever the outcome, by the end of 1999, Brody's 
life is sure to be far different than it is today. His career has 
moved along steadily, at times fitfully, like any other young actor 
able to earn a relatively modest living at his craft. (Until this 
year, his one windfall was $50,000 in residuals from the video sales 
of a Disney movie, ``Angels in the Outfield.'') But what has set him 
apart from other talented young actors is that casting agents in New 
York and Los Angeles noticed him early on and kept him in mind. ``When 
I heard 18 months ago that he was becoming flavor of the month I was 
not at all surprised,'' said Todd Thaler, a New York casting director 
who met Brody 10 years ago. ``Here was like this beautiful kid with 
a big nose, this incredible face. He had a wise-beyond-his-years quality. 
Like he seemed unself-conscious, uninhibited. You meet some kids, 
and you just know.'' Brody grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood in 
Woodhaven, Queens, the only child of two arty parents. His mother, 
Sylvia Plachy, is a well-known photographer who has worked for years 
for The Village Voice. His father, Elliot Brody, a retired New York 
City teacher, is a painter. At the age of five, he met a writer at 
The Village Voice, Howard Smith, who showed him magic tricks. ``He 
got feverishly interested in magic, and later he went to magic camp 
in upstate New York,'' said Ms. Plachy. ``He loved performing at birthday 
parties. Even if his tricks failed the kids loved him.'' He started 
taking Saturday morning acting classes at the American Academy of 
Dramatic Arts in Manhattan. An actress friend who saw the 12-year-old 
perform suggested he try out for an agent, Claudia Black, at the Harry 
Abrams Agency. He was promptly cast in an Elizabeth Swados experimental 
work at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and then in an off-Broadway 
satire, ``Family Pride in the 50's,'' playing a working-class boy 
who wanted to be a ballet dancer. ``There was no thinking about a 
career,'' said Brody's father. ``It was a creative outlet for him. 
And he loved it.'' At 13, he landed the starring role as an orphan 
in turn-of-the century Nebraska in a PBS drama, ``Home at Last.'' 
The same year, he was accepted as a drama major at the High School 
of Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. At 15, he auditioned for Mary 
Tyler Moore and was selected to play her step-son in the short-lived 
sitcom ``Annie McGuire.'' It was a turning point, and the family sat 
down to make a major decision. The only way Adrien could take the 
job was if one of his parents accompanied him to Los Angeles. His 
father took a leave from his teaching job and found an apartment in 
Beverly Hills so Adrien could attend Beverly Hills High School. It 
was the first time he and his parents fully realized that he had the 
potential to earn a living as an actor. But the show failed and Adrien 
returned to New York to graduate from the La Guardia High School of 
Performing Arts. He enrolled at the State University of New York at 
Stony Brook for a year but switched to Queens College because it was 
too far to travel to New York auditions. He dropped out after a semester 
to move to Los Angeles. Working in front of a camera, he said, came 
naturally to him. ``I grew up in front of a lens, my mother photographed 
me since I was an infant, thousands of pictures,'' he said. ``So I 
feel very comfortable in front of a camera, more comfortable than 
I am onstage.'' Still, the physical changes of his teen years caused 
him career problems for a while. He felt stymied. ``We had some painful 
discussions,'' said Deborah Aquila, now senior vice president of features 
casting at Paramount and a longtime casting director from New York. 
``He was so young when he started. He was a gangly teen-ager. It took 
time for him to fill out and grow into the man he is now. I told him 
not to worry. What mattered was his talent.'' Ms. Aquila had a major 
impact on Brody's career. She first cast him as a mentally ill patient 
in a little-known 1991 film, ``The Boy Who Cried Bitch.'' (Janet Maslin 
wrote in The New York Times that it was ``a more serious film than 
its terrible title suggests''). Two years later Ms. Acquila urged 
Steven Soderbergh to cast him in ``King of the Hill.'' ``Even as a 
teen-ager, Adrien had an exceptional range of talent,'' said Ms. Aquila. 
``And he's extremely exciting to watch, very sexy.'' Another major 
move, even before the Soderbergh film came out, was to snag a Los 
Angeles agent with International Creative Management, JoAnne Colonna, 
who has represented Jennifer Lopez, Lukas Haas and Gena Rowlands. 
Ms. Colonna had met Brody at the urging of her New York counterpart 
at a smaller talent agency when she moved to Los Angeles. (Brody now 
speaks to Ms. Colonna every day.) ``I saw in Adrien somebody who did 
not look like anybody else out there,'' said Ms. Colonna, who recently 
joined a new management company headed by Michael Ovitz. ``Here was 
this 18-year-old guy from Queens who seemed like an old soul, who 
had a distinct personality and had a lot of charisma.'' By his early 
20s Brody was living in a series of cheap Hollywood apartments. But 
he was working steadily in independent films, taking home about $900 
a week, and beginning to catch the eye of Hollywood executives. He 
played a Beat poet modeled after Allen Ginsberg in ``The Last Time 
I Committed Suicide,'' a ``Jewish homeboy who thinks he's black'' 
in ``Six Ways to Sunday.'' In ``Oxygen,'' he was a psychopath; in 
``Restaurant,'' a struggling playwright. (Several of the films are 
being released next year.) Pollick, senior vice president of the Baker 
Winokur Ryder publicity firm, remembers being struck by Brody in ``Ten 
Benny'' (formerly called ``Nothing to Lose'') several years ago at 
the Los Angeles Film Festival. He called Ms. Colonna, the agent. The 
young actor could not yet afford a public relations man, but Pollick 
offered to provide informal advice. In a sense, he was betting that 
Brody's career would take off and he would soon need representation. 
``There's a point you've got to cultivate relationships with young 
actors, and I saw something in Adrien that I didn't see every day,'' 
said Pollick. Despite his progress, Brody was getting restless about 
his career. ``It was steadily improving but there were no big movies 
or big breaks,'' he said. ``I could never land a studio film because 
they always went to the name actors. You know, `Get me Leonardo DiCaprio 
or Matt Damon or somebody.' Or they wanted an all-American type.'' 
But he was picky, too, wanting to make independent films and turning 
down television jobs, including the pilot of ``Northern Exposure.'' 
Megan Branman, a top television casting director, said, ``I've been 
trying for several years to get him on every pilot that calls for 
a guy in his 20s. He's not a pretty boy but he's got enormous presence. 
You don't get tired looking at him.'' Ms. Colonna, meanwhile, had 
read the script for ``The Thin Red Line,'' and arranged a meeting 
with Malick. The conversation lasted nearly two hours. ``We were at 
a hotel overlooking Central Park, we were watching the skaters and 
the conversation just kind of flowed _ about young people, about everything,'' 
recalled Brody. ``Finally, he said he'd like me in his movie, and 
I'm like, `Wow, that's great!' But I've had other people tell me that 
and nothing happened.'' Weeks later, Ms. Colonna called to say he 
had been cast as Fife. ``I was blown away, I almost cried,'' said 
Brody. Then a New York agent at ICM, Aleen Keshishian, urged Spike 
Lee, another client, to meet Brody after DiCaprio dropped out of ``Summer 
of Sam.'' The flamboyant role _ an Italian-American punk rocker who 
strips in night clubs _ was eagerly sought by other actors. Brody 
and the director met at a restaurant near Union Square. Later he read 
for the director wearing spiked hair, jewelry and a T-shirt depicting 
Robert DeNiro in a Mohawk. On the October night ``Summer of Sam'' 
completed filming in the Bronx at 4 a.m., Brody returned to his hotel, 
slept till 10 a.m., caught a noon Metroliner for Baltimore, and started 
on ``Liberty Heights.'' ``The part I play is a nice, sweet Jewish 
boy, very normal, somewhat repressed _ I need some repression in my 
life at this point.'' The actor speaks to his parents every day. His 
father has carefully invested his son's money. Brody plans to buy 
a sports car since reluctantly giving up motorcycles after the frightening 
accident on an East Hollywood street in 1993 that left him immobile 
for several months. Separately, Brody, Ms. Colonna and Pollick say 
they're waiting to see what happens. Colonna and Pollick are convinced 
their client will soon emerge as a significant actor, if not a star. 
Brody says he's nervous about the reaction to his three big studio 
films as well as the smaller independent movies. But he has one priority, 
once the money starts rolling in. ``I want to buy my mother a loft 
in SoHo and my father a big stone house in upstate New York,'' he 
said.
