FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ D.C. United became the first U.S. 
team to win the InterAmerican Cup, as Eddie Pope and Tony Sanneh scored 
Saturday in a 2-0 second-leg victory over Brazilian club Vasco da 
Gama. D.C. United won the two-game series, which pitted the North 
and South American club champions, by an aggregate score of 2-1. Vasco 
da Gama won the first leg match 1-0 in Washington on Nov. 14. For 
Vasco da Gama, the loss to a U.S. club that's been playing for just 
three years will be a major source of embarrassment. It also caps 
a 23-day trip away from Rio de Janeiro that included a 2-1 loss to 
Real Madrid in the Intercontinental Cup on Tuesday in Tokyo. United's 
win closed out coach Bruce Arena's three-year tenure with the club, 
which included two Major League Soccer titles. Sanneh gave United 
a 1-0 lead in the 34th minute by running onto a far post low cross 
played by defender Jeff Agoos through the middle of the Vasco da Gama 
defense. With the aggregate scored deadlocked at one, the Brazilians 
picked up the pace in the second half, but to no avail. In the 56th 
minute, Donizete hit the post from a wide angle, and seconds later 
he forced D.C. goalkeeper Scott Garlick into a diving save from nearly 
the same spot. D.C. United made it 2-0 and took the lead in the series 
on Pope's goal in the 77th minute. The goal started with Marco Etcheverry's 
corner kick that was headed by Roy Lassiter to an open Pope. D.C. 
defender Carlos Llamosa blocked a volley by Vasco's Guilherme in the 
89th minute to preserve the win for United.
