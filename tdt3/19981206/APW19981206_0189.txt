Thousands of Indonesian farmers protesting higher fertilizer prices 
burned vehicles and looted fertilizer storehouses, a local report 
said Sunday. The riots occurred Saturday night in Blora, about 312 
miles (500 kilometers) east of the Indonesian capital city of Jakarta, 
the state-run Antara news agency reported. The farmers damaged the 
house and office of a private storehouse owner, along with a storehouse 
run by a farmers' cooperative, the report said. They were angered 
by a price hike at the privately-run storehouse and unavailability 
of cheaper fertilizer at the cooperative, it said. There were no reports 
of arrests or injuries, Antara said. Indonesia, the world's fourth 
biggest country, is facing its worst economic crisis in decades. Civil 
disturbances have increased amid mass unemployment and rising prices 
for staple food items and other basic goods.
