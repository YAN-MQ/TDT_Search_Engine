They crossed a once-forbidden border to return to a land they left 
long ago. Sohn jie-Ae reports on a homecoming for some Koreans. 80-year-old 
oh Shim-Ae sings of joy, joy at seeing her hometown for the first 
time in nearly 60 years. She and about 800 former north Koreans were 
on the first south Korean tour boat to the north scenic kumgang mountains, 
just a few kilometers from where oh Shim-Ae grew up. I remember climbing 
those rocks. I was only 16 then. Today, oh Shim-Ae's content to bask 
in her happy memories, and tries not to think of the mother and father 
she left behind more than 50 years ago. Parents, she never saw or 
heard from again. Many north Koreans came to kumgang mountain filled 
with joy and happiness at being able to see their Homeland once again. 
But many also came with much pain in their heart. This man couldn't 
hold back his tears, as he bowed before the picture of his wife's 
parents. Several former north Koreans used their first-time back to 
hold traditional ceremonies for deceased family members. And even 
though they were banned from doing so, some asked the north Korean 
caretakers for information, any information about relatives they left 
behind. Most to no avail. All I want to know is if they're alive somewhere. 
How can I go back without even that? 76-year old park soon-yong was 
told by the north Korean guards that his mother, who he left behind 
during the war, passed away in an air raid in 1951. If only she had 
come with me. If only I had forced her to come. But regrets aside, 
park says he is the luckiest former north korean on this trip. For 
he's now ready to do what's eluded so many on this trip, put his painful 
past to rest. Sohn jie-Ae, CNN, kumgang mountain, north Korea.
