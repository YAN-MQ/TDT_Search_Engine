Vice President Al Gore lost his father this weekend. And the nation 
lost one of its most respected former senators. Albert Gore Sr. Died 
last night at his home in Tennessee, his son by his side. He was 90 
years old. Vice President Gore was among those arriving at the funeral 
home today in carthage, Tennessee. Albert Gore Sr. Served 32 years 
in Congress, first in the house, then in the Senate, where he was 
a leading advocate of liberal causes. Gore's opposition to the Vietnam 
war, in which his son served, may have cost him his Senate seat. In 
1970, when he left public office, he vowed, "the truth shall rise 
again." Gore saw his son rise to the Senate and beyond. President 
Clinton remembered senator Gore last night on air force one. He was 
Progressive on race. He was courageous in standing up for what he 
believed in. The president is expected to attend the memorial service 
this Tuesday in nashville.
