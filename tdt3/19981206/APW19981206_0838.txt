After meeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing 
two suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be 
secured in the ``not too distant future.'' Annan's comments came Saturday 
after he and Gadhafi failed to agree on handing over Abdel Basset 
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who are suspected in the 
1988 bombing that killed 270 people. Annan later spoke on the telephone 
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as he flew from Jerba 
to the United Arab Emirates to attend a Gulf summit. ``We are well 
on the way to resolving the problem,'' Annan told Albright, according 
to a U.N. statement faxed to The Associated Press. On Sunday, state-run 
Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official in the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, 
which is the equivalent of a foreign ministry, as saying that ``a 
solution to this crisis is within reach.'' He gave credit to Annan's 
talks with Omar al-Muntasser, Libya's foreign minister, who met Annan 
in Sirte before Annan met Gadhafi. Sirte is 400 kilometers (250 miles) 
east of the Libyan capital Tripoli. The official spoke of ``fruitful 
talks'' but gave no details. The broadcast was monitored by the British 
Broadcasting Corp. Also Sunday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook 
said in an interview with the BBC that he had spoken with Annan on 
Sunday and was ``very encouraged by what he tells me.'' He added: 
``I think you could sum up our mood as one of qualified optimism.'' 
Britain would like to see the two suspects in custody by Dec. 21, 
the 10th anniversary of the Pan Am bombing. But Cook said Britain 
will not budge on the demand by Washington and London that the suspects 
serve any sentence in a Scottish jail. Libya has asked that any prison 
terms be served in the Netherlands or Libya. Annan spoke to reporters 
in Tripoli after the meeting with Gadhafi and later when he arrived 
back at this Tunisian island, where he had begun the day of diplomacy 
that lasted nearly 15 hours. The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get 
Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects 
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 
bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. ``The talks have been fruitful and 
positive,'' Annan said in Tripoli. ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness 
and readiness to find a solution to the Lockerbie problem. ``Libya 
has also agreed to a trial in a third country and believes that it 
ought to be possible to find answers to all other outstanding issues,'' 
he said. ``So I hope that in the not too distant future we will be 
able to give the families good news,'' he added, referring to the 
relatives of victims who have lobbied extensively for a trial. Annan 
later arrived in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, where he will 
attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a federation of six 
Arab Gulf states.
