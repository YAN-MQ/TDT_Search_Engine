Former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who staged a bloody coup attempt against 
the government six years ago, was elected president of Venezuela Sunday 
_ a stunning blow to the political and economic establishment that 
has ruled during 40 years of democracy. With 78 percent of the vote 
counted, Chavez had 56 percent compared to 40 percent for Yale-educated 
businessman Henrique Salas Romer, according to official results from 
the National Electoral Council. People poured into the streets, dancing, 
setting off fireworks and honking their horns in celebration. ``Venezuela 
is being born again,'' Chavez declared as soon as the election results 
were revealed. He made an appeal for national ``reconciliation'' and 
said he would pursue prudent economic policies. ``Once again the people 
of Simon Bolivar have shown themselves to be a grand people,'' he 
told the Venevision television network. Chavez often invokes South 
American liberation hero Bolivar in his speeches. Because of Chavez's 
meteoric rise in the polls, the vote had turned into a confrontation 
between rich and poor _ and a warning sign for the rest of Latin America. 
``These are historic elections. Nothing like these elections has happened 
in Venezuela's political history,'' said U.S. Ambassador John Maisto. 
After victory was announced, Chavez sought to assure investors that 
he would not impose exchange controls or other radical economic measures, 
as his opponents had charged. ``We are going to instill confidence 
and that's my first message to investors,'' Chavez said. ``You the 
investor, if you have capital abroad, bring it here.'' For the first 
time ever, neither of Venezuela's two traditional parties fielded 
candidates in these elections. In an effort to head off a Chavez victory, 
both the center-left Democratic Action Party and the center-right 
COPEI Party dumped their respective candidates during the past week 
and threw their support to Salas, who had been running second in the 
polls. In 1992, Chavez tried and failed to overthrow Venezuela's democratically 
elected government. His critics asserted he would impose a leftist 
dictatorship and roll back free market economic reforms. Chavez on 
Sunday cast his vote amid some 1,000 supporters roaring, ``Chavez! 
Chavez!'' and ``Viva Venezuela!'' As he drove away, throngs of teenagers 
chased after his white van. The voting Sunday was orderly, and turnout 
was high at 65 percent. Street celebrations broke out nationwide on 
Sunday evening; people donned Chavez's trademark red parachutist's 
beret and hung Venezuelan flags from balconies. ``Down with the oligarchy!'' 
shouted one woman standing outside Chavez's Caracas headquarters. 
Reports that Chavez supporters would stage violent protests if their 
candidate lost prompted appeals for calm from President Caldera, who 
said the army would respect results. Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole 
coalition, which calls for fewer privatizations and a slowing of free-market 
reforms, already won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections, 
breaking the two traditional parties' 40-year political stranglehold. 
Chavez's call for a new constitution and the dissolving of Congress 
has scared investors and exacerbated an economic crisis. Foreign oil 
companies, including Exxon, Mobil, Shell and British Petroleum, have 
frozen some of their investment plans. Venezuela is the number one 
exporter of oil to the United States. The eleventh-hour attempt by 
COPEI and Democratic Action to close ranks around Salas failed, even 
though Salas supporters had hoped the well-greased political machinery 
of the old-style parties would help him win. The campaign took on 
overtones of class warfare. Chavez's militaristic rhetoric terrified 
middle and upper class Venezuelans, many of whom have already fled 
to Miami. ``He's a crazy man on the loose, a communist,'' said Elena 
Alamos, an elderly woman casting her vote in Caracas's upper class 
Altamira district. An economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil 
prices has made life difficult for most Venezuelans, whose standard 
of living has been steadily for more than 15 years. On Sunday, 11 
million of the country's 23 million inhabitants were eligible to vote. 
Among the trailing candidates was former Miss Universe Irene Saez, 
who had led the polls until earlier this year. On Sunday, she won 
3 percent of the vote, according to the partial results.
