International space station. The shult's astronauts will soon be taking 
the first steps towards assembling the most expensive scientific project 
in history. Tony Clark has more. With the Module firmly in place, 
"endeavour" is speeding toward a Sunday afternoon meeting with the 
zyara Module. It will pass 600 feet directly underneath it then the 
commander will fly a Half circle around zyara and slowly close in. 
When they are about ten feet apart, astronaut Nancy kurry will grab 
it with the shuttle's robot arm and bring zyara within inches of the 
pay load bay. The shuttle will then fire a jet to dock the two space 
station modules. Unity coming out of the pay load bay. Saturday, the 
12.8 ton unity Module was gently lifted out of its berth in the pay 
load bay with only an inch of clearance on either side to spare. Beautiful 
and delicate work so far. Pleasure to watch. Unity is designed as 
a connecting Module for the space station. It has six attachment ports 
to which future modules will be connected. It took more than an hour 
to lift unity and stand the 36 foot long Module upright in the bay. 
We've got unity firmly attached and we're off to a great start on 
building the international space station. Once the two modules have 
been joined, astronauts Jerry Ross and jim Newman will perform three 
six-hour space walks to connect cables between the units and install 
equipment. If all goes according to schedule, there will be five more 
assembly flights next year alone and by January 2000, the first three-member 
international crew will begin living and working on the space station.
