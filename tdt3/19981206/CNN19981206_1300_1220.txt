Coming up later -- the Broncos and the chiefs. If Denver can get by 
Kansas today, the Broncos will become just the third team in league 
history to open a season with 13 straight wins. I think this is their 
Super Bowl to be honest with you. I can hear Marty speaking and saying 
that you know, we're so high on our horses, we don't think we can 
be beat. He's going to get his team fired up and ready to play. We 
are gonna have to play the best game we've played this season. Because, 
you know, right now they're 12 down and 4 to go. And they are very 
much aware of what they are shooting for.
