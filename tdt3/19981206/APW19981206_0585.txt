South Africa's attempt to set a world record 18 wins in a row ended 
in a 13-7 defeat to England. Amid the gloom of that loss at the end 
of a demanding year, the Springboks still have something to cheer. 
They are still the best rugby union team in the world. After victories 
over Wales, Scotland and Ireland, Nick Mallett's team went into Saturday's 
match at Twickenham aiming for a Grand Slam of victories over the 
British Isles nations and a world record streak but came up short. 
Perhaps jaded after 10 months of almost continuous rugby, they were 
outplayed by the English and had no arguments about losing. But the 
Springboks still return home as heroes. ``Our record speaks for itself,'' 
said team captain Gary Teichmann. We won 17 games before today and 
the team still has to reach its full potential. ``There is no doubt 
in my mind that the best is yet to come. We've got a six-month break 
and we will be back stronger than ever.'' Those words will alert the 
Australians and New Zealand All Blacks as they look ahead to next 
year's World Cup in October. France, who lost at home to Australia 
last month, also should be aware that the South Africans will be strongly 
favored to hold on to their world title. England, at least, knows 
it is capable of beating them. After dire performances against Italy 
(a narrow 23-15 win) and Australia (a 12-11 loss), Lawrence Dallaglio's 
team produced its best rugby since tying 26-26 with the All Blacks 
a year ago. The forwards outshoved the Springbok pack and the backs, 
despite having to make five changes during the match, survived a second 
half battering from the South Africans and didn't concede a try for 
71 minutes after Pieter Roussow's opening score. From 7-0 down, England 
hit back with Jeremy Guscott's try, converted by Matt Dawson, and 
the scrum half recovered from an earlier miss to kick two long-range 
penalties in the last quarter of the match to clinch a hard-earned 
victory which may make England favorite to win the Five Nations next 
February and March. ``We are not getting carried away with this one 
result, because we always believed we could do it,'' Dallaglio said. 
``Sure, we needed to prove that the self-belief was justified, but 
there is enormous need for improvement. We are trying to become a 
team that sustains quality and goes for the jugular instead of sitting 
back on a lead. ``We must make sure that we score more tries, and 
I rank England as a side who are capable of rising to the occasion 
_ but not consistently. We hope to change that. ``If you are going 
to be a great side you have to perform better than we did. Just because 
we beat the Springboks we don't inherit their crown after their 17 
Test wins.''
