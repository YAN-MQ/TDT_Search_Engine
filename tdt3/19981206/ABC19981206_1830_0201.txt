You could call it a high-tech, high-altitude handshake. And it's going 
on now, far above the earth. Astronauts aboard the space shuttle "endeavour" 
tonight are joining the first two Module of the international space 
station. ABC's Mike Von Fremd has more. It is one of the most difficult 
maneuvers ever attempted in space, stacking two giant cylinders is 
the most dangerous part of the 12-day mission. Astronaut Nancy Currie 
is using the shuttle's 50-foot long robot arm to connect America's 
25,000 pound cylinder named unity with the Russian built zarya, which 
was launched last March. And Houston, "endeavour," we got a tally 
on zarya. Zarya and unity are so large that astronaut Currie must 
do something called blind docking. From her window she cannot see 
the exact point where the two sections meet, so Currie is relying 
on instruments. The astronauts practiced this in simulated conditions 
underwater. It has never been attempted before in space. Tomorrow, 
they will secure the two pieces with the first of three demanding 
six-hour space walks. It will take five years to assemble the international 
space station, which will eventually stretch the length of two football 
fields and will be visible from earth. This is going to be far and 
away the largest thing that's ever orbited the earth and more than 
anything else that we've had in space, the taxpayers and the voting 
public will be able to go out every evening and see where the money 
got off to. The cost for building and operating the space station 
could escalate to over $100 billion. Some scientists say that may 
turn out to be a bargain if experiments such as cell division lead 
to medical breakthroughs back on earth. Mike Von Fremd, ABC News, 
Washington.
