In the dejected Seattle Seahawks' locker room Sunday, the emotions 
ranged from frustration to bewilderment to outrage. How else could 
the Seahawks react to their controversial 32-31 loss to the Jets? 
Television replays indicated that Vinny Testaverde was tackled before 
the ball crossed the goal line on his game-winning, 5-yard quarterback 
sneak with 20 seconds left in the game. If the play had been called 
that way, the Seahawks would have stopped the Jets on the fourth-down 
play, and Seattle could have simply run out the clock and left Giants 
Stadium with a hard-earned victory. Instead, the Seahawks (6-7) were 
dealt a crushing defeat that seriously damaged their playoff hopes. 
Making matters worse, they saw a strong offensive performance go to 
waste. Seattle led by 28-13 early in the third quarter, after Anthony 
Simmons intercepted a Testaverde pass and returned it 36 yards for 
a touchdown. At that point, the Jets were in deep trouble. Joey Galloway, 
Seattle's fleet wide receiver, had already burned the Jets for touchdown 
catches of 70 yards and 57 yards. Aaron Glenn, the Jets' best coverage 
cornerback, had been beaten one-on-one by Galloway on both touchdowns. 
And Glenn was forced to leave the game late in the second quarter 
with a sprained ankle, leaving the Jets' defense even more shorthanded 
for the second half. Yet, Seattle was held to just one field goal 
during the game's final 28 minutes. Ray Mickens did a solid job replacing 
Glenn, and the Jets gave Mickens help by double-teaming Galloway, 
who did not catch a pass in the second half. The Seahawks blamed themselves 
for not throwing to Galloway more often, and for not taking advantage 
of other openings presented by the Jets' second-half decision to double-team 
Galloway. ``They double-teamed me, but it's the same coverage we've 
been seeing around here for 13 weeks,'' Galloway said of New York's 
second-half defense. ``We either figure it out it and beat it, or 
we don't, and I don't get the ball.'' Dennis Erickson, Seattle's coach, 
admitted his team should have kept throwing to Galloway. ``We have 
to get the ball to him regardless of what they're doing,'' Erickson 
said. Galloway welcomed the one-on-one matchup against the Jets' best 
cornerback, and he was sorry to see Glenn leave the game. Glenn was 
injured when he landed awkwardly after intercepting another deep pass 
intended for Galloway. But Jon Kitna, Seattle's quarterback, said 
a bad throw led to Glenn's interception. ``I threw it too far to the 
right,'' said Kitna. ``If I throw it to the left, we've got another 
touchdown. Joey had him beat dead to rights. We just didn't make the 
proper throw. And when we got ahead, we didn't put them away.'' Asked 
about his matchup against Glenn, Galloway said, ``I hadn't seen bump-and-run 
coverage in a while. When I saw him go down, I knew it was going to 
be double-coverage from here on out. From my standpoint, I was hoping 
that he played.'' Asked about Mickens, Galloway said: ``He didn't 
do much. He played soft coverage, didn't come up, pretty much what 
we expected. When you go deep against their best guy twice and beat 
him, you don't expect that second guy to tangle with you.'' Yet, despite 
Galloway's confidence and two touchdowns, the game was won by the 
Jets. The Seahawks had been beaten. But in their hearts, they believed 
they had been robbed. Afterward, they were not interested in apologies, 
sympathy or admissions of error. They wanted a victory. And in their 
opinion, one had been stolen from them because of incompetent officiating. 
Asked what he thought of the officiating crew, Seattle defensive end 
Michael Sinclair did not mince words. ``They need to go see the wizard 
_ no heart, no courage,'' Sinclair said. ``It's frustrating.'' Seattle 
cornerback Shawn Springs threw his helmet in disgust more than 10 
yards after Testaverde's last run was ruled a touchdown. ``To us, 
that was a playoff game,'' he said later. ``We're fighting for our 
lives. Now, if we're not dead, we're in critical condition.''
