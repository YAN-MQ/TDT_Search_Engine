Singapore's deputy leader said his country's crisis management efforts 
amid a regionwide economic slump will attract foreign investors and 
help the economy recover, a local newspaper reported Sunday. The tiny 
island republic will lure more overseas capital and business because 
of its ``good track record in reacting to unexpected events,'' Deputy 
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was quoted as saying in The Sunday 
Times. ``Singapore may be in the same region, but we are different 
from other countries,'' said Lee, who has directed his country's response 
to the Asian financial crisis. The government recently unveiled cost-cutting 
measures worth dlrs 6 billion to boost Singapore's competitiveness 
and position its economy for a rebound. Workers will bear the brunt 
of the massive cost-cutting package _ which totals about 7 percent 
of the entire gross domestic product _ through steep reductions in 
pay and other benefits. Although there has been some grumbling, few 
workers have challenged this approach. After years of successful economic 
planning nation, most Singaporeans seem ready to make the sacrifice. 
``We must get used to the idea that the boom that preceded this crisis 
is over,'' Lee was quoted as saying.
