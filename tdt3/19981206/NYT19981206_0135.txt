A former child star and a pioneer black star of television shared 
the stage Sunday night at the annual gala of the Kennedy Center for 
the Performing Arts. The two, Shirley Temple Black and Bill Cosby, 
were joined by the composer Andre Previn, the singer-songwriter Willie 
Nelson and the Broadway songwriting team of John Kandor and Fred Ebb 
as recipients of Kennedy Center Honors. Cosby, 61, whose starring 
role in ``I Spy'' in 1965 was the first by a black actor in a television 
series, was also a television fixture in the 1980s comedy series ``The 
Cosby Show.'' Mrs. Black, 70, whose roles as a child cheered up a 
weary nation during the Depression, followed her acting career as 
an ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia. She said at a luncheon 
for the recipients that she would primarily like to be remembered 
``as a wife and mother.'' Saturday night, at a dinner at the State 
Department for the six recipients, Nelson looked uncharacteristically 
genteel in a tuxedo and Texas cowboy hat that he had specially made 
for the occasion. Born in the farmlands of Texas 65 years ago, Nelson, 
who revolutionized country music with his singing and songwriting, 
and the other honorees received their medals from President Clinton 
at the White House before the gala at the Kennedy Center. At Saturday 
night's dinner, the actor Jack Lemmon, who won a Kennedy Center honor 
two year ago, said of Cosby, ``He shows us the delicious truths of 
our ordinary lives.'' Previn, 69, has conducted five symphony orchestras, 
and appears regularly as a guest conductor for the Vienna Philharmonic. 
Most recently, he adapted Tennessee Williams' play ``A Streetcar Named 
Desire'' to opera. A native of Berlin whose family moved to Los Angeles 
before the Nazi takeover, Previn said he felt particularly grateful 
for receiving the award because ``it is such a peculiarly American 
honor.'' Kandor, 71, the composing end of the team, and Ebb, 63, the 
lyricist, make up the longest-standing partnership in Broadway musical 
history. Some of their best known musicals include ``Cabaret,'' ``Chicago'' 
and ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' ``Caberet'' won a Tony award for 
the best musical in 1966. The pair are known both for their optimistic 
songs like ``New York, New York'' and ``How Lucky Can You Get,'' and 
for their taking on serious topics as they did in ``Caberet,'' which 
captured fascism in pre-war Berlin. When asked how he kept such an 
optimistic outlook, Ebb said matter-of-factly, ``Because things like 
this keep happening to me. It is life-affirming to know that your 
work is so appreciated.'' Sunday night's program, the Kennedy Center's 
principal fund-raising event of the year, was videotaped for broadcast 
on CBS on Dec. 30.
