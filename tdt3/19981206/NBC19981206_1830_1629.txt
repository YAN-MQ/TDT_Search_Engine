Finally this evening, the search for life in a distant and forbidding 
environment. NBC's Dan Lothian now on a mission heading south -- far, 
far south. This unmanned sub is diving to the bottom of the ocean, 
on a Scientific fishing expedition. The Hunt for deep-sea animals 
under rough waters, 18 miles off the coast of monterey, California. 
It's not just a black hole. There really are communities down there. 
Communities of creatures rarely seen, now being collected. From a 
sophisticated control room aboard this vessel, owned by the Monterey 
bay aquarium research institute, engineers, as if playing video games, 
are really manipulating the arms of the remote sub. They are fishing 
for creatures 1,700 feet below the surface, where the sun doesn't 
shine. Takes a lot of patience, a lot of frustration involved in trying 
to collect these guys. Researchers have been painstakingly collecting 
unique animals from the deep for a display they plan to open next 
year at the Monterey bay aquarium. Once these creatures are found 
and captured, the challenge for biologists? Keeping them alive. And 
that can be somewhat difficult because of the dramatic change in the 
environment. From the dark, cold, high-pressure deep to the much milder 
surface, some animals melt almost immediately. Others survive initially, 
for a few days, or months, only to die mysteriously. It's different 
variables for different animals. The pressure, it's a challenge. Being 
able to care for animals 365 days a year is a big challenge. These 
animals thrive in captivity. They are called pom pom anemones, seven 
of them scooped up on this mission. Biologists have found 50 species 
that so far have adapted outside their habitat. Just as many have 
not survived for any length of time. We feel like pioneers. It's like 
space exploration. There's so much out there that we don't know anything 
about. So they keep going down to come up with more answers about 
the deep and creatures living there, for the scientific community 
and for the public. Dan Lothian, NBC news, Monterey.
