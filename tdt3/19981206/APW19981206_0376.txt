Thousands of people demonstrated in the Somali capital Sunday in support 
of the newly-established municipal administration and its decision 
to snub an international delegation. On Saturday, faction leaders 
Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid, former rivals who joined 
forces recently to set up a municipal administration for Mogadishu, 
rejected an international fact-finding delegation after it failed 
to arrive first in the capital before heading to the town of Merca, 
100 kilometers further south. The 23-member delegation, which included 
representatives of the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development, 
the United Nations, the European Union, the Arab League and the ambassadors 
of Egypt and Italy to Somalia, arrived in the indpendent northern 
Somaliland last week. The delegation, which was seeking a way of ending 
seven-years of civil war in Somalia, had been slated to arrive in 
Mogadishu Saturday, but landed in Merca instead, insulting Aidid and 
Ali Mahdi. It was unclear why the team changed its plans. Aidid said 
the last-minute changes were ``meant to create chaos and divergence 
to the reconciliation process of Somalia,'' and ordered the team to 
leave the country. Ali Mahdi, who was faction leader in north Mogadishu, 
and Aidid, who controlled southern Mogadishu in the formerly divided 
city, set up the new joint administration in mid-October, despite 
dissent by other rival faction leaders in their parts of the city. 
After seven years of civil strife in Somalia, which have pitted factions 
and clans against each other in armed conflict over control of regions 
of the country, faction leaders are wary of outside intervention. 
On Sunday, supporters of Ali Mahdi and Aidid rallied in Mogadishu 
stadium in the south of the city carrying placards denouncing Italy 
and calling for the release of Hashi Ali Omar, a Somali national indicted 
in Rome for the slaying of two Italian journalists in Mogadishu in 
1994. The demonstrators also burned an Italian flag, while Aidid accused 
Italian ambassador to Somalia Francesco Shortino of trying to move 
the capital from Mogadishu to an undisclosed alternative location. 
Shortino was among the members of the international delegation visiting 
Somalia. Somalia has been at war since clan leaders collaborated in 
1991 to oust President Mohamed Siad Barre, and then turned on each 
other, leaving the country at war with no central government.
