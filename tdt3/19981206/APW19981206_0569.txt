A prize-winning British television documentary about drug running 
from Colombia which was shown around the world, was a fake, an investigation 
has concluded. Makers of ``The Connection,'' parts of which were aired 
on the CBS program ``60 Minutes,'' paid actors to portray drugs dealers, 
faked locations, and falsely claimed there was a new heroin route 
from Colombia to Britain, the investigation found, London's Guardian 
newspaper reported Saturday. The documentary, made by a British production 
company, Carlton Communications, for the British network Independent 
Television, was investigated after The Guardian challenged its authenticity 
in a series of articles in May. The report by a panel of lawyers and 
independent TV producers was released at the weekend. The Independent 
Television Commission, the regulatory body for ITV, said the report 
was ``thorough.'' In a statement, the commission said the report ``points 
clearly to the fact that the program was, in important respects, in 
breach of the ITC's Program Code.'' The Guardian said Carlton Communications 
broadcasting director Nigel Walmsley is sending back eight national 
and international awards won by the documentary. ``We are refunding 
overseas broadcasters who bought ``The Connection'','' The Guardian 
quoted Walmsley as saying. The film showed a drug ``mule'' purportedly 
carrying millions of dollars worth of heroin to London for Colombia's 
Cali drug cartel. The inquiry panel said there was no evidence the 
``mule'' was carrying heroin ``rather than sugar, flour or mints.'' 
A man interviewed with his face covered and described as the financial 
controller of the Cali Cartel was an actor _ as were the ``mule'' 
and another key character, the drug loader, the panel said. One interview 
which purported to take place in a jungle hideout with a drugs baron 
actually took place in the hotel room of producer Marc de Beaufort, 
said the panel. The panel concluded that only de Beaufort, a cameraman 
and a researcher could have known of most of the fakery. But the panel 
said it could not determine whether de Beaufort knew of all the false 
elements in the program. ``The inquiry is obviously entitled to its 
own conclusions, yet I find it hard to believe the characters in the 
film were acting their parts,'' de Beaufort said in a statement. He 
called the conclusion about the actors ``untenable,'' and blamed his 
researcher, Adriana Quintana, for the ``alleged fakery.''
