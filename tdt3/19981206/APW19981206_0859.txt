Corn was more important than votes in Chiapas on Sunday in elections 
to make up for voting canceled in October after heavy flood damage. 
The rural towns where the vote was being held Sunday were largely 
empty since most people had gone into the countryside to harvest their 
corn crops, elections officials in San Pedro Chenalho said. Voters 
along the Pacific Coast and in mountain communities were electing 
nine county mayors and four representatives for the state Congress. 
Between 40 and 50 supporters of the leftist Zapatista rebels blocked 
a road in Aldama, 90 miles (145 kms) northeast of San Cristobal de 
las Casas, to discourage people from voting, local election officials 
reported. The protesters dispersed when police arrived. Polling stations 
opened at 8 a.m. (1400 GMT) and were to close at 6 p.m. (0000 GMT) 
Authorities in San Pedro Chenalho said however that they could close 
booths as early as 3 p.m. (2100 GMT) if turnout was low. Results were 
expected later Sunday. Chiapas suffered severe flooding in September, 
wiping out some elections records and forcing residents to focus attention 
on clearing roads and rebuilding their homes. The ruling party, known 
by its Spanish initials PRI, did well in the Oct. 4 vote, winning 
in most of Chiapas' 111 counties and recovering some seats that it 
had lost three years earlier. However, the conservative National Action 
Party retained control of the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez. Because 
flooding prevented the vote in eight counties _ and residents in San 
Juan Chamula county boycotted the election _ voters could not elect 
enough representatives to form a quorum on the state's 40-seat legislature.
