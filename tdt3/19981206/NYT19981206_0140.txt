Julius Larkin Hoyt, a lawyer and official of the U.S. Tennis Association, 
died on Nov. 23 at his farm in Wallkill, N.Y. He was 77. The cause 
was lung cancer. Hoyt served as president of the Eastern Tennis Association 
during the 1960s, a time when ``Lawn'' was dropped from the association's 
name and tennis was emerging from the gentility of a club sport to 
the mass appeal of the United States Open era. In later years, Hoyt 
became vice president of the North Atlantic Regional Tennis Association, 
treasurer of the USTA and a member of its management board. Hoyt established 
the law firm of Scott and Hoyt in Newburgh, N.Y., in 1950. He was 
a member of the Orange County Legislature from 1972 to 1984. A native 
of Walden, N.Y., Hoyt attended the Pawling School. He graduated from 
Cornell University with a bachelor of science degree in 1943. After 
three years in the Air Corps during World War II, Hoyt returned to 
Cornell and graduated in 1950 with a law degree. He is survived by 
his wife, Elisabeth of Wallkill; three sons, Gunther of Salem, Va., 
Hubertus of Frankfurt, Germany, and Alexander of New York; four grandchildren; 
and four nephews and nieces.
