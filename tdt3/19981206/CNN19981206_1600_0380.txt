James Hoffa is claiming victory in the election to lead the teamsters 
union. Hoffa will now run the organization once controlled by his 
father, Jimmy hoffa. The new leader says he has two objectives for 
the teamsters, to balance the budget without raising dues and to win 
better contracts. Hoffa says his father's disappearance and presumed 
murder in 1975 will influence how he runs the union. I think it was 
definitely linked to his return to the union. I think that people 
in the union and the mob did not want him coming back because he was 
going to change the union. And he was killed by the mob. And that's 
what I said to those people who criticize me. I say the mob killed 
my father. Oh, they're never going to come back in the union. I'll 
see to that. Hoffa lost an earlier bid to head the union in 1996. 
The teamsters have about 1.4 million members.
