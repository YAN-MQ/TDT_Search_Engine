Gyo Fujikawa, a prolific author and illustrator of children's books, 
including some of the first to feature children of many races, died 
on Nov. 26 at New York Hospital. She was 90 and lived in Manhattan. 
The California-born daughter of a Japanese farmer and an aspiring 
Japanese social worker, Miss Fujikawa was among the first illustrators 
to command royalties rather than a flat fee. Miss Fujikawa's father 
borrowed her first name from a Chinese emperor (the name rhymes with 
Leo). She illustrated five books, including ``Mother Goose'' and ``The 
Night Before Christmas,'' and wrote and illustrated 45 others. She 
also designed six U.S. postage stamps, including the 32-cent yellow 
rose self-adhesive stamp issued last year and the United States-Japan 
Treaty centenary stamp of 1960. Although she retired from writing 
and illustrating books in 1990, when her last two books were published, 
Barnes and Noble booksellers had recently approached her longtime 
literary agent about reprinting many of the ones that are out of print, 
said the agent, Bernard Kurman. The first two books she both wrote 
and illustrated, ``Babies'' and ``Baby Animals,'' have sold a combined 
1.3 million copies and are still in print. ``If you notice,'' Miss 
Fujikawa wrote a few years ago, ``in all my books (except for the 
fairy-tale books) there are very few grown-ups. I try to draw children 
in such a way that they convey the emotion or the action or whatever 
it is that I'm talking about.'' Born in Berkeley, Calif., in 1908, 
Miss Fujikawa studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles 
before and after spending 1932 in Japan, where she developed a love 
of Japanese art and a stronger appreciation of her heritage. Back 
home, she did promotional work on the movie ``Fantasia'' for Disney 
Studios, which later sent her to its advertising department in New 
York, where she designed many 25-cent Disney books. After the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, Mrs. Fujikawa's family 
was interned in Arkansas in a relocation camp. During the war Miss 
Fujikawa did movie and pharmaceutical advertising layouts and magazine 
illustrations. After she did a composite of Disney characters for 
McCall's magazine, Doris Dunewald, an editor at Grosset &AMP; Dunlap, 
asked her to illustrate a new edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's 
``A Child's Garden of Verses,'' which was published in 1953. A few 
years later Ms. Dunewald proposed that she write the text as well 
as illustrate the two books that became ``Babies'' and ``Baby Animals.'' 
After that Miss Fujikawa was to write and illustrate most of her books, 
including the last two, ``See What I Can Be!'' (Putnam, 1990) and 
``Good Night, Sleep Tight, Shhh. . .'' (Random House, 1990). Although 
she was engaged for a few years beginning at the age of 19, Miss Fujikawa 
never married. In her autobiographical sketch, written in her later 
years, she said, ``I am flattered when people ask me how I know so 
much about how children think and feel. Although I have never had 
children of my own, and cannot say I had a particularly marvelous 
childhood, perhaps I can say I am still like a child myself. Part 
of me, I guess, never grew up.''
