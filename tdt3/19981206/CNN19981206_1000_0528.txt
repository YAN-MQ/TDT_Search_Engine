This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather" update. 
A low pressure storm moving across the Great Lakes will drag a cold 
front into Texas. Showers and thunderstorms could be seen through 
the Mississippi valley into the gulf of Mexico, with snow showers 
across the Great Lakes into New England. Late in the period, another 
in a series of pacific storms enters the northwest coast, with showers 
through the mountains and inland. Rain showers are expected across 
portions of the coast. High pressure builds into the nation's midsection, 
and this keeps temperatures on the cold side westward. Teens 20s and 
30s are in the forecast for most of the Rockies and northern and central 
plains. Above seasonal norms continue for the east. On the extended 
forecast, heavy rain and snow Tuesday in the west, with showers and 
a few thunderstorms eastward. Snow showers will linger through Wednesday, 
with a few thunderstorms possible in southern Texas and the western 
gulf coast through Friday.
