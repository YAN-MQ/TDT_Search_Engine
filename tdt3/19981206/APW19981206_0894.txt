The military leader who has launched Nigeria on an ambitious path 
toward civilian rule proclaimed Sunday that ``democracy is here to 
stay,'' following local elections that drew a large and enthusiastic 
voter turnout. Saturday's elections were the first since Gen. Abdulsalami 
Abubakar outlined his plan earlier this year to cede power to civilians 
in May, and the polling drew praise Sunday from visiting U.S. Commerce 
Secretary William Daley. Abubakar took power after the June death 
of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who detained, tortured and occasionally 
killed his opponents. A leaderless coalition of former Abacha opponents 
led early results of the local elections, officials said Sunday morning. 
The Peoples' Democratic Party, a group of 34 traditional chiefs, academics, 
businessmen and ex-military generals, was the top vote-getter in most 
of Nigeria's 36 states, several National Electoral Commission officials 
said on condition of anonymity. The officials declined to say when 
official results would be available, adding that votes in some remote 
rural communities were being collected by donkeys and camels and that 
major cities had to deal with a higher-than-expected turnout. The 
PDP party has a murky platform and no leader, although former military 
ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo has donated dlrs 2.5 million and is campaigning 
for the party's presidential nomination expected later this month 
or in January. Despite its strong early showing, the PDP lost all 
seats in Lagos and Obasanjo's hometown of Abeokuta, about 60 kilometers 
(35 miles) to the north of Nigeria's largest city, officials said 
later in the day. The winners in those areas included the PDP's rivals, 
the Alliance for Democracy among other parties. Obasanjo was unfazed 
by the news. ``The final outcome will prove that the PDP is the platform 
preferred by most Nigerians,'' he told reporters. Pickup 7th graf
