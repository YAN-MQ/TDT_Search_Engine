Does anything exist outside culture? Is there anything that we do 
that is free of the distortions of our tastes and customs? That isn't 
irrevocably shaped by the languages we speak or our material interests? 
Is there anything out there that we can assume to be noncultural or 
transcultural or even universal? Don't count on it. Two years ago, 
Alan Sokal, a New York University physicist, wrote a satirical paper 
full of absurdities and scientific howlers arguing that even ``physical 
reality'' was at bottom a ``social and linguistic construct,'' that 
even famous numerical constants like pi are culturally dependent, 
that science _ presumably the most ``objective'' of human enterprises 
_ is culturally determined. He submitted the paper to the trendy academic 
journal Social Text as if he was serious. The journal's editors didn't 
get the joke, neither catching the errors nor thinking the paper's 
assertions absurd. They published it with pride in a special issue 
devoted to challenging scientific claims of objective truth. The firestorm 
set off by Sokal's hoax became an international scandal; more than 
a hundred reviews, philosophical papers and debates are now posted 
on Sokal's Web site (www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal). Yet what 
was the result? Sokal meant to undermine the extreme relativism latent 
in the field of ``science studies,'' but the editors defended themselves, 
and allies stood up for the mocked positions. There were no recantations 
even after the hoax was revealed. It would have been encouraging if, 
for instance, even the unchanging nature of pi had been affirmed, 
but no such luck. Maybe the whole mess suggested that there really 
is no common ground on which proofs can be made, arguments won, convictions 
overturned. Science is culture-bound, and so is argument about it. 
We are all post-modern (colloquially, pomo) relativists: You go your 
way and I'll go mine. If we meet, it's beautiful. And if we don't, 
well, that's only to be expected. But now it's happening again. This 
time, Sokal, joined by Jean Bricmont, a Belgian theoretical physicist, 
wrote a full-scale polemic that was published in French last year 
and has just been released here as ``Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern 
Intellectuals' Abuse of Science'' (Picador U.S.A.); it is also being 
translated into Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, German, Greek, Hungarian, 
Portuguese and other languages. The authors focus their attack not 
on American relativists but on the ornate French intellectuals who 
are celebrities at American universities, ranging from critic Julia 
Kristeva and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan to sociologist Bruno Latour 
and philosopher Gilles Deleuze. The accusation: that these star intellectuals 
display a broad and deep ignorance of science that is matched only 
by their nerve in cryptically using its vocabulary as a smoke screen, 
often diminishing science along the way. Thus, the ``erectile organ'' 
is compared to the square root of minus one (Lacan); poetic language 
is described with bumbling allusions to set theory (Ms. Kristeva); 
even Einstein's equation E(EQ)mc2 , is considered a ``sexed equation'' 
giving ``privilege'' to the presumably male speed of light because 
it's the fastest (Luce Irigaray). The book's detailed attack on French 
intellectual life helped make it a best seller in France. At least 
20 essays appeared in Le Monde alone. And many of the French critics 
focused not on issues of substance but on cultural matters. Sokal 
and Bricmont were accused of being pedantic foreign grammarians picking 
apart elegant (French) love letters. One offended opponent suggested 
that they were engaged in a typically American spasm of hatred that 
was reminiscent of Kenneth Starr's report. Another critic proposed 
that the two authors were like American militarists who, deprived 
of Cold War government support, sought a new menace to oppose. In 
other words, proclaimed the French counterattacks, this is a cultural 
battle, even a political battle, not an intellectual one. This also 
resembles a response to the first Sokal affair: many arguments made 
it seem that there aren't just two cultures, as C.P. Snow once famously 
described the sciences and the humanities; there are only cultures: 
French and American, left and right, poetic and scientistic. Arguments 
become battles of taste or the scrabbling of political opponents. 
Even Sokal is side choosing, explaining that in his attack on post-modern 
relativism ``my concern is explicitly political'': to rescue the left 
from its pomo taste makers. Meanwhile, he and his supporters have 
been denounced for raising the ``specter of left conservatism.'' And 
science itself becomes another terrain for cultural battles.
