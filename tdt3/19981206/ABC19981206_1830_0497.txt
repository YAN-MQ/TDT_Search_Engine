The new head of the teamsters is promising to make the union more 
militant. James P. Hoffa, son of the late, famous and infamous teamsters 
president jimmy Hoffa, won the election with about 55% of the vote. 
He says he wants to take the union back to the glory days. I see myself 
continuing a legacy of a strong union. A strong united union with 
money in the bank. One that delivers for its members. That's the legacy 
we want. That's what the members want. The teamsters represent nearly 
500,000 workers.
