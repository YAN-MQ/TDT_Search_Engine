The Honduran army has acknowledged that it has held military arms 
belonging to a Cuban-American arms dealer, who was a figure in U.S. 
efforts to arm Contra fighters, in its warehouses for the past 13 
years. Col. Jorge Andino Almendarez told reporters Saturday that ammunition 
belonging to Mario Dellamico has been kept in a military warehouse 
to keep it from falling into criminal hands. An opposition political 
leader, Alfredo Landaverde, criticized the military on Tuesday for 
holding arms belonging to an ``international weapons smuggler,'' and 
denounced Dellamico for trying to sell the arms to Honduras. ``There 
is no logical explanation why the armed forces are guarding the arms 
of a smuggler,'' said Landaverde, a Christian Democrat who Congress 
named in 1995 to oversee the transfer of police from military to civilian 
control. The U.S. Iran-Contra investigation into the clandestine operation 
to arm Nicaraguan Contra fighters found that Dellamico, a U.S. national 
based in Honduras, was an intermediary between arms dealers and the 
Honduran military. Because the Contras were based in Honduras, arms 
dealers shipped their wares into Honduras, where the Honduran government 
then took possession. The Contras then could purchase weapons from 
this supply to be used in their move to unseat the leftist Sandinista 
government in neighboring Nicaragua, according to the 1993 independent 
counsel report on Iran-Contra matters. Andino Almendarez said the 
military had committed no crime by holding the weapons. He said every 
Honduran president since 1985 has been aware of the storage. Landaverde 
has charged that Dellamico, whose name is spelled Del Amico in some 
records, participated in an attack against former President Carlos 
Roberto Reina. The 1997 grenade attack destroyed much of Reina's home 
in Tegucigalpa but no one was injured. Authorities also charge that 
Dellamico is linked to Cuban-American Luis Posada Carriles, who participated 
in a 1976 attack on a Cubana de Aviacion flight, killing 73 people, 
most of them Cuban athletes. The military ruled Honduras for nearly 
20 years, unseating three presidents in 1956, 1963 and 1972. It abandoned 
power in 1981.
