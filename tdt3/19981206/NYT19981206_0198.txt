Venezuelans swept a former coup-leader, Hugo Chavez, to a historic 
election victory on Sunday night, delivering him the presidency he 
failed to seize by force six years ago. Hoping for an end to decades 
of poverty amid oil wealth, euphoric supporters of the former paratrooper 
burst onto the streets and filled them with music, fireworks and blaring 
horns. The former lieutenant colonel, who on Sunday defeated a Yale-educated 
businessman, Henrique Salas Romer, with more than 50 percent of the 
vote, is the first leader in 40 years who has not come from Venezuela's 
dominant political parties. His meteoric success among legions of 
disaffected voters smashed the old-line party machinery and fanned 
fears of leftist dictatorship. ``We are democrats, and we are going 
to demonstrate it now,'' he told a television interviewer here Sunday 
night, smoothing over the hostility that had marked the campaign. 
``We're not tyrants. We're not dictators.'' Sunday night enthusiastic 
crowds, many sporting Chavez's trademark red beret, filled a main 
avenue and shouted, ``Viva Venezuela! Viva Chavez!'' They chanted 
demands to rewrite the 1961 Constitution, which had bolstered the 
rule of the elite for the four decades of Venezuela's democracy. ``Chavez: 
A National Feeling,'' declared a tall yellow banner raised to serve 
as the triumphant candidate's backdrop. As the streets throbbed with 
the joy of his supporters, nobody was really sure what Venezuela would 
look like under Chavez, who has been called a nationalist, a Communist, 
a hero and a would-be dictator. In the campaign, he frequently sported 
the red beret of the military special forces he once led to storm 
the presidential palace and called on supporters to crush ``los corruptos'' 
on election day. A fiery orator who has visited Cuba and praised President 
Fidel Castro, Chavez has become the symbol of hope through radical 
change for the four out of five Venezuelans who are poor, and the 
dangerous devil to the 20 percent who do not. Within minutes of the 
announcement of his victory, Chavez pledged to seek moderation and 
foster forgiveness, after a campaign rife with disinformation, innuendo 
and dirty tricks. Just days ago, at his closing rally in downtown 
Caracas, he had warned 700,000 supporters about the prospect they 
might lose the election through fraud. On Sunday night, he told his 
supporters to ``celebrate, but with humility, even with silence, with 
reflection. It's not about sticking your head out of the window, because 
tomorrow we begin another battle'' to rebuild Venezuela, he said. 
He called on Venezuelans to build ``with harmony, and with a great 
capacity for forgiveness.'' ``To those who have made mistakes, we 
say, `So did we.' Let's forgive each other our errors,'' Chavez said. 
With 78 percent of the vote counted, Chavez had 56 percent compared 
to 40 percent for Salas, according to official results from the National 
Electoral Council. In conceding defeat, Salas struck a similarly conciliatory 
note. ``I want to say to all Venezuelans that not only do I accept 
my adversary's victory, I also wish him much luck because his luck 
is Venezuela's luck,'' he said. Chavez called on the banking and private 
sector to bring back assets and investment capital sent abroad, precisely 
out of fear he would win Sunday's election. Chavez offered to open 
talks with the private sector, adding, ``Venezuela needs you, it needs 
friends.'' He told business leaders he wanted to understand ``how 
to interpret your expectations, your anxieties, your aspirations.'' 
But initially, those appeals seemed to draw little more than skepticism. 
Eric Ekvall, a political consultant here, was watching Chavez's interview 
with a group of very wary business executives. When the president-elect 
called for the repatriation of capital, ``There was a whoop of derisive 
laughter from the group here,'' Ekvall said. The reaction, he added, 
``sets the tone for how a lot of the business community here is going 
to react to him in the beginning.'' Rumors of massive fraud, of a 
post-election settling of scores, and threats of rioting ran like 
rivers through the capital in the days leading up to the election 
on Sunday. Though Chavez had been leading in election polls by 15 
to 22 points, veteran political analysts said on Sunday night they 
were still surprised that the old parties released their once-iron 
fisted hold on power under the weight of the democratic will. ``These 
are historic elections,'' the American ambassador here, John Maisto, 
said in an interview with reporters before the Chavez victory. ``Nothing 
like these elections has happened in Venezuela's history.'' The ambassador 
also said Washington would ``work with any government, no matter who 
is elected.'' Previously, the Clinton administration had denied Chavez 
a visa, citing his role in the attempted coup, but a State Department 
spokesman suggested last week that Chavez might have better luck securing 
a visa next time. The rejection, he said, ``is in the past, and the 
future we will deal with at that time.'' After trying, and failing, 
to seize power in two attempted coups against Carlos Andres Perez 
in 1992, Chavez became a symbol for Venezuelans impatient with corruption 
and misery amid vast oil wealth. Chavez went to jail for two years, 
but Perez lost as well: he was impeached to face corruption charges 
a year later. The paratrooper's popularity grew. His statements have 
fallen all over the political map, often depending on his audiences, 
although he has generally moved toward the center in recent weeks. 
Educated Venezuelans doubt Chavez's devotion to democracy, while the 
poor say democracy here has been little more than a cover for institutional 
corruption. Venezuela is the leading exporter of oil to the United 
States, and the biggest oil producing country outside the Middle East, 
but 40 percent of its people live in dire poverty, unable to afford 
a nourishing diet. ``We voted Chavez because we want a change, not 
a dictatorship,'' said Kurokwis Escobar, 35, who paints cars for a 
living. ``Right now, we need a change,'' declared Hughes Castilla 
Molina, 52, who owns an auto repair shop. ``If you say we're going 
to lose our liberty, I say we've lost it already. At least we'll have 
a change. We'll have education, health care, and housing, which we 
don't have now. That's the popular clamor.'' From the poor hillside 
slums like Petare to the posh, tree-lined streets of Altamir, Venezuelans 
turned out in record numbers to vote in an election freighted with 
a sense of history in the making. By mid-day, the number of voters 
at polling stations around Caracas had exceeded the total balloting 
in congressional and state elections a month ago, when Chavez's Patriotic 
Pole won a plurality with a third of the legislature and eight of 
the 23 governorships. For 40 years, the two traditional parties, Democratic 
Action and Copei, had shared the spoils of power in this oil-rich 
nation, and by the end of voting, their long day in the sun had come 
to an end. For the first time, the two parties fielded no candidates 
for president, and instead threw their support behind Salas in an 
unsuccessful, last ditch effort to tip the election in his favor.
