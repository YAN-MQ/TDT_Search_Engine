To the economy now and what Wall Street is doing to main street. CNBC's 
Allan Chernoff has our report. It seems a mystery -- the economy is 
doing well, the stock market soaring, yet job cuts keep on coming. 
The latest example, Johnson & Johnson, saying it needs to improve 
productivity and efficiency is chopping 4,100 positions. There's no 
trouble at the company. Profits have been growing. But, profits haven't 
been growing as rapidly as they used to. That's the story across corporate 
America, companies trying to keep profits on pace with investors' 
high expectations. Corporations that are not making super profits 
are concerned about how profitable they are. And if they can increase 
the bottom line by a percent or two by slashing 5%, 6%, 7% of the 
work force, they'll do so. Many technology and service companies keep 
on hiring, holding the unemployment rate near a record low. But manufacturing, 
energy and finance companies are seeing a slow down. So, corporate 
executives are taking drastic measures to keep their profit picture 
looking good. Bankers trust and Deutsche bank plan to cut 5,500 jobs 
as soon as regulators approve their merger. It has to be done. It 
will be done in order to make a more efficient and ultimately more 
successful bank. Job cuts this year are running at their fastest pace 
since the recession at the beginning of the decade. For manufacturing 
companies like Boeing, it's weakness in Asia that's to blame. Asia's 
troubles have also accelerated the slide in crude oil prices, causing 
a profit plunge for energy companies, leading to mergers and layoffs 
-- 9,000 for partners Exxon and mobil. There are realities in life, 
and we have to face up to them. And we'll try to do the process in 
as fair and even-handed a way as we can. Mergers are a quick way for 
companies to get bigger while cutting expenses. And, merger mania 
shows no sign of slowing down. You ain't seen nothing yet. There will 
probably be even larger mergers in the future. If the economy can 
keep cranking out jobs at the current rate, the layoffs may have no 
impact on consumer confidence. But if not, there's a danger that all 
the job cutting will make Americans cautious in their spending, hurting 
the economy and the very corporate profits that executives are trying 
to boost. Allan Chernoff, for NBC news New York.
