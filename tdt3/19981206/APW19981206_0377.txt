The sister of exiled Saudi dissident Mohammad al-Massari has been 
detained in Saudi Arabia, an Islamic human rights group said in a 
statement Sunday. Suha al-Massari, 33, was taken into custody in the 
Red Sea port city of Jiddah upon arrival from London last Monday, 
the Islamic Observation Center said in a statement. She was taken 
on the same day to Al-Hayer prison in the Saudi capital Riyadh, the 
statement said. A Saudi official confirmed the detention and said 
authorities were questioning Suha al-Massari about her brother's activities 
in London. The official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity, 
did not give any other details. Mohammad Al-Massari heads the Committee 
for the Defense of Legitimate Rights. The opposition group seeks far-reaching 
reforms in conservative Saudi Arabia and sharply criticizes what it 
views as widespread corruption and mismanagement by members of the 
ruling Al Saud family. Al-Massari said his sister was not involved 
in any political activity and was in London for the past 18 months 
caring for his children. ``The Saudi authorities acted without thinking,'' 
he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from London. 
``If they arrested her to extract information they will be disappointed, 
because she is not involved in my work.'' She had decided to return 
to Saudi Arabia to be with her family during the holy month of Ramadan, 
which starts around Dec. 20, said an official of the Islamic Observation 
Center. He asked that his name not be used. The center, an advocacy 
group for human rights for Moslems around the world, said it had sent 
a letter to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah saying that Suha 
al-Massari's arrest without charge violated Islamic principles. The 
center urged Abdullah to intervene on her behalf. The group will hold 
a sit-in in front of the Saudi embassy in London next Friday to protest 
her arrest, the official said. In 1996 Saudi authorities arrested 
Mohammad al-Massari's son and three brothers. It freed them eight 
months later.
