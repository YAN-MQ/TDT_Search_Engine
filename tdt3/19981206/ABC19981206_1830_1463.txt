When we come back, is this any way for religious men to behave? When 
your allergies are a nightmare, you need help. Not just any help. 
You need the power of zyrtec. Prescription zyrtec starts working fast... 
and keeps on working for 24 hours. And zyrtec works against so many 
allergies, from cats and dogs... to pollen and dust. So when allergies 
are a nightmare-- and when are they not? Remember... in studies, drowsiness 
was the most common side effect. Others included fatigue and dry mouth. 
Most side effects were mild or moderate. Most people weren't bothered 
by them enough... to stop taking zyrtec.
