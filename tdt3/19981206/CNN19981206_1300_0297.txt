The number of church arsons across the country appears to be on the 
decline. The co-chairman of the national church arson task force says 
a number of deliver ratly set fires has gone down by 30% each year 
since 1996. He says investigations and tougher prosecution of arsonists 
have led to the decrease. He also says there's no evidence of a nationwide 
conspiracy in the burnings. Fires were reported at 297 Churches in 
1996. 208 were reported last year. As of September 8, only 114 were 
reported this year.
