Several hundred opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko gathered 
outside his official residence Sunday to commemorate the 50th anniversary 
of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Although 
police had ordered the rally moved to another square in the center 
of the city, the demonstrators went ahead with the rally at Oktyabryskaya 
Square, about 200 meters (yards) from Lukashenko's residence. There 
were no arrests and no reports of violence. Organizers of the rally 
complained, however, they they were summoned to police headquarters 
before the rally. ``The attitude of the authorities to this rally 
shows that in this country there is no power of law, but the power 
of force. The human rights of life, information and law are violated 
in Belarus,'' said Youri Khadyka, deputy chairman of the Popular Front, 
the main opposition organization. In speeches at the rally, opposition 
leaders complained that Lukashenko, an authoritarian president who 
would like to revive the Soviet Union, has consistently violated human 
rights. Oleg Belyavsky, the main organizer of the protest, charged 
that 500 people had been unjustly arrested or beaten by authorities 
this year, and that thousands of people have been politically repressed 
over the past four years of Lukashenko's rule. The Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 10, 
1948.
