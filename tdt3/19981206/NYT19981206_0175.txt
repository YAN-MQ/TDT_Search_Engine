With fireworks crackling and horns blaring, the boulevards filled 
with music, Venezuelans on Sunday night celebrated the overwhelming 
election victory of Hugo Chavez in a historic vote that delivered 
the former coup leader the presidency he failed to seize by force 
six years ago. The former lieutenant colonel, who on Sunday defeated 
Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas Romer, is the first leader 
in 40 years who has not come from Venezuela's dominant political parties, 
and his meteoric success among legions of disaffected voters smashed 
the old-line party machinery long before election day. ``Viva Venezuela! 
Viva Chavez!'' shouted euphoric crowds who filled a main avenue on 
Sunday night. They chanted demands to rewrite the 1961 Constitution, 
which has ensured the rule of the elite for 40 years of Venezuela's 
democracy. ``Chavez: A National Feeling,'' announced a tall yellow 
banner raised to serve as the triumphant candidate's backdrop. As 
the streets throbbed with the joy of his supporters, nobody was really 
sure what Venezuela would look like under Chavez, who has been called 
a nationalist, a Communist, a hero and a would-be dictator. During 
the campaign, he frequently sported the red beret of the military 
special forces he once led to storm the presidential palace and called 
on supporters to crush ``los corruptos'' on election day. A fiery 
orator who has visited Cuba and praised President Fidel Castro, Chavez 
has become the symbol of hope through radical change for the four 
out of five Venezuelans who live in poverty, and the dangerous devil 
to the 20 percent who do not. Within minutes of the announcement of 
his victory, Chavez pledged to seek moderation and foster forgiveness, 
after a campaign rife with disinformation, innuendo and dirty tricks. 
Just days ago, at his closing rally in downtown Caracas, he had warned 
700,000 supporters about the prospect they might lose the election 
through fraud. On Sunday night, he told his supporters to ``celebrate, 
but with humility, even with silence, with reflection. It's not about 
sticking your head out of the window, because tomorrow we begin another 
battle'' to rebuild Venezuela, he said. He called on Venezuelans to 
build ``with harmony, and with a great capacity for forgiveness.'' 
``To those who have made mistakes, we say, `So did we.' Let's forgive 
each other our errors,'' Chavez said. With 78 percent of the vote 
counted, Chavez had 56 percent compared to 40 percent for Salas, according 
to official results from the National Electoral Council. Conceding 
defeat on Sunday at his campaign headquarters in Caracas, Salas said 
that ``not only do I accept my adversary's victory, I also wish him 
much luck because his luck is Venezuela's luck.''
