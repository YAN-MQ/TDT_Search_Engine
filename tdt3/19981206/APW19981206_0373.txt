A row between President Rauf Denktash and an opposition center-left 
party over the island's membership in the European Union cast a shadow 
on Turkish Cypriot parliamentary elections Sunday. Some 121,000 voters 
were eligible to elect 50 lawmakers from among 352 candidates fielded 
by seven political parties in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, 
which was declared by Turkish Cypriots in 1983 and is recognized only 
by Turkey. Results were expected on Monday. On Saturday, the eve of 
the elections, Denktash called on voters to support center-right parties, 
which have opposed Turkish Cypriots joining in negotiations for the 
island's membership in the European Union. One of the parties is run 
by his son, Serdar Denktash. Denktash contends Cyprus' membership 
in the EU would amount to the island's integration with EU-member 
Greece. The center-left accused Denktash of favoring his son's party. 
``The elections show that we exist and that we are not an artificial 
state,'' Denktash said. Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey 
sent in troops after a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. 
Opinion polls indicated that Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu's center-right 
party would win the largest number of seats. But it was not clear 
if he would have a majority. Eroglu has led the government, made up 
of his National Unity Party and a Social Democrat partner, since 1996. 
Turkish Cypriot opposition parties complain the election will be dominated 
by the large number of settlers from the Turkish mainland who have 
been given voting rights. A recent report by the European Union Commission 
put the number of recent settlers at 111,000 out of a total population 
of 200,000. Opposition parties claim that about half the candidates 
are settlers. Denktash is seeking a non-aggression pact with Greek 
Cypriots, who plan to to deploy anti-aircraft missiles on the island. 
Turkey has threatened to hit missile batteries if they are deployed. 
UN-sponsored talks for reunification of Cyprus deadlocked following 
Denktash's demands for recognition of his state and the cancellation 
of Greek Cyprus' talks on joining the European Union.
