News tonight about data from one of NASA's unmanned spacecraft -- 
the Mars global surveyor. According to the surveyor's measurements, 
the icecap on the Martian North Pole is smaller than previously thought, 
less than half the volume of the ice on greenland. They also now know 
that Mars' ice cap sits within a depression in the planet's surface. 
But scientists still can't answer America's biggest question -- was 
there ever life on Mars?
