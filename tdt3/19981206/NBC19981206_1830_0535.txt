A decade after the bombing of Pan Am 103, the case is no closer to 
resolution tonight. This, despite a hands-on effort by U.N. secretary 
general Kofi Annan to win custody of the suspects. NBC's donatella 
lorch has our report. Annan left Libya empty-handed, flying out in 
the middle of the night to continue a tour of the Middle East. His 
meetings with Libyan officials, followed by a brief, long-delayed 
get-together with Moammar Qaddafi, failed to win the handover of the 
two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, 
ten years ago this month. Annan tried to put a positive spin on the 
talks. Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and believes 
that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other outstanding 
issues relating to this matter. But a trial in a third country in 
this courthouse in Holland had already been agreed upon in August 
by the United States and Great Britain, the two countries that want 
to bring the suspects to trial. And today, the Libyan news agency 
which voices government policy said there would be no handover of 
the suspects by the bombing anniversary on December 21st. In Lockerbie, 
where Christmas decorations have appeared for the first time since 
1988, residents are frustrated at the delays. I don't see any reason 
why he can't just say, "right, the suspects are here, we will hand 
them over." But just two weeks short of the anniversary of the bombing 
in which 270 people, including 189 Americans, were killed, there is 
no sign the suspects are going anywhere. The case of Pan Am 103 remains 
open. Donatella lorch, NBC news, Lockerbie, Scotland.
