Heads are still spinning on Wall Street after last week's word of 
a Record-setting merger. Charles Molineaux looks at the most recent 
round of big corporate marriages. The value of mergers and acquisitions 
so far in 1998 is a Staggering $1.5 trillion. Strategists say corporations 
are seeking not just mergers, but big mergers. To get the efficiencies, 
the cost savings, you couldn't just buy a small "Peanut stand" kind 
of company to have any impact on your bottom line. And that led companies 
to begin dialogue with companies of equal or even greater size. And 
I think that the economies of scale, the pressure of global competition, 
the need for diversification -- Falling crude prices are credited 
for the latest big oil mergers. Limits on medical reimbursements have 
prompted similar marriages in health care. Analysts say such pricing 
pressures and tight profit margins encourage mergers across a broad 
spectrum of industries. You see that primarily in the U.S. in the 
oil industry, the financial industry, the car industry and the publishing 
industry. Each of these industries has a way to spread the fixed costs 
over more units through a merger. But investors may be getting over 
their M & a mania. Analysts say new concerns about how well merger 
partners will work together, as well as short-lived merger-related 
jumps in stock prices, have cooled market merger excitement. You got 
some real excess last June, where virtually every bank was a Potential 
takeover. I mean, look at bankers trust. When travelers bought Citicorp, 
I think bankers trust was selling above $100 and went to maybe $130. 
Now that it finally is a takeover, it hasn't done nearly as well. 
Still, the expectation is that if stock prices can avoid any major 
long-term declines, merger activity will stay strong, especially in 
the newly friendly environment created by federal regulators, who 
analysts say are no less vigilant, but less likely to question a merger 
just because it's a big one. Charles Molineaux, "CNN Financial News,"
