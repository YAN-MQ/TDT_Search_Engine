Britain said Sunday that following U.N. talks with Libya, two Libyans 
suspected in the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland 
may be in custody by Dec. 21, the 10th anniversary of the disaster. 
``I think you could sum up our mood as one of qualified optimism,'' 
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp. 
television interview. But Cook said Britain will not budge on the 
demand by Washington and London that the suspects must serve in a 
Scottish jail any sentence passed by Scottish judges sitting at the 
special court in the Netherlands. In talks in a desert tent in Libya 
on Saturday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Libyan leader Moammar 
Gadhafi failed to make a deal on handing over the suspects. But Annan 
said he believed an agreement could be reached soon. Cook said he 
spoke with Annan on Sunday and was ``very encouraged by what he tells 
me.'' Libya, the United States and Britain have agreed in principle 
to the Netherlands court arrangement. But Libya wants the suspects 
jailed in the Netherlands or Libya if convicted. Cook said it would 
be a great comfort to the relatives of the 270 victims of Pan Am Flight 
103 if the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa 
Fhimah, are brought to trial by the anniversary. Annan, Cook added, 
succeeded in getting across to Gadhafi ``the message that we are serious 
about this trial _ there is no hidden agenda.'' Jim Swire, spokesman 
for most families of the British victims, said Annan's meeting was 
important because Gadhafi has expressed fears of a trick and complained 
of being left out of the negotiations about the trial. ``What he needs, 
I think, is reassurance that this really is an offer of a fair trial 
and I can't think of anybody better than Kofi Annan to give that reassurance,'' 
said Swire.
