In news overseas -- the Israeli government put the brakes on the mideast 
peace process again this week. One of the main reasons was the attack 
on an Israeli soldier Wednesday, an attack broadcast around the world. 
Now the event is sparking a new debate in Israel. Should the soldier 
have opened fire? ABC's Gillian Findlay is in Jerusalem. Lisa mayara 
still finds it difficult to watch the video. The images of her son, 
being stoned and beaten by a Palestinian mob have been shown over 
and over on Israeli television. His behavior has been dissected, analyzed, 
and condemned. Why didn't he shoot? "The army gives soldiers weapons 
for a reason," this retired general says. If he had shot, his mother 
argues, he would have been killed and so would many Palestinians. 
Not anybody could have acted differently and got away with his life 
without causing a massacre. She says she received thousands of calls 
supporting her son, but in Israel, the army is a formidable institution. 
A symbol of strength to Israelis, a deterrent to the enemies. So these 
pictures hit a nerve. Here was an Israeli soldier, completely impotent. 
His attackers were even able to steal his gun. And then there was 
the lasting image of the soldier running away. It was a very, very 
difficult emotional thing to watch. You know, this fine, proud, invincible 
army suddenly being -- having the floor wiped with you. By his behavior, 
he simply destroyed the deterrence power, and this is why we are so 
mad at him. So mad, the army is reportedly considering court-martialing 
mayara. He is under orders not to speak. But his mother says all of 
those calls show a lot of Israelis believe it's the army and not the 
soldier, which is wrong. Everybody says the army prefers dead heroes. 
Do you believe that? Yes, today, I do. Jillian find Lai, ABC News, 
Jerusalem.
