It may come as a shock to most Americans that slavery still exists 
in the world. It came as a shock to these fourth grade students at 
the high line community school outside Denver. So much of a shock 
that they started writing letters and raising money, about $50,000 
so far. The money goes to a human rights organization, that buys freedom 
for slaves in Sudan. ABC's Sheila MacVicar has that part of the story. 
400,000. This is the price of a human life in southern Sudan. The 
equivalent of $310, that is how much freedom costs. John eibner, an 
American aid worker, is buying back slaves. These people, mostly women 
and children, were kidnapped by Muslim militiamen who have been fighting 
a civil war here for 20 years. "One day, the raiders came on horseback," 
he says. "They started shooting, and then they just took the women 
and children." His 8-year-old son was beaten and made to herd cattle. 
Many of the women have been sexually abused. This woman says she was 
held for six years and raped repeatedly. Her years of slavery have 
left her with two children, whose freedom had to be bought, as well. 
You are free now. So far, John eibner's organization has returned 
nearly 2,000 people to their families. But MA people worry that by 
paying the slave masters, they are only making matters worse. There's 
a danger that they are helping to maintain or to keep that system 
going. There's no evidence at all to suggest that this in any way 
encourages more slave raids and results in more people being taken 
into slavery. John eibner says he will continue to raise money, to 
keep buying the slaves back. But there is probably only one thing 
that will really end this slave trade, and that's an end to the war 
that has cost so much in lives and freedom. Sheila MacVicar, ABC News, 
London.
