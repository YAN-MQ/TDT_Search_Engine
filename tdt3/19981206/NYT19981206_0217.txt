The New York Times said in an editorial Monday, Dec. 7: The American 
Medical Association blundered badly when it endorsed a Republican 
bill last year banning so-called partial birth abortion. That blunt 
conclusion, reached long ago by many doctors, has now been echoed 
by consultants the AMA hired to investigate the debacle. Confronted 
with this finding, the organization has but one honorable path. It 
ought to use the gathering of its house of delegates this week in 
Honolulu to rescind its support for an abortion measure that intrudes 
on decisions best made by women and their doctors. The report by the 
consulting firm of Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton paints a devastating 
picture of a politically naive organization so consumed by the desire 
to cut a deal and to protect the financial interests of doctors on 
Medicare issues that it ``lost sight of its responsibility for making 
decisions which, first and foremost, benefit the patient and protect 
the physician-patient relationship.'' Trustees of the organization, 
rookies in the high-pressure game of congressional negotiations, ended 
up supporting the legislation, the report notes, even after failing 
to win concessions to address valid concerns about placing doctors 
in legal jeopardy by criminalizing a medical procedure the legislation 
defines only vaguely. Although the partial birth bill was vetoed by 
President Clinton, Congress, buttressed by the AMA position, came 
within three votes of overriding the veto. The bill's sponsors plan 
to introduce it again next spring. Moreover, the AMA's endorsement 
has helped encourage many state legislatures to impose partial birth 
bans of their own. In 18 states where such bans have been enacted, 
courts have blocked or severely limited their implementation, finding 
that the legislative definitions could cover the most commonly used 
abortion procedures, in violation of Roe vs. Wade. Inevitably, the 
issue will reach the Supreme Court, where the position taken by the 
AMA is bound to be influential. The group should correct its mistake 
on partial birth abortion before it causes more confusion and damage.
