The incoming president of the teamsters union vows there will be good 
times for its members. James P. Hoffa has fought for more than four 
years to head the union his father ran more than 30 years ago. It's 
a personal achievement for me. It's basically something about my family 
and my father's role in the union, but it's a special time for me. 
James R. Hoffa was famous for bringing the teamsters power and better 
wages, but he was infamous for his alleged ties to the mafia. He was 
imprisoned in 1971, and after his release, disappeared -- believed 
to have been murdered. Unlike his father who was a dockworker, the 
57-year-old Hoffa is a Detroit labor lawyer. Two years ago, he lost 
the union presidency to Ron Carey, who led a reform movement, promising 
to clean up the union. But Carey's election was ruled corrupt and 
was overturned by the courts, paving the way for Hoffa's victory in 
this troubled and divided union. We have a civil war going on in the 
teamsters. And we're putting that to rest. Hoffa is taking over a 
union plagued by its history of corruption and declining membership 
and power. They number only about 1.4 million down from 2.3 million 
20 years ago. But they've diversified. Teamsters aren't just truckers 
anymore. They're police, flight attendants, and other workers. The 
teamsters have enjoyed a resurgence of late, with the successful strike 
against U.P.S. last year. And Hoffa promises more. We're going to 
see a new militancy in the teamsters union in our negotiations. Hoffa 
says his teamsters will be bipartisan, strong and clean. No easy task 
for a union with such a notorious past. Cassandra Clayton, NBC news, 
Washington.
