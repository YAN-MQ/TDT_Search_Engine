The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 7: An innovative 
settlement of the class-action lawsuit against the troubled New York 
City child-welfare system offers hope that reform will take place 
at a swifter pace. The suit, brought by Children's Rights in 1995, 
charged the city and state with violating state and federal law in 
failing to protect 100,000 abused or neglected children. Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani brought in Nicholas Scoppetta to overhaul the system in 1996 
after the murder of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo by her mother. But 
even after hiring more social workers and reducing caseloads, deficiencies 
persist in supervision of caseworkers and monitoring of cases. Some 
children have continued to suffer abuse even though they are supposedly 
under the city's watch. The lawsuit, filed before the reforms by Scoppetta, 
commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, forced 
the city to answer critics who wanted more dramatic progress. But 
Children's Rights saw that a protracted legal battle would not hasten 
reform. Any court-ordered changes would still require the cooperation 
of government officials to be effective. Both sides have now agreed 
to set aside the litigation for a new approach. An independent panel 
of experts will assist the agency and review its progress over the 
next two years. It will be financed by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, 
which is devoted to children's issues, to insure the panel's independence. 
The panel, which will have full access to agency operations and records, 
will issue recommendations, but the agency will be free to fashion 
its own solutions. If the panel finds that the city has not acted 
in good faith on reform, the plaintiffs can renew the litigation and 
seek court intervention. A separate settlement requires the state 
to monitor the agency's compliance with state law and conduct reviews 
of case records. These agreements will surely serve children better 
than spending more time in the courtroom.
