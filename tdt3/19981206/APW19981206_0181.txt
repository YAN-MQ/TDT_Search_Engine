The chairman of a Malaysian opposition party has been freed on bail 
after a five-day remand which immediately followed his initial release 
from jail last week, a local newspaper reported Sunday. Chua Tian 
Chang, 35, better known as Tian Chua, was freed Saturday and ordered 
to appear at the Petaling Jaya neighborhood police station in Kuala 
Lumpur on December 19 to hear any charges filed against him or have 
his bail extended, the New Sunday Times said. Tian, chairman of the 
opposition Coalition of People's Democracy, had originally won a bail 
appeal after being held on separate charges last week, but was arrested 
again as soon as he walked out of the courthouse. Police have acted 
in response to Tian's call for political reforms and protest campaign 
against the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Tian was 
taken into custody last month on charges of disobeying police orders 
to disperse an unlawful assembly in the capital city on November 21. 
He was then rearrested for alleged possession of seditious printed 
materials. After his release on Saturday, Tian said he would continue 
to fight for democracy in Malaysia and the ``right to voice out opinions,'' 
the newspaper quoted him as saying.
