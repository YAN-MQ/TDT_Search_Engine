About 5,000 water and sewer workers in Puerto Rico say they will stage 
a 24-hour strike Monday to protest a breakdown in negotiations for 
a new labor contract. The workers are demanding a new contract before 
a private company, Professional Services Group, takes over most management 
of the government's Aqueduct and Sewer Authority in January. The company 
already handles the the utility's customer service department. The 
agency said most disruptions would be in requests for service and 
repair of water lines. Gov. Pedro Rossello has called the strike an 
attempt to disrupt campaigns just before a Dec. 13 vote on Puerto 
Rico's future relationship with the United States.
