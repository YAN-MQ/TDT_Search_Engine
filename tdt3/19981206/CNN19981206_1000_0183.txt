President Clinton's lawyers have put together a list of witnesses 
they hope to call. It includes legal and historical scholars who will 
testify on the constitutional standard for impeachment. Henry Hyde 
says he wants to see the witness list before he will commit to any 
specific timetable for the president's defense. The White House is 
asking for at least three days. One democrat on the committee says 
the hearings are fundamentally unfair. We have asked since the beginning 
to state what the charges are and how the president can defend himself 
against a presumption of guilt without knowing what the charges are. 
I think that's ridiculous and unfair. It's unprecedented in America 
to have someone defend themselves without saying what the charges 
are. Hyde is vowing the committee will wrap up its inquiry by the 
end of next week.
