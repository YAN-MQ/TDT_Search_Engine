Teenage girls and their dates are filling movie theaters, but not 
for "Chick flick" romantic stories. Sherri Sylvester reports. Box 
office has been disappointing for universal's romance "meet joe black" 
and its family sequel to "babe." This week, the studio taps into the 
horror genre with "psycho," a cinematic clone of the 1960 hitchcock 
hit. This material is meant to be investigated, and it comes from 
a wonderful place. You know, we were all fans of the first film. I 
think they all did a great job. No one's running a barometer. It's 
not a competition or a race. It's more of a childlike interpretation, 
excuse me, of, "this would be fun and interesting to do." In order 
to succeed, "psycho" needs teen girls. Research shows teen girls and 
their dates are driving the current high cycle of horror. I love being 
scared. I love the entire suspense thing. I love trying to figure 
out, "who's the killer?" The best part for audiences is when they 
can interact with the film, when they can yell at the screen and be 
like, "don't go in there!" The girl can grab onto the guy and say, 
"ooh, hold my hand!" And the guy can feel like a stud 'cause he's 
holding on to the girl. For studios, horror films are cheap dates 
that usually score on their first weekend out. Among recent releases 
-- "I still know what you did last summer" opened to $16.5 million. 
"Halloween h2o," $16.2 million, "bride of chucky," $11.8 million and 
"urban legend," $10.5 million. "Scream" helped get people hooked on 
that idea again because "scream" was a Really well-made horror movie. 
And it's a different brand of horror movie in that there's a lot of 
humor in it. The new brand of teen screams tend to mock their predecessors 
with smart lead characters played by popular young faces. I don't 
try to write teenage characters. I just try to write smart, funny 
and savvy characters. And if they happen to be 15, there you go. Kevin 
Williamson's "scream" and its sequel were $100 million hits. His "I 
know what you did last summer" grossed $70 million with a budget of 
only $13.5 million. Coming soon, "the faculty." But first, there is 
"psycho," which promotes itself as a shot-by-shot re-creation of the 
1960 original. Can it scare up a generation of moviegoers who may 
not have heard of hitchcock? Sherri Sylvester, CNN, Los Angeles.
