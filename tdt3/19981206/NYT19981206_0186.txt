Saying it was their duty to defy the mayor, a group of City Council 
members vowed Sunday to commit an act of civil disobedience Monday 
morning: They will hold a news conference on the steps of City Hall. 
The steps have been off limits since the police ordered new security 
guidelines that have blocked almost all access to the building. Councilwoman 
Ronnie Eldridge said that she and about a dozen colleagues decided 
last week to fight the security measures, which have been in effect 
since the United States launched missiles at suspected terrorist targets 
in August. ``We find it really unacceptable that people are not able 
to get into this little building that has nothing in it except a bunch 
of politicians,'' said Eldridge, a Democrat. ``We just want a little 
bit of freedom around here.'' Norman Siegel, executive director of 
the New York Civil Liberties Union, said he was helping Eldridge and 
other council members draft legislation to ease the security measures. 
``The legislative branch is supposed to make the law and the executive 
branch is supposed to implement it,'' Siegel said. ``So it's the council 
that should be deciding the matter of access to the steps.'' Colleen 
Roche, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said the police would 
have to decide how to respond to the news conference, since it was 
their job to enforce security measures. The police declined to comment. 
But Roche warned that the council could not change the security measures 
because under the City Charter, that job belongs to the mayor and 
the police commissioner. ``What they are suggesting exceeds the scope 
of their authority as legislators,'' she said. ``Because security 
is always in the purview of the executive branch of government.'' 
But Siegel said that the security measures were illegal, because they 
had prevented at least some people from attending council hearings 
and meetings. If the police stop the council members' news conference, 
he said, the members will ask a federal judge to intervene. Siegel 
said the news conference was ``just the beginning of a multilevel 
strategy to regain access to City Hall.'' Eldridge said she and other 
council members started plotting their rebellion last week, after 
a federal appeals court ruled that an AIDS service agency could hold 
a rally in the parking area in front of City Hall. The group, Housing 
Works, held the rally on Tuesday, but the police corralled the 200 
demonstrators into metal pens, a move that Eldridge described as ``ridiculous.''
