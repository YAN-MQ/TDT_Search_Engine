Only days from a European summit, the 15 European Union governments 
remained divided Sunday on issues that all agree must be resolved 
before a dozen newcomers can join the EU. The EU foreign ministers 
began a two-day session to lift an impasse over how to finance a near-doubling 
of the EU. That, plus the issue of how fast to expand the EU, will 
dominate the two-day summit opening in Vienna Friday. The EU has not 
set no entry dates to the chagrin of Poland, the Czech Republic and 
Hungary that are seen having the best chances in the EU expansion 
sweepstakes and want to join four or five years. German Foreign Minister 
Joschka Fischer said a ``concrete (entry) date can only be fixed when 
we see we can conclude the expansion talks'' and after the EU has 
reformed its own finances. On the latter, Austria _ which concludes 
its six-month EU presidency Dec. 31 _ has made no progress because 
September elections in Germany brought EU business to a standstill. 
``What we can expect from the Vienna summit is a lot of positive, 
but vague language about EU expansion,'' said a European Commission 
official. That would leave it to Germany, which assumes the EU presidency 
Jan. 1, to clinch a deal at a March summit. Fischer predicted final 
agreement will come in ``last-minute negotiations.'' The main problems 
are: _ Money: Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland fear they will lose 
money to finance the entry of Cyprus and 10 East European nations 
and recommend raising membership fees. But Germany, Austria, the Netherlands 
and Sweden say they pay too much already and want to freeze the EU 
budget, which totals 85 billion European currency units (dlrs 100 
billion) in 1998. Britain negotiated an annual refund in 1984 _ when 
it was poorer than today _ to offset its net payments. It refuses 
to give up its rebate which totals 2.6 billion pounds (dlrs 4 billion) 
this year. The European Commission has proposed to link EU spending 
to economic growth which would add 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion) 
to the budget by 2006. The budget is now funded by sales taxes and 
membership dues from 15 member nations. They can be asked to pay up 
to 1.27 percent of their annual gross national product. _ Agricultural 
Reform: Subsidies guaranteeing the EU's 10 million farmers minimum 
prices eat up half of the budget. The European Commission has proposed 
cuts of up to 30 percent in subsidies, which just about every government 
opposes. Equally unpopular is the suggestion to pay farmers more from 
national coffers. _ The speed of expansion: The EU is negotiating 
with Cyprus, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia 
but refuses to set an entry date. The Netherlands, Germany, France 
and Italy don't want a divided Cyprus in at all. Preliminary talks 
have begun with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. 
The European Commission says Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia do so 
well they should join the fast-track talks. Germany and France oppose 
that. _ Decision-making reforms and defense: Britain, for one, long 
rejected an EU defense machinery, majority voting in foreign policy 
and ending national vetoes to accelerate decision-making. Last week, 
it endorsed an EU defense dimension but there is no deal on a slew 
of institutional reforms.
