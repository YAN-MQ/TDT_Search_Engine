Libya's Congress could hold the key to extraditing two suspects wanted 
in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. United Nations secretary 
general Kofi Annan met with Libyan leader Moammar gadhafi yesterday. 
Although Gadhafi didn't hand over the suspects, Annan hopes they'll 
be handed over "in the not-too-distant future." Libya's people's Congress 
must approve any release. They're set to meet Tuesday. Libya's foreign 
minister says some procedural and legal matters must be settled before 
any release is made. The 1988 crash killed 270 people.
