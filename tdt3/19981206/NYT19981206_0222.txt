There are few institutions in the world more venerable than Britain's 
House of Lords, whose roots date back to the 11th century. Now, as 
that institution is about to be changed almost beyond recognition, 
it has emerged as a protector of the rights of individuals at home 
and abroad. Last week, the Law Lords, a group of five peers who serve 
as Britain's highest court, surprised many by ruling that the former 
Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, can be extradited to Spain to 
stand trial. ``International law has made plain that certain types 
of conduct, including torture and hostage-taking, are not acceptable 
conduct on the part of anyone,'' wrote Lord Nicholls. The decision 
has left Britain's Labor government in an uncomfortable position as 
it decides whether to permit the extradition. The Labor Party has 
long reviled Pinochet, but Prime Minister Tony Blair also values good 
relations with Chile and many in Britain recall the general's help 
during the 1982 Falklands war between Britain and Argentina. No one 
is suggesting that the possible discomfort of Blair played a part 
in the decision of the Law Lords. But it would be understandable if 
some members of the House of Lords were pleased to see the government 
squirm. The day before the decision was announced, Queen Elizabeth 
II, reading a speech to Parliament that was written by the government, 
announced that ``a bill will be introduced to remove the right of 
hereditary peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords.'' She added 
that it would be the first step in an effort to make the House more 
democratic and representative. Currently, most members of the House 
of Lords are there by inheritance, but many were appointed for life 
by governments chosen by the Commons. The Law Lords who rendered the 
Pinochet decision were appointed to the body. Allowing hereditary 
peers to vote is hardly democratic, and reform is perhaps overdue. 
But Blair has yet to reveal what further changes he will make. Having 
a house composed of only appointed members is not a model of democracy 
either. The powers of the House of Lords are already limited. It cannot 
block money bills, and other legislation can be delayed for no more 
than two years. As Walter Bagehot, the British journalist and historian, 
wrote 126 years ago, ``The House of Lords must yield whenever the 
opinion of the Commons is also the opinion of the nation, and when 
it is clear that the nation has made up its mind.'' As it happens, 
the House of Lords is now involved in what may be such a fight. It 
is resisting a government bill _ already approved by the Commons _ 
to change the way Britain chooses its delegates to the European Parliament. 
The new electoral system would make it all but impossible for a European 
Parliament candidate opposed by his or her party's leaders to win 
election, thereby making it more likely delegates would do as they 
were told. Members of the House of Lords, that most undemocratic of 
institutions, say that is not very democratic. They would seem to 
have a point.
