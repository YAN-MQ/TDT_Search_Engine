The day's top stories are coming up next. And ahead in consumer news, 
a new trend in the insurance industry could mean some extra cash for 
policy holders. The Coliseum area in the early '90s was dilapidated 
buildings, overgrown lots... abandoned vehicles and basically it wasn't 
an area you would want to be caught in. Oh, now, they can't believe 
that it's the same area. When people come in they say, "where did 
these houses come from?" "Is this the same neighborhood?" I feel like 
the neighborhood is a family. It is an extended family. And that's 
the most wonderful thing about moving over here. It's having great 
neighbors... they look out for you. Everybody is, is concerned about 
their house and yours. So when my neighbor leaves to go anywhere, 
he gives us his keys to get in... he give us his code to his alarm 
system. Homeownership is the main ingredient. When you own your own 
home, it gives you a feeling you belong. You stand for something. 
This is our chance to create an atmosphere. A neighborhood. Mrs. Rios: 
we look at the neighborhood and we look at the house and we feel like 
we've accomplished something. The Fannie Mae foundation.
