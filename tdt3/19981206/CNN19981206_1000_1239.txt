Jus tig Wallace, "CNN Headline Sports." Tennessee is most likely headed 
to the fiesta bowl. Two fourth quarter touchdown passes lifted them 
past Mississippi state 24-14. We had to fight for everything we got 
this year. Nobody gave us the respect at the beginning of the year. 
So we knew we were a team that could get the job done. Like the coach 
said, we ain't got to be the best 'cause those guys pick you to be.
