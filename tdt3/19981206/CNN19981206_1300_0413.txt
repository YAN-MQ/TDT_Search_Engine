Attorney general Janet Reno is still deciding whether to request the 
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate President Clinton's 
1996 campaign fund-raising. Sources say top justice department officials 
are strongly recommending against it. The sources say the officials 
are telling Reno, there's clear evidence President Clinton did not 
have criminal intent. The law requires proof of intent to sustain 
a prosecution. A 90-day preliminary inquiry into campaign fund-raising 
ends tomorrow.
