Television's favorite young twins want audiences to know they're not 
so little anymore. Jim Moret met up with the Olsen twins. Mary-Kate 
and Ashley Olsen are growing up in the spotlight. From the age of 
9 months with a starring role on "full house," these twins have tickled 
audiences with their double dose of charm. This season, Mary-Kate 
and Ashley returned to prime time with ABC's "two of a kind." Who's 
pokey Valentine? Ashley's boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend! He doesn't 
even know I like him. He will tomorrow! You're dead! They've gone 
from barbies to boys. See all these pictures? Well, we don't really 
get to tell them which ones we want, but if it was up to us, we'd 
have -- Ben Affleck. Ben Affleck up there. Makeup -- Lipsticks, really 
pretty eye shadows. This is my favorite part. And clothes. These are 
my favorite pajamas. Oh yeah, I love these pajamas. These 12-year-olds 
have also made a huge and profitable Mark on the world of home video. 
We've got to get to Miami "billboard dad" is their latest release. 
Do you think a college guy would fall in love with a younger woman? 
Much younger? Emily is crushing on our diving coach. I'm a surfer, 
and she's a high diver, and we try to find our dad a woman, because 
he is really lonely. It's by the beach, and it's just a great summer 
fun movie. Their popularity has earned them millions of dollars and 
counting. If we weren't doing this, we'd have nothing to do, and we'd 
just miss it so much. We'd feel like something's missing from us. 
You guys still need a baby-sitter! Don't make me hurt you. Mary-Kate 
and Ashley won't need a baby-sitter for long. Well, I want to go to 
Europe, and I also want to go to Africa. TV's most popular twins may 
be young, but they seem to know the secret of their success. When 
we wear these cool clothes and, I don't know -- The hairstyles, I 
guess. The hairstyles, they always wanna, they've been wanting to 
do that, and I think that's what makes them love it so much. Jim Moret, 
"CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
