Some policyholders are benefiting from a new trend in the insurance 
industry. Lauren Thierry explains in this edition of "your money." 
Met life is just the latest mutually owned insurance company planning 
to go public. That means policyholders could be in for a windfall. 
Met life and Prudential and John Hancock, and some of the others that 
are likely to pursue this restructuring, this could be as much as 
a $50 billion wealth transfer to 20 million or 30 million Americans. 
This type of conversion, full demutualization, is considered the fairest 
by many consumer groups. In met life's case, each of its 12 million 
policyholders will receive an average of about $1,100 worth of stock. 
The number of shares distributed will depend on the value of the Holder's 
policy and how long they've owned it. To maximize gains, insurance 
experts have this advice -- pay up outstanding balances on premiums 
in cash. Don't let policies lapse. And close out any loans taken out 
against the policy. If given the option to cash the stocks in before 
the initial public offering, insurance analysts warn, don't jump the 
gun. Typically, demutualizations have been good investments for investors. 
The average six-month price performance of a demutualized stock has 
been up 40%. Consumer activists urge policyholders to read the terms 
of a Demutualization and find out what analysts expect from the ipo. 
Pay attention to the information you get sent, watch the values in 
the listings in the newspaper. And just educate yourself as much as 
possible. Richmond cautions there are other types of demutualizations 
that are less fair, such as the mutual-holding company structure. 
In those cases policyholders are not given a payout. Industry watchdogs 
say policyholders should vote against anything less than a full demutualization. 
That's "your money." Lauren Thierry, "CNN Financial News," New York.
