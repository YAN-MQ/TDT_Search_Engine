Space shuttle "endeavor" delivers today. It had to alter course to 
avoid a piece of space junk. It is what's left of a Delta two rocket 
launched last month. Tony Clark has more on the mission. With the 
unity Module now firmly in place in the shuttle's payload bay, "endeavour" 
is speeding toward a Sunday afternoon rendezvous with the Russian 
zarya Module. Endeavour will pass 600 feet directly beneath it. Commander 
Bob cabana will then fly a half circle around zarya and slowly close 
in. When "endeavour" and zarya are about ten feet apart, Currie will 
grapple it with the robot arm and bring zarya within inches of the 
unity Module in the payload bay. The shuttle will then fire a jet 
to dock the two space station modules. Houston, "endeavour." Unity 
is coming out of the payload bay. Saturday, the 12.8-ton unity Module 
was gently lifted out of its berth in the payload bay with only an 
inch of clearance on each side to spare. Beautiful, delicate work 
so far. It's a pleasure to watch. Yeah, Nancy's a real pro. Unity 
is designed as a connecting Module for the space station. It has six 
attachment ports to which future modules will be connected. It took 
more than an hour to lift unity and stand the 36-foot-long Module 
perpendicular in the payload bay. We have unity firmly attached. We're 
off to a great start on building the international space station. 
Once the two space station modules have been joined, astronauts jerry 
Ross and Jim Newman will perform three six-hour space walks to connect 
cables between the units and install equipment. If all goes according 
to schedule, there will be five more assembly flights next year. And 
by January 2000, the first three-member international crew will start 
living and working on the space station. Tony Clark, CNN, Johnson
