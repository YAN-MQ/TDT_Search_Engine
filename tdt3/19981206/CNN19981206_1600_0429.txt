Nine fans are recovering from injuries they received at the army/Navy 
football game. A railing gave way yesterday, as they were cheering 
after army took the lead with a touchdown. Four west point cadets 
and five prep school students were hurt when they tumbled about 15 
feet onto the artificial Turf. The game was suspended, as ambulances 
rushed to the scene. Only one cadet remains in the hospital with a 
broken neck bone. Doctors say he is expected to make a full recovery.
