U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan says the two suspects wanted in 
the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 could stand trial in the "not 
so distant future." He met yesterday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. 
Richard Roth reports. After hours of waiting, U.N. secretary-general 
Kofi Annan was whisked away for a desert rendezvous with Libyan leader 
Moammar Gadhafi outside the coastal city of sirte. A day of sudden 
twist and turn was capped off when senior members of the secretary-general's 
party, journalists and even his own security men were forced out of 
the motorcade by Libyan security. The U.N. top diplomat did meet one-on-one 
with Libya's ruler for about 90 minutes. The U.N. gave assurances 
to the Libyan leader that all governments, including the U.S. and 
Britain, were dealing with good faith on the lockerbie bombing issue. 
But despite some hopes that had been raised of appending deal, at 
a press conference at the capitol, Tripoli, Kofi Annan said more progress 
was made though no formal agreement was reached. Libya has also agreed 
to a trial in a third country and believes that it ought to be possible 
to find answers to all of the outstanding issues relating to this 
matter. It will require some time, but not an inordinate amount. Libya's 
foreign minister asked for more patience. We are very glad that we 
have very positive talks. Earlier, secretary-general Annan told the 
foreign minister that the crisis can be solved, if all sides are willing 
to act. Libya says leader Moammar Gadhafi does not hold the real power 
to turn over the two men accused of blowing up. pan am 103. Something, 
some committee analysts at the government says, Libya's people's congress 
will consider the issue this week and then decide. The secretary-general 
vows to press on, seeking a diplomatic solution, but critics will 
say it's been a decade, and the Libyans are still stalling the United 
Nations. One U.N. official said, "you'll have to begin reading the 
tea leaves," noting that the people's Congress of Libya will now consider 
whether the two suspects should be turned over. Richard Roth, CNN.
