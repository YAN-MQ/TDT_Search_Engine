That's "NBC nightly news" for this Sunday. Here's Tom Brokaw with 
a look at what's ahead tonight on "dateline NBC." Thanks, Chris. Join 
me tonight on "Dateline." Seven convicted killers almost escape from 
death row in Texas. One inmate actually made it over the wall. How 
could that happen in one of the nation's toughest prisons? We had 
inmates cut their way out. We need to find out why. Just how safe 
are we? That story on "dateline NBC" at a special time, 7:00, Tom 
Brokaw returns to this 6:00 central. Chris? Tom Brokaw returns to 
this desk tomorrow. I'm Chris jansing. Thanks for watching. I'll see 
you in the morning on MSNBC. Stay tuned, the Sunday edition of "dateline 
NBC" is next.
