Silvio Berlusconi, the former conservative Italian premier, declared 
his opposition to possible Italian political asylum to rebel Kurdish 
leader Abdullah Ocalan, the Anatolia news agency has reported. In 
a letter sent to Serdar Denktash, the deputy premier of the breakaway 
Turkish Cypriot state, Berlusconi said the Italian government should 
give up ``protecting Ocalan,'' Anatolia said Saturday. ``The leftist 
government in power is putting the traditional friendship and a history 
of cooperation between Turkey and Italy at risk by protecting a terrorist 
and forgetting how Italy suffered from terrorism in the past,'' Anatolia 
quoted from the letter. Berlusconi's letter was a reply to one sent 
to him by Denktash, in which the Turkish Cypriot expressed the breakaway 
state's full support to Turkey's extradition request.
