Today _ Dec. 7, 1998 _ is a date that will live in Justice Department 
infamy. This is the day that Janet Reno is likely to give the man 
at whose pleasure she serves a free pass for taking $73 million in 
public funds under false pretenses. He conspired to raise millions 
more, as evidenced by official White House films, for his own campaign 
_ contrary to law. His ``Asian connection'' financing of the TV spots 
he wrote himself compounded the illegality. How is Reno expected to 
justify refusing to turn over to independent counsel her deeply conflicted, 
two-years-and-counting, minor-players-only ``investigation''? Easy: 
his lawyers made him do it. Because Clinton followed the advice of 
counsel, he could not be held responsible. Try using that excuse on 
the IRS: Gee, my accountant thought it wasn't fraud. If Clinton's 
lawyers had tried to restrain him, others eager to understand his 
need for TV spots would have replaced them. Under Reno's theory, because 
his lawyers decide what the law is, the president can do no wrong. 
Paradoxically, this Clinton reliance on lawyers has led him to the 
brink of impeachment. All through this year of what ``is'' is, lawyers 
whose first priority is to keep him out of legal jeopardy have set 
the president's political strategy. To this day, he insists he never 
lied under oath. To preserve this legal position before a grand jury, 
he was forced to swear repeatedly to an absurdity: that he never intimately 
touched his inamorata. Then the Democrats won the election. Certain 
he was home free, he showed his contempt for Congress by going off 
to play golf while his lawyers prepared evasive answers to judiciary's 
81 questions. His lawyers' message: Wrap this nonsense up in a hurry. 
Impeach him if you dare. That stiffing stiffened the spines of moderates 
who might just dare. As a result, his lawyers have switched from hurry 
Hyde to delay DeLay. But having complained so loudly about dragging 
the inquiry out, it's too late to complain about a rush to judgment. 
His lawyers have based everything on avoiding admission of crime. 
But in protecting him from a possible indictment someday, they invited 
impeachment. Huge mistake. He has never been in danger of ``jail to 
the chief.'' Even if indicted after leaving office, he would win acquittal 
at trial. If the impossible happened, his successor, especially if 
Republican, would pardon him. Nor is he in danger of removal by the 
Senate after House impeachment. In the absence of public outrage, 
perjury about sex is insufficient cause for such a Draconian solution 
His only danger is impeachment, the meaningful censure. That word 
would appear in the first sentence of his obituary. For Clinton, avoiding 
impeachment should take precedence over any embarrassment or legal 
liability. How? As Shakespeare suggested, first kill all his lawyers. 
They now plan two days of argument about why lying under oath isn't 
really perjury, or why perjury about sex doesn't count, or why Monica 
wasn't given a Miranda warning. They stubbornly ignore the First Law 
of Holes: when in one, stop digging. Instead, Mr. President, take 
a daring new course. Pay a surprise visit to the committee. Dissociate 
yourself dramatically from all past legalistic hair-splitting. Admit 
that it's fair to say you lied under oath _ not ``misled'' but lied 
_ and show that you are unafraid to face prosecution later. Say that 
that you are ashamed not just of your behavior but of your cover-up. 
Promise that, if not impeached, you will carry out the laws more faithfully 
than any president ever did. Would this pre-emptive strike work for 
Clinton? Twenty Republican moderates would bolt in a heartbeat. Confession 
up front would be better for the nation's business and the rule of 
law than impeachment, a Senate trial through January and _ presuming 
a third of the Senate refuses to convict _ the grudging signature 
of a plea-bargainer on a joint resolution of censure. Would Clinton 
dare? Past performance suggests he will continue his legalistic dodging 
while striking a pose of penitence _ deny, deny, deny, but sorrowfully. 
Following the Reno rules, he will explain to history that he cannot 
be blamed for the demeaning result of impeachment because he was misled 
by counsel.
