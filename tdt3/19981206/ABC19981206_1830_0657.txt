A delegation of Canadian citizens flew to Texas today to plead for 
the life of Stan faulder. A Canadian who's been on death row there 
since 1977. His execution is set for this Thursday. But now, even 
U.S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright is involved. Here's ABC's 
Steve Osunsami. Canadian Stanley faulder is scheduled to die this 
week, convicted of murdering Inez Phillips, the mother of the powerful 
east Texas oil family. It was just a brutal, senseless thing that 
faulder did and I don't think the people of Gladewater would have 
any mercy on him. But in a state that has executed more criminals 
than almost any other western government, what has set this case apart 
is the accusation that Texas authorities failed to honor the Vienna 
convention, an international law that required them to tell this Canadian 
citizen that he could get help from his own government. This country 
is based on the rule of law, and international conventions which the 
U.S. has ratified is part of the law of this country. It is part of 
Texas law. Last week, even U.S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright 
weighed in, asking governor George W. bush for a 30-day stay of execution. 
Faulder's lawyer worries her appeal will fall by the waste side, as 
have so many others. The odds are he will be executed. I mean, the 
odds are against us. Governor bush is standing by his state's parole 
board and says it has already spent plenty of time investigating the 
charges. People can't just come in our state and cold-blood murder 
somebody. That is unacceptable behavior, regardless of their nationality. 
This week, reuben Carter, a former death row inmate arrived in texas, 
he's part of a group from Canada here to argue for faulder's release. 
We just want to slow this thing down, because you may not have the 
right man. Faulder has already avoided nine dates with Texas' lethal 
injection. If his appeal fails and he is killed, he will become the 
first Canadian executed in the United States since the 1950s. Steve 
Osunsami, ABC News, Austin, Texas.
