Nick Price held off a charge by Tiger Woods to win his third Million 
Dollar Challenge in a thrilling five-hole playoff Sunday. The 41-year-old 
Price birdied on the 374-meter (409-yard) par-4 17th for his third 
win at the tournament after Woods, whose ball was just off the edge, 
had to two-putt the hole. Price called Woods, who at 22 is old enough 
to be his son, a ``phenomenal player.'' ``To go 77 holes of a championship 
and it comes down to one putt is about as good as it gets. I don't 
know what we're going to do next year for an encore,'' Price said. 
Woods, plagued during the tournament by bad breaks on his putting, 
fought his way back after an opening round par-72. He started the 
day four strokes back but charged hard on the back nine, with an 18-foot 
putt to birdie on 17 and another birdie on the 422-meter (462-yard) 
18th hole. At the final hole, Price, leading the field at 15 under, 
was up a stroke. He two-putted for par. But then Woods, his ball about 
20 feet (6 meters) away on the fringe, used a sand wedge to sink another 
18-footer. (5 meters) He pumped his trademark uppercut into the air, 
and went into the sudden-death playoff. ``I had no choice. I had to 
make that shot,'' Woods said. ``I knew I hit it on the line. I wasn't 
sure I had the pace or not. ... As it kept rolling, kept rolling, 
about 3 feet from the hole, it looked like it had a really good chance 
and then it went right in center,'' Woods said of the shot. ``The 
two birdies he made on 17 and 18 speak volumes for the guy,'' Price 
said. ``Obviously to have beaten something like Tiger, it makes it 
a little special. He's a phenomenon,'' he said. ``I've got a great 
future behind me. He's going to win plenty.'' It was the first appearance 
by Woods in the tournament, and in Africa for that matter. He was 
greeted as a hero by South Africa's majority black population and 
mobbed at each of the holes. Disappointed at losing, Woods _ who earned 
dlrs 250,000 _ the birdies on 17 and 18 gave him a sense of achievement. 
Woods missed something else in the playoff _ his plane for Australia, 
where he will play in the President's Cup this week with Jack Nicklaus 
as captain. ``Jack won't be very happy,'' Woods joked. Price, the 
defending champion and course record-holder with a 24-under in 1993, 
started the round four strokes back, after leading for the first-two 
rounds. But the Zimbabwean, who treats this course like home, surged 
back Sunday with eight birdies, including six in a row from holes 
9-14. Only David Frost has won the Million Dollar Challenge three 
times. Justin Leonard finished third, a stroke behind, with a 3-under 
69 at the 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) Gary Player Country Club course. 
European sensation Lee Westwood, who had grabbed the lead Saturday 
from Price, shot his worst round of the tournament, a 73, and finished 
with a combined 276, even with two-time major winner Mark O'Meara, 
whose final round was a 68. Jim Furyk tied the course record of 64 
set four years ago by Nick Faldo, but finished in the bottom half 
along with Tom Watson, Colin Montgomerie, David Duval and Jesper Parnevik 
_ who still picked up checks for dlrs 100,000.
