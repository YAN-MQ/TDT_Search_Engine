The house Judiciary committee could vote on whether to recommend the 
impeachment of President Clinton by Saturday. Committee chairman Henry 
Hyde says he's considering letting lawyers for the president have 
a few more days to present their defense before the vote. Republicans 
and democrats hit the Sunday morning talk show circuit today, offering 
their criticisms and insight into the hearing so far. I think the 
Senate will have a trial. We will do our duty, and in our oath, we 
pledge impartial justice. We'll go forward. We will hear the evidence, 
and we will act. Do we have to? I don't think absolutely, but I think 
that it would be hard not to do that if the house votes one or more 
articles, so we will begin to prepare for that if the house votes 
articles of impeachment. We're going into a historic impeachment with 
no fact witnesses, no evidence, and we're talking about let's wrap 
it up. The Starr report is in serious question. The high procedures 
in process are going to go down in history as precisely what a Judiciary 
committee should not do.
