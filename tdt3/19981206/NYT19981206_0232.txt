Contending that the National Basketball Association and USA Basketball 
are refusing to grant releases for players who want to play overseas, 
Nick Van Exel of the Denver Nuggets, Marcus Camby of the New York 
Knicks and several other players are expected to sue the organizations 
this week, the players' agent said Sunday night. Van Exel, who wants 
to play the rest of the season in Europe, will be the lead plaintiff 
in the lawsuit. The agent, James Bryant, said he may file a class 
action lawsuit, which could influence the potential exodus of other 
NBA players to Europe. FIBA, the sport's world governing body, recently 
lifted a restriction that allowed only two American players on European 
teams. ``The problem has been getting clearance to play overseas,'' 
Bryant said. ``With offers being made, we have run into roadblocks 
from the NBA and USA Basketball.'' Bryant has not named a jurisdiction 
where the suit will be filed. Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's general 
counsel, disputed Bryant's charges. ``That's absolutely not true,'' 
Mishkin said. ``We've written to FIBA and have said the players were 
free to pursue other employment during the lockout as long as they 
return to honor their contracts with their teams when the lockout 
ends. I can't imagine what the dispute would be over.'' But Bryant 
said, ``Their position is not as clear as they might think,'' based 
on his reading of the league's rules pertaining to players going overseas. 
Byrant, whose ProServ management company represents 10 NBA players, 
not all of whom will be named in the lawsuit, said the problem is 
that Van Exel would want to finish the season in Europe _ even if 
the NBA lockout were lifted _ and then return to the United States 
as a free agent next summer. Van Exel, who was traded from the Los 
Angeles Lakers to the Nuggets in June, has one year remaining on his 
contract. Camby, who was traded from Toronto to the Knicks last summer, 
also has one year remaining on his contract. ``Nick wants to go to 
Denver, and Marcus wants to go New York, but there is no game,'' Bryant 
said. ``We're looking at probably playing three months over there. 
If the season is canceled, they won't miss anything. But right now, 
we can't even respond to offers.'' Though Van Exel may be the first 
NBA player to legally challenge the league regarding playing overseas, 
other marquee players have threatened to go to Europe if the labor 
dispute continues. Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the draft, 
has said through his agent that he is interested in playing in Europe 
rather than waiting for the lockout to end and signing with the Los 
Angeles Clippers. Portland's Damon Stoudamire is said to have received 
offers, too. Commissioner David Stern has said all NBA players are 
technically free agents during the lockout, but that all contracts 
would go back into effect once the lockout ended. More than 220 players 
have contracts for the 1998-99 season and another 200 are free agents. 
``What this is about is that the European teams simply do not have 
the same flexibility as the NBA teams,'' said agent Keith Glass, who 
represents more than a dozen players in Europe. ``They don't have 
unlimited options. An NBA team can bring up as many guys as they want 
during a season. In Europe, there are a limited number of moves you 
can make. ``The player has to commit to the rest of the season. If 
they don't, then the European team may not make that deal. Basically, 
what Van Exel and Camby may be saying is: `Look, I want to go for 
the year. I don't want to come back at your beck and call.' That's 
probably what's happening.'' With no talks scheduled, the lockout 
enters what many observers believe is the pivotal week in negotiations. 
Last month, Stern alluded to the second week of December as a period 
in which both sides would have to be headed toward an agreement to 
salvage a shortened season. While Stern has refused to announce a 
firm deadline, the prospect for an imminent deal remains slim. On 
Sunday, the union held a conference call featuring about 100 players. 
Of the 18 players who spoke on the call, a union official said, the 
dominant theme seemed to be scrapping the season if the owners do 
not compromise on their current proposal.
