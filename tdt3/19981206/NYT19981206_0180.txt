You probably never heard the name Earnie Frantz until now, but the 
New York Jets should cast his upraised arms in bronze. Frantz, the 
head linesman who was positioned on the sideline, signaled that Vinny 
Testaverde had scored on a fourth-down 5-yard quarterback sneak with 
20 seconds remaining for the 32-31 victory over the Seattle Seahawks 
that anointed these Jets as a team that can come back to win a game 
that appeared lost. ``There was a pileup,'' referee Phil Luckett said 
later, ``but the head linesman had already called a touchdown for 
the ball breaking the plane and despite the pileup of players, the 
decision had already been made.'' On several television replays from 
different camera angles, Testaverde appeared to have been stopped 
short of the goal line. And the Jets' descriptions of their early 
Christmas present sounded more grateful than convincing _ even Testaverde's. 
``The referee called it good,'' the Jets quarterback said. ``Sometimes 
you can't see. I felt like I was over.'' From near the Jets' bench, 
Parcells couldn't see whether Testaverde had scored or not, but he 
could see Frantz peering at the play from the same sideline. ``I saw 
the guy on the right signal immediately,'' Parcells said, meaning 
Frantz, ``so I thought he was in.'' Kevin Mawae, the Jets center who 
was blocking for Testaverde, also didn't insist that Testaverde had 
scored. ``Once the call is made, they very rarely call back a touchdown,'' 
Mawae said. ``Maybe that's another reason why instant replay would 
work.'' Mawae paused and added, ``For them,'' meaning the Seahawks. 
Instant replay, which the National Football League used as an officating 
tool from 1986 to 1991 to correct officials' mistakes, has been rejected 
every year since then in a vote of the clubs. Both the Jets and the 
Seahawks voted to reinstall it at last March's league meeting, but 
the 21-9 ``yes'' vote was 2 short of the required 75 percent. Considering 
Sunday outcome, the Jets must be delighted that instant replay was 
voted down; the Seahawks surely aren't. ``Obviously,'' said Seahawk 
Coach Dennis Erickson, ``it's something they're going to have to take 
a look at again.'' Some of his Seahawk players were not so diplomatic. 
Defensive end Michael Sinclair even invoked the Wizard of Oz. ``They,'' 
said Sinclair, referring to the officials, ``need to go see the the 
Wizard. No heart. No courage.'' You can't say no consistency, however. 
Luckett and his crew were the same seven officials who made several 
controversial calls in the Steelers-Lions game on Thanksgiving Day 
that in Detroit, including the overtime coin-toss fiasco. Steeler 
running back Jerome Bettis yelled ``tails,'' the coin came up ``tails'' 
but Luckett proclaimed that the Lions had won the toss. Asked if the 
N.F.L. office had said anything to Luckett's crew because of the coin-toss 
controversy as well as the controversial calls in New England's 25-21 
victory over Buffalo a week ago, Luckett said, ``I think you should 
take that up with the league office.'' Asked if they had been asked 
to do anything different, Luckett repeated the same answer. ``Even 
I looked over at the head linesman,'' Luckett said of the winning 
touchdown, ``and he had signaled well before the pileup of players 
so the decision had indeed been made.'' That decision sent the Jets 
soaring with a 9-4 record into their final three games, all against 
divisional opponents _ at Miami next Sunday night, at Buffalo on Saturday 
afternoon, and against the Patriots at Giants Stadium in their season 
finale on Dec. 27. If the Jets win all three games, they are assured 
of their first East Division title since the 1969 season. But the 
availability of Aaron Glenn, their Pro Bowl cornerback, is uncertain. 
After being beaten by Seahawk wide receiver Joey Galloway on touchdown 
passes of 70 and 57 yards, Glenn severely sprained his right ankle 
while intercepting another deep pass to Galloway in the second quarter. 
The Jets sounded secretive on the extent of Glenn's sprain. His right 
shoe off, Glenn rode a cart to the X-ray room. The Jets announced 
later that Glenn had a sprained ankle, but there was no X-ray report 
as such. When asked about Glenn later, the only word was that the 
Jets would know more about his condition today. Oddly enough, with 
Ray Mickens covering Galloway after Glenn departed, quarterback Jon 
Kitna threw only two more passes to Galloway, both incomplete. The 
Jets' defense blanked the Seahawks in the final quarter, enabling 
the offense to rally from a 31-19 deficit. ``Bill Belichick told me 
to mix things up on Galloway, to bump him and then play off him,'' 
Mickens said, referring to the Jets assistant coach and defensive 
guru. ``When Galloway sees bump, he goes fade. When he sees me off 
him, he goes short. ``In the last quarter, Pepper Johnson was telling 
us we had to win a game like this. And now the chips are stacked.'' 
Mickens meant the chips on the poker table that is now the Eastern 
Division of the American Football Conference, the chips that Mickens 
will be playing with if Glenn is out. And if the Jets go on to win 
their division and perhaps beyond, they will remember Earnie Frantz 
with fondness. Cast the head linesman's upraised arms in bronze. If 
not gold.
