Washington may claim the violence-plagued rule of Slobodan Milosevic 
is weakening, but the Yugoslav president's supporters and even some 
critics at home say he is as strong as ever. Ignoring U.S. pressure 
on his government, he is purging the police and military in apparent 
preparation for another major crackdown: this time on pro-independence 
elements in Montenegro, the small republic that with Serbia forms 
present-day Yugoslavia. The purge prompted State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin to declare last Monday that ``President Milosevic's 
grip on power is weakening.'' Rubin accused Milosevic of being ``at 
the center of every crisis'' during and since the breakup of the old 
Yugoslav federation. ``He is not simply part of the problem; Milosevic 
is the problem,'' the spokesman added. Washington has always blamed 
Milosevic for the ethnic conflicts in the Balkans, and it imposed 
diplomatic and economic sanctions on his government. But the Clinton 
administration has worked closely with him since 1995 trying to ensure 
a lasting peace in Bosnia, formerly a Yugoslav republic. Rubin's remarks 
led to news media speculation that Washington has concluded there 
can't be a secure peace with Milosevic in power and now is encouraging 
his ouster. Yet many of Milosevic's domestic allies and opponents 
alike agree that the Yugoslav president's rule is as strong as ever 
and that the recent sacking of his army chief, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, 
and secret police head, Jovica Stanisic, herald more trouble for the 
Balkans. Both Stanisic and Perisic were replaced by officers loyal 
to Milosevic's neo-communist wife, Mirjana Markovic. Her hard-line 
loyalists have recently assumed most top posts in Yugoslavia, further 
strengthening Milosevic. Milosevic has also moved against independent 
news media _ the only real source of information for most Yugoslavs 
_ by introducing harsh press laws and banning and closing newspapers 
and radio stations. He recently purged Belgrade University, the traditional 
center of rebellion, by sacking professors and replacing them with 
his supporters. Despite the new crackdown _ and unhappiness over Yugoslavia's 
deep economic problems _ there have been no street protests like those 
two years ago when Milosevic's rule was seriously shaken by three 
months of demonstrations. Those protests ended in a major disappointment 
for his opponents when their leaders split up over personal differences. 
Military and police purges have been common for Milosevic ahead of 
major actions against his opponents, and the latest ousters were a 
clear sign of his strength rather than weakness, his opponents say. 
``The purges seem to me like a reorganization of his ranks before 
a new offensive against Montenegro,'' said Montenegro's pro-Western 
president, Milo Djukanovic, a strong critic of Milosevic. Milosevic 
``has remained in power for years by engineering crisis,'' Djukanovic 
said. Elected last year over a Milosevic ally, Djukanovic has been 
targeted by state-run Yugsolav media, which regularly criticize his 
pro-Western, reformist and independent-minded views. Both Perisic 
and Stanisic had publicly opposed any crackdown on Montenegro, which 
many people fear would bring bloodshed like that previously in Bosnia, 
Croatia and Slovenia. ``Their sacking will have negative consequences 
for Montenegro,'' said Serbia's opposition leader, Vesna Pesic. Some 
people said the main Yugoslav problem is the lack of an alternative 
to Milosevic. ``The democratic changes in our country depend less 
on America than on the local population, which I'm not sure is fed 
up with Milosevic,'' said Dejan Anastasijevic, an analyst for the 
independent Belgrade weekly Vreme. Montenegro's deputy parliament 
spokesman, Predrag Popovic, agreed. He said Milosevic ``will not leave 
his duties soon, despite some announcements from Washington.'' Asked 
about the comments from Washington, Milosevic spokesman Ivica Dacic 
said: ``The hatred is mutual.'' Milosevic's ultra-nationalist ally, 
Vojislav Seselj, was even more blunt: ``Those supported by Americans 
have no chance in Serbia. There is a curse in Serbia: `Hope Americans 
support you in the elections.'''
