Amid pomp and pageantry, world leaders are marking the 50th anniversary 
this week of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But there 
is only limited room for celebration. Adopted in the aftermath of 
World War II, the declaration was intended to prevent a repetition 
of the horrors of the Holocaust and other atrocities. Beginning with 
the pronouncement that ``all human beings are born free and equal 
in dignity and rights,'' the United Nations document set out to cover 
the range of human existence. It has become at once the most quoted 
and most ignored international document of modern times. Since its 
inauguration on Dec. 10, 1948, millions of people have been denied 
their most basic right _ that of life _ as a result of massacres such 
as those in Cambodia, Rwanda and Bosnia. In many other countries, 
inhabitants can only dream of basic civil liberties. And the world 
is far from fulfilling the declaration's pronouncements on economic 
rights. ``Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate 
for the health and well-being of himself and his family,'' says Article 
25. According to U.N. figures, 1.5 billion people must get by on less 
than dlrs 1 a day. In South Asia, half of all children under 5 are 
malnourished. Only a third of the people in sub-Saharan Africa are 
likely to live past 40. ``The problem for the common people is that 
they don't understand their rights,'' said Sri Bintang Pamungkas, 
a former political prisoner in Indonesia. The declaration's 30 articles 
are short, between one and four sentences each. They proclaim the 
right to life and freedom from slavery and torture. They also spell 
out equality in marriage and divorce, freedom of religion and the 
right to education. In an effort to raise awareness of the declaration, 
human rights groups have spent the anniversary year staging street 
plays, pop concerts and school competitions to pass along its message. 
Official observances culminate this week in ceremonies Tuesday in 
Paris and Thursday in New York with world leaders like French President 
Jacques Chirac and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. There is consensus 
among activists that despite blatant violations of the declaration's 
principles, there has been progress. ``Even if it's not implemented, 
it's THE point of reference for governments and people around the 
world,'' said Isabelle Scherer of Amnesty International. Most advocates 
cited Britain's arrest and possible extradition of former Chilean 
dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain on charges of genocide and torture 
as evidence of a changing international mood. ``Pinochet's arrest 
makes a very nice 50th anniversary present,'' said Kenneth Roth, executive 
director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. Peter Thomas Burns, 
chairman of the U.N. committee on torture, said: ``Twenty years ago, 
dictators, when deposed, could look forward to a happy, comfortable 
retirement. International human rights law has caught up with them.'' 
U.N. organizations set up to monitor compliance with the declaration 
and related treaties meet frequently in Geneva. Although the bodies 
have little power other than to cajole or rebuke, rights advocates 
say their pressure makes a difference. Many Asian nations have long 
argued that human rights are a purely internal matter, but there are 
signs of changing attitudes. Both Indonesia and the Philippines criticized 
Malaysia's government this year over the detention of a former deputy 
prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim. Yet, while China recently signed a 
U.N. treaty on civil and political rights and maintains it respects 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it still punishes anyone 
who doesn't toe the official line. Many Chinese echo the government's 
position that national prosperity takes precedence over individual 
rights. ``First, we must have economic change. As the economy has 
developed over the past 20 years, people have more rights,'' a Chinese 
businessman, who gave his name as Mr. Wang, told a reporter. ``Twenty 
years ago, I could not be standing here talking to you.'' Although 
there has been increasing recognition of women's rights in U.N. documents, 
it has made little impact on the plight of millions of women in developing 
countries. In Kenya, for instance, growing economic hardship is blamed 
for a big increase in physical abuse of women. Women's groups there 
plan to mark the declaration's anniversary Thursday by putting husbands 
of battered women ``on trial'' to highlight the problem. The declaration 
has frequently served as an inspiration to the oppressed. Alexander 
Podrabinek, 46, who spent five years in Siberian exile during communist 
rule in the Soviet Union, said the declaration was long a touchstone 
for dissidents. He recalled how the KGB routinely confiscated copies 
of the document as ``anti-Soviet literature.'' Conditions are better 
now in Russia, but there are still widespread violations of human 
rights, he said, citing religious discrimination and appalling conditions 
in prisons. ``The broad public is largely unaware of the declaration,'' 
he added. ``But it remains some kind of a distant ideal.'' ___ EDITOR'S
