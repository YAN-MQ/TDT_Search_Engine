Dervis Eroglu, prime minister in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot, looked 
set to win elections after preliminary results Sunday showed him getting 
more than half of the 50 parliamentary seats. Eroglu's National Unity 
Party, managed to gain 26 seats after more than half of the votes 
were counted, the Turkish Cypriot news agency TAK reported. Eroglu 
has been heading a coalition government since 1996. But the preliminary 
results indicated that he was likely to be able to govern alone this 
time. The elections were mared by a row between President Rauf Denktash 
and an opposition center-left party who accused him of favoring center-right 
parties, and a disagreement over the island's membership in the European 
Union. On Saturday, Denktash called on voters to support center-right 
parties, which have opposed Turkish Cypriots joining in negotiations 
for the island's membership in the European Union. One of the parties 
is run by his son, Serdar Denktash. Some 121,000 voters were eligible 
to elect 50 lawmakers from among 352 candidates fielded by seven political 
parties in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was declared 
by Turkish Cypriots in 1983 and is recognized only by Turkey. The 
final, official results were expected on Monday. Denktash contends 
Cyprus' membership in the EU would amount to the island's integration 
with EU-member Greece. Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey 
sent in troops after a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. 
Turkish Cypriot opposition parties complain the election will be dominated 
by the large number of settlers from the Turkish mainland who have 
been given voting rights. A recent report by the European Union Commission 
put the number of recent settlers at 111,000 out of a total population 
of 200,000. Opposition parties claim that about half the candidates 
are settlers.
