Libya's Congress could hold the key to extraditing two suspects wanted 
in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. United Nations secretary-general 
Kofi Annan met with Libyan leader Moammar gadhafi yesterday. Although 
Gadhafi didn't hand over the suspects, Annan hopes they'll be handed 
over "in the not too distant future." Libya's people's Congress must 
approve any release of the bombing suspects. They're set to meet Tuesday, 
but it's not know whether the issue will be discussed. Libya's foreign 
minister says some procedural and legal matters must be settled before 
any release is made. A family member of one victim says he's tired 
of waiting. This is a proper procedure to allow things to go along 
and take a natural legal course. We're not looking to get innocent 
civilians killed by bombing, or anything like that. We feel that this 
is a proper, up this point. Beyond this point, it's been ten years, 
and my organization, and all the families of Pan Am 103, are getting 
fed up to here, and we will be pushing our Congress, and our Congress 
is listening to us, and they've done everything we've asked them to 
do. The 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270 people.
