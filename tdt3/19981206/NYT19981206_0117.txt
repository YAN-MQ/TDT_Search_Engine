Danielle Fotopoulos scored in the sixth minute to lead upstart Florida 
to a 1-0 upset on Sunday over two-time defending champion North Carolina 
in the National Collegiate Athletic Association women's soccer championship. 
Florida, which did not have a women's soccer program until four years 
ago, became the youngest program this decade to win a title, and Becky 
Burleigh became the first woman head coach to win an NCAA soccer championship. 
``I can't believe it,'' Burleigh said. ``I've been saying that from 
the sound of the horn until now. I just can't believe it.'' Fotopoulos, 
the nation's leading scorer this season and the NCAA's career leader 
in goals, was fouled during a run about 20 yards from the goal. Fotopoulos 
took the ensuing free kick, and the ball flew over four North Carolina 
defenders and hit the underside of the cross bar before bouncing in. 
``You couldn't ask for a better placed shot,'' said North Carolina 
goal keeper Siri Mullinix. ``I got a finger of my glove on it. I felt 
it, but I couldn't stop it.'' After that, in front of an NCAA record 
crowd of 10,583, Florida packed its defense so tightly that North 
Carolina _ winner of 14 of 17 NCAA championships _ rarely had room 
to maneuver. Florida (26-1) kept all 11 players on its end for 40 
of the 45 minutes in the second half. By playing so many players back, 
the Gators _ whose only loss this season was to North Carolina _ challenged 
every pass and every player, earning 31 fouls. When Florida could 
not win the ball and kick it far down field, the Gator defenders just 
looked to knock it over the sideline in order to run time off the 
clock. The start-and-stop pace suffocated a North Carolina offense 
that is known for its free-flowing style. ``To Carolina's advantage, 
they got a number of free kicks, but it really showed that we were 
there, doing whatever it took,'' Fotopoulos said. ``When you play 
hard like that, you get fouls.'' In the first half, North Carolina 
(25-1) had a three-to-one advantage in time of possession, and it 
became more one-sided in the second half. The key, however, was that 
the Tar Heels took just one shot from closer than 12 yards. North 
Carolina's best chances to tie came in the first half. On a corner 
kick in the 37th minute, defender Lori Fair settled the ball and fired 
from 18 yards, but it was right at Florida goalkeeper Meredith Flaherty, 
who knocked it over the end line. Five minutes later, North Carolina's 
Anne Remy took a 17-yard shot from left to right and Flaherty dove 
to knock it away. In the second half, North Carolina only saw one 
real scoring chance. Just into the 58th minute, Florida cleared the 
ball to midfield, but North Carolina's Laurie Schwoy immediately lofted 
it back to the penalty area. Florida was caught with its defenders 
moving forward as the ball floated back. North Carolina forward Cindy 
Parlow was in the area and headed a shot toward the right post, but 
Flaherty reacted and caught the shot. With eight saves in the championship 
games and shutouts in both Final Four games, Flaherty was named the 
tournament's most valuable defensive player. Only three goals were 
scored in the Final Four, a record low. Fotopoulis was named the most 
valuable offensive player.
