Opera star Luciano Pavarotti is teaming up with a wide variety of 
musical acts for his next project. Mark Scheerer has the story. Put 
away the good stemware. It's Luciano Pavarotti and Celine Dion going 
tonsil to tonsil. And by buying the CD or the video, you can help 
the war child organization build a children's village in war-torn 
Liberia. Where the kids are not just in a dormitory, but they are 
in a place where they are learning a profession. And that will be 
our dream if we can do that. It was in his hometown of modeno, Italy, 
last spring that the renowned tenor held another of his benefit concerts. 
And as he did in three previous shows raising money for leukemia research 
and the children of Bosnia, the maestro invited pop performers such 
as stevie wonder, trisha yearwood, Vanessa Williams, Jon Bon jovi 
-- and just days after geri "Ginger spice" halliwell had bolted, the 
four remaining spice girls. Not to worry. The three tenors, Pavarotti 
says, are still an active franchise. He's just announced that he'll 
perform at the opening of a new casino in las Vegas next spring. As 
he rehearsed recently for his 30th anniversary performance at the 
New York metropolitan opera, the 63-year-old Pavarotti was noticeably 
slimmed down from a reported high of 350 pounds and recovering from 
a knee operation and hip replacement. I feel completely new, and last 
night on the stage of the met, I did have a Beautiful gratification. 
a review of his performance, although highly complimentary, said of 
late he "has been struggling vocally and coasting, sometimes shamelessly, 
on his fame." When a critic says you've been coasting over the past 
couple of years, how does that make you feel? Probably that is the 
result that he saw. I think being sick is different. Probably the 
result is the same. I was sick. And now I am not. There are some who 
wonder if, perhaps, that performance might be your last on the met 
stage or any other stage. Do they worry needlessly? They say this 
is already 15 years, they say that. My voice will decide. And the 
audience. Right. Why quit now? When he could become the fifth spice 
girl. Nicknamed -- Chubby spice. What else? Mark Scheerer, "CNN Entertainment 
News," New York.
