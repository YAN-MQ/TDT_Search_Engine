The Mormon church is changing its policy on birth control. Past presidents 
condemned artificial birth control as a means of limiting the size 
of a family. The new handbook of the church of Jesus Christ of latter 
day saints now says the number of children a couple has is a private 
matter. Mormons are also being counseled that sexual activity within 
marriage is approved for more than just procreation.
