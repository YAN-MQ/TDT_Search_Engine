Oscar Niyiragira would love more than anything for his family to be 
able to go home to Burundi, but returning to his ethnically segregated 
homeland would mean almost certain death. Instead, Niyiragira, his 
wife and their four children are among 228 mixed-marriage refugees 
from Burundi and Rwanda who headed Sunday for a new life in the United 
States. Niyiragira is a Burundian Hutu. His wife Regine Katabarwa 
is a Tutsi. For their four children, no place in Burundi, split by 
ethnic civil war, would be safe. ``You know, this one is neither Hutu 
nor Tutsi,'' Niyiragira said of the three-year-old son sitting on 
his lap. ``He's mixed. So there is nowhere he can find peace. If he 
goes on the side of the Tutsis, he'll be killed. If he goes into Hutuland, 
he'll be killed.'' In both Rwanda and Burundi, Tutsis are minorities 
with Hutus making up more than 80 percent of the population. The families, 
which represent only a handful of the more than 250,000 Burundian 
and 6,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania, were recommended for repatriation 
in the United States by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The 
United States, which has agreed to take in 12,000 African refugees 
for its 1998-99 fiscal year, opened its doors. ``Their options for 
Tanzania were very limited: they can't go home and in Tanzania they 
would remain under refugee status,'' said Kevin Richardson, U.S. Refugee 
Coordinator for East Africa. To be accepted, the refugees at the Mkugwa 
camp in northwestern Tanzania underwent screening by a U.S. immigration 
officer, and medical tests to see if they were free of contagious 
diseases. Two tested positive for AIDS and were excluded, according 
to the International Organization for Migration, a multi-state agency 
contracted by the U.S. government to handle the move. The agency then 
gave them a brief cultural orientation course about what to expect 
in America, ranging from the need for a driver's license to racism 
against blacks. On Wednesday, seven buses carrying the refugees left 
Mkugwa for Mwanza in northern Tanzania, where they received medication, 
clothing and shoes. On Sunday evening, the first planeload of 57 refugees 
flew to Nairobi, Kenya and then to John F. Kennedy airport in New 
York. From there, they would head to final destinations across the 
United States. ``If I can get to a country where there is peace, I 
think I can stay there and continue my life,'' said Burundian-born 
Emmanuel Sibomana in halting English. ``It is an extraordinary opportunity.'' 
Sibomana, 33, is a wood carver. His Hutu family fled Burundi's civil 
war in 1972 and settled in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, where he met 
his Tutsi wife and had a son. But the 1994 Hutu government-sponsored 
Rwandan genocide of more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus 
sent the young family into exile, first to the former Zaire, and finally, 
Tanzania. He is going to Washington, D.C. Niyiragira fled Burundi 
in 1993, after Tutsi paratroopers killed the country's first democratically 
elected president. Bloodletting between the Tutsi military and Hutu 
rebels has since killed more than 200,000 Burundians. They fled to 
the former Zaire, but had to leave when war broke out there in 1996. 
``I was hated by both sides. I had nowhere to go, no one to talk to, 
so I decided to leave,'' said Niyiragira. Thrilled to be going to 
Louisville, Kentucky, he regrets leaving his native home. ``It makes 
me a bit sick because my children are going to lose all my culture,'' 
he said. ``But I am happy because they are going far away from that 
stupid war, that hatred.''
