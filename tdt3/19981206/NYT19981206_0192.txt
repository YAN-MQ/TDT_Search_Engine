George Van Eps, a guitarist who played with some of the biggest names 
in jazz and pioneered the seven-string guitar, died on Nov. 29 at 
Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 
85 and lived in Huntington Beach , Calif. His family said the cause 
was pneumonia. The seven-string guitar, which Van Eps helped popularize, 
allowed him to use his harmonic imagination. The seventh string, added 
in the bass, gave him the ability to play more orchestrally, adding 
bass lines below the chord, and making the guitar a more convincing 
solo instrument. Van Eps referred to the guitar as his lap piano. 
Though his career started early in jazz history, his quiet sophistication 
never received the attention received by the guitarists Django Reinhardt, 
Charlie Christian and their followers. But he did have several important 
students, including the guitarists Ron Eschete, from Louisiana, and 
Howard Alden and Bucky Pizzarelli, from New York. Van Eps came from 
a musical family, with his mother, father and brothers all playing; 
George Gershwin was a regular guest in the house. He began professionally 
at the age of 11 in New Jersey and he performed for six months with 
an early idol, the guitarist Eddie Lang, in the Smith Ballew band. 
During the 1930s, Van Eps worked with Freddy Martin, Benny Goodman 
and Ray Noble. In 1938 Van Eps, who had recently moved to California, 
went to the Epiphone guitar company to broaden the palette of his 
instrument, adding the seventh string. He then spent much of the next 
several decades working in recording studios, in part for the 1950s 
film and television series ``Pete Kelly's Blues.'' He recorded occasionally 
for Capitol records during the 1960s; in the 1970s an illness, and 
an accident that injured his hand, took him off the music scene for 
a while. But in the 1990s he surfaced with a series of fine records 
for Concord Jazz, recording with Alden, and an album with the guitarist 
Johnny Smith. He is survived by a daughter, Kay Van Eps of Huntington 
Beach.
