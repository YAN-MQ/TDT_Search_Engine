Most towns would not be happy with a mayor who sneaks around at night, 
whose dealings smell a bit fishy and who shows no signs of fulfilling 
a Campaign promise. But the folks in guffey, Colorado, are very content

of guffey. He does come with a human co-mayor. And the townspeople 
say the two work well together.
