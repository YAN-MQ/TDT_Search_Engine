Police in Gibraltar arrested a far-right leader and six other rightists 
after they replaced a British flag with a Spanish one to press their 
claims that Spain should be sovereign over its former colony, authorities 
said Sunday. Ricardo Saenz de Ynestrillas, 33, who leads the far-right 
Alliance for National Unity, was held at the police station in the 
British colony of Gibraltar. The rest of the detained were not identified. 
``The flag that waves there is not the right one,'' AUN spokeswoman 
Marisa Alonso said. ``It should be ours.'' Gibraltar, situated on 
Spain's southern tip, has bedeviled relations between Spain and Britain 
since the land was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 
1713.
