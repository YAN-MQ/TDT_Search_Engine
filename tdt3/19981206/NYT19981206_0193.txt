It took a dramatic Saturday of upsets that left just one major team 
unbeaten, but the inaugural Bowl Championship Series fulfilled its 
mission of bringing a clear-cut title game to college football Sunday 
when it matched the undefeated Tennessee Volunteers and the once-beaten 
but surging Florida State Seminoles in the Fiesta Bowl. Still, no 
one is happy. Not the coaches, Phillip Fulmer of Tennessee and Bobby 
Bowden of Florida State, who will play in the primetime Jan. 4 title 
tilt in Tempe, Ariz. Not Ohio State Coach John Cooper, whose Buckeyes 
(10-1) are in the Sugar Bowl but have no shot for the title. And especially 
not the faithful fans of Kansas State (11-1), who are still upset 
that their Wildcats were one successful play from the Fiesta Bowl 
but are now locked out of the BCS bowls, and a $12 million payday, 
and are on their way instead to San Antonio and a date with Purdue 
(8-4) in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 29. In fact, on the day the major 
bowl matchups were announced amid nationally televised fanfare, college 
football's coaches renewed their cry for a playoff system. ``Tennessee 
came in through the front door,'' said Bowden, whose Seminoles (10-1) 
leaped over UCLA and Kansas State, both losers of thrilling games 
on Saturday, to get a shot at the title. ``We came in the back door. 
Now we're going to face them in the middle of the road.'' Bowden, 
who said he has been an opponent of a playoff, added: ``I've had a 
feeling in the last two weeks we re getting closer to a playoff because 
I heard so many scenarios. There are some other teams that maybe deserve 
this more than us. I think maybe we should have a four-team playoff.'' 
Tennessee's Fulmer, who has the only undefeated team in the top five 
of the B.C.S. ranking, indicated that the new system was fortunate 
this year. ``My feeling is that there should be a playoff at some 
point,'' Fulmer said. ``It worked itself out this year, and it's better 
than it has been in the past.'' Ohio State's Cooper was more pointed 
in his call for a playoff. ``I think I can make the argument we are 
one of the top two teams in the country,'' said Cooper, whose 10-1 
Buckeyes lost to Michigan State late in the season. ``We were No. 
1 for nine weeks.'' The Buckeyes will go to New Orleans to play Texas 
A&AMP;M (11-2), which opened the door to the Fiesta Bowl for Florida 
State with a 36-33 double-overtime victory over Kansas State. ``It 
wouldn't bother me to see the top eight teams go play it out,'' Cooper 
said. ``It wouldn't bother me to have a one-game playoff after this 
bowl game is over.'' But no one was more irate than Kansas State University 
President Jon Wefald, who saw his school's only defeat, in perhaps 
the best college football game of the year, knock it out of the limelight 
despite a No. 3 ranking in the final B.C.S. standing. ``How can we 
go from being 1 point away, one play away, from playing Tennessee 
for the national championship, to playing Purdue in the Alamo Bowl?'' 
Wefald said to The Associated Press. ``I guess the BCS rankings only 
mean something for the top two teams. That's not right. That's something 
they have to change.'' Still, organizers of the ranking system, which 
was intended to identify the top two teams in the country and make 
sure they played each other for the national championship, insisted 
they did their job. The complicated BCS formula, which took into account 
the Associated Press news media poll and USA Today/ESPN coaches poll, 
three computer rankings including that of The New York Times, and 
teams' strength of schedule, came up with two teams everyone agreed 
on. Tennessee was the top pick in the news media and coaches polls 
and Florida State, which the BCS formula determined played the nation's 
fourth-toughest schedule, was the consensus No. 2. The computer rankings 
_ including the one by The New York Times, which had Florida State 
ahead of Tennessee _ concurred on the top two teams. ``I don't think 
there is any question about it,'' said the BCS chairman, Roy Kramer. 
``Florida State deserves to be there. Tennessee deserves to be there 
on all the criteria we used. That's all we were trying to do is establish 
the 1-2 game. The other selections are up to individual bowls.'' And 
that is what banished Kansas State to a minor bowl. The Rose Bowl 
retained its traditional flavor and matched the Big 10 and Pacific-10 
champions, Wisconsin and UCLA. The Orange Bowl, which had to invite 
Syracuse (8-3) as champion of the Big East, then exercised its freedom 
of choice and snubbed Kansas State to invite Florida (9-2). The Orange 
Bowl's executive director, Keith Tribble, conceded economics were 
the reason. ``It was in our best interests to put the game that was 
best for us together,'' Tribble said. ``It's strictly up to the bowls 
what is in our best interests in putting together a good matchup that 
has fan interest.'' The Orange Bowl opted for a Florida team that 
has not been to the Miami-based bowl since 1967, when Gator Coach 
Steve Spurrier was quarterback, to offset what it believed would be 
modest ticket sales from Syracuse fans. Spurrier, a playoff proponent 
who is hardly known for compassion, was the first to offer empathy 
for Kansas State fans. ``I feel really sad for Kansas State,'' he 
said. ``That game was the biggest thing in their school history and 
now they're up there with not much of anything but a bowl trip.'' 
Florida State's Bowden, who had to wait while first UCLA and then 
Kansas State lost on Saturday to give his team the trip to Tempe, 
seemed befuddled by his good fortune. ``I've never accomplished so 
much doing nothing and just sitting on the couch,'' he said.
