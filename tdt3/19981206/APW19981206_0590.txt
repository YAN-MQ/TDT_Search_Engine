Police on Sunday rounded up some 200 members of a pro-Kurdish party 
who began a three-day hunger strike to protest a police crackdown 
on their party. The strikers were taking part in a nationwide protest 
by the People's Democracy Party, HADEP, to denounce police raids on 
party buildings and the arrest of their leader, Murat Bozlak, said 
party official Mehmet Nuri Gunes. The protestors were taken away during 
hunger strikes in Istanbul, in northwestern Tekirdag and in three 
southeastern cities, Gunes said. Police has been tough on the party 
since the detention in Rome last month of rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah 
Ocalan. Thousands of HADEP members protesting Turkish demands for 
his extradition were taken into custody over the past weeks. Most 
were later released, but some 300 of them, including Bozlak, have 
been formally arrested on charges of separatist propaganda. Ocalan's 
group has been fighting for autonomy in the southeast since 1984 in 
a war that has claimed 37,000 lives.
