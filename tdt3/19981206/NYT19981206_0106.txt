``In those days, as a little child,'' wrote the English poet John 
Masefield, ``I was living in Paradise, and had no need of the arts, 
that at best are only a shadow of Paradise.'' A paradise childhood 
may well be, but occasionally grown-ups must intrude, especially at 
bedtime, and one of the ways we do this is with picture books, which, 
while mere shadows of paradise, are good for easing the way to bed. 
The following are the 10 best I found this year, arranged approximately 
from the most simple to the most complex. FIRE TRUCK, by Peter Sis. 
(Greenwillow Books; $14.95.) A boy named Matt loves firetrucks so 
much that one day when he wakes up, he is one. ``He drove around his 
neighborhood with sirens blaring. He raced down the road. He rescued 
a cat. He put out a fire. He saved a teddy bear.'' Then when he smells 
pancakes he changes back into a little boy and eats his breakfast. 
Peter Sis illustrates Matt's obsession in colors that are mostly fire-engine 
red. SNOW, by Uri Shulevitz. (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux; $16.) In 
a gray town, a single snowflake falls. The grown-ups say it means 
nothing, but more snowflakes come. Gradually, as the town turns white, 
you feel the child-eyed wonder of a snowfall and the coooooold. BALLPARK, 
by Elisha Cooper. (Greenwillow Books; $15.) Baseball may be a nine-inning 
game to you, but to the ballpark it's also a red tractor mowing the 
outfield grass, a forklift moving boxes of peanuts, a dryer spitting 
out hot uniforms and a furry animal running out on the field. Cooper 
catches it all here in whimsical watercolors. PETE'S A PIZZA, by William 
Steig. (Michaelo Di Capua Books/HarperCollins Publishers; $13.95.) 
In which Pete is teased out of the rainy-day grumps by being made 
into a pizza by his dad. In the process the ``dough gets tickled'' 
and ``laughs like crazy.'' When it's time to be sliced, the pizza 
runs away but gets captured and hugged. ``Now the sun has come out. 
And so the pizza decides to go look for his friends.'' Pete holding 
himself stiff as a crust while being carried to the oven-couch is 
alone enough to make you laugh. PAINTED DREAMS, by Karen Lynn Williams, 
pictures by Catherine Stock. (Lothrop, Lee &AMP; Shepard Books/William 
Morrow &AMP; Co.; $16.) Eight-year-old Ti Marie dreams of making pictures 
of ``huge green trees that would wrap the whole village in cool shade,'' 
if only she had paints like those of Msie Antoine, the local voodoo 
priest and healer. When she eventually improvises a solution, she 
proves that her art has commercial value as well as beauty. As does 
the art of this appealing book. A BAD CASE OF STRIPES, by David Shannon. 
(Blue Sky Press/Scholastic Inc.; $15.95.) Although Camilla Cream loves 
lima beans, she won't ever eat them because all her friends hate them 
and she longs to fit in. One morning she wakes up covered with brightly 
colored stripes, which don't go away until she eats the lima beans 
brought to her by a sweet old woman. ``I knew the real you was in 
there somewhere,'' the woman tells Camilla at the end of this delicious 
visual metaphor for the disease of caring too much about what others 
think of you. OVER THE MOON, by Rachel Vail, illustrated by Scott 
Nash. (Orchard Books; $15.95.) In her first three tries, the Mother 
Goose cow jumps under, next to and through the moon. ``It's my nursery 
rhyme,'' says the monkey-writer-director, Hiram Diddle Diddle. ``Can 
we please? Or do we need to bring in a stunt cow?'' ``No, no,'' says 
the cow. ``I need this job! I got calves to feed. I can do it. OVER 
the moon, right?'' And so it goes in this backstage tale of heartbreak 
and triumph starring also a cat with a Stradivarius, a dachshund that 
goes ``Ha!'' and a flighty dish and spoon. THE ISLAND-BELOW-THE-STAR, 
by James Rumford. (Houghton Mifflin Co.; $15.) Vibrant, engaging watercolors 
reveal how five brothers set out from a tiny South Pacific island 
for a new island they believe must lie under a brightly shining star. 
Surviving a vicious five-day storm, they sight a bird that leads them 
to what a concluding note explains are the Hawaiian Islands, lying 
below the star Arcturus, which are believed to have been discovered 
more than 1,500 years ago by explorers from the Marquesas Island, 
2,500 miles to the south. BLACK COWBOY, WILD HORSES: A True Story, 
by Julius Lester and Jerry Pinkney. (Dial Books/Penguin Putnam Inc.; 
$16.99.) In a land ``stretching as wide as love in every direction,'' 
the cowboy Bob Lemmons picks up and follows the trail of a pack of 
mustangs, the wild horses that live on the Western plains. With their 
poetic text and theatrical watercolors, Lester and Pinkney bring to 
life a true story based on the life of a black cowboy mentioned in 
``The Adventures of the Negro Cowboys,'' by Philip Durham, and ``The 
Mustangs,'' by Everett Jones and J. Frank Dobie. The thunder of hoofbeats 
pounds on the page. INTO THE ICE: The Story of Arctic Exploration, 
by Lynn Curlee. (Houghton Mifflin Co.; $16.) A concise history of 
Arctic exploration, from St. Brendan's encounter with an iceberg in 
the North Atlantic about A.D. 550 to the flight a millennium later 
of Joseph Fletcher, the U.S. Air Force pilot who landed at the North 
Pole in 1952 and whose claim to have stood at the pole was the first 
to go undisputed. The author's arctic landscapes are as clean and 
cool and inviting as polar ice with a topping of azure.
