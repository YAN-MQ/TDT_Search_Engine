An imprisoned animal rights activist is near death on the 60th day 
of a hunger strike to demand a government-appointed inquiry into experiments 
using animals, The Observer newspaper reported Sunday. The newspaper, 
which said it smuggled a tape into the hospital, described Nigel Horne, 
46, as almost blind, deaf in one ear, and with his internal organs 
disintegrating. Horne's militant group, the Animal Liberation Front, 
said he would be Britain's first martyr of animal rights. His claim 
to martyrdom, however, provoked sharp criticism from owners of stores 
attacked by Horne in a series of bombing campaigns to highlight garments 
or cosmetics in which animal skins or animal testing was used. Horne, 
a former garbage collector, was jailed for 18 years in 1997 for a 
bombing stores in south England and causing millions of pounds (dollars) 
worth of damage. Stores hit included Boots, a nationwide drug chain, 
and a charity shop in aid of cancer research. ``I want to die. This 
is the end. In death you win,'' The Observer quoted Horne as saying 
from his bed in a hospital in York, 180 miles (300 kms) north of London. 
Sports shop owner Nigel Young, whose store on the Isle of Wight off 
the English south coast was destroyed by fire, said Horne's attack 
was attempted murder. Horne has been on two previous hunger strikes 
_ one lasting 35 days and one 46 days. He is demanding that the 19-month-old 
Labor Party government implement a pledge in its election manifesto 
to appoint an inquiry into animal testing. The government recently 
banned the use of animals in the testing of cosmetics. Most experiments 
with animals are for research into drugs, including treatments for 
cancer and heart failure. The Home Office, which oversees animal experimentation, 
urged Horne to give up his hunger strike but said it would not bow 
to blackmail.
