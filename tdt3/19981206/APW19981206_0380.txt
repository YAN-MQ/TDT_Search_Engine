Ethnic militants hurled hand grenades at a police station and traded 
gunfire with Pakistani security forces in the southern port city of 
Karachi on Sunday, killing at least one civilian and wounding two 
policemen. Police believe the men belonged to the ethnic Muttahida 
Qami Movement (MQM). The militants also set fire to more than a dozen 
shops in central Liquatabad area to protest a government-run cleanup 
operation by security force, the police said. The violent protest 
spun out of control as militants hurled grenades at a police station 
and sent neighboring residents scurrying for cover. The militants 
set stores on fire and took over control of the entire neighborhood, 
while police tried to quell the violence, officials said. The area 
is a stronghold of the largest MQM faction led by exiled leader Altaf 
Hussein. The MQM, which claims to represent Urdu speaking immigrants 
to Pakistan after 1947, is fighting for political and economic concessions 
from the government. Its members are heavily armed. In an attempt 
to end the relentless violence in Karachi, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 
last month dismissed the government there, imposed federal rule, suspended 
civil rights and brought in the army to arrest and try suspected terrorists. 
The government also brought in disarmament experts from Colombia to 
help collect an estimated 11,000 illegal weapons in the city. Armed 
men battled police throughout Sunday. They were positioned on rooftops 
and in narrow lanes. Police and paramilitary rangers surrounded the 
area. Residents were hunkered down inside their homes afraid to go 
outside. The ethnic violence in Karachi has left more than 1,000 people 
dead so far this year. Sharif took the extreme measures of imposing 
federal rule after a former governor, Hakim Said, was gunned down. 
Sharif blamed members of Hussein's MQM group. The MQM denies the charge 
and accuses the government of ``state-sponsored terrorism'' against 
its ethnic group. The MQM, formerly known as the Mohajir Qami Movement, 
is locked in a bloody conflict with its dissident faction known as 
the Haqiqi faction.
