With the latest Mideast peace accord on hold, Israel and the Palestinians 
exchanged angry accusations Sunday over Jewish settlements and street 
clashes. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, warned 
of possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish 
a state. ``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance 
are open,'' Qureia, who is also known as Abu Ala, told reporters in 
the West Bank town of Ramallah. Since the signing of a land-for-security 
accord, Jewish settlers have accelerated the establishment of makeshift 
communities on West Bank hilltops, to keep the land from being turned 
over to the Palestinians. After an attack on an Israeli soldier by 
a Palestinian mob in the West Bank last week, Israel announced it 
was suspending the accord until the Palestinians stopped violating 
the agreement. Israel's Channel 2 TV reported Sunday that Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from hard-liners who threatened 
to bolt his government over the accord, had secretly agreed to freeze 
the deal days before the attack took place and use Palestinian violations 
as an excuse. The report said that Nissim Smolianski, a member of 
the National Religious Party, told Netanyahu that if he went ahead 
with further West Bank troop withdrawals as agreed upon in the latest 
Mideast peace accord, the NRP would topple the government. Smolianski 
refused to comment directly on the report. Protests and street clashes 
last week grew out of an increasingly bitter dispute over Palestinian 
prisoners held by Israel. Israel last month freed 250 of 750 prisoners 
it is to release under the Wye accords, but most were criminals. The 
Palestinians are demanding that so-called security prisoners _ those 
being held for anti-Israel activity _ be released instead. U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands, which is 
to begin Saturday, is meant to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered 
peace accords and encourage both sides to stick to a timetable for 
compliance. But some commentators suggested the visit was proving 
a polarizing force instead. ``He is coming to promote the peace process... 
but his visit's only actual result is a sharpening of the differences,'' 
Yosef Lapid wrote in Sunday's editions of the Maariv newspaper. In 
Israel, increasing concern is being voiced over Clinton's planned 
visit to Gaza, the first ever by a sitting U.S. president. At Sunday's 
Israeli Cabinet meeting, a shouting match broke out over the issue, 
according to Israel radio. ``Who invited President Clinton to the 
Gaza Strip?'' Silvan Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled 
at Netanyahu. Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his. 
The United States has repeatedly said the visit is not intended as 
an endorsement of Palestinian statehood, but the Palestinians see 
it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty hopes.
