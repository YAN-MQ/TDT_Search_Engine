A former Rwandan army officer implicated in the murder of 22 children 
and young people during the 1994 massacres of some 500,000 Rwandans 
has been given political asylum in Britain, The Sunday Times reported. 
Lt. Col. Tharcisse Muvunyi, under investigation by a U.N. tribunal, 
is living on welfare with his wife and three children in south London, 
is studying English at college, and has permission to stay until 2002, 
the newspaper said. Britain's Home Office, which handles asylum, refused 
to comment. A spokeswoman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, 
told the AP that all applications for and grants of political asylum 
were confidential. Muvunyi is accused by the U.N. Tribunal of ordering 
the rounding up of the youngsters from the Benebikira convent in the 
southwestern Rwandan town of Butare on April 30, 1994. Nuns had hidden 
the youngsters, aged between five and 22, and most of whom had seen 
their parents slaughtered in the killings organized by the Hutsi-dominated 
government. The victims were mainly members of the Tutsi ethnic minority. 
Sunday Times reporter Jon Swain quoted nuns still at the now dilapidated 
convent as saying that soldiers burst in on the morning of April 30. 
Sister Marie Juvenal Mukamurama was quoted as saying that when she 
demanded to know on whose authority the youngsters were being taken, 
a lieutenant handed her a paper signed ``Col. Muvunyi.'' It carried 
the words in French: ``Seizure of all people and suspicious objects.'' 
The newspaper quoted Muvunyi as saying from his London home that he 
was ``not aware'' of giving orders to search the convent. He maintained 
he had tried to prevent the genocide and, in particular, had provided 
a retired bishop and several priests with a military escort through 
road blocks mounted by by militia wielding machetes. ``I tried to 
protect the religious centers,'' Muvunyi is quoted as saying. Trials 
of Rwandam genocide suspects are going on both in Rwandan courts and 
before a U.N. tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania. The Sunday Times said 
the tribunal had been unaware that Muvunyi was in Britain. The tribunal 
has 32 suspects in custody. Two have been sentenced to life in prison, 
the maximum sentence the tribunal can impose. Although British officials 
made no comment, extradition of Muvunyi to appear before the tribunal 
would appear at least possible because the U.N. body cannot impose 
the death sentence. Britain and other European Union countries will 
not extradite anyone who could be sentenced to death. Rwanda's crowded 
jails hold 130,000 genocide suspects, most of them Hutus. So far, 
more than 350 people have been tried and at least 120 have been sentenced 
to death. Firing squads executed 22 people on April 24.
