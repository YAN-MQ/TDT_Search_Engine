The verdict came down early this morning, guilty of first-degree assault, 
for a Missouri man who intentionally injected his baby son with the 
AIDS virus. Prosecutors said he did it to get out of paying child 
support. ABC's dean Reynolds is in St. Louis. 32-year-old Brian Stewart 
had long claimed he was the victim of circumstantial evidence, that 
the mother of his child with whom he'd had a Fleeting affair, and 
her drug-abusing friends and relatives may have infected Stewart's 
son with the virus that causes AIDS. Defense counsel Joe Murphy -- 
I.V. drug users were using heroin, crack, cocaine intravenously in 
the home. But the problem with that defense was that none of the drug 
users, including the boy's aunt, was ever found to have HIV, much 
less aids. We, the jury, find the defendant, Brian T. Stewart, guilty 
of assault. The jury was evidently persuaded that the monstrous charge 
against Stewart was true, that in 1992, he knowingly injected his 
11-month-old baby boy with HIV-Tainted blood obtained from the lab 
where he worked. That he believed it would quickly prove fatal and 
that it would free him from paying child support. He said, "don't 
worry about it. I just know that he's not going to live to see the 
age of 5." The boy's mother says her son has rallied at times, thanks 
to a Combination of the daily treatments. While the court kept his 
identity secret, he is known to be 7 years old, hearing-impaired because 
of the disease. Although the trial's over and the one responsible 
for this inhumane crime has been brought to justice, it gives no relief 
to the fact that my son has been robbed of a normal childhood. The 
jury recommended life in prison for Brian Stewart. He evidently intends 
to appeal their verdict. As for his son, doctors here at children's 
hospital say the boy's condition has worsened recently. And his mother 
says without some medical advance, the boy may be doomed. Dean Reynolds,
