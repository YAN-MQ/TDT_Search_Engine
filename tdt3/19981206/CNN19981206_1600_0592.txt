In August, more than 200 Kenyans died in the bombing of the American 
embassy in Nairobi. Now, some widows have found that compensation 
from the Kenyan government has brought trouble along with help. Catherine 
bond reports. The August bomb blast in Nairobi widowed Nancy kinuthia, 
whose husband, Simon, was an accounts clerk in ufundi house, the office 
building which collapsed, crushing more than 90 people. "I just kept 
thinking how it was going to change my life," she says. "I kept thinking 
how I was going to manage to bring up my children." In compensation 
for her husband's death, Nancy received the equivalent of about 2,000 
U.S. dollars from a Kenyan disaster fund -- money she's needed to 
feed her seven children and keep some of them in school. It's also 
money her relatives wanted for themselves. When this money came, a 
lot of people thought that it could be shared. But the widows, most 
of them, did not share this money. Instead of comforting her, Nancy's 
mother-in-law and sister-in-law tried to claim her husband's body, 
which meant that traditionally, they, and not his wife, would inherit 
his plot of land and the compensation, too. Thinking compensation 
meant widows had money to burn, many landlords hiked rents. Eight 
months pregnant, Nancy has moved out of two rooms into just one, where 
she and her children sleep on bunk beds. The last Julius and Andrew 
saw of their father was when he put them on a Bus to their grandmother's 
before going to work the morning of the bombing. News of his death 
came days later. It was on a Wednesday. The red cross says it's now, 
several months on, that families of bomb victims are really beginning 
to feel the pinch. And it's thinking about launching another appeal 
to help families like this who lost their only breadwinner. Catherine 
bond, CNN, Nairobi, Kenya.
