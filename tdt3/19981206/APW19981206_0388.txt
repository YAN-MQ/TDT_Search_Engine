Palestinian police said Sunday they had launched a campaign to confiscate 
illegal weapons, an important provision of the new peace accord. A 
statement by Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jabali, calling on people 
to turn in their illegal arms and warning that those who did not would 
be brought to trial, ran on the front pages of three Palestinian daily 
newspapers. In Gaza, Jabali said the police were taking steps to collect 
unlicensed weapons, but would not provide any details. A crackdown 
on illegal arms _ which are rife in the Palestinian lands _ is one 
of the security pledges made by the Palestinians as part of the U.S.-brokered 
Wye River accord signed in October. The Palestinians say they are 
continuing to implement the accord's provisions, although Israel has 
threatened to scrap a promised troop pullback this month unless the 
Palestinians meet new conditions. In addition to collecting unlicensed 
guns, the Palestinians have promised to put a legal framework in place 
for importing, manufacturing, selling and possessing weapons. The 
United States is to assist in this.
