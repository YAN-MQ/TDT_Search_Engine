Animal rights activists plan to picket the German embassy in Pretoria 
on Monday to protest plans to export seven allegedly mistreated elephants 
to zoos in Erfurt and Dresden. People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals (PETA) said in a statement Sunday that it would also demonstrate 
at other German embassies if the shipment is carried out. ``Germany 
had better prepare for riots outside its embassies worldwide if even 
one elephant is put on a transport to Germany,'' said Jane Garrison 
of PETA. ``These are Africa's treasures.'' The California-based Garrison 
has been monitoring a court battle in the small town of Brits near 
Pretoria, where a judge last week ruled that 30 young elephants were 
being cruelly treated. Judge Herman Glas upheld his earlier ruling 
and awarded temporary custody to the National Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Animals. Despite the court's ruling, the elephants' 
owner, animal exporter Riccardo Ghiazza, is expected to ask Glas Monday 
morning for permission to ship seven of the elephants to Germany, 
according to NSPCA executive director Marcelle French. Ghiazza is 
also expected to appeal the custody ruling at the High Court in Pretoria 
on Monday. The fate of the 30 baby elephants snatched from their families 
in Botswana in August has sparked worldwide interest. Last week, French 
actress Brigitte Bardot, an animal rights activist, joined Britain's 
Spice Girls pop group and rocker Chrissie Hynde in appeals to President 
Nelson Mandela to protect the elephants. ``This has become of public 
interest and is not private interest anymore,'' Glas said last week. 
The judge cited particular concern about seven baby elephants who 
had abscesses on their heads from being prodded by sharp instruments 
as part of training to prepare them for captivity. The trainers hobbled 
them and deprived them of water, NSPCA officials testified during 
the hearings. Impatient with the legal maneuverings, French called 
Ghiazza's moves ``ridiculous.'' ``This was an urgent application in 
October,'' French said. ``They are just stalling.'' There is some 
question about where the NSPCA can take the elephants. Two of three 
game ranches have withdrawn previous agreement to receive some of 
the elephants, according to the Rhino and Elephant Foundation, a conservation 
group that has backed Ghiazza. French also said that two of the provinces 
where the game ranches were located have refused to issue permits 
to allow the elephants into their territory.
