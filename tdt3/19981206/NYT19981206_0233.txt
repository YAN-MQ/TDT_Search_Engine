Gov. George Pataki appeared Sunday on the ABC News program ``This 
Week'' at the network's studios in Manhattan, which have been the 
focal point of a labor dispute involving 2,200 broadcast technicians 
and other employees locked out by management for nearly five weeks. 
The union, the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, 
has been able to discourage some public figures and celebrities _ 
including Vice President Al Gore, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and, most 
recently, boxer George Foreman _ from appearing on ABC News programs 
since the lockout began on Nov. 2. Patrick McCarthy, a spokesman for 
Pataki, said the governor's appearance did not indicate any position 
on the labor dispute and that Pataki continued to hope for a speedy 
settlement. Pickets said the governor's car appeared to circle the 
block on which the studio is located, West 66th Street, to find a 
door to the building with the fewest pickets. Union members said there 
were at least three pickets at the entrance when Pataki arrived and 
at least four pickets at an exit when the governor left the studio. 
McCarthy said the governor ``entered a door where there were no picketers.'' 
``I said, `Pataki, you're crossing a picket line' and he just did 
this,'' said Alicia Chenoa, 44, a picketing graphic artist, demonstrating 
a small hand wave she said the governor made as he entered the building. 
``What a wimp! I mean, they case the place to find the fewest people,'' 
she said.
