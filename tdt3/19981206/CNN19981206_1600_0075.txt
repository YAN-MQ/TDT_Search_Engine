The White House has accepted the house Judiciary committee's offer 
to allow President Clinton's lawyers two days to present their case 
against impeachment. The committee granted 30 hours of time and refused 
a request for four days of testimony, saying it still plans to conclude 
the matter this year. A letter released today by Henry Hyde says the 
White House must submit a Witness list by noon tomorrow. The White 
House will present its case Tuesday and Wednesday, this week.
