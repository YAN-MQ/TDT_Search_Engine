In a performance she hopes to duplicate in 2002, USA I driver Jean 
Racine won gold Sunday in a women's World Cup bobsled race. The United 
States also took second, with Britain third. Racine and brakeman Jennifer 
Davidson not only stopped the four-race winning streak by Switzerland's 
Francoise Burdet, but they did so in record-setting fashion. Their 
first run down the 4,405-foot (1,342 meter) Bear Hollow track took 
just 50.45 seconds, or 42-hundredths better than the mark they established 
in October. ``Our goal was to go 1-2 today. We did it, I'm really 
pleased,'' said Racine, who edged teammate Jill Bakken by 61-hundredths 
of a second with a two-run time of 1:41.56. ``I can't wait for the 
Olympics, because we'll do the same thing there. I can't wait for 
2002.'' But first the International Olympic Committee must grant women's 
bobsled a medal slot in the 2002 Winter Games at Salt Lake City. There 
has been intense lobbying for women's bobsled, as well as men's and 
women's skeleton events to be included in the Games, and an announcement 
is anticipated this month. Skeleton racing is similar to luge racing, 
but with participants facing forward on their sleds. Racine and Davidson, 
who won the silver behind Burdet and Katarina Sutter in Saturday's 
season-opening race on the same course, started second Sunday, set 
the track record and were never challenged.
