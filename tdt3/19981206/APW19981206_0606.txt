An electric worker died while handling a line in the southern Puerto 
Rican town of Yauco, bringing to eight the number of linemen killed 
while repairing hurricane-damaged lines. Alexander Sinigaglia Gonzalez, 
36, died Saturday while trying to lift a downed 110-volt line, police 
said. His colleague, Javier Huerta Vega, 27, tried to help Sinigaglia 
and suffered severe burns. Huerta remained in a Yauco hospital in 
critical condition Sunday. Three other workers were unhurt. Yauco 
and other southern communities were worst hit by Hurricane Georges 
on Sept. 21, and many pockets are still without electricity. Last 
week, the city of Ponce said it was dedicating its city festival this 
year to electric workers who have died while repairing lines.
