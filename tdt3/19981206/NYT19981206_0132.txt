In 1995, Nick Kramer, then a 25-year-old wine seller turned technology 
entrepreneur, joined three friends and started Spacelab.net, an Internet 
service provider. Within three years, the company grew to a staff 
of 22 and was one of the leading such services in New York City for 
businesses, listing among its customers Allen &AMP; Co. and Hollinger 
International. Last spring, the four founders sold the company to 
Verio Inc., a company based in Englewood, Colo., that had built itself 
into a nationwide Internet service provider by acquiring smaller companies. 
The men found themselves with some money in their pockets, but they 
were also suddenly reporting to a manager on Long Island, N.Y., who 
had to report to a manager in Colorado. Seven months later, Kramer 
is the only one of the original founders still working for Verio. 
His new title is indirect channel sales manager. Reflecting on life 
post-acquisition, Kramer observed: ``The hardest adjustment is going 
from the top of the pyramid to middle manager. And for the rank and 
file, it's difficult to go from being somebody _ an integral part 
of the company _ to being one of 1,000.'' Aside from the departure 
of his partners and one employee, the staff remains intact. But some 
companies are not so lucky. In the information age, acquiring a company 
is not just about product or revenue, but about intellectual property 
and talent, as well. The trick is to hang on to both. Scot Sedlacek, 
managing director of Broadview Associates, an investment bank in Fort 
Lee, N.J., said: ``With technology-oriented companies, the asset you 
are buying is the people. An adviser can run the numbers front and 
back, but the most difficult aspects of a successful merger are the 
post-integration issues.'' Aside from holding on to managers, companies 
have to deal with innate issues of corporate culture _ or simply culture 
clash. A prime example is the planned merger of the New York-based 
music Web site N2K and CDNow of Jenkintown, Pa., to create a single 
super music-playing-CD-selling Web site. The merger solved a lot of 
financial problems. Both stocks had plummeted earlier this fall with 
the overall market drop. But culturally, the two companies are as 
diverse as their geography. N2K's management hails from the music 
industry, as do many of its employees; CDNow is known more as a storefront 
rather than an influence in the music industry, and its young founders 
are considered e-commerce prodigies. CDNow has a basketball court; 
N2K has a house band. Craig Marino, an associate of Sedlacek's at 
Broadview, said of such mergers generally: ``You can't just slam the 
two companies together and hope they are going to work. You need to 
spend the same amount of time working with the people as you do working 
on the valuation.'' Broadview advises clients to outline expectations 
up front so that there is no confusion about what roles the top employees 
will be playing in the new entity. ``Good buyers in technology do 
a lot of due diligence up front to make sure cultures do mesh,'' Sedlacek 
said. As chairman and chief executive of the Web development company 
Think New Ideas, Ron Bloom has had a lot of experience dealing with 
acquisitions. The company, now public, was forged in a roll-up of 
six companies and then acquired six more. He does not take the acquisitions 
game lightly. ``You have to have a cultural plan to match your fiscal 
plan,'' Bloom said, adding that a cultural plan has to take into account 
profit and loss, return on investment and cost of opportunity, just 
as a financial plan does. Bloom does not disclose his company's entire 
strategy, but he says that Think New Ideas generally finds a way to 
work with a company before acquiring it. ``We'll do a joint venture 
to test quality and the strength of relationship,'' he said. Once 
Think New Ideas has made an acquisition, it sends in a ``culture'' 
team, which goes over operations, sales strategies and the like. ``We 
want to send a clear message that they are part of a family and they 
can benefit from the family,'' Bloom said. Even so, he said, ``You 
need to prepare for culture shock; you have to look for a six- to 
nine-month period to optimize performance as the cultures get to know 
each other.'' Bloom also has a plan for acquisitions that end up not 
working. ``We deploy a team to get to the heart of the problem,'' 
he said. ``Usually, we can work it out. The trick is to keep the entities 
on both sides focused on growing the business.'' Like Verio, iXL, 
a Web development company based in Atlanta, has built itself through 
acquisition. Since being formed in April 1996, it has acquired 34 
companies, including two New York-based Web design shops. That said, 
iXL's president, Bill Nussey, said, ``We don't think of ourselves 
as being in the acquisitions business.'' Rather, Nussey said, acquisitions 
are a way to acquire talent. ``We're trying to get talented people 
more rapidly than we can hire them,'' Nussey said. To do this, iXL 
looks for a company with a vision and a culture that are similar to 
its own. ``We have walked away from people who have tons of revenue 
but had management teams which we didn't think would be a good part 
of this company,'' Nussey said. ``We don't have any assets,'' he added. 
``If our people aren't really happy, we have nothing.'' To keep talent, 
Sedlacek and Marino advise empowering employees and building in financial 
incentives. ``If you put a wad of money into people's pockets and 
don't do due diligence in the way of people, six months later they 
might be off to the next start-up to do it again,'' Sedlacek said. 
Back at Verio, Kramer, who at age 28 has already built and sold a 
company, says he is now building a career. ``At first it's a blow 
to the ego not to be in charge,'' he said, ``but the opportunity is 
so much better now. It's an education to see how a larger, national 
company works.''
