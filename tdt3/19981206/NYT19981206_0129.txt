European leaders are focusing new attention on the 14-year Kurdish 
insurgency in Turkey, and many Turks believe their interest can be 
explained with a single word. It is a word that burns in the Turkish 
psyche, even though few non-Turks have ever heard it: Sevres. ``I 
don't like to say this, but some European countries are longing for 
a revival of Sevres,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz asserted recently. 
``All these efforts are in vain.'' Yilmaz is serving as a lame duck 
until a new government can be formed, but his designated successor, 
Bulent Ecevit, holds the same view. In a warning to European countries 
that they must not shield Kurdish rebels, he said, ``Their ambition 
for a new Sevres will not be fulfilled.'' The Sevres Treaty of 1920, 
named after the French town where it was signed, ordained that much 
of what is now Turkey be divided among foreign powers. Its most valuable 
and productive regions were apportioned to Greece, Italy, France and 
Armenia, with the strategic Bosporus and Dardanelles straits put under 
international control. Turkey was left only with Ankara and a swath 
of land around it, much of it mountainous and inhospitable. That treaty, 
imposed on the dying Ottoman Empire, set off a burst of patriotic 
outrage among Turks. Their empire had been shrinking steadily for 
more than a century, and they considered Sevres their final humiliation. 
Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, they rose up in rebellion 
and defeated foreign armies in a spectacular series of battles. In 
1923 a new treaty was signed in Lausanne recognizing Turkey's new 
power and scrapping Sevres. With the Sevres treaty dead, most of the 
world forgot it. Turks, though, did not. Many are convinced that the 
world is still plotting to dismember Turkey. They see every claim 
for regional or cultural autonomy, including those put forward by 
Kurdish nationalists, as means to this end. Turkish historians and 
sociologists call this belief ``the Sevres syndrome.'' This fear was 
revived again last month, when the principal leader of Kurdish rebels, 
Abdullah Ocalan, was arrested in Italy. Not only has Italy refused 
to extradite him, but some political leaders there and in other countries 
are showing sympathy for his cause. Many Turks believe that their 
hidden agenda is to create a Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, 
thereby ripping the country apart as envisioned at Sevres. Ocalan 
lived in Syria for years, obscure and all but friendless. Turkish 
leaders thought they had won a great victory earlier this year when 
they forced Syria to expel him. But suddenly they find themselves 
on the defensive. By turning up in Rome, Ocalan has become a European 
figure. His cause is being debated more widely than it ever was while 
he was living clandestinely in Damascus. ``We want to do the same 
as the Basques and the Irish Republican Army,'' he told an interviewer 
in Rome a few days ago. This stance is unbearable to many Turks, who 
consider Ocalan a terrorist guilty of heinous crimes. They are outraged 
that some Europeans are treating him as a potential peacemaker. ``He 
calls himself a guerrilla, but what could he do when his people were 
being systematically killed?'' said Danielle Mitterrand, widow of 
the former French president and a longtime supporter of the Kurdish 
cause. She said that if Ocalan is put on trial, Turkish generals should 
be put on trial alongside him. Cardinal Achille Silvestrini of Rome 
said of Ocalan: ``If so many Kurds are coming to support him, then 
it cannot be simply a terrorism issue. It is a European issue.'' Members 
of the European Parliament have called for an international conference 
on the Kurdish issue, a suggestion Turkey rejects unconditionally. 
As a way of showing their fury at Italy for refusing to extradite 
Ocalan, Turks have done everything from burning Italian neckties to 
boycotting pizzerias. Signs raised at some of these protests carry 
slogans like ``Turkey Will Never be Divided'' and ``No to Sevres!'' 
Some commentators have begun warning that such protests may not be 
the best way to persuade foreigners that Turkey is mature enough to 
resolve its Kurdish problem. ``I wonder if it would be useful for 
us to remember Ataturk's style,'' Zulfu Livaneli, a columnist, wrote 
in an Istanbul newspaper this week. ``Even in the worst days of the 
war, he did not directly oppose Western powers even though they were 
trying to divide Turkey. He did not curse anyone or trample on anyone's 
flag or fall into the trap of anger or hysteria.'' ``We are afraid 
of Sevres,'' Livaneli wrote, ``but we don't learn from the man who 
put Sevres in its grave.''
