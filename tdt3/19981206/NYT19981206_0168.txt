The number of foreign students attending U.S. colleges and universities 
is on the rise after four years of stagnation, according to a study 
released Monday by the Institute for International Education. The 
study, ``Open Doors, 1997-98,'' reports an increase of 5.1 percent 
for the 1997-98 school year, with a total of 481,280 foreign students 
now studying in the United States. The study comes on the heels of 
a report issued in September indicating that although U.S. colleges 
and universities remain the world leader in attracting foreign students, 
the United States is losing its dominance in international education. 
That report, issued by the U.S. Information Agency and the Educational 
Testing Service, showed that five years ago about 40 percent of all 
international students studied in the United States, whereas in 1996-97 
the figure was 32 percent. The education institute's study used 1997-98 
figures, which were not available for inclusion in the September report. 
``In a year when we thought there would be no increase, it's genuinely 
surprising,'' said Allan Goodman, president of the institute, an educational 
exchange organization. He pointed to several possible reasons for 
the increase, including energetic overseas recruitment by U.S. universities 
and the appeal of the lower cost of two-year community colleges because 
of the Asian economic crisis. The institute found that foreign enrollment 
in two-year colleges had jumped 20 percent in the last five years, 
far outpacing growth in other types of institutions of higher education. 
``The first thing that foreign people learn about the American educational 
system is that it's expensive,'' Goodman said. ``And now they've discovered 
that our community colleges are a bargain, costing only one-half to 
one-tenth as much as the four-year institutions. Foreign students 
realize they can use those first two years to learn the language and 
get acclimated to living in the United States, and then they can transfer 
to a four-year institution.'' ``Another possible reason for the growth 
this year,'' he said, ``is that Asian students are delaying returning 
home because there aren't jobs back there.'' Fluctuations in the number 
of foreign students attending colleges in this country are watched 
carefully by education administrators because many of these students 
do not seek financial aid and therefore constitute an important source 
of revenue. Marianne Craven, deputy director for academic programs 
at the U.S. Information Agency, who took part in the study that led 
to the September report, called the new findings encouraging. But 
she added, ``Based on just one year you can't say if it's a trend.''
