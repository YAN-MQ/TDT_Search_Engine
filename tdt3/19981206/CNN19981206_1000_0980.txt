The numbers are in for TV's November ratings period. And the winner, 
at least in terms of increasing viewership, is the WB network. Susan 
Lisovicz reports. "felicity" -- a word that means good fortune -- 
has lived up to its name for the WB network. While the other five 
broadcast networks all lost ground, 3-year-old WB increased total 
viewership over the important November ratings period. "Felicity," 
another new hit, "charmed," and other WB favorites such as "Dawson's 
Creek" and "buffy the vampire slayer" are all targeted at young female 
audiences. They've looked at the success at "Dawson's Creek" and said, 
"how can we duplicate that in a different kind of show?" If you were 
to look at the other schedules of other networks, you're not going 
to find a lot of those kind of shows. And thus, they have that audience 
almost to themselves. NBC and fox, however, finished in a virtual 
dead heat in capturing the largest amount of 18 to 49-year-old viewers 
-- the demographics advertisers crave most. This, despite the fact 
that much of fox's programming consists of low-budget reality-based 
programming. "Busted on the job" and "when good pets go bad" cost 
a tiny fraction of NBC's multimillion-dollar arsenal that includes 
the $13 million-per-episode "er." Another remarkable turn in the latest 
TV ratings -- the growing number of young people who are tuning out 
of TV entirely. Cable continues to gain ground at broadcast TV's expense. 
But despite all the attempts to woo them, viewership among viewers 
18 to 34 was down 8% from last year for broadcast and cable. Susan 
Lisovicz, "CNN Financial News," New York.
