In the midst of a sweeping crackdown on illegal imports, China said 
Sunday that it has executed a computer executive and an office worker 
for smuggling computers, pagers and other electronic goods into the 
country. The deaths come as China carries out a campaign to enforce 
trade barriers that shield its industries from foreign competition 
in an attempt to quash a multibillion-dollar market for illegally 
imported products. Tang Mihong, general manager of the Beijing Huilu 
Computer Development Co., and office worker Zhao Jian were convicted 
of running a smuggling ring from 1992 to 1995, the state-run Xinhua 
News Agency said. With the help of accomplices at research institutes 
and trading companies, the pair imported electronic goods worth a 
total of 56 million yuan (dlrs 6.8 million), the report said. In at 
least 10 shipments, the smugglers evaded duties at customs offices 
in cities ranging from Guangzhou in southern China to Tianjin and 
Beijing in the north, Xinhua said. China has maintained the value 
of its currency while those of other countries has plunged recently, 
creating the potential for huge profits to smugglers who can get goods 
bought cheaply abroad into the Chinese market. Smuggling is believed 
to account for as much as 15 percent of Chinese imports, or some dlrs 
30 billion a year. Quotas and high tariffs that keep out most foreign 
goods have shielded China from the Asian financial crisis. But a flood 
of imports has pushed down domestic prices for industrial materials 
and consumer goods so low that Chinese companies complain they cannot 
compete. Since launching its crackdown in July, China has punished 
thousands of smugglers and dismissed hundreds of customs officials 
for taking bribes. China says the effort has led to higher prices 
for industrial materials and consumer goods. But state media disclosed 
this week that in at least one industry _ chemical fibers _ a resurgence 
of smuggling has pushed prices back down to record lows. Supreme People's 
Court deputy chief Liu Jiashen said such smuggling is ``seriously 
disrupting efforts to establish economic stability,'' according to 
the Xinhua report. Two accomplices of Tang and Zhao were sentenced 
to 15 and 11 years in prison, respectively, the report said.
