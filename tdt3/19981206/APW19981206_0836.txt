More than 30 years after President Omar Bongo came to power, Gabonese 
voters turned out Sunday to decide whether the long-serving autocrat 
should be elected to another seven years. Turnout appeared low in 
Libreville, Gabon's capital. Despite reports of scattered rock-throwing 
incidents overnight in Libreville, Sunday's voting appeared to have 
passed without serious violence. Many polling stations opened late 
_ some as many as six hours late _ and officials said four ballot 
boxes had been destroyed by mobs angry over incomplete voter lists 
in northern Gabon. No injuries were reported. Some polling stations 
remained open late into the evening because of the delays. Military 
presence remained heavy in the capital after the polls had closed, 
with armored vehicles and heavily armed soldiers visible on some street 
corners. Gabon's opposition was quick to charge election fraud, with 
witnesses telling opposition Radio Soleil that there had been police 
intimidation and people voting with false identity papers. Those charges 
could not immediately be confirmed.
