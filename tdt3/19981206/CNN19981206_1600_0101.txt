Meanwhile, republicans and democrats wrestle with the issue of whether 
censure for the president is an option. I've looked at the constitution 
backward and forward, and I've looked at the history of censure, and 
I don't think it's been used often or effectively and would be a problem, 
probably, for the future. But I think there should be a trial of articles 
of pim impeachment. After that, you know, we'll just have to see. 
The question about whether censure is appropriate or not is a political 
and personal judgment to be made by every member of Congress. But 
if impeachment fails I think it would be terrible to leave this trauma 
in our national history without putting on the record a clear statement 
by members of Congress of both parties that we understand the difference 
between right and wrong, true and false. A vote by the Judiciary committee 
on articles of impeachment is expected by the end of the week.
