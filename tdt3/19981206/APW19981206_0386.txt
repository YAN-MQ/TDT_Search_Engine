Turkey told President Hosni Murabak, who mediated a standoff between 
Turkey and Syria, that Damascus still needs to do more before normal 
relations could be restored, reports said Sunday. Mubarak ended Sunday 
his two-day visit to Turkey aimed at improving economic ties and discussing 
Turkey's strained relations with Syria. On Saturday, Mubarak forwarded 
a message for friendship from Syrian President Hafez Assad which was 
publicly welcomed by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. However, 
Demirel told Mubarak in private that Turkey was still watching Syria 
to see if it would uphold a security agreement reached in October 
in which Damascus pledged to end support Kurdish rebels fighting for 
autonomy in southeastern Turkey, the Turkish daily Radikal said. Although 
the Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, left Syria after the deal 
was struck, Ankara believes that Syria has yet to expel hundreds of 
Ocalan's fighters. Egyptian press reported last month that Syria would 
not return them to Turkey because they were considered to be Syrian 
citizens. Ocalan was detained in Italy last month after he flew to 
Rome from Moscow. Mubarak intervened personally between Ankara and 
Damascus after Turkey threatened military action against Syria unless 
it stopped sheltering Turkish Kurdish rebels. On Sunday, Mubarak urged 
closer economic cooperation in the region. ``The time is one for cooperation,'' 
Mubarak said at a meeting of Turkish and Egytian businessmen. Turkey 
and Egypt are aiming for a free trade agreement that would more than 
double two-way trade to dlrs 2 billion, next year. A deal for Turkey 
to purchase a total of 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas is also 
in the offing.
