In an apparent swipe at the reconstruction program of former Prime 
Minister Rafik Hariri, the new finance minister said Sunday it's time 
cash-strapped Lebanon live within its means. ``We should not build 
dreams that lack some realism,'' Finance Minister George Korom told 
reporters, in an apparent reference to Hariri's multibillion program 
to rebuild the country after the 1975-90 civil war. ``We are among 
those calling for Lebanon to live according to its real capabilities,'' 
said Korom. The change in government last week came after Hariri bowed 
out in an apparent power struggle with new President Emile Lahoud, 
sparking fear the reconstruction process could come to a halt. The 
government of Hariri, a billionaire businessman, borrowed heavily 
to finance huge reconstruction projects. The new government inherited 
a dlrs 16 billion debt and a budget deficit of 40 percent to 50 percent. 
The new Cabinet has set economic reform and cleaning up corruption 
in government as priorities. Prime Minister Salim Hoss promised last 
week that reconstruction would continue and contracts would be honored. 
He added, however, that the government would exercise austerity in 
reconstruction contracts and the 1999 budget. Korom also said Sunday 
that the government also was looking to increase revenues through 
tax reform and strengthening the collection of taxes. Asked about 
investors' fears of an end to reconstruction, new Economy and Trade 
Minister Nasser Saidi said: ``There is no need to worry.'' But he 
suggested the government may reconsider some enterprises of low priority 
and delay the implementation of secondary projects.
