Employees at Air Algerie launched a new strike against the state-owned 
carrier Sunday and grounded all its flights, protesting restructuring 
plans to cut jobs and losses. Air Algerie, the country's only carrier, 
suffered a two-week strike in October that was suspended when management 
agreed to talk with unions about the restructuring. But an umbrella 
group of unions representing the airline's workers called its members 
off the job again Sunday because it said the company wants to shut 
down nearly 112 offices and lay off ``several hundred technicians.'' 
The strike was part of a wave of job actions against the military-backed 
government that is struggling to cut its deficit and pay its foreign 
debt. Revenues from its huge state petroleum industry, comprising 
95 percent of Algeria's export income, have fallen due to sliding 
world oil prices. Foreign airlines have halted serving Algeria during 
a nearly 7-year-old Muslim insurgency that has left more than 75,000 
people dead. Militants hijacked an Air France jetliner from Algiers 
to Marseille in December 1994.
