Doctors in a California hospital this weekend are debating whether 
to let a Prisoner donate his second kidney to his 16-year-old daughter, 
even though it puts his own life in danger. The girl went home from 
the hospital today, but her life is still on the line, too. Here's 
ABC's Brian Rooney. Renada Daniel Patterson needs a new kidney, and 
her father is willing to give her his. 37-year-old David Patterson 
is serving time in California's Folsom prison and said over the telephone 
last night he would do anything to help his daughter. The problem 
is, Patterson has already given one kidney to his daughter. Doing 
it again would leave him without kidneys and in need of dialysis, 
costing $40,000 a year. Doctors at the University of California in 
San Francisco say removing his second kidney would violate the physician's 
credo that, first, you do no harm. In my mind, the idea of this kind 
of procedure would be connected with harming the donor. So that's 
why I personally couldn't do that operation. There's also no guarantee 
Renada's body will accept the second kidney. But Renada's mother says 
there's no reason for doctors to balk. This is not even an ethical 
question. We, as parents, have made a decision for our child. We have 
made a decision for our child. What they say plays no role in this. 
The issue is complicated, because Renada's body rejected one transplant 
at age 5. she's losing her second transplantbecause anti-rejection 
medicine made her fat and she stopped taking it. Her father is a match, 
there's no record of anyone donating both working kidneys. The medical 
procedure is not simply a commodity that we buy. It's asking a human 
being to use skill and abilities and judgment, and you can't simply 
demand that from someone. Vickie Daniel says she can demand the operation 
and will sue if doctors refuse to perform it. Renada needs to live, 
and whatever that takes, we're gonna do. But who's going to do it 
is a big question. A panel of medical ethicists is reviewing the situation 
while Renada's kidney continues to fail. Brian Rooney, ABC News, Oakland, 
California.
