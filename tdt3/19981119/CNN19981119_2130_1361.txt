Flight 57, now boarding... hey, junior, we don't want to miss our 
curtain. I hope you've got hertz #1 club gold. Well, not exactly. 
But, this company's fast. Oh, sure, sure. Can't we skip the rental 
counter like at hertz? Well, not exactly. : dah... hey, genius, I'm 
waterlogged. Doesn't your company have a canopy like hertz? Well, 
not exactly. Remember, there's hertz and there's "not exactly." Choose
