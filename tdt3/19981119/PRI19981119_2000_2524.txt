For today's Geography stumper, we're headed to the Caribbean. But 
don't pack those swim trunks, we're not going anywhere near a beach. 
Instead we're visiting a forest on the island of Barbados. Tucked 
away in the picturesque Scottish district of Barbados, the forest 
offers a cross between a botanical garden and a nature trail. You 
can stroll along the paths amid a bounty of tropical blossoms under 
the canopy of the natural rainforest, or you can wander over the meticulously 
manicured lawns. The visitor's center houses the remains of an old 
sugar boiling house, as well as the mandatory gift shop and snack 
bar. While you get your guide map, you can grab a complementary umbrella 
to shield you from the sunshine that is vital for the continued growth 
of the forest. So, what is the name of this arboreal paradise in Barbados? 
We'll shed some light on the answer in just about five minutes.
