From TV appearances to public utterances, Western officials are campaigning 
for a ``yes'' vote for this Balkan nation's first post-communist constitution, 
calling Sunday's referendum critical for its future democracy. Worn 
down by years of unrest and political chaos in Europe's poorest country, 
Albanians are likely to approve it. But they are skeptical it will 
do anything to end chronic instability. ``All the foreigners are saying 
that it is a good constitution,'' says a doubtful Bajram Muharremi, 
a 57-year-old retired mechanic, at a downtown stand where he sells 
roasted corn to make ends meet. ``They know better than we do ... 
so I will vote for it.'' Drafted by the ruling Socialists and approved 
last month by the parliament they dominate, the constitution sets 
out civil, democratic and human rights based on Western and European 
standards. But coming only weeks after rioting rocked the capital, 
the campaign has been less a debate about constitutional principles 
than a fierce fight between two long-feuding parties locked in a struggle 
for power. Words like ``death,'' ``terror'' and ``murderer'' boom 
frequently from loudspeakers at rallies of the opposition Democratic 
Party of former President Sali Berisha, which is urging a voter boycott. 
The Socialists, meanwhile, practically engineered their own victory 
by tinkering with voting laws, abolishing the requirement that turnout 
must exceed 50 percent for the measure to be valid. Into the fray 
have stepped a leading European official and a host of other visiting 
diplomats, unabashedly taking sides in the name of democracy. The 
ambassador of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
Daan Everts, appears almost nightly on one Albanian television or 
another, explaining or lauding the Socialists' draft constitution 
or talking about human rights. Officials from Austria and elsewhere 
have joined in the campaign, telling Albanians there can be no democracy, 
no secure future, without such a charter. Albania and Belarus are 
the only two countries in Europe without constitutions. ``This constitution 
is important for the political, social and economic stability of Albania,'' 
says Everts. ``Albania needs a legal system. ... This is a necessity.'' 
But few Albanians believe legislation of any kind can resolve the 
political hostilities that have paralyzed their country. ``Laws are 
not a problem here,'' says Remzi Lani, a political analyst and director 
of the Albanian Media Institute. ``In the past six years we have had 
many laws of European standards, which have later been implemented 
according to Balkan standards.'' Politics in Albania have historically 
been primitive and violent. From 1944 until 1991, Albania was ruled 
by fanatic communists who isolated the country from the rest of the 
world. The dictatorship of the proletariat and class struggle replaced 
the rule of law. When the country opened up in 1991, Albanians were 
eager to make up for lost time. But wiping out the communist mentality 
and embracing modern political ways have proven much harder than throwing 
away portraits of former dictator Enver Hoxha. Today Albanian politics 
is still based on the ``with me or against me'' principle, and the 
two biggest parties are like rival armed camps. Sunday's vote is perceived 
as largely a referendum not on the constitution but on those parties. 
Berisha assails the document as anti-Albanian and anti-human rights, 
saying it doesn't guarantee private property and would weaken Albanian 
traditions by allowing people to change their religion and declared 
nationality. ``This constitution is like an egg which was broken a 
long time ago, and it stinks,'' he said at a news conference. ``Albanians 
should stay away from it.'' But many observers suspect his call for 
a boycott hinges on hopes of returning to power if support for the 
government's charter is low, just as his departure from the presidency 
was foretold by the rejection of his party's draft constitution in 
a November 1994 referendum. The government, while citing voter registration 
problems as the reason for eliminating the turnout requirement, obviously 
was worried that its poor record would keep disgruntled Albanians 
away from the polls in a mass show of discontent. Even if the document 
gets a majority of votes, a low turnout seems certain to keep political 
disputes as strong as ever. ``If the turnout is lower than 50 percent, 
legally the constitution has passed but morally and politically the 
government has lost,'' analyst Lani says.
