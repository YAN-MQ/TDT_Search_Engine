Even before Starr began his testimony, democrats fired their first 
shot against the prosecutor. Congressman John Conyers took aim at 
what he described as Starr's partisan background and dismisped the 
charges against the president as "tawdry, salacious and unnecessarily 
graphic." As the committee's ranking democrat, Conyers called Starr 
"A federally paid sex policeman." We have many questions about the 
way you conducted your investigation, Mr. starr. Fairness dictates 
that the committee and the American people learn whether you have 
created a climate for the purpose of driving a president from office 
who has twice been elected by the people of this great nation.
