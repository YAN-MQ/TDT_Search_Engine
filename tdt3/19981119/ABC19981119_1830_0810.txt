We're going to carry by the way the questioning of the president's 
lawyer, David Kendall of Mr. Starr in full Ter this evening during 
a special edition of "Nightline." And in a moment, we'll go on to 
the other news of the day. Japan, the president is there, Japan trying 
to buy its way out of recession. And, from the U.S. to anywhere in 
the world in less than two hours. Skipping across the sky. Life's 
an adventure! Because you're over 50 and still exploring! So take 
the centrum made just for you. Centrum silver. With age-essential 
nutrnts... specially adjusted to keep pace with your changing nutritional 
needs. Centrum silver: Fibercon or metamucil? Both have fiber for 
regularity. But I like Fibercon better. Same natural action of fiber, 
but only Fibercon contains calcium. And with Fibercon, I get my fiber 
in two caplets. I love being out in the sun. It makes me feel so alive. 
Now I really enjoy being outdoors because I've discovered this new 
lotion... that's been awarded the skin cancer foundation seal, designed 
for women our age. This SPF 15 formula with intense vitamin-enriched 
moisture... helps protect maturing skin from future U.V. damage. It 
minimizes, even helps prevent, age spots. And the name? Provital protective 
moisture lotion from oil of Olay. Proven to help you look revitalized.
