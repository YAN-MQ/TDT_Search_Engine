A new study suggests a sharp drop in the rate of HIV infection among 
homosexual and bisexual men in at least four U.S. cities. The sampling 
of 2,800 men in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and chicago found 
an average infection rate of 17%. That's down from estimated highs 
of as much as 50% in the mid 1980s. One researcher says there are 
still some grim facts behind the good news. The number of new cases 
seems to be relatively constant, which is not -- not a very positive 
thing. There's been big changes, obviously, but at this constant rate, 
things over the next 10 or 15 years could begin to get bad again. 
It's important to sort of bring the number of new infections down 
further. Part of this is contributed by the new treatments where you're 
going to have more HIV positive men living with the disease for longer 
periods of time. And that contributes, to some extent, to new infections. 
Experts do say the new figures indicate a turning point in the course 
of the epidemic.
