Responding to Congolese accusations, the government on Thursday said 
it was not responsible for the killing of Rwandan Hutu refugees in 
Congo's 1996 war, instead blaming President Laurent Kabila for covering 
up the massacres. Last week, Congo's ambassador to Kenya, Gabriel 
Kyungu Wa-Ku-Mwanza, said Rwandan-backed Tutsi rebels massacred thousands 
of Hutu refugees in a 1996-97 war that toppled longtime dictator Mobutu 
Sese Seko and installed Kabila in power. Wa-Ku-Mwanza invited a new 
U.N. investigation into the allegations. A statement from the office 
of Rwandan Vice President Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame said anti-Mobutu forces 
were under the command of Kabila, and also included members of former 
Zairian army and hastily trained youth with no military experience. 
``Rwanda believes that this is merely an attempt by Kabila to hide 
the crimes of his own government, by sidetracking the international 
community into focusing on past incidents and not those presently 
being committed as part of Congolese government policy,'' the statement 
said. The United Nations withdrew its investigators from Congo in 
April, citing a lack of cooperation from the government, which harassed 
and intimidated witnesses who spoke with the experts. But Wa-Ku-Mwanza 
blamed the roadblocks on Bizima Karaha, a Tutsi who was Kabila's foreign 
minister until he defected to the rebels who have been trying to topple 
Kabila since Aug. 2. Rwanda and neighboring Uganda have backed the 
rebels with troops and arms, accusing Kabila of failing to rid the 
common border of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels. ``The international community 
will recall that Mr. Kabila and his government deliberately and repeatedly 
frustrated a U.N. team which was sent by Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
to investigate the killing in eastern Congo of the refugees,'' the 
government said in a statement. ``What Mr. Wa-Ku-Mwanza is attempting 
to do now is to shift the blame to Rwanda in the vain hope that this 
will win Mr. Kabila friends in the international community and the 
U.N.,'' the Rwandan statement said. Kabila's Tutsi-backed rebellion 
forces have been accused of targeting Rwandan Hutus to avenge the 
genocide of more than 500,000 Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994. There have 
been persistent reports that Kabila's forces killed Rwandan refugees 
in sites stretching from Uvira, an eastern border town where the rebellion 
began in September 1996, to Mbandaka, 1,250 kilometers (780 miles) 
to the west. Some U.N. officials have asserted that up to 200,000 
people were massacred, but those who worked with refugees in Congo 
itself put the figure much lower, in the tens of thousands.
