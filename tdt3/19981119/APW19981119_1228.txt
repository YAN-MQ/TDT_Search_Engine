Six Venezuelans were fined a total of dlrs 52,000 Barbados (dlrs 26,000 
U.S.) and deported Thursday after they pleaded guilty to credit card 
fraud and returned dlrs 43,000 Barbados (dlrs 21,500 U.S.). The six 
were convicted of using fraudulent cards for hotel rooms, food, drink 
and overseas telephone calls and for obtaining cash from local banks. 
The six paid the fines to avoid a two-year prison sentence and were 
put on a plane for Venezuela Thursday afternoon.
