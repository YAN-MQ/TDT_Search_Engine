Moved from January to July and August to placate the World Cup champion 
French, the Confederations Cup still is in trouble. The new calendar 
upsets the Americans, and the French still don't know if they will 
play. ``A competition cannot have these dates, it is a question of 
the calendar,'' Noel Le Graet, president of the French National League 
(LNF), was quoted Thursday in the French daily L'Equipe. The French 
Football Federation's governing general council will meet Friday to 
decide whether to accept the new dates proposed by FIFA for the Confederations 
Cup. FFF president Claude Simonet initially accepted the new dates, 
but had asked for more time to consult with the French National League. 
A source at the FFF who requested anonymity said that there remains 
a possibility that the federation will be unable to send a team because 
the new dates clash with the start of the 1999-2000 French season. 
After meetings earlier this week _ in which the participating nations 
were consulted _ FIFA announced that the Confederations Cup, an eight-team 
tournament that is to be comprised of the continental champions, was 
being moved from Jan. 8-20 to July 28-Aug. 8. Acknowleding it still 
had to be ratified by the Executive Committee, FIFA announced that 
Simonet had committed Les Bleus to play. But only days later, Le Graet 
was exasperated, with the French league schedule apparently set to 
begin July 28. ``Mr. Simonet could not have looked at the calendar,'' 
Le Graet said. The French withdrew from the Confederations Cup, to 
be played in Mexico, with its January schedule, saying it conflicted 
with the European league season. Simonet agreed to the new schedule, 
but has run into more opposition. ``The dates (for next year's French 
league) are still not set. I am not going to get into a debate about 
this before bringing the problem before the general council,'' Simonet 
said. The July-August dates not only conflict with the French and 
European league schedules, but also the United States' Major League 
Soccer and the Pan American Games, and causes problems for Mexico, 
Brazil and Bolivia which will compete in the Copa America, set for 
July 23-Aug. 8. ``To my knowledge there has been no official communication 
with the French FA,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said Thursday. ``As 
we said a couple of days ago, our president (Sepp Blatter) had met 
with the French president. ``Those dates were proposed for everybody. 
Clearly we wouldn't have laid down those dates where anybody said 
they couldn't make it. Everybody got the same approach, each was able 
to express their opinion.'' The U.S. Soccer Federation was represented 
at the FIFA meetings, but one of them was not MLS commissioner Doug 
Logan, whose league season was interrupted in 1996 by the Olympics 
and this year by the World Cup. ``I'm extraordinarily disappointed. 
As everyone knows I was hopeful we'd have uniterrupted season to see 
what we could do,'' Logan said. ``However, we will make best of it. 
We will enthusiastically support the (U.S.) federation fielding a 
competitive team to the Confederations Cup. ``We will work closely 
with (U.S. coach) Bruce Arena...in making sure that the team is well-prepared 
and represents our country, our federation and our league at the higest 
level. ``Our preference would have been to have this scheduled at 
another time. We'll dance with the partner given us.''
