The Federal Reserve decided to limit its interest rate cut on Sept. 
29 to a quarter of a percentage point because it was worried that 
a bigger reduction might exaggerate its concerns about the risks of 
an economic slowdown, according to minutes of the deliberations released 
Thursday. But just more than two weeks later, the central bank cut 
rates again by another quarter of a point after its policy-setting 
committee decided during a conference call that conditions in the 
financial markets were deteriorating and that business confidence 
was eroding, the minutes said. The decision to cut rates a second 
time on Oct. 15 was made despite continued concern among some members 
of the Federal Open Market Committee that the move would be interpreted 
in the markets as a signal that the central bank saw bad news on the 
horizon, according to the minutes. ``Some members were concerned that 
a policy move so soon after the late September action might be misread 
as indicative of a degree of concern about prospective developments 
in financial markets or the economic outlook that did not represent 
the committee's thinking,'' the minutes said. ``However, the members 
generally concluded that the risk of adverse market reactions was 
worth taking and that the easing actions under consideration were 
more likely to help settle volatile financial markets and cushion 
the effects of more restrictive financial conditions on the ongoing 
expansion.'' The Oct. 15 rate cut did prompt some speculation in the 
markets that the Fed was concerned about an undisclosed financial 
problem along the lines of the problems encountered this summer by 
Long-Term Capital Management LP, a large investment fund. But no such 
problem emerged, and for the most part the Oct. 15 decision had the 
effect the Fed intended, helping to calm the markets. The minutes 
show that the vote on Sept. 29 for the first of the interest rate 
moves was unanimous. Though a rate cut ``was warranted to provide 
some insurance against undesirably tight domestic financial conditions, 
many members saw the need for a cautious policy action,'' the minutes 
said. ``A more sizable policy move at this point might convey an exaggerated 
impression of the committee's current thinking regarding the extent 
of downside risks in the economy.'' No vote was taken during the conference 
call about the second rate decrease, which was enacted on Greenspan's 
authority. The Fed cut rates a third time on Tuesday, reducing the 
federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter-point, 
to 4.75 percent, and the discount rate on loans to banks from the 
Federal Reserve system by a quarter-point, to 4.5 percent. The minutes 
of Tuesday's meeting will be released on Dec. 24. Although the vote 
to cut rates on Sept. 29 was unanimous, there was disagreement among 
the committee's 11 voting members about whether to adopt a formal 
bias toward further rate cuts, a signal that its next move would likely 
be another rate reduction. Although only a ``small majority'' of the 
committee's members favored a bias toward further cuts, the entire 
committee eventually went along.
