Thailand is preparing to request the extradition from the United States 
of a former finance company chief wanted for alleged unlawful loan 
practices, a senior police officer said Thursday. Police are collecting 
evidence against Pin Chakkapak, former head of Finance One, to submit 
to the Thai Attorney-General's Office, police Maj. Gen. Somwong Lipipun, 
chief of the Economic Crime Investigation Division, told Dow Jones 
Newswires. The central bank has filed criminal charges accusing Pin 
and two other executives of Finance One of failing to adequately scrutinize 
loans to two affiliated companies. The bank's charges, filed with 
Somwong's office, accuse them of lending a total of 2.13 billion baht 
(dlrs 59.2 million) to two holding companies without collateral. Somwong 
said the attorney-general must decide whether the evidence collected 
by police is sufficient to prosecute Pin in a Thai court before a 
request can be made to U.S. authorities for Pin's extradition. He 
said the procedures on the Thai side alone can take as long as one 
year. Somwong said Pin was in the United States while the other two 
executives have already reported to his office and have been set free 
on bail. He was not more specific about Pin's whereabouts. He identified 
the other two as Samran Kanokwatanawan and Termchai Pinyawat. The 
Bank of Thailand had previously said it plans to file other charges 
against Finance One, which before its collapse was the country's largest 
non-bank lender. Published reports last month said Pin was offering 
to surrender and cooperate in regaining the money from the bad loans 
he was allegedly responsible for, in return for an agreement that 
no new charges would be filed against him. Bank of Thailand Governor 
Chatu Mongol Sonakul, however, rejected any deal, saying it was a 
matter of principle. ``The Bank of Thailand believes that this is 
a matter that has far greater implications then just in the courtroom. 
It would send a wrong message to the public if there were any deal 
made,'' said a bank spokesman. Reckless lending, sometimes to business 
cronies and politicians, contributed to a crisis in Thailand's financial 
sector that led to the closing of 56 of the country's 93 finance companies 
by the government. The crumbling of Thailand's financial sector helped 
trigger the regional economic meltdown that began in 1997.
