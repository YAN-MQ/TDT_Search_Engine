This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Friday. We'll see some snow showers moving from the Great 
Lakes up across northern New England and then some more across the 
Great Lakes with a trough of low pressure. Meanwhile, rain moves to 
the east coast along the cold front. The central part of the country 
is quiet, but in the northwest, a strong storm will bring heavy rain, 
strong winds and mountain snows. High temperatures Friday just in 
the 30s over the upper midwest and temperatures are cooling off in 
the southeast as well. On Saturday, we'll continue to see heavy rain 
and wind in the northwest with some snow showers rotating across the 
northeast. For Sunday, no change in the northwest. Temperatures are 
moderating across the country with 60s into the central plains, 40s 
across much of New England. Monday, it is a bit warmer, but the west 
is still wet and windy. Don't forget, you can find four-day forecasts 
for more than 7,200 cities at cNN interactive. The address there is
