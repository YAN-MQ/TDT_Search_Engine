Scientists are discovering that damaged heart cells in mice can be 
replaced with the help of Gene therapy. If the same technique works 
as well in humans, there could someday be a new way to treat heart 
patients. Here's how the problem begins -- unlike most other cells 
in our bodies, heart cells apparently stop regenerating after we're 
born, even if the cells are damaged by a heart attack. To compensate 
for the loss, the remaining, living cells enlarge, causing the heart 
to enlarge, which can lead to a condition known as congestive heart 
failure. But if the Gene therapy process works, the living cells that 
remain after a Heart attack would multiply instead of enlarging. So 
we're hoping that if we can improve the amount of cardiac muscle mass 
after a heart attack by regenerating those cells that we'll be able 
to prevent those detrimental effects. Such as heart failure and death. 
But despite the progress being made in the laboratory, it will likely 
be years before this technique can be offered to heart patients. Check
