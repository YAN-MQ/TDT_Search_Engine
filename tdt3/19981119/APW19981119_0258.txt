Russian President Boris Yeltsin met Thursday with his interior minister 
to discuss ways to combat ethnic hatred in Russia, the presidential 
press service said. Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin briefed Yeltsin 
at the president's Gorky-9 residence outside Moscow about efforts 
by Russian police to combat extremism and attempts to instigate ethnic 
enmity, a presidential spokesman said. The talks come after a Communist 
lawmaker who made anti-Semitic remarks was not censured by the mostly 
hard-line parliament, which was then accused of being too tolerant 
of ethnic hatred. Yeltsin met with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
on Tuesday, and will welcome Chinese President Jiang Zemin next week, 
but has canceled a trip to India, his press center said. Plagued by 
health problems for the last few years, Yeltsin has kept travel to 
a minimum recently, calling off trips to Malaysia and Austria. He 
has handed over much of the daily workings of government to Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov. Still, the president and his doctors insist 
he will serve out his presidential term, which ends in mid-2000.
