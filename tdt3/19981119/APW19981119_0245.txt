Aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and a destroyer were sailing through 
Thursday the Suez Canal on their way to the Gulf to join U.S. forces 
there. The two warships are expected to reach the Gulf of Suez on 
Thursday afternoon. The crossing comes one day after a submarine and 
two other ships crossed. The ships were ordered to move to the Gulf 
to join the U.S. naval force that was preparing to launch military 
strikes on Iraq. The strikes were averted Saturday when Iraq agreed 
to resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors charged with overseeing 
the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction. The Enterprise 
is to replace the carrier Eisenhower in the Gulf. There are about 
23,400 U.S. troops in the Gulf in addition to 174 aircraft and 21 
ships, including nine armed with cruise missiles, according to the 
Pentagon.
