Also on Capitol Hill, Majority Republicans in the House of Representatives 
have chosen a new leadership team, following their party's disappointing 
showing in this month's U.S. elections. As expected, Louisiana Representative 
Bob Livingston was chosen to replace the controversial Newt Gingrich 
as House speaker. Here is Mr. Livingston. We're gratified that the 
American people cast the majority of their votes for Republicans. 
Around this country we enjoy a strong majority of 34 governors out 
of 50 states. We have an even split of state legislators around the 
county. We enjoy a majority in the United States Senate and, altogether, 
we are proud to be part of the team of the majority party for the 
next millennium. House Speaker Dick Armey of Texas survived strong 
challenges. He's actually the leader -- or the majority leader of 
-- in the House. He has survived some strong challenges to hold on 
to the spot as the second -- second ranking republican in the House. 
J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, an African- American, is the new republican 
conference chairman.
