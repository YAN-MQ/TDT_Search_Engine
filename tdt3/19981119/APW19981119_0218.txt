Ben Johnson is going to Israel to help with the country's track program. 
Johnson, banned from competitive track for drug use, was invited by 
the Maccabi Sports Club of Tel Aviv to work with its track athletes. 
``I've talked with a few athletes about Ben and they said some unbelievable 
words about him,'' Lior Biderman, manager of the Maccabi Tel Aviv 
athletics club, told the Toronto Sun. ``Our best (sprinter) is 10.34 
seconds and he is the only one.'' Biderman wasn't worried about Johnson's 
drug suspensions. ``I know Ben is clean right now,'' he said. ``If 
he can help us and we can help him, that's wonderful.''
