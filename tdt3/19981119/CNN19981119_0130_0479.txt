I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center, with your 
"CNN Headline News forecast." Beautiful weather along the eastern 
seaboard Thursday morning, as well as the western and central sections 
of the country. Gulf coast not looking bad either. But heavy snow 
over the Great Lakes and rain and snow moving into the pacific northwest 
Thursday morning through Friday morning. By Friday morning, that heavy 
snow will move into New England, and we'll see rain develop over the 
lower Mississippi valley. And central and western sections of the 
country looking quite nice. Highs on Thursday, in the 70s and 80s 
in the deep south, a pocket of very cold air over New England, with 
highs in the 30s. 20s and 30s over the northern plains and the northern 
and central Rockies. Your extended forecast showing heavy rain and 
wind in the northwest. Heavy snow and rain in the northeast, with 
a few showers over Texas. Lighter rain over Texas on Saturday. The 
heavy rain persists in the northwest, with a few snow showers in the 
northeast. And heavy rain once again continues on Sunday, with a few 
showers over south Texas and windy conditions over the Great Lakes.
