A Mexican military officer's account of what happened at the Alamo 
is stirring debate among historians Greg LaMotte has the story. Davy 
Crockett, king of the wild frontier, who died in the battle of the 
Alamo. Many historians and moviemakers have led us to believe Crockett 
died battling till the bitter end, swinging his rifle, "old Betsy," 
like a Baseball bat at advancing Mexican revolutionary soldiers. At 
275 to my left now. you at 275. I need $300,000. But this 700-page 
manuscript, which was just auctioned for almost $390,000, suggests 
something a bit different and highly controversial. The manuscript, 
allegedly written by a Mexican lieutenant colonel, who claimed to 
have been at the battle of the Alamo, says Crockett, along with a 
handful of others, was captured and slowly executed by general Santa 
anna's soldiers. "Those closest to Santa Anna leapt upon them," he 
says, "like tigers upon their prey, and though they were tortured 
before they were killed, they did not cry out. They did not protest 
or humiliate themselves before their torturers." But in Texas, those 
are fighting words. The Alamo, and its stories of bravery, are almost 
considered sacred. Presidential candidates and the queen of England 
don't visit Texas without a tour of the Alamo. And now some Alamo 
historians are saying that very expensive manuscript is a fraud. It's 
hundreds of loose pages from all different types of paper manufacturers, 
all cut down to a uniform size. It has a number of different handwritings 
in it, at least four different handwritings. a $387,500 fake? We were 
able to determine, unequivocally, that the paper was manufactured 
between 1825 and 1832, and perhaps more importantly, that the ink, 
when applied to the paper, was fresh and the paper has not been treated 
or tampered with in any way. It seems no one can say for sure how 
davy Crockett lost his life. But one thing that is not disputable, 
as we remember the Alamo, davy crockett died a courageous man. Greg 
LaMotte, CNN, Los Angeles.
