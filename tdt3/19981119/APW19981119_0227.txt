French lawmakers easily adopted a bill Thursday that gives France 
one of the world's toughest anti-doping laws. All parties in parliament 
voted in favor of the measure except President Jacques Chirac's conservative 
Rally for the Republic party (RPR), which abstained, saying more time 
was needed to debate the bill. Doping became a national issue during 
the Tour de France, with revelations of widespread doping by riders 
in the hugely popular summer event. The law, which was approved by 
the Senate in May, creates a strong doping prevention committee. It 
requires sports federations to show they are acting to eradicate the 
use of illegal drugs, and punishes those found prescribing, supplying, 
encouraging or using them. Three legal experts, three medical or scientific 
representatives and three sports officials will make up the nine-member 
committee, which can impose penalties and stiffen sanctions when it 
believes sports federations have failed to crack down. The Ministry 
of Sports will have the right to raid premises and order athletes 
to undergo medical examinations. Sports federations must also discipline 
offenders and make an official report on infractions within five months 
of an offense. The government will only issue sports licenses to authorities 
with a certificate showing they are fighting doping. Sports Minister 
Marie-George Buffet, who has made the fight against doping her top 
priority since coming into office in June 1997, was pleased by the 
strong support for the bill. ``It is a law for sports, which aims 
to preserve its ethics,'' Buffet said after the bill passed. ``It's 
really the human being who is at the center of this text.'' In presenting 
the bill Wednesday, Buffet said she would give details of the law 
to the next meeting of the International Olympic Committee in an attempt 
to promote a more coherent international policy. The doping controversy 
at the Tour de France, during which the Festina team was expelled 
for use of the performance-enhancing drug EPO, gave new impetus to 
the fight against banned drugs in France. But other sports have also 
been hit by drug scandals, and officials worry about its use by very 
young athletes. The French daily Liberation said Tuesday that an internal 
report from France's National Center for Scientific Research had identified 
widespread doping in many French sports, particularly among adolescents 
and at small sports clubs.
