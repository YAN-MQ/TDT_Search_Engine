Elisabeth Owens, who helped to shape the field of international tax 
law and in 1972 became the first woman ever granted tenure at Harvard 
Law School, died on Sunday at Falmouth (Mass.) Hospital. She was 79 
and lived in Falmouth. The cause was complications of Parkinson's 
disease, said her niece Charlotte Harris. Tenure did not come easily 
for Ms. Owens. Former students and faculty colleagues alike say she 
was denied it for years because of her sex. Speaking to a reporter 
for the Harvard Law Bulletin in 1988, another professor at the law 
school, Milton Katz, described the granting of tenure for her as ``a 
delayed justice,'' and Ms. Owens herself said at the time, ``It was 
a decision that I also felt was overdue.'' Asked for comment Thursday, 
Michael Chmura, a spokesman for the law school, said Harvard did not 
comment on faculty appointments other than to announce them. Even 
after Ms. Owens had gained tenure, said Ms. Harris, her niece, she 
was assigned, condescendingly, to teach women's studies. After a year 
of that, she refused to teach the subject and returned to her main 
interest, international tax law. Elisabeth Ann Owens was born in Boston 
and graduated from Boston Girls Latin School and from Smith College, 
summa cum laude. She received her bachelor of laws degree from Yale 
Law School in 1951 and subsequently became a research assistant to 
the tax expert Stanley Surrey at Harvard Law School. After a year 
in the office of the secretary of the Treasury in Washington, she 
began teaching full time at Harvard. Asked once by a reporter how 
she had decided to concentrate on tax law, she said: ``I think at 
one point Professor Surrey asked me, `What is creditable tax?' My 
answer turned into three books.'' Ms. Owens was the author of ``The 
Foreign Tax Credit'' (ITP, 1961), which Oliver Oldman of Harvard called 
``one of the best tax books ever written.'' Oldman said the beauty 
of the work was the way it organized ``the law into a structured, 
reasoned whole.'' Ms. Owens was also the author, with Gerald Ball, 
of the two-volume ``The Indirect Credit'' (ITP, 1975 and 1979). In 
midcareer, Ms. Owens also developed an interest in natural-resources 
law. She retired in 1981. She is survived by her sisters Margaret 
Harris of Falmouth and Mary Bemis of Randolph, Mass.; her brothers, 
Cornelius Owens of West Roxbury, Mass., and Graham Owens of Yarmouth 
Port; and 15 nieces and nephews, including her nieces Mary Owens and 
Charlotte Harris, with both of whom she lived in Falmouth.
