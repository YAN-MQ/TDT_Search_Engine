Iraq's news agency reports seven teams of U.N. weapons inspectors 
visited several sites today. It's the second day of inspections since 
Iraq agreed to allow the teams to resume their duties. U.N. officials 
say the inspections went normally. If the monitoring teams certify 
Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, U.N. sanctions 
against the country could be lifted.
