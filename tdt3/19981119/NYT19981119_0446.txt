As deadly tension appears to be building again in Kosovo, where 385,000 
civilians remain uprooted, NATO officials warned Thursday that a shaky 
cease-fire might soon dissolve. An unarmed international force intended 
to monitor the cease-fire is weeks, perhaps months, from taking shape, 
and the U.N. Security Council Thursday urged its speedy deployment. 
The supreme NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, has said Serbian security 
forces and armed Kosovo rebels have a window of a few months to begin 
serious talks. If they do not, the killing will resume, the general 
warned, adding that both sides appear ready to do battle. Since 1989, 
when the Serbian authorities in Belgrade revoked the autonomous status 
for the Province of Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian people have been asking 
for greater independence from Serbia. But their efforts have met violence 
and repression. The repression erupted in killing, burning and looting 
this year, as Serbian security forces rampaged from village to village. 
In response an armed resistance of ethnic Albanians, calling itself 
the Kosovo Liberation Army, has fought back, killing and capturing 
Serbian forces. NATO officials said Thursday that both sides were 
responsible for a sharp increase in tensions in recent weeks. The 
statement said incidents of violence ``risk creating a dangerous cycle 
of provocation and response.'' If the violence continues, NATO warned, 
it ``could destabilize the cease-fire, reverse the recent improvement 
in the humanitarian situation'' and disrupt plans for an international 
monitoring force in Kosovo. That may have already occurred. ``The 
cease-fire is being breached on a daily basis, intimidation continues, 
roadblocks are being erected, and still people are being killed,'' 
said Bronislaw Geremek, chairman of the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe. The organization is supposed to send 2,000 
unarmed observers to verify Serbian compliance with U.N. resolutions, 
in particular the withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo and the 
return of ethnic Albanian refugees. It is unclear how that force could 
accomplish anything beyond reporting acts of violence by the 25,000 
or so Serbian soldiers and security forces in the region and the smaller 
Kosovo Liberation Army. The monitors will not be able to intercede 
if fighting erupts. ``If we are told there is a battle up front, we 
will not go to see the bullets flying,'' said the American leader 
of the Kosovo Verification Mission, William Walker. ``We will report 
back that there is a reported battle ahead.'' The State Department 
spokesman, James Rubin, said Thursday that the situation had ``not 
spun out of control.'' NATO has plans to create a 1,700-member ``rapid 
reaction'' force to defend the monitors' safety. NATO has succeeded 
only in ``dampening and containing the crisis,'' General Clark told 
the NATO parliamentary assembly last week. ``At this very time both 
the KLA and the Serbs are re-arming and preparing for confrontation 
again. If even more destructive fighting is not to occur we must turn 
off the engines driving this conflict.'' Clark said the talks had 
a window of two to four months. Last month NATO threatened to bomb 
Serbian military targets to stop the killing in Kosovo. It lifted 
the threat after President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia agreed 
to withdraw some troops from Kosovo. That promise has not been fully 
kept. The Kosovo Liberation Army, beaten badly in the Serbian summer 
offensive, has bounced back, and it may be as strong or stronger than 
before, NATO officials said. Attempts to reach a political settlement 
have been going nowhere. Some U.S. officials and intelligence analysts 
said they feared that if fighting broke out and the international 
mission fell apart the resulting battles could lead to long-term Western 
intervention in Kosovo, not unlike the case in Bosnia.
