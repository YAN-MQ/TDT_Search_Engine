After struggling to qualify for the PageNet Tour Championship, Laura 
Davies looked capable of winning it Thursday. Shooting a 6-under-par 
66, in a round that included two eagles, Davies held a two-stroke 
lead after the first round at the Desert Inn Golf Club. Juli Inkster 
(68) was in second place and Brandie Burton and Dottie Pepper were 
tied for third at 69. It has been a subpar year by Davies' lofty standards. 
She entered this week's tournament, which is limited to the tour's 
top 30 money winners, 24th on the LPGA money list, after four consecutive 
years of finishing no worse than No. 8. ``If you get left out of a 
tournament like this, you feel like you've had a horrendous year,'' 
said Davies, who was the LPGA's leading money-winner in 1994, and 
finished No. 2 in both 1995 and 1996. ``When you've been No. 1, it's 
hard to be No. 24. I don't want to make any of the other players feel 
bad, but that's how I feel. If they're happy to be No. 24, that's 
fine. But I'm not.'' But Davies was extremely happy with Thursday's 
round, although some of the other favorites were disappointed. Annika 
Sorenstam, No. 1 on the money list and the defending champion, struggled 
to a two-over par 74 and Se Ri Pak shot an even par 72. Sorenstam 
has clinched the money title, but Pak could win the points race for 
player of the year if she wins this weekend, and if Sorenstam finishes 
fourth or worse. The longest hitter on the women's tour, Davies took 
advantage of that power on the Desert Inn's par-5 holes. At the 525-yard 
No. 5, Davies used a driver on her first two shots, then chipped in 
from 40 feet for eagle. Davies birdied the 500-yard No. 9, hitting 
a strong drive, a 5-iron approach shot and short chip that landed 
a foot from the cup. Then on No. 15, 453 yards, Davies made another 
eagle, hitting a drive, a beautiful 6-iron that landed 10 feet from 
the cup, followed by eagle putt. Davies also birdied No. 3, No. 10, 
and No. 13, and her only bogeys came at No. 11 and No. 14. More important, 
Davies had only one three-putt. ``I'm missing the short ones now, 
which I never used to do,'' said Davies, who turned 35 last month. 
``I'm still hitting a high percentage of greens, but when you're putting 
poorly, it affects your whole game. You're always thinking about it. 
``It has been 18 months since I putted or chipped well.''
