A junior trader cost his employers an estimated 10 million pounds 
(dlrs 16 million) when a training blunder led him to launch a deal 
worth billions, The Daily Telegraph reported in Thursday's editions. 
The trader pressed the wrong button on his computer, indicating that 
someone wanted to sell 130,000 German bond futures contracts, worth 
more than 11.5 billion pounds (dlrs 19 billion), the newspaper said. 
The offer was the largest single trade in German futures, which are 
usually traded in 10,000 lots, the paper said. The Daily Telegraph 
did not name the trader or the firm involved, but said it was believed 
to be a German finance house. The trader's employers are now contractually 
obliged to carry out the transaction, the newspaper said. German bond 
futures used to be traded on the floor, where traders on the London 
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange bought and sold 
them using hand signals. However, now German bond futures are predominantly 
traded on Eurex, a German-based electronic exchange. Traders told 
the newspaper that it was easy to accidentally enter the dealing program 
instead of the training simulation software.
