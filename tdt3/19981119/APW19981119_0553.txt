This could be the week The Ro-Ro Show _ Roberto Baggio and Ronaldo, 
together in the starting lineup _ takes center stage for Internazionale 
of Milan. The two highly-paid strikers have been battling knee injuries 
all season, but both are on the verge of being given the green light 
when their struggling club plays at Fiorentina on Sunday in the prime 
matchup of the Italian League's 10th round. It would be a much-needed 
boost. When Inter signed the 31-year-old Baggio this summer, the team 
figured it had a veteran playmaker to suit up alongside Ronaldo, the 
exciting Brazilian wunderkind. But the pair have been on the field 
together a total of 70 minutes in league action this season, and Inter's 
dreams of its first title in a decade have been dissipating. The club 
is a mediocre 4-2-3 and just recently went through a three-game losing 
slide. Fiorentina, meanwhile, is enjoying its first run atop the standings 
since 1982. With Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta leading the way 
with a league-high 10 goals, Fiorentina has 18 points, one more than 
both AS Roma and two-time defending titlist Juventus of Turin. AC 
Parma is next with 16 points, followed by AC Milan with 15 and Inter 
with 14. Sunday's other games are Juventus vs. Empoli, Milan vs. Lazio 
of Rome at night, Salernitana vs. Venezia, Sampdoria of Genoa vs. 
Vicenza, and Udinese vs. Piacenza. Three games have been moved up 
to Saturday because of UEFA Cup outings Tuesday: Roma vs. Bari, Cagliari 
vs. Parma, and Bologna vs. Perugia. Ronaldo ``has a 51 percent chance 
of playing at Florence,'' Inter coach Luigi Simoni said Wednesday. 
``That extra one percent represents hope.'' Hampered by tendinitis 
in both knees, the two-time FIFA Player of the Year has appeared in 
just three league games so far _ but has scored one goal in each outing. 
The rest of the squad clearly revolves around Ronaldo and plays better 
when he is on the field, even at less than 100 percent. ``We have 
done everything we could,'' Inter club doctor Piero Volpi said. ``At 
this point, it is only up to him to decide whether he feels like playing 
or not.'' Baggio has looked generally rusty but shown sparks of brilliance 
in his limited appearances the last two weeks. With rising star Nicola 
Ventola (five goals) sidelined about a month with his own knee injury, 
and France's Youri Djorkaeff inconsistent, Inter needs Baggio up front. 
It also doesn't help that two players who help create offense up the 
flanks, Francesco Moriero and Dutchman Aron Winter, are out with injuries. 
Regardless of who plays in attack for Inter, the game could be a high-scoring 
affair. Neither Inter (14 goals allowed) nor Fiorentina (11 allowed) 
inspires much confidence on defense, although both club's 'keepers 
(Inter's Gianluca Pagliuca started, Fiorentina's Francesco Toldo was 
the reserve) were on Italy's World Cup roster this summer. Only four 
of the league's 18 clubs have given up more goals than Inter, which 
also will have to do without suspended defender Francesco Colonnese.
