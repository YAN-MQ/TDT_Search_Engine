Accompanied by an entourage of 70 trade officials and executives, 
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien arrived Thursday for a visit 
expected to highlight closer ties with China. After a formal welcoming 
ceremony, Chretien met with his Chinese counterpart, Zhu Rongji, for 
talks that focused on bilateral issues as well as broader concerns, 
the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. The two leaders were expected 
to preside over the signing of accords that Canadian officials said 
would include agreements on economic cooperation, the environment 
and anti-drug efforts. Chretien was to deliver a speech at Tsinghua 
University, one of China's top schools, and to inaugurate a fast-food 
venture at a local bus station on Friday. On Saturday, he was to make 
a quick trip to the western city of Lanzhou, in Gansu province, to 
inspect joint development projects there, before returning home late 
in the day.
