A leading Pakistani Bishop, Samuel Ezeriah says the country's Christian 
community has been horrified by the killing of a Christian family 
of nine. Some people have linked it to the apparent belief that the 
head of the family practiced magic. But Bishop Ezeriah says the family 
were victims of religious discrimination and a fundamentalist attitude 
encouraged by the government. The track record has been that in the 
past ten years or so, religious fundamentalism in Pakistan has been 
growing, it has not been controlled. Some of the people are interpreting 
Islam in a very negative way, which has is not helping build relationships 
between the people of the two faiths. Pakistani Bishop, Samuel Ezeriah.
