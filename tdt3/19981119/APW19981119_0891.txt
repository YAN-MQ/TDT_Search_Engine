The Warsaw provincial court on Thursday handed down two life sentences 
and five other prison terms to a group found guilty of abducting, 
torturing and murdering a 19-year-old student last summer. In a trial 
that riveted Poles since May, a five-judge panel convicted the two 
main perpetrators, Monika Szymanska and Tomasz Kobus, of murder and 
gave both the maximum sentence of life in prison. The court said Szymanska, 
a 24-year-old mother of three, was the ringleader of the group who 
ordered the abduction and murder and Kobus carried out the stabbing 
that led to the death of the student, Tomek Jaworski. Another leader 
of the 19 to 34-year-old group, Marek Szmidt was also charged with 
murder but got 15-years in prison because he cooperated with investigators 
and told them were to find Jaworski's body. Robert Wojcieski got 12 
years in prison for helping abduct and torture the victim, Rafal Bogdanski, 
also charged as an accessory in the abduction, got a seven-year term. 
Two participants in a scuffle that preceded the abduction, Maciej 
Kusy and Robert Juraszek got five- and two-year suspended sentences 
respectively. They were all arrested within days of the murder. ``No 
crime has justification, but in this case we met with such accumulation 
of suffering that it bordered on bestiality,'' presiding judge Malgorzata 
Mojkowska said in reading the verdict. Jaworski was abducted from 
an end-of-school party last June, locked in an apartment for five 
days, and tortured and stabbed to death. Prosecutor Wanda Marciniak 
said the perpetrators' ``brutality and ruthlessness was hard to understand.'' 
Jaworski's parents have said they cannot forgive the murderers of 
their only child and that life imprisonment was not sufficient punishment. 
Poland's new penal code, introduced in September, abolished the death 
penalty, in line with most codes in Western Europe. Poland, a former 
communist-governed country aspiring to join the European Union, replaced 
its communist-era code with one that applies to its new political 
and economic situation. People across the nation were shocked by the 
crime. Groups of relatives and friends of Jaworski's family carrying 
black flags and pictures of the victim, attended every court session 
in the case and the media reported on the trial in detail. Some cried 
when the verdict was announced.
