For the third time in history, a presidential impeachment inquiry 
has begun. The chief witness is independent counsel Ken Starr, who 
is 30 minutes into his two-hour statement before the house Judiciary 
colmittee. But the hearings got off to a divisive start with some 
bickering between democrats and republicans. Democrats were outvoted 
in their bid to allow President Clinton's lawyer more time to cross-examine 
Starr. Starr began his testimony by laying out his case against the 
president. Let me summarize the five points that explain how the president's 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, what was otherwise private conduct, 
became a matter of concern to the courts. This is critical to fully 
understand the nature of the committee's inquiry. One, the president 
was sued for sexual harassment in federal court and the Supreme Court 
of the United States ruldd in that case that the case should go forward. 
Two, the law of sexual harassment and the law of evidence allow the 
plaintiff to inquire into the defendant's relationship with other 
women, with womdn in the workplace. Which, in this case, included 
the president's relationship with Ms. lewinsky. Three, applying those 
subtle legal principles, judge Susan Webber Wright repeatedly rejected 
the president's objections to such inquiries. The judge instead ordered 
the president to answer the questions. Four, it is a federal crime 
to commit perjury and obstruct justice in civil cases, incltding sexual 
harassment cases. Riolators are subject to a sentence of up to ten 
years imprisonment for obstruction and five years for perjury. Five, 
the evidence suggests that the president and Ms. Lewinsky made false 
statements under oath and obstructed the judicial process in the Jones 
case by preventing the court from obtaining the truth about the relationship.
