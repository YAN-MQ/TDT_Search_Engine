This week on the "cold & flu report" -- flu shots are known to be 
the best way of preventing the flu. But often, the shots are only 
recommended for the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. 
Now, research shows that vaccinating school-aged children is effective 
in preventing the flu and is worth the cost of vaccinating them. It 
does make a lot of sense that if you reduce the amount of illness 
in school-aged children and the parents not having to stay home, that 
those parents who work, that the costs will certainly go down. The 
researchers who crunch the numbers say both the family and society 
can benefit.
