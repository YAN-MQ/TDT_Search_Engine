The center-left coalition was split Thursday over a bill that aims 
to cut subsidies to anti-democratic parties, with Prime Minister Jean-Luc 
Dehaene's Christian Democrat party warning the current proposal would 
never hold up in international law. The extreme right-wing Vlaams 
Blok party, the main target of the proposed legislation, has tabled 
some 3,000 amendments in a filibustering move to stave off a parliamentary 
vote this week. The Dutch-speaking Flemish Christian Democrats want 
to send the bill to the Council of State, the nation's supreme court, 
so it can investigate the legality of the proposal. They believe the 
bill is far too general in its present form to get a legal stamp of 
approval. The three other government parties, the French-speaking 
Walloon Christian Democrats and both Socialist parties want to push 
the measure through parliament as quickly as possible to make a clear 
stand against right-wing extremism. It was unlikely at this stage 
that the issue would affect the stability of the government. If the 
Vlaams Blok would challenge it ``it would likely be that the European 
Court would back their reasoning. I do not wish to grant them such 
a present,'' Paul Tant, House speaker for the Dutch-speaking Christian 
Democrats said. ``It's too bad we cannot face this standing shoulder 
to shoulder,'' said Tant's Socialist counterpart Louis Vanvelthoven. 
In parliament, his view is back by the Dutch-speaking Conservatives, 
the Flemish nationalist Volksunie and the Vlaams Blok, which should 
be enough to garner the required one-third of votes to refer the bill 
to the Council of State. The Dutch-speaking Conservatives argue any 
decision on whether a party is racist or anti-democratic should be 
left up to the courts, not parties. ``Under the rule of law, it cannot 
be that politics will decide whether a party is racist or not,'' said 
the party's parliamentary leader Patrick Dewael. The Vlaams Blok has 
made major advances in Dutch-speaking Flanders during the 1990s. It 
won 12.2 percent of the Flemish vote in 1995 with an anti-immigrant, 
Flemish nationalist program and is a hot issue of debate again ahead 
of next June's elections. The traditional parties were hoping to cut 
off some of the Vlaams Blok's financial aid with the new proposal, 
which bans subsidies to any party that discriminates ``on basis of 
sex, race, color, language, religion, opinion, national or social 
origin, minorities, wealth, birth or other status.''
