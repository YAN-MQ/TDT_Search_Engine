It took 60 seconds for civility to vanish in a whirl of acrimony Thursday 
as Republicans and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee faced 
President Clinton's accuser for the first time. ``You are disrupting 
the continuity of this meeting with these adversarial _'' said Rep. 
Henry Hyde of Illinois, the committee's chairman, groping for the 
right word to cap his sentence. ``We're disrupting a railroad, it 
seems like, Mr. Chairman,'' said Rep. Melvin Watt, D-N.C., hunching 
over his microphone. ``That's what we're disrupting here.'' And so 
it went. Known as the most fiercely polarized panel on Capitol Hill, 
the Judiciary Committee did not disappoint on Thursday. During a full 
day of testimony, Democrats and Republicans sparred repeatedly as 
they tried to either savage or laud the independent counsel Kenneth 
Starr, the committee's leadoff witness and the man who spearheaded 
Thursday's impeachment proceedings. Relishing Starr's appearance, 
Democrats tried to paint a picture of Starr as the biased ringleader 
in a Republican vendetta to destroy Clinton. They interrupted Hyde 
throughout the day, challenging his fairness as chairman, attempting 
to throw him off balance right off the bat when they requested two 
hours of rebuttal time for Clinton's lawyers. ``You cannot have the 
defense in a courtroom sitting gagged and bound without any opportunity 
to refute the accused's overwhelming opportunity to talk and talk 
and talk,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who played a starring 
role in objecting to the proceedings. ``The chair would like to suggest 
to the gentlelady, with respect, the chair doesn't intend to bind 
and gag anybody,'' Hyde replied, bristling at the hearing's rocky 
start. Indeed, Hyde granted Abbe Lowell, the Democrats' investigative 
counsel, 70 minutes to question Starr, more than twice Lowell's original 
allotment. For their part, Republicans fought back by accusing Democrats 
of buffoonery in the face of history and of stoking partisan animosity 
before Thursday's proceedings even began. ``Having a couple of hours 
of parliamentary haggling relative to the procedure of today's hearings 
I think denigrates the dignity of this hearing,'' said Rep. James 
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. He added, ``The people over on the other side 
of the aisle, I think, are saying that this is going to be railroaded 
before the whistle even blows and the train leaves the station.'' 
During one of the breaks, Sensenbrenner added, ``Democrats ought to 
be ashamed of themselves for turning this into a political circus.'' 
In a kind of dress rehearsal for Thursday's hearing, Ms. Jackson Lee 
took to the microphones Thursday morning in a news conference with 
two people who said they had been persecuted by Starr in his zeal 
to chase wrongdoing. It was a prelude to the stinging attacks she 
would make throughout the day at the hearing, objecting to Starr's 
tactics and motives and to Hyde's handling of the inquiry. ``A point 
of order,'' she said several times, setting off a small firestorm 
in the midst of Starr's statement. The two sides differed sharply 
in their approach to the proceedings and toward Starr, but members, 
most of them lawyers, clearly reveled in the type of courtroom theatrics 
they had left behind when they came to Capitol Hill. Republicans seemed 
to savor using phrases like ``rule of law'' and ``a historical first.'' 
They addressed Starr with deference, calling him ``judge,'' and described 
his presentation as ``convincing,'' ``forceful'' and ``honorable'' 
during hearing breaks. ``Judge Starr's office has been treated like 
a pinata,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. ``He has been beaten up 
every day.'' Their questions were tailored to help Starr defend himself, 
his investigation and his charges in person after four years of virtual 
silence. ``The president was asked had he ever been given any gifts 
by Ms. Lewinsky,'' said Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif. ``Does evidence 
gathered indicate that the president gave false or misleading testimony 
when he answered `I don't recall'?'' ``Yes,'' Starr replied, adding 
that it ``defied credulity.'' The president, he said, ``is blessed 
with one of the most powerful memories.'' Democrats, on the other 
hand, stayed loyal to the course they have pursued since Starr's report 
was unloaded from a couple of minivans on Capitol Hill: They took 
off the blindfold and throttled the pinata. Seldom did they mention 
Clinton's behavior or his central role in the report. Rep. John Conyers 
Jr. of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the committee, set the tone 
in his opening statement, calling Starr's report ``tawdry, salacious 
and unnecessarily graphic'' and portraying him as an obsessed Inspector 
Javert. ``The idea of a federally paid sex policeman spending millions 
of dollars to trap an unfaithful spouse or to police civil litigation 
would have been unthinkable prior to the Starr investigation,'' Conyers 
said. ``Let there be no mistake,'' he continued. ``It is not now acceptable 
in America to investigate a person's private sexual activity. It is 
not acceptable to force mothers to testify against their daughters, 
to make lawyers testify against the people they protect or to make 
bookstores tell what books people read.'' Democrats also zeroed in 
on the fact that Starr did not announce until Thursday that he had 
exonerated Clinton in the firing of employees in the White House travel 
office and in the White House's mishandling of FBI files. ``Why did 
you withhold that before the elections when you were sending us a 
referral?'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., asked Starr. ``In other words, 
you don't have anything to say unless you have something bad to say.'' 
And they questioned him about his office's treatment of Monica Lewinsky, 
who they believe was dissuaded from calling her lawyer during her 
initial conversations with investigators. But Republicans, stirred 
into action by the offensive, came to Starr's defense. ``If the law 
and the facts are against you, just argue like the devil,'' said Rep. 
Charles Canady, R-Fla., repeating ``something that lawyers said 2,000 
years ago.'' ``I think the punch line on that is beat up the lawyer,'' 
Hyde chimed in. The facts, Canady continued, indicate there is ``a 
pattern of calculated'' misconduct by Clinton. ``What we're hearing 
here is a grab bag of anything that occurs to try to undermine your 
credibility and, of course, this committee's process has been attacked 
in the same way.'' The partisanship appeared to be infectious. Outside, 
protesters gathered to shout slurs against Starr or Clinton. Documentary 
filmmakers scurried about collecting footage. At one point, an actor 
dressed as Thomas Jefferson, a white wig on his head, his oversized 
belly bursting out of his frock, interrupted a Republican news conference 
and shouted: ``I had an affair. Impeach me, too.'' The police hustled 
him away. As the day wore on, the proceedings took on a somewhat lighter 
tone at times. Hyde became more jovial, accommodating Democrats on 
a routine basis. Democrats, too, eased up a bit, their adrenalin dropping 
off as the hours ticked away. Even the biting remarks carried a few 
strains of levity. ``I hope the seating arrangement is OK,'' Hyde 
said with a smirk in one of his trademark asides to Conyers, his seat 
mate. ``That's about all you haven't complained about.'' But neither 
side lightened up in its questioning of Starr. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., 
challenged him several times to tell the truth under oath, particularly 
on whether he had first heard of a tape recording about a woman's 
sexual conduct with Clinton as early as November 1997. The question 
clearly rattled Starr, who said he did not know but would check his 
records. During the hearing and at a break a few minutes later, Ms. 
Lofgren offered no new evidence to support her query. ``It's just 
an innocent question, and that's all I'm going to say about it,'' 
Ms. Lofgren said.
