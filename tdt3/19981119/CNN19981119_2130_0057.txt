After committee members completed their questioning, it was president 
clinton's personal attorney's turn. Among other issues, David Kendall 
pressed Starr on the issue of leaks of grand jury information. Are 
you saying that the journalists invented sources like prosecutors 
painted a different picture, "sources in Starr's office tell us," 
"sources near Starr," does the media make up those quotes, Mr. ? I'm 
not here to accuse the media of anything. I am here to say that fairness 
requires us to be able to litigate this matter, which as you well 
know,under seal, and litigate that in an orderly way. And then to 
come to a judgment as to the significance of that, but I will simply 
say that the law of this circuit makes it quite easy for you to say, 
look at this sourcing. I get to now put the Burden on the prosecutor, 
to come forward and show evidence that the prosecutor is not the source. 
Mr. Starr -- And David, that's what we're doing. Mr. Starr, in fact 
flrks's been no case remotely similar to this in terms of the massive 
leaking from the prosecutor's office. I totally disagree with that. 
That's an accusation, an unfair accusation. I completely reject it, 
and I would say, David, let's wait until the litigation has concluded.
