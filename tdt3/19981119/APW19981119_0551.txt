A jeep carrying relatives of a former federal Cabinet minister hit 
a land mine in Kashmir Thursday, killing a body guard and seriously 
injuring a son and a daughter of the politician. Police said the family 
of Mohammed Maqbool Dar, junior home minister until his government 
was toppled in March elections, was traveling near their home village 
of Shangus, 55 kilometers (34 miles) south of Srinagar, the state 
capital when the jeep hit a mine believed planted by separatists. 
Dar was not in the jeep. The guard was killed on the spot and Dar's 
25-year-old son Muzafar and 30-year-old daughter Shamina were taken 
to a Srinagar hospital. No other details were immediately available. 
Muslim militants have been fighting since 1989 in Kashmir, saying 
predominately Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state should be independent 
or part of neighboring, officially Islamic Pakistan. India accuses 
Pakistan of fomenting the insurgency, but Pakistan says it lends the 
militants only moral support. India and Pakistan have fought two wars 
over Kashmir since both countries gained independence from Britain 
in 1947. Both claim all of the Himalayan territory, which is divided 
between them.
