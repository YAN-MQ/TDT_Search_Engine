Authorities arrested 77 illegal immigrants in a nationwide raid that 
ended early Thursday, police said. Singapore's 22nd raid this year 
also netted four Singaporeans accused of employing or harboring the 
illegal foreigners. The tiny city-state has been acutely concerned 
over rising illegal immigration and associated crime since the start 
of the regional economic crisis, and officials have feared a flood 
from poorer neighboring countries. Figures on the total number of 
illegal immigrants and visa over-stayers arrested this year were not 
immediately available, but the number is thought to have reached record 
levels. Illegal immigrants face a maximum punishment of six months 
in jail and caning, while those who employ or house them can be jailed 
up to two years and fined.
