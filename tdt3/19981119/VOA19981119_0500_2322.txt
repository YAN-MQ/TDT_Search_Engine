jailed near Rome. Turkish Prime Minister Meisut Yelmin says Italy 
will be an accomplice to terrorism and mass murder, unless it hands

Delaima rejects Turkey's harsh rhetoric and says Italy cannot extradite

has asked for political asylum in Italy. Washington is urging Italy 
to find a way to extradite Mr. Erchelon to Turkey.
