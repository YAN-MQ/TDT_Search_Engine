Looks LIKu it's gonna be rather chilly today through the upper midwest. 
Forecast highs through much of Minnesota and the dakotas will be only 
in the 20s after some fresh snow yesterday. It remains warm in the 
southeast, but that will change around by later today. A frontal system 
hdads towards the eastern seaboard, bringing with it scattered showers. 
In the pacific borthwest, a major storm systdm will be moving inland, 
bringing with it high winds and some heavy rainfall -- one of a series 
of storms that will affect the pacific northwest over the next couple 
of days. In fact, on Saturday, more rain and windy conditions are 
expected. Snow showers into eastern Canada, as temperatures pill be 
cold through the Great Lakes in through much of the NoRtheast. It 
warms up by Sunday in that vicinity, but the rain continues in the
