November is the beggining of the holiday shopping season here in the 
United States. And this year, more consumers than ever before are 
expected to do their shopping on the Internet with an expected jump 
of more than 300 percent over last year's totals. Blo -- books, music 
and computers are the biggest-selling items on line, because they 
can be bought without being tried or even touched. And national polls 
indicate that about 20 million Americans are already making purchases 
on line. Internet shopping consultant Kathy Peale says the majority 
of the companies selling on line are based here in the United States. 
You can buy on line from -- from wherever you are in the world. And 
really, this is a great way to get products from the United States, 
if you're in another country. Say, like, if you need a computer, you 
can have one shipped to you and customized, too, if you know the brand 
of clothing and the size you wear, you can log in to that -- to that 
brand or that store and it's really easy to purchase things like that 
wherever you are in the world. World wide, considerable spending on 
the web which totaled about $2 billion in 1996, is expected to hit 
$20 billion by next year and soar to 95 billion by the year 2002. 
That's the look at business news, I promised you, I'm Paul Westfielding 
in Washington.
