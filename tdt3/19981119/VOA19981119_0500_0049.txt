This is VOA News. I'm Steve Norman in Washington. President Clinton 
is in Japan on a scaled-back trip to Asia. After landing in Tokyo, 
Mr. Clinton paid a courtesy call on the emperor and he has just now 
concluded a televised town meeting in Tokyo where he encourage the 
people of Japan to be optimistic and to continue their work toward 
ending their economic problems. Well, don't be discouraged, but do 
be determined. That would be the advice of a friend. And we -- I say 
that because we have been through our tough times. We have learned 
so much from you. And the last point I want to make is the best days 
of Japan and the best days of America lay before us in the 21st century, 
if we determine to go there together. Thank you very much. And then, 
following that thank you, lots of applause went on for too long to 
give to you in this newscast. President Clinton and Japanese Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi begin formal talks tomorrow. Japan's slumping 
economy, the regional financial problems and bilateral defense ties 
expected to top their agenda.
