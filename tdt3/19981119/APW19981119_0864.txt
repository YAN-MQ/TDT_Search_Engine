Greece's capital may be in danger of permanent gridlock unless its 
transit system is radically expanded, the multinational consortium 
building its new metro warned Thursday. ``If serious measures are 
not taken, an impasse is unavoidable,'' Leonidas Kykiras, chairman 
of the multinational consortium, told a local radio station. Known 
as Attiko Metro, the consortium is building the capital's new dlrs 
2.2 billion subway. It played a key role in the International Olympic 
Committee's decision to grant Athens the 2004 Summer Games. It is 
to be finished by 2000. According to Kykiras, a new 18-kilometer (11-mile) 
extension to Athens' existing metro system must be made six-times 
bigger. Attiko metro proposed adding another 105 kilometers (65 miles) 
to the subway. It also suggested the network should be complemented 
with extensive tram and light railway systems. The total cost of the 
improvement was estimated at nearly dlrs 9 billion Public Works Minister 
Costas Laliotis reserved judgment on the proposal, but said it would 
be examined. Kykiras based his claim on a three-year study led by 
the consortium which predicted that by 2020, cars in greater Athens 
will almost double from their current number of about 1.5 million. 
Funded by the European Union, the study predicted that the population 
in greater Athens' will swell to nearly 5 million. It is now home 
to just over 4 million people, or nearly half the country's population 
of 10.2 million. The Attiko Metro consortium is made up of of 23 companies, 
including Greek, French and German ones. Bechtel International Inc. 
of California is acting as consultant. Premier Costas Simitis has 
committed his government to improving the capital's cheap but notoriously 
tiresome transit system. Efforts to streamline and improve public 
transport have so far been stymied, met by a strike campaign waged 
by employees at state-owned transit companies.
