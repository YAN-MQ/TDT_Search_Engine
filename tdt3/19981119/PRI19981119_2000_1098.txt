Picture this, you are a young financial trader just starting out in 
London. Your German employer is teaching you using a new electronic 
computerized training system. There you are, eager and efficient, 
typing on your computer, practicing trading in pork bellies and the 
like. Then you press the wrong button and OOP's you have just executed 
a trade that costs your company roughly $15 million. That's exactly 
what happened in London according to today's Daily Telegraph Newspaper. 
While neither the name of the trainee nor the company have been disclosed, 
traders are astounded that such a thing could happen. Justin Erkhardt 
Stewart is the director of Barclays' Stock Brokerage. Well, it's absolutely 
staggering, I mean the fact that someone can actually press a button 
and find themselves trading in such a position like this. Good electronic 
trading systems should not allow that to happen, particularly when 
he was a trainee. But they did. No word yet on whether the money will 
be deducted from the trainee's next two or three thousand paychecks.
