With just hours to go before impeachment hearings against him are 
to begin in the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, President Clinton 
is half a world away in Tokyo. Regional economic and security issues 
top the agenda for his visit. VOA's Deborah Tate reports from the 
Japanese capital. As Washington focuses on his political troubles, 
Mr. Clinton wants to be seen as a leader engaged on the world's stage. 
Upon his arrival here, the president was accorded a reception given 
to few foreign dignitaries, a tea with Emperor Akihito and Emperess 
Michiko at their emperial residence. Later Mr. Clinton will hold a 
televised town hall meeting the Japanese people. He is expected to 
use the forum to hear firsthand how the Japanese are coping with their 
country's worst recession since World War II. Economic issues will 
also be the focus of Mr. Clinton's talks with Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi on Friday. The President is expected to appeal to the Japanese 
leader to do more to rebuild the country's economy. For his part, 
Mr. Obuchi will likely reassure Mr. Clinton that a $195 billion stimulus 
package he unveiled just days ago will move the economy in the right 
direction. U.S. officials have said they believe the plan does not 
go far enough. Besides economic issues, the two leaders are also expected 
to discuss security issues, particularly the nuclear threat posed 
by North Korea. On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department announced 
that Pyong Yang denied a U.S. request to allow an inspection of an 
underground construction site that Washington suspects may be intended 
for nuclear purposes. North Korea had sought financial compensation 
in return for the inspection, a condition U.S. officials rejected. 
The dispute threatens an agreement under which the United States and 
its allies will supply two whitewater reactors to North Korea in exchange 
for Pyong Yang freezing its nuclear program. It is more difficult 
to produce plutonium needed for nuclear weapons from whitewater reactors 
than it is from the grapyte nuclear reactors used by North Korea. 
The North Korean nuclear issue was expected to be the main topic when 
Mr. Clinton visits Seoul, South Korea later in the week. Deborah Tate, 
VOA News, Tokyo.
