The Maine Supreme Court has upheld a ruling that says a mother can 
refuse to treat her HIV-infected son with a powerful combination of 
drugs. The mother was worried the drug cocktail could kill the 4-year-old 
boy. The court ruled the mother isn't causing an imminent threat to 
the boy. But it warned the state can demand treatment if the boy's 
health worsens or a new medical procedure is developed.
