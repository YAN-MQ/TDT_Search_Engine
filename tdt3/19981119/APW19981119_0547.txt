China is making progress on complying with new U.S. regulations that 
will require treatment of solid wood packing materials to prevent 
the spread of the Asian long-horned beetle, a U.S. official said Thursday. 
Chinese officials have accused Washington of using the ban on untreated 
wooden crates as a form of trade protectionism, particularly given 
the growing U.S. trade deficit with China. But Isi Siddiqui, deputy 
assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Marketing 
and Regulatory Programs, said China has begun to realize the seriousness 
of the issue, especially following an October visit by a delegation 
of Chinese officials to beetle-infested sites. ``They were impressed 
with the necessity of why the U.S. is doing this,'' Siddiqui told 
reporters in Beijing. The officials saw ``a visual, graphic display 
of what we are facing.'' China has already notified shippers, exporters 
and state-owned enterprises of the regulations, Siddiqui said. Non-compliance 
with the rules could delay shipments, he added. Under the rules, wooden 
packaging for goods leaving China on or after Dec. 17 must be treated 
with chemicals, heat or fumigation to get rid of the tree-destroying 
beetles. Shipments must have official certificates guaranteeing they 
were treated, while exports without wooden packaging must have documents 
declaring the contents wood-free. China estimates that goods worth 
dlrs 30 billion to dlrs 40 billion, or 50 to 60 percent of China's 
annual exports to the United States, would be affected by the ban. 
U.S. officials say that unchecked, the long-horned beetle could cause 
as much as dlrs 138 billion in damage to the U.S. economy. No known 
pesticides or predators can kill the beetle, which preys on maples 
and fruit trees. Once infested with the bug, a tree must be removed, 
chipped and burned, Siddiqui said.
