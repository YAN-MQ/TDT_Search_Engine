When the cabaret star Andrea Marcovicci flashes a melting smile and 
flicks away the suggestion of a tear from eyes that shine with a fervent 
nostalgia, pop music history opens up like a treasured scrapbook full 
of pressed flowers and faded photographs. Shopworn dreams of old-time 
Hollywood shed their tarnish, and the fantasy of a lost and glorious 
show business past materializes. Ms. Marcovicci's conjuring powers 
have rarely been more persuasive than in her new cabaret show at the 
Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, where she is saluting Noel Coward 
through Jan. 2. The rose-colored portrait she creates through songs, 
anecdotes and excerpts from Coward's poetry is of a fellow romantic. 
In describing Coward's restless homosexual love life, she comes up 
with a quotation in which he lamented being ``no good at love'' because 
of his need to imagine the bitter end of a relationship at its outset. 
She tells us that ``Mad About the Boy'' was not written about Cary 
Grant, as has been commonly supposed, but about James Cagney. The 
ballad-oriented show is crammed with Coward chestnuts, including ``I'll 
Follow My Secret Heart,'' ``Someday I'll Find You,'' ``If Love Were 
All'' and ``I'll See You Again.'' Accompanied on the piano by Shelly 
Markham at Tuesday's opening night show, Ms. Marcovicci delivered 
them in her characteristically breathless style, alternating among 
speech song, a grainy low alto and a thin tremulous soprano. While 
she emphasized Coward's sentimentality, his witty patter songs stood 
out as his finest. ``Why Must the Show Go On?'' and ``Why Do the Wrong 
People Travel?'' have crackling incisiveness that matches the best 
of Ogden Nash and Cole Porter.
