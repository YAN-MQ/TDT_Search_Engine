Britain has tested a live tomahawk cruise missile for the first time. 
The submarine "hms splendid" fired the missile from beneath the ocean 
wednesday at a test building on San Clemente island off the California 
coast. The missile traveled a good 500 miles before hitting the Mark. 
The "splendid" is the first British sub to be equipped with the U.S.-made 
tomahawks.
