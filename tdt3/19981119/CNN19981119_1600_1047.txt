Calling John Glenn. Shares of satellite giant shares of satellite 
giant Panamsat are falling out of orbit today. The stock down. That 
after the company said in an S.E.C. filing that battery problems in 
an orbiting satellite have caused service disruptions and could lead 
to customers canceling contracts. Panamsat suffered a similar satellite 
failure earlier this year which knocked out pager and television service 
for days.
