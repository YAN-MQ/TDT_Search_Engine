The Russian parliament is debating a Bill to establish a minimum wage 
and government pensions. Most politicians agree there are necessary 
basics. For women -- six pairs of pantyhose and five pairs of underwear 
every two years, a skirt and dress every five years, a winter coat 
every eight. The politicians also seem to agree that a poor Russian 
should be entitled to one bath towel, as well, every 23 years.
