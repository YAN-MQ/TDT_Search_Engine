The U.N. General Assembly has adopted a resolution supporting promotion 
of millennium celebrations in Bethlehem by the Palestinian Self-Rule 
Authority. The resolution was introduced Wednesday by Senegal and 
was adopted by consensus. It calls on the international community 
to increase assistance to Palestinians to ensure the success of the 
Bethlehem 2000 project. The Bethlehem celebrations are due to begin 
at Christmas 1999 and conclude at Easter 2001. They will involve religious 
and cultural events that Palestinians organizers hope will attract 
some two million foreign tourists. Bethlehem is the West Bank town 
where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born nearly 2,000 years 
ago.
