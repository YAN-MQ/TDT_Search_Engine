Which brings us to this edition of "the cutting edge." What if it 
didn't take 12 hours to fly from the east coast of the United States 
to Asia? That would be a revolution in travel. Here's ABC's Jack Smith. 
Technology on "the cutting edge." Imagine flying from New York to 
Tokyo in just an hour and to Paris in 45 minutes. And coast-to-coast 
in half an hour. Even flying today's supersonic Concord at twice the 
speed of sound, pilots in this cockpit cannot come anywhere close 
to that. But now there's a plane being designed, unlike any other, 
that can. It's called hypersoar. A plane that would travel ten times 
the speed of sound, nearly 7,000 miles per hour. These airplanes have 
to be very, very slender, very, very, sharp. That gives it very little 
drag so it can slice through the air at high speeds. But the main 
secret to hypersoar's performance is that it spends most of its time 
in space, at 130,000 feet skipping over the atmosphere. That's right, 
skipping. Just the way a stone skips over a lake. You get an enormous 
lifting effect from skipping across the lake. And if you could burn, 
if you could somehow give some propulsion every time you skipped, 
then you would be able to go completely across the lake with very 
little energy. That's what hypersoar does. Because it's in space it 
doesn't overheat and because it only uses its engine every two minutes 
to keep its skip going, it doesn't use much fuel. The engine prototype 
being tested is part rocket, for gaining altitude, part jet, foskipping. 
It is similar to the engine on the Sr-71 spy plane, and exceptionally 
efficient. A hypersoar vehicle will be able to carry payload and passengers 
at one-fifth the cost. Of today's airliners? Of today's airliners. 
Passengers, however might find the roller-coaster motion difficult, 
one and a half times the force of gravity with every skip. If you 
think about the thrill of a large swing, a child's swing, 1 1/2 Gs 
is what you feel at the bottom of the swing. HYPERSOAR is expected 
to find its first use replacing today's air force bombers. But it 
could also carry satellites into space. And, of course, ordinary freight. 
Federal express' motto could change from "when it absolutely has to 
be there overnight," to "when it absolutely has to be there in two 
hours." a breakthrough in airplane design that changes, not only how 
we travel, but also how we think about our world. Jack Smith, ABC 
News, Livermore, California.
