It's been a long day for independent counsel Ken Starr. Morning through 
evening, he's faced questions at the impeachment inquiry of President 
Clinton. Republicans and democrats on the house Judiciary committee 
took turns asking him about his investigation, with democrats attacking 
his tactics and republicans defending his work. The committee members 
clashed sharply among each other as well. Democrats complained about 
procedural points at almost every step, claiming they didn't get an 
opportunity to fully engage the independent counsel. At several points, 
committee chairman Henry Hyde criticized democrats for using their 
allotted time to make accusations against Starr without giving him 
time to respond.
