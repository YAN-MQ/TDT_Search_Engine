A painful period of black-on-black violence in South Africa will be 
probed next week, when a Cabinet minister seeks amnesty before a human 
rights panel. Public Works Minister Jeff Radebe is applying for amnesty 
from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for his role in organizing 
and arming self defense units (SDUs) that operated in KwaZulu-Natal 
from 1990 to 1994, as South African was emerging from decades of apartheid. 
He is the first Cabinet minister of the ruling African National Congress 
to appear at a public amnesty hearing. Last month, the Truth Commission 
released a five-volume report on testimony from victims of apartheid-era 
political violence and assigned major blame for human rights violations 
to the National Party, apartheid's architect. But it also cited black 
anti-apartheid struggle groups for their excesses. The commission 
has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess their crimes and 
can demonstrate a political motive _ a process expected to last well 
into next year as decisions are made on over 7,000 amnesty applications. 
The period leading up to 1994's first democratic elections, while 
political groups were trying to negotiate an end to white minority 
rule, saw a dramatic escalation in violence. Much of it centered in 
KwaZulu-Natal, where over 5,000 people died in clashes between Inkatha 
Freedom Party Zulu nationalists and the Self Defense Units. The Zulu 
groups, called Self Protection Units (SPUs), were backed by the apartheid 
government, according to the Truth Commission's report. Radebe was 
ANC chairman for the KwaZulu-Natal region and also served as an underground 
commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the ANC's armed 
wing. He acted under direct orders of the armed wing's military intelligence, 
Radebe states in his application. Monday's hearing will also consider 
applications from other high ranking ANC officials, including a former 
ANC member of Parliament and a current captain in the South African 
National Defense Force The conflict between the ANC and Inkatha spilled 
over into Johannesburg's urban areas, 300 kilometers (180 miles) north 
west of KwaZulu-Natal. A second amnesty committee will start hearing 
applications in Johannesburg on that conflict, also starting Monday. 
In the past ten years, over 10,000 people have died in the Kwa-Zulu 
clashes that continue to boil over four years after the elections.
