Meanwhile, a U.S. envoy in Seoul after two days of talks in North 
Korea says the United States has failed in an attempt to convince 
Pyong Yang to allow inspections of suspected underground nuclear tests 
sites. John Larken reports from Seoul that the stalemate poses a serious 
threat to a 1994 deal freezing the communist North's nuclear program. 
Washington's point man on North Korea, Charles Kartman warned Thursday 
that his talks in Pyong Yang failed to narrow the gap between the 
two sides on the inspections issue. He said the 1994 deal under which 
the North gets two safe nuclear reactors and oil deliveries, in return 
for freezing work on facilities capable of producing weapons grade 
plutonium was in danger of unraveling. The U.S. suspects the North 
is violating the agreement by building a new underground nuclear facility 
near Yang Byon where an older reactor was shut down after the agreement 
was sealed. But Pyong Yang insists the facility has a civilian purpose 
and is demanding cash from Washington in exchange for permission to 
inspect the site. Mr. Kartman who is Washington's special envoy to 
North Korea issued his stern warning during a briefing after his return 
from 12-hours talks in Pyong Yang which he described as intensive. 
His was the highest level U.S. delegation to visit Pyong Yang since 
1994. But Washington did not expect any major breakthroughs. State 
Department Spokesman James Rubin says that Mr. Kartman's purpose was 
to persuade the North that Washington took the issue very seriously. 
Mr. Rubin said the Kartman delegation had rejected Pyong Yang's demands 
for cash compensation, but the two sides agreed to meet again. He 
refused to say how much money the North had demanded in exchange for 
inspections. This is John Larkin for VOA News, Seoul.
