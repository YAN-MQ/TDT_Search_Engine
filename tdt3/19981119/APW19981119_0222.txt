Russia's lower house of parliament drafted its own version of the 
START-II nuclear disarmament treaty on Thursday, a top official said. 
Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of Russia's lower house, the State 
Duma, said hardliners initially opposed to the treaty are likely to 
pass the new version because it ``stipulates several conditions which 
would ensure Russia's national security,'' according to the Interfax 
news agency. Some deputies in the Duma, mostly hard-line Communists, 
have stalled on ratifying START-II because they say Russia does not 
have the money to replace nuclear stockpiles that would be destroyed 
under the agreement. But Seleznyov said the new document would guarantee 
financing for nuclear arms after START-II is implemented. Various 
Duma committees will now discuss the draft for 10 days. Deputies say 
they want President Boris Yeltsin to study it, and then they will 
begin discussions in December on finally ratifying it, said Vladimir 
Lukin, the head of the Duma's committee for international affairs. 
The United States Senate has already ratified the treaty.
