A fire of unknown origin has severely damaged California's oldest 
working pier, Stearns wharf in Santa Barbara. Firefighters fought 
the flames from above and below. And one firefighter was slightly 
injured. The blaze charred the center part of the wooden wharf and 
destroyed three businesses. Inrestigators say it could take days to 
determine how and where the fire started. The wharf was built in 1872.
