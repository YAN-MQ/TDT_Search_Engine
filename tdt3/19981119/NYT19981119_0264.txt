The delightful ``Waking Ned Devine'' takes place in the picturesque 
Irish village of Tulaigh Mohr (or Tully More). There are 52 souls 
here, and 51 pairs of eyes twinkle. (One sour old woman is the unofficial 
town witch.) There also happens to be a winning lottery ticket somewhere 
in the village, and the film starts with a tireless campaign by Jackie 
O'Shea (Ian Bannen) to root out the luckiest of his neighbors. Leading 
questions (like ``So tell us, are you going to take a holiday this 
year?'') don't turn up any obvious mad money, though. Aided hilariously 
by his wife, Annie (Fionnula Flanagan), and a fellow codger, Michael 
O'Sullivan (David Kelly), Jackie carries out his detective work while 
the film introduces its sharply-etched rustic characters. Kirk Jones, 
who wrote and directed this blithe comedy, has been a prize-winning 
director of television commercials. And he has the knack of finding 
rubbery, expressive faces and letting each villager's quirks emerge 
on cue. His Tully More soon seems a jolly close-knit community where 
an audience can easily linger, savoring characters like the love-struck 
pig farmer (James Nesbitt), whose lovely lass won't marry him until 
he does something about that smell. ``If it weren't for the pigs, 
I'd marry you tomorrow!'' Maggie (Susan Lynch) declares. ``Ay, look 
at that: we're already 50 pounds and one meat pie lighter!'' grouses 
Jackie to Annie, when their efforts to bribe (fruity soaps for the 
pig farmer) and cajole (a meat pie for a newly happy-looking lady) 
likely suspects fail to get results. Then Jackie and Michael cook 
up the idea of a chicken dinner for the 18 biggest lottery players 
in town, and a funny thing happens: One chicken dinner goes unclaimed. 
It was intended for a neighbor named Ned Devine. And Ned proves to 
be the local person least likely to cash in a lottery ticket on his 
own steam. The rest of this good-hearted film concerns Jackie and 
Michael's efforts to create a lively, plausible Ned for the sake of 
a visiting lottery official. Conveniently, the lottery man is a sneezer, 
so he announces his whereabouts as clearly as the clock-swallowing 
crocodile who stalked Captain Hook. This gives an extra screwball 
quality to the old men's efforts to con him. Giddiest of all is the 
point when Kelly and then Bannen, each of whom is about 70, wind up 
speeding down back roads on a motorcycle naked. Though ``Waking Ned 
Devine'' doesn't have the tart edge of ``The Full Monty,'' it does 
share that film's flair for making an improbably funny spectacle of 
men in the buff. ``Waking Ned Devine,'' whose title suggests the hearty 
Irish wake that the film finally becomes, differs from most lottery 
stories in that it turns out to be about generosity, not about divisive 
greed. Johnson has said he had something like a faster-paced ``Local 
Hero'' in mind. His film doesn't match the quirky enchantment of that 
one, but it does have a similarly benign spirit. Shot in a government-owned 
historical village on the Isle of Man, this film also shares the sense 
of having wandered into a quaint, isolated world with its own set 
of rules. ``Waking Ned Devine'' could never work as well as it does 
without the wonderful performances of the scrawny, supremely dignified 
Kelly (a veteran stage actor who also worked on ``Fawlty Towers''), 
the hearty Bannen and Ms. Flannagan as a wife who shares her husband's 
taste for mischief and his case of lottery fever. (italics)``Waking
