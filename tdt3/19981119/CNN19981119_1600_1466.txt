Holly Hunter has a new film on the big screen, "living out loud." 
And a role in a play called "impossible marriage." She teamed up with 
Beth henly, as she often has during her career. Cynthia Tornquist 
caught up with both of them. Where you going? Liz invited me to this 
after hours place downtown called -- Holly Hunter's latest film "living 
out loud" casts her as a woman who discovers her place in the world 
through a series of relationships. It is familiar territory for the 
actress who has earned an academy award playing another woman who 
felt out of place in "the piano." You won't be able to play it. But 
Hunter's exploration of the female psyche are not limited to film. 
She has brought her talents to the New York stage with "impossible 
marriage." She is a woman who is trying to prevent the marriage of 
her younger sister. She's trying to sabotage the wedding. Why are 
you marrying this man? The play marks the seventh collaboration with 
playwright Beth henley. Hunter and henley seem to have a lot in common. 
Both are southern. Both share a physical resemblance. And both have 
helped each other's careers. Henley launched Hunter's stage career 
while Hunter brought attention to henley's plays with her quirky performances. 
I think Beth is fragile and ferocious. And I think she's a great poet 
as well. And very few poets are working today as playwrights. I feel 
lucky every time she plays one of my characters because she has an 
innate instinct of how these characters think on a deeper level than 
I even conceive. Henley's plays include "the wake of jamey Foster," 
"the lucky spot," and "abundance." She has also written for the big 
screen, including "nobody's fool" along with the adaptations of two 
of her own plays. "Crimes of the heart" won her a Pulitzer prize in 
1981 and earned her an academy award nomination. "The miss firecracker 
contest" cast Hunter as a beauty queen wannabe. Hunter says she relates 
to henley's characters. I think she deals with breaking out, with 
protest. But it's protest in a civilized structure. And who better 
to play it than an actress who has made a career of "living out loud" 
on film and stage. Cynthia Tornquist, New York.
