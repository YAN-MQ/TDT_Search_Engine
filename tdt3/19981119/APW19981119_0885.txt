Since Danes tend to hoard when they get nervous, the state bank Thursday 
slowed destruction of old bank notes to make sure it has enough cash 
on hand in case depositors panic over the so-called millennium bug. 
Many fear that the turn of the year 2000 will leave computers, including 
those use by banks, crippled because older programs might crash when 
the year turns from '99 to '00. Some computers might not recognize 
the year 2000, or interpret '00 to mean the year 1900. While the state 
Central Bank said there was no evidence that Danes had begun hoarding 
bank notes, it was taking no chances. ``We want people to know that 
that we have enough notes so there is no reason to start hoarding,'' 
Bjarne Skafte of the central Nationalbanken told The Associated Press. 
The bank plans to stockpile an extra 20 billion kroner (dlrs 3.2 billion) 
in cash by 2000 simply by slowing down the rate at which it shred 
olds currency notes. Earlier this year, word of an impending strike 
by bank workers had Danes hoarding gasoline, food and other products. 
Usually placid Danes were actually getting into scuffles when supplies 
began to dwindle. Henrik Theil, of the Danish Bankers' Association, 
said the thought of Danes hoarding cash and products on the even of 
the new millennium was not a pleasant one. ``We would like to avoid 
(again) see grownup Danes fight over (a package of) yeast in supermarkets,'' 
Theil said.
