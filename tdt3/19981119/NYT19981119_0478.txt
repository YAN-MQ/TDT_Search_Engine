After weeks of resistance, China has begun efforts to comply with 
the coming U.S. ban on imports containing untreated wood-packing material, 
a visiting U.S. agriculture official said Thursday. The ban, intended 
to protect American trees from the Asian long-horned beetle, which 
crosses the Pacific in raw wood, will affect shipments that use wood 
pallets or crates _ 25 percent to 50 percent of all exports to the 
United States from China. If Chinese companies do not change materials 
or begin treating wood with pesticides or heat by Dec. 17, a flow 
of goods worth $63 billion could be disrupted. When the rule was first 
announced in September, China's government-guided media attacked the 
ban as a devious trade weapon and suggested that it might be negotiable. 
Later, the Chinese sought a 90-day extension, which was denied. In 
the last month, officials here began confronting the problem, notifying 
shippers of the new requirements. But U.S. officials said they did 
not know how many Chinese shippers had taken adequate steps, such 
as arranging for anti-pest treatments or finding new packing materials. 
If there appear to be widespread violations next month, then traders 
can expect long delays at U.S. States ports as many more cargoes are 
subjected to inspections, warned the visiting official, Isi Siddiqui, 
a deputy assistant secretary of agriculture.
