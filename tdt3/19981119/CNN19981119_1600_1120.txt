That is "Dollars & Sense", Lori. Thanks, Beverly. Coming up next in 
"Headline Sports," one of this year's sultans of swing in baseball 
picks up another honor. My dad always said: as soon as I get a computer 
you'll come out with something better. So, to make sure people like 
dad have the latest computer we invented your:)ware-- technology that 
grows with you. For just $49.95 a month you can buy a computer with 
an Intel Pentium II processor Internet access and in two years you 
can trade it in towards the purchase of a new one. What do you call 
this thing? Your:)ware. Call 1-800-gateway and let's talk about your:)ware.
