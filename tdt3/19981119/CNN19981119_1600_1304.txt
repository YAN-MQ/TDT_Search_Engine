The New England Patriots plan to leave Foxboro and move to Hartford 
in 2001. Team owner Robert kraft and Connecticut governor John Rowland 
made the announcement at a morning news conference. It's a tentative 
deal that spells out a set of legislative and economic conditions 
that would bring the pats to a new downtown stadium in the state capital. 
The New England Patriots will play their first home game in Hartford 
in the fall of 2001. I want you, everyone in this room to know that 
I personally believe that this is a great day for all the fans of 
the New England Patriots, my family and our team.
