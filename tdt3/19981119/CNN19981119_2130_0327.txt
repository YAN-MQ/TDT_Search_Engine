We now have the story from miles O'Brien. A piece of the space station 
going up tonight. Here's miles. Still going. Just shy of its 13th 
anniversary in orbit, the Russian space station Mir is manned -- and 
marching on -- eight years longer than originally planned, and despite 
a dizzying list of failures, foul-UPS and financial woes. It became 
my home. And I was pretty comfortable in it. Russian cosmonaut Sergei 
krikalev spent more than a year on Mir. Station-tested veterans like 
him and the seemingly indestructible craft they once called home make 
the Russians invaluable players in the 16-nation partnership building 
-- the international space station. What's the most important thing 
they bring? I think experience. The experience of space flight, experience 
doing things in space. We have temperature. That is why the U.S./Russian 
space partnership began in earnest here in 1995. Seven U.S. astronauts 
spent a total of about 1,000 days living, working -- and, as it turns 
out, responding to various emergencies -- aboard Mir. Computers and 
air purifiers failed. A flash fire filled the outpost with smoke. 
And in perhaps the most serious incident of all, an errant supply 
ship crashed into Mir, puncturing a hole in a Module. The fact that 
they occurred and people responded to them successfully and kept the 
mission going, I think did teach us a lot. Frank culbertson should 
know. He ran the shuttle/Mir program for NASA, and he says the trial 
by fire has lead to specific design changes in the international space 
station, which already mimics Mir's modular concept. Critics of the 
partnership say the U.S./Russian partnership it is more about sending 
hard currency into an ailing economy than about lofting rockets into 
space. Funding to the Russian space program is a mess. This past year, 
the Russian government cut space station funding in half to about 
$160 million. So far, the Russian space agency has seen only about 
$20 million of that. Thanks to a $600 million bailout by NASA, the 
Russians appear to be on track with their critical contribution for 
the international space station. The fact that we have been able to 
overcome such difficulties over the last five years, to be on the 
eve of launching our first element, is more a Testament of the willingness 
and dedication of the people involved to recognize and deal with the 
problems, to find ways to overcome those problems. So can-do NASA 
meets build it to last Russia. Both parties hope it's a match made 
in heaven. Miles O'Brien, CNN.
