Stanley tucci takes on the title role in a new cable-TV movie that 
looks at the life of legendary gossip columnist and broadcaster Walter 
winchell. Sherri Sylvester has a preview. Flash, Washington, when 
he landed -- He was Hitler's enemy, fdr's friend and William Randolph 
Hearst's employee. As a columnist and radio man, he spoke to 55 million 
people a day, a market share news executives will never see again, 
nor will any one journalist carry the kind of power enjoyed by Walter 
winchell. He was capable of acts of tremendous generosity and of real 
cruelty. When he had a political agenda, or any agenda, he put that 
forth and nothing would stop him. Good evening all the ships at sea. 
Stanley tucci stars in the HBO telefilm, "winchell." Paul mazursky 
directs. The column was extremely powerful because a good mention 
from winchell about a performance would ensure whoever he wrote about 
more success, probably a higher salary. A mention in winchell's column 
was gold. My column showed you into office. And my column can show 
you out again. It's your decision. Winchell would use blackmail to 
get information, then deliver it in his own stylistic "slanguage" 
at 230 words per minute. The key thing for me was his voice, and I 
worked on the voice for months. I would play tapes for people, and 
sometimes, they couldn't tell the difference. The Americans who worries 
about our being too cruel to the Nazis should first visit the wounded 
Americans in the nearest military hospital. That's what makes America 
great. The telefilm, based on a biography by one of winchell's ghostwriters, 
alleges that fdr used him to promote his policies. Winchell's success 
included his stance against Hitler. And I'm not going to stop writing 
about Hitler until there's nothing left to write about Hitler. His 
support in later years of McCarthy's anticommunist blacklisting brought 
his downfall. As for today's political scandals, tucci says the media 
coverage of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky goes far beyond 
winchell's style. It's out of hand -- tapes being released and reports 
being released with all of this stuff that really nobody should know 
about. Walter winchell would be wincing. He would be embarrassed. 
The world will never know. Winchell died a broken man, deprived of 
the power he had used and abused. Sherri Sylvester, CNN, Los Angeles.
