It was not until the 11th hour of a long and grueling day of testimony 
that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's measured, unflappably academic 
performance before the Judiciary Committee began to wear thin. Until 
then, when he got into a knife-edged lawyers' duel with David Kendall, 
President Clinton's attorney, Starr's testimony resounded through 
the day with anticlimax after all the long months of salacious news 
and sensational accusations that have left the president facing impeachment. 
The independent counsel so long out of public sight except for his 
morning taking-out-the-garbage photo opportunities finally stepped 
forth to speak in defense of his case before a skittish Congress and 
apprehensive nation. Far from offering another lengthy narrative on 
DNA results and lurid Oval Office behavior, Starr chose to beam judiciousness 
and managed to hide any rancor as he faced minority Democrats aching 
to wrestle him into the dock in substitution of the president. But 
as he faced Kendall late in the evening, after a day of calmly weathering 
the Democrats, Starr could not resist turning back his attacks, even 
as he called him ``David'' and smiled. In an instant, as Kendall asked 
about the independent counsel's hiring of private investigators, Starr 
eyed his questioner and shot back: ``We have never hired Terry Lenzner, 
David.'' He referred to an investigator who has looked into the background 
of anti-Clinton witnesses. Suddenly, a long day's lawyerly calm seemed 
at risk for Starr, who similarly could not resist pointing out that 
Kendall, even as he complained that he was afforded only an hour to 
question Starr, never dealt with the charges against the president 
but only attacked Starr's methods. ``The dress, the DNA, the test 
results,'' he said, emphasizing factual specifics in rebutting one 
of Kendall's inquiries about news leaks. Except for that 11th hour, 
Starr did not rise openly to the bait as the Democrats barbed their 
questions with everything from mockery to irony. He responded in phrases 
of high professionalism and supreme regard for the law, arguing that 
his proposed case against the president was rooted not in political 
bias, but rather in ``the sanctity, yes the sanctity, of the judicial 
process.'' Minutes later, this left Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., fairly 
gagging in the hallway during a break. ``Pathetic! Pathetic!'' he 
declared of Starr, asking how such proclaimed standards of sanctity 
squared with Starr's continued private lawyering in the corporate 
sector even as he pursued the president, or his renunciation of the 
flood of news leaks that have buoyed the case against the president 
for the past 10 months. ``He's much more political than I thought 
he was,'' said Meehan as the Democrats warily took their first up-close 
measure of the prosecutor. It is something of a Capitol Hill tradition 
that hearing witnesses often gain the status of victim during a grueling 
hearing. As the Democrats peppered Starr into the night with some 
shouted salvos of ``Do you affirm or deny'' questions, the independent 
counsel, as if mindful of that tradition, was far from complaining. 
Originally, Starr wanted to indicate his special position, according 
to committee staffers, by being allowed to stand and speak before 
the Judiciary Committee at a lectern, as he did before the Supreme 
Court when he was solicitor general. But Republican majority members 
decided it best he make his case seated at a table, like any other 
witness. The Democrats took their opening shots at him frontally, 
denouncing him as the nation's ``sex policeman.'' ``Mr. Starr has 
crossed the line into obsession,'' declared a scowling Rep. John Conyers 
of Michigan, the ranking Democrat, reviewing Starr's four years of 
investigating a half dozen presidential portfolios, from Whitewater 
to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Neither harried nor hurried, Starr 
used every minute of his two-hour opening statement to restate his 
case against Clinton in slow emphatic tones. ``Few have ventured that 
the president told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth,'' he declared, savoring the word ``truth'' and the court oath. 
This became his rhetorical device at various times in accusing the 
president of gravely violating that oath in the sex-and-mendacity 
scandal. Democrats aimed to make their points before the watching 
national audience. But, still, some seem frustrated in seeking a promising 
handhold on Starr. ``He didn't look like a terrible, horrible person,'' 
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., smilingly conceded during a break. ``He 
looked like a lawyer reading a boring, monotonous speech.'' After 
Starr disowned any personal talent or partisan experience in the world 
of politics, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., asked a series of skeptical 
questions. ``Why did you withhold that before the election,'' he asked, 
referring to the exoneration of the president that Starr suddenly 
announced Thursday in several areas of his investigations. Slowly, 
patiently, Starr denied all partisan machinations. When Frank asked 
about leaks from the investigation, Starr, a former judge, gently 
objected: ``That is an unfair question.'' ``If you tell me it's an 
unfair question, why, I'll withdraw it,'' Frank shot back in mock 
reverence at Starr's demeanor of judiciousness. At the end of the 
hearing, Kendall seemed nettled by Starr and the feeling became mutual 
as Starr pointedly noted that Kendall was spending his time talking 
about news leaks more than the behavior of his client, the president. 
``I'd like another crack at him,'' said Kendall even as his time ran 
out and Starr resumed his judicious demeanor.
