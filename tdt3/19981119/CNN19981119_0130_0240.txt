House majority leader Dick Armey survived a stiff challenge to retain 
his post in the new Congress. The Texas republican defeated Steve 
Largent of Oklahoma by a vote of 127-95. And J.C. Watts won the party's 
number four position as chairman of the house republican conference. 
Watts is the only African-American republican in the house. This is 
quite an honor. I look forward to working with every member of the 
leadership. I think the elections that we just came out of, I think 
brought a new energy, actually. I think it helps us all to kind of 
take a serious look within ourselves and see, where do we go from 
here and how do we do it? And I'm excited about the energy. I'm excited 
about the attitudes. I'm excited about everybody working together 
as a team. Congressman Tom delay was re-elected to his post as house 
majority whip. The new Congress convenes January 6th.
