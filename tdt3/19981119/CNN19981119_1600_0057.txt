Earlier, Starr was questioned by the democrats' investigator, abbe 
Lowell. He pressed the independent counsel to explain the initial 
questioning of monica Lewinsky. Your statement to the press, Mr. Starr, 
doesn't include the facts that Ms. lewinsky swore to that she was 
scared and crying a lot of the time. When she asked to see her attorney, 
quote, she would not be able to help herself with her attorney there, 
she was told. That she was threatened with going to jail for, quote, 
27 years. That she was not there for the five hours that your press 
statement says, but was there for over ten hours, and that when she 
asked to call her mother to discuss what you were discussing with 
her, your deputy Jackie bennett said, you're 24, you're smart, you're 
old enough, you don't need to call your mommy. That wasn't in your 
statement to the press that day, was it? No, it wasn't Mr. Lowell, 
and let me explain what press statements are designed to do. This 
-- this was not designed to provide a ver bait emtranscript of kpen 
tear. They are designed to respond to what we were, in fact, being 
accused of. Ken Starr says he stands behind each word of his report 
to the house judiciary committee. Nine television networks broadcast 
Starr's statements live. He emphasized his investigation is not an 
indictment of Mr. Clinton's personal life. I want to emphasize that 
our referral never suggests that the relationship between the president 
and Ms. Lewinsky, in and of itself, could constitute a high crime 
or misdemeanor. Indeed, the referral never passes judgment on the 
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The propriety of a relationship 
is not the concern of our office. The referral is instead about obstruction 
of justice, lying under oath, tampering with witnesses and the misuse 
of power.
