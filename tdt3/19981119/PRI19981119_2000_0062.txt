On Capital Hill members of the House Judiciary Committee today, questioned 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr about his referral concerning potential 
grounds for impeaching President Clinton. Starr evaded Democratic 
attacks and received support from Republican lawmakers. NPR's Peter 
Kenyon has more on this story. For years Republicans have been frustrated 
by the President's ability to dodge and evade the questions and accusations 
of investigators. Today it was the Democrats turn to be frustrated, 
sounding almost Clintonesque at times, Starr parried hostile questions 
about the behavior of his agents. Speaking in generalities, while 
refusing to answer specific questions, such as these from Florida 
Democrat Robert Wexler, Do you admit or deny that your agents threatened 
Ms. Lewinsky with 27 years in prison if she contacted her attorney, 
as she testified. Do you admit or deny that your agents threatened 
to prosecute her mother, if Ms. Lewinsky called her attorney, as she 
testified? That your agents told Monica Lewinsky that she would be 
less likely to receive immunity if she contacted her attorney? Starr 
says a court has reviewed the question of Lewinsky's access to legal 
counsel and found no wrong doing by his office. Peter Kenyon, NPR 
News, the Capitol.
