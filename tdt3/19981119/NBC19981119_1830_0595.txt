Although the impeachment hearing was front and center here in Washington 
today, it was also the first full day of a new face on the house republican 
leadership -- Robert Livingston taking over the speaker's gavel from 
Newt gingrich. And for the first time ever, a black man on the republican 
house leadership team, J.C. Watts of Oklahoma. Watts doesn't want 
to be known just as a black republican, but he acknowledges race is 
a complicated issue in American politics. J.C. Watts says he won his 
leadership post on merit, not because of the color of his skin. But 
already, republicans are citing him as symbol of a party open to all 
races. But the hard facts are that after three election cycles, you're 
still the only black congressman in the republican party of the House 
of Representatives. Tom, I did not run for Congress as a black republican. 
I don't think that by putting a black face out front that it says 
anything in particular. I still have to win people with issues. Watts 
was the first black quarterback at the University of oklahoma, first 
black to hold statewide office, and the first republican to win his 
congressional district since 1922. But when it comes to affirmative 
action, Watts believes strongly there's too much emphasis on race. 
My skin color is a biprokt of me election. A whole lot of people would 
say, let's take those dollars and put that in tutoring programs. On 
black disillusionment with the republican party -- I think there is 
a market out there in the black community that's saying, "Look. We 
are tired of being taken for granted. We're willing to listen to what 
you have to say." It's our responsibility to step in there and build 
those relationships. On his merits speaking for themselves -- I am 
comfortable in taking my merits, taking my ideas, taking my thoughts 
to people of all color and saying, "I want to be your congressman." 
When he was first elected to Congress, he said he would serve only 
three terms. This is his third term. Now that he has this post, he 
says, well it's up to the voters. You want to leave the stage when 
they're aplouding. I'm conscious of that.
