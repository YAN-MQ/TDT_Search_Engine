Russia's government will have to live without a budget in the first 
quarter of 1999, and must not resort to uncontrolled monetary printing 
to cover its gaping deficit, top officials said Thursday. Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov's government still doesn't know when it will submit 
a draft budget to the lower house of Russia's parliament, the State 
Duma, said First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov. Regardless 
of when the budget is submitted, the Duma will need three months to 
review it, said Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov. The government's delays 
are ``trying the nerves of the deputies,'' he said, according to the 
ITAR-Tass news agency. Russia's parliament often drags out the budget 
debate, and didn't pass the 1998 budget until March. Government officials 
have said they can't draft a budget until they know whether foreign 
lenders will release more of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan they put on 
hold last August when the government defaulted on its treasury debt 
and devalued the ruble. They also say drafting a budget will be futile 
until they know whether western lenders will agree to restructure 
dlrs 17 billion in Russia's foreign debt that the government says 
it can't pay. Still, Primakov cautioned that even if the government 
does not get its wishes on its debts and loans, it must not resort 
to printing too much money. ``We can't go for uncontrolled emission, 
since all payments ... would be made valueless,'' he said, according 
to ITAR-Tass. The government has pledged to pay off wage and pension 
arrears quickly, in part by printing more money. It has also warned 
that if it didn't get help from abroad, it would be forced to print 
massive amounts of rubles. Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said 
Wednesday that Russia has printed 8 billion rubles (dlrs 470 million) 
since Oct. 1.
