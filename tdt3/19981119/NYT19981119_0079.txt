Christopher Cuomo has just declared that he is having a ``bad camera 
day.'' This is not something that somebody who has landed a job in 
television ever wants to have. Luckily for Cuomo, the camera he has 
been facing is only taking stills for Fox News to use in advertisements 
promoting the magazine show he is working for. No video this time. 
``I'm no box of chocolates,'' he says, apparently referring to his 
looks. Here he differs from such recognized authorities as People 
magazine, which named him one of the 10 sexiest men of 1997. Earlier, 
People had anointed him one of the world's 50 most beautiful people 
and W magazine had called him New York's most eligible bachelor. It 
is a year later, and women are still mentioning his name in the same 
sentence with words like ``cute'' and ``hunk'' and ``unmarried'' and 
``John F. Kennedy Jr.'' But now the Fox photographer has pulled his 
collar out over his jacket. ``Who does he think I am, John Travolta?'' 
Cuomo asks. It is always some kind of who-is-he question. The family-tree 
answer (son of Mario, brother of Andrew, brother-in-law of a Kennedy) 
is one that he does not come close to giving. And he sounds uncomfortable 
with being a celebrity. That raises the how-could-you-not question, 
as in how could you not be somebody important? Cuomo, 28, has struggled 
with expectations all his life. ``I get lumped into `pretty boy,''' 
he says during a lunchtime conversation. ``A, I don't think the esthetics 
bear it out, and B, there is a roughness to me that doesn't make me 
that lovable.'' Lovable, in his lexicon, seems to apply to his Rottweiler, 
Cosmo. ``He's so larger than life we refer to him in the third person, 
the Cos,'' he says. `` `Does the Cos want to sit?' And Cos either 
sits or bites your leg off. The only dog I ever met that you don't 
command, you speak in dialogue.'' But back to the who-is-he question. 
``I am what I do. I am not an interesting person. I don't have interests 
or hobbies. I talk about what I do. I bother people in subways. It's 
what makes me happy. Get people to hit on that 2030 Web site or watch 
`Fox Files.' As soon as it's about me, that's not what makes me happy.'' 
The 2030 web site (www.2030.org) is run by a nonprofit ``action tank'' 
on whose board he sits. Its goal, he says, is to try to interest people 
between 20 and 30 in public affairs and, specifically, the idea that 
Social Security might run out before they are between, say, 60 and 
70. ``Fox Files'' is the magazine show whose photographer has rearranged 
his shirt collar. After running for several weeks in the summer, it 
is scheduled to reappear next month, on Thursdays at 9 p.m. Because 
of who he is, Cuomo, reporter, has to take questions. So why did his 
father not run for president in 1992? ``I will tell you, `Ask him,''' 
he says. ``No one speaks for my father.'' But no one speaks for the 
son, either, and the next statement is from somewhere off the political 
radar screen. ``I think he should run now,'' he says. ``I think it's 
his best shot if he wanted to run. He doesn't want to run. Andrew's 
the new lion in the pride.'' He talks about why the old lion should 
venture out of the den, then does the smoothest of gear changes and 
becomes an Andrew loyalist. His brother has been fueling speculation 
that he will run for the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan. ``My take on my brother is he is without exception the most 
promising politically inclined person in the country,'' he says, ``and 
people don't even know him. He's like an elixir. He's what you need 
in here. He took that HUD job. Who wants that?'' He certainly does 
not. ``I do not see myself in elected office,'' he says. ``I see myself 
at my brother's side when he fights the fight.'' He is not saying 
what his brother will do. ``He's only 40 years old, he doesn't have 
to jump at anything. He's got to answer the questions, is that what 
he wants for his life? For his family?'' Back to Chris Cuomo, the 
Cuomo who calls himself a ``populist'' and has problems with the Democratic 
Party. ``This party isn't my party,'' he says. ``They're not for me. 
The Democratic Party has fallen prey to professional politicians. 
Nobody has held any jobs except lawyer or banker in the world they 
come out of.'' The world he came out of was different, he says, and 
it changed the year he turned 13 and his father was inaugurated as 
governor. ``It was an unnatural transition,'' he says. ``I went from 
being a normal kid in a middle-class neighborhood in Queens to being 
the governor's son. From `Eight Is Enough' married with `All in the 
Family,' to `Benson,''' a program about a governor and the people 
around him. He was sent to Albany Academy, then an all-boys military 
school. ``In retrospect, it would have been better if I had gone to 
the bigger public high school. I was more used to kids like that.'' 
Then he was off to Yale University and Fordham Law School. Now, after 
a couple of years at a big-name Manhattan law firm and a couple of 
years with a smaller investment-management group, he hungers for something 
grittier than Barbara Walters-style interviews. Yes, on that most 
unreal of mediums, television, he wants to be real. And yes, he has 
a reason that only a Cuomo could give. ``If I get tagged as a phony, 
I disgrace my entire family,'' he says, ``and I'm not ready to do 
that.''
