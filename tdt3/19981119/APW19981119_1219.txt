BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO is ``deeply concerned'' about the upsurge 
in violence in Kosovo this month and condemned the increase tension 
which has been brought about by both sides in the conflict, alliance 
officials said Thursday. ``These incidents risk creating a dangerous 
cycle of provocation,'' NATO said in a statement after the weekly 
meeting of the 16 Alliance ambassador. ``It could destabilize the 
ceasefire.'' NATO had already made similar statements last week. ``Since 
the beginning of November there has been a sharp increase in tension 
resulting from incidents created, in some cases by Serbian security 
forces and in other cases by armed Kosovar elements,'' the statement 
from the ambassadors said. ``NATO is deeply concerned about the deteriorating 
situation,'' the Alliance said. Since the Oct. 12 deal U.S. negotiator 
Richard Holbrooke struck with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, 
there have been an increasing number of attacks in which Serb police 
or fighters from the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army have been killed. 
``NATO is monitoring the situation closely,'' the statement said. 
On Thursday, Serbia's prime minister Mirko Marjanovic accused Kosovo's 
ethnic Albanians of blocking peace efforts, a day after they failed 
_ for the 17th time _ to attend Serb-proposed talks.
