The FCC has adopted a rule requiring broadcasters to pay a fee if 
they use their new digital spectrum for pay services. The rule approved 
this morning, could go into effect next month. NPR's Jim Zurolli has 
more on that story. Last year the government decided to award the 
nation's TV station owners a swath of free broadcast spectrum. The 
extra spectrum was intended to allow broadcasters to begin offering 
digital programming, while continuing to provide analogue services 
to consumers still using their old TV sets. At the time, some critics 
complained that the government had attached too few restrictions to 
the give away. And they noted that broadcasters could use the new 
spectrum to offer lucrative PAY-TV and Internet services. The rule 
adopted by the commission would require broadcasters to pay the government 
5% of their gross revenues for any pay services they provide. But 
the rule does not apply to revenues generated by over the air programming 
such as home shopping and infomercials. Jim Zurolli, NPR News, New
