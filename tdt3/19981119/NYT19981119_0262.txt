Before movies and television, Americans knew how to entertain themselves. 
One way was through folk art, an engrossing pastime for the maker 
and a continuing delight for the viewer. Folk art can also be appreciated 
as fine art, particularly at the Fall Antiques Show, running Friday 
through Sunday at the Armory on Park Avenue at 67th Street. In connection 
with the fair, the Museum of American Folk Art has organized a loan 
exhibition of folk art treasures privately purchased at the show over 
the past 20 years. Several veteran folk art dealers, including Kelter-Malce, 
Peter Tillou, Steven Score, America Hurrah and Ricco/Maresca, will 
be at the fair. There's also some new blood, with new participants 
presenting different kinds of folk art. One new dealer is Clifford 
A. Wallach of New York City, who is bringing examples of ``tramp art,'' 
household objects covered with thousands of bits of carved wood that 
have been lovingly glued on. His wares have great charm, and range 
from heart-shaped picture frames given as tokens of affection to everyday, 
utilitarian items like sewing boxes that have been festooned with 
pyramids and virtuoso squares of wood. ``Tramp art was not an American 
invention,'' said Wallach, who has specialized in it for 12 years 
and is the author of ``Tramp Art: One Notch at a Time'' (Wallach-Irons, 
1998). ``Originally called chip carving, it was pervasive around the 
world.'' He speculated that tramp art originated in Europe and came 
to the United States with German and Scandinavian immigrants in the 
1800s. It took off in this country in the 1860s, when cigar smoking 
became fashionable. Cigar boxes were made of fine woods like mahogany 
and cedar, and whittlers loved them. ``The boxes were easy to carve 
because they were made of good wood,'' Wallach said, adding, ``All 
the carver needed was a knife _ and some imagination.'' Most of the 
artists were anonymous, Wallach said, ``working-class, frugal, often 
inveterate whittlers, tinkerers, inventors, sometimes artisans by 
profession, and discontent to be idle.'' He recalled one man's reminiscence 
about his grandfather, who he said would sit before the fire, carving 
with his pocketknife as he talked to the women of the house while 
they did their sewing. ``They often called tramp art `men's quilting,''' 
Wallach said. ``It was time-consuming and labor-intensive.'' Some 
pieces commemorate an event, like a wedding, in their maker's life. 
Others deal with history; Wallach has a row of framed portraits of 
presidents. Items like these cost a few hundred dollars each, while 
his ``masterpiece,'' a blue wall cabinet whose sides are totally covered 
with stacked-wood pyramids, costs $38,000. Made about 1880, it has 
intricate sunflowers on its doors and a crest decorated with wooden 
semicircles that look like early Frank Stella paintings. Once seen 
as plebeian, tramp art is beginning to be taken seriously. The Abby 
Aldrich Rockefeller Center for Folk Art in Williamsburg, Va., is planning 
a tramp art exhibition in 2000. Richard Miller, a former curator at 
the center, writes in the introduction to Wallach's book, ``Seemingly 
common, everyday objects are revealing themselves to be neither particularly 
common nor everyday.'' Darwin's Antiques of Pine Street in Philadelphia 
is another new exhibitor at the fair. William Woody, Darwin's owner, 
said he sells intensely personal folk art. ``I like Darwinian things,'' 
Woody said, like ``natural history specimens and relics of the Grand 
Tour.'' He recently sold an enormous ship anchor to the Port of History 
Museum in Philadelphia. The anchor was made as a gift for a ship captain 
who retired in 1862. ``It was chipped-carved wood to imitate wrought 
iron,'' Woody explained. ``All the places the captain had sailed were 
marked on the anchor, from Cape Horn to the Cape of Good Hope.'' Woody, 
who served in the Navy, said it reminded him of ``when ships were 
wood and men were iron.'' Woody once studied architecture and is attracted 
to large architectural elements. At the fair, he is selling a fine 
1830 wooden mantelpiece from Boston that was decorated with smoke. 
``They held the candle next to freshly painted wood, so the smoke 
would curl up and make it look like marble,'' he explained. ``In those 
days, people wanted to be entertained by their surroundings.'' A Dauphine's 
Commode On Tuesday, Christie's New York will auction the fine French 
and English furniture collection of Martin Zimet, the chairman of 
French &AMP; Co., an art and antiques gallery in Manhattan that he 
bought in 1968. The pieces, many with royal provenances, go on view 
Friday. Zimet said he was selling the collection because his son Henry, 
now president of the firm, wanted to stick to old master paintings. 
Several of the pieces are grand and ornate, impressive both visually 
and historically. Probably the most beautiful is the Louis XV black 
lacquer commode made and signed by BVRB, Bernard II Van Risenburgh, 
one of the most important cabinetmakers of the Rococo era. The piece 
dates from circa 1744. Christie's experts were apparently the first 
to look at the back and discover its royal inventory number. Alistair 
Clarke, the head of Christie's department of European furniture, said 
the commode was made for the Versailles bedroom of the dauphine, the 
Infanta Maria-Teresa-Rafaella, who was the daughter of Philip V of 
Spain and married Louis XV's eldest son in 1745. The commode, feminine 
in appearance, is covered with prized 17th-century Japanese lacquer 
panels inlaid with mother-of-pearl, gold and silver leaf. ``Such panels 
were amazingly rare in the 18th century,'' Clarke said. ``Others went 
to Louis XV or Madame de Pompadour.'' The panels depict a group of 
court ladies gathered in a manicured landscape, surrounded by exquisite 
little pavilions and exotic birds and butterflies. The scenes are 
framed with delicate gilded ormolu mounts. You can practically see 
the chisel marks on the sculpted shells, flowers and trailing foliage. 
The workmanship is exquisite. Tony Victoria, the Manhattan dealer 
who specializes in French antiques, said, ``You can't do much better 
than that commode.'' Zimet bought the royal commode around 1980 from 
the Paris dealer Jacques Perrin. It is a tour de force with an estimate 
to match: $4 to $6 million. Zimet is also selling two pairs of George 
III amaranth, tulipwood and ebonized marquetry armchairs. Designed 
by John Linnell, the English cabinetmaker, each of the first pair 
of chairs has an oval back with a pierced splat in the form of a neoclassical 
urn filled with blooming lilies and daisies. In design they are reminiscent 
of the work of Robert Adam, 66 of whose designs from the Sir John 
Soane Museum in London are on view at the Octagon House museum in 
Washington through Jan. 3. (Estimate: $250,000 to $400,000.) ``The 
common thread in this auction is that each lot is very strong on its 
own,'' Zimet said. ``There are no wishy-washy pieces.''
