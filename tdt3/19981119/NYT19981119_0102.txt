Subway trains are running erratically, stations are dirty, buses are 
packed _ and Gene Russianoff has been very busy. The city's most quoted 
``passengers' advocate'' has blitzed the subways with advertisements, 
lined up support from politicians and planned a little street theater 
for Monday's board meeting of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
A demonstrator in a turkey costume will urge the MTA not to gobble 
up the budget surplus. This makes for good photo opportunities, and 
it will probably result in benefits for some passengers. Russianoff's 
group, the Straphangers Campaign, has done wonders pressuring the 
MTA for lower fares and better service. But how much has he _ or anyone 
else _ done to advocate the long-term interests of passengers? Whatever 
the turkey costume accomplishes, New York's riders will still be trapped 
in a dysfunctional system, because fare box revenues cover only about 
half the costs. The conventional wisdom, espoused by the Straphangers 
as well as the MTA, transit unions and politicians, is that this shortfall 
should be made up with money from taxpayers, which is why Russianoff 
has become so adept at pressuring politicians for subsidies. But there's 
another way to advocate for passengers, as was demonstrated in London 
over the last decade. Instead of begging for money to cover its losses, 
London Transport tried a system that existed in New York early this 
century, when private companies profitably operated buses and subways. 
In the 1980s, London officials began contracting out bus routes and 
eventually privatized all the buses. ``The competition among private 
operators brought our costs tumbling down,'' said David Bayliss, the 
director of planning for London Transport. Thanks to reduced costs, 
improved service and increased ridership, the London bus system showed 
a slight profit last year _ a far cry from New York's bus system, 
which loses $2 per ride. London officials are now studying ways to 
privatize some subway operations. Similar experiments are under way 
in cities around the world, but not in New York. The only serious 
challenge to the MTA's monopoly has come from jitneys offering $1 
van rides in Queens and Brooklyn. But the City Council, under pressure 
from the transit unions, refuses to issue them licenses, and Russianoff 
has done nothing to advocate for their passengers. In fact, one reason 
Russianoff fought for fare discounts (like free transfers from buses 
to subways) was to take business back from the van drivers. ``We don't 
want vans siphoning off riders from the buses,'' he said, ``because 
we think it will hurt bus service in the long run. There may be a 
role for the vans in some neighborhoods with poor bus service, but 
we don't want to take money out of the public system.'' This position 
happens to jibe with the interests of the transit unions, as do many 
stances taken by the Straphangers Campaign. The group joined a coalition 
of transit unions to sponsor the ad campaign in the subways this fall, 
showing pictures of sardines and snails with the slogans ``End the 
crush'' and ``End the crawl.'' The ads urged passengers to call politicians 
to demand more money for more service _ and therefore more union jobs. 
``I plead guilty that we have an ongoing relationship with the transit 
unions,'' Russianoff said. ``We fight them on some issues, but we've 
worked well with them, too. The unions have political power, and you 
need that to get things done. We had to build a consensus to get money 
for a system that was near death's door.'' But over the long run, 
confronting the unions could yield even more, said Wendell Cox, a 
consultant who has analyzed transit systems in America and overseas. 
``Advocacy groups are making a mistake to keep throwing money at transit 
monopolies,'' Cox said. ``It goes mainly to expand management bureaucracies 
and improve union contracts. New York's fundamental transit problem 
is spending, not funding. If it started contracting out bus service 
and some subway operations, the system could easily pay for itself 
within 10 to 15 years.'' Perhaps, as Russianoff maintains, it would 
be fruitless for the Straphangers to advocate radical measures. ``We 
have to be pragmatic,' he said. ``This has long been a labor town, 
and privatization isn't even in the public policy debate yet.'' That's 
true, and it will remain true if we wait for union leaders or MTA 
managers to suggest giving up their monopoly. But shouldn't the passengers' 
advocate at least be raising the issue?
