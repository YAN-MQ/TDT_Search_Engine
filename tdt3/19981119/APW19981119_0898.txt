The Canadian city of Edmonton beat Stanford on Thursday for the right 
to stage the 2001 World Championships, taking track and field's showcase 
event to North America for the first time. The International Amateur 
Athletic Federation said Edmonton, capital of the province of Alberta, 
received ``massive consensus'' in the secret ballot by the IAAF Council. 
Paris and New Delhi were the other bidders. The exact voting breakdown 
was not released, but an IAAF source said Edmonton beat Stanford 22-2. 
Two Council members were absent and a third apparently abstained. 
It had been widely expected that the event would go to North America 
after events in Helsinki (1993), Rome (1997), Tokyo (1991), Stuttgart 
(1993), Goteborg (1995), Athens (1997) and Seville (1999). It was 
Stanford's third bid after previous attempts for the 1997 and 1999 
championships. The championships, will be held at Commonwealth Stadium, 
home of the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos. Edmonton staged the 1978 Commonwealth 
Games, 1983 University Games and 1996 World Figure Skating Championships. 
``This is indeed an honor for our province and for the nation,'' Alberta 
Premier Ralph Klein said. ``Edmonton has a proud tradition of organizing 
sports events and we are delighted to have a commitment to host what 
we feel will be the greatest ever world championships.'' IAAF president 
Primo Nebiolo said the council voted by a ``great majority'' for Edmonton. 
``We were also impressed by the guarantees made, the exposures promised 
and the overall presentaion which was really splendid,'' he said. 
The vote came after presentations to the council by delegations from 
Edmonton, Stanford an Paris. New Delhi was a no-show. ``We presented 
third,'' Athletics Canada chairman Rolf Lund said. ``We left the room 
thinking we would probably have a half an hour wait. Within about 
four or five minutes, they called us back in to announce that Edmonton 
had won the bid. Apparently it was almost a unanimous decision. ``From 
a track and field perspective for Canada, it's a tremendous boost 
to our sport.'' The IAAF said the co-chairman of the Edmonton bid, 
Jack M. Agrios, promised that accomodation and transport to the city 
would be provided for athletes and officials. Canadian television, 
which didn't broadcast the 1997 worlds in Athens, committed to a three-year, 
dlrs 6-million contract with the IAAF to cover the sport from 1999-2001. 
The result was another blow to track and field in the United States. 
While America produces some of the world's greatest track and field 
stars, the sport _ apart from during the Olympics _ continues to founder 
from lack of public interest, sponsors, funds and television coverage.
