There's been an early outbreak of "star wars" fever. 75 theaters in 
north America showed a sneak preview of the trailer for the new "star 
wars" movie on Tuesday. And it looks like loyal fans at one Los Angeles 
theater bought a full-price movie ticket just to see the 130-second 
trailer for "star wars: the phantom menace." "Variety" reports nearly 
two-thirds of the audience didn't stick around to watch the feature 
presentation after the trailer was shown. The "star wars" prequel 
opens May 21st.
