The man charged with bombing two U.S. embassies in Africa is now being 
linked to a plot against U.S. troops. Gary Tuchman reports. a high-ranking 
U.S. intelligence official says international terrorism suspect osama 
bin laden planned to use chemical weapons against members of the American 
military. Bin laden attacked Americans before, and he said he planned 
to do so again. We know that bin laden's organization has attempted 
to develop poisonous gases that could be fired at U.S. troops in the 
gulf states. Speaking at a conference on biological and chemical weapons 
at the Hoover institution in California, John gannon, a top aide of 
CIA director George Tenet, said bin laden's efforts to use chemical 
weapons against U.S. troops could be linked to the pharmaceutical 
plant in Sudan which was bombed by the U.S. last August. The discovery 
of the VX precursor empta at a factory in Sudan that had known ties 
to bin laden indicates how close he may have been to achieving this 
goal. This is not the first time bin laden and chemical weapons have 
been linked. He was indicted earlier this month in connection with 
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August, 
the events that led to the U.S. retaliation. The indictment says osama 
bin laden, the defendant, made efforts to obtain the components of 
chemical weapons. But gannon's charges that the weapons would have 
been used on American troops are the first time they've been made 
openly by U.S. intelligence officials. One Middle East scholar says 
while there is no defending bin laden, there is still much more that 
needs to be disclosed. Proving or even asserting that people are attempting 
to acquire weapons is very different from describing in a plausible 
way how these weapons could or would be used. John gannon's message 
at the Hoover institution was spoken with confidence and vigor. But 
among the questions left unanswered was whether the CIA believes bin 
laden has ever had the capability to deliver such a chemical strike.
