The McCaughey Septuplets turn 1 on Thursday. They have several high-profile 
events to Mark the milestone, including appearances this week on "Oprah" 
and "dateline NBC." They also have a book coming out this week called 
"seven from heaven: the miracle of the McCaughey Septuplets." It chronicles 
the lives of Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey from the time they discovered 
she was pregnant until after she gave birth.
