After years of scouring and digging across northern France, war buff 
Philippe Gorczynski has finally found his prize: a rusty but intact 
British tank from the Great War, with a few surprises inside. On Thursday, 
a dozen archeological workers used picks, shovels and an earth mover 
to gently remove tons of muddy red earth covering the Mark IV tank 
in this farm town near the Belgian border, a former World War I battlefield. 
Gorczynski, covered with mud from head to toe as he helped the crew, 
said finding the tank under 2.5 meters (8 feet) of soil in a vegetable 
patch was like searching out the proverbial needle in a haystack. 
After years of talking to residents, poring over battle maps and aerial 
photos, Gorczynski dug in about 20 places before finally sinking his 
spade in the right spot on Nov. 5. ``I was almost in shock. It was 
the culmination of all my research,'' the 38-year-old hotel owner 
from nearby Cambrai.``I think of all the names of the soldiers I knew.'' 
But what he found inside was even more surprising: both British and 
German silverware, lamps and helmets, as well as unexploded grenades. 
British troops abandoned the tank on Nov. 20, 1917, and German soldiers 
then buried it and used it as a bunker in this town of brick houses 
and cow pastures. The blue-helmeted team of archaeologists was expected 
to officially raise the tank on Nov. 20, next week, to mark the day 
the tank changed hands. By Thursday afternoon, the top was exposed, 
encrusted in mud. With help from the earth mover, they were to dig 
a hold 5 meters (15 feet) deep around the tank in order to raise it 
with a crane. ``We're going to repair it, remove the rust and clean 
it, then turn it into a monument,'' said Alain Jacques, a leader of 
the team.
