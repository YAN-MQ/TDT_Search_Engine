U.S. House Judiciary Committee is set to open impeachment hearings 
later today on the White House sex and cover-up scandals surrounding 
President Clinton. The occasion marks only the third time in U.S. 
history that a president has a faced formal proceedings that could 
lead to his removal from office. Presidential historian Alan Lichtman 
says that does not give the hearing historic status, but he adds that 
the Judiciary Committee doesn't have the solid case for impeachment 
that was considered by the panel of 1974 when President Richard Nixon 
was under investigation. The last tie this happened during Watergate, 
the House Judiciary Committee had the benefit of many months of hearings 
by a special Senate committee. They had thoroughly investigated the 
evidence in closed session for many weeks and they really had a very 
powerful case against the president who had acted in his official 
capacity to undermine American democracy. This time, the American 
people have said loud and clear they don't want their president impeached. 
The republicans fell far short of expectations in the recent elections 
and now we see the pale ghost of what, just a couple of months ago, 
looked like a robust impeachment process. Presidential historian Alan 
Lichtman says he doesn't expect any political careers will be made 
or broken in the proceedings getting underway today. Coming up on 
10 hours, 17, universal time.
