They may be called "Turkey fares." But holiday rates offered for travel 
and lodging this season are anything but turkeys. Stephanie Oswald 
reports. 'tis the season for travel deals that take you away -- or 
closer to home -- for the holidays. Most airlines offer "Turkey" fares. 
Fly out on the Monday before Thanksgiving, or even on Thanksgiving 
day, and return Friday or Saturday. Avoiding the peak travel days 
of the Wednesday before and the Sunday after thanksgiving can mean 
real savings. For example, some airlines offer one-way fares as low 
as $19, or round-trip fares around $100. Many airline web sites have 
specials you can't get anywhere else. And American airlines is now 
offering a new special every day leading up to the holidays. It's 
also off-season in Europe. Crowds are gone and hotels are affordable. 
Round-trip fares between major U.S. and European cities are typically 
less than $500 per person. We've seen airfares for as low as $179 
each way from the east coast to major European cities for travel between 
November 1st and March 31st, and many hotel deals to match. Now's 
the time for hotel holiday packages. Major chains offer weekend deals 
teamed with holiday shopping or event promotions. Look for rates of 
$89 or less per room. Many packages include free breakfast, transportation 
to nearby stores and discounts on shopping. Stephanie Oswald, CNN, 
reporting.
