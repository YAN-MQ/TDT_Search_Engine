...Japan at the start of a six-day trip to Asia meets with the emperor 
and answers questions from the Japanese people. Here in Washington, 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr testifies before Congress today 
in the Clinton impeachment inquiry. In Israel, expectations are high 
that the cabinet could approve a West Bank troop withdrawal ordering 
redeployment as early as today. The latest crisis in Iraq seems diffused 
for the present, but experts say the fundamental reasons for conflict 
are still in place. I'm Les Carpenter. I'm Charlene Porter. We'll 
have details on these and other stories, plus sports, business news 
and some long-lost opera duets by Mozart are brought to an American 
stage for the first time. All this ahead in this hour of News Now. 
First, the news.
