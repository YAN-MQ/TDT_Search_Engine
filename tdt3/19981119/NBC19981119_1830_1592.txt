Now to a race that might wind oup being one of the longest marathons 
in olympic history. It's the story of a runner who is trying to write 
what he considers to be a Big injustice. And to walk away with some 
glory. Here's Mike Boettcher. Marathoner Don kardong expects to win 
an Olympic medal. I feel pretty good today. But the race was run 22 
years ago at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. It was a great moment, walking 
to the line. What an unbelievable surprise. Kardong finished an agonizing 
fourth, missing the bronze by three seconds. The winner, east German 
waldemar cierpinski. The first time I remember feeling any regret 
was when I watched the medal ceremony. I saw the three flags go up. 
And I said, look at how close I was. Instead of a medal, kardong, 
now a writer in Spokane, Washington, received a fourth place certificate. 
I just sort of stapled it up there. Fourth is a monumental achievement, 
end of story. At least until recently, when researchers began sifting 
through old communist files in east Germany, including their Olympic 
teams. And in one file, a revelation about cierpinski, the east German 
gold medalist. I started hearing that he showed up on the list of 
runners who were part of the east German doping program. Athletes 
with enhanced and illegal abilities because of steroids. So kardong 
now wants Olympic officials to consider stripping cierpinski of the 
gold. In that case, kardong would move up a notch and get his bronze. 
If they have good, solid evidence that this was going on and they 
don't do anything, what does that tell people about the Olympics? 
We found the camera-shy cierpinski in his hometown, Halle, germany. 
He said, "no comment." Dr. werner franke is the researcher who uncovered 
the east German Olympic doping scandal. The whole team was on steroid 
drugs If the entire east German team was using steroids, 1976 was 
a Great Olympics for them. Then should every east German winner be 
stripped of his or her medal? I would love kids coming up through 
this sport, my sport or any sport, to know that if you cheat, you're 
not going to get away with it. His daughter, also a marathoner, has 
her own Olympic dreams. And in this longest of marathons, Don kardong 
is still running hard, he says, as much for her as for himself. Mike 
Boettcher, NBC news, Spokane.
