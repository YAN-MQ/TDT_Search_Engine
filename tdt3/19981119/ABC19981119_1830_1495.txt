One of America's foremost film directors was killed today in a road 
accident.rl on New York's long island . Alan pakula was 70. He was 
known by his contemporaries as one of Hollywood's great storytellers. 
In "all the president's men" in 1976 -- I know exactly what I mean. 
The reporters Woodward and bernstein of "The Washington Post" ultimately 
bring down President Nixon, clearly said one critic, it's the best 
film about newspaper reporting ever made. Pakula was an actor's director 
in that he knew how to get the best out of them. Sometimes I get spooked. 
I think I see people, hear thing things. Jane Fonda in "klute" for 
one. Meryl Streep for another. When he was not making films, ev when 
he was making films, he was dedicated to his family, his friends and 
his country.
