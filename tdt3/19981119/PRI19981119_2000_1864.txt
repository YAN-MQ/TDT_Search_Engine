Meanwhile Mr. Clinton is continuing his trip to Japan trying to concentrate 
on other business. Tom Carver is traveling with the President. This 
has been a curious day for the American President. He came here hoping 
to escape the feverish atmosphere during the impeachment hearings 
only to find himself answering questions about his private life from 
ordinary Japanese. It occurred during the televised town hall style 
meeting. Bill Clinton spent some time trying to persuade the audience 
of the need for drastic economic reform. America may see Japan as 
the key to resolving the Asian economic crisis, but officials here 
are cautioning not to expect major breakthroughs on this trip. Tom 
Carver, BBC News, Tokyo.
