Parliament cleared the way Friday for 250 German soldiers to take 
part in a NATO standby force being set up to protect unarmed observers 
in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province. Lawmakers from Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder's center-left coalition joined the opposition in 
passing the measure by 555 votes to 36, with seven abstentions. Only 
the former East German communists voted against the plan. Schroeder's 
Cabinet approved the plans Wednesday. NATO's aim is to monitor the 
withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo and the safety of some 2,000 
unarmed international observers following an October peace deal between 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic Albanian rebels. 
The French-led 1,700-strong ``extraction force,'' intended to rescue 
the observers if they run into trouble, is to be based in neighboring 
Macedonia. Last week, parliament approved sending 350 German soldiers 
and 16 unmanned spy planes to take part in NATO air surveillance over 
Kosovo.
