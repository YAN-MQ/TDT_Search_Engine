The first time I saw ``Burning Habits'' _ with its gay vampires, catatonic 
bartenders and nuns who swear like sailors _ was at a bar off Avenue 
A. Every Monday night for eight weeks a new episode was presented 
as the audience, which had paid $5 a head, drank beer or vodka tonics 
and strained to see the actors, who performed without benefit of a 
stage. It was always a good idea to arrive early so you could sit 
in one of the first three rows. And there unfolded the multiple story 
lines of Kidd Gottahave (``an angry young lesbian teen who has yet 
to experience love''); Priapus Columns, the bisexual (maybe); Vonda 
Von Vickers, a lapsed Roman Catholic vampire (described in the program 
as ``evil Catholic witch'') and a host of others. Now at last the 
cast of ``Burning Habits'' has a real stage, although a small one, 
at Here, in SoHo, and the production holds up well. It may take a 
certain attitude to love ``Burning Habits'': a childlike glee in seeing 
authority figures ridiculed, a thorough distaste for sexual hypocrisy 
and a strong aversion to organized religion. But if you have those, 
you will get a major kick out of ``Burning Habits.'' The premise is 
that long ago three lesbian nuns were burned to death in a convent 
that now houses a gay bar. As they died, they cursed whoever entered 
the building in the future to suffer as they had suffered. And God 
knows, everybody does. The plot, while deliberately convoluted and 
many-tentacled, is just an excuse for the gags. Blair Fell, who wrote 
and directed the play with great style, alternates with David Gerard 
in the role of Crow Gottahave, the hunky bartender who hasn't had 
sex in 10 years. Oddly, Fell doesn't seem quite comfortable with his 
own material (but his arms look great). Christa Kirby is still a knockout 
in her double role as Sister Godelieve Macievelli, the kind of nun 
who makes drill sergeants look soft-hearted, and Thelma D'Gretts, 
a confused, mistreated housewife whose husband, Otis D'Gretts, has 
put her in the basement and built a brick wall to keep her there. 
Eileen O'Connor remains fabulous as Vicki Von Vickers, a sweet, suicidal 
debutante with low self-esteem, and Milly the Screamer, a barfly who 
likes to shout her life story to people but always seems to be telling 
the stories of various television characters instead (``I was a witch 
once. Never marry a man in advertising''). Jason Little, who is new 
to the cast, makes Tommy Alan Poe, a young man who lives for musical 
comedy, a joy to behold. His Jules Putan, an existentialist, is not 
quite as wonderful, but you have to sympathize with a character who 
is leaving New York because here ``I have not been able to concentrate 
on my meaninglessness.'' The rest of the cast is pretty great, too. 
Laura Desmond's characters _ Odetta D'Gretts (selfish teen-ager) and 
Rachel-Rachel (servant) _ seem to be the same person with different 
hairdos, but Ms. Desmond has such a lovably goofy comic presence that 
it doesn't matter. ``Burning Habits,'' which is in eight episodes, 
continues through March 13, on Friday and Saturday nights only. Every 
two weeks a new episode in the series of eight begins. There will 
be kidnappings, institutionalizations, hunchbacks, back-stabbing and 
special appearances by the three dead lesbian nuns. PRODUCTION NOTES:
