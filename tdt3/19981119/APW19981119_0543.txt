Norwegians are engaged in nationwide campaigns to help their desperate 
neighbors on the impoverished Kola Peninsula of northwestern Russia's 
Arctic by providing food, warm clothing and medicines. More than a 
million people live on the peninsula, which in the only place where 
Russia borders a NATO member. The economic crisis crippling Russia 
has left thousands of Kola residents facing the bitter cold of Arctic 
winter without heat or basic necessities such as warm clothing. On 
Thursday, the Norwegian Red Cross began a fund-raising drive called 
``Neighbors in Need'' in which 2,000 volunteers will seek donations 
for the Kola region. ``We hope the Norwegian people will reach out 
a helping hand to their Russian neighbors,'' said Sven Molleklein, 
secretary-general of the Norwegian Red Cross. ``The situation is extremely 
critical and we have to act now.'' He said more than 11,000 children 
and 33,000 elderly people in the region lack essential medicines and 
that food supplies are running dangerously low. The Red Cross aims 
to provide shoes and clothing to 600,000 people on the Kola, as well 
as nearly 500,000 boxes of food to 158,000 needy families over the 
next six months. Much of it will be distributed in Murmansk, the capital 
city of the region. Another group, Norwegian People's Aid, last month 
began a drive urging Norwegians to pay 100 kroner (dlrs 13) at more 
than 1,300 stores for a ``Russia Package'' of food and other necessities. 
The Kola Peninsula is the base of the once-powerful Russian North 
fleet. During the Soviet era, the population swelled from a few thousand 
to more than one million when thousands of miners, soldiers and others 
were sent to the region.
