Any impeachment hearing is, in the final analysis, a political process. 
Yes, there are legal definitions and grounds for impeachment, but 
it is carried out in a political Arena, the Congress. And that political 
dimension was evident from the opening gavel today. Here's NBC's Gwen 
Ifill. Just upstairs from the impeachment hearings today -- political 
reality. Illinois congressman John Porter, one of at least a dozen 
house republicans who say that even if the committee recommends impeachment, 
he probably won't. I think the country has been put through a long 
process already. The purpose of impeachment is not to punish an errant 
president. It is to protect the people. Also watching the Capitol 
Hill hearings in his office today, republican Peter king, of New York. 
He agrees. If the vote were today or tomorrow, based on the evidence 
I've seen so far, i would have to vote against any article of impeachment. 
Several other republicans also say they will vote against, or are 
leaning against recommending impeachment, including lawmakers from 
maryland, Delaware, New York, Louisiana, Connecticut and Indiana. 
It will take only six republicans voting against impeachment for the 
issue to die on the house floor by January. The republican turnaround 
began on election day, when democrats picked up seats and voters signaled 
their disgust with scandal. Public opinion clearly says, "drop the 
matter. Get it behind us." The constitution says, "you've gotta do 
your duty." The danger is that they're seen as not getting the message 
from the election. But Judiciary committee republicans say it would 
be premature to rule out impeachment before the hearings are complete. 
But the political mood has changed. Now even the president's enemies 
want middle ground, not impeachment. Gwen Ifill, NBC news, the capitol.
