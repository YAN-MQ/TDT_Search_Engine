10 hours, 38 now, universal time. In the Middle East, the Chief U.N. 
Arms Inspector Richard Butler says he has asked Iraq to tell the truth 
about its biological weapons. Mr. Butler said he sent a letter to 
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz saying, in his words, start 
again, break the habit of a lifetime and tell the truth about biological 
weapons. U.N. arms inspectors returned to the field in Iraq Wednesday 
after a two-week absence.
