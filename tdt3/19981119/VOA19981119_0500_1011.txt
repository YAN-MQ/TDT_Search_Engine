Argentine historians say post-World War II President Juan Perone encouraged 
Nazi war criminals to seek asylum in Argentina. Research Agnasio Clynch 
told a symposium Wednesday he's discovered documents, showing that 
General Perone discussed Nazi immigration. Mr. Clynch says Nazi's 
fleeing from Europe after their defeat were able to set up a society 
designed to help fellow Nazi escapees settle in Argentina.
