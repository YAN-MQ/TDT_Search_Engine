Majority republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have chosen 
a new leadership team, following thier parties' disappointing showing 
in elections earlier this month. As expected, Louisiana Representative 
Bob Livingston was chosen to replace the controversial Newt Gingrich 
as House Speaker. Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas survived strong 
challenges to hold on to his spot as the second ranking republican 
in the House. J.C. Watts, of Oklahoma, an African American, is the 
new republican conference chairman.
