The hearing at which Ken Starr is now speaking does have historical 
precedent. Bruce Morton compares this century's two impeachment hearings. 
The committee COmE to order. 1998. The republican-controlled house 
Judiciary committee considers the impeachment of President William 
Clinton. The committee will come to order. 1974. The democratic-controlled 
house Judiciary committee considers the impeachment of President Richard 
Nixon. Are they alike? Different? Thus, as of this minute, the committee 
has not resolved what an impeachable offense is. They argued about 
that then and now. Though then, it was the republicans pressing for 
a definition. Are they alike? Nina Totenberg, now with National Public 
Radio, covered those hearings for "New times" magazine. It's in the 
same room, but there's really -- officially, the procedures are the 
same, but there's really very little that is exactly the same. The 
sense of importance is missing. The circus atmosphere is greater. 
The charges are different. Clinton, charged with lying under oath 
about sex. Nixon, charged with covering up a burglary at democratic 
headquarters by his campaign committee, with running undercover operations 
out of the White House, wiretapping his aides. This was a 50-ton truck 
moving in an inexorable direction, and it was sad for the country. 
This time, it's more of a partisan catfight, and blame who you will, 
that's the way it is. True. Six republicans on rodino's committee 
voted for the first article of impeachment. Votes in the Hyde committee 
so far have been party line. It's not about great issues of corrupting 
power by misusing the FBI or the cia. It's about a tawdry little sexual 
affair. So it's very different. One more difference -- Nixon's impeachment 
never reached the house floor because audiotapes proved his involvement 
in the cover-up and forced him to resign. Barring last-minute conversions, 
the Hyde committee is dxpected to approve articles of impeachment 
and send them to the full house for debate. Bruce Morton, CNN, Washington.
