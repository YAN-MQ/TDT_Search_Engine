After his third-string team lost 4-1 to Italy in the semifinals, U.S. 
Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson will do all he can to persuade Pete 
Sampras and Andre Agassi to play in next April's match against Britain. 
Britain's David Lloyd doesn't have that problem. He has Greg Rusedski 
and Tim Henman and virtually no-one else. American team officials 
came under fire when a weak U.S. team, without Sampras or Agassi, 
lost to Italy in the semifinals in Milwaukee in September. Next year 
is the centenary of the competition and Gullikson said he will hold 
individual meetings with his top two players to try and persuade them 
to face Rudedski and Henman in Birmingham, England, April 2-4. ``I 
have not specifically talked to Andre and Pete yet about playing in 
the tie. They have a very big event coming up next week (the ATP World 
Tour Championship) in Hanover and in December I want to personally 
go and visit each of them,'' Gullikson said Thursday in a conference 
call from his home at Palm Coast, Florida. ``I am going to approach 
them both after the season is over and talk about next year.'' Gullikson 
said he was mindful of the fact that both players have opted out of 
Davis Cup play in the past to concentrate on other tournaments and 
Agassi, strongly critical of US Tennis Association president Harry 
Marmion, had refused to play in Milwaukee. ``There are a lot of pressures 
pulling on the players and it's not quite as easy as it would appear 
on paper,'' Gullikson said. ``We need to have our very, very best 
team and Andre and Pete and Todd (Martin) are the strongest team.'' 
``Andre has said that was trying to leave the door open for the new 
president (Judy Levering),'' Gullikson said. ``He had a little bit 
of a row going with the outgoing president but he seems to have left 
the door open for next year.'' Gullikson said Sampras and Agassi had 
already made major impacts in Davis Cup play. ``This guys are already 
part of Davis Cup history,' he said. ``But we need our best team and 
we need the enthusiastic support of the players. As these guys get 
a little older, probably in the next three or four years they may 
be phasing out, I hope they would want to put their stamp on Davis 
Cup history. ``Next year the second round will be at the venue in 
Boston where it all started 100 years ago. It's an extremely historic 
year for the Davis Cup,'' Gullikson said. ``If someone had wanted 
to write a tough draw for us they couldn't have made it tougher. After 
we first play Britain then we probably play Australia in Boston. God 
forbid it's a relegation match.'' Gullikson said he still felt the 
criticism of last year's loss to Italy. ``People were clearly disgusted 
that we didn't, for some reason, field our best team. There was some 
fairly negative press because our best players weren't playing.'' 
Lloyd, who doesn't have a single player other than Henman (ninth) 
and Rusedski (11th) ranked in the top 100, said he had hoped to avoid 
the Americans by gaining a seed in the last 16. ``I don't know how 
we weren't seeded, but that's another issue,'' said the British captain, 
who also hoped that Sampras and Agassi would play. ``Whoever the Americans 
put out it will be a tremendous team,'' he said. ``If we can beat 
Andre and Pete it would be a lot more than beating Todd Martin and 
someone else. I should like them both to come here. ``I think that 
if Sampras refuses to play, he should never play for his country again,'' 
Lloyd said. ``Sampras says he does not realize why he is not a national 
hero when he walks out on the street. Maybe that's the reason. ``I 
can't really understand anybody, whether it's in any sport, not wanting 
to play for their country,'' Lloyd said. ``I would be devastated if 
Greg and Tim didn't want to play for Britain.'' Henman says he can't 
wait for the match. ``We've been talking about this tie for a long 
time,'' he said. ``We had two years in the wilderness and now we're 
back in the World Group. It doesn't get much bigger than playing the 
U.S. in any sport.''
