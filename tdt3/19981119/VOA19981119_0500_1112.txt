Slugger Juan Gonazales of baseball's Texas Rangers has been voted 
the American League's most valuable player for the second time. The 
outfielder received 21 of the 28 first-place votes by the Baseball 
Writer's Association of America. Boston short stop Normar Garcia Parel 
was second, followed by shor -stop Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees. 
The 29-year-old Gonazales helped lead the rangers to the American 
League west division title with a 318 batting average and 45 home 
runs. He had a league-leading 157 runs batted in -- the highest American 
League total since 1949. Two years ago, Gonazales edged Seattle Mariner 
shortstop Alex Rodriguez to win the MVP award for the first time. 
VOA sports editor Park Bruer spoke to Gonzalez after he received the 
award. If you had to vote for National League MVP, who would you choose 
and why? I'd vote for Tommy because Tommy has a great numbers, great 
year. I'll never for the amazing year for Mark McGuire in a broke 
-- at his record -- hitting 70 homers. And my feeling, you know, Sammy 
-- for Sammy because Chicago win the -- race and make in the playoff. 
The "Sammy" Gonzales refers to, of course, is Sammy Sosa of the Chicago 
Cubs. The National League most valuable player will be named on Thursday.
