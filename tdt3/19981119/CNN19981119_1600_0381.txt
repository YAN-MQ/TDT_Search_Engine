Three businesses were destroyed after a fire ravaged one of Santa 
Barbara, california's, top tourist attractions. It took firefighters 
3 1/2 hours to quell the flames at historic Stearns wharf last night. 
300 feet, or roughly 15% of the wooden Pier, was destroyed. One firefighter 
was slightly injured. The flames were fueled by wood that had been 
treated with a chemical to preserve the wharf. The cause remains under 
investigation.
