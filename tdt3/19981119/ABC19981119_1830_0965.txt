The president was thousands of miles away from the hearing today. 
One of the things he did was have dinner in Tokyo with the Japanese 
prime minister. Mr. Clinton urged the Japanese people to be patient 
with their government's efforts to revive the economy. Earlier in 
the week, the government announced $196 billion worth of tax cuts 
and spending programs. To get T he economy going,/P included is a 
$5 billion plan trying to force people to spend by giving them a gift. 
"On the money" tonight, ABC's Mark Litke. Gift upons called "shohinken" 
are actually big business in Japan. Companies hand them out by the 
millions to promote products. Japanese give them to each other on 
most special occasions. But, the idea of gift coupons to help solve 
the economic crisis here, has been met with near universal ridicule. 
Japan's most influential financial newspaper calls it, "A silly idea 
not worthy of being called an economic policy." Still, here's how 
it will work. Vouchers worth about $160 will be given to elderly pensioners 
and to families with children under 15. The vouchers must be used 
within six months, only at certain stores, and cannot be exchanged 
for cash. Kudaranai. Meaningless. And here's why. Japan needs people 
to start spending again on big-ticket consumer items, and the gift 
coupons won't be nearly enough for that. Furthermore, surveys show 
that most people plan to use the coupons for necessities. And just 
save the $160 they would have spent anyway. If it's not going to do 
the trick, then it's just a waste of money and effort. So far, it 
seems, all this plan has accomplished is to strengthen the perception 
that Japan's political leadership is weak, and floundering. Applying 
band-AIDS to the economy, in this case, coupon band-AIDS, when what's 
really needed is some serious surgery. Mark Litke, ABC News, Tokyo.
