No problems so far for U.N. weapons inspection teams now back at work 
more than two weeks after Iraq suspended cooperation. While a U.N. 
spokeswoman wouldn't say what sites the teams are targeting or what 
they're doing, it's believed their first priority was checking already-installed 
cameras and sensors for long-term monitoring. Some observers predict 
the real challenge will come later when inspectors begin surprise 
visits to suspected weapons sites.
