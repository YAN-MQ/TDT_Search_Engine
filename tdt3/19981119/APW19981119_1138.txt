An Israeli man police said was planning an attack against Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu in a northern Israeli city Thursday, was arrested. 
Israel radio identified the suspect as 48-year-old Shabtai Blochman, 
a central figure in the ultra-Orthodox Chabad movement. Blochman was 
apparently planning to attack Netanyahu in the city of Tsfat, where 
the premier was visiting soldiers wounded in Lebanon. Police spokeswoman 
Linda Menuhin did not provide details of the planned attack. She said 
the incident was being investigated. The radio said Blochman had organized 
dozens of Chabad activists in Tsfat to protest an Israeli troop withdrawal 
from parts of the West Bank set to begin early Friday. Israel radio 
said that Blochman, like many in the Chabad movement, had been active 
in Netanyahu's 1996 election campaign and felt betrayed by the prime 
minister for giving up land to Palestinians that religious Jews believe 
was promised to them by God.
