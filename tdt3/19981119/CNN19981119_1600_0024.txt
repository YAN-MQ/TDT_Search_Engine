Aggressive questioning and calm, deliberate answers. Independent counsel 
Ken Starr is hearing from members of the house judiciary committee 
this afternoon. Starr is the only witness in today's impeachment inquiry. 
Right now the committee is taking a short break and will reconvene 
in five minutes. Democrats and republicans have been taking turns 
with their remarks when they aren't arguing among themselves over 
procedural matters. So far only five members of the committee have 
finished their questions. Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde was hoping 
to finish with Starr in one day, but the proceedings are running long.
