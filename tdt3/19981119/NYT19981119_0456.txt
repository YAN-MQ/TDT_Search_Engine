Kenneth Starr's measured, unflappably academic performance before 
the Judiciary Committee resounded with anticlimax after all the long 
months of salacious news and sensational accusations that have put 
President Clinton at risk of impeachment. The independent counsel 
so long out of public sight except for his morning taking-out-the-garbage 
photo opportunities finally stepped forth to speak in defense of his 
case before a skittish Congress and apprehensive nation. But, far 
from offering another lengthy narrative on DNA results and lurid Oval 
Office behavior, Starr chose to beam judiciousness itself as he hid 
any rancor and faced Democrats aching to wrestle him into the dock 
in substitution of the president. ``Why did your office violate the 
law?'' one Democrat finally snapped at him in the sixth hour of a 
day iron-hard with partisanship. But Starr did not rise openly to 
the bait as the Democrats barbed their questions with everything from 
mockery to irony. He responded in phrases of high professionalism 
and supreme regard for the law, arguing that his proposed case against 
the president was rooted not in political bias, but rather in ``the 
sanctity, yes the sanctity, of the judicial process.'' Minutes later, 
this left Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., fairly gagging in the hallway 
during a break. ``Pathetic! Pathetic!'' he declared of Starr, asking 
how such proclaimed standards of sanctity squared with Starr's continued 
private lawyering in the corporate sector even as he pursued the president, 
or his renunciation of the news leaks that have buoyed the case against 
the president for the past 10 months. ``He's much more political than 
I thought he was,'' Meehan said as the Democrats warily took their 
first up-close measure of the prosecutor. It is something of a Capitol 
Hill tradition that witnesses often gain the status of victim during 
a grueling hearing. As the Democrats peppered Starr into the night 
with some shouted salvos of ``Do you affirm or deny'' questions, the 
independent counsel, as if mindful of that tradition, was far from 
complaining. Originally, Starr wanted to indicate his special position, 
according to committee staffers, by being allowed to stand and speak 
before the Judiciary Committee at a lectern, as he did before the 
Supreme Court when he was solicitor general. But Republican majority 
members decided it best he make his case seated at a table, like any 
other witness. The Democrats took their opening shots at him frontally, 
denouncing him as the nation's ``sex policeman.'' ``Mr. Starr has 
crossed the line into obsession,'' declared a scowling Rep. John Conyers, 
D-Mich., the ranking minority member, reviewing Starr's four years 
of investigating a half dozen presidential portfolios, from Whitewater 
to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Neither harried nor hurried, Starr 
used every minute of his two hour opening statement to restate his 
case against Clinton in slow emphatic tones. ``Few have ventured that 
the president told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth,'' he declared, savoring the word ``truth'' and the court oath. 
This became his rhetorical device at various times in accusing the 
president of gravely violating that oath in the sex-and-mendacity 
scandal. Democrats aimed to make their points before the watching 
national audience. But, still, some seem frustrated in seeking a promising 
handhold on Starr. ``He didn't look like a terrible, horrible person,'' 
said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., smilingly conceded during a break. 
``He looked like a lawyer reading a boring, monotonous speech.'' After 
Starr disowned any personal talent or partisan experience in the world 
of politics, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., asked a series of skeptical 
questions. ``Why did you withhold that before the election,'' he asked, 
referring to the exoneration of the president that Starr suddenly 
announced Thursday in several areas of his investigations. Slowly, 
patiently, Starr denied all partisan machinations. When Frank asked 
about leaks from the Starr investigation, Starr, a former judge, gently 
objected: ``That is an unfair question.'' ``If you tell me it's an 
unfair question, why I'll withdraw it,'' Frank shot back in mock reverence 
at Starr's demeanor of judiciousness. There was a genuine moment of 
bipartisan, inside-the-Beltway laughter when Starr defended an early 
press release that made no mention of threats that Ms. Lewinsky claimed 
were made by the independent counsel's office. ``Let me explain what 
press statements are designed to do,'' he responded and laughter rolled 
across the room in general acknowledgment of the capital's mendacious 
habits. Starr had to grin. Later, news workers could be seen openly 
grinning, in turn, as Starr, quite professorial in tone, declined 
to release from pledges of confidentiality the squads of reporters 
gifted across the months with leaks in the inquiry. As Starr testified 
into the committee's long night, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., praised him 
for tolerating the ``nonsense'' of critics and offered him a lawyerly 
hypothetical. ``Let's presume that Monica is an oversexed blabbermouth,'' 
Barr began, presuming further ``the vast right wing conspiracy'' is 
true, along with other contentions from critics. Would that change 
the basic conclusion that the president deserved impeachment? ``It 
would not change it,'' Starr responded, his tone and meter as judicious 
at the ninth hour as it was in the morning. ``The facts have a real 
power to them.''
