While President Clinton is in Tokyo asking Japan to buy more American 
goods, US exports to Japan continued to fall. The overall level of 
trade between the two countries, that's imports and exports has decreased 
so much that Japan has now fallen to number three on America's list 
of trade partners. Figures released this week show Canada still in 
first, and Mexico moving ahead of Japan into second place because 
the economic crisis has lowered prices for Asian products, some US 
goods are getting harder to sell, One of the American sectors hurt 
most is the steel industry. Liz George has more from her Business 
Desk in New York. Over recent months, the amount of hot rod steel 
coming into the US has risen by 500 percent as Asian countries flood 
the market with cheap exports. Steel makers here are accusing the 
Asians of dumping and warning that unless action is taken to prevent 
this, they will be forced to make cuts and job losses will result. 
Albert Fishlow is a Senior Fellow with the Council of Foreign Relations. 
One of the realities is that the American balance of payments deficit 
has increased as the Asian countries have been shipping to the United 
States rather than to Japan, which has not been growing. And the fear 
is that this deficit will amount to something on the order of 3 percent 
of American GDP. I think what Clinton is trying to do is encourage 
Japan to begin growing, and in that way it will begin importing from 
the neighbors of Japan in Asia, but also he'd like to see a little 
more imports from the United States itself. And that is one of the 
areas in which there was just recently trouble in the meeting in Kuala 
Lumpur. The United States was concerned about the Japanese unwillingness 
to continue reducing imports in the agriculture area, where US exports 
have always been very substantial. Meanwhile currency markets have 
been boosted by President's visit to Japan. The Yen has risen sharply 
against the Dollar even though the President made the familiar plea 
for Japan to open up its markets, and start importing more from the 
US. For The World, I'm Liz George, in New York.
