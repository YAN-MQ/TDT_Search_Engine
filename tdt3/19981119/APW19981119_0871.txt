The New England Patriots have reached a tentative deal to move from 
suburban Boston about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest to Hartford, 
it was announced Thrusday. If the deal can be finalized between now 
and the end of the year, the Patriots would play their first U.S. 
National Football League game in Hartford in 2001, Connecticut Gov. 
John G Rowland said, as team owner Robert Kraft stood at his side 
in the Capitol. The announcement was met with raucous applause from 
business and legislative leaders. Hartford has desperately wanted 
to regain ``major league'' status since the North American National 
Hockey League's Whalers left in 1997 and became the Carolina Hurricanes. 
The Patriots would play in a proposed dlrs 350 million, 68,000-seat, 
open-air stadium which also would become the new home of college gridiron 
team from the University of Connecticut. The proposed deal would keep 
the team in Hartford for at least 30 years. Kraft had been unable 
to reach an agreement with lawmakers in the state of Massachusetts 
on a new stadium for the Patriots. He said the stadium in Foxboro, 
Massachusetts _ used for the 1994 World Cup and also the home of the 
New England Revolution of Major League Soccer, ``is not a stadium 
for the modern NFL,'' and said the facility was built in 1970 on a 
6 million-dollar budget. ``I love the stadium, but it's just not proper 
for the future,'' he said. Kraft said he did not anticipate any difficulty 
in obtaining approval for the move from other NFL owners, despite 
Hartford's proximity to the New York metropolitan area. Despite the 
Revolution also being owned by Kraft, they are expected to remain 
in Boston.
