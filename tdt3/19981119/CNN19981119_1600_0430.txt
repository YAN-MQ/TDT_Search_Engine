After a series of delays, Israel is turning over territory in the 
West Bank to Palestinian control for the first time in two years. 
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet narrowly gave 
the go-ahead today to the first stage of the new Middle East interim 
agreement. The withdrawal of Israeli troops may be finished tomorrow. 
The first stage of the pullback transfers 2% of the West Bank -- or 
44 square miles -- to joint control with Israel, and 7% to sole Palestinian 
control.
