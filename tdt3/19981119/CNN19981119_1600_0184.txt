Before Starr began his testimony, several democrats asked to expand 
the amount of time President Clinton's lawyers would get to question 
the independent counsel. The motion was voted down, but not before 
some verbal sparring between committee chairman Henry Hyde and democratic 
member Melvin Watt. The gentleman has made a point that the president 
needs more time to present -- you said present. He will be given all 
the time in the world to present, unlimited time to -- Point of order, 
Mr. chairman. Today's hearing is to hear from judge Starr. And to 
question him -- Point of order, Mr. chairman. No, the chair -- I don't 
yield for any points of order. I would like to make my statement. 
I thought you had already made your statement, Mr. chairman. Well, 
I know that's what you thought. But you couldn't possibly know when 
I'm through with my statement or not. So please let me -- Under the 
rules under which we're operating, Mr. chairman, we don't know anything 
about the process. We had regular order at one point. I'm asking for 
regular order. I'm requesting order. Regular order is we get five 
minutes to address this issue. The chairman has already had his five 
minutes. Now, I want to tell this committee, and especially the democrats, 
I had a Meeting with Mr. Conyers and Mr. Frank a couple of days ago. 
And I suggested I would be very liberal with the gavel. And if Mr. 
Kendall is on a line of questioning that he deems pertinent, I don't 
intend to shut anybody off. Now you are, you are -- you are disrupting 
the continuity of this meeting with these adversarial motions. We're 
disrupting a railroad, it seems like, Mr. chairman. That's what we're 
disrupting here.
