The idea of casting a wild elephant and making its image in bronze 
came to the sculptor known as Mihail one night in the 1970s at his 
loft apartment in the Chelsea district. Since being invited to leave 
his native country, Bulgaria (Mihail is an independent-minded sculptor), 
he had been involved in casting from nature: making a mold of the 
sand in Tunisia (he and his daughter almost died of thirst after Mihail 
used their water for plaster); making a cast of grass in Alsace-Lorraine. 
Yes, the sculptor known as Mihail says, he is aware that there was 
perfectly good grass in Central Park, but he had in mind a larger 
project: casting the world. Then a new idea came to Mihail: casting 
an elephant. This Mihail actually accomplished, sedating and casting 
a bull elephant in Kenya in 1980. It took 18 years to complete his 
sculpture, and he gave it to the United Nations in a ceremony this 
week. So you can imagine the artist's response when he learned that 
a number of U.N. delegates were offended by the size of the genitalia 
on his 3{-ton elephant and, after considering surgery, were planning 
to surround the sculpture with tall shrubs. ``I take it as a joke,'' 
says Mihail, who despite 25 years in the United States retains a Bulgarian 
accent. ``Until I saw, myself, the bushes being planted. This is exactly 
the problem between people and wildlife. They create a frontier. Like 
the Iron Curtain, the Berlin Wall.'' A joke from the artist, who, 
while he glowered often during the ceremony, does have a sense of 
humor: ``If I know who started this, I challenge him to a duel.'' 
The newest member of the city's bronze menagerie stands in the United 
Nations' garden, clearly visible through the iron fence at 48th Street. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, accepting the gift on Wednesday, quoted 
the writer Isak Dinesen: ``Elephants pace along as if they have an 
appointment at the end of the world.'' Mihail's elephant looks as 
if it has an appointment with a lady elephant, and she's just around 
the corner, with Sinatra on the boom box and a bucket of martinis. 
The reason for this, according to Hans Janitschek, who heads the fund 
that raised the money for the project, is medicinal: When the elephant 
was sedated, in Africa, ``he had a sweet dream.'' The story of the 
elephant begins with Mihail, 69, whose family name is Simeonov. In 
Bulgaria, Mihail is a successful sculptor of national monuments. Then, 
in 1966, he glorifies the wrong man and is exiled to Tunisia. He settles 
with his wife and daughter in New York. The idea of casting an elephant 
occurs soon after. ``I wanted it to be the biggest creature in the 
world,'' Mihail says over lunch with his daughter, Iana, 33, after 
the ceremony. ``The idea clicked so powerfully in me I never gave 
it a second thought.'' ``You also thought about a lion,'' Ms. Simeonov 
says. ``Did I?'' says Mihail. ``Ah well, this is a problem with me. 
I have a selective memory. I don't remember things I don't want to 
remember and I do remember things that don't happen.'' Mihail continues. 
``I have been reading Rousseau's `Social Contract' and I am very influenced 
by it, the idea there is a contract between every member of society. 
I knew I had to make some contract between me and the elephant.'' 
A word he likes: ``It will be an enchanting thing to make a contract 
with the elephant.'' As Mihail then requires someone to speak for 
the elephant's rights, he finds a lawyer and creates the Cast the 
Sleeping Elephant Trust. For casting the elephant, Mihail settles 
on alginate, a quick-drying casting material used by dentists. (When 
working with elephants, Mihail notes, you want to be fast.) In March 
1980, accompanied by two helicopters, 11 chase vehicles, the Kenyan 
elephant-immobilization team and a gang of foreign correspondents, 
Mihail goes tracking in northern Kenya, on a 117,000-acre ranch belonging 
to Adnan Khashoggi, the arms dealer, who is then underwriting the 
project. Soon a 50-year-old bull elephant is sighted. ``Not very friendly,'' 
Mihail recounts. ``The veterinarian gave him two shots, but he ran 
for 20 minutes. At one time he tried to run in a river bed; the helicopter 
came down and chased him away. A herd of elephants, hearing an elephant 
in distress, comes running. Finally, he stops and stands shaking, 
and then he falls down.'' Wasn't Mihail supposed to be representing 
the rights of the elephant? ``Not me,'' Mihail says. ``The trust. 
I am doing what people always do. They hunt.'' It sounds as if this 
project was more in the interest of art than in the interest of elephants. 
``It's in the total interest of art and elephants,'' Mihail said. 
Mihail says the Cast the Sleeping Elephant Trust will raise money 
for wildlife preservation by selling additional sculptures at $6 million 
each. So far there are no takers. Nor is there any money left in the 
trust. According to Janitschek, it cost $500,000 to produce the elephant, 
and only days before the ceremony, the Modern Art Foundry of Queens, 
where the elephant was cast, refused to release it until an outstanding 
bill of $2,000 was paid. The bill was paid by another emigre, Franziska 
Sorger, an Austrian pastry chef who owns the Big Apple Strudel shop 
on Second Avenue.
