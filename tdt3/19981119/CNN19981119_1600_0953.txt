A big day for big name technology stocks. For a full report on the 
markets we go to Beverly Schuch at the "CNN Financial News" newsdesk 
in New York. Thanks, Lori. Technology stocks are rocketing higher 
today. Investors are betting on a record holiday season for E-commerce 
and personal computer sales. Some of the shining stars today -- but 
one analyst warns investors to be picky with shares at these prices. 
This is a second tier of stocks which would include companies like 
the globe, some of the other por tall companies like lycos. I think 
those should be avoided at this point just because of valuation.
