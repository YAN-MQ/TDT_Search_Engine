Prime Minister Tony Blair, defeated by the unelected House of Lords, 
said Thursday that his government will not be able to introduce a 
new voting system in time for European Parliament elections in June. 
The bill to introduce a system used in five other European countries, 
including France and Germany, was rejected by the Lords on Wednesday 
for the fifth successive time. The Labor Party government could, under 
parliamentary laws, get the measure passed by the end of the year 
without reference to the Lords, but it would need the agreement of 
the opposition Conservative Party not to delay the bill in the House 
of Commons. However, Conservative leader William Hague said Thursday 
that the party will not cooperate with a measure it considers undemocratic. 
The bill provides that instead of voting for a candidate, voters choose 
a party which allocates seats to its nominees. Critics say the measure 
deprives voters of the right to choose a candidate and gives party 
officials power to decide who gets elected.
