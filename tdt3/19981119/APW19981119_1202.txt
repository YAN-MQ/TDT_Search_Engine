Against the nerve-shattering rumble of rockslides, army troops on 
Thursday guarded this abandoned village on the slopes of Mexico's 
most active volcano. Soldiers said they spent a nervous night listening 
to boulders tumble from the 3,820-meter (12,533 feet) peak of the 
smoking Colima Volcano, which geologists say could erupt at any time, 
sending lava down its slopes. ``You could hear it last night, a booming 
sound as rocks tumbled down the slope,'' Capt. Audelio Ramos said 
as he stood watch over the evacuated hamlet of Yerba Buena, eight 
kilometers (five miles) from the crater's white plume of gas and water 
vapor. Geologists say there is also a one-in-three chance that pent-up 
lava could blow away the blocked passages of the cone in a massive 
explosion, possibly rivaling a 1913 eruption that showered ash and 
blew out windows far from the peak. ``The volcano's activity continues 
to rise ... which means that the possibilities of an eruption continue 
to increase,'' a committee of volcano experts and civil defense officials 
said in a joint statement released at a news conference in the city 
of Colima, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the peak. ``The small 
rock dome that has formed on the crater may collapse, allowing a flow 
of lava to descend,'' said geologist Servando de la Cruz of the National 
Center for Disaster Prevention. Civil defense coordinator Melchior 
Urrutia said the Colima state government is prepared to evacuate as 
many people as necessary. ``It's better to sin by being over-cautious 
than to pick up bodies,'' Urrutia said. Officials just hope the peak, 
also known as the ``Volcano of Fire,'' will give warning enough to 
evacuate the towns nearest the base. ``If the volcano will just give 
us two hours, we could have everybody out,'' Capt. Ramos said. Other 
soldiers nearby tended to the farm animals left behind by the village's 
140 residents when they were evacuated Wednesday. Yerba Buena _ where 
abandoned dogs, pigs and chickens wandered the deserted streets and 
plastic banners hung for an interrupted town festival hung limply 
in the air _ has seen this before. The hamlet is built on an 8-meter 
(25-foot) thick layer of debris from ancient eruptions, which residents 
say only makes the soil richer. Bulbous squash plants and others crops 
poke out of the dark soil on local farms. In recent times, lava has 
never descended in recent times below the 2,000-meter (6,500-foot) 
mark, volcano researcher Carlos Navarro said _ well above the altitude 
of the villages. A gaggle of children at the elementary school in 
La Becerrera, just 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) down the slope from Yerba 
Buena, took a break from studying the little their textbooks say about 
volcanoes _ about three paragraphs _ and said they aren't afraid of 
the smoking giant above them. ``I would just run away'' if the volcano 
erupted, said Humberto Gonzalez Godin, 11. Some older schoolmates 
said they would try to catch a ride to the nearest village, 5 kilometers 
(three miles) away. Their teacher, Noe Perez Rodriguez, held class 
outside because the concrete roof of his former classroom is cracked 
and may be vulnerable to earthquakes, another threat during eruptions. 
``They did a study last year, and found that the kids who lived closest 
to the volcano knew the least about it,'' Perez Rodriguez said. ``To 
them, it's just a big, smoky monster.''
