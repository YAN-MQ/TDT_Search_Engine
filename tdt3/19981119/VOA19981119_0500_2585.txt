A geophysicist says he has found a tiny piece of a massive asteroid 
that collided with earth 65 million years ago, judging the course 
of evolution forever. Frank Kyte of the University of California says 
the meteoric rock came from what is known as the KT Boundary. It's 
a thin layer of earth's crust, containing debris from the giant asteroid. 
An analysis of the tiny fragment is published in Thursday's edition 
of the Journal Nature. It was found to contain a high concentration 
of the raare metal iridium, as well as other metals at levels usually 
found in extraterrestrial objects and -- considered the evidence that 
it is from an asteroid. As the overal theory goes, the KT asteroid, 
measuring about 10 kilometers across, it is estimated, exploded when 
it hit earth's atmosphere with a force greater than all the nuclear 
weapons ever made. Scientists believe the intial explosion and the 
ensuing period of global cooling is responsible for killing off the 
dinosaurs. You're tuned to VOA News Now. I'm Charlene Porter, along 
with Les Carpenter.
