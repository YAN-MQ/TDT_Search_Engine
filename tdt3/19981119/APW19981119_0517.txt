China's top legislative official has called for speedy passage of 
a securities law to ensure future healthy growth of the country's 
stock markets, state media said Thursday. Li Peng, chairman of the 
National People's Congress, China's legislature, said stock markets 
are an integral part of the Chinese economy that have seen rapid growth 
since they were introduced eight years ago. But Li said regulatory 
problems have cropped up due to the lack of a complete body of rules 
to regulate trade. ``We must use the rule of law to bring about standardization 
of the markets,'' Li said, in remarks published by the official Xinhua 
News Agency. China's stock markets have grown from just a handful 
of listed companies worth some dlrs 200 million to more than 800 companies 
now traded on the two markets in Shanghai and the southern city of 
Shenzhen. Those companies now have a total market capitalization of 
some dlrs 240 billion. But regulatory problems abound. Despite multiple 
efforts, the People's Congress has failed to pass a national securities 
law. The latest attempt was in late October, when the NPC again considered 
the law for passage. Li visited Shenzhen, home to many of the most 
intractable regulatory problems, to collect opinions of industry officials. 
He called for the speedy passage of the law during the next NPC meeting.
