After Japan, Mr. Clinton will go to South Korea to discuss issues 
like North Korea and its suspected nuclear program. United States 
is demanding open access to underground site, which is in question. 
Charles Kartman, the special U.S. envoy who has just been in North 
Korea for three days, said the two sides were still far apart on American 
demands. Mr. Kartan -- Kartman is now back in South Korea. He told 
reporters that a 1994 nuclear deal with North Korea could be in danger, 
unless North Korea allows access to that underground site.
