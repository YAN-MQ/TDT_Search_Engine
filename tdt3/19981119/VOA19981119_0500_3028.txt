The government reports the U.S. trade deficit fell in September from 
a record high in August. The surge in U.S. aircraft exports was the 
major reason for the improvement. Most analysts say the U.S. trade 
gap will remain large in coming months, as deman slows for U.S. exports 
and cheaper imports flood the country from cash-starved economies 
overseas, mainly in Asia. Before he left Washington yesterday, President 
Clinton said curing Asia's economic flu will be his top priority. 
If people overseas lose their jobs, therefore, they can't afford American 
products and our workers and farmers pay the price. We see that in 
a slight decline in our exports, so far, this year, due to the global 
financial crisis in general and the problems in Asia, in particular.
