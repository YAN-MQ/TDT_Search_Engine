Eddie Elias, a lawyer who founded the Professional Bowlers Association 
in 1958 and later represented sports and entertainment celebrities, 
died Nov. 15 at Naples (Fla.) Community Hospital. He was 69. The PBA 
said the cause was complications of pneumonia. Elias suffered a stroke 
in 1995 and had been confined to a wheelchair since. After the stroke, 
he moved from Akron, Ohio, to Naples while Eddie Elias Enterprises, 
his sports-marketing firm, remained in Akron. The firm's clients included 
Don Carter, Dick Weber and Carmen Salvino from bowling; Tommy Bolt, 
Chi Chi Rodriguez, Fuzzy Zoeller, Gary McCord, Ken Venturi and Bob 
Murphy from golf; Rony Seikaly from basketball and Ralph Nader, Phil 
Donahue, Marlo Thomas, Chris Schenkel and Phyllis George. Elias was 
best known for his role in lifting bowling from a blue-collar recreational 
activity in dingy, smoke-filled alleys to television's second-longest-running 
professional sport behind college football. While working his way 
through Case Western Reserve Law School in Cleveland, he was a radio 
and television producer and performer at WAKR in Akron and WESW in 
Cleveland. One day, on ``The Eddie Elias Show'' in Akron, he was interviewing 
Don Carter, perhaps the most celebrated bowler ever, and Dick Hoover, 
who had just won the All-Star tournament, the predecessor of bowling's 
U.S. Open. At a time when 10 percent of the U.S. recreational dollar 
was being spent on bowling, Carter and Hoover bemoaned the absence 
of an organization that could run a tournament circuit. Elias decided 
to change that, and at the 1958 American Bowling Congress Masters 
tournament he persuaded 33 professional bowlers to put up $50 each 
to start the PBA. As the PBA's legal counsel, Elias nurtured the organization 
and the sport. In 1965, he persuaded the maker of Firestone tires 
to sponsor bowling's most elite annual competition, the Tournament 
of Champions, one of the first corporate sponsorships of a national 
sports event. In the early 1960s, television had difficulty selling 
advertising time for sports events. Elias realized that bowling needed 
television more than television needed bowling, and under his guidance 
the PBA started selling at least 80 percent of the advertising time 
on its own. With those contracts in his hands, Elias then negotiated 
with the television networks to carry the tournaments. ``It really 
started out of necessity,'' Elias said of the sell-your-own philosophy. 
``Without TV, we were out of business. But I knew a network couldn't 
refuse something with most of the ad time already sold.'' Elias also 
marketed such television series as ``Jackpot Bowling,'' ``Make That 
Spare'' and, with Marlo Thomas, ``That Girl.'' As Donahue, the talk-show 
host, said, ``Long before free agency, long before pro sports rose 
to billion-dollar levels, there was Big E, bargaining his heart out 
for big and small clients alike.'' Edward George Elias was born Dec. 
12, 1928, in Akron, and at 6 feet 2 inches he played baseball and 
basketball at the University of Akron. He was a member of the ABC 
Hall of Fame and the PBA Hall of Fame. He is survived by his wife, 
the former Peggy Emerson; two daughters, Rainy of Akron and Annie 
of Chicago, and three sisters, Jackie Wilson, Norma Balaj and Nancy 
Stevens, all of Akron.
