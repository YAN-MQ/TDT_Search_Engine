The environmental group Greenpeace and 11 other organizations want 
the U.S. government to immediately ban all vinyl toys for children 
under the age of 6. the groups say many of the toys contain toxic 
substances that can be chewed or sucked by young children. For instance, 
they say a chemical softener that makes some vinyl toys flexible is 
highly toxic when digested by animals. Greenpeace says the toys should 
be tested for safety in the same way drugs are tested. We've seen 
a very mixed response from companies, carefully selecting words like, 
"direct to mouth," "mouthing and sucking chewing toys," but there 
is no real uniform or state of the art language for that. And that's 
why the government more than ever needs to step in and even the playing 
field for companies, but to protect consumers overall.
