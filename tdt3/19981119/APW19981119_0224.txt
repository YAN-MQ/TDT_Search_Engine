A bus plunged into a ravine off an icy road in southern Russia on 
Thursday, killing three people, a news report said. The accident occurred 
when a bus traveling out of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don 
skidded on a patch of ice, collided with a small car in front of it, 
and plunged 30 meters (100 feet) down a ravine, the state television 
station ORT reported. Two men and a woman died in the crash, while 
twelve passengers and the driver were taken to a hospital. Several 
of the hospitalized passengers are in critical condition, the report 
said. The bus was traveling east along the Moscow-Baku highway, about 
1100 kilometers (680 miles) south of Moscow.
