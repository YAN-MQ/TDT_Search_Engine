A Sikh newspaper publisher who was critical of Sikh hard-liners was 
shot to death in the garage of his Vancouver home, police said Thursday. 
Tara Singh Hayer, 64, publisher of the Indo-Canadian Times, was killed 
Wednesday evening. He had used a wheelchair since being partially 
paralyzed by a previous assassination attempt a decade ago. The publisher's 
son, Sukhdev Hayer, said he believed the killing was an attempt to 
intimidate voters in upcoming elections for leadership at a Sikh temple 
in the Vancouver area. The area's Sikh community has been plagued 
for years by violence between moderates and fundamentalists over an 
edict from the religion's ruling body in India to remove tables and 
chairs from temple dining halls. Fundamentalists consider the tables 
and chairs to be improper additions to a temple.
