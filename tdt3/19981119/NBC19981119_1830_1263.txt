Health news tonight, important information for all men and their families 
an prostate cancer. Men should be aware of that by now, but most don't 
want to talk about it and many simply don't want to be tested. It 
is a complicated issue. We get some answers from Roger O'Neil. He 
desperately wants to hear good news, but is terrified it will be bad. 
Steve cook. For a man over 50, two of the most dreaded words from 
his doctor are -- prostate cancer. I got your path report back last 
night. One of the biopsies showed there was cancer. That's the bad 
news. The national cancer society estimates 184,500 men will hear 
that this year. Devastating news, but early screening, when the cancer 
hasn't advanced, makes a difference. The good news is that we got 
it early. It's treatable and curable. The major impact of screening 
has been on the number of cases of advanced prostate cancer that are 
diagnosed. In the past, 60% to 70% were advanced. Now, it's less than 
10% of cases. So who's at risk? Age is the biggest factor. But a man's 
race and family cancer history are important, too. These men, twice 
as likely to get the disease. Prostate cancer occurs about as often 
in men as breast cancer does in women. It kills about as many, too 
-- an estimated 40,000 this year. A simple blood test, called "psa," 
provides an early warning signal. Other tests are critical to verify 
the presence of cancer. But many doctors don't support early psa screening 
-- too many false results. In fact, three out of four. And this cancer 
usually grows very, very slowly, especially in older men. Most end 
up dying from something else. The risk of being tested is you may 
be diagnosed with a cancer that is never gonna harm. In fact, there's 
no proof yet that men, as a group, are living any longer. And no one 
knows the cause of prostate cancer either, but fatty diets are high 
on the list. Researchers think soy products including tofu cut risks. 
Selenium, vitamin E and D from sunlight may help. Despite broad awareness 
of prostate cancer, less than 50% of men who should be tested have 
been. why? Some doctors don't recommend it and men just put it off. 
Should you get tested? Here's a way to gauge your risk. Take your 
age, 52, and subtract 10. That's the chance you have prostate cancer 
right now. 42% for me. 50-year-old Steve cook took the test, but now 
he knows and faces the difficult choice -- what to do. Roger O'Neil,
