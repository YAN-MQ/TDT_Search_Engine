The Ford Focus, a subcompact that is replacing two distinct Escorts 
manufactured in Europe and North America, is Europe's car of the year. 
The award jury comprises automotive journalists from 21 countries. 
Of the 55 members, 42 gave the Focus their top votes, and it received 
a total of 444 points, beating the Opel/Vauxhall Astra (272), the 
Peugeot 206 (249), the Audi TT (235) and the Volvo S80 (175). To some 
extent, the prize vindicates Ford's risky design for the Focus, especially 
the New Edge styling _ a combination of straight lines, curves and 
planes. The Focus has a clear resemblance to Ford's Ka city car and 
its Puma sporty coupe, niche vehicles that preceded the Focus to market 
in Europe. The award does not guarantee sales success, but previous 
winners have done well. The Fiat Punto (1995), the Fiat Bravo/Brava 
(1996) and the Renault Megane Scenic (1997) were all commercial successes. 
The 1998 winner, the Alfa Romeo 156, had sales of 76,000 through the 
first nine months of this year; its predecessor sold only 10,000 units 
in the comparable period a year earlier. The Focus replaces two separate 
platforms for the American and European Escorts. The Focus went on 
sale in Europe early last month, as three- and five-door hatchbacks, 
four-door sedans and station wagons. Sales begin next fall in the 
United States. Last year, Ford sold 419,662 Escorts in Europe and 
323,112 in North America. A spokesman said Ford expected to sell 1 
million Focuses annually worldwide.
