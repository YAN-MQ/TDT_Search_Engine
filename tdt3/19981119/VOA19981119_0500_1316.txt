And French lawmakers are expected to pass an anti-doping law in the 
aftermath of the Tour de France scandal in which widespread drug abuse 
was uncovered. French sports minister Marie Jorge Bafet Wednesday 
urged Parliament to approve what could be the world's toughest anti-doping 
law. Among other measures, the bill would create an independent counsel 
to oversee national drug testing in France and provide tough penalties 
for people convicted of supplying drugs. France's Parliament is expected 
to debate and vote Thursday on the legislation. The Senate has already 
approved the bill.
