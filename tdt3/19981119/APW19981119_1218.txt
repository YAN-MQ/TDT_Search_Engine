With flowing, curly blonde hair that can't be contained by her helmet, 
Sarah Schleper cuts a memorable figure on the slopes. And with a career-best 
16th-place finish in the World Cup giant slalom on Thursday, Schleper 
served notice that she plans to be known for her racing prowess as 
well as her coiffure. Along with Alexandra Shaffer's surprising 26th-place 
performance, the first event of the four-day America's Opening was 
a solid success for the home team. Their feats were even more impressive 
considering their late starting numbers: 39th for Schleper and 40th 
for Shaffer. A small but vocal Park City crowd cheered both Americans 
down the slopes and carried them to their best World Cup finishes. 
``There's nothing like racing at home and hearing the crowd cheer,'' 
Schleper said. ``They were great.'' Schleper hopes to use a strong 
finish in the Park City event as a steppingstone to greater success, 
just like top American skier Kristina Koznick did last season. Koznick 
placed fourth in the 1997 slalom on the same course and went on to 
a stellar year. ``I wanted to finish well, but the bottom line was 
I wanted to finish, period,'' Schleper said. She tamed the tricky 
C.B.'s Run in a solid morning performance, finishing 18th with a time 
of 1:07.01 in the first run. She credited her success to concentrating 
on her own performance instead of watching the European stars before 
her. ``It makes you feel like you're not part of it when you watch 
too much,'' Schleper said. ``I just wanted to concentrate on myself.'' 
On her second run, Schleper finished just as a light snow began to 
dust the course. Visibility immediately decreased near the top of 
the run, and many later skiers struggled. ``Well, God's in charge 
of time, and he gave me a little today,'' she said. Long considered 
a slalom specialist, Schleper has actually enjoyed her greatest international 
success in giant slalom in recent months. Last season, she scored 
her first World Cup points and also won her first national title, 
but she accomplished both feats in the GS discipline. ``The snow was 
easy today,'' Schleper said. ``I was thinking that I could definitely 
finish well here.'' Schleper, 19, also drew inspiration from her father, 
Buzz, and brother, Hunter, who made the trek to Park City from their 
hometown of Vail, Colorado, where Buzz owns a ski shop. ``It's great 
having my family here,'' Schleper said. ``It gives you that little 
extra incentive.'' Schleper's previous best World Cup finish was 24th 
in the giant slalom last season at Are, Sweden. She also competed 
at the Nagano Olympics. She closed the season by winning the national 
championship in GS at Jackson, Wyoming, beating since-retired Julie 
Parisien and Caroline Lalive, who finished out of the second run on 
Thursday.
