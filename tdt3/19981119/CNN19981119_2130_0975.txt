The airline industry soon will face stiffer competition on the west 
coast. American airlines is buying the low-fare carrier Reno air for 
$124 million. The deal gives American airlines a stronger presence 
on the west coast, specifically California. The two airlines have

presence on the west coast are united and southwest airlines.
