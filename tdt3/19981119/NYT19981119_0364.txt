Anna Thomson delivers a wrenching portrait of a psychologically disordered 
woman in the new Amos Kollek film, ``Sue.'' As the constant focus 
of this relentless tale of a woman whose life is slipping beyond control, 
Ms. Thomson, with her high cheekbones, sad, down-curving upper lip 
and the ability to appear simultaneously street tough and childishly 
vulnerable, gives a performance that is as easy to admire as it is 
difficult to watch. The screenplay of ``Sue,'' written by the Israeli-born 
Kollek, who is also the film's producer, may not plumb the psychic 
depths necessary to illuminate the dark wellsprings of Sue's personality 
disorder, but it unflinchingly observes the crucial weeks in which 
her desperate life in New York unravels. She cannot pay her rent; 
she drinks heavily, often early in the morning; she cannot sleep, 
and she is too damaged to respond to overtures of friendship and help 
from Linda (Tracee Ross), a young woman working toward a degree in 
psychology, or to love from Ben (Matthew Powers), a journalist she 
meets in a coffee shop. A good-looking, well-educated woman in her 
30s who says she was an office manager for a law firm for a dozen 
years, Sue seems far more comfortable with people like Lola (Tahnee 
Welch), who carries an automatic pistol and robs banks and video stores, 
or with the men who provide her with casual sex after encounters in 
the streets or in a movie theater. Some people, like the woman tending 
her baby carriage in the park Sue frequents, sense something about 
her loneliness, desperation and disorder that makes them flee. When 
Sue, whose only relative appears to be a mother institutionalized 
on the other side of the country with Alzheimer's disease, defines 
herself, she says she has only accidental people in her life. And, 
she observes, ``I only communicate through sex.'' But even though 
Ben responds to her passion with his own, Sue cannot handle their 
relationship in a mature manner, and when he leaves the country for 
a month on an assignment, Sue ratchets further down the ladder of 
her personal hell. ``Sue'' may not be a pretty picture of life in 
New York or a fully rounded psychological case study, but Kollek and 
especially Ms. Thomson paint its details with unsettling truth. PRODUCTION
