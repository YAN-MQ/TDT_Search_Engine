A U.S. military helicopter crashed into the sea Thursday off Sicily, 
the U.S. Navy said. Two crew members were rescued with no injuries 
while the Navy was searching for two missing crewmen, the 6th Fleet 
said. The CH-46 helicopter, deployed aboard the USNS Sirius, went 
down about 30 miles northeast of Augusta Bay, on Sicily's eastern 
coast. It had been bringing supplies to the USS Stump in the central 
Mediterranean. The NAVY said the cause of the incident was under investigation 
and that the names of crew members involved were being withheld pending 
notification of family members.
