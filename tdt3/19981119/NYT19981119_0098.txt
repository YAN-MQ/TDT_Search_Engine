Buffeted by slumping sales on many fronts, Hoechst AG intends to spin 
off Celanese, its big American chemical subsidiary, and another unit 
by issuing new shares to all its stockholders. The company said on 
Tuesday that it would give every stockholder one share in a new company 
made up of Celanese and Ticona, a smaller subsidiary, for every 10 
Hoechst shares. Jurgen Dormann, the company's chairman, said the move 
would give both Hoechst and Celanese more flexibility and advance 
Hoechst's goal of leaving the chemical industry by the end of 2000. 
Few concerns have tried to reinvent themselves more drastically than 
Hoechst. Under Dormann, it has sold billions of dollars worth of chemical 
businesses and tried to rebuild itself as a life sciences company. 
But the transformation has run into disappointments. The pharmaceutical 
business, Hoechst Marion Roussel, is still struggling to bring a new 
generation of drugs to the market, and its most important older drugs 
are losing patent protection. Hoechst executives refused to comment 
on news reports that they might be close to a merger with the French 
drug maker Rhone-Poulenc SA.
