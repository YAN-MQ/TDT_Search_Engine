Before Betty Friedan, before Gloria Steinem, before Kate Millett, 
there was Millicent Carey McIntosh _ a feminist role model for women 
in the 1940s and '50s who wanted to combine family and career. A mother 
of five (including twins), headmistress at the Brearley School and 
then president of Barnard College, she was the first married woman 
to head a Seven Sisters college. In 1951, she was on the cover of 
Newsweek, which proclaimed that at a time when women's education was 
trying to figure out ``whether it should turn out homemakers or Who's 
Whoers _ or both,'' Mrs. McIntosh had ``successfully combined marriage 
and a career for 19 years.'' Mrs. McIntosh is now verging on 100 and 
many more women follow her path today, even as the debate about meshing 
home and career continues. With her centennial birthday approaching 
Nov. 30, students, faculty members, administrators and friends gathered 
Wednesday at Barnard to celebrate this early symbol of women's liberation. 
``She was a president who was ahead of her time,'' Judith Shapiro, 
Barnard's president, said to the audience of about 100, adding that 
Mrs. McIntosh explored ``the struggle of both women and men to find 
their true roles in a changing world.'' Although Mrs. Mac, as she 
is known, is 80 years older than many of today's students, her name 
remains hallowed on campus and students crowded into the McIntosh 
Student Center on Wednesday to pay tribute. ``She came from a different 
era, but the work and family issue is really very important and a 
lot of Barnard students struggle with this today,'' said Leora Hanser, 
president of the student government and another of the featured speakers, 
who pinned a ``Barnard bear'' on Mrs. McIntosh's lapel. Never one 
for unnecessary words, Mrs. McIntosh sat quietly in a wheelchair at 
the front of the student center hall, a small but commanding figure 
in a gray glen-plaid suit and a pink blouse with an ascot, her short 
silver hair softly framing her face. As four speakers rose to praise 
her, she fixed her eyes intently on each, as if to take their measure. 
Again and again she nodded her approval. Although she did not make 
a speech, she greeted a parade of well-wishers, dispensing compliments 
and posing for pictures. It was, she said, ``a wonderful occasion.'' 
She came to Barnard in 1947 when women's colleges were trying to demonstrate 
that women could be educated as rigorously as men. But, as the Newsweek 
article noted, some women were left feeling that college had prepared 
them to be men and that they were on their own in figuring out how 
to be successful women. It was that divide that she crossed so emphatically, 
lacing a curriculum of Latin verbs and English sonnets with doses 
of the practical. At Brearley, for example, where she was headmistress 
from 1930 to '47, she instituted a sex education course for sixth 
graders and taught it herself. When she moved to Barnard, she created 
and taught a required course in ``Modern Living.'' Her influence reached 
well beyond Barnard's walls, for Mrs. McIntosh spoke widely, using 
language that might well have come from some modern-day text written 
by Carol Gilligan, the Harvard psychologist, or Mary Pipher, the author 
of ``Reviving Ophelia.'' In 1950, for example, Mrs. McIntosh told 
students at Sarah Lawrence that motherhood need not be an all-absorbing 
affair and that women make better mothers if they do not spend all 
their time on the physical care of children. She said that when girls 
were with boys, they typically felt it necessary to subordinate their 
own interests or use the ``foolish technique'' of pretending to be 
stupid to be popular. ``We sell our souls into bondage,'' she said. 
``Girls should be conditioned against it. The boys, too, need some 
conditioning for the new world.'' Not all of her feminist views were 
of the 1990s variety. Although she received a doctorate in English 
from Johns Hopkins, she preferred to be referred to as Mrs. rather 
than Dr. _ she said that one doctor in the family was enough (her 
husband, Rustin McIntosh, who died in 1986, was a pediatrician). She 
also advised women that when job and family collided, family should 
take precedence. From her farm in Tyringham, Mass., in the Berkshires, 
where she has lived since leaving Barnard in 1962, Mrs. McIntosh has 
watched the women's movement with interest. She identified herself 
as a comrade in arms in a 1973 article in the Annals of the New York 
Academy of Sciences. ``We're grateful to Women's Liberation for working 
to solve lots of sticky problems that remain, and most of us try to 
help when we can,'' she wrote. ``But we feel that the querulous members 
of the movement have failed to recognize one basic fact about women: 
provided that they are willing and able to work hard, with self-discipline, 
they can do anything they REALLY Want to.''
