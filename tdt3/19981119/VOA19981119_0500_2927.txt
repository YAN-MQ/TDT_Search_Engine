It's now time for the latest business news. Here's Paul Westfielding 
with the latest news from the markets in Europe. PAUL WESTFIELDING, 
VOA NEWS now, And they are good. They are all good. The DAX-30 is 
up 53 points. CAC-40 in Paris up 43. FTSE is up 21. The Zurich Swiss 
Market Index is up 69. This follows kind of a bad day on the Asian 
financial markets. But nevertheless, Europe seems to be following 
Wall Street's lead yesterday when the Dow Industrial Average was up 
quite a bit. We'll get to those numbers in just a minute. Tokyo's 
stocks -- Tokyo prices finished lower Thursday -- dragged down by 
a case of the ho- hums, the blahs, if you will -- the lack of incentives 
to buy. One analyst said things were basically in a wait-and-see mode. 
The Nikkei Index of 225 selected stocks dropping 245 points, more 
than wiping out all of the gains made Wednesday. And the investors 
appear to be waiting for what happens during talks between the ruling 
liberal democratic party and the oposition liberal party on forming 
an alliance and a diet which could determine the future of the government's 
fiscal stimulus package. In Hong Kong, the hang seng index gained 
100 points, while in other Asian markets, prices were lower in Wellington 
and Manila, but in Tai Bay share prices were sharply higher with a 
lot of interest in the technology sector. Stock prices in the United 
States, as I mentioned, were up Wednesday as traders and investors 
continued to assess the impact of Tuesday's interest rate cuts. The 
Dow Jones Industrial Averaged closed up 40 -- 54 points -- 54 points 
to 9,041. The S&P 500 was up 5 points. It closed down at the day 11,044.
