This is VOA News Now, and we're coming to you from Washington. I'm 
Les Carpenter, along with Charlene Porter. And at 10 hours, 18, universal 
time, the top story we are following comes from Japan where President 
Clinton has paid a courtesy call on Emperor Hakihito and held a televised 
town hall meeting with the people of Japan. Later with Japanese officials, 
he'll focus on economic and security issues. We'll have further details 
on that story about 12 minutes from now. Right now, it's time to check 
in on the latest in sports. And for an update, we hear from Steve 
Shai. Steve.
