In Australia, a sporting competition for children is sparking a knock-down, 
drag-out fight among adults. Denise Dillon has the story. Re orter: 
yes, these are children, 10-year-old girls, landing real punches. 
Young boys and girls donning boxing gloves hn Australia is causing 
a battle outside the ring. Competitive boxing can only offer children 
permanent physical damage. Doctors and politicians are calling for 
a ban on underage boxing matches. You child's potential in life could 
be suppressed to a significant degree and maybe even your child's 
libe is in threat. Even champion boxer Jeff fenech has reservatiobs 
about children climbing into the ring. I have a daughter myself and 
I'd be a bit apprehensive if she wanted to box. But organizers say 
people are making too much of this. It's nothing more than child's 
play. It's stupid, actually, because you don't get hurt. Still oppondnts 
vow to knock out the junior bouts. Denise Dillon, "CNN Headline News."
