President Clinton is thousands of miles from today's hearing, on a 
five-day visit to Asia. He is trying to keep his appearances in Japan 
focused on the region's economic crisis. Today, he urged the country 
not to be discouraged by hard times, and instead, seek recovery by 
opening markets to American-made goods. But at a town hall meeting, 
he did face one question about the Monica lewinsky matter. I have 
a question regarding Ms. Monica Lewinsky. How did you apologize to 
Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea? And I -- I would never be able to forgive 
my husband. And did they really forgive you, Mr. president? Well, 
I did it in a direct and straightforward manner, and I believe they 
did, yes. But that's really a question you could ask them, better 
than me. President Clinton will leave Japan tomorrow and head to south 
Korea. Talks there should be dominated by issues concerning north 
Korea.
