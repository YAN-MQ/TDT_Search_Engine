Israel's cabinet has approved the first stage of Israeli troop withdrawal 
from part of the West Bank. Seven cabinet members voted in favor of 
the withdrawal. Five voted against the measure and three did not vote. 
The pullout is expected to be finished by tomorrow. The move comes 
after the Palestinians met three conditions of the wye peace accord. 
They issued decrees outlawing incitement to violence and illegal weapons. 
And they provided a list of ten terrorism suspects who will be arrested.
