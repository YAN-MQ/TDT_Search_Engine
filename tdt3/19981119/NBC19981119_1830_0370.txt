As for the president and first lady, they are both far from Washington 
tonight. Claire Shipman is can the president in Tokyo, Claire? Tom, 
we're told the president only watched a brief clip of the news hearings 
today. But his advisers were quick to claim victory. "All we had to 
do to win was to remain standing in this round," said one, "And we 
did." Bill Clinton, publicly focused on the Japanese economy, couldn't 
avoid the subject completely, even in a friendly Japanese audience, 
where a housewife asked him how he'd told his family about Lewinsky 
and whether they had forgiven him. I did it in a direct and straightforward 
manner, and I believe they did, yes. But that's really a question 
you could ask them better than me. The first lady, also out of the 
country in Latin America, did not escape the reach of the hearings 
either, though she pointedly tried to ignore them. Mrs. Clinton, good 
morning. Do you have any interest in hearing what Ken Starr has to 
say this morning? Have you all looked around and been able to see 
all the archaeological finds and everything? There's a wonderful candle 
shop. Makes beautiful candles! As the president continues his travels 
to Korea, his team is already focused on how to handle the upcoming 
depositions of confidant bruce Lindsey, and private attorney Bob Bennett. 
Sources say the White House may well advise Bennett at least not to 
answer all the questions, betting the public will understand. tom? 
Thanks, very much. Claire Shipman where it's a new day in Tokyo.
