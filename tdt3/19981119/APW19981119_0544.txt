Police cracked a counterfeiting ring Thursday, arresting two brothers 
and seizing bogus bills with a face value of U.S. dlrs 17.3 million 
in what officials called the biggest such raid in Taiwan's history. 
Officers swooped down on a house in an industrial section of Tainan 
County, 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Taipei, following a four-month 
surveillance operation. They seized fake U.S. dlrs 100 bills with 
a face value of dlrs 10 million, and counterfeit Chinese yuan bills 
with a face value equal to U.S. dlrs 7.3 million, along with printing 
presses and plates. Peng Tah-hung and Peng Tah-hsuan were arrested 
on the scene, and after questioning, they admitted to printing the 
forged bills, police said. The Pengs planned to convert the fake bills 
into real currency by buying contraband in China for resale in Taiwan, 
said Lin Kuo-tung, deputy director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau. 
``They would take them to the mainland, buy drugs and guns to smuggle 
back to Taiwan and by selling these, convert the counterfeits into 
real currency,'' Lin told reporters. Lin said the dollar amount of 
the bust was the largest ever by Taiwanese police. Police were unable 
to provide numbers for the previous record raid, but they said Thursday's 
seizure far exceeded anything they had seen before. Officials in the 
Criminal Investigation Bureau's counterfeit division said no previous 
raid had ever netted as much as U.S. dlrs 10 million in fake greenbacks, 
while all previous seizures of fake Chinese yuan had been U.S. dlrs 
5 million or less. Police said the forged currency appeared to be 
of poor quality. They were investigating whether any was being circulated 
in Taiwan. Chinese police had also been alerted to the Pengs' activities, 
Lin said.
