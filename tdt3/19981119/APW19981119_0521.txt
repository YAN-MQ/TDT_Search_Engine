A ride on the London underground beats out Paris and New York, but 
a new report Thursday showed that the best ride in the four major 
cities studied is on the Tokyo subway. The Four World Cities Transport 
Study report by the London Research Centre which was released in Paris 
compared the public transport systems in Tokyo, New York, London and 
Paris. The report's compound index of service quality that assesses 
frequency and punctuality found Tokyo on top, followed by London, 
New York and Paris. The report showed that Tokyo was the only system 
to offer consistently excellent service on all trains, with a perfect 
100 percent record for punctuality during peak hours. But Tokyo passengers 
must put up with terrible overcrowding during peak hours and are sometimes 
physically shoved into their train by rail staff. The incentive to 
use public transport in Tokyo is great because 86 percent of Japanese 
companies pay the full travel costs of their employees, the report 
said. Measures have been taken recently to lengthen trains and platforms 
as well as open doors. Residents in London have good access to public 
transport, and buses and trains run frequently with good off-peak 
service. The majority of Greater London residents live or work within 
five minutes of an underground stop. But London is second to New York 
in poor punctuality and the worst waits for bus service. London recently 
has taken measures to improve bus service, but still just like Paris 
65 percent of all journeys in Greater London are by car or motorcyle. 
The report noted, however, that the London system is in need of renovation 
and modernization because of its age and ought to work on improving 
Sunday bus service. Paris has the densest metro network but even though 
trains run frequently at rush hour, the system is often hit by strikes. 
Even though it offers the cheapest travel, 65 percent of all journeys 
in Paris are by car or motorcycle. The New York subway system is the 
commuter's virtual dream, operating 24 hours a day in addition to 
bus routes. Metropolitan New York has an even greater density than 
Paris and the most number of journeys per day. But New Yorkers have 
to wait, and the city has the worst punctuality record of the four 
cities surveyed. And the cost of using the system surpasses even Tokyo, 
making New York the most expensive city for public transport travel.
