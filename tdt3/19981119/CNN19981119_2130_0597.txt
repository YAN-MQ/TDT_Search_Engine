Tanks that store fuel or other chemicals are often located close to 
waterways. Operators of those tanks may now have an additional method 
to detect any seepage. Ann Kellan has more in this edition of "tech 
trends." Back up, please. a robot called maverick, that looks like 
a suitcase on steroids, could be a new and cheaper way to protect 
against an environmental threat. Around the world, billions of gallons 
of gasoline, jet fuel and chemicals are stored in huge tanks. If those 
tanks leak, poisonous chemicals could seep into the ground water. 
We're concerned about corrosion on the tank bottom, the condition 
of the internal welds of the tank joining the plates together, as 
well as any corrosion on the tank walls. Inspecting a tank is a high 
priority, but a tedious and expensive job that takes it out of service. 
You have to clean it, you have to drain it, you have to take all the 
sludges out of it, that's gonna cost anywhere between $30,000 to $500,000. 
Maverick's makers say the robot can change all that. We're looking 
at an 80% or more savings over the cost of taking a tank out of service. 
The robot is lowered into a full tank and works its way methodically 
along the floor, controlled remotely from the outside. Here's what 
it looks like in an underwater test. It uses ultrasound to measure 
the thickness of the metal. There are ten ultrasonic transducers in 
an array that gives us ultimately a Three-dimensional picture of the 
entire floor area. a sonar positioning system keeps track of the robot's 
location, so any thin spots in the metal floor can be found and fixed. 
Solex says besides saving money for tank owners, the system benefits 
the environment because fuels, chemicals and their fumes stay safely 
inside the tanks, while workers can stay out of them. Ann Kellan,
