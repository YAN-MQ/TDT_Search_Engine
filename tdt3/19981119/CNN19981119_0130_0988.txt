Stocks in the $20 billion a year natural foods industry have taken 
a Beating in the past few months. But some analysts say they're poised 
for a healthy comeback. Charles Molineaux reports. Far from the wheat 
fields and harvests, natural food retailers such as whole foods, wild 
oats and general nutrition centers are seeking recognition from the 
financial world. At the natural products financial conference in New 
York, industry representatives predict a healthier future after a 
rough 1998. As long as we're delivering results for the shareholders, 
they appreciate the core values and the social mission, but the core 
values and social mission don't carry us if we're not delivering a 
return on the investment. Last year, stocks in the nation's Montgomery 
natural business average rose 44%. But like all smaller issues, they 
were pummelled in the market's summer sell-off and are still off 31% 
year to date. Now natural foods watchers say they're poised for a 
recovery. Sales have grown 20% a year for the past five years, Buoyed 
by improved selection and growing interest from an ever-broader customer 
base. Our customers have also gotten more sophisticated and more conscious 
and more demanding. And you just can't get away with "terrible tasting 
but it's natural" kind of products. That interest has caught the attention 
of major retailers. Analysts say it won't be long before giants like 
Safeway, Kroger or even wal-Mart start gobbling up natural food retailers. 
There's tremendous consolidation in food retailing right now that's 
ongoing in this country. One of the fastest growing areas of food 
retailing has been natural. Another area has been gourmet. There are 
going to be acquisitions made by the big food retailers in those areas, 
and it's just a matter of when, not if. And analysts say the naturals' 
stock prices are still suffering from the same malaise surrounding 
all small caps, which means their share valuations are compelling, 
and they could be ready for a healthy comeback among the small stock.
