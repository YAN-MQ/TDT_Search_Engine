That's "Dollars & Sense." Catherine, back to you. Thanks, Valerie. 
"CNN Headline Sports" is next. If you could accompany your data on 
its trip overseas the experience would be alarming. Local carriers 
handing it to national carriers over to cable carriers... till you 
don't know who has your data. Unless you send it through here. With 
the one and only company that owns the entire network-- local, national, 
and international. So you know who has your data. On-net. From MCI 
Worldcom. It's Sammy or big Mac. I'm Anthony Keith James, and this 
is "CNN Headline Sports."
