Fans of advertising slogans that develop into catch phrases and enter 
the vernacular can gratefully start saying ``Thank you Paine Webber'' 
again. The reason? Paine Webber Group Inc. is bringing back that familiar 
theme after an 11-year hiatus. The New York office of Saatchi &AMP; 
Saatchi, the longtime Paine Webber agency, is reviving the gratitude 
attitude in a television and print campaign that begins this week, 
promoting what Paine Webber describes as its strong heritage of customized 
investment advice. Plans call for a budget of more than $20 million, 
the largest in the 119-year history of Paine Webber. The comeback 
for the well-known phrase is emblematic of the efforts being made 
by investment firms to attract the attention of consumers in an increasingly 
crowded and competitive category. That task is complicated by the 
recent rapid fluctuations in the stock market, which have left many 
Americans feeling less like bulls or bears and more, perhaps, like 
chickens. ``People seek customized advice when they're anxious about 
their money,'' said Marten Hoekstra, executive vice president and 
marketing director for the Paine Webber Private Client Group in New 
York, the firm's retail business. ``Our ads have been in the works 
since late spring,'' he added, ``and neither the strategy nor the 
execution has been changed.'' The return of ``Thank you Paine Webber,'' 
which replaces a campaign called ``Invest with more intelligence,'' 
comes as two other Wall Street firms, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and 
John Nuveen &AMP; Co., are changing agencies. At the same time, financial 
service marketers like Fidelity Investments are stepping up their 
advertising. ``There was never a request from Paine Webber to just 
bring back `Thank you,' '' said Craig Miller, executive vice president 
and executive creative director at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi. ``It had 
to mean something _ and this time, it's about the advice.'' The initial 
run of ``Thank you,'' from 1975 to 1987, was ``focused on `Thank you 
for the success, the material rewards,' '' said Miller, an art director 
who worked on the campaign with Doug Pippin, a creative director and 
copywriter. ``This is not the time for that,'' Miller said, ``because 
customers now are more sophisticated,'' wanting to save for college 
tuition or comfortable retirement rather than wine cellars or yachts. 
The stock market turmoil in the fall of 1987 led Paine Webber and 
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi to replace ``Thank you'' with ads labeled ``Special 
reports,'' in a straightforward, news-style format. ``As far as investments 
went at that point,'' Hoekstra said, ``people weren't thankful in 
general, much less to Paine Webber.'' ``Even though our strategists 
did a good job when the crash came,'' he added, ``we didn't feel the 
`Thank you' tag line fit.'' The next theme, ``We invest in relationships,'' 
was introduced in 1990, followed by ``Invest with more intelligence'' 
in 1995. The decision to refocus on investment advice is underlined 
in the commercials as the words ``for the advice'' are superimposed 
along with ``Thank you Paine Webber.'' Four spots, to run on broadcast 
and cable networks, show groups of people in everyday settings _ at 
a children's soccer game, in an airport, aboard a train, riding bicycles 
on a country road _ who are pondering investment options. Through 
interior monologues, viewers hear a cacophony of conflicting opinions 
until the end of each commercial, when a satisfied Paine Webber client 
is heard thinking ``Thank you Paine Webber'' with a calm smile on 
his or her face. ``The abundant supply of excellent financial information, 
rather than leading people to feel more confident, has led to a higher 
level of confusion,'' Hoekstra said. ``That gives customized advice 
unique value.'' The commercials offer some humorous touches atypical 
for a Wall Street pitch. In the airport spot, a youngster playing 
a video game is heard thinking ``My portfolio should be invested in 
game companies.'' In the cycling spot, a farmer watching the riders 
is heard thinking ``Titanium bikes are overrated.'' In the soccer 
spot, a dog is heard thinking: ``Did that kid just drop a pretzel? 
I like pretzels. I really like pretzels!'' And in the train spot, 
a man with a portable stereo is heard listening to ``For the Love 
of Money'' by the O'Jays. The print ads, in magazines and newspapers, 
take a different tack because the interior monologue device would 
be difficult to illustrate short of placing cartoon-like thought balloons 
over investors' heads. Each print ad begins with a nugget of conventional 
wisdom such as ``They say retirement means the end of your working 
years.'' Then comes advice from Paine Webber under the headline ``We 
say.'' Each ad ends by asserting ``You'll say `Thank you Paine Webber.''' 
Now that ``Thank you Paine Webber'' is here again, how long before 
someone finds a way to bring back ``My broker is E.F. Hutton. And 
E.F. Hutton says . . .''?
