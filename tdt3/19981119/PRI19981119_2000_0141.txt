Israeli officials say some 250 Palestinian prisoners will be freed 
tomorrow at noon as part of a new peace agreement worked out in the 
United States earlier this year. A spokesman says the group will include 
those convicted of crimes along with political detainees. Palestinian 
officials had wanted all 250 to be political prisoners.
