It's Sosa over McGwire. I'm Anthony Keith James, and this is "CNN 
Headline Sports." Sammy Sosa today was named the national league's 
most valuable player. The cubs slugger who finished second to McGwire 
with 66 homers got 30 of 32 first-place votes. Last season, Sosa hit 
.308 with a major league-leading 158 rbi, helping chicago reach the 
postseason for the first time since 1989.
