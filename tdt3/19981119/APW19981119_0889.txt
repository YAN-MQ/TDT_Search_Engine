A Belarusian city is issuing ration cards for food staples, long lines 
are forming everywhere to buy sugar and other basic goods and officials 
said Thursday that inflation exceeded 85 percent so far this year. 
But Belarus' autocratic President Alexander Lukashenko insisted Thursday 
that food shortages in this former Soviet republic don't amount to 
a ``crisis.'' Still, as he addressed an emergency task force charged 
with sweeping control over the economy, Lukashenko ordered that the 
troubles be resolved fast. He dispatched officials to make sure Belarus 
has ``everything to supply our people with food, clothes, and so on.'' 
He did not say where the government was expected to find resources 
to do that, but he banned officials from dipping into Belarus' emergency 
food supply. Belarus still has a Soviet-style economy, as Lukashenko 
has blocked most serious reforms. The country was rocked by an economic 
crisis this spring, with a dramatic slump in its currency prompting 
the government to order strict price controls. That led to a boom 
in exports and to frequent shortages of staple goods, including meat 
and dairy products, within Belarus. In the western city of Ostovets, 
ration cards have been introduced for sugar and butter, the independent 
daily Naviny reported. Authorities in the northwestern city of Novopolotsk 
have ordered grocery stores to sell food only to customers who prove 
they are local residents, Naviny said. In a small town in the western 
Brest region where ration cards have not been introduced, a store 
assistant refused to sell more than one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of sugar 
to an elderly woman, even after she stood in line for a second time 
to get a second bag. The woman sued, but court ruled in favor of the 
store, Belarusian state radio reported Thursday. Vodka-lovers have 
been hit, too. The price of a half-liter (pint) bottle of Belarusian 
vodka shot up from 90,000 (just under 1 dollar at the official exchange 
rate) Wednesday to about 170,000 (about dlrs 1.80) Thursday. Lines 
snaked around liquor stores and kiosks Wednesday after the price hike 
was announced. Also Thursday, a senior Economics Ministry official 
said inflation in the first 10 months of the year was 85.1 percent. 
Lukashenko, meanwhile, insisted: ``There is no catastrophe in Belarus, 
no collapse, no crisis in provisions for the populace.''
