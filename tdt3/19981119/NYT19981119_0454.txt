A 12-year-old student at the Paris Opera Ballet school fears that 
her idol, the company's star, will be replaced by a Russian ballerina, 
and she causes an accident that ends the visiting rival's performing 
career. This brief synopsis carries only a hint of the magic and depth 
of ``La Mort du Cygne,'' the legendary 1937 film starring Yvette Chauvire 
(then 20 years old), Janine Charrat (then 12) and Mia Slavenska (then 
23), which the French Institute/Alliance Francaise has made the centerpiece 
of a blockbuster screening of French dance films. The series begins 
on Sunday. Living legends will be on hand. Ms. Chauvire, who gave 
her farewell performance at the Paris Opera Ballet in 1972, is one 
of France's greatest ballerinas, and Ms. Charrat, one of the most 
interesting French choreographers, was a leading dancer in the 1940s 
and '50s. Both will join a panel moderated by the critic Robert Greskovic 
at 8 p.m. on Monday between two screenings of ``La Mort du Cygne,'' 
at 6:30 and 9 p.m. at Florence Gould Hall. Ms. Slavenska, the Yugoslav-American 
ballerina who starred in the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and later 
in her own Slavenska-Franklin Ballet, will participate by conference 
call from Los Angeles, where she teaches. Jean Benoit-Levy, the film's 
director, was already known in the United States when ``Cygne'' was 
released here in 1938 under the title ``Ballerina.'' American critics 
raved about the film, recognizing its exquisite quality from the start. 
Rightly ignoring its surface sentimentality, they were clearly unnerved 
and impressed by Benoit-Levy's psychological insight into childhood 
innocence gone awry. Today the film is priceless in its haunting evocation 
of the Paris Opera on the eve of World War II. This is the ballet 
troupe of Serge Lifar, whose choreography dominates the performance 
scenes. The title ballet, not to be confused with Fokine's famous 
solo ``The Dying Swan,'' looks downright silly, but elsewhere Lifar's 
choreography is firmly grounded in the classical idiom. Lifar and 
Paul Morand, whose novella inspired the script, would run into trouble 
after World War II for their association with the Germans. Benoit-Levy, 
very much in the other camp, took refuge during the war in New York, 
where he helped found a French university in exile. Fear of war hangs 
over the film; Ms. Charrat even worries that Ms. Slavenska's character, 
Nathalie Karine, is an alien agent sent to France to help start a 
war. Karine is a foreigner, as noted by everyone from Mlle. Beaupre, 
the ballerina portrayed by Ms. Chauvire, to the ballet school director. 
Xenophobia reigns in a theater once dominated by Italians, but tradition 
reigns, too. Child pupils are called ``little rats,'' and the heroine's 
name, used with a straight face, is Rose Souris (Rose Mouse). Class 
distinctions abound. Rich admirers in white ties still court ballerinas 
like Mlle. Beaupre in Degas' Foyer de la Danse. By contrast, the children 
come from modest homes. Madame Souris, a dressmaker, cannot understand 
why her daughter wants to dance. ``What is there besides dance?'' 
Rose asks in shock when her idol, Mlle. Beaupre, prefers marriage. 
To say that Rose has unintentionally committed a crime for nothing 
would be to see ``Cygne'' as melodrama. In its surprise ending, related 
to the unexpected bond between the disabled rival and the child, the 
film becomes instead testimony to the power of dance as art. Ms. Charrat, 
as a child performer, and the two ballerinas are extraordinary. No 
wonder the film inspired an American remake, ``The Unfinished Dance,'' 
in 1947 with the pigtailed Margaret O'Brien. The series begins earlier 
with two documentaries by the French filmmaker Dominique Delouche. 
On Sunday, Delouche and Ms. Chauvire will present ``Yvette Chauvire: 
A Star for Example'' (1988) which gives a more contemporary view of 
the great ballerina's style and coaching (4:30 p.m.). ``Serge Peretti, 
the Last Italian'' (1998), the other film, is a revealing look at 
the last male star at the Paris Opera Ballet to embody a true mix 
of Italian and French training (6:30 p.m.). As a bonus, Patrick Bensard, 
director of the dance cinematheque in Paris, will present archival 
films at the Tinker Auditorium of the French Institute (Sunday, 9 
p.m.; Monday at 9:30 p.m.). Admission at Florence Gould Hall (55 E. 
59th St.) is $8 and at Tinker Auditorium (22 E. 60th St., Manhattan), 
$5. Information: (212) 355-6100.
