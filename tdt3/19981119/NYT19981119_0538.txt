The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 20: Of all 
the economic events of the 1990s, the decline of Japan's financial 
colossus was perhaps the least expected. A decade ago the Japanese 
appeared to be in command of the most successful economy in the world. 
Now, as President Clinton concludes his Tokyo visit, it is hard to 
be optimistic about the financial condition and future of the world's 
second-largest economy. Japan has recently done much better at announcing 
economic repair plans than putting them into effect. The government's 
$195 billion economic stimulus package _ including money that is to 
be given to people on condition that it be spent, not saved _ got 
a tepid reception in part because of doubts about details and whether 
the government will follow through on its promises. Even if it does, 
more is likely to be needed. Structural reforms must be made to promote 
competition, and Japan's banking mess must be dealt with. Japan continues 
to run big trade surpluses, and is a very rich economy. But wealth 
has not kept it out of a severe recession. Savings are high and consumer 
spending is low. Many of the problems stem from the bubble economy 
of the late 1980s, when stock and real estate prices soared beyond 
all reason. The collapse left Japanese financial institutions mired 
in bad debts that were long ignored. Although the government has set 
aside money for bank bailouts _ and two major banks said on Thursday 
they would need more than $7 billion _ little has so far been accomplished. 
Japanese banks are reluctant to lend money except to the safest borrowers, 
producing a lethal combination of credit crunch and recession. To 
be fair, Japan faces a difficult task in dealing with its banking 
system. The problem was caused by banks that lent too willingly. But 
the country's economic problems now are being exacerbated by the opposite 
problem as banks refuse to lend. Japan must close banks that are insolvent, 
while providing additional capital to other banks to enable them to 
lend money to creditworthy companies. Unfortunately, the Japanese 
government has yet to show it can accomplish that delicate balancing 
act. Some economists argue that Japan is now in a liquidity trap, 
in which worried consumers hoard rather than spend any increase in 
the money supply. They say Japan must adopt a policy of promoting 
inflation so that consumers spend for fear that the yen they save 
will be worth less next year. Such dire forecasts may be right, but 
it is also possible that bold action would make a difference. It is 
encouraging that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, as part of a deal to 
bring an opposition party into his government, agreed to consider 
tax cuts. It would also be wise for Japan to reduce its resistance 
to imports. An Asia-Pacific trade liberalization plan was scuttled 
by Japan's refusal to lower tariffs on fish and forest products. Such 
protection is one of the factors depressing domestic demand and slowing 
Japan's economy. As Clinton said, ``Nothing is more important to restore 
growth in Asia than efforts to restart Japan's economy,''
