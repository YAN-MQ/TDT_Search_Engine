An epilogue today to the most memorable baseball season in years. 
This time, Sammy Sosa won. Sosa was named by the baseball writers 
as the national league's most valuable player today. Mark McGwire 
came in second. McGwire edged out Sosa in the home run race, 70-66. 
But Sosa's Chicago cubs made the playoffs, McGwire's Cardinals did 
not.
