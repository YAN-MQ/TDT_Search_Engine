Chief U.N. Weapons Inspector Richard Butler says he has asked Iraq 
to tell the truth about its biological weapons. Mr. Butler said he 
sent a letter to Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz saying Iraq 
holds the responsibility to be honest about its weapons of mass destruction. 
Mr. Butler also spoke on U.S. television where he said Iraq's responsibility 
also extends to the use of such weapons throughout the countries. 
Beyond the intrinsic Iraq case of what, you know, wicked substances 
or weapons of mass destruction they may have, they also represent 
the major test case of the world's ability overall to restrain the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. U.N. weapons inspectors 
have returned to work after a two-week absence in Iraq.
