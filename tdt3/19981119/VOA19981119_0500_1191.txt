Football's world governing body FEFA has changed the dates of the 
confederation's cup in Mexico because of the problems involved in 
releasing professional players for some of the competing teams. Originally 
set up for mid-January, the special 18 tournament is now scheduled 
for July 28th to August 8th. FEFA's executive committee must ratify 
the change at its meeting in early December. Last month's draw for 
the turning toward Egypt, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia and host Mexico in 
group A. They'll play in Mexico City in the preliminary round. Group 
B matches in Guadalahara will feature world-cup champion France, the 
United States, Brazil and New Zealand.
