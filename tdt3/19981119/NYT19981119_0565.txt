Several public schools here degenerated into chaos Thursday morning 
when teachers went on strike, leaving the district's 32,000 students 
in the hands of principals and too few substitute teachers. Classes 
at all five of the city's high schools were canceled by midmorning, 
when students began hurling bottles and bricks, turning over desks 
and computers, pulling fire alarms and even assaulting each other 
and some substitute teachers. About 200 police officers were called 
to the schools; they said they arrested eight students. In a few cases, 
the trouble spilled over into the surrounding neighborhoods, when 
students vandalized some businesses. ``They were vandalizing store 
by store,'' said Nacha Messina, 23, the manager of a McDonald's near 
a high school. She said employees cowered at the rear of the kitchen 
while students threw the plants in the restaurant, emptied change 
out of a container on the counter for charity collections and tried 
to rip out one of the registers. At the district's grammar schools, 
students were dismissed at 12:45 p.m. The district had hired fewer 
than 200 substitute teachers to cover for the 2,500 teachers represented 
by the union, the Jersey City Education Association, which decided 
to go on strike after talks with the district over a new three-year 
contract broke down Thursday at 1:30 a.m., at the end of a 10-hour 
negotiating session. ``Absolutely there were too few substitutes,'' 
said JoAnn Kenny, executive assistant to schools Superintendent Richard 
DiPatri. ``There was chaos. It was a tough day.'' Judge Martin Greenberg 
of Hudson County Superior Court issued a temporary restraining order 
Thursday afternoon ordering the teachers back to work on Friday. But 
district officials will have to serve every one of the union members 
with legal notices ordering them back to work, so they do not expect 
all of them to return to their classrooms. Because of the possible 
delay, district officials decided late Thursday to cancel classes 
at city high schools and to maintain a shortened day at the elementary 
schools. Ms. Kenny said the district would redeploy its substitute 
teachers on Friday to make better use of them in an effort to avoid 
some of the problems of Thursday. The trouble started within the schools, 
and not on the picket lines manned by the striking teachers. At several 
of the high schools, principals corralled the students into auditoriums 
and gymnasiums when the day began and they realized they did not have 
enough teachers for most classes. When students grew restless at being 
confined for so long, many of them began fighting and throwing things. 
Teachers and other union representatives blamed the district, the 
second largest in the state, for not planning better for a strike 
that union members had authorized several weeks earlier. ``He should 
never have opened the schools,'' Thomas Favia, the union president, 
said of DiPatri. Teachers and students throughout the city reported 
problems. ``I won't lie to you,'' said Althea Benthall, 13, who is 
in the seventh grade at Public School 12. ``I was wild. I opened the 
windows. I was saying `hi' to my teachers down on the sidewalk. The 
substitute teacher would grab us and he'd try to close the windows.'' 
Other students were throwing wet toilet paper out the windows and 
screaming. Some parents came and pulled their children out of school 
early. Others let their children remain in school, but said they did 
not approve of the strike. ``They should be negotiating after school,'' 
said Omari Abraham, who came to get his 6-year-old daughter when school 
ended at 12:45. ``I see signs the teachers are carrying talking about 
dignity. What about dignity for the students?'' Police officials said 
that the students who were arrested faced charges varying from criminal 
mischief to failure to disperse.
