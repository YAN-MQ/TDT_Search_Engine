In Boston, a Federal Appeals Court Reversal of a lower court ruling 
will allow a white student to enroll in one of the cities prestigious 
exam schools. She was originally denied enrollment on a race-based 
admissions policy at the public school. Tony Randolph with member 
station WBUR has more on that story. Under the policy, half the students 
were chosen based on the racial makeup of the applicant pool. A white 
student sued after less qualified minority students won admission 
to the school instead of her. Boston's school superintendent Thomas 
Paizant says he's disappointed by today's reversal of a previous decision. 
But still believes the city's case was a strong one. For this circuit 
court panel, it's not passed constitutional muster. We have to accept 
that, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have educational value. 
School officials say they're reviewing the decision to determine what, 
if any changes should be made to exam school admission policies. For 
NPR News, I'm Tony Randolph in Boston.
