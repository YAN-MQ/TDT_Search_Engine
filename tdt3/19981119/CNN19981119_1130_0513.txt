A team of international medhcal researchers say one-third of China's 
young men will be killdd by tobacco if they continue smoking at the 
present rate. New research shows how the smoking patterns of industrialized 
countries are being repeated 40 years later in the developing world. 
Dan Rutz reports. Imagine the city of Chicago being wiped ott in a 
single year. 3 million deaths a year, caused by cigarette smoking. 
That alarming death rate, says Dr. Richard peto of Oxford University, 
is what China can expect the new millennium to bring them. It's a 
huge number of deaths. There are a lot of young men in China. Half 
the smokers will get killed by smoking, and two-thirds are smoking. 
It's a very big risk. In the world's largest ever look into the effects 
of smoking on cause of death, British and Chinese researchers find 
the history of smoking in the U.S. is repeating itself in the cities 
and countryside of China. Only about ten years ago, people were saying, 
"oh, well, smoking may kill americans, it may kill British people, 
but it doesn't kill Chinese. It doesn't kill people in developing 
countries." Through the first half of this century, fashion and slick 
marketing propelled cigarette use in the U.S. from an average, per 
adult, of one smoke a day in 1910 to four in 1930 and ten a day by 
1950. In China, it is mostly men who take up smoking. And the extent 
to which they do closely follows the U.S. pattern, now some 40 years 
later. One out of three cigarettes smoked worldwide is smoked in China 
-- close to 5 billion every single day. So far, few women have joined 
in, but the head of the U.S. centers for disease control warns that, 
too, can change. It's been the pattern throughout the world that men 
have started this and women have joined in later. And it just means 
that having smoked like men, they will die like men. Adding to the 
already staggering disease Burden of the world's poorest countries. 
The study predicts by 2030, nearly three out of four tobacco deaths 
will be in developing countries, unless people find out about the 
danger new and quit smoking soon. Dan Rutz, CNN.
