A team owner spurned at home and an eager governor next door shook 
hands Thursday, promising the National Football League's New England 
Patriots a new home in downtown Hartford and infusing Connecticut's 
blighted capital with big-league cachet. Gov. John Rowland agreed 
to build a $350 million stadium for the Patriots' owner, Robert Kraft, 
who said he felt the Massachusetts Legislature had been too stingy 
with him. The deal has been under way behind the scenes for months 
but arrived with almost no public prelude, adding to the sense of 
unreality among Hartford officials, who have sought and lost so many 
smaller projects. About 200 of Hartford's business and government 
leaders packed into the stained-glass splendor of a ceremonial hall 
at the Connecticut Capitol, applauding their coup with a sustained 
rhythm that sounded like rowdy fans when their team is first-and-goal. 
``I can't tell you what it means to me to get that kind of warm reception 
from a community,'' Kraft said, in a pointed reference to political 
battles in Boston as he tried and failed to win a huge state subsidy 
for a new stadium near the Patriots' current home in Foxboro, Mass. 
That stadium, built 27 years ago, is considered to be inaccessible 
and unattractive and lacks many of the amenities of a modern park. 
On Thursday, Kraft joked that he drove from Boston to Hartford in 
the same time it took him to get out of the parking lot at Foxboro 
Stadium. And later, he apologized for choking up as the crowd erupted 
in yet another wave of cheers. ``You really overwhelmed me,'' he said. 
The deal _ which would be financed by bonds and paid off through stadium 
revenues _ must be approved by the Connecticut Legislature. But leaders 
of both houses took the podium Thursday to promise quick passage. 
As part of the 30-page agreement, Kraft agreed not to negotiate with 
any other state between now and Dec. 31. Kraft was required to deposit 
$2 million in escrow, which he would forfeit if he began negotiations 
with another state. Rowland, who has failed to close several other 
major deals he has championed publicly, said he insisted on the escrow 
payment and exclusive negotiating window in an effort to avoid being 
used as leverage in Kraft's negotiations with Massachusetts lawmakers. 
Acting Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts said he spoke with 
Kraft late Wednesday night, and said he did not see any way to prevent 
the move. ``I believe the Patriots belong in Massachusetts,'' Cellucci 
said in an interview in New Orleans, where he is attending the Republican 
Governors Association meeting. ``However, there was a difference of 
opinion in the Legislature on this point, and it appears that that 
difference is insurmountable.'' The 68,000-seat stadium will be part 
of a $1 billion development on the Connecticut River that is to include 
a convention center, a hotel and sports stores. The site is now home 
to parking lots, blocky buildings, a steam plant and a dike that blocks 
the city's view of the river. The team, which has played in the Boston 
area since 1960, is scheduled to move to Hartford in the fall of 2001, 
and Kraft has committed to staying for 30 years. The stadium is to 
include 125 to 150 luxury boxes and 6,000 club seats, and is envisioned 
as the centerpiece of Adrien's Landing, a redevelopment project that 
was already planned near the intersection of Interstates 84 and 91. 
The complex was to include a 35,000-seat stadium for the University 
of Connecticut. Under the deal announced Thursday, UConn will play 
in the proposed stadium. Rowland billed Kraft as ``a partner'' in 
Hartford's renewal. Under the agreement, the Patriots are to invest 
$75 million in downtown, including $50 million for a hotel for the 
convention center, $20 million for a retail and entertainment pavilion 
and $5 million for a fitness center. The team will move its headquarters 
to Connecticut and, within one year of the stadium's opening, will 
move its practice field to Connecticut. Mayor Michael Peters of Hartford 
hailed the team's plans, but said some people still have reservations 
about whether the city is being used to force the hand of Massachusetts 
lawmakers. ``Two million dollars is nothing _ it doesn't lock anybody 
in,'' he said. ``But I think Kraft is very sincere about coming here.'' 
Despite the euphoria that greeted the news here, some experts were 
skeptical about the wisdom of abandoning Boston for the nation's 27th-largest 
television market, 28th-largest state and 37th-largest metropolitan 
area. Mark Rosentraub, a professor of public affairs at Indiana University 
who specializes in sports economics, said the plan posed ``a grave 
risk'' for Connecticut. He said many Connecticut residents were fans 
of the New York Giants, and said he questioned how many current Patriots 
fans would drive down from the Boston area year after year _ especially 
if some are bitter about the team's departure, or if the team or the 
economy slumps. ``Connecticut is too small, and already has split 
loyalties,'' he said. ``It all rests on the Boston market accepting 
the move.'' Several Democratic legislators also raised questions about 
the administration's projections for attendance and revenue. The revenue 
projections were based on the assumption that home games would be 
consistent sellouts. The Senate majority leader, George Jepsen, acknowledged 
that some members think ``the numbers may not quite be there,'' but 
said the expected impact on the region would lead most members to 
support the proposal. ``An NFL team is one of the very things that 
overnight will turn around the image of Hartford as a city in decline,'' 
he said. The state would finance the stadium by selling bonds, which 
would be paid back through a 10 percent tax on tickets, snacks and 
parking revenue from the stadium. Although officials emphasized that 
taxes would not rise to finance the stadium, taxpayers could ultimately 
be liable if revenues fall short. As the two sat side by side behind 
a long table as if contemplating a peace treaty, Rowland went first 
and then glanced back at the document after Kraft signed. ``Just double-checking,'' 
Rowland said with a chuckle. Kraft handed him a football autographed 
by the team. Standing beside a color drawing of the proposed stadium, 
Rowland said that with Thursday's announcement, the state would talk 
about redeveloping the worn core of Hartford and start doing it. ``A 
state is defined by its capital city, and today we have a chance to 
define ourselves,'' Rowland said. ``Twenty-four million people per 
year drive by and drive through Hartford. The idea here is to get 
some of them to stop. We want to be more than a mile marker between 
Boston and New York.'' Kraft said he turned to Connecticut in frustration 
after years of unsuccessful effort to win the subsidies he wanted 
from the Massachusetts Legislature for a new stadium. He reached an 
agreement with the state Senate that would have required him to spend 
$200 million with the state kicking in $72 million. But House leaders 
would approve only $57 million, which Kraft said killed the deal. 
``Massachusetts has had over 35 years to try to solve this problem 
and has been able to do it,'' he said. At another point, he looked 
into the 24 television cameras arrayed in front of him and addressed 
his 17,000 season-ticket holders, whom he twice referred to as ``accounts.'' 
``Some of you might be uncomfortable with this move,'' he said. ``We 
had no opportunity to solve our problem in the near term. If the city 
of Hartford and the people of this state had not gotten together and 
come up with this, our family would have to put this team up for sale.'' 
He said that for viewers and fans, ``Nothing changes _ the New England 
Patriots will be able to stay in this region _ please, God _ for the 
next 30 years, and we're going to bring a championship home.'' He 
later said he was confident that he would retain many of his current 
fans, in part because 40 percent of Patriots season-ticket holders 
live outside Massachusetts _ most of them in Rhode Island, Connecticut 
and the Albany, N.Y., area. Boston television reporters trailed Kraft 
through the Capitol, asking him repeatedly if there were any way the 
team would remain in Boston. ``We're not considering other options 
now,'' he said flatly. He noted that Connecticut had until the end 
of the year to begin implementing its part of the agreement. ``If 
they do it,'' he said, ``we're coming here.''
