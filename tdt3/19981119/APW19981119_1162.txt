Federal sleuths raided offices of India's largest private company 
Thursday, looking for evidence against a top executive allegedly involved 
in a sensational political scandal. Police say Reliance Industries 
Group President V. Balasubramanian, who has been on the run since 
investigators charged him last month, received top-secret government 
documents before they were presented in Parliament. Investigators 
have not given details on the documents. S.M. Khan, spokesman for 
the Central Bureau of Investigation, said raids were ordered to investigate 
alleged violations of the Official Secrets Act by Balasubramanian. 
A federal officer said on condition of anonymity that searches were 
carried out in offices in New Delhi and Bombay. The New Delhi police, 
which filed a case against Balasubramanian before federal investigators 
took over the investigation, said he received classified papers from 
Romesh Sharma, alleged to be a master swindler with close links to 
powerful politicians, bureaucrats and Mafia gangs. Sharma was arrested 
last month and charged with bribing top Indian politicians from various 
political parties in return for business deals. His alleged wrongdoing 
reads like a racy thriller _ a mix of political rackets, sexual scandals, 
underhand deals and extortion of large sums of money from influential 
people. Officials of Reliance Industries _ a conglomerate with interests 
ranging from oil and gas production to petrochemicals, textiles and 
weaving _ initially denied that the raids had occurred, then said 
that ``nothing incriminating'' was found. ``Reliance has never obtained 
or used any documents or information covered by the provisions of 
the OSA (Official Secrets Act) for any purposes,'' Reliance said in 
a statement faxed to The Associated Press from the company's Bombay 
headquarters. ``Allegations and misinformation to the contrary are 
being continuously unleashed on the media by our known corporate rivals.'' 
it said. Investigators also searched the 18-story residence of Reliance 
chairman Dhirubhai Ambani in Bombay's plush Cuffe Parade neighborhood, 
Press Trust of India reported. At the country's main stock market, 
reports of the raids created unease on the Bombay Sensitive Index, 
Dow Jones Newswires reported. However, the market and Reliance stocks 
were down only slightly at the market's close Thursday.
