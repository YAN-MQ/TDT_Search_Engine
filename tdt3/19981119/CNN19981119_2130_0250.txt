A federal judge has ordered a trial in the wrongful death civil suit 
against former au pair Louise Woodward. She was convicted of second-degree 
murder last year in connection with the death of 8-year-old Matthew 
Eappen. A judge reduced that verdict to involuntary manslaughter, 
and sentenced her to time already served in prison. Today, a judge 
ruled Woodward may be liable for punitive damages.
