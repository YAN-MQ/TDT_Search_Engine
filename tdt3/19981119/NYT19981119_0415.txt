Israel is to start transferring 200 square miles of the northern West 
Bank to Palestinian control by early Friday morning, in line with 
a Cabinet decision Thursday giving final clearance to the first of 
three pullbacks under the new peace plan. The Israeli army is preparing 
to withdraw from 7 percent of the West Bank now under joint control 
and to transfer another 2 percent to Palestinian civil control. The 
territory is mostly rural land between Jenin and Nablus, sparsely 
populated by about 30 villages and towns. In Qabatiya, one of two 
large towns there, Mayor Muhammad Ibrahim Abu Rab said there were 
no specific plans yet for a celebration. No one knew what would happen 
and when it would happen, he said. The town of 17,000 residents is 
already under Palestinian civil control, but the Israelis will turn 
security control over to the Palestinian police. Since they do not 
operate a base there, though, there will be no visible withdrawal. 
``We won't be able to tell that we are liberated until we get a call 
from the Palestinian authorities,'' Abu Rab said. ``When we get the 
instructions, then we will hold a rally and decorate the town. Everyone 
is waiting for this, waiting to be free of the Israelis. The troops 
have made their last raids here, their last arrests.'' The governor 
of the Jenin region, Zuhair Manasra, said Israeli and Palestinian 
officials would tour the area together Friday, marking borders and 
deciding where checkpoints will be placed. The withdrawal will be 
Israel's first from the West Bank since it pulled out of most of the 
now divided town of Hebron in early 1997. The Cabinet's go-ahead presented 
a clear sign that the implementation of the peace plan was under way 
after weeks of delay and bellicose statements. But the Cabinet ministers 
granted only lukewarm backing to the first withdrawal, the latest 
indication of Netanyahu's tenuous control over his government. They 
voted 7-5 to start the land transfer with three abstentions _ including 
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, who helped negotiate the U.S.-brokered 
agreement _ and two absences. In authorizing the transfer, the Cabinet 
accepted generally that the Palestinians had lived up to their security 
commitments to date, among them the broadcast of decrees outlawing 
incitement and ordering the surrender of illegal weapons to the authorities. 
Also, an executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization 
has reaffirmed the annulment of clauses in the Palestinian covenant 
calling for Israel's destruction. But some ministers said there was 
insufficient evidence of the Palestinian assertion that they had arrested 
more than a dozen fugitives wanted by the Israelis. The Cabinet also 
approved the opening of the Palestinian airport in Gaza, which is 
expected by Sunday, when Royal Air Maroc is scheduled to make the 
inaugural landing with a planeload of Moroccan officials. And it authorized 
the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. But there 
have been complicated negotiations with the Palestinians over the 
individual prisoners to be released. Israel said it would free only 
those ``without blood on their hands.'' It plans to include 150 common 
criminals in the first group, against the Palestinians' protest. ``Do 
you think Yasser Arafat went to Wye Plantation to free car thieves?'' 
said Ahmed Tibi, a senior aide to Arafat, the Palestinian leader. 
The Palestinians have refused the list, but the Israelis plan to drop 
off the released prisoners at military checkpoints between Israel 
and the Palestinian territories Friday morning, said Hisham Abdul 
Raza, the Palestinian minister of prisoner affairs. Sharansky said 
he had abstained from voting _ surprising Netanyahu _ because he preferred 
to wait until the issue of the prisoners had been resolved. ``It's 
better to wait for 12 or 24 more hours,'' Sharansky said on Israeli 
radio. ``If tomorrow we release 250 prisoners and Arafat says he can't 
accept them, what then?'' ``If now, during the easy part, we don't 
close the gaps, every gap we don't close now will become an explosive 
that will blast the entire agreement,'' Sharansky said.
