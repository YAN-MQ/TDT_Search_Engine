The National Basketball Association's players and owners will resume 
talks Friday aimed at ending a labor dispute that has caused the first 
month of the season to be canceled. NBA Commissioner David Stern and 
a small group of league officials sat down late Tuesday with Player's 
Union Executive Director Billy Hunter and other representatives. When 
the two sides hold a full bargaining session Friday, it will be their 
first since October 28th. One of the main issues is how to divide 
the so-called basketball-related income, which amounted to $2 billion 
last year. The league wants a 50-50 split, but players say they want 
60 percent of the money. The cancellation of the first month of the 
season has cost the players $14 million in salaries per game. The 
owners are under pressure to get the season started before mid- December 
when lucrative television contracts go into effect.
