After years of digging across northern France, war buff Philippe Gorczynski 
has found his prize: a rusty but intact British tank from the Great 
War, with a few surprises inside. On Thursday, a dozen archeological 
workers used an earth mover to gently remove tons of red earth covering 
the Mark IV tank in this farm town near the Belgian border, a former 
World War I battlefield. Under 2.5 meters of soil in a vegetable patch, 
Gorczynski said finding the tank was like searching out the proverbial 
needle in a haystack. After years of talking to residents, poring 
over battle maps and digging in about 20 sites, the hotel owner in 
nearby Cambrai finally sunk his spade in the right place on Nov. 5. 
``I was almost in shock. It was the culmination of all my research,'' 
Gorczynski said. ``I think of all the names of the soldiers I knew.'' 
But what he found inside was even more surprising: both British and 
German silverware, lamps and helmets. British troops abandoned the 
tank on Nov. 20, 1917, and German troops then buried it and used it 
as a bunker in this town of brick houses and cow pastures. The team 
of archaeologists was expected to officially raise the tank on Nov. 
20, next week, to mark the day the tank changed hands. Using the earth 
mover, they were to dig a hold 5 meters (15 feet) deep around the 
tank in order to raise it with a crane. ``We're going to repair it, 
remove the rust and clean it, then turn it into a monument,'' said 
Alain Jacques, a leader of the team.
