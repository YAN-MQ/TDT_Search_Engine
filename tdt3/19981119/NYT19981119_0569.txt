The New England Patriots' proposed move from the Boston area to the 
much smaller Hartford, Conn., market could make the team much richer, 
but only if the team can sell out the luxury seating planned for a 
68,000-seat stadium, stadium experts say. The proposed $350 million 
stadium would have 125 to 150 luxury suites, and 6,000 club seats, 
which typically feature comfortable chairs and waiter service. But 
the Hartford market, which saw the Whalers hockey team leave last 
year for North Carolina, is the 27th largest in the country, with 
915,770 households, according to Nielsen Media Research. The Boston 
market has nearly 2.2 million households. ``That's an immense amount 
of luxury seating for that market to absorb,'' said Mark Rosentraub, 
director of the Center for Urban Policy and the Environment at Indiana 
University. ``The real downside is if they can't sell it all and need 
an extra state subsidy.'' A move to Hartford would add another National 
Football League team to the ranks of those that have moved to smaller 
markets in the 1990s, drawn by the lure of stadium leases that confer 
almost all the revenue upon the team. The Rams and Raiders left the 
Los Angeles area, the second largest market, for St. Louis, the No. 
21 market, and Oakland, which is part of the No. 5 market, respectively. 
The Oilers were lured to Tennessee from Houston, the 11th largest 
market, and will start the 1999 season in a new stadium in Nashville, 
the No. 33 market. And Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell took the 
team from the 13th largest market to Baltimore, the 23rd largest. 
The newly named Ravens play in a stadium paid for largely through 
state lottery proceeds. The Raiders' return to Oakland has been fraught 
with difficulties in selling luxury seating and season tickets. But 
the other moves have been largely successful because they tapped into 
a fan base hungry for a first crack at pro football, like Nashville, 
or eager to get a team back, like Baltimore, whose Colts bolted for 
Indianapolis in 1984. ``Going to Hartford is really trading down,'' 
said Rosentraub, who added that a concern for the Patriots should 
be whether it can continue to tap into the corporate wealth of the 
Boston market for its luxury seating while playing 85 miles away in 
Hartford. Robert Kraft, the team's owner, said the renters of the 
35 luxury suites in the Patriots' current stadium, in Foxboro, Mass., 
are scattered around the region. But the Hartford suites would be 
more plentiful and more expensive, requiring the team to draw a broader, 
wealthier clientele than it currently taps. ``The 25-mile radius around 
Hartford isn't that strong, but when you expand it to 75 miles it's 
better,'' said Marc Ganis, the president of SportsCorp Ltd., a Chicago-based 
consulting firm. ``If they can tap into Fairfield County, with its 
Fortune 100 headquarters, to sell luxury suites and club seats, that 
would be a big plus. But it's a big challenge.'' Kraft, who bought 
the Patriots nearly five years ago, declined to say whether he had 
received any advance guarantees from corporations to lease the luxury 
suites. But he said: ``We think we'll be able to sell the luxury suites 
out before the stadium is finished. We've done the studies. We feel 
the location can support the stadium.'' Dean Bonham, head of the Bonham 
Group, based in Denver, said: ``You can have a $350 million stadium, 
150 luxury boxes and a sweet lease, but if not enough people show 
up, you have a problem. I hope they're doing good market research 
on the fan base.'' The proposed Patriots-Hartford deal is a distinct 
wrinkle in the game of threats and cajolery that team owners play, 
pitting city against city for the best stadium deal possible. Kraft 
wanted to stay in his region _ he even wanted to use his own money 
to build a stadium in South Boston, which is rare among owners _ but 
got caught in the politicking in the Massachusetts legislature and 
found a more kindly reception in Connecticut. ``If we couldn't solve 
this problem for New England, I'd have to put the team up for sale, 
which I didn't want to do,'' he said. By being lured to Hartford with 
a plan that requires him to pay only 10 percent of gross revenues, 
Kraft could reap a windfall like those being received by teams in 
new stadiums, raising his stadium income to between $20 million and 
$30 million. Bonham suggested that the Connecticut agreement could 
be the leverage Kraft needs to stay in Massachusetts. If Kraft tried 
to move elsewhere between now and Dec. 31, he would forfeit $2 million 
now in escrow. ``The $2 million would be an inexpensive price for 
a deal in Massachusetts,'' Bonham said. The move to a smaller market 
will have no appreciable effect on the team's broadcast income because 
all television deals with the NFL are done on a national basis.
