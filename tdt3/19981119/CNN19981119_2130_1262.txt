Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." All season long, Sammy Sosa 
insisted that Mark McGwire was the man. Today, the baseball writers 
felt differently as slammin' Sammy won national league most valuable 
player honors in a land slide over big Mac. Sosa may have come up 
four short of McGwire in the great home run race of '98, but he picked 
up all but 2 of the 32 first-place votes in the balloting. I have 
to say that numbers don't lie. One of the reasons they came a long 
way is because, you know, they know what they're doing up there. And 
I want to say thank you to everybody that voted for me. And thank 
you to those that don't vote for me. And then, hey, it's a beautiful 
country. I hope that, you know, next year I can do it again.
