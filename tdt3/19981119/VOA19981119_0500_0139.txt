Just hours from now, the U.S. congressional committee here in Washington 
will open impeachment proceedings against President Clinton. Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Stat will be the lone witness on the first day of 
these public hearings. VOA's Paula Wilson reports Mr. Starr plans 
to defend his investigation of the president and his findings. The 
House Judiciary Committee faces a daunting task. Members must sift 
through the facts, determine if President Clinton's actions warrant 
removal from office and send a recommendation to the Full House. Mr. 
Starr's testimony is sure to ignite partisan passions in the committee 
room. In his prepared remarks, he accuses the president of a pattern 
of deceit and abuse of power. Most of his statement focuses on Mr. 
Clinton's efforts to conceal his relationship with former White House 
intern Monica Lewinsky. But Mr. Starr says the president's actions 
must be taken in context and he brings up other matters not mentioned 
in the report he sent to Congress in September. Committee Democrats 
are already planning to challenge Mr. Starr and accuse him of launching 
a vendetta against the president. They say his testimony is part of 
an effort by House Republicans to expand their inquiry. Committee 
Chairman Henry Hyde says he's trying to be fair. He says the panel 
will call four more witnesses, but they will be questioned behind 
closed doors. They include the president's top aide and confidant 
Bruce Lindsey. Paula Wilson, VOA News, Capitol Hill.
