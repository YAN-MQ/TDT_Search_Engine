BankAmerica Corp., the newly merged banking giant, has sold a mutual 
fund company it bought only a year ago to its managers. Senior managers 
of Robertson Stephens Investment Management, the asset-management 
arm of the old Robertson, Stephens &AMP; Co., teamed up to buy the 
company from BankAmerica. The company, based in San Francisco, manages 
$4 billion in assets, including $2 billion in mutual funds, and specializes 
in investing in young, fast-growing companies. Terms of the sale were 
not disclosed. Just before its merger with Nationsbank last spring, 
BankAmerica bought Robertson, Stephens &AMP; Co. to bolster its securities 
and mutual fund operations. But the business overlapped with the operations 
of Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, N.C. The merged company, also 
called BankAmerica, sold the investment-banking arm of Robertson Stephens 
to the BankBoston Corp. in August for $800 million and said it would 
sell the investment-management division separately. G. Randy Hecht, 
a founder of Robertson Stephens Investment Management who is its chief 
executive and president, will be the chairman and chief executive 
of the new entity, to be called RS Funds when the sale is completed 
in the first quarter of next year. ``We pursued this management buyout 
because we strongly believe that returning to our roots as a private 
company with the same leadership team that founded the company in 
1984 is the ideal ownership structure for our mutual fund shareholders,'' 
Hecht said in a statement. The sale will not materially affect the 
earnings of BankAmerica, the company said in a statement. The sale 
does not include other asset-management units of BankAmerica, including 
its Wealth Management Group, Nations Funds or the Pacific Horizon, 
Time Horizon and World Horizon mutual funds. The Wealth Management 
Group manages more than $203 billion in assets.
