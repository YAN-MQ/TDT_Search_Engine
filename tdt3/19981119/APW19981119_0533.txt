Japan's Hisashi Teraji defended his Orient-Pacific light heavyweight 
boxing title with a 12-round split decision over Jamie Wallace of 
Australia Thursday. Teraji knocked down Wallace, the Orient-Pacific 
ninth-ranked contender, in the first round with a right straight to 
the face. But Wallace took the command of the fight in later rounds. 
He knocked Teraji down in the 12th and final round. Teraji was making 
his third defense of the title he won from Garth Cussion of Australia 
in Japan in April 1996. Teraji weighed 78.7 kilograms (173 1/2 pounds) 
and Wallace 78.25 kilograms (172 1/2 pounds).
