the impeachment hearings against President Clinton are underway. Special 
Prosecutor Kenneth Starr has been facing fierce cross-examination 
after testifying for more than two hours. He has accused the President 
of lying to try to impede investigations of his behavior. He could 
choose truth, or he could choose deception. On all six occasions, 
the President chose deception. Democrats are attacking Starr, they 
say he is obsessed with bringing down the President.
