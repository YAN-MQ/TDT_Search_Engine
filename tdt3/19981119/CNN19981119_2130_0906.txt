independent counsel Ken Starr told the house judiciary committee today 
President Clinton repeatedly used the machinery of government and 
the powers of his office to obstruct his investigation. Starr defended 
the detail his investigation required to come to its conclusion. The 
Lewinsky investigation could not properly be conducted in a slap-dash 
manner. It was our duty to be meticulous, to be careful. We were. 
And in the process, we uncovered substantial and credible evidence 
of serious legal wrongdoing by the president.
