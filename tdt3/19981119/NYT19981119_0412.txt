American Airlines said Thursday that it had agreed to acquire Reno 
Air, a struggling, low-fare company, for $124 million in cash. The 
agreement, which could help bolster American's presence in the West, 
provides for a cash tender offer for all the outstanding Reno Air 
common stock at $7.75 a share. American will also make a tender offer 
for outstanding preferred stock at $27.50 a share. Shares of Reno 
Air rose $1.125 cents Thursday, to $7.9375, while shares of the AMR 
Corporation, the parent of American, fell $1.625, to $63.125. The 
board of Reno Air has recommended that holders tender their shares, 
American said, adding that it hoped to complete the transaction in 
the first quarter of 1999. American said it would integrate Reno Air 
into its operations, ending its status as a low-fare airline, but 
would not discuss those plans until federal regulators approved the 
deal. How fast, or even whether, the transaction is completed could 
depend on the pilots' unions. Their dissatisfaction with proposed 
work rules, pay or seniority has thwarted previous airline agreements, 
most recently the proposed marketing agreement between United Airlines 
and Delta Air Lines that unraveled after Delta pilots objected. The 
Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,000 pilots, 
pointed out Thursday that the deal required negotiations among its 
union, AMR and the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents Reno 
Air's pilots. ``A transaction of this magnitude clearly raises a host 
of complex issues and will likely take several months before it is 
completed,'' the association said. Larry Cox, a captain who is the 
spokesman for the Reno Air pilots, said the outlook for the purchase 
``looks favorable.'' But he also said, ``Of course, we will carefully 
consider the potential effects of the acquisition, if any, on our 
pilots' job security and seniority.'' Both airlines said there was 
almost no overlap on their routes. Since 1993 they have had a marketing 
partnership that includes making American's frequent-flier miles available 
to Reno Air passengers. The partnership helped American maintain a 
stronger presence on the West Coast after closing its hub in San Jose, 
Calif., in 1993 in the face of stiff competition from the low-fare 
Southwest Airlines. Though American, which is based in Fort Worth, 
has a strong East-West route system, it has relatively few North-South 
flights in the West. By contrast, Reno Air's 16-city route system 
extends largely from Oklahoma City to Anchorage and includes service 
to Tucson, Ariz.; San Diego; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Portland, 
Ore., and Seattle. It also serves San Jose, subleasing the gates formerly 
operated by American. The airline, which owns two jets and leases 
25 aircraft, employs 2,000 workers. American expects to hire all of 
them. Donald J. Carty, chairman of AMR, said the acquisition would 
also strengthen American's global network by bolstering existing foreign 
airline partners. Reno Air, which has gone through several reorganizations 
and downsizings in its six-year history and lost $11.6 million last 
year, has a joint marketing agreement with Canadian Airlines, which 
is 33 percent owned by AMR. It also has code-share agreements with 
Qantas and Hawaiian Airlines and an agreement with American Eagle, 
AMR's regional carrier, to sell seats on each other's flights. But 
not everyone is optimistic about the proposed acquisition. ``American 
and Reno Air are both good airlines, but the purchase doesn't make 
sense except for the shareholders of Reno,'' said Michael Boyd, president 
of the Boyd Group, an aviation consulting and research company in 
Evergreen, Colo. ``For less than $124 million, American could have 
filled that gap on its own. As it is, it's getting low-yield routes 
that are dominated by Southwest and a fleet that is modern but doesn't 
always match American's.''
