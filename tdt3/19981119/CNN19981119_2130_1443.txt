Sonny Bono's widow says prescription drugs contributed to his death. 
Bono died in a skiing accident last January. Mary Bono told "TV guide" 
that he took painkillers for chronic back and neck pain, 15 to 20 
pills a day. She said the pills clouded his judgment, made him behave 
erratically and led to his death. Tests on his body showed no evidence 
of drug or alcohol abuse.
