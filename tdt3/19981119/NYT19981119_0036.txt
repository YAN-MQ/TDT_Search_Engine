It has become a pattern this season with the Rangers. They play hard, 
they keep the score low and close. But they lose. Wednesday night, 
they fell by 3-1 to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The Rangers had 10 
power plays of various lengths but could not score with the manpower 
advantage. It was their second consecutive defeat and they are without 
a victory in their last three. Their record of 4-8-5 leaves them in 
last place in the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference. They 
have scored 39 goals in 17 games, but 16 of those goals came in two 
games. The Ducks broke a 1-1 tie on the power play at 6 minutes 42 
seconds of the third period. Scoring on the rebound was Marty McInnis 
_ set up by Paul Kariya _ who burst down left wing, faked around one 
Ranger and fired a shot on goalie Mike Richter. The Ducks made it 
3-1 in the final minute when Kariya scored into the empty net after 
the Rangers pulled Richter for an extra attacker. It was the first 
of a five-game road trip for the Rangers, who play at Los Angeles 
on Thursday night and at San Jose on Saturday. The Ducks scored first, 
just as a Ranger power play expired, at 15:12 of the second period. 
Getting the goal was Steve Rucchin, who intercepted a pass from Aleksei 
Kovalev to Brian Leetch along the right boards. The Rangers got it 
right back at 16:34 when Niklas Sundstrom beat Guy Hebert from the 
slot after passes from Kovalev and Wayne Gretzky. The game had a combative 
edge to it, with players on both teams hitting hard. Kariya, the Anaheim 
superstar, was roughed up by the Rangers' Todd Harvey, who took no 
penalty for it. Later, Stu Grimson roughed Harvey up in retaliation 
and they both went off. Kariya took a two-minute penalty for elbowing 
Kovalev in the head.
