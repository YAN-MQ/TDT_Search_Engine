When you had the idea, you were just a kid. But lately, you've had 
to buy into some pretty adult stuff... like strategies for attracting 
and retaining the best employees... and maximizing shareholder value. 
At Arthur Andersen, we help people make those kinds of decisions... 
which lets them concentrate on things like transforming... complex 
three-dimensional objects into simple digital data. You know... kid's 
stuff. It takes 12 miles of cotton to make a lands' end pinpoint Oxford 
shirt-- the cotton yarn is that fine. And that's only the beginning. 
It takes 75 different sewing steps-- some for seams that you won't 
even know are there. These lands' end oxfords are made with authentic 
old world tailoring. Like the English-style split back yoke. It gives 
a little when you move. Even the buttons are special. They're made 
of the same tough resin as bowling balls. Even commercial laundering 
doesn't faze them. Now, maybe you can find pinpoint oxfords with this 
lands' end quality at classy men's stores. But we doubt you'll find 
anything like our prices. Or our selection. Lands' end direct merchants.
