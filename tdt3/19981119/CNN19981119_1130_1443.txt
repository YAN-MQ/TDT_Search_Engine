Whatever happened to the Hula hoop? There's a place to find fabulous 
fads of the past again. Here's "what's on-line." Fads may come and 
go, but even the ones we'd like to forget are here to stay at the 
bad fads web site. Relive the fashions, collectibles, activities and 
events that shaped the past. In the fashion section, you'll find facts 
on everything from bell-bottoms to tie-DYEs. Did you know that bell-bottoms 
were derived from a style of naval uniform? Tie-DYEs may be associated 
with deadheads, but they originated in Nigeria. Which of these collectibles 
can you find in your household today? It was 1957 when people all 
over the world began swiveling their hips to the Hula hoop. The exe-pleasing 
lava lamp was all the rage in the late 1960s. And remember those little 
dolls that were so ugly they were cute? Some don't like to admit it, 
but if you're 30-something or older, you likely have some fond memories 
from the disco years. The 90s finds disco still, "stayin' alive." 
Some called it an act of liberation, others an act of boredom. But 
we all called it the streak. And it was all the rage in the 70s. When 
your done looking back, get in tune with today by checking out cNN.com/online 
for links to this and other sites. That's "what's on-line."
