Q. My boss was fired, and, as his right-hand man, I have reason to 
believe that I will also get my walking papers as soon as his replacement 
is hired. Meanwhile, I am a manager without any sort of contract to 
protect me. My media agency is small and needs me to keep things running 
until the new boss arrives. Should I use this opportunity to get a 
contract that promises me a severance should I be dismissed? Or could 
such a request be interpreted as bad faith? A. Two words: Stay calm. 
While the urge to scramble for legal guarantees may be intense, avoid 
setting off warning bells among the powers-that-be. Panic breeds panic, 
said Blaine Pardoe, director of technology education services with 
Ernst &AMP; Young and author of ``Cubicle Warfare'' (Prima Publishing, 
1997). M. Lee Smith, a lawyer-turned-publisher whose Nashville company 
specializes in employment law publications, agreed. ``Asking for a 
contract might create more problems than it would solve,'' he said. 
Making such a request now would arouse your employer's curiosity, 
perhaps raising questions about your loyalty. So step back, breathe 
deeply and try to assess the situation rationally. Your predicament 
may not be as grim as you think. You work for a small organization, 
so management is probably aware of your abilities _ assuming that 
you have prospered because of the quality of your work and not because 
of any fawning upon your dearly departed boss. What your firm may 
be less certain about is your willingness to work with a new team. 
Thus, if you're hoping to stay with the company, and perhaps even 
step into your former boss' shoes, ignore the ax dangling above your 
head and throw yourself into the job with enthusiasm. Use this time 
to show the firm just how valuable you are, advised Lee Miller, a 
human-resources executive and employment lawyer. And if you think 
you could do your boss' job, let those in charge know that you want 
to be considered. Even if you don't plan to hang around long, it is 
obviously better not to be booted out the door before lining up another 
gig. So be quiet about your job search, Pardoe warned; if word gets 
out, you can kiss your current position goodbye. Should you decide 
that circumstances give you enough leverage to extract guarantees 
from management, tread softly. Present your request as beneficial 
to everyone, Miller advised. ``Emphasize that you are loyal and willing 
to stay on with a new boss,'' he said. ``Let your superiors know that 
you love the company but that you are understandably concerned about 
your future.'' Most important, don't play hardball, Miller warned. 
Even if you think the organization would collapse tomorrow without 
you, going in with guns blazing, lobbing ultimatums, will only upset 
everyone and probably get you fired. Some people harbor the bizarre 
illusion that they are indispensable, Pardoe said. ``In the real world,'' 
he said, ``everybody's replaceable.'' Michelle Cottle is a Washington
