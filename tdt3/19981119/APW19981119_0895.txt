A strike at a Club Med resort where workers held 373 guests hostage 
earlier this month has been settled, union and resort officials said 
Wednesday. The resort will reopen Dec. 4, said manager Nicolas Japy. 
``We are satisfied because we have reached an agreement,'' said Japy. 
``That's the main thing.'' The resort closed after employees blocked 
entrances and refused to let guests leave on Nov. 7 to protest a breakdown 
in contract negotiations. Police raided the resort and freed the guests. 
Guests said they were not mistreated but were not allowed to leave 
the grounds. The agreement signed Wednesday provides raises of 3.5 
percent now and an additional 1 percent in December, 1999. ``We have 
signed an acceptable agreement,'' said union spokesman Leo Cabit. 
``We cannot say a very good one, but it is acceptable.'' The union, 
which represents nearly 300 workers, had sought 8 percent raises.
