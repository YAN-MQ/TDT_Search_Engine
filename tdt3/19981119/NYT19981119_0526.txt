Throwing the odd elbow. Clutching a stick while the referee is preoccupied. 
Mashing a sweaty glove in the face of some foe-man. Truth be told, 
Colin Campbell might even have done them himself. ``Wayne Cashman 
told me once, `Back in the '70s, you could do things,''' Campbell 
said, referring to a fellow hockey lifer. Campbell's view has changed 
now that he is the Hangin' Judge: the new director of hockey operations 
in the National Hockey League. An early flurry of suspensions and 
fines _ no doubt all deserved _ are the latest career swerve for a 
man with 1,473 penalty minutes, but no suspensions. He administered 
his biggest whacking of this young season Thursday, a seven-game suspension 
for Andrei Nazarov of Tampa Bay, for hitting Colorado's Cam Russell 
in the face with his stick Nov. 13. The NHL, which is trying to increase 
scoring to make the game palatable throughout the Sun Belt, does not 
appreciate the stereotype of hockey as a haven of blatant goons. However, 
Campbell was not brought in to make radical changes when Brian Burke 
became general manager in Vancouver. ``When the job came open, I thought 
of Campbell because he has experience on the ice level,'' commissioner 
Gary Bettman said. ``He didn't have executive experience, but he's 
a smart guy. I think he's off to a terrific start.'' Stringin' em 
up for seven games just might catch the players' attention. Last year 
through this date of the regular season, the league had levied nine 
punishments for fines and a total of six games in suspensions, plus 
lost salary. This regular season, Campbell has handed out 16 decisions 
in fines and 41 games in suspensions plus lost salary. The New York 
Rangers' coach until late last season, Campbell has seen the heart 
of darkness, the manipulative, competitive, larcenous soul of a player. 
``Kevin Lowe, used to say, `If you ain't cheatin', you ain't tryin,''' 
he said with a grin. Campbell's mandate is to catch some of the cheaters 
some of the time, and cut back the nasty business. He said players 
have always despised the dirty trick of slew-footing, for which he 
levied his previous high penalty, five games, to Ruslan Salei of Anaheim, 
for an infraction Oct. 6. Campbell uses films the way his old mentor 
from the Petersborough Petes, Roger Neilson, a k a Captain Video, 
did as an innovative coaching tool. The other day, flicking the video 
images back and forth, a Zapruder Film of indoor mayhem, Campbell 
demonstrated the insidious art of slew-footing. ``Look at that,'' 
he said, pointing as Salei skated alongside Daniel Briere of Phoenix, 
locking him up, forcing Briere's left leg far off the ground. Then 
Salei quickly planted his own left skate, and kicked out his opponent's 
right skate, causing Briere to fall straight backward, landing on 
his helmet. ``Look at him go into convulsions,'' Campbell said. Strapped 
onto a stretcher and rushed to the hospital, Briere is only now working 
back into shape. Campbell cannot prevent all injuries because players 
are half a foot taller these days, heavier, better conditioned, human 
projectiles. ``And don't forget, nowadays, every channel, every sports 
show, every highlight, they've got the slo-mo camera.'' Campbell said. 
``People are much more aware.'' Some of his most controversial decisions 
produce no fine or suspension. Eric Lindros creamed Andreas Dackell 
of Ottawa against the boards, causing the player to exit on a stretcher, 
bleeding from the head. The next day, Campbell recognized the politics. 
``I used to say Eric Lindros should be suspended every game,'' Campbell 
confessed. ``Here's a guy, 6-foot-5; he just likes to run into people. 
We'd put our toughest player on him just to aggravate him. ``People 
will say, `Campbell knows Neilson, so he'll favor the Flyers.' Or, 
people will say, `Campbell is on a power trip. Some people will say, 
`Just give him one game.' But if it's wrong, why give him one game?'' 
Reviewing the film, Campbell asked: Did Lindros leave his feet? No. 
Did Lindros accelerate? No. Did Lindros tuck in his elbows? Yes. Did 
Dackell duck down, putting his head directly in the path of Lindros? 
Yes. Did Lindros use his stick? Absolutely not. Campbell wound up 
not suspending Lindros, which did not make him popular in Ottawa. 
He says his toughest decisions are still ahead, in the Stanley Cup 
series, when feelings impact. He played in the 1982 finals for Vancouver 
and was an assistant with the 1994 Rangers. The Hangin' Judge has 
been there, too.
