President Clinton is on a five-day trip through Asia. Tonight, he 
had dinner with Japan's prime minister. Earlier, the president participated 
in a town hall meeting, stressing the need for Japan to overcome its 
economic recession by opening up its markets to more U.S. goods. He 
also gave a televised speech and asked Japan to support weapons inspections 
in Iraq. The inspection system offers us the best protection system 
over the long run. Don't forget you have suffered in Japan from a 
Sarin gas attack. This is not an academic issue. This is a real issue 
to you. Iraq is a nation that has actually used chemical weapons on 
its own people, the Iranians, on others. They have a biological weapons 
program of some significance and is attempting to develop a nuclear 
weapons program, so this is a very important issue for the world.
