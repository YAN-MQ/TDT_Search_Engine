A former rebel who now serves in Brazil's congress may finally be 
going to the United States, a country that has barred him from its 
shores. U.S. immigration laws have long blocked Fernando Gabeira from 
visiting America because he helped orchestrate the kidnapping of a 
U.S. ambassador in 1969. However, the 57-year-old lawmaker has recently 
been appointed as a congressional observer to the U.N. General Assembly, 
which will meet later this month in New York. ``It's been a long fight'' 
to gain entry into the United States, Gabeira told The Associated 
Press. ``But this time it will be much more difficult for them to 
say `no.''' U.S. Embassy spokesman Terry Davidson said, ``Until we 
receive a visa application from Mr. Gabeira, we have no official position.'' 
Gabeira, the lone congressional representative of Brazil's Green Party, 
says his days of anti-Americanism are long over. ``The U.S. government 
must overcome its incapacity to forget the past,'' he said. In his 
latest attempt to get a visa, Gabeira was refused entry in January 
to attend the New York premiere of ``Four Days in September,'' a movie 
about the kidnapping of U.S. Ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick. Elbrick, 
who received a blow to the head, was held for four days and released 
after the then-military dictatorship allowed 15 political prisoners 
to be flown out of the country. Gabeira, who was later shot and nearly 
killed by military agents, was released himself in a prisoner exchange 
for a kidnapped German ambassador. After spending nine years in exile, 
he returned to Brazil under a 1979 amnesty. Gabeira has made radical 
changes in his life since his days as a member of the left-wing MR-8, 
the revolutionary group that nabbed Elbrick as he drove to work. These 
days, the congressman's fights include saving the Amazon, promoting 
gay and indigenous rights and legalizing nudity on Brazilian beaches. 
He now says that ``violence is not the right response, under any circumstances.'' 
If Gabeira comes for the U.N. meeting, he could be restricted to a 
24-mile (40-kilometer) limit of New York as was Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro during his last visit to the United Nations, a U.S. official 
said.
