Israel's cabinet is discussing whether or not to move ahead with the 
first of three troop pullouts from the West Bank on an interim peace 
deal with the Palestinians. The cabinet will decide whether the Palestinians 
have met their intial commitments under the Wye River agreement. Israel's 
public security minister says the Palestinians appear to have met 
their obligations, adding that the first phase of pull-out should 
take place later today.
