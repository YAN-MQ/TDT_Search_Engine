Some 90 U.S. Army special forces soldiers made parachute jumps from 
two Blackhawk helicopters Thursday as part of an exercise aimed at 
maintaining their combat skills. The jumps, conducted in the desert 
near Ali al-Salem Air Base, went without a hitch, Maj. John Bullion, 
company commander, told reporters. He said the exercise Iris Gold, 
by soldiers of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) from Fort Campbell, 
Kentucky, had nothing to do with the latest tension between Iraq and 
the United Nations. Iris Gold started a month ago and was scheduled 
to continue for two more months, Bullion said. The exercise also is 
aimed at improving the fighting capabilities of Kuwaiti forces in 
the use of light and heavy weapons, desert navigation, medical training, 
air support, mounted operations and communication. ``There is nothing 
like training in the area where you might get involved in combat,'' 
he said. Kuwaiti and U.S. forces have been training together since 
shortly after the 1991 Gulf War that liberated this small oil-rich 
state from a seven-month Iraqi occupation. Kuwait and Washington signed 
a 10-year defense pact after the war. The agreement calls for weapons 
purchases and continuous maneuvers.
