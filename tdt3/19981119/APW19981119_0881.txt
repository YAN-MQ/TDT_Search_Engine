Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn advanced to the quarterfinals of the 
Volvo Women's Open, beating Janet Lee of Taiwan 6-2, 7-5 Thursday. 
Tamarine, the No. 3 seed, needed one hour, 18 minutes to subdue Lee 
with a series of strong crosscourt ground strokes. Tamarine, 38th 
on the WTA Tour, will next face China's top ranked player, Li Fang, 
who took less than an hour to overcome Miho Saeki of Japan, 6-2, 6-0. 
In scorching heat, Li, ranked 45th, hit hard from the baseline to 
defeat Saeki. In another second-round battles, Silvija Talaja of Croatia, 
who scored an upset victory over top seed and 1997 champion Henrieta 
Nagyova of Slovakia in the first round, crushed China's Ding Ding, 
6-4, 6-0. Olga Barabanschikova of Belarus, the tourney's fifth seed, 
moved into the quarterfinals when her opponent Marlene Weingartner 
of Germany, retired with exhaustion while trailing 3-6, 0-5.
