"Headline Sports" is next. And later -- Hollywood tells the story 
of one of the most powerful journalists in U.S. history. When you're 
choosing a name for your baby, you want one you'll feel good about 
for a long, long time. It's the same when you're choosing life insurance 
for yourself. You want something that will endure. When you go with 
state farm, you get a life insurance company... that has always received 
the highest possible ratings... for financial strength. Which means 
state farm is one name... that'll sound just as good when your kids 
are grown up as it does today. Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports."
