The Canadian city of Edmonton beat Stanford on Thursday for the right 
to stage the 2001 World Championships, taking track and field's showcase 
event to North America for the first time. The International Amateur 
Athletic Federation said Edmonton, capital of the province of Alberta, 
received ``massive consensus'' in the secret ballot by the 27-member 
IAAF Council. Paris and New Delhi were the other bidders. The exact 
voting breakdown was not released. It had been widely expected that 
the event would go to North America after events in Helsinki (1993), 
Rome (1997), Tokyo (1991), Stuttgart (1993), Goteborg (1995), Athens 
(1997) and Seville (1999). It was Stanford's third bid after previous 
attempts for the 1997 and 1999 championships. The championships, will 
be held at Commonwealth Stadium, home of the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos. 
Edmonton staged the 1978 Commonwealth Games, 1983 University Games 
and 1996 World Figure Skating Championships.
