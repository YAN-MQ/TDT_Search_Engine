Radical Palestinian factions said Thursday they will hold a conference 
next month to protest Yasser Arafat's plans to annul a reference in 
the Palestinian national charter that calls for Israel's destruction. 
A statement issued by representatives of the eight Syria-based groups 
said a committee has been assigned to prepare for the ``general popular 
Palestinian conference in the Diaspora to condemn the amendment.'' 
Sections of the Palestinian charter which call for Israel's destruction 
are to be amended by the central committee of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization in December. The radical Palestinian factions said their 
conference will be held between 12-16 December, but the venue has 
not yet been decided, although Damascus has been mentioned a possibility. 
Members of Arafat's Fatah organization, the PLO's mainstream faction, 
dominate the 600-member Palestine National Council, the parliament 
in exile. But the radical groups may be able to head off any charter 
change by denying Arafat a quorum for the meeting.
