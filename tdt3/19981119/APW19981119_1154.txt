Serbia's prime minister accused Kosovo's ethnic Albanians of blocking 
peace efforts Thursday, a day after they failed _ for the 17th time 
_ to attend Serb-proposed talks without international mediation. Serbian 
Premier Mirko Marjanovic visited Kosovo's capital, Pristina, on Thursday, 
the day after the Serbian president attempted to meet directly with 
leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. The successive trips 
to Kosovo were an attempt to assert Serbia's authority over the southern 
province, despite continued Western attempts to hammer out a peaceful 
solution. Hundreds have been killed and about a quarter of a million 
people in Kosovo left homeless since Serbs cracked down on separatist 
ethnic Albanian rebels in February. Ethnic Albanian politicians refused 
to attend the talks called by Serb President Milan Milutinovic, saying 
a basic agreement on the future of the province must come first _ 
With international mediation. In Belgrade on Thursday, Serbia's ultranationalist 
vice premier Vojislav Seselj accused the United States of backing 
the ethnic Albanian boycott. He said U.S. mediator Christopher Hill 
can only be a guest at any negotiations. The Serb leadership has rejected 
a draft version of a plan proposed by Hill, envisaging almost no Serbian 
control in the province, while leaving it under the partial jurisdiction 
of Yugoslavia, now made up of Serbia and Montenegro. Milutinovic instead 
offered Kosovo self-rule, with its own authorities and police, but 
under Serb rule. Addressing a ceremony held in Pristina Thursday honoring 
soldiers and police officers who participated in the crackdown, Marjanovic 
blamed the Albanians for stalling the peace. He accused the ethnic 
Albanians of ``causing great damage to everybody, including a big 
majority of Albanians who want to live and work in Kosovo with the 
others'' by boycotting the talks and said Serbia's top priority was 
to ``preserve peace and freedom, territorial integrity and sovereignty.'' 
Meanwhile the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said a 49-year-old 
doctor was killed and his daughter wounded when three masked assailants 
broke into their home in Pec, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of 
Pristina. The Serbian Media Center reported three Serb police were 
wounded, one seriously, on a road in western Kosovo late Wednesday 
in an attack by ethnic Albanian rebels.
