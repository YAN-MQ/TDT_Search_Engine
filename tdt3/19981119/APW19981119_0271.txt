Thursday's ``town hall'' meeting in Tokyo gave U.S. President Bill 
Clinton a chance to talk about his personal life and feelings: On 
whether he got good grades as a child: ``Mostly.'' On his fatherly 
involvement with daughter Chelsea: ``I was very involved with her 
from the time she was a very small baby, always going to her events 
and always working with her on her homework until it became too difficult 
for me. My wife and I both tried to be very involved in her life, 
although she has reached an age where I don't think she always thinks 
it's a good idea.'' His tips on avoiding the jitters when speaking 
before a crowd: ``Imagine, no matter how many people are in your audience 
... that you're speaking in front of a few of your friends. If you're 
in a big crowd, the microphone is your friend. You can speak normally 
because the sound will carry.'' On the pressures of his job: ``Of 
course sometimes you want to get away from it. But the important thing 
is to not get overwhelmed by the work. ... I exercise every day and 
I play a lot of golf _ certainly not as much as I wish. ... I do the 
things that remind me I am a normal person and I need a balanced life.'' 
On his dining habits: ``My wife and I have dinner together every night 
when we're both home. About four times a week we have dinner together, 
and about 3 times a week one or the two of us is out. My favorite 
dish is a Mexican dish, chicken enchiladas.'' On his apology to the 
first lady and Chelsea for his affair with Monica Lewinsky and whether 
they've forgiven him: ``I did it in a direct and straighforward manner, 
and I believe they did, yes. But that's really a question you could 
ask them better than me.''
