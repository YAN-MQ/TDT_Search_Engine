A 19-year-old Russian student has been charged with terrorism for 
threatening to blow up a passenger plane, even though no bomb was 
found and he says it was just an experiment, a newspaper reported 
Thursday. Mikhail Revatsky told investigators he never planned to 
take any money, but placed the note because ``I wanted to watch how 
the security services work and the behavior of people in that situation,'' 
the Kommersant daily quoted him as saying. ``Only once we arrived 
in Moscow, when I saw armed people surrounding the plane, did I understand 
what I created,'' he said. On Aug. 9, the crew aboard an East Line 
aircraft traveling from the Siberian city of Tyumen to Moscow discovered 
a note warning of a bomb on board. The note demanded 621,000 rubles 
(dlrs 100,000 at the time) and onward passage to another country. 
The plane landed at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport and was held on the 
tarmac for four hours while special forces in armored personnel carriers 
and intelligence agents were brought in. The 97 passengers were then 
taken into the terminal and questioned. Police took handwriting samples 
from all of them except the children, and released them. No bomb was 
found on the plane and no ransom was paid. Earlier this month, handwriting 
experts determined that Revatsky, a student at a technical college 
near Tyumen, had written the note. He was arrested and charged with 
terrorism, Kommersant said. If convicted, he faces five to 10 years 
in prison. Airport security has worsened in Russia since the Soviet 
Union fell apart in 1991. Hijackers have targeted domestic flights 
a number of times, but in most cases have given up after negotiating 
with authorities.
