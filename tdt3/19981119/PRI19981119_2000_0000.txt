This is The World. A co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and 
WGBH, Boston. Today is Thursday, November 19th, I'm Lisa Mullins, 
in Boston. Coming up, President Clinton praises Japan's efforts to 
end its recession, but Japanese automakers may have to try harder. 
Despite all of the difficulties faced by the Japanese industry over 
the last eight years, we've only to date seen one plant close. Also 
the Dutch Air Force wants gay recruits. And the British want to get 
rid of some silly old laws. A curious edict that is in force in Birmingham 
means that a man and a women aren't allowed to have sex, "on the steps 
of any church after the sun goes down" First up, this news. From National 
Public Radio News in Washington, I'm A e Taylor.
