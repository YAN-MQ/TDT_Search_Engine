The U.S. government was aware of reports regarding possible contacts 
between a reputed Colombian drug trafficker and associates of Panamanian 
President Ernesto Perez Balladares, the State Department said Thursday. 
But spokesman James P. Rubin said U.S. officials saw no evidence to 
confirm that money from the alleged trafficker, Jose Castrillon Henao, 
was used in Perez Balladares' 1994 presidential campaign. ``When the 
source of this money became known to President Balladares, he had 
that fact publicly disclosed and asked his attorney general to investigate,'' 
Rubin said. Rubin's comments were in response to a Washington Post 
story alleging that Castrillon channeled hundreds of thousands of 
dollars into Balladares' campaign and established business links to 
the president's son-in-law. Imprisoned in 1996, the newspaper said 
Castrillon tried to buy his way out of jail with dlrs 1 million in 
bribes. He thought his ploy succeeded last May when police escorted 
him to a waiting helicopter that he believed would take him home to 
Cali, the report said. Instead, according to the Post, he was transferred 
to a U.S. air base in Panama from where he was flown to Florida. He 
is imprisoned in Tampa facing charges of smuggling 34 tons of cocaine 
to the United States on behalf of the Cali cartel.
