In ``Celebrity,'' Woody Allen presents a world in which the VIP status 
of Joey Buttafuoco (seen fleetingly on a talk show) makes as much 
sense as anything else. He wonders whether being able to provide Knicks 
season tickets and hot restaurant reservations for relatives can be 
the highest form of breadwinning in ``a culture that took a wrong 
turn somewhere.'' Famous for trashing hotel rooms? For being in a 
coma? For reading the weather report on television? In the glitter-crazy 
world of ``Celebrity,'' the only fate emptier than being famous for 
practically nothing is not being famous at all. That's exactly what 
befalls the film's main character, a journalist peering into the lives 
of the famous with his nose pressed to the glass, when he embarks 
on a string of neo-Felliniesque encounters with the rogues' gallery 
of celebrities seen here. Playing this role in an exceptional feat 
of mimicry, Kenneth Branagh assumes the corduroy mantle of Allen and 
takes on the full panoply of self-effacing nervous mannerisms (``Really? 
Great, great, 'cause I don't wanna be, uh... '') as assiduously as 
if he were tackling ``Richard III.'' Yet the film allows this character, 
a dolce vita hanger-on lacking anything like the Mastroianni magnetism, 
to violate one of the most basic rules of celebrity culture. Even 
at its most fatuous, fame is about being one of a kind. And Allen 
is the only man who can save these tics from whiny obsequiousness 
and, with such agile genius, make them work. So the journalist Lee 
Simon is one of the filmmaker's wearier creations, in ways that deny 
``Celebrity'' the bracing audacity of recent, better Allen films like 
``Deconstructing Harry'' and ``Everyone Says I Love You.'' And even 
with Branagh as his younger alter ego, Allen finds no way to revitalize 
the character's predictable worries about advancing his career and 
chasing beautiful women. This film's central situation, involving 
the post-divorce romances of Lee and his high-strung ex-wife, Robin 
(Judy Davis), becomes little more than a pretext for watching fame 
crop up in the most peculiar places. There are a handful of fabulous 
caricatures in Allen's Manhattan sketchbook, but the film too easily 
allows these peripheral figures to outshine its central story. Surprise: 
the most wildly famous figure whom Lee encounters happens also to 
be this film's hottest star. In a devilishly satirical sequence midway 
through the film, Leonardo DiCaprio (uncannily well cast before the 
release of ``Titanic'') bursts into the story while trashing a hotel 
room at the Stanhope and slapping around his equally hysterical moll 
(Gretchen Mol). Just as the police are being summoned, Lee arrives 
to pitch his screenplay to the bad-boy wonder and is caught up in 
the frenzy. Several other guest-star segments in ``Celebrity'' stand 
out in equally bright, witty relief. ``You're going to send off those 
truffles to the president,'' Melanie Griffith's pampered movie queen 
instructs her staff, just before drifting into a very funny brief 
encounter with Lee. Another dazzling vignette presents Charlize Theron 
emerging from her cocoon of clean-cut roles (as in ``Devil's Advocate'') 
to play a stunning, imperious model who takes Lee in tow. Once again, 
Allen shows a keenly acerbic eye for the scene he sets (downtown hip, 
with Isaac Mizrahi as a painter who complains about being too popular) 
while letting it upstage the putative center of the film. Though ``Celebrity'' 
is filled with beautiful and famous faces, it has plenty of opportunity 
to bog down between star turns, and some of the episodes about the 
Simons are astonishingly flat. Lee's high school reunion, where he 
is filled with contempt for his aging classmates and myopic self-involvement, 
is a sequence as dismal as his quip: ``Ask not for whom the bell tolls 
_ or more accurately, for whom the toilet flushes.'' While Lee drifts 
among glamorous women (with Famke Janssen as a svelte book editor 
and bewitchingly flirty Winona Ryder as an ambitious waitress-actress), 
Robin fumes and tries desperate measures. She visits a religious retreat 
where a priest with a television show signs autographs. She goes to 
a plastic surgeon (Michael Lerner) who's been dubbed ``the Michelangelo 
of Manhattan'' by Newsweek. She begins dating a television producer 
(Joe Mantegna) who takes her to a screening of a film he finds pretentiously 
shot in black and white. (``Celebrity'' is, of course, also shot in 
black and white, enhanced by the superb clarity of Sven Nykvist's 
cinematography.) Ms. Davis plays Robin in a harried, antic manner 
at first, then softens as she evolves into the film's most unlikely 
luminary. Ms. Davis also gets to deliver the film's obvious message 
in a single unremarkable line: ``You can tell a lot about a society 
by who it chooses to celebrate.'' But most of what you can tell from 
the fun-house mirrors of ``Celebrity'' is what you already know.
