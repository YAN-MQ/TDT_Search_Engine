Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said Thursday he would accept an invitation 
to watch a soccer game in Istanbul if the Turkish government agrees 
to a dialogue on the sharp dispute surrounding a Kurdish rebel leader 
held in Rome. Turkey has been pressuring Italy to extradite the leader, 
Abdullah Ocalan, whose guerrillas have fought a bloody, 14-year-old 
war for Kurdish autonomy. But D'Alema insists he won't be intimidated 
and appears determined to refuse extradition. The invitation was extended 
by Turkey's deputy premier for the match between Italian soccer champion 
Juventus of Turin against Istanbul's Galatasaray in a Champions League 
game Wednesday. But questioned on whether he would meet D'Alema in 
Istanbul, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said ``if he wants to see me, 
let him come to Ankara,'' the Anatolia news agency reported. D'Alema 
has urged the European Union to back his efforts at maintaining friendly 
relations with Turkey while respecting Italian law, which prohibits 
extradition to a country with the death penalty. But EU countries 
are at odds over whether Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, 
is a terrorist organization and have yet to weigh in on the dispute. 
Italy has played a role in trying to convince the EU to accept Turkey's 
appliciation for membership _ which was turned down last year after 
it was decided Turkey needed to improve its human rights record. According 
to Italian news reports, D'Alema is also upset at the United States, 
which is pushing Italy to extradite Ocalan. The U.S. State Department 
on Wednesday said it was deeply skeptical Ocalan would stick to his 
pledge to renounce terrorism. Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's 
airport after he stepped off a flight from Russia, which denied him 
asylum. Italy is now weighing his asylum request. The conflict between 
Turkey and Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party has killed 37,000. D'Alema's 
possible arrival worries Turkish authorities already dealing with 
growing anti-Italian sentiment. Thousands of people have taken to 
the streets across the country to protest over the past week. Daily 
demonstrations take place in front of the Italian embassy in Ankara. 
Many Turks see the match as an opportunity to express their anger 
with Italy over Ocalan. An ultranationalist paper, Ortadogu, called 
on fans on Wednesday to prepare huge banners in Italian denouncing 
Rome's attitude. Juventus reportedly demanded tightened security for 
the game.
