ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA on Thursday decided against relaxing 
the 23-year age limit for soccer players at the 2000 Sydney Olympics 
despite earlier indications it might be eased. The world body's Olympic 
organizing committee reaffirmed the current rules under which teams 
in Olympic competition may field only three players over the age of 
23. The rules are intended to guard the supremacy of the World Cup. 
A joint IOC-FIFA statement in September said the age limit question 
``may be reopened'' and the number of over-23 players could be increased 
to five for the Sydney Games. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
has pushed for a higher-level Olympic soccer tournament and expressed 
hope the restrictions could be dropped altogether. His FIFA counterpart, 
Sepp Blatter, has said he wants soccer ``given greater prominence'' 
in the Olympic Games. Sixteen men's and eight women's teams will take 
part in the 2000 tournament, which will be staged in Sydney, Melbourne, 
Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra. The men's final will take place on 
Sept. 30, 2000 in Sydney's new Olympic Stadium, FIFA said.
