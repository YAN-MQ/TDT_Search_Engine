Evidence has emerged that Bosnian Serbs may have used chemical weapons 
against Muslim civilians. It's being presented to the UN Warcrimes 
Tribunal in the Hague, by the monitoring group Human Rights Watch. 
Spokesman Uris Tilterman is calling for an investigation. By releasing 
this report today, we are hoping to put pressure on the international 
community and its various institutions to undertake the kind of thorough 
investigation that would be required, and that we as a non-governmental 
organization don't have the means to undertake. Uris Tilterman of 
Human Rights Watch. Thousands of Muslims were killed fleeing the UN 
safe area of Schreberneitza in 1995.
