A Lufthansa plane carrying 73 passengers and crew members made an 
emergency landing at Singapore's Changi Airport Thursday after damaging 
its landing gear on takeoff. ``While it was taking off, it apparently 
hit the open cover of a runway light, so this caused some damage to 
the landing gear,'' Lufthansa senior corporate communications executive 
Ian de Souza told The Associated Press. No one was hurt in the incident, 
he said. Bound for Frankfurt, the Airbus A-340 plane left Singapore 
at 11:20 a.m. (0320 GMT), but flew for some time before the pilots 
realized there was a problem, de Souza said. After the pilots concluded 
that the landing gear was damaged, they returned to Singapore and 
dumped their fuel over the sea before the emergency landing at 1:35 
p.m. (0535 GMT), he said. All the passengers were evacuated immediately 
after the plane touched down, said an official of the Civil Aviation 
Authority of Singapore, who confirmed that there were no injuries. 
Witnesses at the airport said four fire trucks surrounded the plane 
as it sat about two-thirds of the way down one of Changi's runways 
in the early afternoon. De Souza said emergency personnel had to replace 
several tires before moving the plane off the runway, which it had 
been blocking. ``Lufthansa Airlines is investigating the cause of 
the incident,'' said CAAS spokeswoman Huang Peiling. She added that 
the pilots had detected a tire burst, but she could not elaborate 
on the cause. After the plane was safely moved to an adjoining area, 
emergency personnel continued to gather near the plane's rear wheels. 
Lufthansa's technical experts were still ``looking into the damage 
and investigating what could be the possible cause,'' de Souza added 
later. The airline was making alternative travel arrangements for 
the 60 passengers, who were transported to hotels in downtown Singapore 
after the accident, he said.
