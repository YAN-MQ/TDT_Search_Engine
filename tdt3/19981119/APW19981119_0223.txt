KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore bolted for 
the airport only minutes after the end of a disastrous Pacific Rim 
trade summit. Not a minute too soon for many Malaysians. The day after 
his hasty departure, Gore continued to ruffle many Malaysian feathers 
Thursday. Those feathers also belong to several prominent opposition 
figures for whom Gore may have thought he was lending support. On 
Monday night, Gore praised Malaysia's anti-government protesters, 
calling them ``brave'' for their struggle to demand democracy. Problem 
is, those same protesters want an end to the 17-year leadership of 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Making matters worse, Gore made his 
speech in front of Mahathir and several other prominent Asian leaders, 
then walked out of a banquet in his honor. ``Ill-bred'' and ``ignorant'' 
were among the latest slaps in the headlines of the government-backed 
dailies Thursday. ``Gore may be totally ignorant or he just does not 
care,'' wrote Abdul Kadir Jasin, editor of the New Straits Times. 
``He shot from the hip, hit us us below the belt and bolted after 
attacking us in what he later called a `message of democracy.''' Small 
Malaysian flags have been distributed by ruling party activists who 
are calling on citizens to put them on their cars as a sign of solidarity 
with Mahathir. Gore had been filling in for President Bill Clinton, 
who missed the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 
the Malaysian capital because of the U.S.-Iraqi showdown. The Star 
daily carried a three-column article with comments by ordinary Malaysians 
_ all of them ripping the man who hopes to succeed Clinton. ``America 
should not throw its weight around because it has money,'' said C.H. 
Chew, a Malaysian businessman. Karpal Singh, national deputy chairman 
of the opposition Democratic Action Party, expressed regret over Gore's 
speech. ``No doubt the country needed reforms, but for the U.S. vice 
president to have said so at the function was not the right place 
and time,'' he said. In Kota Baharu, the chief minister of the opposition-led 
Kelantan state, Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, told the national news agency 
Bernama that Gore's support for the reform movement was disrespectful. 
``Visitors should respect the host. If there are bad things they should 
at least just keep quiet but the United States does not know how to 
respect other people,'' Nik Abdul Aziz said. Those bad things _ depending 
on which side you're on _ include the firing, jailing and criminal 
charges against Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the string 
of anti-government protests that his arrest has provoked. Several 
Asian governments have accused Gore of meddling in internal matters. 
``The Chinese people and the Chinese government would never, ever 
make irresponsible remarks on other countries' internal affairs,'' 
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told a news conference Wednesday. 
Though Mahathir has stayed above the fray, not making any significant 
comment on the flap, his Cabinet ministers have denounced the American 
vice president. Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz, host of the negotiations 
leading up the APEC summit Tuesday and Wednesday, called Gore disgusting 
and rude. The summit had offered APEC leaders the chance to produce 
their first comprehensive plan to pull the region out of the prolonged 
financial crisis. But the leaders' final statement offered no new 
programs, apart from a dlrs 10 billion support plan announced separately 
by the United States and Japan.
