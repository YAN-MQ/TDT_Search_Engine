Why did the salmon cross the road? Because the banks of its river 
home overflowed. A rain storm near Shelton, Washington, had the local 
salmon a little confused about the boundaries of their natural habitat. 
Some of the salmon who followed the river's flow across a local street 
were forced to Dodge traffic and pedestrians until they made it safely 
back into deeper water.
