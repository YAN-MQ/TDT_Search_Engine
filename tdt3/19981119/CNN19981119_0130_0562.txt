The Vermont Supreme Court is wrestling with the question of same-sex 
marriages. One male and two female couples were denied marriage licenses 
by their town clerks. They lost suits in a lower court and appealed. 
State attorneys argue it's not discrimination because both men and 
women have the right to marry. A lawyer for the plaintiffs says that's 
the same argument used decades ago to support a ban on inter-racial 
marriages. The case is the only one of its kind now at the state Supreme 
Court level.
