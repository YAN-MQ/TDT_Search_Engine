In a dramatic about-face, a rebel lawmaker signed an agreement Thursday 
with the Japanese prime minister to work toward a coalition government. 
The wooing of Liberal Party head Ichiro Ozawa _ a charismatic proponent 
of widespread reforms _ is a victory for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi 
and his ruling party. Anticipating that the alliance could bring more 
tax cuts, currency traders bought yen Thursday, pushing the dollar 
down to 120.64 in late Tokyo trading from its 121.22 a day earlier. 
On overseas markets later, the dollar declined further against the 
yen, dropping below 119. The signing came after the Tokyo stock market 
had closed. Obuchi's administration continues to be unpopular with 
many Japanese increasingly impatient with the unabating recession, 
the worst in decades, which has sent unemployment and bankruptcies 
soaring. The Liberal Party's 93 seats in the more powerful 500-seat 
lower house of Parliament, added to the ruling Liberal Democrats' 
262 seats, would greatly ease the passage of ruling party bills, policies 
and the government budget. Other opposition party leaders were shown 
on the nationally televised evening news criticizing Ozawa for joining 
hands with his former enemy. Ozawa left the ruling party in 1993, 
vowing to offer a real opposition alternative and end the Liberal 
Democrats' four decades of political dominance. Although Ozawa was 
a key backer of reform-oriented administrations in 1993-94, he was 
viewed as too closely linked with the old-style ruling party kingpins 
to gain much popularity among voters. In elections this summer, it 
was the newer, more liberal-leaning Democratic Party that made key 
advances. Ozawa's party has also suffered numerous defections over 
the years. Ozawa called his decision to rejoin the rulers a step forward, 
noting that Obuchi agreed to work toward smaller government, stronger 
national defense, tax cuts and other changes that Ozawa has long pushed 
for. ``This is good for us as a party that has worked to realize politics 
for the people,'' Ozawa said after signing a document with Obuchi 
before the cameras. The ruling party said the two sides agreed to 
a ``radical revision'' of the 5 percent sales tax _ a chief issue 
of contention between the two parties. It was unclear what the revision 
would be. Ozawa, although initially a supporter of the sales tax, 
has shifted his position, saying that a sales tax cut was needed to 
turn around the economy. The tax raise from 3 percent to 5 percent 
in April last year has been blamed for hurting consumer spending. 
The two sides also agreed on income and corporate tax cuts totaling 
10 trillion yen (dlrs 83 billion), higher than the some 6 trillion 
yen (dlrs 50 billion) in tax cuts Obuchi has already promised. ``I 
welcome the strong commitment for cooperation from the Liberal Party,'' 
Obuchi said in a nationally televised interview. The two sides agreed 
on a plan to cut the number of government employees by a fourth over 
the next 10 years, and to reduce the number of lawmakers by 100 and 
the number of Cabinet posts to 17 from 20. The parties will also work 
together in elections. The coalition government is expected to be 
set up before the next regular session of Parliament begins early 
next year.
