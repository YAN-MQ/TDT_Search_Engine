Ryoken Kawagishi shot an eagle en route to a 5-under-par 66 Thursday 
and took a one-stroke first-round lead in the 250 million yen (dlrs 
2 million) Dunlop Phoenix tournament. The 31-year-old Kawagishi, seeking 
his sixth Japan PGA Tour victory overall and his first since 1995, 
shot his eagle on the par-5 seventh hole. He also had five birdies 
_ one on the last hole _ and two bogeys on the 6,846-yard, par-71 
Phoenix Country Club course. ``I am confident with my shotmaking at 
the moment,'' Kawagishi said. Yoshinori Kaneko of Japan, also seeking 
his sixth tour victory, shot a 67 with six birdies and two bogeys. 
Two strokes off the lead at 68 were Lee Westwood of England, who won 
the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters last week in Japan, Ernie Els of 
South Africa and three Japanese _ Tsuneyuki ``Tommy'' Nakajima, Toru 
Taniguchi and Kaname Yokoo. Defending champion Tom Watson shot a 75 
and was tied for 75th with fellow American Todd Hamilton and five 
Japanese, including Tateo ``Jet'' Ozaki. ``I believe I need a good 
sleep tonight,'' said the jet-lagged Watson, who arrived from the 
United States Sunday. A total of 84 players, including 32 non-Japanese, 
teed off in cloudy weather. The winner will receive 45 million yen 
(dlrs 375,000).
