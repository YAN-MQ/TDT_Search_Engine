Floods in western Ukraine have claimed 14 lives and sent more than 
1,000 people to hospitals, officials said Monday. Water has receded 
from most of the 118 towns and villages that were flooded over the 
past two weeks in the Zakarpattia region, but 17 remained inundated 
Monday, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. About 21,200 people 
were evacuated from the area, though 12,500 of them have since returned 
to their homes, it said. More than 9,000 emergency workers will remain 
in the region to repair hundreds of buildings, bridges, dams, roads 
and railways damaged by flooding, the ministry said. Doctors have 
hospitalized 1,360 local residents, mostly with respiratory infections, 
after examining more than 300,000 people who were affected by the 
disaster. Doctors had warned of widespread illness because much of 
the region's drinking water was polluted by the flooding. Ukraine's 
government has allocated 10 million hryvna (dlrs 2.9 million) for 
the relief effort. International organizations including the Red Cross 
and United Nations and countries such as China, France, Germany, Hungary, 
Italy, Poland and Slovakia have sent aid, the Foreign Ministry said. 
Neighboring Russia promised to send aid in the next two days, the 
Russian embassy in Kiev said. No official estimates of the flood damage 
have been provided.
