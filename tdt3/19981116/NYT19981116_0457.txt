After being closed 23 years ago because of a series of suicides, the 
observation deck of the 307-foot clock tower at the University of 
Texas will be reopened to the public, perhaps by next spring. The 
university announced last week that it would reopen the tower, which 
is better known as the site of a shooting 32 years ago that left 14 
people dead and 31 wounded. The tower, which is part of the university's 
Main Building, is one of the tallest structures in Austin. Since the 
tower was completed in 1937, nine people have jumped to their deaths 
from the observation deck, which was closed in 1975. On Aug. 1, 1966, 
Charles Whitman, a student at the university, barricaded himself on 
the observation deck and began shooting passers-by with a rifle. At 
the time, the shooting was the United States' worst mass killing. 
It lasted 93 minutes, ending with Whitman's being killed by the police, 
but its aftereffects have spanned two generations. Whitman, a former 
marine who killed his wife and his mother the night before the tower 
shootings, has been the subject of a movie, and many magazine and 
newspaper articles have been written about Whitman and the incident. 
The University of Texas offers a course that examines the impact of 
Whitman's deeds, and bullet holes made by police officers returning 
Whitman's fire can still be seen in the tower's facade. ``The tower 
is a symbol of a premier university and a very tragic event all at 
the same time,'' said Gary Lavergne, the author of a book about the 
shootings, ``Sniper in the Tower'' (UNT Press, 1997). ``I can't think 
of another building or structure that has such a dual meaning to so 
many people.'' Lavergne, who supports the decision to reopen the tower, 
said the 1966 shootings ``introduced us to the modern concept of what 
is now called simultaneous mass murder.'' The tower gives a commanding 
view of the campus and the city of Austin, and student groups have 
periodically sought to have the observation deck reopened. Last Thursday, 
the university's board of regents agreed to spend about $500,000 to 
install iron barriers to deter suicides and to make the observation 
deck accessible to people with disabilities. Renovations are expected 
to be completed in time for spring graduation. Under the plan, security 
personnel will accompany visitors to the observation deck. The university 
also plans to charge tower visitors an admission fee of $6 each. In 
a statement, the university president, Larry Faulkner, called the 
tower the ``most important symbol of academic aspiration and achievement 
in Texas.'' He added that it is time to ``actively use this icon of 
higher education in positive ways.'' Kara Burch, a senior, is eager 
to see Austin from the tower. ``It's pretty exciting,'' Ms. Burch 
said. ``There's been a lot of debate about the tower on campus. Before 
I graduate, I will be able to go up there.'' Robert Heard, an Austin 
resident who was wounded by Whitman in 1966, agrees with the decision 
to reopen the tower. Heard, an Associated Press reporter when he was 
shot, said: ``We've been long enough without the public being able 
to go up there. It's an idea whose time has come.''
