A favorite accessory worn by the fashion flock at the recent spring 
shows was the muffler or long scarf wrapped several times around the 
throat. It is a good way to add a touch of color, as well as extra 
warmth, to winter clothes. Agnona's gauzy pashmina (cashmere and silk) 
mufflers in apple green, pale gray, brown or slate are $250 at Linda 
Dresner, 484 Park Ave. (58th Street). Barneys New York has pashmina 
mufflers in pink, yellow, lime, blue, beige and deep red by Le Cachemirien 
($295), and in red, wine, midnight, beige or ivory by Bajra ($175). 
Lord &AMP; Taylor has cable-stitched cashmere mufflers ($90) and classic 
flat knits ($55) in a range of colors, including red, plum, wine, 
ivory, hunter green, camel and black. Neiman Marcus has Loro Piana's 
cashmere mufflers ($290) in 15 colors, and private-label cashmere 
mufflers ($90) in eight colors, including pastel blue, lilac and pink.
