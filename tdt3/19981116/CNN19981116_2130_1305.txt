Well Toronto's Roger Clemens won an unprecedented fifth cy young award 
today. The rocket blew away the rest of the field, taking the American 
league honor with all 28 first-place votes. Clemens led the A.L. in 
E.R.A., strikeouts and wins for the second straight season. Each time, 
when I go up there to workout and I look at those -- that hardware 
up there, I realize that it gets me one step closer to the big house 
there as far as Cooperstown.
