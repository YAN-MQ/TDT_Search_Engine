This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with the "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Tuesday. As one area of low pressure moves from the 
Great Lakes into the northeast, producing some light snow or rain 
showers, another stronger system will push into the intermountain 
west with rain and mountain snow. There's another system behind that 
keeping the weather unsettled, and we'll also see some showers across 
the southeast and especially over Florida. Tuesday's highs range from 
30s over the northern part of the nation to 60s and 70s in the south. 
There'll even be a few 80s in southern Florida and Texas. Looking 
ahead to Wednesday, we'll see rain and snow pushing to the northern 
plains states. On Thursday, rain and snow across the Great Lakes, 
showers and thunderstorms down to the gulf coast, and more rain showers 
in store for the northwest. Same situation Friday. The east coast 
will see some rain or snow north, showers and thunderstorms south.
