A Barcelona court set a precedent in Spain on Monday by convicting 
and sentencing a bookshop owner to five years in jail Monday for denying 
the Holocaust and for promoting racism and anti-Semitism. Pedro Varela, 
a former head of the defunct Spanish pro-Nazi group, CEDADE, was tried 
last month following his arrest in December, 1996 after police confiscated 
thousands of pro-Nazi books and videos as well as hundreds of swastikas 
and other Nazi propaganda material in a raid on his ``Europa'' bookshop 
in central Barcelona. News reports said Varela was sentenced to two 
years for denying the Holocaust and another three years for encouraging 
racism and anti-Semitism. He was also fined 730,000 pesetas (dlrs 
5,000), the private news agency Europa Press said. It was the first 
time a person has been tried for such crimes in Spain since they were 
outlawed in the new Penal Code of 1996.
