A new study suggests that if you have to make a speech at the stockholders' 
meeting, give your first piano recital or do the tango in a dance 
contest, you may want to have Mom and Dad _ and anyone else who wants 
you to excel _ stay home. Two psychologists, Dr. Jennifer L. Butler 
of Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, and Roy F. Baumeister 
of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, report research showing 
that people did less well on tasks performed in front of audiences 
that were rooting for them than they did in front of those who were 
not. The research was published in the November issue of the Journal 
of Personality and Social Psychology. To study the effects of supportive 
audiences, the researchers organized three laboratory experiments. 
In the first, 40 people were seated before a one-way mirror and asked 
to count backward by 13 as quickly and accurately as possible starting 
with the number 1470. Half were told that a friend was seated on the 
other side of the one-way mirror; half were told that a stranger was 
there. Those believing they were performing in front of a friend made 
a median number of 17.2 correct subtractions, 1.7 errors, and a total 
of 18.9 calculations. Those told they were before a stranger performed 
more calculations with fewer errors with 23 correct subtractions, 
2.8 errors and 25.8 calculations. In the second experiment 23 subjects 
were asked to perform a difficult video game _ flying a simulated 
aircraft through an obstacle course quickly _ and were told that all 
observers were strangers. But half of the observers would receive 
a cash prize, as the performers would, if the performance surpassed 
a certain score. The other half was told that only the performers 
would receive cash. Before observers who would receive cash, the performers 
took 10 seconds longer and crashed four times as often as those performing 
before an audience with no financial interest in the outcome. The 
third experiment, with 93 participants, was the same as the second 
except the subjects were told that a third group of observers was 
added that would receive the cash prize if the performers failed. 
In this test, steps were taken to account for possible personality, 
emotional and skill-proficiency differences among the performers. 
Here the differences were smaller, but, again, the performers were 
faster and crashed less often before the adversarial group than the 
supporting group. Why should this be? Concentration, most students 
of peak performance agree, is the key to skilled performance. And, 
Baumeister said, ``people's reactions to those who support them, including 
fear of disappointing them, may be more distracting than their reactions 
to those you don't care about them.''
