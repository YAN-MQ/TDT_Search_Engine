The oldest astronaut ever, old enough to have two ticker tape parades 
in New York in one lifetime. John Glenn and the crew of "discovery" 
back from space on earth and in the big apple today. An old-fashioned 
tribute to the man who defied old age, 36 years after John glenn's 
first mission and his first New York ticker tape parade. On his shuttle 
flight, the technology was light years ahead of friendship 7 in 1962. 
But today in New York, little had changed -- on the ground. Slow speed 
and low-tech, just as it was when John and annie Glenn moved up broadway 
the first time. Back then, he spoke modestly of the young space program. 
We feel that perhaps the efforts we're engaged in do really begin 
a new space era. My flight was but one step in this long process. 
He said today the space program is about inspiring people, young and 
old, as much as anything else. All the old people have just as many 
hopes and dreams and ambitions as anyone else. And maybe this flight 
can help encourage them to exercise their own talents, their own capabilities, 
and do some of these things they otherwise might not have done. You, 
too, can have a ticker tape parade.
