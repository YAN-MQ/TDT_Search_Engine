Tobacco companies have agreed to a $206 billion settlement with eight 
states. It would be the biggest U.S. civil settlement ever, but falls 
short of a National proposal that died in Congress this year. Under 
the proposed deal, states would drop their lawsuits against cigarettemakers 
in exchange for $12 billion over the next five years, plus additional 
payments spread out over the following two decades. Tobacco companies 
would stop advertising cigarettes on billboards and public transportation, 
such as taxis. They also agreed to stop marketing tobacco paraphernalia 
such as hats and t-shirts that are popular among youths. This plan, 
I am confident, will go a long way to diminish the number of teenagers 
who begin to smoke in America. Through a combination of anti-smoking 
initiatives, including the most aggressive anti-smoking campaign in 
the history of this nation, this plan, in short, will get big tobacco 
off the backs of our kids. President Clinton is praising the settlement 
as an important step forward in the battle to stop teen smoking. The 
White House says enacting national tobacco legislation will be one 
of the administration's top priorities in the next Congress.
