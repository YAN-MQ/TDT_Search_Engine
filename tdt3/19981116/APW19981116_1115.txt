Italy's highest appeals court on Monday upheld the life sentences 
of two ex-Nazis convicted of helping carry out a World War II massacre 
of civilians in Rome. A military court last year convicted Erich Priebke, 
an-83-year-old former SS captain, and ex-SS Maj. Karl Haas for their 
roles in the 1944 massacre of 335 people at the Ardeatine Caves on 
the outskirts of Rome during the German occupation of the capital. 
The massacre was retaliation for a bombing by Italian resistance fighters 
that killed 33 German soldiers. Both men said in their trial that 
they were following orders from Adolf Hitler and had no other choice.
