Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is threatening to suspend 
the troop pull-back in the West Bank until Palestinians drop plans 
to declare unilateral independence in may. Netanyahu made the announcement 
in a speech to parliament that began a Two-day debate on the agreement, 
under which Israel is to withdraw from 13% of the West Bank by the 
end of January. Netanyahu is upset over recent remarks by Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat, who has renewed a pledge to declare statehood 
in may. Palestinians say Israel is looking for any excuse to delay 
implementation of the new mideast peace deal.
