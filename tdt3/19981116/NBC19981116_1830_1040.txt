On NBC news "in depth," America pulls bag from the brink coming in 
within minutes of unleashing an attack on Saddam Hussein. Since the 
gulf war, there have been three attacks on Iraq by the U.S. and its 
allies. But there also have been three massive military buildups, 
each one ultimately called off. The first two ended when Saddam backed 
down. Then the ultimate tactic, removing Saddam from power. It's been 
tried again and again. What about the future? Here's Jim Miklaszewski 
"in depth." He didn't call off the entire war. In fact, he pledged 
to step up U.S. efforts to drive Saddam Hussein from power. But it's 
not the first time the U.S. has tried. Intelligence sources tell NBC 
news that in the seven years since the end of the gulf war, the U.S. 
government has had at least six covert operations undertaken against 
Saddam, two described as serious. All met with failure or disaster. 
In all, more than 4,000 dissidents have been killed by Saddam. Two 
years ago, a group of Kurdish dissidents working for the CIA were 
wiped out. According to sources, one of the most promising efforts 
was to penetrate the upper ranks of Saddam's military, to convince 
Iraqi officers to launch a coup against Saddam. The effort ultimately 
failed because the Iraqi general didn't trust the U.S. to follow through. 
Other attempts have also failed. Propaganda campaigns against Saddam 
and his inner circle, disinformation intended to create distrust and 
dissention, the U.S. is prepared to try again. President Clinton and 
Congress have agreed to spend $97 million on Iraqi opposition groups 
in an effort to overthrow Saddam. And the people in Iraq are the ones 
who count, and they are ready to move against Saddam. But Iraqi opposition 
remains divided and may not be able to mount any real threat to Saddam. 
The Iraqi opposition is very splintered. No one should think that 
that's a quick solution to the problem of removing saddam Hussein. 
Many fear this latest effort is also doomed to failure. According 
to one senior Pentagon official, the $97 million earmarked for iraqi 
opposition is only enough to "arm them, train them and get them killed." 
Ultimately, critics claim, the failure to oust Saddam lies not with 
Iraqi opposition, but with the lack of coherent White House strategy. 
It's not whether or not we can build an opposition. The real crisis 
is that there's a hollowness in our policy. Many at the Pentagon tonight 
believed when President Clinton called off airstrikes, he may have 
missed the best chance in years to get saddam. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC 
news, the Pentagon.
