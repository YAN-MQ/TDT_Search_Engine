The Food and Drug Administration warned today, that a new drug given 
to patients with Parkinson's Disease may cause fatal liver damage. 
NPR's John Hamilton has more. The drug is called Tasmar. And it was 
approved by the FDA in January. Tasmar doesn't treat Parkinson's Disease 
directly. Instead it helps other drugs for Parkinson's work better 
to control muscle weakness and tremor caused by the disease. About 
sixty thousand people worldwide have used Tasmar. But in recent months, 
doctors have reported three deaths from liver failure associated with 
the drug. So the FDA has sent a letter to physicians. Warning them 
to use the drug only for people who can't use other treatments. The 
Agency also told doctors to let patients know about the drug's potential 
risks. And to take patients off Tasmar if they show signs of liver 
problems. FDA officials say people already taking the drug shouldn't 
stop without first consulting a doctor. John Hamilton, NPR News.
