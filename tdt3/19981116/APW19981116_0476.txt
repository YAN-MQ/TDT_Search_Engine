KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Monday 
indirectly supported a burgeoning reform movement in Malaysia which 
has called for greater political freedoms and an end to Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule. Gore, in a speech to leaders of some 
of the world's largest corporations, said that robust global markets 
depend on freedom and democracy. ``History has taught us that freedom 
_ economic, political and religious freedom _ unlocks a higher fraction 
of the human potential than any other way of organizing society,'' 
said Gore, who stepped in for President Bill Clinton at the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation summit. Clinton canceled his visit to Malaysia 
to remain in Washington and deal with the U.S.-Iraqi standoff. The 
ouster of Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his subsequent 
arrest and beating while in police custody outraged world leaders. 
Anwar is standing trial on 10 charges of corruption and sexual misconduct, 
allegations he denies and calls trumped up to undermine his challenge 
to Mahathir. A series of violent demonstrations have rocked the normally 
placid capital for the first time in three decades. ``From Thailand 
to South Korea, Eastern Europe to Mexico, democracies have done better 
in coping with economic crises than nations where freedom is suppressed,'' 
Gore said. ``And so, among nations suffering economic crises, we continue 
to hear calls for democracy and reform in many languages. People's 
power, doi moi, reformasi. We hear them today _ right here, right 
now _ among the brave people of Malaysia.'' ``Reformasi,'' or reform 
in the Malay language, has become the battle cry of the anti-government 
movement here. It was the same chant used during the massive riots 
and student demonstrations in neighboring Indonesia, a movement that 
led to the end of President Suharto's 32-year rule. On Sunday, U.S. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met privately with Anwar's wife, 
Azizah Ismail, to express U.S. concern over her husband's case. For 
the first time since APEC summits began in 1993, human rights concerns 
have been widely discussed by the leaders, whose goal is to promote 
free trade in the region. During his meeting with Mahathir on Monday, 
Australian Prime Minister John Howard expressed concern about Anwar's 
treatment and trial. And New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley 
said she planned to do that on Tuesday. Gore and Canadian Prime Minister 
Jean Chretien have refused to meet privately with Mahathir because 
of the Anwar affair. At the end of his speech, however, Gore returned 
to the head table and shook hands with the Malaysian prime minister.
