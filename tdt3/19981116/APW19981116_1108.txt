In another sign of the widening gulf between rich and poor in European 
soccer, English giant Manchester United has reached a deal to use 
Belgium's oldest team, Royal Antwerp, as a feeder club for young talent 
and plans similar moves in Ireland, Sweden and Australia. Under the 
arrangement, United will cull young players from around the world, 
especially Argentina, send them to Antwerp for a few years of grooming 
and bring them to Manchester once they are ready for the Premier League. 
``The young players of Manchester United will get more experience 
at Antwerp,'' said Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. European 
soccer's governing body UEFA and the Belgian federation all expressed 
concerns Monday about such deals effectively turn smaller leagues 
and clubs into pawns for the bigger ones. ``We have to face reality,'' 
Royal Antwerp secretary Paul Bistiaux said. ``The smaller clubs have 
to align themselves with the big ones to survive. It's either sink 
or swim.'' Antwerp, Belgium's oldest club and a European Cup Winners 
Cup finalist at Wembley only five years ago, was demoted to the Belgian 
second division this year. It is now resigned to being at the disposal 
of Manchester United. ``Manchester United was looking for a pied-a-terre 
on the continent,'' Bistiaux said in an interview with The Associated 
Press. ``It's clear Manchester United is the strongest party in this. 
They'll be calling the shots.'' Fritz Ahlstrom, a spokesman for UEFA, 
expressed reservations about the deal. ``In principle, we don't like 
it,'' he said. ``There might be more disadvantages than advantages 
to this.'' ``What happens if Royal Antwerp creates talent, develops 
it into key players, and then is forced to let them go to sit on the 
bench in Manchester?'' Ahlstrom asked. ``We don't like the key players 
in some leagues to be on the bench in others.'' For Belgian Federation 
President Michel D'Hooghe, the issue is about the increasingly lopsided 
financial situation in European soccer, creating a two-tier system 
where the poor are at the beck and call of the wealthy clubs. ``Healthy 
clubs would not want to do so,'' he said. ``The big leagues are not 
charity institutions. Most of the time the clubs targeted are in a 
tough financial and sporting position.'' For a giant like Manchester 
United, it is only the first step. ``This is just part of the expansion 
plan,'' said Ferguson. ``There will be deals with clubs in Australia, 
Ireland and Sweden.'' He did not elaborate. Royal Antwerp is not the 
only Belgian club being approached by a foreign suitor. Germinal Ekeren, 
a small first-division club, is in talks with Ajax Amsterdam for a 
possible cooperation pact. For FIFA too, such deals raise the specter 
of common ownership conflicts of interest. ``We have to wait and see 
what such cooperation entails,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. 
UEFA is also concerned about what would happen if Antwerp rises to 
the top of Belgian soccer again and is drawn against Manchester in 
European competition. No worry for the time being though, Bistiaux 
said. `It is theoretically possible, but it will take a while,'' he 
said. Antwerp was a prime target for Manchester United because Belgian 
labor laws and work permits are far more flexible than in England, 
Bistiaux said. Once the players are established in the European Union, 
it is easier for them to transfer to Manchester United.
