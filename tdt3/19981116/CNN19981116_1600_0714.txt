First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is getting a first-hand look at 
the devastation from hurricane Mitch. She's visiting Honduras and 
Nicaragua today to check out relief efforts and to see what still 
needs to be done. The biggest challenge facing relief efforts is a 
lack of bridges. Dozens of bridges were lost in the aftermath of Mitch. 
Without road access, the government is flying in emergency food and 
medicine, and that is expensive and inefficient. U.S. Marines and 
army corps of engineers personnel are headed to Honduras to help build 
bridges.
