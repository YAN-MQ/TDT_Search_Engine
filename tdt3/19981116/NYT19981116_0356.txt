Stock prices rose Monday, pushing at least one key measure to a level 
not seen since late July, on hopes that the Federal Reserve Board 
would lower interest rates at a policy-making meeting in Washington 
Tuesday. Optimism about another cut in the overnight federal funds 
rate persists even though recent data show the economy remains healthy. 
``I think equity investors are conditioned for a friendly Fed policy,'' 
said Bob Gasser, head of block trading at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. Though 
improved, ``fixed-income markets are still suffering from a lack of 
liquidity,'' he added. Stocks were also helped Monday by news of a 
new Japanese stimulus plan, this one a huge $195 billion package of 
tax cuts, spending and lending measures intended to help ratchet the 
world's second-largest economy out of a deep malaise. Stocks opened 
sharply higher, lost much of their gains by early afternoon and then 
had a late rally. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was 
up 91.66 points, or 1.03 percent, at 9,011.25. It was the blue-chip 
average's first close above 9,000 since July 30. Despite its sharp 
plunge in August and September, the Dow average is now up nearly 14 
percent this year. Broader market indexes also advanced. The Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.15 points, or 0.9 percent, 
to 1,135.87. The Nasdaq composite index rose 13.69 points, or 0.74 
percent, to 1,861.68. And the Russell 2000 index of mostly small-capitalization 
companies gained 1.06, or 0.27 percent, to 390.42. Expectations of 
another rate cut helped push up shares of banks and other financial 
service companies. And the possibility that Japan and Asia might be 
over the worst of their problems helped buoy big exporters and multinational 
companies. ``The Japanese have always believed that no action is better 
than lots of action, but they are moving fast,'' said Jack Shaughnessy, 
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. Toting up all the stimulative 
measures Tokyo has announced this year, Shaughnessy said the amount 
equaled ``more than 7 percent of their gross domestic product.'' ``That 
is a big number,'' he said. ``They are hyperactive now.'' Among financial 
stocks, Merrill Lynch rose 1 1/2, to 63 1/2. American Express, a Dow 
stock, gained 2 3/8, to 96 15/16. And J.P. Morgan, another Dow stock, 
closed at 103 1/2, up 1 5/8. While economic data seem to argue against 
a rate cut, another such move would be consistent with recent actions 
by other central banks. Since the start of November, monetary authorities 
in 13 countries have moved to lower interest rates, analysts at the 
ISI Group noted in a letter to clients Monday. Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing, a big exporter, was the Dow's biggest gainer Monday, 
rising 3 3/8, to 80 5/16. Other big exporters and multinational companies 
also did well. General Electric was up 2, to 90 3/16. Intel gained 
3 1/8, to 106 7/8. And communication equipment makers rose on expectations 
that a revived Japanese economy might increase Asian demand for their 
products. Cisco Systems rose 2 1/4, to 66 15/16. And Lucent Technologies 
was up 1 1/2, to 85 1/8. ``There would be a pullback in the market 
if the Fed does not vote to ease,'' Shaughnessy said, ``and the need 
is not as compelling as it was a month ago. ``But if they don't go 
in November, I think they will move in December, and again in January.''
