Thousands of people line the streets of New York to honor the world's 
oldest astronaut, John Glenn. During a traditional ticker-tape parade, 
Glenn and his fellow astronauts rode up the Canyon of Heroes in downtown 
Manhattan. In the speech to the crowd, Glenn said his flight is an 
example of what older people can achieve. All the old people have 
just as many hopes and dreams and ambitions as anyone else. And maybe 
this flight can help encourage them to exercise their own talents, 
their own capabilities. And do some of these things that they otherwise 
might not have done. A hero's welcome in New York for a veteran astronaut, 
John Glenn. Four million turned out in below freezing temperatures 
to welcome his back from his first trip into space in 1962, in the 
largest ticker-tape parade ever.
