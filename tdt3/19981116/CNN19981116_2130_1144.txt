"Headline Sports" is straight ahead. And coming up -- actress Jennifer 
love Hewitt moves from the big screen to the recording studio. Hi, 
I'm expecting a fax. Room 212 wants the ammunition to deal with her 
toughest clients. Nothing? Davies, 212. I called earlier. Right, fax. 
It hasn't come yet. I need it for a meeting. Excuse me, miss Davies? 
It just came in. Thank you, so much. Good morning, everyone. Business 
services by Marriott. MCI five cent sundays. Five... Daffy: cut! I 
need passion. Depth. I need intensity. MCI five cent sundays. Five 
cents a minute. Every... cut! Sunday. Think big. Think Shakespeare! 
"Five cents a minute! Every Sunday!" Five thenth a minute. Every thunday. 
I ask for an actor. They send a comedian. Call 1-800-sundays to become 
an MCI customer. Again. Call 1-800... With "CNN Headline Sports," 
I'm Russell Biven.
