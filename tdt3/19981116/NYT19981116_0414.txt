NEW YORK _ A Rising Designer Australian fashion was as oxymoronic 
a concept as purple oranges, until Richard Tyler came on the scene 
almost a decade ago; this year, the Australians invited Americans 
to attend the third Australian fashion week. Among the most important 
finds there was Akira Isogawa, 33, whose clothes were of a startling 
quantity for an unknown. Isogawa, whose collection is now at Barneys 
New York, makes wonderfully creative, feminine dresses and sportswear 
with avant-garde cuts and unusual juxtapositions of fabric. A calico 
top is trimmed with a jewel-color fringe of pleated silk, which Isogawa 
rescued from old kimonos in his native Japan. Gutsy, navy silk trousers 
cut like pajamas have a deep waistband of white elastic. Prices range 
from about $125 for a sleeveless nylon top to $2,252 for a gown of 
calico with Japanese art motifs beaded and embroidered by hand in 
silver and gold. A lining of brilliant red jacquard silk is visible 
on the dress' semicircular train. Isogawa emigrated from Japan to 
Sydney 11 years ago, and his designs bear traces of his homeland. 
``There is some element of Japanese in all my collections,'' said 
Isogawa, who was in New York last week. Barneys will carry the collection 
exclusively in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Bringing Isogawa's 
work to Barneys was one of the last important decisions that Bonnie 
Pressman, former executive vice president for women's wear, made before 
leaving to join Ralph Lauren this summer. Julie Gilhart, the vice 
president of women's wear at Barneys, accompanied Ms. Pressman on 
the trip to Australia in May. ``We were so blown away by his show,'' 
she said. ``We didn't expect to see something up to this stature.'' 
An Uptown Cousin Intermix, which revived hip, affordable designer 
shopping downtown five years ago and was beaten uptown by boutiques 
like Scoop and Olive &AMP; Bette, is fighting back. Last Thursday, 
Intermix opened a store at 1003 Madison Ave. (77th Street). Its original 
store is at 125 Fifth Ave. (19th Street) in the Flatiron district. 
The new store is carrying the heart of the downtown boutique's look, 
with designers like Daryl K., Vivienne Tam and Andasimo, and handbags 
by Kate Spade. But it is lacking Rodney Walker, its celebrated salesman, 
who moved on earlier this year to Untitled, a downtown store. In addition, 
the uptown Intermix will carry new lines, like Elspeth Gibson, Martin 
Margiela's Six, Clements Ribiero and Catherine by Catherine Malandrino, 
and will have a shoe department featuring the designs of English designer 
Jimmy Choo. The uptown store is a bit higher-end than its downtown 
cousin, but Khajak Keldjian, who with his brother Haro owns the two 
stores here, as well as two in Japan, would rather not promote the 
differences. ``We're really not about being a designer store,'' he 
said. ``We're still about introducing new designers. Uptown, we are 
trying to keep things a little bit different because the customer 
is a little different. Downtown is a little hipper. It's more cutting 
edge. Uptown we're trying to keep the same feeling with a little more 
femininity.''
