Good evening. The United States is no longer rushing forces to the 
Persian gulf. The world is watching very closely to see what happens 
now. Is the world finally going to get what it wants from Saddam Hussein? 
And will the economic sanctions against Iraq be lifted? It was very 
close this weekend. An awful lot of people almost got killed. First, 
from Baghdad itself, ABC's Morton dean. The workers who administer 
the U.N. humanitarian programs began returning to Iraq today. We're 
happy to be back. Their return is noncontroversial and welcome here. 
But the arms inspectors will be greeted by a familiar sight. The banners 
vilifying them are still very visible across from the U.N. compound's 
main entrance. In the compound, preparations were being made today 
so that the inspectors can quickly resume their work. Monitoring equipment, 
unchecked for weeks. The U.N. has said it will begin suriab sites 
the kind of inspections that frequently had led to confrontations. 
I think you will see fairly large, very intrusive inspection teams 
going into some fairly sensitive sites very early on. Most importantly, 
the inspectors will demand hundreds of documents. According to the 
U.N., one document provides a detailed account of Iraq's chemical 
weapons program. U.N. inspectors say they saw the document in July, 
but Iraq refused to provide a copy. Other documents are believed to 
describe Iraq's biological weapons programs. This information exists. 
It's in the possession of the government of Iraq. It's their call. 
They can either give it to us or not, and I honestly hope they do. 
Of course, the big question is what happens if history repeats itself 
and Iraq refuses to honor any of those requests? Morton dean, ABC 
News, Baghdad.
