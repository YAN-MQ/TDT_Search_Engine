Today, eight different states reached a $206 billion settlement with 
cigarette makers. It's hoped 31 other states will also get on board. 
Those who filed suit could pay millions of dollars up front to reimburse 
medicaid costs for treating smokers medically. They would stop advertising 
on billboards, city buses, and T-shirts. The deal is not as strict 
as a national proposal that died in Congress. There's no provision 
granting the F.D.A. to regulate to tobacco as a drug.
