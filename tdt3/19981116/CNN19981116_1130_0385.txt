Eight state attorneys general are expected to make a formal announcement 
this afternoon in Washington on the proposed $206 billion tobacco 
settlement. The agreement was reached Saturday with the nation's four 
biggest tobaccomakers. The plan would settle state claims that seek 
government health costs for treating smoking-related illnesses. In 
exchange, tobacco companies would be free from financial and legal 
threats if they lose a court case to one or more of the 46 states 
that have lawsuits pending or have not filed suits yet.
