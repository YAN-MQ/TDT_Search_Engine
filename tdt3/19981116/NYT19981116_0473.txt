Minot K. Milliken, who was treasurer and chief financial officer of 
Milliken &AMP; Co., the country's largest privately owned textile 
company, died at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York on Saturday 
after a three-month illness, his eldest son, M.K. Milliken, said. 
He was 82 and lived in New York City. Milliken, who was born in New 
York City, graduated from Princeton University in 1937 and worked 
for 50 years until his retirement in 1996 at Milliken &AMP; Co., which 
his grandfather, Seth Milliken, founded in 1865. He also served on 
the boards of National Distillers, Mercantile Stores, the Irving Bank 
of New York and Union Pacific Railroad. He was chairman of the board 
of the Boys Club of New York for many years. In 1979, Milliken was 
president of the board of his Manhattan cooperative building, at 19 
East 72nd St., when former President Richard Nixon sought to buy a 
nine-room penthouse in the building. Although Nixon's application 
was at first unofficially approved by the cooperative's board, many 
residents objected, complaining that his presence would attract unwelcome 
attention. In the end, Milliken announced that Nixon had withdrawn 
his application. Milliken is survived by his wife, Armene L., of New 
York; five children, M.K., of Baltimore, Christopher C., of Lake Forest, 
Ill., Alexander F., of Santa Fe, N.M., Seth M., of Salisbury, Conn., 
and Daphne Milliken Webbe of Vail, Colo.; 13 grandchildren; and one 
great-grandson.
