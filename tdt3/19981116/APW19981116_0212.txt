A former Russian defense minister blamed President Boris Yeltsin on 
Monday for the decline of Russia's military. ``I came to the conclusion 
that Yeltsin, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, doesn't understand 
many issues relating to the national defense, doesn't want to understand 
them and isn't paying any attention to them at all,'' said former 
Defense Minister Igor Rodionov. Rodionov was testifying before the 
parliamentary committee that is trying to impeach Yeltsin. Impeachment 
supporters accuse Yeltsin of destroying Russia's armed forces, instigating 
the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, illegally sending troops and 
tanks against his foes in the previous parliament in 1993, and launching 
the unsuccessful war in separatist Chechnya. The impeachment motion 
is unlikely to succeed. It would need a two-thirds majority to pass 
in both the upper and lower houses of parliament, and would require 
approval by both the Constitutional and Supreme Courts. Yeltsin fired 
Rodionov in May 1997 over his failure to make radical cuts in Russia's 
military. Rodionov said Monday that all of Russia's armed forces except 
for the Strategic Rocket Forces are ``in stagnation.'' He accused 
Yeltsin of ignoring his attempts to bring the military back into shape. 
Rodionov also denounced a government drive to persuade the lower house 
of parliament, the State Duma, to ratify the START II arms control 
treaty. Ratification of the U.S.-Russian treaty would be ``a betrayal 
of Russia,'' Rodionov said, according to the Interfax news agency. 
``Russia still has time to leave the START II treaty unilaterally.'' 
The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996, but Russian hard-line 
opponents have stalled on ratification. They say the treaty would 
deprive Russia of its last remaining military strength _ its nuclear 
stockpiles.
