Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri arrived here Monday on a visit 
aimed at expanding ties between Lebanon and Iran, the official Islamic 
Republic News Agency reported. Iranian Vice President Hassan Habibi 
received Hariri at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport, the agency said. Hariri 
then left to meet with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. During 
his visit, he is also expected to hold talks with Habibi and former 
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who heads an influential advisory council. 
Hariri told reporters at the airport that during his visit he will 
be looking into ways of expanding ties with Iran and discussing regional 
developments with Iranian officials. Hariri said that ties between 
Lebanon and Iran were growing and that the two countries consult each 
other regularly, the agency said. Hariri, a Sunni Muslim backed by 
Syria and Saudi Arabia, had been at odds with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, 
or Party of God. The Shiite Muslim guerrilla group has been leading 
the campaign to drive Israeli forces from an enclave they occupy in 
southern Lebanon. Hariri's government has been concerned as well about 
Shiite Iran's influence over Lebanese Shiites, who make up more than 
one-third of Lebanon's 3.2 million people.
