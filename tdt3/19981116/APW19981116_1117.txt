Russia has fewer than 20 telephone lines for every 100 people _ half 
that of leading industrialized nations _ and the economic crisis has 
stalled efforts to expand services, Russia's communications chief 
said Monday. Foreign investment in the country's outdated, dilapidated 
telephone networks has plunged to dlrs 400 million this year from 
dlrs 820 million last year, Alexander Krupnov, chairman of the State 
Communications Committee, was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying. 
He said many Russian communications companies had been brought to 
the brink of bankruptcy by the country's latest economic troubles. 
While Russia's phone lines have not been upgraded in years and have 
been slow to extend to the more distant reaches of the world's largest 
country, mobile phone companies have enjoyed widespread success. More 
than 1 million people in Russia now use cellular phones or pagers, 
Krupnov said.
