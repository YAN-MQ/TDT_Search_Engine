Acknowledging that it did not know the scope of housing discrimination 
around the country, the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
announced Monday that it planned to conduct a nationwide investigation 
of the problem. Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the department 
learned of discrimination only through anecdote or in complaints to 
the agency. The investigation, he said, will be the department's first 
formal effort to find out how many people are affected, who and where 
they are, and how they are victimized. ``We don't have a good sense 
of the systemic or institutional discrimination that exists,'' Cuomo 
said at a news conference. ``Therefore, this will be the most comprehensive 
national study ever taken.'' The survey is being conducted now, Cuomo 
said, because department lawyers have had to respond to a steady increase 
in housing discrimination complaints in recent years _ about 70 a 
month now, or double the number in the first term of the Clinton administration. 
Cuomo conceded that department officials did not know whether this 
increase reflected a rise in discriminatory practices by lenders and 
housing officials or whether other federal initiatives to fight housing 
discrimination had emboldened more victims to complain. So far as 
department officials have determined, the number of fair-housing complaints 
increased 40 percent, to about 10,500 a year, from 1990 to 1995 and 
has held steady since then. The figure reflects complaints not only 
to the Federal housing department but also to state and local governments. 
Cuomo described housing discrimination as ``more sophisticated, less 
obvious, but more insidious'' than other kinds of bias against minority 
groups, whose members are less likely to be homeowners than are whites. 
Recent studies by the housing department found that while home ownership 
in the United States had reached a record level, about 67 percent, 
the rate among whites (72.5 percent) was much higher than the black 
and Hispanic rates (45.3 percent and 43.9 percent, respectively). 
``If we don't solve this issue, this nation is in trouble long-term, 
I'm convinced of it,'' Cuomo said of the disparity. The department 
plans to have the survey conducted by an outside firm, using as many 
as 5,000 tests involving sets of prospective white and nonwhite home 
buyers or renters seeking access to the same property. Cuomo said 
this process would help the agency discover any patterns of illegal 
or unethical behavior _ for instance, whether banks will qualify a 
white applicant seeking a mortgage but not a black applicant with 
a similar financial background. It is also expected to show whether 
apartment applicants are ``steered'' toward one area or another depending 
on their race or ethnicity, and whether questionable practices occur 
more often in cities or in rural areas. In addition, the secretary 
said, the survey results will locate areas of the country where questionable 
practices are most common. The department intends to spend $7.5 million 
for the survey, as part of its current $40 million fair-housing budget. 
Cuomo said he expected to award the project soon, with the results 
following in about a year.
