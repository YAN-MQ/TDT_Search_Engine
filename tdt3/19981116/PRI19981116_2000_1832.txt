Controversy is broken out in Malaysia following a speech by Vice President 
Al Gore. He's there attending the Apex Summit. Mr. Gore expressed 
support for the country's reform movement. Malaysia's trade minister, 
Rafita Aziz said it's the most disgusting speech she's ever heard. 
Simon Ingram reports. Malaysia's newly born protest movement had been 
counting on the Apex meeting to highlight their grievances and their 
demands for change. But they can hardly have expected the resounding 
endorsement handed to them by U.S. Vice President Al Gore. In a banquet 
address, Mr. Gore delivered an eloquent tribute to democratic values. 
He said that among nations currently in economic turmoil, calls for 
democracy were being heard. "We hear them today," he continued. " 
Right here, right now, among the brave people of Malaysia." Simon 
Ingram, BBC, Quadalumpa.
