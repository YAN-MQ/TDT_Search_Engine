An Australian man who received a transplanted hand and forearm in 
France seven weeks ago has begun moving each finger of the donor hand 
and is gaining function with surprising swiftness, his doctors said 
last week. They said that so far the man, Clint Hallam, had not shown 
any signs of rejection and had escaped adverse effects of potent immune-suppressing 
drugs. A rejection reaction can occur at any time in someone who has 
received another person's tissue. If such a reaction occurs in Hallam, 
his doctors said, they are confident they can control it with standard 
drugs. Hallam, 48, is ``far ahead of schedule, doing superbly and 
better than any of us ever would have hoped,'' said Dr. Earl Owen, 
an Australian microsurgeon who headed the international team that 
performed the transplant. ``Psychologically, he is on top of the world,'' 
Owen said. Much of Hallam's early success is because of the prescribed 
intense exercise program he performed on the muscles of his handless 
right arm in the year preceding the operation. The muscles of both 
forearms were equally strong when the transplant was performed at 
Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyons on Sept. 23, and remain strong with 
twice-a-day physical therapy, Owen said. It will take at least a year 
to determine whether nerve regeneration will allow Hallam to feel 
hot, cold, touch and other sensations in his new hand. Reimplanting 
hands and arms _ as opposed to what was done here _ has become standard 
surgery in many hospitals. ``If he was a replant, then I would say 
well he is one of the best replants we have ever had,'' said Owen, 
who is a leader in such surgery. ``But he is a transplant, so that 
is even better.'' Hallam can bend each finger about 25 degrees and 
then straighten it, Owen and Dr. Xavier R. Martin, a member of the 
transplant team in Lyons, said in separate telephone interviews. Hallam 
``can make the beginning of a grip and can move his whole wrist around 
in a circle, which is very very good at this stage,'' Owen said. Speaking 
from Lyons, Martin said Hallam can turn his hand so the palm faces 
down ``quite well.'' ``When we did the operation everybody was saying 
we would have rejection of the donor skin within two weeks'' because 
transplanting skin is considered the hardest immunological barrier 
to overcome, Martin said. ``It did not happen and we are optimistic. 
A previous attempt at such a transplant failed in 1964 in Ecuador. 
Hallam ``thinks he can feel his thumb, but he thought he could feel 
his thumb before he had his new hand put on because of the phantom 
limb phenomenon,'' Owen said by telephone in a brief visit to Chicago. 
Hallam has said he occasionally felt a pins and needles sensation 
in his new hand. But standard medical tests such as pricking the skin 
with a pin show Hallam has no feeling. ``We have a hard time imagining 
he can feel with the tip of his fingers because he cannot _ it is 
not possible the nerves can grow so fast,'' Martin said. Doctors have 
taken a small amount of skin from the grafted forearm above the wrist 
at least once a week since the operation. A local anesthetic has not 
been needed, as would be essential in performing such biopsies on 
a person with intact sensation, Martin said. The biopsies are performed 
to monitor rejection. ``There has never been the slightest hint of 
any rejection'' and the doctors have lowered the number and amount 
of anti-rejection drugs Hallam receives, Owen said. Experts have warned 
that Hallam may not regain sensation and may be left with little more 
than a useless hand. But, Owen said, feeling in the hand is not necessary 
to make a grip or move a hand because the nerves controlling the muscles 
carrying out such motor functions are in the upper third of the arm, 
which he already had. Hallam says the hand, from an anonymous donor, 
seems like his own hand and not someone else's, Owen said. ``When 
he gives a message from his brain, his muscles work because they are 
the same muscles he has had all his life,'' Owen said. ``They pull 
tendons, which are somebody else's tendons, but he thinks they are 
his because his finger moves.'' Owen described Hallam as calm, a trait 
``honed in a jail for years.'' Owen was referring to a jail in New 
Zealand where, in 1984, Hallam, who was serving time in a fraud case, 
severed his forearm in an accident with a circular saw. It was replanted, 
but had to be amputated in 1989. Hallam's wife and four children have 
joined him in Lyons. He will stay there at least another month before 
returning to Australia where newspapers have reported that he is due 
in court in Perth to face fraud charges. Owen predicted that ``an 
insurance assessment at a year from now will say that he has a 75 
percent recovery of the full use of his hand.''
