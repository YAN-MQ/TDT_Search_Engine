As U.N. personnel start filtering back into Iraq, President Clinton 
again is warning Baghdad that U.S. forces remain strong and ready 
to attack if it fails to follow through on its promises. Baghdad has 
pledged to fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors in their search of 
suspected weapons sites. 30 U.N. relief workers arrived today at a 
U.S. military base near Baghdad. The weapons inspectors are expected 
back tomorrow and should resume their work a day later. Gary Tuchman 
has more. When UNSCOM inspectors go back to work on Wednesday, their 
first duty will be examining their hundreds of monitoring cameras 
and making sure they're working and pointing in the right direction. 
Only after the monitoring is once again under way will it be time 
for more intrusive inspections. Iraq's ambassador claims his government 
welcomes the inspectors back. At least on our side of the commitment, 
Iraq intends to honor its commitment. But we'll have to see how the 
other party, how UNSCOM will be reacting. UNSCOM's deputy executive 
director is Charles duelfer. We're going to be conducting our work 
in the same professional, calm way we have in the past. If we come 
across a site Iraq considers sensitive, it will be discussed between 
the two, but we need the access to give the assurances the council 
has asked us for. Given the history of Iraq's record here, one has 
to wonder whether they have turned over a new leaf. We hope they have. 
UNSCOM says it will ask Iraq to provide sensitive documents, including 
one inspectors were not allowed to examine after they had discovered 
it last summer. It's a document that has an inventory of munitions, 
including special munitions, which in our jargon is chemical weapons. 
UNSCOM says that particular document can help assess whether chemical 
weapons Iraq made have now been accounted for. All 15 security council 
members condemned Iraq for not cooperating with uNSCOM inspectors. 
But while the Russians agree that cooperation is essential, Moscow's 
U.N. ambassador says UNSCOM should make sure it respects the sovereignty 
and dignity of Iraq, something the weapons inspectors say they always 
have done. Gary Tuchman, CNN, the U.N.
