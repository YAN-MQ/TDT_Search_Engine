Gardeners know valerian as a hardy perennial with fernlike leaves 
and pinkish white flowers considered excellent for cutting. Herbalists 
value its carrot-shaped root, which some call nature's valium, believing 
it delivers relief for a variety of complaints like shingles and menstrual 
cramps, even though it smells like dirty socks. But for a 58-year-old 
North Carolina heart patient, one of a growing number of consumers 
who combine such ``natural'' products with prescription drugs, the 
self-administered treatment led to unexpected cardiac complications 
and delirium after a surgical biopsy of a lung nodule. The problem 
was not that he had taken valerian, but that he had stopped. Unexpected 
withdrawal symptoms put him in intensive care. The patient survived 
_ and no longer takes valerian for sleeplessness. Like prescription 
drugs, herbal products act as chemicals in the body and may cause 
the same kinds of side effects, withdrawal symptoms and interactions, 
warn the doctors who linked the heart patient's crisis to valerian. 
``A lot of people don't think of herbs as medicines,'' said Dr. P. 
Murali Doraiswamy of the Duke University Medical Center. ``People 
have a tendency not to attribute complications to herbal products. 
They are going to put the blame on prescriptions instead, but you 
don't know what combinations might be dangerous in herbal medicines. 
They haven't been tested.'' Doraiswamy is one of three Duke physicians 
who wrote a letter, appearing in the Nov. 11 issue of Journal of the 
American Medical Association, documenting the case. They urge that 
patients tell their doctors when they are taking herbal products, 
and that physicians ask. ``Some doctors don't like the question, because 
it opens a Pandora's box they don't know how to deal with,'' Doraiswamy 
said. ``No medical school in this country offered herbal medicine 
courses until a few years ago, and there's no Physicians' Desk Reference 
for herbal products.'' Herbal remedies are increasingly popular. The 
current issue of the Archives of Family Medicine offers a review of 
12 commonly used medicinal herbs and points out that more than one-third 
of Americans use herbs for health reasons but often lack information 
about their safety. Doraiswamy, the grandson of a doctor in India, 
grew up in a culture where patients expected to combine conventional 
and herbal treatments. But these days, he said, when he wants to know 
about herbal products he goes to the Internet, where he does a broad 
search and then ``evaluates the information skeptically.'' A Web search 
for data on widely used valerian reveals everything from botanical 
information to order forms. One site says valerian is ``one of the 
best herbal tranquilizers and muscle relaxants the plant kingdom has 
to offer,'' but warns that if taken regularly in tea, capsule or extract 
form, it can cause mild depression in some people. Depending on the 
site, viewers can find everything from claims that it is ``nature's 
answer to stress'' to warnings that it can cause vomiting, stupor 
and dizziness. Doraiswamy points out that valerian is not the only 
herb with possible side effects _ chamomile, commonly taken as a calming 
tea, causes hives in some people; licorice can cause hypertension. 
But herbal remedies still have a place. After all, Doraiswamy said, 
he grew up on ginger, an old sailors' remedy for vomiting and nausea. 
Now, it is finding new applications among cancer and AIDS patients.
