Hewlett-Packard Co. reported fourth-quarter earnings Monday that exceeded 
Wall Street analysts' estimates but said that revenue and growth in 
orders remained weak. In light of the sluggish sales, Hewlett-Packard 
officials attributed the unexpectedly strong earnings to the company's 
continuing cost-cutting efforts. The quarter was the first in many 
years in which expenses did not grow compared to the same period a 
year earlier. This was only the second time in 11 quarters that Hewlett-Packard 
earnings did not fall below the consensus estimate. For the quarter 
ended Oct. 31, Hewlett-Packard reported earnings of $710 million, 
or 68 cents a diluted share, a decline of 12 percent compared with 
$806 million, or 75 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue 
rose 4 percent, to $12.23 billion from $11.79 billion. Special charges 
of approximately $170 million, taken for voluntary severance programs 
and writedowns, reduced earnings by 11 cents a share. Without those 
charges, Hewlett-Packard earned 79 cents a share. Analysts estimated 
Hewlett-Packard would earn 74 cents a share, according to the First 
Call Corp., which tracks company earnings. Before Hewlett-Packard 
reported its results after the close of the market, its shares rose 
87.5 cents, to $66.125.The shares fell as low as $65.8125 in after-hours 
trading. ``I think they did the best they could given the circumstances, 
but it's still a very murky picture,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst 
with J.P. Morgan. ``They did a great job on expenses, and PC's didn't 
hurt them as much,'' he said, referring to previous quarters where 
Hewlett-Packard sold PC's at unprofitable prices to maintain market 
share. ``They need to emphasize product areas where they have higher 
gross margins.'' Together with unexpectedly strong results from the 
Intel Corp. and a predictably positive report from the Dell Computer 
Corp. last week, Hewlett-Packard's results point to a rejuvenated 
market for personal computers, analysts said. ``We finished the year 
with a reasonably good quarter, and we're pleased that, on an operating 
basis, earnings per share came in above analysts' consensus,'' Lewis 
E. Platt, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, said 
in a statement. ``Several businesses did quite well, especially laser 
jet printers and PC's,'' he said. `` However, our overall revenue 
growth remained sluggish, in part reflecting continued weakness in 
Asia and, more recently, in Latin America.'' Robert Wayman, Hewlett-Packard's 
chief financial officer, added in a telephone conference call with 
analysts: ``Many things went well, but top-line growth was weak. So 
we didn't take full advantage of significant progress in our cost 
structures.'' Order growth in the quarter was just 6 percent, compared 
with a 14 percent increase in the quarter a year earlier, he said. 
Wayman said Asia Pacific remained weak, with revenue in dollars down 
20 percent compared with results from the fourth quarter of 1997 and 
3 percent from the third quarter of 1998. The company also saw some 
softening of demand in the United States, where revenue growth was 
4 percent, compared with 17 percent in the quarter a year earlier 
and 9 percent in the third quarter. Demand also slackened in Latin 
America, he said. For the year, Hewlett-Packard reported earnings 
of $2.95 billion, or $2.77 a diluted share, a decline of 6 percent 
compared with $3.12 billion, or $2.95 a share, in 1997. Revenue increased 
10 percent, to $47.06 billion from $42.90 billion.
