Sending a shiver through many of South Africa's newsrooms, the country's 
Human Rights Commission said Monday that it would open an investigation 
into racism in the press and that it would use its powers of subpoena 
and arrest if need be. The chairman of the commission, Barney Pityana, 
said he hoped that the inquiry would ``generate debate and dialogue'' 
among South Africans about the nature, meaning and incidence of racism 
in South Africa. ``Racism is endemic in South African society,'' Pityana 
said. ``There is no reason to believe that the media are somehow insulated.'' 
But some editors warned that the inquiry was a carefully timed attempt 
to keep news organizations from criticizing President Nelson Mandela's 
government on the eve of national elections next year. Mandela and 
his deputy and likely successor, Thabo Mbeki, have repeatedly complained 
about the press, saying that the government's accomplishments get 
little attention while the country's problems are the subject of every 
headline. Indeed, the tension between the government and news organizations 
has often been severe. In a key speech last year, Mandela lashed out, 
saying the press exploited ``the dominant position it achieved as 
a result of the apartheid system, to campaign against both real change 
and the real agent of change, as represented by our movement.'' Some 
journalists said the commission's investigation was meant to harass 
those who covered news that put the government in a bad light. ``What 
this is _ is a kind of racial McCarthyism,'' said Philip van Niekerk, 
editor of the weekly Mail and Guardian, which has often written about 
corruption in government. ``They are putting the media on the defensive 
just as the election campaign gets under way.'' The commission said 
it began looking at the issue because of a request made by the Black 
Lawyers Association and the Association of Black Accountants for bias 
inquiries into two papers, including van Niekerk's Mail and Guardian. 
The groups pointed out that The Mail and Guardian had written 14 times 
about allegedly corrupt blacks but only four times about whites. The 
commission then said it had decided that the issue of journalistic 
racism was not confined to just two newspapers. Pityana dismissed 
any suggestion that the commission was acting in the government's 
interest. He said he believed news organizations would benefit from 
closer scrutiny so they could ``sharpen their capacity to be responsive 
to the needs of the people and reflect the true nature of South African 
society.'' Under apartheid all of the large news organizations were 
white-owned, but in recent years, with the breakup of South Africa's 
huge corporations, blacks have been able to buy large stakes in the 
press. The racial composition in newsrooms has been gradually changing, 
as it has in other industries. But most of the editors of large newspapers 
are white. Still, the outlets that reach the most South Africans are 
the government-owned radio and television stations. Pityana said the 
commissioners would study the issue and announce the details in January. 
But exactly how they intend to conduct the inquiry is unclear. He 
said he did not know whether they would examine racism in all aspects 
of the business, to include hiring practices, for example, as well 
as editorial content. Nor had the commission decided yet whether it 
would look at radio, television and print or just a particular portion 
of the news business. Pityana said that he hoped his group would be 
able to do its work with journalists' cooperation. The commission, 
while it can use subpoena and arrest to compel witnesses to testify, 
does not have the power to punish. But it can make recommendations 
to Parliament. ``The commission wishes to place on record that it 
is mindful of the implications of this exercise for press freedom,'' 
he said. ``We believe, however, that the best guarantor of press freedom 
is a society that respects human rights.'' Jake Moloi, president of 
the lawyers association, said he was pleased that the commission would 
cast its net wide. ``The newspapers are demoralizing blacks,'' he 
said, adding: ``If whites have done something, it's just reported. 
But if a black has done something they tell you on and on.'' He cited 
``things that are not even newsworthy but meant to denigrate us.'' 
Free-speech advocates said they would be watching the commission closely. 
Laura Pollecutt of the nonprofit Freedom of Expression Institute said 
she hoped it would restrict its work to ``a very scientific look at 
the content of the news.'' Raymond Louw, editor of the weekly newsletter 
Southern Africa Report, said the commission's decision was reminiscent 
of attempts by the Afrikaner-oriented apartheid government, when it 
first came to power, to investigate the English press for its ``lack 
of patriotism.'' Louw expressed concern about the inquiry's timing. 
``To operate in the first half of the year right over the election 
period means that we are going to have every politician who is criticized 
screaming, `Ah, it's not true, it's just racism.'''
