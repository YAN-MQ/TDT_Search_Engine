Smiling and looking relaxed, about 150 U.N. staff evacuated from Iraq 
last week for fear of U.S. missile attack left Monday to return to 
Baghdad. About 120 of them boarded four red and blue Iraqi buses laden 
with luggage to begin the 12-hour journey across the desert to the 
Iraqi capital, leaving at 11:10 a.m. (0910 gmt). Another 30, mostly 
senior U.N. humanitarian workers, were scheduled to depart around 
mid-day (1000 gmt) in a U.N.- chartered plane from Marka Airport in 
the outskirts of Amman. ``We are pleased to return to Iraq and we 
will resume our work as soon as we get there,'' said Abdullah Odeh, 
a Jordanian representative of the U.N. Development Program in Baghdad. 
``Any U.N. agent is happy to see that the crisis were resolved without 
any bloodshed,'' said Jurgen Lissner, UNDP's representative in Jordan 
as he bid farewell to the workers . The humanitarian workers were 
evacuated last Wednesday together with U.N. weapons inspectors as 
the United States and Britain continued a military buildup in the 
Gulf region in response to President Saddam Hussein's Oct. 31 decision 
to halt all cooperation with the world body's weapons inspectors Iraq 
on Saturday reversed its decision and said it was allowing the inspectors 
back, averting what looked like certain military strikes by the United 
States and Britain. The relief workers coordinate the U.N.-approved 
oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities 
of oil to buy needed food and medicine. Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions 
since it invaded Kuwait in 1990. Its latest tussle with the United 
Nations stems from its charges that the weapons inspectors were prolonging 
their work, thus delaying the lifting of the sanctions. The inspectors 
must verify that Iraq has dismantled all its mass-destruction weapons 
and long-range missiles before they can recommend the lifting of the 
sanctions to the United Nations.
