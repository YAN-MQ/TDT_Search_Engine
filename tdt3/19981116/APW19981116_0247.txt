Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said his country's remains 
opposed to any military strike on Iran after a meeting with President 
Hosni Mubarak on military cooperation with Egypt. Sergeyev's comment 
came a day after U.S. President Bill Clinton pulled back a threat 
to attack Iraq following Baghdad's agreeing to a resumption of U.N. 
arms inspections. But Clinton said an attack could still come if Iraq 
does not cooperate with arms inspectors. Sergeyev said that though 
Moscow opposed an attack, it also criticized Iraq for failing to cooperate 
with the inspectors and hoped Baghdad would now do so to end eight 
years of U.N. Security sanctions on Iraq. The United States and Britain 
threatened a military strike if Iraq did not reverse decisions made 
in August and October to limit the inspectors' work. Iraq relented 
on Saturday. Sergeyev told reporters that he is in Egypt to prepare 
for Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit early next year. No date 
has been set. He handed Mubarak a letter from Yeltsin. The defense 
minister did not give details on Russia's military cooperation with 
Egypt, but said Mubarak gave instructions so that meetings between 
the two countries' defense ministries would have positive results. 
Sergeyev later met with Defense Minister Mohammed Hussein Tantawi 
and visited a factory that manufactures gun barrels. In the U.N. Security 
Council, Russia, France and China have consistently taken a less strident 
stand on Iraq than the United States and Britain. Russia has called 
for an easing of economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 
invasion of Kuwait.
