And the last word, at least for today, from professor Stephen Jay 
Gould, who reminds us that, even in modern times, there have been 
millennium panics, when people believed that the end of the world 
was imminent. Probably the most famous, the most influential movement 
in America was centered in New York state in the 1830s when a former 
army officer was just absolutely certain from his readings of the 
apop lipps that the world was going to end very soon and he brought 
all his followers together, as often happens, and needless to say, 
it didn't which was called the great disappointment.
