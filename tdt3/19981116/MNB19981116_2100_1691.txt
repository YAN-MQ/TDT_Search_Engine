Thanks largely to the weather that Janice provided. 36 years after 
his first orbit, senator and astronaut John Glenn took another ride 
up the Canyon of heroes. Cheering crowds lined lower Broadway to honor 
the 77-year-old astronaut and his six fellow crew members and their 
families from the space shuttle discovery, who completed their historic 
nine-day mission earlier this month. Interesting footnote. The driver 
of the car, the son of the original police officer.
