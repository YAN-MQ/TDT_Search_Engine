This is The World. A co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and 
WGBH, Boston. It's Monday, November 16. I'm Lisa Mullins, in Boston. 
Today, if it almost came to war with Iraq, how close is it come to 
peace? And it's student versus soldier in Indonesian politics. DAVIE 
FORTUNAENWA Any country needs a military. And we need to have a disciplined 
and loyal military. The last thing we want, is a military that feels 
cornered. Also ahead, the citizens of Mexico City fight crime with 
armored cars and nasty looks. Dissuasive behavior means staring the 
would-be criminal down before he assaults you. First up, this news. 
From national public radio news in Washington. I'm Cory Flinthoff.
