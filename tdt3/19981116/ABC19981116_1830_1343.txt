This week, we're going to take "A closer look" at the millennium. 
There are 410 days left until the year 2000, if you think that is 
the millennium, and some do, some don't. in Jerusalem today, the Catholic 
patriarch said the church's celebration in the holy land would start 
in Bethlehem on Christmas eve next year and end in Bethlehem on January 
the 6th, 2001. You have to get used to hearing all these different 
dates, because there has been a very long debate about when one century 
ends and the other begins. Stephen Jay Gould, the zoologist, geologist, 
numerologist in this case, from Harvard, has quite a lot of debate 
in a book called, "questioning the millennium." 2000 or 2001? This 
is a debate that has been recorded at least the 1699, 1700 transitions 
in newspapers and magazines throughout the world. The man in the street 
has always preferred the zero, zero year. That is the folks who control 
official celebrations and publish the journals have always favored 
the zero one year. In the 20th century, all official celebrations 
were held in Jan 1901, not 1900. Even though people thought 1900 would 
be better, but all Ivy league presidents favored 1901. What's happening 
is interesting. There is no more distinction between -- ironically 
what will happen is the 20th century will have 99 years because it 
started when high culture was in control on Jan 1st, 1901. But it 
will end on January 1st, 2000.
