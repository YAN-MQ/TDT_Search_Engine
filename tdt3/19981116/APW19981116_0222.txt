German and French finance ministers met Monday to discuss strategy 
for boosting Europe's economy and for the introduction of the single 
currency, the euro, on Jan. 1. The talks, also attended by both countries' 
central bank chiefs, were the first in a regular series since the 
left took power in Germany following September elections. German Finance 
Minister Oskar Lafontaine has caused controversy with repeated calls 
for the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, to lower interest rates 
to spur the economy. But he has recently toned down his attacks, stressing 
the independence of the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank that 
will take over setting interest rates in 11 countries with the introduction 
of the euro. French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn has restrained 
himself in the interest rate debate. Speaking before Monday's talks 
outside Bonn, Lafontaine said the discussions would focus on economic 
and finance policy in light of the ``new challenges'' posed by the 
introduction of the euro and recent economic turmoil. Cooperation 
within the euro area is vital and ``it makes sense to start with France,'' 
he said. Lafontaine also moderated his calls for another pet project 
_ global cooperation to control swings in exchange rates of leading 
currencies. He has said he wants a joint proposal with Britain and 
France on financial system reforms. ``We can't shoot from the hip,'' 
he said, ``We will discuss the issue carefully.''
