Defense secretary William Cohen says Saddam Hussein won't be getting 
any more chances. Cohen also says the United States will not add to 
the military buildup in the Persian gulf. The 180 planes and 15 warships 
in the region will remain, and could strike iraq "on a moment's notice" 
if necessary. Others that have not reached the area could return home 
in a few days. Cohen says the wait is on to see if the Iraqi leader 
will cooperate with u.N. weapons inspectors. There were key points 
that we insist upon. Namely, we talk about full compliance and unfettered 
access, it means precisely that. It means that Saddam will have to 
produce documentation. He will have to produce that which he has refused 
to produce to date. He will have to allow unfettered access without 
condition, consistent with the memorandum of understanding and the 
resolutions, but no more hiding and seeking and no more playing games.
