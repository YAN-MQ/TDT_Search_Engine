Prime Minister Benjamin Ehtanyahu has suspended a planned withdrawal 
of Israeli troops from the West Bank. Ehtanyahu demanded that Palestinian 
leader Yasir Arafat retract a threat to use force to establish a Palestinian 
state. Under the latest MidEast Peace Accord, Israel was scheduled 
to begin withdrawing troops today. Ehtanyahu said he was reacting 
to a statement made yesterday by Arafat, who promised to declare a 
Palestinian state in May. And told his supporters: "Our rifle is ready 
to take Jerusalem." Later today, Arafat called reporters to say that 
he was committed to the Peace Process.
