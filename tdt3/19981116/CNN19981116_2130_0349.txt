In Burlington, Wisconsin, three teenagers are being held on charges 
of conspiracy to commit murder after they allegedly planned to kill 
20 of their teachers and fellow students. An informant tipped off 
police, and five boys were taken into custody last night. Two of them 
were released after questioning. Police say the boys told them they 
had a specific list of teachers, students and principals they claim 
had picked on them. I want to know if I'm part of the list. Until 
they can assure me that I'm safe, no, I won't be going back to the 
school. I don't think that the other students should have a right 
to know who's on the list, 'cause they could harass the list people. 
But if I was on the list, I'd definitely want to know. The three boys 
will have their second court appearance Wednesday. Classes at the 
high school went as scheduled today.
