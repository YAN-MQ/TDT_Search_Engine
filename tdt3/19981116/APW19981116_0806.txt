Bangladesh's main opposition leader Monday rejected Prime Minister 
Sheikh Hasina's offer of an end to frequent political strikes in the 
country and announced a new campaign against the government. Hasina 
on Sunday urged the country's political parties to bring an end to 
strikes that have hobbled the economy. At a public rally Monday, Khaleda 
Zia, leader of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, threataned 
to enforce a ``continuous'' strike if the government did not end what 
she described as ``repressive policies'' toward opponents. Seven people 
were injured and more than 500 injured during last week's 60-hour 
strike, the longest shutdown since Sheikh Hasina's government came 
to power two years ago. Business leaders claimed the strike cost the 
impoverished country dlrs 200 million in lost revenue. But Zia said 
her campaign was justified. ``Our movement is to protect the country 
and the people,'' she said, calling a new hunger strike against the 
government on Nov. 23.
