Germany urged its European Union partners Monday to cooperate better 
in arms-making to help craft a stronger European defense capability 
within the NATO alliance. German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping's 
plea for a ``shakeup'' in Europe's top-heavy arms sector came as EU 
foreign and defense ministers began two days of security talks. Britain 
was expected to explain its new thinking on how Europe can take a 
more independent defense stance. Until now, it worried a go-it-alone 
Europe would erode Washington's long commitment to European security 
through NATO. But Prime Minister Tony Blair changed course last month, 
endorsing the idea of making the Western European Union, the EU's 
embryonic defense group, more effective. Ahead of Monday's WEU session, 
he said the Europeans can make a start of that by sharing more of 
the NATO defense burden and end duplication in arms production. There 
at least four tank-building programs in Europe, compared to one in 
the United States, officials said. For infantry combat vehicles, Europeans 
have 16 different programs, against three in the United States. And 
while less than half a dozen U.S. companies make helicopters and military 
planes, in Europe there are 10. ``We need to reconstruct our forces 
together and make sure that spending on defense in all nations matches 
the need,'' Blair wrote last Friday in an opinion piece in the New 
York Times. At his first WEU meeting, Scharping urged better efforts 
to create ``a competitive, consolidated European armaments industry 
... Part and parcel of that is a shakeup of European armaments industries.'' 
The EU governments are debating the formation of a European armaments 
agency by 2001. France, Germany, Italy and Britain _ countries that 
account for 80 percent of the European arms industry _ have taken 
the lead by pledging to join forces in making arms systems to end 
costly duplication. That duplication has long been a nightmare at 
NATO where military planners have had to contend with a hodge-podge 
of norms, standards and ammunitions needs. If the EU nations can make 
something of the WEU, they may at last be able to project influence 
and security eastward, reducing their reliance on the United States. 
Waffling by EU governments has put Washington in the driver's seat 
of peace efforts in Bosnia and Kosovo. The WEU is made up of all 15 
EU nations, except Austria, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Ireland.
