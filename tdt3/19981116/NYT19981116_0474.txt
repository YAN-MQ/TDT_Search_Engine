Two former brokers pleaded guilty Monday to taking secret stock information, 
another victory for New York state prosecutors in one of the biggest 
insider-trading cases of recent years. Robert Breed, a former broker 
at First United Equities, and Jennifer D'Antoni, a former Duke &AMP; 
Co. broker, pleaded guilty to charges brought by the Manhattan district 
attorney, Robert Morgenthau. Breed pleaded guilty to third-degree 
criminal possession of stolen property, and Ms. D'Antoni pleaded guilty 
to a violation of the state's general business laws. Both pleas were 
in connection with the use of confidential information supplied by 
Marisa Baridis, a former compliance aide at the Wall Street firms 
Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney. Nine people have now admitted guilt 
in the case, in which Ms. Baridis, 30, admitted selling tips on stocks 
of companies involved in takeovers. She pleaded guilty late last year 
to federal charges of conspiracy and securities fraud and is awaiting 
sentencing. Two other defendants, Mark Nogid and Vincent Napolitano, 
continue to fight the charges. Their trial is scheduled to begin on 
March 8. The Baridis case has been a subject of contention between 
state and federal prosecutors. Both offices originally brought charges 
against Ms. Baridis, but Morgenthau's office backed down because the 
dual charges raised concerns about double jeopardy. But the state 
has continued to prosecute others involved in the case. Justice Edward 
McLaughlin of New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled in September 
that state prosecutors have the authority to pursue insider-trading 
cases, an area once considered the preserve of federal prosecutors. 
``We are hoping that anyone involved in insider trading will realize 
that they are subject to prosecution in the state courts under the 
penal law,'' said James Kindler, chief assistant district attorney.
