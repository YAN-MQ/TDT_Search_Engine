Pre-election violence claimed five lives in the Central African Republic 
over the weekend, raising concerns that upcoming voting could trigger 
more clashes. In a speech broadcast on Monday, President Ange-Felix 
Patasse called the rise in violence alarming and appealed for calm 
in the eastern part of the country. The first of two rounds of legislative 
elections is scheduled for Nov. 22. Armed political supporters have 
attacked opposition groups in the eastern towns of Rafai and Bangassou 
in recent days, state-radio reported. Troops from the capital Bangui 
have been sent to the area to try and quell the clashes. Patasse said 
the violence threatened national unity and he warned it could escalate. 
Much of the election-related fighting stems from long-standing ethnic 
rivalries in the Central African Republic. Members of the ethnic Yakoma 
group have been battling people from the Nzakara group for years. 
The five people killed recently were all from the Yokoma tribe. Violent 
crime is already rampant in the Central African Republic, where armed 
bandits rob motorists and rival groups fight for influence over local 
towns. For years, French troops helped maintained a semblance of stability 
in the Central African Republic until they pulled out earlier this 
year. A United Nations peacekeeping force replaced the French.
