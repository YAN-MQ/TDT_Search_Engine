On a gentle night in late September 1976, a dark-haired 17-year-old 
high school senior from Hillside, N.J., scraped together $25 to buy 
a ticket to watch Muhammad Ali successfully defend his world heavyweight 
championship against Ken Norton at Yankee Stadium. This cheapest seat 
available was so high and far away, he recalled recently, that ``the 
two fighters in the ring looked like ants.'' For David Remnick, the 
teen-ager in the distant reaches of the upper deck that night, his 
journey to see Ali was in equal parts a young fan's curiosity and 
moth-to-a-flame lure for a ballyhooed sporting event, as well as an 
abiding fascination with Ali, that seminal figure on the world stage. 
Some 20 years later, Remnick gained a significantly closer look at 
Ali, visiting him at his farm in Berrien Springs, Mich.: ``I'd come 
up to Michigan to see him because I wanted to write about the way 
he'd created himself in the early 60s, the way a gangly kid from Louisville 
managed to become one of the most electric of American characters, 
a molder of his age and a reflection of it.'' Remnick wrote that in 
the prologue to his new book, ``King of the World: Muhammad Ali and 
the Rise of an American Hero'' (Random House). At first glance, Remnick 
may seem to be an unlikely candidate to write a biographical study 
of a sports personality, whether it be Ali or anyone else. Remnick 
is, after all, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1994 for ``Lenin's 
Tomb,'' his masterly study of Russia past and present, following a 
four-year stint as a correspondent in Moscow for The Washington Post. 
He was a staff writer for The New Yorker for six years and distinguished 
himself with profiles ranging from Benjamin Netanyahu to Pope John 
Paul II to Howard Stern. In July, he was named editor of the magazine, 
and he was still three months short of his 40th birthday. He does 
not consider his writing on boxing to be such an odd undertaking, 
he said, but he understands the perception. At lunch recently in a 
midtown restaurant, Remnick, who still looks young enough to pass 
for a college student _ graduate student, anyway _ recalled a moment 
when he was in Las Vegas last year to write about the Evander Holyfield-Mike 
Tyson title fight. ``I was in the MGM Grand Hotel and wearing the 
laminated identification around my neck that is given to the press, 
when a middle-aged couple approached me, and the woman asked what 
I was there for,'' he recalled. ``I said, `The fight.' She asked who 
I was with. I told her The New Yorker. She looked shocked. `The New 
Yorker? Do they cover boxing?''' Remnick laughed at the thought. ``I 
just answered her yes,'' he said, ``I didn't tell her some of my favorite 
writing in the magazine was done by A.J. Leibling on boxing. Some 
people have the notion that The New Yorker is a genteel hothouse flower. 
But the real New Yorker includes Tyson spitting a piece of ear on 
the ring canvas. And it always has.'' ``The best writing,'' Remnick 
said, ``is invariably done in terms of dramatic conflict. Whether 
it's about politics or sports, it demands conflict. In the realm of 
sports, the most naked and clear conflict of all is in the boxing 
ring. There are no committee meetings, like huddles in football, no 
elaborate rules like the zone defense in basketball. Like it or not, 
boxing presents two men in vivid contrast, and somehow over time this 
has proved to be a fertile ground for writers. ``It goes all the way 
from Homer to Pierce Egan to Joyce Carol Oates. The literary journalism 
on Vietnam, for example, is vastly superior to that on Watergate. 
Vietnam was a brutal and confused and divisive conflict, whereas the 
battlefield in Watergate had to do with committee rooms and documents 
and tapes. And while it was plenty dramatic, there is no literary 
legacy. Unlike, say, all the wars we've had.'' For Remnick, the heavyweight 
champion, considered the toughest man on earth, from John L. Sullivan 
to Jack Johnson to Jack Dempsey to Joe Louis to Muhammad Ali, has 
always possessed ``an uncanny symbolic role.'' ``Not only did Ali 
make himself a great heavyweight champion _ in my view, the greatest, 
combining the power of a heavyweight with the quickness and grace 
of Sugar Ray Robinson _ but he became one of the most courageous American 
figures ever,'' he said. ``He was a self-created American genius, 
like Davy Crockett, or Duke Ellington, or Annie Oakley. But he did 
it in the age of media. And he showed the courage of his convictions.'' 
When Ali refused to be inducted into the military, Remnick said, ``he 
was giving up the thing that meant everything to him, the heavyweight 
championship.'' Ali's willingness to be exiled from his profession 
for a cause, his conversion to the Black Muslims, his embrace of and 
then break with Malcolm X, his emergence as an Islamic minister, his 
``democratic interest'' in women (Remnick's phrase) to a degree that 
a friend called Ali ``the pelvic missionary,'' how he could sometimes 
be cruel and turn on people, his becoming a beloved world figure whose 
surprise lighting of the Olympic flame in Atlanta in 1996 moved billions 
watching on television around the world _ and moved Remnick, too _ 
showed Ali to be a complex man, a compelling man. ``But the thing 
I wanted to focus in my book on was the 24 hours of Ali's winning 
the title in an upset of Sonny Liston,'' Remnick said, ``and then 
announcing he was no longer Cassius Clay _ a slave name, he said _ 
and he was now Muhammad Ali. It was a momentous event in our time.'' 
Remnick added: ``I wanted to write a tight, vivid story. And I felt 
this was the one for me.'' No stranger to sportswriting, Remnick's 
first full-time job in journalism, not long after graduating from 
Princeton University, was as a sportswriter for The Washington Post. 
He did it for two years, from 1983 to 1985. He covered the Washington 
Federals of the defunct United States Football League, the Washington 
Bullets of the NBA, and boxing. ``I enjoyed it, and I learned from 
it,'' he said. ``One of the first things I did in covering the Bullets 
was to somehow offend the star player, Jeff Ruland, who stopped speaking 
to me for about three months. So I had to be resourceful in getting 
stuff from other players.'' The Post sports editor then and now, George 
Solomon, said that Remnick ``had more access to Gorbachev and Yeltsin 
than he did to Ruland.'' Solomon also remembers that Remnick as a 
young sports reporter ``was terrific.'' ``It's nice to have a guy 
who can write well, and be a good reporter, too,'' he said. ``And 
he worked like a dog.'' On the boxing beat, Remnick grew to respect 
the skills and courage of the fighters. ``The foot speed, the concentration, 
the endurance, the sheer terror of being in the ring can be exhausting,'' 
he said. ``Did you ever box? I did, a few times as a kid, in a friend's 
basement. It is literally a painful memory. I hated getting hit in 
the face. But the game, when others do it, still holds a fascination 
for me. It's a guilty pleasure, but I wouldn't lose sleep if it went 
away.'' At The Washington Post one day, Remnick's attention was drawn 
to someone else. In the winter of 1983, he recalled, an attractive 
dark-haired woman, then a clerk in the sports department of The New 
York Times, walked into George Solomon's office seeking a job as a 
sportswriter. When she left, Remnick went into Solomon's office. ```George,''' 
Solomon recalled him saying, ```you must hire that woman.''' ``Look, 
David,'' replied Solomon, ``I don't have any openings. But if you 
want to date her, that's your business.'' While there were no openings 
for her at The Post, in time she was hired in the news department 
of The New York Times, where she is now a reporter. Her name is Esther 
B. Fein. Oh, and a few years after Remnick spotted her at The Post, 
he married her. They now have two fast-growing boys, 8 and 6, and 
a splendid new book.
