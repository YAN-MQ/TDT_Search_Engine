A drug smuggler arrested after his heroin-packed truck proved too 
tall to clear a London tunnel was sentenced Monday to 18 years in 
prison. Hamid Shamsollahi's miscalculation in February left customs 
agents with a cache of heroin worth more than 7 million pounds (dlrs 
11.7 million) and London motorists with one of the city's biggest 
traffic jams in years. Shamsollahi, an Amsterdam-based businessman, 
had been traveling in another vehicle but doubled back to see what 
happened to the truck after it got wedged in the Blackwall Tunnel, 
which runs under the Thames River, prosecutors said. Judge David Elfer 
imposed a 14-year sentence on the Turkish truck driver, Mustafa Karinca, 
and a nine-year term on Korkut Eris, another Turk who had been traveling 
with the Iranian-born Shamsollahi. Elfer said Shamsollahi was clearly 
a ``senior member'' of the Turkish-Dutch gang behind the smuggling 
operation. The false fuel tank installed to conceal the heroin was 
so artfully constructed that it fooled customs agents when the truck 
entered England, prosecutor David Green said. But for the crucial 
error in judgment about the tunnel's height, ``their journey would 
not have been so rudely interrupted,'' he said.
