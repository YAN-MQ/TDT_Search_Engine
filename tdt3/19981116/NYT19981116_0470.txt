Amazon.com, the online retailer that already dominates Internet sales 
of books and, increasingly, music, is about to start offering a much 
broader array of merchandise. The Seattle-based company's first step 
into general retailing will be a holiday gift selection starting Tuesday 
that will feature consumer electronics, games, toys and other items. 
Separately, the company is adding an extensive line of videotapes 
and DVDs (digital videodiscs). ``We keep getting asked by our customers 
what is the Amazon.com of this and that type of merchandise,'' said 
Keith Schorsch, the general manager of the gift service. ``We would 
rather be the Amazon.com of all of the things our customers want to 
buy.'' Amazon has been unexpectedly successful in its move into music. 
In its first full quarter, it sold $14.4 million worth of music items, 
more than N2K or CDNow, the two leading online music stores. Analysts 
said that Amazon's lead might help it as it expanded into other areas, 
especially because many people are still worried about the possible 
risks of buying online. ``Most people know someone who has bought 
from Amazon.com and had nothing bad happen to them,'' said Vernon 
Keenan, an analyst with Keenan Vision in San Francisco. ``They can 
leverage the trust in their brand to become a general merchandiser.'' 
Many of the several hundred items in the new gift store will be tied 
to book and music titles. For example, Sony Walkman tape players will 
be promoted amid audio books. And the Madeline series of children's 
books will be accompanied by toys featuring the French schoolgirl 
character. Unlike Amazon's book service, which offers its products 
at some of the deepest discounts available anywhere, Amazon will price 
the gift items in the midrange of market prices. Rather than price, 
Amazon is emphasizing convenience and information. As with books, 
customers will be able to post reviews on the company's site of all 
the products it sells. And it will introduce a feature that lets people 
send a gift to someone by entering an e-mail address. Amazon will 
get in touch with the recipient to find out the shipping address. 
``Just like people send more e-mail than they do first-class letters, 
we think this will expand the market for gift giving because it is 
much easier,'' said Jeff Bezos, the company's chief executive.
