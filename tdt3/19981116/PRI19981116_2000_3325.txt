We end today's program with a new spin on an old musical style. Madridaos 
is the world-famous ensemble of Portuguese singers that performs the 
melancholy rhythms called Fado. A lesser know Portuguese ensemble 
with links to Fado is Vi Emperido. He borrows the lyrics of Fado then 
fuses them with high-tech synthesizer sound. This track, Ventos di 
Historia, comes from the debut release from Vi Emperido. Music critics 
in Portugal have commented that Ventos di Historia may be the beginning 
of a new chapter in Portuguese music. The ballads are as soothing 
as traditional Fado music. But with a 21st century sophistication. 
Music from the Portuguese group Vi Emperido brings our program to 
a close today.
