The United States and Japan have come up with a massive rescue plan 
for asian economies in trouble. Vice President Gore announced the 
initiative in a speech to Asian leaders and business executives in 
Malaysia. The package includes $10 billion worth of loans and loan 
guarantees, backed by the U.S., Japan, the world bank and the Asian 
development bank. Gore also says the U.S. has some advice to ease 
Asia's suffering. Tomorrow, I will discuss with apec leaders an urgent 
strategy to stem the financial crisis. Strengthening the social safety 
nets for countries in distress. Promoting trade and investments and 
getting the corporate and financial systems back on their feet. To 
begin with, let us not forget those who have been hit hardest by the 
crisis -- the poor and unemployed, the children and the elderly. After 
so many years of dynamic and seemingly endless growth in this region, 
many nations were unprepared for the human cost of contraction. Gore 
also infuriated his Malaysian hosts by using his speech to praise 
anti-government demonstrators.
