This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Tuesday. A storm moving into the western United States 
will bring some rain and mountain snow from the northwest through 
the intermountain region to the northern Rockies Tuesday. Meanwhile, 
some rain and snow over the Great Lakes will push across the northeastern 
part of the country and we'll continue to see some clouds and rain 
showers in the southeast as well. Our high temperatures on Tuesday 
will range from 30s in the north to 60s and 70s south, even a few 
80s in southern Texas and southern Florida. Looking ahead to Wednesday 
-- it stays mild across the south with some rain and snow pushing 
into the northern plains. On Thursday, cool air across the northern 
Rockies and northern plains, with milder conditions in the east. We'll 
see anything from snow to thunderstorms from the Great Lakes to the 
gulf coast. And on Friday, our wet weather pushes eastward with another 
round of rain and snow in the northwest.
