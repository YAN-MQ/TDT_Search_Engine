In the antitrust case against Microsoft, videotaped testimony of Bill 
Gates shows him evading a government lawyer's questions about a 1996 
E-mail he wrote about winning market share in the Internet browser 
market. The E-mail began -- "winning Internet browser share is a very, 
very important goal for us." But government lawyers could not get 
the software tycoon to discuss which companies Microsoft was targeting 
to take away market share. The Microsoft trial is now in its fifth 
week.
