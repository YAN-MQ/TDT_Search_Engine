European Union nations agreed Monday to tighten controls on the dlrs 
45 billion a year they spend on state aid to industry and make it 
easier for EU regulators to reclaim unauthorized subsidies. New regulations 
approved by industry ministers from the 15 EU nations will give the 
EU's executive Commission more power to demand immediate repayment 
of illegal aid and increase its scope to monitor companies' compliance 
with conditions for receiving subsidies. Under EU law, governments 
must seek clearance from the Commission, before paying state aids 
to industry. The Commission can impose conditions on the subsidies, 
or veto payments judged to violate rules governing fair competition 
within the 15-nation bloc. The EU's top state-aid watchdog, Competition 
Commissioner Karel Van Miert, welcomed the decision to reinforce his 
powers. ``From now on, the Commission will be better equipped in its 
combat against illegal subsidies and everything will be more open,'' 
he said in a statement. The Commission estimates EU governments paid 
38 billion European currency units (dlrs 45 billion) a year to manufacturing 
industry from 1994 to 1996. Britain's representative at Monday's meeting 
said the new rules would help make European companies more competitive. 
``High volumes of aid to industry across the EU are a big brake on 
our competitiveness,'' said Lord Simon, British Minister for European 
trade. ``The era of huge rescue packages for failing firms must come 
to an end.'' The new rules are expected to come into force in the 
first half of 1999.
