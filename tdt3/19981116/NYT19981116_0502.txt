NEW YORK _ ABC and its union of 2,200 off-camera workers have agreed 
to resume contract negotiations, perhaps as early as this week, with 
the help of a federal mediator, officials on both sides said Monday 
night. The 2-week-old lockout of members of the National Association 
of Broadcast Employees and Technicians in New York and four other 
cities will remain in effect, however, unless the union agrees to 
give the network warning of any future job actions, an ABC spokeswoman 
said. The agreement to return to the table, where discussions broke 
off Oct. 5, came after U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman intervened 
in the dispute by talking with leaders of the company and the union. 
The two sides still await a ruling by the National Labor Relations 
Board over whether ABC's refusal to provide certain information about 
a new health-care plan _ information network officials say they do 
not have _ constitutes an unfair labor practice. Julie Hoover, an 
ABC spokeswoman, described the resumption of talks as ``very, very 
pleasing'' to network executives. ``Obviously that's what we want 
to do, is settle the contract,'' Ms. Hoover said. Late on Monday, 
ABC executives sent an e-mail to high-ranking employees expressing 
optimism about the news. The union also placed an upbeat message on 
its emergency phone line about Herman's involvement. The network's 
video editors, engineers, camera operators and other technical workers 
spent 19 months working without a contract before staging a 24-hour 
strike Nov. 2. ABC responded by refusing to let them return to work 
unless they vowed to give notice _ 72 hours for in-studio programs, 
two weeks for shows on the road _ about additional strikes. While 
the dispute over the new health plan was the official reason for the 
strike, the two sides also have broad differences over several other 
issues. Among the most important is how many temporary workers should 
be allowed, and how much control the union should maintain over new 
machines. A Labor Department official said that Herman met last week 
and had ``intense'' telephone talks over the weekend with both Robert 
Iger, the president of ABC, and Morton Bahr, the president of the 
Communication Workers of America, which is the broadcast workers' 
parent union. Her goal, the official said, is ``to get the two sides 
talking and end this dispute.'' Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the union, 
said Herman's involvement was ``clearly pivotal'' in the resumption 
of negotiations. ``We view her attention and her time and resources 
as beneficial to an effort to end this lockout so that our members 
can return to work,'' he said. ``We are willing to explore through 
the efforts of the secretary any and all mechanisms by which the company 
can be forced to end this illegal lockout.'' The federal Mediation 
and Conciliation Service, a government agency that helped settle the 
United Parcel Service strike, will oversee the new talks. A time and 
place for resumed negotiations has not yet been set and an individual 
mediator has not yet been selected.
