It doesn't get much closer. Now, how close will the U.S. be watching 
Iraq nor violations after the attack that never came? Also tonight 
the view from on deck. This ship was forced to stay silent instead. 
What to expect when Ken Starr starts off the impeachment hearing. 
And what tomorrow morning's "New York Times" is reporting about the 
president's chief accuser. How much is the deal worth to write her 
story down and sell it? Good Monday evening to you. In just a moment, 
we will talk to man identified by this morning's "Washington Post" 
as the one who convinced the president not to attack iraq.
