With Valerie Harper, it's the voice. Even if she's not doing her Rhoda 
Morgenstern nice-Jewish-girl-from-New-York accent, the tone and the 
knowing, contemporary rhythm of her voice send signals: This is a 
savvy, neurotic late-20th-century woman and she's probably about to 
say something funny _ ideally to Mary, Lou, Brenda or Joe. (For readers 
without television sets, those are characters from ``The Mary Tyler 
Moore Show'' and ``Rhoda,'' the two 1970s sitcoms in which Ms. Harper 
starred.) That's why playing Pearl Buck with an old-lady voice, in 
addition to the baggy clothes and the gray hair in a bun, was actually 
a good idea. In ``All Under Heaven,'' an intelligent and often witty 
one-woman show that opened at the Century Theater on Monday night, 
Ms. Harper does well. The production is no tour de force, but she 
proves herself a competent stage actress and not a bad mimic. In addition 
to Buck, she plays, among others, a Chinese woman who named her son 
Little Meatball, Buck's unhappy West Virginia mother and Will Rogers 
reading a newspaper review of ``The Good Earth'' (``So you go get 
this and read it''). She even does a very quick Nixon impersonation. 
Buck, who is 79 as Ms. Harper plays her, was born in 1892 and grew 
up in China, the daughter of Presbyterian missionaries. She came home 
long enough to get a degree at Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Virginia 
but returned to China, became a university teacher there, married 
a missionary and wrote magazine articles and essays. Eventually she 
wrote the novel ``The Good Earth'' (1931), the story of a Chinese 
peasant who became a wealthy landowner, which won a Pulitzer Prize. 
Within four years, she divorced her husband, married her New York 
publisher and moved back to the United States. She continued to write, 
and she died in Vermont in 1973. But those are only the outlines of 
a life. Ms. Harper's play concentrates on the highs and lows, particularly 
the difficulties. Buck's father, for instance, never reads ``The Good 
Earth,'' because, he says, he doesn't have time. After giving birth 
to two daughters, Buck is unable to have more children. (``There is 
no rapid recovery from the loss of your womb.'') So she adopts seven. 
One daughter is very sick. (``There are two kinds of people in this 
world: those who have known inescapable sorrow and those who have 
not.'') She becomes a target of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's communist witch 
hunt. At one point in China, she is so certain of her imminent death, 
because she is not Asian, that she resolves to kill the children first 
rather than leave them to suffer whatever horrors the soldiers might 
inflict. During the same military attack, a Chinese friend, says Buck, 
``managed to save many of our things by pretending to loot.'' Apparently 
Buck could find humor in the worst of situations and subjects, and 
Dyke Garrison, who wrote ``All Under Heaven'' with Ms. Harper, conveys 
that. Discussing the plight of mixed-race children fathered by American 
soldiers in Asia, a cause Buck was fervent about, she speaks to her 
Bucks County, Pa., neighbors, including Oscar Hammerstein II: ``No 
one is born prejudiced. You've got to be carefully taught.'' ``All 
Under Heaven,'' nicely directed by Rob Ruggiero, is too long and falters 
once or twice, but overall this is a well-drawn portrait of an author 
who truly had something to say. PRODUCTION NOTES: `ALL UNDER HEAVEN'
