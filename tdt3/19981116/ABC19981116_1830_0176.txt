The Clinton administration wants the Iraqi president's word about 
allowing inspections to be tested pretty quickly. And the rhetoric 
was generally more measured today, though defense secretary Cohen 
did say this was Saddam Hussein's last chance. Once again, by playing 
it as close as he did, the Iraqi leader cost the U.S. a lot of extra 
money, and he did get a comprehensive review of economic sanctions. 
But it was ever so close. Here is ABC's John McWethy. It was an air 
campaign that could have losted a week and U.S. military planners 
estimated that at least 10,000 Iraqis might have been killed. In the 
course of the week, plans called for hitting air defense, intelligence 
herks, special military units that guard Saddam Hussein. Pentagon 
officials say many soldiers would have died. But there also would 
have been civilian casualties, in the interest of tactical surprise, 
the first salvo of cruise missiles was set for early evening. When 
the streets would have been crowded. This was the scene aboard the 
"USS cape St. georges" in the Persian gulf, chilling evidence of just 
how close the U.S. came to launching the ship's cruise missiles. I 
just received word from my boss, rear admiral fry, commander task 
force 50, that there will be strikes tonight. As the sunset, the ship 
was made ready. ABC's Mike Lee, who was on board said that the countdown 
was stopped just 18 minutes before launch. The news spread fast. There's 
been some breakthroughs on the diplomatic front and the strikes are 
canceled. The White House knew on Friday that Iraq was starting ta 
back down, but kept the countdown going until Saddam Hussein gave 
the assurances they wanted in writing. The U.N. special envoy to Baghdad 
was the middleman in those frantic final hours. With time running 
out, he struggled to nail down new Iraqi positions, while fighting 
Baghdad's aging telephones and fax machines. He said today that he 
knew military action was close, but admitted he had no idea how close.
