Monday was another memorable day for Roger Clemens, a day when he 
became the first pitcher in history to snare five Cy Young awards. 
Clemens won the American League Cy Young unanimously, won it for the 
second straight year with the Toronto Blue Jays and marched even closer 
to his eventual place in Cooperstown, N.Y. But Monday was also another 
unstable day for Clemens, a day when he continued to wonder if the 
Jays would improve through trades or free-agent signings or if they 
would stay stagnant. If Toronto remained status quo, he sounded as 
if he would be a perturbed ace pitcher. As elated as Clemens was about 
achieving an unprecedented honor, he emphasized that he longed to 
return to post-season play. While Clemens is signed with Toronto through 
the 2000 season and said his priority was to help lead the Blue Jays 
into meaningful games in October, he wanted to know whether the team 
was serious about contending now. ``If I'm just going to win games 
and make it exciting for fans, great, I enjoy doing that,'' he said. 
``I wish someone would let me know. I don't hear anything from the 
office about catching up with the Yankees, Baltimore and Cleveland. 
I don't hear that.'' Clemens, who was 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA and 271 
strikeouts in 2342/3 innings, was named first on all 28 ballots cast 
by two writers from each AL city from the Baseball Writers Association 
of America. Boston's Pedro Martinez finished second while the Yankees' 
David Wells and David Cone were third and fourth, respectively. The 
36-year-old Clemens also won the award for the Red Sox in 1986, 1987 
and 1991. Greg Maddux and Steve Carlton have four Cy Youngs each. 
Only two other pitchers have won the AL award unanimously _ Denny 
McLain in 1968 and Ron Guidry in 1978. ``It's overwhelming to have 
done this five times,'' Clemens said. ``It's never been done before 
in this manner. It really hasn't sunk in yet.'' After starting the 
season sluggishly, Clemens remembered how he peered up at the scoreboard, 
saw that his record was 5-6 after a May 29 loss and said he felt embarrassed. 
He never lost after that day, going undefeated in his last 22 starts 
with 15 victories. He topped the league in ERA and strikeouts and 
was tied with Cone for the most triumphs. Still, Clemens' agents talked 
to the Jays about the possibility of a trade last July. Clemens was 
buoyed when Toronto made a dash at the Red Sox for the wild-card berth. 
But, six weeks later, the Jays have not made any major personnel moves, 
and Clemens is antsy. Antsy enough to answer questions about the seemingly 
farfetched possibility of returning to Boston in a trade. ``I think 
the Red Sox are trying to be competitive,'' Clemens said before rambling 
on about how he prefers the intensity of the cities in the AL East. 
Toronto's general manager, Gord Ash, is waiting for the team's owner, 
Interbrew, to provide him with a budget, so the Blue Jays have moved 
methodically. Toronto offered Jose Canseco a one-year contract for 
$2.25 million and $750,000 in bonuses and an option year for similar 
money, but the 34-year-old designated hitter, who hit 46 homers, wants 
four years for $28 million. ``I'm gone for sure,'' Canseco told The 
Toronto Sun. ``I don't think they ever had any intention of bringing 
me back.'' Clemens, who said the Jays would be taking ``a couple of 
steps backward'' by not signing Canseco, said the team needed a ``big-time 
center fielder,'' a second baseman and a left-hander who could win 
15 games. ``My first and foremost desire is to win in Toronto,'' Clemens 
said. ``Not for me to win, for us to win. Even though I've won games, 
I'd rather be 10-10 and them giving me the ball in the playoffs.'' 
Clemens could have signed with the Yankees or the Indians, who both 
seriously courted him as a free agent in the winter of 1996 and reached 
the post-season the last two years. The Yankees, Indians, Red Sox 
and others would be interested in Clemens, but the Jays would have 
to be overwhelmed to trade their most valuable pitcher and the one 
and only five-time Cy Young winner. ``I don't have a lot of say-so,'' 
Clemens said. ``I'm locked in. I'm glad to be locked in. I want to 
get to the post-season again. It would be great if it could happen 
again.''
