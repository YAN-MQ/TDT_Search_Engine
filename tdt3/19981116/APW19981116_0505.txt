The European Commission on Monday earmarked 60 million European currency 
units (dlrs 70 million) in financial assistance for Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
In a statement, the European Union's executive body said the grants 
and loans should promote peace and help Bosnia's transition towards 
a market economy, particularly in promoting the development of the 
private sector. The money must first be approved by the 15 EU governments. 
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, EU commissioner for economic affairs, said 
it was time ``to go beyond the objective of reconstruction and focus 
increased attention on the structural reforms which will make it possible 
to foster growth.'' The assistance would be conditional on Bosnia-Herzegovina 
beginning implementation of economic reforms agreed with the IMF and 
World Bank. The EU is Bosnia's largest aid donor. Under current programs, 
it will have granted 2 billion Ecu (dollars 1.16 billion) worth of 
humanitarian and reconstruction aid by 2000.
