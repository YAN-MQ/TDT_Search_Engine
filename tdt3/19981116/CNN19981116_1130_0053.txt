British prime minister Tony Blair says Iraq will get no more warnings 
about military strikes. Blair told the British parliament today that 
he will not hesitate to order military force if Iraq again stops cooperating 
with United Nations weapons inspectors. And he said President Clinton's 
position is the same. The weapons inspectors are preparing to return 
to Iraq tomorrow. A U.N. spokeswoman says the inspectors will be ready 
to start work right away, but it will take a while to get back to 
full capacity. About 150 U.N. relief workers are already on their 
way back to Iraq. They evacuated last week because of the threat of 
military strikes.
