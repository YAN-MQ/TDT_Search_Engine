In upstate New York, footsie, a German Shepherd mix was fitted with 
prosthetic paws today. Footsie has not led an easy life. A birth defect 
left him without hind paws, and this month, his owner abandoned him 
in the middle of the night. But lots of people are rallying behind 
footsie. Veterinarians have donated their services. The humane society 
will try to find him a new, good home.
