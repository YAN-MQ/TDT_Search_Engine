All signs point to a quick resolution, with the likelihood of no significant 
disciplinary action, in the National Football League's investigation 
of Bill Parcells in the possible violation of a rule against contacting 
a player from another team. Parcells, coach of the New York Jets, 
admits he telephoned Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe, his former 
player. But even though Parcells said he made the call only to thank 
Bledsoe for shaking his hand after the teams met Oct. 19, that may 
have violated a league memo. The Sept. 1 memo reads, ``In-season contact, 
even if it does not constitute tampering, reflects poor judgment.'' 
The investigation was launched by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, and 
not the Patriots, a league spokesman said. Tagliabue had read about 
the phone call and sent a letter to the Jets last week. Jets' president 
Steve Gutman responded. There will most likely be no additional correspondence. 
Asked Monday about his conversation with Bledsoe, Parcells said, ``My 
reaction is that tampering is interference with somebody with an employer-employee 
relationship.'' The league has no plans to look into another matter 
supposedly involving Parcells, which appears to be erroneous. Both 
he and Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson denied that they had spoken about 
the health of Patriots wide receiver Terry Glenn. According to a television 
report, Parcells learned from Bledsoe that Glenn would not face the 
Dolphins. Johnson said Monday, ``I have no idea what was going on.'' 
The Dolphins' vice president for media relations, Harvey Greene, said 
it was the Patriots who told the Dolphins about Glenn's injury, as 
league rules require.
