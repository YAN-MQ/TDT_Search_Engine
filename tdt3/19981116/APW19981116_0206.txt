Australian Prime Minister John Howard raised concerns with his Malaysian 
counterpart Monday about the treatment of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim. 
Howard also revealed that his foreign minister met secretly with Anwar's 
wife Sunday to discuss his case. ``I expressed the concern that was 
felt in Australia about the issue and we had a lengthy discussion 
about it,'' Howard said after meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad. Howard said the conduct of Anwar's trial, currently 
under way, would influence the country's international reputation. 
``I hope that there will be a completely transparent and independent 
judicial hearing of the issue,'' he said. Howard arrived in Malaysia 
on Sunday for meetings this week of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum. He further risked bilateral tension by having Foreign Minister 
Alexander Downer meet secretly with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail for 
an hour on Sunday. ``Australia has been careful to take care of its 
bilateral relations between our countries,'' Azizah told The Associated 
Press in an interview Monday. She said Downer ``asked me all sorts 
of things about Anwar, how are his spirits, how is his health.'' Anwar 
was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance minister in September 
after Mahathir said he was morally unfit to take over the leadership 
of the country. Anwar is standing trial for corruption and sexual 
misconduct charges which he vehemently denies. Howard declined to 
say how Mahathir responded to his comments, but described the conversation 
as ``frank and courteous.'' ``I don't believe for a moment that the 
bilateral relation, which is very important to us and always has been 
and always will be, has been anything other than strengthened by the 
candor of the exchanges that took place at the meeting,'' he said. 
Malaysian trade minister Rafidah Aziz told reporters that Mahathir 
had given a complete explanation of Anwar's arrest and trial. ``We 
have explained it fully,'' she said. Asked if the two sides had agreed 
on the explanation, she replied: ``This is something (on which) you 
don't need to reach an agreement.'' Rafidah also said Australia planned 
to announce an economic assistance package for troubled Asian nations 
during the 21-member APEC summit. Howard had been criticized back 
home for going ahead with plans to meet with Mahathir despite Anwar's 
arrest and alleged beatings he received from police. U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien both canceled 
bilateral talks with Mahathir.
