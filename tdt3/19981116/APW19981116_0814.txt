As another Iraq crisis winds down, Kuwaitis were disappointed Monday 
that U.S. missiles did not finally finish off Saddam Hussein. But 
for other Arabs, it was back to normal: Israel, not Iraq, is the enemy. 
``Undoubtedly there is disappointment. We know that Saddam will be 
whipping more crises,'' said independent Kuwaiti lawmaker Mussalam 
al-Barrak. ``We have the right to know if America wants Saddam Hussein 
to stay, or if it is serious about toppling him and saving Iraq,'' 
wrote columnist Faisal al-Kanaii in Monday's al-Siyassah daily. Bitter 
sentiments against the Iraqi leader are to be expected in the small 
wealthy emirate south of Iraq. Saddam sent his army into Kuwait in 
August 1990 and it did not leave until driven out by a U.S.-led force 
seven months later. But elsewhere in the Arab world, commentators 
looked at the latest run-in between Saddam and the United Nations 
differently and arrived at a familiar charge: that Washington's foreign 
policy is plagued by double standards. ``The admiration of the U.S. 
stand (on Iraq) ... would subside when the admirers know of Washington's 
leniency in dealing with the Israeli sustained failure to abide by 
international law,'' said the Egyptian Gazette in an editorial. Noting 
Israel's failure to implement U.N. Security Council resolutions pertaining 
to the 50-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict, the English-language daily 
said: ``It seems that international law and threats of using force 
are only tailored for Iraqis.'' In Lebanon, the Daily Star concluded 
that Saddam, not U.S. President Bill Clinton, emerged the winner from 
the stand-off created by the Iraq's Oct. 31 decision to halt the work 
of U.N. weapons inspectors. Saddam backed down Saturday, avoiding 
what looked like certain military retaliation by the United States 
and Britain over Iraq's refusal to allow continued U.N. arms inspections. 
``The `Beast of Baghdad' is ahead on points, President Clinton is 
fast catching up and, as usual, losing at every turn are the people 
of Iraq,'' the Star wrote. Jordan's Arabic daily Ad-Destour was more 
blunt in its criticism of the United States. ``Any honest person examining 
Washington's double standards would only express ... condemnation 
and seething anger for the absence of justice and balanced policy.'' 
Beyond Arab commentators, the ``one voice'' from the world that Clinton 
described Sunday _ as telling Saddam to back down _ was gone by Monday 
elsewhere, too. In France, Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said only 
the U.N. Security Council has the right to authorize military action 
against Iraq. And Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, in Egypt 
for a visit, said Moscow opposed any military strikes against Baghdad. 
But at least one person expressed relief at the easing of the latest 
Saddam-Clinton tussle. ``I am glad it was resolved in a peaceful manner,'' 
U.S. Army Specialist Troy Kreitz told The Associated Press at Kuwait's 
Camp Doha, where the United States has kept weapons since the 1991 
Gulf War.
