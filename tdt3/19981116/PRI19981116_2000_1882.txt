U.N. weapons inspectors are due back in Iraq in a few hours. As they 
return, Washington and London are keeping up the pressure with the 
promise of immediate military action against Baghdad unless there's 
full compliance. Defense Secretary William Cohen says: "Saddam Hussein 
has had more than enough warning. There will be no more hide and seek." 
Washington says both the Israelis and the Palestinians will be questioned 
about recent statements that could undermine the Peace Process. State 
Department Spokesman James Rubin was speaking after comments by Palestinian 
and Israeli leaders. Throwing the Wide River Peace Accords in doubt. 
There is no place in the Peace Process for statements which call for 
or suggest violent actions. Nevertheless, we expect both parties to 
abide by the agreement they signed. Which did not include conditions 
about subjects like this. Mr. Rubin said the Wide River Accord committed 
Israel to troops to redeploy its troops in the West Bank, and he expected 
them to do just that.
