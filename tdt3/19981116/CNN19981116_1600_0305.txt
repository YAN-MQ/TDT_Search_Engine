Authorities in Burlington, Wisconsin, have arrested three boys they 
say were planning a killing spree at their high school. The boys, 
who were all 15 or 16 years old, allegedly conspired to kill several 
fellow students, a teacher, an administrator, and the school's principal. 
Police say the boys planned the killings because they "felt picked 
on." The students were arrested late Sunday, after an informant tipped 
police to the alleged plot. Parents in the small Wisconsin town say 
they are shocked. I'm very close with my kids. How could you not see 
signs? I would see something. You have to know. It's sometimes difficult. 
Kids can be very deceiving and very conniving and do things to shock 
you. As much as we try, and I always suggest to parents that you you 
always have to be watchful, always questioning and always supervising 
and always wanting some answers. Some parents do that well and some 
parents do not. Police say the alleged attack was to have taken place 
today, but the teens had no weapons to carry it out.
