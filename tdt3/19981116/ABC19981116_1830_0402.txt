There was a new tobacco deal unveiled today, we reported it was in 
the works last week. It will cost tobacco companies $206 billion to 
settle with 46 states -- far less than the deal Congress killed last 
summer. It bans advertising on billboards and cartoon characters such 
as Joe camel. But tobacco companies would be allowed to sponsor sports 
events and would not be penalized if teenage smoking does not decline. 
Individual states have until Friday to sign on.
