You can take the high road or the low road, but you must get to Scotland. 
Because that's where we're headed for today's geography quiz. We're 
searching for a town nearly 20 miles northwest of Edinburgh. The site's 
known for its coal mining, textile manufacturing, engineering and 
dairy farming. But its history is the real attraction. This is the 
ancient capitol of Scotland, and its name means fort on a winding 
stream. The town grew up around a Benedictine Abbey back in 1072, 
under the patronage of St. Margaret. Margaret was the queen of King 
Malcom III. She was fiercely religious. And was said to wash beggars' 
feet by day and attend mass by night. She's also credited with promoting 
art and education in Scotland. And today, the residents of our mystery 
location are observing her feast day. One final clue: Andrew Carnegie 
was born here in 1835. Got it yet? We'll bring you the answer in just 
a few minutes.
