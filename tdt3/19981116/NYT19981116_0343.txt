Jean Dalrymple, who abandoned a nascent acting career to become a 
successful publicist, then an even more successful manager of concert 
artists and finally a dynamic producer of musicals and plays for City 
Center and other stages, died Sunday at her Manhattan home, across 
the street from City Center. She was 96. Miss Dalrymple's stature 
in the New York theater world was enhanced by her uncanny ability 
to lure just the right actor for a particular role at a price that 
City Center, with its limited budget, could afford. Her skillful productions 
nourished and entertained audiences there from the 1940s through the 
'60s. Among the center's offerings during her tenure as director of 
its theater and light-opera companies were plays by Shakespeare and 
Shaw, Sartre and Tennessee Williams, with actors like Jose Ferrer, 
Charles Boyer, Franchot Tone, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, Charlton 
Heston, Helen Hayes and Tallulah Bankhead. She also revived musicals 
by Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Frank Loesser, Rodgers and Hart, and 
Rodgers and Hammerstein. The productions were quite polished. Indeed, 
after an opening of one Rodgers and Hammerstein revival, Miss Dalrymple 
received a floral tribute from the composers with a note that said, 
``We wish last night had been the Broadway opening.'' In her day, 
Miss Dalrymple was one of a handful of formidable female producers; 
the others included Cheryl Crawford and Irene Selznick. She was as 
tough as they were, a woman in perpetual motion, but she did not seem 
that way. ``Jean always had a kind of solid serenity about her,'' 
said Robert Whitehead, the producer. ``She had a great determination 
to get things done, but she was always very feminine, very pretty. 
She was an extraordinary person.'' Franchot Tone, an actor whose work 
Miss Dalrymple always admired, thought of her as ``the tenderest little 
lady.'' But a writer from The Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote that she 
was ``as fragile as a Fragonard painting but hep and with a sense 
of timing like a Garand rifle.'' In addition to luring actors, she 
was also able to persuade producers to give the City Center sets and 
costumes when their plays and musicals ended their runs. Thus, her 
revival of ``My Fair Lady'' featured the original costumes. City Center, 
for which Miss Dalrymple worked so long and hard, was established 
on W. 55th Street in 1943 by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and City Council 
President Newbold Morris, who wanted it to be a ``temple for the performing 
arts,'' offering productions for a top price of $2. Miss Dalrymple 
was there at the very beginning. Her success with their dream was 
such that when the center turned 50 in 1993 and called itself ``a 
glorious home for dance, music, opera and dozens of extraordinary 
musicals and plays,'' there were many who thought the phrase an understatement 
of what Miss Dalrymple had accomplished. Initially serving as volunteer 
director of public relations and as a member of its board, Miss Dalrymple 
remained at the middle of City Center's publicity apparatus even after 
she started producing and directing. At the same time, she served 
as personal manager to performing artists like Leopold Stokowski, 
Mary Martin, Jose Iturbi, Andre Kostalanetz, Nathan Milstein and Lily 
Pons. Jean Dalrymple was born on Sept. 2, 1902, in Morristown, N.J., 
to George and Elizabeth Collins Dalrymple. There was no shortage of 
money in her family; her grandfather, an officer in the Civil War, 
had founded a coal and lumber business that sustained the family well. 
When she was 9, she finished a short story, ``The Spinning Top,'' 
and sold it to a Newark newspaper for $1. Encouraged by this success, 
she wrote more stories for a Philadelphia paper, receiving $5 for 
each one. But even in those days, she thought of writing as secondary 
to her goal of becoming a stage director. After completing her secondary 
education, Miss Dalrymple moved to New York, studied secretarial skills 
at a business school and got a stenographer's job on Wall Street when 
she was only 16. She even made a respectable sum in the market before 
the crash of 1929. The crash propelled her out of Wall Street and 
into vaudeville. She created an act with her beau, Dan Jarrett, and 
worked with James Cagney and Cary Grant on the Keith-Orpheum circuit. 
During this period, she tried her hand at playwriting; ``Salt Water,'' 
written with Jarrett, was produced by John Golden. She was hired by 
Golden as an understudy, casting director, play doctor and press agent, 
and her skill in handling the press so impressed him that he encouraged 
her to work at it full time. It also impressed Ward Morehouse, the 
drama critic for The New York Sun, so much so that in 1932 he proposed 
marriage. It was not a successful union, but in the five years they 
were together, they collaborated on a screenplay, ``It Happened in 
New York,'' which was made into a movie by Universal Pictures. Miss 
Dalrymple was married in 1951 to Maj. Gen. Philip de Witt Ginder, 
who died in 1968. No immediate family members survive. The funeral 
will be held at 1:30 p.m. Thursday at the West Point chapel. Miss 
Dalrymple was one of the founding members of the American Theater 
Wing, the theater service organization. In 1939, she was its first 
publicity volunteer, and during World War II, she trained speakers 
who sold war bonds during the time of the Stage Door Canteen. By 1940, 
Miss Dalrymple was working as an independent press agent, much sought 
after because of her contacts. Among the Broadway plays for which 
she handled the publicity were ``Mr. and Mrs. North'' (1941), ``One 
Touch of Venus'' (1943) and ``Anna Lucasta'' (1944). In 1945, she 
turned to producing. Her first effort, a collaboration with Marc Connelly, 
was ``Hope for the Best,'' a comedy by William McCleery, who had been 
Sunday editor of the newspaper PM. She did not leave the publicity 
business but pursued more producing ventures, among them ``Brighten 
the Corner'' (1945) and ``Burlesque'' (1946). Meanwhile, she began 
to devote more of her energy to developing productions for the newly 
formed City Center, which was started in the old Mecca Temple that 
had been built years before by the Shriners. It had been taken over 
by the city for nonpayment of taxes and it stood idle, except for 
its occasional use as the site for Civil Service examinations. Early 
productions included Thornton Wilder's ``Our Town,'' mostly because 
it required no scenery and was inexpensive to produce, and ``Porgy 
and Bess,'' which the center snared as it was completing a national 
tour. Miss Dalrymple was especially proud of her production of ``Porgy.'' 
``I had an overwhelming desire to restore it to its original form 
and present it exactly as George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward had created 
it, as an opera for the Metropolitan,'' she once recalled. In her 
1975 memoir, ``From the Last Row,'' she recalled that Howard Taubman 
of The New York Times ``loved it'' but that Judith Crist of The New 
York Herald Tribune said she preferred the original Broadway version. 
``I wrote her,'' Miss Dalrymple said, ``and told her she had a tin 
ear.'' In 1948, Miss Dalrymple thought she had scored a coup when 
she succeeded in getting Jean-Paul Sartre's permission to produce 
his play ``Les Mains Sales'' in an English adaptation by Daniel Taradash 
called ``Red Gloves.'' She followed this up by inducing Charles Boyer 
to make it his first Broadway role. What began as a coup threatened 
to become a coup de grace; Sartre read Taradash's adaptation after 
he gave Miss Dalrymple the go-ahead and was filled with loathing for 
it. He loudly denounced it publicly as ``a vulgar, common melodrama 
with an anti-Communist bias.'' When the play opened, Brooks Atkinson 
echoed Sartre's denunciation and wrote in The New York Times that 
it was a production that ``looked and sounded bogus.'' It quickly 
closed. But she scored many triumphs in the years that followed. Word 
of her organizational abilities spread and in 1951 the State Department 
asked her to arrange for what the United States would offer at the 
Berlin Arts Festival that year. In 1958, the State Department called 
on her again, this time to arrange for the performances sent by the 
United States to the Brussels World's Fair, including those by Harry 
Belafonte, William Warfield, Jose Iturbi and the Juilliard String 
Quartet. In 1953, she persuaded Jose Ferrer to star in and direct 
four plays at the City Center during an eight-week season: ``Cyrano 
de Bergerac,'' ``The Shrike,'' ``Richard III'' and ``Charley's Aunt.'' 
To help City Center grapple with its tight budget, Ferrer and all 
the cast members in these productions worked for the Actors Equity 
minimum. Ferrer called the center ``this happy beehive of the arts,'' 
and donated $1,000 to the cause. The season was a critical and box-office 
success. ``They have made the theater seem like a fresh, exciting, 
varied form of public art,'' Atkinson wrote in The Times. In 1956, 
Miss Dalrymple persuaded Orson Welles to appear in ``King Lear'' (he 
performed in a wheelchair after breaking a leg in rehearsals) and 
Tallulah Bankhead to play Blanche Dubois in ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' 
Both productions earned critical praise. Among Miss Dalrymple's other 
warmly received revivals were ``The Beggar's Opera,'' ``Brigadoon'' 
(with Edward Villela as the villain), ``Pal Joey'' (with Bob Fosse 
in the title role), ``Guys and Dolls'' (with Walter Matthau as Nathan 
Detroit) and ``The Pajama Game.'' When her revivals turned a profit, 
Miss Dalrymple used the money to subsidize City Center's other companies, 
the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera, both of which 
moved to Lincoln Center in 1964. Her revivals were doomed in the late 
1960s, however, when the city began to experience a series of fiscal 
crises. Among Miss Dalrymple's other books were an autobiography, 
``September Child'' (1963), ``Careers and Opportunities in the Theater'' 
(1969), ``Jean Dalrymple's Pinafore Farm Cookbook'' (1971) and ``The 
Folklore and Facts of Natural Nutrition'' (1973). As a producer, Miss 
Dalrymple tended to play down her adroit handling of the press, which 
is critical in the success of even the most expertly produced play. 
``I never went in for theme parties or the crazy events that publicists 
stage today,'' she said in 1993. ``I simply advertised the facts of 
the production. At City Center, that was always enough.''
