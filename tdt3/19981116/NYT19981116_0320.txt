With House Republicans picking their new leaders on Wednesday, Rep. 
Dick Armey's aides say he is confident of keeping his job as majority 
leader, but his opponents doubt he has the votes, and a nascent movement 
to draft a fourth candidate is still alive. Voting is by secret ballot, 
making it difficult for candidates to nail down commitments and track 
votes. The candidates have only to look at the leadership race four 
years ago for a stark reminder of how fluid commitments can be under 
the cloak of secrecy. Back then, consultants for Rep. Bill McCollum 
of Florida, a candidate for majority whip, claimed he had 110 votes; 
he received 28. ``They all lie to us,'' said one Republican who is 
campaigning on behalf of one of the candidates. Said another, ``This 
whole thing is an experiment in truth-telling.'' The three active 
candidates for majority leader _ Armey of Texas, Rep. Steve Largent 
of Oklahoma and Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington _ were all tied to 
their telephones Monday, trying to secure commitments from colleagues. 
They also were trying to talk in person, eye-to-eye, with members 
who are starting to filter back to Washington. ``These last two days 
we're spending checking and re-checking and making sure people are 
still there,'' said Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Armey. ``We're 
fairly confident.'' Other last-minute strategies include Largent's 
sending aides to pick up returning members at the airport and Ms. 
Dunn's pointing to the Democrats, who voted Monday to retain their 
all-male leadership team, to press her case that Republicans could 
bolster their image with a woman in a leading role. The most recent 
vote counts are: 71 votes for Largent and 71 for Armey, say Largent's 
aides, and 40 for Ms. Dunn. Ms. Dunn's aides say that Armey has 90 
votes, Ms. Dunn has ``above 70'' and Largent has 50. Armey's aides 
are not telling. ``You don't stop at 112,'' said Ms. Davis, the Armey 
aide, referring to a majority of the 223 House Republicans. ``Anyone 
who would claim victory at 112 obviously has not been through a leadership 
race.'' She added that Armey was pursuing a ``second-ballot'' strategy 
in case he fails to secure a majority in the first round of voting, 
seeking pledges from members for any second vote. Largent and Ms. 
Dunn are banking on a second ballot, each expecting the other to come 
in third on the first ballot and be forced out of the race, leaving 
either Largent or Ms. Dunn in a head-to-head match-up against Armey. 
Further complicating the vote-counting is a last-minute drive to draft 
Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois into the race. Rep. Michael Castle 
of Delaware and Thomas Ewing of Illinois wrote in a letter Monday 
to their fellow Republicans, ``We should not allow voting commitments 
to prohibit members of the conference from considering Dennis Hastert.'' 
They added, ``The action we are taking is not done at the request 
of Denny, but he has indicated that if he was truly the choice of 
the conference, he would serve.'' A spokesman for Hastert, who is 
the chief deputy whip, said the congressman would consider being drafted 
only if it looked as if he would win. ``If they came to him and said, 
`Here's a majority of the conference and they've all signed this statement 
that Dick Armey will not win and they want you,' he'd say OK,'' said 
Mike Stokke, the spokesman. ``That's highly unlikely.'' He is right 
so far. Castle said that as of Monday afternoon, just four Republicans 
had committed to Hastert _ and Hastert was not among them. Hastert 
is committed to Armey. In one of the more bizarre subplots of this 
leadership race, Hastert asked Armey to release him from his pledge, 
only to have Armey refuse. Hastert had pledged his support when Armey 
was running for speaker earlier this year on the chance that Newt 
Gingrich might step down to run for president. He sought release from 
the pledge after Gingrich resigned on Nov. 6. Hastert's spokesman 
said Monday that his boss would vote for Armey on Wednesday even if 
his own name is offered. Theoretically, Hastert could draw support 
from conservatives who are backing Armey and Largent. Hastert has 
a 100 percent rating from the American Conservative Union. He voted 
against increasing the minimum wage, in favor of repealing the ban 
on assault weapons and is strongly opposed to abortion. At the same 
time, Castle, a moderate, supports him. Castle said Hastert had the 
right temperament for the job and could ``keep the place moving forward.''
