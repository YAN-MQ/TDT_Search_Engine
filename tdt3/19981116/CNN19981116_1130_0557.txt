It happens only once every 33 years. Tomorrow, you can catch its effects 
in what some people call a shower of falling stars. Ann Kellan has 
more on the Leonid meteor shower. When the earth passes through the 
tail of a Comet known as the leonid meteor shower, people in Asia 
and Australia could be dazzled as thousands of shooting stars light 
up the early morning skies on November 18th. For everyone else in 
the world, you'll miss the drama because when the peak of the shower 
occurs, it will be daylight where you are. But if you set your alarm 
and wake up early Tuesday or Wednesday morning, you could see a shooting 
star a minute, streaking across the sky. It's a very rare occurrence. 
Arguably one of the rarest of astronomical occurrences. And it is 
unique in that anybody can wander outside. You don't need a telescope. 
Comet tempel-tuttle orbits the sun once every 33 years. Every November, 
the earth passes through some part of its long trail of debris. Since 
the Comet's orbit brought it close to the earth this year, the trail 
of debris is fresh and concentrated with tiny meteoroids that will 
hit the earth's atmosphere and explode into shooting stars. If you 
go outside, even though the peak time may not be visible from the 
particular part of the world you're at, there's a good chance you'll 
see enhanced activity from showers. You don't need special equipment 
to see the shooting stars, just your own two eyes. For many, some 
warm clothes, a comfortable lounge chair go to a wide open area away 
from trees and city lights, the darker the better, and just look up. 
Enjoy the show. The best time to see the storm is between 3:00 and 
6:00 A.M., November 17th and 18th, anywhere in the world. If clouds 
don't get in the way. Ann Kellan, CNN, Atlanta.
