Fans of Jennifer love Hewitt have seen her act, and now they can hear 
her sing. Paul Vercammen has more on this rising star. Isn't she pretty 
in pink. Okay, any color. Jennifer love Hewitt is now a multimedia 
presence. No, I wasn't dreaming. "I still know what you did last summer," 
starring love, as friends call her, hit number two at the weekend 
box office. Love's TV show, "party of five," remains popular with 
young audiences. You have found this thing that you're really good 
at. She's the subject of unauthorized biographies, dozens of web sites 
and magazine covers -- perhaps America's most popular 19-year-old 
girl next door. It's not awkward, you know, it's -- yeah, I get tired 
and I have a little more to do now than I did before, but it's really 
great and it feels really good and I'm incredibly just thankful and 
lucky. And did you know she sings the first single from the soundtrack? 
How do I know what's real when I don't even trust myself or what it 
is I feel I started singing when I was 6, and I didn't start acted 
until I was 10. So I've been singing a lot longer than acting. And 
I feel pretty good about it. On the horizon, Hewitt will star as her 
idol Audrey Hepburn in a Made-for-TV movie, and a romantic comedy 
she pitched and sold to newline cinema, "cupid's love." Plenty to 
brag about, but this actress would rather talk about the hazardous 
wet conditions while shooting the last summer sequel. Nobody else 
slipped, but you put a klutz in tennis shoes with no grip on them 
and in a rain thing, running down a hallway, it doesn't make for a 
Good combination. a better mix, her perfection of the horror scream. 
The loudness doesn't come from the throat. The sort of -- the vibration 
and the throttle -- isn't this great, I'm going to use medical terms 
-- comes from the throat, but the gutteralness and the sort of, like, 
anger and the big stuff comes from your gut and your toes. So why 
does Hewitt seem so unfazed by fame? She credits her mother, a speech 
pathologist. My mom is great. And she makes sure that the home environment 
is a home environment and has nothing to do with work. She's very 
honest with me and she keeps me really grounded. Hewitt's ego remains 
earth-bound while her career skyrockets. How do I know what's real 
when I don't even trust myself Paul Vercammen, "CNN Entertainment
