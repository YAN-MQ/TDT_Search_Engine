All across America, and we have been there so many times in the past, 
the america people are wondering what would happen to Saddam Hussein? 
Why do we wack up to the beginning of a military showdown and walk 
away. We asked Anne Thompson to get her reaction to what happened 
finally. To the visitors today at universal studios in California, 
the drama halfway around the world in Iraq seems like an annoying 
old rerun. I think it's just a game of cat and mouse. I think this 
is going to continue back and forth for quite a long time. In Chicago, 
the headlines tell the story of saber-rattling and settlement. I don't 
think we could have done anything else under the circumstances. In 
Dallas over lunch, the U.S. should follow-through on its threats against 
Saddam Hussein. If they don't go over, it's going to continue on and 
on and on. So far taxpayers have spent over $7 billion to keep Saddam 
in check since the gulf war. $1.4 billion the last time the U.S. beefed 
up its military presence in february. And the price tag for this effort 
could run hundreds of millions of dollars. In Los Angeles, this woman 
doesn't want to listen anymore. Eventually, you just start to tune 
out when you hear there's more negotiations and there's more conflict 
because there's so much of it going on these days. It's a rerun, they 
say, but this one has no ending. Just another crisis with Saddam looming 
in the future. Anne Thompson, NBC news, Chicago.
