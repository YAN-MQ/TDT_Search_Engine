KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore infuriated 
the Malaysian government Monday when he expressed support for the 
country's burgeoning reform movement that calls for greater political 
freedoms and an end to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule. 
Gore, in a dinner speech to leaders of the world's largest corporations, 
praised the ``brave people of Malaysia'' and said that robust global 
markets depended on freedom and democracy. ``History has taught us 
that freedom _ economic, political and religious freedom _ unlocks 
a higher fraction of the human potential than any other way of organizing 
society,'' said Gore, in the speech on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation summit. Gore's comments were made in front of 
Mahathir and several other Asian leaders. They enraged Malaysian trade 
minister Rafidah Aziz, chairwoman of the APEC trade negotiations. 
``That is a direct interference in the domestic affairs of the country,'' 
Rafidah angrily told reporters. ``For heaven's sake, try to understand 
what's really going on in the country before you open your mouth and 
put your big foot into it.'' She said Gore's speech reflected ``the 
narrow-mindedness of some people who do not understand what things 
are all about around here.'' Gore was standing in for Clinton, who 
canceled his visit to remain in Washington and deal with the U.S.-Iraqi 
standoff. The ouster of Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim 
and his subsequent arrest and beating while in police custody outraged 
world leaders. Anwar is standing trial on 10 charges of corruption 
and sexual misconduct, allegations he denies and calls trumped up 
to undermine his challenge to Mahathir. A series of violent demonstrations 
have rocked the normally placid capital for the first time in three 
decades. ``From Thailand to South Korea, Eastern Europe to Mexico, 
democracies have done better in coping with economic crises than nations 
where freedom is suppressed,'' Gore said. ``And so, among nations 
suffering economic crises, we continue to hear calls for democracy 
and reform in many languages. People's power, doi moi, reformasi. 
We hear them today _ right here, right now _ among the brave people 
of Malaysia.'' ``Reformasi,'' or reform in the Malay language, has 
become the battle cry of the anti-government movement here. It was 
the same chant used during the massive riots and student demonstrations 
in neighboring Indonesia, a movement that led to the end of President 
Suharto's 32-year rule. An anti-government demonstration planned outside 
the Putra World Trade Center where Gore delivered his speech never 
came off. Organizers said they were deterred by the water cannons 
and large police presence outside the massive hall. Rafidah, who on 
Sunday had a sharp verbal tussle with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright over the Anwar affair, called Gore's manners atrocious. ``We 
always expect lectures from people ... we are so used to it. But never 
in such a disgusting manner,'' she said. ``I mean, somebody should 
have told him that that's totally bad manners.'' When asked whether 
Mahathir was disturbed, Rafidah said: ``Our prime minister perhaps 
is not as uncouth as I am, but I am sure he feels bad.'' On Sunday, 
Albright met privately with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to express 
U.S. concern over her husband's case. For the first time since APEC 
summits began in 1993, human rights concerns have been widely discussed 
by the leaders, whose goal is to promote free trade in the region. 
During his meeting with Mahathir on Monday, Australian Prime Minister 
John Howard expressed concern about Anwar's treatment and trial. And 
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she planned to do that 
on Tuesday. Gore and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused 
to meet privately with Mahathir because of the Anwar affair. At the 
end of his speech, however, Gore returned to the head table and shook 
hands with the Malaysian prime minister. Other guests included Peru 
President Alberto Fujimori, Philippines President Joseph Estrada, 
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Vietnam Prime Minister 
Phan Van Khai.
