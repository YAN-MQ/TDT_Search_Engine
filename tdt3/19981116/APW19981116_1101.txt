The alleged leaders of an international prostitution ring went on 
trial Monday, but little light was shed on the network after two of 
six accused had their hearings postponed. Annika Brumark, 50, a former 
Swedish model, was excused because her attorney had been in a car 
accident. Another alleged ringleader, Jean-Claude Tunon, 73, founder 
of a school for hostesses, could not attend because he has been hospitalized 
for heart trouble. The two won't be tried until May. pickup 4th graf
