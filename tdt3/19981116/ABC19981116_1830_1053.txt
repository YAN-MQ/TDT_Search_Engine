In Japan today, the government has announced $196 billion worth of 
spending programs and tax cuts, designed to help pull the country 
out of its worst recession in 50 years. Many economists say it will 
offer only temporary relief. ABC's Mark Litke tonight, several very 
visible reasons why economic recover in Japan will be very difficult. 
a decade ago, here in Tokyo's ginza district, this one square yard 
of sidewalk was worth about 3 50e,000, the most expensive real estate 
on the planet. Today it would go for about $100,000, if anyone was 
buying, but they're not. All across Japan, real estate prices have 
plunged 50 to 0% for homes, offices, the entire market. So why aren't 
people buying yet? Jack Rodman, who Scouts real estate for potential 
U.S. investors, says the banks are the biggest culprits. The banks 
aren't loaning money. The reason the banks aren't loaning money is 
they're sitting on all these bad loans. And until they sell the bad 
loans and recapitalize the banks, this economy is going to be flat. 
Still, even if banks started making big loans tomorrow, Japanese consumers 
show no willingness to start borrowing. Some of the reasons will be 
familiar to Americans. Many here, like the satos, are reluctant to 
buy, because they're worried about job security. Or they fear that 
if they buy, property values could drop further or interest rates 
will rise. There are also some very Japanese reasons for the frozen 
market. For one, there are no big tax breaks for home buyers here, 
because of japan's cultural fixation on harmony in society. A tax 
break for homeowners would not be fair for home renters. That same 
cultural bias makes Japanese uneasy about buying property at distressed 
prices. They see it as unfair to the neighbors who bought when prices 
are higher. So, for the most part, Japanese people are standing Pat. 
The banks, the culture, all are taking their toll and all need to 
be addressed for Japan to have any chance of curing it's ten-yearlong 
real estate crisis. Mark Litke, ABC News, Tokyo.
