Steve Phillips returned as general manager of the New York Mets on 
Monday, eight days after he took a leave of absence to deal with a 
threatened sexual harassment lawsuit from a former employee. Mets 
owners Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday said last week the Phillips 
situation would be resolved one way or another by spring training. 
They chose to end it sooner rather than later. ``I needed to take 
the time away to spend with my family,'' said Phillips, who said he 
inflicted a ``significant wound'' on his loved ones. ``One has to 
accept responsibility for choices and decisions they make,'' he said. 
``I don't think my credibility as a general manager will be affected 
by this.'' The Mets have a sexual harassment policy, but do not explicitly 
prohibit relationships between superiors and their workers. The Mets 
still contend that the lawsuit from the former employee in the team's 
Florida office has no basis. ``I appreciate the support of the organization,'' 
Phillips said. At the time he announced his leave of absence, Phillips 
acknowledged having a consensual sexual affair with the woman, as 
well as other extramarital affairs. The woman was fired last winter 
when Phillips reorganized the team's minor league operations so that 
all officials would work out of the main office in New York. ``We're 
an organization, like most, that depends on humans,'' said David Howard, 
the Mets' chief legal officer. ``Mistakes happen. ... The image of 
the organization was not a serious consideration. This was a personal 
matter.''
