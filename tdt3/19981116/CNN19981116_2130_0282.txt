The justice department has dismissed many of the misconduct allegations 
against independent counsel Starr, saying they don't warrant further 
investigation. But some allegations still are pending. Among them, 
that Starr discouraged Monica Lewinsky from contacting her lawyers 
and her mother when she was detained in January. Sources say it might 
be difficult to make a case out of that, because lewinsky did talk 
with her lawyers later that night. The justice department also is 
investigating Starr's connection to one of paula Jones' former lawyers.
