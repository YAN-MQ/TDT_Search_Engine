Concerned over the safety of peace verifiers in Kosovo after a reported 
intimidation attempt, an American diplomat pressed the Yugoslav president 
Monday to honor a U.S.-brokered peace agreement for the troubled province. 
Faced with NATO intervention, President Slobodan Milosevic on Oct. 
12 agreed to pull out his security forces, end a crackdown on ethnic 
Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence and allow a 2,000-strong 
mission of international verifiers to observe his compliance. William 
Walker, the head of the verification mission, met Milosevic in Serbia's 
capital Belgrade. Walker was due to speak to reporters on the talks 
later Monday when he returns to Kosovo. ``Yugoslavia sticks to the 
agreement,'' Milosevic said in a statement after the talks, and suggested 
that any post-agreement violence was the fault of radical Albanians. 
``The international community should exert firm and unambiguous pressure 
... to stop terrorist provocations of bandit groups intended to jeopardize 
the peace process in Kosovo.'' The issue of the peace monitors' safety 
came into sharp focus Sunday after a Yugoslav army vehicle reportedly 
fired machine-gun rounds over a car containing U.S. diplomatic observers 
in central Kosovo. A spokesman for the mission said a car from the 
Kosovo Diplomatic Observers Mission was near Dulje in the province's 
southwest when it encountered an army column coming the other way. 
As the observers' car passed by, the army vehicle, equipped with a 
heavy machine gun, fired a burst overhead, observers' spokesman Duncan 
Bullivant said. The Yugoslav army denied the shooting and said the 
bursts came from exhaust pipes of the army vehicles as their engines 
slowed down to pass the monitors. ``This type of behavior and activity 
is totally unacceptable,'' Bullivant said Sunday, saying random firing 
was not in the spirit of the cease-fire agreement and that the monitors 
had security guarantees from Milosevic. Beside expressing concern 
about ``the deterioration of the agreement,'' Walker also planned 
to suggest Milosevic withdraw more Serbian police from Kosovo, his 
adviser Mike Philips said. The meeting came as ethnic Albanian officials 
in Kosovo rejected the new initiative by Serbian authorities for long-sought 
direct talks. Xhemail Mustafa, a spokesman for Kosovo Albanian leader 
Ibrahim Rugova, denounced the latest Serbian initiative for the talks 
as a ``propaganda'' move, and said any such negotiations must be held 
under U.S. and European mediation. President Milan Milutinovic had 
proposed over the weekend to chair face-to-face talks with the ethnic 
Albanians in Pristina on Wednesday, with international officials in 
attendance as guests but not as active mediators. Mustafa argued Kosovo 
``cannot be treated as Serbia's internal matter'' _ as Serbian officials 
are trying to do by excluding foreign mediators _ since the majority 
ethnic Albanians are demanding outright secession. Scattered violence 
continued in Kosovo Monday. Two ethnic Albanian women were wounded 
by Serb police on a road about 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of Pristina, 
the Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's Albanian leadership, 
reported. The two were shot when police opened fire at a car that 
refused to halt for police, said the center. Serb sources in Pristina 
said Lapastica police station was attacked by Albanian ``extremists'' 
and that police returned fire. The Serb report stated no injuries. 
The reports could not be independently confirmed and it was not clear 
whether the shootings were related. A shootout between Serb police 
and Albanian rebels also occurred near Dulje Monday. No one was injured, 
Serb sources said. Earlier in the morning, a Serb police station in 
the town of Orahovac in central Kosovo was attacked, and a car in 
front of it was riddled with bullets, the state-run Tanjug news agency 
reported.
