With bells, parties and a blizzard of publicity, the newly merged 
DaimlerChrysler comes into being Tuesday when its stock begins trading 
on 19 financial markets around the world. A cocktail reception, live 
broadcasts to 250 locations in 62 countries, an array of promotional 
materials and a new advertising campaign aimed at investors are part 
of the push for a high profile ``Day 1'' launch of the trans-Atlantic 
car company. The chief executives of Daimler AG, Juergen Schrempp, 
and Chrysler Corp., Bob Eaton, attended a reception at Frankfurt's 
stock exchange Monday evening, after which they will fly to New York 
for the stock's debut on Wall Street. ``Today is just the beginning,'' 
Eaton said. ``I think that when you get this many excellent people 
_ the creative talents that we have here _ you can continue to expect 
excellent things from this company for decades to come. DaimlerChrysler 
starts out with a strong share of European and North American markets, 
and Schrempp and Eaton emphasized their goal of entering new markets, 
in Asia and Latin America. Together, the two men will ring a bell 
at the New York Stock Exchange Monday morning, in a symbol of their 
cooperation. The stock will have debuted six hours earlier, however, 
on the Frankfurt stock exchange at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT). Eaton dismissed 
rumors of job cuts, saying ``exactly the opposite'' was true. ``We 
expect to expand our presence in areas where we not currently represented,'' 
he said. ``And I can assure you that that will lead actually to jobs 
growth.'' The new DaimlerChrysler will become the world's third largest 
car company, after General Motors and Ford, with annual sales estimated 
at 260 billion marks (dlrs 162.5 billion.) Schrempp, 54, and Eaton, 
58, will jointly lead the new company for three years. After that, 
Schrempp is set to run it alone. In addition to moving into new markets, 
DaimlerChrysler also hopes to advance its non-automotive industries 
_ financial information technology, telecommunications and aerospace, 
according to promotional materials for the debut. More immediately, 
the ambitious merger will test the ability of the original two companies 
to blend their different cultures. To help, DaimlerChrysler's 431,000 
employees will get a quarterly journal on how it's going; managers 
will get an extra page with more details. The last significant hurdle 
before setting up DaimlerChrysler was completed a week ago, when Daimler 
announced 98 percent of its shareholders had swapped shares for the 
new company. Due to corporate differences, Chrysler shareholders did 
not need to swap, but voted on the merger. Four Daimler shareholders 
filed lawsuits with a German court trying to stop the merger, claiming 
they weren't properly informed about it. Daimler says the challenges 
won't affect the new company. The protesting shareholder's shares 
will be merged at a later, undecided date _ though for less money 
that those who swapped voluntarily.
