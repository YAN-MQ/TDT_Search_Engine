With golden sunlight glazing the autumn leaves and a light breeze 
sweeping down Broadway, it seemed a great day to honor John Glenn, 
and for tens of thousands of people, it was. But for the longest time 
Monday morning, almost the only people to show up to honor the 77-year-old 
astronaut, U.S. senator and undisputed American hero were the police, 
firefighters and sanitation workers assigned to handle the crowd. 
And even once the parade got under way, crowds were _ by New York 
standards _ modest if not thin, with indications along the traditional 
parade route that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani might have overestimated 
the public's appetite for a third ticker-tape extravaganza since October. 
Piles of special newspaper editions that were published to mark the 
parade remained unsold on sidewalks; once the parade started, the 
confetti that substitutes for ticker tape was sparse, and the large 
crowds never materialized. While the police estimated that 500,000 
people turned out to honor the astronauts of the recently returned 
space shuttle Discovery, the crowds were only three or four deep along 
much of the parade route. A ticker-tape parade last month for the 
Yankees, by contrast, drew an estimated 3.5 million people. Monday's 
turnout amounted to a pale reprise of the gigantic celebration for 
Glenn in March 1962 when he returned from his launch into space, the 
second American to do so. That parade set the all-time record for 
the dumping of ticker tape, 3,474 tons. ``It was tremendous then,'' 
said Rudy Josenhaus, who had left his accounting office to witness 
the celebration of Glenn's becoming the first American to orbit the 
earth. ``This is like Mickey Mouse. This is small potatoes.'' Corporations 
with offices along the parade route reported frenzied calls from mayoral 
aides urging them to dispatch employees to the street. Tickets to 
the private City Hall ceremony were being passed out until the very 
last minute. But for those who did show up, there were many cheerful 
scenes of people enjoying themselves during their brush with history. 
Fathers hoisted children on their shoulders, children waved American 
flags, and people lined up to buy commemorative T-shirts. A woman 
from Dallas beamed as she explained how she had emerged from the subway 
and found herself watching the parade. ``We just came out of the subway 
and stumbled right into it,'' the woman, Janella Cox, said. ``This 
is just too lucky.'' One 34-year-old father, Matt Moran, brought his 
3-year-old son, Harry, from Queens to watch from a second-floor office 
on Broadway. Moran carried a flag, and Harry a bullhorn. The two had 
been studying old National Geographic photographs of rocket missions 
in preparation for Monday's events. ``This is a ticker-tape parade 
worthy of its participants,'' Moran said. ``It's a connection with 
our history, history I want to pass on to my children.'' The parade 
_ which made its way through the traditional Canyon of Heroes, with 
Glenn and his wife, Annie, seated in a vintage Phaeton convertible 
_ also honored the other six crew members of Discovery: Lt. Col. Curtis 
Brown, the shuttle's commander; Lt. Col. Steven Lindsey, the pilot; 
Stephen Robinson, a mission specialist; Scott Parazynski, a mission 
specialist and the senator's attending doctor in space; Pedro Duque, 
another mission specialist, and Chiaki Mukai, the payload specialist. 
They and Glenn were given keys to the city in a ceremony on the steps 
of City Hall after the parade. Some suggested that the low turnout 
resulted from a lack of sufficient notification. But another reason 
may have been exhaustion from the Yankees' ticker-tape parade and 
another last month for Sammy Sosa _ or from the fact that a successful 
shuttle flight would naturally have trouble competing with a world-champion 
home team. Others noted that the first time Glenn went into space, 
he was a pioneer venturing into unknown territory. And while even 
Glenn himself worried this time about his fitness for the trip _ whether 
his eyeballs would burst, or if he would suffer inner-ear damage _ 
this time around the environment was somewhat familiar. ``I think 
the whole thing was a goofy public-relations ploy,'' said Don Howes 
of New Jersey. Emma Diggs, who said she is in her 50s and works for 
a financial company in lower Manhattan, said she could not understand 
why the parade was ``such a big deal.'' ``He's done this before, and 
there are many people who have accomplished more and haven't been 
honored in this way,'' she said. But numerous others made it clear 
that they considered Glenn more of a hero than millionaire athletes. 
``It's a shame more importance is placed on overpaid athletes than 
real heroes like John Glenn,'' said Neghan Zerener, a 23-year-old 
English major at William Patterson University in Wayne, N.J. Anthony 
Cecere, a marketing manager who lives in Rockland County, said: ``John 
Glenn deserves as much recognition as the Yankees. People have gotten 
complacent about the space program and the shuttle.'' Glenn's day 
began with a news conference and a breakfast at the American Museum 
of Natural History, which is building a new planetarium that will 
work closely with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
Ellen Futter, the museum's president, set the tone by saying that 
the museum's new ability to communicate directly with space stations 
meant that New York, sometimes called the capital of the world, was 
now the capital of the universe. She said this made Giuliani ``mayor 
of the universe,'' a remark that seemed to delight him. The light 
mood continued when Gabe Pressman, the Channel 4 newscaster, prefaced 
a question by telling Glenn that he had also covered Glenn's first 
New York parade. ``You're getting old, aren't you?'' Glenn said. Pressman 
shot back, ``You bet.''
