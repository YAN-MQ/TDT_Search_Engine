The Pernod-Ricard group of France is considering reneging on a deal 
to buy a century-old Armenian brandy distillery because of economic 
troubles in Russia, the distillery's chief export market, Armenia's 
prime minister said Monday. Russia is the main export market for the 
Yerevan Cognac Distillery, and its economic downturn has crippled 
sales in recent months. In May, Pernod-Ricard agreed to pay dlrs 30 
million for the government-controlled Yerevan Cognac Distillery and 
to invest another dlrs 5 million in developing vineyards in this former 
Soviet republic. In line with the agreement it signed with the Armenian 
government, Pernod immediately paid dlrs 2 million and was to put 
the rest in a bank account by Dec. 10. The French company recently 
approached the government to discuss revising, and perhaps abandoning, 
the deal because of the economic crisis in Russia, the distillery's 
largest export market, Armenian Prime Minister Armen Darbinian told 
a news conference. Russia's economic downturn has badly affected sales 
in recent months, he said. He refused to give figures or elaborate 
on the talks. The distillery was established in 1897. Distillery officials 
say that Josef Stalin presented Winston Churchill with a bottle of 
its 10-year-old, 100-proof brandy during a 1943 Tehran conference 
and that it remained the favorite of the British wartime leader until 
his death. Since Soviet times, Armenian brandy has been called cognac, 
drawing angry protests from France, which insists its producers have 
exclusive use of the term. The sale in May drew street rallies and 
parliament battles, as many people protested the deal saying the distillery 
was worth much more.
