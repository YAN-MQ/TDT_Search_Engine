Monica Lewinsky has signed a lucrative deal with Princess Diana's 
biographer Andrew Morton to write a tell-all book about her affair 
with President Clinton, her publishers said Monday. The U.S. network 
ABC said it has secured exclusive rights to her first television interview. 
British publisher Michael O'Mara, who put the Morton deal together, 
refused to confirm news reports that it runs to seven figures, but 
the New York Post reported Monday that the North American rights alone 
are worth that. The British news agency Press Association said Morton 
and Ms. Lewinsky could earn more than 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) 
from publication in Britain. ''It wasn't the money, she could have 
got much higher prices elsewhere,'' O'Mara said. ''She likes the idea 
of an author who is used to writing sympathetic books about women 
who have relationships with powerful men.'' The chairman of London-based 
Michael O'Mara Books said there is a ``strong personal chemistry'' 
between the former White House intern and Morton, whose book, ''Diana: 
Her True Story,'' blew the lid on the princess' troubled marriage 
to Prince Charles. ``We put the two of them together in a New York 
hotel room last week, and she said yes immediately,'' said O'Mara. 
The book, to be called ''Monica's Story,'' will be published simultaneously 
in the United States by St. Martin's Press of New York, said spokesman 
John Murphy. It is expected to be in stores by the summer. ABC said 
Barbara Walters will conduct the first exclusive television interview 
with Ms. Lewinsky for the network's ''20/20'' program. The broadcast 
date will depend on when Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers get permission from 
independent counsel Kenneth Starr for her to speak publicly about 
the Clinton affair, ABC said. Her immunity agreement contains a no-talk 
provision, and she must secure a release from Starr's office before 
talking to anyone in the media. Her ABC appearance will be for free, 
since major U.S. networks don't pay for interviews, but she would 
be allowed to sell foreign rights to the broadcast. British TV's Channel 
4 has said it is negotiating with Ms. Lewinsky. O'Mara said Morton 
already has conducted preliminary interviews with his subject. ''Monica 
is an intelligent, well-spoken, average American girl, not the foolish 
bimbo that the press paints her as,'' he said. ''That is an image 
she very much wants to change.''
