Singapore and Hong Kong officials would ensure that stock and futures 
speculators could not take advantage of regulatory loopholes when 
Singapore starts trading Hong Kong-linked futures contracts, the Hong 
Kong chief executive said Monday. Tung Chee-hwa told reporters that 
he discussed the contentious issue with Singaporean Prime Minister 
Goh Chok Tong at a meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum. He said the two leaders agreed that they would 
``work more closely in getting our regulation authorities to communicate 
with each other'' so that ``speculators would not take advantage of 
what is called regulatory arbitrage,'' or differences in trading regulations. 
The two cities have been feuding over the Hong Kong stock exchange's 
attempts to block its Singaporean counterpart's attempt to trade a 
Hong Kong-linked futures contract. The Singapore International Monetary 
Exchange, known as SIMEX, plans to start trading a contract linked 
to the Morgan Stanley Capital International Hong Kong Index, which 
mirrors the benchmark Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong. But the Hong Kong 
exchange has opposed the plan because of concerns over Singapore's 
lax regulations on the product. Trading is scheduled to begin on Nov. 
23. Hong Kong authorities blame speculators who take advantage of 
regulatory loopholes for causing havoc in its financial markets. In 
September, they introduced a series of controls to make speculative 
trading more costly, after spending U.S. dlrs 15.1 billion in an unprecedented 
stock and futures buying spree to drive them off. Hong Kong officials 
worry that SIMEX's move would make it more difficult for Hong Kong 
to monitor speculative trading. Nonetheless, Tung said he welcomed 
Singapore's competition in financial services, which is intensifying 
as the city-state tries to overtake Hong Kong's lead. ``I think competition 
is very good for us. We would try to be better. We will try to be 
more efficient. It's a challenge for use we'll have to overcome,'' 
he said.
