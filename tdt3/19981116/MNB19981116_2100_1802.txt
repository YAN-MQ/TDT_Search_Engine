Just since the gulf war, there have been three attacks on Iraq by 
the U.S. and its allies. A fourth was stopped at the last minute, 
Saturday morning at 9:00 A.M. but there have also been three massive 
military build-UPS, including the one that is under way but put off. 
There have been repeated attempts to remove Saddam Hussein from power 
as the head of Iraq. As Jim Miklaszewski reports tonight, it's been 
an expensive exercise in failure. Clinton called off the military 
air trikes against Iraq. We didn't all off the entire war. In fact, 
he pledged to step up U.S. efforts to drive Saddam Hussein from per. 
But it's not the first time the U.S. has tried. Intelligence sources 
tell NBC news that in the seven years since the end of the gulf war, 
the U.S. government has had at least six covert operations undertaken 
against Saddam, two described as serious. All met with failure or 
disaster. And in all, more than 4,000 dissidents have been killed 
by Saddam. Two years ago, a group of Kurdish dissidents working for 
the C.I.A. were wiped out. According to sources, one of the most promising 
efforts was to penetrate the upper ranks of Saddam's military to convince 
Iraqi officers to launch a Coup against Saddam. That effort ultimately 
failed because the Iraqi generals did not the U.S. to follow through. 
Other attempts also failed. Propaganda attempts. But the U.S. is prepared 
to try again. President Clinton and Congress have agreed to spend 
$97 million on Iraqi opposition groups in an effort to overthrow Saddam. 
The people in Iraq are the ones who can't -- are ready to move against 
saddam. But Iraqi opposition remains divided and may not be able to 
mount any real threat. The Iraqi opposition is very splintered, and 
no one should think that that's a quick solution to the problem of 
removing Saddam Hussein. But many fear this latest effort is also 
doomed to failure or worse. According to one senior Pentagon official, 
the $97 million earmarked for iraqi opposition is only enough to "arm 
them, train them, and get them killed." Ultimately, critics claim 
the failure to oust Saddam lies not with Iraqi opposition but with 
the lack of a coherent White House strategy. It's not whether or not 
we can build an opposition. The real crisis is that there's a hollowness 
in our policy. And many at the Pentagon tonight believe when President 
Clinton called off air strikes, he may have missed the best chance 
in years to get Saddam. Jim Miklaszewski.
