You've heard that laughter is the best medicine. Psychologically speaking, 
that may seem pretty obvious. But research has shown that laughter 
does indeed have an effect on most of the major physiological systems 
of the body as well. In the immune system, laughter is thought by 
some to increase the number of activated T-cells and natural killer 
cells. That doesn't mean a funny joke will keep you from getting an 
infection, but some researchers suggest it can help increase your 
resistance. Laughter is also used as a treatment because it can encourage 
muscle use and help get a patient's mind off disease. Check out CNN.com/health
