The United States is keeping up the pressure on Saddam Hussein to 
give U.N. inspectors unfettered access in Iraq. U.S. officials are 
warning the Iraqi president that military forces are poised to attack 
on a moments notice if he breaks the agreement which halted strikes 
this weekend. President Clinton is expected to comment on the Iraqi 
situation within minutes.
