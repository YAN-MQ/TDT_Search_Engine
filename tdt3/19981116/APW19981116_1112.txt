It used to be simple. American Jews used to feel close emotional ties 
to Israel. But today, the link is more tenuous, threatened by the 
growing assimilation of U.S. Jews and their more questioning attitude 
toward the Jewish state. In a push to strengthen the bond during this 
period of changing relations, Jewish philanthropists are trying to 
raise dlrs 300 million for ``Birthright Israel,'' a project to bring 
Jewish youths from around the world to Israel for 10 days of educational 
programs. Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of the Seagram Company who 
helped launch the project, said Monday he hoped the plan would help 
strengthen Jewish life in places such as America where an estimated 
40 percent of Jews now marry non-Jews. ``It gives them a real coming 
back to their roots,'' said Bronfman, a strong supporter of Israel. 
``This is where it all started. It gives them a chance to look at 
Israel today, modern Israel and gives them past, present, and hope 
for the future,'' Bronfman told The Associated Press. The project 
is being kicked-off as part of the General Assembly, an annual conference 
which opens Monday in Jerusalem. Attended by some 3,000 North American 
Jewish community leaders, the GA is being held in Israel for the first 
time as part of the country's 50th anniversary celebrations. ``Intermarriage 
and assimilation threatens like a centrifugal force to pull our people 
apart,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech 
opening the convention. Of the Birthright Israel program, Netanyahu 
said ``I know that nothing, nothing makes such an indelible impression 
on (youngsters). They either stay here or go back forever changed 
as Jews and they will touch the hearts and minds of other Jews,'' 
Netanyahu said. Miami cardiologist Jerome Reich, 61, whose four sons 
have all visited Israel, said such projects are crucial in sparking 
young people's interest in their Jewish identity but do not embody 
the entire Jewish experience. A visit ``is an adrenalin shot but there 
must be follow-up,'' said Reich, a delegate at the GA. Once Israel 
and American Jewry were closely bound by a shared past. The wounds 
of the Holocaust, participation in the unfolding drama of Israel as 
a fledgling nation battling for survival and even the Yiddish language 
kept them united in spirit. But, today the battles in a more secure 
Israel are less glamorous, more complex, and harder to rally around. 
American Jews generally practice the more liberal Reform and Conservative 
streams of Judaism, do not speak Hebrew, and are less comfortable 
stating opinions on a faltering peace process. ``There is clear evidence 
of the distancing of American Jewry from Israel,'' said Steven Cohen, 
a sociologist at Hebrew University who studies American Jews. Cohen 
said the trend among American Jews is to turn inward to their families 
and local communities for identity rather than to Israel, whose recent 
political policies confuse them both on the issues of peace and religion. 
``Israel itself has presented far more ambiguous images and it is 
difficult to maintain a one dimensional heroic romantic idealized 
image of the Israeli,'' Cohen said. Baruch Kostava, 47, a kibbutz 
member working as a representative of the movement in New York City 
spoke of the difficulties of finding common dialogue between the communities 
he works to unite. ``One builds a state not just around glory and 
euphoria but the every day,'' he said. Gail Hyman, Vice President 
of Marketing and Public Affairs for the United Jewish Appeal, the 
largest fund-raising arm of the Diaspora Jewish community, likened 
the relationship of between the communities to a maturing romance 
based more on a partnership grappling with complex issues than fawning 
in adulation. ``Maybe the first blush of romance is fading,'' Hyman 
said, ``We can't live off the past.''
