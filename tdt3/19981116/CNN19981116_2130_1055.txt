Business travelers may find themselves with plenty of company this 
holiday season. Lori Waffenschmidt has the story in today's edition 
of "working ahead." Some businesses are scaling back corporate trips. 
But for most companies, it's business travel as usual. In fact, many 
travel experts say hotel and airline bookings will remain strong well 
into next year. I've talked to several leading hotels, cruise lines, 
travel agents, and what we're finding is, while there's a lot of talk 
and a lot of fear that a Recession is coming, the reality is there 
has been very little drop off in bookings. We really haven't seen 
a decline in the business travel, and if anything, we've seen an increase 
in the leisure individual travel coming to our hotel. They've already 
pretty much locked into their travel for Thanksgiving or the holiday 
period, and that travel will uphold, keep up. Travelers will still 
find rooms in major cities expensive and seats on airlines hard to 
get, especially during the holidays. If you're trying to get a hotel 
room on a Wednesday night during a heavy business period in New York, 
you're probably going to still pay a lot of money. Airfare sales are 
going to start to happen very, very soon, which means that any seat 
on any plane is going to be sold out. And there's just not going to 
be room for anybody for a free award, let alone a paying passenger 
out there. Which means planning ahead and booking extra early. Lori 
Waffenschmidt, CNN, Atlanta.
