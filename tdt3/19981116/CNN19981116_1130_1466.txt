Customs agents in Melbourne, Australia, can look forward to some royal 
help. It will come in the form of these week-old puppies. Their father 
is queen Elizabeth's golden retriever. Their mother is the top sniffing 
dog in Australia's customs service. When they reach the age of 12 
months, they'll be trained to become sniffer dogs, just like mom. 
The pups will be assigned to airport security for the next summer 
Olympics.
