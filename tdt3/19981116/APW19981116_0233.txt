Concerned over the safety of peace verifiers in Kosovo, a senior American 
diplomat planned to press the Yugoslav president Monday to abide by 
the terms of a U.S.-brokered peace agreement for the troubled province. 
Under the Oct. 12 agreement, President Slobodan Milosevic had promised 
to pull out security forces, end a crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels 
fighting for Kosovo's independence and allow a mission of international 
verifiers to observe his compliance. William Walker, the head of the 
verification mission, was scheduled to meet Milosevic in Serbia's 
capital Belgrade to discuss the situation in the troubled province 
and raise international concerns with the persisting level of violence 
in Kosovo. The issue of the peace monitors' safety came into sharp 
focus Sunday after a Yugoslav army vehicle reportedly fired machine-gun 
rounds over a car containing U.S. diplomatic observers in central 
Kosovo. A spokesman for the mission said a car from the Kosovo Diplomatic 
Observers Mission was near Dulje, 35 kilometers (22 miles) southwest 
of Pristina, when it encountered an army column coming the other way. 
As the bright orange observers' car passed, the army vehicle, equipped 
with a heavy machine gun, fired a burst overhead, observers' spokesman 
Duncan Bullivant said. On Monday, the Yugoslav army denied the shooting 
and said the bursts came from exhaust pipes of the army vehicles as 
their engines slowed down to pass the monitors. ``This type of behavior 
and activity is totally unacceptable,'' Bullivant said Sunday, saying 
random firing was not in the spirit of the cease-fire agreement and 
that the monitors had security guarantees from Milosevic. Beside expressing 
concern about ``the deterioration of the agreement,'' Walker will 
aslo suggest Milosevic withdraw more Serbian police from Kosovo, his 
adviser Mike Philips said in Belgrade. ``We're going to see what he 
has to say, and see if he can in fact maybe even pull more of the 
Serbian police out of the region.'' Philips added. The incident came 
amid hopes for progress toward a political settlement for the restive, 
Albanian-majority province. Serb authorities, attempting a new initiative, 
invited Kosovo Albanians to hold face-to-face talks this Wednesday, 
with international officials in attendance. Serbian President Milan 
Milutinovic, one of Milosevic's closest aides, was due to travel to 
Pristina and initiate the talks. Members of the ethnic Albanian negotiating 
team, who have rejected several Serb invitations in the past, were 
planning to decide Monday whether to accept the offer. Veton Surroi, 
a member of the Albanian team, expressed doubts whether direct talks 
would start and said their main concern was the sincerity of the invitation. 
``It looks for now as if the Serbian side is only attempting to present 
itself as a party willing to cooperate,'' Surroi was quoted as saying 
by the independent Beta news agency.
