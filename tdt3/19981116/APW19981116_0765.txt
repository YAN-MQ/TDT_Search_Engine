The trial of a former Turkish Cabinet member on charges of aiding 
and abetting mobsters opened Friday. Former minister Eyup Asik resigned 
in September when televisions aired his taped conversations with Turkey's 
leading mafia bosses, Alaattin Cakici. He faces up to a year in prison 
if convicted. Asik is a member of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz' center-right 
Motherland Party. Three no-confidence motions are pending against 
Yilmaz' government in connection with the spreading scandal surrounding 
links between the mafia and the state, and Yilmaz himself is accused 
of having ties with organized crime.
