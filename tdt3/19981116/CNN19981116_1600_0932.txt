President Clinton is making remarks at the White House regarding the 
Iraqi crisis and here's what he had to say. I am pleased that the 
weapons inspectors will return to Baghdad tomorrow to resume their 
work. As I have said from the start, the best outcome is to get the 
inspectors back on the job, provided they have unfettered access and 
full cooperation. We know what the inspectors can accomplish.
