BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors are to return to Baghdad 
on Tuesday in the first test of Iraq's pledge to cooperate fully in 
eliminating its weapons of mass destruction. On Monday, the first 
U.N. relief workers pulled out in fear of a U.S. military strike returned 
to Iraq. And diplomats revealed the behind-the-scenes drama in Baghdad 
that led to Iraq's sudden announcement Saturday it would reverse course 
and end its blockade of arms inspectors. Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan's envoy to Baghdad, said in an interview that Iraq was 
being watched closely to measure its resolve in cooperating with the 
U.N. inspectors searching for forbidden weapons. ``Many members of 
the Security Council want the question of Iraq's cooperation with 
the inspectors to be tested and proved on the ground,'' Shah said. 
He added: ``If Iraq cooperates fully and unreservedly with the inspections 
due to begin in the next few days, the comprehensive review to be 
conducted by the council offers a hopeful sign for the future.'' Shah 
was to leave Tuesday for New York to brief Annan and Security Council 
members on the situation in Iraq. Of the about 150 U.N. relief workers 
pulled out last week, the first 30 returned on a special U.N. flight 
from Jordan, where they were evacuated, flight to Habaniya military 
air base west of Baghdad. About 120 more U.N. humanitarian workers 
were due overnight on a bus convoy through the Jordanian desert. The 
threat of military action was averted Sunday when President Clinton 
announced at a White House news conference that the United States 
had accepted the Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its 
three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections. That opens the way for 
a Security Council review of Iraq's elimination of its weapons that 
the Iraqi government wants to lead quickly to the lifting of punishing 
trade sanctions _ a move both the United States and Britain have resisted. 
The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, limit 
the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated Iraq's 
economy. The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until 
UNSCOM and the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency 
certify that Iraq has eliminated its lethal weaponry. UNSCOM spokeswoman 
Caroline Cross told The Associated Press in Bahrain, where the weapons 
inspectors were evacuated last week, that they expected ``full cooperation'' 
on their return. ``They (the inspectors) will be the first to know 
if the cooperation is full and unfettered or not,'' Ms. Cross said. 
Western diplomats in Baghdad expressed relief that the impasse over 
weapons inspections had been resolved without military action. There 
was great concern _ especially in neighboring countries _ that a missile 
strike would prompt Iraqi leader Saddam Saddam to ban UNSCOM forever, 
ending any hope of long-term monitoring to prevent Iraq from rebuilding 
prohibited weapons. One diplomat described UNSCOM as ``the only thing 
that will keep Iraq on a leash.'' The diplomats and Iraqi officials 
_ who spoke on condition of anonymity _ also described the series 
of secret meetings that preceded Iraq's Saturday announcement. Late 
Friday night, the ambassadors of France, Russia and China _ Iraq's 
defenders in the Security Council _ met with Foreign Ministry officials 
to warn that the United States was serious about a strike and urge 
Iraq to let the U.N. inspectors back. The Russian ambassador carried 
a letter from President Boris Yeltsin. Just hours later, at about 
2 a.m. Saturday (2300 gmt Friday), Iraq's ambassador in New York, 
Nizar Hamdoon, faxed a similar appeal from U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan to the Iraqi leadership in Baghdad. Iraq broke its silence 
12-1/2 hours later, when Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz telephoned 
Shah to say that there would be a ``positive reply'' to Annan's letter. 
But apparently the attack seemed close enough that Iraq wanted to 
get word out publicly. So an Information Ministry official issued 
a one-sentence statement at 3:30 p.m. (1330 gmt) Saturday to the scores 
of Western reporters drawn to Baghdad by the crisis. ``I have information 
that the leadership will respond positively to Annan's letter,'' the 
official said. By about 4:30 p.m., Iraq's formal response was read 
to Shah's office for transmission by fax to Annan. A typed copy signed 
by Aziz was delivered later. The two-paged letter promised that Iraq 
would renew cooperation with U.N. inspectors, but Washington viewed 
an attached annex as containing unacceptable conditions. Later that 
night, it took repeated phone calls to Baghdad to produce U.N. ambassador 
Hamdoon's three separate ``clarifications'' that Iraq's decision was 
unconditional _ which finally satisfied the Americans.
