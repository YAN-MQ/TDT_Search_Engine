President Boris Yeltsin visited his recently released envoy to Chechnya 
at a Moscow hospital Monday and conferred with Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov, who was heading to an economic summit in Malaysia. Yeltsin 
stopped by the Kremlin hospital to see Valentin Vlasov, his envoy 
to the breakaway republic of Chechnya. Vlasov, taken hostage six months 
ago by Chechen gunmen, was released last week and is now recuperating 
after the ordeal. Russian television showed a smiling Yeltsin embracing 
the haggard-looking Vlasov and presenting him with a bouquet of red 
roses. During his visit to the hospital, Yeltsin didn't undergo any 
medical checks, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said, according 
to the Interfax news agency. Also Monday, Yeltsin met Primakov at 
the Gorky-9 presidential residence near Moscow. The two discussed 
Primakov's preparations for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Interfax said. They also touched 
on other issues, including the Iraqi crisis, Yakushkin said. Over 
the weekend, Yeltsin sent a letter to Syrian President Hafez Assad, 
reiterating Russia's adherence to political settlement of the crisis, 
the presidential press service reported Monday. Defense Minister Igor 
Sergeyev, who is traveling in the Middle East, delivered the letter 
to the Syrian leader. Sergeyev also told reporters in Cairo on Monday 
that Yeltsin would travel to Egypt in March, Interfax reported. Yeltsin
