In a meeting that lasted twice as long as scheduled, Vice President 
Al Gore and Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Monday discussed Tibet 
and Taiwan, two impediments to U.S.-Sino relations. Tibet's spiritual 
leader, the Dalai Lama, is ``aiming at splitting the motherland,'' 
said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao after the meeting. 
There was no comment from the U.S. delegation after the two-hour meeting. 
Gore arrived Sunday to replace President Bill Clinton at the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation summit. Clinton canceled his visit because of 
the Iraq crisis. Last week, China protested Clinton's meeting with 
the Dalai Lama and a U.S. Cabinet official's visit to Taiwan, claiming 
the United States was interfering in China's domestic affairs. The 
United States was violating commitments to recognize Beijing's rule 
over Tibet and should refrain from political ties with Taiwan, Zhu 
said. Jiang told Gore he wanted Washington to ``to honor the commitment 
to the one-country policy.'' According to him, Gore said U.S. policies 
on Tibet and China had not changed. The Chinese leader ``spent quite 
some time to expand on our position and policies on Taiwan and Tibet 
in a clear manner.'' For the first decades of the Cold War, Washington 
was an ally of Taiwan, an island China considers a rebel province. 
The United States also provided funding for separatist guerrillas 
inside Tibet, the Himalayan region Beijing has ruled, often harshly, 
for 48 years. The Dalai Lama has been living in exile in India since 
1959. China has tried to woo and pressure foreign governments to keep 
Taiwan diplomatically isolated, and also wants to undermine the Dalai 
Lama's credibility and popularity abroad. The Dalai Lama and his ``clique 
are trying to mold the public opinion to cheat the international community,'' 
Zhu said.
