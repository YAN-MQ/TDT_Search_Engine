With bells, parties and a blizzard of publicity, the newly merged 
DaimlerChrysler comes into being Tuesday when its stock begins trading 
on 19 financial markets around the world. A cocktail reception, live 
broadcasts to 250 locations in 62 countries, an array of promotional 
materials and a new advertising campaign aimed at investors are part 
of the push for a high profile ``Day 1'' launch of the trans-Atlantic 
car company. The chief executives of Daimler AG, Juergen Schrempp, 
and Chrysler Corp., Bob Eaton, will attend a reception at Frankfurt's 
stock exchange Monday evening, after which they will fly to New York 
for the stock's debut on Wall Street. Schrempp and Eaton will ring 
the traditional bell at the New York Stock Exchange together, in a 
symbol of their cooperation. The stock will have started trading six 
hours earlier in Frankfurt, however. The ambitious, transnational 
merger will test the ability of the original two companies to blend 
their different cultures. To help, the new company's 431,000 employees 
will get a quarterly journal on how it's going; managers will get 
an extra page with more details. The last significant hurdle to the 
setting up of DaimlerChrysler was completed a week ago, when Daimler 
announced 98 percent of its shareholders had swapped shares for the 
new company. Due to corporate differences, Chrysler shareholders did 
not need to swap, but voted on the merger. Mostly owned by institutional 
investors, the hearty response from Daimler shareholders was expected, 
but four individual shareholders lodged legal challenges to the deal 
with a German court, alleging they weren't properly informed. Daimler 
says the challenges won't affect the new company, and the protesting 
shareholder's shares will anyway be merged at a later, undecided date 
_ though for less money. DaimlerChrysler will become the third largest 
car company in the world with annual sales estimated at 260 billion 
marks (dlrs 162.5 billion.) Schrempp, 54, and Eaton, 58, will jointly 
lead the new company for three years. After that, Schrempp is set 
to run it alone.
