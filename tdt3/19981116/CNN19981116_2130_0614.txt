Stargazers are hoping the space storm tomorrow will live up to its 
billing as the most intense meteor shower in more than 30 years. Satellite 
owners and operators aren't as excited. Anne Kellan tells us why, 
in this edition of "tech trends." Operators of the 600 or so satellites 
orbiting the earth are holding their collective breath. On November 
17th, the earth passes through a mine field of sand-grain size meteors 
traveling 100-times faster than speeding bullets through space. It's 
the Leonid meteor shower. For the first time, we have a threat to 
all our satellites that is potentially quite real and could be serious. 
Comet tempel-tuttle orbits the sun once every 33 years. Every November, 
the earth passes through some part of its long trail of debris. Since 
the Comet's orbit brought it close to the earth this year, the trail 
of debris is fresh and concentrated with tiny meteoroids that will 
hit the earth's atmosphere and explode into shooting stars. During 
the last heavy shower in 1966, there were only a few satellites in 
orbit. Now at risk are pagers, cell phone services, worldwide banking, 
navigation for aircraft television broadcasts -- not to mention military 
surveillance. No one knows for sure how these satellites will handle 
the onslaught from outer space, and it's not only damage to the outside 
of the satellite. Operators are more worried about damage to the electronics 
on board. A more serious threat is that when those particles of sand 
hit they produce an electrical charge. Chances are low, they say, 
of a satellite being totalled. You could have a switch that's thrown, 
you could have a thruster that fires erroneously and there would be 
some disruption in the quality of service. Many commercial satellite 
operators say they're taking precautions to prevent interruption of 
service such as angling their satellites solar arrays "on-edge" to 
the storm, in hopes of minimizing damage. While they don't anticipate 
major interruptions, many have back-up plans, though researchers say 
chances are about 1% a satellite will get hit. Ann Kellan, CNN, London,
