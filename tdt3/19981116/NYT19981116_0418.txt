Back in Indiana, they are talking about Peyton Manning coming of age, 
while here in the Jets' locker room some players wondered Monday just 
when the Jets will grow up. Just one loss, and now the Jets' psyche 
_ so healthy before kickoff against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday 
_ is being probed and dissected. The team, cornerback Aaron Glenn 
said, ``is at a crossroads.'' Quarterback Vinny Testaverde said Monday: 
``I don't think we came out with intensity. You could sense it during 
the game.'' The self-examination is worthwhile. The Jets, who won 
four consecutive games against teams with winning records, have now 
lost three games to teams with miserable records to drop to 6-4 overall. 
The Colts (2-8), the latest upstarts to sidetrack the Jets, scored 
with 24 seconds left in a 24-23 victory. Coach Bill Parcells' hauled 
in his first-year players _ including safety Kevin Williams, who missed 
three tackles Sunday _ for a meeting Monday. Presumably, it was to 
complain about their play. Adding to his gloomy Monday, Parcells mulled 
the Jets' next opponents, the Tennessee Oilers, this Sunday in Nashville. 
Perhaps luckily for the Jets, who have showed no fear of the better 
teams this season, the Oilers also have a winning record _ 6-4. ``With 
a young team,'' Testaverde suggested, ``you can be fooled by your 
record and think you're better than you are. We're not a great football 
team. We're a good football team and we can get to the playoffs if 
we continue to work hard.'' The loss to the Colts did not hurt the 
Jets as much as a victory would have helped them. By winning, they 
would have been 5-0 in division play. At 4-1, they still have the 
best division mark in the American Football Conference East, as well 
as the best conference record of 5-2. And the Jets are tied for second 
in the East at 6-4. ``But there's a big difference between being 7-3 
and 6-4,'' Testaverde said. That 7-3 record would look even more impressive 
because the 7-3 Dolphins, the 5-5 Patriots and the 6-4 Bills, go head 
to head over the next few weeks. The Jets face those teams over the 
last three games of the season. Parcells said he could not explain 
why the Jets made so many mistakes against the Colts. Normally, a 
team should win if it can produce any of the following: a return for 
a touchdown, a 100-yard rusher or a pair of 100-yard receivers. The 
Jets did all of these Sunday. ``Six or seven plays could have ended 
the game on a positive note for us,'' Parcells said, referring to 
blown tackles or dropped passes. ``They have one chance to win it, 
and they did it.'' The Colts' winning 80-yard drive included Marshall 
Faulk's fourth-and-15 reception from the rookie quarterback Manning. 
Three tacklers were supposed to have Faulk in their sights on the 
play, but he managed to get past Corwin Brown, Williams and Ray Mickens. 
Ultimately, Peyton connected for the pivotal touchdown on a 14-yard 
pass to Marcus Pollard, who was covered by Otis Smith. The smaller 
defensive back _ Smith is 5 inches shorter and 65 pounds lighter than 
Pollard _ was unable to stop the tight end. ``I stayed up all night 
reliving the play,'' Smith said. Said linebacker Bryan Cox, who is 
becoming the monitor of the club's mental health: ``We've got some 
guys on the team with learning disabilities because we just don't 
get it.'' As usual, his target was the ``younger guys,'' a vaguely 
defined group whom he gets on weekly, whenever he is trying to spur 
players to pay attention. Certainly, Parcells is a master of this, 
yet he seemed baffled by the loss. ``If we had been just a little 
bit sharper _ there was an alertness, an awareness missing,'' Parcells 
said. Parcells said he had come in very early Monday to look at films 
of the Oilers. Usually, he does not do that until he speaks to the 
players. ``I've already looked at three Tennessee films on both sides 
of the ball,'' he said at noon. Yet, Parcells' mood alternated from 
second-guessing plays to the reality of the Jets' situation: ``If 
we can play well from here on, that's what counts. But this was a 
missed opportunity because we could have put at least three teams 
behind us, at least temporarily.'' So, was this failure a sign of 
immaturity? ``No,'' Parcells said. ``It was a sign that we got beat.''
