For years, doctors have warned heart patients about the potential 
dangers of some dental procedures. Louise Schiavone reports, new research 
may take some of the sting out of those warnings. The dentist's chair. 
For the generations who grew up with frequent fillings and dental 
drillings, it's rarely been a fun place. Who likes going to the dentist? 
For 40 years, doctors have believed that one group has ample reason 
to worry. That's the small percentage of the population who, at one 
time or another, has been diagnosed with endocarditis, a potentially 
deadly heart inflammation. Also believed at risk, those with heart 
valve or other conditions making them vulnerable to endocarditis. 
Janice Moore knows what it's like. I recall my doctor telling me that 
the primary thing I had to be concerned about was that any time I 
went to the dentist or any time I had some kind of procedure that 
would expose my blood to bacteria, I had to be on antibiotics. So 
for these patients, dentists have required an antibiotic dose before 
certain procedures. Even if one patient should come down with a bacterial 
endocarditis because of a problem with dental treatment, it's one 
too many, as far as I'm concerned. But comparing endocarditis patients 
and others in the philadelphia area, researchers at the University 
of Pennsylvania concluded -- The findings impressed this cardiologist. 
I think the recommendations should be changed. It's hard for an individual 
doctor to do it, because there are issues of legal liability. So my 
hope is that organizations like the American heart association will 
set out new guidelines. But doctors expect conventional practices 
to change slowly. The American heart association comments that while 
they regard this latest finding "with great interest," they continue 
to recommend that antibiotics precede invasive dental procedures for 
patients vulnerable to endocarditis. Louise Schiavone, for CNN, Washington.
