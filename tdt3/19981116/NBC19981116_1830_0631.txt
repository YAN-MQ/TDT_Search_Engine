Today's good feelings on Wall Street had to do with an economy that 
seems to be bouncing way back here and around the world. NBC's financial 
correspondent is Mike Jensen. It's the best evidence yet that the 
summer squall that hit the economy has come and gone -- stocks surging 
up 20% since the end of August, up 14% so far this year. Foreign economies 
on the mend, with help from the U.S. and today, holiday shoppers out 
in droves. Retailers looking for a 5% increase in business between 
now and Christmas. Now's the time to spend maybe a little bit more 
than I would have. We're already seeing an increase in traffic in 
the store. It's not wishful thinking. Retail sales were up 1% in October. 
And the consumer sentiment index, the best clue to how much shoppers 
will spend, up 5%. why? Partly because of the stock market comeback 
from the midsummer plunge and the warnings that the U.S. was headed 
for a recession or worse. This just five weeks ago. There's a 25% 
to 30% risk that you could have a depression in the United States. 
Why the sudden reversal? Because the overseas crises that were starting 
to eat away at the U.S. economy are easing. In Malaysia today, vice 
President Gore promising American aid. Working together to reshape 
our world financial architecture. And in the world's biggest economic 
trouble spot, Japan, word today of almost $200 billion worth of tax 
cuts and spending by the government, to pull Japan out of its recession. 
In the U.S., the fed meets tomorrow to consider another interest rate 
cut. With or without the cut, analysts say the odds of a recession 
now are almost zero, that the U.S. economy has weathered some serious 
shocks, come out of it healthy, and will probably stay that way for 
another year. Mike Jensen, NBC news, New York.
