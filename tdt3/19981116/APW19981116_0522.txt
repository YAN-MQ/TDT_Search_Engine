Fighting in eastern Congo has driven at least 55,000 people from their 
homes in eastern Congo since hostilities erupted between rebel and 
government forces on Aug. 2, the U.N. refugee agency said Monday. 
In a breakdown, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said more 
than 14,000 Congolese from the Lake Tangyanika towns of Uvira, Baraka 
and Fizi had crossed the lake to Tanzania since the start of the conflict, 
and more than 100 refugees were still crossing daily. Another 6,500 
Congolese crossed the border from south Kivu to Burundi, and 500 crossed 
into Rwanda, the agency said. Reports from humanitarian workers indicated 
that over 40,000 more people had fled their homes but remained in 
the same regions, the U.N. agency said. It said between 20,000 and 
25,000 people may have been displaced in the area around the rebel 
stronghold of Goma at the northern end of Lake Kivu; another 12,000 
were displaced around Uvira, and 14,000 people had fled their homes 
south of Uvira. Meanwhile, in northeastern Congo, near the border 
with Sudan, a UNHCR camp housing Sudanese refugees was attacked in 
October, and 17,000 refugees were chased back into Sudan, UNHCR said. 
The U.N. organization said a similar raid Nov. 6 left two refugees 
dead in the Central African Republic at a camp for Sudanese refugees 
70 kilometers (43 miles) from the border with Sudan and just 10 kilometers 
(6 miles) from the Congolese border. The refugee agency also expressed 
concern that Rwandan Hutu men who are camped among bonafide refugees 
in the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic are trying 
to cross into Congo-Kinshasa to join the fighting there on the side 
of President Laurent Kabila. The agency said that since early November 
between 3,000 and 5,000 Rwandan Hutu men have crossed the Congo Rivere 
from Congo-Brazzaville, while Rwandan Hutus in the CAR had threatened 
UNHCR staff with violence if they were not allowed to leave. The U.N. 
agency said its personnel are not in a position to halt these departures 
and called on states to take necessary measures to stop refugees from 
taking up arms.
