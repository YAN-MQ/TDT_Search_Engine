In Australia, some puppies with ties to the British throne will learn 
an important job soon. These golden retrievers are offspring of queen 
Elizabeth's favorite retriever. After some time with mom, customs 
agents will pick the most able pups to participate in a drug-sniffing 
course. Those who pass will join an airport drug squad for the 2000 
Olympics.
