Hundreds of demonstrators marched through the Chechen capital Grozny 
on Monday to protest a court conviction against a prominent opposition 
leader, Russian media reported. Chechnya's Supreme Sharia Court sentenced 
former rebel leader Salman Raduyev on Nov. 4 to a four-year prison 
term for attempting to overthrow the government. The protesters, mostly 
pensioners, gathered in front of Grozny's main court building and 
demanded that Raduyev's case be reviewed. Raduyev and his forces captured 
the main television center in Grozny on May 21, killing the national 
security chief. That was apparently the basis for the charge against 
him. More than 200 Chechen policemen joined in the search for Raduyev 
on Monday, but failed to capture him, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. 
Chechnya has suffered a wave of violence, theft, and kidnappings for 
ransom since its 1994-96 independence war with Russia. No country 
has recognized its claims of sovereignty. Also Monday, Chechen President 
Aslan Maskhadov told the regional prosecutor general's office to open 
a case against the organizers of the Chechen People's Congress, which 
called for the president's removal. The congress is led by rebel leaders 
Raduyev, Shamil Basayev and Khunkar Israpilov. Maskhadov said the 
congress ``may destabilize the situation in Chechnya and split society,'' 
according to the Interfax news agency, but added that ``attempts of 
destructive forces to shake the state power loose are doomed to failure.''
