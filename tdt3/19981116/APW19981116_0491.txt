A miner was killed by falling rocks at a mine in eastern Ukraine, 
bringing the number of Ukrainian miners killed on the job this year 
to more than 330, officials said Monday. The accident occurred Sunday 
at the Kalinina mine in the Donetsk region, the Emergency Situations 
Ministry said. No further details were provided. A total of 1,402 
workers have died in job-related accidents in Ukraine in 1998, according 
to the State Committee for Labor Safety. Of these, the largely government-owned 
coal industry has accounted for 333 deaths, up from 290 for all of 
last year. Despite frequent miner strikes, the cash-strapped government 
has failed to modernize the deteriorating coal mines and improve safety 
conditions.
