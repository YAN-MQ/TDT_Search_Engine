The United States, its allies and past defenders of Iraq said Monday 
that they did not expect President Saddam Hussein to cooperate with 
U.N. weapons inspectors, and that if he broke his promise it would 
set off a military response without a Security Council debate. Although 
President Clinton stayed his hand over the weekend, in part because 
of his concern about losing international support for an attack on 
Iraq, there was an unusually strong consensus Monday that American 
and British bombing was almost inevitable. American and U.N. officials, 
along with diplomats from a variety of countries, including some that 
have been sympathetic to Iraqi arguments in the past, said the respite 
was temporary. The situation is markedly different from past crises, 
the officials said, with Saddam having no further room for maneuver 
in the Security Council. As U.N. weapons inspectors prepared to return 
to work in Iraq, most officials said they expected the real test of 
Saddam's willingness to comply to come in the next two or three weeks. 
They said that will occur as soon as the chief inspector, Richard 
Butler, can assemble the experts he needs to conduct surprise inspections 
at the sorts of sites from which Saddam has been barring the U.N. 
specialists. ``We're setting off into some pretty important territory,'' 
Butler said in an interview in New York. ``It is well understood by 
all concerned that this is not ephemeral. This is real. This is serious.'' 
American and British forces are standing by, in new locations within 
striking distance of Iraq, and could be sent to combat in hours, rather 
than the days that it took for the most recent buildup, American officials 
said in Washington. ``The world is watching Saddam Hussein to see 
if he follows the words he uttered with deeds,'' Clinton said in brief 
remarks Monday. ``Our forces remain strong and ready if he does not.'' 
Saddam could ``comply and give up his weapons of mass destruction,'' 
a senior American official said Monday. But he called that possibility 
``highly unlikely.'' ``It's more probable he will not comply and there 
will be a confrontation,'' the official continued. ``But it will be 
under circumstances of our choosing. There's no question in my mind 
that when we act we will do so in such a way that it will be sustainable 
internationally and domestically.'' Saddam averted an American attack 
over the weekend by promising once again to cooperate fully with the 
United Nations Special Commission, known as Unscom, and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, to let them inspect whatever sites they choose 
and to hand over crucial documents on Iraq's secret biological and 
chemical weapons. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the test period 
would not be long. ``I think that we will see very quickly, in the 
next few weeks or perhaps even longer, but nonetheless within a short 
period of time, as to whether he is going to fully comply,'' Cohen 
said. ``I think everyone understands that this is the last go-around 
as far as Saddam is concerned.'' In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair 
said that next time there would be ``no warnings, no wrangling, no 
negotiations, no last-minute letters.'' In remarks to Parliament, 
Blair said, ``The next withdrawal of cooperation and he will be hit.'' 
Butler said he expected to restart the comprehensive monitoring of 
Iraqi sites on Wednesday, with inspectors' taking air, water and soil 
samples and repositioning and checking cameras. Challenge inspections, 
in which experts armed with clues demand entry to new sites to check 
for prohibited arms, components or documents, will follow as soon 
as Butler can assemble international teams of specialists. Butler 
said he hoped to concentrate initially on missile systems, where only 
a few issues remain to be settled, and on chemical weapons. More is 
known about Iraq's chemical weapons program than, for example, its 
biological weapons. American and U.N. officials said Unscom, in particular, 
wants two documents, one on chemical weapons development, found last 
summer but seized by the Iraqis, and one on biological weapons, which 
Unscom officials know about but have never seen. The International 
Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna will also send additional inspectors 
to Iraq, perhaps later this week. But officials say that other than 
long-term monitoring, there is little left for Iraq to do on the nuclear 
issue beyond passing a law. Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative 
and the Security Council's chairman of the Iraq sanctions committee, 
said Monday that ``nobody really knows'' how much cooperation the 
inspectors will not get. ``The real test is on the ground,'' he said. 
``We have the experience of the past, and we have to be cautious.'' 
American and British forces remain on standby around the Persian Gulf 
and could attack Iraq with little preparation, a senior American official 
said. While it took eight or nine days to prepare for the strikes 
that were aborted on Saturday, the official said, it would take less 
time now, and that would mostly be spent in insuring that U.N. workers 
are evacuated from Iraq and key allies like Israel are informed. The 
senior official was eager to defend Clinton's Saturday morning decision 
to abort air strikes on Baghdad when it became clear that Saddam appeared 
to be backing down from his refusal to cooperate with the U.N. weapons 
inspectors. If the United States had bombed on Saturday, the official 
said, ``we are the ones who would be isolated and the target of criticism, 
not Saddam Hussein.'' The Arab world would be split, Saddam would 
receive undeserved sympathy, the United States would be ``accused 
of killing Unscom'' and the ``good word'' of the United States would 
be tarnished, he said. ``It matters that the world believes in the 
word of the United States,'' the official said. If Washington had 
attacked despite indications that Saddam was about to do what was 
demanded of him, ``it would have called into question our own long-term 
credibility,'' he said. The official insisted that Washington is pursuing 
``a long-term strategy'' and is better positioned than before. ``We've 
positioned ourselves extremely well'' if Saddam reneges again, he 
said. The inspectors of Unscom now have more support from the Security 
Council than they've had in nearly two years, another senior American 
official said. ``The whole world supports Unscom's right to go wherever 
it wants in Iraq.'' That provides an extraordinary window for inspectors 
to work, the official said, at least until Saddam decides to close 
it.
