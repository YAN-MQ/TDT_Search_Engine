GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley 
on Monday inaugurated a dlrs 6 million water distillation plant in 
the new Gaza Strip industrial park and pronounced the product ``laziz,'' 
Arabic for delicious. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat joined Daley 
in a tour of the water treatment facility that was funded by the U.S. 
Agency for International Development and built by a U.S. contractor. 
Sub-contracts were given to Palestinian firms. The opening of the 
Gaza industrial park at the Karni crossing between Israel and the 
Gaza Strip is to open soon as part of last month's Wye peace agreement 
negotiated by Israel and the Palestinians. The project will create 
about 20,000 jobs for Palestinians from the poverty-stricken Gaza 
Strip. ``I believe very strongly that if peace is to be lasting, it 
must be built on economic stability and jobs,'' Daley said. Arafat 
thanked Daley for ``his help in our economy and in our production 
and in our trade.'' Palestinian Industry Minister Saadi Krounz said 
the Palestinian Authority was very committed real partnership between 
the private investment sector and the public sector. Krounz said there 
are plans to open two more distillation sites in the West Bank. Daley 
said the industrial park will generate interest around the world. 
``I know what they will see, new partners, new businesses and new 
jobs in a new Middle East,'' Daley said. Daley later inaugurate a 
U.S. trade office in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Speaking to Palestinian 
businessmen there, Daley said U.S. businesses wanted to support the 
peace process. He said the Middle East must form a regional economy 
if it is to be a player on the world scene. ``We must get rid of trade 
barriers.'' Daley has been promoting regional economic cooperation 
during this visit to the Middle East. He has said that only 7 percent 
of Middle East trade is with other Middle Eastern countries. ``That 
concept of positive regional cooperation and the impact it can have 
on the people in the region has got to be at the forefront,'' Daley 
told reporters at a news conference. He contrasted Middle Eastern 
trade with that of Europe, where two-thirds of its trade is with other 
European nations, and the United States whose largest trade partners 
are Canada and Mexico.
