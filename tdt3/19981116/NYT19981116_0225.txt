Yogurt, Threat or Not? Q. If I eat a lot of yogurt, will the bacteria 
in it make me sick? A. There is no evidence of human health problems 
from yogurt with live bacteria, said Dr. Kathryn Boor, assistant professor 
of food science at Cornell University, and there is some evidence 
the bacteria may be beneficial. ``There is a new field of study called 
probiotic bacteriology that is investigating whether living organisms 
can help colonize the gastrointestinal tract and keep out bad bacteria,'' 
Dr. Boor said. It is controversial whether yogurt bacteria survive 
there, she said, and conclusions must await completion of research, 
but there is ``better than anecdotal evidence'' of such benefits. 
The theory is supported by studies of young chicks sprayed with bacteria 
present in adult chickens. The chicks take up these microbes and are 
not colonized by harmful salmonella, an effect called competitive 
exclusion. Dr. Boor said she saw no reason to seek out yogurt without 
live cultures for fear of danger from the bacteria that ferment milk 
into yogurt. The most commonly used culture is Lactobacillus delbrueckii 
bulgaricus in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus. Both are 
harmless in the gut, if they survive, she said. In Dr. Boor's research 
in the laboratory, so-called competition studies found this combination 
``very competent'' in killing a disease-causing microbe like E. coli 
O157:H7 during yogurt production. Readers are invited to submit questions
