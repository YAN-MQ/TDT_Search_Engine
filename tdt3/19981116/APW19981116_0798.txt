A Croat man suspected of working for the former Yugoslav secret police 
is to be extradited imminently after serving a jail term for trying 
to murder a Croatian emigre, the government said Monday. Vinko Sindicic 
is to stand trial in Croatia for the murder of a Croat dissident, 
Franjo Busic, in France in 1976. A Scottish Office spokesman said 
extradition papers had been signed and Sindicic would probably leave 
Britain later Monday. ``He was taken from his prison cell this morning 
and he is in the process of extradition,'' said the spokesman, speaking 
with customary anonymity. Details of the journey were not disclosed 
for security reasons, he said. A Scottish court jailed Sindicic for 
15 years in 1989 for trying to murder Nikola Stedul with a silenced 
pistol outside Stedul's home. Stedul was wounded but survived. Stedul, 
now 60, left Yugoslavia as a young man to avoid military service and 
settled in Scotland in 1975. At the time of the attack he was president 
of the Croatian Movement for Statehood, which sought to remove Croatia 
from the then Yugoslav republic. Croatia applied for Sindicic's extradition 
in 1993. At his Scottish trial Sindicic denied being a member of the 
secret police and pleaded innocent.
