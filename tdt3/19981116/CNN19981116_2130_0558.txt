The Supreme Court has rejected a challenge to a case that could have 
affected election campaigns. In a 1976 ruling, the court prohibited 
limits on campaign spending in federal elections, citing free speech 
issues. The city of Cincinnati wanted that decision reviewed, saying 
unlimited spending gives an unfair advantage to rich candidates and 
incumbents. But the case was rejected without comment, so no new national 
precedent was set.
