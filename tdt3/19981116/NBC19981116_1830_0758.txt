Finally today, a settlement in the cigarette wars. Cigarettemakers 
agreed to a $206 billion settlement with eight states to pay the Medicaid 
costs of caring for six smokers. That's nowhere near the deal that 
died last summer but it requires companies to stop some forms of advertising 
that reach children. Washington's state attorney general summed it 
all up today. It will change the way we see tobacco. Under this proposal, 
billboards gone. Taxi and transit ads gone. Hats, shirts, backpacks 
with tobacco brand names, gone. Joe camel and any replacement for 
Joe camel, gone. Some of those states will receive hundreds of millions 
of dollars a year every year for as long as the agreement goes on, 
as long as the tobacco companies are in business. President Clinton 
called the settlement a step in the right direction but said he'll 
push for more comprehenssive antitobacco legislation in the new congress.
