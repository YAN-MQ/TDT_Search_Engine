Let's talk about the impeachment process, Gwen. We have an interesting 
quote later from Henry Hyde published in one of the three big news 
weeklies act wanting it to go away. There is one witness, and he starts 
Thursday morning. It is Ken Starr. Tell us what to expect. Well, all 
the jockeys has begun in advance. John Conyers, a ranking democrat 
in the committee and Henry Hyde and Ken starr exchanged letters today, 
the democrats saying we don't only want to talk to Hyde but all of 
his deputies. That doesn't lend itself to a one-day, simple hearing. 
Hyde responds I don't think that's what you have in mind. We want 
this over with. He knows he has to move forward on this. He would 
really like it to be over by the fist or second week, certainly, of 
December. So, you're going to see a lot of jockeying where everyone's 
waiting to see how Ken Starr handles the Judiciary committee, known 
for its unruliness. There is an inability to let him finish what he 
comes to say. Starr has two hours to speak. Each member of the committee 
has five minutes to speak. It'll be a long, long day or days. That's 
a congressional minute. We'll see you on the hill Thursday.
