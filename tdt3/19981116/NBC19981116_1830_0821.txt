When we come back, NBC news "in depth" -- trying to overthrow Saddam. 
So many plans, but so far, no success. Will the U.S. ever break the 
Iraqi dictator's grip on power? G, thinking: T-bone! T-bone! Looking 
for a T-bone! Chewy, meaty T-bone! At the big T-bone store! There's 
one! No, that's not one. Over there! no! no! On that shelf! ahh! Too 
green! Wait a minute! There! A whole package of little chewy, meaty 
T-bone steaks! Ya-hoo! I'm waking up! Mama brought you some T bonz 
dog snacks. Made with real meat, so dogs think... It's a T-bone! Resealable 
T bonz brand from Purina. It's a T-bone! Dr. Scholl's next stop: San 
Francisco. Let's talk about feet. I do have corns. I've tried band-AIDS. 
They don't get rid of the corn. This is Dr. Scholl's cushlin gel corn 
removers. The cushlin gel relieves the pain. The medicated disk removes 
the corn. It just feels so much better. My work here is done. Come 
on. Let's look. - looking for? - I had no idea. More cough relief? 
Vicks 44 has a variety... of eight-hour formulas, so whatever kind 
of cough you have-- the things you learn. You get more with vicks 
44.
