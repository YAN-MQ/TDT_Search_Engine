Germany's new chancellor, Gehart Schroder says his country has no 
new aid for Russia. But will help Moscow with its anti-crisis plan. 
It's Schroder's first trip to Russia, after defeating Helmut Cole 
in September. NPR's Michelle Kellerman reports from Moscow. Schroder 
says he's ready to cooperate with Russia. To help it come up with 
what he calls an internationally acceptable economic plan. One that 
would be supported by the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund. He says that the Russian government's anti-crisis proposals 
provide a good start. But as he spoke to reporters after talks with 
Prime Minister Yegemi Primacof, the German Chancellor ruled out the 
possibility of economic aid. He also suggested he wants to shift the 
emphasis of bilateral relations away from personal ties between his 
predecessor Helmut Cole, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Schroder 
is meeting various political leaders during his two day stay. He's 
expected to meet President Yeltsin tomorrow, depending on the Russian 
leader's health. Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, Moscow.
