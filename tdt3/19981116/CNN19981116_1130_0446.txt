Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is suspending a 
troop pullback in the West Bank until the Palestinians drop plans 
to declare unilateral independence in may. Netanyahu made the announcement 
in a speech to parliament that began a Two-day debate on the agreement, 
under which Israel is to withdraw from 13% of the West Bank by the 
end of January. The prime minister is upset over recent remarks by 
Palestinian leader yasser Arafat, who has renewed a pledge to declare 
statehood in may.
