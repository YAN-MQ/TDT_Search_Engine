A new CNN/"USA today"/Gallup poll suggests an increasing number of 
people now believe Starr's report on President Clinton is unfair and 
distorted. A similar poll conducted in September when the report first 
was released found almost half of those polled thought the report 
was fair and accurate. The new poll also found -- 62% of Americans 
disapprove of how the GOP is handling the investigation. That number 
has been increasing steadily since September. And 39% would like the 
impeachment matter to be dropped. 35% prefer censure with no hearings. 
26% believe the hearings should continue.
