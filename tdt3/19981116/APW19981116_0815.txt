Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Monday that he is suspending 
an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank _ scheduled for later this 
week - until the Palestinians drop plans to declare independence in 
May. The Palestinians accused Netanyahu of using excuses to get out 
of his commitments. Netanyahu made the announcement in a speech to 
parliament that kicked off a two-day debate on the agreement under 
which Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the 
end of January. The prime minister is upset over recent remarks by 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat who has renewed a pledge to declare 
statehood in May and said that ``our rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem. 
``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these circumstances 
... until these things are corrected in public,'' Netanyahu told legislators 
in a speech frequently interrupted by heckling. Netanyahu said he 
would convene his Cabinet on Wednesday to review the suspension of 
the withdrawal. On Sunday night, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators 
had agreed that Israel would withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank 
by the weekend. Under the original time table, the Israeli withdrawal 
was to have begun Monday. The land-for-security agreement is assured 
the support of some 90 of 120 legislators, and Netanyahu's speech 
was mainly aimed at hard-liners who have threatened to topple his 
coalition. Netanyahu portrayed himself as a tough negotiator who would 
not put up with what he said were repeated attempts by the Palestinians 
to violate the accord. ``In the past year and a half, we haven't moved 
an inch,'' Netanyahu told the Knesset. ``Unlike others, we do not 
believe in illusions, a new Middle East,'' Netanyahu said. ``The Palestinians 
will test us every day and we will stand firm.'' Later, he spoke more 
vehemently. ``What sort of thing is this, this threat of violence 
with rifles? If we do not accept the Palestinian demand of a division 
of Jerusalem, they will use those rifles against us?'' he told Israel 
TV's Channel Two. ``There cannot be such dictates.'' Arafat adviser 
Ahmed Tibi said Netanyahu was ``trying to avoid and escape implementation.'' 
Tibi also accused Israel of violating the accord with inflammatory 
statements, referring to Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon's call 
to Jewish settlers to seize land in the West Bank before a troop withdrawal. 
Before his speech, Netanyahu called Arafat to seek clarifications, 
but was not satisfied with Arafat's responses, Israel radio said. 
Palestinian officials confirmed the phone call, but refused to discuss 
its contents. However, in an attempt to soften Arafat's words, two 
senior aides said the Palestinians were committed to the peace agreement 
and that talk about statehood in May was intended to prod Israel into 
not dragging out negotiations on a permanent peace agreement. The 
latest agreement does not specifically refer to a possible declaration 
of statehood, but urges both sides to refrain from unilateral actions. 
However, the Israeli daily Haaretz said Monday that Arafat and President 
Clinton reached a verbal understanding during last month's Mideast 
summit that if little progress was made in final-status talks by May, 
the United States would not oppose a unilateral declaration of statehood. 
A group of 30 Jewish settlers, meanwhile, set up two mobile homes 
on a remote West Bank hill west of the Jewish settlement of Kedumim 
on Monday. Settler leader Daniela Weiss said the action came in direct 
response to Sharon. ``We understood that the attitude of the Israeli 
government is that he who holds the land determines policy and we 
are acting accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio. Israel radio said 
police later ordered the settlers to leave. Both sides have been trading 
inflammatory remarks in recent days that have raised questions about 
whether the land-for-security agreement will be carried out on time. 
Despite the latest row, it appeared unlikely the agreement would collapse. 
Implementation has been held up by Israel repeatedly, but with some 
U.S. prodding Netanyahu has moved ahead. U.S. officials said it was 
time for Israelis and Palestinians to cooperate. ``We have repeatedly 
called on both sides to refrain from provocative language,'' said 
Larry Schwartz, spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
