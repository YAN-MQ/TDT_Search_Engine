The Baseball Writers of America have voted the American League's Sy 
Young award to Roger Clemens. The Toronto Bluejays' right hander is 
the first pitcher ever to win the Sy Young Award five times. What 
won it for him this year, was a 20 and 6 record, with an earned run 
average of 2.65. Clemens was undefeated in his final 22 starts of 
the season.
