Six days after the Seita tobacco company announced the closure of 
two factories in the year 2000, thousands of employees marched in 
the streets Monday to protest the loss of hundreds of jobs. At least 
1,000 people demonstrated in Tonneins, the southwestern town where 
one of the factories is located, and 2,000 people in Morlaix in Brittany. 
Workers at Seita plants in the cities of Lille and Strasbourg also 
demonstrated, French radio reported, in solidarity with their co-workers 
in the two affected towns. ``Seita can and must live in Tonneins!'' 
read one banner. Seita is the major employer in Tonneins. Employees 
also set up a blockade on the highway, slowing down traffic so they 
could hand out flyers to drivers. Union leaders say 333 jobs in Tonneins, 
where the dark, pungent type of cigarettes are made, will be lost 
due to the closure. Seita manager Xavier Bibard said the reason for 
the planned closure in Tonneins was a 10 percent drop each year in 
demand for dark cigarettes, because of competition from American makers 
of blond tobacco cigarettes. Operations will be transferred to Lille, 
in the north. The company says that of those losing their jobs, 50 
percent will get early retirement, and efforts will be made to find 
the others jobs within the company. In Morlaix, where 172 workers 
will be affected, the factory to be closed specializes in cigars. 
The company has said that to compensate, 87 new jobs will be created 
in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
