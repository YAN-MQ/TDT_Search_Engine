Already engulfed in one of its worst crises, Brazil's auto industry 
is bracing for even tougher times ahead as the effects of a fiscal 
austerity package take hold in South America's largest economy. The 
auto industry, an economic bellwether that accounts for 12 percent 
of the country's industrial gross domestic product, has seen sales 
and production plummeting to their lowest levels in years. Figures 
compiled by the National Association of Vehicle Manufacturers show 
that January-to-October sales plunged 28 percent compared to the first 
10 months of 1997. Output during the same period dropped 23 percent. 
And for industry leaders, there is no recovery in sight for the near 
future. Herbert Demel, president of the local subsidiary of Volkswagen 
_ Brazil largest car maker _ predicted that next year's sales will 
total 1.5 million units, the same expected for 1998. ``In what I consider 
a best-case scenario, the market will most likely remain flat for 
at least the first six months of 1999,'' he said. ``And there is a 
very real possibility that sales figures could dip even lower.'' James 
Padilla, president of Ford Motor Company's South American operations 
said in a recent seminar that the industry's 1999 output would probably 
total 1.45 million units ``and in the short-term I don't see any chances 
of this number changing.'' Since 1992, auto industry sales posted 
steady and significant gains, going from 740,000 units to 1.64 million 
in 1997. Original figures that placed 1998 sales at 1.8 million started 
to be revised downward late last year when the shock waves of the 
first Asian financial crisis reached Brazil. In an effort to protect 
the economy from currency speculators, the government nearly doubled 
interest rates to 43 percent a year and decreed a hefty increase in 
an excise tax on industrial production, including cars. In a market 
where nearly 70 percent of auto sales are made on credit, the measures 
had an immediate impact as sales plunged some 30 percent. Sales picked 
up slightly in July and August when the excise tax was lowered five 
percentage points and annual interest rates dipped to about 22 percent. 
But then Russia's financial turmoil hit Brazil in September. The government 
responded by more than doubling interest rates to 49.75 percent to 
stanch an outflow of foreign capital. The country's foreign reserves 
fell to around dlrs 43 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the end of 
July. This was later followed by a mix of new taxes and spending cuts 
to save dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and dlrs 80 billion by 2002. Inventories 
of unsold cars, which had been holding steady at an already-high 100,000 
units, started swelling again and today stand at 200,000 vehicles 
parked in factory yards and in dealers. Until better times come, the 
auto industry is busy adjusting its production to demand, meaning 
output is being reduced and workers are being let go or given paid 
leave. The auto industry dismissed 1,300 workers between September 
and October and is expected to fire another 2,500 workers by the end 
of the year.
