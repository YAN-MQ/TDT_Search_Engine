Pope John Paul II met Monday with leading members of Austria's bishops 
conference, which has been rocked by a sex scandal and demands for 
reform by Austrian Catholics. The delegation of 11 bishops was led 
by Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the archbishop of Vienna who was 
named to head the bishops conference four months ago. The prelates 
came to Rome as part of periodic talks all bishops have with the Vatican. 
John Paul was expected to deliver a formal address to them later in 
the week. But tensions in the church were clear to John Paul during 
a June trip to Austria, when Schoenborn acknowledged the conflicts 
within the church ``have caused some people to lose confidence in 
the pope and the bishops.'' In particular, the traditional Catholic 
bastion was rocked by accusations that a cardinal, Hans Hermann Groer, 
sexually abused young boys. Reports in the Austrian press last week 
suggested the bishops were unhappy with the Vatican's handling of 
the case. Groer was forced by the Vatican to relinquish his church 
duties some time after the case became public. Among those meeting 
with the pope Monday were Bishop Kurt Krenn, a conservative who angered 
many by his staunch support for Groer.
