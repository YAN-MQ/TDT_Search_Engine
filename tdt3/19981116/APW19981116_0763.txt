The father of a teen-age murder suspect said Monday that he didn't 
know there was a warrant for his son's arrest when he helped the minor 
flee to Israel two days after the killing. ``We just thought police 
wanted to talk to him,'' said Sol Sheinbein, who is also wanted in 
Montgomery County, Maryland on charges of interfering in a police 
investigation. A patent lawyer from Silver Springs, Maryland, Sheinbein 
said he thought the trip to Israel would be short and therapeutic 
for his 18-year-old son Samuel. ``I wanted to calm him and after a 
few days, I sent my second son, his brother, to bring him back to 
America,'' the senior Sheinbein said in an interview with Israel's 
Channel 2 TV Monday. Sheinbein said he had consulted a family lawyer 
before his son boarded the plane. Samuel Sheinbein fled to Israel 
on Sept. 21, 1997, two days after the mutilated and burned body of 
Alfredo Tello Jr. was discovered in the garage of an empty home. Shortly 
after arriving, he was picked up by police and hospitalized briefly 
because of a drug overdose. To prevent extradition back to the U.S., 
the younger Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his father, 
who was born in pre-state Israel. Under Israeli law, citizens cannot 
normally be extradited for trial abroad but a Jerusalem court ruled 
that Sheinbein should be returned to the United States. At his son's 
extradition appeal to Israel's Supreme Court Sunday, Sol Sheinbein 
told reporters he wanted Samuel tried in Israel because he believed 
his life would be in danger if he served time in a U.S. prison. ``In 
the United States, his situation will be very difficult, and it is 
possible that he could be killed in prison there. I am very concerned 
for him,'' Sol Sheinbein said. Monday, Sheinbein said he didn't expect 
his son to go unpunished for crimes he may have committed but would 
do everything to keep him from being extradited. ``This last year 
has been hell for us. Every day I wake up and wish it was just a bad 
dream,'' Sheinbein said. He said that he and his wife Victoria, who 
have attended several court sessions, are in regular contact with 
their son, who remains in Israeli custody.
