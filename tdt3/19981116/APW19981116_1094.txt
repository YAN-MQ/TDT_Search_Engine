With an unexpected break in the weather, rescuers began the search 
on Monday for Michel Trudeau near the mountain lake where he is believed 
to have drowned. But there was no sign of the youngest son of former 
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who was swept away by an avalanche 
Friday in southeastern British Columbia and presumed drowned. ``There's 
nothing visible from the surface. We're just going to have to go to 
the last seen point and try it from there,'' said Dave Poirier, head 
of a diving team that planned to attempt to recover Trudeau's body 
later Monday. Snowy, foggy weather prevented rescuers from making 
any attempts on Sunday. Even when the divers get to the lake, they 
will be battling weather. The lake is quickly freezing over and once 
that happens, Poirier said the search will be on hold until the ice 
is hardened. That could take weeks. Thanks to the clearer weather, 
helicopter crews prepared to clear an avalanche hazard before divers 
headed in. The helicopters must drop explosives on the avalanche-prone 
masses of snow above the lake. But even when they can begin their 
search, Kokanee Lake's high altitude _ more than 1,900 meters (2,080 
yards) _ and icy waters will limit their efforts. ``From what I understand 
of the bottom of the lake topography there, we'll probably just be 
working along the shorelines,'' said Dave Poirier, one of the five 
dive-team members. Trudeau's body, weighed down by a water-logged 
pack, jacket and ski boots may be further out in the lake, which is 
1.2 kilometers (nearly 1 mile) long, 400 meters (440 yards) wide and 
whose depths reach 100 meters (about 100 yards). Police have not identified 
the others in the group but published reports say Trudeau, 23, and 
Andrew Bednarz, 23, were thrown into the lake by the avalanche but 
Bednarz managed to pull himself out. The others in the group, Jeff 
Butcher, 22, and Bradley Hamacher, 23, huddled with Bednarz to keep 
him warm. ``They yelled at Mike `to swim, swim, swim' but basically 
just watched him go under the water,'' said Paul Sinclair, another 
member of the ski party who had been with them a day earlier. ``There 
was just no way to rescue him in that cold water,'' he told National 
Post. Trudeau, a passionate skier and outdoorsman like his father, 
also knew the risks in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park. Kokanee Lake, 
fed directly from the glacier, is the most popular spot for back-country 
hikers and skiers, said Steve Kent, area manager for the B.C. Parks 
Service. But as the popularity of the park has grown so has the death 
toll. The park has had 10 avalanche fatalities in the last decade, 
including six people killed in one slide last January. Police say 
Trudeau's group was knowledgeable about avalanche hazards and survival 
techniques _ even carrying locator beepers in case they were buried. 
They tested the snow before leaving their cabin near the glacier. 
A spokesman for Pierre Trudeau issued a statement from Montreal saying 
Michel's parents were deeply saddened. He said they appreciated the 
many expressions of sympathy they have received and asked that the 
family be given privacy. The former prime minister has two other sons, 
Sacha and Justin.
