Key leaders of Pacific Rim nations Monday warned against letting the 
global economic gloom obscure free-market ideals and allow a tilt 
toward protectionism. Australian Prime Minister John Howard acknowledged 
there was a need to examine the huge amounts of funds sloshing in 
and out of regional economies, but said there could be no regulation. 
``The idea of supervisory structures is not desirable,'' Howard told 
a meeting of business chiefs being held on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation summit. There is growing concern among APEC leaders 
that the Asian contagion and a slowdown of Western industrialized 
economies could halt the organization's drive toward free markets. 
The failure over the weekend of ministers to reach a massive agreement 
to reduce tariffs in nine industries added to the pessimism. The goal 
was to eliminate or at least drastically cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion 
worth of global trade. The deal failed because of heavy opposition 
from Japan to lowering barriers in wood and fish products. ``The trade 
ministers' outcome is second-best from the APEC point of view,'' Howard 
said, noting that at least the 21-member trade group had agreed to 
send the pact onto the World Trade Organization for resolution. He 
said the watered-down trade plan should not weaken the resolve to 
keep markets open. In a move that could assuage many Asian nations 
who feel richer nations don't sympathize with their plight, Howard 
said Australia would take a proposal to the leaders' summit Tuesday 
and Wednesday that would set up two task forces to study the causes 
of the Asian economic crisis. The first would examine international 
hedge funds and the movement of large amounts of capital in and out 
of regional economies. This would be a boost to host Malaysia, as 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has blamed currency speculators and 
hedge funds for many of his country's economic problems. Malaysia 
says it is being forced to insulate its economy to protect itself 
from attacks by currency speculators and from being swamped by multinational 
companies. Howard said the task force would be chaired by the United 
States, but would also have to involve Britain because of London's 
role as a major world financial center. Howard also announced Australia 
would provide dlrs 30 million over the next three years to help train 
central bank officials and strengthen supervision of financial institutions 
in a dozen Asian countries. Supporting Howard on the need to stay 
away from closing markets, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said: 
``If countries resort to protectionism, then all economies in the 
region will contract as a chain reaction.'' Kim urged the richer nations 
to ``take positive actions and come up with concrete and tangible 
plans for helping resolve the current financial crisis in Asia.'' 
Peru's President Alberto Fujimori backed the movement to reform the 
global financial system, in the context of continuing trade liberalization. 
Fujimori, whose Latin American country was inducted into the APEC 
on Saturday, said reform was necessary to restore confidence in global 
markets, and to ``address structural problems in the financial sector.'' 
``We should build an international system that minimizes the risk 
of future crises,'' he said.
