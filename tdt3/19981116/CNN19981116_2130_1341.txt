Oakland's Eric Allen picked off a pass Sunday against Seattle to move 
him into a tie for second in the NFL, with five picks. But that's 
as far as he'll get. The six-time pro bowler was injured while running 
back the int, and is out for the season with a torn ligament in his 
left knee. Until now, Allen has only missed one game in his 11-year 
career.
