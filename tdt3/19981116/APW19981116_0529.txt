Jewish settlers set up two trailers on a remote West Bank hilltop 
Monday, a day after Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon urged settlers to 
grab land ahead of an Israeli troop pullback. Settler leader Daniela 
Weiss said the group was encouragd by Sharon's statements which the 
Palestinians denounced as a violation of the new land-for-security 
agreement. ``We understood that the attitude of the Israeli government 
is that he who holds the land determines policy and we are acting 
accordingly,'' Weiss told Israel radio. Israel radio said police later 
ordered the settlers to leave. As housing minister in the early 1990s, 
Sharon was responsible for a massive settlement construction drive 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Sharon said Monday that Israel would 
expand existing settlements and defended his remarks that settlers 
should seize land near their communities ahead of the impending troop 
pullback. ``If we are talking about seizing the hills, there are ... 
hills that dominate the existing settlements, state land, and this 
is aimed not at increasing tension but on decreasing tension in the 
future,'' Sharon told American Jewish leaders. In a related development, 
three ultra-nationalist rabbis issued a formal religious ruling that 
Israel's government is violating Jewish law by handing territory to 
the Palestinians. The three signatories were Dov Lior of the Jewish 
settlement of Kiryat Arba, Yitzhak Ginsburg of the Josep's Tomb seminary 
in the West Bank town of Nablus and Yaakov Yosef, the son of Rabbi 
Ovadia Yosef, the spirtual leader of the religious Shas Party. Many 
of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank are religious, and the three 
rabbis have an influence on at least some of the settlers. Under the 
peace agreement, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank 
by the end of January. The ruling by Lior, Ginsburg and Yosef ruled 
that the accord is invalid under Jewish law. ``Any agreement made 
by representatives of the Jewish people, which is against Jewish law 
- is invalid and there is no obligation to implement it,'' the ruling 
said. Several years ago, the same rabbis called on Israeli soldiers 
to disobey orders to evacuate Jewish settlements, but Lior said that 
this time he and his colleagues were not calling for disobedience. 
``We were asked for our opinion. We were not interfering in politics,'' 
Lior told The Associated Press. Lior said those opposed to the withdrawal 
``should try to persuade the government that it is wrong, but apart 
from that they should sit and do nothing.''
