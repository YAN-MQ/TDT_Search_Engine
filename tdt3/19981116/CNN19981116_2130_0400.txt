Millions of Americans are receiving a letter from the government about 
social security. Lawmakers planned the mailings in 1989. They inform 
people about benefits and personal social security records. 50 million 
letters have been sent so far, another 25 million will be sent before 
April. Part of a plan to phase in annual social security updates for 
every worker over 25 years old.
