The first Jewish book fair in Poland since World War II opened Monday, 
offering 300 titles on religion, the Holocaust, politics, psychology 
and the history of Jewish life in Poland. The four-day fair, sponsored 
by the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation, saw a steady stream of visitors 
on its opening night. ``It is one of the signs of normal Jewish community,'' 
said Jonah Bookstein, the foundation's program director in Warsaw. 
Eva Hoffman, one of a number of writers lecturing at the fair, spoke 
about her book ``Stetl,'' which tells the story of a small Polish 
town with a majority of Jews. Poland has about 20,000 Jews today, 
compared to 3.5 million in 1939 when the Nazis invaded. Most died 
in the gas chambers or from inhuman conditions at the death camps 
of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Majdanek and many others. Most of those who 
survived fled the anti-Semitic movements of communist Poland in 1956 
and 1968.
