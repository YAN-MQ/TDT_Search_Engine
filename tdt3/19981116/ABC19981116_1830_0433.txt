And whatever the results of the deal, industry is already devising 
ways to get smokers money without so much smoke. Here's ABC's Aaron 
brown. This may be the next generation cigarette, tobacco giant Philip 
morris hopes it is. The company has been test marketing the high-tech 
contraption in a handful of stores in Richmond, Virginia. It's weird. 
I've never seen anybody smoke anything out of a battery-operated machine. 
It's different. It is that but its purpose is the same, to deliver 
nicotine, the drug in cigarettes to the smoker, but it does so with 
very little secondhand smoke. It's obviously not near as much smoke 
as from a regular cigarette. Philip Morris claims the accord, significantly 
reduces the compounds public health officials say are most likely 
to cause smoking-related diseases. What the company doesn't claim 
and can't claim is that it is safe, or even safer than a conventional 
cigarette. There is no credible research, none, to support that. This 
is a safer way of getting nicotine. It is the next generation device 
to help people quit smoking. It feels a lot like using a cigarette 
and that's attractive to a lot of people. The nicotrol inhaler mimics 
a cigarette right down to the slight burning sensation in the back 
of the throat. For roughly twice the price of a cigarette and by prescription 
only, the smoker trying to stop only has to give up tobacco, not the 
routine, the hand to the mouth, the puffing, that is part of the habit. 
Side by side, the two products couldn't seem more different. The noncigarette 
looks more like a cigarette than the cigarette does. But in a most 
important respect they are the same. They are next generation nicotine 
delivery devices. I think these products Mark the beginning of a whole 
series of products that will come from both the pharmaceutical industry 
and the tobacco industry that show a lot of creativity in nicotine 
delivery. And those two industries are competing for the dollars of 
the 50 million Americans who crave a dose of nicotine each and every 
day. Aaron brown, ABC News, New York.
