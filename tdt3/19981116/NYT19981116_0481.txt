At a reception in a private club adjacent to the Seton Hall University 
School of Law, Gov. Christie Whitman accepted a medal of honor Monday 
night from three student groups that were forced last week to move 
the event off campus because of the governor's support of abortion 
rights. The Seton Hall Law Review, the Seton Hall Legislative Bureau 
and the Seton Hall Women's Law Forum had planned for months to present 
Whitman with the sixth annual Sandra Day O'Connor Medal of Honor in 
the law school's auditorium. Invitations had already been sent when 
officials of the university, a Roman Catholic institution, ordered 
it moved. In accepting the award at the Newark Club, Whitman, a Presbyterian, 
did not criticize the university, but she made several references 
to ``tolerance and inclusion.'' ``The fact that we are gathered here 
tonight is an indication that the students who selected me for this 
award have the courage of their convictions and a respect for diversity 
of thought,'' she told an audience of more than 150 students and professors. 
``For that, I am both honored and encouraged.'' In introducing her, 
state Sen. Robert J. Martin, who is a professor at the law school, 
criticized the decision to move the event, saying that the governor 
was owed an apology ``for the awkwardness and the embarrassment that 
we have caused you.'' Joking about the governor's emergency appendectomy 
on Friday, Martin thanked her for attending. ``When they took out 
your appendix, they did not take out your guts,'' he said. In a statement 
last week, Monsignor Robert Sheeran, president of the university, 
said, ``Seton Hall has a clearly stated policy that no public recognition 
is given to those espousing positions contrary to our Catholic mission. 
That includes those publicly supporting pro-choice views.'' Sheeran 
did not attend the reception.
