When we come back, what tomorrow's "New York Times" is reporting about 
the monica Lewinsky book deal. I sometimes go with my dad to the lumber 
store. Not every piece in the lumber store is even so you have to 
be careful. I think my dad learned about wood when he started working 
at international paper. If you make something out of curly wood, it'll 
be wobbly. And that's all I know about wood. International paper. 
Answering builders' needs, and yours.
