Menaces to society rarely declare themselves. The pilot of the DC-10 
to Miami: Is he secretly an alcoholic? The baby sitter who always 
shows up on time: Does she neglect her own children? The young man 
who scoops ice cream at the corner hangout: Has he been to a doctor 
about that rash? And what of Debbie Wastba, the sweet-looking instructor 
assigned to immerse the unsuspecting foreigners of ``The Primary English 
Class'' in the rudiments of a new language? She seems harmless enough 
at first, a bit flighty and even, perhaps, bumblingly offensive, referring 
to the Chinese student as an ``old Oriental'' and practicing her Spanish 
on a man who is obviously Italian. But as the evening unfolds in the 
dingy New York classroom of Israel Horovitz's black comedy, it becomes 
clearer that Debbie's escalating faux pas are the troubled acts of 
a confused and damaged woman and the five uncomprehending students 
the punching bags for her unfocused anger and misery. Their vulnerability 
_ and who is an easier target than a person who can't speak the language? 
_ is a mirror on her own helplessness, and one into which she looks 
with mounting self-loathing. The canyon-size gaps _ cultural, linguistic, 
psychological _ between the teacher and her pupils are what Horovitz 
plays up both for laughs and pathos in the revival of ``The Primary 
English Class,'' which opened on Monday night at the Minetta Lane 
Theater. In the original production 22 years ago, the teacher was 
portrayed by Diane Keaton, and it's not hard to see why she made a 
splash in the role. A bit of dithery Annie Hall-ishness could go a 
long way to soften the edges of this toxic character. For the revival, 
directed by Gerald Gutierrez, the role of Debbie has been assumed 
by Didi Conn, but neither she nor Gutierrez have provided any real 
justification for bringing back this unpleasant play, constructed 
around a gimmick. The five students _ so new to America that they 
arrive at the class with their luggage _ speak only in their own languages, 
which are comprehensible to no one else in the room. Thus the Frenchman 
(Charles Stransky) gabs away in French to the Italian (Mark Lotito), 
who converses only in Italian to the Japanese woman (Nami Hirayanagi), 
and so on, while the translation of what they are saying is broadcast 
over the theater's sound system. The device is even more cumbersome 
than it sounds. The miscommunication should at the very least inspire 
an ``I Love Lucy'' kind of looniness, but the non sequiturs are lame 
and lifeless. The exchanges are on the order of: ``Do you speak English?'' 
``I'll say I'm hungry!'' The style of the comedy shifts awkwardly 
from absurdist to naturalistic, but never seems to go far enough in 
any direction; a sense of extreme frustration with the missed opportunities 
is passed from the actors to the audience. On a technical level, too, 
the production is miscalculated. (What these well-dressed Asians and 
Europeans with their expensive luggage are doing in a broken-down 
schoolroom, rather than enrolling in Berlitz, is certainly never addressed.) 
Between lines, the actors must pause for the translations, a constraint 
that short-circuits any natural conversational rhythm they might try 
to establish. And during her revelatory second-act speech, delivered 
as she sits at her desk, Ms. Conn is invisible to at least a third 
of the audience, blocked by the backs of the actors seated downstage. 
The supporting actors are a lackluster bunch. In parts as monochromatic 
as those of the pupils tortured by Maria Callas in ``Master Class,'' 
they have been cast for their accents rather than their comedic skills. 
The girlish Ms. Conn, in a role that might seem well suited to the 
childlike persona she cultivated in movies like ``Grease'' and ``You 
Light Up My Life,'' is a cold and uninteresting presence here, someone 
you've given up on long before the playwright has. THE PRIMARY ENGLISH
