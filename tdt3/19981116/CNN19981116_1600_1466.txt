The University of Colorado buffaloes are mourning one of their most 
loyal football fans. Joseph prunk died last week at the age of 88, 
following a long illness. For 51 years, he never missed a Colorado 
game. He even sneaked out to catch one after his wedding. Prunk's 
family says he'll be buried with a ticket to last Saturday's game 
in his pocket in a casket featuring the team's black and gold colors.
