Federal mediators are trying to resolve a labor dispute between federal 
express and its pilots union. The two sides have not spoken since 
October 30th, when the union rejected a 17% raise over five years. 
FedEx is making contingency plans in case the pilots decide to strike 
during the busy holiday season. It says overnight service would be 
unavailable in some areas, and international deliveries would be extended 
one day.
