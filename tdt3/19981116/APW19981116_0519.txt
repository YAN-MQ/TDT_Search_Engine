Four months ago, Justin Rose made a serious run at the British Open. 
That was the easy part. Now comes the real work for the 18-year-old 
Englishman. Since turning professional following his stunning fourth-place 
finish at Royal Birkdale _ just two strokes behind winner Mark O'Meara 
_ Rose has been painfully reminded that he's still, after all, a teen-ager. 
He's played eight tournaments since then _ and missed every cut. Without 
enough earnings (in his case, not a cent) to guarantee a place on 
next year's PGA European Tour, Rose has to win his card at qualifying 
school beginning Wednesday in southern Spain. Of the 180 players entered, 
only 35 will get their card. Nobody will be under more pressure than 
Rose, who produced a stunning birdie on his final shot as an amateur, 
holing a 45-yard (meter) pitch on the 72nd hole of the British Open. 
The British tabloid press immediately likened him to Tiger Woods and 
proclaimed he had more potential than Seve Ballesteros' prodigy, 18-year-old 
Sergio (El Nino) Garcia, often considered Europe's best young player. 
``I was floating in cloud-cuckooland,'' Rose said. ``I don't regret 
anything, not even missing the cuts. I am disappointed but I feel 
stronger for it. ``Now I feel I am no longer in a tumble dryer going 
round and round and then being hung out to dry. Now I am ready for 
the school.'' Adding to the pressure is his first major endorsement 
signed earlier this month with ball manufacturers Maxfli. The performance-related 
deal could be worth as much as dlrs 1 million over three years. There 
is criticism that Rose, who turned 18 two weeks after the British 
Open, should have remained an amateur a bit longer. Woods, 4 1/2 years 
his senior, said at the time ``it would be very difficult for me to 
turn pro at that age.'' Rose's father, Ken, and manager Mike Todd 
downplay that notion but admit he was probably too laid back in the 
eight tournaments. ``The Justin Rose since the Open is not the Justin 
Rose with the killer instinct,'' said his father, suggesting he needed 
to be more ``hard-nosed.'' ``By his own admission he wasn't as prepared 
as he could have been,'' Todd said. ``He didn't drive the ball very 
well in those tournaments and it affected the rest of his game.'' 
Qualifying school is a grueling six rounds at San Roque and neighboring 
Real Club de Golf, both of which are next door to Valderrama, site 
of the 1997 Ryder Cup. One British newspaper dubbed the six days the 
``Pain in Spain.'' In just four months, Rose has grown more than an 
inch to 6-foot-2 (1.88 meters). He's beginning to shave regularly 
and still wears a broad smile as he learns the cruel, professional 
game. ``Where I went wrong was in failing to spot one very obvious 
difference,'' he said. ``When I was an amateur, I used to play golf 
all day and every day. That game was my hobby. When I turned professional, 
the game became my work.'' Rose, born in South Africa, moved with 
his family to England when he was five. At 14, he was a scratch player 
and last year was the youngest ever to play in the Walker Cup. His 
fourth in the British Open was the best finish by an amateur in 45 
years. ``That kind of portfolio drew us to him right away,'' Todd 
said. ``His youth, his way with people and the media makes him an 
attractive package.'' If Rose fails to win his card, he may wind up 
playing on Europe's secondary Challenge Tour, although Todd said he'd 
probably be invited to larger tournaments ``because of his age and 
his ability to put people through the gates with a big appeal to young 
kids.'' Rose will be up against some well-known names in Spain, including 
former Ryder Cup players Steven Richardson and Paul Way. The best-known 
name might be 47-year-old American Mac O'Grady, who earned over dlrs 
1 million in the United States before dropping off the tour at the 
start of this decade. ``It's a big week,'' Rose said. ``Everybody 
thinks you have to play safe golf. It is not safe golf. You make your 
swing and stay with it. You can't worry about the consequences.'' 
Spoken like a true 18-year-old.
