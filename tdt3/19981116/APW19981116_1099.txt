The pilot of a plane that crashed two months ago while approaching 
to land in the north African Spanish enclave of Melilla had alcohol 
in his blood, news reports said Monday. All 38 people aboard the British-built 
BAe 146, including pilot Diego Clavero, died when the plane smashed 
into a Moroccan hillside towards the end of a 45-minute morning flight 
from the Spanish mainland port city of Malaga to Melilla. A report 
presented to a Malaga judge investigating the crash indicated that 
Clavero's blood registered an alcohol level of 0.41 grams per liter, 
National Spanish Television TVE reported. Spanish aviation legislation 
prohibits pilots from drinking any alcohol before flying, TVE said. 
Rafael Clavero told TVE that his brother Diego never touched alcohol, 
whether flying or not, and claimed that the test was not reliable. 
No initial theories were advanced to explain the Sept. 25 crash because 
the plane, owned by the Spanish company Pauknair, was apparently in 
good condition, the weather was clear, and the pilot was experienced. 
All the crash victims were Spanish except for one young Moroccan passenger, 
Adhelazziz Bakkali, who relatives said was returning to Morocco after 
spending a year living illegally in Malaga.
