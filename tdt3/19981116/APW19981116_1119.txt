Soccer star Ronaldo appeared at the United Nations on Monday to back 
a campaign aimed at increasing awareness of the dangers of the AIDS 
virus among young people. ``It's all about staying in the game for 
longer,'' the Brazil and Inter Milan striker, who joined the U.N. 
campaign in May, told a news conference. ``Kids have the right to 
make the most of their lives.'' He said he had signed up ``because 
I know that soccer can help kids.'' ``If things go wrong on the field 
you can say to yourself that you will try hard to do better next time,'' 
Ronaldo said. ``With HIV, there is no second chance.'' ``Ronaldo is 
a key player on this team as on his own team,'' said Peter Piot, head 
of the U.N. agency dealing with AIDS and HIV, the virus that causes 
the disease. Some 7,000 people between the ages of 10 and 24 are infected 
with HIV worldwide every day, Piot said. Ronaldo earlier launched 
an institute aimed at offering children from Brazilian slums a way 
off the streets through training in soccer and other sports. The Instituto 
R9 will be part of a privately funded foundation being set up in a 
southern suburb of Rio de Janeiro, intended to receive some 3,000 
children and teen-agers. The sports and leisure complex should open 
by the end of next year. The striker was upbeat about a knee injury 
that kept him out of league action last weekend. ``Hopefully I'll 
be able to play again very soon,'' he said. Suffering from World Cup 
stress and troubled by tendinitis in both knees, Ronaldo has been 
often sidelined this season. But ``my health is fine,'' he said. ``I'm 
getting much better.''
