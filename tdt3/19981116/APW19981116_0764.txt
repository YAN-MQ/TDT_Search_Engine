The Czech team will be missing its top star, Lazio Roma midfielder 
Pavel Nedved, in Wednesday's friendly against England at Wembley. 
According to team spokesman Jaroslav Kolar, Neved tore his knee ligament 
in an Italian first division match and is forced to rest for at least 
a week. He will be replaced by Miroslav Baranek of Sparta Prague. 
Coach Josef Chovanec intends to field at least eight players who took 
the Czech team to the European championship finals two years ago, 
losing to Germany in overtime at Wembley. They include midfielders 
Karel Poborsky of Benfica Lisbon, Radek Bejbl of Atletico Madrid and 
striker Vladimir Smicer of Racing Lens. ``Some players don't get to 
play at Wembley ever, and for me this will be the second time in two 
years,'' said Patrik Berger, who scored the Czechs' only goal in the 
Euro '96 final and now plays for FC Liverpool. The Czech team currently 
leads the qualifying Group 9, challenging Scotland for a berth in 
the 2000 European championships. ``Wednesday's friendly will be good 
practice before the qualifier against Scotland in the spring,'' Chovanec 
said. Roster: Pavel Kouba, Vladimir Maier, Martin Kotulek, Lubos Kozel, 
Jiri Novotny, Tomas Repka, Radek Bejbl, Patrik Berger, Radek Latal, 
Jiri Nemec, Karel Poborsky, Radek Sloncik, Miroslav Baranek, Roman 
Vonasek, Pavel Kuka, Vratislav Lokvenc, Vladimir Smicer.
