John McEnroe earned his 12th seniors title Monday, beating Frenchman 
Guy Forget 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) in the ATP Senior Tour of Champions. McEnroe 
played in similar fashion to his glory days, attacking the net forcefully 
and firing several aces. ``I wanted to show these young guys who's 
the boss,'' said McEnroe, 39. Forget, 33, the youngest competitor 
on the senior tour, struggled. Often, his shots flew erratically off 
course. He led 1-0 in the opening set, then lost the next six games. 
In the second set, Forget played better, but McEnroe was too good. 
To the delight of the crowd, the match was not without a ``Mac Attack'' 
_ where McEnroe challenges a line call and argues with the umpire. 
He did that midway during the second set tie-breaker. In the consolation 
match, Henri Leconte of France got a walkover victory over Mats Wilander, 
when the Swede withdrew because of a fever.
