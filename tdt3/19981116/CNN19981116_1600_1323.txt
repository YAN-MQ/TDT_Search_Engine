Later tonight, the Kansas city chiefs will play host to the undefeated 
broncos. John Elway will be out with strained rib muscles. Denver 
is looking to become the first team to open a season 10-0 since the 
redskins did it in 1991. Our football team knows, you know, what team 
of football team we're facing. We've been there too many times, we
