Peter Roth, the head of programming for the Fox television network, 
announced his resignation Monday, becoming the second entertainment-division 
president to depart a network in the last three weeks. Fox, a subsidiary 
of News Corp., is expected to appoint Doug Herzog, the president of 
the cable channel Comedy Central, as its new head of programming on 
Tuesday. NBC appointed Scott Sassa president of its entertainment 
division on Oct. 26 after the resignation of Warren Littlefield. In 
a shift that may reflect the conclusion of the broadcast networks 
that they need to change their approach to programming, both Herzog 
and Sassa will now run the entertainment divisions of broadcast networks 
after building their careers guiding the entertainment operations 
of cable networks. Before joining NBC, Sassa ran the entertainment 
operations for the Turner cable channels. Fox's move was not entirely 
unexpected because the network started the television season in September 
with several weeks of disappointing ratings and was quickly forced 
to cancel four comedies. That initiated rumors that Roth would be 
replaced. But in recent weeks Fox rebounded and is now within reach 
of scoring the biggest victory in its history, a first-place finish 
among the 18-to-49-year-old audience most coveted by advertisers, 
during a sweep month, one of three special ratings periods during 
the television season. Moreover, under Roth, Fox added two hits in 
the last two seasons, ``Ally McBeal'' and ``King of the Hill,'' and 
was poised to add several promising animated shows this winter, including 
one, ``Family Guy,'' that is being talked about as having the potential 
to be the first breakout hit in what has been a hitless network season. 
Still, one aspect of the timing of Roth's departure is not unusual. 
Fox has changed its entertainment president every other fall for the 
last eight years. In a statement on Monday, Roth, who declined to 
comment further, said he would start a production company. ``I am 
pleased to have helped contribute to the success that Fox Entertainment 
has enjoyed during my tenures at both 20th Century Fox television 
and more recently the Fox Broadcasting Company,'' he said. Roth had 
previously run the television-studio arm of Fox. There he helped develop 
such successful series as ``The X-Files,'' ``Picket Fences,'' ``Chicago 
Hope'' and ``The Practice.'' The last three of those shows, along 
with ``Ally McBeal,'' were created by David Kelley, the prolific television 
writer with whom Roth had a close working relationship. Fox has offered 
Roth a production deal in conjunction with the network, much the same 
as Littlefield's deal at NBC. But Roth has not decided whether he 
will stay with Fox or go on his own, an executive with knowledge of 
the Fox offer said Monday. Roth will stay in television, however. 
He was widely known as one of the most passionate advocates of the 
business and had taken a leading role in urging network television 
to revolutionize its programming operations, both by putting programs 
into development all year round and by finding innovative ways to 
inject new programs into summer months, when wall-to-wall repeats 
have helped advance the exodus of viewers to cable channels. Herzog 
was responsible for some of the programs that have been pulling those 
viewers away. He did not return phone calls Monday, and Fox executives 
refused to confirm that he would replace Roth. But numerous executives 
close to both Herzog and Roth confirmed that Herzog had accepted Fox's 
offer and would join the network shortly. Herzog was named president 
of Comedy Central in July 1995, arriving after establishing a reputation 
as an innovative programmer for MTV. Comedy Central was a little-regarded 
all-comedy network at the time, relying mostly on repeat programs 
that once ran on one of the broadcast networks. But under Herzog, 
the network, which is owned by Viacom and Time Warner's HBO unit, 
has improved its ratings for 14 consecutive quarters. It scored one 
of the biggest breakthroughs in cable history last season when it 
introduced the animated series ``South Park'' and immediately began 
scoring some of the highest ratings for any nonsports programming 
on cable television. The series received both wide critical acclaim 
for its outrageous language and subject matter (one of the four main 
animated children characters is luridly killed in every episode) and 
criticism because of its especially potent appeal to teen-age and 
preteen viewers. Herzog argued that the show was telecast at a late 
hour and was intended for adults. Herzog was also instrumental in 
the creation of the channel's nightly satirical report on the day's 
news events, ``The Daily Show.'' While not as successful as ``South 
Park,'' the show built a loyal following. The show's star, Craig Kilborn, 
was hired away by CBS for that network's forthcoming new late-night 
program. Herzog responded by hiring a far better-known comedian, Jon 
Stewart, to replace Kilborn when he leaves ``The Daily Show'' early 
next year. While at MTV, Herzog was credited with building the channel's 
news operation and its expansion into regular programs like the game 
show ``Remote Control,'' the concert series ``Unplugged'' and the 
much-talked-about cinema-verite summer series ``Real World.''
