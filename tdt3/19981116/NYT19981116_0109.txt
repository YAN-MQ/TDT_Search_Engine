``You can now status your transfer request 24 hours a day,'' Fidelity 
Investments wrote Yvonne Freund of Bellevue, Wash. She immediately 
statused her vocabulary and wrote me, ``Is this English?'' Not Standard 
English. Rather, that new verbal status of status is in the jargon 
of finger-snapping brokerese. The purpose of making a verb out of 
the noun status, meaning ``standing'' or ``condition,'' is seemingly 
to save space: The old way, to learn the status of, takes up valuable 
room that might be utilized for hot stock tips. I say ``seemingly'' 
because the real purpose of most noun-verbing is to give the illusion 
of modernity. ``This door is alarmed'' zips along much faster than 
``An alarm system is affixed to this door that will make horrific 
noises and summon heavily armed police officers to haul you off to 
jail if you open it.'' And yet it conjures a mental picture of a door 
with an alarmed expression on its face, evoking a ``There, there, 
maybe you need therapy'' from passers-by. If the verb statused is 
too short-handed, and alarmed is ludicrous, what about impacted? Can 
you say, ``That will impact an election,'' instead of ``That will 
have an impact on it''? I think so. The reason is that it has withstood 
the test of a generation-long derision. Remember prioritize? That 
squeezing of ``give priority to'' was subjected to withering fire 
from prescriptivists and other self-appointed guardians of good usage, 
and we won. When a government official uses prioritize today, he identifies 
himself as a raging bureaucrat and is hooted at by aesthetes who find 
that an ``ugly'' word. (The -ize do not have it.) Impact, on the contrary, 
strikes me as losing its preceding have an and succeeding on. Although 
the past participle can be traced to 1601, purists will continue to 
object to any use of impact as a verb. My hat is off to them because 
they force the language change to go through a crucible, and in the 
case of status may stop its pompous-seeming verbification. But their 
objections do not always impact new usage. Let's try another. ``I 
am encouraging you to participate,'' wrote Donna Shalala, secretary 
of health and human services, pushing a departmental health outing, 
``by walking, running, spectating or volunteering.'' Saul Rosen of 
Bethesda, Md., said, ``Coinages are worthwhile only when they bring 
added value.'' (He means ``when they add value.'') ``This one, not!'' 
I figuratively raced over to Health and Human Services, formerly Health, 
Education and Welfare before they spun off Education and Welfare became 
a word to avoid. ``My trusty Merriam-Webster Web site tells me,'' 
Shalala said, ``that spectating is indeed a legitimate back-formation 
of spectator.'' On second thought, she wished she had not used the 
gerund form and instead had encouraged employees ``to walk, run, volunteer 
or spectate.'' I was ambivalent about spectate (and I'm of two minds 
about ambivalent) until I thought the new verb through in the light 
of status and impact. There's no doubt that the verbal form is in 
the language: The OED has it coined in 1709. But its use has been 
rare, and we should apply Rosen's Value-Added Criterion. Does it supply 
a meaning not covered by the simple ``watch'' or ``cheer''? Although 
I like commentate, which has a more media-opinionated connotation 
than the noun and verb comment, I'd hold off on spectate. Too soon 
to buy in formal writing. Bears watching. SCHLUMPING ALONG A recent 
polemic by a right-wing calumniator began with a story about a Jewish 
matchmaker. A character in the story, named Sammy, was identified 
as ``a nebbish and a schlumpeh.'' My New York Times copy editor, Linda 
Cohn, asked, ``Do you mean shlump?'' I insisted on the long form. 
This prompted a note from Sol Steinmetz, the yexicographer: ``You 
spelled nebbish correctly, but schlumpeh is problematic, because actually 
there's no such word.'' He acknowledged the German word Schlampe, 
which means ``a slovenly female or slut,'' but noted that I could 
not have applied it to Sammy because the word is feminine. ``In Yiddish, 
there's a related word, shlumper, meaning `a slovenly, ineffectual 
person,''' wrote the ever-helpful Steinmetz. ``The word I think you 
meant to use was the American English slang noun shlump, which derives 
from and means the same as the Yiddish shlumper.'' He cited Joseph 
Heller's usage in his 1979 novel, ``Good as Gold'': ``an odious shlump 
who made war gladly.'' As winking wonks say in Mel Krupin's Bethesda 
deli, I nonconcur. All my life I have had poor posture. This is not 
a source of pride; I can hear the voice of Ida Safir, my mother, saying, 
``Billy, stand up straight _ why must you be such a schlumpeh?'' She 
may have derived this from the Scandinavian slumpa, ``to fall,'' the 
root of the English slump, as in ``You call a thousand-point drop 
in the stock market a slump?'' The pronunciation of the final syllable 
was more of a schwa than an er. The meaning was ``one who stooped'' 
but not necessarily ``one who is stupid.'' It could be that the picture 
of a person with shoulders hunched forward would lead to the extension 
of meaning of ``slovenly, ineffectual,'' as Steinmetz now defines 
the Yiddish term. At any rate, the final syllable has been clipped 
in its adoption in American slang, and shlump has become synonymous 
with nebbish, ``a pitifully ineffectual loser.'' The word once served 
me well. In Army basic training, a lieutenant snapped at me, ``Why 
can't you stand straight at attention, soldier?'' I remembered my 
mother's usage, and promptly replied, ``Because I'm a schlumpeh, sir!'' 
He must have thought it meant membership in an esoteric band of fierce 
warriors, because he never bothered me after that.
