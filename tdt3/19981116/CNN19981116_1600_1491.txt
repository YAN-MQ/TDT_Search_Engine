It's getting more and more expensive for TV networks to snag the rights 
to major sporting events. So they're turning to new strategies in 
an effort to attract male viewers. Mark Scheerer explains. a tough 
Texas ranger named "Walker" follows "martial law" on CBS this season. 
Prime-time Saturday -- Hyeeah! -- is a night with the guys. They've 
got Sammo hung on Saturday nights now instead of Dr. Quinn, and that 
is, you know, a direct appeal for younger men. It's the demographic 
that everybody feels is, you know, going to spend money. So networks 
are willing to spend money, lots of it, to get them. CBS paid an unprecedented 
$4 billion to retrieve broadcast rights to NFL games this season. 
Since we got the NFL back, something like 13 or 14 shows on our schedule 
are up in male demographics significantly. So we put the blood back 
into our network in terms of male viewership. Sports have become increasingly 
expensive, because they do deliver the young viewers. That's got all 
the networks looking for new ways to go where the boys are. You know, 
it was a good year for us, 'cause we happen to be men. At least early 
this year, it was. Hoping to secure those key male viewers, ABC unlocked 
"the secret lives of men." It's a show about guy talk. I think that 
the show's masculinity is, perhaps, too strong for some audiences. 
And ABC, perhaps, agreed. This week, the network sent "the secret 
lives of men" to the showers for lackluster ratings. There, it joins 
CBS' "buddy faro" -- a rat packesque private eye. Still, plenty of 
other new shows this season are basking in masculinity. Plus, we'll 
take you live to the locker room at Arrowhead. "sports night" screams 
men, although it's also finding female fans. "Brother's keeper" and 
"guys like us," two others whose titles alone seem to call for guys' 
eyes. New comedies like "the hughleys," "DiResta," "the family guy" 
and "king of queens" center around family men whose goofs come mostly 
from being dopey guys. Lukewarm ratings may have some wary, but the 
eye continues to wink at guys with its first midseason replacement. 
"Becker" stars Ted danson as a single but salty doctor, who's not 
afraid to go macho. Over at CBS, CBS knew that they were going to 
-- you know, last year, they were your parents' network. Now they 
want to be the guys who live at home with their parents' network. 
And after spending so much cash to get them, they're hoping the big 
check is in the male. Mark Scheerer, "CNN Entertainment News," New 
York.
