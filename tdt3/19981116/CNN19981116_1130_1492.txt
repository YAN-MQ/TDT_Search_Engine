Jamaica is enjoying a musical revival. And as Brooke Alexander reports, 
it all goes back to one man. My life is just me and my insecurity. 
My life is the people. This was marley's home as a boy in Kingston. 
It gave him his musical inspiration and a lifetime of commitment to 
the poor. What Bob wrote was known from the jamaican people. We found 
out it was a universal message. Thanks in no small way to marley, 
Jamaica is a crucible of musical styles. Jamaica is made of many people. 
That's how the music scene is down there. There is a lot of Reggae. 
But there are so many different stations that play different styles 
of music. On Sunday, you used to have classic Sunday. I just wanted 
to relax and do my thing and smoke or whatever and I would listen 
to Bob Majerle. You would get some spirittial vibe. '90s Reggae has 
taken on a harder edge -- dance hall. The young people down the street, 
the old but we all get the old people involved now. They were into 
old beats like the "turn me loose." Number one on the U.S. Reggae 
chart, Trinidad's general grant is on the hip hop list. He sees a 
revival. The artists are going back to the Reggae. The message is 
more common back then, more than the girlie, girlie stuff. People 
have more roots and one love and togetherness and such things like 
that. Arguably, this flowering of styles started in trenchtown with 
one man.
