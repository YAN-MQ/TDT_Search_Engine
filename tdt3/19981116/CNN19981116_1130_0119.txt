With both sides claiming victory, it's difficult to determine who 
came out ahead in the Iraqi standoff. An architect of the Persian 
gulf war says the United States did, marginally. I think, in this 
case, it is not really a retreat. It seems to me that we have gained 
some with our friends, and our allies, especially our Arab allies, 
do now concede we just aren't mad at Saddam. We don't want to hit 
him just to hit him, we want him to comply. And so I think we have 
probably rebuilt a little bit our storehouse of confidence of friends 
and allies in us. Scowcroft also says there's no reason to believe 
a military strike would necessarily cause Saddam Hussein to change 
his ways.
