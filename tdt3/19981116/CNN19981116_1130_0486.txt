I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News" weather. 
Another cold day anticipated today. Back through the upper midwest 
some highs will not make it above freezing. Temperatures warm along 
the gulf coast and still warm in the southwest. Forecast weather maps 
from later today on into Tuesday show some wet weather along the southeastern 
atlantic coast and by tomorrow moving into the northeast. Storm system 
in the west will be pushing into the Rockies and could bring some 
heavy snows into parts of Idaho and Montana beginning later on tonight 
and on into tomorrow. Take a look now at the extended forecast -- 
rain and snow likely through the upper midwest during the day on Wednesday. 
Rain will continue in the pacific northwest as temperatures remain 
mild along the gulf coast states. On Thursday, we'll find a storm 
system back through the Great Lakes producing a mix of precipitation, 
snow through the upper midwest, then gradually changing to rain as 
you head further to the south. Showers and storms will be likely, 
too, in the southeast. And on Friday, it will be the northeast that 
will be wet with snow and ice back through parts of eastern Canada, 
gradually changing to rain as you head into the northeastern U.S. 
colder temperatures will be filtering through the upper midwest. For
