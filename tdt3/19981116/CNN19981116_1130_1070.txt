Good news for web surfers -- Compaq computer is unveiling a line of 
personal computers that allow faster connections to the Internet via 
telephone and satellite. The PCs come equipped with high-speed Internet 
access equipment, so that users will maintain constant Internet access 
rather than dialing up each time they want to go on-line. Users of 
the new service will be able to receive data as fast as 1.5 million 
bits a second. That's virtually instantaneous access. The technology 
requires phone lines that are free of interference, so compaq is calling 
on leading cable, phone and satellite companies to step up their Internet 
investments.
