At the Asian economic summit in Malaysia today, the U.S. and Japan 
said they would pump $10 billion in loans and fresh capital into Asian 
economies hit hardest by the financial crisis. The announcement was 
overshadowed by an angry reaction to a speech given by vice President 
Gore. He said Asia could benefit from more democracy, and criticized 
Malaysia for throwing a prominent reformer in jail. Malaysia's trade 
minister called it the most disgusting speech she's ever heard.
