Most people of a certain age know about the air fare discounts we 
fall heir to when we pass 62. But now, like almost everything else 
available to the increasing older population, the small type, while 
surely getting smaller, is also growing longer, and the asterisks 
are proliferating. More than that, airline programs are much less 
alike than they used to be. In 1996, when this column last examined 
senior benefits, all the airlines offered 10 percent discounts for 
any published fare _ which they still do _ plus senior books with 
coupons to be used in lieu of a ticket. Prices and conditions were 
much the same. Now there are four airline ``clubs'' with other sorts 
of offers, and the coupon books cost more and have new rules and wrinkles. 
If you use different airlines, you might as well settle for the 10 
percent discount, enhancing it by using promotional fares requiring 
purchase far in advance. If you are flexible about days of travel, 
travel agents can maximize this advantage. Here is what's available 
in senior airline discounts now. Either Join a Club ... Four airlines 
have programs _ ``clubs'' _ for seniors that involve paying to join: 
United, which has just revised its club fare system; Continental; 
Delta, and American, which is not open to membership now but is expected 
to reopen in the spring. United's program is called Silver Wings Plus 
and is open to people aged 55 and over who belong to the airline's 
frequent-flier plan. A lifetime Silver Wings membership costs $225; 
a two-year membership $75. The basic benefit is a set of four certificates 
that permit purchase of four reduced-fare round-trip tickets, all 
for the member or two for the member and two for a traveling companion 
of any age. Until last Sunday, these fares were based on a zone chart. 
The new system uses mileage and the day of the week to set the fare. 
The least fare, for a round trip totaling 500 miles, is $98 from Monday 
to Thursday, $118 Friday to Sunday, airport charges and departure 
taxes not included. A 6,000- to 7,000-mile round trip, for example, 
from Colorado Springs to Honolulu, has prices of $598 and $618. The 
recent lowest fares on this route, with the 10 percent senior discount, 
were $683 and $751. Tickets must be bought 14 days in advance and 
there are length-of-stay requirements and blackout dates. These memberships 
come with other discounts and coupons for travel, hotels and cruises. 
Members may buy four additional certificates for $25. United Silver 
Wings Plus: (800) 720-1765 or www.silverwingsplus.com. Continental's 
program, Freedom Flight Club, has the virtue of avoiding asterisks 
on its offers other than those that exist for the basic ticket. People 
62 and over who join get 15 percent or 20 percent off any fare the 
airline offers, first class included, with no blackout dates. A membership 
for domestic travel costs $75 a year; for travel outside the United 
States, $125. For travel in the United States, to Mexico, Central 
and South America, Canada and the Caribbean, the discount is 20 percent 
on Monday to Thursday and on Saturday; 15 percent on Friday and Sunday. 
For tickets to Europe, the 15 percent applies on Friday, Saturday 
and Sunday; 20 percent Monday to Thursday. This plan does not accommodate 
a companion. Continental Freedom Flight Club: (800) 441-1135 or www.flycontinental.com. 
Delta uses the zone system for its Skywise Program. This also covers 
both first-class and coach tickets. The cheapest coach ticket, $118 
round trip _ none of these fares include airport charges and segment 
fees _ would provide a trip from one place to another in the Southeast: 
North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi 
and Florida. From the Northeast to California, the round-trip fare 
would be $298; to Hawaii or Alaska, $658. Annual membership is $40, 
but Delta, like American, closes membership at an undisclosed level. 
It is open now. Each member 62 or over may enroll up to three companions 
of any age for $25 each. Saturday night stays are required, with a 
maximum stay of 30 days and no blackout dates. Skywise does not apply 
on Delta Express or the Delta Shuttle. Delta Skywise: (800) 325-3750 
or www.delta-air.com/skywise. American Airlines calls its 62-and-over 
program the AActive American Traveler Club. This year, it accepted 
members from June 1 to the end of October. Its fares, both domestic 
and international, are based on the zone system, starting at $98 for 
short hops Monday to Thursday, and $20 more each way for Friday, Saturday 
or Sunday travel. Membership was $40 for the person over 62, or $70 
for the senior and a companion of any age. Membership will open again 
sometime in the spring; names are taken for a waiting list. American 
Airlines AActive American Traveler Club: (800) 421-5600 or www.amrcorp.com. 
... Or Buy a Coupon Book The seven major airlines all sell senior 
coupons in books of four to those over 62, each valid for a year for 
a one-way trip in the lower 48 states, and sometimes farther afield. 
For confirmed seats, reservations must be made 14 days in advance. 
Coupon books are worth having in two circumstances, even if the prices 
do not beat every promotional fare. One case is when a senior makes 
an annual trip to someplace warm, for example, and does not plan to 
return for a few months. Some deep-discount tickets have a 30-day 
limit for the return trip. But coupons can be used one at a time. 
The second circumstance is an emergency, when the traveler can take 
a coupon to the airport and stand by for a seat. Jens Jurgen of the 
Travel Companion Exchange in Amityville, N.Y., says this enabled him 
to see a sick daughter when a last-minute ticket would have been prohibitive. 
Northwest Airlines' Northbest book of four coupons costs $540. They 
are valid in all 50 states and to and from Canada, with two or three 
coupons required for greater distances. (800) 692-6961 or www.nwa.com. 
Trans World Airlines' Senior Travel Pak costs $548 for four, $1,032 
for eight, and covers the lower 48 states; Hawaii; San Juan, P.R.; 
Montego Bay, Jamaica; Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, and Toronto. 
A pack for a companion of any age costs $648 for four, $1,132 for 
eight. (800) 221-2000 or www.twa.com. American Airlines' coupons cost 
$596 for four; the lower 48 states and Hawaii are covered. (800) 237-7981. 
US Airways' book of four coupons costs $579. The holder of these coupons 
may also use them to take along up to two grandchildren aged 2 through 
11. (800) 428-4322. Continental sells its four-coupon book for $579, 
books of eight for $1,079. These cover the lower 48 states, Canada, 
Mexico and Caribbean. Alaska and Hawaii require two coupons each way. 
(800) 441-1135. United's books of four coupons are $596, as are Delta's. 
For information, call United at (800) 633-6563, Delta at (800) 325-3750. 
A number of smaller airlines also sell coupons. Listings of these 
(but not prices) may be found in ``Unbelievably Good Deals and Great 
Adventures That You Absolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over 50'' by 
Joan Rattner Heilman, a paperback published by Contemporary Books, 
in its 10th edition. The book may be ordered for $15.50, postage paid, 
from Morton Booksellers, 812 Stuart Avenue, Mamaroneck, N.Y. 10543.
