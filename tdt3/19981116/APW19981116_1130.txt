BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors are to return to Baghdad 
on Tuesday in the first test of Iraq's pledge to cooperate fully in 
eliminating its weapons of mass destruction. On Monday, the first 
U.N. relief workers who were pulled out in fear of a U.S. military 
strike returned to Iraq. And diplomats disclosed the behind-the-scenes 
drama in Baghdad that led to Iraq's sudden announcement Saturday it 
would reverse course and end its blockade of arms inspectors. Prakash 
Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to Baghdad, said in 
an interview that Iraq was being watched closely to measure its resolve 
in cooperating with the U.N. inspectors searching for forbidden weapons. 
``Many members of the Security Council want the question of Iraq's 
cooperation with the inspectors to be tested and proved on the ground,'' 
Shah said. He added: ``If Iraq cooperates fully and unreservedly with 
the inspections due to begin in the next few days, the comprehensive 
review to be conducted by the council offers a hopeful sign for the 
future.'' Shah was to leave Tuesday for New York to brief Annan and 
council members on the situation. Of the about 150 U.N. relief workers 
pulled out last week, the first 30 returned on a special U.N. flight 
from Jordan, where they were evacuated, to Habaniya military air base 
west of Baghdad. About 120 more U.N. humanitarian workers were due 
overnight on a bus convoy through the Jordanian desert. The threat 
of military action was averted Sunday when U.S. President Bill Clinton 
announced that the United States had accepted the Iraqi government's 
pledge a day earlier to lift its three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections. 
Once inspectors report that they have been able to resume work, the 
council has said it will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to eliminate 
its weapons of mass destruction. The Iraqi government wants the review 
to lead quickly to the lifting of sanctions _ a move both the United 
States and Britain have resisted. The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait, limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings 
and have devastated Iraq's economy. The council has said they will 
not be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission and the Vienna-headquartered 
International Atomic Energy Agency certify that Iraq has eliminated 
its lethal weaponry. UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross told The Associated 
Press in Bahrain, where the weapons experts were evacuated last week, 
that they expected ``full cooperation'' on their return. ``They will 
be the first to know if the cooperation is full and unfettered or 
not,'' Ms. Cross said. There was great concern _ especially in neighboring 
countries _ that a missile strike would prompt Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein to ban UNSCOM forever, ending any hope of long-term monitoring 
to prevent Iraq from rebuilding prohibited weapons. Late Friday night, 
the ambassadors of France, Russia and China _ Iraq's defenders in 
the Security Council _ met with Foreign Ministry officials to warn 
that the United States was serious about a strike and urge Iraq to 
let the U.N. inspectors back. The Russian ambassador carried a letter 
from President Boris Yeltsin. Just hours later, at about 2 a.m. Saturday 
(2300 gmt Friday), Iraq's ambassador in New York, Nizar Hamdoon, faxed 
a similar appeal from Annan to the Iraqi leadership in Baghdad. Iraq 
broke its silence 12-1/2 hours later, when Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
Aziz telephoned Shah to say that there would be a ``positive reply'' 
to Annan's letter. But apparently the attack seemed close enough that 
Iraq wanted to get word out publicly. So an Information Ministry official 
issued a one-sentence statement at 3:30 p.m. (1330 gmt) Saturday to 
the scores of Western reporters drawn to Baghdad by the crisis. ``I 
have information that the leadership will respond positively to Annan's 
letter,'' the official said. By about 4:30 p.m., Iraq's formal response 
was read to Shah's office for transmission by fax to Annan. A typed 
copy signed by Aziz was delivered later. The two-paged letter promised 
that Iraq would renew cooperation with U.N. inspectors. Washington, 
however, viewed an attached annex as containing unacceptable conditions 
and rejected the pledge as unacceptable. Later that night, it took 
repeated phone calls to Baghdad to produce U.N. ambassador Hamdoon's 
three separate ``clarifications'' that Iraq's decision was unconditional 
_ which finally satisfied the Americans.
