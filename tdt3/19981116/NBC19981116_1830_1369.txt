Now we begin a two-part series, "bitter pill," on the high cost of 
prescription drugs in this country. In the pages of the "Wall Street 
Journal" and on nightly news, we're taking a comprehensive look at 
America's new drug problem. The huge appetite for prescription medicines 
and the multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry that's driving 
it. Tonight, NBC's Robert Hager looks at why drugs cost so much. Prescription 
drug spending and prices out of control. Growing four times faster 
than other health costs. More money for more prescriptions than ever 
before. And consumers add up the bills. Charles Lynn, retiree. How 
much does he pay? In 1996, the prescription was over $2,400. In 1997 
it was over $2,500. And so far, a rough estimate but pretty accurate, 
it's over $2,000 so far this year. Big bills for companies and insurers, 
as well. Chrysler spends 19% of its employee health care costs on 
drugs. Blue cross/blue shield of Michigan 28% for drugs, more than 
for doctors. Myron holubiak tracks the drug companies. What we've 
had is an industry that's incredibly successful the past few years. 
Retail sales up 80%IN the last five years. 16% this year alone, reaching 
more than $100 billion. What's driving the big spending? In part, 
it's prices. Some popular drugs hiked 10% or more this year, without 
many complaints, because three out of four Americans are covered by 
insurance. And it's also because there are a lot of promising new 
drugs suddenly available now. And consumers want them. Aggressively 
courted by newly approved TV advertising, whether for bald heads -- 
Introducing propecia. Or for runny noses -- Claritin works for me. 
The larger brands are spending $100 million in direct-to-consumer 
advertising and they wouldn't do it if they didn't think it were effective. 
As for price hikes, the companies say the costs of new wonder drugs, 
come high. To be able to get one new medicine to market, on average, 
the cost to the companies is $500 million just for that one new medicine. 
And on average, it takes about 12 to 15 years. But profits are up, 
too. Forecast to grow 16% to 18% a year into the millennium -- three 
times faster than for most other big businesses. And as the population 
ages and requires even more drugs, we pay. When you take that much 
money away and you have to set it aside, that's a Big lump. For consumers 
and for insurers. A growing drug cost problem with no immediate prescription 
for relief. Robert Hager, NBC news, Washington.
