Good news for nut lovers _ and anyone who wants a simple way to help 
lower the risk of heart attack. Researchers from the Nurses Health 
study of 86,000 nurses found that women who ate more than five ounces 
of nuts a week, slightly less than the rough equivalent of one airline 
packet a day, had one-third fewer heart attacks than those who rarely 
or never ate nuts. And preliminary results from the companion Physician's 
Health Study suggest that frequent nut consumption may provide similar 
benefits to men. The Nurse's study, conducted by researchers at Brigham 
and Women's Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, 
also brings good news about the nut. This plant product, which does 
not, contrary to wide misconception, contain any cholesterol, has 
been maligned for years and accused of being a menace because of its 
high fat content. With conclusions to the contrary, the study is a 
reminder that not all fat is bad fat, that the body, in fact, needs 
some fat. Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard School of Public Health, who 
led the research and reported on its results in the current issue 
of the British Medical Journal, said that during the period of observation, 
from 1980 to 1994, the women in the study suffered a total of 1,255 
fatal or nonfatal heart attacks. Of the 86,000 women, 4,000 had a 
weekly diet that exceeded five ounces a day of all kinds of nuts, 
from the elitist macadamia to the commonest peanut: 44 of them heart 
attacks. This compared with a group of 30,000 who rarely or never 
ate nuts and suffered 554 attacks, and 52,000 who were between the 
two extremes, eating nuts on average from one to four times per week, 
and suffered 669 attacks. ``Nuts are a fatty food,'' Hu said. ``They 
are high in fat, and because of this people have thought for decades 
that they should avoid them to help reduce the risk of heart disease. 
But we know that some kinds of fats, unsaturated fats, are good, are 
necessary, in fact.'' The researchers warned against overdosing on 
nuts, however. ``There is a risk of too much of anything,'' Hu said. 
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein, a biochemist at Tufts University's nutrition 
research center, said the new study was valid and important but added 
that ``people who tend to eat nuts may be those whose life styles 
are healthier in general.'' ``So one must not overreact to the data 
on nuts without assessing one's whole diet,'' Dr. Lichtenstein said. 
``There are many factors that make up healthy eating habits and patterns 
of life style and the others can't be ignored.''
