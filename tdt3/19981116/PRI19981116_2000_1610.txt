the United States and Japan have announced a $10 billion package to 
help Asia out of its economic slump. But as Liz George reports from 
our Business Desk in New York, there is growing concern that a revived 
Asian economy might have an adverse effect on the U.S. The U.S. is 
being accused of sending mixed signals to those countries struggling 
to combat the global financial crisis. Some economists are saying 
that initiatives to promote growth in Asia are being diluted by efforts 
to prevent the American market being flooded by cheap imports. Something 
which could lead to the loss of U.S. jobs. David Malpas is the Chief 
International Economist for Bass Stearns. In a way, the U.S. is trying 
to give money to the countries. And say export more, but don't export 
to us. And it's really an unclear message that's coming out of the 
Administration. This has, I think to do with the lack of clarity in 
the way countries actually are supposed to develop. I think that they 
should be developing more through sound money and low inflation. But 
instead, the U.S. and the IMF are still pushing this same old line: 
that they should export their way out of their problems. Manufacturing 
figures released in the U.S. today already show production is falling 
off. Businesses ran at their slowest operating rate in more than six 
years. So if Asia continues to export cheap goods, will the U.S. step 
up protectionist measures? David Malpas again. The U.S. always has 
quite a taint of protectionism. We go around the globe and say we're 
the free trader. But then in reality, we have this host of lawyers 
protecting company after company. Very powerful laws in the U.S. to 
stop people from exporting to us. The $10 billion initiative for Asia, 
announced today, aims to help ailing banks and companies restructure. 
The plan provides a combined $5 billion contribution from Japan, the 
Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank. The U.S. is contributing 
the other $5 billion.
