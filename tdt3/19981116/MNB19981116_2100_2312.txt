Word came today that Monica Lewinsky has signed a book deal with a 
major publishing house. She is also -- has also apparently agreed 
to do a television network interview. Doreen carvajal and Lori Mifflin 
are covering this. Doreen carvajal is with us tonight from New York. 
Doreen, tell us what you know about the deal. Why is it called a crash 
book? Well, essentially what's happening is that Monica Lewinsky is 
finally ready to talk outside of a grand jury room. But she's doing 
it far lot less than the millions, up to $10 million that anybody 
had ever expected. She's going to do an interview for ABC with Barbara 
Walters for no compensation, and she's going to do a book deal with 
St. Mar ten's press for an advance that is about $600,000 plus bonuses 
that could push it towards $1 million if she achieves best seller 
rankses. But that's far less than the various proposals that had been 
floating around for months. You asked about a crash book. It's called 
a crash book because they are literally trying to get it out as fast 
as they physically can. The book is expected to come out in February. 
Nothing written so far. The author, Andrew moron the, who wrote about 
princess Diana, actually just met Monica Lewinsky last week. Supposedly 
they clicked very loudly, according to the British publisher. And 
the two of them immediately started talking about what they could 
do. So, it's a work-in-progress, but obviously they're trying to get 
it out as fast as they can. Those audible clicks are very rare. yes. 
We love those clicks. What happened to her value, the value of this 
project? Is that one of the last great intangibles in publishing? 
Would chef gotten more if she'd done it two months ago? I think it 
would have helped if she'd gotten the deal around the O.J. simpson 
murder case. Publishing is going through dramatic changes. Sales have 
been flat over the past two years. The growth projections aren't very 
high. So, advances are inching downward. And she isn't helped by the 
fact that another notable misstress, the misstress of O.J. Simpson, 
got a $3 million book deal. And that book only sold about 150,000 
copies and lost a lot of money. So, major publishers are weary of 
deals like this, particularly because the shelf life is not very long. 
And it's important to remember a lot of this book has already been 
in the ken Starr report, only in kind of transcript form. Doreen carvajal 
is one of the co-authors of tomorrow morning's story, along with Lori 
Mifflin with the New York tilse. Thanks for coming on the air. Thank 
you.
