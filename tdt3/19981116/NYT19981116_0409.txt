When Michael Kinsley _ editor of the online magazine Slate, which 
is owned by Microsoft Corp. _ first heard that Microsoft was going 
to trial in an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department, 
he knew he would not emerge unscathed. How does a magazine owned by 
a giant corporation cover its parent's antitrust trial? ``My initial 
thought was, `Can we get away with skipping it?''' Kinsley said. But 
he felt he would disappoint readers if he did not cover some aspects 
of the trial. Kinsley hired the rapier-witted journalist and author 
Michael Lewis to post his impressions from Washington. On Oct. 19, 
Lewis fired off his first tart dispatch. He wrote that Microsoft's 
chairman, Bill Gates, looked in his videotaped testimony ``as if he 
had swallowed a bad oyster.'' He continued, ``I doubt any sane and 
reasonable man could come away from today thinking anything but that 
Microsoft is guilty of many awful things, and if those things aren't 
strictly illegal, they should be.'' Lewis' correspondence seemed mightily 
unfettered by Microsoft. He referred to a Microsoft lawyer, John Warden, 
as ``a great Hogarthian ball of pink flesh with jowls that ripple 
over his white, starched shirt.'' Lewis dismissed the ``ineptitude'' 
of the Microsoft lawyers. In his last missive on Nov. 5, he described 
another Microsoft lawyer as having ``the warmth of a corpse.'' He 
added, ``If the courtroom population were asked to vote who in the 
chamber was most likely to be a vampire, he'd win.'' Kinsley joked 
about the close relationship between Slate and Microsoft in his regular 
letter from the editor. On Oct. 23, he posted a disclaimer of sorts 
in his weekly ``Read Me'' column: ``Lewis' views do not reflect those 
of Slate magazine, its editors, or its advertisers. Especially its 
editors.'' His disclaimer set the press critics in motion. The New 
York Observer pointed out how difficult it was for Slate to cover 
the trial and keep the ``whole enterprise honest when that doesn't 
interfere with the mother corporation's interests.'' Then, after the 
``vampire'' salvo, Lewis resigned. The Internet magazine Salon published 
an article last week suggesting that higher powers at Microsoft had 
asked for Lewis' resignation. Readers of Slate began to e-mail in 
complaints. Lewis, who is a contributor to The New York Times Magazine, 
said Monday that he and Kinsley had long ago agreed that he would 
write the column only for a limited time, and that he intended to 
return to work on a book about Silicon Valley to be published next 
year. Lewis pointed out that ``there were so many conflicts of interests 
here it was impossible to keep track of them, to be honest.'' Kinsley 
said he had tried to solve the problem by asking Lewis to write the 
impressionistic essays for which Lewis is well known, rather than 
straight reporting. Lewis was replaced on Nov. 10 by Herbert Stein, 
former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Presidents 
Nixon and Ford. Stein _ who opened his first column with a lengthy, 
drowsy football metaphor _ wrote only two columns, turning it over 
last Friday to Jodie Allen, Slate's Washington editor. Ms. Allen began 
her column by announcing her fidelity to Microsoft: ``I will not pretend 
to be an objective observer of the Microsoft trial. You wouldn't believe 
me if I did.''
