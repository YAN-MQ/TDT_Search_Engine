Unemployment rose to a record 5.3 percent for the three months ended 
Oct. 31, the government reported Monday. The figure was the highest 
since the government began keeping unemployment statistics in 1981. 
Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department said 188,000 people were 
out of work in the August-October period, compared with 179,400 in 
July-September, when unemployment was at a 15-year high of 5 percent. 
Officials said the latest figures reflected higher unemployment mainly 
in Hong Kong's construction sector and, to a lesser extent, in the 
restaurant and manufacturing sectors. Construction workers have been 
laid off as many private property projects have slowed down. The territory's 
property values have fallen drastically, by as much as 50 percent 
since their peak last year. Higher unemployment in manufacturing and 
restaurants was attributed to the decline in the territory's exports 
and subdued consumer spending, acting government economist Elley Mao 
said. Hong Kong's economy, mired in recession for months, shrank by 
5.3 percent in the second quarter. In Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong chief 
executive Tung Chee-hwa expressed concern over the latest figures. 
Tung, who is attending a meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum, said, ``We're still walking on a very difficult path.'' ``Unemployment 
is worsening. We're all very concerned and the concern is understandable,'' 
he added. Government infrastructure projects are expected to create 
at least 60,000 jobs by the end of 1999, Secretary for Education and 
Manpower Joseph W. P. Wong said. Although Hong Kong's unemployment 
is low compared with some countries, people in the territory had been 
used to years of healthy economic growth. In the past several months, 
many companies have announced pay cuts of 10 percent, while others 
said they will freeze wages to keep costs low. Rising unemployment 
and wage cuts have prompted unions and politicians to lobby for unemployment 
benefits and stricter guidelines on laying off staff. In a sign that 
some companies are trying to find other ways to cut costs, Hong Kong 
Telecommunications Ltd., one of the largest employers in Hong Kong, 
on Monday pledged no salary or job cuts for the next 13 months. In 
September, about 1,500 people protested the company's announcement 
that it would cut all wages by 10 percent. Hong Kong Telecommunications 
later retracted the decision.
