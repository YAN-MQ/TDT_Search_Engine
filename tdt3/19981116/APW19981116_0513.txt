Companies in Britain will stop using animals to test cosmetic products, 
the first European Union to impose a ban, the government said Monday. 
The agreement was welcomed by animals rights activists, and Paul McCartney 
said it would have made his late wife, Linda, who was a leading campaigner, 
very happy. However, the ban will have scant effect on the number 
of animals involved in experiments because almost all are used in 
testing and developing drugs, or research into animal biology. Last 
year, experiments were carried out involving 2.6 million animals, 
of which only 1,266 were used for testing cosmetics, the Home Office 
said. Last November, British cosmetic companies agreed voluntarily 
with the government to stop testing finished cosmetic products on 
animals. The new agreement extends the ban to testing ingredients 
used in cosmetics and the companies will voluntarily give up their 
testing licenses, the Home Office said. ``This is great news for our 
civilization and for the animals,'' said former Beatle McCartney, 
whose wife died of breast cancer in April. ``On behalf of my family 
_ and I know Linda would want to be included _ we are very happy to 
see this happening and we hope that other countries will not follow 
this lead,'' he added. Mrs. McCartney opposed all animal testing, 
although her husband has acknowledged that drugs tested on animals 
were probably used during her cancer treatment. Animal rights campaigners 
have protested for years, sometimes violently, over the cruelty to 
animals caused by the testing of lipsticks and other beauty aids. 
``We deal with irrelevancies _ skin and hair care is not a matter 
of life and death and that is what we are opposed to,'' said Anita 
Roddick who founded a chain store, Body Shop, which sold only products 
not tested on animals. Lawmaker Roger Gale, chairman of an all-party 
parliamentary committee on animal welfare, said Britain should press 
for a Europe-wide ban.
