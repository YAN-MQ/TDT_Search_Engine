You can be an artist in New York or a voodoo drummer from Haiti and 
when you try to explain why you do what you do, only the words will 
be different. ``The spirit give me the drum'' _ or the ability to 
paint or to hear ``Slaughter on 10th Avenue'' in the streets of the 
city when all anybody else hears is traffic. ``The spirit see in his 
mind I'm gonna be good.'' Can't be bothered with a wife or a job because 
the drum _ the painting _ the music has to come first. This is the 
case with Frisner Augustin, the 50-year-old drummer who will be honored 
by City Lore, the nonprofit organization that will celebrate New York's 
``living cultural heritage'' this week. He cannot read, he cannot 
write, there are five children by three women, none of whom live with 
him. He can perform voodoo ceremonies, but he rarely does, because 
he does not want to be distracted. From the time he was a little boy, 
in Haiti, in a house with a dirt floor and without plumbing, he was 
captive to the drums. ``The time my mother send me with the bucket 
to get water, I play it as soon as I left the house,'' Augustin says, 
at the Lower East Side offices of City Lore, his English heavily accented 
with Creole. ``One time, we have a plastic bucket _ the tone is very 
good to me. My mother beat me because we have only the one bucket.'' 
There are cultural heroes who are celebrated in Lincoln Center. There 
are cultural heroes who will be celebrated this Thursday evening when 
City Lore inducts ``five urban folk heroes'' into its People's Hall 
of Fame, at the New York Academy of Music. People like Sally and Tony 
Amato, who run the little Amato Opera house, in Greenwich Village, 
and Tariq Hamid, who runs Shaheen Sweets, an Indian and Pakistani 
confectionery shop in Queens. It seems safe to say that the Lincoln 
Center types live better. Augustin, who also heads La Troupe Makandal 
dance company, performed in Washington when the Rolling Stones did 
their Voodoo Lounge Tour in 1994, but he says he did not make big 
money. More recently, Augustin worked with the director Jonathan Demme 
on the soundtrack of the movie ``Beloved.'' Although Augustin did 
not reveal his salary, he seemed happier with this arrangement. Demme, 
certainly, was pleased. ``One of the reasons I wanted Frisner was 
a sheer ego trip,'' Demme says. ``He is a master drummer. When Frisner 
is featured, a lot of people just come to groove for the music. They 
are not coming for the spiritual dimension, they just love what he 
does with drums.'' The spiritual, however, is central to Augustin's 
music. He grew up in Port-au-Prince, in a neighborhood called, in 
Creole, deye simitye, or ``behind the cemetery.'' His father, who 
left his mother when she was three months pregnant, was a carpenter, 
his mother a sometime factory worker. To be one of the poorest kids 
in the neighborhood in Haiti, as was Augustin, was to be very poor. 
On New Year's Day, when the children dressed up in their new clothes 
and called on their neighbors, the young Frisner hid in bed with the 
covers over his head, because he had no new clothes But it was also 
clear to Augustin, whose uncle was a drummer, that he had a gift. 
``The spirits give me the drum,'' Augustin says. ``The spirit sees 
in his mind I'm gonna be good. My mother don't have money to pay the 
rent. Thanks God, thanks my spirit, that give me that experience to 
play the drum. I'm 14 or 15, I play the drum on stage, they give me 
$20. At that time, $20 is a billion dollars.'' Augustin did not have 
the money to go to school. He also did not see the point. There were 
people in his neighborhood who had high school degrees but still could 
not find work. Augustin, touring in Puerto Rico and Acapulco, Mexico, 
did not feel hampered by illiteracy. ``Maybe somebody says, `This 
guy doesn't know how to read, I will give him what I want,' but I 
know how to count money,'' Augustin says. Augustin came to New York 
in 1972, supporting himself as a gypsy-cab driver. (How he managed 
to get a driver's license without being able to read he prefers not 
to discuss.) He now makes a living of sorts, teaching a course on 
drumming at Hunter College, performing on stage and playing for voodoo 
ceremonies. The awkward subject of animal sacrifice is one Augustin 
will talk about. Animals are killed in some ceremonies, Augustin says. 
Occasionally, yes, he does feels sorry for the animals. ``But the 
spirit wants it,'' Augustin says. Lois Wilcken, an ethnomusicologist 
who has written a book on voodoo drums that features Augustin and 
who has accompanied him to this meeting, tries to bridge the cultural 
gap: ``In Haiti, most people grow up with fresh meat,'' Ms. Wilcken 
says. ``There's not much refrigeration. They bring an animal home 
and kill it. People are used to it.'' Why now is the music so important 
to Augustin? ``It's my roots, it's how I grew up,'' he says. ``My 
goal now is to leave something for the kids. There are people who 
speak bad of Haitian music. They don't appreciate and respect their 
roots. I don't know how to read. I don't know how to write. But I 
know how to push the drum.''
