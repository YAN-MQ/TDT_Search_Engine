Russian border guards in Tajikistan startled two drug smugglers who 
were trying to cross into the country from Afghanistan on Monday, 
causing them to flee and leave behind three sacks holding 50 kilograms 
(110 pounds) of drugs. The incident occurred at the border section 
along the Pyandzh River early Monday morning, the Interfax news agency 
reported. The drugs dropped by the smugglers included 15 kilograms 
(33 pounds) of heroin, the report said. Russian border guards are 
stationed in the former Soviet republic to guard against an influx 
of drugs and weapons and a possible spillover of violence from Afghanistan. 
Since the start of the year, the border guards have blocked 117 attempted 
border crossings, and detained 218 suspected infiltrators, Interfax 
reported. Thirty-four of these incidents resulted in exchanges of 
fire, and four Russian border guards have been killed. The border 
guards have seized a ton of drugs from various smugglers, including 
150 kilograms (330 pounds) of heroin, this year, Interfax reported.
