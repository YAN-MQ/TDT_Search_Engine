Secretary of state Madeleine Albright met with the wife of imprisoned 
malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. Ibrahim's supporters hope 
international attention on the apec summit will also call attention 
to their cause. Mike Chinoy reports. a demonstration demanding that 
Malaysian prime minister mahathir mohammad resign. In a country where 
dissent has long been stifled, a sign of just how much the political 
landscape has changed here. When Malaysia was chosen to host this 
summit, it was intended to showcase one of the most glittering success 
stories in an economically booming Asia. Now, Malaysia has come to 
symbolize the political and economic convulsions produced by the Asian 
financial meltdown. For 17 years, this nation of 22 million has been 
ruled by mahathir mohammad. Sharp-tongued, prickly and tough, he has 
governed with an iron fist, presiding over breakneck growth and bluntly 
criticizing those who disagreed with him. Other people set standards 
for us. We are supposed to obey them. Mahathir has strong prejudices. 
He tends to believe other people act conspiratorially. In recent years, 
mahathir's closest aide and designated heir was his charismatic finance 
minister Anwar Ibrahim. Charismatic, symbol of a new, more liberal 
generation of Asian leaders. It was an unlikely partnership. But it 
worked until the economic crisis tore it apart. As mahathir blamed 
Malaysia's woes on currency speculators, Jews and the western media, 
Anwar sought to keep the country's economy open. But in September, 
mahathir imposed capital controls, fired Anwar. And ordered his arrest 
on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct. The move sparked widespread 
protests. With a lifetime's work suddenly in jeopardy, mahathir lashed 
out at his favorite target. We have a serious political problem made 
more serious by the way the problem is being reported to the world 
by the all-powerful media. Despite the turmoil, mahathir is still 
firmly in charge. But the long-term prospects for the prime minister 
and his country are now clouded by uncertainty. Mike Chinoy, CNN, 
Kuala Lumpur.
