British Prime Minister Tony Blair says he privately warned the Iraqi 
government last week. About U.S. air strikes over the crisis over 
U.N. weapons inspections. Speaking to Parliament, Blair insisted that 
the current crisis is not over. And repeated that Britain stands ready 
with the U.S. to order force again. NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports 
from London. The Prime Minister said British forces in the Gulf remain 
on high alert. "We do not rely on the good faith of Saddam Hussein," 
he said. "He has none." Blair listed a chronology of the Iraqi leader's 
noncompliance with United Nations' weapons inspectors. And he cited 
western lab tests on Iraqi weapons. It suggests Saddam Hussein has 
lied about having nerve gas and other agents. Blair said if the Iraqi 
President does not comply with weapons inspectors now, the ground 
is laid for the use of force with no warning and no wrangling. He 
said there would not even be need for more discussion in the U.N. 
Security Counsel. The Prime Minister also said Britain will work with 
the U.S. to bolster the Iraqi opposition and boost the chances of 
removing Saddam Hussein from power. I'm Jennifer Ludden, NPR News, 
London.
