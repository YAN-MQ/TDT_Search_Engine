At Inform Fitness in Massapequa, N.Y., there is no piped-in music, 
no blaring televisions and, above all, no clanging and banging of 
weights. There are no treadmills, bicycles or rowing machines. A sign 
on the wall warns exercisers not to drive for at least 30 minutes 
after a workout. Owned by Adam Zickerman, a trainer, Inform is one 
of about 100 centers in the country that teach Super Slow, a weight-training 
technique that involves lifting weights in ultraslow motion. The workouts 
are done in total silence to promote focus and concentration. No talking 
is allowed except for coaching by the trainer. Because the regimen 
is so physically demanding (hence the 30-minute wait before driving), 
Zickerman recommends doing a maximum of two Super Slow workouts a 
week. Zickerman and members of the Super Slow Guild, a loose group 
of personal trainers who are certified by what they call a Super Slow 
``master,'' believe that this high-intensity training method _ with 
its long-lasting repetitions _ is more effective than traditional 
weight training for building muscle strength. While a conventional 
repetition takes about 2 to 6 seconds, a Super Slow repetition lasts 
an excruciating 20 seconds. ``When you lift quickly,'' Zickerman said, 
``the exercise goes by so fast, your muscles don't have time to latch 
on to the movement. Moving very slowly fatigues the greatest number 
of muscle fibers.'' He adds that the majority of weight-training injuries 
are caused by extraneous movement of the body during weight lifting, 
a problem that he says is completely eliminated by the Super Slow 
technique. But some of the other ideas supported by the Super Slow 
Guild are much more extreme. Members believe, for instance, that Super 
Slow is the best _ and only _way to achieve fitness. They say that 
all other forms of exercise, especially aerobic activities like running 
and jogging, are not only worthless but dangerous. Zickerman calls 
aerobic workouts ``empty exercise'' because, he contends, muscles 
work in an uncontrolled, haphazard manner that depletes the body's 
recovery systems and leads to injuries. He and other guild members 
believe that the increases in muscular strength brought about by Super 
Slow weight lifting will translate to adequate improvements in cardiovascular 
function and stamina. Most mainstream exercise experts strongly disagree 
with these conclusions, including Michael Motta, an exercise physiologist 
and president of Plus One Fitness, a fitness management company. Though 
Motta believes that lifting weights slowly is a good idea, ``to say 
that the many thousands of studies correlating cardiovascular activity 
with reduced incidence of heart disease and other health risks are 
invalid is preposterous,'' he said. ``It flies in the face of common 
sense.'' Dr. Wayne Wescott, the strength training consultant to the 
national YMCA, sees the merits of Super Slow training but does not 
support the anti-aerobic stance. In an eight-week study he conducted 
recently at the YMCA in Newton, Mass., he found that subjects following 
a Super Slow program were able to lift an average of 27 pounds more 
per exercise than they could at the beginning of the study, compared 
with a 22-pound increase per exercise with a standard 6-second repetition. 
``The results are really quite impressive,'' Wescott said. ``Though 
the system can be tedious, it seems well worth the effort.'' Michele 
Mingoia, 44, a software programmer in Oviedo, Fla., has found that 
Super Slow training works for her. She has been doing it as her only 
form of exercise for a number of years. ``When I first walked into 
the facility I was a size 10,'' she said. ``Now I'm buying 4's.'' 
Ms. Mingoia does one training session a week, which consists of six, 
three-minute sets of weights with about a minute rest between exercises. 
She describes her workouts as both intense and meditative. Most experts 
concede that high-intensity weight training methods like Super Slow 
have their place in advanced exercise routines, but are probably too 
challenging and result in too much muscle soreness for novice exercisers. 
They say the ideal fitness program should include a combination of 
cardiovascular, flexibility and strength exercise. ``There is nothing 
magical about Super Slow,'' Wescott said. ``It's a good idea to move 
weight slowly to reduce momentum and increase force on the muscle.''
