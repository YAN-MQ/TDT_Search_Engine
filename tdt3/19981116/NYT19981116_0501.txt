Since the Rams and Raiders fled four seasons ago, the Los Angeles 
market has been a black hole for the National Football League. While 
St. Louis snared the Rams and Oakland took the Raiders back, the NFL 
has expanded to Charlotte, Jacksonville and Cleveland. There is no 
guarantee that expansion will yield a 32nd team. It should. Thirty-one 
is too odd. If expansion arrives, the name in the envelope may not 
be Los Angeles. The winner could be Houston, whose Oilers left in 
1996, and where a well-regarded bid by Bob McNair could catch the 
NFL's fancy. So the league has one city to play off another, and two 
Los Angeles bidders to play off each other. The setup could not elate 
the league more. The NFL does not always make the expected decision. 
When Baltimore and St. Louis were favorites for expansion in 1993, 
the league chose Jacksonville. You never know what will happen when 
the owners meet on Feb. 16. But there is hope among two high-powered 
Los Angeles groups that the NFL feels it must return to the country's 
second-largest TV market. ``Deep down, the NFL knows it must be in 
Los Angeles,'' Michael Ovitz, the former talent agent, said during 
an interview in Manhattan last week. ``Los Angeles is the world's 
11th-largest economy.'' Ovitz's Hollywood group _ including Tom Cruise, 
Kevin Costner, Shaquille O'Neal and the venture capitalist Ted Forstmann 
_ wants to build a 77,000-seat stadium and 1.2 million-square-foot 
mall in Carson. If the bid fails, Ovitz will at least have a snazzy 
cast for a film. Edward Roski Jr. is Ovitz's rival. Ovitz is a renowned 
deal maker, but he has never owned a sports team or erected a sports 
facility. Roski owns the Los Angeles Kings with Philip Anschutz; together 
they are building the downtown Staples Center that will house the 
Kings, the Lakers and the Clippers. Last week, Roski and Anschutz 
exercised an option to buy 25 percent of the Lakers. His plan is to 
gut the innards of the 75-year-old Los Angeles Coliseum, keep the 
familiar exterior, and rebuild it into a 67,000-seat stadium with 
dandy sightlines. ``It would be a defining stadium for the NFL,'' 
Roski said. To win hearts and votes, Roski must overcome the owners' 
residual distaste for the Coliseum's inner-city neighborhood, which 
is part of Exposition Park and adjacent to the University of Southern 
California. ``The area has changed,'' Roski said. ``Close to $6 billion 
has been invested in the area the last four or five years.'' Roski 
would also have to sell the Silverton Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, Nev. 
Last week, The Los Angeles Times reported that he owned the casino. 
NFL rules prohibit casino ownership. ``If that's the rule, I'll accept 
it and live within it,'' Roski said in a telephone interview yesterday. 
Ovitz's plan _ which began as a discussion with the real estate developer 
Herbert Glimcher about a mall _ is to create a new experience, with 
a Mission-style stadium with bells that would ring after a home-team 
touchdown. ``It's up to the owners to see if they want to go back 
to where they've been,'' Ovitz said. ``What works in Los Angeles is 
something new, fresh and exciting.'' Both men say their sites would 
be the most central and most reachable on Sunday afternoons. Ovitz 
said Carson is 10 minutes from downtown, 25 from Beverly Hills and 
35 from Pasadena. Six million people live within 20 minutes of Carson, 
he said. ``All major freeways come right to the area,'' Ovitz said. 
Roski rejected the Carson site for his arena because it is a landfill 
that needs a state-approved $35 million cleanup. ``It'll take time 
and money,'' Ovitz said. ``There's no flat land in L.A. without something 
dumped on it.'' Roski said: ``At the Coliseum, we don't have to face 
an environmental process. All the infrastructure work is done. We 
don't have to buy the land.'' The team will cost Ovitz, Roski or McNair 
plenty. Thanks to the $70 million a year that each team will get from 
CBS, ABC, Fox and ESPN, the NFL can justify the $530 million that 
Al Lerner paid for the Browns. ``They've told us it won't be less 
than Cleveland,'' said Roski, who would own at least half the team 
and stadium. McNair loaded up for the purchase last week by selling 
the bulk of his power company, Cogen Technologies, for $1.1 billion 
and $350 million in assumed debt. It may not matter that Los Angeles 
and Houston fans did not mourn for their lost teams as Browns fans 
did. What may matter is the moneyed enthusiasm of the bidders, who 
will be happy to force their cash upon the NFL's owners.
