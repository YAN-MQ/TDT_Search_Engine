A massive search of Swiss banks for missing assets of Holocaust victims 
is taking longer than expected, with the final report delayed six 
months, a panel member said Monday. Curt Gasteyger, a Geneva professor 
who is on the commission headed by former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman 
Paul Volcker, confirmed that the panel hopes to finish its audit by 
the end of March and write the final report by July. Gasteyger said, 
however, that it had been clear for some time that the commission 
would be unable to meet the original deadline of December 31. He claimed 
relations between the banks and the commission had improved despite 
a report in the Geneva daily Le Temps that tensions had increased. 
The newspaper said banks were concerned about the mounting cost of 
the investigation _ said by the paper to be close to a billion Swiss 
francs (dlrs 730 million) by the end of the investigation _ and the 
prospect of the investigation being extended. In a letter to the Swiss 
Bankers Association, reproduced in Le Temps, Volcker says the report 
will not be ready until the middle of 1999, adding that this is not 
a firm date. The committee is investigating 63 Swiss banks believed 
to have retained money in accounts belonging to Jewish victims of 
the Nazis. The two largest Swiss commercial banks have already agreed 
to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors and their heirs for 
lost assets.
