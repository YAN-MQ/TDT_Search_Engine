For THE WORLD, this is Alan Dow in the BBC newsroom in London. Talks 
have broken up between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic over the conflict in Kosovo. Mr. Holbrooke says 
the situation remains serious and further discussions will follow. 
Mike Williams reports from Belgrade. Mr. Holbrooke's aides say no 
time has been set for his departure. And he will stay in Belgrade 
as long as there is a chance of success. He brought with him a six 
point plan summarizing the demands of the United Nations and the Contact 
Group, the six countries which established themselves to help solve 
the myriad of problems of the former Yugoslavia. Their demands include 
a halt to hostilities in Kosovo between Serb security forces and ethnic 
Albanian rebels who are seeking independence. They also call for a 
reduction in the numbers of army and special police units in the province.
