The weakening dollar may be good news for U.S. exporters but it's 
not good news for Japan. I'm Richard Griffith at the New York business 
desk. Tokyo stocks fell to their lowest level for 13 years today, 
as a weaker dollar raised fears of reduced profits in high profile 
Japanese firms like Sony Corporation and Canon. As the dollar falls 
against the yen, Japanese exports become more expensive abroad limiting 
sales. Economist Brian Fabrey says the dollars sudden weakness is 
fraying nerves. For corporate Japan, it's a worry. The markets have 
marked down their profitability prospects immediately, whether or 
not the currency remains here and would therefore then have the real 
impact on their export ability. From the United States point of view 
though, if the dollar were to continue being weak, it will diminish 
investment incentives into the United States and that will have further 
implications for our own economic growth. Will some expects the effect 
of the dollar's weakness to be limited, today it helped depress the 
mood in European markets toward exporters. Anglo/U.S. pharmaceutical 
giant Glaxo was among those firms to see its shares hit.
