Yesterday's awarding of the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize to Portuguese 
novelist Jose Saramagu leaves five more Nobels to go. Next week, the 
winners of the prestigious awards in medicine, physics and chemistry, 
economics and peace will be announced. But, once again, a journal 
called "The Annals of Improbably Research" has beaten the Swedish 
Academy to the punch. As we reported yesterday, the Ignobel prizes 
have been awarded at a ceremony a couple of miles from here in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, and here are a few highlights: The prize for medicine 
went to the British doctors who published a paper titled, "A Man Who 
Pricked His Finger and Smelled Putrid for Five Years." A Canadian 
man took home the safety engineering Ignobel for his work on a suit 
of armor impervious to grisly bears, and the biology prize went to 
an American professor who stumbled onto the fact that mollusks reproduce 
ten times the normal rate of prozacs in the water, which is probably 
why they're happy as clams.
