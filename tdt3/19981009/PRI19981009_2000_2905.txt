Still to come, music that's Red Hot in Lisbon on PRI, Public Radio 
International. THE WORLD is made possible in part by Merck, a research-driven 
pharmaceutical company discovering, developing and manufacturing a 
broad range of human and animal health products and services. Merck. 
Committed to bringing out the best in medicine. And THE WORLD is brought 
to you by The Capital Group, investing throughout THE WORLD for individuals 
and institutions. You are tuned to THE WORLD on 91 FM, WHYY. After 
THE WORLD tonight at 9, stay tuned for TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE 
FRIDAY with Ira Flatow. On this program, a report from the first-ever 
conference on mathematics and the media. Then at 10 is ON THE MEDIA 
and a discussion of the toll on journalists of reporting on crime. 
The question is raised, how can such reporters do their jobs well 
and come out intact? Also on the program, a Rupert watch. Media mogul 
Rupert Murdoch has his hands on just about everything. Listen to ON 
THE MEDIA tonight at 10 for a commentary on that. That's ON THE MEDIA 
in just over an hour from now at 10, just after TALK OF THE NATION 
SCIENCE FRIDAY, next at 9. This is 91 FM.
