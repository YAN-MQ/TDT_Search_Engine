South African Deputy President problem Becky has launched a national 
campaign to counter AIDS. South Africa has one of the highest rates 
of HIV infection in THE WORLD with an estimated 1,500 new cases each 
day. Employers urged their workers to take a break to listen to Mr. 
Becky's appeal as it was broadcast on radio and TV. HIV, AIDS is not 
someone else's problem. It is my problem, it is your problem. By allowing 
it to spread, we face the danger that half of our youth will not reach 
adulthood. The economy will shrink, our dreams as a people will be 
shattered. Tabo Em Becky.
