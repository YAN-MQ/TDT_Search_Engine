Farmers across Central and Eastern Europe are heading for one of the 
hardest winters in many years. They're struggling to match the lost 
cost of food imports coming from the European Union. And as the BBC's 
David Ease reports, the Christmas holidays are particularly distressing 
for one group of farmers. This may be the season to be jolly, but 
not if you're a farmer relying on Christmas to secure your livelihood. 
Turkey's at Christmas sell well in Poland. In the rest of the country, 
turkey farms are feature built up by the former Soviet elite. And 
they've brought in substantial incomes for a growing number of farmers. 
But this year, the farmers say they have no markets to sell to. They 
say the slaughter houses won't take the bird in, because they don't 
know who will collect them to sell on. Polish supermarkets are stocking 
up on imports, mostly from Germany and France which are cheaper. A 
depressing message then for the Turkey farmers and is only a stay 
of execution for the turkeys as they will have to be destroyed if 
they do survived the Christmas period. The BBC's David Ease with the 
story of the plight of the turkey in Eastern Europe this Christmas.
