President Clinton from office over the Monica Lewinsky affair could 
destabilize the presidency. In an interview with the New York Times, 
Mr. Monehan says the presidency as an institution, must be protected. 
The influential Democrat from New York made clear he favors censuring 
Mr. Clinton. Vice President Al Gore has indicated he is also in favor 
of censure. Saying that circumstances do not warrant the President's 
removal. The President has said that he did not lie under oath. He 
has acknowledged that he gave statements that were less than helpful 
to his interrogators. That's Vice President Al Gore.
