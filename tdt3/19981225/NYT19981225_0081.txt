Faced with more long-range drought conditions in Florida, state officials 
are seeking $35 million for an aggressive controlled-burning program 
to prevent a repetition of last summer's fires, which destroyed more 
than 500,000 acres. The state Agriculture Department, criticized by 
agriculture groups and timber landowners for not being aggressive 
enough in using controlled burning before last summer's fires, said 
it planned to burn considerably more than the 2 million acres of public 
and private land that were burned in 1998. State Agriculture Secretary 
Robert Crawford said the fires ``demonstrated that we must do more.'' 
``We'll never be able to eliminate wildfires, but we can minimize 
their impact,'' said Crawford, who has asked the state legislature 
for the money for more people and equipment to fight fires. He has 
proposed mandatory controlled burning in buffer zones around towns 
and subdivisions, aided by state firefighting crews, and is considering 
expanding the time to prohibit burning from one hour before sunset 
to one hour after sunset. A public meeting is scheduled for Jan. 20 
in Gainesville to explain the program to landowners. Crawford's actions 
follow a recent report by the governor's Wildfire Response and Mitigation 
Review Committee, which said the state must strengthen its authority 
to do more controlled burning despite protests from some property 
owners who object to smoke hanging over their neighborhoods. ``As 
the state becomes more populated, people not familiar with controlled 
burning don't like to smell smoke,'' said Jim Handley, executive vice 
president of the Florida Cattlemen's Association. Controlled burning, 
in which fires are set to burn off highly combustible brush in forested 
areas, eliminates fuels, enhances the growth of desirable forages 
and improves rangeland, Handley said. Cattlemen and farmers want the 
state to ease its strict laws on controlled burning. Handley was among 
critics who told Crawford last summer that the fires could have been 
prevented with more controlled burning. While acknowledging that some 
controlled burning permits were denied earlier this year, Earl Peterson, 
director of the Florida Division of Forestry, said, ``I don't think 
it can be shown many people were denied authorizations to burn to 
the effect it would have made any appreciable difference.'' The number 
of fires last summer, 2,300, caused an estimated $400 million in losses 
to timber and destroyed 300 homes. The cost of fighting the fires 
was estimated at $150 million. More dry weather is forecast for the 
state for the next two months.
