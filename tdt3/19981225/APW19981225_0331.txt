Peace talks to end to the war in Congo were postponed for the third 
time after Congo President Laurent Kabila refused to meet with rebel 
leaders, the state controlled Herald newspaper reported in Zimbabwe 
on Friday. A summit of regional presidents was scheduled in the Zambian 
capital of Lusaka on Monday. The Herald said regional leaders failed 
to agree on ``the level of participation'' of Congolese rebels at 
the summit. It said South Africa favored face-to-face talks between 
all warring sides while Kabila and his southern African military allies 
_ Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe _ wanted ``proximity talks'' with the 
rebels mediated by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba. Kabila's refusal 
to meet with the rebels doomed two earlier summits aimed at ending 
the five-month-old war that involves troops from six other nations. 
No date for a rescheduled summit was given. Rwanda and Uganda, which 
back the rebels, have admitted sending troops onto Congolese soil. 
The two countries argue that a tentative peace agreement forged in 
Paris last month does not fully address their security concerns. Kabila 
has insisted on negotiating only with Rwanda and Uganda. He refuses 
to speak to the rebel coalition made up of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected 
Congolese soldiers and opposition Congolese politicians.
