Exiled Saudi militant Usamah Bin Laden has renewed a call for attacks 
on U.S., British, and Israeli targets. He made the call in two interviews. 
One with the American television network, ABC. And another with a 
London-based Arabic Daily. Mr. Bin Laden said the people of Britain 
and the United States are, in his words: "warmongers" for supporting 
last week's bombing of Iraq. And therefore, deserve to be killed. 
He also called on Muslims to rid Islamic countries of Americans and 
the Jews. Mr. Bin Laden again denied involvement in the bombings of 
two embassies in East Africa last August.
