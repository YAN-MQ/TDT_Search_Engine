Hello everyone, and welcome to Science World. I'm Brian Sislack. The 
weather, it's something that everyone talks about, but no one can 
do anything about. That's worrisome, because weather effects our lives 
in many different ways. According to the American Academy of Microbiology, 
its impact is even greater than we realized. Recent advances in satellite 
imaging, meteorology, and molecular biology are pointing out previously 
unknown relationships between weather and disease. The recent El Nino 
is a good example. The report says in Columbia, there was a 20 percent 
increase in malaria in the year following El Nino. Satellite data 
showed a link between an El Nino in the early 1990's and outbreaks 
of cholera in Peru and along the Bay of Bengal. Honta virus, a lung 
infection spread by deer mice in the Southwestern U.S., also took 
off following an El Nino. Higher rainfall increased production of 
peno nuts, which deermice love to eat. More food led to more mice. 
And increased spread of the honta virus to humans. This all goes to 
show that human disease is far from simple. And that we are very much 
a part of our environment.
