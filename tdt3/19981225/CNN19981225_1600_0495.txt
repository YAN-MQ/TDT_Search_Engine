Authorities in long beach, California, are trying to determine the 
cause of a water main break. It caused 1 million gallons of water 
to pour into a residential and business neighborhood. No injuries 
are reported, but dozens of people were evacuated. They have since 
been allowed to return home. As many as 30 businesses were damaged 
because of the water, and several large sinkholes have appeared. A 
quarter-mile stretch of the pacific coast highway is closed, and could 
stay that way for days.
