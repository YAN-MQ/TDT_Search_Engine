And a unique Major League Baseball deal in Boston will preserve the 
smell of peanuts and sausages outside of Fenway Park. The city of 
Boston and the Red Sox reached an agreement Thursday, to transform 
a neighboring street into a pedestrian mall on game days. The move 
will allow food vendors and fans to freely mingle outside the stadium. 
In seasons past, the vendors had to wade through parked cars and slow-moving 
traffic, adding to the congestion of fans trying to get in and out 
of Fenway Park. The street vendors have been one of the ballpark's 
traditions. Selling food and Red Sox-related items for more than 85 
years. That's a look at sports, I'm Jim Stevenson.
