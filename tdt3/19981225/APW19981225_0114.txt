Three balloonists streaking across the Pacific Ocean were caught into 
a dangerous weather system early Friday that threatened their attempt 
at the first nonstop balloon trip around the world. ``It's in the 
lap of the gods,'' the team's project director Mike Kendrick, said 
Friday. British mogul Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve 
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden got sucked into a low pressure 
system overnight that brought the balloon down close to the surface 
of the water about 200 miles (322 kilometers) north of Honolulu, Hawaii. 
At 0830 GMT the balloon was stalled above the sea, traveling at only 
14 knots (16 mph or 26 kph), leaving the adventurers with two choices, 
Kendrick told SKY News from the balloon's ground control headquarters 
in England. ``We can either land the balloon around the Hawaiian Islands, 
where helicopters can get to them,'' he said, ``or we can try and 
find an easterly wind _ somehow _ and have a crack at getting to the 
American mainland.'' ``It's not looking great at the moment, I must 
admit,'' he said. ``But they are determined to find the wind. They 
are fighting for it anyway.'' He said the bid is not in an emergency 
situation yet and that the team have already found a wind, albeit 
a weak one. ``It 's going to be a long, slow crawl back in the next 
few hours to see if they can get the other side of this trough and 
accelerate,'' he said. ``We want to fight this, we want to get in 
that wind, we want to bring this back.'' A C-130 Hercules plane is 
airborne and measuring wind speeds and helping to find a faster wind, 
said spokeswoman Lori Levin. Levin said emergency rescue teams in 
Hawaii have been alerted to the problem but the flight group has not 
yet asked for help. The crew, planning to fly at 28,000 feet (8,500 
meters) to 31,000 feet (9,500 meters) in a pressurized capsule, had 
expected to reach North America sometime Christmas Day, most likely 
in the evening over southern Canada or Washington State. Balloon pilots 
navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to ascend or descend 
into different wind systems, but cannot plan their courses and speeds 
precisely. The voyage of the 272-foot-high (83-meter-high) hot-air 
and helium balloon began in Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 18, and, if 
successful, would end in Western Europe. The team secured permission 
from 97 countries for overflights and initially had only four refusals 
_ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea. China had said the balloonists 
could cross their territory below 26 degrees north latitude, but the 
balloon strayed from its path Monday after navigating around storms 
and closed airspace over Iraq, Iran and Russia. The Chinese asked 
the balloonists to land at an airfield, but the balloon overshot the 
site and could not come down anywhere else. With the help of British 
diplomats, the balloonists won Chinese permission to continue. However, 
Swiss-based challengers to the ICO Global balloon said Thursday that 
the Chinese government had asked them to postpone their attempt, scheduled 
to begin as early as Sunday from a Swiss Alpine resort.
