Members of the Cabinet and parliament convened Friday to discuss possible 
amendments to the draft 1999 budget before the document goes up for 
a second vote in the legislature. The lower house of parliament, or 
the State Duma, gave quick initial approval to the draft budget Thursday 
in a sign of political support for Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's 
government. Yet the draft still must go through several rounds of 
voting in the legislature, and lawmakers are expected to propose amendments 
during each stage. President Boris Yeltsin praised the quick passage 
of the draft during a telephone conversation Friday with Duma speaker 
Gennady Seleznyov, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said. ``The 
president expressed hope that if this kind of cooperation between 
the executive power and the Duma continues, then major success will 
await us in 1999,'' Yakushkin told reporters. A task-force made up 
of representatives of the two chambers of parliament and the Cabinet 
met Friday. It appeared that the task-force managed to resolve only 
a few issues linked with Russia's proposed tax reform. The commission 
proposed lowering the minimum taxable income from 60,000 rubles (dlrs 
3,000) a year to 30,000 or 40,000 rubles (dlrs 1,500 to dlrs 2,000) 
a year, said Alexander Zhukov, the chairman of the Duma's budget committee. 
It also proposed raising the value-added tax from 15 percent to 17 
percent, he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Economy 
Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said Friday that the slide of the ruble 
and the ensuing fall in imports have given Russian producers a ``unique'' 
chance to ``occupy market niches earlier held by imports.'' He added 
that production and sale of some domestic goods has already risen 
10 percent to 50 percent since the start of the crisis. Desperate 
to fill its coffers, the government is trying to keep up exports of 
oil _ Russia's main revenue earner _ despite the slide in world oil 
prices, said Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister Valery Garipov. In the 
first 10 months of this year, Russia's oil exports were up 8.1 percent 
against the same period last year and reached 114 million metric tons, 
Garipov said. However, oil export earnings were down to 27.7 percent, 
to dlrs 8.9 billion, he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
Russia's oil production this year is expected to total 302 million 
metric tons, and exports may exceed 130 million metric tons, he said. 
Also Friday, the state-controlled savings bank Sberbank began repaying 
private deposits transferred from SBS-Agro, a commercial bank that 
froze its accounts after the economic crisis hit in August.
