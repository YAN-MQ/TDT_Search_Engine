The mostly empty parking lots, corridors and offices were a concession 
to the holiday, but the operations center of the nation's spying apparatus 
was fully staffed Friday except for one worker who phoned in sick. 
``We are the eyes and ears of the director,'' said Phillip Glover, 
the senior duty officer, speaking of his boss, George Tenet, the director 
of Central Intelligence. ``We are sort of the watchdog, after hours, 
24 hours.'' In many cities people spend holidays away from their families 
because their jobs never stop _ police officers, firefighters, hospital 
nurses and the like. Washington has these, too, but it also has full-timers 
unique to a capital, like those who handle foreign intelligence at 
the CIA and the domestic equivalent at the FBI. Behind Glover several 
television sets and clocks gave the times at various places around 
the world. On his desk computer monitors hummed quietly but secure 
telephones did not ring. ``We never say it's a slow day because there's 
always something happening,'' Glover said. U.S. intelligence has been 
on a special alert since the bombings earlier this year at two United 
States embassies in Africa, and particular attention is being paid 
to trouble spots like Iraq and Kosovo. The CIA also has a special 
interest in Osama bin Laden, the suspected terrorist who recently 
denied any role in the embassy bombings. Only a small fraction of 
the employees were on the job Friday, said Mark Mansfield, the CIA's 
deputy director of public affairs. But he would not disclose the number 
of people who worked at the agency's huge headquarters in Langley, 
a series of modern buildings on a campuslike setting across the Potomac 
River from Washington in the Virginia suburbs. One working Friday 
was Wayne Myers, the duty officer of the Foreign Broadcast Information 
Service, which is part of the operations center and continuously monitors 
foreign news sources. Asked about Friday's priorities, he mentioned 
bin Laden, Iraq and world opinion on the recent attacks on Iraq by 
the United States and Britain. As Myers spoke, the information service, 
which is popularly known by its acronyn Fibis and is widely available, 
reported on optimistic local accounts on the health of two foreign 
leaders. The Jordanian newspaper Al-'Arab al-Yawn related that the 
country's ambassador to the United States had said that King Hussein, 
who has been treated for cancer in the United States, ``is in excellent 
shape and will leave the hospital within the next two days.'' That 
came in at 12:14 p.m. Five minutes later, a report came in from the 
Interfax news agency in Russia quoting the leader of Belarus, Alexander 
Lukashenko, as having said that Russian President Boris Yeltsin ``is 
in excellent physical shape.'' Yeltsin had heart bypass surgery two 
years ago and has been hospitalized five times since then, most recently 
because of pneumonia. Glover noted that there had been recent reports 
in Russia that Yeltsin was planning to make some trips abroad. Another 
broadcast service report came in. A leader of the Palestinian militant 
group Hamas had been released from house arrest and he used the occasion 
to denounce the United States. ``We pretty much have the world at 
this desk,'' Myers said. Over at the cubicle of the National Imagery 
and Mapping Agency, its officer, Carl Brennan, dealt with selecting 
subjects to be put under the lens of U.S. spy satellites. When asked 
what images were acquired, he answered: ``It's what's interesting. 
You can assume that there's a lot of interest about Iraq and also 
Serbia. Last week was very busy _ bomb damage in Iraq. We are interested 
today in activity in Sierra Leone.'' The last reference was to a civil 
war in West Africa. ``But it's calmer now, thankfully,'' Brennan said. 
``Last week was not a lot of fun.'' Glover and his colleagues were 
putting in just another long day (they work 12 hours on and 12 hours 
off, three or four days a week) as most of the nation unwrapped gifts, 
ate big dinners or watched football games. No holiday at the CIA? 
Glover was asked. ``No,'' he answered. ``We're here _ whenever.''
