South African police say two gunmen killed eight people and injured 
two others at a Christmas party in Kwazulu-Natal Province. Police 
say the men, who had been denied entry to the party, gunned down seven 
men and one woman at a private home in Margate Town. Five guests escaped 
unharmed. Police are looking for the suspects. It is not clear if 
the killings were politically motivated. President Nelson Mandela 
has expressed outrage over the incident. A French news agency reports 
the President urged South Africans not to take the law into their 
own hands. And resort to any revenge attacks.
