President Boris Yeltsin may travel to France in January, his spokesman 
said Friday. This would be the first foreign trip after months of 
canceled travel plans due to Yeltsin's ailments. Russian media and 
politicians _ including Yeltsin's own aides _ have speculated that 
Yeltsin's health problems would rule out any foreign travel during 
the rest of his term, which runs out in mid-2000. Angered by such 
suggestions, Yeltsin fired his staff wholesale earlier this month 
and appointed a new team, which soon announced that doctors had judged 
Yeltsin fit to travel and that several trips abroad are planned for 
1999. No definite schedule has been announced. Yeltsin doesn't plan 
to leave Moscow before the end of the year, presidential spokesman 
Dmitry Yakushkin said Friday. But ``the work schedule for January 
is being worked out now, and a trip to France is being considered,'' 
Yakushkin told reporters. In another move to assert his authority, 
Yeltsin scolded his potential successors Thursday for actively mounting 
presidential campaigns 18 months before the election _ or even acting 
as if they were already president. Yeltsin didn't name names. Yakushkin 
said he had asked Yeltsin to elaborate on Friday, but the president 
had refused. ``He smiled and said: `Let them think. Let them guess,''' 
Yakushkin said. Yeltsin appeared to be referring to Moscow Mayor Yuri 
Luzhkov, who recently launched his own political movement and has 
been speaking out on national issues such as economic policy and Russia's 
foreign relations. Luzhkov has been an ally of Yeltsin for years, 
but recently the mayor has been critical of the president. Yeltsin 
worked at the Kremlin on Friday, meeting with his chief of staff Nikolai 
Bordyuzha and holding telephone conversations with Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov and speaker of parliament Gennady Seleznyov. During 
a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Yeltsin 
appeared tired, though he spoke clearly and strongly. At one point, 
an aide had to help him out of his chair. Yeltsin has made only occasional 
trips to the Kremlin recently, spending most of his time at Gorky-9 
while recuperating from illnesses including a recent bout of pneumonia. 
The 67-year-old leader underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery two 
years ago. But he insists he has no crippling illness and intends 
to serve out his term, which runs until mid-2000. Aside from his meetings, 
Yeltsin was busy Friday preparing New Year's gifts for his grandchildren. 
New Year is the biggest holiday in Russia, while Christmas _ celebrated 
on Jan. 7 _ is largely an afterthought. Yeltsin plans to celebrate 
New Year with his family at a country residence near Moscow, gathering 
around a camp fire outside when the clock strikes midnight, Yakushkin 
said. The clock will strike midnight twice for the Yeltsins: The family 
celebrates New Year first when it comes to their native Siberian city 
of Yekaterinburg, two time zones ahead of Moscow, and then according 
to Moscow time, Yakushkin said.
