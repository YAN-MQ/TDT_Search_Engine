Three adventurers trying to make the first nonstop round-the-world 
flight in a balloon abandoned their quest Friday, ditching in the 
shark-infested waters off Honolulu a little more than halfway through 
their journey. Coast Guard helicopters hoisted them from the water 
in good condition and high spirits. The men _ British mogul Richard 
Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of 
Sweden _ quit seven days into their journey after they lost the high-altitude, 
high-speed winds they needed to carry them eastward across the Pacific 
to North America. They had gotten caught in a low-pressure ``trough'' 
and feared they would be stuck there for a week. ``We weren't let 
down by any of our training or our equipment. But we were let down 
by the weather,'' Lindstrand said. ``It was a ridiculous way to spend 
your Christmas Day but it was certainly exciting,'' Branson said in 
a thank-you call to the operations control room in London. They lowered 
the 272-foot-high (83-meter), combination helium and hot-air balloon 
and let it hit the Pacific Ocean about 10 miles (16 kms) north of 
the island of Oahu, where the craft bounced across the water for miles 
(kilometers) because the explosive bolts that were supposed to cut 
the balloon loose from the crew capsule had been frozen by the cold 
and didn't work. The men, wearing their survival suits, were in the 
water no more than 10 minutes before they were hoisted in baskets 
aboard two Coast Guard helicopters, Fossett said. Lindstrand said 
he has ditched many aircraft in the past, but ``this was the worst. 
It was horrendous.'' The craft was not immediately recovered, but 
Fossett said plans were under way to salvage at least the capsule 
and the equipment aboard. All three balloonists have made a total 
of 11 attempts at a nonstop flight around globe, some of which ended 
in near tragedy. This time, as the balloon was landing, Fossett said, 
he was thinking ``about the fact that I've made three attempts to 
fly round the world just in 1998 and it's getting pretty discouraging.'' 
``I think it's time to go sailing,'' Fossett said. The men were brought 
ashore at Barbers Point, about 10 miles (16 kms) west of Honolulu. 
U.S. customs inspectors were waiting to meet them and have them sign 
the declaration forms required of all those entering the United States. 
The balloon voyage began on Dec. 18 in Marrakech, Morocco, and, if 
successful, would have ended in Western Europe. The crew had hoped 
to reach North America sometime Friday, flying over southern Canada 
or Washington state. They covered 12,500 miles (20,100 kms) before 
giving up. ``We were not told for 15 minutes whether they were alive, 
dead or injured,'' project director Mike Kendrick said from London. 
``I know it is a failure, but it is a glorious failure.'' Balloon 
pilots cannot steer or control their speed with any precision, relying 
instead on extremely fast, high-altitude winds to carry them around 
the globe. They navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to ascend 
or descend into different wind currents. After racing across the Pacific 
in winds of up to 200 mph (320 kph), the adventurers' balloon got 
sucked into a low-pressure system. They maneuvered the craft up and 
down between 6,000 feet (1,830 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230 meters) 
to try to find a fast easterly wind. But the best they could do was 
a 16 mph (25 kph) wind. ``This is particularly disappointing,'' Fossett 
said. ``Last night the weather changed on us and we were stuck. In 
the middle of the night we decided it was a hopeless situation.'' 
If the balloonists had made the West Coast, they would have broken 
the balloon distance record that Fossett set on an attempt to circumnavigate 
the globe earlier this year. He, too, was forced to ditch in the shark-infested 
waters of the Pacific. During the journey, the team secured permission 
from 97 countries to cross their airspace. Iran, Iraq, Russia and 
North Korea refused permission. The crew also had some tense moments 
when they passed over China farther north than the balloon had been 
authorized to fly.
