There's a place where Christmas is celebrated 365 days a year. Patricia 
Kelly takes us on a tour of Santa claus village. -- to see. Santa. 
Have you been a good boy? yes. Santa claus village is where they're 
headed, where it's Christmas all year-round. There are different ways 
to have traveling over snow and ice. Snowmobiles are the swiftest. 
With the dog sled, if it's too fast, there are reindeer for a gentler 
pace. To stay warm, the laplanders dress as they have for generations. 
We've just built this place in the aurkt O'Arctic circle he says, 
but we've been looking after Santa's reindeer for eight years. He 
visit his reindeer regularly, he uses more than one reindeer only 
on christmas eve when his sleigh is heavily loaded. This is the ultimate 
Christmas experience. If Santa's village doesn't put you in a festive 
mood, nothing will. Inside Santa's post office, visitors can order 
letters from Santa claus for a friend. Last year 702,000 letters arrived 
for Santa. This year the post office is expecting 1 million. Daylight 
lasts only a few hours at this time of year. The illuminated cable 
shows where the arc irk circle begins. The temperature here regularly 
drps well below zero. You have to think warm. The shops sell everything 
to do with Christmas. If the commercial side of Christmas gets too 
much, a corner for silent meditation has been built out of ice. But 
the highlight is of course a chance to meet Santa claus. If you're 
wondering what he'll be doing Christmas day -- Maybe have a little 
longer sleep. He's got a word for everyone, not just the children. 
Held my hand. Told me he'd bring me a new car, which we're going to 
get. Patricia Kelly, CNN at Santa's village.
