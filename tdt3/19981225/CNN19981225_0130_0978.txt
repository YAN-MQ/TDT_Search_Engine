If you put money away in escrow, it can sometimes earn sizeable interest 
on the balance. But who gets to keep that money? As Lauren Thierry 
reports, the answer may surprise you. When Jerry liung bought a Manhattan 
apartment, he put $20,000 in escrow. The money sat for eight months. 
At the closing, liung asked his lawyer about the interest earned on 
the money. He said that it was going to go to a fund for the poor. 
And we were kind of shocked, and we never heard of this. According 
to laws now in all 50 states, when a lawyer temporarily holds a client's 
money, he has a choice -- one, open a bank savings account in the 
client's name, earning perhaps 2% to 2.5% in annual interest. Or two, 
park the money in a general fund where any interest earned supports 
legal services to the poor. Only in certain cases can an attorney 
choose this route. We call those qualifying funds. That means they're 
too small or they'll be held too briefly to get enough interest to 
make it worth all of the expense of opening an account, generating 
the tax forms and all of that. In other words, interest income is 
supposed to go to the poor only in cases where a client would have 
netted little or no money in bank interest. In liung's case, the closing 
dragged on much longer than expected, so he might have earned more 
than $300 in interest. There's no reason why not. I mean, it was going 
to a good cause, but it's nice to know beforehand. To avoid confusion 
ask your attorney up front whether your money will earn interest for 
you, how much and where. The decision rests in your lawyer's hands. 
But he or she could change that for you, if circumstances warrant. 
The legality of this practice is under challenge in the courts. A 
Texas case has gone as high as the U.S. Supreme Court, which sent 
it back to a district court for more factual findings. That's "your 
money." Lauren Thierry, "CNN Financial News," New York.
