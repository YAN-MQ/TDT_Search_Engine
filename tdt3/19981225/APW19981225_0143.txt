Turkish Cypriots have demanded increased security measures at a U.N. 
buffer zone after shots were fired across the line separating the 
Turkish and Greek Cypriot sectors, news reports said Friday. Assailants 
fired 10 shots at Turkish Cypriot guards late Thursday at Aheridu 
(known as Guvercinlik in Turkish), near the port of Famagusta, the 
Turkish Cypriot news agency, said. The guards fired two shots in retaliation. 
There were no injuries. Thursday's shooting was the fourth in a string 
of similar shooting incidents over the past few months at the U.N.-patrolled 
buffer zone that separates the Turkish and Greek communities. ``Such 
attacks and provocation, which are beginning to test the limits of 
our patience and tolerance, could lead to sad results,'' said a statement 
issued by Turkish Cypriot security forces. The statement said officials 
had formally complained to U.N. and British forces, demanding ``more 
efficient'' security measures at the 180-kilometer (113-mile) zone. 
Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in forces following 
a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece. Turkey maintains 
35,000 troops in the north, some of which are positioned only yards 
away from Greek Cypriot troops.
