Iraq's official newspaper says Baghdad might agree to have its weapons 
programs electronically monitored. If U.N. sanctions are lifted first. 
The Althwara newspaper, which reflects the policy of the ruling Baath 
party, said Friday after sanctions are lifted, Iraq could discuss 
continuing surveillance by cameras and other means. Iraqi officials 
say U.N. weapons inspectors can never return because of last week's 
U.S. and British airstrikes.
