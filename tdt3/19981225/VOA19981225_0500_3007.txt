One area of the U.S. economy that's doing very well is the music industry. 
Sales of c.d.'s and other recordings made strong gains in 1998. VOA's 
Martin Bush reports from New York. Sales of recordings here in the 
United States are expected to jump almost 10 percent this year. To 
a total of 710 million. That follows two years of only modest gains. 
Topping the charts is the soundtrack of the hit movie, "Titanic." 
Featuring Celine Dion singing "My Heart Will Go On." Marsha Apple 
is a vice-president of Sam Goody, the largest American chain of record 
stores. She says there's a major reason for the increase in record 
sales this year. The music-buying public is still largely a youth 
public. But one thing that's true, is that for the first time we did 
see a resurgence of shopping by teenage girls. They entered the domain 
of the music retailer, and they really embraced music. Not only with 
rap and other kinds of music, but also the music being produced by 
young women in their own age group. Like Alanis Morrisette. So they 
were huge purchasers. "Titanic" was just something that sailed away 
with all this. It really took our breath away. I think there has been 
an acceptance of rap, for a lot of reasons. One of which is the movement 
away from gansta rap to a more positive melodic rap. Marsha Apple 
says rap music gained a wider acceptance among teenagers and pre-teenagers 
in 1998. Because the music allows them to communicate with what she 
calls: "an urban sensibility." Sales of rhythm and blues recordings 
continued to lead the field. Alternative rock came next. Followed 
by rap, and county music. Sony Music was the largest seller among 
the American record companies this year. Moving more than 17 percent 
of all recordings purchased. As to the old question, what makes a 
song a hit, or a style a hit? Sam Goody executive Marsha Apple says 
you never know. The next megahit could come from the new label that's 
recording in the garage down the street. This is Martin Bush, VOA 
News, New York.
