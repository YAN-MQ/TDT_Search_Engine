A man stabbed to death his wife and three young children Christmas 
morning, then set fire to their home and fled, police said. Within 
hours, the man was killed in a head-on car crash. Dutch television 
quoted neighbors as saying the couple had a terrible fight before 
flames burst from the house in this university town in the central 
Netherlands, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Amsterdam. 
Firefighters responding to the blaze made the grisly discovery of 
the charred bodies of the children, ages 3, 7 and 11, and their mother, 
34. Their names were not released in line with Dutch privacy laws. 
TV reports said the woman's husband, 37, was killed in a morning crash 
on a nearby highway not long after firefighters were called to the 
home. The other driver involved in the accident, 33, was seriously 
injured. Authorities said the killer, who used a kitchen knife in 
the slayings, apparently set fire to the house to cover his tracks. 
They would not say whether his death was a suicide. It was the second 
holiday tragedy to strike Wageningen in less than a year. Last New 
Year's Eve, three people were shot dead at a party in a fight among 
guests.
