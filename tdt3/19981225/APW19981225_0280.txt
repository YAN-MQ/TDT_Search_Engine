Boris Yeltsin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday 
agreed to take moves to merge the two former Soviet republics into 
a single state as early as next year. Yeltsin and Lukashenko agreed 
to put the proposed merger to public discussion by the middle of next 
year. Without waiting for popular approval, they would also move early 
next year to introduce a single currency and harmonize taxes. ``We 
are now calling for merging our nations in one union state,'' Yeltsin 
said at a news conference after the signing. ``We can be proud of 
such work.'' ``God help us to enter the next millennium as a single 
state,'' Lukashenko said. Yeltsin, plagued by poor health in recent 
years, appeared tired at the meeting, although he spoke clearly and 
strongly. At one point, he struggled to get up from a chair and had 
to be helped by an aide. The authoritarian Lukashenko, an admirer 
of the Soviet Union, has long pushed for uniting his nation of 10 
million people with Russia's 147 million people. In 1996, he and Yeltsin 
signed a union agreement, boosting political, economic and military 
ties between the two nations, but stopping short of creating one state. 
The two leaders have long pledged to take further integration steps, 
but had done little. It remains unclear whether today's agreements 
would be implemented, as many Russian politicians oppose a merger. 
Russian news reports said the proposed merger would be put to a plebiscite, 
but the text of the statement signed by Yeltsin and Lukashenko called 
only for ``public discussion,'' a vague formula that doesn't necessarily 
mean a referendum. Yeltsin appeared to cast doubt on a referendum. 
``The referendum issue may arise, or it may not,'' he said. ``If it 
arises, we must somehow solve it.'' Other Russian top officials quickly 
said there is no immediate plan to merge the two nation's armed forces 
or pool the government coffers. Lukashenko wants a merger to solve 
Belarus' economic problems that have already led to food rationing 
in some regions. The Belarusian economy is one of the most unreformed 
in the former Soviet Union, with virtually all assets and markets 
under government control. In an immediate step to ease Belarusian 
economic woes, Yeltsin and Lukashenko signed a document to allow Russian 
and Belarusian companies to import goods from each other at domestic 
prices. The agreement is crucial for Belarus, which relies on Russia's 
energy resources and has run up a huge debt. Domestic prices for Russia's 
oil and natural gas are still far lower than the world market price. 
Apart from the economic interests, many politicians in both nations 
believe that the main motive behind Lukashenko's drive for union is 
his ambition to run for the Russian presidency. Lukashenko has dodged 
questions about his possible ambitions. ``Some believe that Lukashenko 
wouldn't mind becoming the Russian leader, and many Russians wouldn't 
like that,'' Yegor Stroyev, the speaker of the Russian parliament's 
upper house said in an interview published Friday in the daily Novye 
Izvestia. Russian liberals and the West assail Lukashenko for his 
crackdown on the opposition and the independent media. Russian Communists 
and other hardliners publicly hail the proposed merger, but tacitly 
oppose it, fearing that the assertive Belarusian president would push 
them to the sidelines if he joins Russia's presidential race. The 
cash-strapped Russian government, struggling with the worst economic 
crisis since the Soviet collapse, has been lukewarm on the merger 
with even poorer Belarus.
