National Football League quarterback Randall Cunningham has enjoyed 
a renaissance in his career this season with the Minnesota Vikings. 
At 14 and one, the team has the best record in the NFL, heading into 
the final weekend of the regular season. And the Vikings have rewarded 
the 34 year old Cunningham's contribution with a five year contract 
extension. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. But Cunningham will 
be paid as a starter next season instead as a backup behind the now-injured 
Brad Johnson. Cunningham says he has not completely felt the impact 
of his good fortune. It's hit me, but it hasn't hit me where I'm going 
to start crying or anything yet. But I'm sure that when I get home 
with my family, and we sit down and we start dwelling on it a little 
bit more. I'll show a whole bunch more appreciation for it. The Vikings 
not only won the NFC Central Division title with ease, but the team 
will have a first round play-off by an home field advantage throughout 
the post season.
