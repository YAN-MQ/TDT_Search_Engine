Many toymakers are no longer just filling their plush animals with 
stuffing. They're adding electronics and robotics. Dennis Michael 
reports. 1998 will undoubtedly go down as "the year of the furby" 
when speaking of the hot Christmas toys of the past. Still in the 
dark about what that is? Well, imagine a tribble, a mogwai and a tomagotchi 
thrown into a genetic blender, and you get a furby, the next evolutionary 
step for the virtual pet. Toy giant Mattel has a trio of futuristic 
playthings out now. The Barbie photo designer digital camera is a 
real digital camera. The fun of it is that it works with the Barbie 
photo designer CD-rom. So for the first time ever, girls enter the 
world of Barbie on their computers. This is not your father's hot 
wheels. Its high-tech standard feature -- a virtual pet-like interface 
gives access to the tiny onboard computer. This computer allows you 
to check speeds, count laps, tells you how many miles you traveled, 
do a lot of fun interactive things like never before. Sticker price, 
about $12. Dennis, welcome to the hundred-acre wood. Christopher Robin 
would love this! "My interactive Pooh" is a CD-rom-based toy that 
may help him shed the moniker of "bear of very little brain." My interactive 
Pooh is a personalized toy. He will actually say a child's name. You 
can play with Pooh on the computer, and you can download information 
and play with him away from the computer. There are so many things 
we can do. Skeptical parents might wonder, do these microchipped marvels 
take away from a child's own imagination? That technology brings out 
imagination to a brand-new height and really allows them to role-play 
like never before. With toys this smart, Santa doesn't have to slide 
down the chimney any more -- now, he downloads. Dennis Michael, "CNN 
Entertainment News," Hollywood.
