The Muslim militant Osama Bin Laden has urged Muslims to kill Americans 
and Britons for supporting their armed forces' attacks on Iraq, according 
to an interview with an Arabic newspaper. ``The British and the American 
people loudly declared their support for their leaders' decision to 
attack Iraq,'' Bin Laden said in Friday's edition of the newspaper 
Asharq Al-Awsat. This made it ``the duty of Muslims to confront, fight 
and kill (Britons and Americans),'' Bin Laden said. ``And anything 
that can be taken from them by force is the rightful prize of Muslims.'' 
The United States and Britain carried out airstrikes on Iraqi military 
and communications sites Dec. 16-19 to punish Baghdad for its alleged 
obstruction of U.N. inspectors seeking evidence of its weapons of 
mass destruction. The London-published newspaper said the interview 
with Bin Laden was conducted in the mountains of Helmand province, 
southern Afghanistan. Washington accuses Bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, 
of masterminding the twin bombing of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania 
and Kenya on Aug. 7. The blasts killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. 
Thirteen days later the United States blasted Bin Laden's camps in 
Afghanistan with cruise missiles. Bin Laden denied any involvement 
in the embassy bombings, but expressed his ``admiration and support'' 
for the attackers. After the United States attacked Bin Laden's camps, 
the Taliban _ the militia that controls 90 percent of Afghanistan 
_ announced that it had imposed restrictions on Bin Laden, including 
barring him from giving press interviews. Bin Laden told Asharq Al-Awsat 
that while the Taliban had prohibited him from carrying out attacks 
on foreign countries, he continues to ``guide (Muslims) toward holy 
war against Jews and Christians. This is a duty.'' The interview was 
the second to be published with Bin Laden in two days. It was not 
immediately clear whether he was defying the Taliban's restrictions 
or whether they had been eased. A Taliban spokesman could not be reached 
for comment. A businessman who made a fortune in construction, Bin 
Laden first went to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight against Soviet 
occupation.
