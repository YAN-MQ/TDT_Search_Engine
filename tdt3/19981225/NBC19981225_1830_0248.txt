Holiday caroling aboard the "USS Carl vinson," 5,000 men and women 
facing another challenge -- Christmas halfway around the world, a 
Long way from home. Petty officer Shelby cornelius, after 12 years 
in the Navy, spending his first Christmas at sea without his family. 
I've got fond memories of what's going on at home right now. It can 
be a very low time for others. So we kind of hold on to each other 
and pick each other up. And take care of each other. You have to. 
Memories from Washington state, his wife Patricia, at church with 
her parents this year instead of with her husband, missing him even 
more because she's pregnant with their first child. It's been really 
hard having him gone for the holidays. It's disappointing. It's frustrating. 
It's just not the same without him here. Aboard ship, cornelius, usually 
handles bombs and weapons. Now he's sorting mail, tons of holiday 
packages, looking for something from his wife. You know that the effort 
and the love was there. And that's what was sent. The men and women 
aboard the "Carl vinson" knew they'd be away for the holidays. They've 
just started a long six-month assignment at sea. This carrier will 
begin the new year here in the Persian gulf, America's frontline fire 
power, ready in case of more problems with Iraq. The ship's admiral 
holds a Christmas eve night rally. But with U.S. forces on high alert, 
the troops get just half a day off. I think we have a confused state 
of affairs right now following the strikes that occurred in Iraq. 
And I don't think anyone is terribly clear on where this is going 
to go right now. But for now, a brief pause to celebrate, a special 
guest borrows an F-18 for the night, with 57,000 pounds of presents. 
And for cornelius, a quiet Christmas morning, with gifts from home. 
It's my second Harley. He hopes for Christmas next year with his wife 
and a newborn child. But now though, he's with 275,000 other Americans 
serving aboard, answering the call of duty. Ron Allen, NBC news, aboard 
the "USS Carl vinson."
