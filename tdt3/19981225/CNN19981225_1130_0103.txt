President Clinton plans to spend this Christmas day with family and 
friends at the White House. Last night, Mr. Clinton completed some 
last-minute shopping, went to several parties and attended church 
at the national Cathedral. Hopefully, he worked up an appetite, because 
today's celebration includes a Christmas banquet. Among the first 
family's culinary selections -- Turkey and country ham, stuffing, 
vegetables, salad, mashed potatoes, sweet potato casserole and three 
kinds of Pie.
