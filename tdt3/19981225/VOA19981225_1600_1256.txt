The final playoff berth in the NFL is up for grabs Sunday. With the 
Arizona Cardinals, New York Giants, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers vying 
for the spot. The Cardinals play the San Diego Chargers and a win 
will give Arizona a berth in the playoffs. Cards quarterback Jake 
Plummer says he wants to limit the Chargers' defense. They're very 
athletic. They're very fast. They bring up -- they play a foul defense 
that makes you make a quick decision, sometimes a bad decision. And 
if I can limit those out there on Sunday, then we have a good chance 
of winning. But giving their defense a chance to get their hand on 
the ball is not good for the tournament of points if they do. The 
Buccaneers, meanwhile, take on Cincinnati. And need the Cardinals 
and Giants to lose to make the finals of the playoffs. The Giants 
take on the Philadelphia Eagles in a late game. New York needs to 
win and have the Cardinals lose to make the post-season. Week 17 gets 
underway Saturday, with two meaningless games. The Minnesota Vikings 
will become the third team in NFL history with 15 wins if they beat 
Tennessee. Oilers' coach Jeff Fischer says his defense will try to 
shut down the Vikings' attack. Our secondary's looking for the challenge. 
Our defensive front seven is expecting a big physical ballgame this 
weekend. They've got a lot to prove. Nightmare's not the word. The 
challenge, I think, is more appropriate. But you have to do one thing, 
and that's try to minimize the games and not give up the big plays. 
Also Saturday, the Oakland Raiders take on their traditional rivals, 
the Kansas City Chiefs.
