Our Special Christmas Day edition of The World continues on PRI, Public 
Radio International. Coming on the World, our special archive edition 
continues with some highlights from this past years programs. Madison 
Avenue learns how to speak Espanol and Canadian comics reveal how 
they really feel. Wouldn't it be great if the United States of America
