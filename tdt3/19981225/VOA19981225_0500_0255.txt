There were traditional Christmas Eve observances Thursday, in Bethlehem, 
the historic birthplace of Jesus. However, as VOA's David Gullis reports, 
tourism is down in the Palestinian rural West Bank town. The result 
of Middle East trouble including the recent Gulf crisis. The sounds 
of church bells mixed with the Call to the Faithful for La Mosque 
in Bethlehem, as the city began its Christmas Eve observance with 
a procession to the Church of the Nativity. Led by the Latin patriarch 
of Jerusalem. It is a lean year for tourism here. With Christian pilgrims 
and other visitors deterred by days of Israeli-Palestinian clashes 
on the edge of Bethlehem. And the conflict in the Gulf which prompted 
several countries to issue Middle East travel advisories. Bethlehem 
visits are further complicated this year by a massive construction 
project. As Bethlehem undergoes a makeover in advance of millennium 
celebrations starting next year. Officials are hoping to attract two 
million visitors beginning next Christmas, for a 15 month celebration. 
Of the 2,000th anniversary of the Christian era. David Gullis, VOA 
News, Bethlehem.
