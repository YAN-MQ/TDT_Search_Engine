Four Germans abducted 2 1/2 weeks ago got chocolates, cigarettes and 
mineral water for Christmas but weren't allowed to call their families, 
Yemeni tribesmen said Friday. The tribesmen delivered the presents 
from the German Embassy in the Yemeni capital, San`a, to the hostages. 
The Germans _ three women and a man _ spent ``a silent and boring'' 
Christmas Eve and are ``looking forward to the day of their release,'' 
said one of the tribesmen, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
They are only allowed to walk for 45 minutes a day accompanied by 
armed men, he said. The Germans were abducted Dec. 7 by gunmen from 
the Bani Dhabyan tribe and taken to Marib province, 170 kilometers 
(105 miles) northeast of San`a. The Bani Dhabyan are asking the government 
for more schools, hospitals, telephone lines and roads in their poor 
province. A Yemeni newspaper identified the hostages as Norbert Degen, 
Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The names have not 
been confirmed by the German Embassy. On Sunday, a cardiologist was 
dispatched to examine one of the women who was suffering from blood 
pressure. Her identity was not revealed.
