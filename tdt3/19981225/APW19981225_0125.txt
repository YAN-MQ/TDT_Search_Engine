Three bodies in green military uniforms found near the coast of Japan 
early Friday appear to have been at sea too long to be crewmen from 
a North Korean spy boat sunk by South Korea last week, police said. 
The bodies were spotted floating near a beach in the town of Takahama 
at around 7:40 a.m. Friday (2340 GMT Thursday), said a spokesman for 
the Fukui prefectural police. All three were badly decomposed, which 
indicated they had been in the Sea of Japan for much longer than one 
week, said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. That 
appeared to make it unlikely the bodies were from a North Korean vessel 
sunk by South Korean ships on Dec. 18 in waters between the Korean 
peninsula and Japan, he said. The bodies were tied with rope to a 
small wooden raft. One had what appeared to be a star-shaped North 
Korean insignia of rank attached to a shirt collar, he said. Autopsies 
were planned to determine the cause of death, the officer said. Takahama, 
located about 430 kilometers (267 miles) west of Tokyo, is a fishing 
town facing the Sea of Japan near where the North Korean vessel was 
sunk. South Korean navy ships have been scouring the area since the 
sinking, looking for debris and other North Korean vessels. They have 
found the body of one of the vessel's crew but said three more people 
were sighted on the boat before it went down. South Korean officials 
have said the vessel, described as a fast, low-profile boat used to 
land or pick up spies, was believed to be on an espionage mission.
