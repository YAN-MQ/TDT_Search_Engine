For many people, having a winter vacation on the ski slopes or basking 
in the sun without breaking the bank is a dream come true. One way 
to do that, seek out travel rebaters. Sasha Salama has our story. 
If you know where, when and how you want to travel, a rebater might 
be able to save you money on your next trip. Rebaters are basically 
low-cost travel agencies that operate at such a low cost that they 
are able to split some of the commission that they get with their 
customers. Here's how it works. Just about every published air fare, 
cruise or travel package price includes a sales commission. You do 
the research on the trip, the rebater books it and gives you back 
all or part of that commission. Anywhere between 2% and 12% of the 
ticket price, minus a $25 transaction fee. It's the reward for doing 
the helping us do the research which keeps our costs down here in 
the office. Salt lakes at the to Vegas. Chicago based travel avenue 
has a tiered pricing system. They'll book you an $1100 flight and 
send you back about $50. Doesn't sound like much, but if two people 
book a cruise for $6,000 each, travel avenue will rebate you, after 
fees, $1150. Florida-based rebater all-American travel club takes 
a simple approach, giving back a flat 8% for any flight or cruise. 
International travelers with big ticket fares benefit the most from 
rebaters, as well as people who know where they want to go. I make 
my own plans, and therefore it makes sense to go to an agency that 
is going to give you a rebate. Since I don't need them for information 
or advice. That's your money, Sasha Salama for "CNN Financial News,"
