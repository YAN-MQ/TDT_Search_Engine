Ray Freeman brought us a nice story about American performers who 
were born on Christmas Day. Sadly, however, there was a very prominent 
American performer who died on Christmas Day, three years ago. It 
was actor, singer, television star Dean Martin. It was a long and 
diverse career he had. He was a solo singer of course, at first. One 
of the young crooners. Then he teamed up with comedian Jerry Lewis 
in 1946. And with a lot of singing and silliness, the pair really 
became a hit on stage and movies, on radio and TV. They broke up 10 
years later in '56. And then Martin went on to a career of his own. 
For a while there in the mid-60's, he was really one of the superstars 
on the scene. Wouldn't you say, Les? He had a weekly television variety 
series, and did a lot of films at that time too. Was a romantic lead, 
a crooner. But in the last years of his life, he was said to be despondent 
over the death of his son. Actor and singer Dean Paul Martin, who 
was killed in a 1987 plane crash. Dean Martin was 78 years old when 
he died in Beverly Hills, California on December 25, 1995.
