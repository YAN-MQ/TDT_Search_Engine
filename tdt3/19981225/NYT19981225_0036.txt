Probably no priest or pastor outside Iraq opened a Christmas sermon 
on Friday the way the Rev. Gabriel Marie did at the Church of Our 
Lady of Assumption here. ``Thanks be to God that we have survived 
the bombing,'' Marie told Catholic parishioners who filled his church 
to overflowing for two Masses on Friday morning. He went on to lament 
modern technology that allows warriors ``to push a button on a computer 
and kill people,'' and said it was the duty of all Christians ``to 
build a new world full of peace.'' As Iraqi Christians gathered for 
Christmas services Friday, the sounds of the U.S. and British bombing 
raids last week were still echoing in their heads. Their spiritual 
leaders used the occasion to remind them that, as Marie said, ``no 
bomb is powerful enough to kill the spirit of Christianity.'' Parishioners 
at Our Lady of Assumption joined loudly in singing hymns, and listened 
attentively to Bible readings that told the age-old story of the Nativity. 
As they were filing out into the midday sunshine, the choir of about 
35 young people, evidently unable to restrain their exuberance, broke 
spontaneously into an Arabic-language version of ``Jingle Bells.'' 
When it was finished, members of the choir hugged and kissed one another. 
``Because of Christmas, I am very happy,'' said Anman George, 19, 
who was among the most enthusiastic singers. ``We believe in Jesus, 
and that his spirit will prevail to resolve these difficulties. His 
teachings are the way to peace in this country.'' Christians who attended 
Catholic and Protestant services in Baghdad on Friday said in interviews 
that they live and worship freely here. The Chaldean Catholic community, 
by far the largest Christian denomination in Iraq, has roots in the 
earliest days of Christianity and is widely accepted as part of this 
country's spiritual heritage. Perhaps its most prominent member is 
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. ``Some Muslims with backward minds 
don't like Christians,'' said Wasan Wadia, 28, who attended a Catholic 
Mass with her family on Friday. ``But most of them, especially the 
more educated, are friendly to us or even envy us, because our tradition 
is very open-minded. They like talking and mixing with us.'' As recently 
as 20 years ago, Christians constituted nearly 10 percent of the Iraqi 
population. Many worked for foreign companies, however, and began 
emigrating in the 1980s as the companies shut down after the outbreak 
of war with Iran. Today they make up about 6 percent of the country's 
22 million people. Iraq's Christian academies, run by Jesuits and 
Presbyterians from the United States, were shut down when the government 
expelled most foreign missionaries in the late 1960s. Many young Christians 
now attend selected public schools where the history of Christianity 
is taught alongside that of Islam. Their community is known as highly 
educated and relatively prosperous. Leaders of Christian denominations 
here have issued statements condemning last week's bombing and the 
economic sanctions that the United Nations imposed on Iraq after the 
invasion of Kuwait eight years ago. The bombing and sanctions are 
intended to force changes in the Iraqi government and curb what the 
United States describes as Iraq's threat to neighboring countries. 
As a sign of the friendly ties between the government and Christian 
denominations here, Minister of Religious Affairs Abdul-Munim Ahmad 
Salih visited several churches on Friday. At the Baghdad National 
Presbyterian Church, founded by American missionaries in the 19th 
century, he told the parish council that Christians ``are not a minority, 
but an integral part of our nation.'' The Presbyterian pastor, the 
Rev. Ikram Ibrahim, referred obliquely to the country's troubles in 
his sermon Friday. ``Jesus, we are praying to you,'' he said. ``You 
are the prince of peace, and you are the one who can lift the sanctions 
from our country.'' Later the chairman of the parish council, Georges 
Hormis Sada, said Iraqi Christians share the widespread anger and 
puzzlement here over the West's hostility to their country. Sada is 
a retired military officer who fondly recalls his two years of pilot 
training at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas during the 1960s, when 
Iraqi-American relations were still friendly. ``We don't say anything 
about politics, but when we see aggression against children, women 
and old people, we think this should not be,'' he said. ``We don't 
think Jesus would like it. We feel sad that Christian countries are 
doing this to us. Christians should be able to solve these problems 
in a different way.'' Sada said the council had decided to cancel 
traditional church parties celebrating Christmas and New Year. There 
will be prayer services instead. ``You can't be very happy when people 
are being killed, when people are depressed and suffering,'' he said. 
``How can you have parties and sing and dance? We feel we should share 
the sadness of our people, and only worship.''
