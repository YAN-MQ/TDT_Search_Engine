There is plenty of college football to talk about. With two bowls 
set to kick off on this Christmas day. The inaugural oahu bowl will 
match up air force and Washington in the nightcap of a double dip 
from Hawaii. With Oregon and Colorado squaring off in the Jeep aloha 
bowl. Everybody's a little upset. Opportunity to play Colorado was 
going to be a tough game, in Hawaii on christmas day should be, you 
know blessing in disguise for our program. We knew it was either going 
to be the holiday bowl or aloha bowl. Their choice between San Diego 
and Honolulu? It's a dirty job but somebody's got to do it.
