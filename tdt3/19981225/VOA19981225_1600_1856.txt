Three men have ended their quest to make the first around-the-world 
balloon flight. British tycoon Richard Branson, his crewmates: American 
Steve Fawcett and Swede Teralin Strand were rescued off the coast 
of Hawaii Friday. Here is Coast Guard Lieutenant Patrick Baker. All 
three occupants were picked up by a Coast Guard helicopters. And they're 
wet, but they're in good shape. The capsule carrying the disappointed 
crew splashed down off the northern point of Hawaii's Oahu Island. 
Project manager Mike Hendrichs says the weather was the problem. That 
is, I'm afraid the fickleness of the weather. It's all a question 
of the luck you need to complete these projects. The three began their 
journey one week ago, in Morocco.
