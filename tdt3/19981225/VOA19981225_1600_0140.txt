Amid continuing tension in Sierra Leone's capitol, the British government 
has evacuated most of its nationals from the country. Two British 
Royal Air Force transport planes began ferrying British and other 
foreigners out of the capitol, Freetown, on Thursday. As VOA's John 
Pitman reports from our West Africa Bureau. London says the evacuation 
is a precautionary measure. Two British Royal Air Force C 1-30 transport 
planes were used to evacuate the foreigners to Dakar, the capitol 
of Senegal. Among those evacuated were most of the British high commissioned 
staff. As well as up to 80 British, European, and North American civilians. 
The U.S. government has also suspended operations at its embassy. 
And has ordered all U.S. government staff to leave Sierra Leone. The 
British evacuation effort has raised some eyebrows in the Nigerian-led 
in defending Freetown. The ECOMOG Commander, Nigerian General Timothy 
Shelpidi has told the Reuters news agency that he believes the international 
community should not be abandoning Sierra Leone. For its part, London 
says the evacuation should not be interpreted as a lessening of Britain's 
support for Sierra Leone's elected government. John Pitman, VOA News, 
West Africa Bureau.
