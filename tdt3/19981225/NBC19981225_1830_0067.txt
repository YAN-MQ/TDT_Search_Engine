Good evening and thanks for joining us on this Christmas night, 1998. 
I'm Len Cannon in for Tom Brokaw. All across the country and around 
the world, it is a night to gather with family and friends. And it 
has been as always a day of traditions from Rome, where Pope John 
paul II warned against indifference to hate and violence, to here 
at home where millions of Americans spent their holiday helping the 
less fortunate. And then there are thousands of U.S. troops celebrating 
far from home and loved ones. We have three reports for you tonight, 
beginning with NBC's Kelly o'Donnell. Making the last of his appointed 
rounds, Santa delivers presents in Memphis today. ho, ho, ho, ho. 
Instead of a reindeer-driven sleigh in the dark of night, the U.S. 
postal service gives Mr. claus a lift. On this day of giving, 40,000 
holiday meals served today in Atlanta, helping those who most need 
a warm dinner and friendship. I love to help. If I can be of service 
to anyone, I'll be there. In southern California, at the long beach 
memorial medical center, 6-year-old karel spak keeps up her 30-year 
tradition, providing teddy bears for sick children. By making others 
happy, perhaps just a little happiness to someone else, brings more 
happiness to me. The best gift for families of U.S. troops on duty 
in the Persian gulf -- a ticket home, two B-1 bomber crews arriving 
this Christmas day at dyess air force base in Texas. But for millions 
of Americans, Christmas is another day on the job. A survey done by 
the national bureau of affairs finds two out of five companies have 
at least some of their employees working today. You're going to city 
hall tonight. Police officers On duty, New York emergency crews repairing 
downed power lines, and a bagel and coffee shop fills orders all day. 
For the first time in 20 years, a white Christmas in New York City. 
Just enough snow dusts central park to paint a Christmas card scene. 
For countless Americans, the true spirit of this day is found at church. 
In Rome, Pope John Paul II delivers his Christmas message in 50 languages. 
May the joy of Christmas and the peace be in your hearts forever. 
For many, the joy of Christmas is most easily seen in children -- 
all their anticipation, all their parents' effort finally realized. 
And the memory of Christmas '98, a family treasure for years to come. 
Kelly O'Donnell, NBC news, Los Angeles.
