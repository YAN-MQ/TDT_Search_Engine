France has signed a three-year agreement with Laos to provide 30 million 
francs (dlrs 5.6 million) for rural development in the Southeast Asian 
nation, the official Laotian news agency, KPL, reported Friday. The 
aid will be used for development projects in four southern districts 
of Sayaboury province and to help promote market-oriented production, 
KPL reported. The agreement was signed Wednesday by Thonphachanh Sonnasinh, 
director of the Laotian foreign economic cooperation department, and 
Gerard Larose, director of the French agency for development for Laos. 
The landlocked, mountainous country of 4.7 million people, a former 
French colony, is one of the world's poorest nations. France is a 
major aid provider. The agreement was signed during the recent visit 
of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former U.N. secretary general who now 
heads the International Francophone Organization promoting the French 
language.
