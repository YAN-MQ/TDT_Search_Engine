In U.S. College Football, the second of 23 post-season bowl games 
was played Wednesday night outside of Detroit. A gamed dubbed "The 
Motor City Bowl." Marshall defeated Louisville: 48 to 29 in a high 
scoring contest that featured a couple of top quarterbacks. Marshall's 
Chad Pennington won the battle, throwing for 411 yards and four touchdowns. 
His team, which had lost only one of 12 games during the regular season, 
scored on eight of its final 10 possessions. Louisville quarterback 
Chris Redman completed 35 of 54 passes for 336 yards and one touchdown. 
Louisville completes its season with seven wins and five losses. But 
that's a huge turnaround from last year's record of just one win and 
10 losses. The Aloha Bowl and the Oahu Bowl. In the Aloha Bowl, number 
21-ranked Oregon takes on the Colorado Buffaloes. Meanwhile, in the 
Oahu Bowl, the Western Athletic Conference Champion Air Force Academy 
takes on Washington. The Bowl season continues through January 4, 
when Florida State and Tennessee will play for the national championship 
in the Fiesta Bowl.
