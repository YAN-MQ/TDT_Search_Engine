With President Clinton's political future on the line, will the Senate 
in fact prove to be a more friendly body than the house? As Chris 
black reports, there appears to be some movement in the Senate. While 
President Clinton received news at the White House news of two senators 
collaborating on a proposal one to short circuit a trial. CNN has 
learned that Moynihan and Byrd are trying to craft a resolution that 
would reprimand Mr. Clinton for his behavior. They are two of the 
old Bulls of the Senate. They have a combined more than 60 years in 
the United States than the old guard. They are seasoned, veterans 
and have seen it all. They have a great deal of credibility and that 
makes any proposal that they author immediately important. The proposal 
is one of several back-channel efforts under way in the Senate to 
bring a speedy end to the inquiry. The White House officials welcome 
the development because President Clinton has said he would accept 
censure, but only on the right terms. White House officials had been 
concerned that Moynihan and Byrd might raise constitutional objections 
to any censure proposal. Both lawmakers are strict interpreters of 
the constitution and some scholars have said that the constitution 
may not allow Congress to censure any president and cut off a Senate 
impeachment trial. Byrd raised the possibility of a censure alternative 
earlier this week, but also told the White House not to interfere 
with Senate deliberations. Moynihan was one of the first democrats 
to criticize the president for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
Moynihan, who is retiring at the end of his term, hinted back in September 
he saw a possible way to deal with the president's scandal. If justice 
is done with sufficient regularity and moderation, the heavens need 
not fall. a Senate source says the two senior lawmakers hope to write 
a Resolution that will pass constitutional Muster and attract republican 
support. For the White House, the Moynihan/Byrd collaboration is one 
more sign of growing momentum for -- a compromise. Chris black, CNN,
