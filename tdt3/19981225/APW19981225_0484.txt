Amid a growing British-led evacuation effort in Sierra Leone, the 
West African country's feared rebel alliance on Friday boasted key 
battlefield gains and threatened to storm the capital on New Year's 
Day. Sam Bockarie, a rebel general known as ``Maskita (Mosquito)'' 
by his Revolutionary United Front, said the renegades had captured 
the provincial town of Makeni, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest 
of Freetown and were battling for Kenema, a diamond-mining town about 
100 kilometers (60 miles) to the southwest. Rebels also captured a 
barracks used by the Nigerian-led West African ECOMOG intervention 
force defending Sierra Leone's government about five miles (eight 
kilometers) outside Freetown, Bockarie told The Associated Press in 
a satellite telephone interview from an undisclosed location. His 
claims could not be immediately confirmed and neither government or 
ECOMOG spokesmen were available for immediate comment. ``We are going 
to march into Freetown on New Year's Day unless the government agrees 
to our terms,'' Bockarie said. ``We have the will and the way.'' He 
added that the rebels had captured an undisclosed number of Nigerian 
soldiers as well as large quantities of light and heavy weaponry from 
ECOMOG. The rebel threat followed the evacuation of 81 British and 
European citizens, including nine Italian priests in two British air 
force transport planes from Lungi Airport outside of Freetown on Thursday. 
Another 150 Britons were expected to be airlifted out, said a British 
High Commission official in Freetown on Friday on condition of anonymity. 
Essential British embassy staff remained in Sierra Leone, officials 
said. About 50 people mostly British, were expected to arrive in London 
in the second wave of the airlift on a British plane later Friday 
the night, the Press Association of Britain meanwhile reported. ``We 
are doing all we can to protect the interests of British people in 
Sierra Leone,'' British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd said in 
London. In a state radio broadcast, President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's 
government condemned the airlift, saying it played into the hands 
of the rebels who he said wanted to spread panic. But Lloyd said the 
evacuation did not affect British support for Sierra Leone's government. 
Britain is Sierra Leone's former colonial ruler and remains the largest 
diplomatic presence in the country. Pickup 10th graf pvs. `The rebels
