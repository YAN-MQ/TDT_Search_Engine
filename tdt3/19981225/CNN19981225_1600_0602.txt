This is a special Christmas for one teenager who has fought a six-year 
battle to stay alive. Holly Firfer has the story. His ordeal began 
Christmas eve, 1992. Danny, then 8 years old, complained of a stomach 
ache, then fainted. His family rushed him to the emergency room, where 
doctors found his bowel had twisted, cutting off the blood supply, 
killing his small intestine. This began a frantic spiral of events. 
While waiting on a organ transplant list, Danny's liver, pancreas 
and stomach failed. He moved from state to state hoping to find a 
suitable donor for now four new organs. It was in Miami where he received 
his first multiple organ transplant which his body violently rejected. 
It took two more multiple organ transplants, before doctors found 
a match that would save his life. With a brief stop over in Pittsburgh 
for rehabilitation, Danny's journey would come to an end here at home. 
I feel great. I mean, I never felt better. I feel like a new person. 
After a six-year battle to stay alive, Danny canal is home with his 
family for the holidays. I am able to do things that I wasn't able 
to do before the transplant and while I was in the hospital. I am 
able to sleep in my own bed again and just, I mean, even enjoying 
a Simple night of watching TV with my family. To be able to be back 
as a family, to go out and do some shopping and not to have some of 
these worries, you know, behind us, it's just a -- it's a Great feeling. 
Although Danny will be on medication the rest of his life, his prognosis 
is good. This boy who has fueled controversy over organ transplantation 
and faced death many times wants to get on with his life and just 
be a normal teenager. And taking a look at his bedroom and meeting 
his sister, it looks like he's succeeding. I'm telling, if I can get 
up! Being away from my family during the whole ordeal was pretty hard, 
but, I mean, now that we are all back together things are much better. 
Christmas at the canal home, 1998. Holly Firfer, CNN.
