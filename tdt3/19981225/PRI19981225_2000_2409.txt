For our geography quiz for this Christmas Day, we travel to the eastern 
most island in the greater Antilles where Christmas is synonymous 
with food, rivalry, and song. In fact, one of the most popular holiday 
traditions here is Parada Davagania. Groups of revelers go door-to-door 
singing Christmas carols adding more people to group with every stop. 
Another holiday tradition here is called Asalto, or Assalt. And it's 
not quite so amiable. An Asalto is when somebody comes knocking on 
your door in the middle of the night and according to tradition, you've 
got no choice but to offer your visitor something to eat and little 
holiday cheer. But then, Christmas comes only once a year. Those offerings 
may include some perstilies, a plant wrapped meat filled turnover, 
or some meros kapola, a rice and chicken. To wash it all down, there's 
Cotito. It's a highly alcoholic brew similar to egg nog, but a little 
bit more potent. And last but not least, there's asopol, the traditional 
chicken soup. So, where are we on this Christmas Day? Stay tuned we'll 
being the answer and the recipe for that soup to warm your soul in 
just a few minutes.
