NBC news "in depth" tonight -- 1998, a year of a booming stock market 
and low unemployment in this country. Which is why for the thousands 
of Americans who've been laid off in the past few weeks, facing the 
holiday season without a job is even more depressing. NBC chief financial 
correspondent Mike Jensen has the story, in our "in depth" report. 
For Rick brown and his family, this is their worst Christmas in years. 
After working 21 years at a box factory in Ohio making $15 an hour, 
Rick got the word this month that the plant is closing down. The timing 
was terrible. The way it was handled was terrible. To find out that 
he was going to lose his job right before the holidays was just devastating. 
Rick brown is one of more than 600,000 workers who got layoff notices 
this year, a new record for the '90s. And something else is new. More 
and more of those layoffs are coming in the month of December. That's 
something companies almost never used to do. You used to expect Christmas 
bonuses. Today you're more worried about whether you're going to get 
a pink slip. December 1st -- Boeing announces 20,000 job cuts. December 
14th -- RJR Nabisco cuts 4,700 jobs. The next day, Citigroup announces 
10,400 job cuts. Graef Crystal is an expert on the compensation and 
motivation of top executives. Their first thought, and indeed their 
first 100 thoughts, are not for their workers. They're for their own 
self-preservation. Chief executives are paid huge amounts of money 
to make those decisions. The head of Boeing in the last year made 
more than $3.5 million dollars, according to "Forbes" magazine. The 
CEO of RJR Nabisco, almost $5 million. The co-head of Citigroup, more 
than $227 million. Why so many layoffs at Christmas? We asked Deborah 
Smith of the big accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers. They want 
to start clean and fresh for the next year and make profits higher 
if possible. Higher profits usually mean a bonus for the CEO and more 
stock options. And if the stock goes up five dollars in the next ten 
years, you'll make $5 million. Everything's down to money. You don't 
mean anything. You're just a name and a number. For Christmas, Rick 
brown and his wife are cutting back. No big gifts for each other. 
We're going to do the best we can, do with as little as we can, not 
go in debt and try and have a good one. It's the harsh reality of 
corporate downsizing. Even in an economy that's doing well, with many 
companies hiring, tens of thousands of hard-working people are losing 
their jobs at the worst possible time. Mike Jensen, NBC news, New 
York.
