On the Sunset Strip, the garish center of Hollywood night life, strivers, 
dreamers and castaways line up under the California sun for a show 
business version of a homespun tradition, Christmas dinner at a comedy 
club. This is the Laugh Factory's annual free Christmas feast for 
budding actors, comedians, musicians, writers and other entertainers 
who have come here to stake their claim but have found themselves 
alone, unable or unwilling to return home for the holidays. There's 
a full turkey dinner, stand-up comedy and the camaraderie of fellow 
struggling entertainers. Charley De La Pena, an actor and comedian 
who came to the Laugh Factory on Friday dressed as Santa Claus, said 
the dinner was a nice respite from the struggle for success, or even 
just work. (``I play 32 to 46,'' he said when asked his age.) ``The 
holidays are a lonely time right now,'' said De La Pena, who has been 
trying to make it big since he left San Antonio 25 years ago. ``This 
is a place for all the artists to laugh a little bit, take a rest 
from pounding the pavement trying to get an acting job that will take 
them to the top.'' Steve Moskowitz, 52, of West Hollywood said he 
has been getting by as a movie extra and paid audience member since 
he lost his job in the computer business. ``It's nice coming here, 
where you can meet other people in the same profession as you, starving 
actors, that sort of thing,'' Moskowitz said. ``L.A. can be a big, 
plastic place, but at least here you can meet other people, and they 
tend to be more open. And the food's good.'' Jamie Masada, the 38-year-old 
owner of the Laugh Factory, has been offering the free dinners on 
Christmas, Thanksgiving and Jewish holidays for 19 years. ``These 
people come to this town with such big heart and hopes, and all of 
a sudden the reality hits them in the face,'' Masada said of his guests. 
``All of a sudden it's hard.'' Last year, Masada said, he served 1,600 
people in four seatings. Masada estimates that the great majority 
of his Christmas guests earn little as entertainers, and that a fifth 
or more are homeless. Most come only a few times, but others return 
for years. One woman, Masada said, came every year for more than a 
decade, each time wearing the same holiday dress and bringing a taped-up 
photograph of herself as an extra in a Clark Gable movie. Of the thousands 
who have passed through his doors for holiday celebrations, perhaps 
20 or 30 have achieved some kind of fame, said Masada, who won't name 
names. Based on 1990 census figures, almost three-quarters of the 
adults living in the Los Angeles region came from another state, said 
Dowell Myers, who teaches demographics at the University of Southern 
California. Looking at the diners Friday at the Laugh Factory, it 
would seem those numbers could hold true for struggling entertainers. 
Elton White, 41, came to Los Angeles from Arkansas seven years ago 
with his wife Betty, 72. They perform a song-and-dance routine on 
public-access cable television and on the boardwalk in Venice Beach, 
Calif., near their home. ``It's a good place for people to get together 
on Christmas,'' White said of the dinner. ``It's a place for people 
who have no other place to go.'' At the Laugh Factory, revelers can 
find a measure of holiday cheer in one another. ``It's fortunate but 
it's unfortunate,'' said Allen Terry, 60, a former actor from New 
York who sells employment benefits to people in the entertainment 
industry. ``It's unfortunate that you lack friends and family, but 
it's fortunate you can make friends year after year at the Laugh Factory.''
