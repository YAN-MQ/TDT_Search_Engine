Doctors say they are very optimistic about the prognosis of seven 
of the octuplets in a Texas hospital, and "guardedly optimistic" about 
the prognosis of the smallest one. All eight remain in critical condition 
today. Doctors hope to take the seven healthiest babies off ventilators 
this weekend, but the eighth, who has a heart abnormality, is expected 
to remain on one for weeks. The babies' mother is in stable condition. 
Their father says he's stunned by the births. I'm excited and grateful 
to God for giving us these blessings. Me and my wife are very elated 
and we thank God. We thank the doctors and nurses that made this possible 
and we thank the world for praying for us. The first of the babies 
was born December 8th. The remaining seven were delivered by caesarean 
section on Sunday.
