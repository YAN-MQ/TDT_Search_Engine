Israel has denounced Russian Communist Party leader Gunamei Zhugonaf 
for making what it calls "anti-Semitic remarks" and called on Moscow 
to find an appropriate way to deal with his slurs. The Israeli foreign 
minister issued a statement Thursday, saying Mr. Zhugonaf's remarks 
are inconsistent with his claims that the Communist Party aims to 
build a democratic society in Russia. The party has taken on an increasingly 
nationalistic tone under Mr. Zhugonaf. Who has blamed Jews in the 
Russian government for helping cause the country's current problems. 
The Associated Press quoted him as saying: "Jews are responsible for 
the impoverishment and the process of extinction of Russia's people."
