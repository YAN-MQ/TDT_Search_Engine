Up next -- the first Christmas since this. How a small town's recovered 
from last spring's devastating tornadoes. Did you know harsh winter 
weather can leave even unexposed skin itchy and dry? Did you know 
moisturizers aren't always up to the challenge of itchy, dry skin? 
That's why there's new cortizone 10 plus. Among these, only cortizone 
10 plus has 10 moisturizers, like aloe and vitamins, plus the power 
of cortizone 10 to stop itch and help heal. So for itchy patches of 
dry skin, even eczema or psoriasis, try new cortizone 10 plus. Man, 
that Chili was hot. You got heartburn, too? Yeah. Wanna try these 
new pepcid ac chewables? It says you gotta take it with water. What's 
the water for? With tums you don't need water. Just because new pepcid 
is chewable doesn't mean it works like tums. Tums calcium knocks out 
heartburn fast. Pepcid chewables' famotidine has to go through your 
bloodstream, so it takes 40 minutes just to start controlling acid. 
Wanna go back for water? Forget the water. Pass the tums. Tums ta 
tum tum tums
