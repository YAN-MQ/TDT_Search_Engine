The best-seller ``A Civil Action'' tells the true story of a battle 
between a bold but flawed plaintiffs' lawyer named Jan Schlichtmann 
and two big corporations over whether they polluted the drinking water 
of Woburn, Mass. In the movie that is opening in theaters now, John 
Travolta portrays Schlichtmann as, if anything, bolder and more flawed. 
But in professor Lewis Grossman's class at American University's law 
school here _ and at law schools across the country _ Schlichtmann 
is already a star, foibles and all. Jonathan Harr's 1995 book about 
the lawsuit over the leukemia deaths of Woburn children is playing 
an extraordinary role in what some legal educators describe as a movement 
to modernize the training of lawyers in America. Across the country, 
``A Civil Action'' is required reading in courses in at least 50 law 
schools, including Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Georgetown and here at 
American University, where it is read in some civil procedures classes, 
one of the most important an aspiring lawyer will take. The widespread 
use of Harr's book illustrates how extensively legal educators have 
been searching for ways to modify the traditional method of teaching 
law, made famous in the 1973 movie ``The Paper Chase.'' For most of 
this century, ``case method'' has dominated the training of lawyers. 
It requires students to read scores of appeals court decisions _ and 
little else _ and then fend off withering questions from professors. 
``The Paper Chase' is dead,'' said Zygmunt Plater, a professor at 
Boston College Law School who uses Harr's book in his courses. ``The 
old war-of-attrition-game-of-wits where the teacher was saying `I'm 
smarter than anybody' was shown to be a foolish waste. What you want 
to do is engage students actively and this book does it.'' At the 
time of ``The Paper Chase,'' most students at law schools across the 
country took only courses based on the traditional case method and 
it was common for students to graduate from law school without having 
ever seen a real legal pleading document, met a client or learned 
much about the real-world workings of the legal system other than 
through pronouncements of appeals courts reprinted in their textbooks. 
The case method is still prevalent. But even the courses using it 
now often include other approaches, such as the study of documents 
from litigation. And by the time they graduate after three years, 
most students have taken several courses experimenting with new teaching 
methods. At graduation, many students have not only seen legal documents, 
many have drafted them for real clients in clinical courses. Proponents 
of the traditional method say it teaches students to think like lawyers. 
But critics have said for years that it left young lawyers with little 
appreciation of how to deal with people who become entangled in the 
legal system. Harr's book, said Grossman, arrived just when legal 
educators were developing an appetite for something like it. ``The 
top down, principle-heavy way of teaching law was starting to crumble 
and professors were starting to question whether it was working anymore,'' 
he said. ``You can view this as a revolution in law teaching.'' To 
the consternation of some traditional educators, law schools recently 
have tried other new approaches, like computer simulations of cases 
and role playing. Some law schools have even introduced classes on 
literature in which students read books like Herman Melville's ``Billy 
Budd'' and ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' by Harper Lee and then discuss 
the legal and ethical issues. Before ``A Civil Action,'' some professors 
had used other books about lawsuits. But few of those books had drawn 
anywhere near as much attention in law schools as Harr's book. Some 
legal educators say Harr's vivid portrait of the innards of a lawsuit 
is providing a model of how to teach legal principles through narratives 
that show students the effect of the law on people, like the anguished 
Woburn families of ``A Civil Action.'' ``For me,'' said Carrie Menkel-Meadow, 
a professor at Georgetown University Law Center who uses the book 
in her classes, ``It is putting flesh on the bones of what practicing 
law is all about: the people in cases.'' Harr also described the real-world 
complexities of lawyers' motivations. Schlichtmann was portrayed as 
an ambitious lawyer who wanted to profit handsomely by doing good 
works. Harr's narrative dwells on the expensive Porsche Schlichtmann 
drove and the exclusive restaurants he frequented. In Grossman's civil 
procedure class at American University's Washington College of Law, 
the students referred to the participants in the Woburn case by name, 
as if they knew them. They giggled at the mention of some of the players 
in the legal drama. During the class, Grossman referred in detail 
to a series of moves by Schlichtmann and his adversaries. Why, for 
example, he asked his students, had Schlichtmann chosen the two corporate 
defendants, W.R. Grace and Beatrice Foods, to sue when there were 
many industrial polluters in Woburn? A student raised his hand. ``Money. 
Money,'' he said. ``They had deep pockets.'' After class one student, 
Jackie Hershkowitz, said: ```A Civil Action' shows the best and the 
worst of the legal profession, Schlichtmann himself represents those 
two extremes.'' Some legal educators, like Richard Hausler, a professor 
at the University of Miami Law School for the last 51 years, say they 
worry that the new teaching methods might turn out lawyers who do 
not understand legal principles thoroughly. ``I can't have them go 
out and be sociologists and all that jazz unless they have learned 
the fundamentals,'' Hausler said. At law schools from coast to coast, 
though, the fascination with the Woburn case goes far beyond simply 
reading the book. Students study original legal filings from the case. 
There are Internet sites filled with the scientific evidence from 
the trial. Grossman and a colleague from the law school here, Robert 
Vaughn, went to a federal document center near Boston to retrieve 
scores of the original documents from the suit. The two professors 
are now working on a legal textbook dealing entirely with the Woburn 
case to be published by one of the major law text publishers, Foundation 
Press. For the last two years, both professors have been assigning 
the original legal documents as well as Harr's book as required reading 
in courses on the rules of civil law practice that they structure 
entirely around the Woburn case. What is striking about this is that 
this class, in law schools, is one of a handful of core courses.
