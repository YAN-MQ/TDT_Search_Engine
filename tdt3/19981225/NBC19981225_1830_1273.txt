Of course, the southeast is no stranger to bad weather. But last April, 
a tornado of astonishing power ripped through Alabama, killing 34. 
NBC's fredricka Whitfield covered the tornado and its destruction. 
She returned this Christmas to see how the people there are recovering, 
since their lives were literally turned upside down. Winds as high 
as 300 miles per hour blew apart 450 homes last april along a ten-mile 
stretch through central Alabama. Today, this is what Christmas looks 
and sounds like. Scraps of metal, downed trees and the buzz of power 
tools -- fixtures here since a killer, half-mile-wide tornado swept 
through. It makes you sad. Tommy Pappas survived the storm, but his 
89-year-old in-laws did not. The day after the tornado, Pappas looked 
through the remains of their house. They had all their stuff here. 
This holiday, Pappas will clean up, a Christmas gift to his wife. 
When people, the family rides by, it'll help them feel better. Across 
the street, Tony Williams remembers his brush with death. All my stuff 
was tore up. He had just closed the basement door before the tornado 
flattened his house. Packing and leaving. That was then. Never looked 
like I'd be able to walk across the property again, much less have 
a house, but here it is. Built in the exact spot where his old house 
used to be. Despite the rebuilding, forgetting about what happened 
here is nearly impossible. This was ground zero eight months ago. 
Today, splintered trees are vivid reminders of a tornado that took 
the lives of 34 people. 60 members of the open door church barely 
escaped death by huddling together in a hallway as the building crumbled 
around them. Father, we thank you for the privilege of being here 
tonight. Something no longer taken for granted. Instead of toys, 10-year-old 
Hannah Johnson's Christmas wish -- to forget that horrible night. 
Every time it rains, I get really scared. For some here, the holidays 
have a way of easing fears. Although it may not look like Christmas 
in central Alabama, they say it's never been more meaningful. Fredericka 
Whitfield, NBC news, bessemer, Alabama.
