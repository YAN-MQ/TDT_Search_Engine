In the nation's capital, public works crews say the first snow emergency 
of the year is past. But they are warning that low temperatures could 
allow new ice to form in some areas as melted snow refreezes. And 
in parts of the pacific northwest, it was the first major snowfall 
of the year. Washington state patrol officers in Seattle and Spokane 
report dozens of weather-related accidents, mostly fender-benders. 
And in southeastern Massachusetts, a white Christmas seems almost 
certain. Some towns got as much as eight inches of snow Thursday. 
And temperatures are holding at or below freezing. Mary Jo lipman, 
"Headline News."
