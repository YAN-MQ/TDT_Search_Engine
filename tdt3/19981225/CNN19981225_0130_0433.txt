A government inspector has concluded the U.S. capitol and five house 
office buildings are firetraps. In a scathing report, the house inspector-general 
says the buildings leave visitors, members of Congress and employees 
with, "an undue risk of loss of life and property." Problems range 
from fire alarms that can't be heard, inadequate escape routes and 
sprinklers that haven't been replaced, even after they were recalled.
