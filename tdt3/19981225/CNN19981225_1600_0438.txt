A government inspector has concluded the U.S. capitol and five house 
office buildings are firetraps. In a scathing report, the house inspector 
general says the buildings leave visitors, members of Congress and 
employees with "an undue risk of loss of life and property." Problems 
include fire alarms that can't be heard, inadequate escape routes 
and sprinklers that haven't been replaced even after they were recalled. 
The head of the department that maintains the buildings says it's 
not fair to compare the capitol and other offices to recently completed 
buildings.
