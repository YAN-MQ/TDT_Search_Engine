Silent night holy night American servicemen and women, far away from 
their homes and families at Christmas time, bringing relief to the 
hurricane victims of central America. We ask, God that you would comfort 
our families back home as we are separate from them. After hurricane 
Mitch lashed central America, the U.S. military sprang into action, 
delivering relief supplies to the hardest hit areas. Now, seven weeks 
later, 3,000 American military personnel are on the job, the Pentagon 
planning to increase their number to 5,600 in the coming weeks. Among 
the projects, American medical teams fanning out into the far corners 
of the region to halt the spread of disease. U.S Marines and Navy 
seabees building bridges to replace some of those swept away. The 
people here seem to welcome the help from the U.S. military. They 
beep. They wave when they go by, just very friendly and helpful. I 
guess they're glad you're here, huh? Yeah, they're happy we're here. 
The hurricane's after effects are particularly hard on the remote 
areas of Honduras, where villages have been cut off from the outside 
world and the peoples' livelihood, destroyed. One of those areas, 
the mosquitias Indian country of northeastern Honduras. Before Mitch, 
the Indians used small boats to tend their crops and get them to market. 
But now, the crops are gone. And the Indians live on handouts of food. 
One urgent need, the means to plant new crops. Mitch hit just as the 
harvesting season was about to commence. And so, as a result, their 
stores were low. And they were unable to harvest. So, if we can get 
tools and seeds to these guys, that would really be a Great thing. 
The G.I.'s concede it's tough not being home, but say they feel better 
knowing they're doing good. I have children at home. And it just makes 
you feel really appreciative of everything you have at home. Reason 
to give thanks at Christmas time, so far away from home. George Lewis, 
NBC news, mocoron, Honduras. Christmas, 1998, around the world and 
at home.
