From Public Radio International, this is The World. A co-production 
of the BBC World Service, and WGBH Boston. It's Friday December 25th, 
I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. On this Christmas Day, a special archival 
edition of The World with some highlights from the past year. Civil 
War history lives on in an unlikely place, Brazil. We visit a town 
called Americana. Also, the troubles when love brings together Russians 
and Americans. A Russians feel a friend is someone to whom you can 
say anything. Who you call and who will come at 3 in the morning much 
sometimes to the distress of the American spouse. And Madison Avenue's 
love affair with Hispanic market. First though, this news.
