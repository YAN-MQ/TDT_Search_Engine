In a television commercial for an online computer warehouse, gerbils 
appear to be shot out of a cannon smack into a wall. In an advertisement 
hawking doughnuts, an off-screen cat cries in pain after being stepped 
on. A spot for a video game shows a goldfish wriggling on the floor 
amid the shards of a shattered aquarium. Meanwhile, in some of the 
year's most talked about movies, dogs are drugged, spray-painted and 
maltreated, all for comic effect. You thought wearing fur was bad? 
As both Madison Avenue and Hollywood searched for laughs in 1998 _ 
finding fun in the grossest gags and the most bleepable language _ 
animal abuse somehow got humorously hip. From ``There's Something 
About Mary'' to ``Enemy of the State'' and ``Very Bad Things,'' pets 
were treated in ways that you shouldn't treat a dog. Although the 
cruelty was make-believe _ that border terrier didn't really end up 
in a full-body cast in ``Mary'' _ the trend is very real. When even 
the G-rated ``Babe: Pig in the City'' is filled with disturbing animal 
violence _ one scene had a pit bull nearly hanged by his own chain 
_ it's open season. Two weeks ago, the tabloids had a field day with 
the disclosure that some inexpensively priced coats were trimmed in 
dog fur and were being recalled by Burlington Coat Factory. But the 
mass media do not seem to mind animal suffering as humor. Entertainment 
Weekly, for instance, called the flying gerbils commercial for Outpost.com 
``one standout spot'' and reported last week that feedback on the 
spot has been 65 percent positive. ``Whether you find it hilarious 
or horrid, the airborne pets manage to shock even in today's seen-it-all 
era,'' the magazine decided. Dead-animal jokes aren't new, as anyone 
who saw ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' the 1988 Kevin Kline comedy, knows. 
Who didn't giggle as Kline swallowed a man's prized goldfish? But 
10 years ago, that kind of comedy was the exception _ the taboo-breaking 
province of Monty Python's Flying Circus and ``Saturday Night Live.'' 
Even last year, it was still considered shocking when a dinosaur ate 
a dog but spat out the doghouse in ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park.'' 
Before that, Hollywood animals usually survived in disaster movies 
_ often laughably overcoming the slimmest of odds, as in ``Independence 
Day,'' when Vivica A. Fox's dog miraculously outran an explosion. 
But when a dog ended up as an hors d'oeuvre in ``The Lost World,'' 
it ushered in a new era. In the Oscar-winning ``As Good as It Gets,'' 
for instance, a Brussels griffon was sent down a garbage chute, and 
people howled. He lived. Yet somehow, today's audiences don't care 
to distinguish between Wile E. Coyote's being hit on the head with 
a falling anvil in a Looney Tunes cartoon and a simulation of cruelty 
to a pet in a live-action adult comedy. Even if no animals were harmed 
in the production of these films and commercials, the idea that it's 
funny to hurt an animal is dangerous. It is particularly so because 
today's movies are not like the old cartoons, or the dead parrots 
and exploding cats in Monty Python vehicles. That was absurdist humor. 
This is just mean. Why is this happening? Maybe advertising agencies 
and artists are fed up with those of us who treat our dogs as children 
by spoiling them with luxurious Gucci leather beds, rubber bones from 
Paul Smith and hand-knit sweaters nicer than most people will ever 
wear. When I started signing my dog's name to my Christmas cards in 
a childlike scrawl with the ``e'' backward and a tiny paw print next 
to it, even I worried that I'd gone too far. But it's no excuse for 
creative minds to start acting like Glenn Close's maniacal character 
in ``Fatal Attraction'' and gleefully taking it out on pets. Perhaps 
it's all part of the backlash against political correctness that has 
characterized the 1990s. Or maybe it's a jaded byproduct of the arrogance 
that goes with fast money earned in a booming economy. Fashion magazines 
and many of the most respected designers in the world have decided 
that fur is no longer a sign of boorishness. But what about dead-dog 
jokes? Where do we draw the line? Are the Farrelly brothers any better 
than Fendi? Of course, people aren't treated very well in movies these 
days, either. The human beings in ``There's Something About Mary,'' 
for instance, suffer plenty of indignities. And in the new ``Psycho,'' 
one still shouldn't shower at the Bates Motel. But when ants and moths 
_ those spoilers of Bryant Park picnics and Banana Republic cashmere 
sweaters _ are considered cute in animated films, it is strange that 
pets can meet savage ends in live-action movies and that audiences 
laugh. Literature from animal rights organizations quotes the old 
dictum that you can judge a society by the way it treats its animals. 
If that's true, we come up lacking. We've become way too cynical for 
our own good. Maybe we shouldn't treat animals as our offspring, but 
they're not disposable either. At the end of the Outpost.com commercial, 
a title card taunts viewers, goading them to write in their complaints. 
Even gerbils deserve better.
