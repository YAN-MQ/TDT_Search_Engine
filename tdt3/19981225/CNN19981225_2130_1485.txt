A small town is celebrating Christmas in a unique way. They are making 
nativity scenes out of mud. They have been creating figure evens for 
generations. They soften the mud by stepping on it and then shape 
the figures by hand and paint them. Final Po ducts are packaged and 
shipped around the world.
