People emerged from their shelters Friday to attend Christmas religious 
services in the highland city of Kuito during a lull in rebel shelling, 
Roman Catholic church workers said. Thirty people were killed and 
37 were wounded Thursday in the heaviest rebel attack on the besieged 
city since fighting between UNITA rebels and the government flared 
anew early this month undermining a 1994 peace accord, the private 
Radio Eclesia reported. ``I can't express what it was like,'' a church 
worker in Kuito, who did not identify herself, said Friday, referring 
to the intensity of Thursday's all-day shelling. Nine of the dead 
were killed when mortar fire hit a Roman Catholic church in Kuito's 
outskirts, the Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted military sources 
as saying. UNITA rebels entrenched around Kuito began shelling the 
city again Friday around noon, a male church worker said. Kuito's 
population of about 100,000 was swollen with a further 30,000 displaced 
in the past two weeks, as battles raged throughout the central highlands. 
``A lot of people have come from other towns and villages and they 
have nothing to eat,'' the female church worker said. Relief agencies 
have stopped flying food and medicine into the city's airport that 
has been targeted by the rebels to prevent the government sending 
in reinforcements. Kuito, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast 
of the capital Luanda, has been a major focus of conflict between 
UNITA rebels and the government that resumed this month, dissolving 
the 1994 United Nations-brokered pact which was supposed to end a 
two-decade civil war. The government regained control of Kuito from 
the rebels during the intensive conflict that followed UNITA leader 
Jonas Savimbi's refusal to accept defeat the country's first elections 
in 1992, breaking an earlier peace agreement signed the year before. 
Angola's civil war began in 1975, following a 14-year fight for independence 
from Portugal's colonial rule. About half a million people were killed, 
and hundreds of thousands were left maimed, homeless and exposed to 
disease and hunger.
