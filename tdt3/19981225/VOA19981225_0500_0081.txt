Saudi militant Usamah Bin Laden has renewed a call for attacks on 
American and Israeli targets. Speaking through an interpreter on ABC 
television, Mr. Bin Laden said he was confident that the Muslim nation 
would rid Islamic countries of the Americans and the Jews. The network 
broadcast excerpts from an interview it said was conducted late Wednesday 
in Afghanistan. Mr. Bin Laden again denied involvement in the bombings 
of two U.S. embassies in East Africa last August.
