Cruzeiro has a third and final chance to capture an elusive championship 
title this year if they beat Palmeiras on Saturday in the second leg 
of the Mercosur Cup final. Last week Cruzeiro lost the Brazilian Championship 
to the Corinthians in a hard fought three game series. Earlier this 
year, Cruzeiro lost the Brasil Cup to archrival Palmeiras, a team 
laden with current and former members of the Brazilian national team 
and coached by Luiz Felipe Scolari. Those losses left Cruzeiro out 
of the continent-wide Liberators of America Cup next year. ``Head 
coach Levir Culp knows that he has his work cut out for him to lift 
the morale of his players,'' the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil said Friday. 
But Cruzeiro, based in Belo Horizonte, now has the upper hand after 
beating Palmeiras 2-1 in the first leg of the Mercosur Cup finals 
Dec. 16. Cruzeiro needs only a tie to capture the title, while Palmeiras 
needs to win by at least two goals at their Antartica Park stadium 
in Sao Paulo. If Palmeiras wins by less than two goals, a third and 
final game will be played Dec. 29. Cruzeiro has two other advantages. 
Palmeiras all-star players Junior Bahiano (defender) and Oseas (striker) 
are doubtful for Saturday's game due to injuries. And Cruzeiro management 
has promised to pay its players a million dollars if they win the 
Mercosur Cup. Probable Line-ups: Cruzeiro: Dida, Gustavo, Marcelo 
Djian, Wilson Gottardo, Gilberto, Marcos Paulo, Ricardinho, Valdo 
(Djair), Marcelo Ramos (Fabio Junior), Caio (Alex Alves) and Muller. 
Palmeiras: Velloso, Almir (Arce), Junior Baiano (Agnaldo), Cleber, 
Junior, Roque Junior, Rogerio, Alex, Zinho, Paulo Nunes and Oseas.
