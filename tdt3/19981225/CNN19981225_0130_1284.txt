The Minnesota Vikings have inked offensive tackle korey stringer to 
a Five-year, $18-million extension, while quarterback Randall Cunningham 
was rewarded for his fine play. He was also given a five-year extension. 
No terms of his deal was released. Cunningham is the league's top-rated 
quarterback and has thrown 32 touchdowns. I'm satisfied that I'm not 
going to look at the future and say, "wow, I should be making more 
or this or that." I'm content with what God has blessed me with through 
the Vikings. And I'm very happy with it. I accept it. It's hit me, 
but it hasn't hit me where I'm going to start crying or anything yet. 
But I'm sure that when I get home with my family and we sit down and 
we start dwelling on it a little bit more, I'll show a whole bunch 
more appreciation for it.
