Imagine carp instead of turkey and cranberry sauce. That's what people 
in the Czech Republic and other central European countries are eating 
for Christmas today, but animal rights advocates say the suffering 
of the fish isn't worthy of Christmas. The BBC's Ray Furlong reports 
from Prague. For most Czechs, Christmas is unthinkable without carp 
and the fish can be seen being sold all over the country from roadside 
stores, kept alive in tanks of water, so they're as fresh as possible 
on Christmas Day. Campaigners for animal rights believe there are 
too many of the carp crammed into the water tanks. But, the problem 
goes further, really traditional Czechs are so keen to keep their 
fish fresh that they take it home alive and keep it in the bath for 
a couple of days. Furthermore, some people don't know how to kill 
it quickly and painlessly. There are even some stories of the whole 
family having a bash before finally killing it. Whereas, Fishmongers 
kill the carp in a matter of seconds in a method prescribed by official 
regulations. The BBC's Ray Furlong in Prague on the battle of animal 
rights activists taking on the Czech tradition of eating fresh fish 
for Christmas.
