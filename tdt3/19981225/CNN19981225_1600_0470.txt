Two influential democratic senators are drafting a proposal to censure 
President Clinton. CNN has learned senators Robert Byrd of West Virginia 
and Daniel Patrick moynihan of New York met earlier this week. They're 
working on a compromise that would be designed to meet constitutional 
requirements and win republican support. Moynihan told "the New York

trial.
