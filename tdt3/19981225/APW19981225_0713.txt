Ben Kelly ran 93 yards for a touchdown on the opening kickoff and 
Colorado scored on four of six Oregon turnovers, before withstanding 
a fourth-quarter rally to beat the No. 21 Oregon Ducks 51-43 Friday 
in college football's Aloha Bowl. Quarterback Mike Moschetti threw 
touchdown passes of 72 yards to Darrin Chiaverini, 58 yards to Marcus 
Stiggers, 20 yards to Daniel Graham and 5 yards to Javon Green to 
set an Aloha Bowl record for most touchdown passes and lead the Buffaloes 
(8-4) to victory in the school's 1,000th game. Damon Wheeler had a 
52-yard interception return for a TD for Colorado and Jeremy Aldrich 
kicked field goals of 48, 41 and 23 yards to set a bowl record for 
most field goals as the teams combined for the most points in the 
17-year history of the game. Running back Derien Latimer had three 
touchdowns for Oregon (8-4). Quarterback Akili Smith scored on a 1-yard 
run and passed for second-half scores of 9 yards to Jed Weaver and 
42 yards to Donald Haynes. Smith's touchdown to Haynes cut the Colorado 
lead to 51-43 with 5:55 to play. The Ducks stopped Colorado on a fourth-and-2 
on the next series, taking over at their own 43 with 3:11 to play. 
But the Buffaloes' defense held Oregon on fourth down and ran out 
the clock for the win. Moschetti and Smith were named the game's most 
valuable players. The 94 points scored by both teams break's the bowl's 
record of 81 points scored in 1995, when Kansas beat UCLA 51-30. The 
51 points scored by Colorado ties the record for most points by one 
team set by Kansas and matched by Washington last year.
