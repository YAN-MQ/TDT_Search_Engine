Well, at any other time of year, you might consider it to be an ordinary 
weed. But in Decatur, Illinois, a plant that sprouted from the concrete 
median of a highway became a Christmas display. The weed happened 
to be shaped like a Christmas tree. So, some anonymous person or persons 
decorated it. Drivers on the highway have been pleased to see the 
weed bedecked in red ribbons and tinsels. Brightly wrapped gifts, 
actually bricks, appeared beneath it. And a silver star was hung at 
the top. Residents say the first ornament arrived in late November. 
And other decorations soon followed. Very novel for an American type 
of Christmas.
