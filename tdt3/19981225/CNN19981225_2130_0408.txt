In Florida, prison inmates may be getting a Christmas wish fulfilled. 
The state's Supreme Court ruled yesterday as many as 13,000 inmates 
should be released early. The court says those sentenced before 1983 
should benefit from release programs that were in effect when they 
committed their crimes. Prison officials plan to appeal the ruling. 
They say no inmates will be released for months.
