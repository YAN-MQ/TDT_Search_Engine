This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for tomorrow morning. Snowfall will continue in the northwest, 
certainly at the higher elevations. But rainfall, really, only in 
the extreme coastal areas. Now the storm is weakening as it moves 
on shore. Meanwhile, in the southeast, the storm continues to pull 
away out into the atlantic, carrying the rainfall, the freezing rain, 
the ice, the snow with it. A few snowflakes will be found in the Great 
Lakes area as we go through the day tomorrow. But all in all, temperatures 
are warming. Still cold in the upper midwest, but in the deep south, 
where we've been seeing the ice and snow, daytime highs will climb 
into the 40s, 50s, and, in some places in Texas, even into the 60s. 
So all of that frozen precipitation will be melting. Here is a look 
at your extended forecast. On Sunday, still some heavy rain and snow 
in the northwest. A few scattered showers are possible in Florida. 
You can see, still relatively warm temperatures on the map relative 
to what we've been going through the last couple of days. And as we 
head on into Tuesday, precipitation forecast for the east calls for 
snowfall to the north, a few thunderstorms possible to the south.
