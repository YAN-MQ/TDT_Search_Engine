The U.S. head of international monitors in Kosovo ventured to the 
center of a dangerous new outbreak of fighting Friday, appealing to 
both rebel and Serb forces in a desperate attempt to avert a return 
to full-scale war. William Walker met with a rebel commander in a 
Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold during a lull in a second day of 
fighting in northern Kosovo, while Yugoslav army tanks pointed their 
turrets at the rebel-held village from a nearby hill. He said he hoped 
to talk to Serb commanders later as part of his bid to end the Serb 
offensive that killed a reported nine or more ethnic Albanians and 
prompted a fierce response from the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army. 
``This is the tensest period since the agreement was signed in October,'' 
said Walker, head of the team of unarmed peace verifiers still being 
assembled by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
But he dispelled any notion of a withdrawal of the monitoring force 
_ now 600-strong and being increased to 2,000 in the coming weeks 
_ in face of increased danger. ``More verifiers are the answer to 
violence,'' the American told reporters. A day after the Serbs launched 
their crackdown just west of the northern town of Podujevo, near the 
main road between Belgrade and Kosovo's capital Pristina, machine-gun 
and small-arms fire rattled the area. OSCE spokesman Jorgen Grunnet 
reported there was ``a lot less activity'' than Thursday, when Serb 
forces backed by artillery and dozens of tanks swept into the area 
in what they said was a response to the killing of a policeman earlier 
in the week. But the fighting still poses the gravest threat yet to 
the Oct. 12 agreement that brought a tenuous halt to months of combat 
between the Serbs and the guerrillas trying to break the predominantly 
Albanian-populated province away from Serbian rule. The attack by 
Serb troops and tanks against six villages north of Pristina sent 
hundreds fleeing into snow-covered hills. Two columns of Yugoslav 
military vehicles, each consisting of several tanks and armored personnel 
carriers, returned to their base from the fighting area late Friday, 
Grunnet said, although it wasn't clear if the clashes were over. In 
the wake of the Serbs' Christmas Eve offensive, the KLA stopped short 
of saying it would no longer abide by an informal cease-fire, but 
said late Thursday it would ``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack 
with all means available.'' The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information 
Center put Thursday's death toll at at least nine, including a woman 
and a 6-year-old girl, and said a large number were wounded. Serb 
authorities blamed the rebels for the latest shooting in the Podujevo 
area, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina. The state Tanjug 
news agency said a team of Serbian officials investigating Thursday's 
fighting was fired at Friday by ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.'' Army 
tanks could be seen filling in trenches dug by the KLA around Lapastica, 
the village which houses the rebels' regional command post and which 
was left largely intact despite the clash. Several burned-out cars, 
their windows shot out, were visible along the road from Podujevo 
to Lapastica. Bozidar Filic, the spokesman for Serb police in Kosovo, 
said the action Friday was against rebels in the Lapastica region 
``who have built up a whole system of fortifications, used for their 
attacks against police and the civilians.'' Walker held talks with 
the KLA regional commander, known simply as Remi, who insisted to 
the diplomat that his forces were not firing unless fired upon and 
demanded that the Serbs withdraw. ``I'm here to convince both sides 
that this isn't the way to settle differences,'' Walker said after 
emerging from the two-story building in a walled compound. But, he 
acknowledged, ``It's a tough situation.'' The United States, France 
and the European Union have warned both sides against further violence. 
In an interview with the Serbian independent newspaper Danas, the 
EU envoy for Kosovo, Wolfgang Petritsch, said the international community 
``will not tolerate an excessive use of force by the Yugoslav army'' 
in the province. The OSCE sent a ``very strong protest'' to Yugoslav 
authorities, Grunnet said, after an incident Thursday in which a Serb 
policeman warned a team of verifiers he would shoot if they didn't 
leave immediately from outside the military barracks in Podujevo they 
were watching. The Yugoslav government has pledged to ensure the protection 
of the verifiers force. A NATO force of 1,800 soldiers is stationed 
in neighboring Macedonia to rescue them if needed.
