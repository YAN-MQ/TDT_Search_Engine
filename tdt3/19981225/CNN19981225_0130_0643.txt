The holidays are full of festivities, family, friends and food. Lots 
of food. While overindulging can be dangerous for diabetics or those 
on strict diets, most people will just experience a stomach ache, 
and some guilt. To avoid the stomach ache, be selective. Make sure 
that you eat what you really love, but don't overeat on the other 
things. If you can't resist all the goodies and wind up with that 
overstuffed feeling, here are some tips to help you recover. Go for 
a walk. Fresh air is best. If you can't go outside, just walk around 
the house a bit. Brush your teeth. Changing the taste in your mouth 
may help you feel refreshed. Chew some gum. Experts say it will make 
you less likely to put more food in your mouth. And finally, pace 
yourself. If you loaded up on dinner, wait a bit before indulging 
in dessert. As for the guilt -- If you've enjoyed it, you shouldn't 
feel guilty. But you don't have to overdo it to enjoy it. And I think 
that's the key. For the latest health news online, check out CNN.com/health.
