Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Friday warned the West against 
using force to halt the latest violence in Kosovo, and the Foreign 
Ministry called on both sides in the conflict to exercise ``maximum 
restraint.'' U.S. and NATO officials warned both sides in Kosovo not 
to resort to violence after a Serb offensive against an ethnic Albanian 
rebel stronghold. The U.S. State Department also condemned all breaches 
of an October cease-fire, including attacks by the Kosovo Liberation 
Army, which seeks to secede from Yugoslavia. Last October, NATO prepared 
airstrikes against the Serbs as punishment for their crackdown on 
Kosovo's Albanians, but the attacks were put on hold after the cease 
fire was reached and Belgrade pulled out some of its forces. Russia 
has steadfastly opposed attacks against the Serbs, its longtime allies. 
Ivanov said that if the West attacks Serbian forces, such ``strikes 
would play into the hands of extremists in the region.'' He blamed 
the KLA for the recent violence, and said that Moscow would do all 
it could to avert any NATO strikes. In an official statement Friday 
evening, the Foreign Ministry said it considered the KLA's announcement 
that it would stop observing a cease-fire ``a dangerous signal.'' 
The KLA had said late Thursday it would ``not sit idly by'' and would 
``attack with all means available.'' ``The continuation of provocations 
and hostile actions carries a threat to the already fragile balance 
in the region,'' the ministry statement said. The ministry also said 
it was alarmed by violations of Yugoslavia's borders, and pointed 
in particular to Albania, ``from whose territory fighters and weapons 
continue to be sent, especially into those areas from which (Serb) 
army and police have already been relocated.'' The ministry called 
again for a political settlement to the conflict. ``The attempts to 
shift the accent from promoting a political settlement to the use 
of force ... are unacceptable,'' the statement said.
