Following a Serb offensive against a Kosovo rebel stronghold, both 
sides are vowing to keep fighting, dealing a new, severe setback to 
an already shaky U.S.-brokered cease-fire agreement. A statement issued 
overnight from the Yugoslav army corps in Kosovo's capital Pristina 
said two soldiers were wounded in a ``terrorist attack'' Thursday 
on a military convoy on a road in the north of the province. The army 
said its convoy was on ``regular practice activities'' when it came 
under automatic fire and hand grenades.'' ``The Yugoslav army returned 
fire and destroyed the terrorist group,'' the statement concluded.
