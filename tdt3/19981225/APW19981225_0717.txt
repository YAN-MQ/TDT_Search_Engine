A trader with a Chicago-based company lost more than dlrs 8 million 
in an unauthorized transaction on a London financial exchange, The 
Independent reported Saturday. The London International Financial 
Futures and Options Exchange, known as LIFFE, has warned its members 
not to trade with Griffin Trading Co., the newspaper said. It said 
the company was in default, meaning it may not be able to meet its 
debt, following the transaction. The newspaper did not give an exact 
figure for the losses, say when the deal took place or provide any 
details on the trader. Griffin Trading was closed for Christmas on 
Friday, and officials did not immediately return a message. ``What 
is known is there was a trader in London that cleared through Griffin's 
... and that person substantially exceeded their trading parameters 
and resulted in a very large loss,'' The Independent quoted Ty Fahner, 
chairman of London law firm Mayer Brown and Platt, as saying. Quoting 
unidentified sources, the newspaper said the trader had lost the money 
on German derivatives, a complex and high-risk financial instrument. 
LIFFE is one of Europe's largest derivatives markets. The newspaper 
said it declined to comment. In 1995, trader Nick Leeson lost dlrs 
1.38 billion speculating on Asian stock markets from his base in Singapore. 
His rogue trades brought down Barings, Britain's oldest merchant bank.
