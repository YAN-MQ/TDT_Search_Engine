The U.S. College Football post-season continues today. With two games 
scheduled for Hawaii. The Aloha Bowl, and the Oahu Bowl. In the Aloha 
Bowl, the Colorado Buffaloes are taking on the Oregon Ducks. Now, 
Colorado has won four straight post-season appearances. And scored 
an average of 38 points in those games. Oregon broke a four game post-season 
losing streak last year when it beat Air Force in the Las Vegas Bowl. 
Right now they are in the first quarter in Hawaii. And the score is 
10, and Oregon: nothing. Meanwhile, the Air Force Academy Falcons, 
the Western Athletic Conference champions, take on the Washington 
Huskies at the same stadium in the Oahu Bowl. Washington is making 
its fourth trip to Hawaii. The Huskies beat Michigan State last year 
in the Aloha Bowl. And the Colorado Buffaloes have just scored again. 
That makes the score in the Aloha Bowl right now Colorado: 17, and 
Oregon: nothing.
