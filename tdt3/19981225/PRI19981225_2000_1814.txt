For The World, I'm Derrick Stofall in the BBC News Room in London. 
There's been more fighting in the Serbian province of Kosovo today, 
but International Monitor William Walker says the Serbs have withdrawn 
some of their forces from positions near the northern town of Podyavo, 
the scene of heavy fighting yesterday with ethnic Albanian rebels. 
For Belgrade, the BBC's Jackie Roland reports. William Walker had 
separate meetings with Serbian military commanders and local leader 
of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. His message to both sides were 
the same, pull back your forces and respect the cease-fire. Before 
his trip to the northern region of Podyavo, Mr. Walker said the Serbs 
and ethnic Albanians were occupying the same positions as on Thursday. 
But, he said both sides had indicated they were willing to stop hostilities 
provided they were not fired upon themselves. Jackie Roland, BBC News, 
Belgrade.
