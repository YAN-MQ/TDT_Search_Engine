The chief prosecutor of Spain's National Court has come out in favor 
of granting Britain's request to extradite alleged road rage murderer 
Kenneth Noye, a news report said Friday. Prosecutor Eduardo Fungairino 
concluded that Noye should be extradited in a report prepared for 
the Madrid-based National Court that is hearing the case, according 
to the private news agency Europa Press. No further details of the 
report were available. Noye is wanted for questioning by the British 
authorities for the stabbing death of 21-year-old Stephen Cameron 
after the two got into an argument in May 1996 on the busy M25 highway 
encircling London. After over two years on the run, Noye was arrested 
in southern Spain in August, and is currently being held in a prison 
close to Madrid. Fungairino's report prepared for the National Court 
is a required step towards a formal extradition hearing before a three-judge 
panel that will decide whether to send Noye to Britain. Noye, 51, 
said he would fight extradition during a 10-minute preliminary hearing 
on Nov. 16 before Judge Baltasar Garzon _ the same judge spearheading 
efforts to extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain 
from London on charges of terrorism, torture and genocide. Spain's 
National Court hears cases considered of national interest such as 
large-scale corruption, terrorism, or extradition. Routinely referred 
to in Britain's tabloid press as one of the country's most wanted 
men, Noye was sentenced in 1986 to 14 years in prison for his role 
in a dlrs 38.7 million gold robbery. He was released several years 
ago. In 1985 he was acquitted of killing an undercover policeman, 
John Fordham, who was part of a team investigating the gold robbery.
