At a refugee camp for Hurricane Mitch survivors, Olivia Cortez carefully 
divided up six pounds (2.7 kilograms) of donated chicken into 96 small 
pieces. Each one-ounce (28-gram) piece, along with a little rice and 
potatoes, would be the entire Christmas dinner for most of the 74 
children at the camp. The 72 adults would have to settle for less. 
``We'll have to be content with the smell of chicken,'' said Cortez, 
who lost two children and 10 other relatives Oct. 30 when Hurricane 
Mitch caused a landslide on the side of the Casitas volcano, killing 
2,000 people. Overall, more than 9,000 people in Central America were 
killed by the storm, according to official figures There were few 
signs of Christmas at the refugee camp in Posoltega, one of 13 camps 
for victims of the landslide. There was little food and not enough 
toys to go around. Barefoot children in ragged clothing danced to 
the music of a visitor's car radio as they broke open two candy-filled 
pinatas that had been donated to the camp. A few firecrackers were 
set off. Cortez could only yearn for the Christmases of the past. 
``We would kill our own chickens and eat them with the rice that we 
grew ourselves,'' she said. Now she lives with 36 other families on 
a soybean field, sleeping on the ground in tents donated by the U.S. 
Agency for International Development. ``We want land to work on,'' 
she said. ``Because if we don't get (any), we're going continue to 
live in misery.'' The Nicaraguan government and the Sandinista-controlled 
municipal government offered little help for Christmas. The Sandinista 
radio station, Radio Ya, had distributed toys on Tuesday, but many 
children didn't receive any. The national government didn't give out 
any presents, refugees said. The government said it would help the 
refugees celebrate the Day of the Three Kings on Jan. 6.
