Jan Meyerowitz, a prolific composer whose varied catalog includes 
eight operas and many chamber, symphonic and choral works, died in 
Colmar, France, on Dec. 15. He was 85. Meyerowitz's music, which is 
lyrical and dramatic, often combines a neoclassical sense of structure 
with touches of chromaticism that gives it a modern sensibility. He 
was drawn to subjects that raised moral or humanistic questions or 
that looked at the contemporary world through the prism of Bible stories. 
His second opera, ``The Barrier'' (1949), has a libretto by Langston 
Hughes, based on his play ``The Mulatto,'' and looks at racial issues 
in the South. Hughes also supplied a libretto for ``Esther'' (1956), 
about the biblical queen. The story of Esther, who saved her people 
from the genocidal plans of Haman, clearly fascinated Meyerowitz, 
who had spent World War II in hiding with the help of friends in the 
French and Italian Resistance. Besides the opera, he wrote a symphony, 
``Midrash Esther,'' inspired by rabbinical commentary and entirely 
separate from the operatic score. Dimitri Mitropoulos led the New 
York Philharmonic in the premiere of the work in 1957. Meyerowitz 
was born in 1913 in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland), and studied 
until 1933 at the Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin. He continued his 
studies in Rome, where Respighi and Alfredo Casella were among his 
teachers. In the late 1930s he made his way to Belgium and France. 
When the war ended, several French musicians _ including the flutist 
Jean-Pierre Rampal and the pianist Yvonne Loriod _ performed his works 
in concerts and radio broadcasts. He married a French musician, Marguerite 
Fricker, who survives him. Meyerowitz moved to New York in 1946. He 
worked as an assistant to Boris Goldovsky at the Berkshire Music Center 
at Tanglewood, Mass., and later joined the faculty there and at Brooklyn 
College and City College. He also established himself quickly as a 
composer. ``The Barrier'' had its premiere on Broadway in January 
1950, and was revived at several Italian opera houses in the 1970s 
and at the Darmstadt Staatsoper in Germany in 1996. Besides ``Esther,'' 
his other operas were ``Simoon'' (1949); ``Eastward in Eden'' (1951), 
later renamed for its subject, Emily Dickinson; ``Bad Boys in School'' 
(1952); ``Port Town'' (1960), also with a libretto by Hughes; ``Godfather 
Death'' (1961), and ``Winterballade'' (1967). Among Meyerowitz's instrumental 
works were concertos for flute and oboe, sonatas for violin and cello, 
works for small string and brass ensembles, and several full orchestra 
works. He also wrote an ecumenical collection of liturgical works 
that included Jewish works, like the ``Hebrew Service'' (1962), and 
Christian ones, like the Easter cantata ``The Glory Around His Head'' 
(1955) and the ``Missa Rachel Plorans'' (1954).
