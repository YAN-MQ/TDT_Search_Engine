The man accused of masterminding the August bombings of U.S. embassies 
in africa says he had no prior knowledge of the attacks. Exiled Saudi 
dissident osama bin laden reportedly made those remarks in an interview 
with a Pakistani news agency. Bin laden said he first heard about 
the bombings through media reports, but he's not sorry they occurred. 
This was his first public statement about the attacks. The blasts 
in Tanzania and Kenya killed a total of 224 people.
