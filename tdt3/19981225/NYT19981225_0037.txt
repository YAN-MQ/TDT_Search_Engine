In an age when advanced technology and generous budgets are giving 
filmmakers the ability to create images and scenes they once could 
only dream of, they are also creating a growing burden: the pressure 
for authenticity. Movies, even the most fanciful, need not be real, 
but they generally must be believable. So whether they are delving 
into outer space, history or pure legend, Hollywood's fiction spinners 
are increasingly turning not just to marketing wizards but to scholars 
and other experts as well to help sell their ideas. Movies ranging 
from holiday releases like ``The Prince of Egypt'' and ``Shakespeare 
in Love'' to blockbusters like ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Deep 
Impact'' have relied on experts to help create the sense of verisimilitude 
that filmmakers regard as an essential ingredient of success. For 
the hired brains? Tinseltown can make a dream or break it. ``I had 
my own little director's chair with my name on it,'' said Gerry Griffin, 
a retired flight director at NASA who worked on ``Contact,'' in which 
an astronomer played by Jodie Foster enters an alien-designed vessel 
that travels to another galaxy. He said he had worked almost every 
day with the director, Robert Zemeckis, to get dozens of details right. 
``We were almost literally attached at the hip.'' David N. Freedman, 
a biblical scholar at the University of California at San Diego, has 
a more skeptical view. A leading expert on the Book of Exodus, Freedman 
was one of scores of biblical experts consulted for the animated ``Prince 
of Egypt.'' ``People like me are the window dressing,'' he said. ``They 
invite us to come in to look and they don't really listen to us.'' 
``I had no trouble lending them my name and I recommend the movie,'' 
he added. ``I found the characters generally well done. The crossing 
of the Red Sea was sensational. But I'm a movie addict. I could hardly 
name you three movies I didn't like.'' Dreamworks, which produced 
the movie, has said it listened carefully to the experts it consulted. 
Scholars are not entertainers, and filmmakers make no pretense at 
being scholars, which is why there can be friction in the relationship 
between Hollywood and academia. The crucial need, several filmmakers 
explained, is the appearance of reality. That means that they rely 
on advisers mainly to provide signposts or shortcuts, not truths to 
which they must remain wholly faithful. In ``Apollo 13,'' his movie 
about a real crisis in space, the director Ron Howard consulted former 
astronauts and other experts, including Griffin. They provided, he 
said, an overwhelming amount of detail about the way NASA worked. 
``Every once in a while I had to say, `I just can't show that,''' 
Howard said. ``With the director, the buck stops. I had to make the 
decisions. I cut myself some slack fairly early on and put my focus 
on the audience's reaction to things, not just getting every detail 
right.'' Nevertheless, Griffin said he influenced numerous details, 
particularly the terse dialogue between flight control and the astronauts. 
He also said he quieted down the activity in the flight-control center 
in the movie. ``One of the things about a control room is it's a little 
like watching grass grow,'' Griffin said. ``He had his looking like 
a fire drill or something with so much motion. I just tried to get 
him to tone it down.'' Howard said he felt the effort paid off in 
several respects. ``Audiences really liked the lingo and enjoyed catching 
on to the lingo,'' said the director, who added that the actors also 
felt they could perform better when they were going through genuine 
procedures. ``The actors became so engrossed in getting it right that 
they would go through the whole procedure sometimes even if we were 
only filming a small portion,'' Howard said. In ``Shakespeare in Love,'' 
a flight of fancy that supposes that the playwright transformed ``Romeo 
and Juliet'' from a mediocre play to one of genius under the influence 
of a love affair, a Harvard professor is said to have played a tiny, 
but critical part. Marc Norman, one of the screenwriters, said he 
consulted Stephen Greenblatt, a Shakespeare scholar, to make sure 
that at least the framework of his story followed what was known about 
Shakespeare's life. ``I needed some sort of firm ground, some confidence,'' 
Norman said. ``The great thing about writing about Shakespeare is 
that everyone in the world knows him and there are about five facts.'' 
But Norman added that he was after an appearance of reality only: 
``I would say the semblance of authenticity was more important than 
authenticity. I would like to think there is a creative truth in the 
picture that we adhere to, not historical truth.'' The flirtation 
between life and fiction can be tantalizing. The horror picture ``Urban 
Legends,'' for instance, is about a murderer who kills by fulfilling 
everyday fables passed by word of mouth. These include everything 
from tales of women getting drugged in bars and then waking up in 
strange apartments with their kidneys stolen to one that eating a 
certain fizzy candy while drinking soda can be lethal. ``Because the 
whole background to the story is, `Is it true or not?,' it was really 
important that the movie be as true to the folklore as we could be,'' 
said Gina Matthews, the producer of ``Urban Legends.'' ``That's what 
gave the movie credibility and ultimately made it so frightening.'' 
``Everything in the movie had to seem real or it would just have been 
a farce,'' she said. So the filmmakers consulted Peter Takofsky, a 
professor of folklore at the University of California at Los Angeles, 
to make sure that they got their legends right rather than ask if 
the legends were rooted in any truths. The issue of authenticity also 
can become a weapon in competition between films. This year there 
were two movies about a collision between Earth and a celestial object. 
``Deep Impact'' involves an approaching comet and ``Armageddon'' has 
an asteroid careering calamitously toward Earth. In both movies manned 
spacecraft intercept these huge masses and blow them apart with nuclear 
bombs, a trick that several experts said was probably impossible. 
``We started from hard facts,'' said Joan Bradshaw, one of the executive 
producers of ``Deep Impact.'' ``We wanted to make science fact as 
opposed to science fiction.'' Josh Colwell, an astronomer at the University 
of Colorado, said he told the ``Deep Impact'' team that it would take 
far longer than depicted in the movie's time frame to determine if 
a comet was on a collision course with Earth _ particularly because 
the paths of comets are difficult to predict. He also said that any 
effort to intercept a comet would rely on unmanned rockets. Colwell 
added that the size of the tidal wave caused by the impact of the 
comet with Earth, as conceived by the filmmakers, was too big and 
that he urged them to make it smaller, which they did. Still, he said, 
if a comet was broken up so close to Earth, its impact over all would 
be far more catastrophic than the one depicted in the movie because 
of the velocity and energy involved. But hey, it is only a movie.
