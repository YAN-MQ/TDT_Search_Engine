Christians are celebrating the joyous holiday of Christmas, marking 
the birth of Jesus Christ. In Bethlehem, the town where Jesus was 
born, believers filled the Church of the Nativity for services. This 
American family was in Bethlehem for the festivities. It was great. 
It was really pretty, like the Churches. We've been here many times. 
And it's just the same every time. Very commercial. The birth of Jesus 
is what is Christmas is to me. And that he's alive in my heart. At 
the Vatican, Pope John Paul prayed for peace, and called for an end 
to the death penalty. Cubans have celebrated Christmas as a day off 
from work. After the government restored the holiday to the official 
national list. The government stopped official observance of the holiday 
in 1969. Saying at that time, that it interfered with the sugar harvest.
