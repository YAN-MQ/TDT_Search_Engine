Ukraine's parliament on Friday postponed debate of the government's 
1999 budget draft until next week after deputies failed to agree on 
the projected deficit. Communists and their allies voted against the 
proposed deficit of 1 percent of the gross domestic product, arguing 
that the budget draft the Cabinet had proposed for debate in the second 
reading differed from targets earlier approved by lawmakers. No decision 
was made about when the budget debate would be resumed. Parliament 
initially approved the 1999 draft budget on its first reading earlier 
in December, raising the government's original revenue target by nearly 
50 percent and limiting the deficit to zero. The Cabinet, however, 
strongly objected to parliament's move and restored the budget's primary 
targets practically to the original ones. The draft debated Friday 
provided for revenues of 23.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 6.83 billion) and 
expenditures of 24.6 billion hryvna (dlrs 7.18 billion), with annual 
inflation forecast at 19 percent. Finance Minister Ihor Mitiukov, 
who presented the budget to lawmakers, argued that with Ukraine's 
economy expected to further decline by 1 percent in 1999 and with 
mounting debt obligations, the former Soviet republic cannot count 
on revenues and expenditures as high as parliament wanted. He also 
said the deficit of 1 percent was ``acceptable and absolutely safe'' 
and was needed to allow the government more money to cover the huge 
wage and pension arrears. ``We must approve this budget in order to 
preserve economic and social stability,'' Mitiukov said. Ukraine's 
government has consistently failed to implement reforms since gaining 
independence in 1991, bringing on continuous economic decline, mounting 
wage arrears and a huge foreign debt. The government raised only 63 
percent of planned annual revenues in the first 11 months of 1998, 
while its debt in unpaid wages and pensions has steadily grown to 
more than 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 875 million), according to official 
statistics.
