Christmas morning brought a scene of horror in this central Dutch 
town: the charred bodies of a mother and her three young children. 
Police said all four had been murdered. Firefighters responding to 
a blaze in the family home found the burned bodies of the mother and 
the youngsters, who ranged in ages from three to 11, Dutch television 
reported Friday. Neighbors said they heard a terrible quarrel in the 
home before the morning fire, destroying the house. Authorities said 
the killer apparently set fire to the house to cover his tracks. Dutch 
television said the father was the prime suspect in the slayings, 
but that shortly after the blaze began, he was killed in a head-on 
car crash on a nearby highway. The driver of the other vehicle was 
seriously injured. Police would not confirm whether the man killed 
in the crash was the father, or comment on whether his death might 
have been a suicide. The victims' identities were not released in 
line with Dutch privacy laws. Wageningen is a university town in the 
central Netherlands, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Amsterdam. 
Last New Year's Eve, three people were shot dead at a private party 
there.
