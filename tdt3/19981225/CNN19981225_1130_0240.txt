Freezing rain across many southern states has disrupted the travel 
plans of millions of people. Among them, hundreds of passengers at 
a Greyhound bus terminal in nashville, Tennessee. Air some Roston 
has their story. For some people, trying to get to their families 
for Christmas, the storm meant they slept on dirty and cold floors. 
That's if they slept at all. Here at the Nashville bus terminal, travelers 
were stranded because of slick and dangerous ice along the roads. 
You wouldn't believe it. I came from St. Louis, Missouri, on my way 
to Memphis, Tennessee. And I wind up here and I've been here ever 
since 9:00 yesterday morning. Martha jarrett of St. Louis, Missouri, 
waited 24 hours. 70-year-old Ruth pettis was waiting for a bus to 
Mississippi. She says the long and frustrating wait brought some people 
together. Oh, yeah, I've been, made friends with these people since 
I've been here. See, I like to make friends. Can't blame the weather, 
really. I knew it was raining, I knew the weather was going to be 
bad. When I left Memphis, it was already icy. After day broke, the 
ice on the road was so slippery, even walking was tough. Workers began 
chipping away. And dropping salt. In this area, they're not used to 
weather like this and they don't have to do this very often. Hello. 
At last, the bus drivers came, greeted like the cavalry. Greyhound 
said the conditions were getting better. Passengers began to board 
the buses for Tallahassee, for Chicago, for dallas, for Kentucky. 
I'm just so happy to be going home. That's all, real happy to be going 
home. Going to see my little girl, my wife, ain't seen everybody in 
a while. After a long day and nirkts passengers finally got on their 
way. Arum Roston, CNN, Nashville, Tennessee.
