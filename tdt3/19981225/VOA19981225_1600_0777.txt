Under a bright winter sun, Pope John Paul II addressed millions of 
people around the world from the balcony overlooking St. Peter's square 
on Friday, Christmas Day. The Pope spoke of the world's many problems. 
Which are in strident contrast with the serenity of Christmas. Sebina 
Castle-Franco reports from Rome. Pope John Paul II appeared a little 
tired today when he addressed the thousands gathered in St. Peter's 
Square. For the traditional Urbi et Orbi message. But he was given 
a warm welcome with shouts of joy and applause by the thousands of 
different nationalities who turned out to hear his message. "May the 
joy of Christmas instill in all trust in the power of truth," the 
Pope told the crowd. He also turned his thoughts to the world's problems. 
Urging man not to become resigned to existing tormented and distressing 
situations. The Pope expressed the hope that Christmas may be a sense 
of encouragement toward those who work to bring relief to the suffering 
people in the Middle East. In his message, the Pope also called for 
stronger consensus throughout the world on the need for adequate measures 
to halt the production and sales of arms to defend human life and 
to end the death penalty. The Pope then gave his Christmas greetings 
in over 50 different languages. May the joy of Christmas and the peace 
with the guide of the Savior's reach into the world. Believe in your 
hearts for it. Pope John Paul now turns a few days of rest at the 
people's residence outside of Rome. But nevertheless, turns to say 
mass there on Saturday to mark the feast of St. Stephen. Sebina Castle-Franco, 
for VOA News, Rome.
