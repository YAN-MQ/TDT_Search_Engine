Authorities have executed 11 people for drug trafficking in the southern 
Chinese city of Shenzhen near Hong Kong, a Shenzhen newspaper reported. 
The Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court sentenced a total of 17 people 
for trafficking drugs in seven different cases, the Shenzhen Special 
Zone Daily reported Thursday. The six who escaped death sentences 
were given life prison terms, the paper said. One of those executed, 
20-year-old Zhuang Jianyong, had arranged with a dealer for the sale 
of 400 grams (14 ounces) of heroin at a travel agency, it said. Police 
arrested Zhuang and an accomplice at the scene and confiscated 390 
(13.6 ounces) grams of heroin, the newspaper reported. Zhuang and 
10 others were executed by gunshot immediately after their sentencing 
on Wednesday, it added. The severe sentences are seen as evidence 
of the Chinese government's determination to curb the fast-growing 
trade in illegal drugs. China uses the death penalty more liberally 
than any other nation. London-based Amnesty International recorded 
1,876 court-ordered executions last year, more than the combined total 
for the rest of the world.
