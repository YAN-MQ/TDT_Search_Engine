The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 26: Two 
years ago, Congress gave the nation's broadcasters a $70 billion national 
asset by awarding them, without charge, additional channels for broadcasting 
digital signals, including high-definition television. This huge giveaway 
barely made a ripple on the evening news. It was not until the Senate 
majority leader at the time, Bob Dole, bravely complained about ``corporate 
welfare'' to the big media corporations that Congress and the communications 
megapowers agreed that yes, of course, the public should indeed get 
something back from the broadcasters. The White House offered to create 
a commission named after Vice President Gore to hash out the possibilities. 
Unfortunately, that is what the Gore commission has now returned _ 
a hash of proposals, a vague jumble of voluntary suggestions. In effect, 
the public-interest advocates on the commission were divided over 
how best to pay back the public for handing over these airwaves, and 
the broadcasters conquered. What makes this confusion so disturbing 
is that without a committed focus on how they must serve the public 
trust, these media companies can all too easily fall into the gravitational 
force of ratings, bottom lines and stock prices. Under such pressures, 
too many broadcasters could shove political debates or educational 
programs into the night-watch hours or drop such programs altogether. 
For those looking for solutions, the commission report must be read 
as a list of suggestions that need more debate and detail. One recommendation 
deserving more investigation would eventually double the number of 
public television channels in most communities. When broadcasters 
complete the transition to digital, the law now says they must return 
their old analog channels over which they broadcast free now. Although 
some critics fear that Congress will eventually allow the broadcasters 
to stall the return of these channels, the commission has suggested 
that when the time comes to return them, only public television stations 
should be able to keep both _ the new digital and the old analog channels. 
As this digital system becomes reality, operators are also learning 
that instead of one high-definition channel, they can break the signal 
into six or more channels. The Federal Communications Commission should 
consider a suggestion that if broadcasters engage in this ``multiplexing,'' 
they be required to pay for using all the channels or use some for 
education or public-interest programs. Finally, the commission suggests 
a voluntary system of giving five minutes of free time a night to 
political candidates in the month before elections. Five minutes a 
night would be a major increase in political coverage for some local 
stations that turn to politics only when they run out of crime. But 
the question is whether people who resist giving candidates their 
due _ unless they pay for ads _ would parcel out even these mite-sized 
time slots voluntarily. The FCC should require at least some free 
air time for candidates in exchange for all these free channels to 
broadcasters.
