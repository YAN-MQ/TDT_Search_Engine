This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" from Christmas evening into Saturday evening. Our forecast 
calls for things to begin to improve in the southeastern U.S. as high 
pressure builds in and the low-pressure center moves away from the 
east coast. But still some lingering clouds and perhaps an icy mix 
overnight tonight. Across the Great Lakes, we'll see some snow. Low 
pressure into the northern plains will produce some snow showers. 
And in the northwest, could be some heavy rains. Coastal Oregon, northern 
California with snow in the mountains as another system pushes into 
that region. Today's highs, single numbers and teens across the north-central 
part of the country. Mostly 40s and 50s in the south. We'll see some 
60s developing in the southwest, 70s over southern Florida. Looking 
ahead to Sunday, look for rain in the northwest, snow showers around 
the Great Lakes. On Monday, rain and snow through the Great Lakes 
with some thunderstorms possible in the south. And also rain and snow 
across the northwest. And on Tuesday, wet in the east. Things are 
a little warmer across the south. Don't forget, four-day forecasts 
at CNN.com.
