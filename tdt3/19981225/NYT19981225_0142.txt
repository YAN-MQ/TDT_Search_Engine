Irene Hervey, who secured her place as one of Hollywood's most beautiful 
leading ladies after playing Jimmy Stewart's love interest in the 
1939 western ``Destry Rides Again,'' died on Sunday at the hospital 
of the Motion Picture and Television Fund in Woodland Hills, Calif. 
She was 89 and lived in Los Angeles. With her wide-eyed, dimpled good 
looks, Miss Hervey, who was born in Venice, Calif., became a contract 
player at MGM in 1933, where she played featured roles in movies and 
short subjects until she became a free-lance actress in the mid-1930s. 
She then joined Universal Pictures from 1938 to 1943, where she appeared 
in ``Destry Rides Again'' with Stewart and Marlene Dietrich. In her 
prime, Miss Hervey appeared with some of Hollywood's major names, 
including Bing Crosby in ``East Side of Heaven,'' Lionel Barrymore 
in ``The Stranger's Return,'' Alan Ladd in ``Chicago Deadline,'' Raymond 
Burr in ``A Cry in the Night,'' Burgess Meredith in ``San Francisco 
Docks'' and William Powell in ``Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid.'' Miss 
Hervey also had roles in the films ``The Count of Monte Cristo,'' 
``Frisco Lil,'' ``Cactus Flower'' and ``Play Misty for Me.'' She starred 
in the Broadway production and national company of ``State of the 
Union'' in the late 1940s. She moved into television, appearing in 
such popular series as ``Family Affair,'' ``Twilight Zone,'' ``Perry 
Mason,'' ``The Wide Country,'' ``Richard Diamond, Private Detective'' 
and ``Charlie's Angels.'' She starred as Aunt Meg in the hit series 
``Honey West'' with Anne Francis and received an Emmy nomination for 
a guest appearance on ``My Three Sons.'' Miss Hervey's marriage to 
the actor Allan Jones ended in divorce in 1957. She is survived by 
a daughter, Gail Christensen of Los Angeles, and a son, Jack Jones 
of Indian Wells, Calif.
