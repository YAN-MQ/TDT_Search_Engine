During his traditional Christmas message in Rome, Pope John Paul called 
for a worldwide ban on the death penalty and also prayed for the success 
of the Mid East peace agreement. And in the Mid East, Palestinian 
Leader Yeassir Arafat joined thousands of people celebrating Christmas 
in the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Des Duset reports from Jerusalem. 
In Bethlehem, Christmas celebrations are festive blend of religion 
and nationalism. The city is now one vast construction site as it 
prepares for Bethlehem 2000 the start of a year long calendar events 
for the Millennium. 1999 also marks the end of the five year Oslo 
peace process when Palestinians hope to see the establishment of their 
own state. For now Bethlehem is still surrounded by a ring of steel, 
Israeli military check points when control all the approaches to the 
city. Palestinians can not travel to nearby Jerusalem with a permit 
and the economy is often choked by Israeli closure and a sharp fall 
in tourism whenever violence erupts. Des Duset reporting.
