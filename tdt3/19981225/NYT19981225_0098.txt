He is the only linebacker still playing from that 1986 Giants Super 
Bowl team. Indeed, he is the only current Jet who was with Bill Parcells 
on both of his championship outfits. That, says the 34-year-old Pepper 
Johnson, means something this week as he gets ready for one more installment 
in the stretch run that has gone so well and will continue into January. 
Perhaps there is also some nostalgia on Johnson's part, for Sunday 
could be his final regular-season game as a Jet. ``If there's one 
thing guys have to be conscious of right now,'' he says, in his role 
as elder statesman, ``it's don't get anxiety attacks. Don't go out 
there too excited running around.'' He contradicts himself, though, 
when he thinks of the regular-season finale _ against the New England 
Patriots. To players like Johnson _ who never played for the Patriots 
_ this game is stirring emotions. Just the sort of emotions, he claims 
he is trying to calm on the younger players. He wants them ready for 
the playoffs and behaving in a certain way. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) 
Just this week he was looking at Giant films from the 1980s, and reminiscing 
about that great linebacker crew and how it was the backbone of the 
defense. ``I was reliving Harry and George and L.T. and Banks,'' he 
said of Harry Carson and George Martin and Lawrence Taylor and Carl 
Banks, all of them linebackers except Martin, who played on the defensive 
line. ``I had a luxury going to the Giants,'' Johnson said of the 
team he joined as a rookie in 1986, after being drafted in the second 
round out of Ohio State. ``I took Harry's mentality when he played 
NFC East teams _ he wore elbow pads to stop the runners _ as opposed 
to playing passive teams. I saw how Lawrence willed himself to make 
big plays, how Carl ran over everything in his way.'' He recalled 
how Steve DeOssie, another Giants linebacker, felt ``no one could 
beat him.'' ``I credit all these guys with the mentality I have right 
now,'' Johnson said. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) But these days on the field, 
he alternates quarters with a younger player, Dwayne Gordon. Although 
Johnson has told everyone who will listen that he should be a full-time 
player, he doesn't allow those emotions to affect his thoughts about 
the Patriots. This is a game in which victory provides no immediate 
benefits to the Jets, who _ win or lose _ will finish with the second-best 
record in the American Football Conference and get a first-round playoff 
bye. But there are other factors involved _ such as the chance to 
produce the first 12-victory season in Jets history, the chance to 
finish the season with a six-game victory streak, the chance to earn 
incentive bonuses. For Johnson, outweighing everything else is the 
continuing rivalry between the Jets and the Patriots, a rivalry that 
has everything to do with Bill Parcells bolting New England to come 
back to the Meadowlands. ``It's personal,'' he says of the Jets' approach 
to Sunday. ``It's a pride thing. There's going to be a lot of trash-talking, 
pushing after plays, holding.'' Not by him, you understand, but by 
everyone else. But why? ``The split,'' he explains, referring to Parcells' 
controversial departure from the Patriots after the 1996 season. ``They 
have the majority of players from the Parcells era. We have the coaches.'' 
But the Jets also have eight players who played for Parcells on the 
Patriots. ``The feelings players have in this locker room for Coach 
Parcells and Coach Belichick, they're going to play harder,'' Johnson 
said. Johnson was part of the two Super Bowl defenses that Bill Belichick 
_ the master defensive coordinator _ put together for Parcells on 
the Giants, but Johnson missed out on 1996, when the two coaches joined 
forces again in New England and took the Patriots all the way to Super 
Bowl. Johnson spent that season in Detroit, starting 12 games at middle 
linebacker. But after Parcells took over the Jets, with Belichick 
as his main assistant, Johnson came aboard as a free agent and then 
started the first eight games last season before a torn quadriceps 
tendon sidelined him for the season. Then, this past summer, Johnson 
made a pre-retirement locker-room announcement. This was going to 
be it, he claimed. He would come back only if Parcells or Belichick 
want him back. Parcells always has been fond of Johnson. It is not 
merely the three charities Johnson is involved with back in Detroit. 
Parcells describes Johnson as the sort of person who is always helping 
others _ friends, family, strangers. ``Sometimes,'' says the coach, 
``he tries to do too much.'' But Parcells, for all the respect he 
has for Johnson, for all the times they shared, did not even think 
he would be back this year. Or did he? Parcells announced to reporters 
before the season began that Johnson ought to consider that the train 
might be pulling into the station for the final time. ``I went to 
his office over the summer,'' Johnson recalled, ``and he was talking 
like I might not be able to make it back.'' But did Parcells want 
Johnson to pack it in, or was he just trying to motivate him? Johnson 
smiled. ``With Bill,'' he said, ``you never know.'' In the end, Johnson 
did return and Parcells decided to give him breathers. ``I want to 
keep him alive,'' Parcells said. Johnson has fumed, though, at sharing 
time with Gordon. Now, asked whether he will return, Johnson says, 
``I'm almost banking it on how Coach Parcells feels _ if he wants 
me back.'' In other words, if he's not a Jet, he will retire? ``I 
didn't say that,'' he said. ``If somebody else gives me a call, that's 
a different story.''
