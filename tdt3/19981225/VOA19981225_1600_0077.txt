British tycoon Richard Branson and two other adventurers have brought 
their balloon down in the Pacific, off Hawaii. Aborting their quest 
to make the first around-the-world balloon flight. Poor weather conditions 
caused three adventurers to end their quest. Spokesman Mike Hendrichs 
says the three adventurers are in good spirits. Although a little 
disappointed about the forced landing. We are very sorry to let everyone 
down. Per's asked us to deliver some pizzas with Hawaiian toppings. 
And so their sense of humor is good. I think everything's fine. They're 
professionals. They'll handle this properly. The balloon was forced 
to land after running into slow-moving air. Meaning it could not cross 
the Pacific in any reasonable amount of time.
