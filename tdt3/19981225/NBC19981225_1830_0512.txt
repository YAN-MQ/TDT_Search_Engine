Up next, it's a wet Christmas for three adventures. They're attempt 
to circle the globe in a balloon ends. I have made three attempts 
to fly around the world in 1998. It's getting discouraging. A splashy 
ending to the latest unsuccessful balloon adventure. I love being 
out in the sun. It makes me feel so alive. Now I really enjoy being 
outdoors because I've discovered this new lotion... that's been awarded 
the skin cancer foundation seal, designed for women our age. This 
SPF 15 formula with intense vitamin-enriched moisture... helps protect 
maturing skin from future U.V. damage. It minimizes, even helps prevent, 
age spots. And the name? Provital protective moisture lotion from 
oil of Olay. Proven to help you look revitalized.
