Many of our local FM and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. You know, Les, on this Christmas 
Day, it is interesting to think about the story that we just heard 
from Susan Loag about Charles Dickens' "Christmas Carol." The enduring 
piece of literature that it is. And it's the way that it influenced 
our language in so many ways. Just a few moments ago, we had a kind 
of a humorous exchange out in the news room when one of our colleagues 
came in grumbling about something, and we called him Ebeneezer Scrooge. 
And the phrase "Bah Humbug," which is of course a line that Ebeneezer 
repeats throughout the play is something that we all use these days 
if we're trying to make a point about somebody being in a bad mood. 
So it really is something that we see all the time. Sure. And even 
the term Scrooge itself, has become synonymous with anyone who is 
tight-fisted with their money, or miserly. Or grumpy. And grumpy. 
Including all of it. And the ghostly aspect of it too, has come into 
our existence quite a bit too. I think yes, that phrase: "Is this 
the ghost of Christmas past?" And Tiny Tim. The notion of that its 
something that somehow works its way into the language. And representing 
goodness. Always seems to run - Tiny Tim. Good fellow. And what's 
the lovely line that he has at the end? "And a Merry Christmas to 
us, one and all?" Isn't that it? One and all. Yes. "A Merry Christmas 
to us, one and all." It is, Universal time. This is VOA News Now. 
Serbian forces backed by tanks and artillery have swept through ethnic 
Albanian villages in Northern Kosovo. Russia's lower house of Parliament 
gives initial approval to an austerity budget for next year. Saudi 
militant Usamah Bin Laden denies he was involved in the bombing of 
two American embassies in Africa last August. We'll have these and 
other stories in this next half hour of VOA News Now. Hello again 
from Washington. I'm Charlene Porter, along with Les Carpenter.
