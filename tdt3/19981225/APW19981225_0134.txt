Iraq's official press lashed out at France on Friday, accusing it 
of failing to support Baghdad during the airstrikes and saying its 
latest proposals were hostile. Al-Thawra, the official newspaper of 
the ruling Baath Party, said France knew that the United States and 
Britain were going to attack Iraq several weeks before the Dec. 16-19 
attacks, ``and they did not object to it.'' ``France is not totally 
innocent of the aggression, and its latest recommendations are no 
less than part of the aggression. It is the French way out of the 
Anglo-American problem,'' Al-Thawra said in a front-page editorial. 
France objected to the airstrikes that were undertaken to punish Iraq 
for its alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors. The French 
Foreign Ministry criticized the report of the chief weapons inspector 
_ whose findings prompted the United States and Britain to attack 
_ for a lack of clarity. The inspectors were charged with overseeing 
the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a process Iraq 
must complete before the U.N. Security Council will lift the sanctions 
imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Earlier this week, French 
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine proposed a restructuring of the weapons 
inspectorate to put the emphasis on ``continuous control'' of Iraq's 
manufacturing of arms. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has 
rejected Vedrine's suggestion, saying the issue was to lift the sanctions. 
Al-Thawra ended its editorial by reminding France of ``what it would 
lose if it lost Iraq.'' Before the 1991 Gulf War, in which French 
forces helped drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait, France enjoyed close 
relations with Iraq. Baghdad still has enormous debts to France and 
French oil companies are known to want to reinvest in Iraq once sanctions 
are lifted.
