Frustrated by slack winds, three adventurers trying to make the first 
nonstop round-the-world flight in a balloon abandoned their quest 
Friday, splashing down in the shark-infested waters off Honolulu. 
All three men were rescued by the Coast Guard and were reported in 
good condition. The men were brought ashore at Barbers Point, about 
10 miles (16 kms) west of Honolulu, by two Coast Guard helicopters. 
After climbing out of the choppers, they smiled and chatted with the 
ground crews. U.S. customs inspectors were waiting to meet them and 
have them sign the customs declaration forms required of all those 
entering the United States. The men _ British mogul Richard Branson, 
American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden _ 
quit halfway through the journey after they lost the high-altitude, 
high-speed winds they needed to carry them across Pacific to North 
America. They had traveled 12,500 miles (20,100 kms) before getting 
caught in a low-pressure system and called off the trip, fearing they 
would be stuck there for a week.
