Five years after the United Nations organized landmark elections in 
Cambodia, former U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali pledged Friday to 
push for more aid to the struggling nation. Arriving in Phnom Penh 
on a tour of former French colonies in Indochina, Boutros-Ghali was 
expected to promote the use of the French language as secretary general 
of the International Francophone Organization. ``There is now a new 
reconciliation between the different leaders of the country and I 
hope to be able to offer more cooperation through the International 
Francophone Organization,'' Boutros-Ghali said. Boutros-Ghali, an 
Egyptian diplomat, was U.N. secretary general when the United Nations 
dispatched 20,000 peacekeepers and spent dlrs 2 billion to hold elections 
in Cambodia in 1993. The elections resulted in an awkward joint premiership 
by longtime rivals Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh that collapsed 
in July 1997 when the prince was toppled in a bloody coup. On Friday, 
Boutros-Ghali praised the recent formation of a new government _ formed 
following months of wrangling after new elections in July _ and said 
he would work to provide more assistance for Cambodia. The new agreement, 
under which Hun Sen is prime minister and the prince is president 
of the National Assembly, has paved the way for a resumption of aid 
sharply curtailed after last year's coup. Boutros-Ghali, who spent 
the past several days in Laos, another former French colony, is scheduled 
to meet both Hun Sen and Ranariddh during his five-day visit. French 
remains more widely spoken in Cambodia than in Laos or Vietnam and 
is the preferred language of King Norodom Sihanouk, the prince's father. 
French-language education is slipping among younger Cambodians, however, 
who generally prefer to learn English.
