When the Senate reconvenes next month it must decide what to do with 
articles of impeachment passed by the house against President Clinton. 
Among the options being considered is a controversial one, censure. 
Bob Franken looks at the debate. While the president is through buying 
Christmas gifts, his supporters are still shopping for a censure deal. 
Occasionally, the delicate, behind-the-scenes scramble goes public. 
Listen to vice President Gore. The president has said he did not lie 
under oath. He has acknowledged that he gave statements that were 
less than helpful to his interrogators and that he was misleading, 
but that's a very different proposition. If that's a signal the president 
will not change his tune, that could be a big problem. Many senators 
have made it clear any censure resolution must include what amounts 
to a perjury confession. There are many on both sides who believe 
the president has to come clean here. House majority whip Tom delay, 
who says there is overwhelming evidence against the president, warns 
too many are moving too fast towards censure. And he's not the only 
one. I believe we owe it to this president to prove his innocence 
and for the country's sake and for history's sake to prove his innocence 
if he can. Still, Smith favors leaving censure as an option. But there 
are also those who argue that by pursuing a censure deal, senators 
are avoiding their constitutional responsibility. The choice is remove 
this president from office or let him go. Now that is what the framers 
wanted, but the members of Congress don't much like that, because 
that politically leaves them in a very difficult situation. What many 
here are really trying to do is to get this over with as soon as possible. 
The voters have made it abundantly clear that's what they want, so 
this is not only a danger to the Clinton presidency, but a danger 
to the political careers of just about everyone involved. Bob Franken, 
CNN, Capitol Hill.
