Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the militant Hamas group, 
on Friday denounced the visit earlier this month of U.S. President 
Bill Clinton as an attempt to destroy Palestinian unity. Yassin's 
appearance at a rally to mark the 11th anniversary of Hamas' founding 
was his first major appearance since being released Wednesday from 
two months of house arrest. Yasser Arafat's government put the charismatic 
sheik under house arrest in October, after Hamas tried to blow up 
a school bus full of Jewish children in the Gaza Strip. Arafat's dealings 
with Hamas have been difficult: Israel demands that he act strongly 
contain Islamic militants who stage attacks against Israel, but the 
Palestinian leader is reluctant to alienate Yassin's following. At 
the Gaza City refugee camp where the rally was held, a crowd of at 
least 10,000 people turned out, chanting ``Yassin! Yassin!'' and struggled 
to touch the jeep in which he was driven through the crowd. When the 
jeep stopped, followers lifted the ailing cleric's wheelchair and 
carried him to the stage. Representatives of Arafat's more moderate 
leadership participated in the rally, perhaps to try to balance out 
to the more militant message of Hamas, which opposes any peace with 
Israel. Hani Hassan, of Arafat's Fatah faction, praised Clinton's 
visit to the Palestinian lands as a show of support for Palestinian 
statehood. But Yassin called Clinton an enemy. ``I want to ask, what 
did Clinton do for us during his visit? The purpose of his visit to 
the region was ... to destroy Palestinian unity and the Palestinian 
dream,'' he told the screaming crowd. Touching on another sore point, 
Yassin called on the Palestinian Authority to release Hamas activists 
from its jails and to root out corruption within its ranks. The sheik 
also criticized the Palestinian Authority for arresting Palestinian 
journalists last week to try to prevent them from covering pro-Iraq 
rallies. Despite the size of the rally and the stridency of the speeches, 
Hamas was treading carefully. A Palestinian police official said the 
radical group was told not to burn American flags or let masked demonstrators 
appear at the rally. More moderate demonstrations also took place 
Friday in the West Bank town of Beit Sahur, where 2,000 Palestinians 
marched with 150 Israeli peace activists demanding peace and the creation 
of a Palestinian state. Marchers released white pigeons as a symbol 
of peace.
