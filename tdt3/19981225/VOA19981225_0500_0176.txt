Angola's UNITA rebels shelled the city of Kuito Thursday in an attack 
that follows days of losses around the city to Angolan government 
troops. The Portuguese Lusa news agency says government forces have 
regained control of the airport, and driven UNITA ground forces out 
of a number of towns near Kuito. Lusa says Angolan army officers fear 
Thursday's shelling means UNITA has decided to launch an all-out counter 
offensive aimed at taking Kuito.
