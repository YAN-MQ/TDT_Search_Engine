A rebel attack on the highland city of Kuito killed and wounded dozens 
of people, some sheltering in a Roman Catholic church, but Christmas 
service in the town went ahead Friday during a lull in the shelling, 
church workers said. Thirty people were killed and 37 were wounded 
Thursday in the heaviest rebel attack on the besieged city since fighting 
between UNITA rebels and the government flared anew early this month, 
the private Radio Eclesia reported. Nine of the dead were killed when 
mortar fire hit a Roman Catholic church in Kuito's outskirts, the 
Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted military sources as saying. It 
was not known whether Christmas services were held in this church.
