What James Edward Brighton knows for sure is that sometime after midnight 
on Oct. 12 he awoke in a Montreal parking lot, naked, dazed and without 
a clue to who he was or how he got there. He was brought to Montreal 
General Hospital. After hypnosis and injections of a ``truth serum,'' 
he told doctors that he thought he was from Morristown, N.J.; he thought 
his name was James Edward Brighton; he thought he was about 28 years 
old, and he thought he was gay. But without identification papers, 
he is afraid to cross the border into the United States to find out 
more about his background. Montreal police have contacted the FBI 
and Interpol, but to no avail. Police in Morristown were also asked 
to help. Detective Sgt. Mark Slockbower said the young man's description 
of the green in Morristown's center was accurate enough to lend his 
account credibility. But all leads have turned up empty. ``At this 
time we've exhausted all our possibilities in terms of trying to put 
him together with somewhere specific,'' Slockbower said in a telephone 
interview. ``This is a small city, but lots of people come through 
here.'' Slockbower said police had checked everything from the records 
of homeless shelters to high school yearbooks looking for clues, and 
had come up empty handed. For Brighton, the past two months have been 
a nightmare. ``It's been frustrating and lonely,'' he said from the 
Montreal home of Greg Blachford, a worker at the Gay Line crisis center 
who took in Brighton after he was discharged from the hospital. ``I 
can be around other people who are talking about their experiences 
in life and then I realize that even though I think I'm 28, I can't 
remember what sort of experiences I've had.'' Dr. Richard Montoro, 
a psychiatrist at Montreal General who examined and treated Brighton, 
said he was convinced that the young man was not trying to deliberately 
hide his past. Police have found no evidence of a criminal record. 
When Brighton was examined by doctors he had no head bruises or other 
evidence of physical injuries that could have caused the loss of memory. 
His blood showed no evidence of alcohol or drugs. Montoro thinks Brighton 
has a rare condition known as dissociative amnesia, which was probably 
caused by some psychological trauma. ``It appears he was assaulted 
by two thieves in his home a few weeks before he came to Montreal,'' 
Montoro said. That is the kind of traumatic event that could have 
triggered the amnesia, but Montoro said that uncovering it has not 
helped Brighton retrieve more than just scrambled parts of his memory. 
Some facts, like his birth date, came firmly into his mind, Brighton 
said. During one of the sessions with doctors, he turned his head 
when someone called out the name James. A slight British accent supports 
his thought that he came to the United States from England when he 
was a teen-ager. But it is through the use of sodium amytal, a ``truth 
serum,'' that Brighton made the link to Morristown. ``The doctor asked 
if I could think of any city in particular and I mentioned Morristown 
and without looking at a map I said it was directly off Highway 287,'' 
Brighton said. The description is accurate. ``Later they showed me 
pictures of the old courthouse in town and I knew exactly what it 
was,'' he said. He also remembered the town green, and the train station. 
``I remembered that I would drive a short distance, park and then 
take the train,'' he said. He thinks he worked in the television or 
film industry in New York. Brighton said that when the doctors were 
examining him after he first entered the hospital in October, they 
asked if he was gay. ``Without even thinking I said yes,'' he said. 
Montreal police theorized that he might have gone to Montreal for 
the annual ``Black and Blue'' celebration, a large party drawing thousands 
of people from all over North America. But a check of ticket purchases 
and credit card records did not turn up any useful information. Montoro 
said that if Brighton does not recover his full memory within six 
months, it is not likely that he will. He would then have to assume 
a new legal identity and apply for citizenship in Canada, where he 
can stay for the time being. Brighton said that because he does not 
have any identification, he is afraid to try crossing the border into 
the United States to visit Morristown personally. ``I met with two 
officers from Immigration Canada and they said that because I don't 
have papers, American immigration would not allow me in,'' he said. 
``Then I checked with U.S. immigration one time and they told me not 
to try crossing if I don't have identification.''
