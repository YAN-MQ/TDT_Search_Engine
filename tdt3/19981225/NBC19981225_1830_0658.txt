The biggest prize in adventure and aviation is still out there to 
be chased tonight. The latest attempt to fly a balloon nonstop around 
the world ended in failure off the coast of Hawaii. Richard Branson 
and his crewmates lifted off from Morocco one week ago, flying over 
Africa and Asia, covering more than 8,000 miles halfway around the 
world. But today, over the pacific ocean, they gave up. Here's NBC's 
Stan Bernard. Richard Branson's balloon ran out of luck and wind today 
and splashed down in the pacific near Hawaii. The three-man crew is 
safe, lifted from the water by coast guard helicopters. The final 
moments for horrible. We were dragged for miles and miles and miles. 
The water started to come in to the capsule. We were fortunate to 
manage to throw yourselves away from it. The pacific was the most 
dangerous leg of the flight, and the coast guard was briefed months 
ago on rescue procedures for this balloon and capsule. Branson, the 
popular British mogul and adventurer, American millionaire steve Fossett 
and professional Swedish balloonist per limstrom timed their landing 
for first light. Planes tracked every second of their path as they 
approached the water. It was horrendous. There are a quite few balloons. 
And this is the worst. The day began with Christmas pudding near their 
half. Way Mark. But they were in a race that could stall them. Ground 
control said they lost that race by an hour. The support team monitors 
and apprised the crew for seven days helped them dodge a war, storms 
and restricted Chinese air space. But they couldn't do anything about 
this. The weather beat us. They ended their ride on the jet stream. 
The wents got slow and pushed them in the wrong direction. They struggled 
to find favorable winds, strims dropping to 2,000 feet. We thought 
we had it. We went rigts up and tried to go above it. We went right 
along it. In the end, we tried to burst through it. It was like a 
solid brick wall. We were push aid long it. They made the decision 
to quit when they were only moving about 15 miles an hour. And knew 
their fuel and supply limits. For Branson, this is his third failure. 
At least one of them is wondering aloud about yet another try. Steve 
Fossett said maybe it's time to go sailing. Stan Bernard, NBC news, 
London.
