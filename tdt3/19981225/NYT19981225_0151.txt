Initial test results on tons of waste dumped in Cambodia by a Taiwanese 
company indicate that the mercury level was thousands of times higher 
than safety standards permit. The waste, believed to be compressed 
industrial ash, was dumped a few miles outside Sihanoukville, 115 
miles southwest of Phnom Penh, last month and discovered two weeks 
ago. Villagers living nearby have complained of exhaustion and diarrhea. 
Environment Minister Mok Mareth said the first of three analyses of 
the 3,000 tons of waste showed a mercury content of 675 parts per 
million. Joyce Fu, a member of the environmentalist Green Formosa 
Front, said by telephone from Taipei that Taiwan regulations called 
for less than 0.2 parts per million. Mok Mareth said he was waiting 
for two more tests from foreign laboratories before drawing conclusions 
about the Taiwanese waste. The waste was sent by Taiwan's giant Formosa 
Plastics Corp., and fear over possibly toxic content caused a panicked 
exodus of residents from the seaport area. Hundreds of soldiers wearing 
protective clothing have been packing the waste into barrels and shipping 
containers. Sihanoukville's deputy governor, Khim Bo, whose home was 
ransacked by angry citizens in riots over the waste last weekend, 
said the cleanup could take three to four weeks. A dock worker died 
a few days after cleaning the hold of the ship that transported the 
waste, setting off the riots in normally tranquil Sihanoukville. Thousands 
fled the resort town, and the police said four were killed in traffic 
accidents on the road to the capital. Lee Chin-chun, general manager 
of Formosa Plastics, said on Thursday that the waste had been treated 
and was not hazardous. He said the company would take the waste back 
if asked. Lee denied Cambodian government reports that $3 million 
in bribes had been paid to get the shipment past corrupt officials, 
but acknowledged that the Cambodian agent who handled the transport 
and disposal had received $300,000. The Cambodian government has suspended 
29 port and customs officials and arrested the president of the local 
company that helped import the waste.
