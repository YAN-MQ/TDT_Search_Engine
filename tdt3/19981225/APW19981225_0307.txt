A suggestion by Germany's health minister to allow pharmacies to sell 
small amounts of soft recreational drugs was rejected Friday by the 
main doctors' association. Andrea Fischer, health minister in the 
new center-left government, floated the idea this week, saying it 
could keep casual users from moving to more dangerous substances by 
``separating the markets for soft and hard drugs.'' Karsten Vilmar, 
head of the German Chamber of Doctors, disagreed. He called the proposal 
``a false liberalization'' that would give a state stamp of approval 
to drug use and actually lead more young people into addiction. ``Drug 
consumption risks becoming a normal part of our culture if hashish 
now is to be sold over the counter,'' he said in a telephone interview 
with The Associated Press.
