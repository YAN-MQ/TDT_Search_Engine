Yet another quest to circle the globe nonstop in a balloon has come 
to an end. One week after taking off, British tycoon Richard Branson 
and his two copilots on board the ico global challenger landed near 
Honolulu today. The decision to abort the mission came after the crew 
became stuck in a Low-pressure system. Ground controllers say weather 
was not the only problem. I think we learned a lot after this mission. 
Unfortunately, a lot of it was -- a lot of our lessons were political. 
But having said all that, the weather got us in the end. If you're 
going to be defeated on the round-the-world balloon flight, it's best 
to be defeated by weather rather than political problems. The balloonists 
traveled 8,000 miles or about half the distance of the journey.
