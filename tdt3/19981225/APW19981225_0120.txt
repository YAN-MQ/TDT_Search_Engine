Thousands of Indonesian workers at a steel plant in East Java went 
on a rampage to protest cuts in their bonuses, burning a car and damaging 
facilities owned by the steelmaker, a company guard said Friday. The 
PT Alma Surya Steel workers in Surabaya, the capital of East Java, 
staged the protest on Wednesday after reading an announcement saying 
annual bonus payments would be cut by 50 percent from the amount they 
received last year. The guard, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
said the angry workers burned one car, damaged another and battered 
a security post on company grounds. Contacted by phone Friday, the 
guard said the situation had returned to normal and that no one had 
been arrested for causing the disturbance. According to the daily 
Media Indonesia, the company usually paid an annual bonus in December 
worth between one and 2 1/2 times a worker's average monthly salary. 
The management cited the current economic crisis affecting the Southeast 
Asian nation for this years cuts, the newspaper reported. The rampage 
was believed to be the first violent protest in the country since 
Saturday, the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
