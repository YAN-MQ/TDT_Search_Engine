The top Islamic court in the breakaway Russian region of Chechnya 
has suspended Parliament for not conforming to Islamic law. And has 
fired several top leaders for alleged collaboration with Russia. But 
the court allowed President Aslan Maskhadov to stay in office. Russian 
news reports say the court's ruling on Thursday established a consultative 
body of top military commanders. But Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister 
says members of Parliament will work together with the advisory council.
