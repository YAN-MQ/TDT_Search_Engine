Following are the 25 rules for impeachment proceedings adopted by 
the Senate on March 2, 1868, to govern the trial of President Andrew 
Johnson: Rule I Whensoever the Senate shall receive notice from the 
House of Representatives that managers are appointed on their part 
to conduct an impeachment against any person and are directed to carry 
articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate 
shall immediately inform the House of Representatives that the Senate 
is ready to receive the managers for the purpose of exhibiting such 
articles of impeachment agreeably to said notice. Rule II When the 
managers of an impeachment shall be introduced at the bar of the Senate 
and shall signify that they are ready to exhibit articles of impeachment 
against any person, the presiding officer of the Senate shall direct 
the sergeant-at-arms to make proclamation, who shall, after making 
proclamation, repeat the following words, viz: All persons are commanded 
to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives 
is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment 
against /name of the accused/, after which the articles shall be exhibited; 
and then the presiding officer of the Senate shall inform the managers 
that the Senate will take proper order on the subject of the impeachment, 
of which due notice shall be given to the House of Representatives. 
Rule III Upon such articles being presented to the Senate, the Senate 
shall, at 1 o'clock afternoon of the day (Sunday excepted) following 
such presentation, or sooner if so ordered by the Senate, proceed 
to the consideration of such articles, and shall continue in session 
from day to day (Sundays excepted) after the trial shall commence 
(unless otherwise ordered by the Senate) until final judgment shall 
be rendered, and so much longer as may in its judgment be needful. 
Before proceeding to the consideration of the articles of impeachment 
the presiding officer shall administer the oath hereinafter provided 
to the members of the Senate then present, and to the other members 
of the Senate as they shall appear, whose duty it shall be to take 
the same. Rule IV When the President of the United States, or the 
Vice President of the United States upon whom the powers and duties 
of the office of President shall have devolved, shall be impeached, 
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States shall 
preside; and in a case requiring the said Chief Justice to preside 
notice shall be given to him by the presiding officer of the Senate 
of the time and place fixed for the consideration of the articles 
of impeachment as aforesaid, with a request to attend; and the said 
Chief Justice shall preside over the Senate during the consideration 
of said articles and upon the trial of the person impeached therein. 
Rule V The presiding officer shall have power to make and issue, by 
himself or by the secretary of the Senate, all orders, mandates, writs, 
and precepts authorized by these rules or by the Senate, and to make 
and enforce such other regulations and orders in the premises as the 
Senate may authorize or provide. Rule VI The Senate shall have power 
to compel the attendance of witnesses, to enforce obedience to its 
order, mandates, writs, precepts and judgments, to preserve order, 
and to punish in a summary way contempts of and disobedience to its 
authority, orders, mandates, writs, precepts or judgments, and to 
make all lawful orders, rules and regulations which it may deem essential 
or conducive to the ends of justice; and the sergeant-at-arms, under 
the direction of the Senate, may employ such aid and assistance as 
may be necessary to enforce, execute, and carry into effect the lawful 
orders, mandates, writs, and precepts of the Senate. Rule VII The 
presiding officer of the Senate shall direct all necessary preparations 
in the Senate chamber, and the presiding officer upon the trial shall 
direct all the forms of proceeding while the Senate are sitting for 
the purpose of trying an impeachment and all forms during the trial 
not otherwise specially provided for. The presiding officer may, in 
the first instance, submit to the Senate, without a division, all 
questions of evidence and incidental questions; but the same shall, 
on the demand of one-fifth of the members present, be decided by yeas 
and nays. Rule VIII Upon the presentation of articles of impeachment 
and the organization of the Senate as hereinbefore provided, a writ 
of summons shall issue to the accused, reciting said articles and 
notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place 
to be fixed by the Senate, and named in such writ, and file his answer 
to said articles of impeachment, and to stand to and abide the orders 
and judgments of the Senate thereon, which writ shall be served by 
such officer or person as shall be named in the precept thereof such 
number of days prior to the day fixed for such appearance as shall 
be named in such precept, either by the delivery of an attested copy 
thereof to the person accused or, if that can not conveniently be 
done, by leaving such copy at the last known place of abode of such 
person or at his usual place of business, in some conspicuous place 
therein; or, if such service shall be, in the judgment of the Senate, 
impracticable, notice to the accused to appear shall be given in such 
other manner, by publication or otherwise, as shall be deemed just; 
and if the writ aforesaid shall fail of service in the manner aforesaid, 
the proceedings shall not thereby abate, but further service may be 
made in such manner as the Senate shall direct. If the accused, after 
service, shall fail to appear, either in person or by attorney, on 
the day so fixed therefor as aforesaid, or, appearing, shall fail 
to file his answer to such articles of impeachment, the trial shall 
proceed, nevertheless, as upon a plea of not guilty. If a plea of 
guilty shall be entered, judgment may be entered thereon without further 
proceedings. Rule IX At 12 o'clock and 30 minutes after noon of the 
day appointed for the return of the summons against the person impeached 
the legislative and executive business of the Senate shall be suspended 
and the secretary of the Senate shall administer an oath to the returning 
officer in the form following, viz: I, /name/, do solemnly swear that 
the return made by me upon the process issued on the /blank/ day of 
/blank/ by the Senate of the United States against /name of the accused/ 
is truly made, and that I have performed such service as herein described. 
So help me God. which oath shall be entered at large on the records. 
Rule X The person impeached shall then be called to appear and answer 
the articles of impeachment against him. If he appear, or any person 
for him, the appearance shall be recorded, stating particularly if 
by himself or by agent or attorney, naming the person appearing and 
the capacity in which he appears. If he do not appear, either personally 
or by agent or attorney, the same shall be recorded. Rule XI At 12 
o'clock and 30 minutes after noon of the day appointed for the trial 
of an impeachment the legislative and executive business of the Senate 
shall be suspended and the secretary shall give notice to the House 
of Representatives that the Senate is ready to proceed upon the impeachment 
of /name/, in the Senate Chamber, which chamber is prepared with accommodations 
for the reception of the House of Representatives. Rule XII The hour 
of the day at which the Senate shall sit upon the trial of an impeachment 
shall be (unless otherwise ordered) 12 o'clock p.m., and when the 
hour for such sitting shall arrive the presiding officer of the Senate 
shall so announce; and thereupon the presiding officer upon such trial 
shall cause proclamation to be made, and the business of the trial 
shall proceed. The adjournment of the Senate sitting in said trial 
shall not operate as an adjournment of the Senate, but on such adjournment 
the Senate shall resume the consideration of its legislative and executive 
business. Rule XIII The secretary of the Senate shall record the proceedings 
in cases of impeachment as in the case of legislative proceedings, 
and the same shall be reported in the same manner as the legislative 
proceedings of the Senate. Rule XIV Counsel for the parties shall 
be admitted to appear and be heard upon an impeachment. Rule XV All 
motions made by the parties or their counsel shall be addressed to 
the presiding officer, and if he or any senator shall require it they 
shall be committed to writing and read at the secretary's table. Rule 
XVI Witnesses shall be examined by one person on behalf of the party 
producing them and then cross-examined by one person on the other 
side. Rule XVII If a senator is called as a witness, he shall be sworn 
and give his testimony standing in his place. Rule XVIII If a senator 
wishes a question to be put to a witness, or to offer a motion or 
order (except a motion to adjourn), it shall be reduced to writing 
and put by the presiding officer. Rule XIX At all times while the 
Senate is sitting upon the trial of an impeachment the doors of the 
Senate shall be kept open, unless the Senate shall direct the doors 
to be closed while deliberating upon its decisions. Rule XX All preliminary 
or interlocutory questions and all motions shall be argued for not 
exceeding one hour on each side, unless the Senate shall by order 
extend the time. Rule XXI The case on each side shall be opened by 
one person. The final arguments on the merits may be made by two persons 
on each side (unless otherwise ordered by the Senate, upon application 
for that purpose), and the argument shall be opened and closed on 
the part of the House of Representatives.
