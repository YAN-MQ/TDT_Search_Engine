Feeling ``deflated,'' three men attempting to be first to circumnavigate 
the globe by balloon announced Friday that, defeated by weather problems 
over the Pacific Ocean, they have given up their challenge. British 
tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per 
Lindstrand of Sweden _ all veteran balloonists _ planned a beach or 
sea landing off Honolulu, Hawaii, during the early morning local time 
(1900GMT) to get the best conditions. ``It's a bit of bad luck. We 
almost made it. I think we missed the weather by an hour,'' said the 
team's project director Mike Kendrick. The failure means that Fossett's 
ballooning distance record of 15,200 miles (2,4461 kilometers), set 
earlier this year, still stands. That attempt also ended in the Pacific, 
but closer to the mainland of the United States. ``We are deflated, 
about as deflated as the balloon will be in a few hours time,'' Kendrick 
said. ``We are balloonatics, you know, and we just keep going.'' The 
balloonists got sucked into a low pressure system overnight in the 
Pacific. They had been moving the craft up and down between 6,000 
feet (1,830 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230 meters) about 200 miles 
(322 kilometers) off Hawaii in an effort to find a fast enough easterly 
wind in the atmosphere's jetstream to carry them to the continental 
United States. They had picked up an easterly wind, but at 14 knots 
(16 mph or 26 kph), it was not enough to get them out of trouble. 
Kendrick said there was no chance of any stronger winds soon and that 
they would have been stuck in the depression for a week. ``By the 
time weathermen finished their work and analyzed all the information 
it was quite easy to see that no hanging around would produce a good 
result. It is time to cut our losses,'' Kendrick said. He said the 
safety of the team was not in jeopardy and that the landing is being 
treated as non-emergency. ``Richard, Per and Steve are all experienced 
pilots and the balloon is in the best hands possible but we shan't 
relax until we see those guys walking,'' he said. Branson outlined 
the last hours of the struggle in a statement read out by Kendrick 
to a news conference at the control center. ``We raced across the 
Pacific in winds of up to 200 mph (322 kph) but ended up hitting a 
solid trough from one end to the other,'' Branson said. ``It has been 
like hitting up against a solid brick wall. All day and all night 
we battled to get through it.'' Balloon pilots navigate by changing 
the lift of the balloon to ascend or descend into different wind systems, 
but cannot plan their courses and speeds precisely. There are at least 
seven other contenders waiting in the wings to claim one of the last 
remaining prized records. Rival balloonist Colin Prescott, whose team 
plans its own imminent bid, said the ICO balloon's failure was ``sad,'' 
but not surprising. ``I'm sure they'll be tired, and a bit stressed,'' 
he said. ``It's been an amazing journey. Let's hope it all ends happily 
and safely.'' ``I wouldn't be human if I didn't say that we would 
rather that they had a happy landing short of their goal,'' he added. 
The voyage of the 272-foot-high (83-meter-high) hot-air and helium 
balloon began in Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 18., aiming to land in 
Western Europe. The team secured permission from 97 countries for 
overflights and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia 
and North Korea. But last Friday, Libya withdrew permission to fly 
over its territory and only reversed the decision after a personal 
plea from Branson to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Then, in conditions 
marred by thunderstorms, the crew had to maneuver the craft through 
narrow gaps between no-fly territories, including Iraq. And negotiations 
took place over several days earlier this week with the Chinese authorities 
after the balloon drifted into unauthorized airspace. The Chinese 
asked the balloonists to land at an airfield, but the balloon overshot 
the site and could not come down anywhere else. With the help of British 
diplomats, the balloonists won Chinese permission to continue.
