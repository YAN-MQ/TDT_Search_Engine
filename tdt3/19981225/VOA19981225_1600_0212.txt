The top Islamic court in the breakaway Russian region of Chechnya 
has suspended Parliament for not conforming to Islamic law. And fired 
several top leaders for alleged collaboration with Russia. But the 
court allowed President Aslan Maskhadov to stay in office. Russian 
news reports say the court's ruling on Thursday established a council 
of top military commanders. But Chechnya's deputy prime minister says 
members of Parliament will work together with the advisory council.
