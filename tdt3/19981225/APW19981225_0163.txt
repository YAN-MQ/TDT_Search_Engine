In a blow to Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, the top Islamic court 
in the breakaway republic suspended the parliament and fired several 
senior officials for ``collaboration'' with Russians, news reports 
said on Friday. The Supreme Shariah Court also found Maskhadov guilty 
of appointing the officials, whom it said assisted Russia's ``occupation 
regime'' during the 1994-96 independence war, and warned him against 
such actions in the future. In a ruling announced late Thursday, the 
court also dismissed Maskhadov's wife Kusama as head of a charity, 
citing ``inadmissibility of women holding top posts in an Islamic 
state,'' the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported. The court 
ruled to suspend the pro-president Chechen parliament, saying its 
activities contradicted Islamic norms, and ordered it be replaced 
with a council of top military commanders. It was not clear what the 
court meant by suspending parliament or if the order would be obeyed. 
The court also dismissed Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov 
along with the local airline chief, tax boss and Chechnya's envoy 
to Russia. The court's verdict came after an appeal from a group of 
prominent Chechen warlords, who accused Maskhadov of breaking Chechen 
law by maintaining close relations with Russia and had demanded his 
ouster. Chechnya has run its own affairs since defeated Russian troops 
withdrew in 1996, but no country has recognized its independence bid 
and Moscow continues to consider the southern republic a part of Russia. 
Maskhadov won presidential elections almost two years ago by an overwhelming 
margin, and retains widespread support despite his failure to restore 
stability and combat kidnapping and other crime. Hundreds of people 
have been abducted for ransom in Chechnya in recent years. In an unusually 
gruesome display of lawlessness, four Western captives were beheaded 
earlier this month.
