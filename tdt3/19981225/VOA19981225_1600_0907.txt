Meanwhile, Jerusalem was crowded with Muslim and Christian worshippers. 
For a rare convergence of Christmas and the first Friday prayers of 
the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. VOA's David Gullis has details. 
Israeli authorities eased normal entry requirements for worshippers 
from the Palestinian controlled areas. And an estimated 180 thousand 
Muslim faithful crowded into Al Asqa Mosque and the surrounding Temple 
Mount for prayers on the first Friday of Ramadan. Thousands of Israeli 
policemen were on duty. And streets leading to Jerusalem's old city 
were closed off to accommodate the crowd. Its members heard the Mufti 
Palestine Ikrama Sabri deliver a sermon bitterly critical of the United 
States and President Clinton for the U.S.-led attack on Iraq. The 
Muslim leader rejected Mr. Clinton's Ramadan letter of reconciliation 
to the Muslim world. He also criticized Arab states that did not come 
to Baghdad's assistance in the crisis. The huge crowd dispersed without 
incident. And Israeli police officials said there had been good cooperation 
with the Wakf, the Muslim religious authority in Jerusalem. Several 
thousand Christian worshippers, meanwhile, attended Christmas services 
at churches in Jerusalem. And at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, 
the historic birthplace of Jesus. The tourism officials of both Israel 
and the Palestinian authority said the turnout of foreign pilgrims 
for Christmas was disappointing. Held down by recent Israeli-Palestinian 
clashes in Bethlehem, and travel warnings spawned by the Gulf crisis.
