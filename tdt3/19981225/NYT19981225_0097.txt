The first national storm of the winter covered southeastern Virginia 
on Thursday with freezing rain that toppled hundreds of utility poles 
and countless trees, bringing down miles of power lines and depriving 
240,000 residents of electricity and heat. The same weather system 
that disrupted power through Virginia also disrupted Christmas celebrations 
across the South. While power was restored to 60,000 homes and businesses 
in Tennessee by Christmas night, at least 156,000 remained without 
electricity in Mississippi, 93,000 in Louisiana and 106,000 in North 
Carolina, The Associated Press reported. Officials of the Virginia 
Power Co. said Friday that some power had been restored but the entire 
process could take repair efforts well into next week. Similar predictions 
were made by utility officials in the other affected states. Although 
skies turned sunny in some parts of the South, temperature remained 
low and some roads remained closed and icy. Slick conditions were 
blamed for many deaths in recent days, including six in Alabama, six 
in Virginia and two in South Carolina, The Associated Press reported. 
``We've had a lot of wrecks,'' said a dispatcher at state police headquarters 
in Richmond who refused to give his name. ``More in an hour than we 
usually get in a day.'' The dispatcher also said that many streets 
were still blocked by fallen trees. In Providence Forge, a small community 
east of Richmond, calls to the volunteer rescue squad have increased 
sharply in the last two days. ``We're going crazy, answering calls,'' 
said George Pankey, a volunteer, attributing the increased activity 
in large measure to the storm. ``We're responding to everything in 
the book, from a couple of heart attacks to a boy today who spilled 
some stuff on himself and got burned. A lot of this is because of 
the storm.'' ``It certainly ruined my Christmas, I can tell you that,'' 
said Maj. Michael Nicely of the Gloucester County Sheriff's Office. 
`'The power is down in most of the county, and operations are going 
real slow because of all the ice. It's going to take some time, maybe 
three or four days, before everything is back to normal.'' The areas 
hardest hit by the storm were Richmond and counties to the south and 
east. Dan Genest, the power company spokesman, said that at the peak 
of the power failure, through Christmas Eve, 62,000 customers in Richmond 
had no power, 61,000 in Petersburg, 28,000 in Williamsburg and 26,000 
in Gloucester, a rural district on the western shore of the Chesapeake 
Bay. Authorities said the lack of electricity had prompted many residents 
to seek shelter in municipal buildings and in hotels and motels that 
had power.
