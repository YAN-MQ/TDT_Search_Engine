Sources at the North Pole tell CNN that Santa claus has taken off 
in his reindeer-driven sleigh, and will soon be visiting the homes 
of children all over the world. Claus said before the flight that 
boys and girls seem to want the same things they always have. You 
can't really say like one thing. The traditional, I would say, with 
the boys and girls has always remained the same. The boys, it is always 
tractors and cars and stuff like that. The girls, then dolls and toy 
animals and stuff like that. Of course, the modern days have brought 
the more technical things, you know? Computerized things and all that. 
Other than that, the basic way of thinking seems to be very traditional. 
Claus expects to complete his trip by tomorrow morning.
