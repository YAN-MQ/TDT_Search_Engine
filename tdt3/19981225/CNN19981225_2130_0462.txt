In the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, there was a Christmas funeral 
today as ethnic Albanians mourned the latest victim of violence. Friends 
of the dead man say he was shot in cold blood by Serbian forces during 
a raid in which nine others were killed. The violence is the worst 
since Serbs ended a bloody crackdown against albanian separatists 
in October, after the threat of NATO air strikes.
