The latest attempt to circle the globe nonstop in a hot air balloon 
is ending, far short of its goal. The project director for the effort 
says the balloon was pulled into a Dangerous low-pressure system over 
the pacific ocean and wouldn't have been able to break free for a 
week. Balloonists Richard Branson, Steve Fossett and per Lindstrand 
made it more than halfway around the world, and had hoped to be over 
north America tonight.
