The Rev. John Flynn wore a cap emblazoned with the phrase ``Save A 
Generation'' _ an odd comment, since he was oblivious to his own safety 
while crossing East 180th Street with hardly a glance. Halfway across, 
he realized it might be a good idea to look around just in case a 
bus, truck or livery cab was bearing down on him. All clear. ``I don't 
look at traffic,'' he said with an embarrassed chuckle. ``I just go 
out there. The cars go zoom, and I just keep walking.'' Words to live 
by, at least when there's no traffic. Since Flynn arrived in the Crotona 
neighborhood in the Bronx as pastor of St. Martin of Tours Roman Catholic 
Church, he has always ambled around his parish. It's the best way 
he knows to show people he's available for anything. The walks also 
help him insure that the unity people feel in church on Sunday doesn't 
vanish once they go back to the block. It used to be that going out 
on the streets around here was akin to going out on a limb. Crack, 
guns and death were common. It's calmer now, even though this neighborhood 
has not had a decrease in murders, as others in the city have. Yet, 
as the year winds down, Flynn is grateful for the many mercies, small 
and large, that came his way. He talked a man from jumping off a roof. 
A new playground was built down the block from his rectory. Even the 
drug dealing that went on across the street from the church has dried 
up. ``I walk around and find an ease with people,'' he said. ``I don't 
think people are extremely afraid. I don't hear people telling me 
they're going to move.'' It was bitterly cold Wednesday afternoon, 
so he tugged his cap snugly over his tousled silver hair before taking 
a stroll. He walked to 182nd Street and Prospect Avenue, not too far 
from where Dion DiMucci once sang doo-wop with the Belmonts back in 
the 1950s. Flynn remembers it more for the blues. ``That's where the 
first guy, Boogaloo, was murdered,'' he said. ``His mother lived in 
the projects. He played basketball. That goes back 10 years, when 
I first got here.'' A young man walked by that utterly ordinary-looking 
spot. ``What's the good news?'' Flynn shouted.``Not much,'' the boy 
said. ``He's doing pretty good,'' Flynn said as he watched the boy 
walk away. ``His mother was worried about him. But he's back in school.'' 
One fewer person for him to worry about. During his time at St. Martin's, 
Flynn has tried nearly anything to reach the youths hanging out on 
the corner or eyeing it with curiosity. He started ``Save A Generation,'' 
a program to give high-school dropouts an education and job training. 
To reach others, he would walk the streets a few nights each week 
offering to trade a crucifix for a gun. All he ever got was a box 
cutter, although his forays made his face familiar, inspiring trust 
even among the knuckleheads. Well, most of them. One teen-ager was 
stunned when Flynn suggested that a $7 crucifix was a fair trade for 
a $100 gun. ``I didn't go on to explain the symbolism,'' he said. 
``He just wasn't in the mood for that little talk. He just laughed 
at me like I was out of my mind.'' Maybe you have to be a little crazy 
to stick around and not give up. On Mapes Avenue, Flynn grimaced when 
he saw houses with porches encased in thick bars and gates, making 
it look as if the Santa and snowmen dolls within them were doing time. 
But down the block, he shared a laugh and an embrace with a parishioner 
who has lived on the block _ without bars _ for 50 years. Later, he 
helped another parishioner haul bags of bread to a corner where the 
man fed the pigeons. He stopped at a community center, where a young 
girl re-enacted her role in the church's holiday pageant. She boomed 
something about prophets. He smiled. ``These kids are so without guile,'' 
he said. ``We've got to keep them innocent. They lose it so fast.'' 
Back out on 180th Street, he recalled his own childhood in Yonkers. 
He used to work at the kind of jobs that some of his parishioners 
now take to make ends meet. ``When I was a teen-ager I worked in an 
A&AMP;P,'' he said. ``We ate lunch downstairs with all the canned 
goods and boxes. The men there were nice enough guys, but they were 
so bitter. It was awful they were doing something they couldn't stand. 
Isn't it great to do something you love?'' That's what keeps him walking. 
It even keeps the cars away. Crazy? Sure _ crazy love.
