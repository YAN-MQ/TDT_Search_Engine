Well, no basketball is being played in the National Basketball Association. 
Where Commissioner David Stearn and Player's Union Chief Billy Hunter 
have held a secret meeting in Los Angeles. In a bid to solve the nearly 
six month old labor impasse. However, no progress was made to end 
the lockout. An NBA spokesman confirmed the meeting, which was the 
first between the two men since December 11. Stearn and Hunter met 
in the office of player agent Leonard Armoto, who is trying to broker 
an agreement between the two men. The meeting took place just hours 
after Stearn set January 7 as the deadline for reaching a deal to 
save the season. Stearn has scheduled a board of governor's meeting 
for that day, when he will ask the 29 owners for permission to cancel 
the season. A simple majority is needed for passage.
