North Korea on Friday warned the United States that it was prepared 
to launch another medium-range missile. The Clinton administration 
had privately told the North that such a step would jeopardize international 
aid it was promised in exchange for freezing its nuclear weapons program. 
The latest warning, published by the official Korean Central News 
Agency on Friday, said it was ``foolish for the U.S. to expect any 
change in our attitude.'' But U.S. officials have said in recent weeks 
that they have seen no activity to suggest that a launching was imminent. 
When North Korea launched a three-stage missile over Japan on Aug. 
31, it took the U.S. intelligence community by surprise. Until then, 
U.S. officials did not believe that the North possessed the technology 
for a three-stage ballistic missile, which gives the country the ability 
to reach all of the major U.S. military bases in South Korea and Japan. 
North Korea maintains that the launching was intended to propel a 
small satellite into low earth orbit. While North Korean news agencies 
say the satellite now is broadcasting patriotic North Korea songs, 
U.S. officials say their review of the evidence suggests the satellite 
either failed to get into orbit, or dropped out of orbit within hours 
of the launching. ``We haven't heard a thing,'' one senior administration 
official said last week, ``because it's not up there anymore.'' The 
political significance of a second launching would likely be far greater 
than any marginal technological achievement it might represent for 
the North. The administration has been trying to rescue a 1994 accord 
under which North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear weapons program 
in exchange for fuel oil and the construction of two civilian nuclear 
power plants. The United States committed itself to paying for the 
fuel oil; Japan, South Korea and other nations are paying for the 
nuclear plants. But the discovery earlier this year of a huge dig 
under a mountain, which the United States suspects is intended for 
nuclear weapons development, and the missile launchings have cast 
doubt on the accord. This month the North dropped a demand that it 
be paid in return for allowing international inspectors to see the 
new site; instead, it suggested that it would be willing to allow 
inspectors in if the United States provided more food aid. Some aid 
has already been sent to alleviate starvation in the country. A second 
launching would probably derail any chance that Congress would approve 
further participation in the nuclear accord, administration officials 
fear. It could also derail Japan's contributions to the program. But 
missile launches themselves are not a violation of the nuclear agreement. 
The North said in its statement Friday that ``We will never be frightened 
by the U.S. warning,'' about further launchings. ``The U.S. still 
knows little'' about the North, a statement few U.S. officials would 
dispute.
