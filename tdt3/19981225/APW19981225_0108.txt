ABOARD THE USS CARL VINSON (AP) _ U.S. naval forces in the Gulf were 
on high alert on Christmas Day as ``a lot of uncertainties and tension'' 
remained following the airstrikes on Iraq, the commander of a carrier 
battlegroup said Friday. ``The mission is very difficult. We have 
a very confused state of affairs right now following the strike that 
occurred on Iraq,'' Rear Adm. Alfred Harms said, referring to the 
attacks of Dec. 16-19 that aimed to punish the Baghdad government 
for its alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors. Some 20 warplanes, 
mainly F-14s and F-18s, from USS Carl Vinson took part in the final 
night's strikes on Iraqi military and communications sites. The carrier 
arrived in the Gulf on Dec. 19 to relieve the battlegroup of the USS 
Enterprise, which sailed out of the region Wednesday. The admiral 
told reporters he did not think anybody knew how the situation was 
going to develop. ``That puts a huge responsibility on the Carl Vinson 
battlegroup, and all of the forces here in the 6th Fleet, to be ready 
for any eventuality,'' Harms said. ``There's a lot of tension and 
a lot of uncertainties (in the region) ... That is why we are here, 
to provide some stability ... so peace will have the opportunity to 
flourish.'' The Carl Vinson was at anchor Friday as the Christmas 
season took over the group of eight warships. Harms would not disclose 
their location but said: ``We are in the Gulf region, and anywhere 
here is within easy striking range of Iraq.'' Most of the crew aboard 
the 97,000 ton carrier are receiving a half-day holiday, staggered 
at intervals since the ship dropped anchor late Thursday. Christmas 
Day began with the chaplain holding mass in the hangar bay. Some 70 
sailors sang carols among a dozen F-14 and F-18 fighters, which had 
been rolled to the sides to make room. The service was scheduled to 
be repeated regularly for other off-duty crew, as was the screening 
of the movies ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' ``Scrooge'' and ``Home Alone.'' 
A Christmas tree, decorated with lights and tinsel, stood in almost 
every mess on the ship. Santa Claus arrived Thursday, stepping on 
to the flight deck from an F-18 fighter. So too did about 57,000 pounds 
(25,900 kilograms) of mail from friends and families. Some 2,000 sailors 
and pilots saw a 10-minute video Thursday of the ship's departure 
from its home port of Bremerton, Washington. The crew also saw pictures 
of the carrier's fighter bombers dropping laser-guided bombs and firing 
anti-radiation missiles at Iraqi targets. A Christmas Day dinner for 
the 5,000-member crew was scheduled to start later Friday. Some of 
the Alaskan King Crab leg, turkey, prime ribs, and Christmas pudding 
will be kept for late arrivals. No flights were scheduled for Friday. 
Aerial missions, which include patrolling the no-fly zone over southern 
Iraq, were due to resume Saturday.
