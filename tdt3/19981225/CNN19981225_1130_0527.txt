This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News" weather update. 
The low pressure storm that's caused the ice in the southeast will 
be moving out to sea, but early Christmas day continue to look for 
a chance of frozen precipitation and rain across the mid-atlantic 
and south atlantic coasts. A cold front moving through the Great Lakes 
will mean a chance of showers and snow showers for that area. And 
we're watching an area of low pressure along the northwest coast. 
Snowfall is possible from the puget sound southward into northern 
california. Temperatures will be cold across Alaska, with Anchorage 
in fog today, 18 degrees for a high. Fairbanks will be sunny with 
a high of 1 degree. The west will warm gradually, temperatures will 
still be in the 20s and 30s, but that's an improvement from the previous 
few days. You'll see 30s and 40s out across most of the east with 
warmer temperatures in the southeast and the southwest. Scattered 
showers will be seen Sunday in the southeast with heavy rain, snow 
and a mix across the northwest on Monday. A big storm system moves 
into the Great Lakes, and heads eastward on tuesday. The extended 
forecast is at CNN.com.
