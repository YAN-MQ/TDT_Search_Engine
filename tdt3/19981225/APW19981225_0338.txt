The president of Sao Tome and Principe has ratified the parliamentary 
choice for the new prime minister of this west African archipelago, 
news reports said Friday. President Miguel Trovoada confirmed Guilherme 
Posser da Costa as prime minister on Wednesday, five days after he 
was named by the Movement of Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe/Social 
Democratic Party to head a new government, Portuguese daily Diario 
de Noticias said. The center-left MLSTP/PSD won 31 seats in the 55-seat 
parliament in parliamentary elections on Nov.8. Posser da Costa replaces 
Raul Braganca Neto who headed a two-year coalition government made 
up of the MLSTP/PSD and the Democratic Convergence Party. A law graduate 
who began his political career in the MLSTP/PSD in the 1970s, Posser 
da Costa served as foreign minister between 1986 and 1995. After winning 
the parliamentary elections, the MLSTP/PSD was expected to name party 
chief Manuel Pinto da Costa as the new prime minister _ a longtime 
political rival of President Trovoada. Pinto da Costa ran the former 
Portuguese colony under a single-party Marxist system for 16 years 
following its 1975 independence from Portugal. Sao Tome and Principe 
lies in the Gulf of Guinea _ about 240 kilometers (150 miles) west 
of Gabon _ in one of the most active oil exploration areas in the 
African continent.
