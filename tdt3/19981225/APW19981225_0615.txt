Auburn's Karsten Bailey and LSU's Joe Wesley, two players from highly 
disappointing teams, scored pivotal touchdowns Friday to lead the 
Gray to a 31-24 win in the Blue-Gray All-Star Classic of U.S. college 
football. Bailey, who ended the year as Auburn's career reception 
leader in the Tigers' (3-8) worst season since 1952, caught a 65-yard 
touchdown catch from Wake Forest's Brian Kuklick with 5:11 to play 
to put the Gray up 31-24.
