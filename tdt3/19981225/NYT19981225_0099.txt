Have you seen Amani Toomer's post-touchdown celebration moves? Toomer, 
the Giants' surging star at wide receiver, has. He watches them on 
videotape and covers his eyes. ``I look and say: `Oh, no. I can't 
believe I did that,''' Toomer said this week at Giants Stadium, demonstrating 
how he throws his hands to his face. ``I go into a zone when I score 
and I don't even know what I'm doing. I just sort of do anything. 
But I hope I keep getting in there and keep looking stupid. I'll be 
happy with that.'' Toomer's moves in the end zone are eclectic, a 
half dance, half jump with a nervous, excited hop _ a player having 
fun but certainly not in an orchestrated way. No one could have practiced 
those maneuvers. One could add that until this season, when Toomer 
has scored a team-leading five touchdowns, he had little reason to 
practice his touchdown celebrations. Until this year, Toomer, 24, 
was a little-used wide receiver and punt return specialist. In two 
seasons with the Giants, he had scored one touchdown as a receiver. 
He had returned three punts for touchdowns, two in his first six games. 
Still, a year ago, the Giants were headed to the playoffs but Toomer 
felt like something of an adjunct to the core of the team. Toomer, 
a second-round pick in the 1996 draft out of Michigan, had once had 
much bigger plans for the 1997 season. Recovering from a serious knee 
injury after his splashy Giants debut early in 1996, Toomer was intent 
on cracking the starting lineup as a wide receiver. Instead, the rookie 
Ike Hilliard beat him out for the flanker's job, and when Hilliard 
was injured, Thomas Lewis won the job. When Lewis was hurt, Kevin 
Alexander, an undrafted free agent, took over. When Alexander was 
later sidelined by injury, David Patten, a free agent signed out of 
the Arena League, was promoted over Toomer. ``It was frustrating for 
a lot of reasons but it was no time to rock the boat,'' Toomer said 
at his Giants Stadium locker this week. ``The team was winning and 
I was happy about that. I was just trying to help.'' A year later, 
with his role recently increased, Toomer is in the news and in the 
end zone and a key to the Giants' attack. He caught the game-winning 
touchdown in the Giants' stirring victory over the Denver Broncos 
and made another touchdown reception in last week's rout of Kansas 
City. The Giants' starter at quarterback, Kent Graham, has long been 
a Toomer supporter, marveling at the receiver's skills when the two 
worked together as second-stringers. Graham likes to throw the ball 
long and Toomer's best attribute might be his ability to get down 
the field in a hurry and then use his 6-foot-3-inch frame and athleticism 
to win any battles for the football. ``He's proven he can be a big-play 
guy,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said. ``He's a smooth runner but he's 
learned to be aggressive. He can slither around guys and get to the 
ball first.'' In the last five weeks, since Graham took over at quarterback 
for Danny Kanell, Toomer has caught 10 passes for 144 yards. For the 
season, Toomer has 25 catches and 337 yards. Toomer will become a 
restricted free agent after this season, which means the Giants can 
match any offer Toomer might receive from another team. Team officials 
have indicated they have no plans to let Toomer get away. In the meantime, 
Toomer is enjoying his newly expanded role and enduring some gentle 
ribbing about his post-touchdown histrionics. ``I'm not going to start 
rehearsing,'' he said with a mixture of embarrassment and excitement. 
``I'm just going to go with it.''
