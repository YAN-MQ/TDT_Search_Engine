Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Friday warned the West against 
using force to halt the latest violence in Kosovo. U.S. and NATO officials 
warned both sides in Kosovo not to use violence after a Serb offensive 
against an ethnic Albanian rebel stronghold. The U.S. State Department 
also condemned all breaches of an October cease-fire, including attacks 
by the Kosovo Liberation Army, which seeks to secede from Yugoslavia. 
Last October, NATO prepared air raids against the Serbs over their 
crackdown on Kosovo's Albanians, but the offensive was put on hold 
after the cease fire was reached and Belgrade pulled out some of its 
forces. Ivanov said that if the West attacks Serbian forces, such 
``strikes would play into the hands of extremists in the region.'' 
He blamed the KLA for the recent violence, and said that Moscow would 
do all it could to avert any NATO strikes. Moscow has strongly opposed 
use of force against the Serbs, its long-time allies.
