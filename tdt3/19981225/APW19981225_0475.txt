At least 16 revelers were missing Friday after a boat taking them 
for a joy ride capsized in India's Ganges River. Police have so far 
found the bodies of two children. Divers were searching for the missing 
16 people, said Parsun Mukherjee, a police inspector-general. Twelve 
people swam ashore after the boat started leaking half a mile (a kilometer) 
off Diamond Harbor on the outskirts of the eastern city of Calcutta.
