Three adventurers abandoned their bid Friday to be the first to fly 
non-stop around the world in a balloon after hitting dangerous weather 
in the Pacific Ocean. ``I'm afraid the weather has beaten us,'' said 
the team's project director Mike Kendrick. ``We are planning to bring 
the balloon down towards Honolulu to attempt a beach or sea landing.'' 
He said they would wait until it is dawn there (1745GMT) for the best 
landing conditions. The balloonists, British mogul Richard Branson, 
American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden were 
feeling ``deflated _ like the balloon is going to be in a few hours,'' 
Kendrick said, speaking from the project's control center in England. 
``It's a bit of bad luck. We almost made it. I think we missed the 
weather by an hour.'' He said the safety of the team, all veteran 
balloonists, was not in jeopardy and that the landing is being treated 
as non-emergency. The balloonists got sucked into a low pressure system 
overnight in the Pacific. They had been moving the craft up and down 
between 6,000 feet (1,830 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230 meters) about 
200 miles (322 kilometers) off Hawaii in an effort to find a fast 
enough easterly wind to carry them to the United States. They had 
picked up an easterly wind, but at 14 knots (16 mph or 26 kph), it 
was not enough to get them out of trouble. Hendrick said there was 
no chance of any stronger winds soon and that they would have been 
stuck in the depression for a week. ``By the time weathermen finished 
their work and analyzed all the information it was quite easy to see 
that no hanging around would produce a good result. It is time to 
cut our losses,'' Hendrick said. Branson outlined the last hours of 
the struggle in a statement read out by Kendrick to a news conference 
at the control center. ``We raced across the Pacific in winds of up 
to 200 mph (322 kph) but ended up hitting a solid trough from one 
end to the other,'' Branson said. ``It has been like hitting up against 
a solid brick wall. All day and all night we battled to get through 
it.'' ``We are sorry to have let you down,'' he said, adding the team 
plan to return home to spend what was left of the Christmas holiday 
with their families and friends. If the balloonists had made the U.S. 
West Coast they would have broken the balloon distance record which 
American Fossett set on an earlier attempt to circumnavigate the globe 
earlier this year. It was the treacherous Pacific which ended that 
venture, forcing him to ditch hundreds of miles from the coast in 
shark-infested waters. Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift 
of the balloon to ascend or descend into different wind systems, but 
cannot plan their courses and speeds precisely. The voyage of the 
272-foot-high (83-meter-high) hot-air and helium balloon began in 
Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 18., aiming to land in Western Europe. 
Before hitting bad weather in the Pacific, the crew faced diplomatic 
problems. The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights 
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North 
Korea. Last Friday, Libya withdrew permission to fly over its territory 
and only reversed the decision after a personal plea from Branson 
to Lybian leader Moammar Gadhafi. Then, in conditions marred by thunderstorms, 
the crew had to maneuver the craft through narrow gaps between no-fly 
territories, including war-torn Iraq. And negotiations took place 
over several days earlier this week with the Chinese authorities after 
the balloon drifted into unauthorized airspace. The Chinese asked 
the balloonists to land at an airfield, but the balloon overshot the 
site and could not come down anywhere else. With the help of British 
diplomats, the balloonists won Chinese permission to continue.
