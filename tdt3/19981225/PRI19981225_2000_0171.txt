And Bethlehem isn't the only place in the Middle East which plans 
to offer religious packages for tourist. The Comptect Church in Egypt 
has developed an intricate tradition around the story of the flights 
of the Holy Family from jealous rage of King Herot. Soon tourist will 
follow the trail. From Cairo, here's Barbara Platt. The Comptech Church 
believes it was specially blessed by the visit and it highlights every 
site where the Holy Family is said to have stopped. Now the Egyptian 
government has teamed up with the private sector to turn that route 
into a tourist attraction for the Millennium. In this mainly Islamic 
country, Jesus is accepted as a prophet and both Christians and Muslims 
seek blessing at the Holy Family sites. The tourist project will no 
doubt give the government a chance to refute charges that it discriminates 
against Christians. But the church values most a chance to show its 
priced heritage to the world. The BBC's Barbara Platt reporting from 
Cairo. With time at four minuets past the hour, I'm Derrick Stofall 
in the BBC News Room in London. You're listening to The World.
