Federal prosecutors are investigating $100,900 in political contributions 
that a Long Island insurance conglomerate and its president made to 
the New York Republican State Committee before closing an important 
deal with the state, lawyers involved in the inquiry say. The conglomerate, 
the Robert Plan, and its president, Robert Wallach, gave the money 
in the summer of 1997 while negotiating with state insurance regulators 
to take control of most of the assets of two nearly bankrupt insurance 
companies. The party received the money in early July, and two months 
later, Gov. George Pataki announced that the state was transferring 
the assets to the Robert Plan. The conglomerate and Wallach had not 
previously donated to the party or the Pataki campaign. The U.S. Attorney's 
office in Brooklyn sent a subpoena to the Robert Plan last month, 
seeking documents in an effort to determine whether the donations 
were intended to influence the talks with the State Insurance Department, 
according to lawyers involved in the inquiry who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity. The office acted after The New York Times reported on 
the timing of the donations in an article on Oct. 27. The subpoena 
comes as the Brooklyn prosecutor's office is working on at least three 
other campaign finance inquiries. One is examining possible links 
between donations to the Republican State Committee and the awarding 
of a $97 million state transportation contract. Another focuses on 
whether contributors to the Pataki campaign were promised favorable 
treatment in cases before the State Parole Board. A third involves 
donations to the campaign of outgoing Attorney General Dennis Vacco 
from an auto-leasing company that he was investigating. In October, 
another executive at the Robert Plan, John Reiersen, said there was 
no connection between the contributions and the insurance deal. Under 
the deal, the Robert Plan assumed most of the policies held by two 
companies, Home Mutual and New York Merchant Bakers of Binghamton, 
N.Y., after the state decided that their collapse would harm policyholders. 
In return for getting the new policies, the Robert Plan, based in 
Bethpage, N.Y., promised to pay some of the companies' debts and keep 
most premiums level for a year.
