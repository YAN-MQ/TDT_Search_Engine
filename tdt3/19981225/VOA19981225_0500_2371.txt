A lawsuit has been filed in the United States in an effort to recover 
assets allegedly seized from Nazi Holocaust victims by two American 
and seven French banks. VOA's Breck Ardery reports from New York. 
The suit claims that Chase Manhattan, J.P. Morgan, and seven banks 
in France withheld the deposits and other assets of Jewish customers 
in France during World War II. During the Nazi occupation of France, 
the suit alleges, the banks seized the cash deposits and the contents 
of safety deposit boxes from their customers, and never returned them. 
Kenneth McCallian, the lawyer who filed the suit in New York Federal 
Court, says the failure by the banks to release assets prevented some 
Jews from fleeing France, and probably led to their deaths. Unfortunately, 
it is quite likely the families who were able to flee France during 
this period of time, were usually those who had at least some of the 
financial means to do what was necessary to get across the borders. 
And many of the families that were stripped of their assets as well 
as -- well, personal assets and bank assets were really extremely 
vulnerable to the roundups which took place in Paris and elsewhere. 
And indeed, there were some concentration camps in France where about 
3,000 Jews in France died. Mr. McCallian says he has not yet put a 
dollar value on the lawsuit. Because he's still researching how much 
money and property was involved. In a statement, the Chase Manhattan 
Bank says it is disappointed by the lawsuit. Because it has already 
been in discussion with the World Jewish Congress to settle such claims. 
Mr. McCallian says he would applaud efforts by Chase to reach a settlement. 
In fact, the attorney's hoping the case involving the nine banks can 
be settled without the necessity of a trial. He points to the $3.6 
million restitution of Jewish assets by the Barclays' Bank of Britain 
earlier this month. And the $1.2 billion settlement by Swiss banks 
in August, as examples of how the case could be resolved. Breck Ardery,
