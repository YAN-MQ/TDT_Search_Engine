Randall Cunningham is not the only one getting a contract extension. 
Minnesota offensive tackle Cory Stringer has also been given a five 
year deal that will earn million dollars. Elsewhere, the Miami Dolphins 
extended the contracts of wide receiver Lamar Thomas and cornerback 
Jerry Wilson through the year 2000. Financial terms of their deals 
were not disclosed. Thomas had a career high: three touchdowns in 
the 31-21 win over the Denver Broncos Monday night. Wilson helped 
preserve that win with an interception at Denver's 44 yard line. The 
two players also helped the Dolphins clinch a wild card berth in the 
American Football Conference Playoffs.
