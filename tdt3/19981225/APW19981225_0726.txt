Wellington, New Zealand (AP) _ A small fishing boat with six people 
on board was missing as Cyclone Cora began battering the Pacific island 
nation of Tonga on Saturday, Tongan police said. The 7-meter (yard) 
boat was missing in high seas off the central Ha'apai group of islands. 
A police spokesman said there had been few reports of other damage 
so far. ``People are moving away from the lowlands,'' the unidentified 
spokesman said on New Zealand National Radio. ``We've received a lot 
of rain so far and flooding will be a problem there.'' The cyclone 
is battering the main island of Tongatapu and the Ha'apai chain with 
wind gusts of up to 100 mph (160kph). The Meteorological Service of 
New Zealand said on Saturday that the cyclone was moving south-southeast 
at about 15 knots. Southern and western parts of the Ha'apai group, 
Tongatapu and 'Eua are expected to bear the brunt of the cyclone. 
The Service forecast winds between storm force and hurricane force, 
and predicted coastal flooding from heavy seas.
