Russia's arms exports in 1999 will be 20 percent higher than this 
year, the minister of economy said Friday, according to the Interfax 
news agency. Economy Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said the government 
would provide guarantees to ``reliable and solvent'' arms-export companies, 
and that negotiations had already been conducted with India, China 
and other countries. Although well down from Soviet levels, Russia 
is one of the world's top four arms exporters, supplying relatively 
inexpensive weapons with a reputation for reliability. With the Russian 
economy in crisis, arms exports are among the country's few steady 
sources of hard currency and one of the few sectors where Russian 
industry continues to operate efficiently. An official from Rosvooruzheniye, 
the state arms exporter, said in August that Russia hoped to export 
about dlrs 3.5 billion of weapons this year and hoped to increase 
that figure to dlrs 8 billion by 2005.
