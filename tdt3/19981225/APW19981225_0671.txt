A Chilean army priest flown in from Santiago took confession and performed 
a private Mass at Christmas for former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet, The Times newspaper reported Friday. The paper said that 
the general, 83, had also hosted a house party for three of his children, 
Jacqueline, Veronica and Marco Antonio, and more than 20 grandchildren, 
in two houses on the exclusive Wentworth estate southwest of London. 
Under bail conditions imposed by a British court Pinochet is living 
in one house on the estate. Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London 
on charges of murder and torture during his 1973-90 rule. He is fighting 
a bid to extradite him to Spain. Pinochet's family wanted ''to make 
it as much like a normal Christmas in Chile as possible,'' the newspaper 
quoted Ivan Moreira, a right-wing Chilean lawmaker and friend of Pinochet, 
as saying. Moreira said he planned to pay a visit to Pinochet on Christmas 
Day, the newspaper said. On Wednesday, a British judge ruled that 
Pinochet could leave his house detention if he needs urgent medical 
care, but refused Pinochet permission to attend Christmas Mass at 
a local church. An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were 
murdered or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police. 
The victims allegedly include expatriated Spaniards. The House of 
Lords is to review Pinochet's immunity appeal Jan. 18.
