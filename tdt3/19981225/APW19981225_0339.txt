Boris Yeltsin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko agreed 
Friday to take steps to merge the two former Soviet republics into 
a single state as early as next year. Yeltsin and Lukashenko agreed 
to put the proposed merger to public discussion by mid-1999. Without 
waiting for popular approval, they would also move early next year 
to introduce a single currency and harmonize taxes. ``We are now calling 
for merging our nations in one union state,'' Yeltsin said at a news 
conference after the signing. ``We can be proud of such work.'' ``God 
help us to enter the next millennium as a single state,'' Lukashenko 
said. Yeltsin, plagued by poor health in recent years, appeared tired 
at the meeting, although he spoke clearly and strongly. At one point, 
he struggled to get up from a chair and had to be helped by an aide. 
The authoritarian Lukashenko, an admirer of the Soviet Union, has 
long pushed for uniting his nation of 10 million people with Russia's 
147 million people. In 1996, he and Yeltsin signed a union agreement, 
boosting political, economic and military ties between the two nations, 
but stopping short of creating one state. The two leaders have long 
pledged to take further integration steps but have in fact done little. 
It remains unclear whether today's agreements will be implemented, 
as many Russian politicians oppose a merger. Russian news reports 
said the proposed merger would be put to a plebiscite, but the text 
of the statement signed by Yeltsin and Lukashenko called only for 
``public discussion.'' Other top Russian officials quickly said there 
is no immediate plan to merge the two nation's armed forces or pool 
the government coffers. Lukashenko wants a merger to solve Belarus' 
economic problems, which have already led to food rationing in some 
regions. The Belarusian economy is one of the most unreformed in the 
former Soviet Union, with virtually all assets and markets under government 
control. ``The man who has brought his nation to a deadlock is now 
desperately trying to find a way out,'' Semyon Sharetsky, an opposition 
leader in Belarus, said of Lukashenko. In an immediate step to ease 
Belarusian economic woes, Yeltsin and Lukashenko agreed to allow Russian 
and Belarusian companies to import goods from each other at domestic 
prices. The agreement is crucial for Belarus, which relies on Russia's 
energy resources and has run up a huge debt. Domestic prices for Russia's 
oil and natural gas are still far below the world market price. Apart 
from the economic interests, many politicians in both nations believe 
that the main motive behind Lukashenko's drive for union is his ambition 
to run for the Russian presidency. Russian liberals and the West have 
assailed Lukashenko for his crackdown on the opposition and the independent 
media. Russian Communists and other hardliners publicly hail the proposed 
merger, but tacitly oppose it, fearing that the assertive Belarusian 
president would push them to the sidelines if he joins Russia's presidential 
race. The Russian government, struggling with the worst economic crisis 
since the Soviet collapse, has been lukewarm on the merger with even 
poorer Belarus.
