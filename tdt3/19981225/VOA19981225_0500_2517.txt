hour mass in St. Peter's Basilica. The Pope addressed a packed church, 
while outside, a large crowd had gathered to follow the ceremony televised 
on a huge screen in St. Peter's Square. Millions of people were able 
to watch the event broadcast live to some 40 countries around the 
world. During his homily, the Pope spoke about the upcoming jubilee 
of the year 2000. "My thoughts already turn to Christmas next year," 
the Pope said. "When, God willing, the Church shall inaugurate the 
great jubilee with the opening of the holy door. It will be a truly 
great holy year," the Pope added. "For in a completely unique way, 
it will celebrate the 2,000th anniversary of the event and mystery 
of the Incarnation." The Pope's words were focused mainly on the religious 
meaning of Christmas. "Jesus is born into a family, poor by material 
means. But rich in joy," he said. "In this extraordinary event, the 
mystery of God is revealed." Pope John Paul II no longer celebrates 
Christmas mass. But Catholics around the world will be expecting his 
customary blessing to the city and to the world at midday on Friday.
