Three adventurers trying to make the first nonstop round-the-world 
flight in a balloon abandoned their quest, ditching in the shark-infested 
waters off Honolulu a little more than halfway through their journey. 
Coast Guard helicopters hoisted them from the water Friday in good 
condition and high spirits. The men _ British mogul Richard Branson, 
American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden _ 
quit seven days into their journey after they lost the high-altitude, 
high-speed winds they needed to carry them eastward across the Pacific 
to North America. They had gotten caught in a low-pressure ``trough'' 
and feared they would be stuck there for a week. ``We're glad to be 
alive,'' Branson said. ``We thought we were going to make it all the 
way, but we hit a brick wall of bad weather.'' They lowered the 272-foot-high 
(83-meter), combination helium and hot-air balloon and let it hit 
the Pacific Ocean about 10 miles (16 kms) north of the island of Oahu, 
where the craft bounced across the water in three- to four-foot (1 
to 1.3-meter) seas for miles (kilometers) because the explosive bolts 
that were supposed to cut the balloon loose from the crew capsule 
had been frozen by the cold and didn't work. ``We bounced a lot on 
the water. It must have been 50 times until we finally dug in,'' Fossett 
said. Once the capsule settled in the water, they climbed out the 
escape hatches in the top and jumped off the back as the balloon continued 
to pull the craft through the water. The men, wearing their survival 
suits, were in the water no more than 10 minutes before they were 
hoisted in baskets aboard two Coast Guard helicopters, Fossett said. 
In a thank-you call to the operations control room in London, Branson 
said: ``It was a ridiculous way to spend your Christmas Day but it 
was certainly exciting.'' Lindstrand said he has ditched many aircraft 
in the past, but ``this was the worst. It was horrendous.'' Fossett, 
who was forced to ditch in the Pacific during an attempt to circle 
the globe earlier this year, described the landing as ``pretty smooth.'' 
Fossett said if the landing system had been operating correctly they 
could have touched down in Hawaii. ``But if you are going to be dragged 
on a landing, you are much better off doing it in the water,'' he 
said. The craft was not immediately recovered, but Fossett said plans 
were under way to salvage at least the capsule and the equipment aboard. 
All three balloonists have made a total of 11 attempts at a nonstop 
flight around globe, some of which ended in near tragedy. This time, 
as the balloon was landing, Fossett said, he was thinking ``about 
the fact that I've made three attempts to fly round the world just 
in 1998 and it's getting pretty discouraging.'' ``I think it's time 
to go sailing,'' Fossett said. The men were brought ashore at Barbers 
Point, about 10 miles (16 kms) west of Honolulu. U.S. customs inspectors 
were waiting to meet them and have them sign the declaration forms 
required of all those entering the United States. A stretch limousine 
from the Hilton Hawaiian Village showed up to take them to the Waikiki 
resort hotel. It also brought along the makings of a continental breakfast. 
The balloon voyage began on Dec. 18 in Marrakech, Morocco, and, if 
successful, would have ended in Western Europe. The crew had hoped 
to reach North America sometime Friday, flying over southern Canada 
or Washington state. They covered 12,500 miles (20,100 kms) before 
giving up. ``We were not told for 15 minutes whether they were alive, 
dead or injured,'' project director Mike Kendrick said from London. 
``I know it is a failure, but it is a glorious failure.'' Balloon 
pilots cannot steer or control their speed with any precision, relying 
instead on extremely fast, high-altitude winds to carry them around 
the globe. They navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to ascend 
or descend into different wind currents. After racing across the Pacific 
in winds of up to 200 mph (320 kph), the adventurers' balloon got 
sucked into a low-pressure system. They maneuvered the craft up and 
down between 6,000 feet (1,830 meters) and 27,000 feet (8,230 meters) 
to try to find a fast easterly wind. But the best they could do was 
a 16 mph (26 kph) wind. ``In the middle of the night we decided it 
was a hopeless situation,'' Fossett said. ``If we had kept going, 
it would have left us too far away from land for an easy pickup.'' 
Had the balloonists had made the American West Coast, they would have 
broken the balloon distance record that Fossett set on an attempt 
to circumnavigate the globe earlier this year. During the journey, 
the team secured permission from 97 countries to cross their airspace. 
Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea refused permission. The crew also 
had some tense moments when they passed over China farther north than 
the balloon had been authorized to fly. Branson was ready for another 
attempt. ``We've finally cracked everything in the technology,'' he 
said. ``We'll buck up ourselves and start again.''
