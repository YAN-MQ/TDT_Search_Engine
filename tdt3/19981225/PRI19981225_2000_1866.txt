In India, tens of thousand of barmaids in the city of Bombay have 
gone on an indefinite strike dampening Christmas spirits in the city. 
Sanjay Swevestaf filed this report. Bombay prides itself on being 
India's most cosmopolitan and fun-loving city, but for the nearly 
100,000 barmaids working here the going has been quite rough during 
the last couple of years. According to a spokesperson of the Barmaids 
Union, the decision to strike between Christmas and New Years was 
deliberate to attract maximum attention. The Barmaids Union is demanding 
an end to the practice of which bar owners forcefully attain up 40 
percent of the tips. The union is also demanding security for bar 
girls who switch jobs as there have been several instances in recent 
months of barmaids being beaten up for daring the join competition.
