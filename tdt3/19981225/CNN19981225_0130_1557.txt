In Russia, where kids write to "father frost" rather than Santa claus, 
economic turmoil is transforming Christmas wishes. Steve harrigan 
explains. Letters to father frost end up here, at the central post 
office in Moscow. This year, toys are giving way to more practical 
requests. 12-year-old Katya wants boots, for her grandmother. She 
writes -- "all the money is spent on food, and now my grandmother 
has broken shoes. I know how cold she is. I ask you very much, she 
needs boots. Her size is 38 wide. Father frost, please." It used to 
be a lot simpler, the postal workers say, before Russia's economic 
crisis. Before the letters would just say happy new year, or ask for 
a Barbie doll. Now they're asking for food. Food, and winter boots. 
"I've dreamed of having a nice doll from childhood," 11-year-old galya 
writes, "but all we've had are homemade ones. I ask nothing for me 
but please buy my sister winter boots size 41. For two years our parents 
have promised to buy her boots. Now my father threatens to make her 
wear his old boots. They are not pretty, and my sister is tall and 
pretty. You can do anything on earth, father frost, please give my 
sister some boots." The post office says it is unable to forward mail 
to father frost. The letters sit for three months. Then, those that 
have a return address are sent back to the children. Steve harrigan,
