Carbon monoxide fumes believed to have come from a faulty heating 
system sickened 250 people attending Christmas Mass in a village church, 
sending 40 of them to the hospital. The worshippers and the priest 
suffered headaches, nausea and vomiting as the Thursday evening service 
ended in Saverdun, a village in the southwestern Ariege region. Recognizing 
the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, a doctor called for help, 
and a crisis center was set up in a village hall, where throughout 
the night worshippers were treated with oxygen. Forty people, including 
young children and a pregnant woman, had to be hospitalized in nearby 
Toulouse or other towns. No lives were in danger, officials said.
