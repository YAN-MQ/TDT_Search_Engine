Don't believe all those year-end lamentations about a divided nation. 
As we close the book on 1998, there remains one common cultural denominator 
that does unite us all: sex. We have a sex-addicted president, a sex-obsessed 
independent counsel, sex-crazed media and a public so entranced by 
sex that not even McGwire and Sosa can entice us to spend more dollars 
on major league baseball than we do on videos rated XXX. To each American, 
apparently, his or her own home run. The trouble with sex as the reigning 
national pastime, though, is that it uses up all our oxygen. A brain 
fixated on sex _ even to moralize against it _ has no room for anything 
else. Non-Monica news and governance disappeared this year, as did 
the potentially grave non-Monica Clinton scandals. Not even lethal 
wag-the-dogging of Afghanistan and the Sudan could stand in the way 
of all flesh. Sex now rules so completely that politicians may soon 
become invisible unless they are exposed having illicit sex or are 
fulminating against someone else caught with his pants down. This 
month three of President Clinton's foremost adversaries _ Sen. Trent 
Lott, Rep. Bob Barr and Rep. Dan Burton _ have been tarred by scandals 
that only yesterday would have caused a major public and media uproar. 
But G-rated misbehavior now merits only yawns. Lott and Barr have 
both been revealed as fawning speakers at events sponsored by the 
Council of Conservative Citizens, a white-supremacist, immigrant-bashing 
organization that even David Keene, head of the American Conservative 
Union, has labeled racist. Among other beliefs, the Council proselytizes 
that interracial marriage ``amounts to white genocide'' and that Jews 
have ``turned spite into welfare billions for themselves.'' When they 
were outed for their involvement with this group, both politicians 
dutifully repudiated its views and then instigated cover-ups to try 
to camouflage the extent of their actual relationships with it. Barr, 
who gave the keynote address at the group's June meeting, dismissed 
his appearance as ``brief''; his story has since been demolished in 
excruciating detail by Jason Zengerle of The New Republic. For his 
part, Lott vowed he had ``no firsthand knowledge of the group's views'' 
_ a denial that became inoperative after Thomas Edsall of The Washington 
Post came across a 1992 newsletter in which the senator is pictured 
telling its members they ``stand for the right principles and the 
right philosophy.'' But what's lying about racism compared with lying 
about sex? Though two black columnists, Colbert I. King of The Washington 
Post and Stanley Crouch of New York's Daily News, have tried to generate 
outrage about this story, there are few takers in a market in which 
sex is the only currency. No ``indiscretions'' or ``improper relationship,'' 
no scandal. The same neglect may well befall the latest revelations 
about Dan Burton, the pit-bull congressman who became an instant All-Monica 
news headliner when he revealed a few months ago that he had fathered 
a love child. This week in Salon, reporter Russ Baker alleges that 
Burton's sexual peccadilloes may be matched by abuse of the same campaign 
fund-raising laws that were at the center of the botched House hearings 
he held to nail Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Some of the many Salon findings, 
drawn from interviews with more than 120 sources, have been amplified 
in The Washington Post and The Indianapolis Star. But the notion that 
Burton may have dialed for dollars (and perhaps foreign dollars at 
that) on federal premises or put a campaign manager (and part-time 
clown) on the House payroll is so far at most a blip on the national 
radar screen. By contrast, the Christmas Eve edition of USA Today 
pictures head shots of four likely presidential candidates _ Lamar 
Alexander, John Ashcroft, George W. Bush and Dan Quayle _ who have 
already declared their marital fidelity. In the accompanying article, 
a religious-right leader favored by the GOP, the Rev. Lou Sheldon 
of the Traditional Values Coalition, promises that he'll ask all impending 
candidates if they are now or have ever been adulterers. In a culture 
where all values, traditional and otherwise, lead to sex, why even 
bother to ask if any aspiring president has been a bigot or crook?
