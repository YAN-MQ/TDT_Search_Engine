A cold snap is causing problems for people across the country this 
christmas morning. Weather-related accidents have killed about 30 
people in Texas, Virginia, louisiana, North Carolina and Alabama alone. 
Streets everywhere are snarled with traffic. Flight delays and cancellations 
are also being reported at many airports. Hundreds of thousands of 
people have no electricity this morning. In California, three nights 
of freezing temperatures have wiped out most of the state's oranges 
and lemons. Industry losses were put at about $600 million.
