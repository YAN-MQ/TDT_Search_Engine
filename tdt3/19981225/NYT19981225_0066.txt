After Noliwe Rooks' grandmother suffered a stroke in church, the family 
gathered around her in the hospital, worried that she might not recover. 
Ms. Rooks had not seen her aged grandmother in almost a year, and 
she leaned close to whisper encouragement. ``Hi Grandma, I'm here,'' 
Ms. Rooks recalls saying. ``Her eyes got really big. The first words 
out of her mouth in 24 hours were: `Oh, my Lord! What did you do to 
your hair!''' Ms. Rooks, a visiting professor of history and African-American 
studies at Princeton University, had taken to wearing dreadlocks since 
her last visit to her grandmother, who preferred that she wear her 
hair straight. For black women, the quality of their hair, and how 
it is styled, has always been a sensitive issue. The way it is worn 
_ straight or not _ has all kinds of social and political ramifications. 
The ``hot button'' was pushed again recently in the tempest over the 
book ``Nappy Hair'' in a third-grade class at a Brooklyn public school. 
Although the book, by Carolivia Herron, is meant to be a celebration 
of the naturally kinky hair of a little girl named Brenda, parents 
of some students at the school expressed outrage at its use. Eventually, 
the teacher who was using it transferred to another school. While 
the controversy was complex, the issue was the implications of the 
word ``nappy,'' which some blacks find derogatory. Others are trying 
to reclaim the word as a positive, or at least neutral, expression 
describing black hair in its natural state. One thing is clear: The 
word can offend, reflecting the fact that black women who don't wear 
their hair straightened have long faced unsettling and unpleasant 
reactions, including tormenting comments by strangers, ostracism by 
relatives, prejudgments that they are somehow combative, even dismissal 
from jobs. But lately, more and more black women are finding happiness, 
not horror, in the tight curl of their hair. Far from unacceptable, 
in the eyes of many African-Americans, nappy hair worn in a variety 
of styles is in vogue. From the boardroom to the beauty pages, black 
women are forsaking chemical straighteners, or relaxers, and wearing 
their hair in dreadlocks, braids, twists and variations on the Afro 
that celebrate the stylish possibilities of black hair in its natural 
state. ``Nappy hair is definitely in,'' said Derrick Scurry, a hair 
stylist whose clients include more than 400 black women with natural 
hair. Alek Wek, one of fashion's most sought-after models, wears her 
hair in a close-cropped, chemical-free Caesar cut. The hip-hop star 
Lauryn Hill wears dreadlocks _ uncombed or twisted locks that were 
popularized by Rastafarians. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, wears 
thick braids in the style known as casama. And the tennis stars Venus 
and Serena Williams display their hair in cornrow braids with beads. 
The trend toward nappy hair has not gone unnoticed by advertisers. 
Retailers including Kenneth Cole and Banana Republic, J.Crew and Levi 
Strauss, are using black models, both male and female, with natural 
hair styles. In a Levi's ad, a black man with dreadlocks to his shoulders 
holds a sign saying, ``Conformity leads to mediocrity.'' ``No chemical 
is good for the hair, and black women are tired of their hair breaking 
off and falling out,'' said Ademola Mandella, the owner of Locks-n-Chops, 
one of several New York salons specializing in hair styles that do 
not involve chemical straightening and that report an increase in 
business over the past two years. ``Now that natural-hair salons are 
providing women with attractive and healthier hair alternatives, they're 
realizing that nappy hair is as beautiful and as acceptable as any 
other hair style,'' said Mandella. The history of black hair in the 
United States has often had its painful aspects, tracing to slavery. 
One way that blacks were made to feel inferior to whites was denigration 
of them for the texture of their hair, said Ms. Rooks of Princeton, 
whose book ``Hair Raising: The Roots of a Black Dilemma,'' chronicles 
the history of hair among blacks. ``It was believed that civilized 
people had straight hair and black people weren't even human, because 
their hair was kinky,'' Ms. Rooks said. ``The closer one looked to 
whites in appearance, the more deserving they were of rights and privileges 
of society.'' Out of this grew a caste system in which light skin 
and ``good hair'' _ hair that was nearly straight _ were prized, and 
dark skin and ``bad hair,'' often referred to as ``nappy,'' were held 
in contempt. In 1906, Madame C.J. Walker capitalized on this apprehension 
and became the first black American woman to become a self-made millionaire, 
selling hot combs for hair-straightening. Other companies followed 
suit, and so began the efforts of black people to hot-comb, conk, 
process, jheri curl, relax and do anything else just short of burning 
their tightly curled hair, or ``naps,'' into submission. More than 
a century after the official end of slavery, many attitudes about 
``good'' and ``bad'' hair persist. In 1981, Dorothy Reed, a television 
anchor in the San Francisco Bay area, was suspended for wearing braids 
on the air, and she subsequently switched to radio. In 1993, Barbara 
Cooper, an American Airlines attendant, was suspended when she showed 
up for work with her hair in cornrow braids. After a lawsuit, the 
airline revised its policy and now permits braids drawn back in a 
bun. And last month in Raleigh, N.C., Michelle Barskile, 17, a student 
at Garner High School, withdrew from a debutante ball after its sponsor, 
the local chapter of a predominantly black sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, 
required that she pin up her dreadlocks. The value placed on good 
hair among blacks themselves led Jill Nelson, the author of ``Straight, 
No Chaser: How I Became a Grown-Up Black Woman'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 
1997), to cut off nearly all her hair 15 years ago. ``I was tired 
of people placing a premium on something that doesn't matter, and 
I didn't want to get more or less points because of the texture of 
my hair,'' she said. Today she wears her hair longer, but still natural. 
The late-1990s trend for nappy hair styles has been compared to the 
black power movement of the 1960s, when the Afro style was a symbol 
of militancy or rebellion. But most women who wear natural hair say 
politics is less important than personal style. A black woman with 
natural hair is not necessarily making a political statement. ``There 
used to be a time when you could make reasonable assumptions about 
people's politics from their hair style,'' said Ms. Nelson, who remembered 
having to wash her hair in Tide to get an Angela Davis-esque Afro. 
``But hair is increasingly becoming depoliticized. Now it's more style 
than statement.'' According to Scurry, the stylist, women are seeing 
the wide variety of different looks that can be created with natural 
hair. ``Before, people heard `natural hair' and thought `Afro,' and 
now they're seeing you can corn-braid it, lock it, flat-twist it, 
twist it up when it's wet and unravel it for a textured look when 
it's dry,'' said Scurry, who was part of the team that gave John Galliano 
and his models dreadlocks for a Paris runway show in 1996. Natural 
styles like dreadlocks (today, ``locks'' is the preferred term), braids 
(in which strands of hair are braided together or synthetic hair is 
braided into real hair) and twists (hair that is twisted from the 
root to the end) often take two to eight hours to create in a salon, 
but they can last six weeks to three months. The natural styles take 
less time than maintaining chemically relaxed, or permed, hair, which 
must be treated every four to six weeks (for $40 to $70 at a salon), 
styled every week ($25 to $50 at a salon) and groomed every morning 
for 20 minutes or so. ``Having a perm was just too difficult for me 
to manage, timewise and financially,'' said Ngwah-Mbo Nkweti, 25, 
a licensed practical nurse in New Jersey who is also studying political 
science at Rutgers University. ``I got tired of pulling out the curling 
irons every morning and worrying about my hair breaking off.'' Ms. 
Nkweti wears her hair in braids that hang down her back. ``Now I can 
just get up and go, and my braids are stylish and very versatile.'' 
Shereece Holman, 28, an aspiring actress who used to work at a manufacturing 
company, said, ``I could never have walked into my old job with this 
hairdo.'' She wears an Afro weave, the '90s version of the '60s style 
in which extensions are woven into the hair, which is then allowed 
to grow out evenly all around. At Afrigenix, a salon in Manhattan, 
the Afro weave, at $250, is the most popular style. ``Even when I 
got tired of my relaxer and my `bouncing and behaving' weaves, I felt 
like I had to keep up that look in order to fit in,'' Ms. Holman said. 
But after beginning a regime of exercise and taking up a healthier 
diet, she decided it was time to do away with the chemicals. ``Growing 
my perm out is part of a holistic change I'm going through.'' Even 
as some embrace nappy hairdos, they still have the power to provoke 
strong reactions. Dwayn Catto, 35, learned this three years ago when 
he decided to lock his hair: He was initially ostracized by both whites 
and blacks. ``My white peers thought I was out of my mind, and my 
black peers thought I was a disappointment and an embarrassment,'' 
said Catto, who saw the new style as a way to prove to himself and 
others that he didn't have to conform to succeed. ``Corporate America 
will tolerate a yarmulke or even a turban, but the Afrocentric hair 
styles freak people out. People are always waiting to see if you're 
an angry black man.'' Appearance can be a bigger issue in the workplace 
when you are a television personality. A 20-year veteran of television 
journalism, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, wears her hair 
in twists and braids off camera, but covers them with a wig while 
on camera. ``I think American society is still very confused about 
this type of hair,'' said the woman, toying with her cheek-length 
twists. ``I think it's a distracting look on camera, and I don't want 
my hair to be the only thing people focus on.'' But there is also 
the case of Farai Chideya, an ABC News correspondent, who before joining 
the network let her bosses know that the $300 silky dread look that 
she has done four times a year is an immutable part of her appearance. 
``I'm happy to be nappy, and I'm lucky to have benefited from those 
who broke down barriers,'' Ms. Chideya said. ``I would never have 
had the jobs I've had, had things not gotten more relaxed.''
