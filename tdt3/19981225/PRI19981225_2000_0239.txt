The latest attempt to fly around the world non-stop in a balloon has 
ended in failure, but the three man crew is safe. American Millionaire 
Steve Fossett, British Tycoon Richard Branson, and Swedish Pilot Par 
Lanstrand, were picked up by the US Coast Guard after ditching off 
the Sea of Hawaii. Richard Branson describes what happened. When we 
landed, we were just dragged for miles and miles and miles. And water 
started coming into the capsule and we were fortunate to throw ourselves 
away from it. The balloonist abandoned their flight just passed the 
halfway market. They had already managed to navigate around fighting 
in Iraq. They also persuaded China to let them continue after entering 
its air space without permission.
