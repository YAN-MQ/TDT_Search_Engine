Japan's Cabinet unveiled a draft budget for 1999 on Friday that will 
double the size of the annual deficit as it pays for efforts to kickstart 
the nation's moribund economy. The 81.9-trillion yen (dlrs 706 billion) 
in proposed spending, which still must win approval from Parliament, 
represents a 5.4 percent increase from this year's budget. The budget 
proposal features 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86 billion) in new public 
works spending and tax cuts worth more than 9 trillion yen (dlrs 78 
billion). Both steps are aimed at lifting the economy out of its worst 
recession since the end of World War II. ``This draft budget for fiscal 
year 1999 has been made up with priority on promoting economic recovery,'' 
the Ministry of Finance, which compiled the spending proposal, said 
in a statement. The new spending comes as tax revenues are projected 
to shrink by 20 percent from this year due to the tax cuts and the 
weak economy. That would leave the proposed budget with a shortfall 
of more than 31 trillion yen (dlrs 267 billion), which the government 
must cover with new borrowing. That's about twice the 15.6 trillion-yen 
(dlrs 134-billion) deficit in this year's original budget. Japan's 
cumulative national debt is already larger than its gross domestic 
product _ a dubious distinction it shares only with Italy among developed 
nations. The U.S. national debt, by contrast, is just half its GDP. 
But Tokyo has set aside concerns about the ballooning size of its 
national debt since Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi took office this past 
summer and proclaimed reviving the economy as his administration's 
primary goal. The budget proposal also includes large increases for 
spending on social security, scientific research and programs to retrain 
unemployed workers. Foreign aid will total 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.6 
billion), a slight rise from this year. Military spending will slip 
0.2 percent as Tokyo cancels or postpones purchases of new ships and 
aircraft. But the budget would add 960 million yen (dlrs 8.3 million) 
to begin study of a joint ballistic missile defense system with the 
United States. Parliament will begin deliberating on the budget in 
January, in time for the start of fiscal 1999 in April.
