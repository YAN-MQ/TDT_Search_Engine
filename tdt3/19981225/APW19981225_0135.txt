Two brothers have been sentenced to death for stealing 260,000 yuan 
(dlrs 31,000) from a state-owned bank in China by manipulating its 
computer, a Chinese newspaper said Friday. Hao Jinlong and Hao Jingwen 
were sentenced Thursday in the central city of Zhenjiang for robbing 
a branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China where Jinlong 
worked, the People's Daily newspaper said. The two men stole the money 
by opening 16 bank accounts in September under false names, then breaking 
into the branch computer and transferring money into the accounts, 
the newspaper said. They tried to move the money to another bank, 
but could not produce appropriate identification to retrieve the funds, 
it said. The report did not specify how the brothers were caught, 
but said they had repaid all the money. The newspaper did not give 
any other details about the men or say whether an execution date had 
been set.
