For The World, I'm Derrick Stofall in the BBC News Room in London. 
There's been more fighting in the Serbian province of Kosovo today. 
International cease-fire monitors are trying to get Yugoslav forces 
and ethnic Albanian rebels to end their confrontation. William Walker 
is the head of the monitoring mission. Today, he met their leaders. 
Well, we're talking to both sides. We have been told by the way that 
the calling off the cease-fire by whoever did that in London that 
wasn't quite what the KLA wanted to say yesterday. We're being told 
down here by KLA spokesperson that they're still going to observe 
this cease-fire unless they are shot at. So, both sides are more or 
less saying the same thing that we're not going to start anything, 
but if the other shots at us, we will have to defend ourselves. William 
Walker, head of the Kosovo Monitoring Mission.
