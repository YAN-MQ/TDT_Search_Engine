Russia's Duma, or lower house of Parliament has given initial approval 
to an austerity budget for next year. Lawmakers put aside calls to 
postpone the vote after Prime Minister Jevgeniy Primakov threatened 
to resign. VOA's Peter Heinlein has details from Moscow. The Duma 
gave in and voted an overwhelming yes at the end of a day when Prime 
Minister Primakov alternately threatened and pleaded with lawmakers. 
The margin was 303 to 65. Before the debate began, the prime minister 
went to the Kremlin to tell President Boris Yeltsin he would stake 
the future of his government on what he called: "This severe budget." 
He said: "If the budget is not accepted, we will not stay in our jobs." 
Later, in an emotional speech to lawmakers, he emphasized the need 
for a budget to battle the worst economic crisis since the collapse 
of the Soviet Union. And he promised the Communist-led Duma, his government 
would place a greater emphasis on the state's rule in managing economic 
policy. He said: "In these harsh times of crisis, the state must be 
very active in creating a market using all the constitutional means 
at its disposal." The message appeared to be just what Communists 
and hard-liners wanted to hear. A day earlier, Communist leader Genadi 
Zhugonaf had urged a postponement of the vote. He told reporters the 
budget didn't go far enough in reversing what he called: "monitorous 
policies of previous governments." But he said his party had reluctantly 
agreed to give in to Mr. Primakov's pleadings. He said: "It is a bad 
budget, but how could it be anything else?" The Communist leader said 
his faction, the largest in the Duma, had concluded that Mr. Primakov 
and his Communist chief of economic policy, First Deputy Yuri Maslecof, 
were on the right track. The vote is considered a big victory for 
Mr. Primakov and his government. But it leaves several difficult questions 
unanswered. The prime minister earlier stated the budget was designed 
to restore confidence among foreign investors. But western analysts 
say the plan is based on several unrealistic expectations. Including 
a stable exchange rate, a 30 percent inflation rate, and the willingness 
of creditors to postpone about $9 billion in loan payments. The budget 
approved Thursday, calls for about $29 billion in expenditures at 
current exchange rates, $24 billion in revenues, with a $5 billion 
deficit. By comparison, the United States budget collects and spends 
more than $30 billion a week on average. Peter Heinlein, VOA News,
