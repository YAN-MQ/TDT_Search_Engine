A convicted cop killer wanted in connection with nine murders in Puerto 
Rico has been arrested and faces extradition, police said. Larry Llanos 
Walker, 25, had been a fugitive since January when he walked away 
from a work-release facility in San Juan where he was completing a 
sentencing on a drug possession charge. He was arrested as he walked 
out of a Schenectady home on Wednesday, police said. Schenectady police 
were contacted Wednesday by New York City detectives who said Walker 
was a suspect in a Dec. 17 stickup in Manhattan. Within hours of the 
5 p.m. arrest Wednesday, New York City police came to Schenectady 
to take Walker into custody, police said. NYPD detectives said Walker 
was dropped as a suspect after the victim failed to identify him during 
a lineup. However, Walker remained in custody Thursday in New York, 
awaiting extradition to Puerto Rico. The details of the nine murders 
could not be obtained late Thursday. Police said Walker is only a 
suspect in those killings, according to the Albany Times-Union. Walker, 
at age 14, was sentenced to 20 years for killing off-duty Rio Grande 
Police Officer Rafael Rivera Hernandez on May 16, 1989. Walker was 
freed after serving five years because he committed the crime as a 
juvenile. He later served time for robbery and drug possession and 
escaped while serving time for a 1997 weapons possession conviction.
