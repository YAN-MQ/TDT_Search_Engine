There is an Arctic. It is a slick day. Sleet fell from Texas and Virginia. 
Gray hound bus flins Nashville and Memphis resumed bus service late 
wednesday morning after stopping. Hundreds of people spent the night 
at the bus terminal. You wouldn't believe it, I came from St. Louis, 
Missouri, on my way to fem fist Tennessee and I wind up here. I've 
been here since 9:00 yesterday morning. I made friends with these 
people since I've been here. See, I like to make Friends. You can't 
blame the weather, I knew it was raining. I knew the weather was going 
to bad. When I left Memphis, it was already icy. But I didn't think 
it would move so hard, so fast through the area.
