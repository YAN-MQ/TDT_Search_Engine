Stock Exchanges in Europe are closed today for the Christmas holiday. 
Stock prices in the United States were mixed on Thursday. In a rather 
abbreviated session for the holiday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average 
closed at 9217, up almost 16 points for the week. The Industrial average 
came 314 points, or three and a half percent. The Standard & Poor's 
500 index closed at 1226, that was down two points. The NASDAQ Composite 
dropped nine and a half points to 2,163. And U.S. financial markets 
closed three hours early in advance of the Christmas holiday on Thursday. 
The markets reopen on Monday. Analysts say this week's bull market 
represents a classic year-end rally. With investment managers anxious 
to add to their stock portfolios before the end of the fourth quarter.
