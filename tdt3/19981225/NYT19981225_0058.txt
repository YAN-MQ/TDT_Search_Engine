Charles Dickens dashed off ``A Christmas Carol'' in six weeks in the 
fall of 1843. He needed money quickly because sales of his serialized 
``Martin Chuzzlewit'' were slack and the demands of his growing family 
(eventually 10) were not. The Christmas story netted far less than 
he had hoped, but it remains his best known and best selling. Today 
there are no fewer than 60 English-language editions in print. Dickens, 
then 31, had already written ``Oliver Twist,'' ``Nicholas Nickleby'' 
and ``The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club.'' He was midway 
through the 19 monthly installments of ``Chuzzlewit'' and told a friend 
that he thought it ``immeasurably the best of my stories.'' The public 
did not agree. He blamed his publisher and soon got another. In early 
October, Dickens went up to Manchester to visit one of the free Ragged 
schools for poor children at the request of his wealthy friend Angela 
Burdett-Coutts, with whom he frequently collaborated on charitable 
works. His biographer, Edgar Johnson, reports that Dickens came away 
with ``the inspiration for a cheerful, glowing, heart-moving story.'' 
He started writing in mid-October and finished in late November. As 
he would do with other stories, he borrowed generously from an earlier 
work, in this case ``Pickwick.'' Those ``papers'' tell of one Gabriel 
Grub, church sexton, an ``ill-conditioned, cross-grained, surly fellow 
_ a morose and lonely man, who consorted with nobody but himself.'' 
In ``A Christmas Carol'' Ebenezer Scrooge is cut from the same chilly 
cloth: ``hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck 
out generous fire; secret and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.'' 
Grub is set upon by goblins in the church graveyard one night and, 
like Scrooge, made to see what a wretch he is and persuaded to repent. 
In ``A Christmas Carol'' the goblins become ghosts of Christmases 
past, present and future. The Pierport Morgan Library owns Dickens' 
68-page manuscript of ``A Christmas Carol'' and puts it on display 
every year, this time through Jan. 3. It shows the hand of a man writing 
quickly but with the polishing touches, insertions and deletions of 
someone taking care with every word. For instance, Dickens originally 
wrote that Scrooge growled ``Humbug!'' when his nephew wished him 
``a merry Christmas, uncle!'' He later inserted ``Bah!'' and thus 
etched ``Bah! Humbug!'' into the language of scorn. Later on he introduces 
Bob Cratchit's boy as Little Fred, then inks it out and writes in 
Tiny Tim. Dickens' handwriting inside the front cover says, ``My own, 
and only MS of the Book.'' It is bound in red morocco and stamped 
with the name of his lawyer, Thomas Mitton. Dickens gave it to Mitton, 
from whom he appears to have borrowed money that year. The first printing 
of ``A Christmas Carol,'' 6,000 copies, started coming off the press 
a week before Christmas and sold out as fast as the books were available. 
The failure of ``A Christmas Carol'' to make much money for its author 
was largely his own doing. He insisted on a fine product _ four full-page 
hand-colored etchings, four woodcuts, a gilt design on the cover and 
gilt on the trimmed edges. Yet he wanted it priced inexpensively, 
to reach a wide audience. Beyond the disappointing profit from the 
book itself, pirated printings and theater stagings rarely paid him 
anything at all. Within two months of the original publication, there 
were eight theatrical adaptations. Dickens had sanctioned only one. 
In the 150-odd years since there have been who-knows-how-many more, 
and at least 11 films. There was, however, one hugely profitable spinoff, 
Dickens' readings to paying audiences. On the night of Dec. 27, 1853, 
he read ``A Christmas Carol'' to an audience of 2,000 in Birmingham 
Town Hall for the benefit of the Birmingham and Manchester Institute. 
At first the readings took three hours, even though he pared the story. 
Eventually he got it down to less than two hours. The New York Public 
Library owns the book from which he read for 12 years, with cues to 
himself scribbled in the margins: ``cheerful'' when Scrooge's nephew 
burst into the office on Christmas Eve, ``tone to mystery'' when Scrooge 
takes his ``melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern'' and 
``pathos'' when the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come takes him to ``poor 
Bob Cratchit's house.'' In some 470 public readings, all but 27 for 
money, he most often did excerpts from ``Pickwick'' and ``A Christmas 
Carol,'' so often that he knew them by heart. Sometimes he improvised. 
After a performance in Paris he wrote to a friend, ``I got things 
out of the old `Carol' _ effects, I mean _ so entirely new and so 
very strong, that I quite amazed myself and wondered where I was going 
next.'' Audiences loved him in his bright red vest and gold chains, 
even in the United States, where he had stirred some resentment with 
his critical ``American Notes.'' Scalpers were said to get as much 
as $26 for a $2 ticket to hear him. In New York City, his hotel near 
Gramercy Park reserved a stairway for him and posted a guard outside 
his door. The New York Times' critic called him ``one of the best 
living actors,'' citing his ``free use of gesticulation'' when Mrs. 
Cratchit stirred gravy, mashed potatoes and sniffed the Christmas 
pudding. Dickens died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1870, exhausted 
by the strenuous regimen of readings. He was 58. For his final performance 
he did the ``Pickwick'' excerpt and ``A Christmas Carol'' one more 
time. At the end he told the audience, ``From these garish lights 
I vanish now forevermore, with a heartfelt, grateful, respectful and 
affectionate farewell.'' He died three months later and was laid to 
rest in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey, attended by 12 people 
instructed by him in his will to wear no black bow, long hatband or 
other ``revolting absurdity'' of Victorian mourning.
