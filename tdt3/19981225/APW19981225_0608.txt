Auburn's Karsten Bailey and LSU's Joe Wesley, two players from highly 
disappointing teams, scored pivotal touchdowns Friday to lead the 
Blue to a 31-24 win in the Blue-Gray All-Star Classic of U.S. college 
football. Bailey, who ended the year as Auburn's career reception 
leader in the Tigers' (3-8) worst season since 1952, caught a 65-yard 
touchdown catch from Wake Forest's Brian Kuklick with 5:11 to play 
to put the Blue up 31-24. Wesley, a linebacker for LSU's (4-7) maligned 
defense, returned an interception 82 yards to tie it 24-24 with 12:31 
to play. His interception broke the 60-year-old Blue-Gray record for 
longest interception for a score, which was 62 yards set by Mississippi's 
Bill Schneller. Bailey was honored as the Gray team's most valuable 
player and Wesley was selected as its most valuable defensive player. 
The game is for top players whose teams don't advance to post-season 
bowl games. Stacey Mack, a running back from Temple, led the Blue 
team with three touchdowns and was chosen as its most valuable offensive 
player. It was a bittersweet finish to a 1998 season for Bailey and 
Wesley, who both expected to be elsewhere on Christmas Day. LSU was 
a preseason contender for the national championship and Auburn was 
the defending SEC West Division champions. But Auburn struggled offensively 
all season and Bailey felt he never had a chance to put up the numbers 
he thought he was capable of. He broke the Tigers' career reception 
record in a losing effort and said it prevented him from enjoying 
the feat. Playing for an LSU defense that failed to produce, Wesley 
and his teammates took much of the blame for the losing season.
