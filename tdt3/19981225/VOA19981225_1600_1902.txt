A leader of Sierra Leone's rebels says the insurgents will attack 
the capitol Freetown. Unless the government agrees to talks. Sam Bocari 
says the Revolutionary United Front has control of several towns around 
the capitol. And could attack at any time. His claims have not been 
verified. Britain has evacuated most of its citizens from Sierra Leone. 
But the commander of a West African peace-keeping force helping the 
government, told the Reuters news agency his troops have contained 
the rebels.
