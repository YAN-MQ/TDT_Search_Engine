Eight people were killed on Thursday in a Christmas Eve raid by apparent 
gate-crashers to a party, police said. The victims that included two 
injured were celebrating Christmas Eve with friends at their home 
when a group of men opened fire on them, police spokesman Bala Naidoo 
said Friday. It was not clear if the attack was connected to ongoing 
political clashes in the area. The alleged gunmen ``apparently wanted 
to gate crash the party but were refused entry,'' Naidoo said. The 
attack occurred about 11 p.m. on the southeastern coast of South Africa. 
Seven people survived the attack. The attackers took the family's 
music system and fled, Naidoo said. President Nelson Mandela on Friday 
expressed shock over the Christmas Eve attack. ``I appeal to members 
of the public not to take the law into their own hands and resort 
to any revenge attacks,'' Mandela said in a statement from his home 
at Qunu, near Umtata in the Eastern Cape.
