In one of the largest North Sea drug interceptions ever, Dutch and 
British customs authorities seized 19 tons of marijuana from a vessel 
off the Netherlands coast. The joint operation took place Thursday 
about 200 kilometers (120 miles) off the Dutch seacoast, Dutch television 
reported Friday. Officials arrested 12 people including the two ringleaders, 
a Dutchman and an Englishman from Sussex. Their identities were not 
released in line with Dutch police practice. The cannabis shipment, 
with an estimated street value of 190 million guilders (dlrs 85 million), 
was intercepted as it was being loaded from the vessel onto a smaller 
fishing boat, reports said. Authorities said there were indications 
the drugs came from North Africa for sale in the Netherlands, Britain 
and other European countries. The seizure came after a long period 
of surveillance.
