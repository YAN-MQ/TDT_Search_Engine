The first clue that the party would be different was the invitation. 
Once engraved and formal, this year it was more like a drugstore Christmas 
card. The cramped type invited ``you and three members of your family'' 
to a ``Winter Holiday Festival'' to be held on the South Lawn of the 
White House. The dress: casual attire. The annual White House Christmas 
bash for the press corps on Monday night became a mobbed jamboree, 
catering more to the Nickelodeon set than to ``Meet the Press'' pundits. 
The party, which in happier days had seen several hundred journalists 
with White House credentials (plus their bosses) lavishly entertained 
in the state rooms, had been moved to a tent. The cast of hundreds 
had become a cast of thousands. Surrounded by children, many who had 
attended the affair in the past were incensed, not to mention hungry: 
The once sumptuous buffet had been reduced to cookies. ``This is a 
disaster,'' said Mary McGrory, the longtime political columnist for 
The Washington Post, as she surveyed the crush of strangers. ``Look 
at these people. There are more of them than journalists.'' The indignity 
of it all _ members of the press corps having to share their White 
House with at least 4,000 others, most of whom had never attended 
a news conference in their lives. ``It's big-time payback time,'' 
echoed through the throng. Officially, the White House insists that 
no snub was intended. Hillary Clinton's press secretary, Marsha Berry, 
said a heavy travel schedule and a shortage of time were the only 
reasons for the change in format. But journalists are accustomed to 
reading symbolism into White House gestures. If President Clinton 
did set out to wreak revenge, he chose an effective way _ through 
demolishing their sense of pampered exclusivity. After waiting in 
lines and being herded past roped-off rooms, the guests were hustled 
outside, in two groups, into a tent designed for half their number. 
Within sight of the banquet table with an elaborate gingerbread castle 
in the State Dining Room, the crowd waited to be ushered outside. 
``That's where they used to put the food when they liked us,'' someone 
said. Gone was the extravagant feast that once included roast beef 
perfectly carved by White House butlers. Gone were the elegant mousses 
and handsome tarts served with coffee in the East Room. Gone, too, 
was an opportunity to mingle with the president and first lady and 
have a picture taken with them. Mrs. Clinton did not attend at all 
(she was laid up with a bad back) and the president appeared for a 
few minutes to make a short speech. There were face painters, ribbon-tying 
demonstrations, singing groups, a storyteller and a booth showing 
a film for children on skiing. ``Too much waiting,'' Chris Sesno, 
11, said. His father, Frank Sesno, Washington bureau chief of CNN, 
was more sympathetic. He said he always had thought it was a terrible 
imposition to force the president and first lady to smile in photographs 
with journalists who are their avowed enemies. ``This year particularly, 
I would think it was too much to bear,'' he said. Bill Plante of CBS 
News put the best possible face on the new jamboree format. ``There 
was entirely too much pushing and shoving to get on the list,'' he 
said. ``This party will never again be celebrated for its snob appeal, 
and I think that's a good thing.'' As is his prerogative, the president 
had the last word _ on Monday night, at least. Speaking of the families 
crowding into this year's party, he said, ``I hope this night is as 
much fun for them as it has been for me seeing them.''
