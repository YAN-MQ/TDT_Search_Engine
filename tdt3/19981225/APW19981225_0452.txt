The small army of Russia's ``shuttle traders'' has seen its business 
drop considerably since the start of the economic crisis and the drop 
of the ruble in August, officials said Friday. Soaring unemployment 
and wages that go unpaid for months have prompted millions of Russians 
to turn to ``shuttle trade'' _ traveling abroad to buy goods and selling 
them after returning to Russia. Between 10 million and 15 million 
people _ one-tenth of Russia's 150-million population and a major 
share of the country's work force _ have been engaged in shuttle trade, 
according to estimates carried by the ITAR-Tass news agency. But the 
fall of the ruble has made the shuttle trade unprofitable. In the 
first 10 months of this year, the volume of shuttle trade fell 14.4 
percent to dlrs 15 billion, ITAR-Tass reported, citing the Russian 
Trade Ministry. The report didn't give a breakdown for how much of 
that drop came after the August crisis, but the share appeared to 
be large.
