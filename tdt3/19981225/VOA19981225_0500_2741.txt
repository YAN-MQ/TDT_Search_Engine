The health mavens have probably told you that you shouldn't eat a 
lot of nuts. Because they're loaded with fat and not good for you. 
Well, a recent study at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, says 
nuts to that. Using data from the internationally known nurse's health 
study involving over 86,000 women. The researchers concluded that 
women consuming more than 140 grams of nuts per week were 35 percent 
less likely to have heart attacks than women who consumed less than 
30 grams. The study was published in the British Medical Journal. 
A similar study involving 22 thousand male physicians was presented 
at the recent American Heart Association conference. It showed that 
men who ate more nuts also had a substantially lower risk of cardiac 
death. What is it about nuts that's so beneficial? Researchers in 
both studies point to alpha-linolenic acid. A so-called N-3 fatty 
acid associated with heart attack prevention. Nuts, it seems, are 
loaded with it. Nuts also contain argonene, an amino acid that blocks 
blood clot formation, as well as magnesium, folic acid, potassium, 
fiber, and vitamin E. The researchers add that while rather high in 
fat, it's of the unsaturated variety that is associated with lowering 
cholesterol.
