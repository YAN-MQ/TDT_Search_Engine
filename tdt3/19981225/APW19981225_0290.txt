Hundreds of Protestant worshipers gathered for a Christmas Day service 
in a church gutted by fire in a riot, praying and singing hymns within 
mottled and blackened walls. But the congregation stood under a new 
metal roof that replaced the one that collapsed in flames last month, 
when a Muslim mob attacked and ransacked the church hours after a 
Sunday service. For weeks afterward, shaken but determined women cooked 
and brought food from home while their husbands, brothers and sons 
installed wooden pews, metal folding chairs and a borrowed sound system. 
``We have tried to renovate it by our own efforts,'' said Pang Pak 
Im, a deacon at the Taman Sari Protestant church in Jakarta, the sprawling 
capital of predominately Muslim Indonesia. Built in 1990, the church 
was among more than a dozen that were burned or ransacked on Nov. 
22 after religious and ethnic tensions triggered rioting that killed 
14 people. Muslim rioters shouted ``God is great'' as they smashed 
stained glass windows and statues of Jesus Christ. A week later, Christians 
in the city of Kupang in eastern Indonesia retaliated by setting fire 
to four mosques as well as a Muslim school and hostel for Islamic 
pilgrims. Beset by political uncertainty and a lingering economic 
crisis, Indonesia has endured sporadic riots since the turbulent ouster 
of former President Suharto in May after 32 years of authoritarian 
rule. Many people fear more violence ahead of parliamentary elections 
set for June as newly formed political parties jostle for influence. 
Student protests against Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, 
are expected to resume next year. Plans for a Christmas midnight mass 
at Jakarta's Roman Catholic cathedral were dropped months ago because 
of growing street crime linked to the worst economic turmoil in three 
decades. Millions of people have lost their jobs and prices of basic 
commodities have soared. Thousands of people attended daytime and 
evening Christmas services at the cathedral as well as at other churches 
around Indonesia. ``All of us are aware the situation in Indonesia 
is still unpredictable,'' said the Protestant deacon, Pang, who works 
as a manager of the Indonesian subsidiary of EMI records. ``People 
advised us to rebuild but we think it is unwise.'' Wary of the threat 
of more religious unrest, parishioners will hold off on renovating 
the church for at least two years. Much of the money they collect 
will be used to dispatch missionaries to villages around the archipelago 
nation of 200 million people. At a Christmas Eve mass, an odor of 
charred timbers lingered and several policemen stood guard outside. 
Worshipers, most of them ethnic Chinese, lit candles and sang ``O, 
Holy Night'' Ninety percent of Indonesians are Muslim, and the rest 
are mostly Christian or Buddhist. Religious tolerance is enshrined 
in the state philosophy, Pancasila, and Christmas is a national holiday. 
Many Christians are members of the Chinese minority, which has often 
been targeted in times of social unrest because of its relative wealth 
and perceived links to corrupt government officials. ``You have to 
be grateful for what you have,'' said parishioner Mary Lengkong, a 
health lecturer at the state University of Indonesia. ``But maybe 
deep down, there's a little fear.''
