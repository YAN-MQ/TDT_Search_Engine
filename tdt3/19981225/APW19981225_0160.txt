Following a Serb offensive against an ethnic Albanian rebel stronghold 
in Kosovo, both sides are vowing to keep fighting, dealing a new blow 
to U.S.-led efforts to bring peace to the region. International peace 
verifiers said an ethnic Albanian girl was killed in the town of Podujevo 
by a sniper in the Christmas Eve offensive. They had no other details. 
A statement from the Yugoslav army corps in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, 
said two soldiers were wounded in a ``terrorist attack'' Thursday 
on a military convoy in northern Kosovo. The army said its convoy 
was on ``regular practice activities'' when it came under automatic 
fire and hand grenade attacks. ``The Yugoslav army returned fire and 
destroyed the terrorist group,'' the statement concluded. Police also 
reported they captured a 24-year-old ethnic Albanian, Daut Rahmani, 
accused of killing two pro-Serb ethnic Albanians this week at a cafe 
in the town of Kosovska Mitrovica. The attack by Serb troops and tanks 
against six villages north of Pristina has sent hundreds fleeing into 
snow-covered hills. An Associated Press Television News crew saw the 
body of one man killed by an artillery shell in the village of Glavnik, 
and ethnic Albanians said several others were injured. A complete 
casualty count, however, was unavailable. The attack came after U.S. 
and NATO officials warned both sides against violence, which could 
threaten a fragile Oct. 12 cease-fire. That deal ended most of the 
fighting between government forces and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking 
independence for Kosovo from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic. In 
Belgrade, Serbia's ultra-nationalist vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, 
said ``our police must continue to clamp down against the terrorists.'' 
The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for the province's independence, 
stopped short of abrogating a separate cease-fire it proclaimed unilaterally 
just before the October deal was reached. In a statement issued in 
Pristina, however, the rebels said they would ``not sit idly by'' 
and would ``attack with all means available.'' Yugoslav army soldiers 
backed by tanks and artillery struck at rebel-occupied villages near 
Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina, purportedly 
searching for gunmen who killed a Serb policeman three days before. 
Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, fled the 
region on foot and in vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills around 
Podujevo. ``Both sides have been looking for trouble and found it,'' 
said William Walker, the American head of the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe's verification force monitoring the October 
accord. He expressed frustration at the apparent lack of will for 
a peaceful settlement. The OSCE reported heavy gunfire in the Podujevo 
area. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told BBC television that 
the Serb offensive was in ``clear violation of the commitments'' undertaken 
in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end eight months 
of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes. ``We remain fully vigilant 
and ready to act,'' Solana said. In neighboring Albania, the Foreign 
Ministry called for NATO to intervene to ``end the Kosovo drama'' 
and bring peace to the Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians form 
the overwhelming majority. Serb police said they encountered ``fierce 
fire'' but ``liquidated'' several ``terrorists'' in the rebel stronghold 
Lapastica, in a statement distributed Thursday night by the Yugoslav 
government's Tanjug news agency. In London, a KLA political representative, 
Pleurat Sejdru, told BBC-TV that the cease-fire ``doesn't have any 
sense to be in place.'' The U.S. and French governments condemned 
the Serb attack. The State Department also condemned all breaches 
of the cease-fire, including provocative attacks committed by elements 
of the KLA. About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their 
homes in fighting that began Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown 
on ethnic Albanian secessionists. That phase ended with an agreement 
between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, which averted 
threatened NATO airstrikes. But diplomatic efforts to forge a long-term 
formula for Kosovo's future have stalled, with both sides rejecting 
U.S. proposals.
