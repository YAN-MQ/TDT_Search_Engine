Pope John Paul celebrated his annual Christmas eve mass today at St. 
peter's basilica. More than 500 million people in 40 countries were 
able to follow the mass on television or on the Vatican's Internet 
site. The Pope says he's already thinking about next Christmas. On 
December 24th, 1999, he'll initiate a Jubilee year for the Roman catholic 
church, which will help launch the third millennium of christianity.
