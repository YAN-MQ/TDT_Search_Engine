NATIONAL FORECAST Arctic air will continue to lessen its influence 
on the nation's weather. The jet stream will blow more from the west 
to east across the country allowing a mixture of polar and Pacific 
air masses to dominate. Moisture will be limited east of the Rockies. 
A pair of disturbances will move in tandem toward the Eastern Seaboard. 
Low pressure will be induced off the Virginia coast as a southern 
disturbance acts on an old front offshore. Clouds will linger over 
much of the Southeast, but precipitation will be confined to the immediate 
shore during the morning. The northern disturbance will bring a cold 
front across the eastern Great Lakes with scattered snow showers. 
In between, a slice of dry and not-as-cold air will be found from 
the central Appalachians to the New England coast. High pressure over 
the Gulf States will sponsor dry and milder weather. Readings will 
rise above seasonal levels in the western Plains. The milder air will 
encourage thorough mixing of the lower atmosphere near the Rockies. 
This will lead to blustery conditions with fitful, powerful wind gusts. 
The boundary with a retreating polar air mass over the Middle West 
will become active with clouds and patches of light snow in the northern 
Plains. Snow will also fall mainly on the west slopes of the northern 
Rockies. A potent disturbance will approach southern Oregon causing 
heavy showers and more widespread mountain snows into northern Nevada. 
Sunny and warmer conditions are expected in the Southwest, but high 
clouds will arrive later in the day. Focus: Christmas Snow On Friday, 
a fresh coating of white blanketed Buffalo, N.Y., as a band of snow 
formed over upstream Lake Erie and hovered over the city. Close to 
one foot of snow fell in a narrow strip on the southeast side of the 
city. This marked the third time in the last four years that significant 
snow fell in Buffalo on Christmas. Much of Buffalo's snow occurs when 
cold winds crossing Lake Erie gather moisture, causing clouds and 
snow to form over and downwind of the lake. Despite the city's snowy 
reputation, records indicate that only a little more than half of 
all Christmases in the city have been white.
