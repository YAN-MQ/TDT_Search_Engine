33 Americans are celebrating a very merry Christmas. President Clinton 
gave them an early present yesterday, a presidential pardon absolving 
them of past crimes. The list included tax Dodgers, a man who went 
awol during the Korean war, and an alaskan man convicted of distributing 
marijuana. The government receives hundreds of applications for Pardons 
each year. They are reviewed by the justice department, which recommends 
Pardons for those who have served their punishment and have led productive 
lives.
