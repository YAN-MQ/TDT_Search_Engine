Fresh fighting erupted Friday near a rebel stronghold in northern 
Kosovo, where a Serb offensive dealt a new blow to U.S.-led efforts 
to bring peace to the region. The renewed clashes were confirmed by 
Jorgen Grunnet, spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe. He said William Walker, the U.S. diplomat who heads the 
OSCE's cease-fire monitors, had gone to the area of the fighting near 
the northern town of Podujevo. The fighting comes after U.S. and NATO 
officials warned both sides against violence which could threaten 
a fragile Oct. 12 cease-fire. That deal ended most of the fighting 
between government forces and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence 
for Kosovo from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic. About 1,000 people 
were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in fighting that began Feb. 
28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian secessionists. 
Details on the extent of the latest fighting were not immediately 
available. At least one person was confirmed dead from the offensive 
against several rebel-occupied villages which began Christmas Eve, 
backed by artillery and dozens of Yugoslav army tanks. International 
verifiers said an ethnic Albanian girl was killed by a sniper in Podujevo, 
30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital Pristina. The ethnic 
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center put Thursday's death toll at 
nine, including a woman and a 6-year-old girl, and said a large number 
were wounded. The government action was ``revenge aimed at killing 
10 ethnic Albanians for one killed Serb,'' the ethnic Albanian center 
said in a statement Friday. The United States, France and the European 
Union warned both sides against further violence. In an interview 
with the Serbian independent newspaper Danas, the EU envoy for Kosovo, 
Wolfgang Petritsch, said the international community ``will not tolerate 
an excessive use of force by the Yugoslav army'' in the province. 
Besides threatening to plunge Kosovo back into widespread combat following 
more than two months of a shaky peace, the fighting has raised new 
concerns for the safety of the OSCE verifiers. A team of peace monitors 
was threatened by a Serbian policeman Thursday while they were watching 
Yugoslav military barracks in Pristina from which tanks and armored 
vehicles were moving toward Podujevo, according to Grunnet. The policeman 
threatened to shoot unless the observers moved away, he said. ``A 
very strong protest was sent to Yugoslav authorities,'' Grunnet said. 
The Yugoslav government has pledged to protect the 600 verifiers, 
whose numbers are to reach 2,000 by the end of January. A NATO force 
of 1,800 soldiers is stationed in neighboring Macedonia to rescue 
them if needed. Serbian authorities have said the action was in response 
to the killing of a Serb policeman, and was reinforced after a ``terrorist 
attack'' on a convoy that wounded two soldiers Thursday. ``The Yugoslav 
army returned fire and destroyed the terrorist group,'' the statement 
concluded. Police also reported they captured a 24-year-old ethnic 
Albanian, Daut Rahmani, accused of killing a pro-Serb ethnic Albanian 
this week at a cafe in the town of Kosovska Mitrovica. The attack 
by Serb troops and tanks against six villages north of Pristina has 
sent hundreds fleeing into snow-covered hills. The Kosovo Liberation 
Army, which is fighting for the province's independence, stopped short 
of abrogating a separate cease-fire it proclaimed unilaterally just 
before the October deal was reached. In a statement issued in Pristina, 
however, the rebels said they would ``not sit idly by'' and would 
``attack with all means available.'' Walker expressed frustration 
at the apparent lack of will for a peaceful settlement. ``Both sides 
have been looking for trouble and found it,'' he said. NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana said Thursday the Serb offensive was in ``clear violation 
of the commitments'' undertaken in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to end eight months of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes.
