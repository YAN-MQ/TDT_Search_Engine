Up next, NBC news "in depth" -- laid off during the holidays. Why 
so many this time of year? And what happens when, instead of a Christmas 
bonus, you get a pink slip? Searching for an echinacea to help support 
your immune system? Nature's resource knows you should look for an 
echinacea... that contains chicoric acid and polyphenols to get results. 
And unlike some, nature's resource guarantees... the potency and purity 
you need. Make your herbal resource nature's resource. Time is running 
out on Buick's swing into '99. And for a short time only, we've got 
numbers that'll make your head spin. And a new twist-- but these numbers 
won't be around much longer so better jump now. Swing into your Buick 
dealer today.
