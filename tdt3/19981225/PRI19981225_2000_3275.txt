To close today's program, a bit of holiday music by William Bene The 
music may sound familiar. The voice may as well. It is Angeli Kigo, 
a popular artist on the world music scene. Originally from Bene and 
now living in Paris, Kigo has built a faithful following since her 
debut in 1990. This is her rendition of the Christmas Carol "O Holy 
Night". She recorded it to benefit the American Special Olympics Foundation.
