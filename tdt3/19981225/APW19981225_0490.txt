Carbon monoxide fumes from a faulty heating system sickened more than 
200 people attending Christmas Mass in a village church, sending about 
50 of them to the hospital. Worshippers and the priest suffered headaches, 
nausea and vomiting as the Thursday evening service ended in Saverdun, 
a village in the southwestern Ariege region. Recognizing the symptoms 
of carbon monoxide poisoning, a doctor called for help, and a crisis 
center was set up in a village hall, where through the night 217 worshippers 
were treated with oxygen. Some 50 people, including young children 
and two pregnant women, had to be hospitalized in nearby Toulouse 
or other towns. But no lives were in danger, said regional prefect 
Philippe Zeller. He added the church will stay closed until officials 
determine it is safe. A police investigation confirmed that a faulty 
heater was at fault, he said. The church building had not been inspected 
in the last few years, but Zeller said such inspections are not mandatory 
at churches. Therefore, a judicial investigation will not be launched.
