National Football League quarterback Randall Cunningham enjoyed a 
renaissance in his career this season with the Minnesota Vikings. 
At 14 and one, the team has the best record in the NFL. Headed into 
the final weekend of the regular season. The Vikings have rewarded 
the 34 year old Cunningham with a five year contract extension. But 
terms of the deal were not disclosed. Cunningham will be paid as a 
starter next season instead of as a backup behind the now-injured 
Brad Johnson. Randall says he has not completely felt the impact of 
his good fortune. It's hit me, but it hasn't hit me where I'm going 
to start crying or anything yet. But I'm sure that when I get home 
with my family, and we sit down and we start dwelling on it a little 
bit more. I'll show a whole bunch more appreciation for it.
