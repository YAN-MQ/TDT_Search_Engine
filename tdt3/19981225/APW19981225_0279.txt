New York-based PaineWebber Group Inc. and Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance 
Co., one of Japan's top insurers, announced plans Friday to set up 
a jointly owned company to sell mutual funds in the Japanese market. 
The joint venture, called Yasuda PaineWebber Mutual Fund Co., will 
open its doors in April and aims to carve out a share of Japan's estimated 
dlrs 9 trillion pool of personal savings. It will specialize in developing 
and marketing investment trusts _ Japan's version of mutual funds 
_ ahead of the expected introduction of retirement savings plans similar 
to the 401(k) common in the United States. The accord builds on an 
11-year business alliance between the two companies that has been 
fortified by Yasuda Mutual's purchase of an 8.1 percent stake in PaineWebber. 
PaineWebber will take a 45 percent share in the venture, with the 
remaining majority stake going to Yasuda Mutual and a Yasuda affiliate. 
The move is the latest example of an American financial powerhouse 
expanding its presence in Japan, which recently has begun deregulating 
its banking, brokerage and insurance industries. In October, Wall 
Street investment bank J.P. Morgan and Co. said it would set up a 
Tokyo-based mutual fund business with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., one 
of Japan's largest lenders. Prudential Insurance Co. and Mitsui Trust 
and Banking Co. agreed in July to open a joint mutual fund company. 
Earlier this year, Merrill Lynch and Fidelity Investments Co. both 
announced plans to set up separate nationwide retail networks in Japan.
