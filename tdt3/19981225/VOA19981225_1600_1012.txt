Tens of thousands of people in the Southeastern United States greeted 
Christmas Day without electricity. After being hit by ice storms. 
In Virginia, about 300 thousand homes and businesses went dark after 
the first major winter storm of the season crippled power service. 
Sleet and freezing rain caused some power lines to snap. Utility workers 
in Tennessee are trying to restore power to about 100 thousand customers. 
The cold spell made driving perilous across the nation. And sent scores 
of cars spinning out of control. At least 30 deaths have been blamed 
on the freezing conditions.
