Witnesses say nine civilians have been killed in renewed fighting 
between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The latest 
shoot-outs took place early Friday, near the northern town of Portevo. 
Serbian authorities and ethnic rebel forces blame each other for starting 
the attacks. The Separatist rebel group known as the Kosovo Liberation 
Army says there is no point in continuing the ten week-old cease-fire.
