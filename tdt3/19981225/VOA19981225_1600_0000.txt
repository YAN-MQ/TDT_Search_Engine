There is no peace this Christmas in Kosovo. Where witnesses say nine 
civilians have been killed in renewed fighting between Serb security 
forces and ethnic Albanians. Or in Sierra Leone, where fighting threatens 
the capitol, Freetown. Exiled Saudi militant Usamah Bin Laden renews 
calls for attacks on American, British, and Israeli targets. Pope 
John Paul II addresses millions of people around the world on Christmas 
Day. Speaking of the world's many problems. Which are in strident 
contrast with the serenity of Christmas. I'm Tony Riggs, inviting 
you to stay tuned for details of those stories, a sports update, and 
more. As this hour of VOA News Now continues. First, a summary of 
world news. I'm Rebecca Ward, VOA News.
