A unique exhibit soon will showcase Marine life from California's 
his tear just Monterey Canyon. Don Knapp reports. It's only a short 
boat ride from Moss landing, California, to some of the most remote 
and unexplored territory on earth, the deep sea bottom of monterey 
Canyon. Few will ever see its mysterious depth. But this robot will 
eventually bring its secrets to the surface for display at a new exhibit 
at the Monterey bay aquarium. Look at this nice sponge here. The crew 
of the aquarium's research vessel guide the robot that cruises thousands 
of feet below. Its lights and live cameras searching for rare life 
forms. One next to the fish. One there and these two right here. a 
claw plucks plants and creatures from the mud and puts them in a collection 
box. To be transported to the surface. Finding them is the first challenge. 
Then being able to pick them up and bring them back to the surface 
unharmed is the next challenge. The predatory tenecut will be one 
of the stars at new exhibit. It's kind of a Venus fly trap-type animal, 
it's very transparent, very odd looking creature. I've never seen 
anything like it. Other types of things we're collecting be lobsters 
and crabs. The ocean's surface is an alien hostile environment for 
these creatures. Some can't survive without deep sea pressure. But 
researchers have learned others will live if they keep the water dark 
and cold and reduce its oxygen. Even creatures that can't survive 
at the surface will find a place at the new aquarium's deep sea exhibit. 
I'll give you a zoom, okay, here we go. They'll be there on the monitors. 
The robot will beam them up live from the deep. Don Knapp, CNN, San 
Francisco.
