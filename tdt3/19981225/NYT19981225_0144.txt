The millennial fever that peaked a year or two ago with predictions 
of the death of virtually everything, classical music pointedly included, 
seems to have subsided. As bang already gives way to whimper, by the 
time the epochal event arrives we'll be grateful if the 2000-phobic 
computers work the next day. Even when prospects were said to be most 
dire for classical music, all you had to do to restore your faith 
in the future was to hear some of the splendidly talented and spirited 
performers on their way up, like the New York String Orchestra, made 
up of students from around the nation, in its annual holiday outing 
at Carnegie Hall. And its latest edition in its first concert, with 
a Mozart program on Thursday evening conducted by Jamie Laredo, offered 
nothing but hope. The Overture to ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' received 
perhaps as fine and spirited a performance as this weathered listener 
has ever heard. Bubbling and effervescent, it flew by in an instant. 
Things only got better in the C minor Piano Concerto, with the brilliant 
yet unpredictable Peter Serkin as soloist. Serkin seems to delight 
in the give and take of collaboration, interacting with partners in 
highly specific ways. The results can sometimes seem perverse, as 
in a weirdly deconstructionist new RCA recording of the Brahms violin 
sonatas with Pamela Frank. But here Serkin seemed to feel that the 
best way to communicate with these young players was on a straightforward 
level, and the interpretation may therefore have been all the more 
profound. He was willing to be led, but even more tellingly, he led 
the orchestra into fulminating depths in the development section of 
the first movement. His exchanges with the wind players, drawn mostly 
from the Juilliard School in New York and the Curtis Institute in 
Philadelphia, were especially eloquent and delightful. Mozart's ``Haffner'' 
Symphony ended the evening, sounding a little slack and anticlimactic. 
This 7 o'clock concert was performed without intermission, a holdover 
from the more romantic days when the Christmas Eve program was performed 
toward midnight. But this may have been just too long an uninterrupted 
sit for these young performers. However that may be, they gained valuable 
experience of another sort as well, since the concert was the first 
event in Carnegie since the death of the hall's beloved executive 
and artistic director, Judith Arron, last week. To begin the evening, 
Laredo led them in the Air from the Bach Suite in G, a movement played 
by many orchestras to honor the memory of a fallen colleague. ``We 
play it for her with much love,'' Laredo said, and the musicians did 
just that. But he might have done better to suppress the applause, 
treating this as something other than a ``performance.'' No matter: 
that is a lesson these young players will learn all too often before 
their careers are well advanced. For the immediate future, Laredo 
and the orchestra are to perform again on Monday with alumni, including 
the concertmasters of four orchestras: the Boston and Baltimore Symphonies, 
the Cleveland Orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
