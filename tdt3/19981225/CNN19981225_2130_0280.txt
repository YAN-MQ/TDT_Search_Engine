The three men who were trying to circle the globe nonstop in a balloon 
are spending the night at a resort in waikiki, Hawaii, instead of 
27,000 feet in the air. Rusty Dornin tells us what happened. They 
weathered the storms of world politics. But when the winds stopped, 
so did they. The round-the-world balloon attempt by British billionaire 
Richard Branson, american Steve Fossett and Swede per lindstrant came 
to a watery end christmas day. They ditched the balloon in the pacific 
ocean ten miles north of oahu, hawaii. We were three days from home 
and to just abandon it to the sea just because of this weather block 
-- it was sad. The ico global balloon was sailing well on its way 
to record books, riding a 200-mile-an-hour jet stream over the pacific 
Thursday. Suddenly, they ran into a low pressure system northwest 
of Hawaii. It was like hitting a brick wall. In the middle of the 
night, we decided that it was a hopeless situation. And we decided 
we would take the opportunity to fly as close as we could to hawaii 
to make an easy rescue. Taking off from marakesh on December 18th, 
the trio had been forced to navigate around storms, the bombing of 
Iraq, three other nations besides Iraq that refused them airspace 
and diplomatic problems with China that forced them off course. Plagued 
by politics, forced down by nature. It's a very, very difficult thing 
to circumnavigate the globe. Otherwise, someone else would have done 
it by now. Richard Branson has tried and failed three times. Steve 
Fossett, the Holder of the distance and duration record, has tried 
and failed five times. This attempt, lasting 7 days and 11 hours, 
did not break any balloon records. The capsule was dragged across 
the whitecaps for an uncomfortable ride, but the crew was plucked 
safely from the water by the U.S. coast guard. Already, there are 
thoughts about the next time. You climb out saying, "never again." 
But the next day you climb in and say, "let's go for it." Branson 
says they will try to get back with family and friends for the rest 
of the Christmas holiday. Rusty Dornin, CNN.
