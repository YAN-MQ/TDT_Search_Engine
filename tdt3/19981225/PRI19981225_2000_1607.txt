And now a brief not on this all-consuming season. If there's anyone 
under the age of three in your house, this sound may be familiar. 
Talking Teletubbies have been a popular gift this holiday season. 
In Hong Kong, though, consumers are buying Talking Teletubbies instead. 
The knock-off toy is just one of a long list of counterfeit products 
sold on Hong Kong street says the World's Michael Swito, a tread that's 
growing as Asia's financial crisis persists. You've got your Teletubbies. 
You've got your Hello, Kitty products. There must be a million different 
types of Hello, Kitty stuff. And for the adults, you've got your Gucci 
watches, your Chanel and Pradha handbags. You can pick up a Sony PlayStations, 
CD, a new game, for less than $3 US. Just the other day, I bought 
a Polo shirt on the street for about $9 US. It might be real, because 
the factories have excesses over in China, or it could be a rip-off. 
I don't know. I'll see when I wash it. The company that handles the 
British Teletubbies in Hong Kong has hired investigators to catch 
the Teletubbies culprits.
