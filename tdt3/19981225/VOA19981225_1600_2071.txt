Peruvian police say nine people were killed, and at least seven injured 
in a panic after unknown attackers threw a tear-gas bomb into a crowded 
discotheque near Lima on Christmas Eve. When the gas-bomb was thrown 
into the middle of the dance floor, more than 200 people fought to 
get out of the club. Some people were crushed underfoot and asphyxiated 
in the chaos. Most of the victims are teenagers.
