Sierra Leone's capitol, Freetown, was reportedly quiet on Thursday. 
As West African peace-keepers tightened security around the city. 
VOA's John Pitman reports from our West Africa Bureau. After several 
days of intense fighting on the outskirts of Freetown, the day before 
Christmas saw the return of semi-normalcy to the capitol. The West 
African peace-keeping force, ECOMOG, has sent reinforcements to Sierra 
Leone from neighboring Liberia. These additional one thousand troops 
are being used to enhance security on the roads leading into the capitol. 
Allowing some commercial traffic to resume. ECOMOG commanders say 
the peace-keepers have also increased the number of patrols in the 
city to prevent rebel infiltrators from slipping in unnoticed. On 
Tuesday, rebels from the Revolutionary United Front clashed with ECOMOG 
troops only 30 kilometers from Freetown. Raising concerns that the 
capitol itself could come under direct attack. However, after a day 
of heavy fighting in the town of Waterloo, an ECOMOG spokesman said 
the rebel incursion had been stopped. And that the rebel force had 
been chased into the bush. John Pitman, VOA News, West Africa Bureau.
