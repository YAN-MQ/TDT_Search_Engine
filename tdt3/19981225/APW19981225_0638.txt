A rebel attack on the highland city of Kuito killed and wounded dozens 
of people, some sheltering in a Roman Catholic church, but Christmas 
services went ahead Friday during a lull in the shelling, church workers 
said. Thirty people were killed and 37 were wounded Thursday in the 
heaviest rebel attack on the besieged city since fighting between 
UNITA rebels and the government flared anew early this month, the 
private Radio Eclesia reported. Nine of the dead were killed when 
mortar fire hit a Roman Catholic church in Kuito's outskirts, the 
Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted military sources as saying. ``I 
can't express what it was like,'' a church worker in Kuito, who did 
not identify herself, said Friday, referring to the intensity of Thursday's 
all-day shelling. People emerged from shelters during a brief lull 
Friday morning to attend Christmas services, but UNITA rebels entrenched 
around Kuito began shelling the city again Friday around noon, a male 
church worker said. Kuito, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast 
of the capital Luanda, has been a major focus of the latest fighting 
between UNITA rebels and government forces, which has sent more than 
50,000 people fleeing from their homes. The fighting has undermined 
a 1994 peace accord that called for UNITA to disband a 70,000-strong 
guerrilla army and hand over control of almost half the country to 
the government. The U.N. Security Council has blamed the renewed fighting 
on UNITA and expressed dismay that Angola appears headed back to civil 
war, which has ravaged the southern African nation for most of its 
nearly quarter-century of independence. The government regained control 
of Kuito from the rebels during the intensive conflict that followed 
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi's refusal to accept defeat in the country's 
first elections in 1992. Kuito's population of about 100,000 was swollen 
with a further 30,000 displaced in the past two weeks, as battles 
raged throughout the central highlands. ``A lot of people have come 
from other towns and villages and they have nothing to eat,'' the 
female church worker said. Relief agencies have stopped flying food 
and medicine into the city's airport that has been targeted by the 
rebels to prevent the government from sending in reinforcements. Angola's 
civil war began in 1975, following a 14-year fight for independence 
from Portugal's colonial rule. About half a million people were killed, 
and hundreds of thousands were left maimed, homeless and exposed to 
disease and hunger. UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola _ has an estimated 30,000 guerrilla soldiers hiding in the 
vast southwest African nation. The government has 100,000 troops.
