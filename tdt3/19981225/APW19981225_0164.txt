A clash between two rival gangs in the Tajik capital left two people 
dead and one wounded, officials said Friday. The clash highlighted 
the continuing instability in the former Soviet republic in Central 
Asia, reeling from a five-year civil war. Government officials did 
not identify the groups or explain what the clash was about. Despite 
a peace treaty between the hardline government of President Emomali 
Rakhmonov and the opposition last year, periodic clashes have continued. 
Officials have failed to rein in numerous warlords. The clash Thursday 
ended after opposition leaders intervened. The opposition headquarters 
refused to give any further details. Shootings, abductions and other 
violence have remained widespread in the impoverished mountainous 
nation. Last month, more than 200 people were killed in several days 
of fighting between government troops and a group of rebels.
