N finally tonight, imagine what it would be like to fight a bitter 
war with your neighbors just to keep your church intact. NBC's Bob 
Dotson has the story of one community, and one very brave woman, who 
brings new meaning to the phrase "keeping the faith." This small church 
has seen precious little peace on earth. In the past 230 years it 
has been destroyed by war, a tornado, arson and racial hatred. St. 
John Baptist church is an easy target for vandals. It sits on an isolated 
road west of Columbia, South Carolina, just a couple of miles from 
where the Ku Klux Klan used to meet. The congregation, descendants 
of slaves, remains because one woman bravely raised her voice. I found 
smashed tombstones -- Graves desecrated, just dug up. Ammie Murray, 
a neighbor, saw the damage and could not turn away. When I came in 
this church, the figure of Christ on the cross that they had, they 
had cropped Christ's arms off and they were hanging by the nails. 
Through her contacts as a labor union business manager, Murray organized 
an army, black and white, to rebuild St. John. Some hated that. There 
was a tremendous amount of vandalism. "stick" Harris, a captain in 
the sheriff's department, has arrested more than 200 vandals and trespassers. 
People started trying to run ammie off the road. Harris is still searching 
for them and for the people who threatened her grandchildren, and 
killed her dogs. My feet wanted to get out of here. But my heart wouldn't 
let me. 2,000 others have stayed with her for 14 years. They far, 
far, far outnumber the evil. Today, one of America's oldest congregations 
gets its fifth new church. We'll be back in a heartbeat to build this 
church again. If they mess with it, we'll be back. To surrender, they 
believe, would leave life as it as is, not as it should be. You don't 
see color out here. You see love and caring and compassion. And everyone 
who wants peace on this little patch of earth. Bob Dotson, NBC news, 
dixiana, South Carolina.
