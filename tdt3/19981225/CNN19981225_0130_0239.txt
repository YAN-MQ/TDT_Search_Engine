There's no snow, just lots of sand. But U.S. troops in the Kuwaiti 
desert are still celebrating Christmas in their own special way. Martin 
Savidge explains. Christmas eve at multwaa Ridge where the 31st Marine 
expeditionary unit is dug in 35 miles from the Iraqi border. The wind 
blows without letup, kicking up sand that gets into everything -- 
clothing, eyes, even Christmas eve dinner. A little sand in the lasagna, 
but you're going to expect that in the middle of the desert. Better 
than MREs, it's a good change. There are no Christmas trees here. 
No twinkling lights. Only rifles, machine guns and anti-tank Rockets. 
The routine of life near the front doesn't waver for the calendar. 
Soldiers come in. Others go out to replace them. On the surface Christmas 
may seem a million miles away in this landscape. But to find it, you 
only need to look within. Back home? I would be spending it with my 
wife and two kids, Christmas eve. But I try not to think that. I think 
about the moment in hand right now, and I just take care of what I 
am doing. Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born It's 
their life, to be in far-flung places during the holidays. But they'd 
rather be at home. Every one of them will tell you that. To be home 
-- hey. To be home opening Christmas presents tomorrow would be cool. 
If I could, I just want to say merry Christmas to my wife Maria, my 
son robert and my daughter Michelle. I love you, guys. And I wish 
I was there with you. What then, will this child be? Nearby, a chaplain 
tells a story of a child born long ago in another time in another 
desert. There are only simple pleasures here. No holiday spectacles. 
Just the sunset and gifts that are made, not bought. Anything you 
can make out of the desert. You know, Coke can, make something weird 
out of it or mre trash. Anything kind of crazy. As the darkness sets 
in, the Marines become ghosts, threatening to be swallowed by the 
wind and the sand. They will pass the night in blackness to wait for 
the dawn of Christmas day. Martin Savidge, CNN, Kuwait.
