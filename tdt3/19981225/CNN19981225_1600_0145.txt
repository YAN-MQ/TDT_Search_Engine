It's turning out to be a white Christmas and more. For many people 
across the U.S., winter is definitely making its Mark, as daryn Kagan 
reports. Cold, sleet and freezing rain meant a very silent night for 
residents of the southeast. The heavy ice caused tree branches and 
power lines to snap. In Mississippi, repair crews are out today. But 
some residents could be without power until Monday. Farther north 
in Virginia, drivers had to move slowly and gingerly. Heavy icing 
caused downed trees. And at one point, hundreds of thousands there 
were without power. Those who didn't drive were probably waiting it 
out at the airport. From Atlanta to Seattle, was the same situation 
-- long lines and long delays. When you have the traffic of the holidays, 
just puts a lot of stress on the system to begin with. When you add 
a storm, it really creates almost unsurmountable odds. In the northwest, 
the forecast calls for an end to the snow that has plagued the Seattle 
area. But police, who have seen too many accidents in the past couple 
days, still have a warning for Christmas day drivers. If you don't 
have to drive, don't drive. If you have to drive, slow down. And for 
those bearing the brunt of the cold weather across the nation, here's 
something to think about. Miami hit a record 83 degrees on Thursday. 
The forecast says sunny skies and near 80 through the weekend. Daryn 
Kagan, "CNN Headline News."
