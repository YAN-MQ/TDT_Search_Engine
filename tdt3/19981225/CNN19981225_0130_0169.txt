Around the world, festivities are under way as people usher in Christmas 
eve. In Bethlehem, the city where Jesus is said to have been born, 
many cultures meet to Mark the holiday. In that town alone, religious 
services can be found in English, French, arabic and aramaic, the 
ancient language of Jesus. In battle-weary Kosovo, a small Christian 
community is making its preparations. Many are hoping the season of 
peace and joy will be the start of a new chapter in the region's history. 
Another place of recent conflict, Baghdad, is also marking the holiday 
season. Some Iraqi children are being taught Christmas carols by the 
peace group "Voices in the wilderness." And the streets of Tokyo are 
covered with holiday decorations. In spite of the region's economic 
downturn, many Japanese are busy buying presents and party fixings.
