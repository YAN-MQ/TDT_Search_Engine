As a hitchhiking German teen, he drew Jesus on Marseille sidewalks 
to make money. As a Greens lawmaker, he wore jeans and sneakers. On 
Wednesday, Joschka Fischer makes his first trip as foreign minister 
beginning with Paris, and wearing a suit. The trip, the day after 
he was sworn in, aims to reassure European partners the new German 
government will stress continuity, including the Franco-German engine 
behind the European Union and its euro single currency. After all, 
the two countries are each other's biggest trading partners, something 
Germany's reformed and moderate Greens party has learned to accept 
under their leader Fischer. But Fischer's next stops, in Britain and 
Poland, also aim to show Germany doesn't see the Paris-Bonn link as 
exclusive. ``Europe is a polygon,'' the 50-year-old Fischer has said. 
French officials insist it doesn't bother them. ``Let's not pretend 
we're scaring ourselves!'' Socialist Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, 
who was scheduled to meet Fischer for the first time, said in Wednesday's 
edition of Le Figaro. ``Germany doesn't hesitate anymore at defending 
its national interests. So what?'' he told the conservative daily. 
The Franco-German engine is ``not enough, and it must be widened with 
close relations with each of our other EU members.'' Fischer was also 
meeting Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, Greens Environment 
Minister Dominique Voynet and the Socialist head of the National Assembly's 
foreign affairs committee, Jack Lang. Fischer has sought to demonstrate 
that Europe's most economically powerful and populous nation, even 
with a Greens foreign minister, will continue to support European 
unification. ``There is no green foreign policy, but a German foreign 
policy,'' he told the leftist Paris daily Liberation in its Monday 
edition. ``But we will add new accents: the human rights question, 
durable development, the democratization of Europe, the relaunch of 
disarmament,'' he said. Among issues causing friction between Paris 
and Bonn are the financing of the EU and the new German government's 
decision to wean the country off nuclear power _ which will deal a 
blow to France's nuclear power industry. Fischer's insistence on human 
rights could chafe with France's dealings with former African colonies 
ruled by strongmen. Meanwhile cooperation is growing between British 
and German defense industries and stock markets, bypassing a France 
that is slow to privatize and liberalize. Fischer has a London stopover 
Wednesday night, then travels to Warsaw, a gesture meant to underline 
Germany's continuing commitment to forging a special bond with Poland 
since World War II. He flies home Thursday night.
