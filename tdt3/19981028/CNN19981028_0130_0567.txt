seats for a potentially dangerous defect. The national highway traffic 
safety administration says it has received 94 complaints of broken 
buckles on the seats. They include -- breverra booster seats made 
by century, models 4875 and 4885, manufactured in 1996 and '97. Officials 
are trying to determine whether a recall is necessary. They say they're 
also concerned about a handful of complaints that the buckles could
