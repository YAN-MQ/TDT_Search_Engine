The armed Basque separatist group ETA will shortly announce a definitive 
truce to end its 30-year campaign for independence, a leading Basque 
newspaper said Wednesday. The organization, blamed for nearly 800 
killings, is planning a statement in response to Prime Minister Jose 
Maria Aznar's demand for more proof of peaceful intentions, the Bilbao 
daily El Correo Espanyol reported without citing sources. ETA, which 
stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque language, began 
an open-ended, unconditional cease-fire Sept. 18, five weeks before 
last weekend's regional elections. In an interview with the British 
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) before the elections, two hooded members 
of ETA claimed the cease-fire was ``solid and serious.'' The truce 
is believed to be directly responsible for the boost in votes for 
the pro-independence Euskal Herritarrok coalition, which obtained 
14 seats in the 75-seat regional legislature, its highest showing 
in six regional elections. The cease-fire on Sept. 18 resulted from 
months of talks between the moderate pro-independence Basque Nationalist 
Party, which topped the polls, and Herri Batasuna, the ETA political 
link and founder of Euskal Herritarrok. Sunday's elections resulted 
in no clear winner and demonstrated how sharply divided the northern 
region is over independence. Three separatist parties gained a total 
of 41 seats while four groups opposed to breaking up Spain notched 
up 34. Although Aznar has said he is not yet convinced by ETA, government 
insiders indicated this week he will not insist on an immediate hand-over 
of arms. They added that talks over ETA demands that its jailed accomplices 
be transferred to Basque prisons were also possible. The chief ETA 
demand has been the right to self-determination for the Basque country, 
including the three Basque provinces of northern Spain and parts of 
neighboring Navarra and southwestern France. Many Basques, including 
independence advocates, see armed violence as unnecessary, considering 
the high level of autonomy the region has enjoyed for two decades. 
ETA has faced a tough government anti-terrorist policy, as well as 
a groundswell of public condemnation over the killing of unarmed municipal 
officials belonging to Aznar's governing Popular Party.
