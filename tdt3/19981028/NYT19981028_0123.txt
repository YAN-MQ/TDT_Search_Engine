Even as Microsoft battles the U.S. government, it can celebrate an 
incremental victory in the international arena. Nine months ago, Microsoft, 
Compaq Computer and Intel joined with the large local phone companies 
in an effort to enable consumers to receive Internet data over regular 
telephone lines at speeds much faster than now possible. Last week, 
the consortium achieved its initial goal: winning preliminary approval 
of its technical standard from the International Telecommunications 
Union, a U.N. group. The technology is known as digital subscriber 
line, or DSL. The version of DSL that won approval promises to deliver 
1.5 million bits of data to homes every second. Considering that it 
took the computing and communications industries about two years to 
settle on a universal standard for modems that deliver 56,000 bits 
a second, the industry consensus on DSL was quite a quick step. But 
the phone companies must continue to step lively if they are to beat 
back the threat to their future posed by cable modems. There may be 
half a million people using cable modems for access to the Internet 
over cable television systems, while only a fraction of that number 
use DSL technology. The new standard will allow consumers to install 
the advanced modems without help from a technician. Many cable modems 
require expert help for installation. The consortium hopes to have 
the modems in stores by the middle of next year, priced about $150.
