Since I last wrote about feng shui (literally ``Bride of Chucky'') 
earlier this year, I have been besieged (one letter) by requests for 
a follow-up. At that time, as you probably don't recall, I appointed 
myself official feng shui consultant for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, 
a building that couldn't have worse feng shui if a poltergeist suddenly 
took up residence in its computer system. (Many employees claim that 
one already has.) Feng shui, of course, is the traditional Chinese 
scam _ excuse me, art _ of fiddling with one's living (or work) space 
so that all is balanced, leading to happiness, health and wealth for 
feng shui consultants like myself and, possibly, you, too. I argued, 
unsuccessfully, that the Herald-Tribune's feng shui would be dramatically 
improved if management were relocated in our cramped, dim, airless 
cubicles and the employees took over the swank executive offices overlooking 
the McDonald's parking lot. It has taken me some time (three weeks 
probation) to recover from that setback, but I'm now ready to impose 
my will (for a fat fee, of course) on another feng shui-infested area, 
namely lawns and gardens. Assisting me in this undertaking is a new 
book by feng shui guru Lillian Too titled ``The Complete Illustrated 
Guide to Feng Shui for Gardens'' (Element, $24.95.). Lawns and gardens 
are infested with feng shui, both of the good and bad variety, Too 
said. The problem, of course, is knowing which one you're dealing 
with, which is where the book comes in handy. According to the author, 
``Identifying and dealing with poison arrows that are present in the 
environment are an essential part of feng shui practice.'' While you 
may think that your lawn and garden is poison-arrow free, there are 
a lot more out there than you might think. A poison arrow, Too says, 
is anything that is sharp, pointed, straight or triangular, or that 
appears hostile or threatening. Using that definition, that might 
include a crack in your driveway, sand spurs, a ``trespassers will 
be shot'' sign, your neighbor's pit bull, or, simply, your neighbor. 
Poison arrows are bad because they're made of Shar Chi or ``killing 
breath,'' which is to say pure negative energy. The reason your lawn 
and garden is full of weeds and fire ant hills is not because you're 
a lazy, good-for-nothing slob who would rather lie on the sofa, drinking 
beer and watching senior golf on TV than risk heat stroke in the great 
outdoors; it's because neighbors _ possibly people you've never even 
met _ are peppering you with Shar Chi-tipped arrows faster than you 
can say ``Cupid this!'' What you need to do, Too says, is blast the 
Shar Chi negative energy back from whence it came with the help of 
your own feng shui ``cannon'' (available through Sears, $49.99). If 
you're afraid of guns or simply worry that aiming a feng shui cannon 
at your neighbor's pool deck will simply make matters worse, you might 
want to begin collecting Sheng Chi, or green dragonbreath. Unlike 
Shar Chi, which travels in straight, lethal lines, Sheng Chi meanders 
all over the place, and wherever it accumulates, good things happen. 
Good sources of Shar Chi are bright flowers, goldfish ponds (presumably 
one in which the goldfish are not floating belly-up), turtles, children 
and dogs. The thinking here, apparently, is that if you acquire all 
these sources of Shar Chi you will be much too exhausted and/or broke 
to notice whether someone is shooting poison arrows at you or not. 
Either that or it will lead to a Green Dragon's Breath war between 
yourself and your neighbors, the resolution of which, needless to 
say, will require the intervention of a high-priced feng shui consultant 
such as myself. (David Grimes writes for the Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune.)
