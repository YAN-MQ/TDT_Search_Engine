Striking a blow for Jewish settlers in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, 
three members of the Israeli parliament struggled Wednesday to erect 
a fence around a controversial construction site. The hard-line members 
of parliament were also trying to drive a stake in to the heart of 
the Wye River agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, signed 
last week at the White House. It wasn't easy. Middle-aged and paunchy, 
the politicians wrestled with a 10-foot-high (three meter) fence post 
and a simple, cylindrical hand-operated pounding device. They succeeded 
in getting the post far enough into the ground to stand on its own, 
but just barely. Stopping every few blows to answer questions from 
reporters, Michael Kleiner, head of the Land of Israel bloc in parliament 
and leader of the movement to toppled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 
government said the politicians were doing the work because police 
banned settlers from putting up the fence. ``It's a shame that we 
have to use our parliamentary immunity to perform an act that is perfectly 
legal,'' he complained. Irving Moskowitz, a Miami millionaire and 
backer of Jewish settlers, bought the four-acre plot of land in the 
Arab neighborhood of Ras Al Amud, just across from the Old City of 
Jerusalem, several years ago. His backers showed The Associated Press 
a building permit for 132 apartments on the site, but the Israeli 
government has held up work, citing public safety concerns. Palestinians 
object to the construction, calling it an illegal Jewish settlement. 
There were no Palestinian demonstrators in sight as the Israeli politicians 
tried to make their point with their hands instead of their mouths. 
Kleiner took off his tie, put on work gloves and started pounding 
the fence post. He ran into rock the first two tries, but managed 
to get the post to stand on his third attempt. ``I built a fence at 
a settlement in the desert when I was 17,'' he said, ``but I was lot 
younger then.'' Though they denied that the construction was a provocation 
aimed at scuttling implementation of the Wye accords, the politicians 
repeated their objections to the accord over and over, whenever a 
reporter asked a question. Benny Elon of the far-right opposition 
Moledet Party, uncoiling a roll of barbed wire, charged that Netanyahu 
has a secret understanding with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat 
to give the Palestinians control of a wide swath of territory linking 
Jerusalem's Old City with the West Bank. The construction site is 
in the way. Elon said: ``It's essential to stop the secret plan.''
