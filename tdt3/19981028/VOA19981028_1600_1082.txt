It's time now for sports. Joining us here in the studio with the latest 
is VOA sports editor Park Brewer. And Park, should we expect the NBA 
to perhaps find some videotape replays of past games? I know. Our 
is up. And, you know, we still don't know if Michael Jordan will return 
to the Chicago Bulls. But we know if he does, it won't be until at 
least December. That's because the National Basketball Association 
has canceled another two weeks of games, extending the total of the 
player lockout through the month of November. Deputy NBA Commissioner 
Russ Granick made the announcement in New York just a couple hours 
ago, following a meeting of the league's board of governors. The league 
had already canceled the first two weeks of the season, which was 
scheduled to start next week. Granick told a news conference it will 
not be possible to play any games in November. We don't expect to 
have another announcement on the schedule until we're prepared either 
to say that we've made a deal and we'll then figure out exactly when 
we can start and have that announced -- or, if we're unfortunate enough 
to get far enough along that we don't realize that we can't play a 
season. Players, owners, and league officials are meeting at this 
hour to continue talks aimed at ending the owner-imposed lockout, 
which began on July 1. Commissioner David Stearn said they hope to 
do whatever it takes to reach an agreement.
