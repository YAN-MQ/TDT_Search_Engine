A Polish army officer who spied for the CIA during communist rule 
and later fled to the United States wants to return home, despite 
the government's refusal to give his house back, his spokesman said 
Wednesday. Col. Ryszard Kuklinski was sentenced to death by Poland's 
former communist government in 1984 for passing 35,000 pages of Warsaw 
Pact secrets to the CIA and telling them about the communist government's 
plan to impose martial law in 1981 and launch a bloody crackdown on 
the pro-democracy Solidarity movement. Kuklinski fled the country 
weeks before martial law was imposed in December 1981, and the government 
seized his house along with other personal assets including a yacht. 
He has lived in the United States since, visiting his homeland for 
the first time in May, months after a court cleared him of the treason 
charges. During the emotional visit, Kuklinski said he wanted to return 
to live in Poland. However, acknowledging Poles' division on whether 
he acted as a hero or traitor, he put off making immediate plans. 
A close friend of Kuklinksi's who acts as his spokesman said the former 
Army colonel was disappointed by the government's decision earlier 
this week not to return his former Warsaw house, offering instead 
compensation in dollars. ``He would prefer to get back his house, 
stolen by the communists. But if the government decides to pay compensation, 
he will not take the issue to court,'' spokesman Jerzy Bukowski said.
