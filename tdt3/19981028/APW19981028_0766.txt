With nearly all Yugoslav forces out of Kosovo or back to their barracks, 
major powers are now rushing to send up to 2,000 unarmed personnel 
to the Serbian province to make sure Slobodan Milosevic complies with 
a peace agreement. On Wednesday, 13 Norwegian technicians arrived 
in Kosovo's capital Pristina to begin setting up the headquarters 
for the ``ground verification mission,'' which will serve as the ``eyes 
and ears'' for NATO and the U.N. Security Council. The Vienna-based 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is responsible 
for the operation, hopes to have a substantial part of the mission 
up and running in Kosovo in the next few weeks, said spokeswoman Melissa 
Fleming. Nevertheless, a number of details remain unresolved, including 
the training program for the verifiers and the exact composition of 
the mission. Fleming said that despite doubts that such a large force 
could be assembled fast enough, ``getting the 2,000 together doesn't 
seem to be a problem.'' The five European members of the Contact Group 
-- Russia, Germany, France, Italy and Britain -- will each provide 
about 200 people, she said. The United States, the other member of 
the Contact Group, has agreed to send fewer verifiers but is primarily 
responsible for aerial surveillance. A number of other countries, 
including former Soviet Bloc states such as Romania and the Czech 
Republic, have also agreed to send personnel. Norway has also promised 
to allocate dlrs 26 million, to cover costs of security, housing and 
communications for the first year. On a day-to-day basis, the verifiers 
will roam around Kosovo to make sure both the government forces and 
the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army are honoring a cease-fire. 
They will file reports to the Vienna headquarters on what they see. 
Because of the nature of the mission, OSCE hopes that many of the 
verifiers will have had military experience. They are expected to 
undergo a brief training program. But details such as the length of 
training and the venue -- either Vienna, Macedonia or Pristina -- 
have not been resolved, Fleming said. A major focus of the training 
will be security, said Fleming. Under the Oct. 12 agreement between 
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, the verifiers will not 
carry weapons. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said NATO plans 
to station a rapid reaction force in Macedonia to rescue verifiers 
if they are in danger from either side in the conflict.
