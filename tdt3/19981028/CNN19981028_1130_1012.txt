When consumers are asked about what kind of insurance they need, car, 
home and life policies top the list. Disability insurance rarely makes 
the cut, even though it can be critical. Peter viles reports. More 
than 60% of the U.S. workforce has no long-term disability insurance. 
But car accidents, back pain and other ailments keep one in four workers 
at home for some period of time during their career, often without 
pay. Short-term disability insurance, often provided free by companies, 
runs out in three to six months. After that, options are limited. 
Social security rescues only those disabled more than a year and unable 
to perform any kind of work. While workers compensation covers only 
injuries incurred on the job. That's where long-term disability insurance 
comes in. Many companies provide optional coverage for as little as 
a few dollars a Paycheck. If you can't get long-term disability coverage 
through your company, you can buy it directly from an insurer. Before 
buying, check the policy's language. There are two basic types of 
policies. More expensive policies cover you if you can no longer perform 
the exact job you once held. Cheaper policies may force you to at 
least look for another job. In other words -- You are disabled only 
if you are unable to do the principal responsibilities of any job 
that fits your experience and education. Finally, check for cost of 
living adjustments, and remember that leaving a job usually means 
loss of coverage. That's "your money." Peter viles, "CNN Financial 
News," New York.
