The U.S. State Department's top Africa official arrived here Wednesday 
on a three-day visit to discuss the country's stymied peace process 
and Angola's role in neighboring Congo's civil war. Susan Rice, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for Africa, was accompanied by President 
Bill Clinton's special assistant Gayle Smith and his special envoy 
to the Great Lakes region, Howard Wolpe. They were to meet with Foreign 
Minister Venancio de Moura during their stay. It was not clear whether 
they would meet with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos before they 
left Friday for a tour of other countries in the region. The U.S. 
officials were not expected to meet with representatives from the 
former rebel group UNITA, which waged a two-decade civil war with 
the government before the signing of a 1994 peace pact. However, they 
will hold talks with a group of dissidents who recently split with 
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, a U.S. diplomat in Luanda said. The Angolan 
government in September severed all contact with Savimbi, who lives 
in the country's central highlands, and has waged an international 
diplomatic campaign to isolate him. The United States, Portugal and 
Russia are monitoring the implementation of the ailing 1994 peace 
deal. UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola _ broke contact with the three observer 
countries in August, accusing them of bias in the southwest African 
nation's peace process. The former rebel group has failed to comply 
fully with the terms of the peace pact, triggering U.N. and U.S. sanctions 
against it. Angola, along with Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad, has sent 
troops to support Congo President Laurent Kabila against insurgents 
who are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
