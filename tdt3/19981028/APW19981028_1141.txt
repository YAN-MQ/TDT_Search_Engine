Australia's richest sportsman, Greg Norman, has struck a deal with 
Sydney 2000 Olympic organizers, who are struggling to meet budget 
targets, a newspaper reported Thursday. The golf star will supply 
50,000 of his signature Great White Shark hats for use by volunteers 
at the games and SOCOG will also use his huge profile to help raise 
the Australian dlrs 874 million (U.S. dlrs 542) needed from the marketing 
department. The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said Norman's Australian 
manager Frank Williams was unaware of the deal but reported Olympic 
sources as saying it had been signed for some time. SOCOG chiefs have 
admitted they are stretching to raise enough revenue to meet the Australian 
dlrs 2.6 million (U.S. dlrs 1.64 million) budget. International Olympic 
Committee spokesman Jacques Rogge called the budget ``ambitious yet 
feasible'' last week. The Australian Olympic Committee has been negotiating 
with Norman on activities to raise cash for athletes, including holding 
other events in conjunction with the annual Greg Norman International 
golf tournament, the paper reported. Norman's Great White Shark Enterprises 
would supply goods and services to SOCOG for a reduced price in exchange 
for some rights to use Olympic insignia.
