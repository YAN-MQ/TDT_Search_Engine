Japan will lend dlrs 40 million to the impoverished central Asian 
republic of Kyrgyzstan, a news agency reported Wednesday. The loan, 
agreed upon during Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev's visit to Japan 
this week, will be used to reconstruct a major north-south highway 
in the former Soviet republic, the Interfax news agency said. Japanese 
officials also expressed interest other development projects but no 
contracts were drawn up, said the chairman of Kyrgyzstan's government 
investment committee, Naken Isayev. Japan's Export-Import Bank has 
tentatively agreed to participate in a dlrs 10 million telecommunications 
project, and the Toshiba Corp. is interested in a plan to produce 
semiconductors there, Interfax cited Isayev as saying. Japan, one 
of the biggest investors in Central Asia, has given Kyrgyzstan millions 
of dollars in development aid since 1991, when the agricultural nation 
gained independence from the Soviet Union.
