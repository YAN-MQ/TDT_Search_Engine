This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Thursday. As one cold front pushes into the plains states 
with rain and thunderstorms, a second, right behind it, will spread 
another round of rain and mountain snow showers across the Rockies, 
with some windy conditions, as well. A front pushing into the northwest 
will spread some rain showers that way, while across the northeastern 
U.S., it'll be cool and windy with a chance of some showers. Highs 
on Thursday through that region, just in the 40s. We'll see 30s and 
40s from the northern Rockies to the northern plains, but still mild 
across the south, plenty of 70s and 80s. Looking ahead to Friday, 
showers and storms push eastward through the southwest, with snow 
in the rocky mountains. We'll see windy weather and showers across 
the northeast, as well. For Saturday, showers and storms through the 
plains, more rain showers in the northwest, and then Sunday, showers 
northeast, northwest, showers and storms through the plains, and cool 
across the northern Great Lakes. Don't forget, you can find four-day 
forecasts for 7,200 cities on CNN interactive at CNN.com.
