President Clinton calls it a "severe and ongoing health care crisis" 
in black and Hispanic communities. Today the White House announced 
a new $156 million program to fight the disease among minorities. 
Government statistics show it is a leading killer among African-Americans 
and Hispanics. This latest initiative doesn't offer new drugs or treatments. 
Instead it aims to get people into programs and clinics where they 
can get treatment and help in preventing the spread of the virus.
