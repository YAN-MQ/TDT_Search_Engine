Lawyers trying to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet to Spain criticized 
a British court's decision to quash the arrest of the former Chilean 
dictator, but said they remained hopeful that an appeals court would 
overturn Wednesday's ruling. ``I was very optimistic until today,'' 
said lawyer Virginia Diaz who has worked closely on the case. The 
High Court in London quashed arrest warrants issued by Spanish Judge 
Baltasar Garzon that had kept Pinochet detained in a London clinic 
since Oct. 16. The warrants were a first step towards extraditing 
the ailing general to Spain to stand trial for genocide, terrorism 
and torture. The court ruled that Pinochet could not be prosecuted 
outside of Chile for crimes during his 17-year dictatorship that began 
in 1973 because he was head of state at the time. ``We were surprised 
by the ruling,'' said Diaz who has worked closely with Garzon and 
argues that international law clearly rules out immunity in cases 
of crimes against humanity. ``We are not talking about a little bit 
of corruption, but the killing, torture and disappearance of thousands 
of people,'' she said. Nonetheless Diaz said she was holds out some 
hope for an appeal on the immunity question that is expected to be 
filed in London Monday. Pinochet remains under guard pending the appeal, 
with a hearing set for Friday for his application for release on bail. 
Meanwhile, the attempt to bring the former dictator to trial in Spain 
is under indirect legal attack via a related discussion in Spain's 
National Court. A panel of jurists from the National Court, to which 
Garzon is attached, was due to begin discussing Thursday whether crimes 
such as genocide that took place outside of Spain are within the jurisdiction 
of Spanish judges. For two years Garzon and another National Court 
judge have been gathering evidence into the murder, torture and disappearance 
of thousands during the military juntas that ruled Chile and Argentina 
in the 1970s and 1980s. Diaz said she feared the London ruling might 
influence the Spanish panel in its decision that is expected Friday. 
A ruling against Spanish jurisdiction for Chilean crimes would make 
the appeal against Wednesday's decision in favor of Pinochet's immunity 
difficult to sustain. Also Wednesday some two thousand human rights 
activists gathered in Columbus Square in central Madrid to hold a 
24-hour vigil timed to coincide with the lead up to the National Court's 
deliberations. The vigil could not avoid contained references to the 
Wednesday's ruling in London. ``What has happened in Britain is shameful,'' 
said the leader of the United Left party Julio Anguita at the vigil 
that was punctuated by chants of ``Pinochet Assassin.'' The minority 
United Left and the main opposition Socialist Party have vocally supported 
Garzon's efforts to extradite Pinochet. The conservative government 
of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has insisted that the Pinochet 
controversy is purely a judicial matter on which it should not comment. 
``I am very hopeful,'' Chilean Dora Carreno said to the crowd in Columbus 
Square. ``We have been fighting for 25 years and we are not going 
to stop here'' Carreno, the sister of a woman disappeared during Pinochet's 
regime in Argentina, added ``For the relatives of the victims every 
step however small is important.''
