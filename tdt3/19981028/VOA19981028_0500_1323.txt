And owners of the 30 National Football franchises have started their 
annual two-day meeting. And several key issues are on their agenda 
in Kansas City this year. Topping the docket Tuesday was a decision 
on where to place the expansion Cleveland Browns when they re-enter 
the league in 1999. Also on the agenda officials from Los Angeles 
and Houston were to make presentations in hopes of bringing franchisees 
back to their cities the next time the league expands.
