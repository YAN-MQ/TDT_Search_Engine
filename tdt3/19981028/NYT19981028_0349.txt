The dark-haired man in the slate-gray turtleneck sounded as if he 
were trying to explain the dynamics of the Middle East peace process, 
which was nearing a crescendo as he spoke on Friday. ``This is not 
a society that is outlined or completely established,'' said Amos 
Gitai.``It's volcanic, abrupt, with a reality that's constantly destabilized. 
It's a place where the great events of history crawl into the bedroom 
and don't leave you a moment of silence, where you are constantly 
called to give an opinion, even if you just want to enjoy a moment 
of quiet. Everything you do is a testament to memory.'' Rather than 
talking about the complications of making peace, Gitai, perhaps Israel's 
best-known film director, was talking about the challenge of creating 
cinema, a process that for Israeli filmmakers has often been as taxing, 
contentious and flawed as the currents of diplomacy. Gitai was in 
New York as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's series ``Creating 
a Nation: The Cinema of Israel,'' which opened on Saturday and runs 
through Nov. 11. The festival traces the evolution from the first 
films of the Zionist movement, like the two rare silents that are 
to be shown on Sunday, or Helmar Lurski's ``Avoda,'' a 1930s chronicle 
of early Jewish settlers in Palestine. But while paying tribute to 
Israeli films during the 50th anniversary of the nation's birth, the 
series also reflects the limitations of a body of work that is surprisingly 
obscure, with no director widely known outside Israel's borders (and 
not too many known within them). Since its beginning in 1963, the 
New York Film Festival has never included an Israeli work. Israelis 
have produced many thoughtful and challenging films, and there is 
enough interest in the United States to support an annual Israeli 
Film Festival, which has been showing new Israeli work in New York 
and Los Angeles for 15 years. But like the nation itself, Israeli 
films began as a statement of faith, as self-consciously propagandistic 
exemplars of the Zionist dream. ``The beginning of Israeli cinema 
is intertwined with the beginnings of Zionism,'' said Ella Shohat, 
a professor of film at the City University of New York and the author 
of ``Israeli Cinema: East/West and the Politics of Representation'' 
(University of Texas Press, 1989). ``Zionists quite consciously used 
the cinema to promote their cause. Cinema from its earliest days was 
about trying to lure people to come to Palestine.'' The notion of 
film as a single idealized vision of Israel began to crack in the 
1960s as a new generation of Israelis began to question the orthodoxy 
of the original Jewish settlers and was more or less discredited by 
the 1970s. But building a cinematic tradition as rich as the contentious 
babble of voices that is Israel has been a slow process, as becomes 
evident in comparing the long list of familiar Israeli writers with 
the obscurity of Israeli filmmakers. ``Essentially, cinema needs two 
things at the same time, an industrial base and financial base on 
the one hand, and individual freedom of expression on the other,'' 
Gitai said. ``Since both are rather missing in the early stages, it's 
taken a long time to develop Israeli film. ``We live in a very opinionated, 
pluralistic society. But in film, there's still an attitude that wants 
to hide the differences and produce, pathetically, a unified vision 
instead of exposing our internal debate.'' Gitai, who began his career 
as an architect and started making documentaries for Israeli television 
in 1977, reflects how far Israeli films have come. His works cover 
a broad range from documentaries to fiction, many of them richly textured 
evocations of the interconnections between Palestinians and Israelis. 
The series' opening night featured his newest film, ``Yom Yom'' (``Day 
After Day''), a comedy about the divided life of the son of a Jewish 
mother and Palestinian father living in Haifa. It is part of a trilogy 
based in Israel's three main cities, Haifa, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. 
His other films include a trilogy of documentaries on Jews and Palestinians; 
``Esther,'' a bold retelling of the biblical story; ``Berlin Jerusalem,'' 
a drama about two women, an Expressionist poet from Berlin and a Russian 
revolutionary, whose paths bring them to Jerusalem; ``Give Peace a 
Chance,'' a documentary about the peace effort; and ``Kippur,'' in 
which Gitai brings together the people who were with him when his 
helicopter was shot down during the Yom Kippur war of 1973. But he 
also had two films censored by the television authorities and has 
found life as a skeptical filmmaker in Israel so difficult that he 
lived in Paris from 1982 to 1993. Even now, he raises much of the 
money for his work abroad and says a lack of financial support, both 
the private and public, has made it difficult for other filmmakers 
to create a body of work. ``Basically, filmmakers invest a lot of 
energy producing one feature film, and the consequences are they have 
to sell their house or take major economic risks,'' he said. ``There 
is not the institutional support you find in France, in Australia, 
in many other countries.'' Israeli filmmakers face other obstacles 
as well. With perhaps 6 million people in the world who speak Hebrew, 
the language barrier is enormous. And Jewish culture, from the biblical 
injunction against worshiping graven images, has always been more 
geared toward the word than the picture, so there is less of a visual 
memory bank for filmmakers to work from. Perhaps most important, Israeli 
films face the problems confronting all independent artists in an 
international film market that has almost no place for anything but 
Hollywood blockbusters. It takes some institutional heft to get films 
seen or directors known, the kind of attention that has put Australian 
films, and even those from places as unlikely as Iran, on the map. 
``There are some terrific films, but there's very little support for 
them,'' said Richard Pena, director of the Film Society of Lincoln 
Center. ``If we get a film from Iran, there will always be someone 
calling, `When's the last deadline?' They're very active in promoting 
their films. My impression is that Israel has done less of that.''
