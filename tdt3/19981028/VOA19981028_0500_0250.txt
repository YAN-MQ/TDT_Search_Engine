A special U.N. envoy has met with a senior member of Burma's ruling 
military government. Assistant U.N. Secretary General Olivero DaySoto 
held talks in Rangoon with Lieutenant-General Ken Yunt, the head of 
Burma's military intelligence. On Tuesday, Mr. DaySoto met with opposition 
leader AngSung Soogee. Details of the meetings have not been released. 
During his last visit in January, the U.N. official failed to organize
