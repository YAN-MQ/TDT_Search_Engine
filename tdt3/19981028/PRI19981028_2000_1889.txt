Augusto Pinochet on trial. A judge in Spain wants him extradited in 
connection with killings, torture, and disappearances that took place

head of state, he is entitled to immunity from arrest and prosecution. 
General Pinochet remains in detention, pending appeals. Chilean Deputy 
Foreign Minister, Mariano Fernandez welcomed the high court decision. 
We are happy that the British High Court has recognized the state
