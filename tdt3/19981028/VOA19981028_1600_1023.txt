You're tuned to the Voice of America. Coming to you from Washington, 
I'm Susan Yackie along with Tom Crosby, bringing you this hour of 
VOA News Now. It's coming up on 21 hours 18 Universal Time. And here's 
the top news story we're following this hour: A London court rules 
the arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Piniche was illegal, 
because it violated his diplomatic immunity as a former head of state. 
We'll have details of that story later.
