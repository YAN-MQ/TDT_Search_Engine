They expect a lot of people to watch tomorrow's launch. One of the 
spectators will be John Glenn's wife, his wife of 55 years. The first 
time Glenn went into orbit, she chose to stay home. This time she'll 
be a few yards from our location. "Today" co-host Matt Lauer spoke 
with her. It's a lifelong love afair that is has spanned five decades. 
They met as children playing in the same playpen and before long Glenn 
was hooked. When he appeared on the television quiz show "name that 
tune" in 1957, he told the world about his childhood sweetheart. When 
I was 10, I liked a little girl in our class pretty much. The only 
trouble was everyone else, the other fellows liked her, too. Did you 
get her to notice you? I finally got her to marry me, in fact. When 
John Glenn married annie in 1943, he promised a lifetime filled with 
excitement, whether it was that first trip into orbit or the 24 years 
Glenn spent as a United States senator, annie has been by his side 
supporting him. But John was always there for annie as well. She spent 
years tirelessly working to overcome her severe stuttering. I was 
a very 95 -- and 85% stutterer. It didn't make any difference to him. 
He's helped me all of my life. And when John Glenn announced last 
year he would not seek a fifth term in the United States Senate, that 
was fine with annie. I told everybody I have given him to our country 
for 55 years and I was ready to take him back as mine, and then Lo 
and behold he was announced to go on this STS 95 flight and he was 
like a little kid. How do you think you'll be feeling when the rest 
of the world and the country, certainly, when all of us are hearing 
T-10, T-9? That's another thing. I will probably have tears and I 
will probably cry, but that's all right. I'll be with our kids and 
we will hug a lot, and I will pray a lot, and I will be excited, too. 
Annie Glenn, what a great time. That report from Matt Lauer.
