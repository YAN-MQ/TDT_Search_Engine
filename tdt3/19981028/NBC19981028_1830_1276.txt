And now "living longer, living better" -- heart disease is the number 
one killer of Americans. But a new therapy could be a lifesaver for 
millions, because it's very effective. Here's NBC chief science correspondent 
Robert Bazell. For the 14 million Americans with heart disease, a 
dramatic new treatment. This is probably the most exciting thing that's 
happening in cardiology right now. Instead of replacing or opening 
clogged arteries to the heart, doctors use a new genetically engineered 
drug, a version of a natural body chemical, that coaxes the heart 
to grow entirely new blood vessels. The potential here is absolutely 
amazing. Heart disease struck Steve cadoret when he was only 35 and 
progressed rapidly. After ten angioplasties and a bypass surgery, 
his heart was so scarred, doctors said they could do nothing more 
for him. He grew weaker by the day, barely able to walk. People look 
at you, and they can't see a thing wrong with you, excepting you can't 
move. Then he heard about the experimental treatment. Doctors administer 
the drug, called fibroblast growth factor, through the same tube used 
to inject dye when they take X-Ray pictures of clogged arteries. Steve 
cadoret started feeling better a month after the treatment. Now, three 
months later, he plays a great game of basketball with his kids. Even 
chops wood in his backyard. I'm back enjoying my wife and my kids, 
and doing everything that I want with them. The technique stems from 
one of the hottest areas of medical research, called angiogenesis, 
new blood vessel formation. Dr. judah Folkman was looking for ways 
to cut off the blood supply to cancer cells when he discovered the 
chemicals now used to fight heart disease. No one knows the long-term 
effects of the procedure, because in the preliminary trials, doctors 
have treated only a few dozen patients, all in the past two years. 
But everyone agrees the early results are sensational. And doctors 
are planning much larger trials to find out if the new blood vessel-forming 
drugs will help millions "live longer, live better." Robert Bazell,
