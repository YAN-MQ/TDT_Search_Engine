Now for "diskette world" travel news -- notebook computers are traveling 
lighter with built-in superdisk drives. Only the superdisk drive works 
with both regular floppies and 120-megabyte superdisk diskettes. Floppies 
everywhere are thrilled because a built-in superdisk is two drives 
in one, and other drives are on the way out. We can save a little. 
Superdisk can save a lot. Together, we can save the world. Get it 
in Hewlett Packard notebooks.
