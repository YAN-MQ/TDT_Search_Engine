Pete Sampras, battling to preserve his No. 1 ranking, and Marcelo 
Rios, seeking to take it away, both came back from injuries to post 
straight-set victories at the Eurocard Open on Wednesday. Sampras 
beat Nicolas Kiefer 6-3, 6-4 to reach the third round of the star-studded 
dlrs 2.45 million event and Rios advanced by beating another German, 
Tommy Haas, 6-3, 7-5. Third-ranked Patrick Rafter, the two-time U.S. 
Open champion who is also in contention for the top spot, beat Magnus 
Gustafsson 6-1, 6-4. Rios, who leads the tour with seven titles this 
year and is ranked No. 2, could reclaim the top spot he had already 
held for a total of six weeks this year if he reaches the final and 
Sampras loses in the next round, when he plays Bohdan Ulihrach. Sampras 
is seeking to finish the season as No. 1 for a record sixth year in 
a row. ``It's a huge challenge and I am going to push hard,'' Sampras 
said. I feel I am in a good position to do it. It'd be one of the 
ultimate achievements in tennis.'' ``If I play well and win, the ranking 
will take care of itself,'' he said. With a heavy storm moving over 
Stuttgart, the roof of the arena began to leak while Sampras and Rafter 
were playing and one spot on the court had to be mopped up repeatedly. 
Both Sampras and Rios had to retire from last week's tournament in 
Lyon, Sampras with a back strain and Rios with hamstring and back 
problems. Sampras withdrew before his quarterfinal against Haas, while 
Rios retired in the semifinal, also against Haas. ``I feel much better, 
I rested for a couple of days. I steel feel my back a little bit but 
it is much better,'' Rios said. Andre Agassi, who surged into the 
Top 5 ranks for the first time since July 15, 1996 after winning last 
week's event in Ostrava, Czech Republic and who still has a mathematical 
chance of ending he year as No. 1, also picked up ground. He beat 
Andrei Pavel 6-1, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3. Pavel lost in the qualifying but 
replaced the injured Thomas Enqvist in the main draw. Although he 
is seeded sixth in the tournament, Agassi is No. 5 on the latest computer 
rankings. At this time last year, the former No. 1 had dropped to 
No. 140 and was playing challenger events. ``I knew it would take 
me the whole year to get myself back to being in good position again. 
But I wasn't expecting to have succeeded this quickly,'' said Agassi, 
who captured his fifth title of the year Sunday in Ostrava, Czech 
Republic. ``The end of this year is crucial to the ranking and it 
is also crucial to your confidence. But I am not as interested in 
No. 1 right now as much as proving that I can be there. ``I want to 
win big tournaments. That is the most important thing to me,'' said 
Agassi, who did relatively poorly in the Grand Slams this year. Agassi 
next plays Richard Krajicek, who beat Magnus Norman 6-4, 6-1. Rios 
faces Jan Siemerink. Carlos Moya, the No. 4 in the world who also 
has a chance of finishing the year as No. 1, suffered a setback by 
losing to Boris Becker. Becker may be in semi-retirement but he can 
still be a threat and he proved it by beating the French Open champion 
6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-4. Rafter next faces No. 13 Greg Rusedski, who squeezed 
past Jason Stoltenberg 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (7-4) after wasting 
five match points in the second set.
