Tourist arrivals in Singapore in this year's first nine months dropped 
16.6 percent from a year earlier as Asia's economic crisis kept potential 
tourists at home, according to government figures released Wednesday. 
The Singapore Tourism Board said 4.7 million people visited Singapore 
in the January-September period. Arrivals from key countries like 
Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong all continued to 
decline, because of either economic or political uncertainties there. 
Singapore relies heavily on tourism, and in past years the number 
of visitors has been equal to several times the city-state's population 
of 3.1 million. But only 3 million tourists arrived in the first half 
of 1998, and the declining trend has yet to reverse itself.
