Rep. Charles Schumer denounced Sen. Alfonse D'Amato Wednesday for 
running a ``cynical campaign on what we now see clearly is a phony 
issue'' after D'Amato acknowledged that he had skipped hundreds of 
votes as a local official when he first ran for the Senate in 1980. 
``The issue of missed votes is now over,'' Schumer declared in Manhattan. 
But D'Amato was quick to disagree. After appearing to hold back Wednesday 
morning at a rally along the Hudson River in Yonkers, D'Amato later 
returned with a vengeance to the issue of Schumer's skipping votes 
in order to run for the Senate, as he campaigned for a second day 
across upstate New York. While rattling off statistics relating to 
Schumer's absentee record this year to illustrate what has been the 
central thrust of his campaign, the senator defended himself against 
the countercharges over his own missed votes, which came 18 years 
ago when he was a member of the Nassau County Board of Supervisors. 
D'Amato said it was ``ludicrous'' to compare his attendance record 
when he first ran for the Senate _ he attended only one out of six 
meetings of the supervisors' board that fall _ with congressional 
votes that Schumer missed this year. And in a sharp effort to move 
attention away from a disclosure that even the senator's own supporters 
described as threatening to D'Amato's re-election prospects, he raised 
18-year-old allegations that Schumer had used state employees to work 
on his first campaign for Congress. The exchanges between D'Amato 
and his Democratic challenger came as the two candidates entered a 
tense final week of a campaign that has clearly been jolted by the 
disclosure of records that suggested that D'Amato had, as presiding 
supervisor of the town of Hempstead in 1980, done the same thing for 
which he has criticized Schumer. Schumer, who has spent much of the 
last month responding to questions about votes he missed this year, 
seemed elated by the turn of events. ``The truth is coming back to 
haunt him,'' Schumer asserted at a Manhattan news conference, where 
he appeared with James Brady, the former White House press secretary 
who was gravely wounded in the assassination attempt on President 
Reagan and has since become the nation's leading advocate for gun 
control. ``The votes he missed demonstrates that Al D'Amato's whole 
campaign was a fraud,'' Schumer said, standing in front of a blue 
backdrop in his midtown campaign headquarters. ``Again, I repeat, 
it's not that he missed the votes. It's rather that he would use the 
issue of missed votes, knowing he missed as many as he did, to be 
the whole centerpiece of his campaign. It's definite proof that New 
Yorkers can't trust him, and after 18 years, it's time for the hypocrisy 
to end.'' Even Brady turned one of D'Amato's campaign lines against 
him as he endorsed Schumer _ for the second time this year _ for his 
efforts on behalf of the gun control legislation that Congress passed 
in Brady's honor. ``Yesterday, I read where Al D'Amato missed more 
than 900 votes,'' Brady said, reading from a sheet of paper. ``I wished 
he would have missed the votes on the Brady bill and the assault weapons 
ban.'' D'Amato missed more than 1,000 votes taken on both boards on 
which he served _ the Hempstead Town Board and the Nassau County Board 
of Supervisors _ during the 1980 election campaign, according to a 
count by Newsday. D'Amato's campaign staff, and many of his supporters, 
showed signs of concern about the disclosure throughout the day _ 
both because the senator may have now lost the issue on which he had 
hooked his campaign and because the incident feeds into Schumer's 
attempt to portray him as untrustworthy. Several elected Republican 
officials who attended D'Amato's rallies Wednesday but who asked not 
to be identified said they were growing increasingly concerned about 
D'Amato's prospects for re-election. One supporter expressed anger 
at D'Amato's campaign for making such a fundamental political error: 
not adequately investigating its candidate's background before raising 
the allegations about an opponent. D'Amato, who is normally eager 
to talk to reporters, went to great lengths Wednesday to avoid discussing 
the issue as he campaigned across the state with Gov. George Pataki. 
In Yonkers, appearing before a huge contingent of television cameras, 
the senator took just one question, and then, again uncharacteristically, 
read from a statement that he was holding down on the lectern against 
the wind blowing off the Hudson River behind him.
