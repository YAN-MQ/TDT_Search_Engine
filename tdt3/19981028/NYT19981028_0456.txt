Florida officials arrested 18 people on Wednesday and were seeking 
three others in a case of widespread ballot fraud that tainted last 
November's citywide election here. Eleven woman and 10 men, many of 
them elderly, were accused of acting as false witnesses to the signing 
of absentee ballots cast in the mayoral elections. Two were also accused 
of voter fraud. Both crimes are third-degree felonies that carry maximum 
prison sentences of five years. The arrests on Wednesday bring to 
36 the number of people charged in a yearlong inquiry into voter fraud 
that has propelled Miami into the national spotlight as a city rife 
with corruption and political influence-peddling. Coming just six 
days before Election Day, the arrests were characterized by officials 
as a warning that election fraud would not be tolerated. ``It does 
send a strong message,'' said Doyle Jourdan, regional director for 
the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. ``We did intend to try 
and get this phase accomplished prior to the elections.'' The 18 people 
arrested on Wednesday had turned themselves in and were later released 
on their own recognizance, after being charged with the other three. 
Law-enforcement officials were searching for the remaining three. 
Many of those arrested worked in the campaign of the former Miami 
mayor, Xavier Suarez, who was ousted this year. Suarez defeated Joe 
Carollo in a Nov. 11 runoff election that was forced by hundreds of 
absentee ballots cast for Suarez in the first round. In March, Carollo, 
a former mayor, returned to his post after state courts held that 
many absentee ballots were fraudulent. Since then, local election 
officials have set up rules to make forgeries and fraud more difficult. 
Two of the people arrested on Wednesday, Jorge Diaz, 60, and Maria 
Gonzalez, 80, were involved in the Carollo campaign. ``If indeed one 
or two people were involved in false witnessing, that's wrong,'' Carollo 
said in a telephone interview. ``I don't approve of that. It saddens 
me that it happened.''
