The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 29: England's 
High Court on Wednesday quashed the arrest order of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, 
ruling that as a former head of state he is immune from prosecution 
or arrest in Britain. The decision is a mistake. If the evidence holds 
up, Pinochet should be turned over to the Spanish judge who issued 
a warrant for his arrest on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. 
His military coup in Chile in 1973 led to the killings of at least 
2,000 people. Though Pinochet may soon be free to return home, the 
court decision does not have standing outside Britain. It does not 
save him, or other accused international criminals, from arrest or 
prosecution in other nations. There is still a chance that Britain 
will hold Pinochet for possible extradition to Spain, although a slim 
one. He remains in custody because prosecutors can appeal to the Law 
Lords, a panel of the House of Lords. The British court also said 
that Pinochet could be tried by an international tribunal. But British 
law, it concluded, grants immunity in Britain to heads of state who 
committed crimes ``in the course of exercising public functions.'' 
It is repugnant to consider torture, murder and forced disappearance 
as public functions. But the real problem with the decision was that 
international law _ the basis of Spain's extradition request _ was 
apparently not even considered by the court. The Nuremberg principles, 
the foundation of modern international law, specifically say that 
heads of state can be prosecuted for international crimes. Those are 
certain crimes considered so heinous that any nation can prosecute 
them, including widespread murder and torture. Indeed, leaders bear 
the most responsibility for such systematic crimes. Britain has signed 
and ratified international conventions against torture and genocide. 
These allow prosecution of genocide and widespread torture _ including 
by leaders _ no matter where in the world they are committed. What 
may have been at work in this case is diplomatic politesse, with a 
British panel of judges unwilling to violate a political amnesty deal 
that supposedly reflects the will of Chileans. If so, this was misguided. 
A poll taken just before the arrest shows that the majority of Chileans 
still want prosecutions for the crimes committed by Pinochet's forces. 
The democratic government honors the amnesty he granted himself in 
part because it is afraid of the response from his followers. Pinochet's 
continued power in Chile can protect him politically. But in the case 
of especially horrendous crimes, an amnesty imposed by a dictator 
should not get the world's legal approval.
