Archeologists working in the Egyptian port of Alexandria have raised 
a granite sphinx representing Cleopatra's father King Ptolemei XII. 
Archeologists made the find after spending three years searching the 
area believed to contain Cleopatra's royal palace. The BBC's Barbara 
Platte has more. Historians believe Cleopatra's royal quarters were 
submerged by earthquakes and tidal waves more than 1600 years ago. 
A team of marine archeologists, led by Frenchman, Frank Gaugio has 
been excavating the ancient city in the murky waters of Alexandria's 
harbor, creating a map of the ruins with sophisticated electronic 
equipment. Over the past year, the team members have concentrated 
on the submerged island of Antiahotus. Cleopatra is said to have had 
a palace there, and Mr. Gaugio believes he may have found it's foundations.
