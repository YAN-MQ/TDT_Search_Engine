We'll have another business report in about an hour. Sports news coming 
up in 25 minutes. We're listening to VOA -- well, actually, you're 
listening to "VOA News Now." You know, it's coming up on the hour. 
I want to go out and get something to drink. Anyway, I'm Paul Westfeeling. 
She's Charlene Porter. This is "VOA News now."
