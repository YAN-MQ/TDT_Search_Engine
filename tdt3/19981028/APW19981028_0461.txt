An Air China jet with 104 people aboard was hijacked to Taiwan Wednesday 
by its disgruntled captain, who allegedly told authorities he did 
it because he was angered over pay and working conditions. ``I feel 
relaxed,'' Yuan Bin said in a brief exchange with reporters, after 
prosecutors questioned him at the airport before taking him to court. 
``I shall have no regret whatever happens to me.'' Flight CA905 took 
off from Beijing FOR the southern Chinese city of Kunming, but was 
diverted in the air and arrived safely under military jet escort at 
Taiwan's main international airport at 11:17 a.m. (0317 GMT). Yuan, 
30, was accompanied on the flight by his wife, identified as Xu Mei, 
27. She also was detained by Taiwanese authorities, who were not immediately 
sure whether to consider her a suspect. ``He was determined to come 
to Taiwan, live or die,'' Hwang Yun-hwa, vice aviation police commander, 
told a news conference. ``He said the company had treated him badly.'' 
Yuan's co-pilot, Wen Fei, did not try to physically stop the captain, 
for fear a fight in the cockpit could endanger the passengers, said 
Chang Kuo-cheng, director of the Civil Aeronautics Administration. 
Nobody was hurt and the Boeing 737's two other pilots were allowed 
to take off from Taiwan six hours later, flying 94 remaining passengers 
and six crew members back to China. China's Xinhua News Agency said 
20 foreigners were aboard, but it did not give their nationalities. 
The plane finally landed in Xiamen, in China's southeastern Fujian 
province, according to Hong Kong officials who had been monitoring 
its progress. Taiwan Television showed the captain in his uniform 
white shirt, carrying a suitcase as he was led out of the plane by 
policemen in helmets and bulletproof vests. His wife was shown in 
a black coat. Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen said Yuan admitted he 
diverted the jet to Taiwan because he was displeased with Air China's 
policies and his pay. It was not immediately clear what Yuan hoped 
to accomplish. ``There was no political motive,'' Huang said. Chang 
said Yuan would face trial in Taiwan, although no information on the 
precise charges was immediately released. The flight by Air China, 
the main airline run by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, 
was scheduled originally to stop in Kunming, then continue to Yangon, 
Myanmar, Chang said. There was a spate of hijackings from China to 
Taiwan in 1993 and 1994 by Chinese who said they were seeking freedom 
and better job prospects. But Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew condemned 
Wednesday's incident. ``We've never agreed to such deeds,'' he told 
reporters _ although Taiwan in recent memory used to shower hijackers 
from mainland China with gold and cash rewards. Taiwan began cracking 
down on the hijackers after longstanding tensions with the mainland 
began easing in the 1980s. The 16 hijackers arrested in the 1990s 
have all been jailed for up to 12 years. Two of them were paroled 
and sent back to China. China has demanded that Taiwan send all the 
hijackers back. The two sides were near reaching an agreement about 
repatriation in 1995 when China broke off the talks in anger over 
a Taiwanese drive to gain diplomatic recognition. In recent months, 
the two sides have slowly approached each other to restore the long-stalled 
dialogue. Hijackings in the opposite direction, from Taiwan to the 
mainland, have been rare.
