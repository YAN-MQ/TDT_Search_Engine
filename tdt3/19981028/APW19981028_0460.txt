A burst of lightning killed 11 members of a Congolese soccer team 
and injured dozens more people during a weekend match, the Congolese 
news agency has reported. The lightning strike wiped out all the players 
fielded by the home team in the village of Bena Tshadi, in the south-central 
Congolese province of Eastern Kasai, the Congolese Press Agency said. 
The report could not be independently confirmed. Local investigators 
are blaming the lightning bolt on witchcraft because none of the players 
on the opposing team from nearby Basangana village were injured, the 
agency reported Tuesday. The report said that sorcery is often used 
in the region in an attempt to influence soccer games. The two teams 
were tied 1-1 when the lightning struck. More than 30 people, most 
of the them standing along the sidelines, were injured by the lightning, 
but none of the injuries are believed to be life-threatening, the 
report said. Witchcraft is often blamed throughout west and central 
Africa to explain natural phenomenon and illness. In South Africa 
over the weekend, six players from a local team were hurt when lightning 
struck the playing field during a thunderstorm.
