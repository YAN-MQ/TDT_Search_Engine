Renowned American heart surgeon Michael DiBakki says he believes Russian 
president Boris Yeltsin will return to work in a few weeks. The doctor 
says Mr. Yeltsin is recovering from exhaustion and high blood pressure 
brought on by bronchitis, not heart trouble. The Kremlin says he will 
remain in a Moscow-area rest home for the rest of the week, then go 
on vacation. Meanwhile, a Kremlin aide says the ailing president has 
turned over full control of the economy to Prime Minister Yivgenney 
Primakov.
