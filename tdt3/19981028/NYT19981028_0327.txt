Steve Martin, the actor, comedian and screenwriter, began his fourth 
career _ or was it his fifth? _ with an essay about a birdbath. He 
had read a newspaper article about the discovery at a house on Fifth 
Avenue of a fountain that may have been sculptured by Michelangelo, 
and he conjectured that he had a birdbath by Raphael in his own backyard 
in California, the Martin Birdbath, ``as some scholars are now calling 
it.'' From there, it was a leap to ruminations about the ubiquitousness 
of Monica Lewinsky and to an essay about a drug whose side effects 
completely overwhelm the effects and may include shortening of the 
intestines by 21 feet, and death. His pieces, published in The New 
Yorker (and occasionally in The New York Times) are a cross between 
S.J. Perelman and Dave Barry, but with a fanciful Martinesque twist. 
Twenty-three of Martin's comic musings are collected in ``Pure Drivel'' 
(Hyperion), a slim volume of sharp-witted essays. On the occasion 
of the recent publication of that book, Martin agreed to an interview, 
with the understanding that the talk would be authorial. But, as might 
be expected, there was a sense of improvisation in the air. At the 
Union Square Cafe, amid the editors and writers, there were two stars 
that day, Martin and Mikhail Baryshnikov. Despite his own eminence, 
Martin was in awe of the dancer. ``I wish I had a history like his,'' 
he said. ``I'd be a more interesting interview.'' Then he tried out 
a swift comic jete: ``I escaped from Russia. They didn't appreciate 
my stand-up.'' Actually, Martin escaped from comedy clubs (where they 
did appreciate his stand-up). Following up an interest in old-time 
vaudeville, carnival sideshows, con games and magic, he created a 
comedy act, realizing he was funnier when the tricks didn't work, 
and even funnier when there were no tricks at all. Historically, comedians 
would polish 15 minutes and do the same routine forever. With the 
advent of television, they could, in Martin's words, ``blow it all'' 
in one appearance. But with Martin there was one odd outcome. The 
audience wanted to see him repeat himself, especially on ``Saturday 
Night Live,'' and it looked as if he was going to be pigeonholed perpetually 
as a ``wild and crazy guy'' with an arrow piercing his head. As a 
result, he said, he ``changed trains,'' and moved into the movies 
as an actor and often as a writer of screenplays tailored to his own 
humorous persona. His most recently released film was ``The Spanish 
Prisoner,'' in which he played a con man under the direction of David 
Mamet. His next film is ``The Out-of-Towners,'' with Goldie Hawn, 
a remake of the 1970 movie to be released in March. He just completed 
writing and acting in ``Bowfinger's Big Thing,'' which also stars 
Eddie Murphy, due next summer. He said he had been carrying the idea 
for the screenplay (about a failed film producer) in his head for 
10 years. The essays come much more quickly. He gets an idea (from 
a newspaper, as Perelman did, or from the ether), thinks about it 
for a week and then writes it in half a day. To his surprise, some 
of the pieces have had a wide currency. ``Mars Probe Finds Kittens,'' 
which offers evidence that 27 kittens were living on the red planet, 
was posted on a bulletin board at NASA. Several have been personal, 
like ``Dear Amanda,'' a variation on a series of desperate love letters 
that he once wrote. In another essay, he contemplates the consequences 
of memory loss after age 50, such as sitting in your garden and trying 
to remember your dog's name while calling pet names at random. Although 
he has often faced new challenges, it is his conviction that ``the 
one thing almost guaranteed about a career move is that it almost 
never is.'' Instead, he specializes in what might be called career 
dares. The film ``Roxanne,'' his updating of ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' 
is an example, as is his first play, ``Picasso at the Lapin Agile.'' 
As an art collector and connoisseur, he was inspired by the Picasso 
painting ``Au Lapin Agile'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It 
made him recall that when he was in his 20s, he hung out with his 
friends at a favorite bar in Los Angeles. Although there was no Picasso 
in the crowd, ``we thought we were geniuses.'' The play was tried 
out in a workshop in Australia (his former wife, the actress Victoria 
Tennant, is Australian), and to his amazement it has gone around the 
world, from off-Broadway to Norway to Japan and back to Australia. 
Recently, he saw a tape of that last production, and the actor playing 
Picasso was in whiteface, like a mime. But Martin said he didn't mind 
the divergence from his script. Told that Beckett would have withdrawn 
the rights for such a re-interpretation, Martin said, ``That proves 
I'm not Beckett.'' His playwriting career began on a whim. He asked 
himself what he was good at and answered, ``Ad-libbing on the set, 
and after the thing is made, listening to the audience and fixing 
it.'' That, he decided, is what a play is. Shakespeare, of course, 
would have disagreed, which proves Steve Martin is not Shakespeare. 
But he does have another play in his head, waiting to come out.
