A U.S. energy envoy expressed confidence Wednesday that oil companies 
would pick the proposed Turkish route for oil from the petroleum-rich 
Caspian Sea, outlining U.S. financial support to help with the cost 
of the still-unbuilt pipeline. Turkey has been in intense negotiations 
with energy companies to push them to pick its route from the Caspian, 
whose reserves are believed to be the world's largest outside the 
Middle East but remain largely untapped. The companies are expected 
to announce their decision Nov. 12. Richard Morningstar, U.S. envoy 
for Caspian energy development, stressed U.S. support for the Turkish-backed 
route, which would take oil from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku across 
Georgia to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. ``All the companies 
agreed that Baku-Ceyhan should be the route. The concerns that the 
companies raised were commercial issues that we think are being worked 
out,'' Morningstar said. The chief alternative is an existing pipeline 
from Baku to the Georgian Black Sea of Supsa. Oil companies reportedly 
have been favoring that route, showing reluctance to invest in the 
estimated dlrs 2.5 billion cost of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline. Morningstar 
insisted that the financial concerns of the oil companies were being 
addressed by Turkey. Turkey is offering to build its own stretch of 
the pipeline; Morningstar said the Turks also were offering tax exemptions. 
He outlined planned U.S. financial support for Baku-Ceyhan, including 
backing from the Export-Import Bank, political risk insurance from 
the Overseas Private Investment Corp., and government-sponsored feasibility 
studies. The presidents of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan, 
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are expected to sign a declaration on 
Thursday supporting Baku-Ceyhan. Turkey's main argument against other 
routes is the already heavy oil tanker traffic through the Bosporus 
strait, which has led to hundreds of accidents. On Saturday, Foreign 
Minister Ismail Cem said Turkey would increase restrictions on the 
narrow strait, reducing tanker traffic. ``Turkey has a legitimate 
interest in protecting itself from environmental and safety concerns 
over the overuse of the Bosporus,'' Morningstar said. Meanwhile, the 
Foreign Ministry issued another warning Wednesday, advising oil companies 
that a ``wrong'' decision on the pipeline could lead Turkey to ``give 
priority to sources and producers outside the Caspian.'' This could 
involve diverting Turkey's energy imports from the Caspian to other 
regions such as northern Africa, Norway, and Indonesia, a ministry 
spokesman said.
