There has been a skyjacking in China, but it's all over now. An Air 
China Boeing 737 with more than a hundred passengers and crew was 
diverted to Tibay. Reporter James Mitchell explained to us that it 
was the pilot himself who had diverted the plane. He has been identified. 
And, in fact, we've just had confirmation that he has left the plane, 
along with his wife who was also aboard the aircraft. Now, this is 
not the first time we've had Chinese airliners hijacked to Taiwan. 
But I can't recall a time when the pilots themselves have actually 
flown the plane. There generally have been people onboard with weapons. 
I think this is, in fact, a first. The -- This is the first time that 
a plane has come to Taiwan from the mainland for a number of years. 
The last time was in 1994. People who remember back in the `70s and 
`80s -- there was a number of cases back then. And, in fact, earlier, 
when the hostilities were higher between China and mainland China, 
there used to be a reward here, where pilots were awarded with gold 
if they brought over fighter jets. This has, you know, been discouraged 
in the last number of years. There are still 10 hijackers from mainland 
China serving prison sentences here now. Well, that Air China Boeing 
737 has taken off from the Tibay Airport. It sent it back to China. 
But it has to go by way of Hong Kong because of previous political 
agreements. Reporter James Mitchell talking to us from Taiwan.
