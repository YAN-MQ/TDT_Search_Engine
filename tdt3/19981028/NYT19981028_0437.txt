The Chilean government applauded the ruling Wednesday by the High 
Court in London that Chile's former dictator, retired Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet, is protected by diplomatic immunity. But Chilean human-rights 
activists promised to press on with their efforts to force him to 
stand trial in Spain or some other European country on genocide charges. 
Interior Minister Raul Troncoso appeared on national television to 
say that the government now hoped for a ``quick resolution to this 
case.'' He asked Chileans to keep calm, warning that ``demonstrations 
will only complicate the legal process.'' Nevertheless, about 30 members 
of the Group of the Families of the Detained and Disappeared gathered 
in downtown Santiago to demonstrate their disappointment as soon as 
the ruling was announced. They sang protest songs and waved posters 
with photographs of family members who have been missing since the 
mid-1970s. Viviana Diaz, leader of the group, told reporters that 
the court decision that Pinochet has diplomatic immunity was unacceptable 
because ``he was a dictator who committed so many crimes against humanity 
that he cannot enjoy that right.'' Meanwhile, the Communist Party 
said it was also planning to mobilize a protest demonstration. But 
Pinochet's supporters expressed relief and satisfaction, and promised 
celebratory marches of their own. ``We are pleased,'' said Hernan 
Guillos, vice president of the Pinochet Foundation, an organization 
that seeks to promote the former dictator's image. ``The events that 
have put Chile through so much anguish are about to end.'' The British 
court's ruling essentially followed the arguments made by President 
Eduardo Frei, who has said that Pinochet could not be arrested and 
extradited because he carried a diplomatic passport as a senator for 
life. Pinochet became an unelected member of the Senate seven months 
ago when he stepped down as commander in chief of the Chilean armed 
forces. Privately, Chilean diplomats have pressed for the general's 
release for health reasons, as he is reportedly making a slow recovery 
from back surgery and is suffering from a variety of infections as 
well as diabetes. Pinochet's arrest 13 days ago for possible extradition 
to Spain has set off almost daily demonstrations, scattered violence 
and more than 150 arrests. Over the weekend leftist and rightist parties 
sponsored demonstrations that each attracted more than 20,000 people. 
Government officials and political analysts have warned that a prolonged 
controversy over Pinochet's arrest _ or even his death while in custody 
_ could lead to serious violence and prolong the legacy of polarized 
politics born of 17 years of military dictatorship. ``What I don't 
want is General Pinochet to become a martyr of the right and a cause 
for division for 25 more years,'' said Foreign Minister Jose Miguel 
Insulza.
