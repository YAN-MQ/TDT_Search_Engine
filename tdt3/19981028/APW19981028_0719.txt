Next week's Cup Winners Cup second-round match between Partizan Belgrade 
and Lazio of Rome can go ahead in Belgrade, UEFA said Wednesday. Citing 
security concerns, the European governing body earlier this month 
moved a UEFA Cup match between Red Star Belgrade and Lyon of France 
to Bucharest. The move was prompted by the threat of NATO air strikes 
against Yugoslavia unless it complies with international demands over 
Kosovo. UEFA deferred a decision on the second-leg Partizan match. 
The latest decision was taken ``due to the fact that the political 
situation has improved to the extent that the above-mentioned match 
can now be staged in Belgrade as originally scheduled,'' UEFA said 
in a statement. With Yugoslav forces drawing back from Kosovo, the 
Western military alliance did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes 
after the previous one expired Tuesday. Partizan and Lazio go into 
next Thursday's second-leg match tied 0-0 after last week's first 
leg in Rome. In Belgrade, Branko Bulatovic of the Yugoslav Soccer 
Association welcomed the UEFA decision. ``It's a realistic, just decision, 
in true spirit of sportsmanship,'' the state-run Tanjug news agency 
quoted Bulatovic as saying. ``UEFA has contacted several Western embassies 
in Belgrade and received favorable reports regarding the security 
situation in our country.'' A Euro 2000 qualifier between Yugoslavia 
and Ireland, postponed because of the threat of air raids, has been 
rescheduled for Nov. 18. But UEFA said it will decide on the venue 
next week. A decision will also be taken then on the venue for a qualifier 
between Albania and Greece, rescheduled for the same date after being 
postponed because of political turmoil in Albania.
