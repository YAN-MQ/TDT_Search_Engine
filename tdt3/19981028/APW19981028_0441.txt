French authorities on Wednesday released German suspect Karl-Heinz 
Elschner, accused in the near-fatal beating of a French policeman 
during the World Cup over the summer. Elschner was freed from jail 
in northern French town on Wednesday afternoon after an appeals court 
ordered his release that morning. But the young German was to be kept 
under judicial surveillance in Germany for further questioning, officials 
said. Elschner was accused of taking part in the beating of policeman 
Daniel Nivel last June in the nearby city of Lens during the June 
21 match there between Germany and Yugoslavia. Nivel, 44, lay in a 
coma for six weeks before regaining consciousness. On Oct. 16, witnesses 
said they did not see Elschner near Nivel on the day of the attack. 
Several other suspects in the attack remained held in German jails.
