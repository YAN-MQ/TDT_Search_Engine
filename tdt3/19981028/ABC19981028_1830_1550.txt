With all this attention being given to John Glenn, it does raise the 
question where is the space program going next? ABC's Charlie Gibson 
tonight with some thoughts on this from cape canaveral. You're looking 
at ruins, American ruins. As greeks may feel contemplating the acropolis, 
Romans the Coliseum, you may feel gazing here. For, believe it or 
not, this is what's left of the golden days of American space exploration. 
This is what's left of the launch pads, where Alan shepard, Neil Armstrong 
and John Glenn left for space, abandoned now, given over to weeds, 
rust and neglect. It is cheaper to build new pads for today's bigger 
Rockets than to repair the relics. We have a liftoff. We, as a nation, 
took such pride in those early flights and early heroes who left from 
here. They were the embodiment of our national pride as we struggled 
to catch up to the Russians who dared precede us to space. We achieved 
the magnificent, beat the Russians to the Moon, then reverted to the 
mundane. Instead of expanding frontiers, we reduced the scope of our 
visions and settled into shuttle flights around earth. Oh, the launches 
are spectacular, and the pictures from the shuttle inspire awe, but 
the fact remains, we haven't gone anywhere new in manned flight in 
almost 30 years. Can John Glenn restore the space program to its glory 
days? no. But he at least lets us recall when we can achieve when 
we set our minds and money to it. Shuttle flights are now routine. 
No one takes much notice. But everyone knows Glenn is going tomorrow. 
It has put a bounce back in his step and maybe ours, too, at least 
it lets us recall the glory days. Charles Gibson, ABC News, Kennedy 
space center.
