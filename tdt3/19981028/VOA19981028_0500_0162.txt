U.S. Central Intelligence Chief George Tenet has publicly described 
the CIA role in implementation of the Mideast peace security provisions. 
In an article submitted to the "New York Times," Mr. Tenet says the 
CIA will squash terrorism by improving communications between Israel 
and the Palestinian Authority. But he says the CIA will not place 
agents inside the security operations of either side. And it will 
not arrest or interrogate people.
