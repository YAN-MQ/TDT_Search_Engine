Japan will appeal a World Trade Organization panel ruling backing 
a U.S. claim that its quarantine practices for imports of apples and 
other farm produce are an illegal trade barrier, a Japanese trade 
official said Wednesday. ``We are very disappointed,'' the official 
from the Japanese mission to the WTO in Geneva said on condition of 
anonymity. ``We will take this to the (WTO's) appellate body.'' ``This 
is a win on our part and we are pleased with it,'' a spokesman for 
the U.S. mission in Geneva said. The WTO dispute settlement panel 
agreed with a U.S. contention that there is inadequate scientific 
evidence to justify Japan's practice of testing imports of varieties 
of apples, cherries, nectarines and walnuts before allowing them into 
the country. It said there are alternative measures Japan could take 
to achieve its desired level of protection that would be less restrictive 
than the current practice. Japan mandates repeated testing of quarantine 
treatments each time a country attempts to export a new variety of 
an approved commodity. Japanese officials say the goal is to protect 
the health of its plants from the codling moth. The United States 
claimed Japan was using the rule to block access of competing U.S. 
products. The testing, which takes at least two years, is costly to 
the government and producers, the Clinton administration said. Japan 
has 30 days to formally appeal or comply with the terms of the decision, 
which asks that Japan bring its rules into conformity with trade agreements 
on testing requirements.
