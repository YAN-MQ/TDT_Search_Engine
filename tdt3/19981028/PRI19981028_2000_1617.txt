Brazil now waits for news from the IMF, but how many more crisis-ridden 
economies can the fund support? I'm Patrick O'Connell, at the Business 
Desk, in New York. Brazilians are digesting plans for tax hikes and 
spending caps, aimed at raising 23 billion dollars. The austerity 
measures should now open the door for additional support from the 
IMF, worth at least $30 billion, a fund made up from emergency credits 
from the fund and other lenders including the United States. It is 
a small amount, comparing with the $71 trillion available from the 
IMF for countries hit by economic turmoil. But since the Asian crisis 
started, appeals for help have gathered pace. Over the last year, 
the number of countries borrowing from the fund, increased four-fold. 
John Lipski is the chief economist with Chase-Manhattan. The fund 
has a large numbers of programs. I think it is actually, the largest 
number, ever in their history. And because of the size of many of 
these programs, Indonesia, Korea, etc, they have been strapped for 
funds, by historical standards. Certainly the recent action by the 
US authorities, the Congress, in approving new funding for the IMF 
is going to be very helpful in that regard. How much of a drain does 
it seem to you that funding the IMF? How much of a drain is that on 
the US taxpayer? It's trivial. It's not really, in strict terms, a 
drain. What happens, of course, is that countries make a contribution 
to the funds quota. But that is a revolving fund, on which countries 
earn interest, if their capitol apportion is actually drawn on. In 
other words, A, this isn't charity. The US taxpayer doesn't pay in 
money, never to be seen again. It is simply not that way. The IMF 
is expected to announce the details of its financial package for Brazil 
over the next few days. The hope, to shore up Latin America's largest 
economy and fight off the contagion which has strained the fund's 
reserves. I'm Patrick O'Connell for The World, in New York.
