PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO is keeping more than 400 warplanes 
on alert as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic continues to withdraw 
forces from Kosovo and allows tens of thousands of refugees to return 
home. A senior NATO general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, said Wednesday 
that the withdrawal of Serb forces is incomplete but moves so far 
represent a ``considerable step in the direction of fulfilling the 
demands.'' With Yugoslav forces drawing back, the Western military 
alliance did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous 
one expired Tuesday. That bitterly disappointed Kosovo's ethnic Albanian 
politicians who hoped the Alliance would deliver a devastating air 
blow to Milosevic's war machine. ``Milosevic has known all along that 
NATO would not be bombing, that he would be getting away with what 
he and his military police have been doing here in Kosovo,'' Muhamet 
Hamiti of the League of Democratic Kosovo said Wednesday. ``NATO has 
been frightening itself for too long.'' But by warning that the threat 
of attack remains, NATO hopes to guarantee the safety of the ethnic 
Albanian refugees who are terrified of returning home unless government 
troops and Serb police are held back. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 
2 million residents are ethnic Albanian, and most favor independence. 
Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia. ``We 
know that President Milosevic only moves when he is presented with 
the credible threat of force,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
told a news conference after a 2 1-2-hour meeting of NATO ambassadors 
in Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday. ``This crisis is far from over,'' 
he said. ``I urge both sides to take advantage of the opportunity 
that now exists to move the political process forward.'' In an Oct. 
12 peace deal, American negotiator Richard Holbrooke demanded that 
Milosevic cut the number of troops and police in Kosovo to the levels 
of last February, when Milosevic began his crackdown on the separatist 
Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds have died in the fighting and 300,000 
ethnic Albanians have been forced from their homes. In an interview 
Wednesday with Radio Germany, Naumann said Serb police had still not 
pulled out of one of eight locations they agreed to leave. He said 
NATO would keep up the pressure to make sure there was no backsliding 
on Milosevic's part. In Washington, U.S., 8th graf pvs.
