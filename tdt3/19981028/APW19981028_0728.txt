The High Court on Wednesday quashed Spanish arrest warrants against 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, ruling that the former Chilean dictator is 
entitled to immunity from prosecution. ``The applicant is entitled 
as a former head of state to immunity from civil and criminal proceedings 
of the English court,'' Lord Chief Justice Thomas Bingham said. Dozens 
of Chilean exiles in court cheered when they heard Pinochet, 82, must 
remain in custody pending appeal by a Spanish magistrate. Summing 
up Pinochet's case, Bingham said, ``A former head of state is clearly 
entitled to immunity for criminal acts committed in the course of 
exercising public functions.'' ``I order that both provisional warrants 
be quashed. We will listen to any argument that will be addressed 
to us on leave to appeal,'' he said. Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon 
was given leave to appeal because of the ``obvious public importance 
and international interest ... as to the outcome,'' the judge said. 
British police arrested Pinochet in his bed at a London hospital Oct. 
16 on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition 
to face charges of murder, kidnapping and torturing political opponents 
during his 17-year rule. He underwent back surgery Oct. 9. Since the 
arrest, other groups have filed suits seeking to have him tried in 
Europe. In a separate development Wednesday, British Attorney General 
John Morris turned down a bid by four Chilean exiles to have Pinochet 
stand trial in Britain on torture charges. ``There is insufficient 
admissible evidence under English law of an offense,'' the Attorney 
General's office said in a statement. Groups in Sweden, Switzerland 
and France are also seeking to have Pinochet tried in Europe. Pinochet
