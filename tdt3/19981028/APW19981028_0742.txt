The High Court on Wednesday quashed Spanish arrest warrants against 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, ruling that the former Chilean dictator is 
entitled to immunity from prosecution. ``The applicant is entitled 
as a former head of state to immunity from civil and criminal proceedings 
of the English court,'' Lord Chief Justice Thomas Bingham said. Dozens 
of Chilean exiles in court cheered when they heard Pinochet, 82, must 
remain in custody pending appeal by Britain's Crown Prosecution Service. 
Summing up Pinochet's case, Bingham said, ``A former head of state 
is clearly entitled to immunity for criminal acts committed in the 
course of exercising public functions.'' ``I order that both provisional 
warrants be quashed. We will listen to any argument that will be addressed 
to us on leave to appeal,'' he said. He ordered that the British government 
should pay Pinochet's costs of 350,000 pounds (dlrs 560,000). British 
prosecutors were given leave to appeal because of the ``obvious public 
importance and international interest ... as to the outcome,'' the 
judge said.
