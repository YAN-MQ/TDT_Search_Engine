Russia has strategic interests in all of the Balkans, not just Serbia, 
the foreign minister said in an interview published Wednesday, underlining 
Moscow's firm opposition to NATO airstrikes. ``The Balkans have always 
been a zone of special strategic interest for Russia due to obvious 
reasons _ the territorial closeness and access to the Mediterranean,'' 
Igor Ivanov was quoted as telling Izvestia. ``We are linked with that 
region not only by sentimental feelings, but broad economic perspectives.'' 
Russia has staunchly opposed the use of force against Serbia, the 
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, for its crackdown on ethnic Albanians 
in Kosovo province. Russia and Serbia share Slavic and Orthodox religious 
roots. Ivanov also claimed Russia played a decisive role in averting 
NATO airstrikes so far, by coming up with the idea to deploy 2,000 
observers from the Organizations for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
to Kosovo. ``The idea to set up the OSCE mission belongs to us,'' 
he said. NATO said Tuesday that the Kosovo conflict is far from over 
despite the withdrawal of thousands of Serb police from the province 
and decided to keep more than 400 warplanes on alert. U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright said NATO would move quickly to use force 
against Yugoslavia if Serb President Slobodan Milosevic sends troops 
and special police back to Kosovo to threaten ethnic Albanian civilians. 
Ivanov said that any military action should be approved by the United 
Nations Security Council. He had earlier said that Russia would veto 
such a move. The OSCE observers in Kosovo, including 200 Russians, 
should be properly protected, but ``there can be no talk about NATO's 
automatic right for military operations,'' Ivanov said. ``We don't 
like the word `automatic,' because there is a temptation to interpret 
it too loosely,'' he added. Ivanov emphasized that the main threat 
to the peaceful settlement in Kosovo comes from the ethnic Albanian 
militants who struggle for Kosovo's secession from Serbia. ``Our diplomats 
keep telling our Western partners: we know how to force Belgrade to 
account for its action, but no one knows what to do with the other 
side,'' he said. ``Meanwhile, everyone understands that Kosovo's secession 
from Yugoslavia would entail terrible consequences for the rest of 
Europe.'' Ivanov also repeated Russia's opposition to the eastward 
expansion of NATO. ``NATO means collective security for a group of 
nations,'' he said. ``Why should Russia feel safe along with them? 
As of now, the North Atlantic Treaty is a military machine aimed in 
a direction that is quite clear.'' Ivanov ruled out Russia joining 
NATO or the European Union some day. ``Our country is far too big, 
the Russian scale is far too grandiose,'' he said. ``These organizations 
would be unable to remain what they are, if Russia joined them.''
