After she finished 10th in the 1996 Olympic marathon, Anne Marie Lauck 
and her husband, Jim, took a Christmas season vacation to Hawaii. 
It was a chance to relax and celebrate, to pop the cork on a successful 
season. But, in one horrific moment, her career nearly ended just 
as it had reached its peak. The couple had hiked four miles along 
a rugged jungle trail on the island of Kauai, arriving at a spectacular 
400-foot waterfall, when a rock slide rained down. One rock struck 
Lauck on the left shoulder, causing a compound fracture where the 
clavicle meets the scapula. Her husband fashioned a sling out of his 
shirt, ran two miles to the nearest phone and called for a rescue 
helicopter that transported Lauck to a local hospital for surgery. 
``It was a real mess,'' she said. ``But we were fortunate. We could 
have easily been killed.'' The injury led to biomechanical problems 
that compromised Lauck's season in 1997. This year, she completed 
a six-month course in massage therapy and contemplated retirement. 
But her health has returned, and for the first time since Atlanta, 
she will run a 26.2-mile race when she competes Sunday in the New 
York City Marathon. It has become fashionable for many top American 
runners to enter the Chicago Marathon, with its flat course and inviting 
appearance fees. But Lauck, 29, grew up near New York, in Glen Gardner, 
N.J., and she is drawn here because the victorious images of Alberto 
Salazar and Grete Waitz are preserved in her mind as if in amber. 
``It's probably my first remembrance of any event,'' Lauck said. ``People 
think New York is a pressure pot. It has the opposite effect on me. 
I feel comfortable here. I grew up with the event. It's part of my 
makeup. I want to win.'' This will be Lauck's third entry in New York. 
She started too quickly in 1993, overheated and dropped out at 23 
miles. A year later, she finished third to Tegla Loroupe, who has 
since set the world record at 2 hours 20 minutes 47 seconds and will 
be seeking her third New York victory on Sunday. The key, as Lauck 
sees it, will be patience. Her personal best of 2:30:19 is nearly 
10 minutes slower than Loroupe's, but she must avoid depleting herself 
in the first half of the race and risk exhaustion on the hills of 
Central Park. There is no need to go through 13.1 miles in 1:10 or 
1:12, she said, when 1:13, 1:14 or 1:15 is more practical. ``If I 
run to my capability through the first half and not run crazy, I'll 
be in the thick of it,'' Lauck said. She feels ambivalent about the 
Olympic marathon _ proud that she finished in the top 10, disappointed 
that she didn't finish higher after living and training in Atlanta 
to acclimate herself to the heat and humidity. ``Unfortunately, that 
day my body didn't perform the way it had been trained to do,'' Lauck 
said. After her scary accident in Hawaii, it began to appear as if 
the Olympic marathon might be Lauck's last. Obsessive about training, 
Lauck began walking for two or three hours a day a week later on a 
treadmill. But she could not walk smoothly with one arm bound to her 
side by a sling, and her form was thrown out of whack. Eventually, 
the imbalance led to a strain of her upper left hamstring that was 
annoyingly slow to heal. She struggled to recover from hard workouts. 
A difference of opinion over training led to a split with her coach, 
Salazar, and she advanced into massage therapy training. But as she 
eventually realized, ``I didn't want to do this; I wanted to run.'' 
By May, her body started coming around as she did cautious track work 
near her home in Hampton, N.J. In late September, she finished an 
encouraging third in 1:11:23 in the Philadelphia Distance Run, a half-marathon. 
The precipitous drop in marathon times for men and women this year 
is ``mind-boggling,'' Lauck said. The suspicion of widespread drug 
use has cast a dark cloud over the sport, and Lauck called it ``sad 
that any time there's a fast time, people think something is not legitimate. 
But what if it is?'' All she can do is run her best ``with a clean 
slate,'' Lauck said. And she hopes that will be sufficient to drop 
her personal record to 2:27 or 2:28. ``It's about time I should be 
under 2:30,'' she said. ``It's getting nagging to say it's my p.r.''
