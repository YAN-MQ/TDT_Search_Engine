Two seals that were believed to have made their way to Vietnam from 
the North Pole five months ago have died five days apart, an Institute 
of Oceanology official said Wednesday. Dao Tan Ho said one of the 
seals died last Wednesday and the other on Monday. Neither ate during 
the previous day. Autopsies found that both suffered from serious 
lung infections, Ho said, but could not determine the cause of the 
deaths. He said it was the first time that the institute, in the central 
coastal city of Nha Trang, had tried to raise seals. The institute 
bought the seals from local fishermen who caught them off the coast 
of the central provinces of Quang Ngai and Quang Binh in May. Ho said 
the seals, which had fattened up to 25 kilograms (55 pounds) each, 
compared with 15 kilograms (33 pounds) when they were brought in, 
might have been driven to Vietnam by strong currents from the Sea 
of Japan. The seals have been stuffed so visitors can see them in 
the institute museum.
