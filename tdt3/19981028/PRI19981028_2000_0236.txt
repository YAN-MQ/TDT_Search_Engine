Much of Honduras has suffered under hurricane force winds for more 
than a day, as Hurricane Mitch stalled off the coast, and pounded 
the Central American nation with drenching rain and sustained winds 
as high as 120 mph. Honduran authorities blame the storm for more 
than 30 deaths, but say the toll is expected to go higher. The eye 
of the hurricane is only 30 miles off the Honduran coast. And it's 
hurricane force winds extend for about 70 miles inland.
