Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used a visit by Mauritania's foreign 
minister Wednesday to reaffirm Israel's desire to improve relations 
with the Arab world. Israel has tied the visit to a over-all warming 
of relations resulting from the latest Mideast peace agreement negotiated 
in eastern Maryland last week. Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammed Khouna 
also hinted at a connection during brief remarks with reporters following 
a meeting with Netanyahu on Wednesday. ``I arrived carrying a letter 
from his excellency President Sid'Ahmed Ould Taya to prime minister 
Netanyahu to congratulate him on the signing of the Wye agreement 
and express support to the peace process,'' Khouna said. Netanyahu 
told reporters that the two countries discussed upgrading relations, 
but he did say whether any official changes were imminent. He also 
said broadening relations with Muslim and Arab countries ``will advance 
the security and stability in our region.'' Israel and Mauritania 
established low-level interest offices in November 1995. ``They are 
going to (do) their best to improve bilateral relations and they expect, 
at the same time, other Arab countries will do the same,'' said David 
Dadonn, an Israeli foreign ministry official. Several Arab countries 
established low ties with the Jewish state after Israel and the Palestinians 
first signed peace accords in 1993 and 1995. Contacts froze, however, 
during the 17-month stalemate under Netanyahu's hard line administration. 
Khouna arrived in Israel Tuesday and has also met with Israeli President 
Ezer Weizman and Dan Tichon, the speaker of Israel's parliament. Khouna's 
Thursday schedule includes a visit to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust 
memorial, and a possible meeting with Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, 
who has been ill with the flu.
