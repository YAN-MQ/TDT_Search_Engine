Russia's Prime Minister Primakov stood in for Mr. Yeltsin at Tuesday's 
Vienna meeting with leaders of the European Union. Mr. Primakov has 
received promises of European Union support for his country's economic 
reforms, but no new financial commitments to boost its devastated 
finances. He urged the EU to boost investments in his country. But 
the Austrian Chancellor, Victor Cleemat -- whose country holds the 
EU's rotating presidency -- says the EU wants to see results from 
Russia's reform package before large investments can resume. The EU 
is Russia's biggest business partner, accounting for more than 35 
percent of its foreign trade.
