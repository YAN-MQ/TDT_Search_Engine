The former security minister of Georgia, who resigned earlier this 
week, has been appointed deputy secretary of the National Security 
Council in the former Soviet republic, ITAR-Tass said Wednesday. Dzhemal 
Gakhokidze resigned from the Cabinet on Monday, a week after mutinous 
soldiers staged a one-day revolt against President Eduard Shevardnadze. 
Gakhokidze said he resigned because financial shortages made it impossible 
to carry out key reforms in the country's security system, according 
to the Interfax news agency. Under Gakhokidze's leadership, the security 
ministry failed to head off a number of violent incidents, including 
a rocket attack on Shevardnadze, the hostage-taking of four U.N. observers, 
and the Oct. 19 revolt. Thirty-one people have been arrested in connection 
with the revolt, although the leader, Akakiy Eliava, remains at large. 
Eliava is a military commander who supported the late Georgian president, 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it gained 
independence in 1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought a short 
war in a bid to return to power. He died under mysterious circumstances 
in 1994.
