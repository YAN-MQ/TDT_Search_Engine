Israel's Secret Service has tightened security around Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and his aids, following death threats from Jewish 
extremists. From Jerusalem NPR's Eric Weiner reports.;; Israel's Secret 
Service has assigned more body guards to protect Prime Minister Netanyahu, 
and according to Israel Radio advised him to appear in public less 
often. They fear that right-wing Jewish extremists may try to assassinate 
the Israeli leader following his signing of the peace agreement with 
the Palestinians last week. The agreement calls for Israel to hand 
over another 13% of the West Bank in exchange for security guarantees 
from the Palestinians. At demonstrations this week, some Israeli protesters 
called Netanyahu a traitor, the same language used shortly before 
Prime Minister Yizhak Rabin was shot to death by a Jewish extremist 
in 1995. Today Israeli police announced that they have increased surveillance 
of radical Jewish groups that may be planning attacks aimed at derailing 
the peace process. This is Eric Weiner, NPR News, Jerusalem.
