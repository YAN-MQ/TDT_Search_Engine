Inflation on Australia remained tame in the third quarter, with the

Australia will cut interest rates to boost growth. Peter Osborne is 
with Merril Lynch in Sidney and says the Australian economy has weathered 
the Asia crisis. and 60 percent of our exports go to the region. But

side of the economy is performing well, particularly housing, business 
investment. And consumer spending was quite robust. Mr. Osborne expects 
growth in Australia to be at least three percent this year. That's
