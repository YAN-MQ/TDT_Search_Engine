In the state of Texas, 17-year-old gymnast Dominique Moceanu became 
an adult in the eyes of the law today when a Houston judge approved 
a Settlement reached last night that gives her financial independence 
from her parents. The gold medal winner ran away from a home last 
week as you may know, filed a lawsuit claiming her parents squandered 
her trust fund. She said she is glad the unusual legal battle is over. 
This is, you know, a great day, but a sad day. D I'm looking forward 
for the future and having a close relationship with my parents. As 
a legal adult, Moceanu can begin to demand information about the trust 
fund now, including how the money is being spent. It is unclear if 
any money remains in the trust.
