Air force meteorologists are predicting a dramatically improved forecast 
for Thursday's launch of space shuttle "discovery." There had been 
concern hurricane Mitch could disrupt takeoff. Meteorologists now 
say there is zero chance bad weather will delay liftoff. That's good 
news for John Glenn and the rest of the crew who arrived at kennedy 
space center Monday. They spent part of Tuesday undergoing medical 
checks.
