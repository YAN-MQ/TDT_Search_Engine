Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen is sure Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix 
will be such a clean race he will secure his first Formula One world 
title without anyone crashing into him. ``I believe it will be a completely 
fair fight this time,'' the 30-year-old Finn said. ``That's what everybody 
wants, and everyone in the world will be watching.'' It helps that 
all he needs is second place. He holds a four-point lead over Ferrari's 
Michael Schumacher going into the season-ending race. ``Michael cannot 
take any risks. He has to finish the race because if we both retired 
I'd still have more points than him and win,'' said Hakkinen, who 
hopes to hand McLaren its first constructors title since 1991. Hakkinen 
brushed off questions about any possible dirty play from his German 
rival _ although he acknowledged some have pointed to a Formula Three 
race 10 years ago in Macau when the two racers crashed. ``We don't 
want people pointing the finger afterward. It is a very critical position 
going into the race, but nobody will want to risk an accident,'' Hakkinen 
said. In the season-ending Grand Prix last year in Jerez, Spain, Schumacher 
rammed Jacques Villeneuve in what was widely viewed as a deliberate 
attempt to knock him out of the race and win the title. But it was 
Schumacher who slid out of the race and Villeneuve went on to clinch 
the title. In 1989 at Suzuka, Artyon Senna and Alain Prost collided, 
and a year later, Senna drove Prost off the track at the first corner 
to clinch the title. In 1994 in Adelaide, Schumacher collided with 
Damon Hill to win the title. Hakkinen was firm, however, that whatever 
happened in the past will have no effect on the Suzuka race. ``I have 
never done dirty on the track and I never will _ that is not my style. 
But it is not something I am worried about with Michael,'' he said. 
Two-time world champion Schumacher is predicting he will capture his 
third with a victory Sunday. Schumacher has reason to be confident 
on the difficult Suzuka course. He won the Japanese Grand Prix last 
year for Ferrari and in 1995 while driving for Benetton. But to beat 
Hakkinen, he may also need the help of teammate Eddie Irvine. Irvine 
has said he is aiming to finish second behind Schumacher. A possible 
factor in Shumacher's favor is the weather. Rain is common in November 
in Suzuka and Schumacher is a great wet-weather driver. If the German 
wins and Hakkinen finishes no better than third, Ferrari would have 
its first championship driver since Jody Scheckter in 1979 and its 
first constructors title in 15 years. Schumacher's name would also 
be added to the elite list of drivers who have won the world championship 
three times. Only five have done that _ the late Ayrton Senna, Jack 
Brabham, Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda and Nelson Piquet. Alain Prost 
won four, and Argentine pioneer Juan Manuel Fangio had five. Team 
chief Eddie Jordan agreed rain could help Schumacher _ but perhaps 
younger brother Ralf rather than Michael. ``If it rains, then I would 
put my money on Schumacher,'' said Jordan. ``But by that I mean Michael 
or Ralf.'' If Ralf Schumacher wins and Michael Schumacher places second, 
Hakkinen must come sixth or lower for the elder Schumacher to take 
the title. With seven victories in 15 races this year, winning is 
nothing new for Hakkinen. But a driver's title would be his first. 
Hakkinen said he respected Schumacher. ``He's a good driver and a 
good racer, after all he's two times the world champion,'' Hakkinen 
said. ``But I don't think he is anything to fear.'' Hill, who was 
crowned world champion on the Japanese track in 1996, predicts Hakkinen 
will get the same honors, come Sunday. ``It is going to be a tall 
order for Michael to beat Mika and they both know it,'' said Hill. 
For Hakkinen, relief is in knowing that all he has to do is come in 
second. Even if Schumacher wins, both would then have 96 points, and 
Hakkinen would win by virtue of more seconds. ``The whole year I've 
been fighting for first, and winning races and getting pole positions. 
Now it's different,'' he said. ``I can go to the Grand Prix and just 
finish second.''
