And for dlrs 32 million, the owner of the lucky six numbers, the holder 
of Italy's all-time-biggest jackpot, the lucky lotto winner is: No 
one. For the 10th straight drawing, there was no winning ticket Wednesday 
in a lottery that now rivals Europe's biggest ever. Italians' misfortune 
was the Super Enalotto jackpot's gain: It grows to about dlrs 37 million 
for next week's drawing, topping the dlrs 36 million of Britain's 
1995 National Lottery. Ever-more Italians lined up at tobacco stores, 
betting parlors and lotto kiosks as Wednesday evening's deadline approached; 
one robber held up a kiosk to get his ticket at gunpoint. Authorities 
estimated two out of three Italians were playing _ although with the 
jackpot the talk of schools, offices and the street, it was hard to 
find anyone representing the one-in-three crowd. Still, the odds-on 
favorite prevailed Wednesday: Chances of picking the correct six numbers 
were set at 1-in-622,614,630 - a number that's about 10 times higher 
than there even are people in Italy. By contrast, July's dlrs 295.7 
million Powerball lottery in the United States was a comparatively 
easy 1-to-80.1 million shot. Critics have suggested Italy should give 
luck a little better chance, limiting the game's possible numbers 
to far fewer than the 90 now in play.
