When we come back, not everyone is nostalgic about John Glenn's return 
to space. We'll take "A closer look." People who mak E a living with 
their tools... prefer to buy their tools at the home Depot... more 
than any other store in America. And wether it's the selection... 
the quality brands we offer... or our guaranteed commitment to the 
lowest prices... we think it's a pretty powerful argument for why 
you should shop here too. The home Depot... and who's making sure 
business has the latest technology? Like the Intel Pentium II xeon 
processor in a custom-built server. ..plus a desktop and laptop. And 
who does all that one customer at a time? Gateway. So give us a call. 
I can't afford to have rough hands. Not with my patients. Oh, yes, 
you are. I try to keep my hands smooth so that it will be comforting 
when I touch the patient. It's a great thing that this hospital uses 
keri. Keri's therapeutic formula works on three levels. First, it 
soothes. Then, it moisturizes. Finally, it protects against dryness. 
The babies love it when my hands are soft because then my skin iss 
soft as theirs. Keri. It's trusted therapy for dry skin. And there's 
keri anti-bacterial hand lotion to kill germs as it softens hands.
