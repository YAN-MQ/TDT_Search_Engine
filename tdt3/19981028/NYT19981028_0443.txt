He usually walks with a cane now, but rather than be on his feet for 
too long, he'll sit in a wheelchair. Ted Williams is 80 years old, 
somewhat affected by the stroke he had in 1994, but he still glows 
as a baseball idol. In Boston, the Ted Williams Tunnel is under the 
harbor. In and around Fenway Park, they talk about him as if he were 
still hitting .406 in 1941, still crashing home runs over the bullpen 
into the right-center-field bleachers, still loping after fly balls 
as a left fielder. To the Red Sox loyalists, Teddy Ballgame is still 
their idol. But when he was asked about John Glenn, his voice boomed 
as it always has, as if through a public-address system. ``John Glenn,'' 
he said, referring to the 77-year-old retiring senator from Ohio, 
who will be launched Thursday in the space shuttle Discovery, ``is 
my idol in life right now.'' Their relationship goes back more than 
40 years to when they were Marine pilots during the Korean War. ``When 
I first got there, I didn't know anybody so I went to the pilots' 
room just to get acquainted,'' Williams was saying last Friday during 
his visit to the opening of the Yogi Berra Museum in Little Falls, 
N.J. ``I looked over to the other end of the room and I saw two Marine 
majors there. I didn't know who they were, but they looked good to 
me. ``One was John Glenn. The other one, I've forgotten his name, 
but he became a major general.'' Williams, who had been a Marine pilot 
during World War II, was hitting .400 after six games with the Red 
Sox in 1952 when he was recalled to active duty as a captain during 
the Korean conflict. ``I'm praying for a quick truce,'' he joked at 
the time. Williams, then 33, would serve a 17-month hitch at a salary 
of $7,000 a year. In Korea he was attached to Marine Air Group 33 
for aerial reconnaissance. Glenn was the squadron commander. ``I flew 
wing with John two or three times,'' he said. One of Williams' 39 
missions was with Glenn on what the pilots called an ``early-early,'' 
taking off in the darkness before dawn. ``You were in the air,'' he 
said, ``and going to the target.'' Williams could see Glenn peering 
through the darkness. ``John's looking for anything he can see _ a 
light, a tunnel, a bridge,'' he said. ``We had two 250-pound bombs, 
but now I could see a lot of stuff coming up at us. I thought, `What 
am I doing up here!' We dropped our bombs and hurried back to our 
base. I asked him later, `Did you see all that stuff coming up at 
us?' But he didn't seem to think it was anything startling.'' Not 
many people knew about their relationship until Glenn, appearing at 
a 1988 dinner in Boston for Williams' longtime charity, the Jimmy 
Fund, described his wingman's flaming landing. ``When the F-9 got 
hit and caught on fire,'' Glenn told the audience that night, ``the 
tail would blow off almost every time. So the standard orders were 
that if you had a fire in the back of the plane, you were were to 
eject immediately. Ted was trailing smoke and fire. People were yelling 
at him over the radio, `Get out!' But his radio was out and he couldn't 
see all this going on behind him.'' Larry Hawkins, a young lieutenant 
from Pennsylvania, pulled his jet alongside Williams' jet. ``Hawkins 
saved my life; he got me back to the base,'' Williams has often said. 
``I came barreling in at a little more than 200 miles an hour, fighting 
the stick all the way. No dive brakes, flaps, nothing to slow up the 
plane. Then I heard a hollow whoomph behind me.'' When the plane finally 
skidded to a flaming stop, Williams jumped out and ran. Moments later, 
his jet exploded. In 1959, Williams got a letter from Glenn, then 
one of the original seven Mercury astronauts. And ever since they 
have talked to each other every so often. ``It's just too bad,'' Williams, 
a staunch Republican, once told him, ``that you're a Democrat.'' About 
a week ago, Glenn, whose space shuttle is scheduled to be launched 
Thursday at 2 p.m. at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, 
Fla., phoned Williams at the Hall of Fame slugger's Hernando, Fla., 
home. ``I never heard him so excited,'' Ted Williams recalled. ``He 
was raving about the crew he's going up with. I'm proud to say that 
I know John Glenn.''
