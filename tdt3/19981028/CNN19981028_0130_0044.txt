"CNN Headline News," I'm David Goodnow. Thanks for joining us. Hurricane 
Mitch has begun its assault on central America. Tens of thousands 
of people have fled coastal areas, as Mitch batters the region with 
fierce winds and heavy rains. At least 11 deaths are attributed to 
the storm. Hurricane warnings are in effect for the Caribbean coast 
of Honduras, guatemala, Belize and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. Forecasters 
say the storm could drop as much as 20 inches of rain in some parts. 
Ginger Blackstone reports on how Mexicans are preparing for Mitch's 
arrival. Some wooden planks and a handful of nails are about all this 
man has to protect his home from the most-powerful hurricane in a 
decade. It sounds like it is too dangerous and we have to find a safer 
place to avoid risking our lives. Hundreds of others, who live along 
the Mexican coast, waited patiently in line for bus rides to take 
them to higher ground. Although hurricane Mitch isn't expected to 
hit the Yucatan peninsula until thursday, evacuations are already 
under way. So is last minute shopping. Grocery stores are running 
out of food. Yes it's expensive, but we have to buy it. I am a little 
sad because I don't know if we're going to get through this. At the 
airport in cancun, tourists discovered many flights were canceled 
because the weather was already getting too dangerous. Other flights 
out were booked solid. It's been, for the last two days, very, very 
bad. But some tourists were taking it all in stride, saying Mitch 
wasn't going to scare them away. I've never been through one so I 
don't know what to expect actually. So no, I'm not. Intrigued more 
than scared. We're staying, all of us, we're here until they kick 
us out. We're staying in cancun 'til they kick us out. As shopkeepers 
prepared for Mitch's onslaught, the Mexican government declared a 
maximum alert for three states. Hundreds of troops have been sent 
in to prepare for relief efforts. Until then, it's a matter of waiting.
