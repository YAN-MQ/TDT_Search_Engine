It's time for a quick dip into The World's mail bag, which this week, 
has a distinctly culinary flavor. Brad Briggs e-mailed us from Greencastle 
High School in Indiana, to say "Muchisimus gracius " for the international 
recipes we feature on the show, and then post on The World on-line. 
He reckons he'll be a hit on his school's international night, when 
he predicts the Spanish Club will finally give the French Club a run 
for its money. Our story about British cuisine provoked a listener 
John Gardner. Yesterday, Boris Maximov told us that a top British 
TV chef was dedicating one of her shows to explaining such basic tasks 
as how to boil an egg. Boris said that over the years, many Brits 
had fled their country simply to escape boiled food. Well, Mr. Gardner 
points out, that in 60 years of eating in Britain, he's hardly had 
any boiled food. And in fact, the traditional style is to roast, or 
bake. Boris tells us that he is having difficulty tasting anything 
with his tongue so firmly in cheek. If you hear anything on The World 
that inspires you to drop us a line, you can e-mail us at theworld@pri.org 
or call our listener line at 617-8687-5750. Or send a letter to The 
World, 125 Western Ave., Boston, Mass. 02134.
