A Spanish Judge says he'll keep trying to extradite Augusto Pinochet, 
despite a British High Court decision saying that British prosecutors 
had no right to arrest the former Chilean dictator. Pinochet will 
remain under arrest in London until prosecutors appeal the decision. 
In Madrid, Judge Baltizar Garzone said he'll keep trying to bring 
the 82-yar-old former leader to justice in Spain, on charges of murder, 
torture, and other abuses during Pinochet's 17-year regime. Pinochet 
was in London for medical treatment when he was arrested 12 days ago.
