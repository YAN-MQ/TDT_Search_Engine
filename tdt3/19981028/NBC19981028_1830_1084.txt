A reminder that "Dateline" will have much more on jerrie cobb. When 
we come back, "living longer, living better," a same day. Two coughs. 
Your choice-- robitussin-dm or vicks 44. Both the same, right? how 
about four hours later? And later than that? - - time will tell you 
vicks 44 is different. With robitussin-dm, you should re-dose every 
four hours... while soothing vicks 44 lasts up to four hours more. 
And with your eight-hour day, that's a real plus. The truck is here. 
Introducing the new Silverado... it's bigger. It's more powerful. 
It's the truck from Chevrolet. Like a rock oh, like a rock.
