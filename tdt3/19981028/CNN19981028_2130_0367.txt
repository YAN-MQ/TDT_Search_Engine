Senator John Glenn and his fellow discovery astronauts have a few 
preflight activities planned tonight. They'll stand at the base of 
the launch pad this evening and observe the shuttle that will take 
them into space. And they are spending an hour saying good-bye to 
their families. But it is not an intimate event. The good-bye takes 
place across a street, so as to not pass on any germs. Discovery is 
set to lift off tomorrow. Forecasters say the weather will be perfect 
for a launch. Before boarding the space shuttle, the astronauts will 
have the traditional prelaunch breakfast of steak and eggs. We'll 
have more on a day in the life of these shuttle astronauts in a few 
minutes.
