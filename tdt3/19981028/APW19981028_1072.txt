Despite bowing to NATO demands over Kosovo, Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic is reinforcing his grip on power by firing his secret service 
chief and refusing to budge on his purge of Serbia's independent media. 
On Tuesday, the government announced that secret service chief Jovica 
Stanisic was fired and replaced by police Gen. Radomir Markovic. Stanisic, 
who assumed the powerful post in 1991, was considered one of the main 
pillars of Milosevic's rule. Recently, he was reported as being critical 
of Milosevic's crackdown in Kosovo and his alliance with ultranationalist 
extremists. His removal indicated hard-liners are gaining ground against 
moderates within the Yugoslav government. Milosevic has used a threat 
of NATO attacks against military targets in Yugoslavia to clamp down 
on his opponents at home. NATO said Tuesday that Milosevic had withdrawn 
enough forces from Kosovo to avoid airstrikes. But the alliance reserved 
the right to attack if he resumes his crackdown on ethnic Albanian 
separatists seeking independence for the southern Serbian province. 
Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of Kosovo, a province of 
Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic. Opposition leader Zoran Djindjic 
said Stanisic's replacement was ``worrying'' and reminded him of Communist 
purges in former Yugoslavia. Slavko Curuvija, the editor of the independent 
daily Dnevni Telegraf, said the regime is sacking ``all those who 
think with their own heads.'' Another opposition leader, Vuk Obradovic, 
said Stanisic was a ``professional'' and a ``reasonable'' man. He 
said he expected more key figures in Serbia to resign or be replaced. 
Stanisic was quoted Wednesday by the independent Glas Javnosti daily 
as saying he had rejected offers for another job. In a statement released 
Wednesday through the independent Beta news agency, Stanisic insisted 
that he had done nothing illegal and was loyal to ``the Serbian president.'' 
The wording of the statement indicated Stanisic feared he could be 
blamed for professional wrongdoing. At the same time, Milosevic shows 
no sign of easing up on his crackdown on independent Serbian media. 
In a meeting Tuesday with editors and broadcasters, U.S. envoy Christopher 
Hill promised he would again push the issue with the autocratic president. 
``I assure you I have raised the issue at the highest level here very 
forcefully,'' Hill told reporters. ``I am sorry to say... we don't 
seem to have ... results.'' Last week, Serbian parliament passed a 
new media law severely restricting press freedom and instituting severe 
fines for those publishing ``anti-patriotic'' and ``anti-government'' 
stories. ``You cannot wipe out independent media any more than you 
can deprive people of oxygen,'' Hill said. ``It is a 19th century 
means, not worthy even of the Ottoman empire,'' Hill said, referring 
to Serbia's ancient enemy, the Ottoman Turks. Also Tuesday, independent 
daily NT Plus halted publication after telephone threats to its chief 
editor, Momcilo Djogovic. ``The new media law has turned into a widespread 
lynching of journalists,'' Djogovic said. On Monday, two Serbian independent 
daily newspapers, Nasa Borba and Danas, which were briefly banned 
by the government earlier this month, stopped publishing in protest 
after police raided the office of another non-government newspaper, 
confiscated property and fined the paper for alleged anti-state activity. 
Independent B 92 radio reported Wednesday moves against Glas Javnosti, 
for allegedly slandering a state official in an article. B 92 also 
said the director of independent Radio Index faces charges for broadcasting 
despite a government ban. On Monday, 17th graf pvs
