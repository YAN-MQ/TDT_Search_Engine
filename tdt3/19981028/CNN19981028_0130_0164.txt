NatO is keeping 400 warplanes at the ready, in case Yugoslavia reneges 
on its international agreements concerning the province of Kosovo. 
Tuesday's deadline passed without air strikes, after NATO determined 
President Slobodan Milosevic was in partial compliance. NAto says 
it appears Milosevic has reduced troop levels to what they were before 
the current crisis began. President Clinton says Tuesday's developments 
bode well for the future. I'm very encouraged that NATO's persistence 
and resolve have compelled President Milosevic to pull back his forces 
and comply very substantially with the demands of the international 
community. Hopefully, now the climate of fear and intimidation can 
be lifted and kosovar Albanians can return to their villages. And 
more importantly, over the long run, that negotiations toward a durable 
and peaceful resolutions can move forward. President Clinton says 
about 40,000 refugees from Kosovo have begun returning home. About 
300,000 ethnic Albanians have been driven from the province since 
the serb crackdown began in February.
