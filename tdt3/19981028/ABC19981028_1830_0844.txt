In London, the case against Pinochet took a startling turn into his 
favor today. He's protected from prosecution and should not have been 
arrested, although for now he will remain in custody. It is not clear 
yet when this means for the Spanish judge and others, including Americans, 
who want Pinochet to face charges of war crimes. ABC's Sheila MacVicar 
has the latest from London tonight. The ruling infuriated people who 
had hoped to see the general on trial. Britain's high court said general 
Pinochet "is entitled, as a former head of state, to immunity from 
civil and criminal proceedings of the English court." You can kill. 
You can commit genocide. You can torture. You can do whatever you 
want, as long as you declare yourself head of state. We can have Saddam 
Hussein here next week, and we won't be able to touch him under British 
law. That's clearly crazy. General Pinochet seized power in 1973 in 
a coup that was backed by the CIA. His forces turned this soccer stadium 
into a killing ground. Thousands of his political opponents were murdered 
here and tens of thousands were tortured. The U.S. supported general 
Pinochet until 1976, when his terrorism came to america. Pinochet's 
agents detonated a car bomb in Washington that killed a Political 
enemy and an American assistant. In the last week, several congressmen 
had urged the Clinton administration to declassify more documents, 
to aid in the case against the general. If this court ruling is allowed 
to stand, it's a travesty for human rights. There will be an appeal. 
And other European countries have said that if they get their hands 
on the general, they would put him on trial. But the thinking tonight 
is that he may soon be on his way home. Sheila MacVicar, ABC News, 
London.
