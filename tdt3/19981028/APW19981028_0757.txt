Germany's retirement age may be lowered in an effort to create new 
jobs for young people and beat chronic high unemployment, its new 
labor minister said Wednesday. Faced with whopping joblessness of 
10.3 percent, new labor minister Walter Riester said it was an ``urgent 
goal'' of a proposed jobs creation plan to work towards lowering the 
official retirement age of 65, though he did not mention a lower age. 
The president of Germany's Federation of Trade Unions, Dieter Schulte, 
was quoted in Bild newspaper as saying that lowering the retirement 
age to 60 could cut unemployment by 1.5 million over the medium-term. 
Nearly 4 million people are unemployed in Germany. Unemployment is 
the country's hottest political issue. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's 
Social Democrat-Greens coalition government wants to set up a jobs 
alliance of industry, workers and government to brainstorm on jobs 
creation. Industry leaders have recently doubted the alliance would 
succeed, pointing to high wage increases unions are looking for in 
1999. But in a positive signal, the president of the German Industry 
and Trade Congress, Hans-Peter Stihl, said Wednesday his powerful 
group would join the alliance. However Stihl said new taxes proposed 
so far wouldn't help create jobs.
