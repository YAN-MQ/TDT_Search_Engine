It's Wednesday, October 28th. I'm Tony Conn. Today, less truth and 
even less reconciliation in South Africa. The Truth Commission goes 
to court. The Land for Peace deal stumbles in the Middle East, and 
a Cuban American actress performs in the homeland of her parents. 
Their memories of it are not necessarily of the current Cuba. I called 
my mother the first night. I said, "Mom it's so beautiful." And she 
said, "yes, it is." And so is the Hispanic consumer to Madison Ave. 
We'll hear why later this hour. First, this news.
