In a move to strengthen its holdings of postwar works, the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art has bought ``White Flag,'' its first painting by Jasper 
Johns, the museum announced Wednesday. The 1955 painting is the second 
in a series that the artist based on the American flag. Measuring 
6{ by 10 feet, it is also the largest of the flag paintings and his 
first monochrome of the image. For the Met, which has drawn criticism 
for not always choosing the best examples of postwar art, the acquisition 
is a big step, both in financial commitment and in terms of the history 
of its collecting. The museum already owns 52 prints and a drawing 
by Johns. ``It fills a cruel gap with an authentic masterpiece,'' 
said Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director, calling the painting 
``as good as they come.'' While he refused to say what the Met paid 
for ``White Flag,'' experts estimate its value at more than $20 million. 
Many consider it the artist's finest painting. The acquisition was 
announced days after a windfall of two important van Gogh drawings 
received as a bequest of philanthropist Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. 
Mrs. Rockefeller, who died in 1948 and was a founder of the Museum 
of Modern Art, initially gave the drawings to the Modern. But she 
stipulated that they would no longer be considered modern after 50 
years and should then go to the Met, a museum she perceived as devoted 
to older art. (Two drawings by Seurat, also part of her bequest to 
the Modern, were sent to the Art Institute of Chicago.) The Johns 
painting was bought directly from the artist, who had steadfastly 
refused offers from collectors and other institutions. ``They approached 
me, and I thought the Met was the right place for it,'' Johns said 
in a telephone interview. ``White Flag'' has been widely exhibited, 
and over the years it has been lent for long periods to the Yale University 
Art Gallery, the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen in Duesseldorf, 
Germany, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington. ``The painting 
is only 44 years old, and it's already an icon,'' said William Lieberman, 
chairman of the Met's department of 20th-century art. In honor of 
the acquisition, Lieberman delivered what might be called a ``matched'' 
gift. He has promised the museum ``Flag,'' a 11~-by-16}-inch white 
oil painting on brown paper mounted on board that the artist made 
in 1957, two years after ``White Flag.'' In 1958, while Lieberman 
was a young curator at the Museum of Modern Art, he persuaded his 
mother to buy ``Flag'' when it was available through the Modern's 
Art Lending Service (which also sold works of art). It is in pristine 
condition, Lieberman said, because his mother ulimately decided she 
did not like it and kept it in a trunk. This small ``Flag'' is an 
example of how Johns likes to repeat an image in another medium. The 
far larger ``White Flag'' was painted on three separately stretched 
panels of fabric: one, on the upper left side of the painting, showing 
48 stars; a second, the seven upper stripes, and the third, six longer 
stripes below that. Johns worked on each panel separately in his signature 
surface, encaustic, an ancient technique involving pigment suspended 
in melted wax that he is frequently credited with reviving. The material 
sets rapidly and allows every brush stroke to remain distinct. ``White 
Flag'' was made in layers. Johns outlined the flag design in charcoal, 
then put down a ground of unpigmented molten beeswax. Next he dipped 
collage elements like bits of newsprint, other pieces of paper and 
scraps of fabric in more beeswax and stuck them to the canvas. After 
joining the three panels at the back, he painted the surface with 
short strokes of more wax pigmented with shades of white and added 
touches of oil paint. ``By draining most color from the flag but leaving 
subtle gradations in tone,'' said Nan Rosenthal, a curator in the 
Met's department of 20th-century art, ``the artist shifted the emphasis 
from the flag image to the very subject of the way that he painted 
it with short, distinct gestures.'' Ms. Rosenthal, who organized a 
retrospective of Johns' drawings in 1990 when she was the curator 
of 20th-century art at the National Gallery of Art, brokered the purchase 
for the Met, people close to the discussions said. Like most such 
negotiations, it took years. ``We had been waiting for the right Johns,'' 
said de Montebello, who visited Johns in his Connecticut studio to 
persuade him to sell the painting to the Met. With the artist's red, 
white and blue ``Flag'' (1954-1955) in the collection of the Museum 
of Modern Art, and the superimposed ``Three Flags'' from 1958 at the 
Whitney Museum of American Art, three major New York museums now own 
examples of Johns' early flag paintings. From the Met's perspective, 
its strong holdings in Abstract Expressionist paintings provide an 
excellent context for this early work by Johns. But the museum still 
has other holes to fill in the area of second-generation post-war 
art. The Met has no paintings by Robert Rauschenberg, for example. 
The Met has wasted no time in putting ``White Flag'' on view. The 
painting has just been hung in the museum's 20th-century galleries, 
marking an anniversary of sorts: it is exactly 40 years since ``White 
Flag'' was first exhibited. The occasion was Johns' first one-man 
show, at Leo Castelli's gallery, which was then on the Upper East 
Side. ``This was one of two paintings that didn't sell,'' Johns said. 
``The other was a target painting. Since Leo wanted the target, I 
kept the `White Flag.'''
