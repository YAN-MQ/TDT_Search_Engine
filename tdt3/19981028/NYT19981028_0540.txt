As expected, the Mets announced Wednesday that they had officially 
come to terms with their ace left-hander, Al Leiter, on a four-year, 
$32 million contract. The deal, with an accompanying news conference 
with Leiter, came two days after the Mets announced a seven-year, 
$91 million agreement with All-Star catcher Mike Piazza. Thus, the 
Mets were able to keep their best pitcher, and best everyday player, 
from going elsewhere. And having done that, General Manager Steve 
Phillips will now turn his attention to the free agents who might 
look good in a Mets uniform in 1999. Phillips will be armed with what 
one lawyer affiliated with baseball said would be a $65 million budget 
next season, a significant increase over the $57 million payroll the 
Mets had in 1998, which turned out to be the sixth-highest figure 
in the league. If the $65 million figure is accurate _ and the lawyer 
said the Mets' co-owners Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday had signed 
off on it _ it would appear that Phillips will have the ability to 
go after at least one major free agent in an effort to get the Mets 
into the post-season. And the priority will be offense, Phillips said 
Wednesday. ``It doesn't take a baseball genius to see that we scratched 
and clawed to score runs last season,'' the 33-year-old Leiter, who 
went 17-6 with a 2.47 ERA, said at Shea Stadium. ``Clearly, we need 
some more thump. Last year, we didn't have enough of what I call that 
fear factor in our lineup. But we're not that far away.'' Phillips 
has indicated that the areas he is looking at are left and right field 
and either second or third base, with Edgardo Alfonzo either staying 
at third or moving over to second depending on what the Mets do. The 
Mets could address their outfield and infield needs in one fell swoop 
if they are able to swing a rumored deal with the Dodgers for a former 
Met, outfielder Bobby Bonilla, and second baseman Eric Young, who 
would also become the leadoff hitter the Mets lack. Phillips has also 
spoken to the agents who represent such intriguing free agents as 
Brian Jordan, Albert Belle and Ellis Burks. Phillips is not allowed 
to actually make a money offer for any free agent until Nov. 6. But 
it is likely that the Mets will make a strong run at the 31-year-old 
Jordan, who hit .316 with 25 homers and 91 RBIs for the Cardinals 
last season. Another free agent who reportedly interests the Mets 
is 31-year-old Robin Ventura, who hit .263 for the Chicago White Sox 
last season with 21 homers and 91 RBIs. Phillips said Wednesday that 
he thinks he will be able to fill his team's needs ``partly by trades, 
partly by the free-agent route.'' With a dozen players currently under 
contract, the Met payroll is already just short of $50 million. But 
Todd Hundley, who will earn $5.3 million next season, will almost 
certainly be traded. The Mets are also believed to be shopping their 
opening-day starter last season, Bobby Jones, which would give Phillips 
added flexibility to work with. Jones will earn $4.8 million next 
season. And the Mets might also be willing to part with outfielder 
Butch Huskey, who is eligible for arbitration. What the Mets are doing 
now, Doubleday said, is much different than their failed strategy 
of shopping for big-name free agents (like Bonilla) in the early 1990s. 
``We didn't have a plan then,'' Doubleday said. ``We have a plan now. 
And Steve knows exactly where we're trying to get to.'' But whatever 
the Mets do, they have already assured themselves that Leiter will 
be one of the anchors on a staff that was one of the better ones in 
baseball last season. Originally, the Mets offered Leiter a two-year 
deal with an option year for a third at under $6 million a season. 
Leiter said Wednesday that had the Mets not increased their offer 
to four years at about what he settled for (an average of $8 million 
a season), he would have tested the free-agent waters. But entertaining 
other offers was something that Leiter, who grew up in Berkeley Township 
in New Jersey, said he really did not want to do. ``I really think 
Steve did a really nice job,'' Leiter said of the negotiations. ``Everything 
was so easy. As I saw the way the year was going last season, I decided 
that this is a good place to play. This was so fitting. I came up 
with the Yankees. Four years out of high school, I started my first 
game at Yankee Stadium. After all the ups and downs that I have been 
through, to finish up my career not only in the same city but with 
the team I rooted for growing up, it's almost perfect.''
