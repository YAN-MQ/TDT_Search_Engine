Salvage crews are searching a new swath of the Mediterranean for the 
lost plane of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, after a fisherman found his 
bracelet near Marseille, officials said Wednesday. The author of ``The 
Little Prince'' mysteriously vanished in his warplane while flying 
near the French coast on July 31, 1944, as the Allies were pushing 
Nazi troops through Provence. Repeated searches near Nice failed to 
turn up Saint-Ex's Lockheed P-38 Lightning, and theories have ranged 
from hostile gunfire to mechanical problems to suicide. But late last 
month, fisherman Jean-Claude Bianco found the author's silver chain 
bracelet in near-perfect condition off the coast of Marseille, 190 
kms (115 miles) due west, while looking for sole and mullet in a rocky 
inlet near the Planier lighthouse. Entwined in seaweed and sand, the 
bracelet was also stuck to a piece of fabric believed to be that of 
Saint-Exupery's flight suit. The bracelet was authenticated, since 
it carried the name of Saint-Exupery's wife Consuelo and the names 
Reynal and Hitchcock, publishers of The Little Prince. Two days later, 
on Sept. 28, the marine salvage company Comex launched a two-month 
search. The Minbibiex and the Remora 2000, two mini-submarines, were 
combing an area of up to 100 square kilometers (38 square miles) around 
where Bianco found the bracelet, said Comex chief Henri-Germain Deloze. 
Several pieces of plane wreckage were located by sonar, but so far 
nothing was found that confirmed they found the P-38, Henri-Germain 
said. But Henri-Germain said he was still convinced Saint-Exupery 
crashed near Marseille after taking off from Bastia-Borgo Airport 
on the island of Corsica, shortly before 9 a.m. on July 31, 1944. 
If Saint-Exupery did crash near Marseille, it appeared unlikely he 
was hit by German gunfire, since the Germans had been chased out of 
the region by then, expert Patrick Ehrhardt told the regional daily 
La Provence.
