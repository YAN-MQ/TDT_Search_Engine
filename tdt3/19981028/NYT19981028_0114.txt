The Energy Department will take delivery Wednesday of what the government 
says is the world's fastest computer, capable of a peak performance 
of 3.88 trillion calculations, or teraflops, a second. Clinton administration 
officials said Tuesday that the supercomputer, which is being assembled 
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, is about 
15,000 times faster than a 350-megahertz personal computer. The computer, 
built by the IBM, uses 5,800 processor chips, each slightly more powerful 
than the widely sold Pentium II chip made by Intel Corp., said people 
involved in its development. Livermore, a nuclear weapons lab, will 
use it for simulations that determine, without detonation, whether 
aging nuclear weapons are still operable. In remarks prepared for 
delivery Wednesday, Vice President Al Gore says that beyond weapons 
research, the technology of the computer, known as massively parallel 
architecture, ``will lead to advances and greater understanding of 
weather patterns, global climate change, medicine, manufacturing and 
aviation safety.'' For the Energy Department, the computer, called 
Pacific Blue, is part of a program to advance supercomputer technology 
rapidly to the stage where it can model nuclear warheads. Pacific 
Blue takes the speed title from Sandia Red, a computer at Sandia National 
Laboratory built by Intel that was finished in December 1996 and is 
about half as fast. Mountain Blue, a computer being built by Silicon 
Graphics Inc., is expected to deliver about four teraflops. By mid-2000, 
Energy Department officials hope to have a 10-teraflop computer, also 
built by IBM, running at Livermore, followed in 2004 by a 100-teraflop 
computer. The 100-teraflop model would allow high-fidelity simulation 
of an H-bomb detonation, as a volleyball-size mass of nuclear fuel 
is compressed to the size of a walnut, setting off the explosive chain 
reaction. Administration officials said they were trying to retire 
Moore's Law, which holds that chip makers will be able to double the 
number of transistors on a given sliver of silicon, and thus its speed, 
every 18 months. The Energy Department wants to triple computing speed 
in about the same time frame by combining the power of many processors 
instead of increasing the speed of each. Nicholas Donofrio, senior 
vice president for technology and manufacturing at IBM, said that 
in building Pacific Blue, ``we pretty much used commercial-grade stuff'' 
from the IBM. commercial product line. NYT-10-28-98 0058EST
