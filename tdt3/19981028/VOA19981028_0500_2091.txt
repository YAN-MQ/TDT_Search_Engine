Russian President Boris Yeltsin has been admitted to a suburban Moscow 
sanitarium for treatment of fatigue and blood pressure problems. VOA's 
Peter Hyline reports he's uncertain he'll stay there. President Yeltsin 
moved from his country residence outside Moscow to a nearby sanitarium 
Tuesday to rest. A Kremlin spokesman said the length of his stay at 
the well-equipped medical facility would depend on how quickly he 
responds to treatment. Monday, the 67-year-old Mr. Yeltsin canceled 
a planned trip to Vienna after doctors said he was suffering from 
extreme fatigue and erratic blood pressure. Prime Minister Yavgeney 
Primakov made the trip in his place. Television newscasts showed the 
two men meeting Tuesday before the Russian leader checked into the 
sanitarium. The brief, silent video clip showed a haggard-looking 
Mr. Yeltsin seated at a table. Two weeks ago the Russian leader was 
forced to cut short a visit to central Asia because of what was described 
as bronchitis. Television pictures showed him staggering during a 
welcome ceremony in Uzbekistan. The Russian President's recurring 
health problems have again prompted moves by potential presidential 
candidates to solidify their positions. Moscow Mayor Yuri Lushkov, 
seen as a prime contender in the next elections, stepped up his campaign 
this week, calling for a creation of a centrist block that would back 
him. Another presidential hopeful, Communist Party Chief Gannadey 
Zuganov, held a news conference Tuesday to repeat his call for Mr. 
Yeltsin's immediate resignation. Mr. Zuganov said, "To us, it is obvious 
he is incapacitated. He hasn't worked since the beginning of his second 
term. The Communist leader said Mr. Yeltsin's refusal to step down 
is torturing Russia and urged Parliament to consider urgent measures 
to, in his words, "restore control.' But President Yeltsin has served 
notice that, despite his obvious infirmity, he intends to stay in 
office until the end of his term, which is less than two years away. 
Even his critics admit Russia has achieved a degree of stability since 
Prime Minister Primakov was appointed last month. Peter Hyline, VOA 
News, Moscow.
