Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." With its regular season 
scheduled to begin next week, the NBA canceled another two weeks worth 
of games today, wiping out the entire November schedule. The cancellations 
came after the owners and players resumed labor talks. We have some 
basic differences, and that's the problem. If we can lay some common 
ground, hopefully, we can get some thing done. But, I think it was 
a positive thing that we did get together and at least be able to 
hear and see for ourselves what, you know, their stance with was. 
I don't think that NBC, TNT -- that they are going to stand by and 
let there not be a season. I mean, I don't think I have to close myself 
-- close my eyes to that. You know, Ray Charles can see that one.
