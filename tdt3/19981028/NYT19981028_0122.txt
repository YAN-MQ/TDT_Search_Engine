If Scott Kurnit, the founder and chief executive of the Mining Co., 
ever finds himself feeling insignificant or questioning his new business 
endeavor, he can bolster his self-esteem by catching the F train from 
his offices in midtown Manhattan to SoHo and there gaze upon his company's 
latest marketing effort: a giant mural on a building on Houston Street 
near Broadway touting ``miningco.com.'' Cater-cornered to the famous 
DKNY ad, the mural is just one piece of evidence that New York companies 
like his that deal with Internet-related media are beginning to understand 
the need to promote their online brands in the off-line world. The 
Mining Co., an Internet search engine that offers personal guides 
to Web sites, joins such other companies as iVillage, N2K, theglobe.com 
and Connecticut-based priceline.com that have recently undertaken 
national advertising blitzes _ broadcast, cable TV, outdoor and print 
_ intended to make their brands household names, the likes of ESPN 
or (dare they wish) Coca-Cola. Not one of these companies existed 
five years ago. Nor did their industry. Now, iVillage advertises its 
Women's Network on several cable TV channels. N2K, which agreed last 
week to merge with its biggest competitor, CDNow, has its own huge 
billboards in Times Square and on Sunset Strip in Hollywood for its 
Web-based retail business, Music Boulevard. It also introduced a broadcast, 
cable and radio campaign during the Grammy Awards show this year. 
Theglobe.com invested $8 million to plaster its logo on everything 
from bus stops to cable to the T-shirt of a waiter in SoHo at the 
trendy Jerry's restaurant, a popular lunch spot for Silicon Alley 
denizens. All these companies have established a presence on the World 
Wide Web through banner advertising and strategic relationships with 
other sites. But to build the critical mass they have promised their 
investors _ and in the case of N2K, its shareholders _ they must have 
a presence in the nonvirtual world, too. Survival demands that they 
drive traffic to their Web sites to increase ``viewer impressions,'' 
the count of how many times the pages on a site are seen. For now, 
the Mining Co., iVillage and theglobe.com are focusing most of their 
advertising dollars on markets with a ``wired'' population, primarily 
New York, San Francisco, Boston and Seattle. Priceline.com, an airline 
ticket broker in Stamford, Conn., has taken a more ambitious and focused 
approach. Eschewing TV and online advertising, the 6-month-old company 
has spent $20 million to buy national radio spots featuring William 
Shatner and full-page ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal 
and USA Today. ``We want people to know about us before they get on 
line,'' said Jay Walker, priceline.com's founder and chief executive. 
To Walker, radio and newspapers are the most efficient media for his 
particular brand because ``you don't need a lot of pictures or motion 
to convey'' his company's simple message, that ``as long as you're 
flexible, you can name your price on an airline ticket, a car or, 
shortly, a hotel room.'' James Dettore, chief executive of Brand Institute, 
a New York consulting firm, says the cost of creating an online brand 
for Internet companies is inherently cheaper than creating a brand 
for, say, cookies. ``Generally, companies will spend 8 to 10 percent 
of their budget on marketing,'' Dettore said. But he contends that 
Internet companies have two advantages over others: The medium is 
global, and it is fast. ``Historically, it takes 15 to 20 years to 
establish a megabrand,'' Dettore said. ``The software industry _ Microsoft, 
Dell and Gateway _ accelerated this to three to five years. And Internet 
brands are growing even faster.'' Even so, he says, building a national 
brand is expensive, costing ``anywhere from $50 million to $100 million.'' 
The challenge is finding an efficient way to allocate limited resources. 
iVillage has raised some $67 million in capital _ an impressive amount 
but not nearly enough to cover the cost of building the brand, developing 
the product and meeting payroll. The Mining Co. has raised about $20 
million, as has theglobe.com, which filed for a public offering in 
July. Priceline.com has raised $52 million, and N2K has raised more 
than $160 million through two public offerings and private financing. 
Internet companies often find it hard to accept the vague, imprecise 
measurements of a campaign's effectiveness in traditional media. Debbie 
Newman, N2K's vice president for marketing, advertising and sales, 
describes the frustration of assigning a value to a brand's image 
_ and of conveying that value to her bosses. ``The Internet has become 
a response-based, customer acquisition buy,'' she said. ``It's become 
pretty scientific. We can count how many customers we acquired for 
every banner we place.'' In contrast, she said, ``The off-line advertising 
is more intangible, but it builds confidence and trust in our virtual 
brand.'' As of last week, Ms. Newman has larger, equally intangible, 
problems to worry about. With the N2K-CDNow merger, the brand she 
has worked so hard to create may become obsolete if the management 
of the newly formed company deems CDNow, or an entirely new name, 
more valuable than N2K or its Music Boulevard. Jon Diamond, co-founder 
of N2K and chairman of the new company, said Friday: ``We have agreed 
to a process to work with senior management and consultants to assess 
our brand equities and a third brand. We'll continue to market our 
respective services through the holiday season.'' If all goes as planned, 
the merger will be complete in January and the new name _ and new 
branding campaign _ will be announced soon thereafter. Back down in 
SoHo, Kurnit of the Mining Co. has issues of his own. Just days after 
the paint dried on his mural, the gasoline station in front of the 
building where it resides sold its air rights to a billboard company. 
Now, a cigarette ad blocks a part of the Mining Co.'s mural _ and 
perhaps its chance to make a fleeting impression amid the noise. NYT-10-25-98
