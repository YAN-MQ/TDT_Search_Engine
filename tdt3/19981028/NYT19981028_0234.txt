In a preservation move both bold and unprecedented, the entire New 
York City subway system will be nominated to the National Register 
of Historic Places _ highlighting 48 of its stations, 11 substations, 
6 signal towers, 4 control houses, 3 yard buildings and 1 tunnel, 
state officials confirmed Wednesday. ``We'll nominate everything but 
the screech,'' said J. Winthrop Aldrich, deputy commissioner for historic 
preservation at the State Parks Office. The State Parks Office now 
has all the research it needs to complete the nomination, including 
a six-volume survey commissioned by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority, which initiated the nomination process. State Parks Commissioner 
Bernadette Castro said Wednesday that the subway is ``so New York.'' 
She continued: ``It never shuts down, 24 hours a day. We can't really 
function without it.'' Ms. Castro said she knew of no opposition to 
the National Register listing, which would make the city's subway 
system eligible for state preservation grants and, she added, would 
``definitely'' increase its chances for a bigger slice of the $203 
billion in federal transportation dollars allotted by Congress in 
June. It would be the first complete subway system listed on the register, 
said a spokesman for the National Register of Historic Places, in 
Washington. Kent Barwick, who once ran both the Municipal Art Society 
and the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission, said that the 
proposed nomination was ``astounding'' and that ``we've come a long 
way since the attitude of the city government was that the subways 
were an embarrassment.'' The honor would be ``appropriate,'' he continued, 
because the subway system ``made the modern city what it is. By expanding 
to the `wilds' of Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx, it made the city 
grow.'' Once the system is listed, Ms. Castro said, she hopes the 
MTA will target ``four or five'' more stations for restoration. She 
said she would look favorably toward awarding a state grant for ``interpretation'' 
at these stations: new artwork and text to educate riders about the 
history of the subways. While not the oldest subway system _ Boston 
has that honor _ New York's system, which on Tuesday celebrated its 
94th birthday, is certainly the biggest in the country, and possibly 
the world, said John Tauranac, a subway expert and urban historian, 
who designed the 1979 subway map. ``Tokyo may have more riders,'' 
he said, ``but New York's 722 miles certainly give it the edge, lengthwise.'' 
As a fragment of history, it has no peer. Not only does New York City 
still have the only complete system of local and express tracks, but 
its mosaic tiles and bas reliefs by American master potteries Grueby 
and Rookwood are extraordinary. Preservationists still bemoan Philip 
Johnson's makeover of the 49th Street station, blanketed with shiny 
orange tiles in 1975. ``Cheer is the word, like a big shopping center,'' 
Johnson announced at the time. Or the demolition of the Bowling Green 
station starting in 1972, when huge red tiles replaced elegant mosaic 
name panels and neo-classical designs by Heins and LaFarge, who designed 
the 1904 and 1908 subway projects (along with part of the Cathedral 
of St. John the Divine). Or the alterations to the Broadway and 103rd 
Street station, where classic white glazed brick-shaped tiles and 
at least one terra cotta escutcheon were covered by what Tauranac 
called ``penal-colony modern'' beige walls. Or the destruction of 
almost all the distinctive above-ground kiosks, carted away in the 
1960s, ostensibly because they blocked the sight lines of traffic. 
``The real reason,'' Tauranac said, ``is because they'd been neglected. 
The cast iron and glass were leaking.'' A much-applauded reproduction 
kiosk was erected with financing from Brooke Astor at the Astor Place 
station as part of a major renovation in 1986. But for every Astor 
Place, Barwick said, ``there are four more stations that need work.'' 
Bleecker Street, his home station, is ``almost as beautiful as Astor 
Place _ and it could sure use a little sprucing up.'' Other preservationists 
grumble that Gov. George Pataki has only recently emerged as a ``Born 
Again Subway Rider.'' When he took office, he slashed $220 million 
from MTA subsidies while increasing money to other transit systems 
across the state, including Metro North and the Long Island Railroad. 
The recent fare discount packages _ along with his boyhood reminiscences 
of riding the IRT _ are brand new. Generally speaking, listing on 
the National Register of Historic Places is an honor that carries 
little regulatory weight _ privately owned houses can be demolished 
without much of a fight. But because the subways are owned by the 
MTA, a governmental body, the listing would carry much more clout. 
Before any alterations or demolition could be carried out on any of 
the historic parts of the subway, an extensive review by the State 
Parks Office would be mandated, Ms. Castro said. In this case, no 
one is expecting trouble with the MTA, which not only backs the listing, 
but has also been consulting with the state about ongoing changes 
to historic subway resources. A spokesman said MTA Chairman E. Virgil 
Conway would not comment. To Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for 
the Straphangers Campaign, a transit riders' lobbying group, the National 
Register status could change the way New Yorkers think of the subway. 
``When it was built in 1904,'' he said, ``the tiles served not only 
to beautify but to all the New Yorkers who spoke no English, they 
showed the way: the beaver at Astor Place, the City Hall at City Hall, 
Columbus' ship. They couldn't read the writing on the wall but they 
could see the pictures.'' In the past, Russianoff has been critical 
of the MTA. ``Its program to rehabilitate 91 out of 468 stations is 
way behind schedule,'' he said. But the ones it has redone, are spectacular, 
he said, adding, ``At Brooklyn Bridge, they put in Art Deco glass 
blocks, some sort of cable sculpture and an old-fashioned kiosk.'' 
Having the subway listed on the National Register, Russianoff hopes, 
will ``create a mindset in both the public and the governments that 
subways are vital public spaces.'' There are two bureaucratic hurdles. 
The first is the state review board, which must go over the nomination 
_ this spring ``at the very earliest,'' Ms. Castro said, adding that 
she would like to use some of the federal transportation money to 
free up staff to push the nomination. The next step is the formal 
enrollment of the property onto the register, which officials said 
privately was a foregone conclusion. (All 151 register nominations 
forwarded by New York state from September 1996 to September 1997 
were accepted.) Frank Sanchis, vice president for historic sites at 
the National Trust, a private group that works closely with the National 
Parks Service and its 70,000 National Register listings, saw no obstacles 
to the proposed nomination. ``It fits right in with current preservation 
thinking,'' he said. Increasingly, he said, the register is recognizing 
infrastructure: ``historic roads, historic canal corridors.'' He continued: 
``New York's Croton Aqueduct is on the register. So it makes perfect 
sense.'' Sanchis also sits on the state review board that will pass 
on the parks office's nomination before it goes to Washington. There 
is no other subway system on the National Register, said Marilyn Harper, 
a historian for the National Parks Service, although there is a small 
segment of Boston's Tremont Street subway listed _ between State and 
Boylston Streets _ built in the 1890s. In Chicago, a 1978 effort to 
list a section of the elevated around the Loop failed.
