Colombia's President Andre Spastrata has met at the White House with 
President Clinton. Mr. Clinton pledged U.S. support for efforts to 
fight illegal drugs and bring peace to Colombia. After their talks, 
President Clinton spoke with reporters. Our hemisphere is increasingly 
working together for democracy and opportunity, for justice and human 
rights, for the peaceful resolution of conflicts. For Colombia, the 
insurgency looms over all other challenges today. There is terror 
and assassination, kidnapping, including the kidnapping of U.S. citizens, 
and other affronts to human rights. The narcotics trade and the civil 
conflict that fed off each other, as rebels and para-militaries do 
business with violent drug traffickers. However, we know peace can 
come -- even in the most difficult circumstances, if the will and 
the courage for peace is strong. President Spastrata has the will, 
the courage, and the support of his people to build peace. I welcome 
his efforts to open talks with insurgent groups. We stand ready to 
help. We hope the insurgents and para-militaries will seize this opportunity 
the president has offered them -- by ending terrorism and hostage 
talking and involvement with drug traffickers. The president and I 
have just signed a new "Alliance Against drugs" to intensify our joint 
efforts in education and prevention and law enforcement -- and extradition, 
eradication, economic development and again, in efforts to end civil 
conflict. All are essential to this fight. President Clinton speaking 
in the Rose Garden of the White House just a short while ago. U.S.-Colombian 
ties have improved markedly since Mr. Spastrata took office in August.
