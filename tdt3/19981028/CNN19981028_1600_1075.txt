Sprint is delaying a planned ipo for its wireless PCs unit due to 
unfavorable market conditions. The ipo by the number-three, long-distance 
provider was expected to raise $600 million. The move delays Sprint's 
plan to take ownership and management control of the PCs unit from 
its partners, telecommunications, Inc. And Comcast. Sprint says it 
still plans on going ahead with the stock offering in the future. 
Sprint shares lost 1 13/16.
