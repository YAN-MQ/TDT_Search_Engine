When we continue tonight from the cape, we'll be joined by one of 
the original seven. He's worked almost 40 years. She's worked almost 
40 years. And during that time they've gone on walks together instead 
of cruises. And shared secrets together instead of champagne. Just 
so that someday they could retire and be together all the time. At 
Cigna we care about the retirement dreams of over five million people. 
After all, they're our dreams, too. Cigna.
