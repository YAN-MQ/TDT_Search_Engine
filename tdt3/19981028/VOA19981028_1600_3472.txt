The Space Shuttle Discovery is being readied for Thursday's blastoff, 
which will return famed astronaut John Glenn to orbit for the first 
time in 36 years. And I can remember when he took the first one. That 
shows you how old I am. Mr. Glenn and his six-member international 
crew are reviewing launch procedures and plan several inspections 
of the space craft. The astronauts include Spaniard Pedro Duke and 
Japan's Chieeki Mukai. Meanwhile, technicians are loading the Shuttle 
with scientific experiments and other supplies for the nine-day research 
mission. Mr. Glenn, a 77-year-old retiring Senator, became the first 
American to orbit the earth. President Clinton will be among scores 
of officials at the launch site to witness the lift-off. Thousands 
of well-wishers have already jammed the Cap Canaveral area, creating 
the air of anticipation and excitement not seen since NASA's lunar 
missions nearly three decades ago. Forecasters are predicting you 
perfect weather for Thursday's launch. Hurricane Mitch, the Western 
Caribbean storm once thought to pose a threat to the launch, is not 
expected to affect the blastoff at all.
