New U.S. soccer coach Bruce Arena has wasted no time in making good 
on his promise to immediately rebuild the U.S. national team. Arena 
has picked nine first-time players for his roster for the American's 
friendly match November 6 against Australia in San Jose, California. 
Coach Arena says he knows he'll have to make some hard choices in 
the coming years. I do realize that there'll bee a bit of a struggle 
ahead. Because I believe the objective of the program is certainly 
to advance in 2002 and be in Japan for the World Cup and be among 
the final thirty-two. That is certainly our goal to start. Now, all 
22 players selected for this first friendly under coach Arena are 
from U.S. major league soccer teams. Only three are over age 30, and 
only five were members of the U.S. World Cup team in France. We spoke 
to Bruce Arena today and he said he's not calling up some of the veteran 
players who are playing professional for their clubs in Europe because 
the logistics would be just too difficult -- having them fly all the 
way across Europe and all the way across the ocean and all the way 
across to the west coast. So he's giving some younger players an opportunity 
this time.
