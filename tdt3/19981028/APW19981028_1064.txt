Jean-Claude Bianco was fishing in a rocky inlet for sole and mullet 
when he netted a bracelet that could solve one of France's biggest 
aviation mysteries: the crash that killed author Antoine de Saint-Exupery, 
``I told myself, `You're dreaming, you're dreaming.' The sea is vast, 
and the bracelet was so small,'' Bianco said of the moment he scraped 
at the silver chain bracelet to find the names of the author's wife 
and publishers. After his Sept. 26 discovery, marine salvage crews 
began a new search in the Mediterranean for the remains of the plane's 
wreckage _ this time armed with a vital clue. ``This discovery makes 
me think that the plane isn't very far away,'' Henri-Germain Delauze, 
head of the COMEX salvage crew told a news conference Wednesday. He 
said he was ``convinced'' that steel parts since discovered nearby 
were part of the wreckage. The 44-year-old author of ``The Little 
Prince'' mysteriously vanished in his warplane while flying near the 
French coast after taking off from Bastia-Borgo Airport on the island 
of Corsica on July 31, 1944. Repeated searches near Nice failed to 
turn up Saint-Ex's Lockheed P-38 Lightning, and theories have ranged 
from hostile gunfire to mechanical problems to suicide during the 
Allied mission he was flying against the Nazis. The Minbibiex and 
the Remora 2000, two mini-submarines, were combing an area of up to 
100 square kilometers (38 square miles) around where Bianco found 
the bracelet. The operation is expected to take two months, at a cost 
of some 50,000 francs (dlrs 8,300) per day. The bracelet, in almost-perfect 
condition, was slightly rusty, entwined in seaweed and sand, and stuck 
to a piece of fabric believed to be that of Saint-Exupery's flight 
suit. It was found 190 kms (115 miles) due west of the Marseille coast. 
It carried the name of the author's Argentine wife, Consuelo, and 
the names Reynal and Hitchcock, publishers of The Little Prince. ``My 
assistant was trying to sort out the fish and said `Hey, there's a 
bracelet' ... and I put it in my pocket and continued to work,'' Bianco 
told reporters. Several pieces of apparent plane wreckage already 
have been located by sonar. The waters where the search is being carried 
out vary in depth between 300 and 600 meters (360 and 720 yards). 
Delauze said his only concern was that the plane may have fallen in 
waters near the Planier lighthouse with a depth of up to 2,700 meters 
_ beyond the scope of their instruments. ``The job's only just begun,'' 
he said. ``It's not just exciting from a scientific point of view, 
it's also very moving because this is a myth we feel we're searching 
for.''
