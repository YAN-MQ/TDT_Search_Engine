Looks like hurricane Mitch will not threaten tomorrow's launch of 
the space shuttle "discovery." "Discovery" seven crew members are 
making their final presentations today. That's creating a lot of excitement 
as 77-year-old John Glenn gets ready to return to space. President 
Clinton plans to attend the launch. And people all over the world 
are celebrating the occasion. Glenn's daughter says she's glad the 
mission is attracting so much attention. On launch day, I want to 
go slowly, take deep breaths to truly experience each moment, and 
to, to savor it. My hope is that dad won't do this again. And, so, 
this, for me is definitely a once in a lifetime experience, as it 
is, I think, for him. And I want to live it as richly as I can, and 
remember it. "Discovery's" crew is under medical qaurnt teen, but 
they'll get to meet with their families one more time before tomorrow's 
launch.
