Time for a look at the weather across the country. From that from 
Florida we go to WNBC and meteorologist Janice huff. my. I wish I 
were there. You're going to have great weather. I'll give the forecast 
for the shuttle launch in a moment. We'll start out with hurricane 
Mitch. The storm continues to weaken. That's the only good news because 
it's still sitting in the same areas pounding the northern coast of 
Honduras and the offshore islands nearby. The storm is located at 
16.3 north, 86 west near the island( S near honduras. The storm nearly 
stationary as it has been for the past two or three days. The winds 
are now down to 105 miles per hour, so it's approaching category 2 
status, but it's still raining heavy ill with a lot of wind in the 
same general areas and bands spiraling out across Mexico. Here's an 
enhanced satellite photograph. This takes into account the higher 
cloud tops which shows where there's the most convection and where 
the heavy thunderstorms are in these orange and red areas. As you 
can see in the eye is where the heaviest and most severe weather is 
occurring right now with strong and heavy sea surf and strong to severe 
thunderstorms and heavy rain and possible mudslides. They've seen 
damage to some of the offshore islands. Some of the outer bands of 
rain reaching the cayman islands. The tropical storm watch has been 
discontinued. The hurricane warning remains in effect from cancun 
all the way down to the nicaraguan coastline. Where is it going to 
go after today? It's hard to say. It's meandering. Its winds will 
blow.
