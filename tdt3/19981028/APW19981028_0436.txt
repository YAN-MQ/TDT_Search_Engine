Taiwan took delivery Wednesday of the last eight of the 60 Mirage 
jet fighters it ordered from France, the state-run news agency reported. 
The Mirage 2000-5s were unloaded from a French freighter at eastern 
Hualien port before being transported to a nearby air base, the report 
said. The Mirages were part of a major overhaul to replace Taiwan's 
aging World War II-era warplanes. Taiwan also has taken delivery of 
103 of the 150 F-16s it has ordered from the United States. Lockheed 
Martin Corp. has said it will deliver the remaining jets by October 
next year. With the deliveries, Taiwanese officials have said the 
island could stay about three years ahead of China in military aviation. 
China has bought advanced Su-27's from Russia. Taiwan has paid U.S. 
dlrs 12.7 billion for the F-16s and the Mirages, along with air-to-air 
missiles. The purchases drew strong protests from China, which opposes 
Western countries selling advanced weapons to Taiwan. Beijing considers 
Taiwan a renegade province to be reunified with the mainland by force 
if necessary.
