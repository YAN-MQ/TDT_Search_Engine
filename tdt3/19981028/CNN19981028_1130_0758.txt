To recommend a therapeutic shampoo, neutrogena T/Gel would come out 
#1. T/Gel works on all three... itchy, flaky scalp conditions. Neutrogena 
T/Gel: have babies. We care about companies that make steel and about 
companies that make bread. We care about life. And about all that 
makes life great or possible or just better. At Cigna we care because 
it is our business to care. But we also care because... well, we have 
babies, too. Man: nasty storm. Wet road. Looks pretty bad, huh? No 
problem. That's the beauty of Subaru all-wheel drive. The ultimate 
safety feature. Thanks, kid. See, it automatically transfers power 
from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip. And only Subaru 
puts it on every car they make. And that's no accident.
