Ninetieth-birthday concerts, when they happen at all, are usually 
retrospectives. Speculum Musicae's evening of Elliott Carter at the 
Miller Theater on Tuesday night was, on the other hand, a showcase 
for the new and the recent. Only the eminent Double Concerto (1961) 
and a brief song written 60 years ago looked very far into the past. 
The rest did not sound like old man's music. ``Shard'' sent David 
Starobin's solo guitar on a rhapsody of busy passage work, delicate 
harmonics and abrupt attacks. The five songs called ``Of Challenge 
and of Love'' were more like duets between voice and piano than song 
and accompaniment. Carter's linear style had little use for orderly 
metric schemes. John Hollander's poetry took the music where it would. 
Perhaps the most arresting music of the night was ``Luimen'' for six 
very different instruments. The mix of colors is striking, with sharp 
exchanges between trombone and trumpet and more genteel colleagues 
like the mandolin and vibraphone. There is a fastidiousness in Carter's 
ear for colors and the way he separates them one from another. The 
notes of a single horizontal line often fragment and pass from one 
instrument to the next; silences let in light. Perhaps this is why 
music so dense with diverse agendas can sound so clear. From the newest 
piece, ``Tempo e Tempi'' for soprano, violin, English horn and bass 
clarinet, come the words (in translation): ``There's not just one 
tempo: there are many strands/ that glide in parallel/ often in opposite 
directions and seldom intersect.'' How better to explain music busy 
with many inner lives: lines that function at their own pace according 
to their own rules and personalities. Pieces like ``Luimen'' indicate 
that Carter at 90 is finding better ways to render this intense volume 
of information intelligible. If the evening had a contrasting tone, 
it was the Double Concerto _ piano and harpsichord, each with its 
own small band, clashing heatedly onstage. The gray militancy of this 
music, thick with martial drums and percussion, poses problems that 
the late chamber music seems to solve. That Carter has survived and 
prospered in an environment that, for the moment at least, has turned 
away from his austere, anti-tonal language is cause for celebration. 
Miller Theater, not very big to begin with, had empty seats, but what 
must have been heartening for the composer was the presence of young 
students, musicians and composers to mix with more venerable colleagues. 
This was not the place to put Elliott Carter in his proper niche. 
There will be time to decide whether his music shines ahead to the 
future, or whether it is more like a brilliant taillight receding 
down an increasingly unpopulated road. These dicta, moreover, will 
be different according to the era that makes them. As an example, 
Carter is a problem. Indeed, his remoteness from the public may have 
helped music down a blind alley from which it extricates itself with 
difficulty. As an individual, however, he is an acknowledged master. 
A host of players and the soprano Lucy Shelton, a fervent and accomplished 
Carterian, seemed to love their jobs Tuesday. And as long as good 
musicians feel the exhilaration of tackling Carter's complex problems, 
they will keep on playing his music. Aleck Karis was the evening's 
pianist. Chris Oldfather played the harpsichord in the Double Concerto. 
William Purvis faced a nightmarish conducting job with skill and courage.
