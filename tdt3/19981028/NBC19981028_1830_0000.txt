very tight security at the Kennedy space center. "In depth" tonight 
-- the women left behind. A top pilot who somehow never got to space. 
Also, annie Glenn, the senator's wife, the woman that has been there 
through it all. Hurricane Mitch in central America -- thousands run 
for cover. The Monica factor -- will it matter on election day? A 
new NBC poll tonight. Plus -- witness to history. My interview with 
Walter cronkite. broadcasting company, Inc.
