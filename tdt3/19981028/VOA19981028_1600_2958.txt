It's time now for business news. Breck Artery joins us now from New 
York for the latest from Wall Street. Breck, I guess the market started 
on the downside and then picked up a little bit of speed. It did, 
and we closed up the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending at 8,371. 
That was up almost six points. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed 
at a 1,068. That was up more than two-and-a-half points -- while the 
industrial average, which had been up more than 50 points, sold off 
in the last few minutes of trading. But other indexes maintained their 
gains. NASDAQ was up almost twenty.
