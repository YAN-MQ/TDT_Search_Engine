Federal anti-drug officials are urging voters not to legalize the 
medicinal use of marijuana in next week's elections. That proposition 
is on the ballot in four states and the district of columbia. Proponents 
say the drug can ease the pain for AIDS, cancer and terminally ill 
patients. Anti-drug officials argue smoking marijuana has not been 
tested by the government and has no concrete medical benefits.
