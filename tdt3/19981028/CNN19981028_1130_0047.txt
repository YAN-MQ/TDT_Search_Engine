President Clinton says there's a serious problem in minority communities, 
and he wants something done about it. He says AIDS is a severe and 
ongoing health care crisis among the groups. And today he's unveiling 
a $156 million program to prevent and treat the disease. Louise Schiavone 
takes a closer look at the problem. Do what you gotta do. Elsie Carter 
of Washington has had AIDS for three years. She's not sure if she 
was infected through intravenous drug use or prostitution. To be truthful, 
I didn't care. All I wanted was something that was gonna make me feel 
better than what I was feeling. And I was hurting a lot back then. 
Though the road to HIV is paved with intravenous drug use and unprotected 
sex, these issues have been taboo subjects in the african-American 
culture. We have a code of silence, and we just don't like to talk 
about those things. And the reality is, silence equals death. Leaders 
in the African-American community believe the rapid spread of AIDS 
among blacks has created a national health emergency. What is most 
striking about this whole situation is that every hour seven americans 
become infected with HIV. Three of those seven Americans are African-American. 
That's why political pressure has been brought to bear by the congressional 
black caucus, black doctors and others in the minority AIDS network. 
The figures contrast sharply with the 47% decline in AIDS deaths in 
the overall population last year. Leaders say access to health care 
may not be as big an issue as trust in the health system, sticking 
to a medical regimen and changing bad habits. They hope federal dollars 
for education, prevention and treatment will be part of the cure. 
Louise Schiavone, for CNN, Washington.
