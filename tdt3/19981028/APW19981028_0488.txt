A prominent liberal lawmaker on Wednesday claimed that Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet is just as prone to corruption as its predecessors, 
prompting a quick government threat to sue him for libel. Grigory 
Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko faction in parliament's lower house, 
said he continues to support Primakov but urged him to take quick 
action against lobbyists infesting his Cabinet. ``There are some people 
in the government who interest certain groups,'' Yavlinsky told reporters. 
``Some people have taken senior positions in the new government not 
because of their professional qualities, but because of their ability 
to fulfill certain orders'' _ as in orders from companies that want 
to curry favor with the government, he said. Yavlinsky singled out 
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, closely tied to Russia's 
military-industrial complex, and Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik, 
a defender of state farms. He wouldn't accuse either official of corruption 
directly or give any other names, saying he simply wants the public 
to be aware of the problem. ``I'm simply saying that there is such 
a danger,'' he said. ``It's my duty to draw attention to a problem 
that was all-embracing in the previous government.'' Yavlinsky was 
quoted Wednesday as making a similar statement in the British Daily 
Telegraph: ``Corruption can determine who gets what position. My people 
inside the government tell me you can buy offices for money.'' He 
gave no names. Yavlinsky, 46, is one of Russia's leading politicians 
and a presidential hopeful. He was the one who first suggested Primakov's 
candidacy for prime minister after the latest economic crisis hit 
in August, leading to the previous Cabinet's ouster. Yavlinsky's claims 
drew a quick response from Maslyukov's office, which called them ``malicious 
lies.'' Primakov's chief of staff Yury Zubakov said the prime minister 
is bent on eradicating corruption and called on Yavlinsky to provide 
proof of wrongdoing. ``Otherwise, everybody is put under a cloud,'' 
the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. Justice Minister Pavel 
Krasheninnikov also called on Yavlinsky to give specifics _ or face 
a possible lawsuit for libel. Yavlinsky hasn't abandoned Primakov 
altogether, however. ``We continue to support Primakov, who can ensure 
a relative stability in the country,'' Yavlinsky said. ``We are drawing 
Primakov's attention to those circumstances, and believe he would 
take certain steps to stop the process (of corruption).''
