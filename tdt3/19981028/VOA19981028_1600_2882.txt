Government and food industry scientists say they've come up with a 
new way to genetically engineer potatoes they hope will yield much 
better tasting spuds for baking and for processing into chips and 
fries. Plant physiologists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture have 
learned how to redesign a critical gene in the potato plant that normally 
produces bitter-tasting chemical compounds called glycoalcholoids. 
USDA researcher William Belknap explains that their redesigned potato 
gene acts like a biological switch. To turn off the production of 
the glycoalcholoids in the tubers, the part that people eat -- Researchers 
are planning to test the altered gene in several new varieties of 
potato being developed for the baking and processing markets. The 
commercial stakes are high. Baked, fried, or chipped, the potato is 
America's most popular vegetable. That's "Agriculture Briefs." I'm
