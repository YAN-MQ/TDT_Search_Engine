The U.S. government says 1997 was the safest year on the nation's 
highways. The national highway traffic safety administration says 
public safety campaigns helped lower the rate of highway fatalities. 
The study shows almost 42,000 people were killed in 1997. That equals 
a rate of 1.6 deaths per 100 million miles traveled. Fewer people 
have died in previous years, but last year's rate was the lowest because 
motorists drove more miles.
