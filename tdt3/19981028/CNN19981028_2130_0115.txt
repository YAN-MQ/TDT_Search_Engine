New drugs used to treat HIV have helped lower the AIDS death rate 
in the last two years. Now some researchers want to take some patients 
off those drugs completely. Elizabeth Cohen explains why. Taking a 
mixture, or so-called "cocktail," of drugs has, for many people, brought 
the level of the AIDS virus down to undetectable levels in the blood. 
But now, researchers at the national institutes of health are planning 
on asking 50 patients to go off the drugs completely. Doctors in Boston 
are doing a similar experiment. It's sort of hard to imagine, "why 
would I stop my medicine? If I'm doing okay and the virus is under 
control, why would I ever want to be in an experiment?" But these 
are not medicines that are just neutral. You get nasty side effects 
from these things. Not just nasty, often toxic. Side effects include 
-- plus, it's hard to take up to 40 pills a day. And at a high price 
tag -- $12,000-$20,000 a year. Some doctors have taken a different 
approach with these cocktail drugs. Instead of taking patients off 
them completely, they've just lowered the dose. Instead of taking 
all three drugs in the cocktail, participants in the study were assigned 
to take only one or two. The results, as many as one-fourth of patients 
saw their HIV levels go back up again. The research is published in 
the latest "New England journal of medicine." The nih doctors say 
the results, while disappointing, don't worry them. In their study, 
they'll insist that volunteers have undetectable levels of the virus 
for at least a year before going off the drugs, versus the three to 
six month period in "the New England journal" studies. You very likely 
have to treat people for a considerably longer period of time if you're 
even going to think of loosening up or letting down on the intensity 
of the regimen. Dr. fauci says patients should not stop taking the 
drugs on their own. His volunteers will be watched for any rebound 
and put back on the drugs, if necessary. In the meantime, the search 
is on for new drugs to kill the virus without so many debilitating 
side effects. Elizabeth Cohen, CNN, Atlanta.
