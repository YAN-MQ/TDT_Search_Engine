Two cities that lost their NFL franchises, L.A. and Houston, made 
their pitch for the league's next expansion franchise at the NFL owners' 
meeting tuesday. Both cities losing their teams after the '95/'96 
seasons. It is wrong that 16 million fans, all of whom are within 
30 minutes of our site, are not involved in the national football 
league. And I think going forward, Los Angeles is one of the most 
important cities in the world.
