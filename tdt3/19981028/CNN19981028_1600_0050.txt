But first, hurricane Mitch is a little weaker, but still poses a dangerous 
threat to the northwest Caribbean. Forecasters say the storm is stationary, 
with little movement expected through tonight. At last report, Mitch 
was located about 30 miles north of mainland honduras, with winds 
near 120 miles per hour. It's been pounding Honduras and other parts 
of central America with up to 25 inches of rain, and is responsible 
for at least 14 deaths. Martin Savidge has more on evacuation procedures. 
The resort of cancun is usually a place tourists like to escape to. 
Now, it is the place most tourists are trying to escape from. Hurricane 
warnings are posted for all of the Yucatan peninsula. But in cancun, 
so far, there are no official evacuation orders in effect. Most tourists, 
though, aren't waiting for the official word. As many as 30,000 of 
them have been trying to get out of Mitch's way. In the downtown area, 
they've begun boarding up the windows and business fronts, taking 
down awnings and applying tape to the thousands of windows in the 
many high-rise buildings. Local residents have been told to stay up 
on the latest forecast and to stock up on essential supplies. But 
most who live here believe the storm will pass to the south. It is 
to the south, in Honduras, where hurricane Mitch is having the greatest 
and deadliest impact. As many as a dozen deaths have been blamed on 
the storm, including that of one American. Heavy rains of up to 20 
inches in some areas have poured ashore, triggering flooding in communities 
that weren't built to sustain the deluge. Many residents have sought 
the safety of shelters, waiting for the slow-moving hurricane to pass. 
Others don't wish to leave their homes, since it is all they have. 
As much of a pounding as Mitch has been delivering to the Honduran 
rugged coastline, it has been receiving a pounding in return, draining 
some of the storm's fury. Hurricane Mitch may no longer be the monster 
category 5 it once was. But it is still a very dangerous storm and 
still waiting to come ashore. Martin Savidge, CNN, cancun, Mexico.
