A 17-year-old gymnast who ran away from her parents last week was 
legally declared an adult today. Dominique Moceanu, a member of the 
1996 U.S. Olympic team, filed a lawsuit that accused her parents of 
squandering the money she earned since turning pro at age 10. A family 
court in Houston, Texas, approved an arrangement that declares moceanu 
an adult, so she can take control of her remaining fortune. I want 
to get one thing straight is that I'm not living at home. I'm not 
going back home like people have been saying. I'm living still at 
my place, my residency that I have made for me. And second of all, 
I will be looking into my finances. And Mr. Roy Moore will be helping 
me out into, you know, getting my money management and getting it 
handled. And, you know, everything in the future that lies ahead is 
just gonna be up to me from now on. Moceanu claims her father spent 
her earnings on risky investments. It's not clear how much money remains 
in her trust fund.
