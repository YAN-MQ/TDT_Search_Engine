Senator John Glenn and his fellow "discovery" astronauts have a few 
pre-flight events tonight. They'll stand at the base of the launch 
pad and observe the shuttle that will take them into space, and they'll 
spend an hour saying good-bye to their families. But that won't be 
an intimate event. Relatives will be waving and blowing kisses from 
across the street, so as to not pass on any germs. "Discovery" is 
set to lift off tomorrow. Forecasters say the weather will be perfect 
for a launch. Before boarding the space shuttle, the astronauts will 
have the traditional pre-launch breakfast of steak and eggs.
