10 hours 38 right now on "VOA News Now." The United States says it 
is confident both Israel and the Palestinians will live up to their 
new peace agreement. A U.S. State Department spokesman said Washington 
has every confidence Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu will obtain 
the necessary approval of his government. The spokesman also said 
there is no reason to doubt the Palestinians will take the required 
steps to provide a security package. Prime Minister Netanyahu has 
delayed a cabinet debate on the peace accord. Debate was to begin 
Thursday. But Mr. Netanyahu says he'll wait until Israel receives 
a Palestinian action plan for fighting terrorism. The Palestinians 
say there is no deadline for presenting that plan and urged Mr. Netanyahu 
to check with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Under the accord, 
the CIA is to monitor Palestinian security efforts.
