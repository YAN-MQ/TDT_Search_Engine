Is it a vaudeville show? An oratorio? A singing and dancing storybook? 
A live-action cartoon? An environmental theater piece? A pretentious 
pop allegory (with Christian symbolism) that compares the feline condition 
to the human one? At various times, ``Cats,'' the indestructible Andrew 
Lloyd Webber megahit, is all of the above. With its silly cat costumes 
that make the actors look like singing and dancing carnival trophies, 
striped makeup that suggests a 1976 Kiss concert, and lumbering burlesque-show 
choreography, ``Cats'' is also the epitome of a garish kitsch pageant. 
Restaged for home video by David Mallet, does ``Cats,'' which will 
be shown Monday night at 8 o'clock on PBS, work on the small screen? 
Yes and no. Theater, especially when it involves elaborate musical 
staging, is awfully hard to bring to life in another medium unless 
the work is totally reconceived. And ``Cats'' has not been. It is 
a more athletically directed and staged elaboration of the show that 
opened on Broadway 16 years ago (minus the Siamese cat pirate sequence). 
Scenic effects that you accept in a theater _ especially Grizabella's 
ascent to heaven _ look mechanically contrived and ungainly on video. 
In long shots of the production numbers, the dancers blur into unkinetic 
blobs of motion bathed in bright blue light. The spontaneity of live 
performance is compromised by the obvious overdubbing of most if not 
all of the singing. Where the home video has the advantage is in creating 
intimate portraits of the felines who prowl around the junkyard set 
and in magnifying the acrobatics. Grizabella, the faded Glamour Cat 
played by Elaine Paige, has more pathos here than on the stage because 
the camera can gaze close up into her sad, ruined face. You want to 
crawl onto the lap of wise, bearish Old Deuteronomy (Ken Page). With 
his shaking paws and frightened eyes, Gus the Theater Cat (John Mills) 
is a plaintive ruin of a once-elegant figure. But the sentimentality 
of ``Cats'' can become strained. There are moments when the actors 
staring soulfully out of those cartoonish cat faces suggest the pleading 
gazes of the lost children in Edward Keane paintings. Musically, ``Cats'' 
is a one-hit show. Although that hit, ``Memory,'' has been maligned 
as ersatz Puccini, it still beats every other Lloyd Webber ballad 
in sheer melodic clout. To her credit, Ms. Paige, who originated the 
role in London, stays within her character and doesn't use the song 
to flaunt her technique. As for the rest of the songs, based mostly 
on the 14 poems from T.S. Eliot's ``Old Possum's Book of Practical 
Cats,'' the music is overwhelmingly clangy, but at least you can discern 
the words of Eliot's verses. If the gentle whimsy of Eliot's poetry 
has been trampled, the characters in the feline portrait gallery come 
through. They are pop stars on parade. RELEASE NOTES `CATS' Filmed 
at the Adelphi Theater in London. Directed by David Mallet. Starring 
Elaine Paige, John Mills and Ken Page. Polygram Video. 115 minutes.
