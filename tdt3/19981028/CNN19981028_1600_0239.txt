The Clinton administration and NATO are keeping an eye on Serb actions 
in kosovo. NATO's deadline for Serb troop withdrawal in the province 
expired yesterday. An official says Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
has taken a Considerable step in the right direction, but the troop 
pullback is not yet complete. But it was enough to encourage some 
ethnic Albanian refugees to return home to the province. Others say 
they're still suspicious of Milosevic. Secretary of state Madeleine 
Albright says NATO isn't letting its guard down. Milosevic should 
be under no illusions. NATO will be overhead and next door. The OSCE 
will have an intrusive presence on the ground. NAto will remain willing 
and able to act. NATO is keeping 400 planes on alert for possible 
air strikes in Kosovo if milosevic sends his forces back to threaten 
civilians.
