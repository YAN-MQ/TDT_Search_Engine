Like Bernie Williams of the Yankees, the Olympic gymnast Dominique 
Moceanu has been declared a free agent. Wednesday, the 17-year-old 
high school senior was granted adult status by a Houston judge as 
she resolved a lawsuit against her parents, whom she has accused of 
squandering her earnings from a gymnastics career that peaked with 
a gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The ruling empowers Moceanu 
to seek an accounting of her finances, to hire her own agents and 
to make her own endorsement deals without interference from her parents, 
Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu. She hopes for a reconciliation with her 
parents, but will not live at home, said her attorney, Roy Moore of 
Houston. She also retains the right to sue her parents if an examination 
of her finances shows that her earnings have been mismanaged, Moore 
said. It remains unclear how much money Moceanu has left from the 
approximately $1 million she has earned from competitions, endorsements 
and her autobiography since the 1996 Olympics. ``She will begin getting 
her ducks in a row,'' Moore said. ``The big thing is that she can 
contract and run her own life.'' Wednesday's ruling will not speed 
up Moceanu's ability to draw money from a trust fund, to which she 
is blocked access until she is 35, Moore said. But he said she is 
free to begin keeping the money she earns from now on. Moceanu ran 
away from her parents' home 12 days ago and filed suit against her 
parents last week seeking to be declared an adult. She has accused 
her parents of placing her money in risky investments, including a 
$2 million gym in north Harris County. Her parents initially opposed 
her attempt for legal independence, saying she was being influenced 
by friends interested in her money, but both sides reached a settlement 
on Tuesday. Wednesday, Moceanu was given adult status during a 20-minute 
hearing in Houston by State District Judge John Montgomery, and a 
restraining order against her parents was removed. Her father signed 
the agreement with tears in his eyes. ``This was the hardest thing 
I've ever done in my life,'' Dominique Moceanu told reporters. ``It 
was something I felt I had to do.'' She added: ``This is a great day, 
but a sad day. I want to get one thing straight. I'm not living at 
home, I'm not going back home.''
