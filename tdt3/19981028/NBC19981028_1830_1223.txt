Now to "hot spots" making news -- in London, protests outside a British 
high court after it ruled Chile's former dictator augusto Pinochet 
has diplomatic immunity from prosecution. Spain is trying to extradite 
him for trial for kidnaping and murder crimes allegedly occurring 
when he ruled Chile 20 years ago. Thousands died and disappeared. 
Pinochet was arrested earlier this month after going to London for 
medical treatment. He is still being held in his hospital room, pending 
a Spanish appeal.
