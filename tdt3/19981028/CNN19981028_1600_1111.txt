The SEC is charging 44 individuals and companies with committing securities 
fraud over the Internet. The securities and exchange commission says 
the defendants lied about companies through Internet board postings 
and web sites and then profited from quick price increases in the 
companies' stock. The government also alleges the defendants lied 
about their independence from the companies and did not make it clear 
how they were compensated by the companies.
