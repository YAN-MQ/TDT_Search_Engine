An overnight, Milan-bound train derailed early Wednesday near the 
small town of Capena, 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Rome, injuring 
a railway worker who was working on a track nearby. The 420 passengers 
aboard the train, which began in Palermo, Sicily, were unhurt, the 
state railways said. According to investigators, the train failed 
to switch tracks as it was traveling at 120 kilometers (74 miles) 
an hour, double the speed allowed in the stretch where the accident 
occurred, Italian news reports said. A rash of derailments and other 
accidents have plagued the Italian state railways for more than a 
year.
