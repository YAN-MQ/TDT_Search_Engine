The Russian government has run up a budget deficit of 58.5 billion 
rubles (dlrs 3.4 billion) for the first nine months of the year, and 
the economic crisis will make it difficult to close the gap, a report 
said Wednesday. Meanwhile, Russian officials presented the International 
Monetary Fund with its plan to pull the country out of its troubles, 
in a bid for further aid from a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package 
negotiated during the summer. First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov 
led the meeting with IMF officials Wednesday night. Much of the deficit 
has so far been covered by foreign loans, but international lenders 
have frozen assistance since the country was rocked by an economic 
crisis in August. Also, years of heavy borrowing meant that the government 
had to spend 34 percent of its money just to cover the national debt, 
said a report by the Finance Ministry, carried by the ITAR-Tass news 
agency. The government is hoping for additional loans before the end 
of the year. Otherwise, it will probably have to print more money 
more money to pay its bills, a move that would stoke inflation. Russia 
has received only dlrs 4.8 billion of the IMF bailout to date. The 
IMF insists it first wants to see the government's plan to cope with 
the crisis.
