For nearly 20 years, Steve Mann has pursued the dream of developing 
a networked computer that would slip onto the human body as easily 
as a layer of clothing. In the early 1990s, he wore a miner's helmet 
that held a video camera and lights, a modem for Internet access, 
a communications system to broadcast images to the Web, a keyboard, 
and a string of battery packs that trailed behind him as he walked 
around the campus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Everyone 
wanted to talk to the cyberpioneer _ from Time magazine to The National 
Enquirer, which called him ``Web Man Walking.'' So what is it like 
to be married to the world's most popular cyborg? Betty Lo met her 
future husband in 1984 at the McMaster University library in Hamilton, 
Ontario. She noticed a tall man with ``metallic hair, kind of silver 
gray in places.'' She asked him about it and Mann replied that his 
hair had been ``metallized.'' For his devices to work, at the time, 
he had to render his hair conductive by using metallic dyes that proved 
to be ``somewhat permanent.'' They were married in the summer of 1993, 
with Mann the cyborg pulling double-duty as both groom and wedding 
photographer. Ms. Mann, an economist by training who works as an auditor 
for the Ontario government, has become a partner in her husband's 
work. She was also the first human subject to appear in the photographs 
and videos he took while wearing his cyborg suit. And in what might 
be interpreted as a gesture of love, Mann, who is now an assistant 
professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University 
of Toronto, has fashioned for his wife a cyborg suit of her own that 
is electronically connected to his. He devised radio links that connect 
both his suit and Ms. Mann's to an Internet service provider, which 
allows them to send each other images of what they were seeing. (For

have had fun going out on photographic and video expeditions, although 
Ms. Mann did not care for the way the earlier helmeted models of her 
suit messed up her hair. The increase in the speed and power of microprocessors 
has allowed Mann to shrink his equipment to the point where his cyborg 
suit consists principally of a pair of sunglasses, a battery-lined 
suit jacket and a keyboard that can be held in the palm of his hand. 
``Although his invention has become smaller,'' Ms. Mann noted, ``the 
amount of clutter he's needed to maintain it hasn't gotten significantly 
smaller.'' Mann can still attract attention _ and does _ by doing 
things like leaning toward a store radio to distort the frequency 
as a way to pass the time while he is standing in line. This fall, 
Mann attracted a large number of graduate students to a cyborg course 
at the University of Toronto by putting up campus flyers that advertised, 
``You will be assimilated,'' a phrase borrowed from ``Star Trek: The 
Next Generation.'' Mann's days as the world's only cyborg are over, 
but there are times when he and his wife get borged up and enjoy a 
completely new kind of spousal communication. ``We understand each 
other more when we are connected,'' Ms. Mann said. ``It's the same 
way the left side of your brain is connected to the right side of 
your body, and so is the right side. There is no argument between 
the two sides.''
