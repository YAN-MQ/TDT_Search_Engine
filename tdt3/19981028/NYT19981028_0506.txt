One of Picasso's ``Weeping Woman'' portraits, perhaps the last still 
outside museum collections, was bought by the Zurich gallery Apedoros 
for $7.1 million as the auction of the estate of the artist's former 
mistress, Dora Maar, began Tuesday night. Although their relationship 
ended in 1945, Ms. Maar held on to all of Picasso's gifts to her until 
her death last year. On Tuesday, the sale of 31 Picasso paintings 
and drawings and one portrait of Picasso by Ms. Maar fetched a total 
of $30 million, commission included. Smaller works by Picasso as well 
as Ms. Maar's own photographs and paintings are being sold in other 
auctions this week and next month. Decorated stones and matchboxes, 
jewelry, sketches and other objects fetched $6.2 million at Wednesday's 
auction. Two Picasso drawings, of the poet Max Jacob and ``Dora Maar 
and the Minotaur,'' were withdrawn from the sale at the last minute 
to go toward death duty payments to the government. All other works 
up for sale have been cleared to leave France. Heinz Berggruen, a 
German-born dealer who worked for many years in Paris, bought the 
painting ``Dora Maar with Green Fingernails'' for $4.6 million and 
a drawing, ``Dora Maar With Her Hair Loose,'' for $994,000. Both are 
expected to enter Berggruen's private collection, which is on permanent 
exhibition in Berlin. The only other works that brought significantly 
more than $1 million were ``Dora on a Beach'' ($2.3 million) and ``Dora 
Maar With Yellow Scarf'' ($2 million). 2
