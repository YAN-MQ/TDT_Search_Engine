U.S. officials are pressing Israelis and Palestinians to start implementing 
their land-for-security agreement next week. Israeli prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu raised the possibility of a delay last night when 
he indefinitely postponed a cabinet meeting at which the deal was 
to be approved. Today, Israel lifted travel restrictions on Palestinians 
in hebron. They were imposed after a Jewish settler was killed Monday. 
Netanyahu says the Palestinians should renounce violence against Israel. 
All the members of the PNC will be invited to annul or reaffirm the 
annulment of the provisions of the charter calling for the destruction 
of israel. All the members of the PNC, without exception, will be 
invited to do this. And if they are not invited then there won't be 
a fulfillment of palestinian compliance. If they do, then that would 
be a move in the right direction. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
says he is confident both sides will keep their promises to each other.
