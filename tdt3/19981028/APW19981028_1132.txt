League leader Fiorentina and Milan powerhouse Internazionale struggled 
to 1-0 wins against low-ranked opponents in third-round first leg 
games of the Italian Cup Wednesday. The Florentine team downed second-division 
Lecce on a late goal by Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta. Inter 
defeated third-division Castel di Sangro on a powerful free kick by 
young Italian forward Nicola Ventola in a game preceded by a violent 
protest of Inter supporters. Angered by consecutive defeats suffered 
by the Milan team in league matches, groups of Inter fans hurled eggs 
at the bus taking the players to San Siro stadium. The situation remained 
tense inside the arena despite the victory of the home team which 
started 8 non-Italians while keeping Brazilian star Ronaldo at rest. 
It was a lackluster round for the leading Serie A teams with Udinese, 
Sampdoria and Roma held to draws by underdog Vicenza, Bologna and 
Atalanta. On Tuesday league champion Juventus played to a 1-1 home 
tie with unheralded Venezia. Otherwise, two goals by flashy Colombian 
forward Faustino Asprilla gave Parma a 2-1 victory on the road against 
Bari. Asprilla opened the scoring with a precise lob in the 75th minute, 
following a lapse by Bari defense, and added a second goal with a 
powerful drive in injury time. In Florence Batistuta, fed by Brazilian 
teammate Edmundo, kicked in the game winner with seven minutes left. 
Batistuta's goal came following a streak of missed chances by the 
stellar attack of the Florentine team which had irritated the crowd. 
In Milan Ventola scored Inter's winner in the 26th, one minute after 
entering the field as substitute for injured Uruguayan forward Alvaro 
Recoba. In Bargamo, second-division Atalanta scored a quick goal with 
Nicola Zanini, in the 2nd minute. Forward Marco Del Vecchio tallied 
the equalizer in the 30th, avoiding Roma a second upset in four days. 
The Roman team lost 2-3 to AC Milan a league match last Sunday. Udinese-Vicenza 
and Sampdoria-Bologna both ended in goalless draws. The game between 
defending Cup champion Lazio and AC Milan, at Rome's Olympic stadium, 
will complete the first-leg round Thursday night.
